This volume on _Forensic Medicine and Toxicology_ has been\r\nrevised throughout, and certain alterations and additions have been\r\nmade, whilst at the same time the view that the work is intended for\r\nstudents and junior practitioners has not been lost sight of.\r\n\r\nThe author expresses his indebtedness to Dr. M‘Fall, Demonstrator\r\nof Toxicology in the University of Liverpool, for his assistance in\r\nrevising the section on “Toxicology,” and also to the publishers for\r\nthe compilation of the index.\r\n\r\nApart from the general bibliography mentioned in the text, the works\r\nof Taylor and Stevenson, Dickson, Mann, Glaister, Petersen and Haynes,\r\nhave been consulted.\r\n\r\nA plate, showing the centre of ossification in the lower epiphysis of\r\nthe femur in a full time fœtus, has been introduced at the last moment,\r\nand will be found opposite page 64.

We find traces of this science in the Jewish\r\nlaw; among the Egyptians, according to Plutarch; and even among the\r\nRomans as early as the times of Numa Pompilius. Among German writers\r\nthe term State Medicine includes both Medical Jurisprudence and Medical\r\nPolice, Public Health, or Sanitary Science.\r\n\r\nThe special knowledge requisite to the Medical Jurist differs in many\r\nways from that requisite for the art of healing the sick. The majority\r\nof medical students and practitioners may consider a simple exercise\r\nof common sense in the application of their general professional\r\nknowledge to the elucidation of problems of medico-legal import all\r\nthat is requisite, and that no special training is necessary for the\r\npurpose. They may hope that it may never fall to their lot to be\r\ncalled upon to act in the capacity of medical jurists. It may occur,\r\nhowever, to any medical practitioner at any time of his professional\r\ncareer that his services be requisitioned by law for the purpose of\r\nelucidating problems of such a nature as will demand from him thought\r\nand judgment quite apart from those he exercises in the ordinary course\r\nof his medical and surgical practice. From such a requisition he has\r\nno escape; he cannot shift his responsibility to another, and it\r\nbehoves him, therefore, to acquire a knowledge of Forensic Medicine,\r\nin order to guide him, when so called upon, to give such evidence\r\nas will enable a judge and jury to arrive at a just conclusion. The\r\nrelations of all medical practitioners to the State are twofold--first,\r\nas healers of disease, and secondly, both as guardians of the innocent\r\nagainst unfounded criminal charges and aids towards the detection and\r\npunishment of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nLEGAL CRIMINAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Coroner‘s Court.=--The office of coroner is mentioned in a charter\r\nin 925. Coroners were formerly chosen for life by the freeholders of\r\nthe district, but their election is now in the hands of the County\r\nCouncils. Their duties were first clearly pointed out by the Act 4 Edw.\r\nI. c. 2, 1275 (_De officio coronatoris_).\r\n\r\nAt the present time the duties of the coroner are chiefly to hold\r\ninquiry into the cause of death when there is any reason to doubt that\r\ndeath resulted from natural causes.\r\n\r\nWhen death results from natural causes, and under ordinary conditions,\r\nthe medical attendant is bound, under a penalty of forty shillings,\r\nto certify as to the cause. The registrar of deaths accepts such a\r\ncertificate when accompanied by oral testimony given by a person who\r\nwas present at the time of death, and issues a certificate accordingly,\r\nauthorising the interment of the deceased.\r\n\r\nShould conditions obtain to prevent the medical attendant from forming\r\nan opinion as to the cause of death, or which would lead him to infer\r\nthat death did not take place from natural causes, he should notify the\r\nmatter to the coroner. Such would be necessary if death were directly\r\nor indirectly due to accident, or if death occurred within a reasonable\r\ntime after an accident, although due to some other cause, or if an\r\naccident happened to deceased during the course of a chronic illness,\r\nthe accident, however, not being in itself necessarily fatal.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary also to notify the coroner if the death took\r\nplace under circumstances which, to the medical attendant, appeared\r\nsuspicious, such as might arise from culpable neglect or cruelty on\r\nthe part of persons in charge of the deceased. The same would apply to\r\ncases in which the cause of death was unknown. A great responsibility\r\nrests on the medical practitioner, in that he is compelled under a\r\npenalty to certify as to the cause of death; while if he do so without\r\ndue consideration, or carelessly, he renders himself liable to censure\r\nor legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that in certain cases--for example, where an accident\r\nbefell the deceased during the course of a lingering illness, and which\r\nin itself had no causal relations to the death--the doctor may be prone\r\nto certify the death as from the illness alone, taking no note of the\r\naccident; and pressure may be brought to bear upon him by the relations\r\nof the deceased to so certify and save them the trouble and publicity\r\nof an inquest. It should be remembered, however, that although the\r\ncertificate be accepted by the registrar, and interment take place, the\r\ncoroner, if informed of the matter, may order the body to be exhumed\r\nfor the purposes of inquest.\r\n\r\nThere are coroners who, on receipt of information of death from\r\nuncertain causes, may elect, on evidence obtained apart from the\r\nmedical practitioner, to notify the registrar authorising the interment\r\nwithout holding an inquest. The law, however, states that, “except upon\r\nholding an inquest, no order, warrant, or other document for the burial\r\nof the body shall be given by the coroner” (50 and 51 Vict.).\r\n\r\nThe Coroners Act (50 and 51 Vict.) provides that, when a coroner is\r\ninformed that the dead body is lying within his jurisdiction, and there\r\nis reasonable cause to suspect that such person has died a violent or\r\nunnatural death, or a sudden death, of which the cause is unknown, or\r\ndied in prison, he shall summon a jury of not less than twelve, or more\r\nthan twenty-three, men to inquire touching the death of such person\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nIf the deceased were attended at his death, or during his last illness,\r\nby a legally qualified medical practitioner, the coroner may summon\r\nsuch practitioner as a witness. If the deceased were not so attended in\r\nhis last illness, the coroner may summon any legally qualified medical\r\npractitioner in actual practice, in or near the place where the death\r\nhappened, to give evidence as to the cause of death. In either case\r\nthe coroner may require the medical witness to make a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination of the body, with or without analysis of the contents of\r\nthe stomach or intestines.\r\n\r\nShould a statement on oath be made by any one before the coroner, that\r\nin his belief the death of the deceased was caused partly or entirely\r\nby the improper or negligent treatment of a medical practitioner, such\r\nmedical practitioner shall not make or assist at the _post-mortem_\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIf a majority of the jury are not satisfied with the medical evidence,\r\nthey may require the coroner, in writing, to summon another legally\r\nqualified practitioner, named by them, to make a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination, with or without analysis of the contents of the stomach\r\nand intestines, and give evidence as to the cause of death. A medical\r\npractitioner who fails to obey the summons of a coroner, issued in\r\npursuance of the Coroners Act, is liable to a penalty not exceeding\r\nfive pounds, unless he shows good and sufficient cause for not having\r\nso done. When evidence has been given before a coroner or magistrate,\r\nand the case is afterwards sent for trial, copies of the medical report\r\nand depositions are given to the judge and counsel, so that evidence\r\ngiven at the trial is compared in detail with that given before the\r\ncoroner or magistrate. In view of this, it is imperative on the part of\r\nmedical witnesses to carefully consider their evidence before giving it.\r\n\r\nThe object of a coroner‘s inquest is to ascertain whether the death of\r\nthe person, over whose body the inquest is held, was due to natural\r\ncauses or not.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings are not directed against any one, they do not\r\nconstitute a trial, and hearsay evidence is admissible. The coroner\r\nand jury alone have the right to interrogate the witnesses. Counsel\r\nmay be present in the interest of persons concerned with the inquest\r\nwho may desire such assistance, but counsel may not cross-examine any\r\nwitnesses, and may only question them by permission of and subject to\r\nthe decision of the coroner.\r\n\r\nWitnesses are examined on oath, their evidence is taken down, and\r\nshould the case be transferred to a superior court, they are bound\r\nunder a penalty to appear and give evidence. The coroner may adjourn\r\nan inquest for the purpose of obtaining further evidence, if he should\r\ndeem it necessary.\r\n\r\nShould the verdict of the jury charge a person with murder, the coroner\r\nissues a warrant for the arrest of the person, unless the person be\r\nalready in custody. In the case of manslaughter the coroner may accept\r\nbail. According to the Act 4 Edw. I. c. 2, the coroner and jurors must\r\n_view_ the body, this being _absolutely necessary_ to give jurisdiction\r\nto him, and he has the power, within a convenient time after the death,\r\nto order a dead body to be disinterred for this purpose.\r\n\r\n     Order of Summons from the Coroner to a\r\n         Legally Qualified Medical Practitioner\r\n\r\n    =_“London._=\r\n\r\n    _To wit_--_To_ ____________________ Esq., Surgeon.\r\n\r\n     “Sir--By virtue of this my Order as one of His\r\n     Majesty‘s Coroners for the _County of London_ you are\r\n     hereby required to be and appear before me and the jury on\r\n     ______ day, the ______ day of ______ at ______ o‘clock in the\r\n     ______ noon, at ______ in the Parish of ______, then and there\r\n     to give evidence on His Majesty‘s behalf touching the death\r\n     of ____________, and to make or assist in making a _post-mortem_\r\n     examination of the Viscera of the Head, Chest, and Abdomen of\r\n     the body of the said ____________ with ______ an analysis and\r\n     report thereon at the said Inquest. And herein fail not at your\r\n     peril.\r\n\r\n                         Dated the ______ day of ____________ 19.”\r\n                                        (Signature of Coroner.)\r\n\r\n=Prosecution.=--There was no Public Prosecutor in England until some\r\nyears ago, when an Act was passed authorising the appointment of such\r\nan official, who should undertake the duty of prosecuting in certain\r\nand specific cases of public importance, and in districts where the\r\nappointment might be agreed upon. In ordinary circumstances it has\r\nusually been left to the person against whom a crime has been committed\r\nto prosecute the offender.\r\n\r\n=Magistrates‘ Court.=--In the Magistrates‘ Court of Petty Sessions, the\r\nproceedings are for the purpose of investigating as to the culpability\r\nor non-culpability of a person accused of some criminal act, or\r\ncriminal negligence.\r\n\r\nIn this Court the accused person must be present, as the inquiry is\r\nrelative to his guilt or innocence. Witnesses in this Court may be\r\nexamined and cross-examined by counsel. A magisterial investigation\r\ncannot take place if no arrest have been made. The magistrate may\r\ndeal summarily with cases of simple assault and such-like of minor\r\nimport, but when the case is of a more serious nature, and in suspected\r\nmanslaughter or murder, the accused person is committed to a superior\r\nCourt for trial, such as the Court of Quarter Sessions, the Assize\r\nCourt or, in London, the Central Criminal Court, all witnesses, medical\r\nor lay, being bound over to appear and give evidence. The summons to\r\nthe Assizes is called a _subpœna_, and all witnesses receiving the\r\nsame, when accompanied with reasonable travelling expenses, are bound\r\nto obey it.\r\n\r\n=Assizes.=--The Assizes comprise two Courts, the Crown Court and the\r\nCivil Court. A separate judge presides over each. In the former only\r\ncases of a criminal nature are tried; in the latter suits are tried\r\nbetween two parties. Medical practitioners may be called upon to give\r\nevidence in either Court, according to the nature of the case in which\r\nthey are directly concerned.\r\n\r\nPrior to a case being investigated by a judge and petty jury, it has\r\nto come before the grand jury. This jury decides whether the case is a\r\nproper one to proceed to trial.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury hear the evidence of such witnesses as they think fit,\r\napart from counsel. Should the grand jury consider the case one for\r\ntrial, they return a “true bill,” and it goes before the judge and\r\npetty jury; if not, they “cut the bill,” and the accused is discharged.\r\n\r\nMedical witnesses may be called upon, when under subpœna, to give\r\nevidence before the grand jury.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Court of Assize consists of a judge and a sworn jury of\r\ntwelve men, called the petty jury. The latter hear the evidence of\r\nwitnesses, and are guided by the summing up of the judge. They deliver\r\na verdict after consideration of the evidence by which the accused\r\nperson is found guilty or not guilty. The judge, after receiving the\r\nverdict, allots such punishment as he considers just. In certain cases\r\nthe prisoner when convicted may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.\r\n\r\nIn the Assize Courts only barristers can plead; in the Magistrates‘\r\nCourts of Petty Sessions, solicitors or barristers may plead.\r\n\r\nIn the Courts of Assize the witnesses are subject to the following\r\nroutine of examination. First, _Examination-in-chief_: this the witness\r\nundergoes at the hands of the barrister who is pleading on behalf of\r\nthe party by whom the witness is called. In this examination such\r\nquestions are put to the witness as may elicit answers conveying to the\r\njudge and jury a clear account of all the witness knows with regard to\r\nthe case. After the examination-in-chief, the counsel of the opposite\r\nside subjects the witness to _cross-examination_, in such a way as to\r\nshake the evidence given by the witness during his examination in chief\r\nin points which would weigh against the prospects of his client. _It is\r\nduring cross-examination that a medical witness may be subjected to\r\nquestions which suggest answers capable of a different interpretation\r\nfrom those he had previously given._ After cross-examination, the\r\ncounsel for the party upon whose side the witness appears subjects the\r\nlatter to _re-examination_, if he consider it necessary, during which\r\nhe endeavours to clear up any doubtful points in the evidence given by\r\nthe witness during cross-examination, with the purpose of eliciting an\r\nexplanation of their meaning.\r\n\r\nThe judge and members of the jury may put such questions to the witness\r\nas they may consider necessary.\r\n\r\nThe same method of procedure applies to the higher Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND\r\n\r\nIn Scotland public prosecutors are appointed by the Crown. The\r\nchief public prosecutor is the Lord-Advocate; next in rank come\r\nthe Deputy-Advocates and Procurator-Fiscal. The Lord-Advocate and\r\nDeputies take charge of cases in the High Courts of Justiciary, the\r\nProcurator-Fiscal in the lower Courts.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the public prosecutor are to bring all accused persons\r\nto a bar of justice; and in addition he acts as the coroner does\r\nin England. Any person who is supposed to know anything about the\r\ncase is interrogated by the Procurator-Fiscal, or is _precognosced_.\r\nThe examination is made on oath; the written evidence constitutes\r\nthe _precognitions_. Counsel for the accused or for the Crown may\r\nprecognosce witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary examination of the accused takes place before the\r\nSheriff or Justice, and he may commit the person for trial or liberate\r\nhim, according to the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe precognitions, in cases of committal, are forwarded to the Crown\r\nCounsel in Edinburgh, who may stop the proceedings, or send the accused\r\nbefore the High Court, Circuit Court of Justiciary, or Sheriff, with\r\nor without a jury. The Justiciary Courts correspond to the Courts of\r\nAssize in England. Should the case be so transferred for trial, the\r\nwitnesses are summoned by writ. A penalty of £5 may be imposed for\r\ndisobedience to such writ, or imprisonment pending expression of regret\r\nbefore the Court, and tendering bail for appearance.\r\n\r\nCommon witnesses and medical witnesses to fact are not allowed in\r\nCourt except when giving evidence. Expert witnesses may be allowed to\r\nremain in Court by mutual consent of counsel. When one expert witness\r\nis giving evidence, other experts are required to leave the Court, and\r\nno expert witness who may have been present during the examination of\r\ncommon witnesses is allowed to give evidence as to facts.\r\n\r\nThe verdicts of “Guilty” or “Not guilty” are similar to those given in\r\nEngland, but in addition a verdict of “Not proven” may be given, and\r\nall are final. In the case of the last two the accused cannot be tried\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the verdict of a bare majority of the jury holds\r\ngood, whereas in England the decision must be unanimous. In the\r\ncase of a suspicious death, or a dead body being discovered, the\r\nProcurator-Fiscal, acting as a coroner does in England, but without\r\na jury, may direct a medical man to examine the body and send in a\r\nreport; but all reports must be certified _on soul and conscience_,\r\nwithout which they are of no value. Should the medical examiner be\r\nsatisfied without making an internal examination, he may certify to the\r\nProcurator-Fiscal on the result of his external examination.\r\n\r\nShould the Procurator-Fiscal consider it requisite to have a complete\r\nexamination, he issues a warrant to that effect to the medical\r\npractitioner who has seen the case, and usually associates with him the\r\nmost skilled practitioner available in the neighbourhood. The warrant\r\nconsists of a petition by the Procurator-Fiscal, addressed to the\r\nlocal judge, setting forth the grounds of his application, and craving\r\nwarrant to the inspectors named to make the necessary examination. This\r\nis signed by the Procurator-Fiscal, and countersigned by the Sheriff or\r\nlocal judge, if granted. The receivers of this warrant are empowered\r\nto take full custody of the body, and they should be _careful to carry\r\nthe warrant with them_, or they may be refused admission pending its\r\nproduction, which may result in great waste of time, and end in a\r\nmiscarriage of justice. The Procurator-Fiscal may supply to the medical\r\ninspectors portions of the precognitions likely to bear on the medical\r\npart of the inquiry. Medical men ought to be on their guard against\r\nperforming dissections in cases evidently judicial without previously\r\nwarning the proper law authorities, or without a warrant; for instances\r\nhave occurred where, owing to the want of proper support, obstructions\r\nwere thrown in the way which might have proved fatal to the value\r\nof the investigation; and, besides, the premature disclosure of the\r\nresults of the inspection might frustrate other important steps of the\r\nprecognition.\r\n\r\nThe medical men so engaged will, as a rule, find it to their interest\r\nto exclude all visitors, whether lay or professional, from the room\r\nduring the dissection. The regulations issued by the Crown Office,\r\nEdinburgh, direct that no one should be allowed to be present at\r\nthe examination out of mere curiosity, and recommend that any one\r\nnot engaged in the inspection, but who is in attendance to give\r\ninformation, or for any other purpose, and who may afterwards become\r\na witness, should remain in an adjoining room. The medical inspection\r\noften furnishes good tests of the value of other evidence in the case;\r\ntherefore, it is desirable that the general witnesses should not have\r\nan opportunity of knowing what is observed in the dissection of the\r\nbody. The notes of a case should be made at the time of inspection or\r\nimmediately afterwards. In the case of _post-mortem_ examinations it\r\nis better that while one inspector conducts the practical details of\r\nthe examination, the other should take notes of its successive steps,\r\nindicating all the points inquired into, with the observations made,\r\nthe appearances presented, negative as well as positive, stating simple\r\nfacts alone, without either generalisations or opinions. These notes\r\nshould be looked over by both inspectors before the body is sewn up, so\r\nthat omissions in the notes, or in the inspection itself, may be then\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation of Witnesses--Subpœna\r\n\r\nIn England, except upon a subpœna, a medical man is not bound to attend\r\nas a witness at a trial, and then it should be served a reasonable time\r\nbefore the trial, in order that he may make proper arrangements for\r\nthe carrying on of his business during his absence. In civil cases his\r\nreasonable expenses should be tendered to him at the time the subpœna\r\nis served, or within a reasonable time of the trial; and he may refuse\r\nto give evidence unless his charges are paid, provided his objection be\r\nstated _before he has been sworn_. A witness may be summoned from any\r\npart of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised, whether a _scientific witness_ was bound\r\nto attend when subpœnaed. The law on the point is enveloped in some\r\nobscurity; the better course is therefore to attend.\r\n\r\nNo tender of fees is necessary in criminal cases, “except in the case\r\nof witnesses living in one distinct part of the United Kingdom being\r\nrequired to attend subpœnas directing their attendance in another, who\r\nare not liable to punishment for disobedience of the process, unless\r\nat the time of service a reasonable and sufficient sum of money, to\r\ndefray their expenses in coming, attending, and returning, have been\r\ntendered to them.” When summoned to two cases, the one civil, the other\r\ncriminal, the witness must attend the criminal; or when both cases are\r\nthe same, the one to which he first received the subpœna--notifying,\r\nhowever, to the counsel engaged on the other case his unavoidable\r\nabsence, and giving the reasons which prevent his attendance.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, witnesses are summoned by a writ or citation, which\r\nmust be delivered at the residence of the witness a reasonable time\r\nbefore the trial. Delivery to a member of the family, or a servant\r\nnot within the house, will not do. If access cannot be gained, the\r\ncopy is fastened to the most patent door of the house. If the witness\r\ndo not appear, and it be clearly shown that he was duly cited, a\r\nwarrant for his apprehension may be issued, and he becomes liable to\r\nbe incarcerated till he finds “caution” for his due attendance at the\r\ntrial. His non-attendance may also, unless good excuse be forthcoming,\r\nrender him liable to a fine, or unlaw, of a hundred merks Scots--about\r\n£5.\r\n\r\n=Form of Subpœna in England.=--Where a medical witness has given\r\nevidence in a case in which the accused person has been committed for\r\ntrial to a superior Court, he is summoned to give evidence at such\r\nCourt in the following terms:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L.S.]\r\n\r\n    “George, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of\r\n    Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith,\r\n    To ______________________ Greeting: We command you, and every\r\n    of you, that all business being laid aside, and all excuses\r\n    ceasing, you do in your proper persons appear before our\r\n    Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace (or other Court),\r\n    assigned to keep the peace in the City (or Borough) of\r\n    __________________________, and also to hear and determine\r\n    divers Felonies, Trespasses, and other Misdemeanours in our\r\n    said City (or Borough) committed, to be holden within the\r\n    _______________________, in the said City (or Borough),\r\n    on ____________________ the _______ day of _________________\r\n    now next ensuing, at the hour of ten o‘clock in the forenoon\r\n    of the same day, to testify the truth and give evidence,\r\n    on our behalf, against __________________ in a case of\r\n    _____________; and this and every of you are in no wise to\r\n    omit, under the Penalty of Twenty Pounds for you and every\r\n    of you. Witness, ___________________, Esq., our Recorder at\r\n    ____________ aforesaid, the ________ day of ____________ in\r\n    the ________ year of our reign.”\r\n\r\n                                   “(Signed)\r\n                                            “Clerk of the Peace.”\r\n\r\nIn =Scotland= the following is the form of summons to appear before the\r\nHigh Court of Justiciary, and at an inquiry into a fatal accident:\r\n\r\n                                 (I.)\r\n    “_To_ __________________________________________________\r\n\r\n    “You are hereby lawfully cited to attend a sitting of\r\n    the High Court of Justiciary within the Criminal Court\r\n    __________, upon the ___________ day of _________ Nineteen\r\n    hundred __________ years, at ______ o‘clock _______ noon,\r\n    as a witness in the case against _______________________,\r\n    prisoner in the Prison of _______________, and that under\r\n    the pain of One Hundred Merks Scots.\r\n\r\n                                       “(Signed)\r\n                                                “Sheriff-Officer.\r\n\r\n        “_Note._--Any witness failing to appear in terms\r\n          of citation not only forfeits the penalty, but\r\n          is liable to be apprehended and imprisoned.\r\n\r\n              “(Preserve and bring this Copy with you.)”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES ALLOWED TO MEDICAL WITNESSES\r\n\r\n=Coroner‘s Court.=--The Coroners Act states that fees for medical\r\nwitnesses attending an inquest shall be, for attending to give evidence\r\nat an inquest whereat no _post-mortem_ examination has been made by\r\nthe witness, one guinea. For making a _post-mortem_ examination and\r\nattending to give evidence, two guineas. No fee can be obtained for\r\nmaking a _post-mortem_ examination by a medical practitioner, unless it\r\nbe made by order of the coroner. Extra fees are not provided for when\r\nthe inquest is adjourned. For an inquest held over the body of a person\r\nwho has died in a lunatic asylum, public hospital, infirmary, workhouse\r\ninfirmary, or other medical institution, whether endowed or supported\r\nby voluntary contributions, the medical officer of such institution\r\nshall not be entitled to a fee. Should the dead body of a person be\r\ntaken to such an institution, the medical officer, if summoned to give\r\nevidence, is entitled to the usual fee. Such fees are paid at the\r\ntermination of the inquest.\r\n\r\n=Magistrates‘ Court.=--If the witness reside within two miles of the\r\nCourt, the fee is ten shillings and sixpence; beyond two miles, one\r\nguinea.\r\n\r\n=Courts of Quarter Sessions=, and =Central Criminal Court of\r\nLondon=.--One guinea per day, and two shillings a night away from home,\r\nwith threepence per mile each way travelling expenses.\r\n\r\n=Assize Court.=--One guinea per day, with two shillings a night away\r\nfrom home, and a reasonable and sufficient amount for travelling\r\nexpenses. If there be no railway, threepence a mile each way. Sundays\r\nare not included.\r\n\r\n=Court of Probate and Divorce.=--One guinea per day within five miles\r\nof the General Post Office. If beyond, two or three guineas a day, with\r\nexpenses out of pocket for coming and returning.\r\n\r\n=Court of Appeal.=--One guinea a day if resident in London; two or\r\nthree guineas, with travelling expenses, if from a distance.\r\n\r\n=County Court.=--From fifteen shillings as an ordinary witness, with\r\none guinea per day expenses if from home, to one to three guineas for\r\nqualifying as an expert witness. With attendance at Court one to two\r\nguineas and expenses one to three guineas per day.\r\n\r\n=In Civil Cases.=--An arrangement is usually made with the solicitor\r\nfor a fee; this should be made before accepting the subpœna. A written\r\nundertaking for payment, and properly stamped, should be obtained from\r\nthe solicitor before giving evidence; in default of this, the witness\r\nshould appeal to the judge from the witness-box before being sworn.\r\nAfter taking the oath a witness is bound to give evidence, and the\r\nsolicitor may refer him to his client for the fee, which may lead to\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nThe fee for attendance at High Courts of Justiciary or the Sheriff\r\nCriminal Court is one guinea per day, if the Court be held in the town\r\nin which the medical witness lives. For a post-mortem examination\r\nand report, two guineas. For an analysis of blood or other stains on\r\nclothing, two to four guineas, depending upon the amount of work done.\r\n\r\nIf the witness come from a distance, he is allowed two guineas per day,\r\nboth for the actual attendance at Court and also for each day occupied\r\nin travelling to and fro, with a guinea a day for travelling expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE GENERALLY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the subject of evidence it is necessary to say a few words, for\r\nit must be remembered that that which may be held to be evidence in\r\nlogic may not be so in law. Nothing in law is intuitive--nothing is\r\nself-evident; everything must go through the process of proof by\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nLegal evidence is therefore composed of testimony, but all testimony\r\nis not necessarily evidence in law. Thus, if a witness declare that he\r\nsaw a certain act committed, his testimony may be accepted as evidence;\r\nbut if he state that his knowledge of a fact is obtained from another\r\nperson, such information, although it contain an absolutely true\r\ndescription of what actually occurred, will not be received. In this\r\ncase his testimony is simply hearsay, and as such is not admissible,\r\nexcept in the case of dying declarations, and in one or two other\r\ninstances which do not, however, concern us.\r\n\r\nMedical evidence may be divided under the following heads: (1)\r\nDocumentary; (2) Oral or Parol; (3) Experimental.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DOCUMENTARY\r\n\r\nUnder this head are included Medical Certificates, Written Opinions,\r\nMedical Reports, and Dying Declarations.\r\n\r\n=Medical Certificates.=--Certificates generally refer to death, to\r\nvaccination, to notification of infectious and industrial diseases, and\r\nin districts which have adopted it, the notification of births; to the\r\nstate of health of an individual, &c. For those which have respect to\r\nthe health or to the illness of an individual there is no particular\r\nlegal form, as a certificate is merely a simple statement of a fact.\r\nThe only essential condition is that it contains the exact truth,\r\nand any departure from this will entail heavy penalties. A statement\r\nsigned by a registered medical practitioner, distinctly describing the\r\ncondition of A or B, is all that is necessary as far as the law in\r\nEngland is concerned. In Scotland the law is somewhat different, for\r\n“A certificate of bad health by a physician or surgeon must bear to be\r\n_on soul and conscience_.” ... “In cases of homicide, and other crimes\r\nagainst the person, medical certificates produced respecting the nature\r\nof the injuries must be verified on oath by the medical persons who\r\ngranted them” (_Dictionary Scot. Law_). In Scotland, the omission of\r\nthe words “on soul and conscience” invalidates a certificate.\r\n\r\nCertificates of death, of vaccination, of notification of infectious\r\ndiseases, tuberculosis, industrial diseases, and births, and of\r\ninsanity can be procured already printed in the forms prescribed by the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n=Certificates of the Cause of Death.=--A medical practitioner who has\r\nbeen in attendance during the last illness of a person is legally\r\nbound to give a certificate stating, “to the best of his knowledge and\r\nbelief, the cause of death.” If he be unaware of the cause of death,\r\nor have reason to believe that death was not due to natural causes, or\r\nthe result of violence, he may refuse the certificate. In such a case\r\nit is customary and desirable for the medical man to notify the Coroner\r\nof the circumstance as soon as possible. If he have no reasonable cause\r\nto prevent him supplying the certificate, he is liable to a penalty\r\nnot exceeding forty shillings. In England and Ireland it is given to\r\na relative of the deceased or legally authorised person, who must\r\ndeliver it to the Registrar. In Scotland the doctor sends it to the\r\nRegistrar direct. Not more than one certificate should be given. No fee\r\nis chargeable. The information on the certificate should be as clear,\r\ncomplete, and accurate as possible.\r\n\r\n=Notification of Births.=--When the authorities of any district have\r\nadopted the Notification of Births Act of 1907, it is the duty of any\r\nperson who has been in attendance on the mother at the time, or within\r\nsix hours after the birth, to give notice of the birth in writing\r\nto the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the child\r\nis born. The necessary certificate must be filled in and posted to\r\nthe Medical Officer of Health within thirty-six hours of the time of\r\nbirth. The certificate applies to any child dead or alive born after\r\nthe twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. Should the relatives of, or other\r\nattendant upon the mother, fail to notify the birth, it is the duty\r\nof the medical attendant to do so, failing which he may be fined not\r\nexceeding twenty shillings.\r\n\r\n=Notification of Infectious Diseases.=--By the Act of Parliament\r\n1889, every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit\r\nthe patient, shall forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is\r\nsuffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, send to\r\nthe Medical Officer of Health of the district a certificate stating the\r\nname of the patient, the situation of the building, and the infectious\r\ndisease from which in the opinion of such medical practitioner the\r\npatient is suffering.\r\n\r\nThe notifiable diseases are: smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous\r\ncroup, erysipelas, scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus, typhoid,\r\nenteric, relapsing, continued and puerperal fever.\r\n\r\nBy consent of the Local Government Board the Health Authorities may add\r\nother diseases as occasion may require for a time or permanently. Of\r\nthese due notice is given to medical men. Tuberculosis and ophthalmia\r\nneonatorum are now notifiable. The fee for the certificate in private\r\npractice is 2_s._ 6_d._, if in a public institution, 1_s._ Failure to\r\ncertify renders the medical man liable to a penalty of 40_s._\r\n\r\n=Notification of Tuberculosis.=--As mentioned previously, tuberculosis\r\nis now a disease notification of which is compulsory. Special forms are\r\nprovided for the purpose.\r\n\r\n=Notification of Industrial Diseases.=--Under the Factory and Workshop\r\nAct, 1901, every case of lead, phosphorus, arsenical, or mercurial\r\npoisoning, or anthrax, if contracted in a factory or workshop must be\r\nnotified by the practitioner in attendance on the case. The certificate\r\nmust be sent to the Chief Inspector of Factories at the Home Office,\r\nLondon. The fee for notification is 2_s._ 6_d._ Other diseases may be\r\nadded to the list by special order of the Home Office.\r\n\r\n=Written Opinions.=--These generally refer to civil questions.\r\n\r\n=The Medical Report.=--A _Report_ is a document given in obedience to a\r\ndemand by the public authorities in Scotland, and has reference chiefly\r\nto criminal cases. Medical Reports are sworn to as true by those who\r\ndraw them up. According to Alison, it is not a sufficient objection\r\nthat a Medical Report was made up at an interval after the occurrence\r\nof the circumstances to which it refers. The same high authority also\r\nstates that should the writer of a Medical Report die before the trial,\r\nhis Report may be used in evidence,--this may be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for simplicity in the arrangement and in the wording of\r\ntheir Reports cannot be too strongly urged on medical men. “A medical\r\nwitness will do well to remember, also, that copies of his Report and\r\ndepositions, either before a coroner or a magistrate, are usually\r\nplaced in the hands of counsel as well as of the Court; and that his\r\nevidence, as it is given at the trial, is compared word for word with\r\nthat which has already been put on record.” All hearsay statements and\r\nirrelevant matter should not be inserted in a Report; and the reporter\r\nshould be particularly careful not to add any comments to his simple\r\nnarration of facts. The use of superlatives is also very objectionable,\r\nas it partakes somewhat of exaggeration. All technical words or phrases\r\nshould be as much as possible avoided; and where they are absolutely\r\nnecessary, they should be briefly explained.\r\n\r\nAs a case in point, showing the necessity for care in the use of words,\r\nis the following from a published Paper by the late Sir R. Christison:\r\n“Some years ago, on an important trial in the High Court of Justiciary\r\nfor assault, the public prosecutor attempted to prove that the person\r\nassailed had been wounded to the effusion of blood; which is held in\r\nlaw to be an aggravation of guilt in such cases. When the principal\r\nmedical witness was examined as to the injuries inflicted, he was asked\r\nwhether any blood had been effused; and he replied that a good deal\r\nmust have been effused. But he meant that there was effusion of blood\r\nunder the skin, constituting the contusion he had described; while the\r\ncounsel and the Court at first received his answer as implying that\r\nthere had been considerable loss of blood from a wound. The latter view\r\nwas on the point of passing to the jury as a fact, when one of the\r\njudges detected the equivoque, and set the matter to rights.”[1]\r\n\r\n[1] _Monthly Journal of Medical Science_, 1851.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland a medical practitioner may be called upon by the\r\nauthorities to grant reports as to dead bodies, without performing a\r\n_post-mortem_ examination.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, where a death has occurred unaccompanied by any\r\nsuspicious circumstances, or where the evidence of suicide or death\r\nfrom accidental injury is apparent from a simple examination of the\r\nbody, a certificate “on soul and conscience,” stating the probable\r\ncause of death, is considered sufficient by the authorities, and a\r\n_post-mortem_ is dispensed with. It is not necessary that the deceased\r\nbe seen by the medical practitioner before death, “yet, from the\r\nsuddenness of the death, the age of the deceased, and the symptoms\r\nspoken to by the friends, he may still be enabled, satisfactorily to\r\nhimself, to certify the cause of death.” In England, such a case would\r\nbe the subject of a coroner‘s inquest.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, he may be summoned by a constable to inspect a body\r\nfound on the public road, or in any other unusual situation. In this\r\ncase he is called not only to certify the fact, but also the probable\r\n_cause_ of death. He may, under these circumstances, give a report of\r\nthe external examination of the body, at the same time suggesting the\r\nnecessity for further and more careful examination by dissection, &c.,\r\nand this is considered the proper course for him to take. In England,\r\nin this case also, an inquest would be necessary. In all cases medical\r\nmen will consult their own interests in giving these Reports.\r\n\r\nA Medical Report consists of two parts--the _Minute of the\r\nExamination_, and the _Reasoned Opinion_ on the first portion of the\r\nReport. In the case where the Report is made by two or more persons\r\nappointed for the purpose, the latter portion is written in the plural,\r\nand signed by each of the parties certifying.\r\n\r\nThe following is an outline of a Medical Report, which may be more or\r\nless modified to suit the requirements of the case:\r\n\r\n                        FORM OF MEDICAL REPORT\r\n\r\n             (_Date._)      (_Place of Examination._)\r\n    (_Names of those who can speak to the Identity of the Body._)\r\n\r\n                     I.

Cranial Cavity._\r\n\r\n    1. Condition of the bones of the skull.\r\n\r\n    2. Condition of the membranes and sinuses of the brain.\r\n\r\n    3. Condition and appearances of the brain substance.\r\n\r\n    4. Contents of the lateral ventricles.\r\n\r\n                    _B. Thoracic Cavity._\r\n\r\n    1. Position of the organs on opening the chest.\r\n\r\n    2. Condition of the heart, large blood-vessels, and\r\n        pericardium.\r\n\r\n    3.

Contents of the stomach and bladder.--_Should it\r\n        be necessary to remove the stomach and intestines, two\r\n        ligatures should be placed at the cardiac extremity of the\r\n        stomach and also at the pyloric end, and cut between the two\r\n        ligatures, then the stomach may be removed intact; and other\r\n        ligatures at the end of small intestines, also the rectum,\r\n        and the bowels then removed as conditions demand._\r\n\r\n    4. Condition of the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n    5. Condition of bones and joints.\r\n\r\n                       II. THE REASONED OPINION\r\n\r\n    In this portion of the Report the inspectors state the\r\n    nature of the conclusion at which they have arrived, and\r\n    their reasons.\r\n\r\n    _Recapitulation of the foregoing Rules._--It may be\r\n    of advantage here to restate, in a tabular form, a few\r\n    suggestions as to the composition of the Report:\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--1. Let the Report be as short as possible, but\r\n    state your views with clearness and distinctness. After\r\n    stating the nature of the disease in any organ, report\r\n    “all other organs healthy,” if they have been found so. To\r\n    specify some organs, omitting others, may lead to a pressing\r\n    inquiry from counsel as to the condition of the supra-renal\r\n    capsules, or some other organ, and an unfounded doubt cast\r\n    on the Report of the examiner.\r\n\r\n    2. Always avoid the use of technical terms as far as\r\n        possible, so that you may be saved the annoyance of having\r\n        to explain your meaning in the witness-box.\r\n\r\n    3. Express all dates and numbers in writing. Measure all\r\n        marks, and describe their size and appearance in writing.\r\n        Carefully write all names of persons to whom reference\r\n        is made. Take accurate notes, and from them compose your\r\n        report. Make a list of all articles submitted for inspection\r\n        and analysis, and label them.\r\n\r\n    4. State all facts clearly and chronologically. A\r\n       _fact_ is what is known directly and personally to\r\n       witness, and not what has been repeated by some\r\n       other person. Do not report hearsay testimony as\r\n       matters of fact.\r\n\r\n    5. Every report should be written under the impression that\r\n        it may come into court to be read.\r\n\r\n    6. Always avoid superlatives and all epithets of feeling or\r\n        impressions on the mind.\r\n\r\n    7. Always avoid speculative opinions and reference to moral\r\n        circumstances, unless specially required to do so.\r\n\r\n    8. State your conclusions at the end of the Report in as few\r\n        sentences as possible.\r\n\r\n    9. Keep a rough draft of all your Reports, for future\r\n        reference.\r\n\r\n    10. Transmit Report, signed and dated, without unnecessary\r\n        delay, to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n=Dying Declarations.=--The principle on which these are accepted is\r\nfounded, partly on the awful situation of the dying person, and partly\r\non the absence of interested motives in one on the brink of eternity,\r\nand which is supposed to obviate the necessity of a cross-examination.\r\nThe law presumes that any one cognisant of impending death will tell\r\nthe truth, and such declarations are equal to evidence on oath. The\r\ngreatest care must be taken by the medical man who is called in to see\r\na person supposed to be dying, with regard to any declaration he or\r\nshe may wish to make. He must be satisfied as to the mental condition\r\nof the person. The medical attendant should simply take the statement\r\nas it is made, writing it down on the spot, or as soon after as\r\npossible. The identical words used should be committed to paper, and\r\nno suggestions or interpretations of his own should be made. Leading\r\nquestions should never be put, nor any attempt made to induce the\r\npatient to make any statement. When we consider the condition of the\r\npatient, the possibility of delirium induced by the severity of the\r\ninjury, together with the dread of death, it is, to say the least,\r\ninjudicious to introduce the suspected party into the room for the\r\npurpose of identification, though this procedure has been suggested\r\nby some writers. In every case, however, it is advisable for the\r\nmedical attendant, as soon as he sees that the case must end fatally,\r\nto acquaint the patient in the presence of others of the fact, when\r\nany statements made may then be taken. It is preferable that such\r\nstatements be made before a magistrate if time will allow. It should\r\nalso be borne in mind by those receiving dying declarations, that in\r\nEngland “it must be shown that the deceased, at the time he made the\r\nstatement, was under the impression that death was impending; not\r\nmerely that he had received an injury from which death must ensue,\r\nbut that, as the popular phrase goes, ‘he then believed he was on the\r\npoint of death’” (R. _v._ Forester). In one case (R. _v._ Fagent, 7 C.\r\n& P. 238) it was held that a declaration was inadmissible, because the\r\nperson making it asked some one near her whether he thought she would\r\n“rise again”; and it was held that this showed such a hope of recovery\r\nas rendered the previous declaration inadmissible. The declaration\r\nshould be signed by the person making it, and witnessed by some one\r\npresent at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Reg. _v._ Whitmarsh (Central Criminal Court, Sept.\r\n19, 20, 21, 1896), 62 J.P. 680. Upon an indictment for the murder of\r\na woman, who died as the result of the prisoner having used certain\r\ninstruments or other means upon her with the intent to procure her\r\nmiscarriage, it was shown that an inspector of police had seen her at\r\nCharing Cross Hospital. He asked her questions, and from her answers\r\nhe wrote down a statement. The woman signed it. On July 7 the woman\r\nappeared to be in a dying condition, and was aware of it. She said she\r\nfeared she must die, and asked to see her mother and a clergyman. The\r\ndoctor told her that he had given up all hope, and that she might not\r\nlive to see her mother. A magistrate saw her shortly afterwards, and\r\nread over to her the statement she made on June 29, and he affixed to\r\nit the following note, “This statement was read over to Alice Bayley\r\nby me, and is referred to in her dying declaration,” and signed.\r\n_Held_ (Darling, J.), that though this statement might be admissible,\r\nit had better not be admitted in evidence. On the same day the woman\r\nhad also made a statement to the magistrate, of which he had taken\r\nnote, but before it was finished she became exhausted. The magistrate\r\nthen took the statement of June 29, repeated portions of it to her in\r\nhis own words, wrote these down, and asked her if it was correct. He\r\nthen read the whole statement to her and she signed it. The statement\r\ncommenced, “Having the fear of death before me, and being without hope\r\nof recovery”--concluding with the words, “And the statement I made on\r\nthe 29th of June, and have now heard read over, is true.”\r\n\r\nJustice Darling held this statement was admissible as a dying\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Rex _v._ Smith, 65 J.P. 426 (Bruce, J., Central Criminal\r\nCourt). A magistrate and a doctor visited a dying woman for the purpose\r\nof taking her statement. In reply to a question put to her by one of\r\nthem, she said, “I am aware that I am seriously ill.” The magistrate\r\nasked her questions and the doctor wrote down the answers. At the trial\r\nthe statement was objected to as inadmissible as a dying declaration\r\non two grounds: Firstly, that the statement consists only of answers\r\nto questions put to her by the magistrate, and so comes within the\r\nruling of Cave, J., in Reg. _v._ Mitchell, 17 Cox C.C. 503, that “a\r\ndeclaration should be taken down in the exact words which the person\r\nwho makes it uses, in order that it may be possible from those words\r\nto arrive precisely at what the person meant. When a statement is not\r\nthe _ipsissima verba_ of the person making it, but is composed of a\r\nmixture of questions and answers, there are several objections open to\r\nits reception in evidence.... In the first place, the questions may\r\nbe leading questions, and in the condition of a person making a dying\r\ndeclaration there is always very great danger of leading questions\r\nbeing answered without their force and effect being fully comprehended.”\r\n\r\nSecondly, the prosecution had not shown that at the time the woman made\r\nthe statement she was in expectation of immediate death.\r\n\r\nThe judge held (1) That the prosecution had not proved that in her own\r\nopinion the woman was beyond all hope of recovery, and that therefore\r\nthe statement was inadmissible; (2) That such a statement--the\r\nmagistrate asking her questions and the doctor taking down only her\r\nanswers in writing--was not admissible as a dying declaration.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Rex _v._ Holloway, 65 J.P. 712 (Wills, J., Central\r\nCriminal Court). The prisoner threw a burning lamp at his stepson and\r\nset fire to his stepdaughter, who succumbed to the burns she received.\r\nA deposition of the deceased girl was taken down by a magistrate. At\r\nthe time it was taken it was intended that it should be in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the 1867 Act. The accused was present and had\r\nfull opportunity of cross-examining the witness. The deposition was\r\nread over to the girl, and she assented to it, but could not sign it\r\nbecause of the injuries to her hands. The magistrate who took the\r\ndeposition signed it. It was held that the deposition had been taken in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Indictable Offences Act, 1848,\r\nsec. 17, and was admissible though it had not been signed by the girl.\r\n\r\nThe validity of a dying declaration has been called in question when\r\nmade by a person who has suffered a severe concussion of the brain,\r\nand then recovered his sensibility. It is well known that under such\r\ncircumstances the recollection of what took place before or after the\r\ninjury is in many cases very imperfect, and the injured party may thus\r\ndraw unintentionally upon his imagination for his facts. In Scotland,\r\n“the written deposition of a person who is dead is admissible, whether\r\nthe person were the party injured or not, if he would have been a\r\ncompetent witness. It is not necessary that the deceased believe\r\nhimself to be dying when he emits the deposition, for his consciousness\r\nof approaching death may be inferred from the nature of the wound,\r\nor the state of illness or other circumstances of the case. Such\r\ndepositions are generally taken by a magistrate, but a declaration\r\ndeliberately made, though without an oath, and taken down ‘by a\r\ncreditable person,’ is admissible” (Macdonald, _Scottish Criminal Law_,\r\np. 512).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ORAL OR PAROL\r\n\r\nA medical man may be called as a _common witness_, or as an _expert_\r\nwitness. In the _first_ case, he has only to state, as any other\r\nwitness might do, the facts that have fallen under his observation; in\r\nthe _second_, he has to interpret the facts he has himself observed, or\r\nto give his opinion on facts noticed by others. In stating his opinion,\r\na medical witness must be prepared to back up his opinion by such\r\nreasons as may be satisfactory to the understanding of his hearers,\r\n“and this is the principal qualification of a medical witness, that\r\nhe make himself _intelligible to ordinary comprehensions_.” No man is\r\nbound to give any testimony by which he may render himself liable to\r\nany criminal prosecution. (See the ruling of Bailie, J., in the case of\r\nMr. George Patmore, tried for the murder of John Scott in a duel.)\r\n\r\nAt the trial, the witness is first examined by the party who calls him:\r\nthis is the examination-in-chief. He is then cross-examined by the\r\nopposite party; and, lastly, re-examined by the former party, when he\r\nis offered the privilege of explaining any discrepancies between his\r\nexamination-in-chief and cross-examination, but he must not introduce\r\nany new matter, for by so doing he renders himself liable to be\r\ncross-examined on it.\r\n\r\n=The Use of Notes.=--All notes should contain a plain statement of the\r\nfacts, and, to render them admissible as evidence, they must be taken\r\n_at the time_, and duly attested. From the notes prepared as before\r\nmentioned a witness may refresh his memory, but they are not accepted\r\nin its place. A witness may not read his notes as evidence, nor may\r\nhe refresh his memory by documents not his own and not produced, but\r\nhe may refresh his memory by looking at a document received from the\r\naccused at the time of the offence, and kept by him (Geo. Wilson, jun.,\r\nAberdeen, May 1, 1861; 4 Irv. 42).\r\n\r\n=The Use of Books.=--No witness is allowed to quote from books, or\r\nto quote the opinion of other medical men on the subject, but he\r\nmay refer to facts. Sir Henry Littlejohn, in his papers on Medical\r\nJurisprudence,[2] gives some useful hints on this subject. It appears\r\nthat a medical witness, in an unguarded moment, stated that his opinion\r\nwas corroborated by a distinguished member of the medical profession\r\nnot engaged on the trial. The judge informed the witness that it was\r\nmost irregular to have other medical men present at the dissection than\r\nthose mentioned in the warrant, and that, if the witness did not feel\r\nqualified for conducting such dissections, he had better resign the\r\npost of medical inspector.\r\n\r\n[2] _Edinburgh Medical Journal_, February 1876.\r\n\r\nIn England, at the request of both parties, the medical and scientific\r\nwitnesses may be excluded from the Court, but as a general rule they\r\nare allowed to be in Court, and hear the whole of the evidence of\r\nthe case. In Scotland they are always excluded, although, by mutual\r\nconsent, “experts” may remain to hear the general evidence on which\r\nthey are to express their opinions, but when an expert is giving his\r\nopinion the others must leave the Court. In the latter country also, a\r\nmedical witness who has been in Court cannot be examined on the facts\r\nof the case, but only on matters of opinion. A medical man is, however,\r\nsometimes allowed, on a special motion, to remain, although he is to\r\nbe examined as to facts, and withdrawn when other witnesses are to\r\nbe examined as to facts to which he is to speak. (See case of E. W.\r\nPritchard, H.C. 1865; 5 Irv. 88.)\r\n\r\nIn giving evidence the witness should--(1) Speak loudly and distinctly.\r\n(2) Answer questions categorically--Yes or no. (3) Never use\r\nsuperlatives. (4) Give answers irrespective of results of trial. (5)\r\nExpress no opinion as to guilt of prisoner; state facts only. (6)\r\nAvoid using technical terms. (7) Avoid long discussions, especially\r\ntheoretical arguments.\r\n\r\nWhen a quotation is made from a book by the examining counsel, the\r\nmedical witness, before replying to a question based on it, should see\r\nthat the quotation has been fairly and fully given, due regard being\r\npaid to the context. Neglect of this precaution may lead him into\r\nconsiderable difficulty.\r\n\r\nA medical witness should remember that he is not retained for a party,\r\nbut in the cause of justice. He must, therefore, be candid in his\r\nmanner and simple in his language. Mr. Haslam remarks that, however\r\ndexterous a witness may show himself in fencing with the advocate, he\r\nshould be aware that his evidence ought to impress the judge, and be\r\nconvincing to the jury. Their belief must be the test by which his\r\nscientific opinion is to be established. That which may be deemed by\r\nthe medical evidence clear and unequivocal, may not impress the judge,\r\nnor carry conviction to the jury.\r\n\r\nThe advice given by Sir W. Blizard may not be out of place here: “Be\r\nthe plainest man in the world in a Court of Justice; never harbour a\r\nthought that if you do not appear positive, you must appear little\r\nand mean for ever after; many old practitioners have erred in this\r\nrespect. Give your evidence in as concise, plain, and yet clear manner\r\nas possible; be intelligent, candid, open, and just, never aiming at\r\nappearing unnecessarily scientific. State all the sources by which\r\nyou have gained your information. If you can, make your evidence a\r\nself-evident truth: thus, though the Court may at the time have too\r\ngood or too mean an opinion of your judgment, yet they must deem you an\r\nhonest man. Never, then, be dogmatic, or set yourself up for judge and\r\njury; take no side whatever, be impartial, and you will be honest. In\r\nCourts of Judicature you will frequently hear the counsellors complain\r\nwhen a surgeon gives his opinion with any of the least kind of doubt,\r\nthat he does not speak clearly; but if he is loud and positive, if he\r\nis technical and dogmatic, then he is allowed to be clear and right. I\r\nam sorry to have to observe that this is too frequently the case.”\r\n\r\n=Liability of Medical Men to reveal Professional Secrets.=--The\r\nquestion has arisen how far a medical man is bound to reveal the\r\nsecrets confided to him in his professional capacity as medical\r\nattendant. This question was raised by Mr. Cæsar Hawkins in the trial\r\nof the Duchess of Kingston (11 Harg. St. Tri. 243), before the House\r\nof Peers, and decided by Lord Mansfield thus: “Mr. Hawkins will\r\nunderstand that it is your (the other Peers) judgment and opinion that\r\na surgeon has no privilege, where it is a material question in a civil\r\nor criminal course to know whether parties were married or whether a\r\nchild was born, to say that his introduction to the parties was in the\r\ncourse of his profession, and in that way he came to the knowledge of\r\nit. I take it for granted, that if Mr. Hawkins understands that, it is\r\na satisfaction to him and a clear justification to all the world. If a\r\nsurgeon was voluntarily to reveal these secrets, to be sure he would be\r\nguilty of a breach of honour, and of great indiscretion; but, to give\r\nthat information in a Court of Justice, which, by the law of the land,\r\nhe is bound to do, will never be imputed to him as any indiscretion\r\nwhatever.” However objectionable it may be to the medical witness, and\r\nbe considered by him a breach of professional confidence, to reveal in\r\na Court of Law secrets known but to himself and patient, and regarded\r\nas sacred, he has no privilege but to reveal them if demanded as\r\nevidence, unless the evidence be such as might incriminate himself.\r\nThis is not the ruling in most Continental countries, where the medical\r\nman claims the same privileges of secrecy as the priest in confessional.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. EXPERIMENTAL\r\n\r\nUnder this head will be treated Identity and the examination of\r\nthe Living and the Dead, Real and Apparent Death, Cause of Death,\r\nExhumations, and Autopsies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentity\r\n\r\nExamination of the Living.--With regard to the identification of the\r\nliving, the presence of a medical man is seldom required, but there are\r\nmany occasions when his opinion may be sought. Thus, under the Factory\r\nActs, he may have to examine children about whose age doubts may have\r\narisen. The Table on p. 33, giving the periods at which the teeth\r\nappear, will assist him. A medical man may also be requested to give an\r\nopinion as to the mental soundness or unsoundness of an individual. He\r\nmay also be consulted in cases where questions have arisen as to the\r\nexistence and character of certain marks on the body--of deformities,\r\neither congenital or produced subsequent to birth, or of doubtful sex.\r\nThe marks which most frequently give rise to differences of opinion are\r\n_nævi materni_, _scars_, and _tattoo marks_. In cases of doubtful sex,\r\nthe male organs may resemble the female, the female the male, or they\r\nmay be blended together in about equal proportions.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where an examination of a living person is required, the\r\nconsent of the person must be obtained, the nature of the examination\r\nexplained, and that any facts recorded will be used as evidence if\r\nrequired. If the person refuse to be examined then it must not be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nCicatrices.--The following questions may be put to the medical\r\nexpert--(1) Do scars ever disappear? (2) Can the age of a scar be\r\ndefinitely stated?\r\n\r\nIn reply to the first and second questions, I shall quote the words\r\nof the late Professor Casper: “Consequently the scars occasioned by\r\nactual loss of substance, or by a wound healed by granulation, never\r\ndisappear, and are always to be seen upon the body; but the scars of\r\nleech bites, or lancet wounds, or of cupping instruments, may disappear\r\nafter a lapse of time that cannot be more distinctly specified, and may\r\ntherefore cease to be visible upon the body. It is extremely difficult,\r\nor impossible, to give any certain or positive opinion as to the age of\r\na scar.”\r\n\r\nAll cicatrices should be examined with oblique light and the aid of\r\na lens. In the early stages a cicatrix is of a red colour, changes\r\nto brown, and later to white, and the surface glistens. In the\r\nintermediate stages one could not give any positive evidence of the age\r\nof a cicatrix. The probability is that a red cicatrix is a recent one,\r\na white cicatrix is not recent.\r\n\r\nI have seen well-defined cicatrices upon the back of a Russian, after\r\nincisions made by the blades of a cupping instrument fourteen years\r\npreviously, and in an Englishman after twenty-five years (R. J. M.\r\nBuchanan).\r\n\r\nDevergie states that where the brand of a galley-slave has vanished,\r\nit may be recalled by slapping its usual position with the palm of the\r\nhand. The scar remains white, while the skin round it is reddened. A\r\nchange of temperature to the part will sometimes cause the reappearance\r\nof a vanished scar. Washing may also help to reproduce scars.\r\nCicatrices produced in childhood may grow with the ordinary growth of\r\nthe individual. The shape of a cicatrix will depend upon the character\r\nof the wound which produced it; on the nature of the healing process;\r\non the elasticity or tension of the skin; on the convexity of the part;\r\nand on the looseness of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. An incised\r\nwound healing by the “first intention” will most probably leave a white\r\nlinear cicatrix; on the other hand, a wound healing by granulation will\r\nleave a more or less irregular scar. The position of a wound on the\r\nbody also modifies the subsequent cicatrix; thus a linear cicatrix is\r\nproduced when the wound is in the long diameter of the limb, a more\r\nor less oval one when across the limb. The retraction of the skin in\r\nthe latter case tends to draw the skin at right angles to the line of\r\nincision, thus approximating the extremities of the cut, increasing\r\nit in breadth and lessening it in length. Owing to one or more of the\r\nabove-mentioned conditions the typical cicatrix of an incised wound\r\nis elliptical, tending, however, in some cases to assume a circular\r\nform. Linear cicatrices are found chiefly between the fingers and\r\ntoes, and where the cutaneous surfaces are concave. In gunshot wounds\r\nthe resulting cicatrix is depressed and disc-shaped, and more or less\r\nadherent in the centre to the subcutaneous tissues, and if the weapon\r\nbe fired close to the surface of the body, grains of unburnt powder\r\nmay be seen in the surrounding skin. Cicatrices from burns are, as a\r\nrule, large, irregular, and superficial, and frequently give rise to\r\ndeformity. A scar left by caustics is circumscribed, deep and depressed\r\nin the centre. Cicatrices in the groins are probably venereal; those in\r\nthe neck and under the jaw, strumous. Scars from operation incisions\r\nare much less evident now than when wounds were more likely to\r\nsuppurate and heal by granulation. It is remarkable, after an incision\r\nmade with aseptic precautions and healing by first intent, as time\r\nprogresses the cicatrix becomes less and less noticeable, but they\r\ncan be detected by methods described above. Fine punctures and stitch\r\ncicatrices may eventually leave little or no trace.\r\n\r\nDupuytren and Delpech state that the tissue formed in a cicatrix is\r\nnever converted into true skin--the _rete mucosum_ when once destroyed\r\nnever being re-formed. It contains no sebaceous glands, sweat glands,\r\nor hair follicles, and is but slightly vascular. This may account\r\nfor the white colour of ordinary cicatrices, but even to this rule\r\nexceptions may be taken, and dark brown patches of pigment have\r\nbeen known to mark the situation of old lacerated wounds. It must\r\nbe remembered also that in irregular wounds and in incised wounds\r\nwhich may heal with an uneven joint, that portions of skin may become\r\nembedded or grow into the scar tissue and give rise to difficulty in\r\nforming an opinion. I have seen a well-defined dark coloration of the\r\nskin continue for three months after the application of a mustard\r\nplaster, followed at the time by desquamation.\r\n\r\nTattoo Marks.--With regard to tattoo marks, the question of their\r\ndisappearance gave rise to considerable discussion in the celebrated\r\nTichborne case. On this subject the experiments of Hutin, Tardieu,\r\nand Casper appear to point to the fact “_that tattoo marks may become\r\nperfectly effaced during life_,” but that after death the colouring\r\nmatter with which the marks were made may be found in the lymphatic\r\nglands. This is especially the case when vermilion is used. The most\r\npermanent marks are made with Indian ink, powdered charcoal, gunpowder,\r\nwashing blue or ink, and vermilion. These are given in the order of\r\ntheir permanency. Hutin found that in 506 men who had been formerly\r\ntattooed, the marks had disappeared from 47 of the number. Not only\r\ndoes permanency depend upon the colouring matter used, but also upon\r\nthe depth to which it has penetrated. If superficial, it may gradually\r\nbecome effaced. If the material be carried down to the papillæ, it will\r\nremain permanent, and can only be removed in such a way as to leave a\r\nscar. But besides the spontaneous disappearance of tattoo marks from\r\nthe lapse of time, these marks may be artificially removed, and in such\r\na manner as to prevent the possibility of a definite opinion being\r\ngiven as to their primary character. The presence of a scar in the\r\nsituation of a well-known tattoo mark is suspicious. Thus, the Claimant\r\nhad a scar on a part where it was sworn that Arthur Orton had been\r\ntattooed. The application of strong acetic acid, potash, hydrochloric\r\nacid and glycerole of papain appears to be the means adopted for the\r\nremoval of tattoo marks. Efforts are made to remove superficial tattoo\r\nmarks by removing the particles with needles. Tattoo marks according to\r\ntheir position and design are useful evidence of identification.\r\n\r\nBirth Marks.--The presence and characters of birth marks should be\r\nnoted for purposes of identification. Their removal may be possible,\r\nbut, except in such as are small and superficial, the process used\r\nfor removal leaves traces behind in the form of cicatrices or\r\nirregularities of surface, which may generally be detected in oblique\r\nlight and with the aid of a good lens. Large moles or _nævi_ may he\r\nexcised, but a cicatrix will remain, which will differ in shape from\r\nthe original mark.\r\n\r\nCongenital Deformities.--These offer no difficulty and are in many\r\ncases permanent, such as intra-uterine amputations, constrictions,\r\nabnormality of limbs, &c. Such conditions as hare-lip, cleft-palate,\r\nherniæ;, &c., may be altered by surgical procedure, but leave permanent\r\nrecords of this. Peculiarities in twins are interesting as to their\r\nbeing of the “mirror image” or “identical” type.\r\n\r\nAnthropometry.--This is principally used for the identity of habitual\r\ncriminals. The Bertillon method is based upon certain measurements of\r\nthe body, the principal of which are (1) the length of the head, (2)\r\nwidth of head, (3) length of body, (4) length of trunk while sitting,\r\n(5) distance between tips of mid-fingers with arms outstretched, (6)\r\nlength of left forearm, left middle finger, and left foot, (7) length\r\nand width of right ear, (8) colour of irides. These measurements place\r\nthe person in one or other class, according to the special system of\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--First line (from left to right), plain\r\nimpressions of whorl (thumb), arch (second finger), radial loop\r\n(forefinger).\r\n\r\nSecond line, rolled impressions of whorl (thumb), ulnar loop (fourth\r\nfinger).]\r\n\r\nFinger Prints.--These are largely used as a means of identification\r\nin criminal cases, either by prints left upon articles, or by\r\nprints definitely made by the police authorities as a record for\r\nidentification purposes.\r\n\r\nOn articles, the finger prints may be rendered more visible by dusting\r\nwith some finely powdered material of dark colour which will adhere to\r\nthe impression, which may then be photographed and enlarged.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of record, the impressions are taken directly upon a\r\nsuitable surface of the bulbs of the fingers and thumbs after having\r\ncoated them with printer‘s ink. The impressions thus made show\r\nindividual peculiarities in the distribution and arrangement of the\r\nridges of the skin; and the chances of the markings of two individuals\r\nbeing alike is about one in sixty-four millions. By means of the\r\npattern of these ridges, prints may be classified under the headings\r\nof arches, whorls, and loops, with certain recognised modifications of\r\nthese. (See Figs. 1 and 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--First line (from left to right), plain\r\nimpressions of whorl (forefinger), ulnar loop (thumb), arch (second\r\nfinger).\r\n\r\nSecond line, rolled impressions of whorl (thumb), ulnar loop (third\r\nfinger).]\r\n\r\nEyes and Veins.--The angle of the eyes to the middle line of the face\r\nis an aid to identity; this will show whether the equator of the eye\r\nis on a plane at a right angle to the middle line, or above or below\r\nit. Tamassia lays much stress upon the arrangement of the veins on the\r\nback of the hands, which is an individual characteristic and one which\r\nis not easily altered or likely to be. By compressing the arms with a\r\nligature the veins are made to stand out in relief and the backs of the\r\nhands are photographed.\r\n\r\nOther Peculiarities.--The identity of the accused may be further\r\nproved by the absence or malformation of the =teeth= corresponding\r\nwith a bite on the party assaulted, or the impression of the teeth on\r\nsoft articles like cheese. Peculiarities of dentistry may be useful\r\nin identification. Or it may be proved that the wound inflicted could\r\nonly have been made by a left-handed person, or in a manner peculiar to\r\nthose engaged in the slaughtering of animals--_e.g._ is the cut from\r\nwithin outwards, as employed by butchers? The correspondence in the\r\nsize and peculiarities of the foot of the prisoner and the =footprints=\r\nfound in the vicinity of the crime is important as evidence. There\r\nis considerable difference of opinion as to the size of a footprint\r\non the ground, Mascar of Belgium asserting that it is _smaller_ than\r\nthe foot that made it, Caussè, on the contrary, that it is usually\r\n_larger_. It should be borne in mind that the size of the footprint\r\nvaries in running, walking, and standing, being smallest in running\r\nand largest when the individual is standing, which may account for the\r\ndifference of opinion of the two observers just mentioned. This fact\r\nshould always be borne in mind when an examination is required to be\r\nmade of the footprints in the neighbourhood of the crime. A mark in the\r\nfootprint showing that the sole of the boot had been patched, or in\r\nthe case of the naked foot that there was some deformity of the toes,\r\nwould of necessity be important. The mark of the naked foot smeared\r\nwith blood has, in several cases, led to the identification of the\r\nculprit. Photographs may be used as a means of identification. Casts of\r\nfootprints may be taken by smearing the print carefully with oil, and\r\npouring in liquid plaster of Paris, or by dusting it over with powdered\r\nparaffin wax, and then melting it by holding a hot iron over the print;\r\nthis may be repeated until a sufficiently thick cast is obtained. Hot\r\nsolution of gelatine in water, mixed with oxide of zinc and glycerine\r\nto the requisite consistence, may be used for the purpose.\r\n\r\nDyeing of Hair.--As a means of disguise the hair may be dyed, or the\r\ncolour may be changed from dark to light. For darkening the hair,\r\npreparations containing permanganate of potash, or the acetate of lead,\r\nbismuth, or nitrate of silver, are most frequently employed. Sticks of\r\nnitrate of silver or lunar caustic are used for darkening eyebrows and\r\nmoustachios. A wash containing sulphide of potassium is used before\r\nthe application of the lead solution. This removes the grease, and\r\nhelps the rapid formation of the black sulphide of lead. Preparations\r\nof henna are fashionable for the production of shades of copper to\r\nrich brown. To detect fraud, some of the suspected hair should be\r\nsteeped in dilute nitric acid, the acid driven off by gentle heat,\r\nand the nitrate dissolved in distilled water, and then sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen passed through the solution, the result being the formation\r\nof the black sulphide of lead. If silver be present, the addition of\r\nhydrochloric acid will throw down the insoluble chloride of silver. If\r\ncareful examination be made of dyed hair, it will be found that the dye\r\nis irregularly taken by the hair; the hair loses lustre, and I have\r\nnot unfrequently seen the hair close to the scalp white, or at least\r\nseveral shades lighter than the rest. The scalp may also be seen more\r\nor less discoloured, especially when nitrate of silver is used and\r\napplied by the individual himself.\r\n\r\nFor lightening the natural colour, solutions of chlorine, of peroxide\r\nof hydrogen, nitric and nitro-hydrochloric acids, of varying strengths,\r\nare used. It must be remembered that the action of chlorine is by no\r\nmeans uniform. The hair retains the odour of chlorine for some time,\r\neven after repeated washing, and is hard, stiff, and brittle. Devergie\r\nstates that he has not succeeded in producing a perfect whitening of\r\nthe hair in less than from twelve to twenty hours. It must be borne in\r\nmind that, under certain circumstances, dark hair may become suddenly\r\nwhite. I have seen large patches of grey hair over the head, the result\r\nof repeated attacks of neuralgia.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of persons whose hair is alleged to have been\r\ndyed, it is necessary to compare the dyed hair with that from other\r\nparts of the body, _e.g._ the pubes, or axilla, to wait and watch for\r\nirregularities of colour as the hair grows, new growth being free from\r\ndye, and if necessary to shave the part and compare the new growth with\r\nother hair, also to examine carefully the skin in the position where\r\nthe dye has been applied. In one case which I noted, a man had been in\r\nthe habit of touching the moustachios and eyebrows with lunar caustic,\r\nhaving previously damped it with his tongue; in time it produced\r\nargyria which coloured the whole of his face, the body generally, but\r\nmost noticeable on the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Photo-micrograph of transverse section of\r\nnormal hair follicle, × 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nExamination of a Person said to have been Assaulted\r\n\r\nCarefully examine the bruises, wounds, &c., to see if they could have\r\nbeen inflicted as described. Ask no questions that may suggest an\r\nanswer. Examine all weapons said to have been used, and hand them over\r\nto the police. In all cases where danger to life is imminent, send\r\nfor the Authorities, and take dying declarations, as these may become\r\nevidence of vast importance, and, if properly taken, are as valid as if\r\ngiven on oath.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentity of the Dead\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been said under the heading of identity of the living\r\nis applicable in examinations to establish identity of the dead.\r\nThe latter requires certain special details of examination owing to\r\nthe peculiar circumstances which may be present demanding them. The\r\nmaterial subject to examination may be incomplete, and difficulties\r\narise, so that it is essential to record every minute detail which may\r\nbe of value as evidence.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of examination under this heading are mainly related to\r\nthe questions of stature, age, sex, and special peculiarities of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful here to emphasize the importance of making a detailed\r\nexamination of the body. The examination, particularly the external\r\ninspection, should be made in daylight.\r\n\r\nIf the body be seen where first discovered, note should be taken of the\r\nexact position and attitude, of any signs of a struggle, of footprints\r\nto or from the body; of bottles, medicines, vomit, or excreta near\r\nthe body, and which should be collected and retained. The expression\r\nand colour of the face, the condition of the hands, the condition of\r\nthe dress as to tears and stains, the heat, amount of rigidity or\r\nputrefaction, the presence of wounds and vital reaction in them.\r\n\r\nIf the body has been removed from the place where found, make similar\r\nnotes, remove the clothes, and compare any cuts if present in the\r\nclothes with those on the body. Record for identification--nævi, moles,\r\ntattoos, scars, hare-lip, cleft-palate, the mammæ, abnormalities of\r\nfingers, teeth, bones, limbs, joints, &c.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the mouth, for the presence or absence of false\r\nteeth, or of any peculiar formation of the jaw, may lead to the\r\nidentification of the body. In the case of Dr. Parkman, the\r\nrecognition by a dentist of the false teeth worn by the deceased led\r\nto identification of the remains, and also to the discovery of his\r\nmurderer. The presence of an ununited fracture, as in the case of\r\nLivingstone, may lead to the identification of the body. In one case\r\nwhere a man was said to have died from a fracture of the ribs recently\r\ncaused by a blow, it was found on examination that the bones were\r\nunited by a firm callus, clearly showing that the skeleton produced\r\ncould not be that of the man alleged to have been murdered.\r\n\r\nRecord the height and if possible the weight. Note the sex, the\r\nprobable age, nutrition, and cleanliness or otherwise. Examine all\r\nwounds, bruises, and describe them carefully, and marks, _e.g._\r\nstrangulation or throttling. Examine the hands carefully and describe\r\ntheir peculiarities, also the colour of hair and eyes. Examine all the\r\napertures of the body for foreign bodies, or abnormal conditions, and,\r\nin females, record carefully the condition of the external genitalia\r\nand the presence or absence of the hymen.\r\n\r\nAlthough a more detailed account of the method of carrying out\r\npost-mortem examinations is given later on, it will not be out of place\r\nhere to point out briefly the steps of examination. I would again\r\nemphasize the importance of making a thorough and complete internal\r\nexamination, leaving no organ unexamined. If there be no call for\r\nspecial examination of the thorax or abdomen first, commence with\r\nthe examination of the surface of the brain, then proceed downwards.\r\nNote the direction of any wounds and their depth. Examine all organs\r\nfor morbid changes, and in females, the vagina and uterus. Examine\r\nthe larynx and œsophagus. Remove injured bones and examine joints.\r\nRemove the spinal cord. Always remember to note the contents of the\r\nstomach and bladder in reference to the period at which death may\r\nhave occurred. Weigh all organs. Always remember the probability of\r\npoisoning, and make your examination accordingly.\r\n\r\nAll fragments or injured parts of a body or its organs should be\r\npreserved, and photographs taken of them.\r\n\r\nIt is better for two medical men to conduct the examination together.\r\nDo not make the examination without an order from the coroner. A\r\nmedical man who is alleged as implicated in the cause of death should\r\nnot be present.\r\n\r\nIdentification of the dead may present special difficulties where\r\nmutilation of the body has taken place, or where the body has been\r\nseverely burnt, or is disfigured as in cases of explosions or advanced\r\nputrefaction. In such cases, fragments of clothes, ornaments, and\r\ndental work may afford valuable evidence.\r\n\r\nOccupation Marks.--As an aid to identification, it is important to\r\nremember that certain trades leave marks by which those engaged in them\r\nmay be identified.\r\n\r\nThus, in shoemakers there may be more or less depression of the lower\r\nportion of the sternum, due to constant pressure of the last against\r\nthe bone.\r\n\r\nTailors work sitting, with the legs crossed and the body bent forward.\r\nThe body is thus cramped, and the abdomen drawn in, and the thorax\r\nprojects over it, due to the manner of sitting. They frequently have a\r\nsoft red tumour on the external malleolus. A like tumour, but not so\r\nlarge, may also be found on the external edge of the foot, and a corn\r\non the little toe.\r\n\r\nPhotographers have their fingers blackened by nitrate of silver,\r\npyrogallic acid and other developers, or stained yellow with bichromate\r\nof potash.\r\n\r\nSeamstresses have the index finger of the left hand roughened by the\r\nconstant pricking of the needle.\r\n\r\nCopyists have on the little finger of the right hand, near its\r\nextremity, a corn, and at the end of the middle finger a hard groove\r\nmade by the pen.\r\n\r\nViolinists have corns on the tips of the fingers of the left hand,\r\nharpists on both hands.\r\n\r\nIn smokers of pipes the incisors and canines are more or less worn by\r\nthe mouthpiece, but sometimes the groove is between the canines and\r\nbicuspids. In cigarette smokers, the forefinger and thumb are stained\r\nwith tobacco juice, also between the index and middle fingers, on the\r\ndorsum.\r\n\r\nIn coachmen, corns may be formed between the thumb and index finger,\r\nand between the index and the second finger of the left hand, from the\r\npressure of the reins, and between the thumb and index finger of the\r\nright hand, from the pressure of the whip.\r\n\r\nIn bricklayers, from the constant action of picking up bricks, the\r\nflattening of the tip of the thumb and index finger of the left hand is\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\nPlasterers have corns on the external surfaces of the thumb and index\r\nfinger, due to grasping the “hawk” on which the plaster is placed\r\nduring their work.\r\n\r\nJoiners and carpenters have callosities on the palm of the right hand\r\nfrom grasping their tools, and between the thumb and index finger of\r\nthe right hand, also over the first interphalangeal joint of the right\r\nindex finger. The right shoulder is lower than the left.\r\n\r\nThe finger-ends of turners and coppersmiths are also more or less\r\nflattened; in the latter, a deposit of the metal may take place.\r\n\r\n=To ascertain the time which may have elapsed since death.=--This can\r\nscarcely be determined with precision, as so much depends upon the\r\nconditions under which the body may have been placed. The subject\r\nunder consideration is, therefore, beset with difficulties, and its\r\nelucidation will require the greatest care on the part of the medical\r\nexpert. A careful attention, however, to the subjects treated in the\r\nfollowing pages will help to clear up many a doubtful point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOLING OF THE BODY\r\n\r\n                         { Covered by bed-clothes, or otherwise\r\n    (1) External         { unexposed, when cooling will be dry\r\n         circumstances.  { slower than in cold air quickly moving.\r\n\r\n    (2) Condition of the }\r\n          body itself.   } Slow, if fat.\r\n\r\n                         { 1. Wasting diseases. Quick.\r\n                         { 2. Suffocation. Slow.\r\n    (3) Kind of death.   { 3. Cholera, yellow fever,     } Increase\r\n                         {    rheumatic fever, and       } of heat\r\n                              cerebro-spinal meningitis. } after death.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstances must also be taken into consideration:\r\n(1) Age. (2) Air--(_a_) moving; and (_b_) at rest. (3) Moisture. (4)\r\nWarmth. (5) Nature of the supposed cause of death, as affecting cooling\r\nof the body, and promoting the rapid advance of putrefaction. (6)\r\nPresence or absence of the _rigor mortis_. Bodies may be preserved for\r\nmonths if exposed to intense cold.\r\n\r\nThe following Table, compiled from the experiments of Devergie, may\r\nbe of use in aiding the expert to form his opinion, but it must be\r\nborne in mind that, from the great difficulties which surround the\r\nsubject, the statements made are only approximately correct. The table\r\nis divided into four stages or periods, the last being that in which\r\nputrefaction commences:--\r\n\r\n    First.--_From a few minutes to twenty hours after\r\n          death_--Animal heat more or less present, but seldom\r\n          continuing longer than ten or twelve hours. Muscles\r\n          contract on the application of galvanic stimuli, and\r\n          in the earlier stage to blows.\r\n\r\n    Second.--_From ten hours to three days_--Body quite cold and\r\n          _rigor mortis_ well marked; muscles do not contract on\r\n          the application of stimuli. The age, mode of death,\r\n          and other collateral circumstances must, more or less,\r\n          be taken into consideration before an opinion can be\r\n          given.\r\n\r\n    Third.--_From three to eight days_--The body is quite cold,\r\n          and cadaveric rigidity has passed off. The muscles no\r\n          longer respond to any galvanic or mechanical stimulus.\r\n          The stage is modified and somewhat shortened in summer.\r\n\r\n    Fourth.--_From six to twelve days_--Commencement of\r\n          putrefaction. Putrefaction may, however, take place\r\n          on the first or second day after death; so that, as\r\n          before stated, care must be taken before any positive\r\n          decision can be given.\r\n\r\nStature.--As a general rule the length of the body is equal to\r\nthe distance between the tips of the middle fingers with the arms\r\noutstretched. If an arm be missing, the length of the remaining one\r\nmultiplied by two, with the addition of 6 inches for each clavicle\r\nand 1½ inches for the width of the sternum, will give the approximate\r\nheight. The femur is said to be equal to .275 of the body height. If\r\nthe skeleton be entire, the addition of 1½ inches for the soft parts\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\nWhere only a limb or long bone or part of one be available, it is not\r\npossible to give anything more than an approximate opinion of the\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nSex.--When mutilation, putrefaction, or charring has taken place,\r\nby which the genitalia have been demolished, it may be difficult to\r\ndetermine the sex. Evidence will be afforded by the distribution of the\r\npubic hair, which in the male reaches as high as the umbilicus, but is\r\nhorizontal with few exceptions in the female. Males have more hair on\r\nthe body generally.\r\n\r\nThe presence of moustachios and beard and the length of the hair on the\r\nhead will assist in sex determination.\r\n\r\nThe breasts if present will denote the sex, also the uterus, which\r\nwithstands putrefaction and burning to a marked degree.\r\n\r\nRemains of clothing and ornaments will indicate the sex of the wearer.\r\n\r\nLineæ albicantes on the abdomen, buttocks, and breasts indicate the\r\nfemale sex, and the probable occurrence of previous pregnancies. It\r\nmust, however, be remembered that lineæ albicantes occur in males who\r\nhave been stout or had the abdomen distended by disease.\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton in Relation to Identification.--When a complete skeleton\r\nis submitted for examination, the chief points to elucidate are the age\r\nand sex. These will be noted further on. It may happen that a single\r\nbone, separate bones, or only a part of one is obtainable, when there\r\nmay be considerable difficulty in expressing a definite opinion. The\r\nquestions to be answered are: Are they human or belonging to the lower\r\nanimals? When the bones are entire the answer is not very difficult to\r\nsettle; but when parts of bones have to be dealt with, one has to be\r\nvery careful in forming conclusions, and the fragments may have to be\r\nsubmitted, to a skilled anatomist. One may not be able to express an\r\nopinion about bones of the lower animals, other than to state they are\r\nnot human. The services of a skilled Comparative Osteologist may be\r\nnecessary to decide the nature of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhen fragments resembling bone have to be examined, the microscope\r\nwill be necessary to determine their osseous structure. When several\r\nbones have to be examined it may be possible to build up part or the\r\nwhole of a skeleton. Duplicate bones will indicate remains of more than\r\none creature. All fragments and bones should be carefully described,\r\nmeasured, and photographed.\r\n\r\nBy the character of the bones one may be able to determine the sex to\r\nwhich they belong and the approximate age. As a general rule the bones\r\nof the female are smaller, lighter, and less marked by muscular and\r\nother attachments.\r\n\r\nThe thorax in the female is deeper than in the male, the sternum\r\nshorter and more convex, the ensiform cartilage thinner and ossified\r\nlater in life. The cartilages of the ribs are larger and the ribs\r\nsmaller than in the male. The ribs are more oblique and may show the\r\nresults of long corset pressure. The body of the sternum is over twice\r\nthe length of the manubrium in the male, less than this in the female.\r\n\r\nThe length of the twelfth rib in the male averages 103 mm., in the\r\nfemale 83.8 mm. The pelvis exhibits marked differences. The sacrum of\r\nthe male is more curved than that of the female, which is straighter in\r\nthe upper half and more curved in the lower. The male pelvis is more\r\ncompact, deeper, rougher, and narrower. The pubic angle is smaller, the\r\nobturator foramen is oval, and the ischia incurved. The female pelvis\r\nis more open, shallower, wider, not so rough, a wider pubic angle, and\r\nshallower and broader symphysis, the ischia are everted, wider apart\r\nand flatter, and the obturator foramen triangular. The inlet of the\r\nfemale pelvis is greater in all its diameters.\r\n\r\nThe skull in the male is heavier and larger, the markings and ridges\r\nbeing more pronounced, the mastoid processes, occipital protuberance,\r\nzygomatic and superciliary ridges are more prominent, and the capacity\r\ngreater than in the female.\r\n\r\nIn the female the jaw is less prominent and has a wider angle.\r\n\r\nThe lumbar curve is longer in the female, and the lumbo-sacral angle\r\ngreater than in the male.\r\n\r\nThe angle made by the neck of the femur with the shaft is about a right\r\nangle in the female, more obtuse in the male. It must be remembered\r\nthat these differences between the sexes are not present to the same\r\ndegree before puberty, so that prior to it the examination offers\r\nlittle evidence as to sex.\r\n\r\nWhen examining bones any injuries to their structure or other\r\nabnormalities should be noted. The skull must be carefully examined\r\nfor fractures, especially the base, which may be easily overlooked.\r\nInjuries to vertebræ should be looked for. The presence of callus will\r\nindicate that fracture has occurred at a period before death long\r\nenough for its formation.\r\n\r\nAge.--There are several data which enable one to form a fairly accurate\r\nopinion as to the age of a body, these are especially useful in earlier\r\nyears and intra-uterine life.\r\n\r\nThe more general are the size, height, development, the presence or\r\nabsence of signs of puberty, the state of dentition, the greyness of\r\nthe hair; in the female the atrophic condition of the uterus after the\r\nmenopause, and the character of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nIn addition are the time of life at which centres of ossification\r\nappear and the union of epiphyses to the shafts of bones and bones with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn intra-uterine life centres of ossification appear by the end of the\r\nsixth month in the os calcis, manubrium, and the bodies and laminas of\r\nthe sacral vertebræ; by the seventh, in the first piece of the body of\r\nthe sternum and the astragalus; by the eighth, in the second piece of\r\nthe body of the sternum; at full term in the cuboid, third piece of the\r\nsternal body, first coccygeal vertebra, and the lower epiphysis of the\r\nfemur.\r\n\r\nAll traces of the fontanelles have disappeared by the end of the\r\nfourth year. The angle of the jaw in infants and young children is\r\nobtuse; as dentition proceeds, the body becomes deeper and the angle\r\nalters so that towards adult life it approaches a right angle, the\r\nramus is longer and the body has become well developed with a mental\r\nforamen midway between upper and lower borders. In the new-born, the\r\nmental foramen is low down as the body of the jaw is practically all\r\nalveolar. In old people the angle again becomes obtuse and the alveolus\r\ndisappears as the teeth are shed, and the mental foramen is at the\r\nupper border.\r\n\r\n          Table of the Eruption of the Teeth\r\n\r\n    Age--Eruption of teeth.\r\n         Lower central incisors,    7 months. }\r\n         Upper    “       “         8   “     }\r\n            “  lateral incisors, 7-10   “     }\r\n         Lower    “       “     10-12   “     } Temporary.\r\n         First molars,          12-14   “     }\r\n         Canine teeth,             18   “     }\r\n         Second molars,         22-24   “     }\r\n\r\n         First molars,              6 years.  }\r\n         Middle incisors,           7   “     }\r\n         Lateral incisors,          8   “     }\r\n         First bicuspids,           9   “     }\r\n         Second bicuspids,         10   “     } Permanent.\r\n         Canines,               11-12   “     }\r\n         Second molars,         12-13   “     }\r\n         Wisdom teeth,          18-25   “     }\r\n\r\n         Examine the lower jaw.

Sudden arrest of the action\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nThis condition may be brought about by\r\n\r\n    1. Deficiency of blood due to hæmorrhage--_death by anæmia_.\r\n    2. Effect of certain diseases and poisons, &c.--_death by asthenia_.\r\n\r\nCauses--_Heart Disease._--Aortic regurgitation, fatty degeneration, &c.\r\n\r\n_Hæmorrhages_ from wounds of blood-vessels or the heart, profuse\r\nhæmoptysis or hæmatemesis, uterine hæmorrhage, bursting of varicose\r\nveins, bursting of aneurysms.\r\n\r\n_Shock._--Emotion; blows on the head or epigastrium; sudden evacuation\r\nof fluids from the body, as in emptying an over-distended bladder,\r\ntapping a hydrocele, ascites, or a pleural effusion. Extensive\r\ninjuries to the body (railway and machinery accidents). Drinking large\r\nquantities of cold water when heated.\r\n\r\n_Exhaustive diseases_, chronic or infective.\r\n\r\nSymptoms.--Pallor of the face and mucous membranes, dimness of vision,\r\ncold perspirations, sense of impending death, restlessness, air hunger\r\nand gasping for breath, nausea, and, maybe, vomiting, noises in the\r\nears, passing delirium, quick, feeble, and fluttering pulse, or the\r\nlatter may be imperceptible at the wrist, insensibility, convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary fainting attacks many of the above symptoms are absent;\r\nsuch as are present are temporary. In collapse, consciousness is\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem Signs.--The cavities of the heart contain a normal quantity\r\nof blood in death by asthenia, but may be almost empty when death\r\nis due to anæmia. The blood in asthenic death is simply arrested in\r\nits course; blood is, therefore, found in the large veins and in the\r\narteries. The brain and the lungs are not engorged with blood.\r\n\r\n=Asphyxia.=--From ἀ priv. et δφνξιϛ, pulse. Apnœa is the better\r\nterm--ἀ priv. et πνεω, I _respire_; but this word is now used by\r\nphysiologists to denote a cessation of the respiratory movements due\r\nto artificially oxygenated blood. Blood in this condition fails to\r\nexcite the respiratory centre in the medulla, and respiration ceases.\r\nTo avoid confusion the term asphyxia had better be retained, especially\r\nas it is most commonly used and generally understood. Asphyxia, or\r\ndeath from defect in the quality of the blood, is brought about when\r\nany impediment is placed on the healthy action of the lungs. Experiment\r\nhas shown that for a short time after respiration has ceased, the\r\nheart still continues to act, and that if the impediment to the proper\r\naeration of the air by the lungs be removed, life may be prolonged.\r\nTaking therefore the primary meaning of the terms asphyxia and apnœa\r\ninto consideration, it may be remarked that the latter precedes the\r\nformer in point of time--asphyxia marking the period at which the\r\naction of the heart ceases, apnœa the cessation of the respiratory\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Asphyxia._--1. Mechanical obstruction to the air passages:\r\nforeign bodies, exudations, tumours, suffocation, strangulation,\r\ndrowning, hanging, spasm of glottis from mechanical irritation, or\r\nirritant gases.\r\n\r\n2. Interference with the action of the respiratory muscles: exhaustion\r\nof the muscles from cold; paralysis of muscles from injury to or\r\ndisease of respiratory centre; poisons acting on the centre; continued\r\npressure on walls of the chest; fixation of muscles from tetanus or\r\nstrychnine poisoning.\r\n\r\n3. Diseases of and injuries to the lungs: pleurisy with effusion, acute\r\npneumonia, empyema, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, pulmonary apoplexy,\r\nembolism of pulmonary artery.\r\n\r\n4. Inhalation of air deficient in oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of Asphyxia._--Divided into three stages. _First stage_:\r\ndeep, frequent, and laboured respiration; the extraordinary muscles\r\nof respiration are called into play. _Second stage_: the inspiratory\r\nmuscles are less active than expiratory, convulsions of nearly all the\r\nmuscles of the body occur. _Third stage_: paralysis of respiratory\r\ncentres, dilated pupils, loss of consciousness, absence of reflexes.\r\nGasping inspirations with prolonged intervals precede dissolution.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Signs._--Engorgement of the pulmonary artery, the right\r\ncavities of the heart, and vent cavæ; but on the left side of the heart\r\nthe cavities, together with the aorta and pulmonary veins, are either\r\nempty or contain but little blood. It must be remembered, however, that\r\ncases of asphyxia do sometimes occur where the cavities on each side of\r\nthe heart are _empty, or nearly so_. This is the case in the syncopal\r\nasphyxia of some writers. If also the obstruction to respiration be\r\nimperfect, the circulation may be continued for some time, congestion\r\nof one or more of the internal organs being the result. The blood\r\nis dark-coloured, contains much CO₂, and the hæmoglobin is almost\r\ncompletely reduced. The blood coagulates slowly.\r\n\r\n=Coma.=--Insensibility ending in death. _Causes._--Concussion of the\r\nbrain, cerebral hæmorrhage, embolism, thrombosis, tumour, depressed\r\nfracture of skull, meningitis, and serous effusions; effects of\r\npoisons such as opium, alcohol, ptomaines, arsenic, barium, oxalic\r\nand carbolic acids; in certain diseases of kidneys and liver, uræmia,\r\ncholæmia, acetonæmia, profound anæmia, _e.g._ pernicious, and as a\r\nterminal stage to acute or chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of Coma._--Coma is generally preceded by stupor, from which\r\nthe patient may be roused to a certain extent, but only temporarily.\r\nThe reflexes in this stage may be exaggerated, and the power of\r\nswallowing fluids may be retained. When coma is present there is\r\ncomplete abolition of consciousness, sweating, the patient is\r\npowerless, the breathing stertorous. The temperature may vary according\r\nto the cause; normal or subnormal generally, it may rise in lesions\r\nof the pons Varolii. The pulse is generally full and bounding, the\r\npupils dilated or contracted and insensitive to light, the conjunctival\r\nreflex absent. Mucus collects in the air-passages and causes “the\r\ndeath rattle,” and the breathing becomes more and more embarrassed and\r\nirregular. The reflexes are lost, and the sphincters relaxed.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Causal lesions are found in the brain or\r\nother organs; there is usually hyperæmia of the brain and spinal cord\r\nand their membranes, unless there be profound anæmia preceding death.\r\nThe condition of the heart and lungs is not constant; the general\r\nappearances resemble those in death from asphyxia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable giving the Diagnosis of Several Forms of Insensibility\r\n\r\nInjury to the Head--_Concussion of the Brain._--The symptoms are very\r\nsimilar to those of shock, with unconsciousness, but it may be possible\r\nto rouse the person. The pupils are equal and dilated or contracted,\r\nand react sluggishly to light. The breathing is shallow and slow with\r\nsighing, the pulse feeble. The muscles are relaxed but not paralysed.\r\nVomiting and involuntary micturition and defæcation may occur. The\r\ntemperature is usually subnormal.\r\n\r\nCerebral Compression.--This, when due to injury, is usually associated\r\nwith fracture of the skull and hæmorrhage. Insensibility is complete,\r\nthe person cannot be roused. The pupils may be unequal, contracted or\r\ndilated, and may not react to light. The breathing is slow, stertorous,\r\nand may be irregular, or Cheyne-Stokes in type. The pulse is full\r\nand bounding, the cheeks are blown out during expiration. Paralysis,\r\nrigidity, or convulsions may be present on one side of the body. There\r\nmay be retention of urine, with overflow incontinence.\r\n\r\nIn cases associated with severe fracture or hæmorrhage within the\r\nskull, the conjunctivæ may be chemosed, or there may be hæmorrhage from\r\nthe nose or ear; and a flow of cerebro-spinal fluid may take place from\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\nAlcohol.--In coma due to alcohol, there will be an alcoholic odour of\r\nthe breath, alcohol in the stomach contents, and it can be detected\r\nin the urine. The odour of alcohol in the breath may be due to the\r\nadministration of alcohol by an outsider at the onset of the symptoms\r\nwhich have ended in the coma. The pupils are equal, contracted, the\r\nconjunctival reflex present, and the pupil dilates on pinching the\r\nskin of the neck. The pulse is rapid, at first strong it becomes\r\nfeeble, the respirations snoring. If the coma be not complete, muscular\r\ninco-ordination may be noticed. The person can usually be aroused by\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\nIn pure alcoholic coma the presence of the special features of coma\r\nfrom other causes will be absent. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nalcoholic coma may be combined with other kinds, and the more serious\r\nform should be kept in mind. Where there is the slightest doubt in the\r\ndiagnosis, one‘s procedure should be ruled by the possibility of the\r\ngraver cause.\r\n\r\nOpium or Narcotic Poisoning.--The skin is usually perspiring freely,\r\nmoist and cold; the countenance placid, pale and ghastly, the lips\r\nlivid. The eyes are heavy, and the pupils contracted to a pin-head and\r\nequal, the conjunctival reflex usually present. There is the odour of\r\nopium in the breath. The pulse is slow, and the respiration stertorous\r\nand slow. There is no paralysis, and the person can be momentarily\r\nroused by a sharp question or blow.\r\n\r\nApoplexy.--The person is with difficulty, if ever, temporarily aroused.\r\nThe face is red and bloated. Respiration suspirious and stertorous,\r\nand there is often Cheyne-Stokes breathing. The pupils are dilated or\r\nirregular; in pontine hæmorrhage, contracted. The temperature may at\r\nfirst be subnormal but gradually rises.\r\n\r\nThere may be rigidity of the limbs, or hemiplegia. The pulse is full\r\nand bounding, often of high tension with hardened arteries.\r\n\r\nAlbuminuria may be present.\r\n\r\nUræmia.--This is less profound than in cerebral hæmorrhage; the\r\npatient may be temporarily aroused; the onset is usually gradual.\r\nThere is albuminuria with casts; albuminuric retinitis may be present.\r\nThe pupils may be contracted or dilated. The breath has a peculiar\r\nso-called “uræmic odour.” The pulse is generally slow, the tension\r\nhigh, and the heart enlarged. The respirations are slow and sighing,\r\nand may be Cheyne-Stokes in type. There is no paralysis. There may\r\nhave been preceding convulsions, and the coma may alternate with these\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nAnasarca may be present.\r\n\r\nDiabetic Coma.--This may come on suddenly, and may occur unexpectedly\r\nin a person in whom diabetes has not been discovered up to the time of\r\ncoma. There is sighing respiration, “air hunger.” The odour of acetone\r\nin the breath is present, and sugar in the urine.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy.--Unconsciousness is profound, and comes on immediately with\r\nrigidity, followed by convulsions, unilateral, limited to the side of\r\nthe face, jaws, head and neck or arm, or generalised. Bloody froth\r\nexudes from the mouth, the tongue being bitten. The eyes are wide open,\r\nthe pupils dilated and insensible to light. Micturition may occur.\r\nAfter the convulsive attack has passed off, post-epileptic coma may\r\nremain, though usually for a short time only.\r\n\r\nSyncope.--This has been described under modes of dying (p. 38).\r\n\r\nIn all cases of coma when first seen examine the head for signs of\r\ninjury, note the odour of the breath, observe the state of the pupils\r\nand their reactions, examine the limbs for paralysis, count the pulse\r\nand note its character, and the state of the arteries, note the size of\r\nthe heart and auscultate it at each area. Count and note the character\r\nof the respirations, take the temperature, examine the urine, take note\r\nof the person‘s age, and inquire into the previous history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDDEN DEATH\r\n\r\nSudden death may proceed from natural or violent causes. From the\r\nformer, death may occur unexpectedly and very rapidly, but as a rule\r\nthe period of time occupied by the phenomena of “dying” is measurable,\r\nthough inconstant. Should such period of time be immeasurable, death\r\nmay be considered as instantaneous.\r\n\r\nApart from sudden death resulting from violence or poisoning, the\r\ncommon causes are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Diseases of the heart: angina pectoris, valvular diseases with\r\nfailure of compensation, especially aortic regurgitation, degeneration\r\nof the heart muscle, rupture of the heart, heart failure from\r\ndiphtheria or toxic diseases.\r\n\r\n2. Diseases of the blood-vessels: rupture of aneurysms or varicose\r\nveins, thrombosis, embolism.\r\n\r\n3. Cerebral hæmorrhage, especially when in the region of the pons\r\nVarolii or cerebellum.\r\n\r\n4. Lesions of the respiratory system: œdema or spasm of the glottis,\r\nmembranous deposit or foreign bodies in the larynx or trachea, foreign\r\nbodies in the pharynx, tumours, whooping-cough, asthma, embolism\r\nof the pulmonary artery, air embolism, fat embolism, rupture of a\r\nvessel or aneurysm into the air-passages, as in phthisical cavities,\r\npneumothorax, hæmothorax, pleuritic effusion, and in acute pneumonia.\r\n\r\n5. Rupture of a gastric ulcer or ulcer of some other part of the\r\nalimentary tract.\r\n\r\n6. Sudden hæmorrhage into the peritoneal cavity from ruptured uterus,\r\nectopic gestation, &c.\r\n\r\n7. Rupture of internal organs: distended bladder, spleen, pregnant\r\nuterus, or other abdominal viscus.\r\n\r\n8. Hæmorrhage into the pancreas.\r\n\r\n9. Conditions associated with the nervous system: mental emotions,\r\nepilepsy, uræmia, laryngismus stridulus in children.\r\n\r\n10. Sudden death has occurred in Addison‘s disease, in diabetes, in\r\ncases of lymphatism or status lymphaticus in young people, during the\r\nearly stage of chloroform anæsthesia, during simple vaginal examination\r\nin women, during the injection of fluids into the vagina or uterus.\r\nBouvalat (_Annales d‘Hygiène_, 1892) relates a case in which, as the\r\ncannula of a syringe was being introduced into the os uteri of a woman\r\nwith the object of criminal abortion, she fell back before any fluid\r\nwas injected, and died in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nA similar case came under my notice, in which death took place while\r\nthe husband of the woman was attempting to introduce a solution of 20\r\nminims of tincture of iodine, mixed with water to measure two drachms,\r\ninto her uterus through a No. 3 catheter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF DEATH\r\n\r\nReal or Apparent Death\r\n\r\nIt will be unnecessary here to discuss any of the theories put forward\r\nwith regard to cases of apparent death or prolonged trance, but simply\r\nto note in the order of their occurrence the phenomena which attend\r\nreal death.\r\n\r\n\r\nReal Death\r\n\r\nUnder this heading it is important to draw a distinction between\r\n“Somatic death” and “Molecular death.” “Somatic death” is defined as\r\n“the cessation of the vital functions and of the general renewal of\r\ntissue consequent on that cessation”; “Molecular death” is the death of\r\nthe tissues themselves.\r\n\r\nThe signs of death occur as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. _Entire and continuous cessation of the respiration and circulation;\r\nno sounds heard on auscultation._ The absence of the heart sounds is\r\nthe most important sign of death, for even in the severest forms of\r\nsyncope the cardiac pulsations, as shown by M. Bouchet, can with care\r\nbe heard.\r\n\r\n=Tests for cessation of respiration:--=\r\n\r\n(_a_) Auscultation. (_b_) Placing a cold hand-mirror or empty\r\ndrinking-glass over the mouth or nostrils, or a light feather, and\r\nnoting the presence or absence of bedewing or movement. (_c_) Placing\r\na shallow vessel, such as a saucer, full of water on the chest or\r\nabdomen, and observing the presence or absence of rippling of the fluid\r\n(Winslow‘s test).\r\n\r\n=Tests for cessation of the circulation:--=\r\n\r\n(_a_) Auscultation.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Manual exploration of the principal arteries for pulsation or\r\nthrill.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Magnus‘s test, applying a ligature tightly round a finger,\r\nsufficient to stop the venous but not the arterial circulation, and\r\nnoticing whether or not a bloodless ring forms at the seat of ligature,\r\nand a zone of livid redness on the distal side of the ligature, the\r\npart becoming first red, then purple.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Applying pressure to the finger-nail, and noticing whether the\r\ncolour disappears on pressure, and a pink tinge appears after relaxing\r\nthe pressure.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Applying heat, such as dropping melted sealing-wax on the skin,\r\nand noting whether or not redness or vesication ensues.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Holding the hand, with the fingers abducted, against a strong\r\nfight, and observing whether or not the web of the fingers is\r\ntranslucent.\r\n\r\n(_g_) Inserting a brightly polished needle into a fleshy part of the\r\nbody, allowing it to remain for ten seconds or so _in situ_, and\r\nnoticing whether it is tarnished or not on withdrawing it.\r\n\r\n(_h_) Injecting hypodermically a solution of fluorescin\r\n(resorcin-phthalein and sodium bicarbonate, a gramme of each dissolved\r\nin 8 c.c. of water). No local discoloration of the skin takes place if\r\nthe circulation has ceased, but if not, a yellowish-green coloration\r\nof the skin occurs round the seat of injection, and the substance may\r\nbe detected in the blood at a part some distance from the seat of\r\ninjection. By immersing some white silk threads in the blood drawn\r\nat a distance from the prick, then boiling them in distilled water,\r\nthe latter will have a greenish colour if the fluorescin has been\r\ncirculated (Icard‘s test).\r\n\r\nThese tests will detect whether the circulation has ceased or not, and\r\nso differentiate suspended animation from real death.\r\n\r\n2. The _lustre of the eye_ is lost immediately after death. It has,\r\nhowever, been stated that the iris will respond to the action of\r\natropine and eserine for some hours after death, and that the action of\r\nthe latter is always more marked than that of the former. The fundus\r\nas seen by ophthalmoscopic examination is altered, the normal redness\r\nchanges to a yellowish-white, the vessels in the disc and just around\r\nit become empty, and the veins appear to contain bubbles of gas and the\r\ncolumn of blood is broken up (Bouchet). A blackish round or oval stain\r\nhas been described by M. Larcher on the sclerotic coat on the outer\r\nside, which he calls _l‘imbibition cadavérique du fond de l‘œil_. It is\r\nprobably due to thinning of the sclerotic from evaporation, enabling\r\nthe choroid to be seen through it. The spot precedes rigidity and is a\r\nforerunner of putrefaction.\r\n\r\n3. The _most powerful stimulus applied to the body does not cause any\r\nreaction_. The muscles _may_, however, be made to contract shortly\r\nafter death by the stimulus of a slight blow, or by galvanism.\r\n\r\n4. _The surface of the body becomes of an ashy-white colour._\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptions.\r\n\r\n    (1) Persons of florid complexion retain this on the malar\r\n        prominence for some time after death.\r\n\r\n    (2) The red or livid edges of ulcers.\r\n\r\n    (3) Blue, black, or red tattoo marks, if not effaced during\r\n        life, do not disappear.--Ecchymoses retain the hue they\r\n        had at the time of death.\r\n\r\n    (4) An “icteric” coloration existing at death, as in\r\n        jaundice, never becomes white.\r\n\r\n    (5) A rosy tint of the skin on those poisoned by carbon\r\n        monoxide.\r\n\r\n    (6) Dusky-red patches in those frozen to death.\r\n\r\n    (7) In certain cases of drowning, a rosy colour may be\r\n        observed on the lips and malar prominences.\r\n\r\n5. The _temperature of the body_ at the time of death is retained\r\nfor some time. As a sign of death the fall of temperature must be\r\nprogressively continuous. Cooling will depend on the medium in which\r\nthe body is placed, and mere coldness of the body is not a sign of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    (1) Fat persons retain the heat longer than lean ones;\r\n        adults longer than children or old persons. Bodies are\r\n        cooled by--1. Radiation. 2. Conduction. 3. Convection.\r\n\r\n    (2) Bodies immersed in water cool more rapidly than in air.\r\n        This fact may be of importance in determining survivorship\r\n        in a case of drowning.\r\n\r\n    (3) Bodies in bed and covered by the clothes, or in\r\n        cesspools and in dung-heaps, cool less rapidly than when\r\n        exposed.\r\n\r\n    (4) Persons killed by lightning may keep warm longer than\r\n        others.\r\n\r\n    (5) Death by suffocation retards the process of cooling.\r\n\r\n    (6) The body may be cold externally, but possesses a\r\n        considerable amount of heat when the internal organs are\r\n        exposed. Persons who have died of cholera, yellow fever,\r\n        or suddenly of some acute disease--rheumatism--may retain\r\n        for some hours a considerable amount of heat. It has\r\n        even been asserted that in some diseases--cholera--there\r\n        is an increase of temperature soon after death\r\n        (Laycock), also after death due to some diseases\r\n        of the nervous system as in pontine hæmorrhage and\r\n        cerebro-spinal meningitis, and following prolonged muscular\r\n        spasm as in tetanus.\r\n\r\n    (7) Most bodies, under ordinary circumstances, are, as a\r\n        rule, quite cold in from eight to twelve hours after death.\r\n        The rate of loss of temperature depends upon the difference\r\n        between that of the body and its surroundings; it lessens\r\n        as the body cools. It takes at least twenty-four hours for\r\n        it to fall to the heat of the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\n6. _Relaxation, primary flaccidity, more or less general, of the\r\nmuscular system takes place._\r\n\r\n_“If the above signs are alone present, death must have taken place\r\nin from ten to twelve hours at the longest”_ (Casper). _Exception:\r\ncadaveric spasm._\r\n\r\n7. _Want of elasticity in the eyeball: flaccidity of the iris._ This\r\ncondition invariably occurs in from twelve to eighteen hours after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n8. _Flattening of the muscles_ of those parts on which the body rests,\r\ndue probably to loss of vital turgidity.\r\n\r\n9. _Hypostasis._--Suggillation, or _post-mortem_ staining, is due to\r\nthe gravitation of the blood to the most dependent parts of the body\r\nnot subject to direct pressure. The hypostatic marks begin to form\r\nin from eight to twelve hours after death, and increase in size till\r\nputrefaction sets in. They alter their position with changes in the\r\nposition of the body so long as the blood remains fluid, but when it\r\nhas coagulated they remain permanent. Hypostasis may be mistaken for an\r\necchymosis or a bruise, and in the lungs for congestion, inflammation,\r\n&c. Errors may also occur with regard to the brain, stomach, kidneys,\r\nand intestines: in the last, the redness of inflammation is seen all\r\nover the parts, whereas the coloration of hypostasis is interrupted,\r\nand this is best shown by drawing out the convolutions. The heart is\r\nan exception to the rule, but it may contain clots varying in size\r\nand colour. These are _post-mortem_ formations. The use of the word\r\nsuggillation is objectionable, as it has been used in opposite senses\r\nby Continental and British authors--some writers restricting the term\r\nto ecchymosis proper, others using it as synonymous with cadaveric\r\nlividity or external hypostasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutaneous Hypostasis\r\n\r\n    (1) _Meaning of the expression._--The gravitation of\r\n        the blood in the capillaries after death, in obedience\r\n        to the laws of inert matter.\r\n\r\n    (2) _On what parts of the body usually seen?_--On the\r\n        most dependent parts of the body; on the whole of the\r\n        back of the body, if the body be supine. The patches are\r\n        irregular and slashed, terminate abruptly, and do not\r\n        fade gradually into the surrounding colourless skin.\r\n\r\n    (3) _At what period after death first observed?_--In\r\n        from eight to twelve hours, gradually extending in size\r\n        till putrefaction sets in.\r\n\r\n    (4) _Whether or not affected by death from\r\n        hæmorrhage?_--Formed after every kind of death, even\r\n        after death due to hæmorrhage, although the coloration\r\n        may not be quite so marked.\r\n\r\n    (5) _Hypostasis is liable to be mistaken for\r\n        ecchymosis--the result of injury._--Hypostasis must\r\n        also not be confounded with the livid patches seen on\r\n        the legs and feet of aged persons and on those who have\r\n        died from typhus, chronic renal and cardiac disease, &c.\r\n        The rose patches--“frost erythems”--seen on those who\r\n        have died from exposure to cold, must not be mistaken\r\n        for ecchymosis. The above patches are as frequently on\r\n        the upper surfaces of the body as on the lower, and are\r\n        not so extended as cadaveric lividities; the blood,\r\n        moreover, which gives rise to them is diffused through\r\n        the areolar tissue, and not incorporated with the true\r\n        skin.\r\n\r\n    (6) _How distinguished from ecchymosis?_--Effused or\r\n        coagulated blood is found when an incision is made\r\n        in a _true_ ecchymosis, however small, whereas\r\n        a few bloody points are alone seen on a slight or\r\n        deep incision into a _post-mortem_ stain or true\r\n        hypostasis. The seat of hypostasis is the superficial\r\n        layer of the true skin. Hypostases are never raised\r\n        above the surface, as ecchymoses sometimes are. In\r\n        describing these two conditions, “ecchymosis” and\r\n        “hypostasis,” it is preferable to describe the former as\r\n        “discoloration from extravasated blood,” and the latter\r\n        as “lividity after death.”\r\n\r\n10. _Cadaveric rigidity._--From the moment of death till the time when\r\nputrefaction sets in, the muscular structures of the body may be said\r\nto pass through three stages:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Muscular Irritability._--The muscles flaccid,\r\n        but still possessing the power of contractility on the\r\n        application of certain stimuli. Parts contracted during\r\n        the act of dying--cadaveric spasm--as the muscles of the\r\n        hand grasping a knife or other weapon, may continue so\r\n        for some time after death.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Cadaveric rigidity._--A state of rigidity, the\r\n        power of contractility absent.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Commencement of Putrefaction and Chemical\r\n        Change._--Relaxation again present; all power of\r\n        contraction lost, not to be regained.\r\n\r\nCadaveric rigidity, or _rigor mortis_, is a purely muscular phenomenon,\r\nand is not dependent on the nervous system, as it is not prevented,\r\nthough it may be delayed, by division of the nerves, and is as well\r\nmarked in paralysed as in non-paralysed limbs. Cadaveric rigidity,\r\nwhich occurs early in the heart, must not be mistaken for hypertrophy,\r\nor its absence for dilatation. In every case the _rigor mortis_\r\nprecedes putrefaction, and consists in a shortening and thickening\r\nof certain muscles, chiefly the flexor and adductor muscles of the\r\nextremities, and also the elevators of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThis condition commences in the involuntary muscles, and in the heart\r\nmay simulate hypertrophy of that organ, then passes into the voluntary\r\nmuscles of the back of the neck and lower jaw, and then into the\r\nmuscles of the face, front of the neck, chest, and upper extremities,\r\nand then into the trunk muscles, and last of all, into those of the\r\nlower extremities. In most cases it passes off in the same order, the\r\nbody becoming quite flaccid, the _rigor mortis_ never returning. These\r\nphenomena occur whilst the body is cooling. The muscle becoming rigid\r\nis dying, the rigid muscle is dead. The cause of the _rigor mortis_ is\r\nheld to be due to the coagulation of the myosin. The reaction is acid\r\nfrom the presence of sarcolactic acid, but becomes alkaline during\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nIf fresh difibrinated blood be passed through the rigid muscle, it will\r\nbecome flaccid, and respond by contraction to electric stimulation.\r\n\r\nCadaveric rigidity generally supervenes from _eight_ to _twenty_ hours\r\nafter death, and may continue from a few hours to four or nine days.\r\n\r\nThe sooner rigidity comes on after death the sooner will it pass away,\r\nand the later the onset the longer it will last. It is a general rule\r\nthat whatever exhausts the muscular irritability before death causes\r\nthe early appearance and the more rapid disappearance of _rigor mortis_.\r\n\r\nConditions which modify the onset and duration of _rigor mortis_:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Age._--Transitory _rigor mortis_ may appear\r\n        in the immature fœtus according to the state of its\r\n        muscular development.\r\n\r\n    It is feeble and disappears quickly in infants and young\r\n        children.\r\n\r\n    It is usually well marked in adolescents and healthy\r\n        adults, but feeble in old people.\r\n\r\n    (2) _The Degree of Muscular Development of the\r\n        Body._--Other things being equal, the greater the\r\n        muscular development and muscular strength at the\r\n        time of death, the slower is the onset of _rigor\r\n        mortis_, and the longer its duration; the more feeble\r\n        or exhausted the muscular condition, the more rapid the\r\n        onset and the shorter its duration.\r\n\r\n    (3) _The Temperature of the Environment of the\r\n        Body._--In temperate and colder climates _rigor\r\n        mortis_ follows the usual course. A low temperature,\r\n        below freezing-point, will retard the onset and favour\r\n        the duration of _rigor mortis_, but if the body be\r\n        suddenly thawed before _rigor mortis_ has set in,\r\n        it will appear rapidly and disappear more quickly than\r\n        if it had not been subjected to the process of thawing.\r\n\r\n    If a body already in a condition of early rigidity be\r\n        exposed to a temperature of 75° C., the rigidity becomes\r\n        more marked, since albuminates in the muscles, other\r\n        than the myosin, become coagulated in addition. This\r\n        phenomenon has been called _heat stiffening_.\r\n\r\n    (4) _Mode of Death._--After all exhausting diseases\r\n        of long or short duration, rigor mortis appears early\r\n        and passes off quickly, as in death from phthisis,\r\n        cholera, typhus fever, typhoid, hydrophobia, scurvy, and\r\n        occasionally in chronic Bright‘s disease.\r\n\r\nDeath during alcoholic intoxication favours the duration of _rigor\r\nmortis_. After violent muscular exercise death is quickly followed by\r\nrigidity. Animals that have been hunted for some time before death\r\nstiffen very rapidly. When convulsions precede death, _rigor mortis_\r\nsets in early as a rule, but in certain cases, where death has been\r\npreceded by strong convulsions, rigidity may appear quickly, but last\r\nfor some days, as in some cases of poisoning by strychnine.\r\n\r\nConditions which simulate _rigor mortis_:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Stiffening by Catalepsy._--In this condition\r\n        the temperature of the body will remain at a degree\r\n        compatible with life over a period incompatible\r\n        with real death. If a limb be extended and rigid in\r\n        catalepsy, after passive flexion of it, it will return\r\n        to its former state.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Rigidity from the Body being Frozen._--In this\r\n        condition passive movement of the joints is accompanied\r\n        by crackling due to fracture of their frozen contents.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Heat Stiffening._--Is seen in the bodies of\r\n        persons who have been suddenly immersed in boiling\r\n        fluids; also to a certain degree in bodies of persons\r\n        who have met their death by burning from paraffin lamp\r\n        accidents.\r\n\r\n_Cadaveric Spasm or Instantaneous Rigor._--“When this phenomenon occurs\r\nthe last act of life is crystallised in death.” It is a prolongation of\r\nthe last vital contraction of the muscles into the rigidity of death.\r\nCadaveric rigidity of the muscles must be distinguished from _muscular\r\nspasm_ occurring at the moment of death.\r\n\r\nThey may thus he distinguished: In cadaveric rigidity any object\r\nplaced in the hand prior to the onset of _rigor mortis_ can be readily\r\nremoved, even if the precaution be taken of binding it in the hand\r\nprior to the accession of _rigor mortis_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _muscular spasm_ the object is found grasped in the\r\nhand, and can only be with difficulty removed.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty experienced in removing a pistol or other weapon from\r\nthe hand may point to suicide; its easy removal to homicide, the weapon\r\nhaving been placed there after death.\r\n\r\nNo adequate explanation of this phenomenon has yet been made. It is not\r\nan unusually early onset of _rigor mortis_ in the muscles affected,\r\nbecause they do not share in the initial relaxation that precedes\r\nit, or the weapon would fall from the hand, and the bodies would not\r\nretain the peculiar attitudes which have been described in different\r\ninstances. Nothing can simulate cadaveric spasm and it cannot be\r\nproduced in any way after death. Instantaneous rigor only occurs in\r\ncases in which there has been great mental tension and nerve excitation\r\nbefore death. It is a continuation of probably the very last voluntary\r\nact of life.\r\n\r\n_A body showing the signs of death before mentioned_ (Nos. 1 to 10)\r\n_may be held to be that of a person who has been dead from two to three\r\ndays at the longest_ (Casper).\r\n\r\nMuscular states of the body between the period of somatic and molecular\r\ndeath:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Primary Flaccidity._--The muscles respond to\r\n        electrical stimuli; the chemical reaction of the muscles\r\n        is either neutral or faintly alkaline.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Cadaveric Rigidity_ or _Rigor\r\n        Mortis_.--During this condition molecular death takes\r\n        place; the muscles do not respond to stimuli, but fresh\r\n        defibrinated blood passed through the muscles will\r\n        restore the response to stimulation, and their reaction\r\n        is markedly acid.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Secondary Flaccidity._--Disintegration of the\r\n        muscular elements takes place, no stimuli will provoke\r\n        response, and the reaction again becomes alkaline.\r\n\r\nTable showing the principal points to be noted in the period of\r\naccession of Cadaveric Rigidity and the causes which retard or hasten\r\nits appearance, or modify its duration:--\r\n\r\n    _In what does it consist?_--In a shortening and\r\n        thickening of the muscles, particularly the flexors and\r\n        adductors of the extremities, and elevators of the lower\r\n        jaw.\r\n\r\n    _Period of Invasion._--Generally in from eight to\r\n        twenty hours after death. It has been known, however, to\r\n        supervene within three minutes of death, but it may be\r\n        delayed for sixteen or seventeen hours.\r\n\r\n    _Period of Duration._--From one to nine days. Three\r\n        weeks (Taylor).\r\n\r\n    _Order in which the Muscles are affected._--Involuntary\r\n        muscles, back of neck and lower jaw, muscles of the\r\n        face, front of the neck, chest, upper extremities and\r\n        then the lower extremities.\r\n\r\n    _Order in which it disappears._--Back of neck, lower\r\n        jaw, &c., following the course of its accession.\r\n\r\n    _Effects of Exposure to Cold._--Prolonged by dry cold\r\n        air, and by cold water.\r\n\r\n    _Effects of Enfeebling Disease prior to Death._--Rapid\r\n        in its invasion, and passing off rapidly.\r\n\r\n    _Effect of a Robust Frame at Period of Death._--The\r\n        accession may be prolonged; but, other things being\r\n        equal, it is more strongly manifested, and continues\r\n        longer.\r\n\r\n    _Effects of Violent Exercise prior to Death._--Rapidly\r\n        supervenes and rapidly disappears, as in soldiers killed\r\n        at the end of a battle.\r\n\r\n    _Effects of Poison._--Poisons which cause violent\r\n        contractions for some time prior to death--strychnine,\r\n        &c.--influence the rapid invasion of the _rigor\r\n        mortis_, its short duration, rapidly followed by\r\n        putrefaction. Where death in poisoning by strychnine is\r\n        almost instantaneous, with a short convulsive stage,\r\n        _rigor mortis_ comes on _rapidly_ and remains\r\n        a _long_ time.\r\n\r\n11. _Putrefaction_.--the last of the phenomena which follow death--is\r\nthe resolution of the organised tissues of the body to the inorganic\r\nstate. It is a gradual process, and is the result of the action of\r\n_micro-organisms, aided by moisture, air, and warmth_.\r\n\r\nPutrefaction is the only absolute sign of death having taken place.\r\n\r\nThe _conditions which modify putrefaction_ are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_External Conditions._--1. Micro-organisms; 2. Air; 3. Moisture; 4.\r\nWarmth.\r\n\r\n_Internal Conditions._--1. Age; 2. Sex; 3. Condition of the body--(_a_)\r\n_Constitutional peculiarity_; (_b_) State of the body. 4. Kind of\r\ndeath--(_a_) _The result of disease_; (_b_) _The result of poisons_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Conditions Which Modify Putrefaction\r\n\r\n1. _Micro-organisms._--A fauna and flora of decomposition has been\r\ndescribed in a paper by Hough on “The Fauna of Dead Bodies,” _B. M.\r\nJ._, vol. ii. 1897, p. 1853, to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\nMany different forms of micro-organisms combine in the production of\r\nputrefaction, and the result of their action is inevitable, unless the\r\nbody be guarded against their invasion by special means, or the tissues\r\nbe rendered unfit for their use.\r\n\r\n2. _Air._--Exposure in the open air has a marked effect in promoting\r\nputrefaction; but garments fitting close to the body, and thus\r\nexcluding air, have a contrary effect. Dry air, or air in motion,\r\nby assisting evaporation from the corpse, acts as a preservative.\r\nThe composition of the soil in which the body is placed has also a\r\nmore or less modifying effect. In light, porous soil, allowing of\r\nthe free ingress of air, decomposition is more rapid than in close,\r\ncompact soil, as clay; but in this we have to contend with another\r\nagent--moisture--which more or less counteracts the protective virtue\r\nof the closer earth.\r\n\r\n3. _Moisture._--Putrefaction cannot proceed without moisture. The body,\r\nhowever, contains sufficient water to enable this process to commence\r\nspontaneously. Organic substances artificially deprived of water do not\r\nputrefy. Cold and heat possess marked antiseptic properties--the former\r\nby freezing the fluids in the body, the latter by drying them up.\r\n\r\n4. _Warmth._--A temperature between 70° and 100° F. is found most\r\nfavourable to decomposition. The effect of cold is shown by the fact\r\nthat a body immersed in water during winter, at a temperature between\r\n36° and 45° F., may be so well preserved as to present, ten or twelve\r\ndays after death, well-marked signs of violence, which would in summer\r\nhave been utterly obliterated in five or seven days. The preservative\r\ninfluence of cold water will, however, depend greatly on the depth\r\nat which the body has been submerged. Bodies so submerged, and then\r\nexposed to the air, putrefy with such rapidity that exposure for one\r\nday is said to work a greater change than three or four days longer\r\nretention of the body in the water. As an instance of the preservative\r\npower of cold, may be mentioned the mammoth found in Siberia embedded\r\nin a block of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Conditions Which Modify Putrefaction\r\n\r\n1. _Age._--The bodies of young children, other things being equal,\r\nare said to putrefy rapidly. It should be remembered, however, that\r\nclothing possesses considerable power in retarding putrefaction, and\r\nthat, in the hurry and anxiety to get rid of the infants, they are\r\noftener exposed naked than clothed, which may, in some measure, account\r\nfor their more rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\n2. _Sex._--Sex, it would appear, has little or no influence either to\r\nretard or hasten putrefaction; but it has been remarked that females\r\ndying during or soon after child-birth, irrespectively of the cause of\r\ndeath, putrefy rapidly.\r\n\r\n3. _Condition of the Body._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Constitutional Peculiarity._--It is generally admitted that\r\npersons of the same age and sex, dying similar deaths, and subjected\r\nto like conditions as to exposure to the air and interment in the same\r\nsoil, exhibit marked differences as regards the accession and rapidity\r\nof putrefaction. The explanation may be difficult, but the fact still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _State of the Body._--Fat and flabby corpses putrefy more rapidly\r\nthan the lean and emaciated. Hence old people, who are generally thin,\r\nkeep fresh for a comparatively long time. Bodies, also, which are\r\nmuch mutilated rapidly decompose--decomposition setting in first at\r\nthe parts injured. In examining wounds and bruises said to have been\r\ninflicted during life, it is well to remember that the tendency of\r\nputrefaction is to make them appear more severe.\r\n\r\n4. _Kind of Death._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Effect of Disease._--Healthy persons dying suddenly, other\r\nthings being equal, are said to decompose more slowly than those\r\nwho have died from exhausting diseases, as in the case of typhoid,\r\nphthisis, and dropsy, following organic disease, or of those diseases\r\nattended with more or less putridity of the fluids.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Effects of Poisons._--Putrefaction rapidly supervenes in\r\nthose who have died suffocated by smoke, by carbonic oxide, and by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Narcotic poisoning is stated to accelerate this\r\ncondition; but in poisoning by phosphorus or alcohol, and in cases\r\nof death from sulphuric acid, the putrefactive changes are greatly\r\nretarded. Arsenic, chloride of zinc, and antimony are reputed to\r\npossess antiseptic properties. The manner in which death takes place\r\nfrom the action of the poison greatly hastens or retards putrefaction.\r\nThus, in the case of poisoning by strychnine, it is found that\r\nwhen death has occurred rapidly, without much muscular exhaustion,\r\nputrefaction sets in slowly; but that, when the muscular irritability\r\nhas been greatly exhausted by successive fits, the contrary is the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHENOMENA OF PUTRESCENCE IN THEIR CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =External=\r\n\r\n_One to Three Days._--Greenish coloration of the abdominal walls. Odour\r\nof putrescence is gradually developed, and, concurrently with this, the\r\neyeball becomes soft and yielding to pressure.\r\n\r\n_Three to Five Days._--The green colour, of a deeper shade, has\r\nnow passed over the abdomen, extending also to the genital organs.\r\nPatches of this green coloration also make their appearance somewhat\r\nirregularly on other parts of the body, such as the neck, back, chest,\r\nand lower extremities. A dark reddish frothy fluid about this time\r\nwells up from the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Eight to Ten Days._--The patches of green colour have now coalesced,\r\nso that the whole body is discoloured. On some parts of the body the\r\ncolour is of a reddish-green, due to the presence of decomposed blood\r\nin the cellular tissue. The abdomen is now distended with gases, the\r\nproducts of decomposition. In India this distension has been known to\r\noccur in less than six hours, the average period being a little over\r\neighteen hours. Much depends upon the season of the year. The colour of\r\nthe eyes has not disappeared, but the cornea have fallen in. Relaxation\r\nof the sphincter ani takes place, and the superficial veins appear like\r\nreddish-brown cords. The nails still remain firm.\r\n\r\n_Fourteen to Twenty Days._--The colour of the surface is now bright\r\ngreen, with here and there patches of a blood and brown colour. The\r\nepidermal layer of the skin is raised in bullæ of varying size, in\r\nsome places the skin being more or less stripped off. The nails are\r\ndetached, and can be easily removed. The hair can be pulled from the\r\nscalp with ease. The body is now greatly distended with gases, and\r\nthe features cannot be recognised, owing to the swollen condition of\r\nthe face. The body is generally covered with vermin. In determining\r\nthe time at which death occurred, it will be necessary to take into\r\nconsideration the season of the year, as it is found that an advanced\r\nstage of decomposition may be present in from eight to ten days, with\r\nthe thermometer ranging between 68° and 77° F., which in winter, with a\r\ntemperature of from 32° to 50° F., would require twenty to thirty days.\r\n“_Bodies green from putridity, blown up and excoriated, at the expiry\r\nof one month, or from three to five months after death (cæt. par.),\r\ncannot with any certainty be distinguished from one another_” (Casper).\r\n\r\n_Three to Six Months._--During the above period the stage of\r\ncolliquative putrefaction has set in. The thoracic and abdominal\r\ncavities, due to the increased formation of gas, have burst. The bones\r\nof the cranium have more or less separated, allowing the brain to\r\nescape. The soft parts are more or less absorbed, and no recognition\r\nof the features is possible. The sex can only be positively made out\r\nby the presence of a uterus, or by the peculiar growth of hair on the\r\npubes, which in woman only covers the pubes, but in man extends upwards\r\nto the navel.\r\n\r\n_Saponification._--Bodies exposed to the action of water, or buried in\r\ndamp, moist soil, are apt to undergo certain changes, in the course of\r\nwhich they become saponified, and the formation of a substance known\r\nas _adipocere_ is the result. Adipocere--_adeps_, lard, and _cera_,\r\nwax--is chiefly composed of margarate of ammonia, together with lime,\r\noxide of iron, potash, certain fatty acids, and a yellow-coloured\r\nodorous matter. The melting-point is 126.5° F. Adipocere has a fatty,\r\nunctuous feel, is either pure white or of a pale yellowish colour,\r\nand with the odour of decayed cheese. It is highly resistant to\r\nputrefactive organisms, and is generally free from them. The formation\r\nof this substance “to any considerable extent is not likely to occur\r\nin less than three to four months in water, or six months in moist\r\nearth, though its commencement may take place at a much earlier\r\nperiod” (Casper). The above-quoted authority mentions a case in “which\r\nthe remains of a fœtus were found imbedded in adipocere, and which\r\nfœtus was proved to have been buried in a garden exactly six months\r\nand three-quarters.” Taylor also records the case of a bankrupt who\r\ncommitted suicide by drowning, in which the muscles of the buttocks\r\nwere found converted into adipocere in five weeks and four days at the\r\nlongest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above statements may be accepted with regard to the\r\nformation of adipocere as far as European countries are concerned,\r\nthey do not seem to be applicable to India, where the change appears\r\nto be more rapid. Dr. S. Coull Mackenzie, in his valuable book on\r\n_Medico-Legal Experiences in Calcutta_, records a case of a young\r\nman whose body, recovered after seven days‘ immersion in the river\r\nHooghly, “was found to be in an advanced state of saponification,” and\r\nthe fleshy portions of undigested food in the stomach were converted\r\nentirely into adipocere. “Lastly,” he writes, “in the hot, steamy,\r\nrainy months of September and October, in three of the cases above\r\nmentioned, saponification was found in bodies immersed in water, both\r\nexternally and internally, in from two days to eight days ten hours. In\r\nthe soft and porous soil of Lower Bengal during the rainy seasons, even\r\nin a wooden coffin, the change is very rapid--three or four days.”\r\n\r\nTo explain the formation of adipocere, it has been supposed to be due\r\nto the decomposition of the muscular structures of the body, by which\r\nhydrogen and nitrogen are evolved, these combining to form ammonia, and\r\nthis, coming in contact with the fatty acids of the fat, forms a soap.\r\nThe process of saponification takes place most rapidly in young fat\r\npersons; next, in those adults who abound in fat, and in those whose\r\nbodies have been exposed to the soil of water-closets; more rapidly\r\nin running than in stagnant water; and lastly, in those who have been\r\nburied in moist, damp soil, especially if the bodies have been piled\r\none on the top of the other, the lowest being first saponified. The\r\nmuscular tissue appears to be the first to undergo this change. In\r\nwater the process is said to be completed in about five months, but in\r\nsoil a period of two or three years appears necessary.\r\n\r\n_Mummification_ is of no medico-legal interest, as the causes which\r\nproduce it are unknown, and no reliable data can be obtained as to the\r\nperiod of its accession, or the time required for its production.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Internal=\r\n\r\nTable showing the order in which the Internal Organs undergo\r\nPutrefaction:\r\n\r\n     1.

An examination of the\r\ntrachea should never be omitted.\r\n\r\n2. _The Brain of Infants up to the First Year._\r\n\r\n3. _The Stomach._--The first traces of putrefaction are seen in\r\nfrom four to six days after death. All the coats of the stomach are\r\nsoftened, but there is no excoriation, as is the case when corrosive\r\npoisons are taken. Emphysematous separation of the mucous coat may be\r\npresent, but must not be confounded with the excoriation just mentioned.\r\n\r\n4. _The Intestines._--Casper declares that he does not remember any\r\ncase in the course of his experience where the intestines were “found\r\nearlier putrefied than the stomach.” In the course of putrefaction\r\nthey become of a dark brown colour, bursting, and allowing an escape\r\nof their contents; and they ultimately become changed into a dark\r\npultaceous mass.\r\n\r\n5. _The Spleen._--This organ in some cases putrefies before the stomach\r\nand intestines; but, as a rule, it resists decomposition longer.\r\n\r\n6. _The Omentum and Mesentery._\r\n\r\n7. _The Liver._--This organ is not unfrequently found firm and dense\r\nsome weeks after death. It putrefies earlier in new-born children than\r\nin adults. The convex surface first shows signs of putrefaction. The\r\ngall-bladder also remains for some time recognisable.\r\n\r\n8. _The Adult Brain._--The brain of newly-born children, as mentioned\r\nbefore, soon putrefies. This is not the case in the adult brain.\r\nPutrefaction sets in not on the surface, but at the base of the brain.\r\nA wound of the brain causes it to putrefy more rapidly than if no\r\ninjury be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrgans which Putrefy Late\r\n\r\n9. _The Heart._\r\n\r\n10. _The Lungs._--Contemporaneously with the appearance of\r\ndecomposition in the heart, the lungs also begin to show signs of\r\nputrefaction, though this condition may take place earlier.\r\n\r\n11. _The Kidneys._--These organs are long in yielding to the\r\nputrefactive process.\r\n\r\n12. _The Bladder._--Nearly all the other organs of the body are in a\r\nstate of decomposition before this viscus becomes materially affected.\r\n\r\n13. _The Gullet._--This long remains firm, even after the stomach and\r\nintestines fail to be recognised.\r\n\r\n14. _The Pancreas._--The body must be far advanced in putrefaction\r\nbefore this gland becomes affected.\r\n\r\n15. _The Diaphragm._--This may be distinguished after the lapse of four\r\nto six months.\r\n\r\n16. _The Blood-vessels._--The aorta may be recognised after the body\r\nhas been interred for fourteen months.\r\n\r\n17. _The Uterus._--Of all the organs of the body, the uterus resists\r\nthe putrefactive changes longer than any other organ.\r\n\r\nTable showing some important Facts to be noticed with regard To\r\nPutrefaction:\r\n\r\n    1. Earliest external indication of it.\r\n\r\n        (1) _In a Body exposed to Air._--Greenish coloration of the\r\n            abdominal coverings.\r\n        (2) _In a Body immersed in Water._--Face, head, and ears,\r\n            gradually extending from above downwards.\r\n\r\n    2. Earliest internal indication.--Found in the trachea, including\r\n       the larynx.\r\n\r\n    3. Advanced putrefactive appearances to be expected in a body\r\n       exposed to air, say from fourteen to twenty days at mean\r\n       temperature, as regards--\r\n\r\n        (1) _Epidermis._--Raised here and there in blisters about\r\n            the size of a walnut, in some places the size of a dinner\r\n            plate, and quite stripped off.\r\n        (2) _True Skin._--Maggots cover the body, chiefly in the\r\n            folds of the skin.\r\n        (3) _Cellular Tissue._--Blown up with gas.\r\n\r\n    4. Comparative time required to produce equal extent of putrefaction\r\n    in a body--\r\n\r\n        (1) _In Air._--One week. One month.\r\n        (2) _In Water._--Two weeks. Two months.\r\n        (3) _In Earth._--Eight weeks. Eight months.\r\n\r\n_Does Lime hasten Putrefaction?_--It is a very general opinion that it\r\ndoes. Careful experiment has, however, proved that lime neither retards\r\nnor hastens putrefaction, but that it prevents the escape of the gases\r\nproduced during the process by absorbing them; it is, therefore, a good\r\nand safe deodoriser, and in this property its true value lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS AND EXHUMATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the Instructions issued to Medical Inspectors\r\nby the Crown Office in Scotland, slightly modified:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Part of General Directions\r\n\r\n13. When any portions of the body, or any substances found in or near\r\nit, are to be preserved for further examination, they ought never\r\nto be put out of the custody of the inspectors, or of a special law\r\nofficer. They must be locked up in the absence of the person who keeps\r\nthem. When they are to be transmitted to a distance, they should be\r\nlabelled, and the labels signed by the inspectors; and after being\r\nproperly secured and sealed, they should be delivered by the inspectors\r\nthemselves, or the special law officer whose duty it is to see them\r\ndelivered into the hands of the parties for whom they are intended.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Necessary Implements\r\n\r\n14. Besides the ordinary instruments used in common dissections, the\r\ninspector should be provided with a foot-rule for measuring distances,\r\nand a glass measure graduated to drachms, for measuring the quantities\r\nof fluids, two or three stoneware jars of medium size, or when these\r\ncannot be had, a few clean bladders, for carrying away any parts of the\r\nbody which it may be necessary to preserve for future examination, and\r\nin cases of possible poisoning, three or four bottles of eight, twelve,\r\nand sixteen ounces, with glass stoppers or clean corks, for preserving\r\nfluids to be analysed. The common square green glass pickle bottles are\r\nvery suitable, and can generally be obtained. No bottle or jar should\r\nbe used until it has been thoroughly washed under the supervision of\r\none of the inspectors. In cases of infanticide a balance, having a flat\r\nscale-pan with a foot-rule painted on it, is of great use; on it the\r\ninfant may be stretched, weighed, and measured at one operation. Paper,\r\npens, ink, and sealing-wax should also be provided.\r\n\r\n15. All distances, lengths, surfaces, and the like, whose extent may\r\nrequire to be described, ought to be accurately measured; and the\r\nsame rule ought to be followed in ascertaining the volume of fluids.\r\nWhen large quantities of fluids are to be measured, any convenient\r\nvessel may be used, whose capacity is previously ascertained by the\r\ninspectors. Conjectural estimates and comparisons, however common, even\r\nin medico-legal inspections, are quite inadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. External Aspect, and Examination of the Body\r\n\r\n16. The importance of the external examination, and the particulars to\r\nbe chiefly attended to in performing it, will vary in different cases\r\nwith the probable cause of death. It comprehends an examination--(1)\r\nOf the position of the body when found, as well as of all external\r\ninjuries or marks presented by it. (2) Of the vicinity of the body,\r\nwith a view to discover the objects on which it rested, or from or\r\nupon which it may have fallen, marks of a struggle, signs of the\r\npresence of a second party about the time of death or after it, weapons\r\nor other objects the property or not the property of the deceased, the\r\nremains of poisons, marks of vomiting; and where marks of blood are of\r\nimportance, and doubts may arise as to their really being blood, the\r\narticles presenting them must be preserved for further examination. (3)\r\nOf the dress, its nature and condition, stains on it of mud, sand, and\r\nthe like, of blood, of vomit, of acids, or other corrosive substances,\r\nmarks of injuries, such as rents or incisions; where injuries have been\r\ninflicted on the body, care should be taken to compare the relative\r\nposition of those on the body and those on the clothes; and where\r\nstains, apparently from poison, are seen, the stained parts are to\r\nbe preserved for analysis. (4) Ligatures, their material and kind,\r\nas throwing light on the trade of the person who applied them; the\r\npossibility, or impossibility, of the deceased having applied them\r\nhimself; their sufficiency for accomplishing their apparent purpose, &c.\r\n\r\n17. The inspectors will commence the examination of the body itself by\r\nsurveying the external surface and openings. Before cleaning it they\r\nwill examine it on all sides, not neglecting the back, as is often\r\ndone, and look for marks of mud, blood, ligatures, injuries, stains\r\nfrom acids, and the like; foreign bodies, or injuries within the\r\nnatural openings of the body, viz. the mouth, nostrils, ears, anus,\r\nvagina, and urethra. If there are impressions of finger marks, they\r\nwill consider which hand produced them. If there be any doubt about\r\nstains being blood, the skin presenting them must be preserved for\r\nanalysis. If there be acid stains, or other probable remains of poison,\r\nor any foreign matter, the nature of which may require to be determined\r\nby analysis, these must also be preserved. The ordinary places for the\r\nimpressions of ligatures are the neck, the wrists, the ankles, and the\r\nwaist. The degree of warmth of the trunk and extremities, the presence\r\nor absence of cadaveric rigidity, and whether it exists equally in the\r\nupper or the lower extremities, should be noted in this stage of the\r\nproceedings; in other cases the progress of putrefaction, as indicated\r\nby the odour of the body, the looseness of the cuticle, the colour of\r\nthe skin, and formation of dark vesicles on it, the evolution of air in\r\nthe cellular tissue, the alteration of the features, the softness of\r\nthe muscles, the shrivelling of the eyes, the looseness of the hair and\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n18. In this part of the examination it will sometimes be necessary to\r\nobserve the particulars by which the body may be identified. These are\r\nnumerous. But the most important are the stature, the age and sex,\r\nthe degree of plumpness, the size and form of the nose and mouth, the\r\ncolour of the eyes and hair, the state of the teeth, warts, nævi,\r\ndeformities, scars of old abscesses, ulcers, and wounds, and, if a\r\nwoman, marks of her having had one or more children.\r\n\r\n19. The body is next to be washed, if necessary, and the hair of the\r\nhead shaved, or at least closely cut; and a thorough examination of\r\nthe whole integuments is to be made. At this stage the inspectors will\r\nlook particularly for the appearance of lividity, noting its chief\r\nseat and its relation to the posture in which the body was found--for\r\nimpressions on the skin of objects on which it had rested--for marks of\r\ninjuries, more especially contusions, taking care to ascertain their\r\nreal nature by making incisions through the skin--for marks of disease,\r\nsuch as eruptions, ulcers, and the like--for marks of burning--for\r\nmarks of concealed punctures in the nostrils, mouth, external openings\r\nof the ears, the eyes, the nape of the neck, the arm-pits, the anus,\r\nthe vagina, and beneath the mammæ or scrotum; in infants, also in the\r\nfontanelles and the whole course of the spine. At this stage, wounds\r\nand other injuries should be carefully examined according to the\r\ndirections given in Division V. (_infra_). Where the injury may have\r\ncaused loss of blood, the presence or absence of pallor of the skin,\r\nlining membrane of the mouth, and the gums ought to be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Dissection, or Internal Examination of the Body\r\n\r\n20. In commencing the dissection of the body, it must be laid down as\r\nan invariable rule that all the great cavities should be examined, and\r\nalso every important organ in each, however distinctly the cause of\r\ndeath may seem to be indicated in one of them. It is right to examine\r\nthe cavity of the spine, and at all events its upper portion, in any\r\ncase where an unequivocal cause of death has not been discovered\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n21. In examining the organs situated in the several cavities of the\r\nbody the inspectors must be guided in a great measure by their ordinary\r\nanatomical and pathological knowledge.\r\n\r\n22. The inspectors should begin with that cavity over which there is\r\na wound or other mark of injury. Or, if there be an injury on the\r\nextremities, the dissection ought to commence there. In the absence\r\nof any such guide, that cavity should be taken first where the\r\ncircumstances of death, so far as they are ascertained, may lead the\r\ninspectors to expect unusual appearances. In other cases, the abdomen\r\nshould be first opened but not dissected, and a general survey made of\r\nthe parts exposed, without disturbing them materially, the position\r\nof the diaphragm being determined by examining it with the hand; then\r\nthe thorax is immediately to be examined, unless there is good reason\r\nfor doing otherwise. The reasons for this method of procedure are as\r\nfollow: If the abdominal organs are removed, and the veins cut, the\r\nblood in the heart may drain away through the venæ cavæ, and error\r\nresult. If, on the other hand, the thorax be first opened, the relation\r\nof the abdominal organs to each other cannot be clearly made, owing to\r\nthe relaxation of the diaphragm, due to the severing of its thoracic\r\nconnections. Again, if the thorax be first opened, the position of the\r\ndiaphragm cannot be determined. The inspectors may begin with the head,\r\nwhich may be examined thoroughly in the first instance, afterwards the\r\nchest and belly, as above described; the spine being reserved till the\r\nconclusion. Wherever unusual appearances are discovered in the first\r\ncursory survey, the anatomical examination ought in general to be begun\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n23. In examining the several regions of the body it is to be observed\r\nthat wherever a wound, or other obvious injury of the external parts,\r\nlies in the way of the ordinary incisions, that part must be avoided,\r\nso as to leave the external injury unaltered.\r\n\r\n24. The most approved mode of opening the head in medico-legal cases\r\nis, after dividing the integuments from ear to ear, and reflecting\r\nthe scalp over the forehead and occiput, to make the usual circular\r\nincision through the skull, about an inch above the orbits in front,\r\nand over the occipital protuberance behind, using the saw lightly\r\nand carefully after the outer table of the skull has been divided,\r\nso as to avoid injuring the membranes of the brain; and to raise the\r\nskull-cap from before backwards, taking care to detach the dura mater\r\nfrom the skull with the handle of the scalpel or a spatula where it\r\nadheres firmly. The chisel and mallet should never be used where there\r\nis any chance of finding a fracture of the skull; for how could it be\r\ndistinguished from a fracture made with the mallet? Should the dura\r\nmater be firmly adherent to the skull-cap, the better practice is to\r\ndivide it carefully, so as to remove both at the same time. Tearing the\r\nmembrane and crushing the brain substance are thus avoided. In infants\r\nand young children this mode of procedure is most necessary, as in them\r\nthe dura mater is, as a rule, adherent.\r\n\r\n25. The ordinary mode of examining the membranes of the brain, and the\r\nbrain itself, answers well in medico-legal dissections. Effusions of\r\nfluid within the skull should always be measured. After the brain is\r\nremoved, the dura mater ought to be stripped from the base of the skull\r\nto facilitate the search for fractures there, which will, of course,\r\nindicate external violence. After the removal of the brain, the upper\r\npart of the spinal canal should be examined through the foramen magnum\r\nbefore any part of its course be laid open; and search should be\r\nparticularly made for dislocation or other injury in the region of\r\nthe atlas and dentata. In cases of fatal fractures of the head, the\r\nstrength of the bones should be attended to. In cases of extravasation\r\nwithin the head, the state of the coats of the cerebral arteries should\r\nbe examined.\r\n\r\n26. The best mode of opening the spine is, after having finished the\r\nexamination of the brain, to cut through the integuments from the\r\nocciput to the coccyx--to lay the vertebræ thoroughly bare on each\r\nside by cutting away the muscles--to make an incision with the saw\r\non each side of the skull, from the postero-inferior angle of the\r\nparietal bones into the lateral edge of the occipital hole--to remove\r\nthe triangular portion of the occipital bone thus detached, and then\r\nto cut the rings of the vertebræ on each side with the bone-nippers or\r\nspine-knife, beginning with the atlas. In these cases preference should\r\nbe given to the saw, by which the operation is not only more easily\r\naccomplished, but there is no risk of confounding previous fracture\r\nwith that made in dissecting. Where there is reason to think that the\r\nbones are injured, the laying open of the canal should stop at the\r\ndistance of two or three vertebræ from the injury, and the injured\r\nbones, with two or three adjacent vertebræ on each side, should be\r\nremoved entire before the examination is extended farther down the\r\nspine.\r\n\r\n27. The organs of the throat may be examined, either by dividing the\r\nlower jaw-bone at the chin, cutting the soft parts close to the inner\r\nsurface of each half of the bone backwards, and then turning the two\r\nsegments outwards; or by freely reflecting the skin of the throat,\r\nseparating the soft parts from the inside of the lower jaw, the knife\r\nbeing carried parallel with and close to the bone, drawing the tongue\r\nout below the chin, and then continuing the dissection backwards.\r\n\r\n28. The best mode of examining the organs situated in the throat is,\r\nafter detaching the soft parts from the lower jaw, as advised in Sect.\r\n27, to dissect the soft palate from the bone, and proceeding backwards,\r\nto detach the whole soft parts from the base of the skull and vertebræ\r\ndown to the sternum, leaving them connected with the organs in the\r\nchest. Besides the ordinary points to be attended to in this part of\r\nthe examination, the presence of venereal or other ulcerations is a\r\nmatter requiring attention in some cases.\r\n\r\n29. It is necessary to examine the pharynx and gullet, the larynx,\r\ntrachea, and its greater ramifications, the lungs, the heart, and the\r\ngreat vessels with particular care, because here are most frequently\r\nfound the causes of sudden natural death. In examining the heart each\r\nauricle and each ventricle ought to be laid open by an independent\r\nincision of its parietes; and this should not intersect any of the\r\nvalvular openings or the septum cordis.\r\n\r\n30. For laying open the chest and abdomen, the most convenient method\r\nis to make an incision down the fore part of the neck, chest, and\r\nabdomen to the pubes; then cutting from the peritoneum upwards, to\r\ndissect back the integuments and muscles of the chest, and examine the\r\nabdomen, as in Sect. 22; next, divide the cartilages of the ribs, and,\r\ncutting upwards, close under them, to raise the cartilages along with\r\nthe sternum. In separating the sternum from the clavicles, care must be\r\ntaken not to wound the subjacent vessels; and this may be avoided by\r\nthe dissector moving each shoulder so as to show the exact position of\r\nthe sterno-clavicular joints, and then dividing both joints cautiously.\r\nIn dividing the cartilages of the ribs, the saw is sometimes necessary.\r\nThe cartilages should be cut as far from the sternum as possible, to\r\ngive free space for the subsequent examination.\r\n\r\n31. In inspecting the organs in the chest, a cursory examination\r\nshould be first made by turning them over, ascertaining the nature and\r\nmeasuring the quantity of effused fluids, feeling for fractures of\r\nthe ribs, tumours, or other diseases, and opening the pericardium to\r\nobtain a view of the heart. The most convenient course to pursue next\r\nis, without moving the heart from its place, to lay open its several\r\ncavities, in order to judge of the quantity and state of the blood in\r\nboth sides of that organ. For this purpose the following incisions\r\nshould be made: The _first_, beginning close to the base, is carried\r\nalong the right border of the heart directly into the right ventricle\r\ntowards the apex, care being taken not to cut the septum. This lays\r\nopen the right ventricle. The _second_ incision, opening up the right\r\nauricle, begins midway between the entrances of the venæ cavæ, ending\r\njust in front of the base. The _third_, for exposing the left auricle,\r\ncommences at the left superior pulmonary vein, and ends just in front\r\nof the base, close to the coronary vein, care being taken not to wound\r\nit. The _fourth_, displaying the left ventricle, commences behind the\r\nbase, and ends close to the apex. If the blood is in a fluid state,\r\nthe quantity contained in the right auricle may be materially affected\r\nby the head being examined previously, as the blood may have escaped\r\nfrom the heart by the jugular veins. The whole of the organs in the\r\nchest--the lungs, heart, and gullet--together with the parts dissected\r\ndownwards from the throat, should now be removed in one mass, in order\r\nto examine them in detail on a table. But previously two ligatures\r\nshould be applied on the gullet, just above the cardiac orifice of the\r\nstomach, and the division made between them.\r\n\r\n32. The organs in the abdomen ought to be turned over, like those of\r\nthe chest, before any one of them is minutely examined, but before the\r\nthorax is opened, for the reasons given in Sect. 22. In the subsequent\r\nexamination, that organ is to be first proceeded with in which there\r\nmay appear to be disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Examination in Cases of Wounds and Contusions\r\n\r\n33. In a _post-mortem_ examination, the most approved mode of examining\r\nthese injuries is, if they be situated over great cavities, to expose\r\nthe successive structures in the manner of an ordinary dissection,\r\nobserving carefully what injuries have been sustained by the parts\r\nsuccessively exposed before they are divided. Wounds ought not to be\r\nprobed, especially if situated over any of the great cavities. The\r\ndepth of a wound is best ascertained by careful dissection and exposure\r\nof the parts involved; but after this is done, the thickness of the\r\ntissues penetrated may be measured by the probe.\r\n\r\n34. The seat of the wounds must be described by actual measurement from\r\nknown points, their figure and nature also carefully noted, and their\r\ndirection ascertained with exactness.\r\n\r\n35. Before altering by incisions the external appearances of injuries,\r\nwhich should never, if possible, be done, care must be taken to\r\nconsider what weapon might have produced them, and if a particular\r\nweapon be suspected, it should be compared with them. The wounded parts\r\nshould be cut out entire, and carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n36. Apparent contusions must be examined by making incisions through\r\nthem; and the inspectors will note whether there is a swelling or\r\npuckering of the skin; whether the substance of the true skin be\r\nblack through a part or the whole of its thickness; whether there be\r\nextravasation below the skin or in the deeper textures, and whether the\r\nblood be fluid or coagulated, generally or partially; whether the soft\r\nparts below be lacerated, or subjacent bones injured; and whether there\r\nbe blood in contact with the lacerated surfaces. By these means the\r\nquestion may be settled whether the contusions were inflicted before or\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\n37. In the cases of wounds, too, the signs of vital action must be\r\nattended to, especially the retraction of the edges, adhesion of blood\r\nto their surfaces, or the injection of blood into the cellular tissue\r\naround, or the presence of the signs or sequelæ of inflammation.\r\nHypostasis must not be mistaken for vascular injection.\r\n\r\n38. When large arteries or veins are found divided, care must be taken\r\nto corroborate the presumption thus arising by ascertaining, in the\r\nsubsequent dissection, whether the great vessels, lungs, liver, and\r\nmembranous viscera of the abdomen be unusually free of blood.\r\n\r\n39. In the course of the dissection of wounds, a careful search must\r\nbe made for foreign bodies in them. When firearms have occasioned\r\nthem, the examination should not be ended before discovering the\r\nbullet, wadding, or other article, if any, lodged in the body; and\r\nwhatever is found must be preserved. When the article discharged from\r\nfirearms, or when any other weapon had passed through and through a\r\npart of the body, the two wounds must be carefully distinguished by\r\ntheir respective characters, especially as regards their comparative\r\nsize, inversion or eversion, smoothness or laceration, of their edges,\r\ntheir roundness or angularity, and the comparative amount of bleeding\r\nfrom each. In gunshot injuries, the presence or absence of marks of\r\ngunpowder should be noted.\r\n\r\n40. When wounds are situated over any of the great cavities, they ought\r\nnot to be particularly examined until the cavity is laid open; and in\r\nlaying open the cavity, the external incisions should be kept clear of\r\nthe wounds.\r\n\r\n41. When the discoloured state of a portion of the skin is such as to\r\nrender it doubtful whether it is due to injury or to changes after\r\ndeath, an incision should be made to ascertain whether there is blood\r\neffused into the textures, constituting true ecchymosis, or merely\r\ngorging of the vessels of the skin, or discoloration from infiltration\r\nof the colouring matter of the blood, which takes place in depending\r\nparts of a dead body. The term suggillation should be avoided, as it\r\nhas been used in opposite senses by Continental and British authors.\r\nThe respective expressions, “discoloration from extravasated blood,”\r\nand “lividity after death,” are preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Examination in Cases of Poisoning\r\n\r\n42. In examining a body in a case of suspected poisoning, the\r\ninspectors should begin with the alimentary canal, first tying two\r\nligatures round the gullet, above the cardiac orifice of the stomach,\r\ntwo round its pyloric end, and a third at the sigmoid flexure of the\r\ncolon, then removing the stomach and entire intestines; next dissecting\r\nout the parts in the mouth, throat, neck, and chest in one mass; and,\r\nfinally, dissecting the gullet, with the parts about the throat, from\r\nthe other organs of the chest. The several portions of the alimentary\r\ncanal may then be examined in succession.\r\n\r\n43. Previous to commencing the dissection in cases of supposed\r\npoisoning, the inspectors should make such inquiries as may enable them\r\nto form an opinion as to the class of poison to which the death may be\r\ntraceable, and thus to guide them as to the conclusions to be come to\r\nfrom the presence, or it may be the complete absence, of any marked\r\nappearance explaining the cause of death.\r\n\r\n44. The medical inspectors may afford most important aid to the law\r\nofficers in investigating the history of cases of supposed poisoning.\r\nFor this purpose minute inquiry should be made into the symptoms during\r\nlife their nature, their precise date, especially in relation to meals\r\nor the taking of any suspicious article, their progressive development,\r\nand the treatment pursued. It is impossible to be too cautious in\r\ncollecting such information, and, in particular, great care must be\r\ntaken to fix the precise date of the first invasion of the symptoms,\r\nand the hours of the previous meals. The same care is required in\r\ntracing the early history of the case, where the inspector happens\r\nto visit the individual before death; and if suspicions should not\r\narise till his attendance has been going on for some time, he ought,\r\nsubsequently to such suspicions, to review and correct the information\r\ngathered at first, especially as to dates. All facts thus obtained\r\nshould be immediately committed to writing.\r\n\r\n45. Besides inspecting the body and ascertaining the history of the\r\ncase, the inspectors may afford valuable assistance to the law officers\r\nin searching for suspicious articles in the house of the deceased.\r\nThese are--suspected articles of food, drink, or medicine; the vessels\r\nin which they have been prepared or afterwards contained; the family\r\nstores of the articles with which suspected food, &c., appears to have\r\nbeen made. All such articles must be secured, according to the rules\r\nin Sect. 13, for preserving their identity. In this examination the\r\nbody-clothes, bed-clothes, floor, and hearth should not be neglected,\r\nas they may present traces of vomited matter, acids spurted out or\r\nspilled, and the like.\r\n\r\n46. When a medical man is called to a case during life, where poisoning\r\nis suspected, he ought as soon as possible to follow the instructions\r\nlaid down for securing articles in which poison may have been\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\n47. In the same circumstances, it is his duty to observe the conduct of\r\nany suspected individual, were it for no other reason than to prevent\r\nthe remains of poisoned articles from being put out of the way, and to\r\nprotect his patient against further attempts.\r\n\r\n48. The whole organs of the abdomen must be surveyed, and particularly\r\nthe stomach and whole tract of the intestines, the liver, spleen, and\r\nkidneys, the bladder; and in the female, the uterus and its appendages.\r\nThe intestines should in general be split up throughout their whole\r\nlength; and it should be remembered that the most frequent seat of\r\nnatural disease of their mucous membrane is in the neighbourhood\r\nof the ileo-cæcal valve, and that, next to the stomach, the parts\r\nmost generally presenting appearances in cases of poisoning are the\r\nduodenum, upper part of jejunum, lower part of ileum, and rectum.\r\n\r\n49. In cases where the possibility of poisoning must be kept in view,\r\nand where matters may require to be procured for chemical analysis, it\r\nis essential to be sure that all instruments, vessels, and bladders\r\nused are scrupulously clean.\r\n\r\n50. When any unusual odour is perceived, either in the blood in the\r\ncourse of making the dissection, or in the stomach when opened, it\r\nought to be carefully observed, and if possible identified by all the\r\nmedical men present. In this way alcohol, opium, prussic acid, oil of\r\nbitter almonds, and other odorous poisons may be recognised. The smell\r\nof the contents of the stomach ought always to be noted whenever it is\r\nopened, as the smell often alters rapidly.\r\n\r\n51. The stomach and intestines should be taken out entire, and their\r\ncontents emptied into separate bottles. If the stomach or part of\r\nthe intestines present any remarkable appearance, examination may\r\nbe reserved, if convenient, till a future opportunity; but in every\r\ncircumstance it must be preserved and carried away, as it may itself\r\nbe an important article for analysis. The throat and gullet may\r\nbe examined at once, and preserved with their contents, which, if\r\nabundant, may be kept apart in a bottle. In addition to the alimentary\r\ncanal and its various contents, portions of the solid organs of the\r\nbody ought to be secured for analysis. The most important are the\r\nliver, spleen, and kidneys. A part of the liver, at least a fourth\r\npart, should be secured in every case of supposed poisoning; and in\r\ncases where the fatal illness has been of long duration, and therefore\r\nonly traces of the poison may remain in the body, the whole of the\r\nliver, the spleen, and both kidneys should be secured. A portion of the\r\nblood, especially when the odour of any volatile poison is perceived,\r\nshould be at once put into a bottle, closed by a good cork or stopper.\r\n\r\n52. No person ought to undertake an analysis in a case of suspected\r\npoisoning unless he be either familiar with chemical researches, or\r\nhave previously analysed with success a mixture of organic substances,\r\ncontaining a small proportion of the poison suspected.\r\n\r\n53. All persons undertaking an analysis should bear in mind that the\r\nopinion of some other person practised in toxicological researches may\r\nbe required; and they should therefore take care, when practicable, to\r\nuse only a portion of the several articles preserved for analysis. The\r\nidentity of the subjects for analysis must be secured by the rules in\r\nSect. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Examination in Cases of Suffocation\r\n\r\n54. In cases of suspected drowning, the inspectors will observe\r\nparticularly whether grass, mud, or other objects be clutched by the\r\nhands, or contained under the nails; whether the tongue be protruded or\r\nnot between the teeth; state of the penis; whether any fluid, froth,\r\nor foreign substances be contained in the mouth, nostrils, trachea,\r\nor bronchial ramifications; whether the stomach contains much water;\r\nwhether the blood in the great vessels be fluid. Careful pressure\r\nshould be made upon the lungs; any fluid contained in them in thus\r\nforced into the bronchial tubes and trachea, and its nature observed.\r\nWhen water with particles of vegetable matter or mud is found within\r\nthe body, these must be compared with what may exist in the water in\r\nwhich the body was discovered, and should be preserved for further\r\nscientific investigation, if requisite. Marks of injuries must be\r\ncompared diligently with objects both in the water and on the banks\r\nnear it, and especial attention given to the question--whether any\r\nobserved injuries had been sustained by the body before or after death.\r\n\r\n55. In cases of suspected death by hanging, strangling, or smothering,\r\nit is important to attend particularly to the state of the face\r\nas to lividity, compared with the rest of the body; the state of\r\nthe conjunctiva of the eyes as to vascularity; of the tongue as to\r\nposition; of the throat, chin, and lips as to marks of the nails,\r\nscratches, ruffling of the scarf-skin, or small contusions; the\r\nstate of the blood as to colour and fluidity; the state of the\r\nheart as regards the amount of blood in its several cavities; the\r\nstate of the trunk and branches of the vena cava in the abdomen as\r\nregards distension with blood; and the state of the lungs as regards\r\ncongestion, rupture of any of the air cells, and small ecchymoses under\r\nthe pleura, or the pericardium. The mark of a cord or other ligature\r\nround the neck must be attentively examined; and here it requires to\r\nbe mentioned that the mark is often not distinct till seven or eight\r\nhours after death, and that it is seldom a dark livid mark, as is very\r\ncommonly supposed, but a pale greenish-brown streak, presenting no\r\necchymosis, but the thinnest possible line of bright redness at each\r\nedge, where it is conterminous with the sound skin. Nevertheless,\r\neffusions of blood and lacerations should be also looked for under and\r\naround the mark, in the skin, cellular tissue, muscles, cartilages, and\r\nlining membrane of the larynx and trachea. Accessory injuries on other\r\nparts of the body, more especially on the chest, back, and arms, must\r\nalso be looked for, as likewise the appearance of blood having flowed\r\nfrom the nostrils or ears, and the discharge of fæces, urine or semen.\r\nIn cases where death may be due to the emanations from burning fuel or\r\nother poisonous vapours, a small phial should be filled with the fresh\r\nblood, and securely corked for further investigation, if requisite.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Examination in Cases of Burning\r\n\r\n56. In supposed death by burning, the skin at the edge of the burns\r\nshould be carefully examined for redness, or the appearance of vesicles\r\ncontaining fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Examination in Cases of Criminal Abortion\r\n\r\n57. In suspected criminal abortion, when the woman survives, the chief\r\npoints for inquiry are: The proofs of recent delivery, the ascertaining\r\nof facts tending to show that she has been subjected to manœuvres with\r\ninstruments, and the occurrence of symptoms traceable to the action of\r\nany of the drugs reputed as capable of causing abortion.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman has died, the points requiring special attention at the\r\ndissection are: The state of the womb, as regards its size and the\r\ncondition of its lining membrane, in reference to the probable period\r\nof delivery; the condition of the intestinal canal, in reference to the\r\naction of irritant drugs; of the mucous membrane of the bladder, in\r\nreference to the action of cantharides; close inspection of the womb\r\nand vagina, in reference to mechanical injuries, especially punctured\r\nwounds; and any appearances that the death may have been caused by\r\ninflammation in the organs of the pelvis, or by bleeding from the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Examination in Cases of Infanticide\r\n\r\n58. In cases of suspected infanticide, certain specialities must be\r\nborne in mind. The cavity of the head should be laid open with a pair\r\nof scissors. In opening the abdomen, the navel should be avoided, so\r\nthat the state of the vessels of the navel-string may be examined\r\ncorrectly. This is done by carrying two incisions from the ensiform\r\ncartilage to each of the anterior superior spines of the ilia, and by\r\ndeflecting downwards the triangular flap thus formed.\r\n\r\n59. The inquiry in cases of infanticide should be conducted with\r\nreference to the five following distinct questions: (1) The probable\r\ndegree of maturity of the child? (2) How long it has been dead? (3)\r\nWhether it died before, during, or after delivery, and how long after?\r\n(4) Whether death arose from natural causes, neglect, or violence? and\r\n(5) Whether a suspected female be the mother of the child?\r\n\r\n60. The points to be attended to for ascertaining the probable degree\r\nof maturity of the child are: The general appearance and development,\r\nthe state of the skin, its secretions, and its appendages; the hair and\r\nnails; the presence or absence of the pupillary membrane; the length\r\nand weight of the whole body; whether the navel corresponds or not with\r\nthe middle of the length of the body; the situation of the meconium in\r\nthe intestines; the size of the testicles in the case of males, and in\r\neither sex the size of the point of ossification in the lower epiphysis\r\nof the thigh-bone. This is easily observed by making an incision\r\nacross the front of the knee into the joint, pushing the end of the\r\nthigh-bone through the cut, slicing off the cartilaginous texture\r\ncarefully until a coloured point is observed in the section, and then,\r\nby successive very fine slices, ascertaining the greatest diameter of\r\nthe bony nucleus. This does not exist previous to the thirty-sixth week\r\nof gestation, and in a mature child is about one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. Has the infant been washed? Absence or presence of vernix\r\ncaseosa. Nature and character of the wrappings, if any, found on the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n61. The points of chief importance in reference to the period which\r\nhas elapsed after death are those specified in the last clause of\r\nSect. 17--it being borne in mind that the bodies of infants are often\r\nconcealed in ash-pits and dunghills, and that in these circumstances\r\nputrefaction is very rapid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate.--Section through the epiphysis of the lower end\r\nof the femur showing ossification centre, in a full-term fœtus.]\r\n\r\n62. The circumstances which indicate whether the child died before,\r\nduring, or after parturition, and how long after it, are the signs\r\nof its having undergone putrefaction within the womb; the marks on\r\nthe crown, feet, buttocks, shoulders, &c., indicating presumptively\r\nthe kind of labour, and whether it was likely to have proved fatal to\r\nthe child; the state of the lungs, heart, and great vessels, showing\r\nwhether or not it had breathed; the nature of the contents of the\r\nstomach and of the intestines; the presence of foreign matters in the\r\nwindpipe; the state of the umbilical cord, or of the navel itself, if\r\nthe cord be detached.\r\n\r\n63. In order to examine properly the state of the lungs, heart, and\r\ngreat vessels, with a view to determine whether or not the child had\r\nbreathed, the inspection should be made in the following order: Attend,\r\nfirst, to the situation of the lungs; how far they rise along the sides\r\nof the heart; to their colour and texture; whether they crepitate or\r\nnot. Then secure a ligature round the great vessels at the root of the\r\nneck, and another round the vena cava above the diaphragm. Cut both\r\nsets of vessels beyond the ligatures, and remove the heart and lungs\r\nin one mass, which must be weighed and put into water, to ascertain\r\nwhether the lungs, with the heart attached, sink or swim. In the next\r\nplace, put a ligature round the pulmonary vessels, close to the lungs,\r\nand cut away the heart by an incision between it and the ligature.\r\nLastly, ascertain the weight of the lungs; whether they sink or swim\r\nin water; whether blood issues freely or sparingly when they are cut\r\ninto; whether any fragments swim in the instances where the entire\r\nlungs sink; and in every instance of buoyancy whether fragments of them\r\ncontinue to swim after being well squeezed in a cloth.\r\n\r\n64. The general question to be considered in relation to the cause\r\nof death is, whether the appearances are such as to be traceable to\r\nthe act of parturition, or whether they indicate some form of violent\r\ndeath. The directions given in Divisions V., VI., and VII. apply to\r\ninfants as well as adults; but the following points are specially to be\r\nnoticed in cases of supposed infanticide:\r\n\r\n    In relation to wounds and contusions, the possibility of\r\n        minute punctured wounds of the brain or other vital\r\n        organs; in reference to injuries of the head, the\r\n        effusion of blood under the scalp, not in the situation\r\n        where it could have been produced during labour, or\r\n        fracture of the bones not producible by compression\r\n        of the head during labour, and not connected with\r\n        defective ossification of the skull; in reference to\r\n        the allegation that the head was injured by the child\r\n        suddenly dropping from the mother, when not recumbent,\r\n        the presence of sand or other foreign matters on the\r\n        contused scalp, and the existence of more than one\r\n        injury of the head; in relation to suffocation, the\r\n        external and internal signs of this form of death--marks\r\n        of compression of the mouth, and nose, and throat, and\r\n        the presence of foreign matters in the mouth and throat,\r\n        air-passages, gullet, or stomach, especially if the\r\n        body be found in contact with similar substances; in\r\n        reference to bleeding from the navel-string, a bloodless\r\n        state of the body, without any wound to account for\r\n        it; in reference to poisons, most commonly narcotics,\r\n        the absence of any of the above appearances, with an\r\n        otherwise healthy state of the body; in reference to\r\n        starvation and exposure, emaciation of the body, absence\r\n        of food from the stomach, and an empty, contracted\r\n        condition of the intestines; in reference to the\r\n        possibility of the child having been suddenly expelled,\r\n        and having fallen on the floor or into privies, &c., the\r\n        state of the navel-string is to be noted--whether long\r\n        or short, whether remaining attached to the child and\r\n        connected with the after-birth, indicating rapid labour,\r\n        or, if divided, whether it had been cut or torn across.\r\n        Nature of the ligature used, if any.\r\n\r\n65. The circumstances noticed in Sects. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, compared\r\nwith the signs of recent delivery in the female, will lead to the\r\ndecision of the question whether the suspected female be the mother of\r\nthe child. These circumstances may be shortly recapitulated as being\r\nthe signs of the degree of maturity of the child--the signs on the body\r\nof the kind of labour, the signs which indicate the date of its death,\r\nand the interval which elapsed both between its birth and death, and\r\nbetween its death and the inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHUMATIONS\r\n\r\nIt becomes necessary sometimes to exhume the bodies of persons who have\r\nbeen buried. The cases which generally call for this always unpleasant\r\nproceeding are those where a suspicion of poisoning or violence has\r\narisen some little time after the burial of the supposed victim. Or\r\nthe necessity may arise to show that the body buried is that of a\r\nperson whose death it is absolutely necessary to prove. In the case of\r\nLivingstone, though this can scarcely be called a case of exhumation,\r\nyet an examination some months after death of the arm of the corpse\r\nalleged to be that of Livingstone, proved the existence of a badly\r\nunited fracture which the deceased was known to have had.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the exhumation, it is necessary that the medical experts\r\nshould be present to see the body removed from the coffin, and also\r\nany person or persons who may be in a position to speak as to the\r\nidentity of the corpse--as, for instance, those who dressed it and\r\nprepared it for burial. The person who made the coffin may also be of\r\nassistance to speak as to its identity. As soon as the medical men are\r\narmed with the proper authority, no time should be lost in order to\r\nget the body as fresh as possible, and at once prove or disprove the\r\naccusation of the crime, which, in the case of innocent persons, cannot\r\nbe too quickly removed. The best time to take up the body, if in the\r\nsummer, is early in the morning; and, in all cases, the examination,\r\nif possible, should be made during daylight. Everything necessary for\r\nmaking a medical inspection should be taken, and also a table on which\r\nto place the body. Rubber gloves should be worn. A pail containing a\r\nsolution of some disinfectant, for the inspectors to wash their hands\r\nafter the exhumation is finished, should be close at hand. And it is as\r\nwell to expose the body for a short time to the air before beginning\r\nthe inspection. There is seldom any risk to health in removing a single\r\nbody, yet certain precautions are necessary; thus it is as well to\r\nstand on the windward side of the corpse. Vaults should not be entered\r\nas soon as they are opened, but time allowed for their ventilation.\r\nCarefully note the amount of preservation of the coffin, and, if\r\nbroken, if any of the surrounding earth is in contact with the body.\r\nThis precaution is necessary in cases of suspected mineral poisoning\r\n(as in arsenic, &c.), and it is as well also to save one or two pounds\r\nof the earth immediately above the coffin for analysis. The body may\r\nthen be examined externally, any hair left on head or face preserved\r\nfor identification; and then an inspection of all the cavities made,\r\nthe contents of the stomach and bowels being placed in dry earthenware\r\njars or glass bottles, corked and capped with thin indiarubber skin,\r\nand so tied and sealed that the string must be cut or the seals broken\r\nin order to open them. The ends of the string should be sealed in the\r\npresence of the authorities. In the examination, the instructions\r\npreviously given should be carefully followed. All injured or diseased\r\nparts should be removed and preserved whenever this is practicable.\r\nSoft parts not intended for analysis may be preserved in a concentrated\r\nsolution of salt.\r\n\r\n=Beyond what Period is it useless to Exhume a Corpse=?--There is no\r\nscientific limit, for even the bones may show that violence has been\r\nused, or may point to the identity of a corpse, as in the case of\r\nLivingstone just mentioned. Pregnancy may be detected. The medical\r\ninspectors must proceed with the inspection unless they can positively\r\nsay that the progress of decay is such as to render the examination\r\nnugatory in relation to its special objects. Casper mentions the case\r\nof a man whose body was three times exhumed for different purposes. In\r\nScotland the law imposes a limit of twenty years, but in England the\r\nlaw is silent on the point; in France a limit of ten years from the\r\ndate of the supposed crime; and in Germany, the limit is thirty years,\r\nif the offence is that punishable with death, the time varying from\r\nthree to thirty years with the nature of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nASSAULTS, HOMICIDE, AND WOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Assault.=--Every act of attack upon the person of another is an\r\nassault in law, whether it injure or not; nor is it necessary that the\r\nact done take effect. Spitting on anyone is an assault. No provocation\r\nby word, whether written or spoken, can justify an assault, though it\r\nmay mitigate the offence. If a medical man unnecessarily strip a female\r\npatient naked, under pretence that he cannot otherwise judge of her\r\nillness, it is an assault if he himself take off her clothes (R. _v._\r\nRosinski, 1 Mood C.C. 12). So, where a medical man had connection with\r\na girl fourteen years of age, under the pretence that he was thereby\r\ntreating her medically for the complaint for which he was attending\r\nher, she making no resistance solely from the _bona fide_ belief that\r\nsuch was the case, this was held to be certainly an assault, and\r\nprobably a rape (R. _v._ Case, 1 Den. 580; 19 L.J. [M.C.] 174). Such an\r\nact is now held to constitute a rape.\r\n\r\n=Battery.=--This includes beating or wounding. A touch of the finger,\r\nhowever slight, is included under this term.\r\n\r\n=Homicide.=--In Scotch law homicide is held to be committed only where\r\na distinctly self-existent human life has been destroyed. Destruction\r\nof an unborn child, however short a time before delivery, may be\r\ncriminal, but is not homicidal. In the same country criminal homicide\r\nis divided into two classes:\r\n\r\n(1) Murder. (2) Culpable Homicide.\r\n\r\n1. _Murder_ is constituted in law by any wilful act causing the\r\ndestruction of human life, whether plainly intended to kill, or\r\ndisplaying such utter and wicked recklessness as to imply a disposition\r\ndepraved enough to be wholly regardless of the consequences. Murder may\r\nbe the result of personal violence, poison, or by the committal of some\r\nother serious crime, as where anyone causes the death of a woman in the\r\nattempt to procure criminal abortion, rape, or by the exposure of an\r\ninfant which results in its death. The use of weapons is not essential.\r\n\r\n2. _Culpable Homicide._--The name applied in law to cases where the\r\ndeath of a person is caused or materially accelerated by improper\r\nconduct of another, and where the guilt does not come up to the crime\r\nof murder:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Intentional killing of another in circumstances\r\n          implying neither murder on the one hand, nor justifiable\r\n          homicide on the other--_e.g._ if a person exceed\r\n          moderation in retaliation for an injury, or kill another\r\n          when the danger to which he was exposed is passed.\r\n\r\n         _Every charge of murder is held to conclude a charge of\r\n          culpable homicide, and the jury, if they see cause, may\r\n          find that culpable homicide only has been committed._\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Homicide, by the doing of any unlawful, or any\r\n          rash and careless act, from which death results, though\r\n          not foreseen as probable--_e.g._ using firearms in\r\n          a public street, &c.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Homicide, resulting from negligence or rashness\r\n          in the performance of a lawful duty--_e.g._ a\r\n          signalman on a railway forgetting to alter the points,\r\n          and thus causing a collision, and loss of life. In\r\n          England this would amount to manslaughter.\r\n\r\n=Justifiable Homicide.=--Self-defence; hanging a prisoner properly\r\nsentenced to death; killing another to prevent murder, if prevention\r\ncan avail in no other way. In self-defence, the person killing must be\r\nin _reasonable dread_ of death at the hand of his adversary.\r\n\r\nIn England there is--1. Murder; 2. Manslaughter; 3. Justifiable\r\nHomicide.\r\n\r\nMurder, according to Lord Coke (3 Inst. 47), is constituted “where\r\na person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully killeth any\r\nreasonable creature in being, and under the King‘s peace, with malice\r\naforethought, either expressed or implied.”\r\n\r\nIn England the killing must be committed with malice aforethought.\r\nMalice may be expressed or implied.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland malice aforethought is not necessary (5 Irv. 525, and 40\r\nS.J. 92, and 5 S.L.R. 20).\r\n\r\nThe law in both countries appears to differ more in terms than in\r\npractice. In England, if an injured party live for one year and a day,\r\nand then die, death is not attributed to the injury; but in Scotland,\r\nalthough no definite time is fixed, yet no case would I believe\r\nbe entertained at any lengthened period after the commission of a\r\nhomicidal act. The longest interval, according to Taylor, at which\r\nconviction has taken place from indirectly fatal consequences was _nine\r\nmonths_.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as a rule, the crime of murder admits of two\r\ndegrees: in the _first_, where the act is intentional or is the result\r\nof an attempt at burglary, rape, arson, or by poison; otherwise the\r\ncrime falls under the _second_ degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS\r\n\r\n=Legal Definition.=--According to the statute (24 and 25 Vict. c. 100,\r\nsec. 18), the word “wound” includes incised, punctured, lacerated,\r\ncontused, and gunshot wounds. But to constitute a wound within the\r\nmeaning of the statute, the _whole skin_, not the mere _cuticle_, or\r\nupper skin, must be divided (R. _v._ M‘Laughlin, 8 C. & P. 635). But\r\na division of the _internal_ skin, _e.g._ within the cheek or lip, is\r\nsufficient to constitute a wound within the statute (R. _v._ Warman,\r\n1 Den. C.C. 183). If the skin be broken, the nature of the instrument\r\nwith which the injury is inflicted is immaterial, for the present\r\nstatute extends to wounding, &c., “_by any means whatsoever_.” A wound\r\nfrom a kick with a boot is within the statute (R. _v._ Briggs, 1 Mood\r\nC.C. 318). Injuries, burns, and scalds--which, in accordance with the\r\nabove definition of a wound, are not wounds--are provided for under\r\nthe clause, “or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person.”\r\n\r\nCasper defines “an injury” to be “every alteration of the structure\r\nor function of any part of the body produced by any external cause.”\r\nTaylor proposed the following as the best definition which can be given\r\nto the word “wound,” whether in a medical or legal sense, viz. that\r\nit is “a breach of continuity in the structures of the body, whether\r\nexternal or internal, suddenly occasioned by mechanical violence.”\r\nThis would include dislocations, fractures, either simple or compound,\r\ninjury to the skin or mucous membrane, and to internal organs. Burns\r\nand injuries due to the action of corrosives are excluded from the\r\ncategory of wounds.\r\n\r\n=Concerning Wounds in general.=--Great care must be taken to ascertain\r\nthe exact site and course of the injury on the body, as this precaution\r\nwill greatly assist in answering the questions: _Is the wound dangerous\r\nto life?_ _Does it cause grievous bodily harm?_ _Is it suicidal, that\r\nis, inflicted by the person on himself; or homicidal, inflicted by\r\nanother?_ The solution of the question of the dangerous character of\r\nthe wound is left to the professional knowledge of the witness, who may\r\nbe required to state his reasons for considering the wound dangerous\r\nto life. His mere assertion will not be accepted. “The safest course,”\r\nsays Elwell, “for the witness, in regard to all these questions, is to\r\ngive a true and plain account of the wound, describing it minutely,\r\nand the probable consequences that may attend it.” In relation to\r\ntheir danger to life (apart from so-called “simple” wounds which are\r\nnot usually extensive, heal easily, and cause little trouble in their\r\ncourse), wounds may be considered dangerous to life when they are so\r\nextensive, or on account of their position and relation to important\r\nstructures when they would prove fatal without the intervention\r\nof surgical skill; and when the danger is _imminent_. A _mortal_\r\nwound is one which is rapidly followed by death. Wounds, however,\r\nwhich in themselves could not be regarded as dangerous to life, may\r\nbecome so by intercurrent complications, such as erysipelas or other\r\ninfective process. As a general rule, only those wounds in which the\r\ndanger to life is _imminent_ should be stated as dangerous to life.\r\nCompound fracture of the bones of the cranium, injury to any large\r\narterial trunk, or to any of the internal organs, may be considered as\r\n“dangerous to life”; but where the danger is more remote, as in the\r\nprobable supervention of tetanus, erysipelas, &c., the medical opinion\r\nmust be more guarded. But the medical witness should always bear in\r\nmind that death may follow the slightest injury. A case is recorded of\r\ndeath in forty-eight hours after extraction of a tooth. The contrary\r\nalso holds good, for the most fearful injuries have been followed with\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions may help the practitioner in the formation of\r\nhis opinion as to the probable danger of a wound:\r\n\r\n    1. The extent of the injury. 2. The character of the\r\n    instrument used in the infliction of the wound. 3. The\r\n    violence suffered by the parts. 4. The size and importance\r\n    of the blood-vessels and nerves injured. 5. Is the wound\r\n    healing or likely to heal well, and is the constitutional\r\n    disturbance severe or slight? 6. Age of the sufferer. 7.\r\n    Is there any constitutional taint likely to render even a\r\n    slight wound more severe, or even dangerous to life? 8. Has\r\n    the previous medical treatment been skilful or otherwise?\r\n\r\nShould the injured party be found dead, a careful _post-mortem_\r\nexamination will alone determine the probable part the injury bore in\r\nthe production of the fatal result.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoints of Importance to be Noticed in Examination of a Dead Body found\r\nWounded.\r\n\r\n1. Note situation, extent, depth, breadth, length, and direction of\r\nwound. Take careful measurements, in order to determine the character\r\nof the weapon, and the organs of the body injured.\r\n\r\n2. Is there any appearance of ecchymosis, or is the effused blood\r\nliquid or coagulated?\r\n\r\n3. Examine wound as to presence of pus, adhesive inflammation,\r\ngangrene, or foreign bodies.\r\n\r\n    _Why?_ Presence of pus, &c., will show that death must\r\n        have taken place some time after the wound was inflicted.\r\n\r\n4. In all examinations of wounds, be careful to disturb as little as\r\npossible their outward appearance, in order to compare the wound with\r\nthe suspected weapon.\r\n\r\n5. All notes should be taken during such examination, or _immediately_\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n6. Make a careful examination of all the important organs of the body.\r\n\r\n    _Why?_ In order to disprove the suggestion that death\r\n        was due to other causes--poison, disease, &c. This is\r\n        important, as in the case of a girl who, dreading a\r\n        whipping, swallowed some arsenic, from which she died,\r\n        yet her father was tried for causing her death by the\r\n        severity of his punishment.\r\n\r\n7. Only facts should be stated in the Report; _no inferences_ should be\r\ndrawn or suggested.\r\n\r\n8. In describing the appearance of wounds use _simple untechnical\r\nlanguage_, and avoid superlatives and high-flown words to describe and\r\nexplain simple facts.\r\n\r\n9. In gunshot wounds, note position of body, state and contents of the\r\nhands, and the direction of the wound in relation to external objects.\r\n\r\nNote also in all kinds of wounds the relationship of the wound to cuts\r\nor rents in the clothes of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES OF SPECIAL REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nInjuries of the Head and Spine\r\n\r\nThese may be either _external_, affecting the integuments; or\r\n_internal_, affecting the brain substance, &c. In the latter, as a\r\nrule, there are signs of external violence. An ecchymosed tumour of\r\nthe scalp may impart a _sensation of crepitation_ to the finger, and\r\nmay thus be mistaken for a fracture of the skull. The tumour may also\r\npulsate if any large vessel be near it, giving one the idea that\r\nthe pulsations are due to the movements of the brain. A large wound\r\nwithout fracture points to a more or less oblique blow, a small wound\r\nto direct violence. A blow with a heavy blunt weapon may make a clean\r\nincised wound, and often in these cases the seat of the bruise does not\r\ncorrespond with the centre of the cut. Dr. Ogston mentions the case\r\nof a young lady on whom a cricket ball inflicted a wound across the\r\nforehead, immediately above, and of the length of, one of the eyebrows,\r\nwhich he could not distinguish from a wound by a cutting instrument.\r\nAll injuries to the head are more or less severe and dangerous, and\r\ngreat care is required in forming a prognosis with regard to the\r\nultimate effect of an injury to the head. Inflammation of the brain\r\ndoes not, as a rule, supervene for about a week after the accident, and\r\npatients should not be considered safe from danger till two or three\r\nweeks after. Be it remembered also that in some cases the inflammatory\r\naction may proceed insidiously for some months without giving any\r\ndistinct evidence of its presence till close upon a fatal termination.\r\nScalp wounds are dangerous, from erysipelas, &c. They should be\r\nexamined as to their extent, form, depth, and position.\r\n\r\n_Concussion_ of the brain may arise from falls on the nates, or from\r\nblows on the head. The face becomes pale, the pupils contracted, the\r\npulse weak and small, the extremities cold, the respiration scarcely\r\nperceptible, and the sphincters relaxed. The tendency to death is from\r\nsyncope. Reaction may then occur: the pulse quickens; the skin is hot\r\nand dry; there is great confusion of thought, from which the patient\r\nultimately recovers; vomiting is present in most cases. Concussion\r\noften passes into compression, due to hæmorrhage from the lacerated\r\ncerebral vessels. Concussion and compression differ in this: in the\r\nformer, the effects are instantaneous; in the latter, a short time\r\nelapses before the symptoms make their appearance; and these become\r\nmore and more marked, whereas in concussion they gradually pass\r\noff. It is often a difficult matter to distinguish the effects of\r\ncompression from those common to drunkenness or narcotic poisoning.\r\nThe odour of the breath and the history of the case will assist in\r\nforming an opinion. Concussion of the brain may prove fatal without\r\neither fracture of the skull, effusion of blood within the cranium, or\r\nany other change being observed on dissection, death being caused by\r\nthe shock given to the whole nervous organ, which, being unrelieved,\r\nspeedily lapses into annihilation of function.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of compression_--a full, strong, and often irregular or\r\nslow pulse; normal heat of surface; muscular relaxation; dilatation,\r\ncontraction, or inequality of the pupils; stertorous breathing, and\r\nparalysis--are not unfrequently retarded, and this consideration should\r\nrender the opinion very guarded. Bryant records a case (_Surgery_,\r\nvol. i. p. 216) in which a man was thrown out of a gig on to his head.\r\nAfter a short period of insensibility he walked for half an hour,\r\nand then gradually again became insensible, and ultimately died. A\r\nlarge clot was found over the left cerebral hemisphere, the blood\r\nevidently having flowed from the middle meningeal artery. The short\r\nperiod of insensibility probably arrested the flow of blood from the\r\nartery, which recurred on the sufferer walking. The structural form\r\nof the cranium may have much to do with the danger to be expected\r\nfrom blows--some skulls being thinner than others--and in a few rare\r\ninstances the fontanelles may not have become ossified during life.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of an unhealthy condition--atheroma--of the arteries of\r\nthe brain, or of disease of the heart, must be taken into consideration\r\nbefore venturing an opinion as to the tendency or ultimate cause of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated that the patient died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a\r\ndisease of old age, and seldom occurs in the young, although it is\r\njust possible it _might_ occur. The arteries should, in every case,\r\nbe examined for the presence or absence of disease. When violence is\r\nused, the effusion of blood is, as a general rule, on _the surface_ of\r\nthe brain; but two cases are given by Dr. Abercrombie of spontaneous\r\nbursting of a blood-vessel within the head, followed by effusion of\r\nblood _upon the surface_ of the brain. “An external injury, coexisting\r\nwith an extravasation of blood into the cerebral substance, does not\r\nnecessarily imply cause and effect. The previous condition of the\r\nbrain, or the outpouring of blood from diseased vessels, may, in fact,\r\nhave been the cause of the accident” (Hewett). When, however, blood is\r\nfound effused on the surface of the brain, especially between the dura\r\nmater and the skull, either beneath or opposite to an external wound,\r\nwe may reasonably infer that the hæmorrhage is due to a direct blow.\r\nHæmorrhage so severe as to produce dangerous pressure on the brain, as\r\na rule, comes from a rupture of the middle meningeal artery.\r\n\r\nHusband relates a case in the Edinburgh Infirmary in which there was\r\na large clot over the left frontal lobes, accompanied with aphasia\r\nand right hemiplegia, with no rupture of the middle meningeal artery,\r\nor any signs of external injury. The man had just left the cells on a\r\ncharge of drunkenness. The source of the hæmorrhage was not clearly\r\nmade out, but it seemed to be due to the rupture of an artery in\r\na pachy-meningitic patch. Blood may be found in the cavity of the\r\narachnoid in the great majority of severe injuries to the head, and\r\neven in trifling cases where least expected. Rupture of the venous\r\nsinuses may take place without fracture of the skull. I have met with\r\nthis in a fatality during a boxing match; a large effusion over the\r\nbrain, and especially in the temperosphenoidal fossa, taking place from\r\nrupture of the left lateral sinus at the junction with the superior\r\npetrosal; there was also a vertical hæmorrhage into the pons. The\r\neffused blood may, after a time, become changed, and form a false\r\nmembrane on the _parietal_ arachnoid, seldom on the _visceral_ surface.\r\nBlood cysts may even be formed, in the course of time, having all the\r\nappearances of a serous membrane. The blood may spread to parts remote\r\nfrom the seat of injury, and the extravasation does not always occur\r\nat the exact spot of the application of the blow, but often at a spot\r\ndirectly opposite. Two extravasations may be the result of one blow.\r\n\r\nFits of passion have been advanced as a cause of apoplexy, but\r\nthis cause is rare. _Fracture of the cranial_ bones may be due to\r\ncounter-stroke--_contre-coup_--or to falls on the nates, &c. Fractures\r\nof the skull are divided into two groups (Körber): (1) those produced\r\nby _bilateral_ compression of the skull; and (2) those resulting from\r\nviolence applied to _one side_ only. _In both groups the line of\r\nfracture runs parallel with the axis of compression._ Fissures of the\r\nbase from bilateral compression of the skull are always transverse.\r\nPunctured wounds of the cranium are always dangerous, but the patient\r\nmay survive many days. Dr. Bigelow, Professor of Surgery in Harvard\r\nUniversity, U.S.A., relates a case in which an iron bar, weighing\r\nthirteen and a quarter pounds, three feet seven inches in length, and\r\none inch thick, was driven through the head, followed by recovery, the\r\npatient only losing the use of the injured eye.\r\n\r\nContusion and laceration of the brain may occur from injuries to the\r\nhead, either at the seat of injury or by contre-coup at some other\r\npart. The contused area may exhibit local extravasation of blood,\r\nor in the diffuse form, extravasations may be multiple and also on\r\nthe surface. The symptoms are those of cerebral irritation, coma,\r\nor restlessness, paralysis, tonic or clonic spasms. In slight cases\r\nrecovery may follow, in others some degree of loss of mentality and\r\nparalysis may remain.\r\n\r\nThere is great danger of inflammatory complications. I have met with a\r\ncase of severe comminuted fracture of the skull with laceration of the\r\nbrain, the latter substance appearing on the surface of the scalp, with\r\nloss of brain substance, in a boy who made a complete recovery without\r\nany loss of intelligence or power following the injury.\r\n\r\nFor the detection of brain substance on weapons the microscope is alone\r\nreliable, and then only the cellular portion of the brain is of any use.\r\n\r\n_Injuries to the spinal cord_ may cause immediate death; cases,\r\nhowever, occur of life being prolonged for some days, or even longer,\r\nafter injury to the cord. The symptoms are progressive paraplegia and\r\nparalysis of the bladder and rectum, ending in death. Bedsores and\r\nseptic infection of the bladder and kidneys are complications which\r\nadd to the gravity of the condition. Spicula of bone in the cord,\r\ndislocation of the vertebræ, or extravasation of blood in the membranes\r\nof the cord, may be found after death. The presence of blood upon the\r\nspinal cord is not necessarily the result of violence, as hæmorrhage\r\nmay take place spontaneously. The spine should be examined in all fatal\r\ncases of supposed injury. Concussion of the spinal cord is a fertile\r\nsource of differences of opinion in railway cases. In no case should a\r\nhasty decision be given as to the probable future result to the patient\r\nfrom the injury.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _face_ are not generally dangerous, unless they penetrate\r\nthe brain. There is always the possibility of injury to the eye causing\r\ndetachment of the retina, or inflammation leading to blindness.\r\nPunctured wounds in the neighbourhood of the orbit may become septic\r\nand lead to secondary meningitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds of the Throat and Chest\r\n\r\nWounds of the _throat_ are more or less dangerous, due to the\r\npossibility of severe hæmorrhage, emphysema, and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _chest_ are dangerous, on account of the amount of the\r\nhæmorrhage which may take place, and the importance of the organs\r\nwhich may be injured. Death may result more from the mechanical action\r\nof the blood effused than from the depressing effect of the quantity\r\nevacuated. Penetrating wounds of the thorax injuring the lungs cause\r\nemphysema, pneumo-, pyo-, or hæmothorax, any of which may prove fatal;\r\npleurisy and pneumonia may occur. A fracture of the ribs may give rise\r\nto injury of the lung substance or to inflammation of its coverings.\r\nLaceration of the lungs may take place without fracture of the ribs.\r\nThe ventricles of the heart may be pierced, and yet life may be\r\nprolonged for one or two months, permitting of considerable locomotion\r\nduring that period (Briand et Chaudé, _Med. Leg._, vol. i. p. 511).\r\nWounds of the heart, however, are, as a rule, rapidly fatal. Rupture\r\nof valves may follow blows on the chest, and rupture of the heart may\r\noccur from crushes or violent blows. Rupture of the heart has taken\r\nplace during violent exertion, and this is more likely to occur when\r\nthe muscle is diseased. It is often difficult to make out the direction\r\nof the wound, as the lungs change their position during respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nInjuries of the Abdomen\r\n\r\nWounds of the _abdomen_, penetrating the intestines, although not\r\nnecessarily fatal, may cause death from peritonitis, due to the escape\r\nof the intestinal fluids. Rupture of the intestine may follow blows or\r\ncrushing; it is generally fatal from peritonitis unless early surgical\r\ntreatment is carried out. Hernia may also follow wounds of the abdomen.\r\nRupture of the liver is not of infrequent occurrence, and may occur\r\nwithout any external signs of the injury. The rupture is, as a rule,\r\nlongitudinal, transverse lacerations being rare. It is often followed\r\nby pneumonia if not rapidly fatal. The cœliac plexus may be much\r\ndamaged by a blow or kick on the stomach, especially if this organ be\r\ndistended with food, and death may result without leaving any trace of\r\nthe injury externally or internally. The bladder may be ruptured and\r\ndeath result from extravasated urine. Rupture of the bladder may occur\r\nfrom fracture of the pelvis without sign of external injury. Rupture of\r\nthe _kidney_ may be recovered from if slight, but when severe is fatal.\r\nRupture of the spleen is usually fatal, and is more likely to occur\r\nwhen enlarged from any cause. Coagulable lymph, the effect of a wound\r\nof a serous membrane, may be thrown out in twelve hours or less.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the abdomen may cause death by--\r\n\r\n    1. Shock; without lesion of the internal organs,\r\n    inflammation, or external signs of injury.\r\n\r\n    2. Hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\n    3. Lesion of the internal organs, but without inflammation.\r\n    Death in these cases seems to be due to depression of the\r\n    nervous system due to the intense pain following these\r\n    injuries.\r\n\r\n    4. By inflammation without lesion of internal organs.\r\n\r\n    5. Inflammation from lesion of internal organs.\r\n\r\n    6. Destruction of the natural functions of the organs, and,\r\n    as a result, malnutrition of the body.\r\n\r\n    Except in the first case, when death is instantaneous,\r\n    wounds of the abdomen are not as a rule immediately fatal.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _genital organs_ of the female may cause fatal\r\nhæmorrhage, which takes place from the plexus of veins which, in these\r\nparts, are devoid of valves. A kick from behind whilst the woman is\r\nstooping or kneeling may rupture the labial vessels and death supervene.\r\n\r\nBlows and kicks upon the abdomen do not often injure the non-gravid\r\nuterus, but during gestation may produce abortion and hæmorrhage. If\r\nthe pregnancy be advanced the uterus may be ruptured or the placenta\r\nseparated. Penetrating wounds either through the abdominal wall, or\r\nper vaginam in the attempt to procure abortion, cause hæmorrhage and\r\nperitonitis with septic infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF BONES\r\n\r\nUnless they implicate some special structure, such as the brain and\r\nmedulla, simple fractures are not considered dangerous to life. When\r\ncompound, they may be complicated with hæmorrhage and infective\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nCertain pathological conditions favour the spontaneous fracture of\r\nbones, or this occurrence with such slight violence as would not cause\r\nfracture in the normal may take place.\r\n\r\nIn old people bones are more liable to fracture from their brittle\r\ncondition. Liability to easy fracture occurs in the insane, in nervous\r\nlesions as locomotor ataxia and general paralysis of the insane,\r\nwhen the bones are the seat of new growths, in fragillitas ossium,\r\nosteopsathyrosis; in the latter disease I have seen the femur fracture\r\nby the weight of the leg while resting the foot on a cushion. The\r\nliability to fracture depends upon the proportion of organic and\r\ninorganic constituents. In disease, the latter may be reduced and\r\npredispose to fracture; in the young, the bones are more liable to\r\ngreenstick or incomplete fracture; and in the old, from excess of\r\ninorganic constituents causing brittleness.\r\n\r\nA medical man may be required to express an opinion as to whether or\r\nnot fractures are the result of direct violence, and especially when\r\nallegations have been made against attendants on the senile or insane.\r\n\r\nThe previous predisposing pathological conditions must always be taken\r\ninto account, and also the amount, if any, of repair that has followed\r\nin relation to the time the alleged violence took place.\r\n\r\nAs the condition of a fracture of the bone of a limb may become a\r\nquestion of considerable importance in medico-legal investigations,\r\nthe following brief account of the process of repair in fractures is\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n    _From the First to the Third Day._--The period of\r\n    inflammation and exudation. Ordinary signs of inflammation\r\n    and laceration of the parts. Blood will be found\r\n    extravasated round the fracture, also in the medullary canal\r\n    mixed up with the fat.\r\n\r\n    _From the Third to the Fourteenth Day._--Gradual\r\n    subsidence of inflammatory action and growth of the soft\r\n    provisional callus from the periosteum and surrounding\r\n    structures, and internally in the medulla, forming a\r\n    fusiform mass holding the broken ends of the bones together\r\n    with some degree of firmness. This becomes firmer and almost\r\n    cartilaginous in density. When the bones are kept immovable,\r\n    or are impacted, the provisional callus may not be formed.\r\n    In the case of the ribs the provisional callus is always\r\n    formed, and Dupuytren‘s “ring of provisional callus” is\r\n    constant. This may also occur in fractures of the clavicle.\r\n\r\n    _From the Fourteenth Day to the Fifth\r\n    Week._--Ossification of the provisional callus. The bone\r\n    is first soft and spongy till the conversion of the soft\r\n    callus is complete.\r\n\r\n    _From the Fifth Week to some Months after the\r\n    Injury._--Complete bony union of the fracture and\r\n    absorption of the provisional callus.\r\n\r\nAlthough the blood clot completely disappears from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the fracture at an early period, yet layers of dark\r\ncoagulum may often be found beneath the superficial fascia for four\r\nweeks or more after the accident (Erichsen).\r\n\r\nIt may be of importance to remember this in medico-legal inquiries.\r\nThe presence or absence of the signs of vital reaction will help to\r\ndistinguish fractures caused before or after death.\r\n\r\nA fracture taking place immediately after death cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom one immediately before death, but if a few hours after death, the\r\ndifferences are easily recognised, blood is not effused round the ends\r\nof the bones unless a large vessel be torn.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of bones for fracture in the living it is the duty\r\nof the examiner to have an X-ray plate taken of the injured bone,\r\nespecially if the seat of injury is in close vicinity to a joint.\r\n\r\nPrevious fractures are easily recognisable after death even when the\r\nbone does not show manifestations externally; on longitudinal section\r\nthe seat of fracture is rendered evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Wound Suicidal, Homicidal, or Accidental?\r\n\r\nAn attempt is made to answer this question by a consideration of the\r\nwounds in reference to their _position_, _nature_, _extent_, and\r\n_direction_.\r\n\r\nIn reference to their _position_ it has to be borne in mind that one\r\nperson may wound any part of the body of another, but that to the\r\nsuicide certain parts only are accessible, and they have a predilection\r\nfor wounding themselves in favoured regions; the front of the body\r\nand vital parts are chosen by the suicide, while wounds on the back\r\npoint to homicide. Suicidal wounds on the head are generally in front\r\nor lateral, and on the neck in front or to one side, in cutting the\r\nthroat. Accidental head injuries are more often on the vertex, and\r\nwhen there may be no history of a fall on the occiput, wounds in this\r\nsituation indicate homicide.\r\n\r\nSuicides may choose unusual regions, such as cutting of a large vessel\r\nas the femoral artery in Scarpa‘s triangle, or by a limited incision,\r\nthe carotid in the neck, the injury may be about the genitals, and the\r\npenis and scrotum have been amputated.\r\n\r\nAccidental injuries may occur on any part of the body, but most\r\ncommonly on exposed parts.\r\n\r\nThe _nature_ and _extent_ of the wounds does not afford much\r\nassistance; with the exception of contused wounds which are usually\r\nhomicidal or accidental, any other form of wound, particularly incised\r\nor punctured wounds, may be suicidal or homicidal, and with regard to\r\ngunshot wounds, much depends upon their position and extent. As a rule,\r\nthe suicide does not make several wounds, and the homicide may not only\r\ninflict several but of a greater severity than are necessary to carry\r\nout his purpose.\r\n\r\nSuicides, especially when insane, may wound themselves severely\r\nand cause great injuries by leaping from buildings or similar high\r\npositions. In some cases suicides have inflicted several and varied\r\nwounds on their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe _direction_ of suicidal wounds, when the person is right-handed,\r\nis generally from above downwards and inwards on the chest, and on the\r\nleft side. An upward direction points rather to homicide.\r\n\r\n=Cut throat wounds=, when suicidal and inflicted by the right hand, are\r\ngenerally oblique from left to right, beginning higher up than they\r\nend. They generally cross the thyroid cartilage, and the larger vessels\r\nmay escape; if made below the thyroid cartilage they are generally\r\nsmaller and horizontal. The skin is the last structure divided, and\r\nthere may be several so-called “tentative cuts.” It has been held\r\nthat when the large vessels are cut the suicide stops, but this is\r\nincorrect, as in some cases the wound has reached the spine and the\r\nvessels been quite severed. Suicides may try to decapitate themselves\r\nfrom behind, and failing this stab themselves. A homicidal cut throat\r\nwound, when made from the front with the right hand, commences on the\r\nright side and is carried to the left; they are often deep incisions to\r\nthe vertebræ and the tissues “undercut” at the ends. A homicidal cut\r\nthroat wound when made from behind the victim resembles a suicidal one.\r\nWhen wounds are present on the forearms, hands, and fingers, and if\r\nthere are injuries on other parts of the body also, the inference would\r\nbe that the hand wounds were received in guarding the throat or other\r\nefforts at defence from a homicidal attack.\r\n\r\n=Wounds produced by Firearms.=--To distinguish between suicidal,\r\nhomicidal, and accidental wounds is far from easy. If the weapon be\r\nheld hard up or close to the body, as in suicide, the skin and hair\r\nwould be scorched and blackened, as would probably the hand that held\r\nthe weapon, but this has not occurred in every case. The grasping\r\nof the firearm by the hand in cadaveric spasm is certain evidence\r\nof suicide, as this cannot be simulated by an assailant placing the\r\nweapon in the hand after death. Full investigation should be made by\r\nnoting the bullet track and surrounding objects which may have been\r\ngrazed in its course, in order to form a probable estimate of the\r\ndirection from whence it came. Bullet wounds in the back are usually\r\nhomicidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuties of a Medical Man When Called to Examine a Wounded Person\r\n\r\nThe surgeon should at once visit the wounded party, and proceed to\r\nexamine the injury, for if this be done before swelling occurs, he will\r\nbe better able to form an opinion of its nature, extent, and severity.\r\nIf the wound has been dressed, he should, if possible, obtain the\r\nattendance of the person who applied the dressings, and who would be\r\nable to describe their nature, and the dangers to be avoided in their\r\nremoval, should that be deemed necessary. In no case should a surgeon\r\nremove the dressings applied by a professional brother without his\r\npresence and assistance. The condition of the injured party should be\r\ncarefully noted, and a minute description of the wound written down at\r\nthe time. The statements of the bystanders are also useful and should\r\nbe noted. The procedure in the examination of the dead body has been\r\npreviously described (p. 60).\r\n\r\nAn important question here arises. Have the wounds found on the\r\nbody been produced during life or after death? The answer is beset\r\nwith difficulties, and considerable caution will be necessary, but\r\ntables will be given under the different kinds of wounds to assist\r\nthe diagnosis. Signs of vital reaction are important, as showing\r\nthe _ante-mortem_ infliction of the wound; but these may, to some\r\nextent, be removed by the action of water, as in cases where the body\r\nis found in a pond. Under these circumstances the evident signs of\r\ndrowning--water in the stomach, &c.--will assist the diagnosis. The\r\npresence of putrefaction also greatly obscures the diagnosis. The\r\npresence of coagulated blood between the edges of the wound is not a\r\ntrustworthy indication of the _ante-mortem_ infliction of the wound, as\r\nexperiment has shown that as long as the body remains warm coagulation\r\nmay take place. Coagulation even in contused wounds, effected before\r\ndeath, may be retarded from various unknown causes--disease, _e.g._\r\nscurvy; mode of death, _e.g._ asphyxia. The amount of hæmorrhage on\r\nor around the body is, other things being equal, a safe criterion as\r\nto the time when the wound was inflicted; if in considerable amount,\r\narterial blood points to _ante-mortem_ injury; the presence of venous\r\npoints blood to _post-mortem_ injury.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to record and photograph the body in position\r\nwhere found, and its relation to surrounding objects. Careful note\r\nshould be made of the surroundings and the character and presence\r\nof any blood-stains, footprints, &c. The question may have to be\r\nconsidered as to whether the body is in the place it was when the\r\nwounds were inflicted. Blood in any quantity in one place, and the\r\nbody found in another so seriously injured that locomotion would be\r\nimpossible, point to the body having been removed.\r\n\r\nSigns of a struggle, if any, should be recorded. If a weapon be found\r\nnear to the body, its position should be noted, and if in the hand,\r\nthe firmness of the grasp--cadaveric spasm--should be recorded. All\r\nclothing should be carefully examined, and the relation of cuts and\r\nbody wounds noted. All blood-stains on the clothing should be examined\r\nand described.\r\n\r\nMultiple bullet wounds denote homicide, but suicides have been known\r\nto inflict more than one wound. It is strong evidence of suicide if\r\nthe gun or pistol has burst by the explosion, as suicides have a\r\npredilection for overloading the weapon employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRETENDED ASSAULT\r\n\r\nHow may wounds, alleged to have been the result of an assault, be shown\r\nto have been self-inflicted? This has to be done by considering:\r\n\r\n(1) The character of the wounds: in these cases they are generally\r\nslight, and may consist in a series of small, superficial wounds.\r\n\r\n(2) The parts of the body where they are, and those from which they are\r\nabsent. They are never found on vital parts, but always where there\r\nis little danger of doing harm. They are present on parts accessible\r\nto the individual. The hands are seldom wounded, and if they be, not\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n(3) The clothing may not be cut, and if it be, the cuts may not go\r\nright through, and if they do, they may not coincide with the position\r\nof the wounds. The person should be clothed in order to determine\r\nthis. Blood-stains on the cuts in the clothing may be erratic in\r\ndistribution, some being on the inner layer only, some on the outer,\r\nand rarely soaking through all, pointing to the probability of its\r\nhaving been artificially applied.\r\n\r\nSuch self-inflicted wounds are usually produced for the purpose of\r\nbringing a fictitious charge of assault, feigning self-defence or\r\nprovocation on the part of the assailant when accused; and in order\r\nto divert suspicion, as in the case of a person who alleges he has\r\nreceived the injuries by an assailant who was committing robbery while\r\nhe himself is guilty of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF DEATH FROM WOUNDS\r\n\r\nWounds may prove fatal from results which are (1) =directly=\r\ndue to injury--_hæmorrhage_, _shock_, or _mechanical injury\r\nto some vital organ_, _e.g._ the heart or lung; or (2) =indirectly=\r\nfrom _complications_ which may supervene such as infective\r\nprocesses--erysipelas, tetanus, septic infections,\r\ngangrene,--exhaustion, or the effects of surgical operations; or (3)\r\n_malum regimen_ (_a_) on the part of the patient, (_b_) on the part of\r\nthe medical attendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Direct\r\n\r\nHæmorrhage.--Hæmorrhage may be profuse and cause rapid death if a\r\nlarge blood-vessel, more especially an artery, has been injured.\r\nThe hæmorrhage may take place internally, in which case it need not\r\nnecessarily be profuse; it will depend upon the position; a small\r\nhæmorrhage into the pericardium or in the brain may prove rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\nShock.--Death from shock is generally associated with severe injury,\r\neither a single one, or from several smaller injuries, any of which\r\nalone would not be expected to prove fatal. Death may occur from shock\r\nwhen the visible injury may be slight, as in blows over the heart\r\nand abdomen, the latter causing fatal syncope from dilatation of the\r\nsplanchnic vessels. Repeated lesser injuries as in flogging may cause\r\ndeath through shock; and fatal psychical shock may be caused by mental\r\nexcitement, as, for instance, in an encounter when no physical injuries\r\nhave been received.\r\n\r\nMechanical Injury to Viscera.--This causes rapid death, more especially\r\nwhen the viscus injured, as the heart or medulla, is necessary for\r\nthe immediate functions of life; injuries to other organs may not be\r\nfollowed by immediate death unless very severe and with great shock. A\r\nwound of the lung may not be followed by death for some time.\r\n\r\nIn a healthy person the violence necessary to prove fatal ought to\r\nbe greater than in one diseased, and pathological conditions may be\r\nfound _post-mortem_, which were pre-existent to the injury, _e.g._\r\ndegeneration of blood-vessels, aneurysm, valvular disease of the heart,\r\nphthisical cavities which may have bled, gastric ulcer which may have\r\nruptured. Such conditions might influence the findings of a jury, as,\r\nfor example, it is not always possible to form the opinion that death\r\nhas been directly due to violence when signs of injury are slight; a\r\nman may receive a blow on the head while in the act of falling in a\r\nfight, and _post-mortem_ a cerebral hæmorrhage be found with diseased\r\nvessels, when it would be difficult to say with certainty that the\r\nhæmorrhage was directly caused by the blow or preceded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Indirect\r\n\r\nFatal Complications.--In English law if death follow injury inflicted\r\nby a person within a year and a day, the assailant may be tried and\r\npunished; beyond that time the person is not held responsible for the\r\ndeath. The infective processes mentioned above may supervene at any\r\ntime during the course of wounds with fatal result. Further, as a\r\nresult of altered conditions left by injuries which in themselves have\r\nnot proved fatal, and from the immediate effects of which the person\r\nhas recovered, fatal complications may follow, _e.g._ a person may have\r\nreceived an abdominal wound which after healing may become the seat of\r\nhernia which may strangulate; or an injury to the spinal cord, which\r\nmay cause death at a late date from bedsores and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nSeptic Processes.--These may cause death at an early date according to\r\ntheir nature and virulence and the power of resistance of the person.\r\nIn such cases the original injury need not have been dangerous to life.\r\nIn other cases the infection may persist after the wound has healed, as\r\ninfective endocarditis might conceivably do.\r\n\r\nSurgical Operations.--Should a surgical operation be considered\r\nnecessary for the treatment of the injury or in order to save life, and\r\nthe person dies after it, the prisoner will be held responsible for the\r\ndeath. This holds good if the operation has been done in good faith and\r\nperformed with reasonable skill and care. If, however, it can be shown\r\nthat the operation was unnecessary, or performed unskilfully and death\r\nresulted, the prisoner would not be held responsible unless it can\r\nbe proved that the injury apart from the operation could have caused\r\ndeath, when the jury might convict.\r\n\r\nWhere from improper treatment of an injury an operation is called for\r\nbecause of the improper treatment and the person dies, the prisoner\r\nwould not be held responsible. The main points to be considered in\r\nreference to surgical operations for criminal injuries are:\r\n\r\n    (1) The operation must be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n    (2) The operator must have acted with reasonable skill and care.\r\n\r\n    (3) That the wound was dangerous to life, and without operation\r\n        would most probably have proved fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Malum regimen\r\n\r\n(_a_) On the part of the Person Injured.--If the wound is not in itself\r\nsufficient to cause death, but by negligence in the care of it by\r\nthe injured person, complications arise which cause death, then the\r\npunishment would probably be mitigated; but in law a person accused\r\nof criminally injuring another is held responsible for the immediate\r\nand remote results. “No man is authorised to place another in such a\r\npredicament as to make the preservation of his life depend merely on\r\nhis own prudence.” If, however, it can be proved that death was largely\r\ndue to the imprudence or recklessness of the deceased, it is probable\r\nthat this would lessen the punishment.\r\n\r\n(_b_) On the part of the Doctor.--A person accused of criminally\r\ninjuring another being held responsible for the results immediate and\r\nremote, may plead that the latter, _i.e._ complications, or the death\r\nitself are not due to the injury directly, and endeavour to throw the\r\nresponsibility on someone else, either the injured person through\r\nnegligence, or on the doctor for unskilful treatment. In reference to\r\nthe complications, the medical witness may be asked for his opinion as\r\nto the cause and effect of the complication, and how it might have been\r\navoided. Having considered all the facts laid before him and made his\r\ndeductions, he must give his opinion fairly, and leave it to the Court\r\nto decide in what way his opinion may influence its judgment and the\r\namount of punishment for the offence.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an allegation that the treatment has been unskilful or\r\nnegligent, and contributory to complications and death, and a defence\r\nraised accordingly, the prisoner has to prove this to the satisfaction\r\nof the Court in order to mitigate the offence and punishment. The\r\nmedical man is expected to have exercised reasonable skill. If the\r\nperson treating the injury is a registered medical practitioner, and\r\nhas applied his treatment in good faith and for cure, even if the\r\ntreatment were improper, the assailant would be held responsible.\r\n\r\nThe care which the medical man ought to exercise is that which everyone\r\nought to exercise who has received the statutory education and passed\r\nthe statutory examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVERAL KINDS OF WOUNDS\r\n\r\n(1) Incised; (2) Punctured; (3) Lacerated and Contused; and (4) Gunshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Incised Wounds\r\n\r\nMade by sharp instruments.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Incised wounds are somewhat spindle-shaped,\r\ntheir superficial extent being greater than their depth; the edges are\r\nsmooth and slightly everted, and the wounds are always larger than the\r\nweapon which inflicted them--due to retraction of the divided tissues.\r\nIf a wound be in a line with the fibres of a muscle, there will be\r\nless “gaping” than when the wound is directly or obliquely across the\r\nmuscle. From muscular contraction, or the elasticity of the skin, an\r\nincised wound may assume a crescentic form. The cellular tissue is\r\ninfiltrated with blood, and coagula are found at the bottom and between\r\nthe edges of the cut. It must be borne in mind that a wound with smooth\r\nedges may be made by a _blunt_ weapon over bones near the surface,\r\nas on the scalp and over the tibia or shin, but a certain amount of\r\ncontusion may, in most cases, be detected by careful inspection a short\r\ntime after the receipt of the injury.\r\n\r\nIt is often of importance to distinguish where the weapon entered, and\r\nwhere it was drawn out. The end where the weapon entered is usually\r\nmore abrupt than the other, which is naturally more drawn out. But in\r\nsome cases I have seen, when the weapon was simply drawn across the\r\npart, both ends of the wound alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Punctured Wounds\r\n\r\nThe orifice is generally a little smaller than the weapon.\r\n\r\nA stab may sometimes present the appearance of an incised wound; the\r\ndepth will, however, help to distinguish the one from the other. The\r\nwound may not at all correspond with the shape of the weapon, and the\r\nsame pointed instrument may produce very different-shaped wounds in\r\ndifferent parts of the body. Much depends upon the movement of the\r\ninstrument in the action of puncturing; in the case of a double-edged\r\ninstrument the wound will most probably be fusiform or diamond-shaped.\r\nWhen made with a knife the wound may be wedge-shaped if the knife have\r\na thick back. A circular weapon splits the skin and leaves a slit;\r\nbroken glass and pottery act in a similar way, but the wounds may\r\nhave jagged edges and show signs of contusion in them. On dissection,\r\ntwo or more punctures may be found in the soft parts, with only one\r\nexternal orifice; these are due to the weapon being only partially\r\nwithdrawn at each stab. Punctured wounds are always more dangerous\r\nthan incised. They cause little, if any, hæmorrhage externally, unless\r\na large vessel, such as the femoral artery, be injured, but they may\r\ncause internal hæmorrhage or penetrate a viscus, _e.g._ the lung or\r\nheart. These wounds generally heal by suppuration, and not infrequently\r\nan abscess is formed in and around the track of the wound. Perforating\r\nwounds generally have a large entrance wound with inverted edges, and a\r\nsmall exit with everted edges; if the weapon be rough, the reverse may\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Lacerated and Contused Wounds\r\n\r\nThe edges of these wounds are never smooth, and generally do not\r\ncorrespond at all with the weapon. A considerable amount of contusion\r\nor bruising surrounds the solution of continuity of the part.\r\nHæmorrhage from these wounds is usually slight. A point of considerable\r\ninterest may arise in connection with this class of wounds; the defence\r\nmay declare that the injury was the result of a fall, and not due to\r\na blow. The history of the case, and the presence of a bruise where\r\nno theory of a fall can explain its existence, will often afford the\r\nonly solution of the difficulty. Lacerated wounds heal by suppuration,\r\ngenerally with more or less sloughing, and leave a permanent scar.\r\nScratches with the finger-nails may be considered as lacerated wounds,\r\nbut the skin is merely abraded, not divided. They are never important\r\nas wounds, but often as a proof of a struggle in cases of rape, &e.\r\nBites are also lacerated wounds. The diagnosis of lacerated and\r\npunctured wounds, whether inflicted before or after death, will depend\r\non much the same grounds as those of incised wounds, hæmorrhage, vital\r\nreaction, &c.\r\n\r\nTable of Differentiation Between Ante-mortem and Post-mortem Wounds:\r\n\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                             Incised Wounds.\r\n    -----------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n               IN THE LIVING.          |           IN THE DEAD.\r\n                                       |\r\n    1.

Gunshot Wounds\r\n\r\nThe appearance which gunshot wounds present will to a great extent\r\ndepend upon the form of the projectile, and the distance at which the\r\nfirearm was discharged. Round halls make a larger opening than conical.\r\nSmall-shot, fired within a short distance of the body, make one large\r\nragged opening. The scattering of the shot depends on the calibre of\r\nthe gun, on the charge of powder, and essentially on the distance.\r\nA charge of ordinary (No. 5) shot, to make a single hole, must have\r\nbeen fired at less than _one foot_; but experiments should always be\r\nmade with the alleged weapon. A patent cartridge would make a single\r\nhole at a considerable distance--five or six yards. Round bullets may\r\nsplit, but the conical ones seldom do. The edges of wounds produced\r\nby the discharge of firearms are always more or less ecchymosed; this\r\ncondition appears in about an hour after the infliction of the injury.\r\nIf the ball strikes obliquely, the edges of the wound may be much\r\nlacerated, or the opening may be valvular and of small size, if the\r\nskin over the part be in any way tightened, or if a conical ball has\r\nbeen used. The injury to bones is greater from conical than from round\r\nballs. The old round balls were easily deflected; the conical are not\r\nso easily turned aside. The track of the ball _widens as it deepens._\r\nThis is the reverse of an ordinary punctured wound. The ball may either\r\nlodge in a part, or perforate it. Should it have lodged, it must be\r\npreserved and compared with the alleged firearm. Bits of clothing or\r\nwadding may be carried into the wound. The latter should be carefully\r\nkept, as they may prove important as a means of identification.\r\n\r\nThe aperture of entrance and exit must, if possible, be determined. On\r\nthis point there is much difference of opinion. The wound of _exit_\r\nis always _smaller_ than the wound of _entrance_ (Casper). In this\r\nopinion Casper agrees with M. Malle, Olliver d‘Angers, and M. Huguier,\r\nbut is opposed by Taylor, M. Matthysens, and others. “The characters\r\nof a gunshot wound,” says Assistant-Surgeon Neill, “are those of a\r\ncontusion and laceration of all the tissues. Sometimes they are so\r\nsimple as to bear resemblance to a punctured wound, particularly if a\r\nrifle-ball (conoidal), revolving on its long axis, has passed through\r\nthe soft parts at a great speed, but within a few hours it resembles\r\na contusion. The wound of entrance, as it has been termed, bears no\r\ncomparison in size or shape to that of the exit when a rifle-ball has\r\ncaused the injury. In the former you see the edges of the wound curving\r\ninwards, and the circumference small, with little or no hæmorrhage.\r\nIn the latter, the wound is large, with torn and irregular edges\r\nprojecting outwards, and perhaps only slight oozing of blood. In a\r\nshort time, averaging an hour, round the entrance wound slight redness\r\nbegins, gradually extending to about two inches round its orifice.\r\nAgain, this colour changes to a blue- or greenish-black, and you see\r\nall the appearances of a severe bruise, with a small wound of the skin,\r\nits edges still curved inwards. In the exit wound the discoloration of\r\nthe skin is not apparent.” The probable reason for the discrepancies in\r\nthe statements of observers, as to the characters of entrance and exit\r\nwounds, may be found in the fact that experiments have been conducted\r\nwith different-sized balls, different kinds of weapons, with varying\r\nquantities and qualities of the powder used, the character of the wads,\r\nand with varying velocities and distances. As pointed out by M. Roux,\r\nthe two openings may be equal if the ball preserves the same velocity\r\nthrough the tissues as it possessed before entrance; the _entrance_\r\nhole is smaller than the _exit_, when the ball has lost much of its\r\ntrajectile force, and enters the softer parts of the body first; the\r\n_entrance_ is larger than the _exit_, when the ball first enters\r\nthrough the denser tissues of the body, and leaves through the softer.\r\n\r\nThe opening of entrance made by the ball has generally, but by no means\r\nalways, inverted edges. The edges of the exit opening are everted,\r\nbloody, and raw; but both the entrance and exit wounds may be everted\r\nin fat persons, due to the protrusion of the fat; and this eversion\r\nmay also result from the expansive power of the gases generated during\r\nputrefaction, should this condition be present. Wounds made by _double\r\nshots_, as from double-barrelled guns, or pistols, or from slugs fired\r\nfrom one barrel, diverge after their entrance into the body.\r\n\r\nObservations during the war in South Africa threw fresh light upon the\r\nresults of gunshot wounds produced by modern projectiles. Of wounds\r\nproduced by the Mauser bullet, one correspondent (_The Physician and\r\nSurgeon_, 1900, p. 49) states that “the aperture of entrance seldom\r\nshows any bruising of surrounding tissue; frequently it has been\r\ndifficult to locate it, for where the skin is dense and elastic, there\r\nis seldom any bleeding. There is never any inversion of the edges,\r\nwhich are sometimes circular in form, and sometimes triangular like\r\na leech-bite. The aperture of exit, where the bullet has not been\r\ndistorted, is seldom any larger than that of entrance; there is no\r\nbruising of surrounding tissue, and no eversion of the edges; bleeding\r\nvaries, of course, in accordance with the proximity of large, medium,\r\nor small blood-vessels in the track, but in the vast majority of cases\r\nit is slight.”\r\n\r\nThe late Sir William MacCormac, quoted by Sir William Stokes (_B. M.\r\nJ._, vol. i., 1900, p. 1453), says: “I saw a large number of injuries\r\ninflicted by the Mauser bullet, which is remarkable for the small\r\nwound it produces. In three-fourths, if not a larger proportion, it\r\nwas impossible to tell the exit from the entrance wound, they were so\r\nsimilar in appearance.”\r\n\r\nIn the examination of gunshot wounds we have to consider--\r\n\r\n1. _Direction in which the Gun was fired._--The track and position of\r\nthe ball in the body, coupled with the relative position of the body\r\nto a window or door through which the gun may have been discharged,\r\nand the place where the ball is found, should it have passed through\r\nthe body, may assist us in forming an opinion. It is often impossible\r\nto trace the course of the ball through the cavities of the body,\r\nbut through the muscles and denser structures this is more easily\r\naccomplished. The effects of the ball on surrounding objects may assist\r\nvery much in finding the direction of its course. Sir Astley Cooper,\r\nby a careful consideration of the above suggestions, once correctly\r\ndetermined that a left-handed man had fired the fatal shot.\r\n\r\n2. _Distance at which the Charge was fired._--In the case of wounds\r\ninflicted by a small shot, the scattering of the shot must be our\r\nguide. Dupuytren has related a case in which a fowling-piece charged\r\nwith powder alone and fired at a distance of two or three feet from\r\nthe abdomen made a round hole in it and killed the man. If the weapon\r\nbe fired a short distance, _e.g._ a few inches from the body, the skin\r\nwill be scorched, smoke-blackened, and tatooed with powder, the flame\r\nmay singe the hair or clothing. If discharged quite hard up to the\r\nbody, the edges of the wound are freely lacerated, ecchymosed, and\r\nburnt. Smokeless powder will not cause blackening of the skin. The\r\nabsence of scorching, or marks made round the wound by the half-burnt\r\npowder, allows of the assumption that the shot must have come from\r\nsome distance--rather more than four feet. The absence of any of the\r\nabove, however, is not an absolute proof that the shot has come from a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThere is no means of deciding, from an examination of a pistol or\r\ngun, when the weapon was last used. In all cases, medical men, unless\r\nsportsmen and familiar with firearms, should hand over the weapon to a\r\ngamekeeper or gunsmith, and not attempt to give an opinion on matters\r\nabout which they know nothing. The following may be of use to students\r\nfor examination purposes, but for nothing else: Among the products\r\nformed when gunpowder is exploded is the sulphide of potassium, but if\r\nexposed to the air some portion of this substance is converted into\r\nthe sulphate of potash. If, then, the gun-barrel be washed out with\r\ndistilled water, and the washings filtered, and, on the addition of a\r\nsolution of acetate of lead, a black precipitate of sulphide of lead be\r\nformed, this is supposed to point to recent use; if, on the other hand,\r\na white precipitate of sulphate of lead forms, to the use of the weapon\r\nat some more distant date than the period alleged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBLOOD-STAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important in medico-legal investigations to determine the nature\r\nof stains found on clothes, weapons, articles of furniture, &c. In the\r\ncase of blood-stains note should be made of their incidence upon the\r\nbody or in its vicinity. Blood-stains may vary in their character,\r\nincidence, and magnitude, as sprays, spirts, or jets, smears of various\r\nforms, or pools of blood.\r\n\r\nNotes should be made of the relation of the direction of a spray\r\nof blood to the position of a wounded body when found. A plan with\r\nthe position of the stains should be sketched upon the spot, and\r\nmeasurements taken carefully.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of blood-stains the purpose of the medico-jurist is\r\nnot to demonstrate all the properties of blood, but to identify it.\r\nThere is not much difficulty in ascertaining whether stains are due\r\nto blood or not; but when the question arises as to whether the blood\r\nbe human or that of some other animal, the identification is more\r\ndifficult and less certain.\r\n\r\nBlood-stains vary in colour, according to the age of the stain, the\r\nquantity of blood in it--the thicker the stain the darker--and the\r\nnature and colour of the material upon which it is. Recent stains are\r\nreddish in colour, old stains brownish. This change of colour depends\r\nupon the free access of air and the presence or absence of chemical\r\nsubstances in the air, so that it is almost impossible to infer the\r\nage of a blood-stain by its colour. On dark-coloured materials the\r\nstains are rendered more visible by the aid of artificial light, such\r\nas candle-light; on light-coloured materials, on leather, wood, iron,\r\nand stone, they are more visible in good daylight. By reason of the\r\ncoagulation and the albuminous composition of blood, dry stains stiffen\r\nthe fabric when thin, and on thicker woollen materials the fine fibres\r\nbecome matted. On metals, such as iron or steel, they appear as dark\r\nshiny spots or smears, and when dried are often fissured or cracked.\r\nRust may so alter blood as to produce a difference between the stains\r\non the blade and handle of a knife. In quite recent blood-stains\r\nthe general appearances are sufficient to give rise to a conclusion\r\nas to their nature, especially if the stains are large. The general\r\nfeatures as seen by the naked eye are such that one may often recognise\r\nblood-stains as arterial by the _comet shape_ they retain when falling\r\nslantwise on an object. Venous blood is not spurted in small jets like\r\narterial, but blood from veins may become splashed upon objects and\r\nassume shapes similar to those produced from an arterial jet.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF BLOOD-STAINS\r\n\r\nThe examination of blood-stains should be carried out in the following\r\nway:\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Examination\r\n\r\n1. Examine the stains carefully with a good pocket lens or a low\r\npower microscope lens. A fabric will show matting of its fibres, red\r\nfilaments, and minute coagula in its meshes. In old blood-stains\r\ncoagula may be absent and the fabric appear as if dyed. The characters\r\nof any fibres or hairs adhering to the stain and the nature of the\r\nsubstance upon which the stain is should be noted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Photo-micrograph of wool fibres, × 250. (R. J.\r\nM. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n2. Make accurate notes of the position and shape of the stains on the\r\nmaterial examined.\r\n\r\n3. Take one stain, if there are several, or part if single, and note\r\nthe solubility of it in water, or in a mixture of water and some other\r\nsubstance. The solubility of the colouring matter is greater if the\r\nstain be recent than if it be old. The older the stain the less soluble\r\nit becomes, as the hæmoglobin is gradually changed in course of time to\r\ninsoluble hæmatin.\r\n\r\nAn endeavour should be made to obtain a solution for microscopical,\r\nchemical, and spectroscopical examination. The solvent, in order to\r\nobtain the blood corpuscles in as natural a form as possible, should\r\napproach in its specific gravity the _liquor sanguinis._\r\n\r\nThe following solvents fulfil this purpose:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Glycerine and water, 1 to 7 (sp. gr. 1030).\r\n    (_b_) Pacini‘s solution of chloral hydrate in water (1 in 10).\r\n    (_c_) Normal saline solution.\r\n    (_d_) Roussin‘s solution of glycerine 3 parts, sulphuric acid\r\n            1 part (by weight), and water so that the mixture shall\r\n            have a sp. gr. of 1028.\r\n    (_e_) Saturated solution of borax in distilled water.\r\n\r\nIf distilled water alone be used, the red corpuscles lose their\r\nhæmoglobin and become “laked” or “phantom” corpuscles; if the solution\r\nbe of higher sp. gr. than _liquor sanguinis_, then the corpuscles\r\nbecome crenated and irregular in shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Photo-micrograph of flax fibres, × 250. (R. J.\r\nM. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nThe technique of examination has to be varied in certain details,\r\naccording to the material upon which the stain is. Stains may have to\r\nbe examined upon cloth-fabrics, wood, plaster, metal, or leather. These\r\nwill be taken separately, and the methods of examination described\r\nwhich will prove most reliable in each case.\r\n\r\n1. _Cloth-fabrics._--Cut out a stain, or part of one, and macerate it\r\nin a quantity of one of the solvents mentioned above, sufficient for\r\nthe purpose. If the stain be very small, squeeze with fine forceps\r\none or more drops upon microscope slides for microscopic, and keep\r\nthe remainder of the solution for spectroscopic, examination. In dyed\r\nfabrics, which have been mordanted, the mordant may fix the blood-stain\r\nso as to prevent solution, and especially so when the attempts have\r\nbeen made to wash out the stain with soap and water.\r\n\r\nTo make a solution of the stain in such cases it is best to use\r\ndistilled water to which a small quantity of ammonia or citric acid has\r\nbeen added; in one or other of these the colouring matter will dissolve.\r\n\r\n2. _Wood._--Note the kind of wood, cut off a thin shaving and treat\r\nwith one of the solvents mentioned above. If on wood containing tannic\r\nacid, such as oak or elm, the best solvent is a two per cent. solution\r\nof hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n3. _Plaster._--Scrape off some of the stained plaster, and treat as for\r\ncloth or wood.\r\n\r\n4. _Metal._--If the stain be upon a clean and unrusted metal, _e.g._\r\nthe clean blade of a knife, then gently heat the metal on the side\r\nopposite to the stain, when the latter, if recent, will peel off or can\r\nbe easily detached. This requires some care and dexterity. It is easy,\r\nhowever, to scrape the stain off into a watch-glass, and this procedure\r\nis necessary when the metal is rusted and the stain mixed with the\r\nrust, or when the stain is thin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Photo-micrograph of silk fibres, × 250. (R. J.\r\nM. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nIf on iron and mixed with rust the borax solution may be used, with\r\na drop or two of solution of ammonia; use a fine camel-hair pencil\r\ndipped in the solution, and brush the stain off into a watch-glass.\r\nBecker advises that stains mixed with rust should be digested with a\r\nweak solution of ammonia and common salt for a few hours; decant the\r\nsolution and evaporate it upon a microscope slide to dryness, then test\r\nthe residue by the “hæmin test.”\r\n\r\nGanttner‘s test should be used to a portion of a stain upon metal when\r\nthin or mixed with rust. It may be carried out upon the metal itself\r\nor upon a scraping of the stain in a watch-glass resting upon a black\r\nsurface. Moisten the scraping in a watch-glass with a drop or two of\r\ndistilled water rendered feebly alkaline, then add a minute drop of\r\nhydrogen peroxide. Wherever blood is present bubbles of gas develop,\r\nwhich give the material a white beaded appearance. The froth develops\r\nfrom the outside of the drop towards the centre when the stain is\r\nmainly composed of blood. In a scraping consisting of mixed particles\r\nof rust and blood, the reaction only appears upon the particles of\r\nblood, and rust to which blood adheres; it does not take place on\r\nthose particles of rust free from blood. Before adding the peroxide of\r\nhydrogen it may be necessary to dissipate any air-bubbles which may\r\ncling to the scraping in the alkaline water by gentle agitation with\r\nthe point of a fine glass rod. Should the above reaction with peroxide\r\nof hydrogen not take place, then one can rest assured that no blood is\r\npresent. The test, however, is a negative one; it is not a positive\r\ntest for blood only; other fluids and exudations from the body, such as\r\nsaliva and pus, give the reaction. The reaction will take place with\r\nblood-stains of any age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Photo-micrograph of cotton fibres, × 250. (R.\r\nJ. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nIn examining a clasp-knife or any hinged weapon for blood-stains, the\r\ninstrument should be taken to pieces and all the hinges and recesses\r\ncarefully examined, for in these places blood may be found, although\r\nthe weapon had previously been wiped clean, and appear free from stains.\r\n\r\n5. _On Leather._--The tannic acid in leather forms a compound with\r\nblood which is insoluble in the solvents generally used. A thin shaving\r\nof the stained portion should be taken and folded, with the stained\r\nsurface outwards, in the form of a loop. If the outer surface of the\r\nloop with the stain be made to touch the surface of the glycerine and\r\nwater solution, at the same time taking care that the leather itself\r\nbe not moistened, a recent stain may yield a sufficient quantity of\r\ncolouring matter for the purposes of examination. Failing this, the\r\nshaving should be digested in a small quantity of a two per cent.\r\nsolution of hydrochloric acid in distilled water (Sorby).\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopical Examination\r\n\r\nThe microscopical examination of blood-stains, for the purpose of\r\nidentifying the presence of the red blood corpuscles, is especially\r\napplicable to recent stains. In these the corpuscles may retain, to a\r\ngreat extent, their normal characters; but their condition varies with\r\nthe age of the stain; they become altered in appearance and irregular\r\nin shape with increasing age, until a stage is reached when they\r\nbecome completely disintegrated and unrecognisable. Having obtained\r\na solution of a stain by one of the methods recommended, a few drops\r\nshould be placed upon a clean microscope slide and covered with a No. 1\r\ncover-glass. In a recent stain, where minute coagula are present, one\r\nmay be placed on a microscope slide and moistened by breathing upon it\r\nseveral times, and then covering it with a No. 1 slip, or a drop of the\r\nglycerine solution may be allowed to act upon it on the slide until\r\nit be sufficiently moistened, when it should be covered in the same\r\nway. The preparation should be examined through the microscope with a\r\ngood lens (preferably a ¹/₁₂th oil immersion), magnifying 300 to 400\r\ndiameters, and if any corpuscles be found, their characters should be\r\ncarefully observed and noted.\r\n\r\nAll such specimens should be carefully preserved and labelled with\r\na description of the method of preparation, the case to which they\r\nbelong, the date of preparation, and the signature of the individual\r\nwho has made and examined them. It is essential that the preparation\r\nand examination of the specimen should be made by the same individual.\r\nIn certain cases the conditions may be sufficiently favourable to allow\r\nof the production of stained specimens, which can be mounted so as\r\nto retain their original characters permanently. In every case it is\r\nadvisable to pursue the investigation with this object in view.\r\n\r\nThis process is especially applicable to recent blood-stains, in which,\r\nfrom preliminary examination, the presence of blood corpuscles has been\r\ndetermined; where complete disintegration of the blood corpuscles has\r\ntaken place it would not be of any value.\r\n\r\nIt may so happen that by means of stained specimens the identity of\r\nblood corpuscles may be more easily established, when the result of\r\nexamination is uncertain in a specimen not so prepared.\r\n\r\nBy the action of certain dyes upon the corpuscles their special\r\nfeatures are rendered easier of recognition. Any of the approved\r\nmethods of preparing blood films for general clinical purposes, which\r\nwill suit the circumstances, may be employed. An easy and reliable\r\nmethod is as follows. A drop of the solution of the blood-stain\r\nproperly prepared as previously recommended, or if obtainable a small\r\ncoagulum moistened with normal saline solution, is placed on a clean\r\ncoverslip and spread evenly over its surface with the aid of a fine\r\nglass rod. The film is allowed to dry in the air, covered with a\r\nwatch-glass for protection against dust. When dry it is passed three\r\ntimes through the flame of a Bunsen burner, or placed in a mixture of\r\nequal parts of absolute alcohol and ether, to fix it. After fixation it\r\nshould be placed for a minute or more in an aqueous solution of eosin.\r\n\r\nAny excess of stain should be removed by washing in distilled water,\r\nand the specimen allowed to drain by standing it on edge upon a\r\npiece of filter paper; it should then be allowed to dry, and then\r\ncounterstained with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of methylene\r\nblue, hæmatoxylin solution, or other nuclear dye. Wash again in\r\ndistilled water, allow to dry, and mount in Canada balsam. By this\r\nmethod the corpuscle will be stained pink, and if nucleated, the\r\nnucleus will be stained by the methylene blue, hæmatoxylin, or other\r\nnuclear stain which may have been used.\r\n\r\nLeishman‘s stain may be used. This stain being a methyl-alcohol\r\nsolution is used for fixing and staining at the same time. A few\r\ndrops of the stain is placed on the dried film; after standing until\r\nevaporation is almost complete, distilled water is dropped on to the\r\nslide, and left to stand for two or three minutes, it is then drained\r\noff, and a few more drops of distilled water added until the film is\r\npink in colour, then dried with filter paper. Red corpuscles are tinted\r\nred with the eosin, and nuclei of leucocytes or nucleated red cells\r\nviolet or deep blue. The specimen may be examined direct with the oil\r\nimmersion or mounted in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nWhen examining specimens prepared from blood-stains, it is necessary\r\nto search carefully for other cellular structures such as epithelial\r\ncells, spermatozoa, or fragments of hair.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable, in certain cases where the amount of material\r\nsubmitted for examination is small, to centrifugalise some of the\r\nsolution in a fine glass tube, in order to determine any cellular\r\nelements present to one spot. By making use of this concentrated\r\nportion containing the cellular elements for the preparation of a\r\nmicroscopic specimen, one not only facilitates the microscopical\r\nexamination, but is able to place more reliance upon the results\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Results of Microscopical Examination of Blood-Stains in their\r\nMedico-Legal Relations.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the examination of alleged blood-stains from\r\na medico-legal standpoint is pursued essentially for the purpose of\r\ntestifying as to whether they have been produced by blood or not.\r\nWhere the examination yields a negative result, further procedure is\r\nnecessary with a view of identifying the true nature of the stain.\r\nShould, however, the result be positive, the question arises as to\r\nthe possibility of distinguishing between human blood and the blood\r\nof other animals, and determining the exact animal from which the\r\nblood has been derived. Such an examination should be pursued in full\r\nrecognition of its importance as a factor towards the establishment of\r\ntruth essential to the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil this obligation the methods employed should be so selected as\r\nto produce results bearing testimony free from any possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nCertain differences exist, and may be detected by microscopical\r\nexamination, between the red corpuscles of human blood and those of\r\nsome other animals sufficiently well marked to render differentiation\r\npossible. The differences are those of form and structure.\r\n\r\n    (1) In _man_ the red corpuscles appear as _circular_\r\n         biconcave discs, averaging ¹/₃₅₀₀ of an inch in diameter,\r\n         and are non-nucleated.\r\n\r\nThe red corpuscles of mammals present the same features, with the\r\nexception of the\r\n\r\n    (2) _Camel_ tribe, in which the corpuscles are _oval_ in\r\n         form, but non-nucleated.\r\n\r\n    (3) In _birds_, _fishes_, _reptiles_, and _amphibians_ the\r\n         red corpuscles are oval in shape, and possess a nucleus.\r\n\r\nGuided by the above facts, one is able to testify whether or not the\r\ncorpuscles exhibit the characters of mammalian blood.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made with a view to establishing a reliable\r\nmeans of differentiation between the red blood corpuscles of man and\r\nother mammals (the camel excepted), and with a certain degree of\r\nsuccess, such as might be expected, under select conditions favourable\r\nto histological research, but which do not obtain in medico-legal\r\npractice. Differences in size of the red corpuscles, as revealed by\r\nmicrometric measurement, have been suggested as a possible means of\r\ndistinguishing between the blood of different mammals. Of the common\r\nanimals, the red blood corpuscles of the sheep present the most marked\r\ndifference in size compared with those of man. The following table of\r\nthe dimensions of red blood corpuscles is derived from measurements\r\nmade by Treadwell, and quoted by White (_The Medico-Legal Journal_, New\r\nYork, 1895):\r\n\r\n              μ.\r\n    Human   7.940\r\n    Dog     6.918\r\n    Rabbit  6.365\r\n    Ass     6.293\r\n    Pig     6.101\r\n    Horse   5.503\r\n    Cat     5.463\r\n    Ox      5.436\r\n    Sheep   4.745\r\n\r\n_Menstrual blood_ contains no fibrin, has an acid reaction due to the\r\nvaginal mucus which keeps it fluid, and contains squamous epithelial\r\ncells. None of these characters can be differentiated on fabrics,\r\nespecially when contaminated with urinary stains in addition. Hence, in\r\ncases of alleged rape, no distinction can be drawn between blood-stains\r\non the underclothing of the female, which may have arisen from\r\nhæmorrhage the result of violence to the sexual parts, and those which\r\nmight have arisen from the ordinary menstrual flow or metrorrhagia. The\r\ndetection of spermatozoa, however, would add considerable value to the\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Measurement of Blood Corpuscles.\r\n\r\nPhoto-micrograph of human red blood corpuscles, × 800.

The\r\ndiameter of the corpuscle covers one division of the scale. Compare\r\nwith human blood, Fig. 8. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n=Blood Crystals.=--Professor Preyer of Jena pointed out many years ago\r\nthat the hæmoglobin crystals from the blood of some animals differed in\r\nshape from those of man, and this fact has given rise to many attempts\r\nto trace the identity of the blood to the animal from which it has been\r\nderived. The results have not been of sufficient value to establish it\r\nas trustworthy for medico-legal purposes. Dr. Monckton Copeman (_B. M.\r\nJ._, vol. ii. p. 190, 1889) has carefully investigated the subject, and\r\nhis researches, partly confirmed by Professor Glaister of Glasgow, show\r\nthat from the guinea-pig, rat, and squirrel, crystals of hæmoglobin may\r\nbe easily obtained, but the solubility of human hæmoglobin renders it\r\nmuch more difficult to crystallise. Crystals may, however, be obtained\r\nin the following ways:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) By feeding leeches on human blood, crystals may\r\n          be found, after some weeks, in the gastric dilatation of\r\n          the alimentary canal.\r\n    (_b_) By diluting human blood with the fluid from\r\n          hydrocele, ascites, or pleurisy when they have undergone\r\n          decomposition.\r\n    (_c_) By adding crystals of glycocholate or\r\n          taurocholate of soda to human blood.\r\n    (_d_) By adding a drop of cat‘s bile to human blood\r\n          on a microscope slide, but the crystals are those of\r\n          reduced hæmoglobin.\r\n\r\nCrystals of human hæmoglobin appear in the form of rectangular plates,\r\nwith a greenish or pale claret colour. On spectroscopic examination\r\nthey exhibit the characters of reduced hæmoglobin, in contradistinction\r\nto the crystals derived from the lower animals, which produce the\r\nspectrum of oxyhæmoglobin.\r\n\r\nThe blood of the bullock, sheep, and pig is very difficult to\r\ncrystallise. By the method adopted by Gamgee of adding to defibrinated\r\nblood one-sixteenth its volume of ether, shaking until the mixture\r\nbecomes transparent, and allowing to stand in an ordinary temperature\r\nfor 48 hours, crystals may be obtained from the blood of the following\r\nanimals:\r\n\r\n    1. Horse.\r\n    2. Bullock.\r\n    3. Sheep.\r\n    4. Pig.\r\n    5. Dog.\r\n    6. Cat.\r\n    7. Rabbit.\r\n    8. Squirrel.\r\n    9. Guinea-pig.\r\n    10. Rat.\r\n    11. Mouse.\r\n    12. Chicken.\r\n    13. Pigeon.\r\n\r\nCrystals from human blood are not easily obtainable by this process,\r\nbut when they are, they always give the spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin,\r\nwhereas those from the animals mentioned above give the spectrum of\r\noxyhæmoglobin.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical Examination\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a coloured solution from a supposed blood-stain, if\r\nsufficient in quantity, apply the following chemical tests to separate\r\nportions:\r\n\r\n1. Add a few drops of a weak solution of ammonia in distilled\r\nwater. The colour may remain unchanged, or, at the most, a _slight_\r\nheightening may take place, if it be due to blood. If the solution\r\nof ammonia be too strong, a brown colour may be produced if blood be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n2. Heat to boiling, when the following changes take place if blood be\r\npresent:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The colour may disappear.\r\n    (_b_) Coagulation follows.\r\n    (_c_) A precipitate falls, dirty grey or brown in colour,\r\n               depending upon the amount of colouring matter present.\r\n\r\n               On adding caustic potash to the precipitate it\r\n               will dissolve, and the solution formed will\r\n               appear greenish by transmitted and red by\r\n               reflected light. This phenomenon is called the\r\n               _dichroism_ of blood. Authorities differ\r\n               in opinion as to whether the colour is green by\r\n               transmitted and red by reflected light, or _vice\r\n               versa_. “As a matter of fact, the phenomenon\r\n               is chameleon-like as regards colour, so that both\r\n               sets of observers may be considered right or\r\n               wrong” (Glaister).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Photo-micrograph of red blood corpuscles from\r\ndomestic fowl, × 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Photo-micrograph of blood corpuscles of fish,\r\n× 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Photo-micrograph of blood corpuscles from a\r\ndried stain of the blood of a codfish, × 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n3. Add tincture of guaiacum, freshly prepared: an opaque,\r\ncream-coloured precipitate of the guaiac resin will form in the aqueous\r\nsolution. On the addition of ozonic ether, turpentine, or peroxide of\r\nhydrogen, a blue colour will be produced at the junction of the fluids:\r\nproportionate to the amount of blood-colouring matter present, the blue\r\ncolour will vary in intensity.\r\n\r\nThis test, known as Day‘s or Schönbein‘s, is extremely delicate, and\r\n_reacts to no coloured substance except blood_.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the blood-stain is small, the test may be applied as\r\nfollows. Moisten a pure white filter paper with a drop of distilled\r\nwater, or one of the solutions recommended in the section on physical\r\nexamination, and touch the stain with the moistened portion. On adding\r\na drop of tincture of guaiacum followed by a drop of ozonic ether\r\nto the wet filter paper the blue colour will be produced and easily\r\nrecognised on the white surface.\r\n\r\nThe guaiacum test, although extremely delicate, can only be accepted as\r\nproviding negative evidence. The absence of reaction proves the absence\r\nof blood, except in _very old_ blood-stains, which may not respond to\r\nthe test. The blue colour produced indicates that the substance _may_\r\nbe blood, but it cannot be accepted without corroboration. Gluten, raw\r\npotato, milk, bile, sweat (Ogston), and other oxidising substances give\r\na blue colour with guaiacum and ozonic ether; some substances give the\r\nblue colour with guaiacum alone.\r\n\r\nWith blood, however, the test is sufficiently delicate to detect one\r\ndrop in six ounces of water.\r\n\r\n4. _Nitric acid_ added to a portion of the solution of blood in\r\ndistilled water produces a whitish-grey precipitate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Photo-micrograph of frog‘s blood showing oval\r\nnucleated red corpuscles, × 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n5. _Hæmin Crystals._--Concentrate a portion of the solution upon a\r\nmicroscope slide, add to it a minute crystal of chloride of sodium and\r\na few drops of glacial acetic acid. Heat gently to dryness or to a\r\nlesser degree under a coverslip; examine with the microscope; if blood\r\nbe present, crystals of hæmin, or the hydrochloride of hæmatin, will\r\nbe found. They are of a yellowish-red to brownish-black colour with\r\na metallic lustre. They occur in rhomboidal prisms, or six-sided in\r\nshape, or in the form of “whetstones,” often in clusters; many of the\r\ncrystals exhibit a lipped projection on one side. They are known as\r\nTeichmann‘s crystals. It is well to verify their origin from blood by\r\nplacing upon them a drop of hydrogen peroxide, when they will give off\r\nbubbles of oxygen gas.\r\n\r\nThey are insoluble in water, alcohol, and dilute acetic and\r\nhydrochloric acids. They dissolve in boiling acetic or hydrochloric\r\nacids, and the caustic alkalies. They respond to the guaiacum test, and\r\nthe ash produced by incineration shows the presence of iron by the red\r\ncolour produced on the addition of a drop of hydrochloric acid and a\r\nsolution of potassium sulphocyanide.\r\n\r\nThe production, by the methods described, of such crystals affords\r\nconclusive proof of the presence of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic Examination\r\n\r\nTo a portion of the coloured solution, filtered if necessary, the\r\nspectroscopic tests should be applied. The following points must be\r\nremembered in carrying out a spectroscopic examination:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The colouring matter of fresh blood is hæmoglobin, and it may\r\nexist in two states, according to the degree of its combination with\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nIn arterial blood it is present as oxidised hæmoglobin, and the same\r\nobtains in blood which has been exposed to the air under certain\r\nconditions and for a varying period of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of hæmin, × 250.\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nIn venous blood, especially when obtained under conditions preventing\r\noxidation, as from the heart cavity of an animal newly asphyxiated, it\r\nis present as deoxidised hæmoglobin.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In dry stains, especially if they have been subjected to the\r\naction of impure air containing the products of coal-combustion, the\r\ncolouring matter becomes changed into _methæmoglobin_, or hæmoglobin\r\nin which its combination with oxygen has been altered in such a way\r\nthat a current of a neutral gas, such as hydrogen or nitrogen, will\r\nnot dissociate it, as it does with oxyhæmoglobin. Such stains have a\r\nbrownish colour, and may give an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In stains which have retained moisture, from having lain in damp\r\nplaces, the hæmoglobin becomes converted into _hæmatin_. The same\r\nchange takes place in dry stains after a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nOn examining the solution of the colouring matter from a blood-stain\r\nwith the spectroscope, the spectrum will vary according to its\r\ncondition and the nature of the solvent used.\r\n\r\nThe spectra of hæmoglobin and its derivatives are characteristic, and\r\nafford conclusive evidence of the presence of blood. The spectra must\r\nbe recognised, however, in more than one condition. Other substances\r\nmay yield spectra very similar to that of oxyhæmoglobin, but when\r\nsubjected to certain tests they do not alter in the same way. They\r\ncannot be made to give the spectra of reduced hæmoglobin and reduced\r\nhæmatin, and any colouring matter which may be made to yield the\r\nspectra of reduced hæmoglobin and reduced hæmatin is derived from blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood Spectra\r\n\r\n1. _Oxidised hæmoglobin_ (O₂Hb) is characterised by the presence in\r\nits solar spectrum of two absorption bands between the D and E lines.\r\nThe first band commences at the D line and extends a short distance\r\ntowards the E. The second commences at a little distance from it, and\r\nterminates at the E line; it is about twice the breadth of the first.\r\nThe band at D is more defined than the other (Fig. 15, 1).\r\n\r\n2. _Deoxidised_ or _reduced hæmoglobin_ presents one broad band\r\noccupying almost the whole of the space between D and E slightly to the\r\nleft of these lines (Fig. 15, 2).\r\n\r\n3. _Methæmoglobin_ presents two bands between D and E, in the same\r\nposition as those of O₂Hb, but in addition a third band between C and D\r\nand near to the former (Fig. 15, 3).\r\n\r\nA solution of oxyhæmoglobin or methæmoglobin may be reduced by the\r\naddition of a reducing agent, such as Stokes‘ reagent, consisting of\r\nferrous sulphate with a small quantity of tartaric acid dissolved in\r\nwater and rendered alkaline at the time of using with ammonia, or,\r\nbetter still, by the addition of ammonium sulphide. The spectrum will\r\nchange to that of reduced hæmoglobin.\r\n\r\n4. _Acid hæmatin_ presents a spectrum with a band between D and E,\r\ncommencing at a little distance from D and ending at E, also a narrower\r\nband between C and D and commencing at C. It is a difficult spectrum to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\n5. _Alkaline hæmatin_ presents a spectrum with a single band between\r\nC and D near to the D line. It is more difficult to obtain than the\r\nspectrum of acid hæmatin.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, however, to obtain these spectra, viz. 5 and 6,\r\nbut it is necessary to reduce solutions of either acid or alkaline\r\nhæmatin in order to obtain the spectrum of _reduced hæmatin_. To do\r\nso proceed as follows. To some of the solution of colouring matter\r\nobtained from the stain add a small quantity of a 20 per cent. solution\r\nof sodium hydrate; the solution will alter in colour, and the spectrum\r\nof O₂Hb or MetHb will disappear. On adding to this solution of alkaline\r\nhæmatin a few drops of ammonium sulphide, or Stokes‘ fluid, it becomes\r\nclaret-coloured, and on examination with the spectroscope the spectrum\r\nof _reduced hæmatin_ will be seen. This is the most pronounced of all\r\nblood spectra. Its production can be hastened by gently warming the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIf the stain be old and already changed into hæmatin, its solution\r\nwill yield the spectrum of acid hæmatin, and will give the spectrum of\r\n_reduced hæmatin_ on the addition of ammonium sulphide or Stokes‘ fluid\r\nwithout previous alkalisation.\r\n\r\n6. _Reduced hæmatin_ presents a spectrum with a dark band about midway\r\nbetween D and E, and a broad but paler band commences near the E line\r\nand extends to the _b_ line (Fig. 15, 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Blood Spectra.\r\n\r\n    1. Oxyhæmoglobin.      3. Methæmoglobin.   5. CO hæmoglobin.\r\n    2. Reduced hæmoglobin. 4. Reduced hæmatin. 6. CO hæmoglobin and\r\n                                                  reduced hæmoglobin.]\r\n\r\nIn cases of death by asphyxia, in which the hæmoglobin is in\r\ncombination with CO₂, the blood, if removed and examined immediately\r\nafter death, gives a spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin, but on exposure\r\nto the air it rapidly changes to oxyhæmoglobin. The period after death\r\nat which blood is usually submitted for medico-legal examination\r\nis sufficiently late to allow of this change, and so prevents the\r\npossibility of determining death by asphyxia by spectroscopic\r\nexamination of the blood. Where death has been caused by the action\r\nof _carbon monoxide_, the blood is of a _cherry-red colour_, and\r\nit will retain this colour unchanged for a long time, in fact for\r\nyears, due to a stable combination of the CO and hæmoglobin, called\r\ncarboxyhæmoglobin. Such blood yields a very characteristic spectrum,\r\nwith two bands similar to those of O₂Hb, but nearer to the violet end\r\n(Fig. 15, 6). Their position should be assured by accurate measurement\r\nand comparison with a spectrum of O₂Hb. The CO hæmoglobin, however,\r\ncannot be reduced; on the addition of ammonium sulphide or Stokes‘\r\nfluid the bands remain unaltered.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the amount of fluid obtainable for examination is very\r\nsmall, recourse must be had to the micro-spectroscope, using a Sorby‘s\r\ncell to hold the fluid, and substituting for the eye-piece of the\r\nmicroscope a specially constructed spectroscope arranged so as to throw\r\nthe spectrum of a known solution of blood-colouring matter alongside of\r\nthat yielded by the solution under examination. Artificial light should\r\nbe used, and the D line located by placing in the flame a platinum wire\r\ncarrying a salt of sodium.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiological Tests for Blood\r\n\r\nThe results of the experimental investigations of Friedenthal,[3]\r\nDeutsch,[4] Uhlenhuth,[5] Wasserman and Schutze,[6] Nuttall,[7]\r\nTarchetti,[8] Grünbaum,[9] Metchnikoff,[10] and M‘Weeney[11] into\r\n“blood relationships” have led to the suggestion of a new method--the\r\n“biological test,” by which different kinds of mammalian blood may\r\nbe distinguished one from the other. Their experiments show in a\r\ngeneral way that the “serum from an animal which has been injected\r\nintraperitoneally with any given organic fluid will, if mixed in small\r\nquantity with a dilute solution of the fluid used for the injection,\r\nproduce a more or less definite precipitate.” If human defibrinated\r\nblood be injected into the peritoneal cavity of a rabbit, the serum\r\nobtained from the rabbit‘s blood, when mixed with a clear solution of\r\nthe blood of man or ape, will produce a precipitate, and agglutinate\r\nthe red blood corpuscles if present: the same reaction will not follow\r\nif such serum be added to a solution of the blood of any other animal.\r\n\r\n[3] Friedenthal, _Archiv für Anatomie und Physiologie_, 1900, p. 494.\r\n\r\n[4] Deutsch, _Bulletin Medical_, Sept. 8, 1900; and _Centralblatt für\r\nBakteriologie_, Band xxix. p. 661.\r\n\r\n[5] Uhlenhuth, _Deutsch Medicinische Wochenschrift_, 1901, Nos. 6, 17,\r\n45.\r\n\r\n[6] Wasserman and Schutze, _Berlin Klin.

No. 7, p. 378. _Lancet_,\r\nJune 18, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of substances of albuminous or proteid nature into\r\nthe body of an animal, and which can be taken up by its cells as a\r\nfood, produces in the body of the animal a series of substances called\r\nantibodies, of which one is designated _precipitin_ from its power of\r\nproducing a precipitate with the substance introduced. The organic\r\nsubstance introduced capable of producing antibodies is called the\r\n_antigen_. The precipitin is formed and present in the blood serum of\r\nthe inoculated animal.\r\n\r\nMetallic poisons, alkaloids and carbohydrates, do not produce\r\nantibodies; some vegetable proteids do.\r\n\r\nThe serum containing the precipitin is called the _antiserum_.\r\n\r\nThe precipitin in the antiserum is specific, and produces the effect\r\nonly with its own antigen, not with that derived from another species\r\nof animal, but will act with one derived from a closely allied species,\r\n_e.g._ man and the higher apes, sheep, and goat.\r\n\r\nIn order to eliminate this the antigen should be diluted to 1:1000.\r\n\r\nThe blood used as antigen may be dried and sterilised, thus it may be\r\nkept for a long time, and when required for use dissolved in normal\r\nsaline.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient human antigen for general use is ascitic or\r\npleuritic fluid, and may be kept in good condition when mixed with a\r\nsmall quantity of chloroform.\r\n\r\nTo produce the antiserum 3 to 10 c.c. of the antigen serum is injected\r\ninto a vein or the peritoneal cavity of a rabbit, and repeated at an\r\ninterval of four or five days until 25 c.c. have been injected. The\r\nserum of the rabbit is then tested with the antigen diluted 1:100.\r\nThe injections are then continued until 70 to 80 c.c. have been\r\nadministered. The animal is then killed, the blood collected, and\r\nstood in a refrigerator for the serum to separate. This is then drawn\r\ninto sterile pipettes, sealed, and kept in the cold. For purposes of\r\npreservation one-tenth its volume of 5 per cent. phenol may be added\r\nbefore pipetting. The antiserum may be dried on slips of black paper\r\nfor future use.\r\n\r\nFor medico-legal purposes, the antiserum should always be tested with\r\nits antigen to be sure of its efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe antigen to be tested should be diluted 1:1000 at least, as potent\r\nantisera may give reactions with strong solutions of antigens derived\r\nfrom other species of animals. Various antisera may be made by\r\ninoculating rabbits with the serum of different animals.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff has shown that intraperitoneal injection is not absolutely\r\nnecessary in order to produce an antiserum, feeding a rabbit on the\r\nblood will act in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for testing a stain is as follows. First of all the stain\r\nmust be proved to be blood by the usual methods; this because the\r\nantiserum will give reactions with other albuminous substances, _e.g._\r\nmucus, pus, semen, milk, or albuminous urine derived from the animal\r\nproviding the antigen.\r\n\r\nHaving proved the stain to be blood, a solution of it should be made\r\nin normal saline, sufficiently strong to give the HNO₃ reaction for\r\nalbumin, or to foam when shaken up. If the amount of solution be small,\r\nthe tests can be carried out in capillary tubes or pipettes. The\r\nsolution of the stain must be cleared by filtration or the centrifuge.\r\n\r\nThe tests must be controlled by comparison with known human blood,\r\nand blood from several domestic animals. For this purpose the various\r\nantisera should be kept in stock.\r\n\r\nTwo sets, A and B, of six small tubes are used, into each of A is\r\nplaced 0.05 c.c. of human antiserum from a sensitised rabbit. Into each\r\ntube of Set A is then added double the amount of diluted antigen, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          { 1. Receives extract of known human blood-stain.\r\n          { 2.    “        “         “   ox      “     “\r\n          { 3.    “        “         “   horse   “     “\r\n    Set A { 4.    “        “         “   sheep   “     “\r\n          { 5.    “        “         “   pig     “     “\r\n          { 6.    “        “         “   stain under observation.\r\n\r\nSet B is now charged as follows:\r\n\r\n          { 1. Receives normal rabbit serum 0.05 c.c.\r\n          { 2.    “     human antiserum     0.05  “\r\n          { 3.    “     ox       “          0.05  “\r\n    Set B { 4.    “     horse    “          0.05  “\r\n          { 5.    “     sheep    “          0.05  “\r\n          { 6.    “     pig      “          0.05  “\r\n\r\nTo each tube in Set B is now added about 0.1 c.c. of the extract of the\r\nsuspected stain.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that in Set A known antigen is added to known\r\nprecipitin, with the exception of tube 6, which receives suspected\r\nantigen, while in Set B the suspected antigen is added to known\r\nantisera, with the exception of No. 1, which contains normal rabbit\r\nserum.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are observed in an hour and the results noted. Should the\r\nstain be human blood, positive reactions will be present in tubes 1 and\r\n6 of stand A, and tube 2 of B.\r\n\r\nThe negative reactions in the other tubes in stand A prove that the\r\nantiserum used is specific, and will only react with its own antigen;\r\nin stand B that the stain is composed of specific human antigen,\r\nreacting only with its own antiserum.\r\n\r\nShould the stain suspected be other than human, and derived from one\r\nof the other animals used for antiserum in stand B, then the positive\r\nreaction will occur in the particular tube.[12] The test is now\r\nrecognised as very sensitive and reliable, and is also applicable to\r\nthe detection of the flesh or fluids of animals, and has thus been used\r\nfor the detection of meat stuffs.\r\n\r\n[12] M‘Weeney, _Lancet_, June 18, 1910.\r\n\r\nTarchetti advises the following procedure in the examination of\r\nblood-stains: Dissolve the stain in a few drops of a 0.9 per cent.\r\naqueous solution of sodium chloride, filter, and divide the filtrate\r\ninto two portions; to one (_a_) add 0.5 c.c. of the prepared rabbit\r\nserum (the so-called antiserum); to the other (_b_) serum from a rabbit\r\nwhich has not been injected with human blood. Both are to be placed in\r\nan incubator at 37° C. for an hour. By this time, if the solution of\r\nthe stain be of human or anthropoid origin, the contents of the tube\r\n(_a_) will have become turbid, the contents of tube (_b_) will remain\r\nclear. From a series of experiments with blood-stains of man and other\r\nanimals on a variety of materials, Tarchetti states that this method is\r\nreliable. Prepared rabbit “human antiserum” has been shown to have no\r\nsuch reaction with the blood of the pig, ox, calf, mouse, or rat.\r\n\r\nFrom the result of his investigations Grünbaum points out that these\r\nreactions must be looked upon rather as “special” than “specific,” in\r\nview of the fact that his “chimpanzee antiserum” gave a _slight_ but\r\ndistinct turbidity after a few hours with horse blood. He also suggests\r\na method for the microscopical application of the “biological test,” by\r\nusing a 1 per cent. blood solution with a drop of “antiserum.” This\r\nmethod has enabled him to distinguish between human and anthropoid\r\nblood, the reaction occurring earlier and being more complete when the\r\n“antiserum” is used on its own blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetable and other Stains which resemble Blood\r\n\r\nCertain vegetable colouring matters give spectra which may be mistaken\r\nfor blood, from their close similarity. Of these cochineal dissolved in\r\na solution of alum gives two bands similar to O₂Hb. On the addition of\r\nboric acid the bands move to the violet end of the spectrum, but they\r\nare unaffected if the colouring matter be blood. Lac-dye, alkanet root,\r\nmadder, and others also give spectra resembling O₂Hb, but they are\r\nchanged or disappear on adding ammonia or sulphite of potassium, while\r\nthe spectrum of blood remains unaltered.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, spectra of colouring matters other than blood\r\nare not capable of being altered by reducing agents, so that, however\r\nsimilar they may be to O₂Hb, they cannot be accepted as derived from\r\nblood unless the spectra of reduced Hb and reduced hæmatin can be\r\nobtained in the way described.\r\n\r\nCochineal, colours of certain roots and wood, turn crimson on the\r\naddition of ammonia, logwood bluish-black.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the rose and certain flowers turn green on adding ammonia.\r\n\r\nFruit-stains from mulberry, currants, gooseberries, &c., turn\r\nbluish-green with ammonia.\r\n\r\nVegetable stains have their colour heightened by the action of dilute\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nChlorine bleaches fruit-stains, but turns the colour of blood-stains to\r\nan olive-green.\r\n\r\nRed dyes fixed by a mordant are not influenced by ammonia.\r\n\r\nIron stains are usually blackened by ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\nRed paint may contain red oxide of iron; digest with hydrochloric acid\r\nand test for iron, by adding ferrocyanide of potassium to obtain the\r\nPrussian blue. Iron stains may be of a reddish-brown or orange colour,\r\nand insoluble in water, so that HCl is used to dissolve them.\r\n\r\n_Citrate and malate of iron_ stains are soluble in water; the addition\r\nof ammonia to an aqueous solution produces no change; guaiacum will\r\ngive a blue reaction if a persalt of iron be present. The addition of\r\nhydrochloric acid and ferrocyanide of potassium will give the Prussian\r\nblue reaction. A drop of nitric acid added to the solution will oxidise\r\nthe iron to the ferric state, and on the addition of a few drops of\r\nfresh-made aqueous solution of sulphocyanide of potassium the port-wine\r\ncolour of sulphocyanide of iron will be produced.\r\n\r\nA control test must be made with distilled water to prove the purity of\r\nthe reagents, and the two results compared with each other.\r\n\r\nAniline stains resembling blood are changed to greenish-yellow or\r\nyellow on the addition of dilute nitric acid. Eosin stains produce\r\na fluorescent solution when dissolved in water. Grease, tar, pitch,\r\nsnuff, and paint may be mistaken for blood, especially on dark fabrics.\r\nThey may be detected by two methods:\r\n\r\n(_a_) =The Wet Method.=--Having failed to obtain a solution by the aid\r\nof the ordinary solvents for blood, other solvents must be used; ether\r\nor benzene for grease, paint, or tar. The solution obtained must be\r\nexamined with the spectroscope.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =The Dry Method.=--Place the cloth or other fabric stain down\r\nupon a clean white filter paper; then on pressing the cloth with a hot\r\nlaundry iron, grease, tar, or pitch will stain the paper, paint or\r\nsnuff will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS, CONTUSIONS AND BRUISES\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS\r\n\r\nBurns and Scalds are lesions characterised by a more or less marked\r\ndestruction of the tissues of the body, caused by the action upon its\r\ninternal or external surfaces of a temperature higher than that of the\r\nbody itself, or by the action of corrosive chemical substances.\r\n\r\n=Burns= are produced in the following ways:\r\n\r\n    By exposure to radiant heat.\r\n    By the direct application of flame.\r\n    By contact with heated solids.\r\n    By contact with solid bodies which have become liquefied\r\n       by heat, such as metals in a state of fusion.\r\n    By friction.\r\n    By lightning, electricity, and X-rays.\r\n    By contact with corrosive chemical substances,\r\n       solid or liquid.\r\n\r\n=Scalds= are produced by the application of heated liquids, at or near\r\ntheir boiling-points, or in a gaseous form--as _steam_.\r\n\r\nThe injuries produced will depend upon the degree of temperature, the\r\nperiod of exposure to its action, and the extent of surface involved.\r\n\r\nThe danger to life depends more on the extent of surface injured\r\nthan the intensity of the burn or scald upon a limited area, unless\r\nthe position of the burn render it peculiarly dangerous. Even though\r\nthe injuries be comparatively superficial, if they involve one-third\r\nor one half of the surface of the body they must be regarded as\r\nfatal. They may prove fatal by shock, by asphyxia, by constant and\r\nprofuse discharge from the injured surface, from absorption of septic\r\nmatter, from secondary inflammations of internal organs and serous\r\nmembranes--pleurisy, peritonitis, meningitis, perforating ulcer of\r\nthe duodenum. Children succumb more quickly than adults to burns and\r\nscalds--the simplest, in their case, often proving fatal.\r\n\r\nThe cause of early death from burns and scalds is looked upon as a\r\ndisorder of the blood following injury to the red corpuscles by the\r\nheat, and that this is more easily brought about in children, because\r\nof the thinness of the skin, and the red corpuscles being less capable\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the different degrees of burns:\r\n\r\n    1. Superficial inflammation, characterised by redness without\r\n       blistering.\r\n    2. Acute inflammation, the epidermis raised, forming vesicles\r\n       containing serum.\r\n    3. Destruction of the superficial layers of the true skin.\r\n    4. Destruction of the true skin and subcutaneous cellular\r\n       tissues.\r\n    5. The superficial and deep parts converted into a charred mass.\r\n    6. Entire carbonisation of the parts.\r\n                                                    (Dupuytren.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-mortem Appearances\r\n\r\nThese will vary according to the extent of the injuries, the length of\r\ntime the individual lived after receiving them, and the causative agent.\r\n\r\n=External Appearances.=--1. _Burns._--Radiant heat whitens the skin,\r\nflames blacken it, from deposit of carbonaceous material. The hair\r\nand clothing of the body are singed. Blisters may be present on\r\nvarious parts, and roasted patches of the skin or deeper parts may\r\nbe present. The flame of an explosive, such as a mixture of coal gas\r\nand air, scorches and mummifies the skin. The skin is blackened by\r\nthe explosion of gunpowder, and particles of the powder may be driven\r\ninto it; similar results follow explosions in coal mines, but to a\r\ngreater degree. Burns caused by red-hot solids or molten metals vary\r\nin appearance according to the length of time they have remained in\r\ncontact with the surface: if short, there may be injury to the skin\r\nonly, with blistering; if for a longer period, there will be roasting\r\nor charring of the part, and blisters may not be present.\r\n\r\nAll stages of burns may be present.\r\n\r\nThe uncovered parts of the body, as a rule, are more affected than the\r\nclothed, unless the clothes become ignited, when the converse would\r\nhold good. In cases where the clothes have been saturated with an\r\ninflammable oil like petroleum the burns are much more severe.\r\n\r\n2. _Scalds._--The appearances produced and the severity of the result\r\nwill vary directly with the boiling-point of the liquid. Boiling water\r\nand steam produce vesication; the hairs are not affected. If the steam\r\nbe superheated, blistering may be absent, and the skin appear sodden\r\nand devoid of elasticity. If the person survive the injuries for some\r\ndays, the skin will present appearances of reaction. After exposure\r\nto great heat the bodies of the victims are usually contorted, with\r\nthe limbs flexed and the arms fixed in a defensive attitude--the\r\n“pugilistic attitude.” This condition is due to _heat rigidity_.\r\n\r\n=Internal Appearances.=--The brain is shrunk, usually without any\r\nalteration in form, the lungs also shrunk, and the larynx, trachea,\r\nand bronchi may contain carbonaceous material; their membranes may\r\nbe injected and covered with frothy mucus. The kidneys may present\r\nreddish-brown markings from altered blood, and degeneration of the\r\nepithelium of the tubules and Malpighian bodies.\r\n\r\nThere may be a reddened appearance of the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach and intestines, and in a certain number of cases, where death\r\nhas occurred some time after the injuries, ulcers may be present in the\r\nduodenum.\r\n\r\nThe uterus and testicles resist the action of fire in a marked degree,\r\nand may be changed but slightly, although the rest of the body has been\r\nalmost consumed.\r\n\r\nThe blood of persons who have been exposed to the action of CO during a\r\nfire will present the usual cherry-red colour and the spectrum of COHb.\r\nA similar cherry-red colour of the blood is found in bodies of persons\r\nburnt to death which is not due to the action of CO. The cause is a\r\nphysical one, the alteration in colour being due to the coagulation of\r\nthe albumin in microscopical particles by the heat. In this condition\r\nthe spectrum is that of O₂Hb, and can be reduced in the usual way. The\r\nsame peculiar condition of the blood may be produced in corpses by\r\nexposure to a sufficiently high temperature.\r\n\r\nIf on the examination of the blood COHb is detected, it indicates that\r\nthe person in whose body it is found was alive during the progress of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n_Corrosives._--The appearances produced by the application of corrosive\r\nchemical substances are peculiar to them, and depend upon their special\r\nactions upon the tissues. Sulphuric acid acts by rapidly extracting\r\nwater from the tissues and producing local rise of temperature; nitric\r\nacid combines with the tissues to form picric acid; nitrate of silver\r\nacts upon the tissue by hyperoxidation, and combines to form albuminate\r\nof silver, nitric acid being liberated. A solution of phosphorus in\r\ncarbon disulphide, known as Greek fire, by the rapid oxidation and\r\nburning of the phosphorus produces combustion of the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of lesions produced by corrosives from those by fire\r\nor heated fluid or steam rests upon the absence of vesication, the\r\npresence of the stains on the skin or clothing which they produce, and\r\nthe chemical analysis of the stains. Sulphuric acid produces a grey\r\nor brownish-black eschar on the body; hydrochloric acid may leave a\r\nwhitish-grey stain; nitric acid produces a yellow stain on the skin,\r\nand may produce sloughing.\r\n\r\n=Was the burn inflicted before or after death?=--The answer to this\r\nquestion depends upon careful consideration of all the evidences\r\nafforded by the external and internal appearances, and upon the\r\npresence or absence of _vital reaction_ in the lesions found.\r\n\r\nTwo characteristic appearances--redness and vesication--are present in\r\nburns inflicted during life when the surface of the body is not charred\r\nand the tissues destroyed. The redness affects the surface and entire\r\nsubstance of the true skin, which is dotted by the deep red openings\r\nof the sudoriferous and sebaceous ducts. This appearance cannot be\r\nproduced after death. Blisters are formed by a temperature somewhat\r\nless than that of boiling water. Vesication, according to Orfila,\r\nis characteristic of a burn inflicted during life, and the late Sir\r\nRobert Christison found that in burns caused before and after death the\r\nvesicles in the former contained serum, the latter air. In anasarcous\r\nsubjects, however, serous blisters may be formed, especially if the\r\nheat employed be not too severe. A case is recorded by Taylor in which\r\nvesicles containing bloody serum were formed on the body of a man who\r\nhad just been drowned and who had been put into a hot bath.\r\n\r\nAnte-mortem vesicles in which vital reaction has taken place present\r\nthe following characteristics:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) They contain serous fluid in which albumin and\r\n          chlorides can be detected.\r\n    (_b_) An inflammatory red bounding line round the\r\n          circumference.\r\n    (_c_) Inflammatory redness of the base, and the papillæ\r\n          of the skin.\r\n    (_d_) The presence of pus, which would indicate that\r\n          the person had lived at least thirty-six hours after\r\n          the burn had taken place.\r\n\r\nIn burns produced after death, the surface and substance of the skin is\r\nof a dull white colour, dotted with grey openings of the sudoriferous\r\nand sebaceous ducts, and the subcutaneous tissues are uninjected.\r\nVesicles produced by burns may have to be distinguished from the\r\nphlyctænæ, the result of advanced putrefaction. The latter possesses\r\nnone of the characteristics of the former.\r\n\r\nIf a vesicle present the following characteristics it may be accepted\r\nas a post-mortem origin without doubt: if it be small and its contents\r\nscanty, if the fluid it contain be free from albumin and chlorides, if\r\nit contain air, and if there be no signs of inflammatory reaction.\r\n\r\n=Was the burning homicidal, suicidal, or accidental?=--No general rules\r\nfor guidance can be here laid down. In most cases the conditions under\r\nwhich the body is found will point less to suicide than to homicide or\r\naccident. In cases of murder, the body is often burnt in the attempt\r\nto destroy all traces of the crime. It must, however, be borne in mind\r\nthat intense heat applied to the body may give rise to a wound on the\r\nsurface like that caused by a cutting instrument. Casper mentions\r\nsuch a case, in which a wound was found over the liver, due to the\r\napplication of intense heat to the body. The conjunction of robbery\r\nwill greatly assist in helping to solve the difficulty. It may be very\r\nconfidently stated that to dispose of a body by burning is no easy\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreternatural Combustibility\r\n\r\nThe possibility of “spontaneous combustion” occurring in bodies\r\nduring life has been mentioned in the earlier writings on medical\r\njurisprudence, and cases have been recorded in which it has been\r\nalleged to have taken place. Up to the present time no undoubted case\r\nof “spontaneous combustion” during life has been seen. On the other\r\nhand, the possibility of its occurrence is contra-indicated by the\r\nfollowing facts: that the human body must consist of 75 per cent. of\r\nits weight of water, to be compatible with life, and that a dead body\r\nsteeped in methylated spirit for many months or even years will never\r\nbe consumed, if set on fire, in the rapid and complete manner alleged\r\nas occurring in cases of so-called “spontaneous combustion.”\r\n\r\nA case is recorded by Beatson (_B. M. J._, vol. i., 1886, p. 295) of\r\na man, subject to foul eructations from the stomach, who got out of\r\nbed during the night and struck a match to see the time; while blowing\r\nout the light his breath took fire, producing an explosive noise\r\nsufficiently loud to awaken his wife. Such cases are very rare.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that by the action of certain micro-organisms upon organic\r\nmatter inflammable gases are produced. That such an occurrence is\r\npossible, in the dead human body, is supported by cases recorded by\r\nGull (_Med. Times and Gazette_, 1885) and Reynolds (_Med. Chron._,\r\n1891). In Gull‘s case inflammable gases escaped through punctures made\r\ninto the abdomen, and they burned spontaneously on contact with the\r\nair. In Reynold‘s case no flames were seen, but extensive and deep\r\nmarks of burning were present, especially on the trunk and thighs. It\r\nhas been suggested that the habitual use of alcohol in excess during\r\nlife renders the tissues of the body more inflammable, but the matter\r\nis not yet decided. Tissues steeped in alcohol are not rendered more\r\ninflammable.\r\n\r\nDr. Ogston, who cautiously avoids committing himself to the belief in\r\n“spontaneous combustion,” yet thinks that the subject of _preternatural\r\ncombustibility_ in certain conditions of the body may perhaps, to say\r\nthe least of it, be set down as one still _sub judice_. “There is no\r\nevidence to justify the use of the word ‘spontaneous,’ but there can be\r\nno doubt that an extraordinarily high degree of combustibility occurs\r\nin rare instances, to which the term _preternatural_ combustibility\r\nwould more correctly apply” (J. Dixon Mann).\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns due to X-Rays\r\n\r\nOver-exposure to the action of X-rays produces burns of a peculiar\r\ncharacter, and in cases of unprotected skin exposed to the action\r\nof the rays in those who are constantly working with them, forms\r\nof dermatitis have arisen which are intractable and tend to become\r\nepitheliomatous in character.\r\n\r\nThe results of slight over-exposure, or repeated short exposures vary\r\nfrom a simple redness of the skin to severe dermatitis, the hair of the\r\npart being shed. When the over-exposure or dosage has been severe, the\r\nskin may vesicate and ulcerate. I have seen this in cases where the\r\nrays have been used for reduction of the spleen in leukæmia and Banti‘s\r\ndisease. The burns heal with cicatrisation of radiate shape, the skin\r\naround the scar being permeated with numerous capillary vessels which\r\nproduce the appearance of capillary nævi, and in other instances\r\nlarge stellate superficial vessels are formed. In addition, marked\r\npigmentation of the skin may follow the burn. X-ray burns which have\r\nproduced vesication and ulceration or sloughing take a long time to\r\nheal in comparison with ordinary burns.\r\n\r\nIn repeated exposure to the rays, even when little redness has been\r\nnoticed at the time, the formation of capillary vessels may become\r\nevident some time after the exposures have been stopped. This may\r\ncause disfigurement, by the formation of telangiectasis, especially\r\nif they appear on the face or neck. The falling out of the hair is\r\nproduced by X-rays as a therapeutic measure in cases of ringworm, and\r\ndue precaution must be taken to limit the effect and area of exposure\r\nby proper screening. The same precaution should be used to protect\r\nparts of the body other than the part which requires treatment or\r\nexamination in other conditions.\r\n\r\nWith increasing knowledge of the effects of X-ray exposures, special\r\nprecautions have been devised to prevent untoward effects, so that\r\nburns from over-exposure, and dermatitis amongst X-ray workers are\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTUSIONS AND BRUISES\r\n\r\nIn the living these injuries are accompanied with swelling, pain, and\r\nmore or less discoloration of the part affected. Among malingerers it\r\nis not an uncommon practice to bruise the body to imitate the spots\r\nof purpura and scurvy. In scurvy, the condition of the gums common to\r\nthat disease, and the state of the general health, will point to the\r\ntrue nature of the spots. The diagnosis of purpura will be assisted\r\nby noting the diffusion of the spots over the body. In old people\r\npurpuric spots frequently extend round the limbs, chiefly on one of the\r\nlower extremities. Many blood diseases are associated with ecchymoses\r\nand purpuric eruptions. Some persons are very easily bruised, and a\r\npinch, by no means severe, will cause on their arms a severe bruise.\r\nDiscoloration--ecchymosis--may take place in the skin, cellular tissue,\r\nmuscles, or internal organs as a result of external injury, or it may\r\nbe due to sudden and powerful contraction of a muscle or group of\r\nmuscles. Not infrequently the discoloration does not appear over the\r\nseat of injury, but at some distance from it; and when the effusion\r\nis deep-seated, days may elapse before any discoloration of the skin\r\ntakes place, and then it is not blue, as in superficial parts, but\r\nof a violet, greenish, or yellowish hue. A deep-seated ecchymosis\r\nmay give no external sign of its presence; hence in all cases deep\r\nincisions should be made before an opinion is ventured as to the\r\nentire absence of this occurrence. This is very noticeable among the\r\ndeep-seated muscles of a limb. In these cases, forty or fifty days\r\nmay elapse before the deep-seated bruise shows its existence on the\r\nsurface, and then only as irregular, yellowish, green, or bluish spots\r\nover the part. A very slight contusion, as a sprain of the ankle, may\r\ngive rise to extended discoloration of the leg. An ecchymosis is not\r\nnecessarily situated directly under the seat of injury. A blow given\r\nduring life may not appear as an ecchymosis till _after death_. The\r\nchange of colour in bruises begins at the circumference, and travels\r\ninwards. During the first three days the colour of the bruise is blue,\r\nbluish-black, or black; greenish on the fifth or sixth day; and yellow\r\nfrom the seventh to the twelfth. The extent of an ecchymosis depends\r\ngreatly on the looseness of the cellular tissue. A slight contusion\r\ncauses a slight redness and swelling, and may leave no mark on the dead\r\nbody, unless death has taken place within thirty-six hours. Injuries of\r\nthis kind sometimes leave a parchment-like hardness and discoloration\r\nof the skin. The part looks slightly depressed, due probably to the\r\nepidermis having been partly rubbed off, and the skin then drying.\r\nSimilar marks are sometimes made by blisters. These marks may be\r\nproduced on the dead body by friction and exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of ecchymosis from hypostasis has been given (see p.\r\n46). A tolerably severe blow after death would be necessary to produce\r\nappearances similar to those produced by a slight one during life.\r\nIn scourging, there are parallel ecchymosed lines, of small spots\r\nresembling petechiæ. An internal organ may be ruptured, and yet there\r\nmay be no appearance of injury externally. The liver is the organ most\r\ncommonly ruptured. The rupture is almost always longitudinal, and in\r\nsome cases a portion of the gland is more or less detached. The spleen\r\nis also not infrequently ruptured; and this occurs most frequently in\r\ncountries where ague prevails. Rupture of the lungs and brain is rare.\r\nWhen the pelvis is fractured, the bladder is frequently found ruptured.\r\n\r\nDeath in most cases is due to internal hæmorrhage or shock, when any of\r\nthe internal organs are ruptured.\r\n\r\n=Can the appearance of a bruise be produced after death?=--It is\r\npossible that the appearance of a bruise inflicted during life may be\r\nproduced within two hours after death, and in some rare cases even\r\nafter the lapse of three hours and a quarter (Christison); but these\r\necchymoses are limited in extent, and when large are due to a rupture\r\nin a vein which can be readily ascertained. The experiments of the\r\nlate Sir Robert Christison, relating to this question, are detailed in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_, vol. xxxi. The amount\r\nof violence required after death to produce appearances like those\r\nmade before death is such as would seldom, if ever, be inflicted on a\r\ncorpse, and, therefore, where we find a well-marked bruise we ought to\r\ninfer that it was made before death.\r\n\r\nThe following table, compiled from the experiments of Christison, may\r\nassist the diagnosis:\r\n\r\n    --------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n                During Life.        |            After Death.\r\n    --------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n     1. Swelling of the part.       | 1. No swelling.\r\n                                    |\r\n     2. Coagulation of the blood    | 2. No such appearance, unless\r\n        effused into the adjacent   |    there is a rupture of a large\r\n        cellular tissue, with or    |    vessel in the neighbourhood\r\n        without tumefaction.        |    of loose cellular tissue.\r\n                                    |\r\n     3. Incorporation of blood      | 3. No such appearance produced\r\n        with the whole thickness    |    by a blow after death.\r\n        of the true skin, rendering |\r\n        it black instead of white.  |\r\n    --------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n\r\n_N.B._--Extensive effusion may occur without affecting the skin,\r\nbut when the skin is so affected Christison thought it decisive of\r\n_ante-mortem_ injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Size and Form of a Bruise should be noted.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n1. _In Hanging and Strangulation._--The mark due to pressure of\r\nthe cord on the neck in hanging runs obliquely round the neck; in\r\nstrangulation, the mark encircles the neck. The mark is frequently\r\ninterrupted, and may present very varied appearances in different parts\r\nof the neck. The mark of the knot may be found under the chin.\r\n\r\n2. _In Throttling._--The pressure exerted on the throat of the deceased\r\nby the fingers of his assailant may leave marks which may point to the\r\nmeans used to cause death.\r\n\r\n3. _In other Cases of Death by Violence._--The impression made by the\r\nweapon used may lead to the identification of the murderer. The marks\r\nleft by the wards of a large door-key once led to the identification of\r\nthe assailant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSUFFOCATION, HANGING, STRANGLING, AND THROTTLING\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFOCATION\r\n\r\nDeath from suffocation is said to result from any impediment to the\r\nrespiration which does not act by compressing the larynx or trachea.\r\n\r\nSuffocation may therefore be caused by pressure on the chest, as in\r\npersons crushed in a crowd. It may also be due to the respiration of\r\ncertain gases, or to the presence of pulverulent substances in the air,\r\nwhich act by choking up the air-passages. Imprisonment in any confined\r\nspace may cause death from suffocation, and abscesses bursting into\r\nthe trachea, or vomiting matters in drunken persons lodging in the\r\nwindpipe, may be attended with a like result. Pressure on the umbilical\r\ncord whilst the child is in the maternal passages causes death from\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\n=Signs of Death by Suffocation.=--The first effect of arrest to the\r\npassage of air into the lungs is the stagnation of blood in the\r\ncapillaries of the lungs. Non-arterial blood then goes to the brain and\r\nconsciousness is soon lost. The respiratory sensation is then arrested\r\nby the circulation of venous blood. The left side of the heart becomes\r\nemptied, and then weak; the right side full and engorged. The great\r\nvenous trunks are also more or less full, and the abdominal viscera,\r\nliver, spleen, and kidneys congested. The arrest of the heart‘s action\r\nis a secondary effect; the right side is paralysed by being too full,\r\nthe left by being empty. These signs may be said to be typical, or,\r\nrather, are to be expected in death due to suffocation, but it must\r\nbe distinctly stated that they are not always present. The right side\r\nof the heart is not in all cases engorged with blood; and Christison\r\nwarns medical men against expecting “strongly marked appearances in\r\nevery case of death from suffocation.” The heart, moreover, continues\r\nto contract after the lungs have ceased to perform their duty. Death\r\nis thus due to apnœa--that is, death beginning at the lungs--and not\r\nto syncope. Death in some cases is from neuro-paralysis or nervous\r\napoplexy. In death by shock, which in most cases is instantaneous, both\r\nsides of the heart are equally filled. Death, the result of disease,\r\nmay present all the signs of death from suffocation, and no suspicion\r\nmay be aroused as to the cause of death from the _post-mortem_\r\nappearances, especially if putrefaction have set in.\r\n\r\nThe following table is given as an aid to diagnosis in this form of\r\ndeath:\r\n\r\n\r\nPoints to be noticed in forming a Diagnosis of Death by Suffocation\r\n\r\n1. _The Blood._--There is _unusual fluidity_ of the blood found in\r\ndeath by suffocation, however produced. This condition is sometimes\r\npresent in deaths due to certain diseases, fevers, &c., and in cases of\r\nnarcotic poisoning. Even with the blood in this condition, the presence\r\nof coagula in the cavities of the heart is not infrequent. The colour\r\nof the blood is changed to a dark purple, but in suffocation by carbon\r\nmonoxide it is red.\r\n\r\n2. _Animal Heat._--In persons who have died from suffocation the animal\r\nheat is long retained.\r\n\r\n3. _Cadaveric Rigidity._--Other things being equal, the _rigor mortis_\r\nis as well marked in this kind as in other forms of death.\r\n\r\n4. _The Lungs._--Hyperæmia of the lungs is rarely absent. In\r\nmost cases both lungs are engorged in about equal proportions.\r\nHypostasis--_post-mortem stains_--must not be mistaken for capillary\r\nengorgement.\r\n\r\n5. _The Heart._--Engorgement of the right side of the heart, the left\r\nbeing empty, or nearly so. It is advisable always to examine the heart\r\nfirst, and then the lungs. The pulmonary artery is also much congested.\r\n\r\n6. _Capillary Ecchymoses._--These appear as purplish-red spots on the\r\npulmonary pleuræ, on the surface of the heart, aorta, in the thymus,\r\nand on the diaphragm. They may appear on the above-mentioned parts in a\r\nfœtus suffocated _in utero_ by pressure on the cord. These ecchymoses\r\nare rarely seen on adults, most frequently on infants, due probably\r\nto the thinness of the coats of the capillaries, which are ruptured\r\nin the efforts made to breathe. They are not a positive sign of death\r\nfrom suffocation, as they have been seen in death due to cholera,\r\ntyphus, and other diseases. They are present also where death is due to\r\nhanging, drowning, &c.\r\n\r\n7. _Condition and Appearance of the Trachea._--The mucous membrane of\r\nthe trachea is injected, and appears of a cinnabar-red colour. This\r\nis present in every case of death by suffocation, and must not be\r\nconfounded with the dirty cherry-red or brownish-red coloration due\r\nto putrefaction. Remember also that the trachea putrefies early. If\r\nsuffocation be slowly produced, a quantity of frothy mucus may be found\r\nin the windpipe, and also in the smaller tubes of the lungs. Always\r\nexamine, especially in cases of supposed infanticide, the trachea for\r\nforeign bodies, the presence of soot, &c. The presence of sand, ashes,\r\n&c., in the œsophagus and stomach in persons buried in these materials,\r\nis presumptive of the person having been placed in them prior to death.\r\n\r\n8. _Kidneys, Vena Cava, &c._--The quantity of blood in the kidneys\r\nis always considerable. The abdominal veins are all more or less\r\ncongested, and the external surface of the intestines presents numerous\r\ntraces of venous congestion.\r\n\r\n9. _The Brain._--Apoplexy of the brain, as secondary to the pulmonary\r\napoplexy, may be more or less present, attended by its well-known\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n10. _Face, Tongue, and Mouth._--The expression of the face is not\r\ncharacteristic of death by suffocation, and differs in no particular\r\nfrom that common to other forms of death, being more frequently pale\r\nthan turgid; and the starting of the eyes, popularly ascribed to\r\nthis form of death, is not often seen. The tongue may or may not be\r\nprotruded beyond the teeth. The presence of _froth_ about the mouth is\r\nnot constant, and is of common occurrence in those dying from natural\r\ncauses. The tympanum may be ruptured.\r\n\r\n=Was the suffocation homicidal, suicidal, or accidental?=--Suffocation\r\nmay occur accidentally during the act of swallowing, and by foreign\r\nbodies placed carelessly in the mouth and then drawn suddenly into the\r\nwindpipe, or by blocking the pharynx or œsophagus, also from being\r\nsmothered by sinking into sand, grain, mud, and such-like, or by the\r\nbed-clothes in cases of epilepsy during a fit. Examine the lips for\r\nthe presence of ecchymosis and other marks of violence. A man, some\r\nyears ago, was accused of having caused the death of his wife by\r\nstrangulation, for which he was indicted, and tried before the High\r\nCourt of Justiciary in Scotland. The _post-mortem_ examination revealed\r\nthe cause of death as due to suffocation, and the following injuries\r\nwere found on dividing the windpipe, which contained a quantity of\r\nfrothy mucus: in the interior of the larynx there was a considerable\r\nextravasation of blood lying beneath the investing membrane, and\r\npassing up on both sides and behind, as far as the chink of the\r\nglottis, and above that opening into the ventricles of the larynx.\r\nThere was here, also, a fracture of the right wing of the thyroid\r\ncartilage, by which its lowest horn was wholly detached, and the\r\ncricoid cartilage was broken in two places at opposite sides of its\r\nring. The defence was that she had fallen accidentally while in a state\r\nof drunkenness, and had thus produced the fatal injuries.\r\n\r\nThe man was acquitted, the legal opinion in favour outweighing the\r\nmedical opinion against the theory of accident. The above case created\r\nsome discussion at the time, and induced Dr. Keiller to make several\r\nexperiments as to the possibility of fracturing the cartilages of the\r\nlarynx. The following are his conclusions:\r\n\r\n    1. That _ordinary_ falls on the human larynx are\r\n    apparently not capable of producing fractures of its\r\n    cartilages, and even _falls from a height with superadded\r\n    force_ appear to be unlikely to do so.\r\n\r\n    2. That _severe pressure applied from before\r\n    backwards_, so as strongly to compress the larynx against\r\n    the vertebral column, or _violent blows inflicted over the\r\n    larynx by means of a heavy body_, are sufficient to cause\r\n    fractures of the larynx. Fractures so produced, however,\r\n    will be most discernible on the _internal_ surface, and\r\n    generally _in or near the mesial line_.\r\n\r\n    3. _Violent compression_ applied to the _sides of\r\n    the larynx_ (as in ordinary _manual throttling or\r\n    strangulation by grasping_), is, of all applied forces,\r\n    the most likely to produce fractures of the alæ of the\r\n    thyroid cartilage, or even of the cricoid cartilage, and\r\n    fractures so produced are most perceptible, as well as most\r\n    extensive, on the _external_ surface of the larynx. By\r\n    this _lateral_ mode of applying force, the _hyoid\r\n    bone_ is almost most readily broken.\r\n\r\n    4. That the condition of the larynx in regard to the absence\r\n    or presence of ossific deposit materially influences\r\n    its liability to fracture from external violence. If\r\n    altogether cartilaginous, partial slits or splittings may\r\n    be produced. If partly ossified, fractures may be produced\r\n    by a comparatively moderate degree of applied violence,\r\n    and if extensively or entirely ossified, extreme violence\r\n    will generally be required to produce laryngeal fracture\r\n    (_Edinburgh Medical Journal_, 1855-56).\r\n\r\nHomicidal suffocation may be due to forcibly introducing foreign bodies\r\ninto the air-passages, especially in children; adults suffocated thus\r\nare generally under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or enfeebled\r\nfrom disease. Suicidal suffocation by these means is generally limited\r\nto lunatics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 16.--The pulse in this case became slower than\r\n         normal. Five minutes after the drop the type reached\r\n         that of bradycardia, then recovered itself, and even\r\n         14½ minutes after the drop was beating with normal\r\n         frequency, but in the meantime had become very feeble.\r\n\r\n    1.

The victims are generally old or enfeebled. Suffocation of\r\ninfants may be homicidal, or accidental, due to “overlaying”; in the\r\nlatter the greatest mortality is amongst the youngest infants. A child\r\nten months old may struggle and free itself or awaken the mother.\r\n\r\nIn France a favourite mode of committing suicide by suffocation is the\r\nuse of irrespirable gases--carbonic acid, carbon monoxide, and the\r\nlike. Collateral circumstances must be taken into consideration, and\r\nwill more or less help to point to the true cause of death.\r\n\r\nThe cause and nature of the death in all of its forms just mentioned\r\nare in general the same. Pressure on the trachea--thus arresting\r\nrespiration--and also on the important vessels and nerves of the neck,\r\nresults in death, which may be brought about in four different ways:\r\n\r\n    1. Cerebral congestion, or apoplexy.\r\n    2. Congestion of the lungs and heart--apnœa or asphyxia.\r\n    3. Combination of above--apoplexy and asphyxia or apnœa.\r\n    4. Neuro-paralysis--nervous apoplexy, or syncope.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the relative frequency of each form of\r\ndeath:\r\n\r\n                 Remer.  Casper.\r\n    Apoplexy       9       9\r\n    Asphyxia       6      14\r\n    Mixed         68      62\r\n                  --      --\r\n                  83      85\r\n                  --      --\r\n\r\n=Traumatic asphyxia= occurs when a heavy weight such as a fall of\r\nearth or masonry compresses the chest, and thoracic respiration is\r\nimpossible. The head and neck appear ecchymosed, the purplish-blue\r\nlividity generally ending abruptly at the lower part of the neck\r\nor upper part of the thorax, about the level of the clavicles.\r\nThe conjunctivæ are ecchymosed, and there may be epistaxis. This\r\ndiscoloration does not disappear on pressure by the finger, indicating\r\nits petechial character. If the person survive long enough, the\r\ndiscoloration gradually disappears, passing through the colour changes\r\nof an ordinary ecchymosis.\r\n\r\nThe effects on the eyes may be such as to be followed by changes in the\r\nretina, and optic atrophy leading to loss of vision.\r\n\r\nParts of the neck pressed upon by clothing may escape ecchymosis, and\r\npresent a white mark of almost normal skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGING\r\n\r\nDeath by hanging is caused by the more or less perfect suspension of\r\nthe body by a cord applied around the neck, the weight of the body\r\nacting as the constricting force.\r\n\r\nThe body need not hang completely, partial suspension is sufficient\r\nto cause death. The ligature surrounds the neck above the thyroid\r\ncartilage, the epiglottis is pushed against the back of the pharynx,\r\nthe base of the tongue and the soft parts are pressed into the cavity\r\nof the pharynx, so that the obliteration of the naso-pharyngeal and\r\nthe laryngeal passages is complete. Death is due to asphyxia and\r\npressure on the cervical blood-vessels, even if the air-passages be\r\nnot completely occluded; stoppage of the cerebral circulation being\r\nsufficient to cause death; in such a case the signs of asphyxia are\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nConsciousness is quickly lost, due to pressure on the vessels, and, for\r\nthis reason, in accidental or suicidal hanging the person is prevented\r\nfrom making any effort to save himself.\r\n\r\n=Post-mortem Appearances.=--The _external appearances_ are more or less\r\nthose described under “Death from suffocation.” In the greater number\r\nof cases the face bears a quiet, placid expression, no turgidity or\r\nlividity being noticeable. The eyes are usually half open, but not\r\nprotruded, and the condition of the pupils variable. The tongue may be\r\nprotruded, but just as often not. The face may be pale or livid, and\r\na bluish colour present on the free border of the lips. Cyanosis and\r\nswelling of the face are only present when the death agony has been\r\nlong; they soon disappear.\r\n\r\nEcchymosis of the conjunctiva, and on the outer surfaces of the lids\r\nmay be present. The escape of urine, fæces, and semen may take place,\r\nbut are not characteristic, and are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nCasper states that in not one of the many cases he had examined of\r\npersons hanged has he ever “found an erection of the male organ,”\r\nand he also asserts that the emission of semen is extremely rare.\r\nSeminal emissions take place more frequently in persons who have been\r\nshot, and also in those who have been poisoned by irrespirable gases\r\nor by hydrocyanic acid. As a test of strangulation, it is therefore\r\nworthless. Tardieu, however, only noticed the escape of urine and fæces\r\nin two out of forty-one cases; it is by no means a test of hanging, as\r\nit may occur after death if the body is shaken in a cart, or roughly\r\nused when first found. A fat person dying of apoplexy may have a mark\r\nround the neck as if strangled. Injury to the spinal cord due to\r\nfracture or dislocation of the cervical vertebræ is rare in suicidal\r\nhanging. Fracture of the spinal ligaments and of the hyoid bone is also\r\nrare. Rupture of the internal and middle coats of the carotid arteries\r\nsometimes occurs. But it appears that considerable damage is done to\r\nthe soft parts of the neck by the present judicial mode of hanging with\r\nthe “long drop.”\r\n\r\nDr. Dyer has recorded (_New York Medical Journal_, vol. iii., 1866)\r\nsome experiments he made on the eyes of a man and some dogs killed by\r\nhanging. He found certain transverse fissures across the lens, which he\r\nis inclined to think are characteristic of this mode of death. Dr. R.\r\nF. Hutchinson states that an invariable sign of death from hanging is\r\n_the flow of saliva out of the mouth, down the chin, and straight down\r\nthe chest_. The appearance is unmistakable and invariable, and _could\r\nnot occur in a body hung up after death_, the secretion of saliva being\r\na living act (Chevers). Death from hanging may take place although the\r\ntoes or other parts of the body rest on the ground. Death is complete\r\nin four or five minutes.\r\n\r\n=Marks of the Cord, &c.=--The mark of the cord is nearly always\r\npresent. It varies with the breadth and hardness of the ligature, but\r\nis often interrupted. Its irregularities are reproduced on the skin.\r\nIt is sometimes only seen on one side. In strangling, the mark is low\r\ndown, most frequently encircling the neck; in hanging, the mark is\r\ngenerally above or on the thyroid cartilage, and carried obliquely\r\nupwards. The mark of the cord may be of a dirty yellowish-brown colour,\r\nand, when cut into, feels more or less hard and leathery. In general\r\nappearance it is not unlike the mark left by mustard-plasters or\r\nblisters applied within a short time of death. This effect is probably\r\nproduced by the rubbing off of the epidermis, and subsequent drying up\r\nof the cutis on exposure to the air. At other times the mark may be of\r\na dirty reddish or bright blue colour; or, lastly, there may be little\r\nor no mark present, or the edges may assume a livid red coloration,\r\nbeing nothing more or less than a _post-mortem_ stain.\r\n\r\n=May the mark of the cord be produced after death?=--On this point\r\nCasper says: “That any ligature with which any body may be suspended\r\nor strangled, not only within a few hours, but even days after death,\r\nespecially if the body be forcibly pulled downwards, may produce a mark\r\nprecisely similar to that which is observed in most of those hanged\r\nwhile alive.” And the same authority also adds that “the mark of the\r\ncord is a purely cadaveric phenomenon.”\r\n\r\n=Accidental= hanging is rare, and generally happens with children\r\nwhile playing at hanging, or by accidentally becoming entangled in a\r\nwindow-blind cord or swing rope, or by the neck-band of an article of\r\nclothing by which they may become accidentally suspended from the spike\r\nof a railing.\r\n\r\n=Homicidal= hanging is rare, but the body may be suspended after death\r\nfrom violence, to simulate suicide; and it may have to be decided\r\nwhether the hanging took place during life or after death.\r\n\r\nThe mark of the cord is of no assistance, rents in the carotids with\r\nextravasation into the coats of the vessels indicate _ante-mortem_\r\nsuspension. The flow of saliva down the chin to the body indicates\r\nsuspension before death. It is important to examine the body for\r\ninjuries which could not be self-inflicted, and to remember the\r\npossibility of poison having been administered with suspension after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n=Suicidal= hanging is the most common, as it is a favourite mode of\r\ndeath with suicides. The absence of marks of injury on the body found\r\nsuspended, and the want of evidence as to a previous struggle having\r\ntaken place, all point to suicide. The fact that the feet are found in\r\ncontact with the ground does not militate against the probability of\r\nsuicidal hanging; and it appears that in India the natives seldom hang\r\nthemselves from any height, and are most frequently found with their\r\nfeet on the ground. A person may take poison first, and hang himself\r\nbefore the poison has had time to prove fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGLING\r\n\r\nDeath is due to pressure made on the neck by any form of ligature\r\ncarried circularly round the neck, without suspension. The cord in\r\nhanging is, as a rule, placed more obliquely than in strangling.\r\n\r\nThe mode of death is the same as in hanging. The _post-mortem_\r\nappearances are similar to those of hanging, practically those of\r\nasphyxia. The mark on the neck is the principal feature. In position\r\nit is generally horizontal and situated below or on a level with the\r\nthyroid cartilage. It more completely encircles the neck. It may be\r\ninterrupted in places if an irregular ligature has been used, causing\r\nirregular pressure. Its character depends largely upon the nature\r\nof the ligature. If the constriction has been uniform a continuous\r\ndepression is produced which may be marked by ecchymosis. If the skin\r\nhas been abraded, the line dries, and has a brownish, parchment-like\r\nappearance and feeling. If the ligature has been removed before life\r\nis quite extinct, the depressed line may disappear or be but slightly\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nA soft, broad ligature may leave no mark on the neck, if not applied\r\ntoo tightly, or for too long a time. Should the victim have been\r\nstrangled in the recumbent posture, and dragged upwards and backwards\r\nby the ligature, the mark will be on a slant as in hanging. According\r\nto the amount of violence used injuries may be caused to the deeper\r\nstructures of the neck, such as effusion of blood into muscles,\r\nfractures of the thyroid or cricoid cartilage; rupture of the tympanum\r\nand epistaxis may take place.\r\n\r\n=Accidental= strangulation may occur when a cord suspending a weight on\r\nthe back and passing across the chest slips and encircles or compresses\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nFalling out of bed, with entanglement in the clothes or nightdress, may\r\ncause strangling by tightening of the neck-band round the neck.\r\n\r\n=Homicidal= strangling is as common as homicidal hanging is rare.\r\nIt is difficult to hang a man, but easy to strangle him, because\r\nconsciousness is rapidly lost, and the victim is unable to offer any\r\nresistance once the cord is tightened round the neck. In homicidal\r\nstrangling the murderer generally uses a great deal more violence than\r\nis necessary, and so there is found after death much more local injury\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nSevere local injuries, such as fracture of the laryngeal cartilages or\r\nhyoid bone, denote homicide, as they are rarely noticed in suicidal\r\nstrangulation.\r\n\r\nThere may also be signs of general violence about the face, neck,\r\nchest, or other parts of the body. The position of the knot affords\r\nno material help, as the murderer may tie it in any position, but\r\nmore than one knot, especially if in different positions, points to\r\nhomicide. It must be remembered that finger-nails or other marks in\r\nthe vicinity of the ligature may be present in cases of suicides, from\r\nthe slipping of the cord or the determined attempts of the suicide\r\nto carry out the act, or plucking at the cord involuntarily. When a\r\nperson is first strangled, then hung, there would be two marks--one\r\nprobably horizontal, the other slanting.\r\n\r\n=Suicidal= strangulation is rare. The knot is generally adjusted at\r\nthe front or side of the neck, the cord may encircle the neck several\r\ntimes. Injuries to the deep structures of the neck are absent. Signs of\r\ngeneral violence are not necessarily present.\r\n\r\nIf there be two marks upon the neck, one due to an attempt at\r\nstrangulation, the other to suspension, in a suicide, the first would\r\nbe the less marked, the latter more pronounced, whereas in homicide the\r\nstrangulation mark would be most distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROTTLING\r\n\r\nThrottling is strangling by means of the hand or hands alone, and is\r\ndue to constant pressure of the fingers upon the throat. Very little\r\npressure is required to occlude the glottis; it can be done with\r\nslight pressure of the thumb and forefinger on the side of the thyroid\r\ncartilage.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the fingers and thumb upon the throat have\r\ncharacteristic marks. They are usually to be seen on both sides of the\r\nthroat. The thumb mark is on one side, and the marks of the fingers,\r\nseparated from one another or clustered together, are on the other,\r\nthe thumb mark being the highest. When grasped from the front by the\r\nright hand, the thumb mark will be on the right side of the throat.\r\nIf the victim be throttled by the two hands at the same time, as when\r\non the ground, the thumb marks are on the same side. If the assailant\r\nbe left-handed, and has used this hand to grip the throat, the thumb\r\nmark will be on the left side of the victim. The finger marks are one\r\nabove the other. The marks may appear as ecchymoses if the examination\r\nbe made soon after death; if later, they may appear and feel like\r\nparchment, and of a brownish colour. Crescentic marks of finger-nails\r\nmay be present, also other scratches in the vicinity. Other marks of\r\ngeneral violence may be present, and should the victim have fallen\r\nto the ground, the head may be injured. Much blood is effused in the\r\ntissues of the neck and the laryngeal cartilages, and the hyoid may be\r\nfound fractured; the carotids may escape injury, but not always.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the cheeks may be found lacerated. Where the\r\nvictim is thrown to the ground and knelt upon, fracture of the ribs and\r\necchymosis of the chest wall may occur.\r\n\r\nIn a case examined by me of combined strangling and throttling, marks\r\nof the ligature and fingers were both present, and on the clavicles\r\nseparate marks produced by the knuckles while tying the cord. These\r\nknuckle marks did not show up till some time after death. Effusions\r\nof blood were present in the tissues of the neck on each side of the\r\nlarynx, and amongst the muscles on both sides, and in the sheath of the\r\nleft carotid artery.\r\n\r\nThe hyoid bone was fractured in two places in its left half. The\r\nthyroid cartilage was fractured vertically on each side of the middle\r\nline into three pieces, the central portion having fallen behind the\r\nother two into the cavity of the larynx. The right wing of the thyroid\r\nwas comminuted. The cornua were fractured. The cricoid cartilage was\r\nalso fractured posteriorly, and into three pieces in front. Effusions\r\nof blood in the fractured areas had formed beneath the mucous membrane.\r\nEffusion of blood was present on the front wall of the pharynx and the\r\nupper part of the œsophagus. The right carotid artery was atheromatous,\r\nand linear and star-shaped fissures were present, the latter surrounded\r\nby a ring of sub-intimal effusion of blood.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the thorax the fifth rib was fractured at the\r\njunction with its cartilage, and on the left side the second, third,\r\nfourth, fifth, and sixth ribs were fractured close to their cartilages,\r\nand again from three to five inches further back. Blood effusions in\r\nthe tissues of the chest wall and under the pleuræ were present in the\r\nregion of the fractures.\r\n\r\nA handkerchief was found tight on the neck and tied with two knots\r\nboth fastened securely. It was probable that the handkerchief had been\r\ntied on after the throttling, as the knot ends were too short to allow\r\na sufficient pull on them to cause the injuries. Throttling may be\r\nregarded as a homicidal act; although one or two instances of suicidal\r\nthrottling have been recorded in the insane.\r\n\r\n=Judicial Hanging.=--In judicial hanging the prisoner is suspended by a\r\nrope with a running noose around the neck, after a sudden drop of from\r\nsix to eight feet according to the weight of the body. The noose may be\r\narranged with the knot or slip-ring fixed at the side below the ear, or\r\nin front so as to jerk the head backwards. The sudden and severe strain\r\nupon the neck produces fracture or dislocation of the spinal column\r\nat the second or third cervical vertebra, with rupture of the spinal\r\ncord. Other local injuries occur, such as rupture of cervical muscles,\r\nfracture of the larynx, and even lacerated wounds of the neck. The head\r\nhas even been severed completely from the body, and the deep structures\r\nof the neck have even been so lacerated that the body has hung by skin\r\nonly, stretched to the thickness of two or three fingers. Death is said\r\nto take place from shock, pressure on the vagi, and asphyxia, probably\r\nalso cerebral apoplexy. When death is instantaneous, the body hangs\r\nmotionless, the head fallen over the side opposite the knot, and the\r\nneck stretched.\r\n\r\nThe heart may, however, continue to beat for a varying period after\r\napparent death--in some cases even as long as 14½ minutes. The\r\nfollowing interesting series of pulse tracings were taken by Dr.\r\nLlewellyn Morgan, of Liverpool, and kindly placed at my disposal. In\r\nNo. 1 the heart beats could be recorded at the wrist for 14½ minutes\r\nafter the drop; in No. 2 for 12½ minutes; and in No. 3 for 12 minutes.\r\nThe frequency and character of the beat is variable, but in each case\r\nshows a practically normal rate towards the end. (See Figs. 16, 17, 18.)\r\n\r\nApart from the local injuries to the neck, the external appearances in\r\njudicial hanging are similar to those in other forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDROWNING\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath by drowning occurs when the breathing is arrested by watery or\r\nsemi-fluid substances, blood, urine, or the muddy semi-fluid matter\r\nfound in cesspools and marshes. It is not necessary for the whole body\r\nto be submerged. Death may result if the face alone be immersed, as in\r\nthe case of a man in a fit of drunkenness being drowned in the water\r\ncontained in the imprint of a horse‘s hoof left in the mud.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the changes in the internal organs, identical with those\r\npresent in persons who have died from suffocation or hanging, water is\r\nfound in the lungs or stomach.\r\n\r\nDeath may be due to--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Apoplexy.\r\n    (_b_) Asphyxia.\r\n    (_c_) A combination of the two.\r\n    (_d_) Neuro-paralysis.\r\n\r\nDeath from pure apoplexy is rare; and it may be affirmed that death\r\nfrom syncope never occurs in the drowned without leaving some signs of\r\nasphyxia.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to restore the drowned than those dying from mere\r\nstoppage of air from entering the lungs. Few if any persons recover who\r\nhave been submerged four minutes, and even in cases where this time has\r\nbeen exceeded, followed by recovery, this result is probably due to the\r\nperson fainting before entering the water.\r\n\r\nIn death from drowning, the lungs are distended and overlap the heart,\r\nand have a peculiar spongy feeling. They also contain a quantity of\r\nfrothy fluid, which cannot be produced in the dead body, as it is\r\nthe result of the violent efforts made by the individual to breathe\r\nin the act of dying. This frothy condition of the fluid in the lungs\r\nis an important sign of death by drowning, especially if the fluid\r\ncorresponds with that in which the individual is said to have perished.\r\nIt is just _possible_, however, that the person may have been first\r\nsuffocated, and then thrown into the water, froth in the trachea being\r\nfound in those suffocated; but in this case the froth is small in\r\nquantity, and not watery. The froth in the drowned is like that made\r\nwith soap and water, and is not viscid, thus differing from bronchitic\r\nexudation. Water in the stomach is an important indication of death\r\nfrom drowning, especially if the water contained in the stomach can\r\nbe shown to possess the same characters as that in which the body was\r\nfound. Water in the intestines is still more important. In a great\r\nnumber of cases this, however, must be next to impossible; when it can\r\nbe identified, the value of this sign is enhanced by the fact that\r\nwater does not enter the stomach in those submerged after death, unless\r\nputrefaction be far advanced, or the body has lain in very deep water.\r\nCasper concluded that a person had been drowned, by finding a small\r\nquantity of mud in the stomach after putrefaction had set in. Water,\r\nhowever, may be absent from the stomach if the person fall into the\r\nwater in a state of syncope, and it may be present if the person has\r\ntaken a draught of water before submersion.\r\n\r\nThe effect of season on putrefaction in water is shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n       Summer.                                Winter.\r\n\r\n      5 to 8 hours produce as much change as 3 to 5 days.\r\n          24   “      “         “            4 to 8   “\r\n           4 days     “         “                15   “\r\n    10 to 12   “      “         “          28 to 42   “\r\n                                                   (Devergie.)\r\n\r\nOf the external signs, the presence of sand, gravel, or mud under\r\nthe nails may or may not be an important sign, for sand or mud may\r\ncollect under the nails during the efforts to drag the body from the\r\nwater; but weeds, &c., grasped in the hands show that there has been a\r\nstruggle, and point to death from drowning. The _cutis anserina_--goose\r\nskin--present generally on the anterior surface of the body, and not,\r\nhowever, peculiar to death from drowning, is important as a sign of\r\nrecent vitality. The face of those who have been drowned, and then\r\nquickly removed from the water, is pale, and in most cases not swollen;\r\nthe eyes may or may not be closed; and not infrequently round the mouth\r\nthere is more or less froth, especially when death is due to apnœa. In\r\nsummer, however, after two or three days, and longer in winter, the\r\nface assumes a reddish or bluish-red coloration, putrefaction taking\r\nplace about the head and upper extremities earlier than in other forms\r\nof death. The _contraction or retraction of the penis_ is a well-marked\r\nsign of death by drowning, and Casper asserts that he has “not observed\r\nanything similar so constantly after any other kind of death.” Ogston\r\nstates that he has met with two cases of erection of the penis in the\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThe question as to how long a body may remain in the water before it\r\nfloats has given rise to considerable discussion, without, however,\r\narriving at any very definite conclusion. It may be stated in general\r\nterms that, as floating depends to some extent on the rapidity in which\r\nputrefaction supervenes on submersion, bodies float earlier in summer\r\nthan in winter, in salt than fresh water, clothed than naked. In India\r\nbodies have floated in twenty-four hours after immersion. Females and\r\nchildren float more readily than males. A body from various causes may\r\nfloat within a few hours of its submersion, especially if the body be\r\nthat of a female, fat and clothed. The old idea that the body of a\r\nperson thrown into water during life sinks, but that a dead body under\r\nlike conditions floats, is a fiction now exploded.\r\n\r\n=Suicide or Homicide?=--Homicide by drowning is rare, except in\r\nchildren. Accidental and suicidal drowning are common enough.\r\n\r\nThe signs to be sought for in the drowned are--(1) Absence of any\r\ninjury. (2) _Cutis anserina_ and retracted penis. (3) Water and mud in\r\nthe stomach. (4) Froth in the air-passages. (5) Distended lungs. (6)\r\nGeneral signs of death by asphyxia.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the fact of the hands being tied together,\r\nor to the feet, does not militate against suicide by drowning.\r\n\r\nIf wounds and other injuries be found on the body, the question\r\narises as to whether the injuries were sufficient in themselves to\r\ncause death, and then as to whether they were caused during life.\r\nA person jumping from a height into the water may sustain severe\r\ninjuries--dislocation of both arms, fracture of the skull and of\r\nthe vertebræ, or even lacerated wounds of more or less severity.\r\nThe absence of the signs proper to death by drowning, coupled with\r\nthe presence of external injuries, would point to death by violence\r\nprior to immersion. The presence of signs of drowning, and injuries,\r\nsufficient to have caused death in themselves, would indicate that they\r\nhad occurred after death.\r\n\r\nThe following considerations may assist in forming an opinion:\r\n\r\n    1. Previous history of person found in the water.\r\n         (_a_) Any history of suicidal tendency.\r\n         (_b_) Any motive that would render suicide probable.\r\n\r\n    2. Height from which the person fell.\r\n\r\n    3. Absence or presence of signs of death by drowning.\r\n\r\n    4. Absence of stakes or other objects in the water that might\r\n       have caused injuries to anyone falling against them.\r\n\r\nThe time required to cause death by drowning is so short that persons\r\nseldom recover after submersion for three or four minutes; but the\r\ncessation of respiration is no guide to the extinction of life, and an\r\nattempt at resuscitation should always be made, for if the respiration\r\nbe fairly restored the heart will soon act. Nay more, as pointed out\r\nbefore, in cases of so-called asphyxia, the heart may continue to act\r\nfor several minutes after the entrance of air to the lungs has been\r\narrested, and in judicial hanging it frequently happens that the pulse\r\nat the wrist can be felt for ten or twelve minutes after suspension.\r\n(See Figs. 16, 17, 18.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRecapitulation of the Post-mortem Appearances in the Drowned\r\n\r\n\r\nI. External\r\n\r\n1. _In the Skin._--Rose-coloured patches may be present on the face\r\nand neck. The condition of _goose skin_--_cutis anserina_--is hardly\r\never absent even in summer. The _cutis anserina_ is not, however,\r\ncharacteristic of drowning, as it may be present in other forms of\r\nviolent death, and also in some persons during life. It is a vital act,\r\nthe result of nervous shock, and does not depend upon the temperature\r\nof the water for its production; still, it points to recent vitality.\r\n\r\n2. _The Tongue._--The tongue is just as often found behind the jaws as\r\nbetween them (Casper).\r\n\r\n3. _The Hands and Feet._--The hands and feet acquire a greyish-blue\r\ncolour when the body has lain in the water from twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours. The skin also becomes corrugated in longitudinal folds. The\r\ngreyish-blue condition of the hand is known as the “cholera hand.”\r\nThe nails may contain particles of sand and weeds. “No corrugation or\r\ndiscoloration of the skin of the hands or feet is ever observed on\r\nthe body of anyone drowned who has been taken out of the water within\r\nhalf an hour, within two, six, or even eight hours” (Casper). The same\r\nauthority states he has produced these effects by laying the hands\r\nafter death in water, or wrapping them in cloths kept constantly wet\r\nfor a few days.\r\n\r\n4. _The Genitals._--Contraction of the penis and dartos is an almost\r\nconstant symptom, and Casper has “not observed anything similar so\r\nconstantly after any other kind of death.” It is due, probably, to\r\nthe same cause as the _cutis anserina_, which Brettner attributes to\r\n“bundles of unstriped muscular fibres, lying in the upper stratum of\r\nthe true skin, surrounding the sebaceous glands, and forcing them\r\nforwards by their contraction, thus making the _cutis anserina_.\r\nPrecisely similar unstriped muscles are found in the subcutaneous\r\ncellular tissue of the penis; they run principally parallel to the long\r\naxis of the member, but very often large bundles run across it.” The\r\naction of cold and fright is to induce contraction of these cutaneous\r\nmuscles, with a resulting contraction of the penis.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Internal\r\n\r\n1. _The Brain._--Cerebral hyperæmia is _most_ rare in the drowned, but\r\ncerebral hypostasis is not infrequently mistaken for it.\r\n\r\n2. _The Trachea._--The mucous membrane of the trachea and larynx is\r\nalways more or less injected, and is of a cinnabar-red, which must\r\nnot be mistaken for the dirty, brownish-red colour, the result of\r\nputrefaction. A white froth, but seldom bloody, is also found in\r\nvarying quantity in the trachea, and is a most important sign of vital\r\nreaction, but its diagnostic value is destroyed by putrefaction.\r\nSometimes a portion of the contents of the stomach may be found in the\r\ntrachea. When this occurs it is due to the act of coughing, induced by\r\nthe admission of water into the lungs. The contents of the stomach are\r\nforced into the mouth, and then drawn into the lungs during the next\r\nattempt at inspiration. This indicates that the person entered the\r\nwater during life. In cases where death has taken place from syncope\r\nlittle or no froth may be found in the trachea.\r\n\r\n3. _The Lungs._--The lungs are completely distended, almost entirely\r\noverlapping the heart, and pressing close to the ribs. They are spongy\r\nto the feel, and when cut into, a considerable quantity of bloody froth\r\nescapes. The _froth_ found in the lungs is the result of the powerful\r\nattempts to breathe, and cannot be produced by artificial means. It\r\nadheres not to the sides of the bronchial tubes, as does the exudation\r\nof bronchitis or pneumonia. The distension of the lungs is due partly\r\nto an actual hyperæmia, and partly to inhaled fluid. Water is present\r\nin the pleural cavities.\r\n\r\n4. _The Heart and Great Vessels._--As is common to other forms of\r\nasphyxia, the left side of the heart is entirely, or almost entirely,\r\nempty; the right, on the contrary, is engorged. This condition of the\r\nheart is, therefore, not a diagnostic sign of drowning, and is absent\r\nin the drowned when death takes place by neuro-paralysis; in fact, in\r\nsome cases of undoubted drowning, both sides have been found empty,\r\nprobably, however, the result of putrefaction (Ogston). The same may be\r\nsaid of the accompanying congestion of the pulmonary artery.\r\n\r\n5. _The Blood._--As is common in all forms of death where respiration\r\nhas been arrested, the blood is found to be remarkably _fluid_, and of\r\na cherry-juice colour. M. Faure in his monograph on asphyxia states\r\nthat he has found large and firm clots in the right side of the heart\r\nin the drowned who have not remained long under water. The blood is\r\ndiluted with water, most marked in the left side of the heart. The\r\namount of dilution is greater in slow drowning.\r\n\r\n6. _The Stomach._--Casper considers that the presence of fluid in the\r\nstomach, corresponding to that in which the body is found, is “an\r\nirrefragable proof of the actual occurrence of death from drowning,”\r\nand that the swallowing of it must have been a vital act of the\r\nindividual dying in the water. The absence of water from the stomach\r\ndoes not negative death from drowning. Water is not always present. It\r\nis possible for it to reach the stomach of a submerged body after death.\r\n\r\nWater in the intestines is a more reliable sign of death from drowning,\r\nand indicates submersion during life. It is only after very long\r\nsubmersion and under great pressure that water finds its way into the\r\nintestines after death.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--Putrefaction in the drowned in most cases\r\n        commences in the upper part of the body, and extends\r\n        downwards. The face, head, and neck are first attacked.\r\n        This is the reverse of putrefaction in air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDEATH FROM STARVATION, COLD, HEAT, BY LIGHTNING AND ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH FROM STARVATION\r\n\r\nDeath from starvation may be due to the total withdrawal of food, to\r\nprolonged insufficiency, defective quality, inability to swallow it,\r\nand inability to retain it.\r\n\r\nDeath from starvation may occur during famines, amongst ship-wrecked\r\nsailors, and persons entombed in mines or pits, and is due to sheer\r\nprivation. It may follow criminal starvation, wilful refusal to take\r\nfood as a form of suicide, and it has been noted in cases of hysteria\r\nand lunacy.\r\n\r\nIt may result from mechanical hindrance to the entrance of food\r\ninto the body from ankylosis of the jaws, or its passage through\r\nthe alimentary tract from stricture of the œsophagus or stomach,\r\nfrom cancer or cicatrisation after injury from swallowing corrosive\r\nsubstances. Amongst other diseases, tuberculosis, malignant disease,\r\nand diabetes mellitus are the chief which produce external appearances\r\nof starvation.\r\n\r\nIn the withdrawal or deprivation of food for criminal purposes the\r\nvictims are usually old, helpless, or feeble-minded persons, or young\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSymptoms.--These depend on the previous state of nutrition. Starvation\r\nmay be regarded as acute when death occurs within fourteen days from\r\nthe withdrawal of food, chronic when at a longer period.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of hunger vary: they are said to pass off in forty-eight\r\nhours, but may last for several days acutely.\r\n\r\nThe body temperature falls below normal, and the fall may be two\r\nor three degrees before death. The pulse gradually increases in\r\nfrequency day by day. The chief sign is loss of body weight. Chossat‘s\r\nexperiments on pigeons showed that when they were totally deprived\r\nof food, the surplus fat of the body was lost first, then the fatty\r\ncoverings of internal organs, the interstitial fat of muscles last of\r\nall; the muscles themselves also wasted. A peculiar odour like acetone\r\nemanates from those who have been starved, and towards and after death\r\nthe odour is putrescent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above signs, there are anæmia, sunken, glistening\r\neyes with dilated pupils, prominence of bony projections, pale and dry\r\nlips and tongue, parched mouth and throat, weakness of the voice,\r\nsunken abdomen, wasted limbs, constipated bowels, urine scanty and\r\nturbid. There are pains in the abdomen, relieved by pressure; great\r\nthirst, a dusky, dry skin, occasionally purpuric eruptions, exhaustion,\r\nultimately delirium ending in death.\r\n\r\n=Post-mortem Appearances.=--There is emaciation of the whole body, dry,\r\nwrinkled skin of a brown colour; the muscles are flabby and wasted, the\r\nabdomen sunken, the eyes red and open; this appearance is not common in\r\ndeath from other causes. The mouth and throat are dry even to aridity.\r\nThe heart, lungs, and blood-vessels are collapsed, and contain but\r\nlittle blood. The abdominal viscera are shrunken and without enveloping\r\nfat. The omentum is devoid of fat, and clear; the gall bladder is full\r\nof dark bile; the urinary bladder may be quite empty. The stomach\r\nand intestines are collapsed, contracted, and empty, and the walls\r\nextremely thinned.\r\n\r\n=Diagnosis.=--The absence of any other cause of death--such as cancer\r\nof the stomach, stricture of the œsophagus, &c.--and the previous\r\nhistory of the case will assist in forming an opinion, care being\r\ntaken not to confound the results of wasting disease with those due to\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n=Legal Relations.=--The question of death from starvation may be\r\nraised in a case of infanticide by omission. Although rare as an act\r\nof homicide, it must be remembered that the law does not require the\r\nabsolute deprivation of food to be proved, but only that the necessary\r\nquantity and quality of food has been withheld; but malice at the same\r\ntime must be proved. In cases of infanticide by starvation, the mother\r\nand not the father is responsible for the proper feeding of the child;\r\nbut in the case of an apprentice, the master and not his wife is bound\r\nto supply proper food to such apprentice.\r\n\r\nIn questions of survivorship, and in criminal cases, the medical\r\nwitness may be asked how long a person may survive after complete\r\nwithdrawal of food. Little is known as to the length of time required\r\nto cause death by starvation, but it is certain that life may be\r\nprolonged for some time without food, if water be allowed. Starvation\r\nis less rapid in its effects if the body be kept warm. In a case\r\nrecorded in the _Lancet_, a man who had been shut up in a coal-mine\r\nfor twenty-three days, with only a little dirty water to drink, lived\r\nthree days after his liberation, and then died of exhaustion. In adults\r\nthe average is from seven to ten days without water. Tidy (_Legal\r\nMedicine_, vol. i. p. 392) is of the opinion that the young die first,\r\nthen adults, and the aged last. Taking into account the enfeebled\r\nvitality of the aged, it is more probable that the young or middle-aged\r\nadult would survive the longest. Where water is freely obtainable, life\r\nmay be prolonged to the fifty-eighth day (_Foderé_, vol. ii. p. 276) or\r\neven more.\r\n\r\nApart from age, account must be taken of the condition of the person in\r\nreference to bodily health prior to the withdrawal of food.\r\n\r\nThe following tables, showing the average weight and height of\r\nchildren up to twelve years of age, are from the Report of the British\r\nAnthropometric Committee (1883):\r\n\r\n    Male Children\r\n\r\n    +------------+-----------+\r\n    |    Age.    | Weight in |\r\n    |            | Pounds.   |\r\n    +------------+-----------+\r\n    | At birth   |    6.8    |\r\n    | One month  |    7.4    |\r\n    | Two months |    8.4    |\r\n    | Three  “   |    9.6    |\r\n    | Four   “   |   10.8    |\r\n    | Five   “   |   11.8    |\r\n    | Six    “   |   12.4    |\r\n    | Seven  “   |   13.4    |\r\n    | Eight  “   |   14.4    |\r\n    | Nine   “   |   15.8    |\r\n    | Ten    “   |   16.8    |\r\n    | Eleven “   |   17.8    |\r\n    | Twelve “   |   18.8    |\r\n    +------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n    +------------+-------------------+-------------------+\r\n    |            | Height in Inches. | Weight in Pounds. |\r\n    |   Age.     +----------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n    |            | Female.  | Male.  | Female. | Male.   |\r\n    +------------+----------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n    | One year   |  27.5    | 33.50  |  ....   |  18.8   |\r\n    | Two years  |  32.33   | 33.70  |  25.3   |  32.5   |\r\n    | Three   “  |  36.23   | 36.82  |  31.6   |  34.0   |\r\n    | Four    “  |  38.26   | 38.46  |  36.1   |  37.3   |\r\n    | Five    “  |  40.55   | 41.03  |  39.2   |  39.9   |\r\n    | Six     “  |  42.88   | 44.00  |  41.7   |  44.4   |\r\n    | Seven   “  |  44.45   | 45.97  |  47.5   |  49.7   |\r\n    | Eight   “  |  46.60   | 47.05  |  52.1   |  54.9   |\r\n    | Nine    “  |  48.73   | 49.70  |  55.5   |  60.4   |\r\n    | Ten     “  |  51.05   | 51.84  |  62.0   |  67.5   |\r\n    | Eleven  “  |  53.10   | 53.50  |  68.1   |  72.0   |\r\n    | Twelve  “  |  55.66   | 54.59  |  76.4   |  76.7   |\r\n    +------------+----------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n     Table of Ages, Heights, and Weights of Males and Females\r\n                  from 13 to 30-35 Years of Age\r\n    +---------------+------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n    |               |         Males.         |        Females.       |\r\n    |               +------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n    | Years of Age. | Height in  | Weight in | Height in | Weight in |\r\n    |               | Inches.    | Pounds.   | Inches.   | Pounds.   |\r\n    +---------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n    |      13       |   56.91    |    82.6   |   57.77   |    87.2   |\r\n    |      14       |   59.33    |    92.0   |   59.80   |    96.7   |\r\n    |      15       |   62.24    |   102.7   |   60.93   |   106.3   |\r\n    |      16       |   64.31    |   119.0   |   61.75   |   113.1   |\r\n    |      17       |   66.24    |   130.9   |   62.52   |   115.5   |\r\n    |      18       |   66.96    |   137.4   |   62.44   |   121.1   |\r\n    |      19       |   67.29    |   139.6   |   62.75   |   123.8   |\r\n    |      20       |   67.52    |   143.3   |   62.98   |   123.4   |\r\n    |      21       |   67.63    |   145.2   |   63.03   |   121.8   |\r\n    |      22       |   67.68    |   146.9   |   62.87   |   123.4   |\r\n    |      23       |   67.48    |   147.8   |   63.01   |   124.1   |\r\n    |      24       |   67.73    |   148.0   |   62.70   |   120.8   |\r\n    |    25-30      |   67.80    |   152.3   |   62.02   |   120.0   |\r\n    |    30-35      |   68.00    |   159.8   |   61.15   |   120.8   |\r\n    +---------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nRecapitulation of the Post-mortem Appearances of Death by Starvation\r\n\r\n1. _In the Body generally._--Marked general emaciation of the body.\r\nThe skin is dry and shrivelled, sometimes more or less covered with\r\nunhealthy-looking pimples, the muscles soft, reduced in size, and free\r\nfrom fat. A peculiar fœtid acrid odour is given off from the body.\r\n\r\n2. _In the Solid Viscera of the Thorax and Abdomen._--The liver is\r\nsmall, the gall-bladder distended with bile, and the heart and kidneys\r\ndeprived of any surrounding fat. All the internal organs are shrivelled\r\nand bloodless.\r\n\r\n3. _In the Stomach and Intestines._--The stomach in some cases is quite\r\nhealthy, but more or less stained with bile; in others it is found\r\ncollapsed, contracted, empty, and the mucous membrane more or less\r\nulcerated. The intestines are thin, contracted, empty, and so shrunken\r\nthat the canal is almost obliterated. According to the late Dr. Duncan,\r\nthe intestines are frequently found inflamed and ulcerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH FROM COLD\r\n\r\nThis form of death is rare in England, but is more common in countries\r\nwhere the winters are severe. Anything that depresses the vital powers\r\nrenders the individual more or less susceptible to cold; such, for\r\ninstance, as drunkenness, previous illness, or deficiency in the amount\r\nof food. The following _post-mortem_ appearances are given by Ogston,\r\nwho holds that they point, in the absence of any other obvious cause of\r\ndeath, “if not with absolute certainty, yet with high probability,” to\r\ndeath caused by cold:\r\n\r\n    1. An arterial hue of the blood generally, except when\r\n       viewed in mass within the heart; the presence of this\r\n       coloration not having been noted in two instances.\r\n\r\n    2. An unusual accumulation of blood, as in Quelmalz and\r\n       Cappel‘s cases, on both sides of the heart, and in the\r\n       larger blood-vessels of the chest, arterial and venous.\r\n\r\n    3. Pallor of the general surface of the body, and anæmia of\r\n       the viscera most largely supplied with blood. The only\r\n       exceptions to this were moderate congestion of the brain\r\n       in three cases, and of the liver in seven of them.\r\n\r\n    4. Irregular and diffused dusky-red patches--“frost\r\n       erythems”--on limited portions of the exterior of the\r\n       bodies, encountered in non-dependent parts, these\r\n       patches contrasting forcibly with the pallor of the skin\r\n       and general surface.\r\n\r\nThese signs are not so well marked in children as in adults. The late\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie considered that the effect of cold is to destroy\r\nthe principle of vitality equally in every part, and that it does not\r\nexclusively disturb the functions of any particular organ. The fact of\r\na body being found frozen is no proof that death has been brought about\r\nby cold.\r\n\r\nSymptoms.--Exposure to severe cold produces loss of energy, lethargy,\r\nfollowed by drowsiness, with an intense desire to sleep, which, if\r\ngratified, passes on to stupor and coma. There may be delusions before\r\nthe coma. The primary cause of death is attributed to the lessened\r\ndissociation of oxygen from the hæmoglobin to the tissues, and a\r\nlessened power of the latter to utilise it.\r\n\r\n=Diagnosis.=--The general appearance of the deceased, and the absence\r\nof any other cause of death, together with the appearances just\r\nmentioned, will assist in forming an opinion on this difficult subject.\r\nThe body lies as if in a deep and calm, sleep, without any external\r\nappearance to guide us as to the cause of death, except perhaps a\r\nswelling of the extremities, which has come on prior to death. If a\r\nbody be found buried in snow, and putrefaction present, death did not\r\nin all probability take place from cold, provided that the cold has\r\nbeen severe and continuous. Death from cold is generally accidental,\r\nexcept in newly-born children, when it may be either accidental or\r\nhomicidal, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen freezing of the body has taken place prior to the onset of _rigor\r\nmortis_, the latter comes on after the body thaws. This, combined with\r\nthe other _post-mortem_ signs given above, affords evidence of the\r\nstrong probability that death had resulted from exposure to cold. In\r\nview of the red colour of the skin being similar to that caused by\r\npoisoning with CO, a spectroscopic examination of the blood should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH FROM EXPOSURE TO HEAT\r\n\r\nThe results from exposure to excessive heat manifest themselves in\r\nvarious ways. Any condition which may lessen the resistance of the\r\nbody to external heat predisposes to heat-stroke; such as privation,\r\nfatigue, mental emotions, alcohol, over-eating, and especially previous\r\nattacks of the disease.\r\n\r\n=Sunstroke= occurs in those who work under the direct rays of the sun,\r\nwhen the air is hot, still, and humid.\r\n\r\n=Heat-stroke= or thermic fever affects those working in places which\r\nare excessively hot and confined, as in glass-works, foundries,\r\nstoke-holds, boiler-houses, sugar-refineries, paper-mills, &c.\r\n\r\n=Heat exhaustion= and prostration are brought about in a similar\r\nmanner, but the effects are not the same, and usually transient and\r\nless severe.\r\n\r\nSunstroke or heat-stroke may occur in two forms, the _asphyxial_ or\r\n_apoplectic_, and the _hyperpyrexial_; it is also classified as sthenic\r\nor asphyxial, and asthenic or syncopal.\r\n\r\n_Asphyxial_ sunstroke or _heat apoplexy_ is probably the least\r\nfrequent; prodromal symptoms are headache, vertigo, disturbances of\r\nvision, dyspnœa, and dry skin. In some cases sudden unconsciousness,\r\nwith or without convulsions, may occur, and death rapidly follows.\r\n\r\nThe coma may not be profound; there may be nausea and vomiting of dark\r\nmaterial, bounding pulse, stertorous breathing, contracted pupils, and\r\nfrequent micturition. The body exhales a “mousey odour.” There may be\r\ninvoluntary dejection, with the same pungent odour, and very watery.\r\nDelirium is present in some cases. The temperature may be subnormal,\r\nor rise to 102° F., occasionally even to 106° F. When fatal, the coma\r\ndeepens, the pulse becomes rapid and feeble, and there is Cheyne-Stokes\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nIn _Hyperpyrexial_ cases the symptoms are similar to the asphyxial, but\r\nthe temperature may reach 110-115° F., and in profound coma death takes\r\nplace from asphyxia. A subconscious or automatic state, in which the\r\nperson may go on working, may precede the “stroke.”\r\n\r\nIn cases which are not so rapid, pneumonia, meningitis, cardiac and\r\nrespiratory paralysis may occur and prove fatal.\r\n\r\n_Heat exhaustion_ may be more gradual in its onset, or come on\r\nsuddenly. Prodromal dizziness, faintness, nausea, headache, drowsiness,\r\nepigastric and lumbar pains may precede the prostration and muscular\r\nweakness. Fever supervenes, a rapid pulse, and in severe cases\r\ncollapse. Consciousness is seldom completely lost, and in favourable\r\ncases is quickly regained. When there is marked prostration the heart\r\nmay fail.\r\n\r\nThe condition known as _heat prostration_ is a milder form, in which\r\nthere is little or no fever, and the circulation remains good.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering from an attack of heat-stroke certain sequelæ have\r\nbeen noted. The patients are rendered sensitive to slight elevations\r\nof temperature, and, during warm weather, experience chromatopsia,\r\nheadaches, irritability, irascibility, and even delirium. Epilepsy\r\nand insanity may persist during life. Fiske from his investigations\r\nconcludes that the habits of those working in hot atmospheres, and the\r\ndegree of temperature, are not nearly so important as the absence of\r\nthorough ventilation as causative factors in the disease.\r\n\r\n=Post-mortem Appearances.=--_Rigor mortis_ comes on early, and is\r\npronounced and disappears quickly. Putrefaction is early in onset. The\r\nbrain and cord, the lungs and spleen and splanchnic area exhibit venous\r\nengorgement.\r\n\r\nThe blood is fluid, and the red corpuscles crenated. Extravasations of\r\nblood may be present in the skin, the serous membranes, and cavities,\r\nthe superior sympathetic ganglia, and the vagi and phrenics. The left\r\nventricle is markedly contracted, the right dilated and filled with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nVan Gieson records acute parenchymatous degeneration of the whole of\r\nthe cerebro-spinal nervous system, with chromatolysis of the cells.\r\nParenchymatous changes may be present in the liver and kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH BY LIGHTNING AND ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING\r\n\r\nDeath is not always immediate. Sometimes the clothes have been torn\r\noff the body with scarcely any personal injury. _Metallic articles,\r\nespecially steel, worn or carried about the person become magnetic_ and\r\nmay be fused. The lesions which may be met with after lightning-stroke\r\nare varied, and may comprise wounds of almost any description;\r\nsimple, compound, or comminuted fractures of bones; burns in the form\r\nof streaks, patches, lines, or arborescent markings; ecchymoses;\r\nsingeing of the hair; impressions of metallic articles on the skin.\r\nApart from the lesions noted above, the following symptoms may be\r\npresent: deafness, blindness, paralysis, loss of memory, delirium,\r\nand convulsions. Not infrequently those killed by lightning are found\r\nin the same position that they occupied during life. The question may\r\narise as to whether the deceased died by lightning or violence. The\r\npresence of a storm at the time when death is stated to have occurred,\r\nand other attendant circumstances, will in most cases point to the true\r\ncause of death. Metallic articles should be examined with regard to\r\ntheir electric state. Dr. Honiball tenders this caution: “Be not too\r\nsure that in every body found dead after a thunderstorm, and where no\r\nmarks upon it are found, that death was due to lightning-stroke, for it\r\nmay happen that death was due solely to cardiac syncope owing to sudden\r\nand startling fright.”\r\n\r\n=Post-mortem Appearances.=--Apart from the external injuries, when\r\npresent, _post-mortem_ rigidity comes on early. The head and neck\r\nmay be purplish in colour, the eyes partially open and suffused,\r\nwith variable pupils. The internal signs are not characteristic. The\r\nmembranes and vessels of the brain may be hyperæmic. The blood has been\r\nsaid to be very fluid, but it may be coagulated. The internal organs\r\nmay be torn, bones may be fractured, and blood-vessels ruptured.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial Electricity\r\n\r\nWith the increased use of electricity for motive power and illumination\r\ninstances of injury and even death have occurred, and probably will\r\nbecome more frequent. One of the most important safeguards of the body\r\nagainst the effects of electricity is its high degree of resistance,\r\nespecially if the body surface be dry. Moisture of the body surface\r\nlessens the resistance and increases the liability to injurious effects.\r\n\r\nThe body is a bad conductor; it is said to be three million times less\r\nthan mercury, and fifteen million times less than copper; the nerves\r\nconduct like metals. The danger of electric shocks depends upon the\r\namount of current passing through the body, the kind of contact, and\r\nthe insulation of the body at the time. Moisture of the body or clothes\r\nwill increase the effects of the shock. Much depends upon the quality,\r\nduration, strength, and density of the current, and the direction in\r\nwhich it passes.\r\n\r\nThe continuous current is less severe than the interrupted, and the\r\nalternating is the most powerful in its effects. An alternating current\r\nof 300 volts has caused death, and one of 1500 volts would certainly\r\nprove fatal, whereas for the continuous current it would take 3000\r\nvolts to prove fatal.[13] Cases are recorded when with good contact\r\neven so low as 65 volts has proved fatal. The Board of Trade forbids\r\nthe introduction into dwelling-houses of currents of more than 250\r\nvolts, unless for special purposes and with special permission.\r\n\r\n[13] Cunningham, _New York Med. Journ._, 1890, p. 287.\r\n\r\nAs the current enters or leaves the body it may cause local injury.\r\nTetanic muscular contractions with pain, and pain from stimulation of\r\nnerve endings in the skin with erythema may occur. Burns produced by\r\nelectricity may be accompanied by much local destruction of tissue and\r\nslow healing.\r\n\r\nThere may be ascending neuritis from injury to nerves.\r\n\r\nThe shock may cause insensibility with pallor and stertorous breathing;\r\nthe skin is moist, the eyes suffused, and the pupils dilated.\r\n\r\nDeath is due to (1) inhibition of the medulla oblongata, or (2) direct\r\naction on the heart muscle. According to the researches of Cunningham,\r\ncurrents which traverse the whole body transversely or longitudinally\r\nproduce fibrillary contraction of the heart muscle. When the current\r\npasses through the brain, medulla, and upper cord it may cause death\r\nby respiratory paralysis. Those who have recovered from severe shock\r\ndescribe the sensation as peculiar rather than painful.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These include the local injury, if any,\r\nat the point or points of contact, some hyperæmia of the internal\r\norgans, œdema of the lungs, and fluidity of the blood. The general\r\nappearances are those of asphyxia. Kratter considers that external\r\nburns in association with subpericardial and subpleural ecchymoses, and\r\nespecially subendocardial petechiæ, also the presence of congestion of\r\nthe bronchi, strongly indicate death from electricity.\r\n\r\nMinute hæmorrhages may occur in the meninges, and in the fourth and\r\nother ventricles. Changes have also been described in the cells of the\r\ncentral nervous system in experiments upon animals.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The current should be switched off at once; the patient\r\nshould be removed from the conductor, the rescuer being protected with\r\nsome insulating material, the attempt should not be made bare-handed.\r\n\r\nStimulation, warmth, and artificial respiration should be resorted\r\nto. After respiration has been re-established, friction should be\r\napplied to the body. The treatment should be persevered in for several\r\nhours. Signs of life may not be seen for two hours. Venesection may be\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nOFFENCES AGAINST CHASTITY\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPE\r\n\r\nAccording to the Statute 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, sec. 48, rape in\r\nEngland is defined as the “carnal knowledge of a woman against her\r\nwill.” In Scotland rape is held to be “the carnal knowledge of a woman\r\nforcibly, and against her will, or of a girl below twelve years of age,\r\nwhether by force or not” (Hume, i. 303). An Act passed in 1885 (48 and\r\n49 Vict. c. 69) has materially affected the law on this subject as\r\nregards the age of females. To constitute the offence of rape, there\r\nmust be _penetration_, but proof of the actual emission of semen is\r\nnot now necessary. Before the Statute 9 Geo. IV. c. 31, sec. 18, it\r\nwas also necessary to prove emission, which might be proved either\r\npositively by the evidence of the woman that she felt it, or it might\r\nbe presumed from circumstances; as, for instance, that the defendant,\r\nafter connection with the prosecutrix, arose from her voluntarily\r\nwithout being interrupted in the act. The slightest penetration of the\r\nmale organ within the vulva will be sufficient, and the hymen need not\r\nbe ruptured (R. _v._ Russen, 1 East P.C. 438, 439). The resistance of\r\nthe woman must be to the utmost of her power. If, however, the woman\r\nyield through fear or duress, it is still rape; but of course much\r\nwill depend upon the previous character of the woman, and her conduct\r\nsubsequent to the alleged outrage. The party ravished is a competent\r\nwitness to prove this and every other part of the case; but the\r\ncredibility of her testimony must be left to the jury. The defendant\r\nmay produce evidence of the woman‘s notoriously bad character for want\r\nof chastity or common decency, or that she had before been connected\r\nwith the prisoner himself; but he cannot give evidence of any other\r\nparticular facts to impeach her chastity (R. _v._ Hodgson, R. & R.\r\n211). She may be asked if she has had connection with other men, but\r\nshe need not answer (R. _v._ Cockcroft, 11 Cox, 410, per Willis, J.).\r\nIf she deny connection with the men named to her, they cannot be called\r\nto contradict her (R. _v._ Holmes, L.R. 1 C.C.R. 334).\r\n\r\nA rape, according to Scottish law, may be committed on a common\r\nstrumpet; and in England the law goes even further, and admits the\r\npossibility of rape on the concubine of the ravisher (1 Hale, 729),\r\n“although such circumstances should certainly operate strongly with\r\nthe jury as to the probability of the fact that connection was had\r\nwith a woman against her will.” A husband may be guilty of rape on his\r\nwife if he hold her while another violates her, as in the case of the\r\nEarl of Castlehaven, tried in 1637. Carnal knowledge of a woman by\r\nfraud, which induces her to suppose it is her husband, now constitutes\r\na rape by the 48 and 49 Vict c. 69, which enacts that “whereas doubts\r\nhave been entertained whether a man who induces a married woman to\r\npermit him to have connection with her by personating her husband, is\r\nor is not guilty of rape, it is hereby enacted and declared that every\r\nsuch offender shall be deemed to be guilty of rape.” It has also been\r\ndecided that if a man get into bed with a woman while she is asleep,\r\nand he know she is asleep, and he have connection with her while in\r\nthat state, he is guilty of rape (R. _v._ Mayers, 12 Cox, 311, per\r\nLush, J.). The offence of rape is not triable at quarter sessions.\r\n\r\nUpon an indictment for rape, there must be some evidence that the act\r\nwas without the consent of the woman, even when she is an idiot. In\r\nsuch a case, where there was no appearance of force having been used to\r\nthe woman, and the only evidence of the connection was the prisoner‘s\r\nown admission, coupled with the statement that it was done with her\r\nconsent, the Court held that there was no evidence for the jury (R.\r\n_v._ Fletcher, L.R. 1 C.C.R. 39).\r\n\r\nIn another case, where the prisoner was caught in the act by the father\r\nof an idiot girl, the learned judge told the jury that if the prisoner\r\nhad connection with the prosecutrix by force, and if she was in such\r\nan idiotic state that she did not know what the prisoner was doing,\r\nand if the prisoner was aware of her being in that state, they might\r\nfind him guilty of rape; but if, from animal instinct, she yielded to\r\nthe prisoner without resistance, or if the prisoner, from her state\r\nand condition, had reason to believe she was consenting, they ought to\r\nacquit him. The jury found that he was guilty of an attempt at rape (R.\r\n_v._ Barrat, L.R. 2 C.C. 81).\r\n\r\nWhere the prosecutrix, an apparent idiot, proved that the prisoner had\r\nhad connection with her, but it appeared from her examination that\r\nthough she knew he was doing wrong, she made no resistance, and the\r\nprisoner, on being apprehended and charged with committing a rape upon\r\nthe prosecutrix “against her will,” said “Yes, I did, and I‘m very\r\nsorry for it,” it was held that there was evidence to go to the jury of\r\na rape (R. _v._ Pressy, 10 Cox, 635).\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, in the case of Hugh M‘Namara (H.C. July 24, 1848, Ark.\r\n521), where the woman was only one degree removed from idiocy, it was\r\nlaid down that “if she had shown any physical resistance, to however\r\nsmall an extent, the offence would be complete, in consequence of her\r\ninability to give a mental consent.”\r\n\r\nIn future cases the above decisions will probably be set aside in the\r\nlight of the present enactment.\r\n\r\nIn the case also of a quack doctor, who, under the pretext of\r\nperforming a surgical operation on a young girl of nineteen years of\r\nage, had connection with her, she at the time resisting, but believing\r\nthat she was undergoing an operation, it was held, on appeal, that he\r\nwas guilty of the crime of rape, and the former conviction confirmed\r\n(R. _v._ Hattery, C.C.).\r\n\r\nIn England, and in Ireland, and also in Scotland, unlawfully and\r\ncarnally knowing a girl under thirteen years of age constitutes\r\na felony--the attempt in the former countries constitutes a\r\nmisdemeanour; in Scotland, a “crime and offence.” The child may be a\r\nwitness if she understands the nature of an oath or understands the\r\nduty of speaking the truth, but her evidence must be corroborated\r\nby some other material evidence in support thereof, implicating the\r\naccused. The carnal knowledge of a girl above thirteen and under\r\nsixteen, or of any female idiot or imbecile woman or girl, under\r\ncircumstances which do not amount to rape, but which prove that the\r\noffender knew at the time of the commission of the offence that the\r\nwoman or girl was an idiot or imbecile, constitutes a misdemeanour.\r\nAbove sixteen consent does away with the crime; and it shall be a\r\nsufficient defence for the accused to show that he had reasonable cause\r\nto believe that the girl was of or above the age of sixteen years. This\r\ndefence does not apply to female idiots or imbeciles.\r\n\r\nA boy under the age of fourteen was formerly in England presumed by law\r\nincapable of committing a rape (R. _v._ Groombridge, 7 C. & P. 582);\r\nbut in Scotland there was no such provision, and a boy thirteen and a\r\nhalf years of age was committed for rape (Rob. Fulton, jun., Ayr, Sept.\r\n20, 1841).\r\n\r\nThe recent Act before quoted provides that, instead of imprisonment,\r\nthe offender, if _under_ sixteen, may be whipped and sent to a\r\nreformatory school for not less than two or more than five years.\r\nEvidently age cannot now be pleaded as an incapability.\r\n\r\nThe crime of rape appears to be most frequently perpetrated against\r\nchildren, probably due to the popular idea that an attack of gonorrhœa\r\nmay be cured by connection being had with a virgin or healthy female.\r\n\r\nThe following Table from Casper gives the result of his examination of\r\none hundred and thirty-six cases of rape:\r\n\r\n    From 2½(!) to 12 years old      99\r\n      “  12        “  14    “       20\r\n      “  15        “  18    “        8\r\n      “  19        “  25    “        7\r\n                      47    “        1\r\n                      68    “        1\r\n                                   ---\r\n                                   136\r\n\r\nIn examination of a case of alleged rape, several points of interest\r\nwill have to be considered, which, for the sake of convenience, will be\r\nplaced in a tabular form:\r\n\r\n    1. _An examination of the parts of generation._\r\n        (_a_) Inflammatory redness and abrasion of the parts.\r\n        (_b_) A muco-purulent secretion.\r\n        (_c_) Hæmorrhage or dried blood about the genital organs.\r\n        (_d_) Destruction of the hymen.\r\n        (_e_) Dilatation of the vagina.\r\n        (_f_) General signs of rape.\r\n\r\n    2. _An examination of the body and limbs of the female._\r\n\r\n    3. _Examination of the linen worn by the female and the male for_\r\n        (_a_) Marks of semen.\r\n        (_b_) Marks of blood.\r\n        (_c_) Marks of other discharges, gonorrhœa, &c.\r\n\r\n1. =An Examination of the Parts of Generation.=\r\n\r\n(_a_) More or less inflammatory _redness_ and _abrasion_ of the mucous\r\nmembrane lining the parts, which is never absent in children, and\r\nmay last for some weeks. “In adults, virgins up to the time of the\r\ncommission of the crime, this appearance is either not found at all or\r\nonly faint traces of it. In those previously deflowered it is never\r\nobserved.” In the case of young children the genitals may be so injured\r\nas to cause death in a few hours. The parts may therefore present all\r\nvarieties of injury, from slight bruising and redness to the most\r\nfearful lacerations.\r\n\r\n    _Caution._--Inflammatory irritation due to catarrh\r\n        _may_ occur, and be apt to mislead.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A _muco-purulent secretion_, from the mucous membrane lining the\r\nvagina, of a greenish-yellow colour, more or less viscid, and soiling\r\nthe linen of the girl. This secretion, in colour and consistence,\r\ncannot be distinguished from that the result of gonorrhœa. The usual\r\nperiod of incubation of gonorrhœa is from three to eight days; among\r\nyoung girls, however, this period may be shortened. The incubatory\r\nstage of soft chancre is from three to five days (Diday); that of\r\nhard chancre somewhat longer, varying from fifteen to twenty days.\r\nEnlargement of the inguinal glands and the persistence of the discharge\r\nafter the use of simple treatment will tend greatly to confirm the\r\nsuspicion of venereal disease. The genital organs of the male may have\r\nto be examined as to the presence of gonorrhœa or syphilis. Syringing\r\nthe urethra may remove for a time the gonorrhœal discharge; care must\r\ntherefore be taken in forming an opinion.\r\n\r\n    _Caution._--Unhealthy children, and those recovering\r\n        from some debilitating diseases--fever, &c.,--may suffer\r\n        from purulent discharges from the vagina. Small ulcers\r\n        may also be present, and may be mistaken for syphilitic\r\n        ulceration Infantile leucorrhœa is not uncommon.\r\n        (Percival‘s _Medical Ethics_.)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Hæmorrhage or Dried Blood about the Genital Organs._--(1)\r\nFrequently absent in young children. (2) Always found in adults,\r\nvirgins at the time the rape was committed, when the vessels of the\r\nhymen are ruptured.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Destruction of the Hymen._--Most frequently, and especially in\r\nyoung girls, one or more _lacerations_ of the hymen may be seen. These\r\nlacerations must be looked for within five or six days of the alleged\r\nrape, as they soon heal up, and then no certain opinion can be given\r\nas to the date of their infliction. They may also be produced by any\r\nforeign body to substantiate a charge of rape.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Dilatation of the Vagina._--This condition may be produced by\r\nthe passage of hard bodies in order to substantiate a false charge of\r\nrape. Casper once examined a girl, only ten years of age, whose mother\r\nhad gradually dilated her vagina with her fingers, in order to fit her\r\nfor sexual intercourse with men.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _General Signs of Rape._--To the above are added certain general\r\nsigns, as a _difficulty in walking_, attended with an involuntary\r\nseparation of the thighs, common to both children and adults; _pain is\r\nalso not infrequently present in passing water_, and when _the bowels\r\nare relieved_. In determining the truthfulness of the statements made\r\nas to an alleged rape, the character of the woman, and the obvious\r\ninconsistencies of her statements must be taken into consideration.\r\nMoreover, if, in addition to the injuries found on the external\r\ngenitals, spermatozoa be detected in the vagina, a presumption in\r\nfavour of the injuries being due to sexual intercourse will be clearly\r\nmade out, but the presence of spermatozoa in the vagina of a woman\r\nis no evidence of rape. Care, however, must be taken not to confound\r\nwith spermatozoa an animalcule--_Trichomonas vaginæ_--described by M.\r\nDonné as being sometimes found in the vaginal mucus. The head of the\r\nanimalcule is larger than that of a spermatozoon, and is surrounded by\r\na row of cilia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 19.--Hymen of child of four years--annular type. The illustration\r\nalso shows the prominence of the urinary portion of the genitals.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of young children, the anxiety on the part of the parents\r\nof the child to push the charge, and the story of the child and\r\nthat of the parent heard apart, may assist in guiding the opinion.\r\nThe lesson-like way in which the child tells her story, even to the\r\nminutest details, is always suspicious. The proof of a previous\r\ndefloration negatives the pretended loss of virginity at the time of\r\nthe commission of the deed for which the accused is being tried. In\r\nmost cases, it is best to let the patient tell her own tale, and then\r\ncross-examine. An injudicious question may put her on her guard.\r\n\r\n=2. Examination of the Limbs and Body of the Female for Bruises,\r\n&c.=--Little value is to be placed on injuries said to be inflicted\r\non the person of a female the result of a struggle, as these may be\r\nproduced by the woman on herself in order to substantiate her story. In\r\nchildren, for obvious reasons, they do not occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Virgin hymen, with central slit.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\n=3. Examination of the Linen.=--In all cases a careful examination\r\nof the body linen of both parties should be made. With regard to the\r\nposition of the stains on the chemise of the woman, M. Devergie insists\r\nthat the stains on the front of the chemise are seminal, those on the\r\nback are due to blood. This distinction is too arbitrary to meet all\r\nthe facts of these cases, for the position of the spots necessarily\r\ndepends on the respective positions of the parties at the moment of\r\nejaculation; and, moreover, the woman is more likely to wipe the parts\r\nwith the front than the back of her chemise. Mistakes may arise from--\r\n\r\n    1. The garments being intentionally soiled with blood. This is not\r\n    infrequently done in cases of false accusations.\r\n\r\n    2. The menstrual discharge may be readily mistaken for that due to\r\n    violence, as the two kinds of blood cannot be distinguished.\r\n\r\n    3. The red juice of fruits and grease spots have been mistaken for\r\n    marks of blood and seminal stains on linen.\r\n\r\nThe identification of blood-stains is not difficult when the stain\r\noccurs on pieces of white linen; but when, as it not infrequently\r\nhappens, they have to be detected on the coarse, dirty, often stinking\r\nlinen of the poor, the task becomes somewhat more difficult. The same\r\nmay be said with regard to seminal spots. As a means of diagnosis in\r\nstains due to semen, the appearance and smell of the stains are of no\r\nassistance whatever. The microscope will alone give any trustworthy\r\nevidence as to the nature of the stain; and even here a caution must be\r\nadded--for the fact is beyond doubt that the semen even of a healthy\r\nyoung man varies much, and is scarcely ever twice alike, so that the\r\nabsence of spermatozoa is no proof that the spot is not seminal in its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe following are the tests used for the detection of semen:\r\n\r\n    1. _Characteristic smell when the spot is\r\n    moistened._--This test is of no use, for the reasons\r\n    before stated.\r\n\r\n    2. _Appearance when held to the light._--As uncertain\r\n    as the preceding.\r\n\r\n    3. _Doubtful spots upon cotton or linen_--not upon\r\n    _wool_, which usually contains sulphur--should be\r\n    cut out and moistened with a few drops of oxide of lead,\r\n    dissolved in liquor potassæ, and then dried at a temperature\r\n    of 68° F. The stain in a few minutes becomes of a dirty\r\n    yellow or sulphur-yellow colour. This change in colour\r\n    proves that the mark _is not_ a seminal stain. Semen\r\n    does not contain albumen. This test only shows that the\r\n    stain is not caused by albuminous compounds, which contain\r\n    sulphur; but it does not follow therefore that the spot must\r\n    be seminal, for marks made by gum, dextrine, and some other\r\n    substances of a like nature are not changed in colour.\r\n\r\n    4. _The Microscope._--This is by far the most reliable\r\n    test, but care is required in its manipulation.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The cloth must not be rubbed between the fingers,\r\n    as the spermatozoa may be damaged by the operation.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The suspicious spot on the linen should be\r\n    carefully cut out and placed in a clean watch-glass or small\r\n    porcelain vessel, and then moistened with a small quantity\r\n    of distilled water. The cloth may be gently moved about in\r\n    the water with a glass rod, and gentle pressure made so as\r\n    to thoroughly wet the cloth, which, in most cases, will be\r\n    accomplished in about a quarter of an hour. A single drop\r\n    should now, by gentle pressure with the fingers, be squeezed\r\n    on to a clean slide, and then placed under the microscope.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Another method may be adopted. First determine\r\n    the side of the cloth on which the stain is present, and\r\n    cut out the stain, leaving a small strip of cloth attached\r\n    to the main portion. Place the end of the strip in a little\r\n    water in a watch-glass, so that the water by capillary\r\n    attraction may permeate the entire stain. With a thin-bladed\r\n    knife gently remove the moistened stain and place it on a\r\n    microscopic slide, and examine as before.\r\n\r\n    _Fixing and Staining._--A drop of the watery extract of\r\n    the stain may be placed on a microscope slide and allowed to\r\n    dry in the air, covered to protect it from dust, and then\r\n    fixed by heating the slide over a spirit or Bunsen flame or\r\n    by the use of absolute alcohol. When fixed, the preparation\r\n    can be stained with eosin and methylene blue, methylene\r\n    violet, or other nuclear dye. The film may also be fixed and\r\n    stained with Leishman‘s solution in one procedure, or fixed\r\n    by heat first and then stained with Leishman. The procedure\r\n    is the same as for blood, viz. to cover the film with a\r\n    few drops of Leishman‘s stain, let stand for two or three\r\n    minutes, then add a few drops of distilled water, in two\r\n    or three minutes wash in distilled water, dry with filter\r\n    paper, and examine with the oil immersion. The preparation\r\n    may be mounted in Canada balsam and preserved for further\r\n    reference. The head of the spermatazoon takes the nuclear\r\n    dyes in ordinary use. The spermatazoa are best found in\r\n    the centre of the stain. If the stain be small the watery\r\n    extract may be centrifuged.\r\n\r\n    _Florence‘s Reaction._--A useful chemical reaction has\r\n    been introduced by Dr. Florence of Lyons. It depends upon\r\n    the reaction between a concentrated solution of iodine in\r\n    potassium iodide and human semen. A watery extract of the\r\n    stain is made, and a drop placed on a microscope slide, by\r\n\r\n        Potassium iodide      1.65 grms.\r\n        Iodine                2.54  “\r\n        Distilled water       30   c.c.\r\n\r\n    The drops are covered with a cover glass and examined; where\r\n    the two drops unite, a precipitate is formed which consists\r\n    of brown crystals, very similar to hæmin crystals. If there\r\n    be sufficient material the precipitate may be obtained\r\n    in a test tube. This test is extremely delicate, and is\r\n    analogous in value to the guaiacum reaction for blood. A\r\n    positive reaction does not absolutely prove that the stain\r\n    is seminal, but a negative reaction proves that it is not.\r\n    Dr. Florence holds the reaction is specific for human semen,\r\n    as he has failed to obtain it with the seminal fluid of any\r\n    other animal, or other fluids or tissues. He considers it\r\n    due to the presence of an alkaloidal body in human semen,\r\n    which he calls virispermin.\r\n\r\n    The crystals are said by Dr. Max Richter to form on the\r\n    addition of the iodine solution to decomposition products of\r\n    lecithin.\r\n\r\n    The author has found this reaction extremely delicate, even\r\n    with minute traces. The crystals form rapidly and are easily\r\n    recognisable. They, however, are evanescent and disappear on\r\n    standing, so that they cannot be preserved as microscopic\r\n    specimens.\r\n\r\n    _The biological test._--This is carried out in the same\r\n    way as the biological test for blood. Dr. C. G. Farnum, who\r\n    proposed this test, uses semen or testicular emulsion for\r\n    antigen, injecting 5 to 10 c.c. into the peritoneal cavity\r\n    of a rabbit at intervals of from two to six days, on five\r\n    or eight occasions. The antiserum is diluted from twelve\r\n    to eighteen times with normal saline, and the semen four\r\n    to twenty-five times. Human antiserum gives a precipitin\r\n    reaction with the watery extract of human seminal stain, but\r\n    not with testicular emulsions of the bull, dog, or goat, or\r\n    with human blood serum.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] _Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc._, 1901, p. 1721.\r\n\r\n=Can a Rape be committed by one man on a healthy, vigorous woman?=--The\r\nanswer to the question will, to a great extent, depend on the relative\r\nstrength of the conflicting parties. Every case of rape has to be\r\njudged on its own merits. In any case, the medical jurist has simply\r\nto state, from the examination of the parties, that sexual intercourse\r\nhas taken place, leaving the jury to decide whether a rape or not has\r\nbeen perpetrated. A case is mentioned by Casper where a healthy, strong\r\nadult of twenty-five years old was violated by a single man.\r\n\r\n=Can a Woman be Violated during Sleep?=--By this is intended natural\r\nhealthy sleep, and not that induced by narcotics. In natural sleep,\r\nrape is scarcely possible in a virgin, especially if the hymen be found\r\nrecently ruptured, though it _may_ be possible in a woman accustomed to\r\nsexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Photo-micrograph of human spermatozoa, × 1000.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n=Can a Woman become Pregnant by an act of Rape?=--The answer to this\r\nquestion is most decidedly in the affirmative. It is not necessary for\r\na woman to experience any sexual pleasure during connection in order\r\nthat she may conceive. A woman may become pregnant if fresh semen be\r\ninjected into the vagina with a glass syringe.\r\n\r\n=Signs of Rape in the Dead.=--In the case of a woman found dead, the\r\nquestion may arise as to her having been violated prior to death.\r\nThe reply to the question is by no means easy. Severe injury to the\r\ngenitals is a presumption in favour of rape, but cases are by no means\r\nrare in which men failing to accomplish coïtus have injured the parts\r\nwith their fingers. The presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal mucus is\r\ngood evidence of a recent coïtus, but is no direct evidence of a rape.\r\nCollateral evidence will in most cases decide the point.\r\n\r\nPhysical Signs of Rape in Adult and in Child\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n                 In the Adult.        |            In the Child.\r\n    ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n     1.

Be careful to note everything, for it is in such cases as the one\r\nunder discussion where apparently unimportant signs may become of the\r\ngreatest moment.\r\n\r\n2. Give the female no time for preparation, but make your visit, and\r\nat once proceed to an examination. The visit to be of any practical\r\nservice should not be delayed beyond the third or fourth day after the\r\nalleged offence, “by which time the lacerations will have healed, the\r\ncicatrices disappeared, and the torn hymen be in such a state as to\r\nmake it difficult to say whether it had been divided recently or at\r\nan earlier period.” But remember that you _are not justified in using\r\nforce_; and in this, as in cases of suspected pregnancy, if you examine\r\na woman against her will you render yourself liable for an action for\r\nassault, and may have to pay heavily for your enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Note time of a visit.\r\n    (_b_) Note time of alleged offence. _Why?_ May\r\n          prove the accused party innocent by an _alibi_.\r\n    (_c_) Avoid leading questions.\r\n\r\n3. Age, strength, and condition of the health of the complainant.\r\nExamine the wounds asserted to have been inflicted, and see if they\r\ncorrespond with the history given of their infliction.\r\n\r\n4. Examine organs of generation.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Any recent signs of violence--blood, abrasions,\r\n          ulcerations, &c.\r\n    (_b_) Condition of hymen, and of the _carunculæ\r\n          myrtiformes_.\r\n    (_c_) Was the woman menstruating at the time? Signs\r\n          modified or obliterated by menstruation.\r\n\r\n5. Preserve any spots on linen, &c., for future examination.\r\n\r\n6. In case of death after violence--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Examine mouth for foreign bodies, &c.\r\n    (_b_) Fractures or bruises on the body.\r\n\r\n7. Examine spot where the crime is stated to have taken place.\r\n\r\n8. Examine person of the accused.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Muscular development and strength.\r\n    (_b_) Any abrasion about the penis, size of penis,\r\n          rupture of the frænum, &c.\r\n    (_c_) On linen, blood-stains, seminal spots, &c.\r\n    (_d_) Marks on his body, scratches, &c., as evidence\r\n          of resistance.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--The lapse of a few days may be sufficient to\r\n        remove all traces of the violence done to the parts; and\r\n        in most cases days, weeks, and even months may elapse\r\n        before an examination is made of the alleged victim.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINITY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Deflorated hymen, after parturition, in adult\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\nThere is no one sign which may be considered as an absolute test for\r\nvirginity. The presence or absence of the hymen is of no probative\r\nvalue one way or the other. Its very existence has been denied by Paré,\r\nBuffon, and others. It may be absent as the result of disease, or as\r\nthe result of a surgical operation to allow of the free discharge of\r\nthe menstrual flow. Its presence is no bar to conception; and cases\r\nare on record where it has been found necessary to incise it, to\r\nallow of the passage of the fœtus into the world. In fact, women who\r\nhave been prostitutes for years have possessed to the last uninjured\r\nhymens. The changes in the breasts which proceed from impregnation do\r\nnot occur where only defloration has taken place. The rugose condition\r\nof the vagina is only affected by the first birth, and not by sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the above signs as tests for virginity may be\r\nsaid of a host of others which from time to time have, with varying\r\nsuccess, been advanced as aids to the diagnosis. Casper, however,\r\nconsiders “that where a forensic physician FINDS A HYMEN STILL\r\nPRESERVED, EVEN ITS EDGES NOT BEING TORN, AND ALONG WITH IT--in young\r\npersons--A VIRGIN CONDITION OF THE BREASTS AND EXTERNAL GENITALS, HE\r\nIS THEN JUSTIFIED IN GIVING A POSITIVE OPINION AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF\r\nVIRGINITY, and _vice versa_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that a medical man is called upon to make\r\nan examination of a woman for legal purposes, in order to decide--(_a_)\r\nThe existence of an alleged pregnancy. (_b_) The possibility of a\r\nprevious pregnancy. (_c_) As to the existence of concealed pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the reasons why pregnancy may be feigned:\r\n\r\n    1. _By a married woman, to gratify the desire of her\r\n        husband for issue._\r\n\r\n    2. _To influence the jury in a case of breach of promise\r\n        of marriage as to the assessment of the damages._\r\n\r\n    3. _To extort money from a seducer or paramour._\r\n\r\n    4. _To produce a spurious heir to property._\r\n\r\n    5. _By a single or married woman, to stay the infliction\r\n        of capital punishment._\r\n\r\nPregnancy may be concealed--(_a_) In order to procure abortion. (_b_)\r\nIn order to commit infanticide. (_c_) In the married and the unmarried,\r\nto avoid disgrace.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, other important questions may arise with regard to\r\nthis state:\r\n\r\n1. _Is pregnancy possible as the result of coïtus in a state of\r\nunconsciousness?_--There appears no reason for doubting the possibility\r\nof this occurrence.\r\n\r\n2. _Can pregnancy occur before the appearance of the catamenia?_--That\r\npregnancy may occur before menstruation is undoubted; and it appears\r\nprobable that the changes in the ovaries and uterus may go on at\r\nthe regular monthly periods, and yet there may be no discharge of\r\nblood from the uterus, which, as pointed out by Bischoff, is only a\r\nsymptomatic though usual occurrence. Hence, pregnancy is possible prior\r\nto menstruation.\r\n\r\n3. _What is the earliest and latest age at which pregnancy is\r\npossible?_--In our climate (Britain), the earliest age at which\r\npregnancy may occur is about the eleventh or twelfth year; but the\r\nyoungest age at which this condition is reported to have occurred is\r\n_nine_ years (Meyer). In hot climates--as in Bengal--mothers under\r\ntwelve years of age are by no means rare. Cohabitation in marriage\r\ntakes place much earlier in India than in Europe, but Chevers doubts\r\nif menstruation naturally occurs much sooner there than elsewhere, and\r\nBaboo Modusoodun Gupta believes that the catamenia appear sooner or\r\nlater, according to the mode of living of the females, and the sexual\r\nexcitement to which they may be subjected. Thomas mentions the case of\r\na girl who menstruated regularly from the age of twenty-one months, and\r\nalso of another at eight months. The limit to child-bearing appears\r\nto be between the fiftieth and fifty-second years; but even here\r\nconsiderable variation has been recorded, and women have been delivered\r\nof children at the age of sixty. Haller even reports one at seventy. As\r\nlong as menstruation continues a woman may become pregnant; but even\r\nthe cessation of this flow for some months is no bar to conception.\r\n\r\n4. _Is it possible for a woman to become pregnant eight weeks after\r\nher last confinement?_--This is undoubtedly possible, but it is of rare\r\noccurrence. It is also probable that a woman may abort at the end of\r\nthe time above mentioned. Husband knew a woman, who for several years\r\nbore a child every ten months.\r\n\r\nAt _common law_, in cases of disputed inheritance, the following may\r\noccur, and give rise to the necessity for medical evidence on the\r\nsubject: A woman who has just lost her husband may disappoint the\r\nexpectant heirs to an estate by alleging that she is pregnant.\r\n\r\nAt _criminal law_, pregnancy may be used as a stay to the infliction of\r\ncapital punishment.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, a jury of matrons is impanelled by a writ _de ventre\r\ninspiciendo_, to decide the existence of pregnancy, and if the fact be\r\nproved, to watch till such time as she be delivered.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, in England, the pregnancy must be proved, and also\r\nwhether she be _quick with child_. In Scotland the pregnancy must be\r\nproved, but without reference to _quickening_, and the jury of matrons\r\nis unknown in that country. In the same country, if it can be shown\r\nthat a woman is pregnant, and that her life or that of the child is\r\nendangered by her imprisonment, she may be admitted to bail till after\r\ndelivery. A pregnant female also cannot be compelled to appear and give\r\nevidence, if on competent authority it be shown that her delivery will\r\nprobably take place at the time fixed for the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigns of Pregnancy\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of early pregnancy in ordinary cases is by no means easy,\r\nespecially before the third or fourth month of gestation; but to the\r\nmedical jurist it is still more difficult, as he has to deal with cases\r\nwhere he can scarcely expect much candour. No opinion should, however,\r\nbe given without taking into consideration the collective value of the\r\nsigns, as no one sign will afford sufficient data on which to base an\r\nopinion. The signs furnished by auscultation are the most reliable, but\r\nthe position of the fœtus may render the sounds of the fœtal heart and\r\nplacental souffle difficult to detect.\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as among the most important signs of\r\npregnancy, given in the usual order of their occurrence:\r\n\r\n          Uncertain or Accessory Signs\r\n    1. Cessation of menstruation       First month.\r\n    2. Morning sickness                Second month.\r\n    3. Salivation                      Variable.\r\n    4. Mammary sympathies              Third month.\r\n    5. Enlargement of the abdomen      Fourth month.\r\n    6. Quickening                      Fourth month.\r\n    7. Kiesteine                       Variable.\r\n    8. Jacquemier‘s Test               Third month.\r\n\r\n         Certain or Essential Signs\r\n    1. Ballottement                    Fourth month.\r\n    2. Uterine souffle                 Second month.\r\n    3. Pulsation of the fœtal heart    Fourth month.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncertain Signs\r\n\r\n1. _Cessation of Menstruation._--The non-appearance of the catamenia,\r\nthough a most valuable sign, is by no means a conclusive one, as\r\nmenstruation may be arrested by diseases of various kinds; while, on\r\nthe other hand, there are many well-recorded cases of women who have\r\nmenstruated regularly during the whole period of their pregnancy.\r\nThere have been also cases in which the menses only occurred during\r\npregnancy; and in a few still more curious cases, women who have never\r\nmenstruated have been known to have borne several children. In cases\r\nof concealed pregnancy, the woman may smear her linen with blood to\r\nimitate the menstrual flow.\r\n\r\n2. _Morning Sickness._--Nausea, often ending in vomiting, generally\r\noccurs soon after rising in the morning, and may commence almost\r\nimmediately, but more frequently not till the expiration of the fifth\r\nor sixth week after conception. It is not a reliable sign, and is often\r\nvery irregular in its occurrence. When present, it varies in degree,\r\nfrom a feeling of nausea to the most violent vomiting, very distressing\r\nto the patient.\r\n\r\n3. _Salivation._--The excessive secretion of the salivary glands,\r\ndue to the irritation caused by pregnancy, was first mentioned by\r\nHippocrates as a sign of this condition. “It is to be distinguished\r\nfrom ptyalism induced by mercury, by the absence of sponginess and\r\nsoreness of the gums, and of the peculiar fœtor, and by the presence of\r\npregnancy.” It is oftener absent than present.\r\n\r\n4. _Mammary Sympathies._--As the breasts may enlarge from various\r\ncauses--such, for instance, as the distension of the uterus from\r\nhydatids, or, as is the case with some women at each menstrual period,\r\nwhen the catamenia are suspended, or after they have ceased--this is\r\nby no means a sign on which much reliance should be placed. The change\r\nin the colour of the nipple and areola, more apparent in women of dark\r\ncomplexions, is more to be relied on as a diagnostic sign of pregnancy.\r\nThe first observable alteration, which occurs about two months after\r\nconception, is “a soft and moist state of the integument, which appears\r\nraised, and in a state of turgescence, giving one the idea that, if\r\ntouched by the point of the finger, it would be found emphysematous.\r\nThis state appears, however, to be caused by infiltration of the\r\nsubjacent cellular tissue, which, together with its altered colour,\r\ngives us the idea of a part in which there is going forward a greater\r\ndegree of vital action than is in operation around it; and we not\r\ninfrequently find that the little glandular follicles, or tubercles as\r\nthey are called by Morgagni, are bedewed with a secretion sufficient to\r\ndamp and colour the woman‘s dress.”\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the next two months, the changes in the areola\r\nare in general perfected, or nearly so, and then it presents the\r\nfollowing characteristics: “A circle round the nipple, whose colour\r\nvaries in intensity according to the particular complexion of the\r\nindividual, being usually much darker in persons with black hair, dark\r\neyes, and sallow skin, than in those of fair hair, light-coloured\r\neyes, and delicate complexion. The extent of the circle varies in\r\ndiameter from an inch to an inch and a half, and increases in most\r\npersons as pregnancy advances, as does also the depth of colour. In\r\nthe centre of the coloured circle, the nipple is observed partaking of\r\nthe altered colour of the part, and appearing turgid and prominent,\r\nwhile the surface of the areola, especially that part which lies\r\nmore immediately around the base of the nipple, is studded over and\r\nrendered unequal by the prominence of the glandicular follicles, which,\r\nvarying in number from twelve to twenty, project from the sixteenth to\r\nthe eighth of an inch; and, lastly, the integument covering the part\r\nappears turgescent, softer, and more moist than that which surrounds\r\nit; while on both there are to be observed at this period, especially\r\nin women with dark hair and eyes, numerous round spots or small\r\nmottled patches of a whitish colour, scattered over the outer part of\r\nthe areola, and for about an inch or more all around, presenting an\r\nappearance as if the colour had been discharged by a shower of drops\r\nfalling on the part.” The value of the above changes in the nipple\r\nand areola as a diagnostic sign of pregnancy is greatly lessened by a\r\nprevious pregnancy. It should also be remembered that milk may occur in\r\nthe breasts of women who are not pregnant.\r\n\r\n5. _Enlargement of the Abdomen._--For the first four months of\r\npregnancy the entire uterus is contained in the cavity of the pelvis;\r\nit then gradually rises, so that at about the fifth month it is midway\r\nbetween the pubes and umbilicus, which latter it reaches at the end\r\nof the sixth month; during the seventh month it may be felt half-way\r\nbetween the umbilicus and ensiform cartilage; at the end of the\r\neighth month it is level with the cartilage, now quite filling the\r\nabdomen. Still increasing in size during the ninth month it does not\r\nascend higher, the abdominal walls yielding to its increased weight,\r\nallowing it to fall somewhat forward. A caution is necessary with\r\nregard to this sign. The abdomen may enlarge from causes other than\r\npregnancy. Pregnancy and ascites, or ovarian dropsy, may coexist in\r\nthe same patient, and the diagnosis be rendered anything but easy. The\r\nenlargement of the abdomen may lead to unfounded suspicions detrimental\r\nto the happiness and health of the unfortunate object of them.\r\n\r\n6. _Condition of the Cervix Uteri._--The cervix softens during\r\npregnancy, and the softening is present as early as the second or third\r\nweek. It is an important sign. Hejar‘s sign or the softening at the\r\njunction of cervix and body and the lower uterine segment is valuable,\r\nbut not always easily elicited. It is of most value from the second\r\nto the fifth months. At the sixth month it loses one-fourth of its\r\nlength; at the seventh it is only half of its original length; at the\r\neighth it loses another quarter; and at the ninth the neck is entirely\r\nobliterated. This shortening is more apparent than real, and its\r\noccurrence is denied by the late Dr. J. M. Duncan, except during the\r\nlast few days of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n7. _Quickening._--The period at which quickening occurs varies from\r\nthe fourth to the fifth month; and the term is understood to imply the\r\nfirst perception of the movements of the fœtus experienced by the\r\nmother. Nervous women, anxious to have children, sometimes complain of\r\nsensations which they ascribe to quickening, pregnancy being absent.\r\nPregnancy may occur without quickening.\r\n\r\n8. _Kiesteine._--This is no test of pregnancy, as it may be found in\r\nwomen not pregnant.\r\n\r\n9. _Jacquemier‘s Test._--A violet or port-wine colour of the vagina and\r\ninner surface of the vulva, due to venous congestion of the parts from\r\npressure of the gravid uterus.\r\n\r\nA flattening of the upper wall of the vagina, produced by the\r\nenlargement and anteversion of the uterus, which, forcing the os\r\ntowards the sacrum, makes the anterior wall of the vagina tense, has\r\nbeen added by Dr. Barnes as a sign of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain Signs\r\n\r\n1. _Ballottement._--This test of pregnancy is applied by causing the\r\npatient to stand upright; the finger of the right hand is then passed\r\ninto the vagina and placed in the anterior fornix, the other hand\r\nbeing placed lightly over the abdomen in order to steady the uterine\r\ntumour. If the finger be now jerked upwards against the head of the\r\nchild, it will be felt to float upwards in the liquor amnii, and then\r\nby its own weight gradually to return to its former position. Tumours\r\nin the uterus, attached to its walls by a pedicle, may give the same\r\nsensation. Scanty supply of liquor amnii, or malposition of the child,\r\nmay sometimes prevent the adoption of the test.\r\n\r\n2. _Uterine Souffle._--Under this head are included the placental\r\nbruit, and the pulsations of the umbilical cord. Both these sounds\r\nrequire a skilled auscultator to detect them. The uterine murmur, or\r\n_bruit placentaire_, is heard best at the lower and lateral portions\r\nof the uterus, just above Poupart‘s ligament. It is isochronous with\r\nthe pulse of the mother, and is heard most distinctly about the fourth\r\nor fifth month of utero-gestation; in some cases, however, it may be\r\nheard as early as the tenth week. The sound is intermittent, and varies\r\nin character, being sometimes hissing, whirring, or cooing, at others\r\nrasping.\r\n\r\n3. _Pulsation of the Fœtal Heart._--The sounds of the fœtal heart\r\nwere first noticed by Mayar in 1818, and those of the placenta,\r\nor _placental souffle_, by Kergaradec in 1822. The sound of the\r\nfœtal heart is composed of a rapid succession of short, regular\r\ndouble pulsations, differing from that of the adult heart in rhythm\r\nand frequency. It can be heard more or less over the whole of the\r\nabdomen about the middle of the fourth month, and is not unlike the\r\nmuffled ticking of a watch. In frequency it varies from 100 to 140.\r\nThe auscultator should be careful not to hang his head down, or he\r\nmay be apt to mistake the throbbing of his own arteries for sounds\r\ncommunicated from the patient.\r\n\r\n4. _Intermittent Contraction of the Uterus._--From the fourth to the\r\ntenth month of pregnancy, the uterus may be felt by the palpating\r\nhand to alternately contract and relax; the period of contraction and\r\nrelaxation varies. It is present in pregnancy whether the fœtus be\r\nalive or dead.\r\n\r\nPregnancy may be simulated by ascites, by fibrous tumours of the\r\nuterus, by ovarian dropsy, and by enlargement of the uterus from\r\nretention of the catamenia due to an imperforate hymen, &c. The breasts\r\nmay also become affected by uterine tumours.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis of Pregnancy\r\n\r\n1. _Pseudo-Pregnancy._--In the examination of cases of alleged\r\npregnancy, the medical jurist should bear in mind the possibility of\r\nenlargement of the uterus and abdomen from the presence of tumours. The\r\nprobable occurrence of _pseudo-pregnancy_ should also be considered.\r\nTumours and pseudo-pregnancy may occur in the married and unmarried;\r\nand as the latter is not infrequently accompanied with many of the\r\nsigns and symptoms of pregnancy, an early diagnosis is of the utmost\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis will consist in--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) A careful examination of all the symptoms\r\n          present, when, in most cases, a break in their order of\r\n          sequence may be observed, or certain signs may be added\r\n          which do not occur in true pregnancy.\r\n    (_b_) Presence or absence of the hymen.\r\n    (_c_) If the patient be placed well under the\r\n          influence of chloroform, the tumour, if the result of\r\n          pseudo-pregnancy, will subside, gradually returning\r\n          as the effects of the anæsthetic pass off. Whilst the\r\n          patient is under the influence of the anæsthetic, the\r\n          hand may be pressed on the abdomen at each expiration,\r\n          and there retained, the pressure being continued during\r\n          the inspirations.\r\n\r\n2. _Dropsy._--Use of the stethoscope; examination of the breasts for\r\nmilk, and the urine for albumen.\r\n\r\n3. _Fibrous Tumours._--Absence of fœtal movements and other signs of\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\n4. _Ovarian Dropsy._--Tumour on one side of the abdomen; breasts\r\nunaffected, and auscultation giving negative results.\r\n\r\n5. _Retention of the Catamenia._--On examination, the hymen found\r\nperfect and bulging. This condition cured by a crucial incision.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY\r\n\r\nThis subject is best discussed under three heads: (1) Signs of Recent\r\nDelivery in the Living. (2) Signs of Recent Delivery in the Dead. (3)\r\nSigns of Previous Delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Signs of Recent Delivery in the Living\r\n\r\n(_a_) Transitory Signs; (_b_) Persistent Signs of Delivery\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Transitory Signs of Delivery\r\n\r\n1. _General Indisposition._--The face is pale or flushed; the eyes\r\nsunken, and surrounded by a dark areola; there is considerable\r\ndebility, and a tendency to faint; the skin is warm and moist, and the\r\npulse quick. It must be borne in mind that a woman who is anxious to\r\nconceal her recent delivery may, by an effort of the will, to a great\r\nextent hide her real condition.\r\n\r\n2. _The Breasts._--The breasts feel firm and “knotty,” and on\r\npressure yield a small quantity of _colostrum_ or milk, which may be\r\ndistinguished by the aid of a microscope.\r\n\r\n3. _The Abdomen._--The skin of the abdomen shows signs of recent\r\ndistension; it is relaxed, and more or less thrown into folds, the\r\nlower part marked by irregular broken streaks of a pinkish tint,\r\nbecoming white and silvery as time goes on.\r\n\r\n4. _The Lochia, or the “Cleansings.”_--These consist in a discharge\r\nfrom the uterus, which, for the first three or four days after\r\ndelivery, is more or less bloody. During the succeeding four or five\r\ndays it acquires a dirty-greenish colour--“green waters,” with a\r\npeculiar sour, rancid odour. In a few days this is succeeded by a\r\nyellowish, milky-looking mucous discharge, which may continue for four\r\nor five weeks.\r\n\r\n5. _External Parts of Generation._--The labia and vagina bear distinct\r\nmarks of injury and distension.\r\n\r\n6. _The Uterus._--The uterus is enlarged, and may be felt by the hand\r\nfor two or three days after delivery, as a round ball, just above\r\nthe pubes. The orifice of the uterus, if examined a few hours after\r\ndelivery, appears as a continuation of the vagina. This condition\r\ncompletely disappears in about a week after delivery.\r\n\r\n7. _After-pains._--These are of no use from a diagnostic point of view,\r\nas we have no means of testing their presence or absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Persistent Signs of Delivery\r\n\r\n1. _Entire obliteration of the hymen._--This is no proof of actual\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n2. _Destruction of the fourchette._\r\n\r\n3. _The vagina dilated, and free from rugæ._\r\n\r\n4. _Dark colour of the areola round the nipples._--This varies among\r\nwomen; and cases are known where there was no areola either during\r\npregnancy or after delivery.\r\n\r\n5. _Skin of Abdomen._--Due to the great distension of the abdomen, the\r\nskin appears streaked with silvery lines varying in breadth. These\r\nmarkings in some cases may be scarcely perceptible, especially if the\r\nfemale has worn a tight abdominal belt during her pregnancy. The same\r\nappearance may be produced by dropsy, or the prolonged distension of\r\nthe abdominal walls, the result of other causes. Attention to the other\r\nsigns present will assist the diagnosis. After the lapse of seven to\r\nten days the recent delivery of a woman cannot be certainly proved by\r\nan examination of the living woman, especially if it be known that she\r\nhad previously borne children. In primiparæ the pink-coloured streaks\r\non the abdomen, and the transverse condition of the os uteri, may\r\nstrongly point to recent delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Signs of Recent Delivery in the Dead\r\n\r\nShould the woman die immediately after delivery, the external parts\r\nwill present the same appearance as just described in the living. On\r\nopening the abdomen, the uterus will be found fat and flabby, between\r\nnine and twelve inches long, and with the os uteri wide open. The\r\ncavity of the uterus may contain large bloody coagula, and its inner\r\nsurface be lined by the decidua. The attachment of the placenta is\r\neasily detected by its dark colour, and by the semi-lunar openings of\r\nthe arteries and veins on the surface of the uterus.\r\n\r\nOf course all the appearances just described will be greatly modified\r\nby the time that has elapsed between delivery and death.\r\n\r\n_Delivery after Death._--The fœtus has been known to have been expelled\r\nfrom the uterus by the force of the gases generated by putrefaction.\r\nDr. Aveling, in a paper published in the _Obstetric Transactions_,\r\n1873, arrives at the conclusion that _post-mortem_ delivery is possible\r\neven where no symptoms of parturition were noticed before death. He\r\nalso thinks that the child may live _in utero_ for some hours after the\r\ndeath of the mother.\r\n\r\n    Table showing the Size of the Uterus at Different\r\n                      Periods after Delivery\r\n    _Two to Three Days._--7 inches long and 4 inches wide.\r\n\r\n    _Seven Days._--Between 5 and 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.\r\n\r\n    _Fourteen Days._--From 4 to 5 inches long and 1½ inches wide.\r\n\r\n    _End of Second Month._--Normal size. 2½ inches long and about\r\n       2 inches broad at the fundus.\r\n\r\n     Table giving Weight of the Uterus after Delivery\r\n       Immediately after Delivery      22 to 24 ounces.\r\n       Within a Week                   18 to 21   “\r\n       End of Second Week              10 to 11   “\r\n       End of Third Week                5 to  7   “\r\n       End of Second Month     normal,  9 to 10 drachms.\r\n                                                     (Heschl.)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Signs of a Previous Delivery\r\n\r\n1. _Marks on the abdomen_, consisting in shining silvery lines, due to\r\nthe distension of the skin. These may result from distension other than\r\nthat the result of pregnancy--tumours, dropsy, &c.\r\n\r\n2. _Marks on the breasts_, similar to those appearing on the abdomen.\r\nThese, in conjunction with the above, are important.\r\n\r\n3. _Peculiar jagged condition of the os uteri_, felt by the finger. The\r\ncondition may be the result of disease.\r\n\r\n4. _Marks of rupture of the fourchette or perinæum._\r\n\r\n5. _Dark colour of the areola round the nipple._\r\n\r\n6. _Negative evidence_, from absence of any of the above.\r\n\r\n=Can a Woman be delivered unconsciously?=--This question may arise in\r\ncases of infanticide. Setting aside cases of epilepsy (in a fit of\r\nwhich disease Husband once attended a woman who was confined during\r\nthe fit without being aware that she had been delivered), cases of\r\napoplexy, coma, and narcosis from chloroform, opium, &c., it may be\r\nstated that delivery is possible during profound sleep. Husband once\r\nattended a woman who informed him that “she always had her pains during\r\nher sleep,” and only woke up just as the head came into the world. When\r\nit is borne in mind how easily some women pass through labour, it is\r\nquite possible that, after a busy day, sleep may be so profound as not\r\nto be disturbed by the pains of labour. In primiparæ the occurrence\r\nis more problematical. Women have often declared that they have been\r\nunconsciously delivered whilst at stool. This is also possible, but the\r\ncircumstances of the case must be severely sifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFŒTICIDE, OR CRIMINAL ABORTION\r\n\r\n        [“_Every woman, being with child, who, with\r\n    intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully\r\n    administer to herself any poison or other noxious\r\n    thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument, or other\r\n    means whatsoever, with the like intent: and whosoever,\r\n    with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman,\r\n    whether she be or be not with child, shall unlawfully\r\n    administer to her, or cause to be taken by her, any\r\n    poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully\r\n    use any instrument, or other means whatsoever, with\r\n    the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and being\r\n    convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion\r\n    of the Court, to be kept in penal servitude for life,\r\n    or for any term not less than five years, or to be\r\n    imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with\r\n    or without hard labour, and with or without solitary\r\n    confinement._”--Statute 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100,\r\n    sec. 58.]\r\n\r\nThe 59th section of the same Statute also takes into consideration\r\nthe unlawfully supplying or procuring any poison, or other noxious\r\nthing, or instrument, or thing whatsoever for a woman, for the purpose\r\nof inducing abortion. The person so doing shall be guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanour, and be kept in penal servitude for a term of five years,\r\nor be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without\r\nhard labour.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the passages above quoted that there is no\r\ndistinction between a woman _quick_ or not _quick_ with child. “The\r\noffence is to procure the miscarriage of _any woman, whether she be or\r\nbe not with child_” (R. _v._ Goodhall, 1 Din. 187; 2 C. & K. 293). But\r\nalthough the law does not regard “quickening” in cases of abortion, yet\r\nthe fact of having “quickened” may be pleaded as a bar to immediate\r\ncapital punishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Abortion at fourth week.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\nIt has been decided in Scotland that drugging or operating to procure\r\nabortion is criminal, though unsuccessful, but it is not certain\r\nwhether the woman alone can be charged with taking drugs to procure\r\nabortion. Both in England and in Scotland, to make the procuring of\r\nabortion criminal, “there must be felonious intent,” for it may be\r\nnecessary to cause abortion. It must be borne in mind that the law\r\nallows no discretionary power on the part of medical practitioners\r\nwho, to save the life of the mother, may deem it advisable to induce\r\npremature delivery. This being the case, no medical man should attempt\r\nto induce premature labour without the consent of the relatives of the\r\nwoman, and the sanction of a medical colleague after consultation.\r\nThis precaution is the more necessary as several medical men have\r\nbeen prosecuted, an event which would not have taken place had the\r\nprecaution above suggested been observed. A medical man should also\r\nbe very careful never to give any medicine “to bring on the courses”\r\nif he has the slightest suspicion of pregnancy, even as a “placebo”\r\nto satisfy an importunate patient, for should abortion be otherwise\r\nprocured, his really harmless medicine may be accused with the result,\r\nand a grave suspicion be raised against him, to say the least.\r\n\r\nThe term _abortion_ is understood in _medicine_ to mean the expulsion\r\nof the contents of the fœcundated uterus before the sixth month of\r\npregnancy, that is, before the child is considered viable. After this\r\nperiod it is said to be a premature labour.\r\n\r\n_In law_, however, no distinction is made and the expulsion of\r\nthe contents of the uterus at _any_ period before the full time\r\nof pregnancy is considered an _abortion_; in popular language, a\r\n_miscarriage_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Abortion between sixth and eighth week.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Abortion at tenth week.\r\n\r\n(Glaister.)]\r\n\r\nAbortion, when not produced by criminal means, generally occurs at\r\nor a little before the _third month_ of utero-gestation, and then\r\nusually in first pregnancies, or during the latter part of the period\r\nof child-bearing. It is also more frequent among the rich than among\r\nthe poor. Of the two thousand cases of pregnant women examined by Dr.\r\nWhitehead of Manchester, the sum of whose pregnancies was 8681, or 4.38\r\nfor each, rather less than 1 in 7 had aborted.\r\n\r\nWhen abortion is criminally induced, it generally takes place between\r\nthe _fourth and fifth months_, that is, about the time the woman\r\nbecomes certain of her condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Causes of Abortion are--\r\n\r\n    1. Natural or Accidental.--(_a_) Maternal--belonging to the\r\n       mother; (_b_) Fœtal--belonging to the ovum.\r\n\r\n    2. Violent.--(_a_) Mechanical; (_b_) Medicinal.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Natural or Accidental\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Maternal.=--Among the maternal causes may be mentioned excessive\r\nlactation; any irritation of the rectum or bladder; loss of blood,\r\nwhich, by increasing the amount of carbonic acid in the blood,\r\nacts as an excitant to the spinal cord; excessive irritability and\r\nexcitability of the uterus, &c. Certain states of the system conduce\r\nto abortion--albuminuria, syphilis, certain fevers, scarlet fever,\r\nsmallpox, &c. Abortion may become habitual in some women. Great joy or\r\nsudden sorrow have not infrequently been the cause of abortion. The\r\ntendency to abortion is greatest at the menstrual periods, that is, at\r\nthe time when, had not the woman become pregnant, menstruation would\r\nhave taken place. Slight causes acting at these times are very liable\r\nto produce abortion.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Fœtal.=--The death of the ovum, or a diseased condition of its\r\nuterine coverings, or of the placenta, probably of an inflammatory\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Violent\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Mechanical.=--Under this head may be mentioned the passage of\r\ncertain instruments into the cavity of the womb, and the rupture by\r\nviolence of the membranes which surround the fœtus; also the injection\r\nof fluids into the uterus. A medical man practising in Yorkshire\r\ninformed Husband that so great was the dread of large families, that\r\nhe knew of several ladies who, if they went a day over their monthly\r\nperiod, passed a catheter into the uterus, with the desired result.\r\n“It was wonderful,” he added, “how clever they were.” In India a twig\r\nof the _Euphorbium nivulia_, anointed with assafœtida, is used for the\r\nsame purpose. “The fœtus is never delivered alive, but there is said\r\nto be no great danger to the woman” (Chevers). Women may use hairpins,\r\nknitting-needles, and the idea is to pass the instrument “until blood\r\ncomes,” which is accepted as a sign that abortion will be sure to\r\nfollow. In some cases it is by no means easy to procure abortion, and\r\nwomen have been known to undergo a considerable amount of violence\r\nwithout abortion taking place. In some women, however, on the other\r\nhand, the slightest violence--such, for instance, as slipping from a\r\nstep or low chair--will cause them to abort.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Medicinal.=--Certain drugs, among which may be mentioned ergot,\r\nsavin, pennyroyal, rue, tansy, saffron, perchloride of iron, diachylon\r\nwhich contains lead, and others, have been used for the induction\r\nof abortion. In India unripe pineapple has a great reputation as an\r\nabortive (_Medical Jurisprudence for India_, Chevers). It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to mention each drug individually, but it must be remembered\r\nthat there is _not one single internal medicament_ of which it can be\r\nconsistently with experience asserted that, even when an abortion has\r\nfollowed its use, it must have produced this abortion, and that cause\r\nand effect are in such a case “indirect and necessary connection.” All\r\nthe so-called abortives are most uncertain in their action, and their\r\nuse is attended with considerable risk to the woman. In the case of\r\ndiachylon profound lead poisoning may be the result. Be this as it\r\nmay, they are more frequently used to induce abortion than mechanical\r\nprocedure, from the fact that the latter requires some amount of\r\nanatomical knowledge and manipulative skill.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of abortion from any cause are hæmorrhage, sepsis, and\r\nperitonitis. In mechanical interference, especially where proper\r\nprecautions have not been taken to prevent them, sepsis and peritonitis\r\nfrom local injury and perforation are prone to occur.\r\n\r\nA medical man may be required to--(1) Examine into the nature and\r\ncharacters of the substances expelled from the womb; (2) Examine the\r\nwoman stated to have aborted.\r\n\r\n1. =Examination of the Substances expelled from the Womb.=--The\r\nsubstances expelled from the womb often become the subject of judicial\r\ninquiry, and the medical man may be required to give his opinion as to\r\ntheir probable nature.\r\n\r\nDr. Gallard has called attention to the following:\r\n\r\n1. During the last six months of pregnancy, abortion, even when it\r\noccurs spontaneously, goes through the two stages as at full time,\r\n_i.e._ the expulsion of the products of conception is, as a rule,\r\npreceded by rupture of the membranes, followed after a time by the\r\nexpulsion of the placenta.\r\n\r\n2. In the first three months this order of things is absent, for it is\r\nthe rule to see the fœtus expelled entire _en bloc_ without rupture of\r\nthe membranes.\r\n\r\n3. If, then, we find during the first three months of pregnancy the\r\nproducts of an abortion in which the membranes have been ruptured and\r\nthe embryo expelled alone, we must look for a pathological cause for\r\nthis infraction of a general rule; and if no disease of the embryo or\r\nof the mother is found, we are justified in attributing the abortion\r\nto mechanical means used directly against the products of conception.\r\nCharpentier has shown that this rupture of the membranes is not\r\nan absolute proof of criminal abortion; but in eighteen cases of\r\nspontaneous abortion M. Leblond only found rupture of the membranes in\r\none, and in this the membranes presented an abnormal friability.\r\n\r\nThe questions may be asked--(1) Is it a fœtus?--(2) Is it a mole? If\r\nso, is a mole also a fœtus?--(3) Is it merely the coats of the uterus,\r\nand unconnected with pregnancy?\r\n\r\n1. _Is it a Fœtus?_--The development of the fœtus is given on pp. 35,\r\n36 _et seq._\r\n\r\n2. _Is it a Mole?_--This question gives rise to another: Is a mole a\r\nfœtus? To this the answer must be in the affirmative. Moles, being the\r\ndiseased appendages of the fœtus, vary in character, and have been\r\ndescribed by obstetrical writers under the following heads: (_a_)\r\nHydatiginous; (_b_) Carneous; (_c_) Fatty Moles.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) _Hydatiginous Moles_ are a result of a\r\n          diseased condition of the villi of the chorion. The\r\n          villi become dropsical, and hang in masses like a bunch\r\n          of grapes.\r\n    (_b_) _Carneous Moles._--These are the result\r\n          of hæmorrhage into the chorion. The blood becomes\r\n          organised, and a fleshy mass is formed, to which in some\r\n          cases a withered fœtus is attached.\r\n    (_c_) _Fatty Moles._--Death of the fœtus and fatty\r\n          degeneration of the placenta, or fatty degeneration\r\n          of the placenta and death of the fœtus, produces this\r\n          variety of mole. A withered fœtus with a mass of fatty\r\n          placenta are expelled.\r\n\r\n3. _Is it merely the Coats of the Uterus, and unconnected with\r\nPregnancy?_--Fleshy masses may be expelled from the womb, which may\r\nnot be the result of sexual intercourse. The description just given of\r\ntrue moles will, it is hoped, assist in forming a correct diagnosis.\r\nConsiderable care will be required, for the honour of the woman accused\r\ndepends upon the opinion given as to the nature of the substances\r\nsubmitted for examination. It must also not be forgotten that moles may\r\nbe retained for many months in the uterus and be then expelled. The\r\nknowledge of this fact may rebut an accusation of infidelity against\r\na wife. Polypi may be discharged from the womb; the presence of a\r\npedicle will point to their true character. All substances expelled\r\nfrom the uterus should be carefully washed in water, and all clots\r\nremoved. The examination of the woman may also help in the formation\r\nof the diagnosis. The absence of the signs of defloration or of recent\r\ndelivery will be in her favour.\r\n\r\n2. =Examination of a Woman stated to have aborted.=--This subject may\r\nbe divided under two heads--(1) Has the woman been recently delivered?\r\n(2) What were the means used to procure the abortion?\r\n\r\nIt is by no means easy to answer the question whether an alleged\r\nabortion has really taken place or not. The signs of recent delivery\r\nare in most cases absent, for the woman can better hide her condition\r\nduring the earlier than during the later months of utero-gestation;\r\nconsequently suspicion may not have been aroused against her for some\r\nweeks or months after the event. The history of the case, with other\r\nattendant circumstances--milk in the breasts, change in the colour of\r\nthe areola round the nipples, severe flooding, absence of the hymen,\r\ninjuries to the os uteri, transverse condition of the os uteri in\r\ncontradistinction to its circular form after delivery, &c.--will, in\r\nmost cases, assist in forming a correct diagnosis; but it must be again\r\nrepeated that few of the signs applicable to delivery at the full time\r\nare here available.\r\n\r\nIn all doubtful cases--\r\n\r\n    1. Examine into the general and present state of the\r\n       health of the woman.\r\n\r\n    2. Find out if there are any reasons which would\r\n       occasion a pretext to use drugs which are not usually\r\n       given to women during pregnancy.\r\n\r\n    3. Learn if menstruation is regular and easy, or if\r\n       the woman is in the habitual use of emmenagogues, for,\r\n       if so accustomed, she may have used them ignorant of\r\n       pregnancy.\r\n\r\n    4. If a woman ascribes her abortion to a fall, to an\r\n       accident, or to violence used against her, carefully\r\n       examine into the nature of these.\r\n\r\n    5. Examine into the general causes of abortion, and\r\n       also inspect the expelled substances.\r\n\r\nWhere death is supposed to have followed the use of abortives, the\r\nalimentary canal must be examined for the signs of the action of\r\nirritants, or the presence of disease in the internal organs; but when\r\ndeath has resulted from an attempt to procure abortion by instrumental\r\nmeans, the neck of the womb is most frequently found covered by a\r\nnumber of small more or less irregular wounds, which may penetrate into\r\nthe womb or lose themselves in the walls of the organ. Their course\r\nis indicated by infiltration, or a small extravasation of coagulated\r\nblood, the exact condition of which must, if possible, be ascertained,\r\nso as to decide when the wound was inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must not forget that the wounds may extend to the fundus\r\nof the uterus, and in this case the autopsy shows that a blunt\r\ninstrument, as a catheter or uterine sound, introduced through the\r\nos uteri into the retroverted uterus, glides by its own weight into\r\nthe rent. The seat of the tear leads one to think that pregnancy was\r\nnot far advanced when the attempt was made, and in fact the accident\r\nmost frequently occurs in cases of suspected pregnancy. It must be\r\nremembered that the uterus is often punctured by the injudicious use\r\nof the uterine sound, but without any immediate dangerous symptoms.\r\nWounds in the walls of the vagina indicate the use of instruments by\r\nan inexperienced hand; in the fundus of the uterus, to one at least\r\naccustomed to the introduction of instruments. Spontaneous rupture of\r\nthe uterus is impossible during the early periods of pregnancy, just\r\nwhen the attempts at abortion are usually made. Rupture due to external\r\nviolence is, as a rule, accompanied with outward signs of the violence\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIn all cases a careful examination of the structure of the uterus\r\nshould be made. An examination of the ovaries for _false_ or _true\r\ncorpora lutea_ should be made. The opinions on the character and\r\ndifferences of these bodies are so discordant as to destroy all\r\nconfidence in their value as proof of conception or the reverse.\r\n\r\nTaylor says: “The discovery of the _ovum_ in the uterus _in process\r\nof development_ could alone, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nwarrant an affirmative opinion on this point in a Court of Law, and\r\nthis I believe to be the safest view at present of this much-contested\r\nquestion. On the other hand, the absence of a corpus luteum from the\r\novary would not in all cases warrant an opinion that conception had not\r\ntaken place.”\r\n\r\nExamine carefully for local sepsis and signs of inflammation of the\r\nuterus and its surrounding structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecapitulation\r\n\r\nIn Medicine, Abortion occurs before the sixth month of\r\npregnancy--premature labour after that period.\r\n\r\nIn Law, Abortion may take place any time before the full period of\r\nutero-gestation.\r\n\r\nAbortion may be due to--\r\n\r\n    1. _Natural or Unavoidable Causes._\r\n            (_a_) Maternal.   (_b_) Fœtal.\r\n    2. _Violence, with Criminal Intent._\r\n            (_a_) Mechanical. (_b_) Medicinal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nINFANTICIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the present state of English law, infanticide--murder of a\r\n_new-born_ child--is not regarded as a specific crime, but is treated\r\nand tried by those rules of evidence which are applicable in cases of\r\nfelonious homicide, but with this difference, that the law requires\r\nproof that the child was born alive. An old Statute (21 Jac. I. c.\r\n27) made the concealment of the birth of a bastard child conclusive\r\nevidence of murder. As far as the legal estimation of the crime is\r\nconcerned, it matters not whether the child was killed immediately\r\non its entrance into the world, or within a few days afterwards. A\r\nfœtus not bigger than a man‘s finger, but having the shape of a child,\r\nis a child within the Statute (R. _v._ Colmer, 9 Cox, 506; R. _v._\r\nHewitt, 4 F. & F. 1101). An English judge, at a late trial, stated\r\nthat if the jury were of the opinion that the prisoner had strangled\r\nher child before being wholly born, she must be acquitted of murder.\r\nThe law also, on the score of humanity, presumes that every child is\r\nborn dead until direct evidence to the contrary, from medical or other\r\nsources, is given. The onus of the proof of live birth, therefore,\r\ndevolves on the prosecution. It may also be difficult to decide as to\r\nthe maternity, and the woman accused will have to be examined as to the\r\npossibility of her recent delivery.\r\n\r\nHere let me repeat the advice given on page 148 as to the examination\r\nof a woman. Your duty is to request the woman to allow of the necessary\r\nexamination, giving her the warning which every magistrate or coroner\r\nis bound to give to any person charged with a crime, before requiring\r\nan answer to a question which may be used in evidence against her at\r\nthe subsequent trial. The innocent and the guilty may alike object to\r\nan examination, but the presumption is against the party declining,\r\nif several have voluntarily submitted. A young lady committed suicide\r\nrather than submit to an examination by two medical men under an order\r\nfrom the coroner. The medical men were guilty of a grave indiscretion,\r\nand both they and the coroner were acting _ultra vires_ in attempting\r\nto force a woman to obtain evidence against herself (Taylor, vol. ii.\r\np. 431).\r\n\r\nThe decision as to recent delivery will, to a great extent, rest on the\r\ncondition of the mother, and the apparent age of the child found dead.\r\nThe discovery of the body of the child is not necessary to conviction,\r\nbut the medical evidence as to the signs of respiration, of course,\r\ndepends on the body being found and examined. In most cases of alleged\r\ninfanticide tried in England, juries appear more inclined to fall back\r\non the minor offence--_concealment of birth_--than to convict of the\r\ncapital offence; and this appears to be the only alternative if the\r\nbody cannot be found, for, as we have just said, in law every child is\r\nheld to be born dead. It must of course be shown that the woman has\r\nbeen recently delivered. In case of failure to prove the murder of the\r\nchild, the Act (24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, sec. 60) enacts that “if any\r\nwoman shall be delivered of a child, every person who shall, by any\r\nsecret disposition of the dead body of the said child, whether such\r\nchild died before, at, or after its birth, endeavour to conceal the\r\nbirth thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.” The mere avowal of\r\nthe birth is not sufficient to convict her; she must be proved to have\r\ndone some act of disposal of the body after the child was dead (R. _v._\r\nTurner, 8 C. & P. 755).\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, _concealment of pregnancy_ is a statutory crime,\r\nchargeable when the child born is found dead or is not found at all,\r\nand there is no proof of its having been murdered. Pregnancy, up to\r\na period when a child might be born alive, must be proved, and the\r\nwords “during the whole period of her pregnancy” do not imply that the\r\npregnancy must have continued for the full period of nine months. All\r\nthat is necessary is that there should be such proof of duration of\r\npregnancy as made a living birth possible. If the accused can bring\r\nforward a witness to whom she communicated her pregnancy, or called for\r\nassistance at the birth, or (it is believed) can prove that the child\r\nwas born dead, she is entitled to an acquittal.\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that a woman ought not to be convicted of\r\n“concealment of pregnancy,” if at the time of delivery the fœtus\r\ndo not appear to have reached the seventh month of intra-uterine\r\nexistence. The birth of a “child,” whether dead or alive, is essential;\r\ntherefore, if the woman accused “can prove that that which she brought\r\nforth was not a ‘child,’ but an abortion, or a _fœtus_, which, from\r\nsome accident, was in such a condition that, though there had been\r\nassistance, it could not have been in a condition to be called ‘a\r\nchild,’ then the case is out of the Statute.” The Scotch Statute\r\ndiffers from the English on the “concealment of birth” in this, that so\r\nlong as the woman makes known her pregnancy, the motive for doing so is\r\nnot considered. Thus, if she make arrangements with anyone to conceal\r\nthe birth, “the Statute is eluded by that very circumstance” (Alison).\r\nThe Statute applies to married as well as to single women; but, in\r\nthe former case, the penalty is seldom enforced unless foul play is\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF THE TERM “LIVE BIRTH” IN CRIMINAL CASES\r\n\r\n“The entire delivery of a child.” There must be an independent\r\ncirculation in the child before it can be accounted alive (R. _v._\r\nEnoch, 5 C. & P. 539). The entire child must be actually born into the\r\nworld in a living state (R. _v._ Poulton, 5 C. & P. 329). But the fact\r\nof the child being still connected with the mother by the umbilical\r\ncord will not prevent the killing from being murder (R. _v._ Reeves, 9\r\nC. & P. 25). To kill a child in its mother‘s womb is no murder, because\r\nthe person killed must be “a reasonable creature in being, and under\r\nthe King‘s peace.” But if the child be injured in the womb, and yet be\r\nborn alive, and then die as a result of such injuries, it may be murder\r\nin the person who inflicted them (R. _v._ Senior, 1 Mood. C. C. 346).\r\n\r\nA distinction must be drawn between _medical_ or _physiological life_\r\nand _legal life_. A child may have breathed, as it not infrequently\r\ndoes, _before_ it is completely born into the world; and this might, in\r\na medical point of view, be considered as a live child, but it is not\r\none legally. The entire delivery of the child is necessary in law; and\r\n“it must also be proved that the entire child has actually been born\r\ninto the world in a living state, and the fact of its having breathed\r\nis not a conclusive proof thereof.” The inference unfortunately follows\r\nfrom this ruling, that a mother may kill her child without fear of\r\npunishment, if she do so before the entire body has slipped from her.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF THE TERM “LIVE BIRTH” IN CIVIL CASES\r\n\r\nThe evidence of live birth in civil is somewhat different from that\r\nrequired in criminal cases. The viability of the child is determined in\r\nScotland by its _crying_; in France, by its respiration; in Germany,\r\n“the LIVE BIRTH of a child is to be held proven when it has been\r\nheard to cry by witnesses of unimpeachable veracity present at its\r\nbirth”; but in England, the pulsation of the child‘s heart, or any\r\ntremulous motion of the muscles, however slight, has been considered as\r\nsatisfactory proof of live birth.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] Fyshe or Fisher _v._ Palmer, in 1806.\r\n\r\nAccording to Blackstone, “crying, indeed, is the strongest evidence,\r\nbut it is not the _only_ evidence”; and Coke remarks, “If it be born\r\nalive, it is sufficient though it be not heard to cry, for peradventure\r\nit may be born dumb.”\r\n\r\n=Signs of Live Birth prior to Respiration, and independent of it.=--(1)\r\nNegative.--Signs of intra-uterine death, _i.e._ putrefaction, or\r\n“intra-uterine maceration,” or of such imperfect development that it\r\ncould not have been born alive. (2) Positive.--Injuries to the child\r\nshowing that it must have been born alive.\r\n\r\n1. Negative.--_Intra-uterine Putrefaction._--This condition differs in\r\nsome remarkable points from putrefaction in air.\r\n\r\nThe body is extremely flaccid and flattened, the bones of the cranium\r\nmoving easily on one another. The skin of the hands and other parts of\r\nthe body bear the evidence of prolonged soaking in fluid. In parts,\r\nthe skin is whitish, or of a reddish-brown or coppery-red colour,\r\nwithout any trace of green, which is always present when putrefaction\r\ntakes place in the air. The cuticle may be raised in blisters, and be\r\neasily detached from the true skin. The denuded patches are moist and\r\ngreasy, and exude a stinking, reddish-coloured serous fluid. The face\r\nis flattened, and the features distorted. In one case that Husband\r\nattended of intra-uterine death of the fœtus in a primipara, and where\r\nputrefaction was far advanced, the scalp burst during delivery, and\r\nthe brain was poured out. Should, however, the child be exposed to\r\nthe air, it may soon acquire the appearances proper to putrefaction\r\nin that medium. If the child, immediately after birth, be thrown into\r\nwater, the putrefactive changes would be like those of intra-uterine\r\ndecomposition. In this case the lungs must be examined for the evidence\r\nof death by drowning.\r\n\r\n2. Positive.--Evidence that injuries found on the body could not have\r\nbeen inflicted during birth, or accidentally after birth. On this\r\nsubject it is scarcely possible to give an opinion one way or the\r\nother. All the medical witness can fairly state is, that, from the\r\ncondition of the lungs, respiration has or has not taken place; that,\r\nin the former case, it is not easy to state whether the injuries were\r\nthe cause of death or inflicted after death.\r\n\r\n=Appearances showing that a New-Born Child has breathed.=--1. Walls\r\nof the Chest.--“The vaulting of the thorax is not of the slightest\r\ndiagnostic value.” Casper quotes from Elsässer the following remarks:\r\n“It is irrefutable that the variations in the circumference of the\r\nthorax (and, of course, in its diameters) are so considerable that no\r\ncertain normal mean for a thorax that has breathed, and for one that\r\nhas not breathed, can be laid down. In most cases the measurements\r\nof the thorax are incapable of determining whether the lungs contain\r\nair or not. The reasons for these variations is, without doubt, to be\r\nreferred to the congenital differences in the volume of the osseous\r\nthorax; partly, also, to the thickness of the soft parts, particularly\r\nof the subcutaneous fat and the thoracic muscles; partly, also, to the\r\ndifferences in the degree and amount of the dilatation of the thorax by\r\nrespiration, with which the distension of the lungs also corresponds,”\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n2. Diaphragm.--The position of the diaphragm may be considered as a\r\ngood diagnostic sign; for it is found that, in children born dead,\r\nthe highest point of the concavity is between the fourth and fifth\r\nribs, whereas in those born alive it is between the fifth and sixth.\r\nThe position of the diaphragm may be affected by the gases produced\r\nduring putrefaction, and also, in children who have _breathed_, from\r\ndistension of the stomach and intestines with gas.\r\n\r\n3. Stomach and Intestines.--With regard to the stomach, Tardieu has\r\nsuggested that the presence of air-bubbles in the glairy mucus usually\r\nfound in that organ is a sign of live birth, as it can only have arisen\r\nfrom the swallowing of saliva and mucus, aerated by repeated attempts\r\nat respiration, probably lasting from five to fifteen minutes. Air\r\nin the duodenum is strong evidence of live birth. Breslau of Prague,\r\nwho has further investigated this subject, states that, in children\r\nborn dead, or who have undergone prolonged intra-uterine putrefaction,\r\nthere is never any accumulation of gas in the stomach or intestines,\r\nand that the presence of gas in these organs is contemporaneous\r\nwith respiration, and is independent of the ingestion of food.\r\nThe intestines of newly-born children do not float in water, but\r\nrapidly sink in that fluid. As respiration proceeds, the coils of the\r\nintestines become distended with gas.\r\n\r\n4. Kidneys and Bladder.--The presence of crystals of uric acid in the\r\npelvis of the kidneys and even in the bladder has been suggested as\r\na sign of live birth. Uric acid infarction, as it has been called,\r\nusually occurs in from two to ten days after birth, at a period when\r\nthere are more important signs of live birth than this, even if\r\ninfarction did not occur, as it does, in still-born infants.\r\n\r\n5. Lungs.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Size._--In the fœtus, prior to respiration, the lungs do not\r\nfill the cavity of the chest, and the left lung is never found even\r\npartially covering the heart.\r\n\r\nAfter respiration they fill the thorax more or less completely, the\r\namount of distension depending, of course, upon the completeness of the\r\nrespiratory acts on the part of the child.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Consistence._--Before respiration has taken place, the lungs\r\nfeel firm, compact, and resistant, and are of the consistency of liver.\r\n\r\nAfter respiration they are spongy, crepitant, and yielding when pressed\r\nbetween the fingers. They also present a marbled appearance. These\r\nsigns of respiration are more or less modified by disease, and the\r\n_atelectasis pulmonum_ of Jörg, jun.\r\n\r\nCasper denies the existence of _atelectasis pulmonum_ as a distinct\r\ndisease of newly-born children, and considers that “it is nothing\r\nelse than the original fœtal condition, from which it differs in no\r\nanatomical respect”--an opinion supported by Meigs, who says “it, in\r\nfact, resembles exactly the fœtal lung.” It is simply the result of the\r\nchild dying from some cause before respiration has had time to become\r\nfully established, and has possibly been confounded with hepatisation.\r\nIt must also be remembered that cases are on record of infants having\r\nlived for some hours, and then died, yet the lungs sank as a whole, and\r\nwhen cut in pieces.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Colour._--The colour of the fœtal lungs is “exceedingly\r\nvarious,” and it is by no means easy to convey the idea of colour by\r\nwords. Speaking in general terms, the lungs of children who have _not_\r\nbreathed are of a reddish-brown liver colour, this colour changing\r\nto a brighter red at their margins. In children who _have_ breathed,\r\nthe lungs are of a slaty-blue colour, more or less mottled with\r\ncircumscribed red patches. This circumscribed mottling is _never_ found\r\nin perfectly fœtal lungs. When the lungs are inflated artificially,\r\nthey swell up and present a uniform cinnabar-red colour, destitute of\r\ninsular marbling. The insular marbling of the lungs is characteristic\r\nof lungs that have breathed, and is due to the presence of blood in the\r\narteries and veins surrounding the inflated lung tissue.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Buoyancy in Water._--Lungs which have respired float in water.\r\n\r\nBut the objection may be raised that lungs that have _not_ respired may\r\nyet float from--\r\n\r\n    1. The result of artificial respiration.\r\n    2. The result of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe value of these objections will be discussed in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe following table is given by Tidy:\r\n\r\n    --------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n     Lungs that have not Breathed.  |   Lungs that have Breathed.\r\n    --------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n      1.

Admitting that a lung floats as a result of\r\nrespiration, it has been objected that this is no proof of live birth,\r\nfor respiration may take place in:\r\n\r\n    1. The womb, _vagitus uterinus_.\r\n    2. The maternal passages, _vagitus vaginalis_.\r\n    3. Cases when the head protrudes, the body not yet being born.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the two first objections, it will be sufficient to say\r\nthat, in all the cases of so-called intra-uterine respiration, the\r\nrespiratory acts have occurred in difficult or instrumental labours,\r\nwhere it is justifiable to suppose that, in the endeavour to remove the\r\nchild, a certain amount of air may have been unavoidably admitted into\r\nthe maternal passages. But the cases with which the medical jurist has\r\nto deal cannot be classed with these, for in all those brought under\r\nhis notice delivery has been more or less rapid and unassisted.\r\n\r\nTo the last objection the same reply may be given, that rapid delivery\r\nin doubtful cases must be considered as the rule, and that the time\r\nwhich elapses between the birth of the head of the child and its\r\ncomplete delivery is so short as not to lead to any great error in\r\ndiagnosis. It is true that the woman may faint with the child half\r\nborn, and that respiration may thus take place; and it has not yet been\r\ndecided how many inspirations a child must make to entirely inflate its\r\nlungs, or the length of time required to do so.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--Any pressure exerted on the umbilical cord during the process\r\nof delivery gives rise to respiratory acts on the part of the fœtus.\r\nThe presence of what Casper calls _petechial ecchymoses_ beneath the\r\npleuræ, upon the aorta, and even on the heart, are, as a rule, a proof\r\nthat attempts at respiration have been made. These petechial ecchymoses\r\nare sometimes found on the same parts in the drowned. (See “Drowning.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Hydrostatic Lung Test performed? and What are the Objections\r\nto its Use?\r\n\r\nAs this test was first used, it consisted in placing the lungs, with\r\nor without the heart, in water, and then noting whether they sank or\r\nfloated. A glass vessel, eighteen inches high and twelve in diameter,\r\nhalf filled with distilled water at 60° F., should be used. In summer,\r\nwater at the ordinary temperature of the room will answer the purpose.\r\nTo this rough test pressure is now added; the lung, or portions of it,\r\nare greatly compressed in a linen cloth, and then thrown into water as\r\nbefore. If the lungs thus compressed float, respiration is held to have\r\ntaken place; should they sink, the contrary is presumed.\r\n\r\nPressure is used for the following reason: The air generated by\r\nputrefaction, and which may cause the lungs to float, is removed by\r\npressure, but no amount of pressure, short of entirely destroying\r\nthe lung tissue, will remove that which is the result of respiration\r\nor inflation; and between these the medical expert must decide from\r\ncollateral evidence.\r\n\r\nIn performing the test: (1) Try if the lungs will float with the heart\r\nand thymus gland attached to them. (2) If they will float without the\r\nheart, &c. (3) Try if portions will float with or without pressure.\r\n\r\nThe following are the Objections to this Test:\r\n\r\n    1. The lungs may sink as a result of disease.\r\n    2. Respiration, even in healthy lungs, may be so\r\n         imperfect that they may sink.\r\n    3. Emphysema pulmonum neonatorum.\r\n    4. Putrefaction.\r\n    5. Artificial inflation.\r\n\r\n1. That in consequence of disease the entire lungs, or portions of\r\nthem, may sink, and yet respiration may have taken place. Disease of\r\nthe lung may occur previously to birth or soon afterwards, but it is\r\nscarcely probable that the disease would attack every portion of the\r\nlung. Parts, doubtless, small in proportion to the diseased part, may\r\nyet have been sufficiently inflated to float. The presence of disease\r\nis also not difficult of detection.\r\n\r\n2. That respiration, even in healthy lungs, may be so imperfect that\r\nthey may sink. This objection can scarcely be considered valid against\r\nthe general application of the test, for in these cases there is no\r\nknown test by which respiration or its absence can be determined. They\r\nare, therefore, out of the pale of the test, as they are out of every\r\nother mode of investigation.\r\n\r\n3. _Emphysema pulmonum neonatorum._--Emphysema is generally the result\r\nof excessive dilatation of the air cells of the lung, rupture of the\r\ncell walls, and infiltration of the intra-lobular areola tissue. This\r\ncondition may be brought about by:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Respiration. (_b_) Inflation.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is simply this, that the so-called _emphysema\r\npulmonum neonatorum_, or emphysema of new-born children, is nothing\r\nmore or less than incipient putrefaction, induced by certain\r\nunascertained conditions.\r\n\r\nCasper sums up his conclusions on this subject in the following words:\r\n“That not one single well-observed and incontestable case of emphysema,\r\ndeveloping itself spontaneously within the lungs of a fœtus born\r\nwithout artificial assistance, is known; and it is not, therefore,\r\npermissible in forensic practice to ascribe the buoyancy of the lungs\r\nof new-born children, brought forth in secrecy and without artificial\r\nassistance, to this cause.”\r\n\r\n4. _Putrefaction._--It must be admitted as proved that the lungs of\r\nnew-born children in a state of decomposition will float in water.\r\nBut this admission does not render the test valueless, for it must be\r\nremembered:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) That air generated by putrefaction is found in bubbles\r\n          _under_ the pleuræ, or in the fissures between the\r\n          _lobuli_ of the lungs, and _not in the air cells_ of\r\n          the lungs.\r\n    (_b_) That gas as a result of putrefaction can easily be\r\n          removed by compressing the lungs, or portions of them.\r\n    (_c_) That crepitation in putrefied lungs is absent, owing\r\n          to the fact stated under (_a_).\r\n    (_d_) That the lungs are among those organs which putrefy\r\n          late.\r\n    (_e_) That negative evidence may be obtained, if the lungs,\r\n          in a highly putrescent body, sink in water. The\r\n          tendency of putrefaction, as above stated, is to cause\r\n          them to float.\r\n\r\n5. _Inflation._--In the first place, it is to be remarked that to\r\ninflate the lungs is by no means an easy task. Elsässer states “that\r\nin forty-five experiments performed on children born dead, without\r\nopening their thorax and abdomen, only _one_ was attended with complete\r\nsuccess, thirty-four with partial success, and ten with none whatever;\r\nand it must also be remembered that these experiments were conducted\r\nwithout disturbance, and with the greatest care.” Professor Gross\r\nstates his opinion on this subject thus: “We are decidedly of opinion\r\nthat artificial inflation of the lungs is a very difficult matter; and\r\nwe believe that the complete distension of these organs can only be\r\neffected where a tube is introduced into the mouth of the larynx.” In\r\nthe cases that come before the medical expert, the question naturally\r\narises, Who would inflate the lungs? Surely not the mother. If not the\r\nmother, who else? It has been suggested that some malicious person\r\nmight inflate them to sustain a charge of infanticide. Is this probable?\r\n\r\nThe following points may be noticed on this subject:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Known difficulty in inflating the lungs.\r\n    (_b_) Absence on the part of the mother of any preparation to\r\n           save the life of her child.\r\n    (_c_) Presence of air in the stomach and intestines, the result\r\n           of attempted inflation.\r\n    (_d_) Bright cinnabar-red colour of the lungs, without trace\r\n           of mottling.\r\n    (_e_) Absence of frothy blood when the lungs are cut into.\r\n    (_f_) When, therefore, we observe the following\r\n           phenomena, a sound of crepitation without any escape\r\n           of blood-froth on incision, _laceration_ of the\r\n           pulmonary cells with hyperæmia, bright cinnabar-red\r\n           colour of the lungs _without any marbling_, and\r\n           perhaps _air_ in the (artificially inflated)\r\n           stomach and intestines, we may with certainty conclude\r\n           that the _lungs have been artificially inflated_.\r\n\r\nIt may be further noted that natural respiration is accompanied with,\r\nfirst, the distension of the air cells of the lungs with air; and,\r\nsecond, with an increased flow of blood into the organs, beyond that\r\nnecessary for their nourishment and growth. They thus increase in\r\nabsolute weight, while their specific gravity is lessened.\r\n\r\nThe objections just mentioned apply to the hydrostatic test as\r\noriginally employed. It will now be necessary to notice those against\r\nthe same test when modified by pressure. These are two in number:\r\n\r\n1. That no amount of pressure, short of entirely destroying the lung\r\ntissue, can expel the air from a lung that has been inflated, or from\r\none in which respiration has taken place.\r\n\r\n2. Pressure is, therefore, no test of natural respiration or of\r\nartificial inflation.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the above, it will only be necessary to refer to what has\r\nbeen already said with regard to the difficulty of inflation, and the\r\nmore probable event of the condition of the lungs being the result of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nCasper thus sums up the result of his views with regard to the\r\nprobative value of the _docimasia pulmonaris_:\r\n\r\n“=That a child has certainly lived during and after its birth=--\r\n\r\n“1. When the diaphragm stands between the fifth and sixth ribs.\r\n\r\n“2. When the lungs more or less completely occupy the thorax, or at\r\nleast do not require to be sought for by artificial separation of the\r\nwalls when cut through.\r\n\r\n“3. When the ground colour of the lungs is broken by insular marblings.\r\n\r\n“4. When the lungs are found by careful experiment to be capable of\r\nfloating.\r\n\r\n“5. When a bloody froth flows from the cut surface of the lung on\r\nslight pressure.”\r\n\r\n=The Lung Test is unnecessary when=--\r\n\r\n1. The umbilical cord has dropped off, and cicatrisation has followed.\r\n\r\n2. Where food is found in the stomach.\r\n\r\n3. Where there are evident signs of putrefaction _in utero_.\r\n\r\n4. Also in the case of the birth of monsters, or where, from congenital\r\nmalformation, the possibility of live birth is excluded.\r\n\r\nBesides the hydrostatic test, the following have been proposed:\r\n\r\nPloucquet‘s Test.--This test is based on the relative weight of the\r\nlungs, before and after respiration, to that of the entire body of the\r\nchild. The variations found in practice between the relative weights\r\nrender the test worse than useless.\r\n\r\nAbsolute Weight of the Lungs.--This test consists in a comparison\r\nof the weight of the lungs before and after respiration, and it may\r\nbe stated here that the lungs, prior to respiration, vary in weight\r\nfrom about 400 to 650 grains; but so much depends on the maturity or\r\nimmaturity of the child, and degree of respiration, that, like the\r\nlast, the test is unworthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nWredin‘s Test.--Dr. Wredin, of Petrograd, states that the gelatinous\r\nsubstance found in the middle ear of infants before birth, gradually\r\ndisappears, to be replaced by air on the subsequent establishment of\r\nrespiration. Wendt, of Leipzig, from an examination of 300 cases,\r\ndeclares that the gelatinous substance can only be expelled by the\r\nestablishment of full respiration. The value of this test has been\r\nquestioned, as some observers have found that in different cases\r\nintervals of from a few hours to five weeks have occurred, before the\r\nreplacement of the gelatinous material by air.\r\n\r\nTable Showing the Signs of Maturity of Child At Birth\r\n\r\nAs regards:\r\n\r\n    1. _Average Length of Body._--Nineteen inches.\r\n    2. _Average Weight of Body._--About seven pounds.\r\n    3. _Eyes._--The pupillary membrane is not found in the\r\n        mature child.\r\n    4. _Navel._--Said to be exactly midway between the\r\n        pubes and the ensiform cartilage.\r\n    5. _External Genitals._--Testicles found in the\r\n        scrotum, and the labia majora cover the vagina and\r\n        clitoris.\r\n    6. _Os Femoris._--Ossification of the inferior\r\n        femoral epiphysis. The osseous nucleus measures from\r\n        three-quarters of a line to three lines in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF DEATH TO THE FŒTUS\r\n\r\nDeath may be due to--\r\n\r\n      I. Immaturity on the part of the fœtus.\r\n     II. Complications occurring during or immediately after birth.\r\n    III. Congenital disease in one or more of the fœtal organs.\r\n     IV. Neglect or exposure, constituting “Infanticide by Omission.”\r\n\r\nI. Immaturity on the part of Fœtus.-From some cause or another, the\r\nchild may die immediately after birth, in spite of every attempt to\r\nsave it. In many of these cases no disease adequate to account for\r\ndeath can be detected.\r\n\r\nII. Complications occurring during or immediately after Birth.--(1)\r\nUnavoidable or inherent in the process of parturition. (2) Induced with\r\ncriminal intent, constituting “infanticide by commission.”\r\n\r\n1. _Unavoidable or Inherent in the Process of Parturition._--The\r\nimmediate cause of death may be either maternal or fœtal. In the\r\nformer, the presence of tumours in the pelvic passages, or disease\r\nof the bones, causing a narrowing of the canal, may lead to fatal\r\ncompression of the head of the child. Death may also be due to\r\nprotracted labour from debility on the part of the mother, or she may\r\nsuddenly faint after delivery. A congested state of the brain may\r\nbe present in these cases. In the latter (fœtal), pressure on the\r\numbilical cord from malposition of the child during labour, or an\r\nabnormal increase in the size of the head, may cause death. There is\r\nalso a greater mortality, both during and after delivery, among male\r\nthan female children. The child may be also accidentally suffocated in\r\nthe fæces of the mother, or in the fold of her dress; or it may be born\r\nwhile the woman is straining at stool, and be drowned in the contents\r\nof the pan. Husband once met with a case of accidental death of a\r\nchild from suffocation in the drawers of the mother, who persisted,\r\nfrom motives of delicacy, in wearing those articles of dress during\r\nher confinement. Death may also result from strangulation, occasioned\r\nby the pressure of the funis round the child‘s neck. The death in this\r\ncase can scarcely be considered as due to strangulation, as the child\r\nhad never breathed, but it is probably the result of the arrest of the\r\nflow of blood along the cord, from the tightness of the folds round the\r\nneck. Some congestion of the brain may, however, be found resulting\r\nfrom the pressure on the vessels of the neck. Lastly, death may\r\nensue from a fall on the floor in cases of sudden and quick labours,\r\nespecially if the woman be in the erect posture at the time of delivery.\r\n\r\n2. _Induced with Criminal Intent._--Infanticide by commission: was\r\nthe death due to violence? The answer to this question is by no means\r\neasy. In all doubtful cases the attendant circumstances must be taken\r\ninto consideration. A woman may unintentionally injure her child in her\r\nefforts to drag it from her. The presence of respiration, more or less\r\ncomplete, is strongly presumptive against the death being the result\r\nof accident. But even here considerable caution is necessary, for the\r\ninjury may not be immediately fatal, although accidentally inflicted,\r\nsufficient time elapsing between its infliction and the death of the\r\nchild to allow of respiration. Foreign bodies found in the mouth and\r\nfauces are also corroborative of death by violence. A case is recorded\r\nin which the child‘s fauces, upper portion of the œsophagus, the\r\nlarynx, and the trachea were closely packed with a coarse green sand,\r\nand yet the lungs sank when the hydrostatic test was applied to them.\r\nThere was nothing to show when the packing of the fauces was effected.\r\n\r\nStrangulation may be produced by the constriction of the umbilical\r\ncord round the neck, and for this reason marks round the child‘s\r\nneck cannot always be ascribed to intentional violence. Of 327 cases\r\ncollected by Elsässer, in which the cord was from one to four times\r\nround the children‘s necks, there was not in a single instance any\r\nmark of the cord perceptible, even though in some cases the cord had\r\nto be cut to permit the completion of labour. With regard to marks\r\nround the neck of a new-born child, Casper remarks that it is possible\r\n“to mistake the folds of the skin, produced by the movements of the\r\nhead, and which remain strongly marked in the solidified fat, and are\r\nvery prominent, particularly in short necks, for the marks of the\r\ncord.” The _mark_ left by the _funis_ is broad, corresponds with the\r\nbreadth of the cord, runs without interruption round the neck, and is\r\neverywhere quite soft, and never excoriated. Ecchymoses may be present,\r\nirregularly following the line made by the cord. On the other hand,\r\n“a mummified, parchment-like, unecchymosed depression points in every\r\ncase to strangulation by a hard, rough body,” and this more especially\r\nif there be any abrasion of the cuticle or laceration of the skin.\r\nDeath, sometimes ascribed to strangulation, is probably the result\r\nof suffocation, and happens thus: any pressure exerted on the cord\r\ncuts off the blood from the placenta to the fœtus, and gives rise to\r\nrespiratory attempts on the part of the child, the child dying from\r\nsuffocation, or from the engorgement of the lungs with liquor amnii\r\ndrawn into them at every effort to breathe. An infant may be poisoned.\r\nThis cause of death is very rare, but deaths have resulted from the\r\nuse of poisonous gases. While on this subject it may be advisable\r\nto state here that ulcerations have been found in the stomach and\r\nintestines more or less accompanied with a collection of dark brown or\r\nblack bloody fluid, which have given rise to suspicions of poisoning\r\nin infants to all outward appearances quite healthy. An infant may be\r\nthrown into water and drowned. No traces of this mode of death would\r\nbe discoverable in the infant unless respiration had taken place prior\r\nto its immersion. The plea of accidental drowning in a cesspool or\r\nwater-closet pan may be put forward; it is therefore well to examine\r\nthe cord. Has a ligature been placed upon it? Has it been cut by a\r\nsharp instrument? The nature and character of the fluid found in the\r\nstomach should be noted.\r\n\r\nFractures of the skull may happen--\r\n\r\n1. _In the Womb._--The parturient female may fall from a considerable\r\nheight, and thus cause injury to her child. These cases are of no\r\njudicial importance, as the presence of intra-uterine putrefaction or\r\nan examination of the lungs will at once show that the child has not\r\nbreathed. It must be borne in mind, however, that dislocations may take\r\nplace in the womb, and this fact may be brought forward in defence. The\r\nhistory of the case, and the absence of any other signs of violence,\r\nwill decide the truth or falsity of the plea.\r\n\r\n2. _During Labour._--Fracture of the cranial bones during labour\r\ngenerally occurs in difficult and protracted labours, which, from\r\nthis very cause, seldom become the subject of judicial inquiry. In\r\nsome cases the defective ossification of the bones of the skull may\r\ngive rise to fractures, which may lead to dangerous mistakes. This\r\ndeficiency, in the process of ossification is thus described by Casper:\r\n“If the bone in question is held up to the light, this is seen to shine\r\nthrough the opening, which is closed only by the pericranium. When the\r\nperiosteal membrane is removed, the deficiency in the ossification\r\nis seen in the form of a round or irregularly circular opening, not\r\noften more than three lines in diameter, though frequently less; its\r\nedges are irregular and serrated: these edges are _never depressed,\r\nas is the case in fractures_; and neither they nor the parts in their\r\nneighbourhood are ever observed to be ecchymosed.” The child in these\r\ncases may breathe for a short time, and then die without any apparent\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Photo-micrograph of human milk, × 250.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n3. _By Falls._--It is beyond doubt possible for a child to be born so\r\nprecipitately as to fall on the floor and be severely injured, and that\r\neven fatally. In cases of alleged precipitate birth, to account for\r\ninjuries found on the child, the following points should be remembered,\r\nand will assist in forming a diagnosis:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In Favour of Precipitate Birth and Accidental Injury\r\n\r\n(_a_) Rupture of the umbilical cord. In all cases it would be advisable\r\nto measure the length of the cord, and then the distance of the vulva\r\nfrom the ground, allowing of course for the woman not being quite\r\nerect at the time of delivery owing to a separation of the legs. A\r\ndisproportion between the two measurements may or may not account for\r\nthe rupture of the cord. The following measurements may be taken: usual\r\nlength of cord, eighteen to twenty inches; distance of vulva from the\r\nground, twenty-six inches, but allowing for stooping, two-thirds of the\r\nabove. To the length of the cord must be added about nine inches, the\r\ndistance from the navel to the top of the head of the child. Thus, a\r\nfall of about thirty inches will put no strain on the cord. A case is\r\non record of a rupture of the cord taking place while the woman was in\r\na _recumbent_ position, but in that case the labour was precipitate,\r\nand the cord very short and small.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Placenta not detached from the child.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Fracture of the parietal bones; the fracture radiating into the\r\nfrontal and squamous portion of the temporal bone. In experiments\r\non twenty-five children dropped from a height of thirty inches, one\r\nparietal bone was found fractured in sixteen of the cases; both\r\nparietals, in six cases. The fractures in most cases occurred about the\r\nparietal protuberances. It must be remembered that the children were\r\ndead, and that it is easier to fracture the skull of a live infant than\r\nthat of a dead one.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Imperfect ossification of the bones of the skull.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Absence of other injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In Favour of Criminal Violence\r\n\r\n(_a_) The fact of the umbilical cord being divided by some sharp\r\ninstrument and not torn. A caution must be here inserted, for Taylor\r\nmentions a case where rupture of the cord occurred in such a manner\r\nthat it could not be decided whether it had been intentionally cut or\r\ntorn.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Extensive fracture of one or more of the bones of the cranium.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Fracture and dislocation of the neck.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Presence of incised wounds, and other evidence of violence.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--In all doubtful cases, a guarded opinion should\r\n        be given, stating simply that the dissection does not\r\n        reveal anything contrary to the statements offered as to\r\n        the cause of death.\r\n\r\nIII. Congenital Disease in one or more of the Fœtal Organs.--In all\r\ncases the presence of congenital disease must be sought for.\r\n\r\nIV. Neglect or Exposure, constituting “Infanticide by Omission.”--Under\r\nthis head may be mentioned the following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Neglecting to place the child in such a position that it may\r\nbreathe freely.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Neglecting to protect the child from extremes of cold or heat.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Neglecting to feed it with the food appropriate to its age. (See\r\nSigns of Death from Starvation, pp. 132 _et seq._)\r\n\r\n(_d_) Neglecting to tie the umbilical cord.\r\n\r\nTo give answers to these questions will in many cases be impossible,\r\nand each must be decided by such circumstances as present themselves\r\nin each individual case. For instance, if the body be found stiff,\r\nblanched, naked or nearly so, lying on the ground, the vessels of\r\nthe interior gorged with blood, whilst the superficial vessels are\r\ncontracted and can be seen only with difficulty; at the same time,\r\nthe hydrostatic test shows that respiration has taken place, and in\r\nthe absence of all external or internal causes--the probability is in\r\nfavour of death by cold. In close relation with the present subject is\r\nthe question--\r\n\r\n=Has the Infant bled to Death?=--Fatal hæmorrhage from the cord may\r\noccur, especially if it be divided by a sharp instrument close to the\r\nbody of the child. As a rule, hæmorrhage does not occur from a ruptured\r\ncord. (The signs of death from hæmorrhage have been noticed, page 81.)\r\n\r\n=How Long did the Child survive its Birth?=--The answer to this\r\nquestion is by no means easy, and the data on which a decision can\r\nbe based are not very reliable. The presence or absence of the\r\n_vernix caseosa_ should be noticed. In still-born children the closed\r\neyelids, when raised, do not remain open; in the live-born, on the\r\nother hand, the eyes remain half open even after repeated attempts to\r\nclose them. Another guide to the determination of the length of time\r\nthe child survived its birth may be found in the absence or presence\r\nof the meconium in the intestines. The meconium--so-called from its\r\nresemblance to inspissated poppy juice--is found in the large intestine\r\nas a dark-greenish pasty mass, more or less filling that portion of\r\nthe bowel. In the upper portions of the intestines it varies from a\r\nlight-yellowish or greyish to a greenish-brown colour, till in the\r\nlarge intestine it assumes the colour and consistence above mentioned.\r\nIt is generally discharged by the infant in from four or five to\r\nforty-eight hours after birth. In breech presentations it may be passed\r\nduring the process of delivery, although the child be still-born; but\r\nits entire absence from the intestines is presumptive of existence for\r\nsome days after birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Photo-micrograph of starch granules, × 250\r\n(potato).

The time\r\nat which this occurs is so variable as to be of little value in a\r\nmedico-legal inquiry.\r\n\r\n2. _Changes in the Umbilical Cord._--Mummification of the cord is\r\nnot of the slightest value as a proof of extra-uterine life; but the\r\nseparation of the cord which occurs between the fourth and seventh day,\r\nespecially when cicatrisation has taken place, is a sure sign that the\r\nchild must have lived four or five days at least. Two other appearances\r\nof some value may also be noted, namely:\r\n\r\n(_a_) In fresh bodies, the appearance of a bright red ring about a line\r\nin breadth, which surrounds the insertion of the cord, and which is\r\nformed within the uterus.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A similar red ring, about two lines broad, around the insertion\r\nof the cord, accompanied with “_thickening, inflammatory swelling of\r\nthe portion of the skin affected, and slight purulent secretion from\r\nthe umbilical ring itself_.” This latter condition Casper considers as\r\naffording “_irrefragable proof of the extra-uterine life of the child_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Changes in the Circulatory System._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Ductus Arteriosus.--Arterial duct. A contracted condition of this\r\nduct is of no value as a proof that a child has survived its birth; for\r\nthe duct is liable to become contracted, and even obliterated, before\r\nthe birth of the child.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ductus Venosus.--Nothing certain is known as to the exact time\r\nwhen this duct closes; the condition of the vessel is, therefore, of no\r\nassistance in determining the possibility of the child having survived\r\nits birth. The duct has been found closed in a still-born child; and\r\nin one child, which lived for a quarter of an hour, both the _ductus\r\narteriosus_ and the _foramen ovale_ were found closed. Cases are also\r\non record in which these fœtal channels were found open after thirty\r\ndays of extra-uterine life.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Foramen Ovale.--What has been said of the preceding may be said\r\nwith regard to the foramen ovale.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--To sum up, therefore, in the fewest words,\r\n        any attempt at forming an opinion on the _docimasia\r\n        circulationis_ may result in a fatal error on the\r\n        part of the medical witness, as it is impossible to\r\n        determine with any accuracy by days the period of their\r\n        closure. As a general statement, however, the following,\r\n        according to Bernt and Orfila, is the order in which\r\n        obliteration of the fœtal vessels takes place: (1) The\r\n        umbilical arteries. (2) Ductus venosus. (3) Ductus\r\n        arteriosus. (4) Foramen ovale.\r\n\r\nSynopsis\r\n\r\n1. Infanticide is not regarded as a specific crime.\r\n\r\n2. To be tried by the same rules of evidence as apply to murder.\r\n\r\n3. The law presumes that every child is born dead, till proof to the\r\ncontrary is given.\r\n\r\n4. Onus of proving live birth devolves on the prosecution.\r\n\r\n5. The body need not be found in order to obtain conviction of the\r\nsuspected party, if not of infanticide, at least of concealment of\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence, however, depends on the body being found and\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nThe medical witness may be examined on one or more of the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n    (1) The recent delivery of the accused.\r\n          (For “Signs of Recent Delivery,” see page 155 et seq.)\r\n    (2) Maturity of the child found.\r\n    (3) Was the child still-born or live-born?\r\n    (4) Cause of death.\r\n    (5) Lastly, as to the mental condition of the mother.\r\n        Puerperal mania, &c.\r\n\r\n6. In absence of proof of infanticide, the woman, in England, may be\r\ntried for _concealment of birth_, that is, disposing secretly of the\r\nbody, whether the child be born dead or alive.\r\n\r\n7. In Scotland, a woman may be tried for _concealment of pregnancy_\r\nwhen the child is dead or missing, if she do not call for or make use\r\nof help or assistance in the birth; but the case is quashed, if the\r\nchild be shown alive by the mother to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    INHERITANCE--LEGITIMACY--IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY\r\n        --SURVIVORSHIP--MALPRAXIS AND NEGLECT OF DUTY\r\n        --FEIGNED DISEASES--EXEMPTION FROM PUBLIC DUTIES\r\n        --WILLS\r\n\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE\r\n\r\nThis subject will be discussed under the following heads: (1) The child\r\nmust be born alive. (2) The child must be born during the lifetime\r\nof the mother. (3) The child must be born capable of inheriting. (4)\r\nTenancy by courtesy, and _possessio patris_.\r\n\r\n=1. The Child must be born alive.=--This has been discussed in the\r\npreceding section.\r\n\r\n=2. The Child must be born during the lifetime of the Mother.=--Death\r\nterminates the marriage contract. Would a child born after the death of\r\nthe mother, and therefore not during marriage, be entitled to inherit?\r\n\r\nOn this point Lord Coke writes:--“If a woman, seised of lands in fee,\r\ntaketh husband, and by him is bigge with childe, and in her travell\r\ndyeth, and the childe is ripped out of her body alive, yet shall he\r\nnot be tenant by the curtesie, because the child was not born during\r\nthe marriage nor in the life of the wife; but in the meantime her land\r\ndescended.”\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that the husband is not entitled to the life-rent.\r\n\r\n=3. The Child must be born capable of inheriting.=--Monsters cannot\r\ninherit according to law. Blackstone says: “A monster which hath not\r\nthe shape of mankind hath no inheritable blood,” and cannot, therefore,\r\ninherit; but, “if it hath human shape, it may be an heir.”\r\n\r\nBuffon classes monsters under three divisions: (_a_) Monsters by excess\r\nof organs. (_b_) Monsters by defect of organs. (_c_) Monsters by\r\nalteration or wrong position of parts.\r\n\r\nA hermaphrodite inherits, or not, property according to the prevailing\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n=4. Tenancy by Courtesy and Possessio Patris.=--“When a man marries a\r\nwoman seised of an estate of inheritance, and has by her issue _born\r\nalive_, which was capable of inheriting her estate; in this case he\r\nshall, on the death of his wife, hold the lands for his life as tenant\r\nby the courtesy of England.”\r\n\r\nThere is yet another case bearing closely on this subject, known in law\r\nas _possessio fratris_. On this subject Mr. Amos writes: “In the event\r\nof a man twice married dying, and leaving a daughter by each marriage,\r\nhis estate would be equally shared by the daughters of the two\r\nmarriages; but if we suppose that there is also a son by the second\r\nmarriage, born in a doubtful state, the legal effect of his momentarily\r\nsurviving birth would be to disinherit the daughter of the first\r\nmarriage entirely, and transfer the whole of the estate to the daughter\r\nof the second marriage, she being sister to the male heir, while the\r\ndaughter of the first marriage is only half-blood.”\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases proof of live birth, as before mentioned, is of\r\nthe slenderest kind.\r\n\r\nA fœtus in the womb (_en ventre sa mère_) may--(_a_) Have a legacy\r\nor estate made over to it. (_b_) A guardian assigned to it. That\r\nthese conditions may take effect, it must be born alive. (_c_) Be an\r\nexecutor. To exercise this _post partum_ function, the child must in\r\nEngland have attained the age of twenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGITIMACY\r\n\r\nEvery child born in wedlock is presumed to have the husband of the\r\nwoman as its father; but this presumption may be denied for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n    1. Absence or death of the reputed father.\r\n    2. Impotence or disease in the reputed father, preventing\r\n       matrimonial intercourse.\r\n    3. In the case of a premature delivery in a newly-married woman.\r\n    4. Want of access.\r\n    5. The paternity of the child may be disputed when the woman\r\n       marries immediately after the death of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, a child is held to be legitimate if born ten lunar months\r\nafter the death or absence of its alleged father; and the absence of\r\nthe supposed father must continue till within six lunar months of the\r\nbirth of the child, to prove its illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nIn the same country, a child born before marriage is rendered\r\nlegitimate by the subsequent marriage of the parents. This is not the\r\ncase in England.\r\n\r\nA child born during wedlock is legitimate, although the date of\r\nconception may be before marriage. A child born after the death of its\r\nmother is held to be legitimate. A child may, as Taylor remarks, be\r\nconceived before marriage, and born after the death of the mother, and\r\nyet be legitimate, though neither conceived nor born in wedlock.\r\n\r\nThe Code Napoleon prohibits the contraction of a second marriage until\r\nten months after the death of the first husband; and this is also the\r\ncase in Germany. The Anglo-Saxon law prohibits remarriage for twelve\r\nmonths. In Britain no time is fixed by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Duration of Pregnancy.=--The consideration of this subject is of\r\nimportance in its relation to the legitimacy of a child.\r\n\r\nThe natural period of human gestation is usually stated at forty weeks,\r\nten lunar or nine calendar months, or 280 days. In Prussia, the period\r\nis extended to 302 days, and in the Code Napoleon to 300; in Scotland,\r\nten months is held as the limit.\r\n\r\nThe duration of human gestation is subject to considerable variation;\r\nin some females it is always protracted; in others, always premature.\r\nSeveral modes of calculation are adopted by women:\r\n\r\n    1. Ascertained date of impregnation from one coïtus.\r\n    2. Supposed sensations of female at time of conception.\r\n    3. Suppression of the catamenia. This is open to the\r\n       objection, that causes other than that of impregnation\r\n       may arrest them. The catamenia may be stopped by cold or\r\n       other causes for two or three months, and then, before\r\n       their return, pregnancy may occur, thus upsetting all\r\n       calculations. The usual mode of calculation is from two\r\n       weeks after the last menstruation, and the period so fixed\r\n       is corrected by the time at which quickening occurs.\r\n    4. Period of quickening. (_a_) Quickening supposed when pregnancy\r\n       is absent. (_b_) Pregnancy without quickening.\r\n       (_c_) Variations in the time of its occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhichever may be the mode of calculation adopted, it may be stated\r\nthat, as a rule, the period of human gestation is from 275 to 280 days,\r\nand that cases of alleged pregnancy beyond 300 days must be received\r\nwith considerable caution.\r\n\r\nThe pregnancy of the Countess of Gloucester was held, in the reign of\r\nEdward II., to be legitimate, although her husband had been dead one\r\nyear and seven months at the date of the application.\r\n\r\n=Premature Births.=--The question may be asked, At what period of\r\ngestation may a child be born viable--that is, capable of living and\r\nattaining to maturity? Seven months, or 210 days, is considered as the\r\nlimit; but cases have been recorded of children born at six months\r\nbeing reared. The Roman law admitted the legitimacy of seven-months’\r\nchildren. (For the Signs of Immaturity, see “Table of the Development\r\nof the Embryo,” pp. 35, 36.)\r\n\r\n=Superfœtation.=--The term is used to imply the conception of a second\r\nembryo in a woman already pregnant, and the birth of two children at\r\none time, differing considerably in their maturity, or of two births, a\r\nconsiderable period of time elapsing between each. The possibility of\r\nthis occurrence has been doubted.\r\n\r\nChurchill, in his work on Midwifery, writing on this subject says:\r\n“In conclusion, I would say--(1) That the theory of superfœtation is\r\n_unnecessary_ to explain the birth of a mature fœtus and a blighted\r\novum, of a mature and immature fœtus born together or within a month\r\nof each other, or of fœtuses of different colours, as they may\r\nreasonably be supposed to be the product of one act of generation, or\r\nof two nearly contemporaneous. (2) That, in cases of double uterus,\r\nit is possible for a second conception to take place, and--judging\r\nfrom the subsequent birth of the second child in the only case on\r\nrecord--at a later period than the first. (3) That, in the remaining\r\ncases, where one mature child succeeded the birth of another after a\r\nconsiderable interval, we have no proof of a double uterus in any,\r\nand positive proof that in one case it was single; and that to the\r\nexplanation of these cases no theory as yet advanced is adequate, that\r\nof superfœtation being opposed by physical difficulties which are\r\nunsurmountable in the present state of our knowledge.”\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Matthews Duncan has, however, shown that the mouth of the\r\nwomb is not completely closed by conception, and the communication\r\nbetween the vagina and ovary is not destroyed for some months after\r\nimpregnation, and that there is no impediment to the ascent of the\r\nspermatozoa. Galabin[16] records an instance of extra-uterine and\r\nuterine pregnancy occurring at the same time, the extra-uterine fœtus\r\nbeing advanced in development as compared with that in the uterus, and\r\nregards the condition as one of superfœtation.\r\n\r\n[16] _Manual of Midwifery_, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Milne, while admitting this form of pregnancy as possible,\r\nthough very rare, remarks: “This variety we should not think due so\r\nmuch to mechanical hindrances as to the absence of proper ovules. It\r\nwould imply extraordinary vigour were perfect ovulation to be achieved\r\nfor any length of time after impregnation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOTENCE AND STERILITY\r\n\r\nEvidence in relation to the above subjects may be required in actions\r\nfor nullity of marriage, divorce, legitimacy, inheritance, pregnancy,\r\nand criminal assault.\r\n\r\n=Impotence.=--By impotence is meant the incapacity for sexual\r\nintercourse, and applies both to the male and female; but the term is\r\nmore especially used in reference to the former.\r\n\r\n=Sterility.=--Sterility denotes the incapacity for procreation of\r\nchildren; is also applicable to both sexes, but more usually in\r\nreference to the female. A person may be impotent without being\r\nsterile, although the former is usually regarded as implying the\r\nlatter. On the other hand, a person may be sterile without being\r\nimpotent, the former not necessarily denoting the latter. In reference\r\nto nullity of marriage, if natural sexual relations are not and cannot\r\nbe consummated, the marriage will be declared null and void, provided\r\nthat such inability of consummation was unknown to the person bringing\r\nthe action for nullity before marriage. Impotence is sufficient ground\r\nfor bringing an action for nullity, provided it was present at the date\r\nof the marriage, that it is irremediable, and that the person bringing\r\nthe action was not informed of it previously. Should, however, the\r\nmarriage have been consummated and impotence develop later, there will\r\nbe no grounds for such an action.\r\n\r\n=Impotence and Sterility in the Male.=--This may arise from some\r\n_organic defect_ of the organs or _functional disorder_. In reference\r\nto the former there are certain abnormalities of the male organs which\r\nhave to be considered. Monorchids, men in whom one testis is absent\r\nfrom the scrotum, are not necessarily impotent or sterile; nor are\r\ncryptorchids, where both testes are undescended. In many of these\r\ncases spermatozoa are absent from the seminal fluid with consequent\r\nsterility; on the other hand, procreation has taken place, proving that\r\ncryptorchids are not necessarily sterile.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the penis may be the result of want of development, injury,\r\ndisease, or operation. The penis may be present but attached in its\r\nwhole length to the scrotum; this may be remedied by operation.\r\n\r\nEpispadias, so often associated with ectopion vesicæ, as a rule renders\r\nan individual impotent and sterile. On the other hand, hypospadias\r\ndoes not necessarily bar procreation; it will depend largely upon the\r\nposition of the urethral opening, and the possibility of its being\r\nremedied by operation.\r\n\r\nRemoval or destruction of both testes renders a man sterile eventually,\r\nbut not necessarily impotent.\r\n\r\nFunctional disorder due to disease may give rise to impotence,\r\nalthough the organs may remain anatomically perfect. Diseases such as\r\ndiabetes and influenza, neurasthenia, tabes dorsalis, myelitis, mumps,\r\nand orchitis, and injuries to the head may be causative factors in\r\nimpotence.\r\n\r\nThe capacity for sexual intercourse is influenced to a varying degree\r\nby age. Sexual capacity is regarded as coincident with puberty. In\r\njudging the sexual capacity of a youth, age is of less moment than the\r\ndegree of physical development. I have seen a male child of five years\r\nof age with as complete development of the sexual organs as an adult,\r\nand with a deep voice. At the other extreme of life it is impossible to\r\nlay down any definite limit to sexual capacity. Although it is regarded\r\nas diminishing with age, yet there are many instances of procreative\r\npower in men of an advanced age.\r\n\r\nThe principal points for consideration in reference to impotence\r\nand sterility in the male are: (_a_) Does the condition prevent the\r\nsecretion of semen? (_b_) Does it prevent the conveyance of semen to\r\nthe vagina?\r\n\r\n=Impotence and Sterility in the Female.=--As in the male, these may be\r\nassociated with organic defect or functional disorder. The external\r\norgans may be absent, with or without the internal. The vagina may\r\nbe wanting through lack of development, or it may be obstructed by\r\nmal-development or the result of disease. Again, the external organs\r\nmay be present, but the internal absent in whole or part. The hymen\r\nmay be imperforate, or unusually tough. Diseases of the uterus often\r\ngive rise to sterility. Vaginismus, in which attempts at coïtus cause\r\npainful spasm, may prevent intercourse. In reference to functional\r\ndisorders are to be noted extreme debility, constant leucorrhœa,\r\ndysmenorrhœa, menorrhagia, and amenorrhœa, all of which may be\r\nassociated with or causative factors in sterility. Emotional psychical\r\nconditions may prevent sexual intercourse in women. General diseases,\r\nhowever, do not necessarily prevent intercourse, as the woman may\r\nremain a passive agent, neither is bodily deformity always a barrier to\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\nThe advent of sexual capacity in women is regarded as coincident with\r\nthe onset of the menses, about fourteen years of age, but pregnancy has\r\nbeen known to take place prior to the first menstrual period. The age\r\nat which the menses first appear varies in no small degree. It has been\r\nknown to occur during the first year of life, and pregnancy has been\r\nknown to occur as early as the eighth year. The menopause in women is\r\nregarded as coincident with loss of procreative power. Women as a rule\r\ncease to menstruate at forty-five years of age, but in not a few the\r\nfunction persists until fifty, in exceptional cases to a more advanced\r\nage. It is rare for a woman to bear children after the menopause, but\r\nexceptions have been known to take place.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a husband seeking a nullity of marriage on the grounds\r\nof impotence or sterility in his wife, the question at issue is not\r\nwhether she can bear children, but can she permit sexual intercourse?\r\nMany conditions which cause sterility in the woman need not render her\r\nimpotent, and unless the latter obtains a nullity of marriage would not\r\nbe allowed. Further, the conditions which render the woman impotent\r\nmust be permanent and irremediable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVIVORSHIP\r\n\r\nThe question of survivorship is not infrequently raised when a mother\r\nand her new-born infant are found dead, or where several persons\r\nhave perished by a common accident. In the first case the mother is\r\ngenerally presumed to have lived longest; and this presumption may be\r\nborne out by the fact of the delivery being premature, or if there\r\nbe considerable disproportion between the size of the child and the\r\nmaternal passages. As pointed out before, important civil rights may\r\ndepend upon the question as to the live birth of an infant; and the\r\nhusband‘s rights to be _tenant to the courtesy_ will, of course, depend\r\nupon the view taken as to the probable survivorship or not of the child.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second question, much will depend upon the relative\r\nages and strength of the individuals. Sex will also have to be taken\r\ninto consideration. In the case of one or more persons found dead,\r\neither from wounds or other causes, the fact of some being warm and\r\nothers cold, the presence of the _rigor mortis_ in one and absence in\r\nthe other, will point to the probable survivorship. The severity of the\r\nwounds and injuries to large arterial trunks must also be considered.\r\n(See test case, Underwood _v._ Wing, 1 Jur. N.S. 169.) In this case a\r\nman, his wife, and three children were washed overboard and drowned,\r\none child, however, being seen alive a few minutes after the others\r\nwere submerged. The question at issue was, Did the husband survive the\r\nwife, or the wife the husband? and on this Wightman, J., in summing\r\nup, said: “We may guess, or imagine, or fancy, but the law of England\r\nrequires evidence, and we are of opinion that there is no evidence upon\r\nwhich we can give a judicial opinion that either survived the other;\r\nin fact, we think it unlikely that both did die at the same moment of\r\ntime, but there is no evidence to show who was the survivor.” Verdict\r\nfor the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALPRAXIS AND NEGLECT OF DUTY\r\n\r\nA medical man is liable to a civil action for damages who, by a\r\nculpable want of care and attention, or by the absence of a competent\r\ndegree of skill and knowledge, causes injury to a patient. And it is\r\nnot necessary that the patient should have employed or was to have\r\npaid him, provided always that there be no negligence or carelessness\r\non the part of the patient. Lord Chief-Justice Tindall remarks: “Every\r\nperson who enters into a learned profession undertakes to bring to the\r\nexercise of it a reasonably fair and competent degree of skill.” It\r\nhas also been decided that if the defendant acted honestly, and used\r\nhis best skill to cure, and it does not appear that he thrust himself\r\nin the place of a competent person, it makes no difference whether he\r\nwas at the time a regular physician or surgeon or not (R. _v._ Van\r\nButchell; R. _v._ Williamson, &c.). A surgeon does not undertake to\r\nperform a cure, nor does he profess to bring the highest professional\r\nskill into the consideration of the case; but he does undertake to\r\nbring a fair and reasonable amount. The degree of skill required by law\r\nis good common sense, or such knowledge as the operator had, joined\r\nwith a good purpose to help the afflicted, even if such interference\r\nrendered the patient a cripple for life. “It would be dreadful,” says\r\nHullock, B., “if every time an operation was performed an individual\r\nwas liable to have his practice questioned.” “So, if a physician or\r\nsurgeon give his patient a potion or plaster to cure him, which,\r\ncontrary to expectation, kills him, this also is neither murder nor\r\nmanslaughter, but misadventure.” A medical man is only liable for gross\r\nnegligence, not for every slip he may make; but the distinction between\r\ncriminal and actionable negligence cannot be defined; but it appears\r\nthat the negligence must be so gross as to come under the legal meaning\r\nof the word “felonious.” (See p. 82.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFEIGNED DISEASES--MALINGERING\r\n\r\nHuman ingenuity is not wanting among those who, for private ends,\r\npretend to be suffering from disease. The soldier or sailor, anxious to\r\nescape the dangers of active service, finds a ready means of evading\r\nhis duties by shamming; the prisoner, in order to lighten the burden of\r\nhis punishment, does the same. A man declares himself impotent to save\r\nthe expense of keeping an alleged bastard child, or to avoid punishment\r\nfor rape. Beggars appeal to the public by feigning some painful\r\ndisease, and incautious benevolence becomes the dupe of the clever\r\nimpostor.\r\n\r\nAny attempt at classification is here out of the question, nor does\r\nit appear necessary to give a long list of diseases which have been\r\nfeigned, or the means that have been employed by artists in deception.\r\nTo give some general hints for guidance is all that will be attempted\r\nhere, leaving matters of detail to the acumen of the medical examiner,\r\nwho, if in active practice, will have many opportunities of testing his\r\npowers of discernment:\r\n\r\n     1. Never be satisfied with one visit, but pay a second at a\r\n        short interval, and unannounced.\r\n\r\n     2. Have the patient carefully watched in the interval of\r\n        your visits.\r\n\r\n     3. Examine each organ of the body separately, carefully\r\n        comparing the state of each with the symptoms described\r\n        by the patient.\r\n\r\n     4. Note the discrepancies in the statements of the patient\r\n        as to his symptoms and their known occurrence in real\r\n        disease.\r\n\r\n     5. Sometimes ask questions the reverse of his statements,\r\n        or take his statements for granted, when in all\r\n        probability he will contradict himself.\r\n\r\n     6. Remove all bandages and other dressings.\r\n\r\n     7. The administration of sham physic, or the suggestion of\r\n        some heroic mode of treatment; the application of the\r\n        actual cautery may have a beneficial effect.\r\n\r\n     8. Pay little attention to the reports of bystanders, or of\r\n        the culprit‘s fellow-prisoners.\r\n\r\n     9. Anæsthetics may be employed, if necessary, for the\r\n        purpose of detection.\r\n\r\n    10. The motives of deception should be inquired into, and\r\n        borne in mind, in the examination of all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION FROM PUBLIC DUTIES\r\n\r\nThe existence of certain diseases may be claimed as a bar to active\r\nservice, both in a civil and in a military capacity; and the opinion\r\nof a medical man may be required as to the fitness or unfitness of the\r\nindividual for the service from which he claims exemption. In giving\r\ncertificates of this nature, the medical practitioner cannot be too\r\nguarded in wording them; and each case must be treated on its merits,\r\nso that strict justice may be done.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases which may incapacitate a man for active employment\r\nmay be mentioned--syphilis; hernia; phthisis; affections of the eyes,\r\nattended with dimness of vision, or colour blindness; varicose veins;\r\nand some other diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLS\r\n\r\nAlthough a medical man, as a rule, should refuse to draw up a will,\r\nstill there are occasions when his doing so may save much litigation\r\nand expense. The following directions may therefore be of use:\r\n\r\n1. Let the wishes of the testator be expressed in the plainest and\r\nsimplest words, avoiding all expressions that seem to admit of another\r\nmeaning than the one intended.\r\n\r\n2. All alterations in the will should be initialled.\r\n\r\n3. Do not scratch out a word with a knife, and no alteration must be\r\nmade after the will is _executed_.\r\n\r\n4. Two witnesses are necessary, who must both be present and sign the\r\nfollowing attestation at the end of the will, or on each sheet if more\r\nthan one sheet of paper be used: “Signed by the testator (or testatrix,\r\nas the case may be) in the joint presence of us, who thereupon signed\r\nour names in his (or her) and each other‘s presence.”\r\n\r\n5. Add address of witnesses.\r\n\r\n6. A clause appointing an executor should be inserted thus: “And I\r\nappoint J. B. executor of this my will.”\r\n\r\n7. Begin, “This is the last will of me, W. B. of S.”; and end, “and I\r\nrevoke all former wills and codicils.” Dated this ___________ day of\r\n______________ one thousand, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMENTAL UNSOUNDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the whole range of medical jurisprudence there is no subject more\r\ninteresting, more difficult, or more important than the diagnosis\r\nof insanity, and its relation to the criminal responsibility of\r\nindividuals. It is impossible, in the short space at our disposal, to\r\ndo more than to offer a few remarks which may assist the student in the\r\nelucidation of some of the most important cases which may engage his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n=Legal Definitions.=--Three forms of mental disorder are recognised in\r\nlaw:\r\n\r\n    1. _A nativitate, vel dementia naturalis_--idiocy or imbecility.\r\n\r\n    2. _Dementia accidentalis, vel adventitia_--acquired general\r\n        insanity, either temporary or permanent, lunacy.\r\n\r\n    3. _Dementia affectata_, acquired madness from intoxication, &c.\r\n        (See “Delirium Tremens,” p. 205.)\r\n\r\nUnder the term lunacy are included the mania, monomania, and dementia\r\nof medical writers. Another term frequently used in legal proceedings,\r\nthe meaning of which it is not easy to give, is “_non compos mentis_,”\r\n_unsoundness of mind_. According to the late Forbes Winslow,\r\n“unsoundness of mind is not lunacy” in the legal acceptance of the\r\nphrase. This term was first used in a Statute passed in the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., relating to the punishment of treasonable offences, and\r\nis defined by the early law text-books to be strictly one who _gaudet\r\nlucidis intervallis_--a definition not psychologically exact. The\r\nphrase “unsoundness of mind” was first used by the late Lord Eldon to\r\ndesignate a state of mind not exactly idiotic, and not lunatic with\r\ndelusions, but a condition of intellect occupying a place between the\r\ntwo extremes, and unfitting the person for the government of himself\r\nand the management of his affairs.\r\n\r\nThe above definition has been acted upon by other judges--Lyndhurst,\r\nBrougham, &c. As a rule, a medical witness will consult his own\r\ninterest in not attempting to define insanity, bearing in mind the\r\nphilosophic caution of Polonius, who, when addressing Hamlet‘s mother,\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n                     “Your noble son is mad:\r\n    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,\r\n    What is‘t but to be nothing else but mad?”\r\nTo the legal mind, the chief character of insanity is the presence of\r\n_delusion_; but this view is far too restricted. It was first advanced\r\nby Erskine in the trial of Hadfield. Before that trial the doctrine\r\nwas that every man was responsible for his acts, unless he was totally\r\ndeprived of his understanding and memory, and did not know what he was\r\ndoing, “no more than an infant, than a brute, or a wild beast” (R.\r\n_v._ Arnold). In the case of Bellingham, the knowledge of “right” and\r\n“wrong” in the abstract was the test of mental unsoundness; and, as in\r\nthe opinion of the judge and jury he was held to be capable of solving\r\nthis metaphysical problem, Bellingham was duly hanged.\r\n\r\nSince the trial and acquittal of MacNaughton on the ground of insanity,\r\nthe doctrine of the knowledge of abstract right and wrong has been\r\nchanged to a knowledge of right and wrong in relation to the particular\r\nact of which the person is accused, and also at the time of committing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt has also been held that, on the assumption that a person labours\r\nunder partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, he\r\nmust be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if\r\nthe facts, with respect to which the delusion exists, were real. For\r\nexample, if, under the influence of delusion, he supposes another man\r\nto be in the act of attempting to take his life, and he kills that man,\r\nas he supposes, in self-defence, he would be exempt from punishment.\r\nIf his delusion were that the deceased had inflicted a serious injury\r\non his character and fortune, and he killed him in revenge for such\r\nsupposed injury, he would be liable to punishment. “Here,” says\r\nMaudsley, “is an unhesitating assumption that a man, having an insane\r\ndelusion, has the power to think and act in regard to it _reasonably_,\r\n... that he is, in fact, bound to be reasonable in his unreason, sane\r\nin his insanity.” Yet this was the doctrine laid down by the judges\r\nin answer to certain questions propounded by the House of Lords after\r\nthe acquittal of MacNaughton (see Maudsley‘s _Responsibility in Mental\r\nDisease_, pp. 88 _et seq._).\r\n\r\nAs laid down by English lawyers, madness absolves from all guilt in\r\ncriminal cases. Where the deprivation of the understanding and memory\r\nis total, fixed, and permanent, it excuses all acts; so, likewise,\r\na man labouring under adventitious insanity is, during the frenzy,\r\nentitled to the same indulgence, in the same degree, as one whose\r\ndisorder is fixed and permanent (Beverley‘s Case, Co. 125, Co. Litt.\r\n247, 1 Hale 31). “But the difficulty in these cases is to distinguish\r\nbetween a total aberration of intellect and a partial or temporary\r\ndelusion merely, notwithstanding which the patient may be capable of\r\ndiscerning right from wrong; in which case he will be guilty in the eye\r\nof the law, and amenable to punishment.”[17]\r\n\r\n[17] Archbold‘s _Criminal Cases_.\r\n\r\nLord Hale, who first pointed out the distinction to be drawn between\r\ntotal and partial insanity, offered the following as the best test\r\nhe could suggest: “Such a person, as labouring under melancholy\r\ndistempers, hath yet as great understanding as ordinarily a child of\r\nfourteen years hath, is such a person as can be guilty of felony.” (On\r\nthis subject, see R. _v_. Ld. Ferrers, 19 St. Tr. 333; R. _v_. Arnold,\r\n16 St. Tr. 764, &c.)\r\n\r\nTo excuse a man from punishment on the ground of insanity, it\r\nappears that it must be distinctly proved that he was not capable of\r\ndistinguishing right from wrong, and that he did not know, at the time\r\nof committing the crime, that the offence was against the laws of _God_\r\nand _nature_ (R. _v_. Offord, 5 C. & P. 186).\r\n\r\nI shall here quote from Macdonald‘s _Criminal Law of Scotland_:\r\n“Insanity or idiocy exempts from prosecution. But there must be an\r\nalienation of reason such as misleads the judgment, so that the person\r\ndoes not know ‘the nature of the quality of the act’ he is doing, or if\r\nhe does know it, that he does not know he is doing what is wrong. If\r\nthere be this alienation, as connected with the act committed, he is\r\nnot liable to punishment, though his conduct may be otherwise rational.\r\nFor example, if he kill another when under an insane delusion as to\r\nthe conduct and character of the person--_e.g._ believing that he is\r\nabout to murder him, or is an evil spirit,--then it matters not that he\r\nhas a general notion of right and wrong. For, in such a case, ‘as well\r\nmight he be utterly ignorant of the quality of murder.’ He does the\r\ndeed, knowing murder to be wrong, but his delusion makes him believe he\r\nis acting in self-defence, or against a spirit. Nor does it alter the\r\neffect of the fact of insanity at the time, that the person afterwards\r\nrecovers.... But the alienation of reason must be substantial. Oddness\r\nor eccentricity, however marked, or even weakness of mind, will not\r\navail as a defence. Even monomania may be insufficient as a defence,\r\nwhere the delusion and the crime committed have no connection, or where\r\nthe person, though having delusions, was yet aware that what he did was\r\nillegal.”\r\n\r\nMere moral insanity--where the intellectual faculties are sound, and\r\nthe person knows what he is doing, and that he is doing wrong, but has\r\nno control over himself, and acts under an uncontrollable impulse--does\r\nnot render him irresponsible (R. _v_. Burton, 3 F. & F. 772). Some\r\nmedical writers contend that there are two forms of insanity--moral and\r\nintellectual. The law only recognises the latter, owing probably to\r\nthe difficulty of distinguishing between so-called moral insanity and\r\nmoral depravity. Taylor says: “Further, until medical men can produce\r\na clear and well-defined distinction between moral depravity and moral\r\ninsanity, such a doctrine, employed as it has been for the exculpation\r\nof persons charged with crime, should be rejected as inadmissible.”\r\n\r\nThe day may not be far distant when the term “moral depravity” will\r\nbe unknown, and future generations, ceasing to believe in absurd\r\nsuperstitions, will come to look on crime as the result of disease\r\nof the brain, and learn to treat, instead of to punish, the morally\r\ndiseased. (For a full discussion of this subject the reader is referred\r\nto the works of Dr. Henry Maudsley.)\r\n\r\nThe fact of the sanity or insanity of the prisoner at the time the\r\ncrime was committed is left to the jury to decide, guided by the\r\nprevious and contemporaneous acts of the party; and it has been laid\r\ndown by Lord Moncreiff in Scotland, and Lord Westbury in England,\r\nthat the mental soundness or unsoundness of any individual is to be\r\ndecided by the jury on the ordinary rules of every-day life, and that\r\non these principles they are as good judges as medical men. The whole\r\ntendency of legal practice, when dealing with the plea of insanity, is\r\nto entirely ignore the medical evidence. On the question of medical\r\nevidence in cases of insanity, Doe J., of New Hampshire, remarks: “At\r\npresent, precedents require the jury to be instructed by experts in\r\nnew medical theories, and by judges in old medical theories,” and that\r\nin this “the legal profession were invading the province of medicine,\r\nand attempting to install old exploded medical theories in the place\r\nof facts established in the progress of scientific knowledge. If the\r\ntests of insanity are matters of law, the practice of allowing experts\r\nto testify what they are should be discontinued; if they are matters\r\nof fact, the judge should no longer testify without being sworn as a\r\nwitness, and showing himself qualified to testify as an expert.”\r\n\r\n=Lunacy--What Constitutes?= (8 and 9 Vict. c. 100, secs. 90 and\r\n114).--Imbecility and loss of mental power, whether arising from\r\nnatural decay, or from paralysis, softening of the brain, or other\r\nnatural cause, and although unaccompanied with frenzy or delusion of\r\nany kind, constitute unsoundness of mind, amounting to lunacy within\r\nthe meaning of 8 and 9 Vict. c. 100 (R. _v_. Shaw, 1 C.C. 145).\r\n\r\nThe above is the last definition of lunacy up to 1875; but as the law\r\non this subject is so constantly changing, the student will find it\r\nbest to consult the _Law Reports_ from time to time. (See the account\r\nin the case of R. _v_. Treadaway, _Law Reports_. Also the _Lancet_, on\r\nthe same case, vol. i. 1877.)\r\n\r\nFor some valuable remarks on the subject of the irresponsibility of\r\nmadmen, the student is referred to the works of Maudsley, Pritchard,\r\nRay, Hoffbauer, Georget, and others.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions are offered for consideration on this subject:\r\n\r\n1. Was the act an isolated event in the life of the culprit? Has it the\r\nappearance of spontaneity, or was it the culminating point of a life\r\nspent in so-called criminal acts?\r\n\r\n2. _Absence of a motive for the committal of the deed._--The absence\r\nof an _apparent_ motive is no proof of an unsound mind; the moving\r\nprinciple may be _“the conscious impulse to the illegal gratification\r\nof a selfish desire_.”\r\n\r\n3. _The presence or absence of a well-concerted plan of action is\r\na diagnostic sign of little value._--Casper remarks that “only in\r\none case can the examination of the systematic planning of the deed\r\nafford any information, and that is when these plans and preparations\r\nthemselves evince the stamp of a confused intellect, and betray the\r\nhazy consciousness, the mental darkness, in which the culprit was\r\ninvolved.”\r\n\r\n4. _A dominant delusion may be so concealed as to be for a time\r\nundiscoverable._--The case of the man who gave no indication of his\r\nmadness till he was asked to sign the order for his release, when\r\nhe signed _Christ_, is an example how carefully a delusion may be\r\nconcealed even during a most careful examination. Questions directed to\r\nthis point showed that he laboured under all the errors which such a\r\ndelusion might suggest.\r\n\r\n5. It may “easily be conceived that insane persons, whose unreason\r\naffects only one train of thought more or less restricted, yet labour\r\nin other respects under disorders of feeling which influence their\r\nconduct and their actions and behaviour without materially affecting\r\ntheir judgment: and that many of such deranged persons, who often\r\nconduct themselves tolerably well in a lunatic asylum, and while living\r\namong strangers with whom they have no relations, and against whom\r\nthey have no prejudices or imaginary reason of complaint; subjected,\r\nbesides, to the rules of the house and to an authority that nobody\r\nattempts to dispute; would, nevertheless, if restored to liberty\r\nand residing in the midst of their families, become insupportable,\r\nirritable at the slightest contradiction, abusive, impatient of the\r\nleast remark on their conduct, and liable to be provoked by trifles to\r\nthe most dangerous acts of violence. If, under such circumstances, a\r\nlunatic should commit any act of injury or serious damage to another,\r\nwould it be just to punish him; because it cannot be made apparent that\r\nthe action has any reference to, or connection with, the principal\r\ndelusion which is known to cloud his judgment, it being apparent that\r\nhis moral faculties have undergone a total morbid perversion?”\r\n\r\n6. _Insanity with Lucid Intervals._--Haslam, Ray, and others appear\r\nto deny the possibility of lucid intervals; but M. Esquirol, on the\r\nother hand, fully recognises the existence of this form of insanity.\r\nIn a legal sense, a temporary cessation of the insanity constitutes\r\na lucid interval, but the cessation must be complete, and not merely\r\na remission of the symptoms. The interval must be of some duration;\r\nand when continuous insanity has been proved, the onus of proving a\r\nlucid interval in civil cases rests with the party trying to support\r\nthe validity of a deed executed during the alleged interval. “If\r\nyou can establish,” says Sir W. Wynne, “that the party afflicted\r\nhabitually by a malady of the mind has intermissions, and if there was\r\nan intermission of the disorder at the time of the act, that being\r\nproved is sufficient, and the general habitual insanity will not affect\r\nit, but the effect of it is this--it inverts the order of proof and\r\npresumption; for, until proof of habitual insanity, the presumption\r\nis that the party agent, like all human creatures, was rational; but\r\nwhen an habitual insanity in the mind of the person who does the act is\r\nestablished, then the party who would take advantage of the fact of an\r\ninterval of reason must prove it.” In civil cases the law recognises\r\nthe validity of wills made during lucid intervals, and has even taken\r\nthe reasonableness of a will as a proof of a lucid interval.\r\n\r\n7. Have measures been taken by the culprit to escape punishment?\r\n\r\nThe classification of insanity adopted here is that given by Ray, and\r\nis sufficient for all practical purposes:\r\n\r\n                                             { 1.

Idiocy commences with life, or at an age which precedes\r\nthe development of the intellectual and affective faculties, which\r\nare from the first what they are doomed to be during the whole period\r\nof existence. Since the days of Esquirol, much improvement has been\r\nmade in the care and treatment of the idiot; and it appears that he is\r\ncapable of some, though in most cases slight, mental culture. The cases\r\nin which improvement takes place probably belong to imbecility, leaving\r\nthe _idiot_ in the same condition as described by Esquirol.\r\n\r\n=Cretinism= differs from idiocy in being endemic; it is also more\r\ncurable, or at least more susceptible of improvement, than the latter.\r\nIn the idiot the malady is congenital; the cretin, on the other hand,\r\nmay to all appearances be free from disease for a time. “Every cretin\r\nis an idiot, but every idiot is not a cretin; idiocy is the more\r\ncomprehensive term, cretinism is a special kind of it.” The enlarged\r\nthyroid gland, high-arched palate, and brown or yellow colour of the\r\nskin, are characteristic of the cretin. Local causes are at work in the\r\nproduction of cretinism; _e.g._ defective function of the thyroid gland.\r\n\r\nThe idiot is usually cunning, mischievous, and dirty in his habits.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word idiot, from the Greek, ἰδιώτης --_a private\r\nperson_, or _an ill-informed ordinary fellow_--is peculiar. A person\r\nsuffering from any form of mental unsoundness, and thereby rendered\r\nincapable of taking care of himself or of his property, was formerly\r\ncalled by English law “an idiot,” and this word was not infrequently\r\njoined with “fatuus” in old writs.\r\n\r\n=Imbecility.=--This is a minor form of idiocy, and may or may not be\r\ncongenital. It admits of considerable degrees of intensity. Imbeciles\r\nexhibit mental defection, rendering them incapable of managing\r\nthemselves or their affairs, and imbecile children are incapable of\r\nbeing taught to do so.\r\n\r\n=Feeble-mindedness= is a lesser degree of mental defection than\r\nimbecility. It may exist from birth or an early age. Such persons\r\nrequire care and control for the protection of themselves and others.\r\nThey may be incapacitated from acquiring the knowledge imparted in\r\nordinary schools.\r\n\r\n=Moral imbeciles= exhibit moral defects which render them vicious in\r\nbehaviour, and they often exhibit criminal tendencies, which are not\r\naffected by punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF MENTALLY DEFECTIVE PERSONS\r\n\r\nThe Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 provides for their care. Such a\r\nperson may be either sent to an institution or placed under special\r\nguardianship by the parent or guardian, if an idiot or imbecile;\r\nor by the parent when, though not an idiot or imbecile, the person\r\naffected be under the age of twenty-one years. If in addition to being\r\na defective, the person is neglected, abandoned, or without means of\r\nsupport; or cruelly treated, guilty of a criminal offence, or liable to\r\nbe sent to an industrial school, or under imprisonment, detained in an\r\nindustrial school, inebriate reformatory, or institution for lunatics,\r\nor habitual drunkard within the meaning of the Inebriates Act; or\r\nin whose case proper notice has been given by the Local Education\r\nAuthority; or who is in receipt of relief at the time of giving birth\r\nto an illegitimate child, or pregnant of such child.\r\n\r\n=Certificates required.=--In the case of a parent or guardian who\r\ndesires to place a mentally defective person under guardianship, _two\r\nmedical certificates_ are necessary, one of which must be from a\r\nmedical man approved by the Local Authority or Board. If the person be\r\nnot an idiot or imbecile, the certificates must be signed by a Judicial\r\nAuthority, after such inquiry as he thinks fit. A defective to be\r\ndealt with otherwise than by parent or guardian, is so under an order\r\nby a _Judicial Authority_ on a petition presented under the Act, an\r\norder of a _Court_ if guilty of a criminal offence, or an order of the\r\nSecretary of State if detained in prison, a criminal lunatic asylum, or\r\nreformatory.\r\n\r\nThe order of a Judicial Authority may be obtained by petition of any\r\nrelative or friend, or an officer of the Local Authority authorised\r\nunder the Act for the purpose. Two medical certificates must accompany\r\nthe petitions, one of which must be signed by a medical man approved\r\nby the Local Authority or Board; or, when a medical examination cannot\r\nbe carried out, a certificate to that effect must be presented, and\r\na statutory declaration made by the petitioner and one other person,\r\nwho may be one of the medical certifiers, stating the class to which\r\nthe defective belongs. Upon receiving the certificates the Judicial\r\nAuthority interviews the defective. When the petition is presented by\r\na parent or guardian, the Judicial Authority, if satisfied, may issue\r\nan order for the defective to be placed in an institution or appoint\r\na guardian. If the petitioner be not parent or guardian, consent in\r\nwriting of one or other must be obtained, without which the order must\r\nnot be made, unless the parent or guardian withhold their consent\r\nunreasonably or are not to be found. If the Judicial Authority be not\r\nsatisfied, he may postpone the order, or refuse it.\r\n\r\nWhen the order is made by a Court, the Court must be satisfied, on\r\nmedical evidence, that the person is a defective.\r\n\r\nTwo medical certificates are necessary when the Secretary of State\r\nmakes an order.\r\n\r\nThe order remains in force for a year, may be renewed for a second\r\nyear, and then for periods of five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF INSANITY\r\n\r\nThe onset of insanity may be gradual or sudden. More commonly the onset\r\nis gradual, and manifested by alterations of emotion and conduct, which\r\nmay for a considerable period precede any impairment of intelligence.\r\nPeriods of depression may alternate with periods of excitement.\r\nIrritability and instability of temper manifest themselves, and lead\r\nrelatives and friends to become suspicious of the change that is the\r\nherald of serious mental impairment. Lack of interest in environment,\r\nbusiness, or the usual pleasurable pursuits, also a tendency to\r\npersonal seclusion manifest themselves, and changeability of the\r\naffections, more often to those nearly related, are not uncommon.\r\nSooner or later the capacity to conduct business and allied pursuits\r\nbecomes enfeebled, and the power of judgment lessened; depression\r\nbegets apprehension and a dread of impending ruin in this world or\r\nin the world to come. Marked indecision and vacillation of action is\r\nquite common. Delusions follow, mostly of persecution, in the form of\r\nattempts to cause ruin or poisoning. Delusions associated with the\r\nspecial senses are common, particularly of hearing, supposed voices\r\nurging the committal of certain actions, or expressive of derision; of\r\nvision, by which objects are seen which are non-existent; of taste,\r\nimparting the idea of poisoning; of touch and pain, invoking peculiar\r\nsensations; of smell, conveying the idea that food, the body, &c.,\r\nexhale disgusting odours.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the onset of insanity, and remaining permanently,\r\nare three special distortions of perceptions--viz. _illusions_,\r\n_hallucinations_, and _delusions_. So long as the first two can be\r\nreasoned upon and rejected, judgment remains. At one or other time\r\nthe afflicted person becomes so affected by them that they become\r\nrealities, and are accepted as true and existent; then the judgment is\r\nperverted, and the person is said to suffer from a delusion.\r\n\r\n_Illusions._--An illusion is a false perception, a perversion of\r\nthe senses, a mockery, false show, counterfeit appearance. The false\r\nperception is, however, invoked by some external appearance.\r\n\r\n_Hallucinations._--Hallucinations are perverted sensations and\r\nperceptions, for the production of which no external impulse is\r\npresent. The person may complain of seeing horrible reptiles around,\r\nwhich are not present. So long as the reasoning faculties are capable\r\nof dispelling the alleged reality of the hallucination and rejecting\r\nit, it remains but an hallucination.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it becomes accepted as a reality and the person becomes\r\nobsessed thereby, it becomes a delusion.\r\n\r\n_Delusions._--A delusion is a chimerical thought, an affection of the\r\nmind. It implies a disordered intellect. Delusions generally concern\r\nthe insane person, his power, soul, &c. A delusion is a perverted\r\nidea of the mind in which there is belief in non-existent things or\r\noccurrences. Delusions may be based upon previous hallucinations, or\r\narise out of erroneous conceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANIA\r\n\r\n=Mania= is the result of a morbid condition of the brain, and to\r\nexpress which “the term raving madness may be used with propriety,\r\nas an English synonym for mania. All maniacs display this symptom\r\noccasionally, if not constantly, and in greater or less degree.” Like\r\nother diseases, mania observes the same pathological laws. There is a\r\nperiod of incubation, during which the true state of the patient is in\r\nmost cases misunderstood, or not appreciated. Mental exaltation may\r\nexist from the first onset of the disease, or the attack may be ushered\r\nin by a stage of gloom or despondency. The general health shows signs\r\nof impairment, the liver becoming sluggish, and the bowels confined or\r\nrelaxed. In some cases a febrile condition of the system is among the\r\npremonitory symptoms of an attack of mania. The physical health is not\r\nusually much affected during the paroxysm.\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly remarks that “even acute mania is not always accompanied\r\nby the ordinary external signs of excitement. It would seem as if we\r\nhad yet to learn the real symptoms of cerebral irritation. Certainly,\r\nin recent cases of mania--cases which have lasted more than six weeks,\r\nand in young persons in whom I have seen the maniacal attack pass\r\ninto dementia--I have known the most acute paroxysms of mania exist,\r\nrapid and violent talking, continual motion, inability to recognise\r\nsurrounding persons and objects, a disposition to tear and destroy\r\nclothes and bedding, without any heat of the scalp or of the surface,\r\nwithout either flushing or paleness of the face, with a clean and\r\nnatural appearance of the tongue, and a pulse no more than eighty or\r\neighty-five.”\r\n\r\nThis may occur in some cases, but in the majority there is always some\r\namount of physical derangement; the system, however, gradually becoming\r\ntolerant of the undue excitement to which it is subjected.\r\n\r\nFollowing the classification adopted, Intellectual Mania will now be\r\nbriefly considered under its two divisions--_General_ and _Partial_.\r\n\r\n=General Intellectual Mania.=--By many medical writers general\r\nintellectual mania is divided into mania and melancholia. The mind\r\nin the former type of the disease is involved in the most chaotic\r\nconfusion possible, and there is also considerable bodily derangement.\r\nThe moral faculties become more or less affected, and the patient‘s\r\nsocial and domestic relations are greatly altered. At one time he\r\nis subject to violent fits of immoderate laughter, at another he is\r\ngloomy and taciturn; sometimes quiet and tractable, at others wild\r\nand excited, necessitating close confinement. He is haunted by wild\r\ndelusions, which at times take entire possession of him, and under\r\nthe influence of which he acts in the most extraordinary manner. In\r\nthe latter--melancholia, or mania with depression--delusion may be\r\nabsent, or, rather, for a time undetectable. The sufferer is gloomy,\r\nand troubled with unhappy thoughts, which sometimes lead him to\r\nself-destruction. He is sleepless, and rejects his food as unnecessary.\r\nHe may be aroused for a short time by questions addressed to him,\r\nhis replies to which are usually given correctly, most frequently in\r\nmonosyllables; but the moment his questioner leaves him he relapses\r\ninto his former gloomy state.\r\n\r\n=Partial Intellectual Mania.=--The term _monomania_, first suggested\r\nby Esquirol, is now generally given to this variety of insanity. The\r\npatient, in the simplest form of this disorder, becomes possessed of\r\nsome single notion, which is alike contradictory to common sense and\r\nto his own experience. Thus, he may fancy himself made of glass; and\r\ninfluenced by this idea, he walks with care, and in dread of being\r\nbroken by contact with other bodies. In the case of an inmate at\r\nthe City of London Asylum, the presence of a weasel in the stomach\r\nwas stated by one woman. Esquirol mentions the case of a woman with\r\nhydatids in her womb, who believed that she was pregnant with the\r\ndevil. Most of these strange fancies appear to be dependent on errors\r\nof sensation.\r\n\r\nMonomaniacs are ready enough to declare their predominant idea; yet\r\nat times, and that without the occurrence of a lucid interval, they\r\nwill as carefully conceal it. “In the simplest form of monomania, the\r\nunderstanding appears to be, and probably is, perfectly sound on all\r\nsubjects but those connected with the hallucination. When, however, the\r\ndisorder is more complicated, involving a longer train of morbid ideas,\r\nwe have the high authority of Georget for believing that, though the\r\npatient may reason on many subjects unconnected with the particular\r\nillusion on which the insanity turns, the understanding is more\r\nextensively deranged than is generally suspected.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL MANIA\r\n\r\nPinel first drew attention to this form of madness. Pritchard defines\r\nit as “consisting in a morbid perversion of the natural feelings,\r\naffections, inclinations, temper, habits, and moral dispositions,\r\nwithout any notable lesion of the intellect or knowing and reasoning\r\nfaculties, and particularly without any maniacal hallucinations.”\r\n\r\nIt is divided into--_General_ Moral Mania. _Partial_ Moral Mania.\r\n\r\n=General Moral Mania.=--“There are many individuals,” says Pritchard,\r\n“living at large, and not entirely separated from society, who are\r\naffected in a certain degree with this modification of insanity. They\r\nare reputed persons of a singular, wayward, and eccentric character. An\r\nattentive observer will often recognise something remarkable in their\r\nmanners and habits, which may lead him to entertain doubts as to their\r\nentire sanity; while circumstances are sometimes discovered on inquiry\r\nwhich add strength to this suspicion. In many instances it has been\r\nfound that a hereditary tendency to madness has existed in the family,\r\nor that several relatives of the person affected have laboured under\r\nother diseases of the brain. The individual himself has been discovered\r\nto have suffered, in a former period of life, an attack of madness\r\nof a decided character. His temper and disposition are found to have\r\nundergone a change, or to be not what they were previously to a certain\r\ntime; he has become an altered man, and the difference has perhaps\r\nbeen noted from the period when he sustained some reverse of fortune\r\nwhich deeply affected him, or the loss of some beloved relative. In\r\nother instances, an alteration in the character of the individual has\r\nensued immediately on some severe shock which his bodily constitution\r\nhas undergone. This has been either a disorder affecting the head, a\r\nslight attack of paralysis, or some febrile or inflammatory complaint,\r\nwhich has produced a perceptible change in the habitual state of his\r\nconstitution. In some cases, the alteration in temper and habits has\r\nbeen gradual and imperceptible; and it seems only to have consisted in\r\nan exaltation and increase of peculiarities which were always more or\r\nless natural and habitual. Persons labouring under this disorder are\r\ncapable of reasoning, or supporting an argument upon any subject within\r\ntheir sphere of knowledge that may be presented to them; and they often\r\ndisplay great ingenuity in giving reasons for the eccentricities of\r\ntheir conduct, and in accounting for, and justifying, the state of\r\nmoral feeling under which they appear to exist. In one sense, indeed,\r\ntheir intellectual faculties may be termed unsound--they think and act\r\nunder the influence of strongly excited feelings; and persons accounted\r\nsane are, under such circumstances, proverbially liable to error,\r\nboth in judgment and conduct.” (For interesting cases of this form of\r\nmadness, see Ray‘s _Jurisprudence of Insanity_.)\r\n\r\n=Partial Moral Mania.=--In the case of the unfortunate sufferers from\r\nthis malady, one or two only of the moral powers are perverted.\r\n\r\nThis division admits of several subdivisions:--\r\n\r\n_Kleptomania._--A marked propensity to theft. “There are persons,”\r\nsays Rush, “who are moral to the highest degree as to certain duties,\r\nbut who, nevertheless, lie under the influence of some vice. In one\r\ninstance, a woman was exemplary in her obedience to every command of\r\nthe moral law except one--she could not refrain from stealing. What\r\nmade this vice more remarkable was, that she was in easy circumstances,\r\nand not addicted to extravagance in anything. Such was the propensity\r\nto this vice that, when she could lay her hands on nothing more\r\nvaluable, she would often, at the table of a friend, fill her pockets\r\nsecretly with bread. She both confessed and lamented her crime.”\r\n\r\n_Pyromania._--This consists in an insane impulse to set fire to\r\neverything--houses, churches, and property of every kind and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Erotomania and Nymphomania._--This is known as amorous madness,\r\nand consists in an inordinate and uncontrollable desire for sexual\r\nintercourse. The unfortunate victims of this disease often express the\r\ngreatest disgust and repugnance for their conduct.\r\n\r\n_Homicidal Mania_--In this form of madness the propensity to homicide\r\nis very great, and in most cases uncontrollable. In the case of the\r\nnotorious Deeming, hanged in Australia in 1892 for the murder of his\r\nwife, an appeal was made from the finding of the Colonial Court by\r\nwhich he was tried to the Privy Council, on the ground of his being\r\naffected with homicidal mania. The plea was not sustained. (See the\r\ncase of Henrietta Cornier, given by Pritchard, Ray, and others.)\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions may be of assistance in forming a diagnosis\r\nas to the existence or non-existence of this form of madness:--\r\n\r\n    1. Previous history of the individual.--_Melancholy,\r\n       eccentric, morose, &c._\r\n\r\n    2. Absence of motive.--_Gain, jealousy, revenge, hatred, &c._\r\n\r\n    3. A number of victims are often sacrificed at one\r\n       time.--_The murderer, on the other hand, seldom sheds\r\n       more blood than is necessary for his success._\r\n\r\n    4. Proceedings of the murderer before and after the\r\n       crime.--_Absence of attempts at concealment or escape\r\n       on the part of the madman._\r\n\r\n    5. Character of the victims.--_Not infrequently, in the\r\n       case of madmen, their victims are those whom, when sane,\r\n       they loved most, and to whom they were most attached._\r\n\r\n_Suicidal Monomania, or the Propensity to Suicide._--Much discussion\r\nhas arisen on this subject. Suicide is not always the result of\r\nunsoundness of mind. Some, like M. Esquirol, are inclined to consider\r\nsuicide as always a manifestation of insanity. In the present day, the\r\ndislike of coroners‘ juries to bring in any other verdict but that of\r\n“suicide whilst in a state of unsound mind” is proverbial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHOLIA\r\n\r\nThis condition is associated with mental depression and delusions.\r\nIn its simple form, marked depression of spirits, apprehension of\r\nevil, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and impaired alimentation with\r\nconstipation are evident.\r\n\r\nDelusions of ruin, of the committal of acts contrary to the laws of\r\nGod and man--“_the unpardonable sin_”--a marked inaptitude to carry on\r\nthe ordinary duties of life, indecision, and often unutterable misery,\r\nare commonly exhibited. The delusions are fixed and may be multiple.\r\nThey may comprise persecution, by friends or others; that things are\r\nhappening which powerfully influence the person‘s life and body, or,\r\nas is often the case, concern religious matters, and everlasting\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nSuicidal tendencies are often present, and depend largely upon the\r\nmisery associated with the condition. Melancholics often conceal this\r\ntendency, or may exhibit it in varied ways so as to hide the method\r\nwhich has been definitely decided upon. Thus a person so afflicted may\r\nbe found in possession of poison at one time, a pistol at another, a\r\nknife at another, when the real intention is that of drowning. Thus\r\nit is necessary to keep an extremely careful watch on melancholics.\r\nHomicidal tendencies are not common. In some cases the melancholia is\r\ncombined with _marked agitation._ The face depicts misery, the eyebrows\r\nraised, and the person moves about incessantly, picking up objects and\r\nreplacing them, moaning and uttering the same phrases expressive of\r\nmisery and hopelessness, wringing the hands, and rocking the body to\r\nand fro.\r\n\r\nIn other cases _stupor_ is predominant, and the person sits in silence\r\nand in the same attitude. Some resent interference, others are easily\r\npersuaded by their attendants to do certain acts, but when done relapse\r\nagain into stupor. They manifest extreme apathy. Suicidal tendencies\r\nare a pronounced feature of such cases.\r\n\r\nMelancholia and mania may alternate periodically, with lucid intervals\r\nintervening. The term _circular insanity_ has been applied to this\r\nalternate character of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMENTIA OR FATUITY\r\n\r\n=Dementia= consists in a failure of the mental faculties, not\r\ncongenital, but coming on during life. “A man,” says Esquirol, “in a\r\nstate of dementia is deprived of advantages which he formerly enjoyed.\r\nHe was a rich man who has become poor. The idiot, on the contrary,\r\nhas always been in a state of want and misery.” In this state there\r\nis always more or less coherence, and maniacal paroxysms are not\r\ninfrequent. In mania, incoherence may be present, but then it is\r\ncharacterised by sustained and violent excitement. In dementia, on\r\nthe other hand, there is apparent torpor and exhaustion of the mental\r\nfaculties. Closely allied to this form of mental unsoundness is that\r\ninteresting disease known as “=general paralysis of the insane=,” or\r\nperhaps a better term, _progressive paralysis of the insane._ It is\r\nconsidered by some to precede the psychical derangement, a contrary\r\nopinion being held by others. General paralysis may accompany any of\r\nthe forms of mental derangement, but it is generally preceded by a\r\nstage of melancholy. As the paralytic affection becomes more marked,\r\nthere is a concurrent loss of memory and incapability of mental\r\nassociation, and all sense of duty is lost; the patient becomes\r\ncareless as to his person, and dirty in his habits. He expresses\r\nhimself as possessed of great property, and boasts of the wonderful\r\ndeeds that he can or has accomplished. Gradually he sinks into a state\r\nof complete mental and physical decay. He cannot give expression to\r\nhis thoughts, and has to be fed, the food being pushed into his mouth.\r\nThe symptom which first attracts the attention, and which is perhaps\r\nthe first order of sequence, is a modification in the articulation.\r\n“This is neither stammering nor hesitation of speech. It more closely\r\nresembles the thickness of speech observable in a drunken man. It\r\ndepends upon loss of power over the co-ordinate action of the muscles\r\nof vocal articulation.” If the tongue be now examined, it will be\r\nfound that when it is protruded it is not inclined to one side, but\r\nthat it is tremulous, and is protruded and withdrawn in a convulsive\r\nmanner. Griesinger was the first to call attention to the fact, and his\r\nstatement has since been confirmed, “that this motory disorder is at\r\nthe commencement not so much paralytic as convulsive in its nature.”\r\nThe gait becomes unsteady, the patient walks stiffly, and stumbles\r\nover the slightest unevenness in the floor. Step by step the paralysis\r\nprogresses, till at last the unfortunate sufferer takes to his bed, on\r\nwhich he may lie for months. Sometimes, especially during the earlier\r\nstages, he may suffer from terrible delusions, from maniacal paroxysms,\r\nor from epileptic fits, the latter possessing certain peculiarities.\r\nThe tongue during the fit is seldom bitten, which is so commonly the\r\ncase in epilepsy; and the convulsions are not so general, being limited\r\nmore to one side than to the other. It is also remarkable that each fit\r\nis in most cases followed by an increase of the mental derangement.\r\n\r\nPritchard recognises four stages of dementia or fatuity:--\r\n\r\n_First Stage._--Forgetfulness and impaired memory. This is common\r\nto old age. In most cases passing events produce little, if any,\r\nimpression, whilst the past is remembered with tolerable freshness.\r\n\r\n_Second Stage._--Incoherence and unreason, characterised by a total\r\nloss of the reasoning faculty.\r\n\r\n_Third Stage._--Incomprehension. The person so affected is quite\r\nincapable of comprehending the meaning of the simplest question; and\r\nshould he attempt to reply, his answer is generally remote from the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Stage._--Inappetency. The animal instincts are lost. The\r\nunfortunate sufferer lives, and that is all, being scarcely conscious\r\nof life. Organic life is all that is left.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIRIUM TREMENS. SIMPLE DELIRIUM. SOMNAMBULISM. SLEEP-DRUNKENNESS.\r\n\r\n=Delirium Tremens.=--A temporary form of insanity, the result of\r\nexcessive indulgence in spirituous liquors. The drunkard, under the\r\neffects of intoxication, “can derive no privilege from a madness\r\nvoluntarily contracted, but is answerable to the law equally as if he\r\nhad been in full possession of his faculties at the time” (1 Hale 32;\r\nCo. Litt. 247). The intoxication of the defendant may be taken as a\r\nmitigating circumstance, showing that the deed was unpremeditated. A\r\nperson rendered incapable of using his reason by intoxication brought\r\nabout by others, is not liable for his actions.\r\n\r\n=Simple Delirium.=--Acts performed during attacks of certain\r\ndiseases--fever, sunstroke, &c.--accompanied with delirium, do not\r\nrender the individual liable to punishment; and wills made during the\r\ncontinuance of the disorder, if they contain no statement inconsistent\r\nwith the known wishes and desires of the party during health, are\r\nvalid, the law looking more to the good sense of the will as a proof of\r\na lucid interval, than to the proved existence of such lucid interval.\r\n\r\n=Somnambulist, &c.=--This is an abnormal mental state, closely\r\nallied to that artificially produced and known under the names of\r\nmesmerism, hypnotism, electro-biology, &c. It is commonly known as\r\n“sleep-walking.” In this condition the mind appears to become enslaved\r\nby one train of ideas to the exclusion of all others; the somnambulist,\r\nthus deeply bent on the accomplishment of a definite end, takes no heed\r\nof those objects which are in no way connected with the dominant ideas\r\nin his mind. Hence, he walks safely past dangers which, when awake,\r\nwould disconcert his judgment and weaken his will. Somnambulism appears\r\nalso to be closely connected with epilepsy. In 1878, a man named\r\nFraser was tried in Glasgow for the murder of his child by beating it\r\nagainst the wall. He was acquitted on the ground of being unconscious\r\nof the nature of his act by reason of somnambulism. He had sprung\r\nfrom an epileptic and insane stock; his mother died in an epileptic\r\nfit, and some of his other relatives were insane. Thus it appears,\r\nif the somnambulism be proved, the accused is exonerated from any\r\nresponsibility connected with the act for which he is being tried. So\r\nalso, if a person be suddenly aroused from a deep sleep--_somnolentia_\r\nor _sleep-drunkenness_--the question may be raised as to his\r\nresponsibility for an act committed at the moment of awakening (R. _v._\r\nMilligan). There cannot be a doubt but that if a person be suddenly\r\naroused whilst dreaming, he may unconsciously commit acts, the outcome\r\nof his dream, which, unless the possibility of this condition be\r\nrecognised, may entail severe punishment on him. This state is closely\r\nallied to that mental condition which sometimes occurs in epileptics\r\nimmediately after a fit. But in this, as in cases of somnambulism, the\r\nfacts of the case would have to be most carefully scrutinised.\r\n\r\nThe following hints may be of use as a guide in determining the\r\nresponsibility or not of the accused:--\r\n\r\n    1. The person must be shown to have a general tendency to\r\n       deep and heavy sleep, out of which he can only be aroused\r\n       by a violent and convulsive effort.\r\n\r\n    2. Are there any circumstances which, happening before\r\n       the individual went to sleep, would produce a train of\r\n       disturbed thought not entirely composed by sleep?\r\n\r\n    3. Did the act occur during the usual hours for sleep?\r\n\r\n    4. Was the cause of the awakening sudden, and does the act\r\n       bear throughout the character of unconsciousness?\r\n\r\n    5. What were the subsequent acts of the accused in relation\r\n       to the deed? Did he try to evade responsibility? This\r\n       must not have too much stress laid upon it, for the\r\n       wretchedness of the sudden discovery may so overcome him,\r\n       that he may seek to shelter himself from the consequences\r\n       of an act for which he is legally but not morally\r\n       responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTRAINT OF THE INSANE AND DIRECTIONS FOR SIGNING MEDICAL\r\nCERTIFICATES.\r\n\r\nNo person can be put under restraint unless the conditions required by\r\nthe Lunacy Acts are fulfilled. The Acts of Parliament for this purpose\r\nare the Lunacy Act of 1890 (53 Vict. c. 53) and that of 1891 (54 and\r\n55 Vict. c. 65). Lunatics may be put under restraint by the following\r\nprocedures, according to the particular case:--\r\n\r\n    Reception Order on Petition.\r\n    Urgency Order.\r\n    Order after Inquisition.\r\n    Summary Reception Order.\r\n    Order for Lunatics Wandering at Large, and for Pauper Lunatics.\r\n    Reception Order by Two Commissioners.\r\n\r\n=Reception Order on Petition.=--This is usually the procedure for\r\nprivate patients. The order for petition may be obtained from a\r\nspecially appointed Justice of the Peace, Judge of County Courts, or\r\nMagistrate. A petition for the order must be presented to the Judicial\r\nAuthority by the husband, wife, or relative of the alleged lunatic;\r\nif any other person apply, the reasons for this must be given. A\r\npetitioner must be twenty-one years of age or over, and must have seen\r\nthe alleged lunatic _within fourteen days_ before its presentation. A\r\n_statement of particulars_ and two medical certificates must accompany\r\nthe petition. The proceedings are private, and no one except the\r\npetitioner, the alleged lunatic, and any one person appointed by\r\nhim, and the two medical men who have signed the certificates, may\r\nbe present, unless by permission of the Judicial Authority. If the\r\nJudicial Authority be satisfied, he may make the order at once, even\r\nwithout seeing the patient, or he may appoint a time within seven days\r\nfor inquiries and consideration. He may visit the alleged lunatic.\r\n\r\nAt the time of consideration of the petition he may adjourn it for not\r\nmore than fourteen days, or he may make the order at the time. He may\r\nsummon further witnesses, or dismiss the petition, giving his reasons\r\nfor so doing in writing.\r\n\r\nA reception order is valid for seven days from its date, unless the\r\nlunatic is certified by a medical man to be unfit for removal, when the\r\norder is extended until a medical certificate of fitness for removal is\r\nobtained, which is valid for three days.\r\n\r\nThe medical men signing the certificates must not be in partnership,\r\nas principal and assistant, or have any direct or indirect interest in\r\nthe patient or his keeping (16 and 17 Vict. c. 96, sec. 4). They must\r\nmake separate visits at different times for the purpose of examination.\r\nEach medical man must have examined the person within seven clear days\r\nbefore the presentation of the petition.\r\n\r\nEach medical man must write clearly and in the proper place on the\r\ncertificate: (1) The facts observed by himself as evidence of insanity,\r\nand (2) the facts observed by others as evidence of insanity. The name\r\nof his informant must be given.\r\n\r\nOne of the certificates should, whenever practicable, be under the hand\r\nof the usual medical attendant (if any) of the alleged lunatic. If not\r\npracticable, the reason must be given by the petitioner to the Judicial\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\nNeither of the certifying medical practitioners may be the father or\r\nfather-in-law, brother or brother-in-law, sister or sister-in-law,\r\npartner or assistant of the other of them.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken to follow carefully the marginal directions\r\non the certificate form. The most trivial omission will invalidate the\r\ncertificate. The omission of the name of the street and number of the\r\nhouse is sufficient to set it aside. A medical man should remember\r\nthat, although his certificate may have passed the scrutiny of the\r\nCommissioners, it is liable to be made the subject of discussion in\r\na Court of law, and in cross-examination he will have to support the\r\nstatements therein made.\r\n\r\nThe following certificate properly filled up by Dr. Millar of Bethnal\r\nHouse Asylum, is given in his book on _Hints on Insanity_, and may be\r\ntaken as an example of a correct certificate at that time, the present\r\nform being slightly different:--\r\n\r\n                 MEDICAL CERTIFICATE PROPERLY FILLED UP\r\n\r\n    1. _Here set forth the_            I, the undersigned,\r\n    _qualification entitling the_     _John Millar_, being a (¹)\r\n    _person certifying to practise_   _Licentiate of the_\r\n    as a physician, surgeon, _or_       _Royal College of Physicians_,\r\n    apothecary.                        _Edinburgh_,\r\n\r\n    2.

She is suspicious of her husband; says he |\r\n    | keeps bad company; she is most irritable and |\r\n    | jealous, and takes stimulating drinks to a   |\r\n    | dangerous and exciting extent.               |\r\n    |                                              |\r\n    | 2.

He has imperfect sight; good hearing and  |\r\n    | taste; he is unable to speak; his gait is    |\r\n    | ape-like, and the skull-bones seem to have   |\r\n    | fallen together from the want of cerebral    |\r\n    | development. He will occasionally slap his   |\r\n    | face and strike his hands; sometimes makes   |\r\n    | a howling noise.                             |\r\n    |                                              |\r\n    | 4. She is very good-tempered; but day and    |\r\n    | night she talks almost incessantly;          |\r\n    | occasionally sings. She says she comes from  |\r\n    | Otaheite, and relates stories of those       |\r\n    | around her doing absurd things.              |\r\n    +----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |             Good Facts.                      |\r\n    +----------------------------------------------+\r\n    | 1. She states that she is a lost person and  |\r\n    | without hope of forgiveness; that she will   |\r\n    | be taken to prison, and die a miserable      |\r\n    | death; that the devil whispers in her ear    |\r\n    | that she has committed the unpardonable sin. |\r\n    |                                              |\r\n    | 2. Great taciturnity; complete seclusion     |\r\n    | from society; aversion to cleanliness;       |\r\n    | wandering about the streets at improper      |\r\n    | hours.                                       |\r\n    |                                              |\r\n    | 3. He states that he is a Prince of France;  |\r\n    | that he possesses a palace, and has recently |\r\n    | had two fortunes left him (he cannot tell by |\r\n    | whom)--one of £400,000, the other of         |\r\n    | £600,000; that he is going to Liverpool, a   |\r\n    | distance of 150 miles, with a horse and      |\r\n    | cart, which will take him four hours to go,  |\r\n    | and eight to return.                         |\r\n    |                                              |\r\n    | 4. Inability to hold any rational            |\r\n    | conversation; her manner and conduct are     |\r\n    | totally at variance with her usual habits.   |\r\n    +----------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of “Facts” sent back to be amended by the\r\nCommissioners--the emendations in italics:--\r\n\r\n    1. Incoherence, perversion of facts, delusion. _Fancies\r\n       that he possesses large amounts of money which people\r\n       have secreted from him._\r\n\r\n    2. Says her sister lives in Chiselhurst, and she fears she\r\n       is dying. She took great notice of my feet, and remarked\r\n       that they were very large. Query by Commissioner--Are\r\n       these delusions? _Her sister does not live at Chiselhurst,\r\n       and is perfectly well; my feet are not large._\r\n\r\n    3. General restlessness of manner; considers himself heavily\r\n       involved in debt to many thousands of pounds, _whereas\r\n       his debts do not amount to a few hundreds_; says he\r\n       has been ruined by the Government, _whereas he has\r\n       only been dismissed from his appointment on account\r\n       of his incapacity_; and he intends prosecuting the\r\n       Admiralty for £5000 damages, _he having no real ground\r\n       of action_.

I am a person registered under the Medical Act, 1858,\r\n          and I am in the actual practice of the medical profession.\r\n\r\n       2.

The said _______________________________________________________\r\n    appeared to me to be [‡ _____________] in a fit condition of bodily\r\n    health to be removed to an asylum, hospital, or licensed house\r\n    (_k_).  (‡) Or not to be.\r\n\r\n    5. I give this certificate having first read the section of the Act\r\n       of Parliament printed below.\r\n\r\n    =Dated= this ________________ day of _________________________\r\n    One thousand nine hundred and ______________\r\n\r\n                  (=Signed=) _____________________________\r\n                    of (_l_) _____________________________\r\n\r\n      _Extract from section 317 of the Lunacy Act, 1890._\r\n\r\n         Any person who makes a wilful misstatement of any\r\n         material fact in any medical or other certificate,\r\n         or in any statement or report of bodily or mental\r\n         condition under this Act, shall be guilty of a\r\n         misdemeanour.\r\n\r\n=Orders after Inquisition.=--This constitutes a legal investigation\r\nas to whether or not a person is capable of managing his or her own\r\naffairs, and whether restraint is necessary. It is conducted before a\r\njudge, with a jury if the alleged lunatic demand one, unless the judge\r\nis satisfied by personal examination that the lunatic is not mentally\r\ncompetent to understand the demand for a jury. In such a case the\r\nmedical man is only concerned as a witness.\r\n\r\nAccording to circumstances the alleged lunatic may be kept under\r\nrestraint, or remain at liberty with the control of his or her affairs\r\nunder a “Committee of Estate”; or, if declared sane, set free and with\r\ncontrol of his estate.\r\n\r\n=Summary Reception Orders.=--When a lunatic is not under proper\r\ncontrol, and if without relations or friends, and there be no one who\r\nwill sign a petition for detention, or when a lunatic is uncared for,\r\ncruelly treated, and is found so by a medical practitioner, his duty\r\nis to inform a constable, relieving officer, or overseer of the parish\r\nof the fact. The official will then make a statement on oath to a\r\nJudicial Authority, who will direct two medical practitioners to make\r\nthe necessary examinations, and if satisfied he will issue an order for\r\nthe removal of the individual to an asylum. The procedure followed will\r\nthen be the same as for a “petition for reception.” Under a summary\r\nreception order the Judicial Authority may place the person under the\r\ncare of a relation or friend, or the visitors of the asylum in which\r\nthe person is intended to be, or is placed.\r\n\r\n=Lunatics Wandering at Large.=--Every constable, relieving officer,\r\nor overseer of a parish who knows of a person, whether pauper or not,\r\nwho is deemed to be a lunatic and wandering at large, shall apprehend\r\nand take such person before a Justice, or if the Justice receive\r\ninformation on oath, he may have the person apprehended and brought\r\nbefore him. The Justice has the person medically examined, and if\r\ncertified a lunatic to the satisfaction of the Justice, he may issue an\r\norder for detention; if the medical man certify that the person is not\r\nfit for removal, the removal is postponed until the person is certified\r\nfit for it.\r\n\r\nThe above proceedings are not necessary if it be considered a matter of\r\npublic safety and for the good of the alleged lunatic that immediate\r\ndetention be carried out. The constable, relieving officer, or overseer\r\nof the parish may remove such person to the workhouse of the union\r\nin which the person is, and detain him for not more than three days.\r\nBefore the expiration of that time the necessary proceedings under the\r\nLunacy Act must be taken.\r\n\r\n=Reception Order by two Commissioners.=--Any two or more Commissioners\r\nin Lunacy may visit a pauper lunatic or an alleged lunatic not detained\r\nin a workhouse or lunatic asylum, and if satisfied after certification\r\nby a medical man that the person is a lunatic, order removal to an\r\nasylum.\r\n\r\n=Pauper Lunatics.=--A medical officer of a Poor Law Union who has\r\nknowledge that a pauper within his district is alleged to be a\r\nlunatic, shall notify the relieving officer or overseer of the parish\r\nwhere the pauper resides of the fact, who within three days shall\r\nnotify a Justice, who will interview the alleged lunatic and call\r\nin a medical practitioner to examine and certify. If the Justice be\r\nsatisfied that the person be a lunatic, he makes an order for removal\r\nto an asylum. One medical certificate only is necessary.\r\n\r\n=Escape of Lunatics.=--An escaped lunatic may be retaken at any time\r\nwithin fourteen days without a fresh order.\r\n\r\n=Discharge of Lunatics.=--The reception order remains in force for\r\nperiods of one, two, and three years, and then for periods of five\r\nyears. At the end of any of these periods the Lunacy Commissioners may\r\ncontinue the detention of the lunatic, if satisfied by certification\r\nfrom the medical man of the institution, or the usual medical attendant\r\nof the lunatic, that the patient remains of unsound mind and further\r\ndetention is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe petitioner of the reception order may request the discharge of a\r\npatient. The discharge may be refused if the medical man in charge\r\ncertifies the lunatic dangerous and unfit to be at large, unless two of\r\nthe visitors to the asylum or the Commissioners visiting the asylum or\r\nhouse give their consent in writing.\r\n\r\nTwo Commissioners--one medical, the other legal--may order the\r\ndischarge of any patient.\r\n\r\nWhen a patient recovers, the medical attendant of the institution\r\nnotifies this to the petitioner or person responsible for the payment\r\non account of the patient. Should the patient not be removed within\r\nseven days of such notice, the patient may be discharged “forthwith.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nIdiots and imbeciles under eighteen years of age may be received into\r\ntraining schools without the legal procedure which obtains in England\r\nand Wales. They are sent to these institutions as lunatics, however,\r\nunder the usual legalities, in order that the Government grant may be\r\nobtained. When over eighteen years of age, if sent to institutions\r\nother than training schools, they are classed as lunatics, and the\r\nnecessary legal procedure is followed.\r\n\r\n=Insane persons whose malady is not confirmed= may be cared for\r\nprivately for a period not exceeding six months. The certificate of one\r\nmedical practitioner only is required.\r\n\r\n_Insane persons_, pauper or not, can be placed in an asylum by order of\r\nthe Sheriff, by petition and two medical certificates. The inspector of\r\nthe poor acts as petitioner for paupers.\r\n\r\nIn cases of urgency a _certificate of emergency_ from one medical\r\npractitioner is required, along with a request from the petitioner, to\r\nthe superintendent of the asylum.\r\n\r\nA person who is _prodigal_ or _facile_ can be restrained from\r\nalienating his property by guardians appointed by the Court.\r\n\r\nWhen a lunatic is found to be incapable of administering his or her\r\nestate, the Court appoints a Committee of Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE IN IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe procedure differs in pauper and private cases.\r\n\r\n=Pauper patients, not dangerous.=--In order to detain such a pauper\r\nthere must be a declaration of insanity and destitution, with the names\r\nand addresses and descriptions of two relatives of the person, given\r\nbefore a magistrate. A magistrate and a clergyman or poor-law guardian\r\nmust certify that they have personally inquired into the case. One\r\nmedical certificate is necessary. The applicant must remove the patient\r\nwhen called upon.\r\n\r\n=Paying patients who are not dangerous=, for admission to a district\r\nasylum, are under more stringent regulations. A declaration that they\r\nare unable to pay the expenses necessary for support in a licensed\r\nhouse must be made before a magistrate; further, that there is no\r\nfriend who can undertake this; and a statement of the length of time\r\nthe patient has resided in the country. A magistrate and clergyman must\r\ncertify that they have investigated the case. One medical certificate\r\nmust be signed by two practitioners. A guarantee for the payment must\r\nbe given, and also to remove the patient when called upon. The sanction\r\nof an inspector of lunatics must be given.\r\n\r\nFor admission into licensed houses, charitable institutions, and single\r\ncare, an order by a relative or connection of the lunatic is required\r\nwith two medical certificates, unless urgent, when one is sufficient,\r\nbut a second must follow within fourteen days.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIABILITIES OF PERSONS SIGNING LUNACY CERTIFICATES\r\n\r\nA medical practitioner is bound to certify as to the sanity of a\r\nperson. If, however, he undertakes to fill up the certificates\r\nnecessary for the detention of an alleged lunatic, he becomes\r\nresponsible to the authorities for the correctness of the certificates,\r\nand if he make a wilful misstatement of facts he is guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanour. The medical practitioner may have an action brought\r\nagainst him by the lunatic when recovered or discharged. The most\r\nvindictive feelings may be entertained against the medical man. In such\r\na case, if the medical man proves his “good faith” and the exercise of\r\n“reasonable care” in his examination and certification, he receives the\r\nprotection of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIABILITIES OF PERSONS RECEIVING INSANE PATIENTS\r\n\r\nIn the case of Nottidge _v._ Ripley and Nottidge, the Lord Chief Baron\r\nhaving been understood to intimate an opinion that no person ought\r\nto be so confined unless he is dangerous to himself or others, the\r\nCommissioners pointed out that the scope of the Lunacy Acts is not thus\r\nlimited. They said:\r\n\r\n“The object of these Acts is not, as your Lordship is aware, so much\r\nto confine lunatics, as to restore to a healthy state of mind such of\r\nthem as are curable, and to afford comfort and protection to the rest.\r\nMoreover, the difficulty of ascertaining whether one who is insane be\r\ndangerous or not is exceedingly great, and in some cases can only be\r\ndetermined after minute observation for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n“It is of vital importance that no mistake or misconception should\r\nexist, and that every medical man who may be applied to for advice on\r\nthe subject of lunacy, and every relative and friend of any lunatic,\r\nas well as every magistrate and parish officer (each of whom may be\r\ncalled upon to act in cases of this sort), should know and be well\r\nassured that, according to law, any person of unsound mind, whether he\r\nbe pronounced dangerous or not, may legally and properly be placed in a\r\ncounty asylum, lunatic hospital, or licensed house, on the authority of\r\nthe preliminary order and certificates prescribed by the Acts.\r\n\r\n“Upon the whole, it appears that the power to restrain and confine\r\na lunatic is limited at common law to cases in which it would be\r\ndangerous, either as regards others or himself, for the lunatic to\r\nbe at large; but that the power to place and detain a lunatic in a\r\nregistered hospital or licensed or other house, under an order and\r\nmedical certificates duly made and obtained in accordance with the\r\nLunacy Acts, is not so limited.”\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Lunacy Act, 1890, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Subject to the exceptions in this Act mentioned a person\r\n    shall not be received or detained as a lunatic, as a single\r\n    patient, unless under a reception order by a judicial\r\n    authority.” “Every person who, except under the provisions\r\n    of the Act, receives or detains a lunatic or an alleged\r\n    lunatic in an institution for lunatics, or for payment takes\r\n    charge of, receives to board or lodge, or detains a lunatic\r\n    or alleged lunatic in an unlicensed house, shall be guilty\r\n    of a misdemeanour, and in the latter case shall also be\r\n    liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds.” “Except\r\n    under the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for\r\n    any person to receive or detain two or more lunatics in any\r\n    house, unless the house is an institution for lunatics or a\r\n    workhouse.” “Any person who receives or detains two or more\r\n    lunatics in any house except as aforesaid shall be guilty of\r\n    a misdemeanour.”\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unlawful to receive a lunatic or alleged lunatic except\r\nby reception order. Only one can be received into a private house, and\r\na reception order is required. No medical man should receive a lunatic\r\ninto residence without the necessary reception order. All the statutory\r\nregulations are demanded for a single case, and the private house is\r\nsubject to visitation and inspection.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to remember that if any one receive a person not\r\ninsane at the time, but who subsequently becomes insane, he renders\r\nhimself liable to prosecution, unless he procure the necessary medical\r\ncertificates and order (R. _v._ Wilkins).\r\n\r\n=Is a Lunatic a competent Witness?=--Mr. Fitzjames Stephen maintains\r\n(_Criminal Law_) that madmen are competent witnesses in relation to\r\ntestimony as in relation to crime. If they understand the nature of an\r\noath, and the character of the proceedings in which they are engaged,\r\nthey are competent witnesses whatever be the nature or degree of their\r\nmental disorder. An idiot shall not be allowed to give evidence (Co.\r\nLitt. 6 b; Gilb. Ev. 144); a lunatic during a lucid interval may do so\r\n(_Id. Com. Dig. Testm._ {A}). When a lunatic is tendered as a witness,\r\nit is for the judge to examine and ascertain whether he is of competent\r\nunderstanding to give evidence, and is aware of the nature and\r\nobligation of an oath; if satisfied that he is, the judge should allow\r\nhim to be sworn and examined (R. _v._ Hill, 2 Den. 255; 20 L.J. [M.C.]\r\n222).\r\n\r\n=The Civil Rights of Lunatics.=--If an individual be suffering from\r\nsuch mental disease as to render him incompetent to manage his own\r\naffairs, the law steps in to protect him and his property from injury.\r\nBut the power so used does not necessarily imply that he is deprived of\r\nhis personal freedom, but merely such restraint as is necessary for his\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nMany lunatics, under the protection of the Court, live in their own\r\nhouses with large establishments. A person so protected by the law is\r\nsaid to be subject to an “interdiction.” In these cases a commission is\r\nusually granted by the Court of Chancery, and a writ known under the\r\nname of “_de lunatico inquirendo_” issued, after certain legal matters\r\nof detail are settled, and affidavits from medical men certifying to\r\nthe insanity of the party have been filed.\r\n\r\nThe tests of insanity in these cases differ from those required in\r\ncriminal cases, where the knowledge of right from wrong is imperatively\r\ndemanded. The mental defect must not be the result of ignorance or want\r\nof education, and at one time commissions were only issued when it was\r\nshown that lunacy and idiocy alone existed, imbecility or mere weakness\r\nof mind not being deemed sufficient to deprive a man of his civil\r\nrights, or to place him under the protection of the Court.\r\n\r\nTo so great an absurdity did this lead, that the man suffering\r\nfrom a delusion sufficient to be comprehended under the legal term\r\n“lunacy” was protected, whereas the feeble-minded were left without\r\ninterference, though needing it more. The cost of these commissions\r\nsometimes reached almost fabulous sums. The expense has been somewhat\r\nlessened by recent enactments, and the process simplified--the Lord\r\nChancellor having it in his power to direct an inquiry before two\r\nCommissioners, thus dispensing with a jury. (See the 16 and 17 Vict. c.\r\n70, and 25 and 26 Vict. c. 86.)\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, however, the law is far more simple. The cognition\r\nproceeds on a _brieve_ or writ addressed to the Lord President of the\r\nCourt of Session, and directs him to inquire “whether the person sought\r\nto be cognosced is insane, who is his nearest agnate, and whether such\r\nagnate is of lawful age.” “And such person shall be deemed insane if\r\nhe be furious or fatuous, or labours under such unsoundness of mind as\r\nto render him incapable of managing his affairs.” “The trial is before\r\na judge of the Supreme Court and a special jury. If the insanity be\r\nproved, the nearest agnate--relation by the father‘s side--is by law\r\nentitled to the guardianship.” No one not a near relative can institute\r\nthese proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland also, the trial by jury may be avoided by applying by\r\npetition to the Court of Session for the appointment of a judicial\r\nfactor or _curator bonis_. Of this appointment the alleged lunatic\r\nis informed, which, if he please, he may oppose; medical evidence is\r\nreceived, and on this the Court rests its decision--the usual course\r\nbeing to remit the case to some competent person to make inquiry, take\r\nevidence, and report. The Commissioner is usually the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n=Examination of the Insane.=--A few words of caution need here be\r\nsaid. Medical men will consult their own dignity and that of their\r\nprofession by remembering that in cases of alleged insanity, as in\r\nfact in all other cases when their opinion is sought, they are not\r\njustified in taking sides. Their evidence will be the more valuable in\r\nproportion to the care they take in examining into the facts of the\r\ncase, and the good sense and judgment shown in their examination of the\r\npatient. To distinguish between the mistakes, the result of ignorance\r\nand want of education, and those the result of a feeble mind, is of\r\nprimary importance. It is no sign of insanity in an uneducated farmer\r\nthat he knows not the _pons asinorum_. All cases should be tested by\r\nconsidering the surroundings and possible degree of culture of a person\r\nplaced under like conditions as the party under examination. Has he\r\nshown himself capable of an average amount of culture? or is his mental\r\ncondition inferior to what one might legitimately expect under the\r\ninfluences to which he has been subjected? The medical examiner should\r\nalso direct his attention to this important point, setting aside all\r\nlegal and medical theories of insanity, viz.--“Is the case of _such\r\nmental disorder_ as to create _an incapacity for managing affairs_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTAMENTARY CAPACITY\r\n\r\nA medical practitioner may be called upon to give evidence as to\r\nthe capacity of a testator to make a valid will. An ordinary person\r\nwitnessing a will does so to fact only, but if a medical man do so it\r\nimplies that he was of the opinion that the testator was fit to make\r\na will and of a sound and disposing mind. In making an examination of\r\na person for fitness to make a will, the medical man must endeavour\r\nto find out if the testator understands the nature of his action, and\r\nall the details associated with it; also if he knows the nature and\r\namount of his property, and the claims or otherwise of those who may\r\nbecome beneficiaries under it. Further, has he such a delusion as may\r\ninfluence his will in disposing of his property, and bring about a\r\ndisposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nA person may have a delusion or delusions without interfering with the\r\nmaking of a will. If the “disposing mind” be left intact, testamentary\r\ncapacity is upheld. In severe illness and old age the mind may be\r\nso disturbed, without true insanity being present, that a person is\r\nrendered incapable of making a will. In all such cases the medical man\r\nshould be sure of his ground before granting, if requested, that the\r\npatient is capable or otherwise. It is a good plan, when examining a\r\npatient as to testamentary capacity, to have the will produced, and\r\nprivately read it out to the person and ask if it be correct, then to\r\nhave the person repeat the dispositions of the will, and see if they\r\ncoincide with the contents of the document.\r\n\r\nPeople who are aphasic may make wills which are valid. Difficulties\r\narise in cases of sensory aphasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTRAINT OF HABITUAL DRUNKARDS\r\n\r\nAn habitual drunkard, as defined by law, is “a person who, not being\r\namenable to any jurisdiction in lunacy, is notwithstanding, by reason\r\nof habitual intemperate drinking of intoxicating liquor, at times\r\ndangerous to himself or herself, or to others, or incapable of managing\r\nhimself or herself or his or her own affairs.”\r\n\r\nBefore placing such a person under restraint in a licensed retreat the\r\nperson‘s consent must be obtained. The patient must make an application\r\nto a Justice of the Peace, and supported by a declaration from two\r\npersons stating that the applicant is an habitual drunkard within\r\nthe meaning of the Act. If the justice be satisfied, he can make out\r\nan order for detention. The order is valid for any time mentioned in\r\nthe application not exceeding two years. The patient can be detained,\r\nforcibly if necessary, and if escaped may be arrested and taken back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nTOXICOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    DEFINITION OF A POISON--SALE OF POISONS--CLASSIFICATION\r\n        OF POISONS--ACTION OF POISONS--GENERAL EVIDENCE\r\n        OF POISONING--GENERAL TREATMENT IN CASES OF POISONING\r\n        --GENERAL METHODS OF EXAMINATION FOR POISON\r\n\r\n\r\nToxicology is that division of Forensic Medicine which takes into\r\nconsideration the modes and actions of poisons upon the living body,\r\nthe treatment of their effects upon the body, and the methods of\r\ndetecting them when occasion requires.\r\n\r\n=Definition of a Poison.=--Neither the law nor medicine defines a\r\npoison. The popular definition is to be avoided, viz., that, a poison\r\nis a substance capable of acting injuriously on the body when taken or\r\nadministered in a small dose.\r\n\r\nHusband defined a poison as “_any substance which, introduced into the\r\nsystem or applied to the body, is injurious to health and destroys\r\nlife, irrespective of temperature or mechanical means_.”\r\n\r\nTaylor and Stevenson define a poison as “_a substance which when\r\nabsorbed into the blood is, by its direct action, capable of seriously\r\naffecting health or destroying life_.”\r\n\r\nThere are substances, however, which do not require absorption into\r\nthe blood in order to exert their deleterious action, _e.g._ the\r\ncorrosive acids and alkalies; but, although the chief action is a local\r\none in most cases, some absorption does take place and is evidenced\r\nin systemic effects, and are so classified as poisons differing from\r\npowdered glass, which acts mechanically only and is not a poison in the\r\ntrue sense of the word.\r\n\r\nWinter Blyth considers that “_a substance of definite chemical\r\ncomposition, whether mineral or organic, may be called a poison if it\r\nis capable of being taken into any living organism, and causes, by its\r\nown inherent chemical nature, impairment or destruction of function_.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Luff a poison is “_a substance which, either by its direct\r\naction upon the skin or mucous membranes, or after its absorption into\r\nthe blood, is capable of injuriously affecting health or destroying\r\nlife_.”\r\n\r\nLetheby defines a poison as “_anything which otherwise than by the\r\nagency of heat or electricity is capable of destroying life, either by\r\nchemical action on the tissues of the living body, or by physiological\r\naction from absorption into the system_.”\r\n\r\nThe law does not recognise the manner in which the substance acts, nor\r\nthe result; the legal standpoint is the _intent_ of the administrator\r\nqua administrator. The law is as follows: “_Whosoever shall administer\r\nor cause to be administered or taken by any person any poison or other\r\ndestructive thing with intent to commit murder shall be guilty of a\r\nfelony_” (24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, sec. 11).\r\n\r\nSection 22. “_Whosoever shall unlawfully apply or administer to or\r\ncause to be taken by, or attempt to apply or administer to, or attempt\r\nto cause to be administered to or taken by, any person, any chloroform,\r\nlaudanum, or other stupefying or overpowering drug, matter, or thing,\r\nwith intent, in any of such cases, thereby to enable himself or any\r\nother person to commit, or with intent, &c., to assist any other person\r\nin committing any indictable offence, shall be guilty of felony._”\r\n\r\nSection 23 enacts that, “_Whosoever shall unlawfully administer to, or\r\ncause to be administered to, or taken by any other person, any poison\r\nor other destructive or noxious thing so as thereby to endanger the\r\nlife of such person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any\r\ngrievous bodily harm, shall be guilty of a felony_.”\r\n\r\nSection 24. “_Whosoever shall unlawfully or maliciously administer to\r\nor cause to be administered to or taken by any other person any poison\r\nor other destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure or aggrieve\r\nor annoy such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour._”\r\n\r\nSection 25. “_If upon the trial of any person charged with the felony\r\nabove mentioned the jury shall not be satisfied that such person\r\nis guilty thereof, but shall be satisfied that he is guilty of the\r\nmisdemeanour above mentioned, then, and in every such case, the jury\r\nmay acquit the accused for such felony and find him guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanour._”\r\n\r\n=Administration of Noxious Drugs.=--The law throws on the medical\r\nwitness the responsibility of the definition of a _noxious thing_, and\r\nwhether it was given in excess, or liable to cause annoyance or injury\r\nto health. At a Bodmin Assize, Lord Chief-Justice Cockburn, after\r\nconsultation with Mr. Justice Hawkins, delivered an important judgment\r\non the subject. A man was charged with having administered cantharides\r\nwith criminal intent. The judges ruled that there must not only be\r\nan administration of a noxious drug with a guilty intent, but the\r\ndrug must have been administered in such quantities as to be noxious,\r\nwhereas the dose here given was too small to be seriously deleterious.\r\nDistinction was drawn between a drug like cantharides, which is only\r\nnoxious when given in excess, and strychnine, a well-established\r\npoison. Acquittal was therefore directed. In the case of R. _v._ Cramp,\r\nthe prisoner was charged with having administered half an ounce of\r\noil of juniper with intent to procure abortion. He was convicted, but\r\nappealed on the legal ground that the substance must be noxious in\r\nitself, and not only when given in excess. Lord Coleridge ruled that\r\n“if a person administers with intent to produce miscarriage something\r\nwhich _as administered_ is ‘noxious,’ he administers a ‘noxious thing.’”\r\n\r\n=The Sale of Poisons.=--The law, by the Pharmacy Act, 1868, and its\r\namendments, restricts the sale of poisons to pharmaceutical chemists,\r\nchemists and druggists, and registered medical practitioners. The Acts\r\ndefine and indicate by schedule “Poisons within the meaning of the\r\nAct.” The Schedule of Poisons, as amended in the “Poisons and Pharmacy\r\nAct, 1908,” and “Additions to Schedule 1913,” is:\r\n\r\n                          SCHEDULE OF POISONS\r\n               [_As amended by Orders in Council_]\r\n\r\n                            Part I\r\n\r\n    Arsenic, and its medicinal preparations.\r\n    Aconite, aconitine, and their preparations.\r\n    Alkaloids.--All poisonous vegetable alkaloids not specifically named\r\n                in this schedule, and their salts, and all poisonous\r\n                derivatives of vegetable alkaloids.\r\n    Atropine, and its salts, and their preparations.\r\n    Belladonna, and all preparations or admixtures (except belladonna\r\n                plasters) containing 0.1 or more per cent. of belladonna\r\n                alkaloids.\r\n    Cantharides, and its poisonous derivatives.\r\n    Coca, any preparation or admixture of, containing 1 or more\r\n          per cent. of coca alkaloids.\r\n    Corrosive sublimate.\r\n    Cyanide of potassium, and all poisonous cyanides and their\r\n                          preparations.\r\n    Emetic tartar, and all preparations or admixtures containing 1 or\r\n                   more per cent. of emetic tartar.\r\n    Ergot of rye, and preparations of ergots.\r\n    Nux vomica, and all preparations or admixtures containing 0.2 or\r\n                more per cent. of strychnine.\r\n    Opium, and all preparations or admixtures containing 1 or more\r\n           per cent. of morphine.\r\n    Picrotoxin.\r\n    Prussic acid, and all preparations or admixtures containing 0.1 or\r\n                  more per cent. of prussic acid.\r\n    Savin, and its oil, and all preparations or admixtures containing\r\n           savin or its oil.\r\n\r\n                           Part II\r\n\r\n    Almonds, essential oil of (unless deprived of prussic acid).\r\n    Antimonial wine.\r\n    Cantharides, tincture and all vesicating liquid preparations or\r\n                 admixtures of.\r\n    Carbolic acid, and liquid preparations of carbolic acid,\r\n          and its homologues containing more than 3 per cent.\r\n          of those substances, except preparations for use as\r\n          sheep wash or for any other purpose in connection with\r\n          agriculture or horticulture, contained in a closed\r\n          vessel distinctly labelled with the word “poisonous,”\r\n          the name and address of the seller, and a notice of\r\n          the special purposes for which the preparations are\r\n          intended.\r\n    Chloral hydrate.\r\n    Chloroform, and all preparations or admixtures containing more\r\n                than 20 per cent. of chloroform.\r\n    Coca, any preparation or admixture of, containing more than 0.1\r\n          per cent. but less than 1 per cent. of coca alkaloids.\r\n    Diethyl-barbituric acid, and other alkyl, aryl, or metallic\r\n          derivatives of barbituric acid, whether described\r\n          as veronal, proponal, medinal, or by any other\r\n          trade name, mark, or designation; and all poisonous\r\n          urethanes and ureides. [_Added March 12, 1913._]\r\n    Digitalis.\r\n    Mercuric iodide.\r\n    Mercuric sulphocyanide.\r\n    Oxalic acid.\r\n    Poppies, all preparations of, excepting red poppy petals and syrup\r\n             of red poppies (_Papaver rhœas_).\r\n    Precipitate, red, and all oxides of mercury.\r\n    Precipitate, white.\r\n    Strophanthus.\r\n    Sulphonal, and its homologues, whether described as trional,\r\n               tetronal, or by any other trade name, mark, or\r\n               designation. [_Added March 12, 1913._]\r\n\r\n    All preparations or admixtures which are not included in\r\n        Part I. of this schedule, and contain a poison within\r\n        the meaning of the Pharmacy Acts, except preparations\r\n        or admixtures the exclusion of which from this\r\n        schedule is indicated by the words therein relating to\r\n        carbolic acid, chloroform, and coca, and except such\r\n        substances as come within the provisions of Section 5\r\n        of this Act.\r\n\r\nMemorandum.--Special importance attaches to the last paragraph of Part\r\nII. of the schedule, as the effect of that paragraph is to include in\r\nPart II. many preparations and admixtures of vegetable drugs which\r\ncontain poisonous alkaloids, although the drugs containing them are not\r\nspecified in the schedule.\r\n\r\nWith those in Part I. a registration of the sale is compulsory, the\r\npurchaser must be known to or introduced by some person known to the\r\nvendor, and the purpose for which the poison is required, the date,\r\nthe name and amount of the poison sold, the name and address of the\r\nbuyer, and the entry must be signed by the purchaser and introducer.\r\nAll substances in Parts I. and II. must be labelled by the vendor\r\nwith a label bearing the name of the poison, the name and address\r\nof the seller, and the word “Poison”; but with those in Part II. no\r\nregistration as in Part I. is required. In the sale of arsenic both\r\nthe seller and purchaser must sign the entry, and the introducer must\r\nwitness it. No arsenic can be legally sold to a person under the age of\r\ntwenty-one years; nor may it be sold in quantities of less than 10 lbs.\r\nunless mixed with soot or indigo--one ounce of the former, or half an\r\nounce of the latter, to each pound of arsenic. If quantities of over 10\r\nlbs. be sold, and the soot or indigo would render it unfit for use in\r\nthe way desired, then they may be omitted (_Arsenic Act_, 1851).\r\n\r\n=Classification of Poisons.=--A good and scientific classification\r\nof poisons is still wanted. The following simple general division,\r\ndepending upon the chief effect, may be taken as guides by the student:\r\n\r\n    (a) _Corrosives_--Local corrosion.\r\n    (b) _Irritants_--Gastro-intestinal irritation.\r\n    (c) _Neurotics_--Altered action of the nervous system.\r\n\r\n                1.

(2) That poisons possess an elective affinity\r\nfor certain tissues and organs. Thus, arsenic, however introduced\r\ninto the system, as a rule attacks the stomach; and this peculiarity\r\nof action closely allies it to the poisons of typhoid, scarlet fever,\r\nsmallpox, &c., which appear to have, respectively, an elective affinity\r\nfor the glands of the intestines, the throat, and the skin. (3) That\r\nthe habitual use of a poison in medicinal doses does not ensure a\r\nperfect toleration on the part of the system with regard to the action\r\nof the poison, for sooner or later a complete cachexia is produced,\r\nshowing that the poisonous effect of the drug is not arrested.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there are also certain conditions connected with\r\nthe action of poisons: (1) The poison is absorbed and distributed by\r\nthe blood. (2) A portion is eliminated by the fluid secretions and\r\nexcretions. (3) Another portion is for a time deposited in the tissues\r\nand organs of the body. These processes are of necessity simultaneous.\r\n\r\nThe channels of entrance and exit are as follows: Of entrance we\r\nhave--(1) _The blood-vessels as a result of wounds_--more important\r\nin a physiological than a medico-legal question. (2) _The skin and\r\ncellular membrane._--Absorption by the skin is modified by the\r\ncondition of the part, and also by the form in which the drug is\r\napplied. Thus the skin of the arm-pits and groins is more absorbent\r\nthan the palms of the hands. Watery solutions are not so effective\r\nas oily preparations, and the application of the drug in fine powder\r\nis more effectual than a watery solution of it. This is explained\r\nby the presence of a natural oily, unctuous substance on the skin,\r\nwhich prevents the direct contact of the watery solution, but if the\r\nsolution be allowed to evaporate on the part, the substance thus left\r\nin minute division is then readily absorbed. The danger of allowing\r\nstrong solutions of corrosive sublimate to evaporate on the head in the\r\ntreatment of certain skin eruptions is thus explained. (3) _The lungs\r\nand air-passages._--Absorption by these organs is most active, hence\r\nthe intense rapidity in the action of aerial poisons. (4) _The stomach\r\nand intestines._--Poisons introduced into the stomach or intestines\r\ntake longer to arrive at the special organs on which they act than by\r\nthe other channels of entrance. They are absorbed by the capillaries\r\ninto the mesenteric veins, and before passing to the heart, by which\r\nthey enter the general circulation, they pass through the liver, where\r\nthey are in part excreted in the bile or deposited in the gland. The\r\nabsorbing power of the stomach is modified by its fulness or emptiness,\r\nand poisons not soluble in water may be rendered so by the gastric\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nThe avenue of entrance may materially modify the action, and some\r\npoisons which act rapidly when entering by a wound, are inert when\r\ntaken into the stomach. Snake poisons when given by the mouth are\r\nentirely harmless. Hydrogen sulphide is more toxic when inhaled\r\nthan when taken in solution. This, though true in some cases, does\r\nnot always occur; and the inertness of these poisons, it has been\r\nsuggested, may be due to the elimination of them being as rapid\r\nas their absorption, so that a poisonous dose never enters the\r\ncirculation. The intestines absorb more rapidly than the stomach, and\r\nthis must be borne in mind when administering powerful drugs _per anum_.\r\n\r\nOf the channels of exit we have: (1) _The kidneys._ (2) _The lungs._\r\n(3) _The bile._ (4) _The milk._ (5) _The saliva._ (6) _Mucous\r\nmembrane._ (7) _The skin._\r\n\r\nWe know not the cause, but certain poisons appear to select a\r\nparticular route for their exit--thus iodide of potassium leaves by\r\nthe urine; mercury and its salts by the saliva; arsenic and eserine,\r\nthe active principle of the Calabar bean, in small quantities, by the\r\nstomach, &c. We are, however, prepared to show that all poisons must\r\nenter the blood before they produce their effects, and that almost\r\nsimultaneously with the entrance of the poison into the blood a process\r\nof elimination begins, and that fatal effects depend upon absorption\r\ntaking place more rapidly than elimination. On the amount also of the\r\npoison absorbed do its fatal effects depend, and not on the quantity\r\nactually taken. Whilst absorption and elimination are both going on,\r\nsome of the poison is being deposited in the organs and tissues of the\r\nbody. As proofs of these statements it has been shown that poisons\r\nhave been detected in the blood, and that urine, saliva, and milk,\r\nfluids secreted from it, may contain portions of the poison taken, and\r\nproduce dangerous symptoms when given to other animals. Poisons applied\r\nto the brain tissue, or to nerve trunks, do not produce symptoms,\r\nand the action of a poison may be arrested for a time by compressing\r\nby a ligature the main vessels of the limb under the skin of which\r\nthe poison has been injected. After death no trace of the poison may\r\nbe detected, the quantity taken being just sufficient to produce a\r\nfatal result, or elimination may be so rapid that, although death was\r\ndirectly due to the poison, any remains of its existence cannot be\r\nmade out. This occurred in the case of Dr. Alexander, who died from\r\nan accidental dose of arsenic, all the arsenic being eliminated in\r\n_seventeen_ days--in another fatal case, in _seven_ days.

A small concentrated dose acts as an irritant;\r\ndiluted, it is soon absorbed, and quickly causes death.\r\n\r\nGENERAL EVIDENCE AND DIAGNOSIS OF POISONING\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to consider briefly the general evidences of\r\npoisoning, in order to determine whether a death alleged to be due\r\nto poison is not really the result of disease. For convenience of\r\ndescription, this subject will be divided into five sections:\r\n\r\n    1. Evidence from the Symptoms.\r\n    2. Evidence from the _Post-mortem_ Appearances.\r\n    3. Evidence from Chemical Analysis.\r\n    4. Evidence from Experiments on Animals.\r\n    5. Moral Evidence.\r\n\r\n1. =Evidence from the Symptoms.=--As a general rule the symptoms come\r\non suddenly while the person is in apparent health, except in cases of\r\nslow poisoning, when the poison may be so administered by frequently\r\nrepeated and small doses as to simulate disease, and the physician is\r\nmore easily misled than when a single large dose is given. In cases of\r\nsuspected homicide this suddenness in the accession of the symptoms\r\nis particularly to be noticed, and we may have to decide as to the\r\nprobabilities of accident, suicide, or homicide. Here collateral\r\nevidence must be our guide. The slowness, obscurity, and irregularity\r\nof the symptoms are more in favour of homicide than either accident or\r\nsuicide. But it must also be borne in mind that the invasion of many\r\ndiseases is sudden, as is the case with cholera, gastritis, and some\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nCertain conditions of the system more or less modify the effects of\r\nsome poisons. Thus, sleep delays the action of arsenic; and this may\r\nalso be the case with other poisons. Intoxication has also been said\r\nto exert a retarding power over the action of certain poisons. This is\r\nprobably more apparent than real, the fact being that the symptoms in\r\nthe cases observed are masked.\r\n\r\nMuch more important, however, is the influence of disease. Large doses\r\nof opium are well borne in mania, delirium tremens, dysentery, and\r\ntetanus; whereas it is well known that even small doses of mercury in\r\ncases of Bright‘s disease of the kidney, or in children recovering from\r\nany of the eruptive fevers, have produced dangerous salivation.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning go on from bad to worse in a steady course;\r\nbut there may be remissions, followed, under treatment, by their\r\nentire disappearance, no ill effect remaining. Remissions are most\r\nlikely to occur in slow poisoning with the metallic irritants, from\r\nfear of detection or cunning on the part of the poisoner to imitate\r\nthe progress of disease. In nervous affections, all the symptoms must\r\nbe taken into consideration, and these will be found to differ from\r\nthose of any known poison. The history of the case should also have due\r\nattention paid to it.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning, the symptoms appear soon after food or drink has been\r\ntaken. This is open to the objection that apoplexy has occurred\r\nimmediately after a meal. The probative value of the above statement\r\nis, however, increased if several persons have been similarly affected\r\nafter partaking of the same dish, especially if the symptoms followed\r\nwithin a short time--under four hours--of the meal. But it must also be\r\nremembered that all persons are not affected alike by the same poison.\r\nAgain, the diagnostic value is weakened if it can be proved that the\r\nperson or persons affected have taken nothing in the way of food for\r\ntwo or three hours previously.\r\n\r\n_The flesh of animals poisoned by accident, or intentionally, may\r\nseriously affect those who eat it._--As a case in point may be\r\nmentioned the injurious effects produced in some persons who had\r\npartaken of the Canadian partridges imported to this country some years\r\nago, and which had probably eaten some poisonous berries during the\r\nsevere winter of that year.\r\n\r\nPoisons may be introduced into the system otherwise than by the mouth;\r\nthat is, they may be placed in the vagina or rectum, or inhaled when\r\nvolatile poisons are used. Sometimes a poison has been introduced\r\ninto the medicine, or a poisonous draught substituted for the one\r\nprescribed. In any case, where suspicious symptoms suddenly occur, the\r\npoison has most probably been taken in from half an hour to an hour\r\npreviously, and it is of special importance to note the period of time\r\nthat may have elapsed between the accession of the symptoms and the\r\nlast meal, or administration of medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen called in to a case of suspected poisoning, and in many cases\r\nwhere no suspicion at the time arises, the medical attendant should pay\r\nattention to the following points:\r\n\r\n    1. The time of the occurrence of the symptoms, and their\r\n       character.\r\n    2. The time that has elapsed between their commencement and\r\n       the last meal, dose of medicine, &c.\r\n    3. Have the symptoms continued without intermission or\r\n       remission, and in an aggravated form, till death?\r\n    4. The order of their occurrence.\r\n    5. The previous health or illness of the patient.\r\n    6. Have the symptoms any relation to a particular meal or\r\n       article of food, &c.?\r\n    7. If patient has vomited, have the vomited matters,\r\n       especially the first, been carefully preserved?\r\n    8. Preserve all vomited matters, food, medicines, &c.\r\n    9. How many were at the meal, and was what was taken common\r\n       to all, or only taken by a few?\r\n\r\n2. =Evidence from= _Post-mortem_ =Appearances=.--The morbid\r\nappearances found in cases of poisoning will be treated more in\r\ndetail when each poison, or group of poisons, comes to be separately\r\nconsidered. A caution may be given here against allowing the\r\n_post-mortem_ signs of disease or external injury to exclude the\r\nidea of poisoning; for death may to all appearance be the result\r\nof disease or injury, and yet be caused by poison. An attention to\r\nthe _post-mortem_ appearances is important in all cases; for in\r\nmany instances, where the symptoms were unknown to the experts at\r\nthe time the inspection was made, they were subsequently found to\r\ncorrespond with the morbid changes which the autopsy revealed. The\r\nnormal appearance of the stomach is white or nearly so, except during\r\ndigestion, when it is reddened; yet we may sometimes come across cases\r\nin which the mucous membrane of this organ may be found so reddened as\r\nto lead to a suspicion of poisoning. The knowledge of this fact, and\r\nthe absence of symptoms, will prevent an error in diagnosis. Ulceration\r\nfrom disease and from irritant poisoning must be distinguished. In\r\nthat due to disease, the ulcers formed are, as a rule, small and\r\ncircumscribed; in those from poison, there is diffused inflammatory\r\nredness over other parts of the stomach, and even in the intestines;\r\nand the poison, as in the case of arsenic, may be found adhering to the\r\nsides of the ulcer. Ulceration is more frequently the result of disease\r\nthan of the action of poisons. Perforation of the stomach or intestines\r\nmay be due to ulceration or to corrosion. The condition of the mouth\r\nand gullet will help the diagnosis. The appearance of the ulcer and\r\nthe parts around it, together with the hints just given, must guide\r\nthe diagnosis. Of _post-mortem_ softening little need be said, beyond\r\nstating that it very rarely occurs, and is of course not preceded\r\nby symptoms. (For the diagnosis between inflammatory redness of the\r\nintestines and _post-mortem_ staining, see page 45.)\r\n\r\n3. =Evidence from Chemical Analysis.=--The objects of a chemical\r\nanalysis are to determine: (1) The presence and nature of the poison.\r\n(2) The proportion or quantity of the poison taken. (3) The solution of\r\ncertain questions connected with the administration of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe detection of poison in the body is of course the most important\r\nproof of poisoning; but it may be suggested that the poison was\r\nintroduced after death, which, to say the least, is a most ingenious\r\nline of defence, but which, at the same time, must be held to be highly\r\nimprobable, and impossible if found deposited in one or more of the\r\nsolid organs. Again, granting that poison has been taken, is it the\r\ncause of death? This question may arise when injuries are found on the\r\nbody, and it then becomes a matter of importance to know something of\r\nthe symptoms which preceded death, and the morbid appearances found\r\nafter death. The case of the girl who took arsenic to escape a beating\r\nby her father is a case in point. The father was tried for causing the\r\ndeath of the girl by undue severity, but it was subsequently shown\r\nthat arsenic self-administered was the true cause of death. The poison\r\nmay disappear from the body. This disappearance may be effected by\r\nvomiting, purging, or by the urine, or the poison may become absorbed\r\nand decomposed. The person poisoned may live sufficiently long to allow\r\nof the entire elimination of the poison, and yet die of the induced\r\nexhaustion. (See case of Dr. Alexander, _ante_.)\r\n\r\nSome poisons, especially those which are sparingly soluble, are with\r\ndifficulty removed from the stomach, even by the most incessant and\r\nviolent vomiting. This is notably the case with arsenic, which adheres\r\nto the mucous coat of the stomach with considerable tenacity. But\r\neven after all traces of the poison have left the stomach, it may be\r\ndetected in the solid viscera.\r\n\r\nTemporary deposit of poison in the organs or tissues (Taylor): (1) The\r\nLiver. (2) The Kidneys. (3) The Spleen. (4) The Heart. (5) The Lungs.\r\n(6) The Muscles. (7) The Brain. (8) The Fat. (9) The Bones.\r\n\r\nWith regard to arsenic, the following table, taken from Taylor, is of\r\nimportance, as showing the amount of the poison which may be found in\r\nthe liver at certain intervals:\r\n\r\n    After taking the Poison.    Total Weight of Arsenic.\r\n\r\n    In 5½ to 7 hours                  0.8 grains.\r\n       8¾ hours                       1.2\r\n       15 hours                       2.0\r\n       17 to 20 hours                 1.3\r\n       10½ days                       1.5\r\n       14 days                        0.17\r\n       17 days                       _nil_\r\n\r\nIs it necessary that the poison should be found in the body or in the\r\nevacuations to lead to a conviction for poisoning? On this point,\r\nChristison was of opinion that if the symptoms, _post-mortem_,\r\nappearances, and moral evidence are very strong, it is not necessary\r\nthat the poison be found in order to establish a charge of poisoning.\r\nThis opinion was also supported by the late Dr. Geoghehan, Professor\r\nof Medical Jurisprudence in the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland,\r\nand was also virtually acted upon in the case of Palmer, where the\r\nnon-detection of strychnia was strongly dwelt upon by the counsel for\r\nthe defence, but without success. Many of the vegetable poisons almost\r\ndefy detection, except by the symptoms, _post-mortem_ appearances, and\r\nsome experiments on animals of doubtful value. The detection of poison\r\nin the food taken, or in the vomited matters, is of great importance;\r\nbut it is of still greater importance if it can be found in the\r\nurine, drawn from the bladder, this being a proof that it has passed\r\nthrough the system. Here again a caution is necessary--for it must be\r\nremembered that poisoning may be _feigned_ or _imputed_--the poison\r\nbeing mixed with the food and evacuations, and an innocent person\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions should be carefully considered by every\r\nanalyst when substances are sent to him for examination:\r\n\r\nHe should carefully note when and from whom the substances were\r\nreceived; in what state they were received--secured, or exposed--the\r\nnumber of articles, and whether properly labelled. He must make the\r\nanalysis himself, and state where it was made. The character and\r\nnature of the substances examined should be noted, and he must be\r\nprepared to give an outline of the methods or processes used for their\r\ndetermination. He must also be able to guarantee the purity of his\r\nreagents, and be prepared to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n    1. Is the poison free or combined?\r\n    2. What is the strength and quantity found?\r\n    3. Could the poisonous substance exist naturally?\r\n    4. How much of the poison found is a fatal dose?\r\n    5. If no poison is found, is there anything noxious\r\n       or injurious to health?\r\n\r\nThe analyst may have the following submitted to him for examination:\r\n(1) Substances found on the accused, or in the room, or on the person\r\nof the deceased. (2) Articles of food. (3) Vomited matters, urine, &c.\r\n(4) Contents of the stomach. (5) Solid organs of the body.\r\n\r\nHe may also have his results called in question for the following\r\nreasons: (1) Purity of his reagents. (2) Faulty processes. (3) Hasty\r\nconclusions. (4) Experiments on animals.\r\n\r\nDeath may undoubtedly be due to the action of a poison, and yet its\r\npresence may fail to be detected, due to--(1) The nature of the\r\npoison-strychnia, hydrocyanic acid, &c. (2) Vomiting and purging. (3)\r\nAbsorption and elimination. (4) Decomposition--phosphorus, chloral\r\nhydrate, chloroform. (5) Smallness of the dose.\r\n\r\n(For directions for conducting a _post-mortem_ examination in cases of\r\npoisoning, see page 61.)\r\n\r\n=4. Evidence from Experiments on Animals.=--The evidence derived from\r\nexperiments on animals with the contents of the stomach and vomited\r\nmatters must not be too implicitly trusted, as these may give rise to\r\nvomiting and other symptoms when no poison is present. All animals are\r\nnot alike affected with man by the same poisons; and it appears that\r\nthe dog and the cat are the only animals that at all approach man with\r\nregard to the effects produced. Experiments on the lower animals are\r\nuseless to decide--(1) The fatal dose of any poison. (2) The rate of\r\nabsorption, deposition, or elimination of poisons. (3) The rapidity of\r\nthe action of certain poisons.\r\n\r\nIn the case, however, of some vegetable poisons, the effects produced\r\non animals by a portion of the substance taken by the person\r\nsuspected of having been poisoned, may afford corroborative evidence\r\nof poisoning. In the case of Lamson, executed for poisoning his\r\nbrother-in-law with aconite, experiments on animals formed the chief\r\nevidence against the accused.\r\n\r\n=5. Moral Evidence.=--The moral evidence of poisoning is generally\r\nfurnished by the common witnesses of the Crown; but the value of this\r\nkind of evidence, in many cases, can only be fully appreciated by a\r\nmedical witness. To render this part of the subject as complete as\r\npossible, a few remarks may not be out of place. The suspicious conduct\r\nof the prisoner before and after the event, the recent purchase of\r\npoison, the mode of administration, the object of the prisoner in\r\ngetting rid of his supposed victim, and the fact of several persons\r\nbeing alike affected, should be carefully noted down. The anxiety\r\nevinced during the illness of the deceased, and the hurry in the\r\nfuneral arrangements, showing an over-anxiety to remove all traces of\r\nhis guilt, are suspicious. The probability of suicide is weakened by\r\nthe state of the mind and the nature of the dying declarations of the\r\ndeceased. In the case of a person indicted for poisoning, evidence to\r\nshow motive in another case is admissible. (R. _v._ Geering, 18 L.J.\r\n[M.C.] 215; R. _v._ Heeson or Johnson; R. _v._ Garner, 3 F. & F. 681.)\r\n\r\nLastly, it remains to be considered--\r\n\r\n_What is the duty of a Medical Man who suspects the Action of Poison in\r\na Patient on whom he is in attendance?_\r\n\r\nIn the case of R. _v._ Wooler, Baron Martin, who tried the case, in\r\nhis charge to the jury, stated that, in his opinion, the medical men\r\nin attendance ought, “when the idea of poisoning struck them, to have\r\ncommunicated their suspicion to the husband, if they did not suspect\r\nhim; and if they did suspect him, they ought to have gone before a\r\nmagistrate.” Suppose they had acted as the learned judge suggested,\r\nand spoken to the husband, who, had he been guilty, would in all\r\nprobability have desisted from his terrible design for a time, then\r\na great criminal would have been let loose on society, and without\r\npunishment. Then, again, had they applied to the magistrates, the delay\r\ncaused by the indecision of the magistrates how to act in so delicate\r\na case would have allowed the criminal to remove all traces of his\r\ndesign, and the means of testing their suspicions would have been lost;\r\nand, along with this, would have been lost the professional character\r\nand fortunes of the authors of the investigation. “There is a third\r\ncourse,” said the late Sir R. Christison, “and in my opinion it is the\r\nfittest of all: When the medical attendant is satisfied of the fact of\r\npoisoning, he should communicate his conviction to the patient himself.\r\nHis predicament, in every other way, is so embarrassing, that he ought\r\nnot to be deterred by the chance of injury to his patient from making\r\nso dreadful a disclosure.” (See an account of the same course being\r\nadopted in the case of Mr. Blandy by his physician, Dr. Addington,\r\nreported in Howell‘s _State Trials_, vol. xviii.)\r\n\r\n    Table giving the names of Diseases, the Symptoms\r\n        of which resemble those the result of Irritant Poisons,\r\n        together with such points of difference as may assist in\r\n        distinguishing the one from the other:\r\n\r\nIrritant Poison.--Symptoms of violent irritation in one or more\r\nportions of the alimentary canal. Pricking and burning of the tongue\r\nand mouth, and intense thirst, frequently accompanied with great\r\nconstriction in the throat. Great abdominal pain and tenderness.\r\nVomiting and purging are also usually present. The skin is hot and\r\ncold at intervals; the pulse small, frequent, and irregular. In the\r\nlast stage the skin may become icy cold. _An acrid, metallic, or\r\nburning taste in the mouth precedes the vomiting._ The vomit and alvine\r\ndischarges are generally mixed with _blood_. Death occurs in from six\r\nhours to two days and a half.\r\n\r\nCholera.--Extreme and sudden prostration. The breath is cold to the\r\nhand in the last stages. The body is cold, shrivelled, and livid, or\r\nof a leaden hue. Vomiting and purging are present; the former is never\r\nbloody, the latter resembling rice-water. The thirst is intense, and in\r\nthis particular alone resembles the effects of irritant poison. Death\r\nin from one to two days, or even less.\r\n\r\n                    Summary of the General Evidence of Poisoning,\r\n                               in a Tabular Form\r\n    ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n                  Poison.             |              Natural Causes.\r\n    ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n     1.

Pain in the belly, and vomiting. But in this\r\ndisease the vomit and alvine discharges are _never_ bloody, most\r\nfrequently bilious. _An acrid taste in the mouth and throat succeeds\r\nthe vomiting._ This is due to the acrid nature of the vomited matters.\r\nThe stools contain bile in English cholera; in irritant poisoning,\r\nsometimes blood. Death is rare within three days.\r\n\r\nGastritis.--Acute idiopathic gastritis is so rare in this country as\r\nscarcely to need description. Most of the cases recorded of acute\r\ngastritis have been found to be due to irritants. We must, therefore,\r\nconsider the period and order of the occurrence of the symptoms in\r\nrelation to the last meal. Costiveness of the bowels would point to the\r\npresence of gastritis or enteritis, violent purging and vomiting to\r\nirritant poisoning.\r\n\r\nEnteritis.--Though more common than gastritis, enteritis is a rare\r\ndisease. The bowels are generally _confined_. Tubercular and aphthous\r\ninflammation of the intestines may simulate irritant poisoning,\r\nespecially chronic poisoning by arsenic. The _post-mortem_ and a\r\nchemical analysis will reveal the true cause of death.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis.--In the early stages of the disease vomiting is rare,\r\nand constipation is the rule, with marked tenderness over the whole\r\nabdomen. The morbid appearances in the peritoneum are seldom caused by\r\nirritants.\r\n\r\nPerforation of the Stomach.--The symptoms supervene immediately after\r\na meal; the pain, which is very acute, gradually extending over\r\nthe abdomen. In most cases the patient has suffered for some time\r\npreviously from dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nHernia.--Examine the seat of pain, the cause will be soon detected.\r\nBut an omental hernia may be present, giving rise to twisting pain at\r\numbilicus.\r\n\r\nIntussusception of the Bowels.--Pain, sudden and confined to one\r\nspot below the stomach. Vomiting is present _without_ purging, thus\r\ndiffering from diarrhœa and cholera. After a time the vomit becomes\r\nfæcal.\r\n\r\nColic.--May be confounded with poisoning by the salts of lead. If lead\r\nbe taken in large doses, it produces the symptoms common to irritant\r\npoisons added to those of colic. In chronic lead poisoning, the blue\r\nline round the gums, the aspect of the patient, and history of the\r\ncase, will point to the true cause of the symptoms. Lead colic is also\r\ngenerally accompanied with extreme depression of spirits.\r\n\r\nRupture of Internal Organs.--Rupture of the stomach, duodenum,\r\ngall-bladder, and impregnated uterus, is of rare occurrence. The\r\nautopsy will show the true cause of death.\r\n\r\n    Table giving the names of Diseases the Symptoms of which\r\n        resemble those the result of Narcotic Poisoning, together with\r\n        such points of difference as may assist in distinguishing the\r\n        one from the other:\r\n\r\nNarcotic Poisoning.--Giddiness, headache, drowsiness, and considerable\r\ndifficulty in keeping awake. Paralysis of the muscles, convulsions,\r\nending in profound coma and death. The symptoms of narcotic poisoning\r\nbegin not later than an hour, or at most two hours, after the poison\r\nis taken, except in the case of poisonous fungi and spurred rye, when\r\na day or two may elapse. The symptoms of narcotic poisoning advance\r\ngradually. The person may, in _most_ cases, be roused from the deepest\r\nlethargy. The pupil in opium poisoning is, as a rule, _contracted_.\r\nRecovery seldom occurs after twelve hours; in most cases, death takes\r\nplace in six or eight hours--the shortest time being three hours.\r\n\r\nApoplexy.--In some cases apoplexy is preceded by warning\r\nsymptoms--headache and giddiness. As a rule apoplexy is a disease of\r\nold age, and of stout, plethoric people. If the symptoms do not come\r\non for some hours after food or drink has been taken, this disease is\r\nto be suspected; but it may occur _at_ or _immediately_ after a meal,\r\ntoo soon to be the result of the action of narcotics--ten to thirty\r\nminutes always elapsing before these poisons act. Apoplexy generally\r\ncomes on suddenly, coma at once present. It is seldom possible to rouse\r\nthe person when the sopor of apoplexy is fully developed. The pupils in\r\napoplexy are _usually unequal or dilated_; but should the effusion of\r\nblood take place into the pons Varolii, the pupils may be contracted,\r\nhence closely simulating opium poisoning. Apoplexy may last for days,\r\nor death may occur in an hour.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy.--Loss of consciousness and presence of convulsions mark this\r\ndisease; and in these it resembles poisoning by prussic acid. Epilepsy\r\nis in most cases a chronic disease. Warnings--_aura epileptica_--are\r\noften present. The fit begins violently and abruptly. The paroxysm\r\ngenerally lasts for some time, and death rarely occurs during the first\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n     Table showing Points of Difference in the Action of\r\n     Corrosive and Irritant Poisons\r\n\r\n    ------------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n                 Corrosives.            |               Irritants.\r\n    ------------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n     1.

To remove the poison from the digestive tract, or neutralise it or\r\nrender it insoluble by the administration of suitable antidotes.\r\n\r\n2. To overcome the effects of that which has been absorbed.\r\n\r\n3. To promote its elimination.\r\n\r\n4. To alleviate dangerous symptoms, and endeavour to keep the patient\r\nalive until the effects of the poison have passed off.\r\n\r\nTo forcibly empty the stomach, emetics may be administered or other\r\nmeans used to induce vomiting, or the stomach pump or tube may be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nSuitable emetics are sulphate of zinc in thirty-grain doses dissolved\r\nin warm water, a dessert-spoonful of mustard in half a pint of warm\r\nwater, ipecacuanha wine in tablespoonful doses, copious draughts of hot\r\nwater. Tartar emetic and sulphate of copper should be avoided, except\r\nin cases of phosphorus poisoning, when the latter may be used. The\r\nhypodermic injection of ⅒ grain of apomorphine is a very useful emetic,\r\nespecially in cases of narcotic poisoning. Irritation of the fauces\r\nwith the finger or a feather promotes vomiting, and may be useful in\r\nthe absence of an emetic.\r\n\r\nThe stomach tube or pump is most useful in that it is under the\r\ncontrol of the operator and enables him to thoroughly wash out the\r\nstomach. After passing the tube, previously lubricated with vaseline\r\nor glycerine, through the œsophagus down to the stomach, a pint of warm\r\nwater should be first injected before withdrawing any of the contents.\r\nBy alternate injection of water and its withdrawal, the stomach may\r\nbe efficiently cleansed, and at the same time solutions of suitable\r\nantidotes may be passed into it. It must be remembered that neither\r\nthe stomach pump, syphon tube, nor emetics, are to be used in cases of\r\npoisoning with corrosives, with the exception of carbolic acid. The\r\ntube should be used with great caution in cases of irritant poisoning.\r\n\r\nAntidotes are remedies which counteract the effects of poisons. They\r\nact mechanically, _e.g._ flour and water, chalk mixture; chemically,\r\nas magnesia and chalk in mineral acid poisoning, alkaline sulphates in\r\nlead and barium poisoning; and physiologically, as antagonists, such\r\nas morphine and atropine, atropine and physostigmine, strychnine and\r\nchloral hydrate.\r\n\r\nTo counteract the effects of the portion of the poison absorbed,\r\nspecial treatment is necessary: purges and diuretics may be called for;\r\nartificial respiration may be necessary; cardiac depressants require\r\ncardiac stimulants; the cold douche as a restorative and external\r\nwarmth are desirable in certain cases. Sedatives may be administered\r\nto alleviate convulsive seizures. Tracheotomy may be required in cases\r\nwith laryngeal complications; and pain, exhaustion, excessive vomiting\r\nor purging are to be treated by appropriate remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE STOMACH, VISCERA, ETC., FOR POISON\r\n\r\nThe number and condition of the vessels received should be noted and\r\ncopies made of any affixed labels.\r\n\r\nThe appearance, smell, colour, and reaction to test paper of the\r\ncontents should be noted, and their weights and volumes determined.\r\nAll jars, wrappers, labels, and seals should be preserved for future\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nThe stomach contents should be carefully examined in reference to their\r\nnature, colour, and smell, and the presence or absence of any abnormal\r\nconstituents. The mucous membrane of the stomach should be examined\r\nwith the naked eye and by the aid of a lens, the surface washed with\r\ndistilled water, and the washings added to the contents.\r\n\r\nThere is often some clue as to the nature of the poison afforded, and\r\nthe investigation should be made for it first; the presence or absence\r\nof other poisons, however, must be determined. If there be no clue,\r\nthen a systematic examination must be carried out. The poison must be\r\nlooked for not only in the contents of the stomach, but in the viscera\r\nas well; it must be remembered that poison may be introduced into the\r\nstomach after death.\r\n\r\nVolatile poisons, such as alcohol, chloroform, prussic acid, may be\r\nseparated by distillation after acidulation with tartaric acid. Arsenic\r\nis best separated by drying the organic material, and distilling after\r\nadding strong hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nOther metallic poisons may be tested for, with or without destruction\r\nof organic matter. To destroy the organic matter, the _moist method_\r\nis the one in general use: After reducing the contents of the stomach\r\nor the viscus to a pulp, they are mixed with distilled water to the\r\nconsistency of thin gruel, and placed in a flask with some crystals\r\nof potassium chlorate--half an ounce to each pound of the liquid.\r\nPure hydrochloric acid is added, and the flask gently heated on a\r\nwater bath, a mixture of chlorine and oxides of chlorine is given off\r\nand gradually breaks up the organic matter, converting at the same\r\ntime any mineral poison present into the chloride. This procedure is\r\nfollowed until the material becomes quite limpid, more chlorate or\r\nhydrochloric acid may be added if necessary. It is then transferred to\r\nan evaporating dish and heated on the water bath until the smell of\r\nchlorine disappears. It is then filtered while hot, to allow chloride\r\nif present to pass through; a stream of sulphur dioxide is passed\r\nthrough the filtrate when cold, to reduce any metals present to a lower\r\nstate of oxidation. Silver chloride will not pass through the filter in\r\nthis process, so it has to be dealt with in a special manner.\r\n\r\nIn making a systematic analysis, volatile poisons must be tested for\r\nfirst, then ascertain the presence or absence of alkaloids, after which\r\nthe inorganic poisons must be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--CHEMICAL\r\n\r\nCORROSIVE POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERAL ACIDS\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--The mineral acids have no remote effects on the\r\nsystem; their action is purely local. They are seldom used for the\r\npurpose of homicide, except in the case of young children. By suicides\r\nthey are more frequently employed.\r\n\r\nThe _Symptoms_ common to the action of these acids supervene\r\n_immediately_ the acid is swallowed, and consist in a sensation of\r\nburning in the mouth and gullet. Dreadful pain is felt in the stomach,\r\nattended with constant eructations, and vomiting of a brownish or\r\nblackish matter, mixed with blood. Mucus, together with, in severe\r\ncases, portions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, may be detected\r\nin the vomited matters, which have an intensely acid reaction, changing\r\nthe colour and destroying the texture of cloth or other material on\r\nwhich they may fall. The act of swallowing is attended with intense\r\npain, and not infrequently is rendered quite impossible. The thirst\r\nis intense, the bowels are confined, and the urine is diminished\r\nin quantity. The pulse is small and weak, and the skin clammy and\r\ncold. Respiration is performed with difficulty, and the countenance\r\nexpresses the most intense anxiety. Sometimes, when the upper part of\r\nthe windpipe is implicated, there is more or less cough and difficulty\r\nof speech. Death may even result from suffocation--the skin, in this\r\ncase, presenting a cyanosed appearance. The mouth is excoriated, the\r\nlips shrivelled and blistered. In children, when the acid has been\r\npoured far back into the mouth, by forcing the bottle backwards before\r\nemptying it of its contents, the mouth may more or less escape injury,\r\nand the signs in it of corrosive poisoning be absent. The teeth may\r\nbecome loose, and fall out of the mouth. The mental faculties remain\r\nclear, death generally coming on suddenly, the patient dying convulsed\r\nor suffocated. The period at which death ensues is very variable, and\r\nconsiderable power for locomotion may be retained by the sufferer,\r\nthough, as a rule, he is found writhing in exquisite agony on the floor\r\nor elsewhere. Some cases recover, leaving the coats of the stomach more\r\nor less injured, and the general health greatly impaired.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The body externally is healthy. The lips\r\nand external parts of the body, which have come in contact with the\r\nacid, are charred. The mucous membrane of the mouth, shrivelled and\r\neroded, is whitish, yellowish, or brownish, sometimes appearing “as\r\nif it had been smeared with white paint” or thin arrowroot. Many of\r\nthe appearances above described will depend upon the rapidity with\r\nwhich death has followed the swallowing of the poison. The mouth,\r\ngullet, and trachea may alone show any signs of the corrosive action of\r\nthe poison, and it is important to remember that death may be due to\r\nsulphuric acid, and yet the acid may never have reached the stomach.\r\nIn one or two cases where the poison was poured into the mouth during\r\nsleep, and in the case of children in whom the mouth was held open,\r\nthere were no signs of the poison on the lips, and the mouth even\r\nescaped in one or two cases. The stomach, in some cases more or less\r\ncontracted and perforated by the corroding action of the acid, may\r\ncontain a dark grumous liquid, the acidity of which will depend upon\r\nthe treatment adopted, or the length of time that may have elapsed from\r\nthe swallowing of the acid to the fatal termination. The stomach also\r\nappears as if carbonised, this being due to the action of the acid on\r\nthe effused blood; no such appearance being produced when sulphuric\r\nacid is poured into the dead stomach. Corrosive action may be found in\r\nthe duodenum. In cases where the patient has survived from sixteen to\r\ntwenty hours, the small intestines have been found inflamed. The blood,\r\nCasper states, is never fluid in acute poisoning by sulphuric acid,\r\nbut always “syrupy at least, and sometimes ropy; it has a cherry-red\r\ncolour, and acid reaction.” Sulphuric acid is also said to possess\r\npowerful antiseptic properties, and that bodies of those who have died\r\nfrom its effects remain long fresh.\r\n\r\nThere are two things which may render the diagnosis difficult--(1)\r\nGastric ulcer. (2) _Post-mortem_ digestion of the stomach.\r\n\r\nGastric ulcers vary in size from that of a threepenny-piece to that\r\nof a florin, or larger. In shape they are round or oval, and present\r\nthe appearance of shallow but level pits, with sharp, smooth, vertical\r\nedges--appearing as if they had been punched out. The peritoneal\r\nopening is smaller than that on the internal surface of the stomach.\r\nThe absence of injury to the mouth and gullet will distinguish gastric\r\nulcer and _post-mortem_ softening from the action of corrosive poisons.\r\n\r\n_General Treatment._--Chalk, carbonate of magnesia, bicarbonate of\r\nsoda, the plaster from the walls or ceiling of the apartment stirred in\r\nwater, and followed by diluent drinks--barley water, linseed tea, &c.\r\nThe use of the stomach pump is contra-indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHURIC ACID\r\n\r\n_Forms._--Sulphuric acid occurs in two forms--_concentrated_ and\r\n_diluted_.\r\n\r\n_Characters._--Concentrated sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol (specific\r\ngravity, 1.800 to 1.845), as it is found in commerce, is a heavy, oily,\r\ncolourless, or slightly brownish-coloured liquid, not fuming when\r\nexposed to the atmosphere; but, when added to water, causing a rapid\r\nincrease of temperature, which may crack the glass vessel in which\r\nthe mixture is made. Sulphuric acid chars and destroys the texture of\r\norganic bodies placed in it. _Dilute sulphuric acid_ is a colourless,\r\nstrongly acid liquid, reddening litmus, and charring paper dipped into\r\nit when subsequently dried, care being taken not to scorch the paper.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms, &c._--The symptoms and _post-mortem_ signs have been already\r\ndescribed, p. 246.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis and Tests._--The acid will have to be examined under\r\nthe following heads: (1) Simple, concentrated acid. (2) Dilute acid.\r\n(3) Mixed with organic liquids, food, vomit, &c. (4) On the clothes of\r\nthe person injured.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Concentrated Acid\r\n\r\n1. _Chars Organic Matter._--A piece of wood or paper placed in the\r\nstrong acid rapidly becomes blackened.\r\n\r\n2. _Heat when added to Water._--Equal quantities of acid and water\r\nadded together produce intense heat.\r\n\r\n3. _Evolution of Sulphurous Acid._--When boiled with chips of wood,\r\ncopper cuttings, or mercury, fumes of sulphurous acid are evolved,\r\ndetected by their sulphur-like odour, and by their power of first\r\nbluing and then bleaching starched paper dipped in iodic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Dilute Acid\r\n\r\n1. _Chars Paper._--This only occurs when the paper is dried by the aid\r\nof heat, subsequently to moistening it in the dilute acid.\r\n\r\n2. _Precipitation of Sulphate of Barium._--A solution of the nitrate or\r\nof the chloride of barium is precipitated by sulphuric acid in the form\r\nof a white insoluble powder, unaffected by nitric or hydrochloric acid,\r\neven when heat is applied. This test is so delicate, that a liquid\r\ncontaining ¹/₂₅₀₀₀th part by weight of the acid is precipitated by\r\neither of the test solutions.\r\n\r\n3. _Action of Heat._--The dilute acid is entirely volatilised by heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Mixed with Organic Liquids, &c.\r\n\r\nIn tea, coffee, or beer the mode of applying the tests are the same,\r\nthe mixture being previously filtered, or the acid separated from the\r\norganic mixture by dialysis, or the following cautions are necessary:\r\n\r\n_Objection A._--Alum, or any acid sulphate, would give all the\r\nreactions with the nitrate and chloride of barium.\r\n\r\n_Answer A._--Evaporate a portion of the doubtful liquid; if pure acid,\r\nthere will be no residue, sometimes only the _slightest trace_ of\r\nsulphate of lead.\r\n\r\n_Objection B._--Erroneous estimation of free sulphuric acid, in\r\nconsequence of the presence of some saline or neutral sulphates.\r\n\r\n_Answer B._--Evaporate as before. The free sulphuric acid separated\r\nby warming the liquid is then added to a known weight of powdered\r\ncarbonate of baryta until effervescence ceases. The resulting\r\nprecipitate when weighed, represents the free sulphuric acid present.\r\n\r\nCalculate in the following manner--\r\n\r\n    BaCO₃ + H₂SO₄ = BaSO₄ + H₂O + CO₂.\r\n            BaCO₃ = 197.\r\n            H₂SO₄ = 98.\r\n              CO₂ = 44.\r\n\r\nIn the above equation, 98 parts of H₂SO₄ take the place of 44 parts of\r\nCO₂. If, therefore, 100 grains of BaCO₃ renders the liquid neutral,\r\nthe amount of free SO₄ present will be represented by the increased\r\nweight of the precipitate in the proportion of 54 to 98, the difference\r\nbetween 44 and 98 the equivalent of CO₂ + SO₄.\r\n\r\nTo extract the acid from organic mixtures, digestion with alcohol is\r\nrequired: filter and neutralise the filtrate with caustic potash,\r\nevaporate to dryness, and dissolve the residue in distilled water\r\nacidulated with hydrochloric acid; the previous tests may then be\r\napplied. Extraction with alcohol leaves behind combined acid in the\r\nform of sulphates. The presence of free acid in the filtrate or\r\noriginal mixture may be detected by the change of tropæolin solution\r\nfrom yellow to crimson or ruby colour when added to it; or on adding a\r\nfew drops of the mixture or filtrate to a solution of potassio-tartrate\r\nof iron B.P. in water, so as to make it of a yellow tinge, and to which\r\npotassium sulphocyanide has been added, the liquid changes from a\r\nyellow to a port-wine colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Stains on the Clothes, &c.\r\n\r\n1. The strong acid changes the colour of black woollen cloth to a dirty\r\nbrown, the edges of the spots assuming a reddish tint after a few days.\r\nThe dilute acid on the same cloth produces a red stain, which in time\r\nbecomes brown.\r\n\r\n2. The spots made by the strong acid remain damp for some time--strong\r\nsulphuric acid, having a great affinity for water, continually absorbs\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3. The spot should be cut out, boiled in distilled water, or digested\r\nwith alcohol, filtered and tested for free sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n4. A portion of the cloth not touched by the acid should be tested, in\r\norder to show that the sulphuric acid found is not due to sulphates\r\npresent in the cloth.\r\n\r\n5. An acid sulphate--bisulphate of potash--gives a reddish stain to\r\nblack cloth like that produced by the dilute acid. Test for this salt\r\nby incineration.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Average time before death ensues is from two to\r\ntwenty-four hours. The shortest time was one hour, but in children\r\ndeath may be instantaneous. Life, however, may be prolonged for some\r\nweeks, or even months.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One drachm in a healthy adult has proved fatal; on the\r\nother hand, however, four ounces have been swallowed without being\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As before mentioned.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--This acid in past years has given rise to several actions, it\r\nhaving been employed to disfigure the person by throwing it in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRIC ACID\r\n\r\n_Forms._--Strong nitric acid, and dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Characters._--This acid is commonly known as _aqua fortis_, or red\r\nspirit of nitre. It is seldom used as a poison.\r\n\r\nThe _strong acid_ varies in colour from a pale yellow to a deep\r\norange. The colour is due to admixture with peroxide of nitrogen. On\r\n_cloth_ and _articles of dress_ it produces _yellow stains_, which are\r\ndarkened by the application of an alkali. If poured on copper cuttings,\r\nreddish fumes of nitrous acid are given off. _Dilute nitric acid_ is\r\na colourless acid liquid, not precipitated by nitrate of barium or\r\nnitrate of silver, showing absence of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids.\r\nAll its alkaline salts are soluble in water.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms have been before described, and are similar\r\nto those produced by sulphuric acid, though not quite so severe. The\r\n_vapour_ of this acid has caused death in eleven hours by congestion of\r\nthe bronchial tubes and lungs; care should, therefore, always be taken\r\nnot to inhale the fumes given off by the acid in the manufacture of\r\ngun-cotton, &c.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Same as the mineral acids generally, but\r\nthe tissues touched are turned yellow, and if bile be in the stomach it\r\nis turned green. The stomach is rarely perforated.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Nitric, like sulphuric, acid will be examined\r\nunder four heads; but being a volatile acid, easily decomposed, and\r\nalso having its nature changed by contact with organic substances, its\r\npresence on clothes may fail to be detected after a few weeks. The\r\ncolour of the stain on cloth may also remain, although the acid has\r\nbeen entirely removed by washing. 1. Strong, concentrated acid. 2.\r\nDilute acid. 3. Mixed with organic liquids, &c. 4. On the clothes of\r\nthe person injured.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Concentrated Acid\r\n\r\n1. _Volatility._--When exposed to the atmosphere, strong nitric acid\r\ngives off colourless or orange-coloured acid fumes. Heated in a\r\nwatch-glass, it is evaporated without residue.\r\n\r\n2. _Action on Organic Matter._--The acid leaves on woollen clothes\r\na _yellow-coloured stain_, which is darkened by the addition of an\r\nalkali. The colour of the stain is due to the formation of picric acid.\r\n\r\n3. _Action on Metals._--Gently heated in a test tube with copper\r\nfilings, orange-coloured fumes are given off, which redden but do not\r\nbleach litmus paper. Starch paper treated with iodide of potassium\r\nbecomes purple.\r\n\r\n4. _Solution of Gold._--If a small portion of gold leaf be put into\r\nthe acid, no effect is produced; but on the addition of concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid, the metal is rapidly dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Dilute Acid\r\n\r\n1. Absence of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, proved by no\r\nprecipitate being formed with nitrate of barium and nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n2. It does not char paper when the paper is heated, as is the case with\r\nsulphuric and hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\n3. If a piece of filtering paper be dipped into a solution of the acid\r\nsaturated with carbonate of potash, dried and ignited, it will burn\r\nlike touch-paper.\r\n\r\n4. The acid liquid, saturated with carbonate of potash and evaporated,\r\ndeposits _fluted_ prisms which do not effloresce or deliquesce on\r\nexposure. Neutralised with soda, the crystals are of a _rhombic_ form.\r\n\r\n5. A crystal, so formed, moistened with distilled water on a plate, and\r\nthen heated with strong sulphuric acid and allowed to cool, gives with--\r\n\r\n    (1) A piece of _green sulphate of iron_--a dark green\r\n        ring round the crystal.\r\n    (2) A small portion of _morphia_--a rich orange colour,\r\n        a yellow liquid being formed.\r\n    (3) A small portion of _brucine_--a blood-red colour.\r\n\r\n6. If an aqueous solution of diphenylamine be added to a solution\r\ncontaining nitric acid, in a test tube, and pure sulphuric acid be\r\npoured down the side of the tube to form a layer at the bottom, a blue\r\ncolour forms at the junction of the two liquids.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Mixed with Organic Liquids, &c.\r\n\r\nDue to the measures employed by way of treatment the vomited matters\r\nmay be neutral and yet nitric acid be present. The method adopted\r\nwith viscid and turbid organic mixtures is to dilute them with pure\r\nwater, and then filter. If the filtrate be acid, it is neutralised with\r\ncarbonate of potash, evaporated, and then set aside to crystallise,\r\nand the crystals purified by digesting them in ether or alcohol. The\r\ncrystals are again dissolved and re-crystallised. The tests just\r\nmentioned should then be employed. It should be remembered that nitric\r\nacid has a strong tendency to combine with solid organic structures,\r\nand to become decomposed. The parts of the body stained by the acid\r\nshould, therefore, be digested in water at a gentle heat, the liquid\r\ncooled, filtered, and neutralised with carbonate of potash, and then\r\nexamined for nitre.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Stains on the Clothes, &c.\r\n\r\nMacerate the piece of cloth in distilled water by the aid of heat. If\r\nthe solution be acid, neutralise with carbonate of potash, and filter.\r\nTest the solution as before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe action of the dilute solution of caustic potash on the following\r\nstains on cloth is characteristic: Nitric acid stain becomes of a clear\r\norange tint. Iodine stain disappears. Bile stain remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death may take place in an hour and a half, or life\r\nmay be prolonged for some months.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Two drachms; recovery has taken place after half a fluid\r\nounce of the strong acid has been taken.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As before mentioned when speaking of the acids generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCHLORIC ACID\r\n\r\n_Forms._--Strong and the dilute acid. It is known as muriatic acid, or\r\nspirits of salts.\r\n\r\n_Characters._--_Strong hydrochloric acid_ is either colourless or has\r\na bright yellow tint, due to the presence of the perchloride of iron.\r\nIt fumes in the air, and gives rise to dense white fumes when a glass\r\nrod moistened with ammonia is held over the surface of the acid. The\r\n_dilute acid_ is colourless.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Poisoning with muriatic acid is so rare that the symptoms\r\nhave not been well studied, but they do not appear to differ much from\r\nthose produced by the action of the other acids. It does not stain the\r\nskin, but may darken the mucous membranes. The fumes are apt to attack\r\nthe air-passages.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The acid will have to be examined under the\r\nfollowing heads: 1. Simple, concentrated acid. 2. Dilute acid. 3. Mixed\r\nwith organic liquids, food, &c. 4. On the clothes of the person injured.\r\n\r\nI. Concentrated Acid\r\n\r\n1. _Action on Organic Matter._--The strong acid tinges most organic\r\ntissues, when immersed in it, a _yellow colour_. The stains on black\r\ncloth are at first distinctly _red_, becoming reddish-brown after a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n2. _Action on Metals._--This acid does not act on copper or mercury,\r\neven when boiled with them, and this distinguishes it from the other\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n3. Hydrochloric acid, added to peroxide of manganese and then warmed,\r\ngives off chlorine gas, detected by its greenish-yellow colour and\r\nsuffocating odour. The vapour thus produced bleaches litmus paper,\r\nand causes a blue coloration on starch paper moistened with iodide of\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\nII. Dilute Acid\r\n\r\n1. Decomposes alkaline carbonates, chlorides being formed which, when\r\nheated in the solid state with strong sulphuric acid and peroxide of\r\nmanganese, evolve chlorine gas, known by the before-mentioned tests.\r\n\r\n2. _Precipitation of Chloride of Silver._--A white curdled precipitate\r\nof chloride of silver is thrown down when a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver is added to hydrochloric acid. This precipitate becomes grey\r\non exposure to light. If a portion of the precipitate be added to\r\nammonia it will dissolve; another portion, when boiled with nitric\r\nacid, is unaffected; and a third portion, ignited in a capsule, becomes\r\nconverted into a horny mass.\r\n\r\nIn any case where there is a doubt as to whether the hydrochloric\r\nacid exists in the free state, or is only present in the form of\r\nchlorides, the following test should be resorted to, which will not\r\nonly discriminate between the two forms, but give the relative amount\r\nof each present:\r\n\r\nTake two equal measures of the acid liquid. Precipitate one with\r\nnitrate of silver, after the addition of nitric acid, and weigh the\r\nprecipitate. Evaporate the second portion of the acid liquid to\r\ndryness, and dry the residue in a water bath; dissolve this residue\r\nin distilled water, and treat the solution with nitrate of silver as\r\nbefore, weighing any precipitate which occurs. The weight of chloride\r\nof silver obtained from the first portion of the liquid will give\r\nall the hydrochloric acid present, both in the free state and in\r\ncombination; while the weight of the silver precipitate in the second\r\nportion of liquid only gives the chlorides, all free--hydrochloric acid\r\nhaving passed off during the process of evaporation.\r\n\r\nIII. Mixed with Organic Liquids, &c.\r\n\r\nThe suspected acid liquid should be filtered, and then distilled\r\nalmost to dryness. The portion of the distillate which comes over at\r\nfirst may be thrown away; but the latter portion will give all the\r\nreactions before described for hydrochloric acid, if that be present.\r\nDistillation is adopted in the case of this acid, as it is more\r\nvolatile than either sulphuric or nitric acid. It may be objected that\r\nthe acid found in the vomited matters is from the gastric juice. In\r\nanswer to this, it may be stated that the free hydrochloric acid in\r\nnormal gastric juice is only about five grains in sixteen ounces, an\r\namount which would give but slight reaction with the tests.\r\n\r\nIV. Stains on the Clothes, &c.\r\n\r\nThe spots produced by the action of the acid on black cloth are at\r\nfirst of a _bright red_ colour, changing in ten or twelve days to\r\nreddish-brown. These spots may be cut out and macerated in warm water;\r\nthe liquid thus obtained then tested by nitrate of silver and the other\r\ntests before noticed. Another portion of the cloth should be treated\r\nin the same manner, and the resulting liquid tested, as a control\r\nagainst the objection that the acid might have been present in the\r\ncloth. Hydrochloric acid has been used to erase writing from paper in\r\nattempts at forgery, &c. The paper must be treated in the same manner\r\nas mentioned for the cloth, and the tests used. Sometimes oxalic acid\r\nis employed for a like purpose, in which case the nitrate of silver\r\nwill give a precipitate; but the oxalate of silver is soluble in nitric\r\nacid; the chloride is not soluble even when boiled.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From two or five hours to thirty hours or more.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One fluid drachm to one ounce; recovery has taken place\r\nafter swallowing two fluid ounces.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as for the other acids.\r\n\r\n      Table showing the Colour produced by the Action of\r\n             the Mineral Acids on the Skin and on Cloth\r\n    +-------------+----------------------+--------------------------+\r\n    |             |      Skin.           |        Cloth.            |\r\n    +-------------+----------------------+--------------------------+\r\n    |Sulphuric    |Brown colour.         |Dirty-brown edges becoming|\r\n    |  acid.      |                      |  red after a             |\r\n    |             |                      |  few days from absorption|\r\n    |             |                      |  of moisture.            |\r\n    |             |                      |                          |\r\n    |Nitric acid. |Bright yellow, due to |Yellow, orange-red, or    |\r\n    |             |  the formation of    |  brown.                  |\r\n    |             |  picric acid.

Used as a dye. The symptoms are much the same as those detailed\r\nunder sulphuric acid, with the additional bluing of the mouth and lips.\r\nIt may be detected with the tests given under sulphuric acid, the blue\r\ncolour being first discharged by boiling it with nitric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBOLIC ACID\r\n\r\nPhenol. Phenic Acid. Coal-tar Creosote. Oil of Tar\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is obtained in the dry distillation of coal, and forms\r\nthe acid portion of coal-tar oil, from which it is subsequently\r\nextracted by shaking the crude coal-tar oil with a mixture of slaked\r\nlime and water. After allowing the mixture to stand for some time,\r\nthe watery portion is separated from the undissolved oil, the former\r\ntreated with hydrochloric acid, and the resulting oily fluid purified\r\nby careful distillation. Up to the year 1900 no restrictions were\r\nput upon the sale of carbolic acid, but owing to the large number\r\nof suicidal and accidental deaths from its use, it was by Act of\r\nParliament scheduled as a poison, and all preparations containing more\r\nthan 3 per cent. of it, cresylic acid, or their homologues, must be\r\nsold as poisons.\r\n\r\nPure carbolic acid forms long, colourless, prismatic needles, which\r\nmelt at 35° C. into an oily liquid. It boils at 180° C., and greatly\r\nresembles creosote, for which it is very frequently substituted in\r\ncommerce, but from which it differs in the following characters:\r\nIt does not affect polarised light as creosote does; it forms a\r\njelly-like mass with collodion, and is soluble in a solution of\r\npotash, whereas creosote is unaffected by collodion, and is insoluble\r\nin a solution of potash. It possesses a penetrating, characteristic\r\nodour; burning taste; is slightly soluble in water, but freely so in\r\nglycerine, ether, and alcohol; and gives no acid reaction to test\r\npaper. When undiluted, it attacks the skin, which it shrivels up.\r\n\r\nCreosote is obtained from wood-tar, which imparts to it its caustic\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid acts as a corrosive and anæsthetic on the skin and mucous\r\nmembranes, and as a narcotic on the brain. Its poisonous properties\r\nare exerted whether it be swallowed or merely applied to the skin,\r\nespecially if a wound be present.\r\n\r\n_Effects on the Skin, &c._--Strong carbolic acid, when applied to the\r\nskin, corrugates, hardens, and destroys its sensibility, and is said\r\nto whiten it; though in one case, in which the crude acid had been\r\ntaken with a suicidal intent, there was after death a dark brownish\r\nring about half an inch wide surrounding the mouth; and in another,\r\nthat of a child who, in climbing to a shelf, poured over its face and\r\nneck about half a saucerful of diluted acid, the colour of the skin\r\ntouched by the acid was yellowish-white and yellowish-brown, dry and\r\nparchment-like. The action of the acid on the mucous membranes is\r\nsimilar to that on the skin, but the corrugation is more marked, and\r\nconsiderable softening and peeling may also take place.\r\n\r\n_Effects on the Nervous System._--Rapidly supervening stupor, total\r\nmuscular relaxation, anæsthesia, and stertorous breathing are among\r\nthe most prominent symptoms. Nearly all the sufferers die comatose.\r\nCarbolic acid appears to act principally on the central nervous ganglia\r\nat the base of the brain and on the spinal cord. The evidence is more\r\nin favour of its action on the brain than on the spinal cord, and not\r\nat all on the periphery of the nerves. The muscles contract vigorously\r\nafter death, in response to galvanic stimulation applied either to the\r\nnerves or to the muscles themselves.\r\n\r\n_Effects on the Circulation._--The action of carbolic acid on the\r\ncirculation has not yet been fully worked out, but it appears to be a\r\ncardiac depressant, the heart being arrested in diastole.\r\n\r\n_General Symptoms._--As soon as the acid is swallowed, the patient\r\ncomplains of intense burning pain in the mouth, throat, and stomach,\r\nthe pupils are contracted, the conjunctiva insensible to touch, the\r\nskin cold and clammy, the temperature rapidly falls, and the pulse\r\nbecomes weaker and weaker, till it is almost imperceptible. The\r\nbreathing is laboured, and, as the fatal issue approaches, becomes\r\nstertorous; vomiting of frothy mucus occurs in some cases. The invasion\r\nof the symptoms is most rapid, and many of the patients have been\r\nin an insensible condition when found. The above symptoms have even\r\nsupervened when the strong acid has been used for dressing wounds.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Hamilton records a case where the acid was used as an\r\napplication to a wound four inches long, in a child four and a half\r\nyears of age. Direct contact of the acid with the wound was prevented.\r\nAbout an hour after the dressing was applied he saw the patient, who\r\nwas then supposed to be suffering from the effects of chloroform\r\nused during the operation on the child‘s arm. She was suffering from\r\nsymptoms like those before described. On removing the dressing, some\r\nof the carbolic acid, it was found, had melted and run into the wound,\r\nand to this Dr. Hamilton attributed the symptoms. The child ultimately\r\ndied. (See _British Medical Journal_, 1873, vol. i. p. 226.)\r\n\r\nThe urine and fæces, when passed, are of a dark colour, and it has\r\nbeen frequently noticed that the urine passed by the assistants in\r\nsurgical hospitals, who, under the antiseptic methods adopted, are\r\nconstantly washing their hands in solutions of carbolic acid, is of\r\nan olive-green colour. This shows that absorption takes place readily\r\nthrough the skin. Bilroth, in his work on _Clinical Surgery_, gives\r\nseveral instances of absorption in this way. Nephritis with casts in\r\nthe urine may occur. The hypodermic administration of carbolic acid,\r\ntwelve to twenty-four grains in a day, has failed in five cases under\r\nmy observation to be followed by carboluria.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--If the poison has been drunk, a dark\r\nbrownish horny rim may be found soon after death round the lips; the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and stomach is whitened, corrugated, and\r\nsoftened, and looks as if smeared with white lead--in some cases, horny\r\nin patches; inflammatory signs being absent or only slightly visible.\r\nThe blood is uniformly fluid, becoming a bright red on exposure. The\r\nsmell of carbolic acid is detected in the stomach, and sometimes in\r\nthe small intestine, and even in the spleen, liver, and kidneys. In\r\nDr. Ferrier‘s case, the urine found in the bladder after death had a\r\nslight olive-greenish tint with a peculiar mixed odour, which gave the\r\nusual reactions to the tests for carbolic acid. The dark colour of the\r\nurine is not due to the presence of hæmin, as the urine, in poisoning\r\nby carbolic acid, does not contain more than a normal amount of iron;\r\nthe colour is, therefore, probably due to some product formed by the\r\npartial oxidation of the acid as hydroquinone. Signs of nephritis may\r\nbe present. The left ventricle of the heart is, in most cases, found\r\ncontracted, the right flaccid. The lungs are congested, and this may\r\nalso be the case with the vessels of the brain; but there may be an\r\nentire absence of any _post-mortem signs_ to point to the probable\r\ncause of death, where the poison has gained entrance through a wound\r\nwhen the acid has been used as a surgical dressing.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Carbolic acid may be separated from mixture\r\nwith organic substances by distillation with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nfrom urine by agitation with ether. Bromine water, as recommended\r\nby Landolt, gives a bulky yellowish precipitate of tribromo-phenol.\r\nThe precipitate should then be collected, well washed, and gently\r\nwarmed in a test tube with sodium-amalgam and water. The liquid poured\r\ninto a dish and acidulated, will, if phenol be present, give the\r\ncharacteristic odour of that substance, and it may be seen floating\r\nin the liquid as an oily fluid. By this test, one part of phenol in\r\n43,700 of water may be detected. It must be remembered that, according\r\nto Landolt, carbolic acid is normally present in the urine, but\r\nHoppe Seyler contends that it is not originally present in urine,\r\nbut is formed by the action of sulphuric acid, probably from indican.\r\nCarbolic acid urine, treated with nitric acid, and then with potassæ,\r\nand concentrated, becomes blood-red, brown-red, and then changes from\r\npea-green to violet. Carbolic acid mixed with urine does not give the\r\nabove reactions (Schmidt‘s _Jahrbücher_, Bd. clxiv. p. 144).\r\n\r\nA solution of carbolic acid, mixed with one-fourth of its volume of\r\nammonia and a few drops of bleaching powder solution (1 in 20 of\r\nwater), and then warmed, but not boiled, assumes a blue colour (green\r\nin very dilute solutions), becoming red on the addition of sulphuric or\r\nhydrochloric acid. The perchloride of iron gives a violet colour with\r\ncarbolic acid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has occurred in three minutes; also delayed to\r\nsixty hours; usually three to four hours.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One drachm has caused death in twelve hours. A child\r\nsix months old died from the effects of a quarter of a teaspoonful of\r\na solution of one part of the acid to five of glycerine. Recovery has\r\ntaken place after an ounce of 90 per cent. strength liquefied acid,\r\nalso after four ounces of the crude acid; after six ounces of the crude\r\nacid, 14 per cent. strength; and in a child of two after half an ounce\r\nof crude acid of 30 per cent. strength.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stomach pump. Wash out the stomach with equal quantities\r\nof alcohol and water mixed--whisky, brandy, gin, or rum will do until\r\nabsolute alcohol or rectified spirit be obtained. The washing should be\r\nrepeated every 5 to 15 minutes from four to eight times; apomorphine\r\nhydrochlorate gr. ⅒ should be given hypodermically at the commencement,\r\nand the administration of demulcent drinks. Emetics are of little\r\nor no use, owing to the anæsthesia of the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach. The sulphate of soda, Glauber salts, has been proposed as an\r\nantidote. Any soluble sulphate may be tried. Oil or vinegar is the best\r\noutward application to the skin, after washing with spirit of wine or\r\nmethylated spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXALIC ACID\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful corrosive and cardiac poison, but on account of its\r\nstrongly acid taste it is ill-adapted for the purposes of the murderer.\r\nDeaths have not infrequently followed the accidental substitution of\r\nthis substance for Epsom salts--sulphate of magnesia--which it somewhat\r\nclosely resembles.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary crystals of oxalic acid are in the form of four-sided\r\nprisms, colourless, transparent, odourless, or with a slight acid\r\nsmell, very acid taste, and not deliquescent in the air. It is\r\nlargely used in the arts, by brass-polishers, straw-bonnet makers,\r\nbook-binders, and others. The acid is also used to remove writing-ink\r\nfrom parchment, paper, &c., for the purposes of forgery, &c.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These present many strange anomalies. In a large dose--an\r\nounce or more--oxalic acid acts as a corrosive; in a smaller, as\r\nan irritant; and in a still smaller dose, as a cardiac sedative.\r\nDeath has been known to occur so rapidly as to prevent any attempt\r\nat treatment. When the dose is large, an acid taste is experienced\r\nduring swallowing, followed by burning pain in the throat and stomach.\r\nVomiting then sets in, and in most cases continues till death, which\r\nmay, however, occur when this symptom has existed from the first.\r\nThe vomited matters may be simply mucus, mucus and blood, or dark\r\ncoffee-grounds-looking matter. Unless the case is protracted, the\r\nbowels are rarely much affected, though purging and tenesmus have been\r\nnoticed. Occult blood may be present in the fæces. Collapse now sets\r\nin; the pulse becomes feeble and scarcely perceptible, the skin cold\r\nand clammy, showing the action of the poison on the heart probably\r\nthrough the central nervous, as well as through the intra-cardiac\r\nganglia. Should the treatment adopted prove successful, and life be\r\nprolonged, the patient complains of tenderness of the mouth, soreness\r\nof the throat, and painful deglutition. Pressure over the abdomen\r\ncauses pain. Vomiting and purging are also frequently present; and if\r\nrecovery takes place, convalescence is generally very gradual. The\r\nurine may contain a large quantity of albumen, casts are numerous, and\r\noxalates in crystal form are present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of oxalic acid, ×\r\n50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nOxalic acid acts as a poison when applied to a wound in any part of the\r\nbody; and although this substance undoubtedly acts on the brain through\r\nthe medium of the blood, it is a remarkable fact that _it cannot be\r\ndetected in that fluid_, even when injected into the femoral vein of\r\nan animal which died in thirty seconds (Christison). Leeches, it is\r\nrecorded, have been poisoned by the blood drawn by them from persons\r\nsuffering from oxalic acid poisoning. The blood does not appear to\r\nundergo any physical change. Unlike the mineral acids, oxalic acid is\r\nstill poisonous even when its corrosive and irritant properties have\r\nbeen destroyed by dilution.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The mucous membrane of the mouth, tongue,\r\nand throat is corrugated, white, and softened. The tongue is sometimes\r\nof a brownish colour, and sordes appear on the teeth. The stomach is in\r\nsome cases pale, soft, and very brittle, and contains a dark, grumous,\r\nacid liquid; at other times it presents several semi-gelatinous spots,\r\nlooking as if they had been boiled. Enlarged blood-vessels filled\r\nwith dark-coloured blood are also seen ramifying over the internal\r\nsurface of the organ. Perforation is of rare occurrence. The intestines\r\ngenerally escape with some slight inflammatory redness, unless the case\r\nis unusually prolonged. In some cases the stomach is quite healthy, no\r\nmorbid appearance being found in any portion of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of oxalic acid, ×\r\n50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--From organic mixtures the acid may be separated\r\nby dialysis, and the tests applied, or it may be obtained in crystals\r\nby precipitating it from the boiled and filtered organic mixture\r\nwith acetate of lead. The precipitate washed is then decomposed by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and filtered, the filtrate concentrated to drive\r\noff excess of sulphuretted hydrogen, and then set aside to crystallise,\r\nwhich, if the acid be present, it does in slender prisms. From the\r\ncontents of the stomach the acid may be separated by partial drying\r\nover a water bath, extraction with hot alcohol acidulated with a little\r\nhydrochloric acid, filtering the alcoholic solution, evaporating to\r\ndryness, and dissolving the residue in water. Should, owing to the\r\ntreatment adopted, oxalate of lime in white chalky masses be found in\r\nthe stomach, these should be washed and then boiled with pure carbonate\r\nof potash. A partial decomposition takes place, insoluble carbonate of\r\nlime and soluble oxalate of potash are present in the liquid, which,\r\nwhen filtered and neutralised with nitric acid, may be tested with the\r\nfollowing reagents:\r\n\r\n1. _Nitrate of silver_ gives a white precipitate, _soluble_ in _cold_\r\nnitric acid; the precipitate dried and heated on platinum foil is\r\ndissipated in a white vapour with slight detonation.\r\n\r\n2. _Calcium chloride or sulphate_ produces a white precipitate with\r\noxalic acid; the test is more delicate if the acid be first neutralised\r\nwith ammonia. The precipitate is immediately dissolved by hydrochloric\r\nor nitric acid, but not dissolved by oxalic, tartaric, acetic, or other\r\nvegetable acid. Lime-water should not be used as a test, as it gives\r\nprecipitates with other acids; the sulphate largely diluted is not open\r\nto this objection.\r\n\r\n3. _Lead acetate_ gives a white precipitate soluble in nitric acid. On\r\nclothes, parchment, &c., the spot or spots must be well boiled, and\r\nthe above tests applied to the solution. The stains may vary from a\r\nbrownish-red to orange-red colour.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Three drachms have caused death in one hour; sixty\r\ngrains caused the death of a boy sixteen years of age, but recoveries\r\nhave been known to take place after an ounce and an ounce and a half\r\nhad been swallowed.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has resulted in _ten minutes_ from a dose of\r\n_one ounce_. The shortest period has been three minutes. The time\r\nvaries with individuals, even when the same quantity is taken. In the\r\ncase of two girls who each swallowed _an ounce_ of oxalic acid, one\r\ndied in _ten minutes_, and the other in _thirty minutes_. Death usually\r\ntakes place within from half an hour to an hour, although it has been\r\ndelayed for five days.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Water should not be given, as it increases the solubility\r\nof the acid, and thus assists in the more extensive absorption and\r\ndiffusion of the poison. The carbonates of potash and soda should be\r\navoided, as the oxalates of these alkalies _are themselves_ poisonous.\r\nThe stomach tube should not be used. Lime is the best antidote, as the\r\noxalate of lime is insoluble, and may be given in the form of common\r\n_whiting_; a pint of saccharated lime water may be given. Vomiting\r\nshould be promoted. In the stage of collapse the case must be treated\r\non general principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssential Salt of Lemons\r\n\r\nThe binoxalate of potash or salt of sorrel, or, as it is more commonly\r\nknown, salt of lemons, occurs as a constituent of many plants. The\r\ncommon sorrel--_Rumex acetosa_--contains it in large quantities.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Those of poisoning by oxalic acid, on which its poisonous\r\nproperties depend.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Inflammation of the stomach and intestines.\r\nOther appearances as in oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--See oxalic acid. The incinerated salt leaves a\r\nwhite residue of potassium carbonate; oxalic acid leaves no residue.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--_Eight minutes_ in the case of a lady recently\r\nconfined, who took half an ounce of the salt by mistake for cream of\r\ntartar.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Half an ounce.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as recommended for poisoning by oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n    Table showing Symptoms, Post-mortem Appearances, Fatal Dose,\r\n        Period of Death, and Treatment of Poisoning by\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n    |                         |        Sulphuric Acid.            |\r\n    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n    | _Symptoms_              |Burning pain in the mouth,         |\r\n    |                         |throat, and gullet.

Cases have been recorded of poisoning by the glacial acid.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The parts with which the acid has come in contact are\r\nsoftened and rendered yellowish-white in colour. The larynx is commonly\r\naffected by the acid, as it is very volatile.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances_ are those of corrosive poisoning with\r\ninflammatory action in the upper air-passages.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period_ is variable but rapid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One drachm caused death in a child, but recovery has\r\ntaken place in an adult after taking six fluid ounces.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Separate the free acid from organic matter by\r\ndistillation, if in combination it should be liberated by adding\r\nphosphoric acid. With ferric chloride and ammonia to neutralisation a\r\nred colour is produced, turned yellow by hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Magnesia should be given to neutralise the acid and\r\nvomiting produced. The laryngeal symptoms will require treating on\r\ngeneral principles; tracheotomy may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALKALIES\r\n\r\nPOTASH. SODA. AMMONIA\r\n\r\nPoisoning by the use of the alkalies is very rare. For the sake of\r\nconvenience, and as the symptoms produced by the caustic preparations\r\nof soda and potash, taken in large doses, do not greatly differ, one\r\ndescription will do for both:\r\n\r\n=Potash= is found in commerce as (1) caustic potash, either solid or in\r\nsolution; (2) carbonate and bicarbonate; (3) pearl-ash and soap-lees.\r\n\r\n=Soda= is found as (1) caustic soda; (2) carbonate (washing soda) and\r\nbicarbonate; (3) soap-lees, carbonate of soda mixed with caustic alkali.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Like the inorganic acids, the alkalies destroy\r\nthe animal tissues with which they come in contact. Their action is\r\nlocal, no specific remote effects being produced. They are seldom, if\r\never, used for the purpose of homicide; the deaths caused by them are\r\nin most cases the result of accident or suicide. When injected directly\r\ninto the veins of animals, the toxic action of potash and soda appears\r\nto differ, the former arresting the action of the heart in diastole,\r\nwhereas the latter, according to Podocaepow and Guttman, does not, even\r\nin large doses, affect the heart or temperature--Guttman, moreover,\r\nasserting that soda has no influence upon the nerve centres, the\r\nperipheral nerves, or the muscles. It is difficult to understand how,\r\nwith this asserted negative action, soda, like potash, causes death.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--During the act of swallowing, the patient complains of a\r\ncaustic taste, accompanied with a sensation of burning in the mouth and\r\nthroat, extending into the stomach. Vomiting may or may not be present;\r\nbut in severe cases, when it does occur, the vomited matters may be\r\nmixed with blood. The surface of the body is cold, and bathed in a cold\r\nsweat. Purging is generally present, accompanied with intense pain and\r\nstraining. The pulse is weak and quick, and the countenance anxious.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are inflammation and softening of the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth, gullet, and stomach, which may also be\r\ncovered with chocolate-coloured or black spots. When life has been\r\nprolonged for some months the stomach may become contracted, the\r\npyloric orifice scarcely admitting the passage of a fine probe.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The caustic alkalies are known from their\r\ncarbonates by giving a brown precipitate with nitrate of silver;\r\nwhereas their carbonates give a white, and also effervesce on the\r\naddition of an acid.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the reaction of these alkalies with\r\nreagents:\r\n\r\n    To distinguish Caustic Potash from Caustic Soda\r\n\r\n    +--------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+\r\n    |                    |        Potash.           |     Soda.       |\r\n    +--------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+\r\n    | Bichloride of      | A canary-coloured        | No precipitate. |\r\n    |      platinum.     |   precipitate            |                 |\r\n    |                    |   in solutions           |                 |\r\n    |                    |   acidulated with        |                 |\r\n    |                    |   hydrochloric acid.     |                 |\r\n    |                    |                          |                 |\r\n    | Strong solution of | Precipitate in granular  | No precipitate. |\r\n    |   tartaric acid.   |   white crystals.        |                 |\r\n    |                    |                          |                 |\r\n    | Colour given to    | Rose or lilac tint.      | Yellow tint.    |\r\n    |   flame.           |                          |                 |\r\n    |                    |                          |                 |\r\n    | Neutralised with   | Crystallises in long,    | Crystallises in |\r\n    |   nitric acid.     |   slender, fluted prisms.|  rhombic plates.|\r\n    +--------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n_In Organic Mixtures._--If the mixture be strongly alkaline, filter and\r\ntest as above.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From three hours to as many years.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--About half an ounce of the caustic alkali. The smallest\r\nfatal dose recorded of caustic potash is forty grains.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Water freely; drinks containing citric or acetic acid,\r\nvinegar, lemon juice, oil, linseed tea, and other demulcent drinks. The\r\nstomach tube should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA\r\n\r\nIn vapour, in solution, or solid.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The vapour may cause death by producing inflammation of\r\nthe larynx and lungs. The symptoms to which it gives rise are a feeling\r\nof choking, and a suspension of the power of breathing. Intense heat\r\nand pain are felt in the throat, which may remain for some time. When\r\nammonia is swallowed in solution, the symptoms produced are not unlike\r\nthose the result of the action of soda or potash, only more intense.\r\nDr. Patterson records the history of a case of a poor man who drank\r\nabout an ounce of the liquid ammonia. When seen, his lips were livid,\r\nbreathing stridulous, aspect anxious, extremities cold, pulse 100;\r\ninside of mouth, tongue, fauces, as far as visible, red, raw, and\r\nfiery-looking. He died suddenly, nineteen days after the accident, of\r\nlaryngeal spasm. Albuminuria occurred in one case.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are those found in most cases of\r\npoisoning by corrosives.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Ammonia can be separated from organic mixture by\r\ndistillation. Putrefaction must not have taken place. The vapour of\r\nammonia is easily set free and recognised by its pungent odour. The\r\ncarbonate effervesces when an acid is added to it, and gives a white\r\nprecipitate with salts of lime. Dense white fumes are given off in the\r\npresence of hydrochloric acid. Nessler‘s reagent gives a reddish-brown\r\ncolour or precipitate.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has been known to occur in _four minutes_, but\r\nlife may be prolonged for some time, the person dying of some thoracic\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--A teaspoonful of the strong solution.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Vinegar and water, lime-juice and oil, and leeches to\r\nthe throat if the inflammatory symptoms be severe. The rest of the\r\ntreatment will depend upon the symptoms present. Tracheotomy may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSTIC SALTS\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE OF ANTIMONY\r\n\r\nChloride of antimony (butter of antimony) is a corrosive liquid. The\r\ncolour varies from a light yellow to a dark red. Though a powerful\r\npoison, it is seldom taken for that purpose. It has been taken\r\nby mistake for ginger beer. On the addition of water, the white\r\noxychloride is precipitated.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms produced by swallowing this substance are\r\nthose of corrosive poisoning. The mouth and throat are excoriated, the\r\nskin cold and clammy, and the pulse feeble and quick. Severe pain is\r\nfelt in the stomach, and vomiting is incessant.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those found after corrosive poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--When poured into water, the chloride is\r\nprecipitated; the precipitate, soluble in tartaric acid, becomes\r\norange-red on the addition of hydrogen sulphide. The supernatant liquid\r\nwill give a white precipitate with nitrate of silver, showing the\r\npresence of hydrochloric acid. The salts of bismuth are precipitated by\r\nthe addition of water, but the precipitate is, unlike the antimonial,\r\ninsoluble in tartaric acid, and is blackened by hydrogen sulphide.\r\n\r\nFrom _organic_ liquids, the antimony may be obtained by boiling them\r\nwith tartaric acid, filtering, and then applying the tests for antimony.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_.--Milk, magnesia, and infusions containing tannin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE OF ZINC\r\n\r\nThis substance is a powerful corrosive. It is employed as a\r\ndisinfectant, and is sold to the public under the name of “Sir W.\r\nBurnett‘s Fluid.” This preparation, which is a strong solution of\r\nthe chloride of zinc, has caused death by being mistaken for “fluid\r\nmagnesia,” for “pale ale,” and in one case, on board one of the\r\nAmerican steamers, for “mineral water.” Chloride of zinc is also used\r\nin the treatment of cancer and other tumours as an external application.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms come on immediately after the poison is\r\nswallowed. Chloride of zinc acts as a powerful corrosive, accompanied\r\nwith all the symptoms which have been before described when speaking\r\nunder the head of corrosive poisons. The nervous system is also\r\npowerfully affected.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those of corrosive poisoning in its most\r\nviolent form. The mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines are often\r\nfound hardened, white, opaque, and corrugated.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Ammonium sulphide gives a white precipitate,\r\nwhich is insoluble in caustic alkalies. Hydrogen sulphide gives a\r\nwhite precipitate in neutral solutions, but no precipitate when the\r\nfree mineral acids are present. Potassium ferrocyanide gives a white\r\nprecipitate. Test for chlorine with nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--White of eggs, emetics, followed by demulcent drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORIDES OF TIN\r\n\r\nThis metal requires but little notice; but the two\r\nchlorides--protochloride and the perchloride--form a mixture used in\r\nthe arts, and known as _Dyer‘s Mixture_. They act as irritant poisons,\r\nbut are seldom used as such.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRATE OF SILVER\r\n\r\nThe only preparation of silver requiring notice is the nitrate--_lunar\r\ncaustic_, or _lapis infernalis_. It acts as a powerful corrosive.\r\nIf administered for some time in small doses it is deposited in the\r\nskin, which acquires a permanent dark colour. It does not appear to\r\nbe eliminated by the urine, and has been discovered in the liver five\r\nmonths after its administration was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms come on immediately, the vomited matters becoming\r\nblackened on exposure to light. The dark spots on the skin will also\r\nhelp to point to the nature of the poison. A dose of salt and water may\r\nbe given by way of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nVULNERANT\r\n\r\nGLASS, ENAMEL, AND NEEDLES\r\n\r\nNone of the above can be considered as poisons; but should they be\r\ntaken, they give rise in most cases to irritation of the stomach and\r\nbowels. Pins and needles have been swallowed without doing much harm.\r\nMixing ground-glass in food is a favourite mode of killing adopted by\r\nthe West Indian negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--VITAL\r\n\r\nMETALLOID IRRITANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS\r\n\r\nPoisoning by this substance is more common in France than in England.\r\nIn England, the deaths due to this poison are more frequently the\r\nresult of accident, from the incautious use of phosphorus paste for the\r\ndestruction of vermin. These pastes generally contain from 3 to 4 per\r\ncent. of phosphorus. Children have also been poisoned by sucking the\r\nheads of lucifer matches. In one case, that of a child, death followed\r\nfrom sucking about forty matches. It has most frequently been employed\r\nas a means of suicide, but seldom for the purpose of homicide. One\r\ncase, however, occurred at the Bodmin Assizes in 1857. Kopf relates a\r\ncase of a young woman, aged twenty-four, who died on the fourth day\r\nafter swallowing the heads of six packets of lucifers (_Allg. Wien.\r\nMed. Ztg._, No. 47, 1819; Schmidt, vol. cv. p. 296). The size of the\r\npackets is not stated. In this case the bowels were confined, and the\r\n_post-mortem_ revealed only the redness of inflammation in the stomach\r\nand bowels. Death has followed inunction of phosphorus paste.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--There are two kinds--ordinary waxy, crystalline\r\nphosphorus, and a peculiar form known as red allotropic or amorphous\r\nphosphorus, prepared by heating waxy phosphorus to a temperature\r\nof 240° C., in an atmosphere free from oxygen. The ordinary yellow\r\nphosphorus is poisonous, the red or amorphous non-poisonous. As\r\nfound in the shops, phosphorus is preserved in water in the form\r\nof translucent white or slightly yellow-coloured cylinders. It is\r\nsparingly soluble in oil, alcohol, and other hydrocarbons, but greatly\r\nso in bisulphide of carbon. White vapours are given off when it is\r\nexposed to the air, these consisting of phosphorus and phosphoric acids.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Phosphorus acts as an irritant poison, but some days may\r\nelapse after the poison is taken before the injurious effects become\r\napparent. The symptoms occur in three stages.\r\n\r\n_First stage:_ The patient complains of a garlic-like taste in the\r\nmouth, peculiar to poisoning by this substance. This is followed by a\r\nburning sensation in the throat, accompanied with severe pain in the\r\nstomach, and intense thirst. The belly becomes swollen, and there is\r\nvomiting, in some cases, of blood from the stomach, which may continue\r\ntill death. The vomited matters are of a dark green or black colour,\r\nwith an odour of garlic, and sometimes appearing phosphorescent in the\r\ndark. This condition may also be observed in the motions passed. There\r\nis intense thirst. The pulse is feeble, the countenance anxious, and\r\nthe surface of the body bathed in a cold sweat. In males, priapism is\r\nnot infrequent. The nervous and muscular debility is intense, and the\r\npatient may die in a state of collapse or during a fit of convulsions.\r\n\r\n_Second stage:_ This is a stage of intermission of the symptoms which\r\nmay last for three days or more, the patient seems as if going to\r\nrecover, and only suffers from general malaise. A case is recorded\r\nwhere the intermission lasted nine weeks. In cases proceeding to a\r\nfatal termination the intermission is followed by the third stage.\r\n\r\n_Third stage:_ Jaundice is the most notable symptom and rapidly\r\nincreases; the liver becomes much enlarged and the abdomen distended;\r\nepigastric pain is severe and there is vomiting of grumous black\r\nmaterial consisting of altered blood; purging may be present and the\r\nmotions contain blood. There is a marked tendency for hæmorrhages to\r\noccur from the mucous membranes and subcutaneously, producing purpuric\r\nspots. The urine is diminished, high coloured, contains bile pigments,\r\nalbumen, blood, and casts. There are great prostration, a quick weak\r\npulse, sleeplessness, coldness of the surface, gradually increasing\r\nweakness, apathy, convulsions, and coma, followed by death about the\r\nfifth or sixth day.\r\n\r\nThe liver may diminish in size before death. It is rare for recovery\r\nto take place after enlargement of the liver and jaundice have\r\nsupervened. It is by no means always easy to diagnose acute yellow\r\natrophy of the liver or malignant jaundice from phosphorus poisoning.\r\nIn phosphorus poisoning, the early symptoms, those of acute gastritis,\r\nare more severe, are developed more rapidly, and run their course more\r\nquickly than in acute atrophy, and there is a marked interval between\r\nthese and the appearance of the jaundice; in acute yellow atrophy\r\nthis interval is wanting, and from the beginning, on the contrary,\r\nthere are gradual malaise, slight gastric catarrh, and jaundice. The\r\njaundice and suffering, together with the increased action of the heart\r\nin phosphorus poisoning, are wanting in malignant jaundice, but the\r\ncerebral symptoms are more marked in the latter than in the former.\r\nAcute yellow atrophy most frequently occurs in women, especially during\r\npregnancy. In acute atrophy leucin and tyrosin are present in the\r\nurine; in phosphorus poisoning they may occur, but generally in the\r\nurine voided just before death.\r\n\r\nChronic poisoning, accompanied with all the symptoms just mentioned,\r\nmay result from the action of the vapour on those engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of phosphorus or of lucifer matches. In persons thus\r\nemployed, necrosis of the jaws and caries of the teeth are not of\r\ninfrequent occurrence. The lower jaw is more commonly affected. Mr.\r\nLyons states that this form of necrosis cannot attack persons who have\r\nperfectly sound teeth, but only those whose teeth are carious (_St.\r\nBartholomew‘s Hospital Report_, vol. xii.).\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those of acute irritant poisoning,\r\nincluding extensive destruction of the coats of the stomach, by\r\nsoftening, ulceration, and perforation, terminating in gangrene.\r\nThe stomach may contain a quantity of white vapour, having a strong\r\nsmell of garlic. This white vapour has been noticed to pass from the\r\nvagina and anus of those poisoned by phosphorus. The blood appears\r\nto be thoroughly disorganised; the blood-cells are colourless and\r\ntransparent, their colouring matter being dissolved in the uncoagulated\r\nliquor sanguinis; hæmorrhages may be present beneath the serous\r\nmembranes and in the pleural and pericardial cavities, and thromboses\r\nare frequently present, due to a tendency for the blood-cells to\r\nagglutinate. In a case recorded in the _British Medical Journal_, 1873,\r\nfatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys was found a week after\r\nthe poison was taken. In phosphorus poisoning, the liver is enlarged,\r\nof a dull appearance, doughy, uniformly yellow, with the acini well\r\nmarked; in acute atrophy, the liver is diminished in size, greasy on\r\nthe surface, leathery, of a dirty yellow colour, with traces only of\r\nthe obliterated acini. In the former, also, the hepatic cells are\r\neither filled with oil globules or entirely replaced by them; in the\r\nlatter, the cells are filled with a fine granular detritus, and their\r\nstructure replaced by newly-formed connective tissue. Putrefaction\r\nrapidly supervenes on death. Hæmorrhages may be found on the surface of\r\nthe brain and spinal cord, and the grey matter of the cortex and basal\r\nganglia rose-pink in colour. Fatty changes have been found in the walls\r\nof the capillaries and the large cortical cells.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The smell of phosphorus is characteristic, as is\r\nalso its luminosity when exposed in the dark. The following process,\r\nsuggested by Mitscherlich, may be adopted for its detection:\r\n\r\nTo render the suspected matter quite fluid water is added, previously\r\nacidulated with sulphuric acid, in order to neutralise any ammonia\r\npresent. The liquid is then transferred to a glass retort, fitted with\r\na long condensing tube passing into a receiver containing solution of\r\nnitrate of silver. Distillation is conducted in the dark, when the\r\nminutest trace of phosphorus may be detected by the luminous appearance\r\nof the vapour during condensation. Other modifications of this process\r\nhave been suggested, in order to increase the space occupied by the\r\nphosphorescence.\r\n\r\nBy the above process, one part of phosphorus may be detected in 100,000\r\nparts of substance. Another method for the detection of this poison in\r\nvery minute quantities is that proposed by Dussart (_Compt. Rend._,\r\nxliii. 1126), and modified by Blondlot (_Compt. Rend._, lii. 1197).\r\nThe test is based on the fact that when phosphorus is exposed to the\r\naction of _nascent hydrogen_ in a Marsh‘s apparatus, it burns with an\r\nemerald-green flame. In order to avoid the yellow colouring of the\r\nflame produced by the sodium in glass, Blondlot recommends the use of\r\na platinum jet. As the green colour is more or less interfered with by\r\nthe presence of organic matters, he passes the gas through a solution\r\nof nitrate of silver; the resulting precipitate is then placed in\r\nanother hydrogen apparatus, as just mentioned, and the colour of the\r\nflame of the issuing gas noted. Phosphorus may become decomposed in\r\nthe body; and as phosphoric acid is taken in most articles of food,\r\nthe only satisfactory evidence of phosphorus having been taken is to\r\nproduce it in its free state, or at least to exhibit its luminosity.\r\nThe detection of the colouring matter of lucifer matches in the stomach\r\nor vomited matters will point to the probable nature of the poison, and\r\nwhence it was derived.\r\n\r\n_Scherer‘s Test_ is based on the reducing action of phosphorus on\r\nnitrate of silver, which it blackens. The suspected material should be\r\nplaced in a flask or in a Dowzard‘s apparatus for Gutzeit‘s test for\r\narsenic, lead acetate is added to the material to fix the H₂S, and some\r\nlead acetate solution placed in each cell. A little ether is added to\r\nthe mixture, and the flask or top of the apparatus capped with paper\r\nmoistened with nitrate of silver, and set aside for some hours in a\r\ndark place. If phosphorus be present the paper will be blackened from\r\ndeposition of metallic silver.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From half an hour to twenty days or more.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One grain and a half. The smallest fatal dose recorded\r\nfor an adult is one-eighth of a grain. An infant five weeks old died\r\nfrom sucking a single match head, which probably contained one-fiftieth\r\nof a grain of phosphorus. Recovery has taken place after four and six\r\ngrains have been taken.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach pump or syphon tube should be used as soon as\r\npossible, and the stomach well washed out with warm water containing\r\na drachm of old oil of turpentine to the pint. If the turpentine be\r\nnot readily obtained, “sanitas” should be used with the water, or a\r\n1 per cent. solution of permanganate of potash. After washing the\r\nstomach, the old oil of turpentine, or the French oil of turpentine, or\r\n“sanitas” may be administered in half to one drachm doses in mucilage\r\nand water every fifteen minutes for several doses, and afterwards three\r\nor four times daily. The 1 per cent. solution of potassium permanganate\r\nmay be administered in copious drinks.\r\n\r\nAccording to some observers, turpentine is said to be of no value;\r\nbut this failure in the use of turpentine has been shown to be due to\r\nthe employment of different varieties of oil. The crude acid French\r\noil, of the three kinds met with in commerce, appears to be the only\r\none that acts as described below. With turpentine, phosphorus forms a\r\nspermaceti-like mass consisting of _turpentine phosphorus acid_. It\r\nhas an acid reaction, and is converted, on exposure to the air, into a\r\nresinous substance smelling like pine-resin. With earths and metallic\r\noxides it forms insoluble salts. The acid is not poisonous; doses of\r\n0.03 to 0.3 gram may be given to dogs and rabbits without any other\r\neffect than that of lowering of the body temperature. To the formation\r\nof this compound, the antidotal properties of turpentine in phosphorus\r\npoisoning are attributed (_Kohler a. Schempf Dingl._, pol. Jcxcix.).\r\nTurpentine is said by some to be valueless if not given within twelve\r\nhours. Emetics of sulphate of copper may be administered, but the salt\r\nis liable to cause severe gastro-enteritis. Further treatment may\r\nconsist of mucilaginous drinks containing magnesia and opium to relieve\r\npain. Oils or fats should not be given because of their solvent action\r\nupon phosphorus.\r\n\r\n=Synopsis of the Effects due to Poisoning by Phosphorus=\r\n\r\n1. Which variety of phosphorus is poisonous?--The ordinary yellow\r\nphosphorus usually kept in water. The allotropic form is inert.\r\n\r\n2. What quantity is sufficient to kill an adult?--One grain and a half.\r\n\r\n3. Symptoms as regards--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Alimentary Canal._--Pain in the stomach and belly,\r\n         eructation of gas smelling like garlic, vomiting, and\r\n         sometimes purging, with other signs of irritation.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Circulatory System._--Tendency to hæmorrhage from\r\n         the mouth, stomach, lungs, bladder, &c. Petechiæ and\r\n         ecchymoses may occur on all parts of the body. If the\r\n         case be prolonged, anæmia may be present. Pulse small,\r\n         weak, and scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Nervous System._--Cramps, creeping sensations in\r\n         the limbs, delirium, convulsions, paralysis, and extreme\r\n         nervous prostration.\r\n\r\n    (4) _Period of Invasion of the Symptoms._--Obscure and\r\n         insidious; some hours or even days may elapse before the\r\n         appearance of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n    (5) _Period of Fatal Termination._--In some cases as\r\n         short as four hours.\r\n\r\n4. _Post-mortem_ Appearances--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Alimentary Canal._--Signs of irritation and\r\n         inflammation in the stomach and intestines. Gangrene and\r\n         perforation have been noticed. Strong smell of garlic\r\n         when the abdomen is laid open. Appearances not unlike\r\n         scurvy may be found.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Cellular Tissue._--Ecchymoses may be present in\r\n         the cellular tissue of the abdomen, chest, and other\r\n         parts of the body.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Muscular Tissue._--Fatty degeneration in the heart\r\n         and other organs of the body has been noticed in several cases.\r\n\r\n    (4) _Liver._--Fatty degeneration of the gland.\r\n\r\n    (5) Blood entirely disorganised, the cells transparent,\r\n       and their contents dissolved in the uncoagulated liquor\r\n       sanguinis. The colour, cherry-red.\r\n\r\n5. _Name_ special affection produced by phosphorus in lucifer match\r\nmakers--Necrosis of the jaws, usually of the lower jaw. The disease\r\nbegins in a decayed tooth.\r\n\r\n6. _Name_ a natural disease which phosphorous poisoning has been\r\nsupposed to resemble--Acute yellow atrophy of the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\nIODINE\r\n\r\nIodine is seldom used as a poison, owing to the difficulty experienced\r\nin disguising its colour. In the form of a strong solution it has been,\r\nhowever, employed for throwing on the person with intent to cause\r\ngrievous bodily harm, as in this form it is corrosive, and destroys the\r\npart which it touches.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Iodine is a dark grey solid, with a bright\r\nmetallic lustre. It melts at 107° F., boils at 175° F., and gives off\r\nat the ordinary temperature a faint odour not unlike chlorine. But\r\nslightly soluble in pure water, it is, however, readily dissolved when\r\na soluble iodide is added to the water.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Those produced by irritant poisons generally; the severity\r\nof the symptoms being increased by the strength of the solution, iodine\r\npossessing corrosive as well as irritant properties. The vomited matter\r\nwill be stained with the iodine, and starchy material turned blue or\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those the result of acute irritant\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Two days.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One fluid drachm of the tincture has proved fatal;\r\nrecovery has taken place after taking one fluid ounce of the tincture.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach should be emptied by the aid of the stomach\r\npump, and then diluent drinks--arrowroot and barley water--may be given.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Add bisulphide of carbon to the suspected\r\nmixture, and shake them together. The sulphide will dissolve out\r\nthe iodine, which may be obtained on evaporation and sublimed. The\r\ncharacteristic reaction of iodine, the development of a blue colour on\r\nthe addition of a small quantity of starch, will be conclusive evidence\r\nof its presence. If chloroform be added to iodine in aqueous solution\r\nand shaken up, the chloroform is coloured crimson by the iodine, and\r\nfalls to the bottom as the mixture is allowed to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIODIDE OF POTASSIUM\r\n\r\nThis salt is largely used in medicine; and though poisonous effects may\r\nbe produced, due probably to some constitutional idiosyncrasy, it has\r\nseldom been used as a poison. It must, however, be placed among noxious\r\nirritant substances.\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Iodide of potassium--hydriodate of\r\npotash--occurs in cubical crystals of a white or faint yellow colour,\r\nvery slightly deliquescent when pure, and with a feeble odour of iodine.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Iodide of potassium acts as an irritant in large doses,\r\nproducing also many of the symptoms which attend a violent catarrh,\r\nwith profuse discharge from the nose, lachrymation, and swelling\r\nof the eyelids, also pustular eruptions like acne on the face and\r\nbody generally. Small doses--three to five grains--have produced in\r\nsome persons most unpleasant and even alarming symptoms. In chronic\r\npoisoning, certain glands, the mammary and testicles, are said to\r\nwaste away. Salivation is not infrequently present. I have seen the\r\nadministration of the salt produce a severe bullous and hæmorrhagic\r\neruption, simulating hæmorrhagic smallpox, with sloughing. (See also\r\nthe account in _British Medical Journal_, 1878, of a case of purpura in\r\na child five months old, after a dose of two and a half grains of the\r\nsalt.)\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The use of emetics and the stomach pump, starch, &c.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--In solution, iodide of potash gives the following\r\ncharacteristic reactions:\r\n\r\n    1. With a salt of lead                 Bright yellow precipitate.\r\n    2. With corrosive sublimate            Bright scarlet precipitate.\r\n    3. With strong nitric acid and starch  A blue colour.\r\n\r\nIn organic mixtures the mode of detecting it is more complicated.\r\n\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen should be first passed through the mixture in\r\norder to convert any free iodine into hydriodic acid. The excess of the\r\ngas is then driven off by the application of heat, and potash added,\r\nthe resulting liquor filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness.\r\nTo get rid of any organic matter, the residue left after evaporation is\r\ncharred at a low red heat, reduced to powder, and dissolved in water.\r\nThis solution is then concentrated, and strong nitric acid and solution\r\nof starch added, when, if iodine be present, the blue colour will be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMETALLIC IRRITANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC\r\n\r\nArsenic is found as metallic arsenic, as arsenious acid, in the form of\r\ntwo sulphides--realgar and orpiment, and as a constituent of several\r\nores--iron, copper, &c.\r\n\r\nMetallic arsenic is of a steel-grey colour, brittle, and sublimes at\r\na temperature a little below 400° F., without, however, previously\r\nfusing. The vapour of the metal has a peculiar garlic-like odour, which\r\nis not possessed by any of its compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nArsenious Acid\r\n\r\nArsenious anhydride--white arsenic--the most important of all the\r\ncompounds of arsenic, is colourless, odourless, and almost devoid of\r\ntaste. As found in commerce, it occurs under two forms--as a white\r\npowder, and as a solid cake, which is at first nearly transparent, but\r\nsoon becomes opaque, and then resembles white enamel. At a temperature\r\nof about 380° F. it sublimes, but is again deposited on cool surfaces\r\nin the form of octahedral crystals. It is but slightly soluble in cold\r\nwater, only about half a grain to a grain being taken up by an ounce of\r\nwater. Stirred in boiling water, and then allowed to cool, from a grain\r\nto a grain and a quarter is dissolved in the same quantity of water;\r\nbut when it is boiled for an hour, about twelve grains are dissolved\r\nin the ounce of water. This solubility is, however, diminished by the\r\npresence of any organic matter in the liquid. It is therefore less\r\nsoluble in infusions of tea or coffee than in pure water. A teaspoonful\r\nof powdered arsenic is said to weigh 150 grains, and a pinch 17 grains.\r\n\r\nArsenious acid is used in the arts in the manufacture of certain green\r\ncolours, in dyeing, and in calico printing. A weak solution is employed\r\nin medicine in the treatment of certain diseases of the skin, in ague,\r\nand in other diseases.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to use arsenious acid, on account of its caustic\r\nproperties, as an application for cancerous tumours. The employment of\r\nthis substance for this purpose is by no means new; but its use has\r\nbeen revived from time to time by the charlatan. In the year 1844, a\r\nman was tried at the Chester Winter Sessions (R. _v._ Port) for the\r\nmurder of a woman whom he pretended to cure of a cancer by the use of\r\nan arsenical plaster. In another case, recorded by M. Flandin, where\r\ndeath occurred, the quack declared that he had not applied more than\r\n_four_ or _five_ grains to the woman‘s breast. The powder used for this\r\npurpose is generally composed of arsenious acid, realgar, and oxide of\r\niron. The above cases, to which many more might be added, attest to the\r\ndanger which attends the application of arsenic to the surface of the\r\nbody; it should, therefore, never be used, especially as a more safe\r\nand potent caustic for this purpose is found in the chloride of zinc.\r\nSome years ago, in London, several cases of severe arsenical poisoning\r\nwere due to the presence of arsenic in some cheap violet powder. In one\r\ncase the navel and scrotum of a baby were fearfully excoriated, due to\r\nthe use of this powder.\r\n\r\nFarmers employ arsenious acid (white arsenic) for destroying vermin:\r\nfor steeping corn in order to destroy any spores of fungi; and it\r\nalso forms an ingredient in the wash for sheep. Injurious effects\r\nhave followed the accidental use of the corn thus treated, and those\r\nemployed in washing the sheep have suffered more or less severely.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of Parliament (14 Vict. cap. xiii. sec. 3), it is ordered\r\nthat if sold in small quantities, it must be mixed with the sixteenth\r\npart of its weight of soot, or the thirty-second part of its weight\r\nof indigo, ten pounds being the smallest quantity allowed to be sold\r\nunmixed.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this admixture must be remembered, as a medical man\r\nmay be led into an error when the vomited matters are coloured blue,\r\nblack, or green, from the mixture of bile with the indigo. Arsenic is\r\nnot, as a rule, a corrosive poison. One case is, however, on record\r\nwhere it acted as a corrosive, but the purity of the arsenic in that\r\ncase has been questioned. Its action is that of an irritant, causing\r\ninflammation in the stomach and bowels of those who have taken it;\r\nand it appears that fatal effects are produced whether the poison be\r\nswallowed or introduced into the system in any other way--_e.g._ by\r\ninjection into the rectum or vagina, or applied to the surface of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nSome observers hold that arsenic cannot be considered in the light\r\nof an accumulative poison, others that it is so to a certain extent,\r\nand that its elimination is not so rapid as was previously thought.\r\nGiven in medicinal doses, it is eliminated in from fifteen to twenty\r\ndays. Hence, in cases which have survived the immediate action of the\r\ndrug, no arsenic may be found in the body fifteen days after its fatal\r\nadministration. This is a fact of considerable importance. In the\r\ncase of Pierre Emile L‘Angelier, for whose murder Madeline Smith was\r\ntried, Dr. Penny found 88 grains in the stomach, although the deceased\r\nsurvived eight or ten hours after the probable period of taking the\r\npoison, and vomited repeatedly during that time. At the above trial,\r\nthe question was suddenly raised, that if such a large quantity was\r\nfound after death in the stomach, it was scarcely possible to infer\r\nthe administration of a much larger quantity; and thus, that the\r\nquantity must have been larger than another party could have secretly\r\nadministered, or naturally would attempt to administer. Drs. Mackinlay\r\nand Wylie, of Paisley, obtained 60 grains, and Sir R. Christison 30\r\ngrains more, from the stomach of a man poisoned by arsenic administered\r\nin whisky-punch sweetened, the arsenic being kept in suspension by\r\nconstant stirring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Arsenical Poisoning\r\n\r\n_Acute._--The rapidity and virulence of the symptoms are more or less\r\nmodified by the form (_e.g._ solution) and the dose taken. From half\r\nan hour to an hour is the usual time which elapses before the symptoms\r\nof poisoning present themselves. In one case, in which the poison was\r\nin solution, the symptoms came on immediately after it was swallowed;\r\nin another, after the lapse of ten hours. The patient first complains\r\nof a feeling of faintness and depression, followed by intense burning\r\npain in the stomach, increased by the slightest pressure. Nausea and\r\nvomiting, the latter increased by the act of swallowing, now occur. The\r\nvomited matters may be dark brown, black, or bilious; or they may be\r\ngreenish from the indigo mixed with the arsenic coming in contact with\r\nthe yellow colouring matter of the bile. Blood may also be vomited.\r\nPurging, accompanied with straining at stool, and cramps in the calves\r\nof the legs may occur--the purging, like the vomiting, being incessant,\r\nand affording no relief to the sufferer; the stools may contain blood,\r\nor resemble those of cholera. The thirst is intense, and there may\r\nbe a feeling of throat irritation, the pulse feeble and irregular,\r\nand the skin cold and clammy. The urine may or may not be suppressed.\r\nAs a rule, the symptoms in this form of poisoning are _continuous_;\r\nbut cases occur in which there are distinct _remissions_, and even\r\n_intermissions_. Coma, paralysis, or tetanic convulsions may supervene\r\nbefore death closes the scene.\r\n\r\n_Certain anomalies may occur._--The pain may be absent or but slight.\r\nVomiting and purging do not occur in all cases, nor is thirst, a\r\nmost common and persistent symptom, always present. In some cases\r\nthe symptoms resemble those which accompany an attack of cholera. In\r\nothers, signs of collapse first make their appearance, from which the\r\npatient may rally, or he may die outright. These variations in the\r\nsymptoms do not appear to be due to the _form_ or _quantity_ of the\r\npoison taken. It should also be remembered that arsenic may produce\r\nsymptoms closely resembling those the result of _narcotic poisoning_.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--In whatever way the poison be exhibited in small and\r\nrepeated doses, there follows a peculiar and characteristic train of\r\nsymptoms, associated with (_a_) the general nutrition of the body,\r\n(_b_) the facial appearance, (_c_) irritative disturbance of the\r\nalimentary canal, (_d_) skin eruptions, and (_e_) implication of the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The nutrition of the body is altered, there is gradual loss of\r\nflesh with ragged growth of the finger-nails and falling out of the\r\nhair. There may be œdema and jaundice in some cases.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The face presents a peculiar appearance, the eyes are inflamed\r\nand watery, the conjunctivæ reddened and congested, there is excessive\r\nsecretion from the nose resembling coryza.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The disturbance of the digestive organs is revealed by the\r\ndryness of the mouth and occasional excoriation of the tongue, which\r\nmay be reddened or covered with white fur and silvery in appearance;\r\nsalivation may be present instead of dryness of the mouth; there may\r\nalso be irritation of the throat; symptoms of gastro-enteritis, _e.g._\r\nnausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhœa, or alternating diarrhœa and\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The skin eruptions are of various kinds, and comprise eczema,\r\nherpes, urticaria, erythema, keratosis, marked pigmentation and\r\nexfoliation.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The nervous symptoms are those of peripheral neuritis, numbness,\r\nformication, hyperæsthesia, and tenderness, especially of the soles\r\nof the feet, the latter presenting appearances of erythro-melalgia;\r\nthere is some amount of paresis, in some cases amounting to absolute\r\nparalysis of the limbs affected. The hands may be anæsthetic, while\r\nthe feet are hyperæsthetic and hyperalgesic, and the perspiration much\r\nincreased. Mental symptoms are not common, but there may be hebetude,\r\nor delusions.\r\n\r\nIn the Maybrick case, tried at the Liverpool Assizes in 1889, the\r\nfollowing symptoms arose from repeated administration of arsenic during\r\na period of probably about fourteen days. On April 27 Mr. Maybrick was\r\nseized with vomiting after taking tea. On the next day the vomiting\r\ncontinued, with foulness of the tongue, and he complained of stiffness\r\nin the lower limbs. On May 1 he complained of feeling unwell after\r\ntaking luncheon, and he was sick on the following three days, and\r\ncomplained of a tickling sensation in the throat, with retching. On May\r\n7 he was still suffering from vomiting, diarrhœa had commenced, and the\r\nthroat was very dry and inflamed. On May 8 the diarrhœa was accompanied\r\nby tenesmus. On May 9 the tenesmus was distressing, and he died on May\r\n11.\r\n\r\nDr. Prosper de Pietra Santa describes a disease to which workers in\r\nmanufactories of paper coloured with Schweinfurt-green are liable,\r\ncharacterised by the appearance of vesicles, pustules, _plaques\r\nmuqueuses_, and ulcerations on the exposed parts of the body,\r\nfingers, toes, and scrotum. Arsenical poisoning has been mistaken\r\nfor nettle-rash, scarlet fever, and Addison‘s disease. In cases of\r\nslow poisoning the symptoms resemble very much those of gastritis and\r\nulcer of the stomach, and death due to the action of arsenic has been\r\nreferred to “spontaneous inflammation of the bowels.”\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that in some cases of acute arsenical poisoning,\r\nwhen the acute symptoms have passed away, the nervous system exhibits\r\nits effects at a later period; in one case paresis came on on the\r\nfifth day, in another at the end of a week, and in a case recorded by\r\nSeeligmüller four weeks elapsed before the onset of nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The appearances found after death depend\r\nupon the quantity of the dose and the length of time which supervenes\r\nbetween the taking of the poison and death. Inflammation of the stomach\r\nis a marked effect of the action of this substance on the system;\r\nand this condition is in most cases present whether the poison be\r\nswallowed, sprinkled on an ulcerated surface, or rubbed into the skin.\r\nThe inflammatory redness, which may assume the appearance of _crimson\r\nvelvet_, may be found in cases where death has taken place in _two_\r\nhours. It is sometimes found spreading over the entire surface of\r\nthe stomach; at others, at the cardiac end only. The red colour is\r\nincreased on exposing the stomach to the air. When the poison has\r\nbeen swallowed, the stomach may be found covered with white patches\r\nof arsenic, embedded in dark-coloured thick mucus, mixed with blood.\r\nDr. Paterson thus describes the condition of a stomach he examined:\r\nIts lining membrane was generally very red and injected; but in\r\naddition there were very numerous stellated patches of vivid red,\r\nleading to a darker tint; in the centre of some of them was noticed a\r\nminute clot of blood; in others, an exceedingly rough particle of a\r\ncrystalline substance, which was afterwards found to be arsenious acid.\r\nPerforation of the stomach is extremely rare, if it has ever occurred,\r\nbut ulceration of the same organ has been observed in a person who\r\ndied from the effects of arsenic in _five_ hours (Christison, on\r\n_Poisons_, p. 340). In opposition to all the statements just made it\r\nhas been shown that arsenic may prove fatal without leaving any sign of\r\ninflammatory action (R. _v._ M‘Cracken; R. _v._ Newton).\r\n\r\nThe mouth, pharynx, and gullet are generally found free from any\r\ninflammatory action. The small intestines may or may not be affected:\r\nin most cases the duodenum alone shows any signs of irritation. The\r\nrectum is that part of the large intestine most prone to inflammation.\r\nI have seen marked ulceration of the colon after death from inhalation\r\nof arseniuretted hydrogen. The other internal organs--the liver,\r\nspleen, and kidneys--do not appear to be appreciably affected by\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\nDue probably to the antiseptic properties of arsenic, the stomach and\r\nintestines retain for a long period after death the appearances of\r\nirritant poisoning. In two cases, this was so well marked as to be\r\nvisible--in the one case, _twelve_ months, and in the other, _nineteen_\r\nmonths after interment. In suspected cases portions of the liver should\r\nalways be preserved and examined for arsenic.\r\n\r\n=The Period after Death when Arsenic may be Detected=\r\n\r\nArsenic is an indestructible poison, and may be found in the body after\r\nmany years. In one case it was detected after the lapse of fourteen\r\nyears. Arsenic has the power, to a certain extent, of arresting\r\nputrefactive changes; the stomach may, therefore, be found well\r\npreserved, and with the signs of inflammatory action present after the\r\nlapse of many months, and after putrefaction has far advanced in other\r\nparts of the body. When a person is suspected of having been poisoned\r\nwith arsenic, and nothing but the skeleton is left for investigation,\r\nthe arsenic should be looked for specially in the bones of the pelvis\r\nand the neighbouring vertebræ (_Watt‘s Dictionary of Chemistry_, Sup.).\r\n\r\nIn reference to the preservative action of arsenic upon the tissues of\r\nthose poisoned by it, the appearances of the bodies of the victims of\r\nFlannagan and Higgins, recorded by Whitford (_B. M. J._, 1884, vol. i.\r\np. 504), are interesting. Arsenical poisoning having been established\r\nin one of three victims, the bodies of two others, Mary Higgins, aged\r\nten years, and John Flannagan, aged twenty-four years, were exhumed\r\nand examined. The abdominal viscera of Mary Higgins yielded one grain\r\nof arsenious acid, and although the body had been interred for about\r\nthirteen and a half months, it was well preserved. A remarkable\r\nstate of preservation obtained in the body of John Flannagan, who\r\nhad been interred for thirty-seven and a half months; the face and\r\nbody generally could be easily identified. Three and a half grains of\r\narsenious acid were found in the abdominal viscera. In these cases a\r\npeculiar appearance was found in the stomach and intestines, consisting\r\nof a golden-yellow pigment or coating of the mucous membrane of the\r\nparts. It was thought by some observers to be composed of arsenic\r\nsulphide, but Campbell-Brown, and Davies of Liverpool, as a result of\r\ntheir analysis of it, found that it did not contain any appreciable\r\namount of arsenic, but consisted mainly of bile pigment.\r\n\r\nIn trials for arsenical poisoning, where an exhumation has been made,\r\nthe question may arise whether the arsenic found in the body has been\r\ncarried into it from the earth surrounding the coffin.\r\n\r\nIn reply, the following points must be kept in mind:\r\n\r\n    1. Arsenic may occur in certain calcareous and ochrey soils.\r\n\r\n    2. In these soils no arsenical compound _soluble in\r\n       water_ has been found.\r\n\r\n    3. The arsenic of these soils is dissolved out by\r\n       hydrochloric acid, proving their previous insolubility.\r\n\r\n    4. The arsenic is, therefore, probably in the form of an\r\n       arsenite or arseniate of iron, lime, &c.\r\n\r\n    5. Careful experiments have rendered it evident that even\r\n       “under the most favourable circumstances the dead human\r\n       body does not acquire an impregnation of arsenic from\r\n       contact with arsenical earth” (Taylor).\r\n\r\n    6. It has been suggested that the arsenical compound in the\r\n       soil may be rendered soluble by the ammonia formed during\r\n       putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThis last suggestion is negatived by the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. The production of ammonia ceases before the body arrives at that\r\nstage of decomposition when it is at all likely to be exposed to the\r\naction of the soil of the cemetery.\r\n\r\n2. The production of hydrosulphuret of ammonia during decomposition\r\nwould tend to the production of sulphuret of arsenic forming yellow\r\npatches in the substance of the organs, thus rather fixing the arsenic\r\non particular parts than allowing it to percolate through the tissues\r\nof the body from external application.\r\n\r\n_Analysis of the Suspected Earth._--About two pounds of the earth\r\nshould be boiled for some time in water; supernatant liquid should then\r\nbe poured off from the insoluble residue, and filtered. The filtered\r\nliquid, after concentration, may then be examined by the tests about to\r\nbe described. If no arsenic be found, the earth may now be boiled with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, filtered, concentrated, and then tested as\r\nbefore. The first process shows that no compound of arsenic soluble in\r\nwater is present; the second shows that the arsenic is in a state of\r\ncombination, and therefore not likely to impregnate the body.\r\n\r\n=The Detection of Arsenic=\r\n\r\n_General Directions._--In cases of suspected poisoning by arsenic or\r\nantimony, the contents of the stomach should be mixed with distilled\r\nwater acidulated with hydrochloric acid and filtered, and the filtrate\r\nplaced in a stoppered bottle lettered or numbered “A” or “1.” The\r\nliver should be cut into pieces, some of which should be bruised in a\r\nmortar with distilled water acidulated as above mentioned, pressed and\r\nfiltered, and the filtrate placed in a bottle marked “B” or “2.”\r\n\r\nThe kidneys and portions of the other solid organs may also be treated\r\nas above. Each solution so obtained may be then tested by the processes\r\nabout to be described. By these means the amount of poison in each\r\norgan may be estimated.\r\n\r\nBefore subjecting the organic mixture to Marsh‘s or Reinsch‘s\r\nprocesses, Brande and Taylor strongly recommend a modified course of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the stomach, vomited matters, &c., and the solid\r\norgans, finely divided, must each be separated and _thoroughly_ dried\r\nin a water bath, then mixed with an excess of _strong_ hydrochloric\r\nacid in a flask, and slowly distilled by means of a sand bath, the\r\ndistillate carried into a receiver containing a little pure distilled\r\nwater, and the process continued nearly to dryness.\r\n\r\nIf arsenic be present, the distillate contains the arsenic as\r\nchloride, and can be at once subjected with great facility to the\r\nusual tests for the presence of that metal. This mode of proceeding\r\nboth facilitates and expedites the ordinary methods of testing, as it\r\nseparates the arsenic present from the complex organic mixtures with\r\nwhich it is associated, and presents it in a comparatively pure form\r\nfor identification. The process also admits of the residue left in the\r\nretort being examined for lead and the other metallic poisons.\r\n\r\nBefore the following processes are applied, some of the sediment from\r\nthe contents of the stomach, or the vomited matters, may be collected\r\nand well washed. If this is boiled in distilled water and filtered,\r\nthe following tests, known as “the liquid tests for arsenic,” may be\r\napplied to the filtrate:\r\n\r\n       1. _Ammonia Nitrate of Silver_, prepared by adding\r\n    a weak solution of ammonia to a strong solution of nitrate\r\n    of silver, gives with arsenic a yellow precipitate of\r\n    _arsenite of silver_ soluble in nitric, citric, acetic,\r\n    and tartaric acids, and ammonia.\r\n\r\n       2. _Ammonia-Sulphate of Copper_, prepared by\r\n    adding ammonia to a dilute solution of sulphate of copper,\r\n    gives with arsenic a green precipitate of _arsenite of\r\n    copper_. This precipitate is soluble in the mineral and\r\n    vegetable acids and ammonia, but is not affected by soda or\r\n    potash. The precipitate, dried and heated in a reduction\r\n    tube, yields octahedral crystals of arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n       3. _Sulphuretted Hydrogen._--The suspected liquid\r\n    should be first slightly acidulated with _pure_\r\n    hydrochloric acid _before_ the sulphuretted hydrogen\r\n    gas is passed into it, when, if arsenic be present, a yellow\r\n    precipitate is formed, known to be such by the following\r\n    tests:\r\n\r\n    (1) Insoluble in water, ether, alcohol, the vegetable acids,\r\n        and dilute hydrochloric acid, but decomposed by strong\r\n        nitric and nitro-hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\n    (2) Dissolved, if no organic matter present, forming a\r\n        colourless solution, when potash, soda, or ammonia is\r\n        added.\r\n\r\n    (3) The yellow precipitate dried and heated with soda and\r\n        cyanide of potassium yields a sublimate of metallic\r\n        arsenic.\r\n\r\n        _N.B._--None of the above tests should be\r\n        applied in the presence of organic matter. The\r\n        soluble salts of cadmium and per-salts of tin give\r\n        yellow-coloured precipitates with sulphuretted\r\n        hydrogen.\r\n\r\n    (4) If stannous chloride dissolved in strong hydrochloric\r\n        acid be added to a solution of arsenic in hydrochloric\r\n        acid, metallic arsenic is thrown down as a precipitate.\r\n        This is a fairly delicate test.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following Table gives the differences between\r\n       the Yellow Precipitates formed with Sulphuretted Hydrogen\r\n       and Arsenic, Cadmium, and Per-Salts of Tin:\r\n\r\n    +------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+\r\n    |                  |                 |            |  Per-Salts   |\r\n    |                  |    Arsenic.     |  Cadmium.  |   of Tin.    |\r\n    +------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+\r\n    |Colour.           |Yellow.          |Yellow.     | Dirty yellow.|\r\n    |                  |                 |            |              |\r\n    |Action of ammonia.|Soluble.         |Insoluble.  | Insoluble.   |\r\n    |                  |                 |            |              |\r\n    |Action of         |Insoluble.       |Soluble.    |              |\r\n    |hydrochloric acid.|                 |            |              |\r\n    |                  |                 |            |              |\r\n    |With cyanide      |Sublimes as      |Sublimes as | No sublimate.|\r\n    |flux.             |metallic arsenic.|brown oxide.|              |\r\n    +------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n_Marsh‘s Process._--This method for the detection of arsenic is\r\nfounded on the fact that the several compounds of arsenic, except the\r\nsulphide and metallic arsenic itself, form a gaseous compound with\r\nnascent hydrogen, from which it may be readily separated by appropriate\r\ntreatment. The solution to be tested should, therefore, be prepared as\r\nproposed by Brande and Taylor, given on a preceding page.\r\n\r\n_Precautions._--(1) Absolute purity of reagents. (2) The sulphuric acid\r\nshould be diluted with five times its weight of water, and allowed to\r\ncool. (3) The suspected fluid should be added gradually. (4) Generate\r\nthe gas regularly. (5) If no stain be at once produced, keep a portion\r\nof the exit tube red-hot for at least one hour.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of the apparatus is that of a =U=-shaped glass tube,\r\nabout one inch in diameter and eight inches high, supported in a\r\nvertical position on a wooden stand. One end of the tube is fitted with\r\na tap, and terminates in a glass tube drawn to a fine point; the other\r\nend is closed with a cork.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is used as follows: A piece of pure zinc is dropped into\r\nthe tube, and shaken into such a position that it occupies the bottom\r\nof that limb of the tube which is furnished with the tap. Water is\r\nthen added, and subsequently sufficient pure sulphuric acid to cause\r\na moderately brisk evolution of hydrogen. The production of hydrogen\r\ngas from pure zinc and pure sulphuric acid is sometimes slow, and may\r\nbe facilitated by adding a few drops of platinic chloride solution to\r\nthe contents of the flask previous to the addition of the sulphuric\r\nacid. The gas being allowed to accumulate for a short time, the tap\r\nis then partially turned on, and the gas ignited; if, on depressing\r\na piece of white porcelain momentarily in the flame, no deposit or\r\ndiscoloration occur, the reagents used may be taken as pure. By the\r\nuse of Thorpe‘s apparatus for Marsh‘s test, in which the hydrogen is\r\nobtained by the electrolysis of water, the absence of arsenic in the\r\nreagents and apparatus is ensured. The tap is now connected with a tube\r\nof thin, hard glass, drawn out to a fine point at the end and having a\r\nconstriction in the middle. The liquid to be tested being now placed in\r\nthe apparatus, the gas is again ignited, and a piece of white porcelain\r\nmomentarily depressed in the flame, when, if arsenic be present, a\r\nblack, circular, metallic-looking stain will appear, which has the\r\nfollowing composition. In the centre is the unoxidised metal, round\r\nthis is a mixed deposit, and outside this the zone of arsenious acid.\r\nWhile the gas is passing, the exit tube should be heated to redness a\r\nlittle behind the constricted part, when a dark ring will appear if\r\narsenic be present. The black deposit on the porcelain may be either\r\narsenic or antimony, but may be distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n    --------------------+---------------------------+--------------------\r\n                        |         Arsenic.          |   Antimony.\r\n    --------------------+---------------------------+--------------------\r\n    Nature of the stain.|Metallic brilliancy.       |Absence of metallic\r\n                        |                           |lustre.\r\n                        |                           |\r\n    Effect of heat.     |Volatile.                  |Non-volatile.\r\n                        |                           |\r\n    Heated with a little|Dissolves.                 |Oxidises to a white\r\n    nitric acid.        |                           |insoluble powder.\r\n                        |                           |\r\n    Warmed with a strong|Dissolves immediately.     |Slowly dissolved.\r\n    solution of chloride|                           |\r\n    of lime.            |                           |\r\n                        |                           |\r\n    Treated with        |Detached but not dissolved,|Soluble: on\r\n    bisulphide          |but if heated              |evaporation,\r\n      of ammonium.      |to drive off ammonia       |_orange-yellow_\r\n                        |_yellow sulphide_          |sulphide formed.\r\n                        |formed.                    |\r\n                        |                           |\r\n    The nitric acid     |A brick-red precipitate    |No reaction, but if\r\n    solution            |soluble in ammonia.        |ammonia and potash\r\n    evaporated to       |                           |are added, a black\r\n    dryness gives with  |                           |precipitate is\r\n    nitrate of silver.  |                           |ultimately formed.\r\n    --------------------+---------------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nThe portion of the tube on which the dark ring has been deposited is\r\nnow cut off, broken into fragments, and heated in a small, hard glass\r\ntube--when, if arsenic be present, a white sublimate will be obtained\r\nof well-defined octahedral crystals. If the sublimate be treated with\r\nsulphide of ammonium, it is detached but not perfectly dissolved,\r\nand on evaporation of the solution to dryness, a residue of the\r\nyellow sulphide of arsenic will remain, which, if heated with strong\r\nnitric acid, and evaporated again to dryness, will give a brick-red\r\nprecipitate with nitrate of silver solution, soluble in ammonia. The\r\nprocess of Marsh may be used quantitatively by passing the issuing\r\ngas through a glass tube, dipping into a strong solution of argentic\r\nnitrate. A portion of the tube is kept at a red heat, when, if arsenic\r\nbe present, it is deposited in the metallic form in the cool portion.\r\nThe glass tube containing the stain is cut with a file and weighed.\r\nThe stain is then removed by strong nitric acid, the tube dried and\r\nweighed: the difference in weight equals the amount of metallic\r\narsenic. The nitrate of silver solution is now treated with pure\r\nhydrochloric acid, filtered, and the filtrate neutralised with sodium\r\ncarbonate, titrated with standard solution of iodine. By dipping the\r\nend of the issuing tube into a fresh solution of argentic nitrate, the\r\nabsence of colour will show that all the arsenic has been obtained.\r\n\r\nInstead of the =U=-shaped tube a Wolff‘s bottle or Erlenmeyer‘s flask\r\nmay be used, and the exit tube carrying off the gas bent twice upon\r\nitself and connected with a glass bulb containing calcium chloride.\r\nFrom this bulb the long, hard glass tube proceeds, pointed at the end\r\nto form a gas jet; the gas is lighted at the end, and if a Bunsen flame\r\nbe applied at a short distance from the end, a deposit of the arsenic,\r\nif present, will form on the distal side of the point at which the\r\nflame is applied.\r\n\r\n_Reinsch‘s Process._--First obtain a clear solution by filtration or\r\notherwise, and then proceed as follows: Strongly acidify the liquid\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, introduce some pieces of copper foil, and\r\nheat to near the boiling-point of the liquid. Both the acid and metal\r\nmust be previously tested to ensure their freedom from arsenic. Any\r\narsenic present will then be deposited on the copper in the metallic\r\nstate, either in the form of a black lustrous deposit when the arsenic\r\nis present in any quantity, or else as a steel-grey coating when a\r\nminute quantity only is present. In either case, the copper foil, after\r\nremaining for some time in the suspected fluid, is taken out, cut\r\ninto small pieces, introduced into the bottom of a hard glass tube,\r\nand heated to low redness, when the arsenic will sublime as arsenious\r\nacid in octahedral crystals, forming a ring in the cooler portion of\r\nthe tube. The deposit is identified as arsenious acid by the form of\r\nthe crystals, and by its deportment with the various reagents, as in\r\nthe treatment of similar sublimates mentioned under _Marsh‘s Process_.\r\nTwo precautions have to be taken in applying this test: do not use too\r\nlarge a portion of copper foil at first, and do not remove the copper\r\ntoo quickly from the boiling fluid. A solution containing arsenic acid\r\nor an alkaline arsenite, mixed with sulphuric acid, does not produce\r\nany deposit on metallic copper even after long boiling, unless the\r\nquantity of the arsenic present be considerable; the deposition may,\r\nhowever, be ensured by adding sulphurous acid or a sulphite, whereby\r\nthe arsenic is reduced to arsenious acid (G. Werther, _J. Pr. Chem._,\r\nlxxxii. 286; _Jahresb._, 1861, p. 851).\r\n\r\n_Objections to Reinsch‘s Process._--The chief objection to Reinsch‘s\r\nprocess is the possible impurity of the reagents used--both these\r\nreagents, even when supplied as pure, being liable to contain traces of\r\narsenic. As met with in commerce, both hydrochloric acid and metallic\r\ncopper invariably contain minute quantities of arsenic, the former\r\ngenerally containing the larger quantity of that impurity. Although,\r\nby purchasing the purest possible reagents, specially prepared for\r\nanalysis, it may be possible to ensure their freedom from arsenic,\r\nyet in all cases they should be tested before using them. Some of the\r\nhydrochloric acid should be diluted with distilled water, and gently\r\nheated with the copper foil. If no tarnishing or deposit of any kind\r\noccur on the metal after a lapse of several hours, the reagents may be\r\ntaken as pure and the trial of the suspected substance at once made.\r\n\r\nProfessor Abel has proposed the following process to ensure the\r\npurity of the copper and acid: Boil together equal portions of strong\r\nhydrochloric acid and a solution of perchloride of iron. While the\r\nmixture is boiling immerse the copper foil, which, if pure, will be\r\nmerely brightened in colour; if impure, a black deposit on the metal is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Photo-micrograph of sublimate of arsenious\r\nacid obtained by Reinsch‘s process, × 250. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Bloxam‘s Method for the Detection of Arsenic._--The late Professor\r\nBloxam suggested an admirable and delicate process for the detection of\r\nsmall quantities of arsenic. The method is, like that of Marsh, founded\r\non the property possessed by nascent hydrogen of forming a gaseous\r\ncompound with arsenic; but, instead of the hydrogen being generated by\r\nthe action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc, Bloxam generates the gas\r\nby an electric current.\r\n\r\nThe wires from the extremities of a battery terminate in small plates\r\nof platinum foil, which are plunged into the liquid to be tested, the\r\napparatus being so arranged that the hydrogen gas evolved from the\r\nnegative pole is collected. The issuing gas is tested in a similar\r\nmanner to that obtained in Marsh‘s process.\r\n\r\nThis method of Bloxam‘s is exceedingly delicate, and possesses one\r\ngreat advantage, that no zinc being used, there is no danger of\r\ncontamination by the use of impure metal; while, as nothing foreign is\r\nintroduced during the process of testing, the liquid under examination\r\nis left pure for the application of other tests if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Dowzard‘s apparatus for Gutzeit‘s test for\r\narsenic. A and B indicate glass cells or traps which contain solutions\r\nof lead acetate and copper chloride for the purpose of fixing H₂S and\r\nPH₃ which otherwise would react upon the mercuric chloride spot on the\r\nfilter-cap. The cells are fitted into one another, as shown in the\r\nfigure.]\r\n\r\n_Gutzeit‘s Test._--This test is more sensitive to the presence of\r\nminute quantities of arsenic than that of either Reinsch or Marsh. The\r\napparatus devised by Dowzard should be used (_Journ. Chem. Soc._, vols.\r\nlxxix. and lxxx. 463, p. 715), which consists of an Erlenmeyer‘s flask\r\nfitted with superimposed cells, containing solutions which will wash or\r\nneutralise those gases which would interfere with the accuracy of the\r\nresult. The following is Dowzard‘s description of the method of using\r\nthe apparatus:\r\n\r\n“A weighed or measured portion of the sample is mixed with 5 c.c. of\r\npure HCl (if the sample is alkaline it must be neutralised first), four\r\ndrops of a 15 per cent. solution of cuprous chloride in hydrochloric\r\nacid are then added, and the mixture made up to 30 c.c. with water; if\r\nit is not convenient to work with such a small bulk as 30 c.c. this\r\nquantity may be doubled or trebled, but the same proportion of acid\r\nshould be used. A rod of pure zinc, 3 cm. long and 5 mm. in diameter,\r\nis first placed in the flask, the above mixture is then introduced and\r\nthe first cell placed in position; lead acetate solution 5 per cent. is\r\nnow poured into the cell until it is about half full. The second and\r\nthird cells are filled in a similar manner; a small tuft of cotton wool\r\nis introduced into the neck of the top cell, and its mouth capped with\r\nmercuric chloride paper, which may be held in position by an elastic\r\nband or a glass collar made from a piece of glass tubing. After forty\r\nminutes or more the cap is removed and examined in full daylight. A\r\nminute trace of arsenic is indicated by a lemon-yellow spot, which\r\nvaries in tint according to the amount present; and a heavy trace by an\r\norange-brown spot. The mercuric chloride paper is prepared as follows:\r\none drop of a 5 per cent. solution of mercuric chloride is allowed to\r\nfall on the centre of a piece (4 cm. square) of thin Swedish filtering\r\npaper, such as Muncktell‘s No. 1 F.; the paper is dried before using.”\r\nThe lead acetate in the cells absorbs any H₂S gas given off, and if\r\nadditional cells contain a 15 per cent. solution of cuprous chloride\r\nin hydrochloric acid, PH₃ is also prevented from passing and causing a\r\nstain. By this method arsenic can be detected in the presence of 2500\r\ntimes its weight of antimony. The presence of selenium and tellurium\r\ncompounds does not interfere with the usefulness of this method.\r\n\r\n_Fleitmann‘s Test._--Detects arsenic in the presence of antimony,\r\nbut does not detect arsenic as arsenic acid. When zinc or aluminium\r\nis heated with excess of potassium or sodium hydroxide in a mixture\r\ncontaining arsenious anhydride, arseniuretted hydrogen is evolved. The\r\ngas may be led into 4 per cent. nitrate of silver solution, or a test\r\ntube the top of which is covered with filter paper wet with nitrate of\r\nsilver. The gas reduces the silver salt, and a black precipitate is\r\nproduced in the solution, or a black spot on the paper.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Two grains in solution have been known to cause death.\r\nRecoveries have, however, occurred after an ounce or more of the poison\r\nhas been taken. Much will depend upon the fulness or emptiness of the\r\nstomach at the time the poison is taken, and also upon the vehicle in\r\nwhich the poison is administered. Vomiting and purging are more urgent\r\nwhen the dose is large, probably assisting to get rid of the arsenic\r\nbefore its fatal action is produced.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From twenty minutes to two or three weeks, and even\r\nlater from the secondary effects of the poison. Any thick medium, cocoa\r\nor soup, will of course delay the action of the poison.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Vomiting should be promoted, and diluent drinks largely\r\ngiven. The stomach pump, if it can be procured without much delay,\r\nshould also be employed to empty the stomach. Emetics of sulphate of\r\nzinc should be given without delay--followed by the administration of\r\nmilk, lime-water, and albumen. Symptoms as they occur must be treated\r\non general principles.\r\n\r\nThe hydrated sesquioxide of iron, the hydrated oxide of magnesia,\r\nand animal charcoal have been proposed and used as antidotes. The\r\nsesquioxide of iron can be prepared ready to hand by saturating\r\nthe tincture _ferri perchloridi_ with ammonia or washing soda. It\r\nshould be given freely. Drachm doses of dialysed iron in water may\r\nbe administered. Reputed antidotes are useless when the poison is in\r\nthe solid state. The diarrhœa, tenesmus, collapse, pain, and nervous\r\nsymptoms should be treated on general principles.\r\n\r\n=Other Poisonous Compounds of Arsenic=\r\n\r\n=Arsenical Vapour.=--The vapour from the flues of the copper and\r\narsenic smelting-works in Cornwall, escaping into the air, may cause\r\ndeath to cattle, and the destruction of vegetation. The workmen in\r\nthese works not infrequently suffer from eruptions on the skin, and\r\nfrom great constitutional derangement; but, on the whole, taking into\r\nconsideration the dangerous nature of their employment, the men appear\r\nto enjoy average health. Actions for damage and nuisance have resulted\r\nfrom the escape of this vapour from the factories.\r\n\r\n=Arsenite of Potash.=--A solution of arsenite of potash, mixed with\r\nthe tincture of red lavender (the solution contains four grains of\r\narsenious acid in one ounce)--better known as Fowler‘s Solution, or\r\nas Fowler‘s Mineral Solution or Tasteless Ague Drop. It is probably\r\na solution of arsenious acid in carbonate of potash, and not a true\r\narsenite of potash. This preparation has been much used as a domestic\r\nremedy for ague in the Fens of Cambridgeshire. Death from its use is\r\nrare; but it is, nevertheless, too dangerous a medicine to be used\r\nrecklessly. Idiosyncrasy has much to do with the action of the drug,\r\nsome persons taking even large doses with impunity, whilst, in others,\r\nthe smallest medicinal dose has produced alarming symptoms. It is\r\nstated that the Styrian arsenic-eating peasant is capable of taking\r\nwithout injury five grains of arsenious acid for a dose; and in one\r\ncase of suspected murder in Styria, the prisoner was acquitted as the\r\ndeceased was known to be an arsenic-eater.\r\n\r\n_Donovan‘s Solution._--A solution of hydriodate of arsenic and mercury.\r\nNow officinal, and much used by many practitioners.\r\n\r\n_Sheep Dip._--The mixture used for washing sheep, composed of\r\ntar-water, soft soap, and arsenic, has caused death in twenty-four\r\nhours. The men engaged in dipping the sheep may suffer both locally and\r\nconstitutionally from the effects of the arsenic in the solution.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As before described.\r\n\r\n_Analysis._--See p. 280 _et seq._\r\n\r\n=Arsenite of Copper.=--Scheele‘s green, and the aceto-arsenite of\r\ncopper, Schweinfurt-green, are met with in commerce and the arts\r\nas green pigments. Among workmen they are familiarly known as\r\nemerald-green, Brunswick-green, or Vienna-green. In France, the term\r\n_vert Anglais_ or English green has been given to them. Scheele‘s\r\ngreen contains about 55 per cent. of pure arsenious acid; the other,\r\nSchweinfurt-green, about 58 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese colours are employed for various purposes, among which the\r\nfollowing may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n    1. Artificial flowers and other articles of dress.\r\n    2. Confectionery, pastry ornaments, and toys.\r\n    3. As green paint for the insides of houses.\r\n    4. In the green colour for wall-papers.\r\n    5. In the green-coloured paper lining boxes, &c.\r\n    6. Green-coloured tapers used for artificial lighting.\r\n\r\nThe employment of emerald-green in the colouring of wall-papers is\r\nso extensive, that in the year 1860 an English paper-stainer stated\r\nthat he used two tons of arsenic weekly. In 1862 the amount of this\r\ncolour manufactured during the year was from 500 to 700 tons. Numerous\r\ncases of chronic arsenical poisoning have resulted from the presence\r\nof arsenic in the form of Scheele‘s green and Schweinfurt-green in\r\nwall-papers and other articles. As the colour is only loosely applied\r\nto the surface by means of a weak solution of size, it is easily\r\nbrushed off, and may so impregnate the air of a room as to produce\r\ninjurious effects on those who inhabit the apartment. By fermentation\r\nof the starch paste used for fastening the paper to the walls,\r\nnascent hydrogen is liberated, and, combining with the arsenic to\r\nform arseniuretted hydrogen, passes into the air of the room and is\r\ninhaled. This gas is extremely poisonous, and small quantities suffice\r\nto produce serious results. Certain moulds are endowed with the power\r\nof living in materials containing arsenic, and of decomposing arsenious\r\nacid or its salts into the gaseous form known as _diethylarsine_; there\r\nare altogether ten such moulds, and the most active is the _Penicillium\r\nbrevicaule_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of ladies‘ dresses, the following method is adopted:\r\n\r\n    The colouring material is made by thoroughly stirring\r\n    together a mixture containing, in definite proportions, the\r\n    green pigment, cold water, starch, and gum arabic, or some\r\n    similar substance which shall give the colour consistence\r\n    and adhesiveness. Not infrequently in this process the hand\r\n    and forearm are freely used in the liquid to expedite the\r\n    work. Of this mixture, properly prepared, the workman takes\r\n    a quantity in his fingers and roughly spreads it over the\r\n    muslin or fine calico. The fabric is then beaten and kneaded\r\n    between the hands until it is uniformly coloured. The longer\r\n    this process is continued, the more perfect is the result.\r\n    The cloth is now fastened to a frame for drying. In all this\r\n    process of colouring, the hands, forearms, and frequently\r\n    also the face of the operative must become soiled with the\r\n    green colour. It will be also observed that the colour is\r\n    but loosely applied, _no mordant being used_, as in\r\n    calico printing, to fix the pigment in the texture of the\r\n    cloth.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--All the effects produced by arsenic may result from the\r\nuse of articles coloured with these pigments. Chronic inflammation of\r\nthe stomach and bowels, and irritation of the eyes, accompanied in\r\nsome cases with extreme nervous debility and prostration, are by no\r\nmeans uncommon in those employed in the manufacture of this “cheerful,”\r\nbut poisonous colour. The skin of the hands, arms, and scalp is often\r\nattacked by a vesicular eruption or an erythema. When it is borne in\r\nmind that, according to the analysis of Hoffman, a single twig of\r\ntwelve artificial leaves may contain as much as ten grains of pure\r\narsenic, it is not to be wondered at that the most serious results have\r\noccurred from the reckless use of these colours. In Prussia and France\r\nthe use of the arsenical colours is prohibited.\r\n\r\n_Analysis._--Scheele‘s green is insoluble in water, but is soluble in\r\nammonia, the solution having a blue colour, from the separation of the\r\narsenious acid from the oxide of copper. If a few drops of the blue\r\nammoniacal solution be poured on some crystals of nitrate of silver,\r\nthe yellow arsenite of silver is formed. The blue ammoniacal solution,\r\nif acidified with HCl and boiled with pure copper foil, deposits\r\narsenic on the copper, which, if cut into strips and placed in a small\r\nreduction tube and heated, sublimes and is deposited in octahedral\r\ncrystals on the cold portion of the tube. The tests before described\r\nare applicable for the detection of this substance.\r\n\r\n=Orpiment=\r\n\r\nOrpiment, or yellow arsenic, one of the sulphurets of arsenic, has\r\nbeen used occasionally as a poison. It is also largely employed in the\r\narts for paper-staining and for colouring toys. In cases of arsenical\r\npoisoning, it is this compound that is commonly found adhering to the\r\nstomach and intestines. It is formed by the sulphuretted hydrogen, the\r\nresult of decomposition, acting on the white arsenic swallowed.\r\n\r\n=Realgar=\r\n\r\nRealgar, or red arsenic, is another of the sulphurets of arsenic, and,\r\nlike orpiment, is largely used in the arts as a colour. It is also\r\nemployed, like orpiment, as a depilatory, fatal results having followed\r\nits use for this purpose. The colour of this substance prohibits its\r\nfrequent use as a poison.\r\n\r\nBoth of these compounds owe their poisonous properties to the amount of\r\nfree arsenious acid which they contain, and which may be as much as 30\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms produced by these substances are similar to\r\nthose caused by arsenic. The fatal dose will depend on the amount of\r\nfree arsenious acid which they may each contain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Emetics and demulcent drinks.\r\n\r\n=Metallic Arsenic, &c.=\r\n\r\nMetallic arsenic, fly powder, arsenic acid, largely used in the\r\nmanufacture of magenta, aniline red, or fuchsine, and the arseniates\r\nof potash and soda, are all poisonous. The _papier moure_ of the shops\r\nconsists of blotting-paper steeped in a solution of arseniate of\r\npotash. Macquer‘s neutral arsenical salt is the binarsenate of potash.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are those of arsenical poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When metallic arsenic has been taken, vomiting must be\r\npromoted by the use of proper emetics. Tartar emetic should never be\r\nused. In the treatment for poisoning with arsenic acid, or of the\r\narseniates of potash and soda, the hydrated oxide of iron, or of the\r\nacetate of iron, should be used, as the arseniates are precipitated by\r\nthe iron.\r\n\r\n=Arsenic Acid=\r\n\r\nNo case of poisoning by this substance has been recorded, for, although\r\npoisonous, it is better known in the laboratory than in the shops.\r\nIt differs from arsenious acid in being only partially volatilised\r\nby heat, in its solubility in water, and in being precipitated of a\r\nbrick-red colour by nitrate of silver. With sulphuretted hydrogen a\r\nyellow precipitate is slowly formed, insoluble in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=Arseniuretted Hydrogen=\r\n\r\nThis gas has proved fatal in several cases. It is generated in the\r\nprocess known as Marsh‘s process for arsenic, and is so poisonous that\r\na very small quantity, not sufficient to be detected by its odour, has\r\ncaused death. In most cases death has been the result of accident.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Giddiness, fainting, constant vomiting, pain in stomach,\r\nand suppression of urine, with rapid destruction of the red blood\r\ncorpuscles, associated with hæmorrhages from all the mucous membranes\r\nand jaundice, are among the most prominent symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are inflammation of the stomach, with\r\nsoftening of its coats. The liver and kidneys are also more or less\r\naffected, and have been found of a deep indigo colour.\r\n\r\n_Analysis._--This has been described when speaking of Marsh‘s process\r\nfor arsenic.\r\n\r\n=Cacodylic Acid=\r\n\r\nCacodylic acid and the cacodylates are poisonous. The acid dissolves\r\neasily in water and alcohol, and it unites with many metals and\r\norganic substances to form salts. Although it is held by some to be\r\nnon-poisonous, Murrell asserts that the administration of cacodylate of\r\nsodium produces symptoms “far more severe than those which follow the\r\nexhibition of arsenic in its ordinary forms” (_B. M. J._, 1900, vol.\r\nii. p. 1823; 1901, vol. i. p. 120).\r\n\r\nProfessor Fraser of Edinburgh, on the other hand, from clinical\r\nobservation and chemical tests, affirms that cacodylic acid and the\r\ncacodylates are extremely stable bodies, and the arsenic in them is\r\nwith such great difficulty set free that it passes through the body in\r\ncombination as an inert substance (_B. M. J._, 1902, vol. i. p. 713).\r\n\r\n=Arsenical Contamination of Food Stuffs=\r\n\r\nArsenic is found associated with many other substances in nature,\r\nparticularly copper and pyrites. Arsenic is commonly present in\r\ncommercial sulphuric acid manufactured from pyrites containing the\r\nmetal, and when such acid is used with common salt for the production\r\nof hydrochloric acid, the latter also becomes contaminated. It may be\r\nsafely stated that commercial sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, copper\r\nand zinc, free from arsenic, do not exist in the market. Hence in the\r\ndetection of arsenic by the toxicologist the absolute purity of these\r\nreagents, which he uses, must be established.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of glucose, arseniferous sulphuric acid has been\r\nthe means of contaminating it. Ritter and Blyth pointed out the\r\ndanger, by this means, of conveying arsenic into beer, confectionery,\r\nsyrup, and other food stuffs. Glucose made with such acid, and used\r\nin the manufacture of beer, was the cause, in the year 1900, of a\r\nwidespread and serious epidemic of arsenical poisoning in Manchester\r\nand Liverpool, in which several thousand persons suffered. Arsenic may\r\nalso contaminate grain during malting by the use of anthracite coal or\r\nsulphur bar in the kilns.\r\n\r\n            Recapitulation of the Leading Facts with regard to\r\n                     Poisoning with Arsenic\r\n    --------------------------+------------------------------------------\r\n                     ACUTE POISONING.--SYMPTOMS, ETC.\r\n    --------------------------+------------------------------------------\r\n     Action on alimentary     | Intense irritation of the stomach, upper\r\n      canal                   |   part of small intestine, and lower part\r\n                              |   of the large.

Metallic antimony is of a bluish-white colour, crystalline\r\nand brittle. It melts at about 840° F., and is slowly volatilised at a\r\nwhite heat.\r\n\r\nTwo compounds of antimony--tartar emetic and chloride of antimony--are\r\nalone of any toxicological interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of tartarated\r\nantimony, × 50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n=Tartar Emetic=\r\n\r\n=Antimonium Tartaratum.     Tartarated Antimony=\r\n\r\nTartar emetic occurs as a white powder; sometimes, however, with a\r\nyellowish tint. It is soluble in about three parts of boiling water and\r\nfifteen of cold, and insoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe _vinum antimoniale_ of the Pharmacopœia contains two grains of the\r\nsalt in an ounce of wine.\r\n\r\nBefore 1856 poisoning by antimony was of rare occurrence, but since\r\nthat year several cases of chronic poisoning have occurred, giving to\r\nthis substance considerable importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Antimonial Poisoning\r\n\r\n_Acute._--Tartar emetic is an irritant poison, but possesses slight\r\ncorrosive properties. When taken in large doses, two or three drachms,\r\nit gives rise to a metallic taste in the mouth, which is not easily\r\nremoved. In most cases, violent vomiting follows immediately after the\r\npoison is swallowed, the vomiting continuing even after the stomach\r\nis emptied of its contents. In a few cases, however, even when a\r\nlarge dose has been taken, vomiting may be absent. Burning pain is\r\nfelt at the pit of the stomach, accompanied with cramps in the belly\r\nand purging. There is considerable difficulty in swallowing, and the\r\npatient complains of tightness and constriction in the throat. The\r\nmouth and throat in some cases are excoriated, or covered with whitish\r\naphthous-looking spots, which ultimately become brown or black. In some\r\ncases the thirst is intense; in others, absent or nearly so. Cramps\r\nin the lower extremities, almost amounting in some cases to tetanic\r\nspasms, followed by extreme depression, are generally the precursor of\r\na fatal termination. The urine may be suppressed, as is the case in\r\narsenical poisoning; in some cases it has even been increased. On this\r\npoint, however, the statements of observers differ. Trousseau says that\r\nthe urine is suppressed; Huseman that it is _never_ suppressed. The\r\nskin is in some cases covered by a pustular eruption, not unlike that\r\nof smallpox. Dobie has recorded a case of poisoning by tartar emetic in\r\nwhich a comatose condition was present. In antimonial poisoning, even\r\nin the most desperate cases, there is always greater hope of recovery\r\nthan in arsenical poisoning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of tartarated\r\nantimony, × 50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--The symptoms which mark the chronic form of poisoning\r\ndiffer chiefly in being less intense and less rapid than in the acute.\r\nChronic poisoning by small repeated doses is that form of poisoning\r\nwhich appears most in vogue of late years--as certain diseases,\r\nenteritis, etc., can be simulated by the administration of repeated\r\nsmall doses. The unfortunate victim complains of constant nausea and\r\nretching, with great depression. Food is objected to, as it only\r\nincreases the vomiting. The matters vomited are at first merely mucus,\r\nbut after a time they become mixed with bile. Each time the poison is\r\nrepeated, the symptoms become aggravated. Emaciation gradually sets in,\r\nand the person dies from complete exhaustion, or from the effects of\r\na larger dose than usual. Chronic poisoning has given rise to several\r\nerrors in diagnosis, and the histories of recorded cases should put\r\nmedical men on their guard. In all doubtful cases examine the urine.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The mucous membrane of the throat, gullet,\r\nand stomach is inflamed, and in some places softened and corroded.\r\nAphthous-looking spots are not infrequently found on the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach, and these may also be observed on the throat\r\nand on the small intestines. The liver has been found in some cases of\r\nchronic poisoning, where the fatal termination has been for some time\r\nretarded, enlarged, and its structure so soft as to be easily broken\r\ndown. Fatty degeneration of the internal organs has been found after\r\nprotracted fatal administration of the drug. It is stated that in\r\nBrunswick the fatty livers of the geese are produced by the judicious\r\nadministration of antimony. The appearances above detailed may be more\r\nor less absent or present, according to the time that may have elapsed\r\nfrom the swallowing of the poison to the time at which death has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nAt the _post-mortem_ examination on the body of Mr. Bravo, poisoned\r\nwith tartar emetic in 1876, the mucous surfaces of the stomach and\r\nduodenum were found pale and yellowish. Ulcers were present in the\r\ncæcum, and the rest of the large intestine blood-stained, but not\r\nulcerated. Stevenson records the _post-mortem_ appearances of the\r\nbodies of three women poisoned by tartar emetic (_B. M. J._, 1903,\r\nvol. i. p. 873). They are of peculiar interest in reference to the\r\npreservative action of antimony upon the bodies of those poisoned by\r\nit. In the case of M. E. Marsh, upon whose body the examination was\r\nmade eight days after death, there was no odour of putrefaction, the\r\nbowels were in a condition of acute catarrh and streaky congestion\r\nwithout ulceration.\r\n\r\nThe body of Bessie Taylor had been buried for twenty-one months;\r\nordinary putrefactive changes were absent, and with the exception of\r\nthe integuments, it was in a remarkably good state of preservation.\r\nThe alimentary canal showed acute non-ulcerative gastro-enteritis, the\r\nstomach and duodenum were of a cinnabar-red colour, the jejunum also\r\nin patches. The ileum was covered with orange-red mucus in its lower\r\nportion, and there was an orange-coloured patch twelve inches above\r\nthe ileo-cæcal valve. The patch on analysis was proved to contain\r\nantimonious sulphide. Similar orange patches were present in the colon\r\nand upper portion of the rectum. There were no ulcerations, but the\r\nmucous membrane of the intestines was of a dull cinnabar-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe body of Mary J. Spink was exhumed five years after burial, and\r\npresented a life-like aspect; there was no putrefactive odour, and\r\nno larvæ present. The stomach and intestines were of a cinnabar-red\r\ncolour; there were no ulcerations; the intestines contained\r\norange-coloured mucus.\r\n\r\n\r\nElimination of Antimony from the System\r\n\r\nAntimony, taken in a large dose, or in small doses frequently repeated,\r\nappears to be rapidly absorbed, and then eliminated from the system by\r\nthe kidneys. Dating from the time at which the poison was swallowed, it\r\nwill be found in the organs of the body in the following order:--\r\n\r\n    1. Stomach and bowels, but slightly in the liver.\r\n\r\n    2. Absent from the stomach, but present in the liver,\r\n       spleen, and kidneys--traces in the blood.\r\n\r\n    3. Present in the fat and bones, with traces in the liver,\r\n       fæces, and urine.\r\n\r\n    4. The period required for its complete elimination from the\r\n       vital organs varies from fifteen to thirty days.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the presence of antimony in the stomach and intestines\r\npoints to the recent administration of the poison; and its absence\r\nfrom those organs, and presence in the others above mentioned, to a\r\nmore remote period of administration. It has been suggested that in\r\nsome cases the poison may be eliminated by the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach. This assumption has been proved to be correct, for it has been\r\nshown that antimony may be found in the stomach after the inhalation of\r\nantimoniuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--It is impossible to state with certainty the exact\r\namount of antimony--tartar emetic--which may prove fatal, as recoveries\r\nhave taken place even after an ounce had been taken. Large doses are\r\nuncertain in their effects, as the severe vomiting which they produce\r\ngenerally helps to get rid of the poison. In small doses, death may\r\nresult from the depressing action which it exerts over the heart.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From a few hours to several weeks, and even months.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Promote vomiting by the administration of warm water,\r\nor warm greasy water, or the stomach may be washed out with a syphon\r\ntube, unless the chloride of antimony is the poison, and then give\r\ntannic acid in drachm doses in warm water, or any vegetable infusion\r\ncontaining tannin--viz., tea, oak bark, or cinchona bark. Demulcent\r\ndrinks may be administered, and warmth applied. Opium may be given to\r\nrelieve pain, and stimulants for the depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Detection of Antimony\r\n\r\nPrepare the solutions of the liver and other solid organs, and also the\r\ncontents of the stomach, as described under the detection of arsenic,\r\nusing tartaric acid instead of hydrochloric acid. Through a portion\r\nof one of the solutions, obtained by filtration or dialysis, pass a\r\ncurrent of sulphuretted hydrogen, which will produce, if antimony be\r\npresent, an orange-coloured precipitate of the sulphide of antimony.\r\nThe precipitated sulphide is dissolved by hot hydrochloric acid with\r\nthe evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen; and if the resulting solution\r\nbe poured into water, a white precipitate is formed of oxychloride of\r\nantimony, soluble in tartaric acid. Chloride of bismuth is precipitated\r\nwhen poured into water, but the precipitate is turned black by sulphide\r\nof ammonium, the antimonial orange-red; the precipitate of bismuth is\r\nnot soluble in tartaric acid, the antimonial is soluble.\r\n\r\nMarsh‘s and Reinsch‘s processes may also be used for the detection of\r\nantimony. The former is, however, open to the objection that antimony,\r\nwhen present in any quantity, rapidly precipitates on the zinc in the\r\nform of a flocculent black deposit, while the issuing gas is found to\r\ncontain only traces of the metal.\r\n\r\nReinsch‘s process is, however, very delicate, and its application is in\r\nevery respect similar to that in use for the detection of arsenic. The\r\nacid liquid should, however, be boiled down to a small bulk with the\r\ncopper, before a conclusion is drawn as to the entire absence of the\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n    Table giving the Characteristic Reactions of Antimonial\r\n    and Arsenical Deposits on Copper.\r\n\r\n    --------------------+----------------------------+----------------\r\n                        |          Antimony.         |      Arsenic.\r\n    --------------------+----------------------------+----------------\r\n     The colour of the  | Lustrous, with a violet    | Dark steel-grey\r\n       deposit on copper|   hue.                     |   colour, and\r\n       by Reinsch‘s     |                            |   lustrous.\r\n       process is--     |                            |\r\n                        |                            |\r\n     The coated copper  | No effect, or only a       | Well-marked\r\n       heated in the end|   trifling white sublimate,|   sublimate of\r\n       of a small tube. |   non-crystalline,         |   octahedral\r\n                        |   non-volatile.

When\r\nthe coated copper is heated in a glass tube, there is a sublimate of\r\nmetallic mercury readily aggregating into globules on being rubbed with\r\na glass rod. If the deposit is trifling in quantity, a magnifying-glass\r\nshould be used to identify the metallic globules. This test at once\r\ndistinguishes a deposit on copper due to mercury from that produced\r\nunder similar conditions by arsenic or antimony.\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Analysis._--Take a measured quantity of the suspected\r\nliquid and precipitate thoroughly with sulphuretted hydrogen.

If applied to the skin in a\r\nfinely-divided state, as in mercurial ointment, or internally, as blue\r\npill, its toxic effects may be produced. The vapour given off from the\r\nmetal is highly poisonous, producing salivation, emaciation, and death.\r\nA singular accident of poisoning by mercurial vapour occurred on board\r\nH.M.S. _Triumph_ in 1810, owing to the bursting of bladders containing\r\nlarge quantities of the metal; in three weeks 200 men were affected\r\nwith salivation, etc., nearly all the cattle on board died, as well as\r\nthe mice, a dog, and a canary-bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of corrosive\r\nsublimate, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrosive Sublimate\r\n\r\nThis is the most important of the preparations of mercury. It occurs\r\neither in crystalline masses of prismatic crystals or as a white\r\npowder. It is now known among chemists as the perchloride, though it\r\nis frequently spoken of as the bichloride, chloride, and oxymuriate of\r\nmercury. It has a powerful metallic and styptic taste, and is soluble\r\nin about sixteen parts of cold water and three of boiling water.\r\nAlcohol and ether readily dissolve it, the _latter having the power of\r\nabstracting it from its solution in water_. This property of ether is\r\nof importance as a means of separating corrosive sublimate from its\r\nsolution in other liquids. It is important to remember that corrosive\r\nsublimate is soluble in alcohol (R. _v._ Walsh). The liquor hydrargyri\r\nperchloridi of the Pharmacopœia contains half a grain of the salt to a\r\nfluid ounce of water. Half a grain of the muriate of ammonia is added\r\nto increase the solubility of the mercurial salt. Applied externally\r\nto the unbroken skin, corrosive sublimate has caused death in several\r\ncases, the symptoms being almost identical with those which follow the\r\nentrance of the poison into the stomach. Toxic symptoms have followed\r\nintra-uterine or vaginal injections of solution of perchloride of\r\nmercury, also when it has been used to wash out abscess cavities.\r\nAcute poisoning, in some cases fatal, has resulted from the external\r\napplication of corrosive sublimate to ulcers and tumours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Poisoning by Corrosive Sublimate\r\n\r\n_Acute._--The symptoms come on almost immediately the poison is\r\nswallowed. A strong metallic coppery taste in the mouth is experienced,\r\nand a choking sensation in the throat. Pain of a burning character\r\nis felt, extending from the mouth to the stomach, followed by nausea\r\nand vomiting of stringent mucus, more or less tinged with blood, and\r\nviolent purging, the evacuations being also mixed with blood and mucus.\r\nThe pulse is feeble, quick, and irregular; the countenance flushed\r\nor pale, and the tongue white and shrivelled. This appearance of the\r\ntongue is not present in all cases. Broncho pneumonia may occur. The\r\nskin is cold and clammy, and the functions of the kidneys are altered\r\nand albuminuria present, there being in many cases complete suppression\r\nof urine. As is the case with other irritant poisons, the symptoms and\r\neffects produced admit of considerable variation. Thus, there may be\r\nno pain in the stomach, and no purging. Salivation is present in some\r\ncases, but chiefly in those in whom the fatal termination is somewhat\r\nprolonged. This sign is not infrequently absent. Poisoning with\r\ncorrosive sublimate differs from arsenical poisoning in the following\r\nparticulars:--Corrosive sublimate has a distinct metallic taste,\r\narsenic is almost tasteless; the symptoms in the former supervene\r\nimmediately the poison is swallowed, in the latter there is a short\r\ndelay. The discharges in corrosive sublimate are more frequently bloody\r\nthan in arsenic poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--The symptoms present in this form of poisoning are\r\nmodified by the size of the dose, and the interval allowed to elapse\r\nbetween each dose. Nausea, followed by occasional vomiting, and pains\r\nin the stomach, are complained of by the patient. There is general\r\nconstitutional disturbance, with anæmia and cachexia, and consequent\r\nmental depression. Salivation, as might be expected, is a more\r\nprominent symptom than in acute poisoning; but the salivation may be\r\nintermittent--that is, it may cease and then reappear, even after the\r\nlapse of months, without an additional dose of mercury having been\r\ngiven in the interval. Salivation may also come on in the course of\r\ncertain diseases, attacking the salivary glands, and it may also be\r\nproduced by other causes--pregnancy, etc. The glands of the mouth\r\nbecome swollen and painful, the gums tender, and the teeth loosened\r\nfall out of the mouth. Periostitis of the jaw may occur. The breath\r\nhas a peculiar, offensive smell, the bowels are irritable, and\r\ndiarrhœa is not infrequently present. It must be borne in mind that\r\nin certain diseases--granular disease of the kidney--the smallest\r\ndose of any mercurial preparation may produce profuse ptyalism. And\r\nthe toxicologist must be careful not to mistake the affection known\r\nas _cancrum oris_, or “the canker,” most common in delicate, ill-fed\r\nchildren and adults, for the effects of mercury. The nervous system\r\nis more or less affected, neuralgic pains and mercurial tremors\r\nbeing present in many cases. The tremors commence in the tongue and\r\nface and spread to the arms and legs--they are similar to those of\r\nparalysis agitans; at first they are invoked by exertion, finally they\r\nbecome continuous; they cease during sleep. Paralysis may also occur,\r\nespecially in those exposed to the vapour of mercury. Habit appears to\r\nexert some influence on the action of corrosive sublimate, if we may\r\naccept the story of the old man of Constantinople, who for thirty years\r\ntook large doses till his daily allowance was a drachm, and then died\r\nat the respectable age of one hundred years.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The morbid appearances are chiefly\r\nconfined, as is the case with arsenic, to the stomach and bowels;\r\nbut the corrosive action of the mercurial sublimate is more marked.\r\nInflammation more or less intense is always present in the stomach, the\r\nmucous membrane of which may be found of a slate-grey colour, corroded,\r\nand so soft as to scarcely admit of the removal of the organ without\r\ntearing it. The cæcum and rectum are also sometimes found inflamed,\r\nand the mucous membrane softened. Perforation of the stomach is very\r\nrare, only one case having been recorded in which this was present. The\r\nmouth, throat, and gullet may also present signs of the action of the\r\npoison similar to those just described as seen in the stomach. Patches\r\nof pneumonia are present in the lungs of some cases, and the kidneys\r\nshow coagulative and desquamative nephritis.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--The smallest dose was _two grains_ in the case of a\r\nchild, but the exact amount to cause death in an adult has not been\r\naccurately determined. Recovery has taken place after one hundred\r\ngrains has been taken.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From half an hour to five days. No exact time can\r\nbe stated. In one case death took place on the twelfth day after\r\nswallowing seventy grains of the perchloride.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Vomiting, if present, must be encouraged; if absent, it\r\nmust be produced by emetics--zinc sulphate or cupric sulphate, followed\r\nby copious draughts of warm water. The hypodermic injection of ¹/₂₀ to\r\n⅒ grain of apomorphine may also be used to produce vomiting. Albumen,\r\nthe white of egg, or vegetable gluten produced from flour by washing it\r\nin a muslin bag, should be given. The albuminate of mercury so formed\r\nshould be quickly removed by an emetic or lavage by means of a soft\r\ntube and funnel in mild cases, as it is soluble in excess of albumen,\r\nand may be digested or absorbed. The rapid removal of the poison from\r\nthe stomach, however, is the end to which all our exertions must tend.\r\nThe forcible use of the stomach pump should not be employed if it\r\ncan possibly be avoided, as it may greatly injure the softened mucous\r\nmembrane of the gullet and stomach. Opium may be given to relieve pain,\r\nand opium enemata to relieve purging and tenesmus.\r\n\r\n=Calomel=\r\n\r\nCalomel, or the subchloride of mercury, is not used as a poison.\r\nIn large doses it may act as an irritant poison, and death has not\r\ninfrequently occurred even from comparatively small doses. Profuse\r\nsalivation and gangrene of the mouth have resulted from its use,\r\nand cases are recorded of death resulting from these. In many\r\ncases idiosyncrasy appears to modify, more or less, the action of\r\nthis preparation of mercury. The poisonous effect of calomel has\r\nbeen attributed to--(1) Adulteration with corrosive sublimate. (2)\r\nConversion of the calomel into corrosive sublimate by the action of the\r\nhydrochloric acid of the gastric juice.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--The free acid of the gastric juice is probably in too small a\r\nquantity to materially alter the composition of the calomel.\r\n\r\n=Ammonio-Chloride of Mercury=\r\n\r\nWhite precipitate may, if taken in large doses, produce alarming\r\neffects, but it cannot be regarded as an active poison. Pavy‘s\r\nexperiments on rabbits indicate that it is a more powerful poison than\r\nwas formerly thought to be the case. Its action is that of an irritant,\r\naccompanied with, in some cases, severe salivation.\r\n\r\n=Red Precipitate=\r\n\r\nRed oxide of mercury possesses poisonous properties, but it is\r\nseldom employed as a poison. The symptoms most frequently present\r\nare vomiting, coldness of the surface of the body, stupor, pain in\r\nthe abdomen, and cramps of the muscles of the lower extremities. The\r\nvomited matters are generally mixed with some of the red oxide.\r\n\r\n=Cinnabar. Vermilion=\r\n\r\nA compound of sulphur and mercury in the form of a dark red crystalline\r\nmass is known as cinnabar; and to the same substance reduced to a fine\r\npowder the name vermilion has been given. It is used as a red pigment.\r\nIt can scarcely be considered as a poison, Orfila asserting that it\r\nis not poisonous. The vapour of this substance appears, however, to\r\nbe capable of producing severe symptoms, and in one case, profuse\r\nsalivation resulted from the application of the vapour to the body.\r\n\r\n=Cyanide of Mercury=\r\n\r\nThis substance, though an active poison little inferior to corrosive\r\nsublimate, is seldom used as such, probably from its being better known\r\nto chemists than to the general public. It differs from corrosive\r\nsublimate in having no local corrosive action. It has been supposed,\r\nbut proof is wanting, that its injurious effects are due to its\r\ndecomposition by the acids of the stomach and the formation of prussic\r\nacid. Death has occurred in nine days from a dose of ten grains. It\r\nacts as an irritant. The sulphocyanide of mercury is used in the\r\nmanufacture of the toy known as Pharaoh‘s serpents.\r\n\r\n=Turbith Mineral=\r\n\r\nA powerful irritant poison, but seldom used. A drachm has caused death\r\nin a boy sixteen years of age. Coldness of the surface, burning pain in\r\nthe stomach and bowels, with other symptoms of irritant poisoning, were\r\npresent. After death, the mucous membranes of the throat, stomach, and\r\nbowels were found considerably inflamed.\r\n\r\n=Nitrates of Mercury=\r\n\r\nThese substances--the nitrate and sub-nitrate--are used in the arts for\r\nvarious purposes. They act as powerful irritant poisons, with symptoms\r\nand _post-mortem_ appearances not unlike those before described when\r\nspeaking of corrosive sublimate and other irritants.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis_:\r\n\r\n    Table showing the Reaction of Mercuric and\r\n    Mercurous Salts with Reagents\r\n\r\n    -------------------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                           Mercuric Salts\r\n    -------------------------------+------------------------------------\r\n     1.

(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_A._--If the contents of the stomach are under examination, they should\r\nbe diluted with distilled water, filtered, and the residue pressed and\r\nreserved for further examination.\r\n\r\nThe liquid thus obtained may be concentrated, and, while still warm,\r\nslightly acidified with hydrochloric acid. A slip of zinc foil, with\r\na piece of gold foil twisted round it, is then introduced. If mercury\r\nbe present, the gold will, sooner or later, lose its yellow colour,\r\nand its surface become white and silvery, while the zinc is wholly or\r\npartially dissolved. The gold being removed, separated from the zinc,\r\nwashed first with water and then with ether, is divided into two equal\r\nparts. One half may be heated in a reduction tube, when it will yield a\r\nsublimate of metallic mercury, identified by the spherical form of the\r\nglobules under a magnifying-glass, and their metallic reflection and\r\ncomplete opacity. The other half of the gold may be treated with nitric\r\nacid and heated, which will dissolve off the mercury. The resulting\r\nsolution, after expelling the excess of acid by evaporation, will give\r\na scarlet precipitate with iodide of potassium soluble in excess; and,\r\nwith protochloride of tin, a black precipitate of metallic mercury.\r\n\r\n_B._--For the detection of mercury in the insoluble form, the residue\r\nfrom _A_ is dried; or, if the tissues are under examination, they\r\nshould be finely divided, and freed from superfluous moisture. In\r\neither case, the substance is boiled in moderately strong nitric or\r\nhydrochloric acid (about one part of acid to four of water). After\r\ndigestion for some time, the liquid is filtered, concentrated, and\r\ntested as in _A_. When there is reason to infer the presence of\r\ncorrosive sublimate in considerable quantity in an organic liquid,\r\nadvantage may be taken of the solubility of the salt in ether, and\r\nthe power possessed by this liquid of abstracting it from its aqueous\r\nsolutions. The liquid is agitated with an equal volume of ether, the\r\nethereal solution poured off and allowed to spontaneously evaporate,\r\nwhen the corrosive sublimate will be left in white silky prisms,\r\nyielding all the characteristic reactions of the salt. In obscure cases\r\nof salivation, the saliva should be examined as follows: Take about\r\ntwo drachms of the saliva, acidulate with pure hydrochloric acid, and\r\nimmerse in the mixture a very small piece of copper gauze attached\r\nto a platinum wire, and set aside in a warm place for some hours. If\r\nmercury be present, the copper will be covered with a white coating;\r\nthis should be washed and heated in a reduction tube, when globules of\r\nmercury will be formed, and examined with a lens.\r\n\r\n_C._--Mercury in solution may be detected by Reinsch‘s process. On\r\nboiling with pure copper foil after acidifying the solution with\r\nhydrochloric acid, the mercury is deposited on the copper in the\r\nmetallic state, as a whitish silvery film, which can be polished\r\nto a silvery mirror surface. On washing the film in water, ether,\r\nand absolute alcohol and allowing it to dry, then subliming it in a\r\nreduction tube by the aid of heat, the mercury deposits on the cool\r\npart of the tube in the form of minute globules, which may be easily\r\nrecognised through the microscope. If a small crystal of iodine be now\r\nplaced in the tube and gently warmed so as to volatilise it, but not\r\nthe mercury, and the tube be left to stand for a short time, the iodine\r\ncombines with the mercury to form the scarlet iodide, the colour of\r\nwhich renders it easy of recognition.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bonnewyn, the presence of an extremely small quantity of\r\ncorrosive sublimate (¹/₅₀₀₀₀) in calomel may be detected by immersing\r\na clean knife blade, moistened with alcohol or ether, in the suspected\r\ncalomel. A black spot is formed on the steel very difficult of removal.\r\nNo spot is formed when the calomel is pure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD\r\n\r\nMetallic lead is not poisonous; but it appears probable that when it\r\nis acted upon by the acids of the intestinal secretions, it may become\r\nso changed as to produce unpleasant symptoms. Any salt of lead is\r\npoisonous when in a condition to be absorbed into the system.\r\n\r\nSugar of lead and white lead are alone important, and will therefore be\r\nbriefly considered.\r\n\r\n=Sugar of Lead=\r\n\r\nAcetate of Lead.   Subacetate.   Goulard‘s Extract\r\n\r\n_General Character._--The acetate of lead, better known as sugar\r\nof lead, is not unlike loaf-sugar in its general appearance. It is\r\nusually met with in the form of solid crystalline masses of a white or\r\nbrownish-white colour. To the taste it is sweet, a metallic astringent\r\ntaste being left in the mouth. Acetate of lead is soluble in water and\r\nin alcohol. The subacetate is a more active poison than the neutral\r\nacetate. Sugar of lead is popularly considered as an active poison, but\r\nthis does not appear to be the case. Sir R. Christison gave eighteen\r\ngrains daily in divided doses for eight or ten days with no other\r\nunpleasant symptoms than slight colicky pains in the abdomen. Lead is\r\nprobably eliminated from the system by the urine, and also by the milk;\r\nbut there is reason to believe that when once deposited in the body,\r\nsome considerable time is required for its complete elimination. Dr.\r\nWilson is of opinion that in chronic lead poisoning the lead is more\r\nlargely deposited in the spleen than in any other organ of the body.\r\nThis organ should therefore always be carefully examined in suspected\r\ncases of poisoning by this metal.\r\n\r\n_Goulard‘s Extract_ is a solution of the subacetate of lead. It may be\r\nof a reddish colour, from the employment of common vinegar in the place\r\nof pure acetic acid in the manufacture.\r\n\r\n_Goulard‘s Lotion_ is the extract diluted with water.\r\n\r\n=White Lead=\r\n\r\nWhite lead, carbonate of lead, ceruse, or kremser white, is used as a\r\npigment. It is generally in the form of white, heavy chalky masses,\r\ninsoluble in water, and, when taken in large doses, poisonous. It is\r\nthis substance which, in the majority of cases, causes chronic lead\r\npoisoning, or _painter‘s colic_.\r\n\r\nThe _chloride_ and _nitrate_, the oxides, _litharge_ and _red\r\nlead_, are all poisonous; but the _sulphate_, due probably to its\r\ninsolubility, appears to be inert.\r\n\r\nLead poisoning may result from--\r\n\r\n1. Constant contact with lead and its salts in manufactories.\r\n\r\n2. Its use in the arts and as a pigment. The injurious effects of\r\nthis substance are strikingly seen among painters, the makers of\r\nglazed cards, and the workmen engaged in preparing Brussels lace--this\r\nmaterial being whitened by beating white lead into it. All thus\r\nemployed are liable to suffer more or less from chronic poisoning.\r\n\r\n3. Its application to the surface of the body in the form of ointment,\r\nplasters, cosmetics, and hair-dyes.\r\n\r\n4. Drinking water impregnated with lead, from being stored in leaden\r\ncisterns or conveyed in leaden pipes.\r\n\r\n“The action of water upon lead is much modified by the presence of\r\nsaline substances. It is increased by chlorides and nitrates, and\r\ndiminished by carbonates, sulphates, and phosphates, and especially\r\nby carbonate of lime, which, held in solution by excess of carbonic\r\nacid, is a frequent ingredient of spring and river water. But water\r\nhighly charged with carbonic acid may become dangerously impregnated\r\nwith lead, in the absence of any protecting salt, in consequence of\r\nits solvent power over carbonate of lead. In general, water which is\r\nnot discoloured by sulphuretted hydrogen may be considered as free\r\nfrom lead; but there are few waters which have passed through leaden\r\npipes, or have been retained in leaden cisterns, in which a minute\r\nanalysis will not detect a trace of the metal; and were it not for the\r\ngreat convenience of lead, iron pipes and slate cisterns would, from a\r\nsanitary point of view, be in all cases preferable.\r\n\r\n“Another case of contamination by lead may arise from electric action,\r\nas where iron, copper, or tin is in contact with or soldered into lead;\r\nand in these cases, owing to the action of alkaline bases as well as\r\nof acids upon the lead, danger may occur when it is thrown into an\r\nelectro-negative as well as into an electro-positive state.\r\n\r\n“Cisterns are sometimes corroded and their bottoms are perforated by\r\npieces of mortar having dropped into them, the lime of which has caused\r\nthe oxidation of the metal and a solution of the oxide.”\r\n\r\n5. Lead may also find its way into the system by means of the food.\r\nFarinaceous foods, chocolate, and tea may become contaminated if lead\r\nwrappers be used; and confectionery from the use of lead chromate as a\r\ncolouring agent. The use of leaden vessels in the manufacture of cider\r\nis attended with danger, and also the keeping of pickles in glazed\r\nearthenware jars. The celebrated “Devonshire Colic” was the result\r\nof cider-making in leaden vats. Beer may be contaminated with lead\r\nif allowed to stand in leaden pipes overnight. Rum has been known to\r\nhave been dangerously impregnated with lead, leaden worms having been\r\nused attached to the stills. Many tobacconists are in the habit of\r\nusing lead foil to wrap up their tobacco and snuff; this practice has\r\nresulted in several cases of chronic lead poisoning. Soda and Seltzer\r\nwaters may contain lead when kept in syphons with leaden caps or valves.\r\n\r\n6. Acute and subacute cases of poisoning occur from the taking of lead\r\nin the form of diachylon pills to procure abortion.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms of Poisoning by Lead=\r\n\r\n_Acute._--A metallic taste in the mouth, accompanied with dryness in\r\nthe throat and intense thirst, is experienced by the patient soon after\r\nthe poison is swallowed. In some cases, however, _two or more hours_\r\nmay elapse before the effects of the poison begin to show themselves.\r\nVomiting may or may not be present. Twisting colicky pains are felt\r\nin the abdomen, relieved in some cases by pressure. The paroxysms\r\nof pain may be separated by intervals of ease. The bowels are, as a\r\nrule, obstinately confined, and the fæces are of a dark colour, from\r\nthe formation of the sulphuret of lead. The skin is cold, the pulse\r\nquick and weak, and there is considerable prostration of strength. In\r\nsome cases the patient suffers from cramps of the calves of the legs,\r\nand sometimes, in protracted cases, paralysis of one or more of the\r\nextremities may supervene. The effect on the nervous system, headache,\r\ntemporary blindness, is marked by giddiness, and stupor, in some\r\ncases delirium even resembling acute mania, terminating in coma, or\r\nconvulsions and death. Albuminuria may occur.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--This form of poisoning generally occurs among painters,\r\nmanufacturers of white lead, pewterers, and others. The early symptoms\r\nare those of ordinary colic, only more severe. The patient generally\r\ncomplains, in the first instance, of feeling unwell, and of general\r\ndebility. He then suffers from pain of a twisting, grinding nature,\r\nfelt in the region of the navel, the abdomen being retracted and hard.\r\nThe bowels are obstinately confined. The appetite becomes capricious,\r\nand may be entirely lost. The mouth is parched, the breath fœtid, the\r\ncountenance sallow, the skin dry, and general emaciation sets in. A\r\nnasty sweetish metallic taste in the mouth is present in most cases.\r\nNot infrequently the subjects of lead poisoning experience a peculiar\r\nform of paralysis of the upper extremities, well known as “dropped\r\nhand.” It appears that this condition is the result of paralysis of\r\nthe extensor muscles of the wrist, the long supinator escaping. In\r\nother cases the muscles of the shoulder girdle or pelvic girdle and\r\nlegs may be affected. Acute general paralysis has occurred in workers\r\nwith lead, and may prove fatal. Optic neuritis and optic atrophy occur\r\nin some cases. Persistent headache may be present in others. The\r\nmuscles undergo a form of fatty degeneration. The lead appears to act\r\nprimarily on the muscles, then on the nerves, and lastly on the nerve\r\ncentres. The absorption of lead causes marked anæmia with degeneration\r\nof the red corpuscles, which show marked punctate basophilia. One\r\nother symptom of importance has yet to be noticed. The gums, at their\r\nmargins where they join the teeth, present a _well-marked blue line,\r\nabsent where a tooth has been removed_. This is not present in all\r\ncases, but it should be looked for. Chronic lead absorption produces\r\ncardiovascular changes with arterio-sclerosis, valvular degeneration,\r\ncardiac hypertrophy, and chronic renal changes with albuminuria.\r\nClosely associated with these conditions are saturnine arthritis\r\nand gout. The effects upon the vessels may predispose to cerebral\r\nhæmorrhage or lead encephalopathy. Cicconardi suggests as a method of\r\ndiagnosis in lead poisoning, where the cause of the colic is uncertain,\r\nto paint the skin with a 6 per cent. solution of sodium sulphite. If\r\nlead be the cause the painted part will become darkened in colour.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--The symptoms produced by white lead--carbonate\r\n    of lead--are those of _colica pictonum_, or _painter‘s colic_,\r\n    described under the head of Chronic Lead Poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--In acute poisoning the mucous membrane of\r\nthe stomach and intestines is inflamed, and is in some cases covered by\r\nlayers of white or whitish-yellow mucus, more or less impregnated with\r\nthe salt of lead swallowed. Corrosion of the mucous membrane may occur\r\nif the dose be large, and this condition is more frequently present\r\nwhen the neutral salt is taken.\r\n\r\nIn chronic poisoning there are no constant _post-mortem_ appearances.\r\nThe muscles of the paralysed extremity are usually found flaccid, of a\r\ncream colour, and the subject of fatty degeneration.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Sugar of lead is not an active poison, recovery having\r\ntaken place after one ounce had been swallowed.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach should be emptied by means of the pump or\r\nsyphon tube, followed by the free administration of the sulphates of\r\nsoda and magnesia. The carbonates should not be given, the carbonate\r\nof lead being poisonous. Vomiting should be promoted, and a powerful\r\ncathartic administered. Albumen and milk should also be given, as these\r\nprecipitate the oxide. In the chronic form of poisoning, the iodide\r\nof potash and aperients, notably the sulphate of magnesia, should be\r\nadministered. Dixon Mann does not consider that iodide of potash is\r\nof any value as an eliminator of lead, as the latter forms a stable\r\ncompound with the tissues. Sulphur baths are also useful in removing\r\nthe lead from the system. Lately the galvanic bath has been tried\r\nwith great success. By way of _prophylaxis_, it has been recommended\r\nthat all those engaged in lead manufactories, or who are obliged to\r\nhandle this metal frequently, should partake largely of lemonade made\r\nwith sulphuric acid, should not take their meals in the factories, or\r\nwithout well washing the hands.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis_.--When the solid acetate is heated on platinum\r\nfoil, it melts, then solidifies, becomes dark in colour, and gives off\r\nfumes of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe following are the liquid tests for lead in solution:\r\n\r\n1. Dilute sulphuric acid gives a white precipitate of the sulphate,\r\nwhich is insoluble in nitric, but soluble in hydrochloric acid, in\r\nexcess of caustic potash solution, and in ammonium acetate solution.\r\n\r\n2. Solution of potassium iodide gives a yellow precipitate, soluble in\r\nboiling water and caustic potash solution.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphuretted hydrogen, or ammonium sulphide, gives a black\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\n4. Potassium bichromate a yellow precipitate.\r\n\r\n=Detection of Lead in Organic Mixtures=\r\n\r\nThe contents of the stomach or vomited matters must be diluted\r\nwith water and filtered. The residue left on the filter, washed\r\nwith distilled water, should be set aside for further examination;\r\nthe filtrate and washings acidified with nitric acid. A current of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen passed through the solution will then throw down\r\nthe whole of the lead, should any of that metal be present, in the\r\nform of a brownish-black sulphide, which may be collected on a small\r\nfilter and dried. The sulphide, boiled with dilute nitric acid, is\r\npartly converted into insoluble sulphate, and in part dissolved as\r\nnitrate. The carefully neutralised solution may be either tested at\r\nonce or carefully concentrated. In either case, the production of a\r\nbright yellow precipitate, with a solution of bichromate of potash, and\r\na similar one with a solution of iodide of potassium, may be taken as\r\nconclusive of the presence of lead. The portion of lead deposited as\r\nsulphate will be found to be soluble in a solution of pure potash, the\r\nresulting liquid giving a brown-black precipitate on the addition of\r\nsulphide of ammonium.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble residue left on the filter should be incinerated in a\r\nporcelain crucible, either with or without nitric acid, care being\r\ntaken not to raise the temperature more than is necessary to produce\r\nthe desired effect: the carbonised mass boiled with dilute nitric\r\nacid evaporated to dryness, extracted with distilled water, and\r\nthen filtered, the filtrate tested as before mentioned. It is often\r\nuseful, as a preliminary test for the presence of lead in a soluble\r\nform, to dip a piece of bibulous paper into the clear liquid obtained\r\nby submitting the contents of the stomach or vomited matters to\r\nfiltration, and then exposing the paper to the action of a current of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. If lead be present, blackening of the paper will\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nTo detect the lead in the urine and fæces, Dixon Mann advised the urine\r\nto be evaporated to the consistency of gruel, and the fæces to be mixed\r\nwith distilled water to a similar consistence; the organic matters are\r\nthen to be destroyed with hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potash\r\nwith the aid of heat, and the solution filtered. The filtrate is then\r\nplaced in a cell with a parchment bottom, and this into another cell\r\ncontaining distilled water acidulated with sulphuric acid. Two pieces\r\nof platinum foil are now placed in the inner and outer cells, separated\r\nby the parchment; that in the inner cell is connected with the cathode,\r\nthat in the outer with the anode of four Grove cells, and the current\r\nclosed for several hours. The lead, if present, is deposited on the\r\nplatinum connected with the cathode.\r\n\r\nThe magnesium method (Marsden & Abram) is useful. A strip of pure\r\nmagnesium is placed in the urine, to which has previously been added\r\nammonium oxalate, about 1 gramme to 150 c.c. Lead, if present, is\r\ndeposited on the magnesium in about half an hour, but it may take some\r\nhours. The strip is washed in distilled water and dried--warmed with a\r\ncrystal of iodine the yellow iodide will form; or the deposit may be\r\ndissolved in HNO₃ and tested in the usual way.\r\n\r\nGoadby recommends inoculating the urine with bacillus coli, which\r\nduring its growth produces H₂S; this precipitates any lead as sulphide.\r\nAfter filtering, the filtrate is dissolved in a small quantity of 10\r\nper cent. nitric acid and tested by the usual methods.\r\n\r\n             Recapitulation of the Leading Facts with regard to\r\n                            Poisoning by Lead\r\n        --------------------+-------------------------------------------\r\n                       ACUTE POISONING.--SYMPTOMS, ETC.\r\n        --------------------+-------------------------------------------\r\n        Action on alimentary| Sweet metallic taste in mouth.

An alloy\r\nof copper is used for ornamenting ginger-bread, &c. All the salts of\r\ncopper are poisonous. The most important are, however, the _sulphate_,\r\n_blue-stone_, or _blue vitriol_, and the _subacetate_ or _verdigris_.\r\n\r\nCopper is eliminated to a slight extent by the urine. It has been\r\nfound in the stomach, liver, and intestines eight months after its\r\nadministration had been discontinued. It has also been detected more\r\nreadily in the bronchial secretion than in the urine.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms of Poisoning by Copper=\r\n\r\n_Acute._--The primary action of the sulphate of copper in from five- to\r\nfifteen-grain doses is that of a quick emetic; in larger doses, a\r\npowerful irritant; but when absorbed, it appears to act chiefly on the\r\nbrain and nervous system. Its irritant action is marked by nausea,\r\nvomiting, griping pain in the belly, which is greatly distended,\r\nand increased flow of saliva. The vomited matters are of a bluish\r\nor greenish colour, and the discharges from the bowels greenish and\r\ncontaining blood. The vomited matters become blue on the addition of\r\nammonia. The above-mentioned symptoms usually follow immediately after\r\nthe poison is swallowed, and rapidly increase in severity. After a\r\ntime, the remote effects supervene, marked by headache, giddiness,\r\nlaboured breathing, quick irregular pulse, coma or convulsions,\r\nparalysis, and death.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by this substance, the convulsions are most violent, and\r\nwild incoherent delirium not infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe subacetate of copper or verdigris produces symptoms not unlike\r\nthose just described. Jaundice and suppression of urine may result when\r\neither this or the sulphate is taken.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--Constant and troublesome irritation of the stomach and\r\nbowels; vomiting and purging, attended with considerable straining\r\nat stool; loss of appetite, loss of power, and general emaciation\r\nset in. The patient is subject to frequent trembling of the limbs,\r\nwhich may end in paralysis. The mouth is unpleasant, and a coppery,\r\nmetallic taste is experienced. Cramps or colicky pains in the belly are\r\nnot infrequently present. Jaundice is sometimes present. The vomited\r\nmatters are greenish; but the practitioner must not be led away, and\r\nthus mistake the colour of the vomited matters which occur in some\r\nmorbid states of the bile, for the result of poisoning by a salt of\r\ncopper. A form of chronic poisoning affecting workers in this metal\r\nhas been described by some French pathologists as “copper-colic.” A\r\ncachectic condition of the system, accompanied with one or more of the\r\nsymptoms already detailed, marks this form of poisoning. _A purple_\r\nline along the margins of the gums is present in some cases.\r\n\r\nCopper poisoning may result from--\r\n\r\n1. Its introduction into the system by using, for culinary purposes,\r\ncopper vessels not properly tinned. An interesting account of poisoning\r\nfrom this source may be found in the second volume of the _Medical\r\nObservations and Inquiries by a Society of Physicians in London_,\r\npublished 1764. The cases there recorded occurred on board ship, with\r\nmost alarming symptoms.\r\n\r\n2. By constant application of the metal to the surface of the body,\r\nnecessitated by certain processes in its manufacture and in its\r\napplication for industrial purposes. M. Michel Levy, however, says\r\nin his work, _Traité d‘Hygiène, Publique et Privée_, that workmen\r\nin copper may pass green-coloured urine and yet be as robust and as\r\nlong-lived as other workmen.\r\n\r\n3. The use of certain preparations of this metal as pigment.\r\n\r\n4. The use of German silver--an alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel--may\r\nbe rendered dangerous by the action of acid food upon the compound.\r\n\r\n5. The use of a salt of copper to give a green fresh colour to certain\r\ntinned vegetables and fruits, peas, &c., now introduced into this\r\ncountry from France.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The mucous membrane of the stomach is\r\ninflamed, the inflammation extending sometimes into the gullet. The\r\nintestines may be found perforated. The lining membrane of the whole\r\nalimentary canal presents a deep green colour, distinguished from that\r\nthe result of a morbid condition of the bile by being turned blue on\r\nthe addition of ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Nothing certain is known as to the exact quantity that\r\nmay prove fatal, as the evidence of the poisonous action of copper is\r\nsomewhat contradictory. It appears to be more dangerous in small doses\r\nthan in large ones. Half an ounce of verdigris or subacetate has proved\r\nfatal to an adult.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--The shortest time on record is four hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Induce vomiting, and assist the emetic action of the\r\ncopper salts by the free use of warm water, milk, or any demulcent\r\ndrink. The stomach tube may be used if vomiting does not occur. As an\r\nantidote, large quantities of albumen and iron filings have been given,\r\nof which the former appears to be most efficacious.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The following are the liquid tests for copper in\r\nsolution:--\r\n\r\n1. Ammonia gives a bluish-white precipitate soluble in excess, forming\r\na blue solution.\r\n\r\n2. Sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonium sulphide give a\r\nchocolate-coloured precipitate.\r\n\r\n3. Ferrocyanide of potassium gives a port-wine colour, or reddish-brown\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\n4. If a bright steel needle be introduced into an acid solution of\r\ncopper, the metal is deposited on the needle.\r\n\r\n5. If a piece of zinc bound with platinum wire be placed in a solution\r\nof a copper salt, the metal is deposited on the platinum; it is turned\r\nviolet on exposure to the vapour from sulphuric acid mixed with\r\npotassium bromide.\r\n\r\n=Detection of Copper in Organic Liquids=\r\n\r\n_A._--The finely-divided tissue, or the contents of the stomach,\r\ndiluted with water, are thrown on a filter, and the insoluble portion\r\nset aside for further treatment. (See _B._)\r\n\r\nThe filtrate and washings may now be concentrated, acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid, and a polished needle inserted in the liquid; and\r\nshould no immediate deposition of metallic copper occur, it may be\r\nallowed to remain for several hours. The colour of the metallic deposit\r\nis highly characteristic of copper. As a corroborative proof, the\r\nconcentrated liquid may be placed in a platinum capsule with some\r\nfragments of zinc, when the copper will be deposited on the platinum\r\ncapsule at the parts in contact with the zinc; the liquid poured off,\r\nand the excess of zinc adhering to the platinum removed by dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid. The copper may now be dissolved off the platinum by\r\nnitric acid, the excess of acid driven off by heat, and the solution\r\nsubjected to the wet tests given above.\r\n\r\n_B._--The insoluble portion from _A_ is incinerated in a porcelain\r\ncrucible. The ash thus obtained is digested in hydrochloric acid\r\nwith the aid of heat, and evaporated nearly to dryness. The residue,\r\ndissolved in distilled water, may be tested as under ‘_A_.’\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC\r\n\r\nThe sulphate and the chloride of zinc are alone important. Poisoning by\r\nthe chloride of zinc has been described (p. 265).\r\n\r\n=Sulphate of Zinc=\r\n\r\nWhite vitriol or white copperas.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The sulphate of zinc acts as a pure irritant. Violent\r\nvomiting, accompanied with pain in the abdomen, and purging, are the\r\nsymptoms which first make their appearance. These may be followed by\r\nsymptoms which betoken collapse, viz. coldness of the limbs, paleness\r\nof the face, irregular pulse, and fainting.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Presence of inflammatory action.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has occurred in four hours.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Distinguished from oxalic acid by remaining fixed\r\nwhen heated on platinum foil.\r\n\r\nIn Solution:\r\n\r\n1. _Ammonia_ gives a white precipitate soluble in excess.\r\n\r\n2. _Ferrocyanide of Potassium_, a white precipitate.\r\n\r\n3. _Sulphuretted Hydrogen or Ammonium Sulphide_, a milky-white\r\nprecipitate in a neutral pure solution.\r\n\r\n4. _Nitrate of Baryta_, a white precipitate showing the presence of\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n5. _Caustic potash_ or _soda_, a white precipitate soluble in excess.\r\n\r\nIn Organic Mixtures pass sulphuretted hydrogen, collect the sulphuret,\r\nand decompose it with boiling hydrochloric acid, then test for zinc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Tea, coffee, milk, warm water, albumen, and in some cases\r\nenemata of gruel and other emollients.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON\r\n\r\nThe preparations of iron which are of importance are the sulphate and\r\nthe muriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulphate of Iron\r\n\r\n_Copperas_ or _Green Vitriol_--has been administered as a poison, but\r\nmore frequently to procure abortion. An ounce has been taken with no\r\nother serious effect than the production of violent pain, purging,\r\nand vomiting. Constant application of this substance to the body\r\nhas produced vomiting, pains in the belly and limbs. These symptoms\r\ndisappear on treatment.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--(1) Hydrosulphuret of ammonia gives a black\r\nprecipitate. (2) Ferrocyanide of potassium added to it, in solution,\r\ngives rise to a greenish-blue precipitate, becoming dark blue on\r\nexposure. (3) Chloride of barium will point to the nature of the acid\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n=Muriate of Iron=\r\n\r\nBetter known as the _Tincture of Sesquichloride of Iron_, or the\r\n_Tinctura Ferri Perchloridi_.--The tincture acts as a corrosive and\r\nirritant poison, death having followed in five weeks after an ounce and\r\na half had been swallowed. It is sometimes used as an abortifacient.\r\nRecovery has, however, taken place after three ounces had been\r\nswallowed. The symptoms present in most cases observed were those of a\r\ncorrosive and irritant.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--(1) The addition of nitrate of silver, causing\r\na white precipitate insoluble in nitric acid, points to the presence\r\nof chlorine. (2) The peroxide of iron, indicated by the formation of\r\nPrussian blue on adding a solution of the ferrocyanide of potassium.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMUTH\r\n\r\nThe preparations of this metal act as irritant poisons, death having\r\noccurred from a dose of two drachms of the sub-nitrate. Dr. Trail\r\n(_Outlines of Medical Jurisprudence_, p. 116) mentions the ease of a\r\npatient of his who took _six drachms_ in three days in divided doses.\r\nThe symptoms were vomiting, extreme pain in the abdomen and throat,\r\na weak, feeble pulse, and much anxiety about the præcordia. Recovery\r\ntook place. A case of severe vomiting during pregnancy, ending fatally,\r\nwas mistaken for arsenic poisoning. The error arose from mistaking a\r\ngreyish powder on the walls of the stomach for arsenic. It turned out\r\non further inquiry that it was bismuth, given medicinally to prevent\r\nthe vomiting. Bismuth carbonate mixed with gruel or bread and milk\r\nis given in large quantities for the purposes of radiography of the\r\nalimentary canal without any untoward effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM\r\n\r\n=Nitrate of Potash=\r\n\r\nThis substance is well known as nitre, saltpetre, and sal prunella. In\r\nlarge doses it acts as an irritant, and cases are recorded in which it\r\nhas been used to poison children. In one case, the presence of crystals\r\nof the salt in some of the dried vomited matter on the child‘s shoe,\r\nled to an explanation of the cause of death.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Those of a pure irritant, to which death must be referred,\r\nand not to any constitutional action of the drug. The nervous symptoms,\r\nwhich are sometimes very marked, are, as is well known, common to the\r\naction of many pure irritants. In some cases there is suppression of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those produced by irritants generally.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Separate the poison by dialysis, evaporate, and\r\ntest the crystals as directed under nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--About an ounce.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Two hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as for other irritants; demulcent drinks.\r\nPromote vomiting.\r\n\r\n=Sulphate of Potash=\r\n\r\n_Sal Polychrist_, _Sal de Duobus_, or sulphate of potash, acts as an\r\nirritant poison, being largely used in France as an abortive. The\r\nsymptoms and the _post-mortem_ appearances are much the same as those\r\nproduced by the nitrate. A like treatment may also be adopted. In the\r\ndetection of this substance, the nitrate of baryta will point to the\r\nacid present, and bichloride of platinum to the presence of potash.\r\n\r\n=Chlorate of Potash=\r\n\r\nThis salt acts as a poison when taken in large doses, producing\r\nsymptoms which might be mistaken for poisoning with arseniuretted\r\nhydrogen, or for such diseases as hæmoglobinuric fever.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These comprise pain in the stomach and bowels with\r\nvomiting, collapse and stupor, cyanosis, jaundice; diminution of the\r\nurine, which contains hæmoglobin, casts, and albumen. It is a question\r\nwhether the jaundice is hæmatogenous or hepatogenous. Chlorate of\r\npotash destroys the red corpuscles, the hæmoglobin is dissolved out and\r\nis set free in the liquor sanguinis.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--45-50 grains proved fatal to a child three years old.\r\nFor an adult 390 grains to an ounce and a half.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From five hours to several days.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach should be washed out through the syphon tube.\r\nVenæsection may be useful, with subsequent transfusion of fresh blood.\r\nThe nephritis and other symptoms must be treated generally.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The mucous membrane of the stomach may be\r\ninflamed and submucous hæmorrhages may be found. The blood is chocolate\r\nin colour and gives the spectrum of methæmoglobin. The spleen is\r\nenlarged and chocolate-coloured, and the kidneys acutely inflamed.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Chlorate of potash may be separated from organic\r\nmaterial by dialysis.\r\n\r\n1. If to a solution of the salt a few drops of indigo sulphate be\r\nadded, and then a few drops of strong sulphuric acid, the indigo-blue\r\nis bleached.\r\n\r\n2. If a small crystal of the chlorate be heated in a test tube with a\r\ndrop of strong sulphuric acid, it explodes with detonation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARIUM\r\n\r\nThe chloride, nitrate, and carbonate of barium are all irritant\r\npoisons. But besides their irritant action, the salts of barium also\r\nappear to act on the nervous system and the heart, arresting its action\r\nin systole. The symptoms, post-mortem appearances, and treatment are\r\nthe same as for the other irritant poisons. Sulphate of magnesia, or\r\nother soluble sulphate, should be given to form an insoluble sulphate\r\nof baryta. Sulphate of barium is also used like bismuth carbonate for\r\nradiography.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Sulphuric acid or alkaline sulphate gives a\r\nwhite precipitate with solution of chloride of baryta, insoluble in\r\nnitric acid. The salts impart to flame a greenish-yellow colour. The\r\nchlorine is detected by nitrate of silver. Dissolve the carbonate in\r\nhydrochloric acid, and test as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM\r\n\r\nTwo compounds of this metal are largely used in the arts for dyeing\r\npurposes--the neutral chromate and the acid bichromate of potash. The\r\nbichromate of potash is a powerful poison, and death may occur from its\r\ndirect action on the nervous system, without the development of any of\r\nthe signs of irritation; in other cases, however, well-marked irritant\r\nsymptoms have been present. Applied externally, it produces deep\r\nfistulous sores, especially on the mucous membrane of the septum of the\r\nnose, in the workmen who are engaged in its manufacture. These sores\r\nare prevented to some extent by taking snuff. Dyers not infrequently\r\nsuffer severely on their arms when using it in the course of their\r\ntrade. Death has resulted in _four hours_ after its administration.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--A solution of the bichromate of potash, added to\r\na solution of acetate of lead, gives a yellow precipitate; with nitrate\r\nof silver, a red. The salt boiled with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid\r\nand alcohol, gives a green liquid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Emetics, magnesia, chalk, demulcent drinks, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE AND ANIMAL IRRITANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mode of Action.=--The general effects produced by the somewhat large\r\nclass of vegetable irritants are--\r\n\r\n1. Severe abdominal pain, accompanied with vomiting and purging.\r\n\r\n2. Absence in most cases of any cerebral or nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\n3. The irritant properties appear to reside in an acrid oil or resin.\r\nIn colchicum, stavesacre, and some others, the presence of an alkaloid\r\nmay account for their active properties.\r\n\r\n4. In medicinal doses, the vegetable irritants act as safe purgatives.\r\n\r\n5. The _post-mortem_ appearances found in the alimentary canal betoken\r\ninflammation, the result of irritation.\r\n\r\n6. Applied externally, they produce inflammation, pustular eruptions,\r\nand sometimes unhealthy callous sores.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVIN\r\n\r\nThe leaves and tops of this plant, _Juniperus Sabina_ (_N.O.\r\nConiferæ_), yield an acrid volatile oil, to the presence of which the\r\npoisonous properties are due. The oil is colourless or pale yellow,\r\nwith a peculiar terebinthinate odour. It is used in medicine both\r\ninternally and externally, and is supposed to possess emmenagogue\r\nproperties. The dried powder is less active than the fresh tops. Savin\r\nis seldom used as a poison, more frequently to procure abortion. Its\r\nuse for this purpose is mentioned in the old ballad of “Marie Hamilton”:\r\n\r\n    “The King has gane to the Abbey garden,\r\n       And pu‘d the savin tree,\r\n     To scale the babe from Marie‘s heart;\r\n       But the thing it wadna be.”\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Those of irritant poisoning. Violent pain in the abdomen,\r\nfollowed by vomiting, and in some cases salivation and strangury.\r\nPurging is not always present. When taken to procure abortion, death\r\noften takes place before the object for which it was taken is attained.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The stomach, gullet, and intestines are\r\nfound congested and inflamed. The stomach may in places be seen\r\ncorroded, and a green powder adherent to its coats. The powder washed\r\nand dried, and then rubbed, gives off the odour of savin.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--When an infusion or decoction of the leaves\r\nhas been taken, chemical analysis is of no assistance. The oil may\r\nbe separated from the contents of the stomach by subjecting them to\r\ndistillation, and then shaking the distillate with ether, when the oil\r\nis dissolved out. On the evaporation of the ether, the oil is left for\r\nexamination. When the powder is taken the contents of the stomach are\r\nnot unlike green pea-soup. If a small portion of the green liquid be\r\ntaken, and diluted with water, the green chlorophyll, being insoluble,\r\nwill sink; but if the colour be due to bile, the liquid will remain of\r\na uniform green colour. If a portion of the green matter be collected,\r\ndried, and then rubbed in a mortar, the characteristic odour of savin\r\nwill be given off. The microscope may detect bits of the twigs.\r\n\r\nThe oil, on the addition of strong sulphuric acid, gives a brown\r\ncolour. On diluting the coloured liquid with water, a dense white\r\nprecipitate forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROTON OIL\r\n\r\nThe oil expressed from the seeds of _Croton tiglium_ (_N.O.\r\nEuphorbiaceæ_).\r\n\r\nThe seeds, when taken, produce violent pains in the stomach and\r\npurging. Pereira has described the case of a man who suffered severely\r\nfrom inhaling the dust of the seeds. The dose of the oil is from half\r\na minim to a minim. Dr. Trail mentions the case of a delicate lady\r\npatient who took three drops for a dose without inconvenience. Dr. Adam\r\nrecords a case (_Edinburgh Medical Journal_, 1856) of a man who, in\r\nmistake, drank three drachms of a liniment containing about fifty drops\r\nof croton oil. After the most alarming symptoms, the patient ultimately\r\nrecovered. Two drachms and a half have caused death (_Journal de Clinic\r\nMédicale_, 1839, p. 509). The poisonous properties depend upon the\r\npresence of a fatty acid.\r\n\r\nA medical friend informed Husband that in Shetland six drops in as many\r\ncolocynth pills have, in cases there, only produced “a comfortable\r\n‘_aisement_’ of the bowels.” This is attributed to the _dura ilia_,\r\nresulting from a constant fish diet.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Pain in the abdomen, vomiting, and purging, followed by\r\nexhaustion and collapse. In some cases, when the dose is large, the\r\npain is hot and burning, and may be felt from the mouth downward.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Separate the oil from the contents of the stomach\r\nby means of ether, and then drive off the ether by means of heat. The\r\noil then warmed with nitric acid becomes of a brown colour, and nitrous\r\nacid vapours are given off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLCHICUM\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of _Colchicum autumnale_, Meadow Saffron\r\n(_N.O. Melanthaceæ_) reside in an alkaloid _Colchicine_, chiefly found\r\nin the corms, but also present in other parts of the plant. The seeds\r\nhave caused death.\r\n\r\nIn June 1875 an epidemic of gastric irritation among the inhabitants\r\nof Rione Boego was traced to the use of the milk of goats which had\r\naccidentally eaten the leaves of colchicum.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Colchicum, in medicinal doses, increases the activity of\r\nthe liver, and bile is freely secreted. The action of the kidneys and\r\nof the skin is also increased. The heart is more or less affected, and\r\nits frequency diminished. In large doses, all the symptoms of irritant\r\npoisoning are present, and in some cases have been likened to those\r\nobserved in Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Death may result from its use without\r\nleaving any morbid appearances. In other cases, however, the usual\r\nsigns of inflammation were present. Casper describes the colour\r\nand condition of the blood in those poisoned by colchicum as dark\r\ncherry-red, with the consistency of treacle. A marked congestion of the\r\nvena cava may also be present.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Colchicine, obtained by Stas process, added to\r\nconcentrated nitric acid, becomes of a violet colour, changing to\r\nblue and brown. The violet solution changes to yellow on dilution\r\nwith water, then to red on adding caustic soda. Tincture of iodine\r\nprecipitates colchicine of a kermes brown colour, platinum bichloride\r\nyellow, and tannic acid white, the precipitate being soluble in\r\nalcohol, acetic acid, and alkaline carbonates. Strong sulphuric acid\r\ngives a yellow colour with colchicine, which changes to green, violet,\r\nand reddish-brown on the addition of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One ounce of the tincture.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stimulants and opium should be given to counteract its\r\ndepressing effects. Tannin is said to be an antidote.\r\n\r\n\r\nERGOT\r\n\r\nLike savin, ergot is more frequently used to procure abortion than as a\r\npoison. When taken in a large dose it causes vomiting, purging, intense\r\nthirst, hurried breathing, and irregularity of the heart‘s action.\r\nErgot appears to act powerfully on non-striated muscular fibre wherever\r\nit exists in the body; hence the vessels contract powerfully, and the\r\nperistaltic action of the intestinal canal is greatly increased. On the\r\npregnant uterus its action is uncertain, as it does not appear to have\r\nany marked power in inducing labour, but on the parturient uterus its\r\neffects are most marked. A case is recorded in the _Lancet_ (vol. ii.\r\n1882) in which ergot had been taken for some time to procure abortion,\r\nbut this end not being accomplished, the patient took “two hands full”\r\nof the powdered ergot to expedite matters, which caused the following\r\nfatal symptoms: There was some amount of jaundice, and the expression\r\nof the face was anxious. Occasionally fits of stupor occurred, and the\r\ngeneral condition of the patient was maudlin, but there was no smell\r\nof alcohol in the breath; but during the course of the case, which\r\nended fatally, a distinct etherish smell could be perceived. The pulse\r\nwas so quick that it could not be counted, and it had also a peculiar\r\njerky feeling under the finger. Attempts were made to induce labour\r\nby passing a _bougie-a-boule_, but the patient died collapsed before\r\ndelivery could be effected.\r\n\r\nWhere the drug has been taken for some time in the form of rye-bread\r\nmade from the diseased grain, the symptoms in some cases are referable\r\nto the nervous system; in others, the blood appears to undergo\r\ncertain changes; and hæmorrhages into the internal organs, as in the\r\ncase just mentioned, have been frequently noticed. Gangrene of one\r\nor more of the extremities has also been known to occur. To chronic\r\npoisoning by this drug the term _Ergotism_ has been applied, and may\r\noccur under two forms--the spasmodic and the gangrenous; the former\r\nmarked by convulsions, giddiness, delirium, dimness of vision, and\r\ntetanic spasms; the latter, as a rule, by dry gangrene of the nose or\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Ergot has a peculiar, slightly fishy odour, which\r\nis increased by rubbing up the powder with liquor potassæ and heating\r\nthe mixture. At the same time it turns a reddish colour. The production\r\nof this odour, and the appearance under the microscope, are the only\r\ntests yet known for this substance in powder. From organic mixture it\r\nmay be extracted with hot alcohol acidulated with sulphuric acid. The\r\nsolution is red in colour, and shows two bands in the spectrum, one in\r\nthe green, and a second, broader and more marked, in the blue.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash out the stomach, and give inhalations of amyl\r\nnitrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HELLEBORE\r\n\r\nThis plant, _Helleborus niger_--Black Hellebore--(_N.O. Ranunculaceæ_),\r\nknown as the Christmas rose, is the melampodium of the old\r\npharmacopœias. All parts of the plant are poisonous.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Purging, vomiting, pain in the bowels, and cold sweats.\r\nDeath is generally preceded by convulsions and insensibility.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those common to the action of other\r\nirritants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HELLEBORE\r\n\r\nWhite Hellebore, _Veratrum album_ (_N.O. Melanthaceæ_), acts very much\r\nin the same manner as the black hellebore, but is more powerful. The\r\npowder causes violent sneezing. The alkaloid _Veratria_ appears to be\r\nthe active principle. The symptoms and _post-mortem_ appearances are\r\nanalogous to those produced by black hellebore.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMBOGE\r\n\r\nGamboge is the gum resin of _Garcinia Morella_. It is an active\r\ningredient in certain quack “vegetable pills.” One drachm has caused\r\ndeath by its irritant action. Owing to the imperfect pulverisation of\r\ngamboge in quack pills, they have caused violent irritation of the\r\nbowels, straining at stool, and prolapsus uteri, due to the irritating\r\naction of small pieces of this substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nJALAP\r\n\r\nJalap, the powder obtained from the tubers of _Exogonium Purga_. The\r\nactive properties of the drug reside in a resin. It is a drastic\r\npurgative; twelve grains have killed a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAMMONY\r\n\r\nScammony is obtained from the dry root of _Convolvulus Scammonia_. Like\r\nthe last mentioned, it is a powerful purgative, and may cause death if\r\ngiven in large doses to debilitated individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR-OIL\r\n\r\nThe oil expressed, with or without the aid of heat, from the seeds of\r\n_Ricinus communis_. A girl, eighteen years of age, died in Liverpool in\r\n1837 from eating a few of the castor-oil seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nARUM MACULATUM\r\n\r\nCuckoo-pint, Wake-robin, or Lords and Ladies, is one of the most acrid\r\nof indigenous vegetables. The active property of the plant appears to\r\nbe lost by drying, and by distillation in water. Children have been\r\npoisoned by its leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEW\r\n\r\nThe twigs and fruit of _Taxus baccata_ act as irritant poisons,\r\nproducing also symptoms which point to cerebro-spinal mischief. A case\r\nis recorded of poisoning by yew leaves, in which only five grains of\r\nthe leaves were found in the stomach; yet death took place within an\r\nhour from the time the symptoms commenced (_British Medical Journal_,\r\n1876, vol. ii. p. 392). In the above-mentioned case, vomiting and other\r\nsigns of gastric irritation were absent. The chief symptoms present\r\nwere--pallor of the face, faintness, an almost imperceptible pulse,\r\nfacial convulsions, foaming at the mouth, stertorous breathing, loss\r\nof consciousness, ending in death. The symptoms are due to an alkaloid\r\ntoxin. Several children have died after eating the fruit. _Post-mortem_\r\nsigns of irritation of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABURNUM\r\n\r\n_Cytisus Laburnum_, or common Laburnum, the seeds, bark, and wood of\r\nwhich are poisonous. They contain a narcotico-acrid, crystallisable\r\nalkaloid--_Cytisine_--producing vomiting, foaming at the mouth,\r\nconvulsions, and insensibility. Recovery took place in two cases\r\nmentioned by Trail, from the use of emetics and ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOL‘S PARSLEY\r\n\r\n_Æthusa Cynapium_ has been mistaken for parsley. Nausea, vomiting,\r\ngiddiness, and severe abdominal pains are among the most common\r\nsymptoms of poisoning by this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRYONY\r\n\r\nTwo plants are included under this name, _Bryonia dioica_, white\r\nbryony (_N.O. Cucurbitaceæ_), the only indigenous cucurbitaceous\r\nplant, and the _Tamus communis_, black bryony _(N.O. Dioscoreaceæ_).\r\nBoth the bryonia dioica and the tamus communis possess active irritant\r\nproperties. They are of importance from the fact of their growing wild,\r\nand the possibility of the fruit being eaten by children.\r\n\r\n\r\nELATERIUM\r\n\r\nElaterium, the inspissated juice of _Ecballium officinarum_, or\r\nSquirting Cucumber. It is a powerful drastic purgative, one grain\r\nhaving given rise to alarming symptoms in man.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL IRRITANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTHARIDES\r\n\r\nCantharides--_Cantharis vesicatoria_ (_N.O. Coleoptera_)--is seldom\r\ngiven as a poison, but is most frequently employed to procure abortion,\r\nor for its supposed aphrodisiac properties.\r\n\r\nCantharides is a pure irritant. Applied externally, it produces\r\nvesication; and if absorbed, strangury.\r\n\r\nCantharidine--the active principle of Cantharides--is insoluble in\r\nwater and bisulphide of carbon. It is but slightly soluble in alcohol,\r\nbut it is dissolved by chloroform, ether, and some oils. Four parts of\r\ncantharidine have been procured from a thousand parts of the flies.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms_.--An acrid taste is first experienced in the mouth,\r\nfollowed by a burning heat in the throat, stomach, and abdomen. There\r\nis constant vomiting of bloody mucus, and the stools also contain\r\nblood. The patient complains of intense thirst, pains in the loins,\r\nand an incessant desire to void urine, which is frequently mixed with\r\nblood. Salivation in some cases is a prominent symptom. Strangury may\r\nresult from the external application of cantharides as a blister, &c.\r\nPriapism is often obstinate and painful, and the fatal termination is\r\ngenerally ushered in by violent convulsions and delirium. In pregnant\r\nwomen, abortion may take place as a result of the general irritation\r\nand disturbance of the system, there being no proof that the uterus\r\nis particularly affected by the drug. The vomited matters may contain\r\nshining green particles, the presence of which indicates the nature of\r\nthe poison taken. The invasion of the symptoms may in some cases be\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances_.--Those of powerful irritation. The mucous\r\nmembrane of the whole alimentary canal, from the mouth to the rectum,\r\nhas been found in a state of acute inflammation. The uterus, kidneys,\r\nand internal organs of generation share also in the general irritation,\r\nulceration of the bladder having been met with in some cases. Portions\r\nof the wings and elytra are sometimes found adhering to the coats of\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose_.--One ounce of the tincture has caused death in fourteen\r\ndays. This is perhaps the smallest fatal dose on record. Six ounces\r\nhave been stated to have produced no dangerous symptoms. The\r\nworthlessness of the preparation may account for this result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_.--Vomiting should be promoted and warm mucilaginous drinks\r\ngiven. If vomiting be absent, emetics should be administered. Oil\r\nshould not be given, as it dissolves out the active principle. Opium\r\nmay be given with advantage.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis_.--The contents of the stomach should be\r\nconcentrated and then treated with chloroform, filtered, and the\r\nfiltrate allowed to spontaneously evaporate. A portion of the residue\r\nshould then be placed on the skin, and the presence or absence of\r\nvesication noticed. Examined under the microscope, portions of\r\nthe wing-cases may be detected. No change of colour is produced\r\nin cantharidine by the action of sulphuric or nitric acid, thus\r\ndistinguishing this substance from any of the vegetable alkaloids.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTIVE OR BACTERIAL ALKALOIDS\r\n\r\nThe processes by which complex and highly organised substances are\r\nbroken up into their primary elements are largely synthetical. The\r\nputrefactive processes brought about by the action of bacteria result\r\nin the formation of special products, some of which combine with\r\ncertain mineral and vegetable acids to form definite chemical salts;\r\nin this respect they correspond with inorganic and organic bases.\r\nThese products are called ptomaines, a name suggested by an Italian\r\ntoxicologist, Selmi, and it is derived from the Greek word πτῶμα, a\r\ncadaver or corpse.\r\n\r\nOn account of their basic properties, resembling the vegetable\r\nalkaloids, they are called putrefactive or bacterial alkaloids. They\r\nhave been called animal alkaloids, but some ptomaines may be produced\r\nby the action of bacteria upon vegetable proteids; so this term is not\r\nstrictly applicable, and should be restricted to those basic bodies\r\nor “_leucomaines_” that result from metabolism of the tissues in the\r\nanimal body.\r\n\r\nThe essential element of their basic nature is nitrogen, and in this\r\nthey resemble the vegetable alkaloids. Some contain oxygen, like the\r\nfixed alkaloids, while others do not, like the volatile alkaloids\r\nnicotine and conine. The kind of ptomaine formed depends upon the\r\nnature of the bacterium, the material upon which, and the conditions\r\nunder which, it grows; the amount of oxygen present; the temperature\r\nand the period of growth. All ptomaines are not necessarily poisonous.\r\nAlbumin is the origin from which all alkaloids, vegetable or animal,\r\nare derived. The following is a list of the principal ptomaines:\r\n\r\n    _Methylamine_, CH₃NH₂.--Found in herring brine\r\n        and decomposing fish--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Dimethylamine_, (CH₃)₂NH₂.--From putrefying\r\n        gelatine, yeast, fish, and sausage--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Trimethylamine_, (CH₃)₃N.--Various decomposing animal\r\n        and vegetable tissues, ergot--poisonous in large\r\n        quantities.\r\n    _Ethylamine_, C₂H₅NH₂.--Beet-sugar,\r\n        wheat-flour--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Diethylamine_, (C₂H₅)₂NH₂.--Putrid fish and\r\n        sausage--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Triethylamine_, (C₂H₅)₃N.--Putrid fish and\r\n        sausage--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Propylamine_, C₃H₇NH₂.--From cultures of bacteria of\r\n        fæces--non-poisonous.\r\n    _Butylamine_, C₄H₁₁N.--From cod-liver oil. Diaphoretic\r\n        and diuretic--in large doses causes vomiting and stupor.\r\n    _Iso-amylamine_, (CH₃)₂·CH·CH₂CH₂NH₂.--Decomposing\r\n        yeast and cod-liver oil--active poison, causes\r\n        convulsions and death.\r\n    _Caproylamine_, C₆H₁₅N.--Called septicin by Hager.\r\n    _Collodine_, C₈H₁₁N.--The first ptomaine obtained in\r\n        a chemically pure condition--from putrid horse flesh,\r\n        pancreas, gelatine, and mackerel.\r\n    _Hydrocollodine_, C₈H₁₃N.--Putrefying horse flesh and\r\n        mackerel--highly poisonous.\r\n    _Parvoline_, C₉H₁₃N.--Putrid horse flesh and mackerel.\r\n    _Unnamed base_, C₁₀H₁₅N.--From decomposing fibrin and\r\n        jelly-fish. Like curare in its action.\r\n    _Putrescine_, C₄H₁₂N₁₂.--From human corpses--feebly poisonous.\r\n    _Cadaverine_, C₅H₁₆N₂.--From human corpses--causes suppuration.\r\n    _Neuridine_, C₅H₁₄N₂.--Common product of putrefaction--quite inert.\r\n    _Neurine_, C₅H₁₃NO.--From human corpses, intensely\r\n        poisonous--resembles muscarin in its action.\r\n    _Choline_, C₅H₁₅NO₂.--From putrefying animal and\r\n        vegetable substances--feebly poisonous; by giving up one\r\n        molecule of water it changes to neurine--this may be\r\n        brought about by bacteria or chemical agencies.\r\n    _Muscarine_, C₅H₁₃NO₂.--From putrid fish and horse\r\n        flesh. The active principle of poisonous mushroom.\r\n    _Gadinine_, C₇H₁₆NO₂.--From putrefying codfish,\r\n        haddock, and gelatine, in pure cultures of proteus\r\n        vulgaris--poisonous in large quantities.\r\n    _A Base_ (_?_), C₇H₁₇NO₂.--From decomposing\r\n        horse flesh--its action is like curare: causes loss of\r\n        temperature, rigors, convulsions, and general paralysis:\r\n        the heart stops in diastole.\r\n    _Mydaleine._--Composition not determined--from human\r\n        corpses--actively poisonous.\r\n\r\nEven after prolonged periods and with access of air, any putrefactive\r\nalkaloids which may form do so in very small quantities, and they are\r\nvery unstable. In their chemical reactions they respond to many of the\r\ngroup-tests used for alkaloids, but they differ in their reaction to\r\nthe special tests used for vegetable alkaloids. There is no test that\r\nwill differentiate between putrefactive and vegetable alkaloids, as a\r\nclass; at the same time no putrefactive alkaloid will give the same\r\nchemical reactions, and have the same physiological properties, as any\r\none of the vegetable alkaloids.\r\n\r\n_Neurine_ was first obtained by Liebreich by boiling protagon with\r\nconcentrated baryta. Since then it has been extracted from putrefying\r\nanimal tissues. The free base is strongly alkaline, and gives a white\r\ncloud with the vapour of hydrochloric acid. It is intensely poisonous,\r\nresembling muscarine in its action. Very small quantities cause\r\ncomplete paralysis in frogs. Respiration ceases first, and the heart\r\nbeats become more and more feeble, until it stops in diastole. If\r\natropine be now injected the heart begins to beat again.\r\n\r\nAs a defence set up in cases of poisoning, when one or other of the\r\nrarer alkaloids has been used, it has been suggested that the poison\r\ndiscovered in the body of the deceased was due to the processes of\r\nputrefaction of the tissues themselves. In view of this it is important\r\nto know the toxic power of such putrefactive alkaloids as may be found\r\nin the human cadaver.\r\n\r\nTwo only of these are actively poisonous--_neurine_ and _mydaleine_;\r\nothers are toxic in so small a degree that large amounts would be\r\nrequired to produce lethal effects, far more in proportion to the body\r\nweight than any vegetable alkaloid for which it may be alleged they\r\nhave been mistaken.\r\n\r\n_Neurine_ does not appear before the fifth or sixth day after death,\r\n_mydaleine_ not until the seventh day, and only in traces; it does not\r\nappear in amount sufficient for quantitative analysis until the end of\r\nthe second or third week.\r\n\r\nAt the period after death when a medico-legal analysis has generally to\r\nbe made, _choline_ is the only alkaloid present, and it is but feebly\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nIn rabbits _neurine_ causes marked salivation and increased flow\r\nof secretion from the eyes and nose. The heart beats more quickly\r\nat first, but gradually slows down and stops in diastole. There is\r\nincreased peristalsis of the intestines with profuse diarrhœa. There\r\nis narrowing of the pupil both after injection or local installation.\r\nClonic spasms and violent convulsions occur, and are followed by\r\nparalysis first of the hind then of the fore legs, ending in death. The\r\nsymptoms are prevented or relieved by atropine.\r\n\r\nIf atropine be injected first the poisonous effects of the _neurine_ do\r\nnot show themselves.\r\n\r\n_Mydaleine_ was discovered by Brieger in putrefying cadaveric organs.\r\nSmall doses injected into guinea-pigs cause profuse lachrymation and\r\ncoryza.\r\n\r\nThe pupils dilate and then become motionless. The temperature rises\r\nfrom 1° to 2° Centigrade. There is somnolence at this stage, with\r\nincreased intestinal peristalsis. The pulse and respirations are\r\nquickened; later these with the temperature return to the normal, and\r\nthe animal recovers. Large doses cause death with the heart in diastole\r\nand the intestines contracted.\r\n\r\nClonic spasms and stupor precede death.\r\n\r\n_The Extraction of putrefactive alkaloids_ from organic matters may be\r\ncarried out by the process for alkaloid extraction (_vide_ p. 335 _et\r\nseq._).\r\n\r\nAmongst the attempts made to distinguish the putrefactive from\r\nvegetable alkaloids by chemical reactions one method was based on the\r\nrapid reduction of potassium ferricyanide to the ferrocyanide. After\r\nconverting the alkaloid to a sulphate, a solution of it is mixed with\r\na drop of potassium ferricyanide and a drop of ferric chloride added:\r\nthe deep blue colour of Prussian blue is produced if reduction to the\r\nferrocyanide has taken place. However, certain vegetable alkaloids,\r\nviz. morphine, aconitine, eserine, and hyoscyamine act rapidly as\r\nreducing agents upon the ferricyanide. Emetine, igasurine, nicotine,\r\ncolchicine act less rapidly. Brieger considers that when the reaction\r\noccurs with putrefactive alkaloids it is due to impurities present in\r\nthem. Brouardel and Boutmy have suggested making use of the action\r\nof alkaloids upon photographic silver bromide paper as a means of\r\ndistinction. The paper is written upon with a solution of the alkaloid\r\nand kept light free for half an hour; it is then fixed in a solution\r\nof sodium hyposulphite and washed in water. The putrefactive alkaloids\r\nare said to reduce and blacken the silver compound, while the vegetable\r\nalkaloids do not. Neither of these processes is to be relied upon for\r\nmedico-legal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCOMAINES OR ANIMAL ALKALOIDS\r\n\r\n_Leucomaines_ or _animal alkaloids_ are basic substances which\r\noriginate from the metabolic processes taking place in the animal body.\r\nThey closely resemble the vegetable alkaloids, and some are found in\r\nplants as well as animals. It is probable that some of them may have\r\noriginated primarily from the putrefactive processes in the intestines\r\nand been absorbed into the system. The following is a list of the\r\nprincipal leucomaines resulting from the metabolism of the tissues of\r\nthe animal body:\r\n\r\n    _Adenin_, C₅H₅N₅.--From thymus gland, from all tissues\r\n        animal or vegetable which are rich in nucleinic\r\n        acid--poisonous in large doses.\r\n    _Sarkine_ or _hypoxanthine_, C₅H₄N₄O.--From urine and\r\n        flesh--causes increased reflex excitability and\r\n        convulsive seizures.\r\n    _Guanine_, C₅H₅N₅O.--From flesh and guano--it is inert.\r\n\r\n    _Xanthine_, C₅H₅N₄O₂.--From flesh and urine--acts as a\r\n        muscle stimulant.\r\n    _Heteroxanthine_, C₆H₆N₄O₃.--From urine.\r\n    _Methylxanthine_, C₆H₆N₄O₂.--From urine.\r\n    _Paraxanthine_, C₇H₈N₄O₂.--From urine--destroys\r\n        spontaneous muscular action, lessens reflex excitability.\r\n    _Carnine_, C₇H₈N₄O₃.--From fresh meat.\r\n    _Gerotine_, C₅H₁₄N₂.--From liver and kidneys, an isomer\r\n        of cadaverine--exerts a paralysing action upon the nerve\r\n        centres and cardiac ganglia.\r\n    _Spermin_, C₂H₅N.--From semen, testicles, ovaries,\r\n        breast, thyroid, pancreas, and spleen, normal bone\r\n        marrow. Poehl states that it has a tonic effect on the\r\n        nervous system.\r\n    _Creatinine_, C₄H₇N₃O.--From urine.\r\n    _Crusocreatinine_, C₅H₈N₄O.--From fresh meat.\r\n    _Xanthocreatinine_, C₅H₁₀N₄O.--From fresh meat--causes\r\n        depression, fatigue, somnolence, defæcation, and\r\n        vomiting.\r\n    _Betaine_, C₅H₁₁NO₂.--From urine.\r\n    _Mytilotoxine_, C₆H₁₅NO₂.--From poisonous mussels.\r\n\r\n=The Relation of Leucomaines to Disease=\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary in considering the relation of leucomaines to\r\ndisease to give the term a wider significance than that relative to\r\nthe chemistry of these bodies. Autogenous diseases may be looked upon\r\nas having their origin in altered metabolism of the tissue cells,\r\napart from the introduction of foreign cells or poisons. “It is\r\ncertainly true that if we should drink only chemically pure water, take\r\nonly that food which is free from all adulteration and infection,\r\nand breathe the purest air free from all organic matter living and\r\ndead, yet our excretions would contain poisons. It is true that the\r\nexcretions of all living things, plants, and animals contain substances\r\nwhich are poisonous to the organisms excreting them” (Vaughan).\r\nBouchard estimates that the amount of a certain poison formed in\r\nthe intestines of a healthy man in twenty-four hours, if absorbed,\r\nwould prove fatal. Unless free elimination takes place, elevation of\r\ntemperature may follow.\r\n\r\nThe products of imperfect digestion, if absorbed, may give rise to\r\nserious disturbances. Hildebrandt has shown by his experiments that\r\nsubcutaneous injection of pepsin into dogs is followed by elevation\r\nof body temperature, which he calls “ferment fever.” The fever\r\nreaches a maximum within a few hours and may last several days.\r\nRigors are frequent. The animals suffer from trembling in the limbs,\r\nuncertainty of gait, vomiting, dyspnœa, and coma followed by death. On\r\n_post-mortem_ examination there are found degeneration of the heart,\r\nmuscles, liver, and kidneys, abundant hæmorrhages into the intestine,\r\nPeyer‘s patches, the mesenteric glands, and occasionally into the\r\nlungs. The blood is at first lessened in coagulability, afterwards\r\nincreased, and thrombi formed which have been found in the lungs and\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\nExcessive formation of these poisonous substances within the body\r\nor insufficient elimination of them produces serious disturbances.\r\nFatigue fever is an example. A considerable rise of temperature may\r\nfollow excessive and prolonged exercise, the appetite is impaired,\r\nand insomnia is present from excitation of the brain and the senses\r\nbeing rendered more acute. There may be rigors simulating malaria.\r\nThis fatigue fever occurs particularly amongst recruits in armies\r\nsubjected to prolonged marching. From his observations of this disease\r\nin the Italian army, Mosso states that it is due to the absorption\r\nof poisonous substances into the blood from the tissues, which, if\r\ninjected into the circulation of healthy animals, produces symptoms\r\nof exhaustion. The fever of prostration or exhaustion is similar but\r\nless in degree, it is more likely to be produced by prolonged exertion\r\nwith insufficient food, it may resemble typhus fever, delirium may\r\nbe present, and loss of muscular control over the bowels; death may\r\nresult. In non-fatal cases weeks may elapse before recovery takes place.\r\n\r\nRachford has pointed out that an excess of paraxanthine in the blood\r\nis followed by migraine, and it may give rise to epileptic seizures,\r\ngastric neurosis, and asthma; and by injecting paraxanthine into the\r\nblood of mice and rats he has produced symptoms of certain forms of\r\nepilepsy, and others similar to the nervous symptoms of chronic lead\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFOOD POISONING (BROMATOTOXISMUS)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstances have occurred from time to time of serious illness attacking\r\nindividuals either separately or collectively shortly after the\r\ningestion of food. The food may be rendered poisonous in the following\r\nways:\r\n\r\n1. A poisonous substance may have been added to it, intentionally or\r\naccidentally.\r\n\r\n2. Grain may become infected with poisonous fungi, _e.g._ ergot.\r\n\r\n3. Plants or animals may feed upon materials harmless to them, but\r\nwhich render them poisonous to man--birds that have fed on mountain\r\nlaurel are said to have proved poisonous to man.\r\n\r\n4. During periods of physiological activity of certain of their glands,\r\nthe flesh of some animals becomes poisonous to man; some fish, for\r\nexample, are poisonous during the spawning season.\r\n\r\n5. Food may carry infection by contamination with germs, _e.g._ typhoid\r\nbacilli in milk.\r\n\r\n6. The animal may suffer from a specific disease, and it may be\r\ntransmitted to man, _e.g._ tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n7. Foods may be contaminated with bacteria which produce poisons either\r\nbefore or after the food has been eaten.\r\n\r\n8. The food may be infected with parasites or their ova, and which\r\ndevelop in the individual who partakes of it, _e.g._ trichiniasis.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which the poison has been added or preformed, the symptoms\r\nof poisoning come on almost immediately or within a short space of\r\ntime; there may, however, in the latter, be a delay in the appearance\r\nof the symptoms in instances where the bacterial poison is formed\r\nsubsequent to the ingestion of the food. This delay is bordering on the\r\nnature of a true infection. In those cases when the bacteria have been\r\npresent in the animal before, or develop in it subsequent to its death,\r\nand which develop in the person who eats it as food, symptoms may not\r\ncome on for some time; the condition is a true infection, and there may\r\nbe an incubation period over six or seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeat Poisoning (Kreotoxismus)\r\n\r\nApart from those cases of poisoning following the ingestion of food\r\nto which poison has been added, or from meat affected by parasitic\r\ndisease, there have occurred outbreaks of serious illness following\r\nthe partaking of meat. Vaughan, in the _Twentieth Century Practice of\r\nMedicine_, vol. xiii. p. 20, holds that “there can scarcely be any\r\ndifference of opinion on the following points: (1) With fresh food to\r\nact upon and with normal gastric juice to act, the process of peptic\r\ndigestion proceeds without the formation of any harmful substance. (2)\r\nWith putrid food, containing poisons to start with, the most active\r\ndigestion does not guarantee the destruction of those poisons. (3)\r\nWith even the best of food, peptic digestion may proceed so slowly and\r\nimperfectly that during the process poisons may be formed by bacterial\r\nagencies.” During the process of decomposition of meat and other\r\nalbuminous foods by bacterial agency, certain poisonous substances are\r\nformed prior to the production of the ptomaines or bacterial alkaloids.\r\nThese are known as toxalbumoses and enzymes; they are unstable bodies,\r\nthey cannot be obtained in a crystalline form, and their composition\r\nis not fully understood. They give certain reactions with a few group\r\nreagents, but they are recognised only by their effects upon living\r\nanimals. As decomposition advances the more stable alkaloids are\r\nformed, but those which are poisonous, like the toxalbumoses, are\r\nreadily converted by further processes of putrefaction or by chemical\r\nmeans into innocuous bodies. Toxins is the general term used in\r\ntoxicology for these poisonous substances formed from animal tissues.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that complete putrefaction should have taken place\r\nfor meat to prove poisonous. In fact many of the severest cases are\r\nthose in which it has not fully putrefied. The most poisonous toxins\r\nare present during the early stages of decomposition, and the changes\r\nare not recognisable by the senses--smell or taste--which would ensure\r\nthe rejection of the meat as food.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous effects are rarely due to the ingestion of bacterial\r\nproducts alone; those cases in which no bacteriological investigation\r\nof the food has been made cannot be taken into consideration. The\r\ntoxalbumoses are destroyed by a few minutes‘ exposure to a temperature\r\nat boiling-point, 212° F. (Durham, _B. M. J._, 1898, vol. ii. p. 797).\r\n\r\nIn reference to the toxic action of the alkaloids, these have been\r\nnoted only from the results following subcutaneous injection; their\r\neffects when taken per orem have not been established by experiment.\r\nIn all instances where the necessary bacteriological investigation has\r\nbeen properly carried out a true infection has been proved to have\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nIn cases of meat poisoning the principal bacteria concerned are not the\r\nordinary putrefactive organisms. The Bacillus enteritidis of Gärtner,\r\nwhich has been found associated with twelve epidemics, and the Bacillus\r\nbotulinus of Ermengem are the most important causative agents.\r\n\r\nThe Bacillus enteritidis is killed by proper cooking. It is destroyed\r\nin one minute at a temperature of 180° F. At 41° F. it will not grow,\r\nbut, in meat kept at 68° F. for seventy-two hours, it flourishes\r\nabundantly. Freezing will not kill it. In meat which has been infected\r\nwith the bacilli _post-mortem_ they do not penetrate the meat more\r\nthan 1 cm. in ten days. Roasting or boiling will sterilise it. In those\r\ninstances in which poisoning has taken place after cooking, the bacilli\r\nhave either been present in the meat beforehand, and the temperature\r\nhas not been sufficiently high or the cooking sufficiently prolonged,\r\nto ensure their destruction in the deepest portions; or the meat after\r\ncooking has become contaminated, and been insufficiently warmed up\r\nagain after keeping it for a day or so. Exposure to sewer gas will not\r\naffect meat and contaminate it with the Bacillus enteritidis. The chief\r\nsymptoms due to the Bacillus enteritidis are vomiting and diarrhœa,\r\nherpes labialis, rashes on the skin followed by desquamation in about\r\nfourteen days, jaundice, and great thirst. The onset is sudden, with\r\nnausea, headache, pains in the back and limbs, rigors, fever lasting a\r\nfew days, general weakness, and, in cases which recover, convalescence\r\nextending over a period of from three to six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of botulismus, due to the Bacillus botulinus of Ermengem,\r\nand associated with sausage poisoning, are, as a rule, dryness of\r\nthe mouth, constriction of the fauces, nausea, vomiting, purgation,\r\nvertigo, dilatation of the pupils, with dimness of vision and diplopia,\r\nand a sense of suffocation. Marked muscular weakness and nervous\r\nprostration are prominent symptoms. In fatal cases there is weakness of\r\nthe pulse and cyanosis, with coldness of the surface and perspiration.\r\nThe temperature is raised at first and may reach 103° F., but\r\nultimately falls below normal. Delirium comes on late, followed by coma\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nIn dangerous cases obstinate constipation may follow after a few hours\r\nof watery stools.\r\n\r\nOn _post-mortem_ examination of the bodies in fatal cases the following\r\nappearances have been noted: a white, dried, parchment condition of the\r\nmouth, fauces, throat, and gullet; hyperæmia of the mucous membrane of\r\nthe stomach and intestines with submucous extravasations of blood. The\r\nabdominal and thoracic viscera have been found engorged with blood,\r\nwith enlargement of the spleen; the former are due to failure of the\r\nheart, and cannot be regarded as characteristic of sausage poisoning.\r\nSome stress has been laid on the observation that putrefaction is\r\nunusually delayed, but Müller has shown that no reliance can be placed\r\nupon it; he says that in forty-eight autopsies it has been noted that\r\nin eleven of them putrefaction had developed rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of meat poisoning are grouped by Dixon Mann into two\r\ndivisions: (1) those due to a true infection, (2) those due to simple\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nIn (1) the symptoms are those of an infectious disease--they include\r\nheadache, anorexia, rigors, constipation followed by diarrhœa, pains in\r\nthe back and limbs, photophobia, delirium, skin eruptions, meteorism,\r\nand enlargement of the spleen. The _post-mortem appearances_ greatly\r\nresemble those of enterica--infiltration, ulceration, and sloughing of\r\nPeyer‘s patches; hæmorrhage into the bowels, enlargement of the spleen,\r\nwith possibly some pus depots.\r\n\r\nIn (2) the symptoms are those of acute gastro-enteritis--violent\r\nvomiting, purging, prostration, cramps in the legs, and collapse;\r\nthe temperature is generally subnormal, but may be elevated. The\r\n_post-mortem appearances_ are those produced by gastro-enteritis,\r\nwith hæmorrhages into the intestinal mucous membrane; the spleen is\r\nfrequently enlarged, and Peyer‘s patches may be infiltrated.\r\n\r\nMeat poisoning has usually been most frequently associated with the\r\ningestion of pork, veal, beef, meat pies, potted meat, tinned meat,\r\nsausages, and brawn. The more finely divided the meat, the more\r\neasily and completely it may become infected and poisonous. Cases of\r\npoisoning from the ingestion of canned meats are not uncommon. In some\r\ninstances they may be due to metallic poisoning, in the great majority\r\nthey are due to putrefactive changes having taken place in the meat.\r\nUngefug reports a case confirmed by the celebrated chemist Heinrich\r\nRose, in which sulphate of zinc had been used as a preservative\r\ninstead of saltpetre. In some the canning may have been imperfect,\r\nand putrefaction taken place before reaching the consumer; in others\r\ndecomposition may have begun after opening the can. The meat may have\r\nbeen taken from diseased animals, or decomposed prior to canning.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by tinned provisions with the metal used for tinning is more\r\nlikely to occur with fruits than meat. The malic acid of the juice\r\nprobably dissolves the solder and forms a malate of tin. Cherries,\r\napples, pineapples, and tomatoes are the most likely to do this.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Luff investigated four cases of tin poisoning due to the\r\nconsumption of tinned cherries. Some of the material left was analysed,\r\nand the juice contained malate of tin in solution equivalent to two\r\ngrains of the higher oxide of tin per fluid ounce. It was estimated\r\nthat the symptoms were produced by doses of two to four grains of\r\nmalate of tin. Two of the patients nearly died from the diarrhœa and\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nSulphate of copper is used to give a full green colour to peas, olives,\r\nand pickles, or it may contaminate preserved fruits if they be left in\r\ncopper vessels. The copper combines with the phyllocyanic acid of the\r\nchlorophyll, and although insoluble in the surrounding liquor, is set\r\nfree and absorbed by the process of digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFish Poisoning (Ichthyotoxismus)\r\n\r\nFish may cause poisoning in two ways: in one the poison is a\r\nphysiological product of certain glands of the animal, and is quite\r\nindependent of bacteria; the other is due to the poisonous products\r\nof bacterial growth. The fish that are inherently poisonous as a rule\r\noccupy tropical waters: several of them exist in Japanese waters.\r\nMackerel, carp, barbel, and herrings may become poisonous at times;\r\nsome of these, especially mackerel, may rapidly become unfit for food\r\nafter they are dead. Caviare and the roe of herrings have caused\r\npoisoning. Shell-fish, especially mussels, also may prove poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of fish and shell-fish poisoning are variable. In some\r\ncases disturbance of the nervous system predominates, with delirium,\r\nconvulsions, and paralysis. There may be dryness and constriction\r\nof the throat, dyspnœa, disturbed vision, vertigo, jerky speech or\r\naphonia, rapid pulse, loss of co-ordination, numbness, formication,\r\ncoldness of the limbs, dilated pupils, paralysis, and collapse,\r\nfollowed by death in a few hours. Other cases exhibit symptoms of\r\nsevere gastro-intestinal irritation, with nausea, vomiting, pain,\r\ntenesmus, mucous and bloody stools; in the most dangerous cases the\r\nbowels are constipated. Cases exhibiting the nervous type of symptoms\r\nresemble poisoning by atropine, and an alkaloid--ptomatropine--is\r\nregarded as the cause. It has never been obtained in the pure state,\r\nand nothing is known of its composition. It must not be mistaken, in\r\ntoxicological examination, for atropine; its presence can only be\r\nrecognised by its action on the pupil.\r\n\r\nMany cases of fish poisoning are accompanied by erythema, urticaria,\r\nand severe itching of the skin. In probably all cases there is an\r\nelevation of the body temperature.\r\n\r\nTinned fish has caused poisoning on many occasions. In one case of\r\ntinned salmon poisoning, which proved fatal, parts of the stomach\r\nand intestines were almost gangrenous from the intensity of the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nStevenson (_Brit. Med. Journ._, 1892) records a case of sardine\r\npoisoning which proved fatal, and in which the tissues _post-mortem_\r\nwere found to be emphysematous. He extracted an alkaloid from some of\r\nthe sardines, and the stomach contents; it was highly toxic and proved\r\nfatal to rats.\r\n\r\nIt is most probable in poisoning by tinned fish that the contents of\r\nthe tins have become contaminated with bacteria before being sealed up.\r\n\r\n_Shell-fish_ may become contaminated with bacteria and cause true\r\ninfections in people who eat them. Typhoid fever has been carried\r\nin this way by oysters, and probably cockles. The fish may develop\r\ntoxins and prove poisonous, and as an example of this mussels produce\r\na powerful toxin--_mytilotoxine_--while they are alive, which gives\r\nrise to a serious illness termed mytilotoxismus. There are three quite\r\ndifferent classes of symptoms induced by poisonous mussels. In one the\r\nsymptoms are principally those of acute gastro-enteritis; in another\r\nskin eruptions are the principal feature; and the third is known as\r\nmytilotoxismus paralyticus, in which there is great disturbance of the\r\ncerebro-spinal nervous system, with paralysis. The two former groups\r\nof symptoms are due to putrefactive processes in the mussels, but the\r\nthird or paralytic group is due to the alkaloid _mytilotoxine_, which\r\nis not a product of putrefaction, as it is not found in mussels that\r\nhave been allowed to decay.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to evidence the idea that mussels absorb metallic\r\npoisons--_e.g._ copper--from the bottoms of vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoning by Milk and Milk Products\r\n\r\nThe term milk poisoning or galactotoxismus is used here to indicate\r\nthe results following the drinking of milk infected with saprophytic\r\ntoxicogenic bacteria, and which are mainly responsible for the high\r\nmortality from “summer diarrhœas” of artificially-fed infants. One of\r\nthe products of these bacterial infections of milk is the alkaloid\r\n_tyrotoxicon_. It has been isolated by Vaughan from cheese, and has\r\nalso been found in ice-cream, frozen custards, and cream puffs.\r\nVaughan, however, asserts that it is not the one most frequently\r\npresent, nor is it the most actively poisonous. There are others which\r\nhe considers are poisonous albumins (Vaughan, _Twentieth Cent. Pract.\r\nMed._, vol. xiii.).\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning by tyrotoxicon are mainly those of acute\r\ngastro-enteritis, and comprise constriction of the fauces, nausea\r\nand vomiting, sharp griping intestinal pains, headache, thoracic\r\noppression, chilliness, dizziness, and purging. In severe forms\r\nexhaustion, subnormal temperature, coma, collapse, and death may follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHINIASIS\r\n\r\nThis disease is due to the introduction of the _Trichina spiralis_\r\ninto the human body. The encysted worm is found embedded in the\r\nfibres of all the striped muscles of the trunk and limbs, and even\r\nin the heart, where it appears in the form of white ovoid bodies or\r\ncapsules, the capsules being sometimes calcareous. The worm passes the\r\ngreater part of its existence in the chrysalis state in the muscular\r\nsystem of one animal, and only reaches its mature condition in the\r\nstomach of another. Virchow and Zenker assert that the trichina not\r\nonly frequently presents itself in the human organism, but that this\r\norganism is most favourable for its full development. Once in the\r\nstomach, the period of incubation is about three to eight days, and\r\nthen propagation rapidly begins and continues, so that Dr. Kellen\r\nestimates that in about seven days after the ingestion of half a pound\r\nof meat the stomach and intestines may contain thirty millions of the\r\nworms. The worms when introduced into the stomach leave their capsules,\r\nbecome free, produce young, and these leave the stomach through its\r\ncoats for the muscles, where they become encysted. The trichina is most\r\nfrequently found in pork, seldom in sheep, horses, or oxen--the last\r\nbeing the most free.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Intestinal irritation, loss of appetite, sickness,\r\nmalaise, general weakness of the limbs, and diarrhœa. The eyelids swell\r\nas well as the joints, the skin is bathed in cold, clammy sweat, and a\r\nlow form of fever sets in. Death may be due to peritonitis, paralysis\r\nof the muscles--the result of their destruction--or to irritative\r\nfever. During the perforation of the coats of the stomach and bowels by\r\nthe worms, the mucous membrane becomes inflamed, pus is formed on the\r\nsurface, and the stools become bloody.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXICOHÆMIC, SNAKE POISONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nUnder this head may be classed all those effects produced by the sting\r\nor bite of various insects and reptiles, and also by the bite of the\r\nmad dog and wolf.\r\n\r\nNo medico-legal question is likely to be raised on this subject, at\r\nleast in this country, where, with the exception of the common viper or\r\nadder, all our reptiles are harmless enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETABLE ALKALOIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetable alkaloids may be classified in three groups: (1) derivatives\r\nof pyridine, _e.g._ atropine, conine; (2) derivatives of quinoline,\r\n_e.g._ cinchonine, narcotine; (3) substituted amines and amides. The\r\nmajority of the vegetable alkaloids belong to the first two groups.\r\nThey are for the most part solid, crystalline, and colourless; a few,\r\nsuch as conine, nicotine, and pilocarpin, are liquid. They combine with\r\nacids to form salts, and the salts are more soluble in water than the\r\nfree alkaloid. Alkaloids possess certain properties in common, amongst\r\nwhich is that of being precipitated from their solutions by certain\r\nreagents, which are called alkaloidal grouping reagents. Some are\r\nprecipitated by all the group reagents, others only by a few.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlkaloidal Group Reagents\r\n\r\n1. _Iodine dissolved in solution of Potassium Iodide_--_Wagner‘s\r\nreagent_.--Gives a reddish-brown precipitate with most alkaloids.\r\n\r\n2. _Phosphomolybdic Acid_--_Sonnenschein‘s reagent_.--Made by\r\ndissolving phosphomolybdate of soda in water containing one-tenth its\r\nvolume of strong nitric acid. It gives a yellow precipitate with most\r\nof the alkaloids; it also precipitates ammonium salts and ammonia\r\nderivatives, also salts of lead, silver, and mercury unless there be\r\nsufficient acid to keep them in solution.\r\n\r\n3. _Potassio-mercuric Iodide_--_Mayer‘s reagent_.--Made by adding a\r\nsolution of potassium iodide to one of mercuric chloride until the red\r\nprecipitate first formed be just dissolved. This solution precipitates\r\nmost of the alkaloids. The solution to be tested must contain acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n4. _Phosphotungstic Acid_--_Scheibler‘s reagent_.--This acts in a\r\nmanner very similar to phosphomolybdic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods for detecting Vegetable Alkaloids\r\n\r\nThere are several methods recommended for the isolation and detection\r\nof the vegetable alkaloids, and their separation from the contents of\r\nthe stomach or from the membranes and tissues of the body. The process,\r\nhowever, most generally pursued is that of Stas, which may be briefly\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The substance to be examined is mixed with twice its weight of\r\nabsolute alcohol, to which from ten to thirty grains of tartaric or\r\noxalic acid--preferably the former--have been added, and the mixture\r\nsubjected to gentle heat in a flask, 70° to 75° C., or 158° to 167° F.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If the membranes or organs have to be examined, they are finely\r\ndivided, treated with absolute alcohol, squeezed, and again treated\r\nwith fresh alcohol as in (_a_).\r\n\r\nIn either case, the mixture, when quite cold, is filtered, and the\r\nalcoholic solution is concentrated by evaporation, either _in vacuo_ or\r\nin a current of air not exceeding 95° F. or 35° C.\r\n\r\nThe liquid residue is now passed through a moistened filter, which\r\nseparates the fat and other insoluble matters. The filtrate is\r\nevaporated to dryness over sulphuric acid or _in vacuo_, and the acid\r\nresidue of this evaporation dissolved in the smallest possible quantity\r\nof distilled water. The acid liquid is then _gradually_ neutralised\r\nwith the bicarbonate of potash or soda until effervescence ceases, and\r\nafterwards shaken in a flask with four or five times its bulk of pure\r\nether, and allowed to settle. When the ether has become quite clear, a\r\nsmall portion of it is decanted into a small glass capsule, and allowed\r\nto spontaneously evaporate in a dry place. If during evaporation\r\nstreaks of liquid appear on the side of the capsule, running together\r\nat the bottom, a liquid volatile alkaloid is probably present. If none\r\nof these manifestations occur, the alkaloid is in all probability solid\r\nand non-volatile.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n         _The Alkaloid is Volatile_.        | _The Alkaloid is Non-Volatile_.\r\n    ----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n     To the original mixture in a flask     | To the original mixture in a\r\n     add a moderate quantity of a strong    | flask add strong caustic potash or\r\n     solution of caustic potash or soda,    | soda solution, and agitate with\r\n     mixed with ether; agitate, and allow   | successive portions of pure ether\r\n     the mixture to settle.

Instead of numerous treatments and\r\nevaporations which have to be gone through in the original process,\r\nOtto converts the alkaloid into a salt, such as the sulphate, by the\r\naddition of acid, and after solution in a small quantity of water,\r\nagitates with successive quantities of ether, which remove all foreign\r\nfatty matters, leaving the solution of the alkaloid comparatively\r\npure, and from which the alkaloid may be obtained in a state of great\r\npurity, by first rendering the solution alkaline and then using ether\r\nto dissolve the alkaloid.\r\n\r\nR. Wagner‘s Method.--The presence of alkaloids in organic\r\nliquids--strychnia in beer, for example--may, according to R. Wagner\r\n(_Zeitschr. Anal. Chem._, vol. iv. p. 387), be detected by mixing the\r\nliquid, diluted with two vols. water (½ to 1 litre), with about 5 c.c.\r\nof a solution of iodine in potassium iodide (12.7 grains iodine to the\r\nlitre) and a few drops of sulphuric acid. The precipitate separated\r\nfrom the supernatant liquid is dissolved in a dilute solution of sodium\r\nhyposulphite, and again precipitated by means of the iodine solution.\r\nIf this new precipitate be now dissolved in aqueous sulphurous acid,\r\nthe solution will leave, on evaporation, the pure sulphate of the base.\r\n\r\nDragendorff‘s Method.--This is intended for the purpose of separating\r\nalkaloids from each other when more than one are in aqueous solution,\r\nby using different solvents in sequence. Some solvents take up\r\ncertain alkaloids to the exclusion of others. The process consists of\r\nextracting the aqueous acid solution of the alkaloids successively\r\nwith petroleum spirit, benzene, chloroform, and amyl-alcohol, then\r\nalkalising it and repeating with the same solvents.\r\n\r\n1. From the _acid_ solution _benzene_ removes caffeine, colchicine,\r\nsantonin, digitalin, cantharidin. _Chloroform_ removes papaverine,\r\ncolchicine, narceine, picrotoxin.\r\n\r\n2. From the _alkaline_ solution _petroleum ether_ removes strychnine,\r\nbrucine, aconitine, veratrine, conine, nicotine, lobeline, emetine,\r\nand aniline. _Benzene_ removes atropine, hyoscyamine, physostigmine,\r\ncodeine, narcotine, and further quantities of strychnine, brucine,\r\naconitine, veratrine, and emetine. _Chloroform_ removes morphine,\r\nnarceine, papaverine, strychnine, and brucine. _Amyl-alcohol_ removes\r\nmorphine, solanine, and narceine.\r\n\r\nThe Stas process cannot be recommended for the detection of opium in\r\norganic liquids, for two reasons. Firstly, that it altogether fails\r\nto indicate the presence of meconic acid; and, secondly, because\r\nmorphine is almost insoluble in ether. Dragendorff recommends the\r\nuse of _benzole_ for separating the alkaloids, but in this substance\r\nmorphia is nearly insoluble. It is, however, applicable to strychnine,\r\naconitine, conine, and atropine; but for the two last, on account of\r\ntheir volatility, ether is preferable.\r\n\r\nRodger‘s and Girdwood‘s Method.--Extraction with dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid and the use of chloroform instead of ether. Chloroform is a much\r\nbetter solvent of most alkaloids than ether. Particularly useful for\r\nthe isolation of strychnine and for most alkaloids, but there is a\r\nlittle danger of hydrolysis of the alkaloid in the use of a mineral\r\nacid, _e.g._ hyoscine.\r\n\r\nStevenson‘s Modification of the Otto-Stas Process.--The material to be\r\nexamined, if solid, is finely divided, and digested for twenty-four\r\nhours with twice its weight of rectified spirit at 35° C.; if fluid,\r\nwith twice its volume. The clear liquid is decanted and the residue\r\nagain digested with fresh spirit; this is again decanted, and mixed\r\nwith the first alcoholic solution. The residue is now digested with\r\nspirit faintly acidified with acetic acid; this is decanted, and the\r\nresidue digested with two or three lots of unacidified alcohol. The\r\nalcoholic extracts obtained before acidification are mixed together and\r\nrapidly raised to 70° C. for a moment or two. They are quickly cooled\r\nand filtered, and the filter washed with spirit. The acidified extract\r\nand those after it are mixed and treated in the same way. The extracts\r\nare then separately evaporated at a temperature not above 35° C. to the\r\nconsistency of a syrup, the excess of acid being neutralised with soda;\r\nthese are extracted with absolute alcohol, and the extracts evaporated\r\nto a syrup as before. The syrupy extracts are now diluted with a small\r\nquantity of water, filtered, the filters washed with water, and the\r\nfiltrates mixed. The liquid will contain the whole of the alkaloids,\r\nand will be free from albuminoids, which have been coagulated while\r\nthe extracts were at 70° C. The liquid containing the alkaloids is\r\nextracted several times with washed ether, which removes fatty acids or\r\noils, but does not remove alkaloidal salts. The ether should be washed\r\nwith water to which a few drops of sulphuric acid has been added, and\r\nthe water kept: this has to be done because some alkaloidal salts are\r\nslightly soluble in ether. The acid liquid and the acidified aqueous\r\nwashings of the ether are mixed together, rendered alkaline with sodium\r\ncarbonate, and exhausted firstly with a mixture of one volume of\r\nchloroform to three of ether, and lastly three or four times with ether\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe alkalisation with sodium carbonate liberates the alkaloids from\r\ntheir salts, and these are soluble in the chloroform-ether and ether.\r\nThese ethereal extracts are then washed with water acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid, and water alone, and the washings mixed. The water\r\nacidulated with sulphuric acid converts them into sulphates, which are\r\ninsoluble in the ether and chloroform, and are removed by the acidified\r\nwater, while impurities are left behind. The mixed aqueous and acid\r\nextracts are again washed with ether, the ether removed, and the\r\nliquid re-alkalised with sodium carbonate and then re-extracted with\r\nchloroform-ether and ether.\r\n\r\nThe ethereal solutions are removed and are washed with water slightly\r\nalkalised with sodium carbonate. The ethereal solution is filtered\r\nthrough a dry filter, the filtrate evaporated to dryness first at 35°\r\nC. then at 100° C., and cooled over sulphuric acid. The residue is\r\nweighed and represents the weight of the alkaloids. A test quantity\r\nshould be evaporated to see if there be any oily odorous residue,\r\n_i.e._ a volatile alkaloid, nicotine or conine. If so, the chloroform\r\nand ether extracts should be mixed with a little pure ether and strong\r\nhydrochloric acid; the alkaloids are thus changed into non-volatile\r\nhydrochlorides, which are left behind after evaporation of the\r\nchloroform and ether. Any alkaloid found should be converted into the\r\nhydrochloride, dissolved, and tested by special tests. Morphine cannot\r\nbe extracted except in very minute amounts by this method. To obtain\r\nit, the first alkaline solution from which the other alkaloids have\r\nbeen removed should be extracted with acetic ether and ether, in which\r\nmorphine is soluble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of hydrochloride\r\nof morphine, × 50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nTaylor‘s method for the extraction of morphine may be briefly described\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe liquid--porter, &c.--to be examined is acidified with acetic acid;\r\nor, if a solid organ is to be tested, it must be cut into thin slices\r\nand placed in distilled water acidified in a similar way. In either\r\ncase the liquid is digested for one or two hours at a gentle heat,\r\nand filtered. Acetate of lead is now added to the filtrate until no\r\nfurther precipitation occurs; the liquid is then boiled and filtered.\r\nThe meconic acid remains on the filter as meconate of lead, while\r\nthe filtrate contains the morphine as acetate. The liquid is freed\r\nfrom excess of lead by passing through it a current of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, filtered to remove the precipitated sulphide of lead, and\r\nthe resulting liquid evaporated to an extract on a water bath, and\r\ntreated with alcohol. The alcoholic solution on evaporation gives\r\nacetate of morphine, which may then be tested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Photo-micrograph of meconic acid crystallised\r\nfrom aqueous solution, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Photo-micrograph of meconic acid crystallised\r\nfrom an alcoholic solution, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nThe meconate of lead which remains on the filter is decomposed by\r\ntreating it with dilute sulphuric acid, and gently boiling the mixture.\r\nThe filtered liquid should be neutralised before the tests for the\r\npresence of meconic acid are applied.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of both morphine and meconic acid are best seen from the\r\nfollowing Table:--\r\n\r\n                           Morphine--Solid\r\n    --------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n    Treated with strong nitric acid.| Dissolves with effervescence and\r\n                                    |   the production of ruddy fumes,\r\n                                    |   forming a rich orange-coloured\r\n                                    |   solution not changed by the\r\n                                    |   addition of stannous chloride.\r\n                                    |\r\n     Mixed with a little iodic acid | A blue colour, due to the\r\n       and starch paste.            |   liberation of iodine.\r\n                                    |\r\n     Dissolved in cold strong       | Bright-green colour.\r\n       sulphuric acid, and a drop of|\r\n       strong solution of bichromate|\r\n        of potash added.            |\r\n                                    |\r\n     Rubbed with sulphomolybdic acid| A violet colour changing to\r\n       (Frohde‘s reagent).          |   green, and then sapphire-blue.\r\n    --------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n\r\n                 Morphine and Meconic Acid in Solution\r\n    ---------------------+------------------------+----------------------\r\n                         |       Morphine.        |    Meconic Acid.\r\n    ---------------------+------------------------+----------------------\r\n     Tested with litmus  | Slightly alkaline.     | Very distinctly acid.\r\n       paper.            |                        |\r\n                         |                        |\r\n     A little perchloride| An inky-blue colour,   | Deep red colour, not\r\n       of iron, rendered |   destroyed and changed|   easily destroyed by\r\n       of nearly neutral |   to orange-red by     |   a solution of\r\n       as possible.      |   nitric acid.         |   corrosive sublimate\r\n                         |                        |   or dilute mineral\r\n                         |                        |   acids.\r\n    ---------------------+------------------------+----------------------\r\n\r\nThe characteristic tests for morphine are its reactions with nitric\r\nacid, iodic acid and starch, and perchloride of iron. The reaction with\r\nthe perchloride of iron is also characteristic of meconic acid. This\r\nlast-mentioned test is a very conclusive one for meconic acid, when\r\ncertain precautions are taken; for the property of striking a deep red\r\nwith a persalt of iron is shared equally by sulphocyanides and alkaline\r\nacetates. The colour produced by sulphocyanic acid _is instantly\r\nbleached_ on the addition of _corrosive sublimate_. The question thus\r\nlies between acetic and meconic acid. To distinguish the one from\r\nthe other, the solution to be tested should be boiled for a short\r\ntime after the addition of a few drops of sulphuric acid. Any acetate\r\npresent is decomposed and the acetic acid is expelled by the boiling;\r\nso that if, after allowing the solution to cool, it still gives the\r\nred colour with perchloride of iron, the reaction may be taken as\r\nconclusive of meconic acid. By these means morphine and meconic acid\r\nmay be detected in porter and other liquids.\r\n\r\n             Table showing the Characters and Tests of the\r\n                         Following Poisons\r\n    ------------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n                Morphine.         |            Strychnine.\r\n    ------------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n     1.

The plant is a native of Egypt and Syria, cultivated in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOpium is sometimes taken in its crude state as a poison, but more\r\nfrequently one of its preparations is thus employed--notably the\r\ntincture, better known as laudanum.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of this drug reside in an alkaloid,\r\n_morphine_--in combination with an acid, _meconic acid_. The several\r\nvarieties of opium vary considerably in the quantity of morphine which\r\nthey contain, the amount varying from 2 to 9 per cent.\r\n\r\nOpium, or its alkaloid, morphine, forms an important ingredient in\r\n_Dalby‘s Carminative_, _Winslow‘s Soothing Syrup_, _Godfrey‘s Cordial_,\r\n_Chlorodyne_, _Nepenthe_, &c.\r\n\r\nOf all forms of poisoning, that by opium and its preparations is the\r\nmost frequent; and it is stated that three-fourths of all the deaths\r\nfrom opium occur among children _under five years of age_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The rapidity with which the symptoms of poisoning by opium\r\nmake their appearance will depend upon the form in which the poison\r\nis taken--solution, of course, increasing the activity of the drug.\r\nIn most cases, an interval of from half an hour to an hour elapses\r\nafter the poison has been swallowed before any evil effects become\r\napparent. Christison, however, mentions a case in which stupor did not\r\nshow itself for eighteen hours. During the first stage of poisoning\r\nby opium, the patient may become slightly excited; this state is,\r\nhowever, soon followed by giddiness and drowsiness. The eyes are kept\r\nopen with difficulty. Stupor and insensibility now supervene, from\r\nwhich he may, in most cases, be temporarily aroused by a loud noise or\r\na smart blow. As the case progresses, coma and stertorous breathing\r\noccur, and it becomes almost impossible to rouse him at all. The pulse,\r\nat first small, quick, and irregular, becomes slow and full as the\r\ncoma increases. The breathing, hurried in the early stages, is now\r\nslow and stertorous. The pupils are contracted in the early stages,\r\nand may be in the later stages dilated; the former condition is most\r\nfrequently present, together with insensibility to light. The pupils\r\nmay be contracted in cases of _hæmorrhage into the pons Varolii_, and\r\nthis disease has been mistaken for opium poisoning. In uræmic coma,\r\ncoming on in the course of Bright‘s disease, the pupils may also be\r\ncontracted; the nature of the case will be explained by the history\r\nand presence of dropsy. All the secretions, except that of the skin,\r\nare suspended, and the bowels are usually obstinately confined. The\r\nbreath may be impregnated with the odour of opium. Certain anomalies\r\nin the symptoms may occur; thus, there may be vomiting and purging,\r\nconvulsions (the last most frequent in children), delirium, tetanic\r\nspasms, one pupil dilated and the other contracted, paralysis, and\r\nanæsthesia. It must be borne in mind that remissions sometimes occur in\r\nthe symptoms, the patient dying after an attempt at recovery.\r\n\r\nA question of some importance may arise as to the amount of volition\r\nand power of locomotion which may exist for some time after a poisonous\r\ndose has been taken. Death may be due to causes other than the effect\r\nof poison. It must, at least, be admitted as possible, that a person,\r\nafter swallowing a quantity of opium sufficient to cause death, may yet\r\nbe able to walk and move about for one or two hours.\r\n\r\n_Opium-eating._--If opium be taken for some time in small doses, the\r\nsystem becomes tolerant of it, so that a dose which would be poisonous\r\nto most people only produces a slight and pleasurable excitement. De\r\nQuincey was in the habit of taking daily nine ounces of laudanum.\r\nThe habitual opium-eater generally suffers from disorders of the\r\ndigestive organs, dyspepsia and its train of unpleasant symptoms; the\r\nbody becomes thin, the countenance attenuated, the eyes sunken and\r\nglassy, the gait halting, and the body bent. The craving for the drug,\r\nwhich becomes greater and greater, is only temporarily satisfied by\r\nlarger and larger doses. The opium-eater seldom attains a great age,\r\nusually dying before forty. This is perhaps a somewhat exaggerated\r\npicture of the ill effects of opium-eating. Christison, after quoting\r\nthe results of his observations in twenty-five cases of confirmed\r\nopium-eaters, concludes as follows: “These facts tend on the whole\r\nrather to show that the practice of eating opium is not so injurious,\r\nand an opium-eater‘s life is not uninsurable, as is commonly thought,\r\nand that an insured person, who did not make known his habit, could\r\nscarcely be considered guilty of concealment to the effect of voiding\r\nhis insurance. But I am far from thinking (as several represent who\r\nhave quoted this work) that what has now been stated can with justice\r\nbe held to establish such important inferences; for there is an obvious\r\nreason why, in an inquiry of this kind, those instances chiefly should\r\ncome under notice where the constitution has escaped injury--cases\r\nfatal in early life being more apt to be lost sight of, or more likely\r\nto be concealed.”\r\n\r\n_Effects of External Application._--The application of opium to the\r\nsurface of the body is not usually attended with dangerous symptoms;\r\nbut, in a few cases, due probably to some idiosyncrasy, alarming\r\neffects, or even death, have resulted from the external application of\r\nthe drug. Orfila has tried to show that opium is readily absorbed by\r\nthe coats of the rectum, and that it acts more rapidly than when taken\r\ninto the stomach. This statement does not appear to be correct, for the\r\ndose administered by enema is usually twice that given by the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--As might be expected, the appearances found\r\nafter death are not very characteristic. The vessels of the brain\r\nare congested, and serous effusions in the ventricles or between the\r\nmembranes are not uncommon. Engorgement of the lungs is most frequently\r\npresent in those cases in which convulsions have occurred. The stomach\r\nis in most cases found quite healthy. The bladder may be full of urine,\r\ndue probably to the person being unable to empty it from loss of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From three-quarters of an hour and upwards.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Four grains is about the smallest fatal dose of opium\r\nin an adult; but cases of recovery, where an ounce or more of laudanum\r\nhas been taken, are not very rare. Children are very susceptible to\r\nopium. The smallest dose of morphine that has proved fatal to an infant\r\nis one-twelfth of a grain of the hydrochloride. Half a grain of the\r\nacetate has proved fatal to an adult, one grain of morphine or its\r\nsalts has proved fatal on several occasions. With prompt treatment\r\nrecovery has taken place after much larger doses, even as much as\r\nseventy-five grains.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis and Tests._--These have been described on p. 339 _et\r\nseq._\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach pump should be used without delay, and the\r\nstomach thoroughly washed out. The washing water should contain about\r\nten to fifteen grains of permanganate of potash to the pint, and the\r\nwashing repeated at short intervals, as the permanganate destroys the\r\nmorphine. If the stomach tube be not at hand, the patient should be\r\nmade to drink the permanganate solution if possible. This treatment\r\nshould be carried out even when morphine has been administered\r\nhypodermically, as it is excreted by the stomach. Emetics should also\r\nbe given if the patient can swallow; if unable to do so, a hypodermic\r\nof ⅒ grain of apomorphine may be given. The administration of strong\r\ncoffee or tea, the application of ammonia to the nostrils, flagellation\r\nof the soles of the feet, and keeping the patient constantly walking\r\nabout (a procedure of doubtful value) are among the measures usually\r\nadopted by way of treatment. Galvanism and artificial inflation of\r\nthe lungs have done good service even in the most hopeless cases. The\r\nstudent is referred to some important cases recorded by Dr. Burgess\r\nand others in the _Medical Press and Circular_, vol. i. p. 369, for\r\nthe year 1892. Dr. Burgess strongly recommends prolonged artificial\r\nrespiration, the interrupted current, and the administration of\r\nstimulants, externally, internally, and hypodermically. Dr. Finny is of\r\nopinion that, while opium may be useful in cases of atropine poisoning,\r\natropine is of little use in opium poisoning; in this opinion Dr.\r\nBurgess concurred. The state of the respiration is a better test than\r\nthe condition of the pupil when atropine is used as an antidote. If\r\nthe administration of atropine does not quicken the respiration it\r\nshould be discontinued, and other methods tried. Vinegar should not\r\nbe given, as it dissolves the morphine and renders it more easy of\r\nabsorption. Death is rare in those cases in which proper remedies have\r\nbeen resorted to before the stage of stupor has commenced.\r\n\r\n=Synopsis of the Effects of Opium upon the System=\r\n\r\n1. _The Mental Faculties._--The first effect noticed when opium is\r\ntaken in small doses is a primary exaltation of the mental faculties;\r\nthe imagination is rendered brilliant, and the passions exalted; after\r\na time drowsiness supervenes, followed by deep sleep. A dose of thirty\r\ndrops of the tincture caused in one experimenter an exhilaration of the\r\nmental faculties, and an aptitude for study; the subsequent drowsiness\r\nbeing removed by a dose of a hundred drops or more, when the greatest\r\nmental excitement was the result.\r\n\r\n2. _The Respiration._--The frequency of the respiration is diminished,\r\nand the oxidation of the blood impaired.\r\n\r\n3. _The Pulse._--The first effect on the circulatory system is that of\r\na stimulant, and then sedative. By the administration of repeated small\r\ndoses, the force of the circulation may be maintained for some time.\r\n\r\n4. _The Eyes and Countenance._--The pupils, when the patient is\r\npowerfully under the influence of opium, are contracted even to a\r\npoint. Dilatation, has, however, been noticed in some cases, especially\r\nwhen death approaches. In apoplexy of the pons Varolii, the pupils are\r\ncontracted. The countenance is placid, pale, and ghastly; the eyes\r\nheavy, and the lips livid.\r\n\r\n5. _The Cutaneous System._--The skin, although cold, is not\r\ninfrequently bathed in profuse perspiration.\r\n\r\n6. _The Alimentary Canal._--Sometimes there is vomiting and even\r\npurging; but, as a rule, the secretions along the whole alimentary\r\ncanal are diminished, and constipation is the result. According to Dr.\r\nWalter Smith, of Dublin, morphine is mainly excreted into the stomach\r\nand bowels, and so cast out in the fæces. Very little goes out in the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n7. _The Average Commencement of Symptoms._--Much depends upon the\r\nsize and form of the dose. In most cases the first appearance of the\r\nsymptoms is seldom delayed beyond an hour after the poison is taken.\r\n\r\n8. _The Average Period of Death._--Seven to twelve hours.\r\n\r\n           Table showing some of the Symptoms and Effects of\r\n                      Opium and Belladonna\r\n    ---------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n                  Opium.             |            Belladonna.\r\n    ---------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n     1.

In some cases there is\r\nconsiderable irritation of the digestive organs, accompanied with a\r\ndifficulty in passing water, sometimes ending in complete suppression\r\nof urine. The mydriatic alkaloids atropine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine,\r\ndaturine, duboisine, scopolamine, are practically identical in chemical\r\ncomposition and action, and produce similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the most important poisons of this group:--\r\n\r\n    1. Belladonna.\r\n    2. Hyoscyamus.\r\n    3. Stramonium.\r\n    4. Solanum Dulcamara.\r\n    5. Solanum Nigrum.\r\n    6. Solanum Tuberosum.\r\n\r\nThose of less importance are _Œnanthe crocata_ or Dropwort, Camphor,\r\nSalicylic Acid, and Yew--the last already described among the Vegetable\r\nIrritants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLADONNA\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Taken internally or applied externally, belladonna,\r\n_Atropa Belladonna_ (_N. O. Solanacea_), or its alkaloid atropine,\r\ncauses dryness of the mouth and throat, with intense thirst. Nausea and\r\nvomiting are present in most cases, accompanied with giddiness, double\r\nor indistinct vision, active delirium, convulsions, ending in stupor\r\nand coma. In the majority of cases an erythematous rash appears on the\r\nskin, with elevation of temperature resembling scarlet fever. A very\r\nmarked characteristic of poisoning by solanaceous plants is _dilatation\r\nof the pupil_, the iris in some cases being reduced to a mere line\r\nround the pupil. The symptoms in some cases which have been recorded\r\nare almost identical with those of delirium tremens. In other instances\r\nthere has been little or no delirium, the patient at once passing\r\ninto fatal lethargy. Alarming symptoms have followed from drinking a\r\ndecoction of belladonna leaves, which were mistaken and supplied for\r\nthose of the ash. Accidental poisoning has also frequently occurred\r\namong children from their eating the ripe berries of the belladonna\r\nplant. Slight symptoms of poisoning are sometimes met with from the\r\nuse of belladonna plasters to remove the milk from the breasts of\r\nwomen delivered of still-born children, or in cases where the child has\r\ndied soon after birth. In these cases the patients complain of intense\r\ndryness of the mouth, dimness of vision, and itching of the skin. The\r\nremoval of the plasters will at once arrest the unpleasant symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn the _Gazette des Hôpitaux_, July 1859, a case is recorded of\r\npoisoning by the outward application of belladonna in the form of the\r\nfollowing liniment: Camphorated oil of henbane, ten ounces; extract of\r\nbelladonna, four scruples. The patient was seriously ill for some days,\r\nbut ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\nPoisoning has also resulted from the use of a solution of atropine\r\n(four grains to one ounce) dropped into the eye in the treatment of\r\niritis. (See _British Medical Journal_, 1876, vol. i.)\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the vessels of the brain,\r\nsometimes with fluid blood, at other times with thick black blood.\r\nThe stomach may or may not be congested; but in cases where the ripe\r\nberries have been taken, the mucous lining may be seen deeply dyed by\r\nthe juice of the berries. The pupils are usually found dilated.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One teaspoonful of belladonna liniment and one drachm\r\nof tincture have proved fatal. Recovery has taken place after half an\r\nounce of liniment and extract. Children are less affected than adults.\r\nOf atropine half a grain has proved fatal. Recovery has taken place\r\nafter five grains of the sulphate.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Twelve hours to several days.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--From organic mixtures the alkaloid may be\r\nobtained by Stas‘s process, and treated according to Vitali with a\r\nlittle fuming nitric acid, and then dried in a water bath: when cold,\r\nit must be moistened with a drop of potassæ dissolved in absolute\r\nalcohol. A violet colour changing to red is produced, the violet being\r\ncharacteristic, as strychnia when treated as above gives a red colour.\r\nThe physiological action on the pupil must also be noted. When the\r\nberries are taken, the mucous membrane of the stomach may be found\r\ndyed of a purple colour, turned green by alkalies and red by acids.\r\nFragments of the berries may also be found in the stomach.\r\n\r\nTo a small quantity of solid atropine add a drop or two of strong\r\nsulphuric acid, then a crystal of sodium nitrite; a yellow colour is\r\nproduced, which alcoholic solution of potash changes to reddish-violet\r\nand then pale rose.\r\n\r\nFree atropine gives a red colour with phenolpthalein; the colour is\r\ndischarged with alcohol, but reappears on evaporating it.\r\n\r\n_Gerrard‘s Test._--Mercuric chloride dissolved in alcohol gives a red\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Blyth‘s Test._--To the solid alkaloid add strong solution of baryta,\r\nevaporate, to dryness, and heat the residue, when the smell of hawthorn\r\nblossom is given off.\r\n\r\n_Wormley‘s Test._--An alcoholic solution of bromine gives a crystalline\r\nyellow precipitate.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash out the stomach and give hypodermic injections\r\nof one-third of a grain of pilocarpine, which is the best antidote.\r\nEmetics and purgatives, castor-oil and animal charcoal may be\r\nadministered. The symptoms as they present themselves must be treated\r\non general principles.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--Belladonna has been stated to act in\r\n        antagonism to opium, and its administration\r\n        recommended in poisoning by that drug.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYOSCYAMUS\r\n\r\nHyoscyamus, _Hyoscyamus niger_, or henbane (_N.O. Solanaceæ_),\r\nalkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, taken in large doses, produces\r\nsymptoms not unlike those due to belladonna. There is the same\r\naffection of sight--double vision; the same dilatation of the pupils,\r\ndelirium, confusion of thought, insensibility, and coma. Hyoscine has\r\na hypnotic effect in comparison to the deliriant action of belladonna.\r\nBut its action varies very much on different people. A form of mania,\r\nwith wild hallucinations, has sometimes been observed to follow the\r\nadministration of this drug.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar property of henbane is marked by its tendency to produce\r\na general paralysis of the nervous system. The root has been eaten by\r\nmistake for parsnips, when all the foregoing symptoms were present. The\r\nseeds are more poisonous than the roots, the leaves being the least\r\npoisonous part of the plant.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The morbid appearances are not unlike those\r\nwhich result from poisoning with belladonna.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Nothing certain can be stated as to the amount required\r\nto cause death. Alarming symptoms are said to have followed the\r\nadministration of ten minims of the tincture, repeated every six hours.\r\nTwenty of the _seeds_ have caused active delirium. Idiosyncrasy may\r\nhave something to do with this result. Half a drachm of the tincture\r\nis often given to an adult, and repeated every four hours, without any\r\nunpleasant result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for belladonna, emetics and purgatives, to expel the\r\npoison from the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAMONIUM\r\n\r\nThe Thorn Apple, _Datura Stramonium_ (_N.O. Solanaceæ_), possesses\r\npowerful poisonous properties. These are marked by the production of\r\ngiddiness, impairment of vision, and syncope. Furious delirium is not\r\ninfrequent; and in one case where this state was present there was\r\nloss of speech. The face is usually flushed, the eyes glistening and\r\nrestless, and the pupils dilated; in short, the countenance is that\r\nof one intoxicated. Taken together, the symptoms are not unlike those\r\nproduced by belladonna.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by stramonium seeds is a favourite mode of procedure among\r\nthe Hindoos; but as the poison is most frequently given to facilitate\r\nrobbery, death seldom results from its use. In India, the seeds are\r\nmixed with the boiled rice so commonly eaten there, and as they closely\r\nresemble the seeds of the common capsicum, the dangerous nature of\r\nthe mixture is not readily detected. The seeds of the datura can be\r\ndistinguished by the taste, which is slightly bitter, whereas that of\r\nthe capsicum is hot and pungent. The outward application of the leaves\r\nmay give rise to all the appearances of poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of stramonium is the alkaloid _Daturine_, which\r\ncrystallises in colourless quadrangular prisms, with a bitter acrid\r\ntaste. It resembles atropine and hyoscyamine in chemical properties.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the vessels of the brain and\r\nits membranes, with some slight gastric irritation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for belladonna, emetics and purgatives, to get rid of\r\nthe portions of the plant swallowed.\r\n\r\nSome other solanaceous plants--_Solanum Dulcamara_, Bittersweet or\r\nWoody Nightshade, _Solanum nigrum_, or Garden Nightshade, and the\r\n_Solanum tuberosum_, or Potato--possess poisonous properties. They,\r\nlike the other members of the order to which they belong, give rise to\r\nsymptoms characterised by giddiness, dimness of sight, trembling of the\r\nlimbs, and delirium. The water in which the potato has been boiled is\r\nsometimes used by the vulgar as an application to favus of the scalp.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of these plants resides in an alkaloid,\r\n_Solanine_, which is not a very powerful poison. A rabbit has been\r\nkilled in a few hours by two grains of the sulphate of solanine.\r\n\r\n\r\nŒNANTHE CROCATA\r\n\r\nHemlock-Dropwort, or Dead-tongue, is a poisonous indigenous,\r\numbelliferous plant.\r\n\r\nAccidental poisoning by this plant has occurred, the root having been\r\nmistaken for parsnip. The symptoms in one of the cases which have been\r\nrecorded were those of _delirium tremens_; in another, which terminated\r\nfatally, vomiting of blood was followed by convulsions. First\r\ncontraction and then dilatation of the pupil, spasmodic respiration,\r\nand an almost imperceptible pulse were the effects noticed. Death may\r\ntake place in a few hours.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the vessels of the brain, and\r\ngastric irritation. The face has sometimes a bloated expression, and\r\nblood may escape from the ears and mouth.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Purgatives and emetics, to evacuate the bowel and\r\nstomach, and thus get rid of the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR\r\n\r\nCamphor is a concrete vegetable oil obtained from _Camphora\r\nofficinarum_ (_N.O. Lauraceæ_). Its employment for the purpose of\r\nhomicide is rare, but several cases of accidental poisoning from the\r\nuse of the homœopathic solution have been recorded (_British Medical\r\nJournal_, 1873, vol. ii. p. 617).\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are--languor, giddiness, delirium, foaming at the mouth,\r\nvomiting of blood-tinged fluid, convulsions, gastric irritation, and\r\ngreat abdominal pain. In one case--that of a young lady aged twenty,\r\nwho took twenty-five drops of “Epps‘ Concentrated Solution of Camphor”\r\nfor a sore throat--all the above-mentioned symptoms were present; she\r\nwas also unconscious for several hours, and partially paralysed for\r\nseveral days--perfect recovery from the nervous symptoms not taking\r\nplace for more than six months.\r\n\r\nThe homœopathic solution (Rubini‘s) is stronger than that of the\r\nBritish Pharmacopœia in the proportion of 7.2 to 1. For its detection\r\nin organic fluids, it may be removed by chloroform; and from fixed\r\noils, by distillation. Water precipitates it from its alcoholic\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Those produced by irritants.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Purgation and emetics, to empty the bowel and stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALICYLIC ACID\r\n\r\nThis substance, prepared by acting on a mixture of carbolic acid and\r\nsodium with carbonic acid at a moderate heat, is used largely for\r\nacute rheumatism. In some cases premonitory symptoms of poisoning have\r\ndemanded a cessation in the administration of the drug. The most usual\r\nof these are noises in the ears, difficulty of hearing, amblyopia,\r\ndelirium, and profuse perspiration. There may be hæmorrhages from the\r\nmucous membranes, and into the retina. When the drug is discontinued\r\nthe symptoms pass off. The symptoms are held by some observers to be\r\ndue to the artificial and not the natural acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINEBRIANT POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poisons grouped under this head are characterised by causing\r\ndelirium, followed by narcotism. Recovery is not infrequently slow, the\r\nsystem suffering more or less severely from the effects of the poison.\r\n\r\nIn the case of alcohol, loss of appetite, accompanied with considerable\r\ngastric irritation, are among the after-effects of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe chief of this group are--Alcohol, Cocculus Indicus, Poisonous\r\nFungi, Nitro-Benzene.\r\n\r\nOthers of less importance will be briefly considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to consider poisoning by this substance under two\r\nforms--acute and chronic. So many anomalies present themselves that it\r\nis difficult to give a clear outline of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Acute._--In most cases the symptoms come on within a few minutes\r\nafter the poison is swallowed. Giddiness, confusion of ideas, and a\r\ndifficulty in walking straight are among the first effects produced,\r\nthese being followed by stupor and coma. Nausea and vomiting are the\r\nearly signs of recovery. In some cases there may be _no_ premonitory\r\nsymptoms, sudden and complete stupor supervening some time after a\r\nlarge dose of alcohol has been taken.\r\n\r\nThe patient not infrequently recovers from the first symptoms. A\r\nrelapse takes place; he becomes insensible, and dies convulsed. The\r\ncountenance wears a vacant expression, the face flushed and bloated,\r\nthe lips livid, and the pupils dilated and insensible to light. The\r\npupils may be contracted, but dilate on irritating the skin by a\r\npin-prick or pinch. The sensibility of the pupil to the action of\r\nlight should be regarded as a favourable symptom. The rapidity with\r\nwhich alcohol acts is not so great as to prevent the individual from\r\nwalking some distance and performing certain acts of volition. The\r\nrapidity with which the symptoms show themselves will depend upon the\r\nprevious habits of the individual, and the strength and quantity of the\r\nalcohol taken. Alcohol, when diluted, induces a preliminary stage of\r\nexcitement, followed by stupor; but when concentrated, stupor may come\r\non almost immediately after the spirit is swallowed.\r\n\r\nThe vapour of alcohol may act as a poison, giving rise to the symptoms\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nCongestion of the lungs or brain, or both together, is in most cases\r\nthe cause of death in acute poisoning by alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--The habitual dram-drinker suffers from many diseases. The\r\nappetite becomes impaired; there is considerable irritation of the\r\nstomach and bowels, marked by vomiting and purging. Then follows a long\r\nlist of organic diseases. The structure of the liver becomes changed;\r\nit may increase in size, become lighter in colour and cirrhotic,\r\nbeing then known as “hobnailed” or _dram-drinker‘s liver_. Jaundice\r\nand dropsy may be present as the result of this altered condition of\r\nthe gland. The kidneys also suffer from granular degeneration. Then\r\nfollow a long series of nervous complaints: congestion of the brain,\r\nparalysis, _delirium tremens_, and insanity. Sudden death by coma not\r\ninfrequently ends the career of the drunkard.\r\n\r\n_Delirium tremens_ is one of the most common results of the habit of\r\ndrinking; and this affection, it is stated, may be induced by the\r\nsudden discontinuance of alcohol in those who are habitually given to\r\nits use.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The stomach may present the usual signs of\r\ninflammation, due to the irritant action of alcohol. The colour of the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach may be bright red, dark red, brown, or\r\nquite pale. The brain and its membranes are sometimes congested, and\r\nthe intracranial vessels gorged with blood. The odour of alcohol may\r\nbe present in the contents of the stomach; and alcohol may, in some\r\ncases, be detected in the lungs, brain, and other organs of the body.\r\nThe lungs are not infrequently found congested, and the right cavities\r\nof the heart full of dark-coloured blood. Casper examined a case in\r\nwhich the cavities of the heart were empty. The blood is remarkably\r\nfluid, and of a dark colour. “Lymphatic exudation between the cerebral\r\nmeninges, so that the pia mater upon the cerebral hemispheres is seen\r\nhere and there whitish as if varnished, is not a result of death from\r\ndrinking, but is the result of the chronic irritation of the brain by\r\nhabitual drunkenness, and is therefore a very common appearance in the\r\nbodies of all drunkards, from whatever cause they have died.” One other\r\ncondition occurring in those dying from the effects of alcohol, is the\r\nremarkably long continued presence of the _rigor mortis_, and perfect\r\nfreedom from putrefaction, even up to the ninth day, in an atmosphere\r\nby no means unfavourable to early decomposition. A condition of the\r\nskin known as _cutis anserina_, or “goose skin,” was present in some of\r\nthe cases examined by Casper.\r\n\r\n_Absorption and Elimination._--From experiments on animals, it has been\r\nshown that alcohol is rapidly absorbed, and then eliminated from the\r\nsystem, and that all traces of alcohol may disappear in a few hours,\r\nand yet death be the result of its action. Alcohol is supposed to be\r\ndecomposed in the body, but the exact changes it undergoes do not\r\nappear to be very clearly made out.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has occurred in a few minutes after a large\r\ndose of alcohol had been swallowed. The average fatal period is about\r\ntwenty-four hours. Death may also be an indirect result of the action\r\nof alcohol on the system.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Uncertain. The age and habits of the individual must be\r\nconsidered. Between three and four ounces proved fatal to a boy seven\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n     Table showing the Points of Distinction between Concussion\r\n           of the Brain, Alcoholic Poisoning, and\r\n                     Poisoning by Opium.\r\n     -----------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n    Concussion of the Brain.|Alcoholic Poisoning. |  Poisoning by Opium.\r\n     -----------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n       1.

Characteristic smell.\r\n\r\n    2. It dissolves camphor.\r\n\r\n    3. Treated with dilute sulphuric acid and a strong solution\r\n       of bichromate of potash, the green oxide of chromium\r\n       is set free, and the vapour of _aldehyde_ may be\r\n       detected by the smell.\r\n\r\n    4. Burnt under the mouth of a test tube, moistened with\r\n       solution of baryta or lime-water, a deposit is formed in\r\n       the tube of carbonate of baryta or lime.\r\n\r\n    5. If a few drops of a solution of iodine in iodide of\r\n       potassium be added to alcohol, and then sufficient\r\n       caustic potash be added to decolourise it, a crystalline\r\n       precipitate of iodoform with its characteristic odour\r\n       will be formed.\r\n\r\n    6. If copper turnings be added to a solution containing\r\n       alcohol, then some strong nitric and sulphuric acid, and\r\n       the mixture warmed, the odour of sweet spirit of nitre\r\n       will be given off.\r\n\r\n    7. On warming with sodium or lead acetate and sulphuric acid\r\n       the odour of acetic ether is evolved.\r\n\r\n_Alcohol in the Contents of the Stomach or in the Tissues._--The\r\ncontents of the stomach, or the tissues bruised and macerated in\r\ndistilled water, should be carefully distilled in a water bath. It\r\nwill be necessary to neutralise the liquid prior to distillation.\r\nThe distillate should be mixed with chloride of calcium or anhydrous\r\nsulphate of copper, and re-distilled. The liquid thus obtained is\r\nshaken with dry carbonate of potash, and allowed to settle. The alcohol\r\nrises to the top of the mixture, whence it may be removed by the aid of\r\na pipette, and tested as before mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Immediate use of the stomach pump and emetics; to empty\r\nthe stomach a hypodermic injection of apomorphine may be given.\r\nAffusion of cold water to the head, or the injection of cold water\r\ninto the ears, may be tried. The administration of ammonia, and the\r\nemployment of galvanism, have been of service in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCAINE\r\n\r\nCocaine is an alkaloid obtained from the _Erythroxylon Coca_. It\r\nproduces a paralysing effect upon the endings of sensory nerves, and is\r\nused as a local anæsthetic. When absorbed into the blood it paralyses\r\nthe vagus and causes increased rapidity of the pulse. Applied to the\r\neye it causes dilatation of the pupil. It first has a stimulating\r\naction on the centres of the brain and spinal cord, finally paralysing\r\nthem. It produces death by paralysis of respiration, according to\r\nMosso, by causing tetanus of the respiratory muscles.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms produced are pallor, cyanosis, faintness, and\r\ncold sweats, pain in the precordial region, rapid pulse, intermittent\r\nheart beat, laboured respiration. The pupils are dilated. Speech\r\nbecomes incoherent, there may be trismus of the jaws, the ideas are\r\nconfused, and there may be delirium. Tetanic spasms of muscles may\r\noccur, and convulsions, also loss of consciousness.\r\n\r\nChronic poisoning, following the cocaine habit, produces a long\r\nseries of symptoms which are manifestations of mental and physical\r\ndegeneration, which in extreme cases may pass on to insanity, with\r\nhallucinations and delusions.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Half a grain injected into the gum of an adult has\r\ncaused alarming symptoms, and two-thirds of a grain has caused death.\r\nRecovery has taken place after forty-three grains were taken by the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--Death has occurred in twenty minutes after three and a\r\nhalf grains by hypodermic injection.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The alkaloid may be separated from the stomach\r\ncontents or viscera by the usual procedure for extraction of alkaloids.\r\n\r\n1. On the addition of strong nitric acid and evaporating to dryness,\r\nthe residue when treated with alcoholic solution of potash gives off an\r\nodour like peppermint or meadow-sweet.\r\n\r\n2. _Goeldner‘s Test._--Strong sulphuric acid and resorcin when mixed\r\nwith cocaine gives a blue colour, changing to rose-pink on addition of\r\ncaustic potash. Goeldner considers this a reaction peculiar to cocaine.\r\n\r\n3. _Metzer‘s Test._--If a few drops of a 5 per cent. solution of\r\nchromic acid in water be added to a solution of cocaine hydrochloride,\r\neach drop gives a yellow precipitate which redissolves. The addition of\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid produces a yellow precipitate of chromate of\r\ncocaine. Metzer considers this reaction peculiar to cocaine.\r\n\r\n4. When applied to the tongue or lips a feeling of numbness is\r\nproduced; it is rendered more effectual if a solution of sodium\r\nbicarbonate be first applied to the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash out the stomach and encourage vomiting. Stimulants\r\nand ammonia should be given freely, and if convulsions occur chloroform\r\nshould be inhaled. Tannic acid or gallic acid in thirty-grain doses\r\nhave been recommended, also iodine one grain with potassium iodide ten\r\ngrains, in a wine-glassful of water between the stomach-washing or\r\nemesis. Oxygen inhalations and artificial respiration may be resorted\r\nto in failure of the respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCCULUS INDICUS\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Cocculus Indicus, _Anamirta paniculata_ (_N.O.\r\nMenispermaceæ_), is poisonous, and is frequently used by poachers to\r\ncapture fish. The berries are ground to powder, mixed with bread,\r\nand then thrown into the water. When taken by the fish, they become\r\nstupefied, float to the surface, and are then taken.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties are due to a crystalline alkaloid,\r\n_Picrotoxin_. Fraudulent publicans have used this drug for the\r\nadulteration of beer. The strength of the beer is first reduced by the\r\naddition of salt and water, and then the cocculus indicus is added,\r\nto give to it an intoxicating property. The effect produced on the\r\nunfortunate customers is a strong desire to sleep, with more or less\r\nwakefulness. Loss of voluntary power is present, but consciousness\r\nis not lost, the sufferer lying in a state bordering on nightmare.\r\nCocculus is not used in medicine or the arts, and yet a large quantity\r\nis imported, and mysteriously disappears in this country.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms which have been noticed in poisoning by this\r\nsubstance are--nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pains, stupor, and\r\nintoxication. Two deaths at least have been reported as resulting from\r\nit. In the case of R. _v._ Cluderay, “the defendant administered to a\r\nchild two cocculus indicus berries, entire in the pod, with intent to\r\nmurder the child.” The kernel is a poison; the pod is not, and will\r\nnot dissolve in the stomach; and they were therefore harmless. This\r\nwas held to be administering poison with intent to murder, within the\r\nsection of the Statute.\r\n\r\n_Picrotoxin_, the alkaloid, is in fine white crystals, intensely bitter\r\nto the taste, soluble in boiling water, slightly so in cold. Alcohol\r\nand ether readily dissolve it. Strong nitric acid dissolves it,\r\nwithout change of colour; and sulphuric acid produces an orange-yellow\r\ncolour, changed to pale yellow by dilution. In organic liquids it\r\nmight be mistaken for sugar, or _vice versa_, as it precipitates the\r\noxide of copper when boiled with the sulphate of copper and potash. In\r\nexamining beer supposed to be adulterated with picrotoxin, the beer\r\nshould be acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and then shaken up with\r\nether. On spontaneous evaporation of the ether, the picrotoxin is left\r\nin crystals.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stomach pump, emetics, apomorphine subcutaneously; then\r\nchloral and the bromide of potassium. Chloroform may be inhaled.\r\nParaldehyde is said to be a specific antidote.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOLIUM TEMULENTUM\r\n\r\nThe seeds of _Lolium temulentum_, or common darnel, are poisonous.\r\nCases of poisoning have occurred from these seeds being accidentally\r\nground with wheat or rye, and then made into bread.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting followed by\r\ngiddiness, deafness, loss of vision, and, in some cases, delirium. Not\r\ninfrequently the symptoms resemble those produced by ergot. No death\r\nhas been recorded as resulting from the use of these seeds. Three\r\nounces of paste made from darnel flour, given to a dog, did not cause\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS FUNGI\r\n\r\nAccidental poisoning by mushrooms is by no means rare. The _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_, and a few others, are edible; but it is a fact worthy\r\nof notice that the poisonous properties of mushrooms are modified\r\nby climate and the seasons of the year at which they are collected.\r\nIdiosyncrasy may have something to do with the injurious effects\r\nproduced on some persons by the fungi.\r\n\r\nThe _Agaricus campestris_, or common mushroom of this country, is\r\nsometimes poisonous; and in some countries--Italy and Hungary--it is\r\nusually avoided. In Russia and in France certain fungi are eaten which\r\nare regarded as poisonous by us.\r\n\r\nBentley gives, in his _Botany_, the following table, by which edible\r\nand poisonous mushrooms may be known:\r\n\r\n    -----------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n                 Edible.               |       Poisonous.\r\n    -----------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n      1.

Generally white or brownish.  |  2. Usually with bright colours.\r\n                                       |\r\n      3. Have a compact, brittle       |  3.

Juice watery.                 |  5. Juice often milky.\r\n                                       |\r\n      6. Odour agreeable.              |  6. Odour commonly powerful and\r\n                                       |     disagreeable.\r\n                                       |\r\n      7. Taste not bitter, acrid,      |  7. Have an acrid, astringent,\r\n         salt, or astringent.          |     acid, salt, or bitter taste.\r\n    -----------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Two sets of symptoms may follow the use of mushrooms as\r\nfood--those of irritant and those of narcotic poisoning. In the latter\r\nclass, giddiness, double vision, and even delirium, have been present.\r\nNausea, vomiting, purging, and convulsions characterise those of the\r\nformer class. In some cases the individual has presented all the\r\nappearances of intoxication.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These will depend to a great extent upon\r\nthe character of the symptoms prior to death. If signs of irritation\r\nhave been present, inflammation of the stomach and bowels will most\r\nprobably be found; but if, on the other hand, narcotic symptoms were\r\npredominant, congestion of the vessels of the brain will most likely be\r\npresent. Arsenic and other poisons have been mixed with mushrooms with\r\nintent to kill; the probability of this occurring should be borne in\r\nmind, and a rigid examination of the contents of the stomach made in\r\nall doubtful cases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Castor-oil and emetics, atropine hypodermically.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROBENZENE, OR ESSENCE OF MIRBANE\r\n\r\nThis substance, prepared by acting on benzene by nitric acid, is\r\nlargely used for flavouring sweets, &c. Nitrobenzene is a heavy,\r\nyellow, oily substance with a strong odour of bitter-almond oil, from\r\nwhich, however, it differs by undergoing no change of colour when\r\nagitated with strong sulphuric acid. The natural oil acquires a fine\r\ncrimson colour when treated with strong sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These may not make their appearance for three or four\r\nhours after the poison is swallowed or inhaled. The vapour is more\r\npowerful than the liquid. In some cases which have been described,\r\nthe patient has complained of feeling drunk, with pain in the head,\r\ngiddiness, faintness, distorted vision, drowsiness, ending in coma and\r\ndeath. The face is flushed, the jaws sometimes spasmodically closed,\r\nand the lips livid. Vomiting then supervenes, the vomited matters\r\nhaving the odour of bitter almonds. Symptoms not unlike those produced\r\nby prussic acid or the essential oil of bitter almonds have been\r\nnoticed in one or two cases; but, as a rule, the insensibility is not\r\nimmediate, as in prussic acid poisoning, and in this fact lies the\r\ndistinction between the two substances. Rapidly fatal cases might be\r\nmistaken for apoplexy, but the odour betrays the cause of death.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Nothing very characteristic is found after\r\ndeath due to this poison. The blood is sometimes black and fluid and\r\ngives the spectrum of acid hæmatin, the lungs congested, and the liver\r\nof a purple colour. The blood, contents of the stomach, and even the\r\ntissues, may smell strongly of this substance.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Nitrobenzene may be separated by distilling the\r\norganic mixture with sulphuric acid, when the distillate will contain\r\nthe poison if present. It is converted into aniline by heating it\r\nwith acetic acid and iron filings. (See test for aniline, _infra._)\r\nOn account of its odour, the only substance with which it can be\r\nconfounded is the essential oil of bitter almonds, which owes its\r\npoisonous properties to the prussic acid it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Table may assist in its Detection.\r\n\r\n    -----------------------+---------------------+-----------------------\r\n                           |    Nitrobenzene.    | Oil of Bitter Almonds.\r\n    -----------------------+---------------------+-----------------------\r\n     Strong sulphuric acid.| No change of colour.| A rich crimson colour.\r\n                           |                     |\r\n     Proto-sulphate and the| No blue colour.     | Prussian blue.\r\n       persulphate of iron,|                     |\r\n       liquor potassæ, and |                     |\r\n       hydrochloric acid.  |                     |\r\n                           |                     |\r\n     Solution of sulphate  | Insoluble.          | Soluble.\r\n       of soda.            |                     |\r\n    -----------------------+---------------------+-----------------------\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stomach pump, emetics, stimulants, cold douche,\r\nartificial respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDINITROBENZENE\r\n\r\nThis substance is a solid of a yellow colour, and is used in the\r\nmanufacture of _roburite_, _bellite_, and _sicherite_, explosives used\r\nin coal mines for blasting. Poisoning by it occurs amongst the workmen\r\nwho come in contact with it in factories where it is used, by inhaling\r\neither the vapour or fine particles, and by handling it may become\r\nabsorbed through the skin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In acute cases these are similar to poisoning by\r\nnitrobenzene. In chronic poisoning there is a marked and peculiar\r\npallor of the face, with a livid blue colour of the ears, lips,\r\nfingers, and toes. Nausea and vomiting occur, with weakness,\r\ngiddiness, and staggering. Amblyopia is a common symptom, with\r\nconcentric contraction of the visual field and central scotoma. The\r\nblood resembles that of pernicious anæmia, and the urine is brown or\r\nblackish, due to some pigments of the aromatic series.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The blood has been found\r\nchocolate-coloured, and ecchymoses have been noted in mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for nitrobenzene.\r\n\r\n\r\nANILINE\r\n\r\nAniline is a colourless oily liquid gradually changing to brown on\r\nexposure to air. The various aniline dyes are obtained by oxidation\r\nof aniline. Aniline is produced by reduction of nitrobenzene. It is\r\nslightly soluble in water, freely so in alcohol or ether. It can be\r\nabsorbed through the unbroken skin as well as by the lungs and mucous\r\nmembranes. It is used in the manufacture of marking inks. It has very\r\ntoxic properties.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms come on rapidly--nausea and vomiting,\r\nwith giddiness and drowsiness; the lips, face, ears, fingers, toes,\r\nconjunctivæ, and mucous membranes become cyanotic. The respirations\r\nare slow and laboured. The pulse may be full and slow, or small and\r\nirregular. The body surface is cold, the pupils react sluggishly\r\nto light. The blood is chocolate-coloured, and is said to give the\r\nspectrum of methæmoglobin. The blue colour is held to be due to pigment\r\nchanges, and not to true cyanosis. Convulsions and coma may come on in\r\nfatal cases.\r\n\r\nBuchanan met with a case of aniline poisoning in a man who by mistake\r\nswallowed about half an ounce of marking ink. Vomiting came on early,\r\nwith giddiness and staggering gait. The body became changed in colour\r\nvery rapidly--the colour being between a slate and leaden hue. The\r\neyeballs were of the same colour but of a lighter shade, the mouth\r\nand tongue exhibited the colour most markedly. The temperature was\r\nsubnormal, the pulse quick and feeble, and the breathing occasionally\r\ninterrupted with sighing respirations. The blood failed to give the\r\nspectrum of methæmoglobin. The symptoms passed off within twenty-four\r\nhours. During the illness, the man passed several green-coloured\r\nmotions. The vomit was of a purplish-black colour--from the marking\r\nink--and on analysis gave the reactions of aniline. Some of the ink was\r\nprocured, and on being analysed was found to consist of hydrochloride\r\nof aniline and chloride of copper. The treatment consisted of stomach\r\nlavage and inhalations of oxygen, which gave the patient much relief.\r\n\r\nCases have been recorded of aniline poisoning in infants from\r\nabsorption of the material from linen napkins, which were stamped\r\nwith marking ink. Buchanan has seen lividity arise from the dry\r\nhydrochloride of aniline having been carried in a paper parcel in the\r\nwaistcoat pocket for two or three days.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--None characteristic.\r\n\r\n_Fatal dose._--Six drachms have proved fatal, probably less might do so.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Aniline may be separated from organic matter by\r\nalkalising and distilling the mixture.\r\n\r\n1. If chloride of lime (bleaching powder) be added slowly to an aqueous\r\nsolution of aniline, a deep purple colour is produced, which changes to\r\nbrownish-red.\r\n\r\n2. If strong sulphuric acid be added to aniline in a porcelain capsule\r\nit forms a dirty-white mass; on adding water and then potassium\r\nbichromate a bronze-green colour is produced, which changes rapidly to\r\nblue and then black.\r\n\r\n3. If aniline be dissolved in excess of aqueous solution of phenol, and\r\nbleaching powder dropped into the mixture, a yellow streak changing to\r\nblue follows each drop.\r\n\r\n4. Heated with corrosive sublimate a rich crimson colour is produced.\r\n\r\n5. If aniline be mixed with a little chloroform and alcoholic solution\r\nof potash and heated, the peculiar odour of phenyl-isocyanide is given\r\noff.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for nitrobenzene.\r\n\r\nFusel-oil, Amylic Alcohol, Potato-Spirit.--Fusel-oil, also known as\r\namylic alcohol, is known by its unpleasant odour and burning taste; it\r\nacts like alcohol as an inebriant, giving rise to headache, giddiness,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nNitro-glycerine.--In liquid or vapour, violent headache and throbbing\r\nin the temples are produced by this substance, which is used in the\r\ntreatment of angina pectoris.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETANILIDE (ANTIFEBRIN), PHENAZONUM (ANTIPYRIN), AND PHENACETIN\r\n\r\nThese substances are used extensively as antipyretics. They have been\r\nknown to cause poisoning when administered in large doses.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are principally those of depression,\r\nimpairment of sight, vertigo, sleepiness, and unconsciousness;\r\ncollapse, cyanosis, and loss of body temperature; the pulse and\r\nrespiration are lowered. Antipyrin causes tumultuous action of the\r\nheart, and there may be erythematous or herpetic eruptions on the skin.\r\nAniline derivatives, like sulphonal and other synthetic drugs, tend\r\nto destroy the red corpuscles of the blood, and decompose hæmaglobin,\r\nproducing hæmatoporphyrin which appears in the urine.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Antifebrin may be extracted from an acid solution\r\nby chloroform; for antipyrin the solution should be alkaline.\r\n\r\n_Antifebrin_ gives the phenyl-isocyanide reaction on warming with\r\nalcoholic solution of potash and chloroform. Bichromate of potassium\r\ndissolved in strong sulphuric acid gives a red colour, changing to\r\nbrown and dirty green; sodium nitrite and strong hydrochloric acid give\r\na yellow colour, changing to green and blue; on evaporation the residue\r\nis orange, and turns red on addition of ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Antipyrin._--Heated with strong nitric acid and the liquid\r\nallowed to cool, a purple colour is produced; if water be added a\r\nviolet precipitate is thrown down, and the filtered liquid will be\r\npurplish-red. Ferric chloride gives a blood-red colour, destroyed by\r\na mineral acid. An aqueous solution of potassium nitrite and strong\r\nsulphuric acid gives a green colour.\r\n\r\n_Phenacetin_ is coloured yellow by nitric acid, the colour persisting\r\nwhen heated. It dissolves in sulphuric acid without change of colour.\r\nBoiled with hydrochloric acid, then diluted with water and chromic acid\r\nsolution added, gives a deep red solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSEDATIVE POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITALIS\r\n\r\nThe common foxglove, _Digitalis purpurea_, (_N.O. Scrophulariaceæ_),\r\ngrows wild in the hedges in the South of England. All parts of the\r\nplant are poisonous, from the presence of a glucoside _digitalin_, and\r\nin addition it also contains the glucosides digitoxin, digitonin, and\r\ndigitalein; according to Kopp, digitoxin is six to ten times more toxic\r\nthan digitalin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Nausea, salivation, vomiting, purging, and severe\r\nabdominal pains are first noticed. The patient then complains of pain\r\nin the head, giddiness, and a gradual loss of sight. The eyes protrude,\r\nthe pupils are dilated and insensible to light, and the sclerotics,\r\naccording to Tardieu, are of a characteristic blue colour; the pulse\r\nweak, slow (forty in the minute) and jerky, sometimes intermittent. The\r\nsurface of the body is cold, and bathed in perspiration. An aggravation\r\nin the symptoms takes place whenever the patient attempts to leave the\r\nrecumbent position; hence, in all cases of poisoning, and in those\r\nwhere the therapeutical action of the drug is sought, the patient\r\nshould be warned of the danger of leaving the recumbent posture. A\r\nmarked depression in the action of the heart is a characteristic\r\neffect of this poison. The effect on the heart may be divided into\r\nthree stages: (1) diminution in the frequency of the pulse, and rise\r\nof arterial pressure; (2) both of these become abnormally low; (3)\r\nfrequency of pulse abnormally high, arterial pressure abnormally low.\r\nConvulsions have sometimes been noticed, and syncope and stupor are not\r\nuncommon.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the brain and its membranes,\r\nand some inflammatory redness of the mucous membrane of the stomach.\r\nThe blood is fluid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Uncertain. Large doses of the infusion and tincture have\r\nbeen given without any untoward results. Thirty-eight grains of the\r\npowdered leaves, and nine drachms of the tincture, have proved fatal.\r\nOne-quarter to half a grain of digitalin might prove fatal to an adult.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From three-quarters of an hour to twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--If the leaves in an infusion be taken, these must\r\nbe sought for and examined. The glucoside may be extracted by first\r\nremoving the impurities by means of petroleum ether, then acidifying\r\nwith acetic acid and extracting with chloroform.\r\n\r\nThe following are the tests for _digitalin_:\r\n\r\n    1. An almost amorphous, white, or fawn-coloured inodorous\r\n       substance.\r\n\r\n    2. Almost insoluble in water.\r\n\r\n    3. Decomposes nitric acid, with the evolution of nitrous\r\n       acid fumes. An orange-yellow-coloured solution is formed,\r\n       which, in a few days, assumes a golden-yellow tint.\r\n\r\n    4. Sulphuric acid dissolves it, changing it to a\r\n       reddish-brown colour, changed to violet by bromine vapour.\r\n\r\n    5. Hydrochloric acid with it at first forms a yellow\r\n       solution, which, when heated, changes to a bright green\r\n       colour.\r\n\r\nThe physiological test may be employed by injecting a solution of a\r\ncarefully prepared extract of the contents of the stomach or vomited\r\nmatters under the skin of a frog, dog, or rabbit.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Purgatives and emetics should be given, followed by\r\ninfusions containing tannin, green tea, oak bark, galls, strong coffee,\r\nand other stimulants. The patient should be kept in the recumbent\r\nposture, and on no account allowed to sit up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tobacco, _Nicotiana Tabacum_ (_N.O. Solanaceæ_),\r\nhas greatly increased of late years. In some countries its use was\r\nprohibited by stringent laws. In Russia amputation of the nose was the\r\npunishment. Several Popes have excommunicated those who smoked in St.\r\nPeter‘s at Rome; and in some parts of Switzerland it was ranked on the\r\ntables next to adultery. Amurath IV made smoking tobacco a capital\r\noffence. Be this as it may, the moderate use of tobacco does not appear\r\nto lead to injurious results; and it is found that workmen engaged in\r\nthe manufacture of tobacco do not suffer from any diseases other than\r\nthose affecting the generality of mankind.\r\n\r\n_Nicotine_--the alkaloid--is a colourless or slightly amber-coloured,\r\noily, volatile liquid. It is to this principle that the poisonous\r\nactivity of the drug is due. It differs from the other oily alkaloid,\r\n_conine_, in appearing of a green colour when a drop is placed on the\r\nsurface of white enamelled glass--conine having a _pink_ colour. They\r\nboth leave a greasy stain on paper. Nicotine has been detected by\r\nStas‘s process in the tongue, stomach, lungs, and liver. A ptomaine not\r\nunlike nicotine has been discovered.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Symptoms of poisoning by tobacco are by no means uniform,\r\nand have been variously described by observers. As a type of the\r\neffects produced, the following may be noticed as occurring to the tyro\r\nafter his first or second “pipe”: The pulse is primarily quickened;\r\nthen follow nausea and faintness, accompanied with an intense feeling\r\nof sinking. The face is blanched, the pulse slow; perspiration\r\nstands on the forehead, and ultimately he vomits, and then gradually\r\nrecovers. Cold air blowing on the face, or sponging the face with\r\ncold water, materially hastens a return to comfort. Sometimes, as\r\nin the case related by Dr. Marshall Hall of a man who smoked two\r\n“pipes,” nausea, vomiting, and syncope occurred, followed by stupor,\r\nstertorous breathing, general spasms, and insensibility of the pupil.\r\nAfter an interval of a few hours, the above symptoms again returned,\r\nbut from which the patient ultimately recovered. Death has resulted\r\nas a sequence to excessive smoking. Gruelin records two cases--one\r\nfrom seventeen, the other from eighteen, pipes smoked at a sitting.\r\nThe symptoms after taking nicotine are more acute, and are a burning\r\nacrid taste in the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, unconsciousness,\r\nshock, sighing respirations, delirium, convulsions; the pupils first\r\ncontracted then dilated.\r\n\r\nThe filthy habit of snuff-taking has also been accredited with one\r\nor two deaths. Santeuil, the French poet, died in two days from the\r\neffects of snuff mixed with his wine as a practical joke.\r\n\r\nIn animals, the symptoms are--nausea, vomiting, purging, convulsions,\r\nstupor, and death. The heart becomes paralysed. One drop of the\r\nempyreumatic oil on the tongue of a cat killed it in two minutes, the\r\nanimal dying in convulsions.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These are by no means uniform or\r\ncharacteristic. If much vomiting precedes death, the vessels of the\r\nbrain may be engorged with blood. Inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines is also present in some cases. The odour of nicotine may be\r\ndetected in the vomit or the stomach contents.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--The symptoms soon make their appearance, and death has\r\noccurred in three-quarters of an hour, or even less--in three minutes\r\nafter taking the nicotine, in fifteen minutes after enema of tobacco.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One to three drops of nicotine would probably kill an\r\nadult in a few minutes; an enema containing half a drachm of the leaves\r\nhas proved fatal.\r\n\r\nAs an enema, tobacco should be used with extreme care.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Nicotine obtained by the usual process for\r\nalkaloid extraction, and mixed with water, may have the following tests\r\napplied after solution in dilute hydrochloric acid:\r\n\r\n    1. Chloride of platinum gives an orange-yellow crystalline\r\n       precipitate.\r\n\r\n    2. Corrosive sublimate, a white crystalline precipitate.\r\n\r\n    3. Arsenio-nitrate of silver, a yellow precipitate.\r\n\r\n    4. Caustic potash added to the hydrochloride and warmed\r\n       causes a strong odour of tobacco.\r\n\r\n    5. Solution of iodine in ether added to ethereal solution\r\n       of nicotine is followed by the production of long needle\r\n       crystals after some hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Promote vomiting, wash out the stomach, cold water\r\ndouches, and stimulants. Inject strychnine hypodermically.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBELIA\r\n\r\nLobelia, or Indian Tobacco, _Lobelia inflata_ (_N.O. Lobeliaceæ_),\r\nis extensively employed in North America in the treatment of asthma.\r\nThe plant is officinal in the British Pharmacopœia. In small doses it\r\npossesses expectorant properties.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Nausea, vomiting, giddiness, cold clammy sweats, and\r\ngreat depression. The pulse becomes irregular, and very feeble. Taken\r\ntogether, the symptoms are not unlike those produced by tobacco.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--One to two days, or more.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--One drachm of the powder.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The alkaloid is fluid and may be extracted like\r\nnicotine; with it (1) strong sulphuric acid gives a red colour; (2)\r\nsulphomolybdic acid gives a violet colour.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as recommended under tobacco. Stimulants should\r\nbe given, ether hypodermically or alcohol _per rectum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERATRINE\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid _Veratrine_ is obtained from the dried fruit of _Asagrœa\r\nofficinalis_ (_N.O. Melanthaceæ_).\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid is in the form of a white amorphous powder, bitter and\r\nacrid to the taste. It acts as a powerful errhine, causing violent\r\nsneezing. Insoluble in water, it is readily dissolved by alcohol,\r\nether, and chloroform. When gently heated on a plate with strong\r\nsulphuric acid, it first turns yellow, then crimson. Veratrine is\r\nentirely dissipated by heat.\r\n\r\nTwo grains of the alkaloid killed a cat in one minute; a dog being\r\ndestroyed in two hours by a dose of three grains. The one-sixteenth of\r\na grain (?) of veratrine in a pill caused alarming symptoms in an adult\r\nwoman, for whom it was ordered by a medical man.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Acrid burning sensation in the throat and down the\r\nœsophagus to the stomach, vomiting, great thirst, diarrhœa may occur\r\nwith tenesmus. The pulse is feeble and respiration slow. The pupils may\r\nbe dilated or contracted. Collapse and twitching of muscles, loss of\r\nconsciousness and convulsions, or delirium and stupor may come on.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Are the same as in poisoning by any of the\r\nvegetable irritants.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stomach pump, and emetics. Astringent infusions should\r\nbe given, and alcohol and opium administered if the condition of the\r\npatient seems to require them.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Extract in the usual way for alkaloids.\r\n\r\n1. Strong sulphuric acid produces a yellow colour, changing to red,\r\nproduced rapidly if heated.\r\n\r\n2. Strong hydrochloric acid and heat produces a red colour.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphomolybdic acid produces a reddish colour, changing to dirty\r\nbrown, greenish, and finally blue.\r\n\r\nThese tests should be done with the solid veratrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCYANIC ACID\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid is a compound of cyanogen and hydrogen. It was first\r\nobtained by Scheele in 1782, but it was not until 1815 that Gay-Lussac\r\npointed out its real nature. Anhydrous hydrocyanic acid may be obtained\r\nby passing over cyanide of mercury, gently heated, a stream of dry\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. It is now made by mixing ferrocyanide of\r\npotassium with dilute sulphuric acid, and applying heat, when the acid\r\nis distilled over and collected in a cooled receiver.\r\n\r\nDilute hydrocyanic acid, the only important form of the acid from a\r\ntoxicological point of view, is a colourless, feebly acid liquid,\r\nwith a peculiar odour, like that of bitter almonds or peach kernels\r\n(specific gravity, 0.997). The Pharmacopœial acid contains 2 per cent.\r\nof anhydrous acid; that of Scheele 5 per cent. According to Taylor,\r\nhowever, the percentage of the acid varies from 1.3 to 6.5. Taking\r\ninto consideration the smallness of the dose, and the shortness of the\r\ntime before death occurs, it is the most deadly of all known poisons.\r\nPrussic acid is not regarded as a cumulative poison--that is, it does\r\nnot gradually accumulate in the body and then break out with dangerous\r\nor fatal violence.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These will be more or less modified by the quantity of\r\nthe dose, and in some cases closely resemble an attack of epilepsy. In\r\nmost cases, the symptoms of poisoning are seldom delayed beyond _one_\r\nor _two_ minutes; and if the dose be large, the symptoms of poisoning\r\nmay come on while the person is drinking. Giddiness, followed by almost\r\ncomplete insensibility, mark the accession of the symptoms. The eyes\r\nare fixed, staring, and glassy; the pupils are dilated, and insensible\r\nto light. The muscles of the extremities are relaxed, and the limbs\r\nflaccid. A white or bloody froth surrounds the mouth, and the jaws\r\nare fixed. The surface of the body is cold and clammy to the touch;\r\nthe respiration is sometimes long-drawn and spasmodic; and the pulse\r\nso reduced as to be almost imperceptible. The breathing is sometimes\r\n_stertorous_ in character. This is an important fact; for, in ignorance\r\nof the occasional presence of this symptom, it was argued that Walter\r\nPalmer, whose breathing was stertorous, died of apoplexy, and not from\r\nprussic acid as was alleged. When the dose is small (between twenty\r\nand thirty drops of the dilute acid), the patient complains of nausea,\r\ngiddiness, and a feeling of constriction round the head. The mind is\r\nconfused, the pulse hurried, and the breathing irregular. Salivation\r\nmay also be present. Tetanic spasms and involuntary evacuations precede\r\nthe fatal termination. When the dose is from ten to twenty drops, the\r\npatient complains of nausea, giddiness, and a feeling of impending\r\nsuffocation. These symptoms under treatment may soon pass off, or\r\nleave the patient more or less confused and listless. In most cases,\r\nwhere the dose is very large, death takes place suddenly, without\r\nconvulsions; but the period of death does not appear to be as short in\r\nman as in the lower animals.\r\n\r\n_External Application._--Applied to the unbroken skin, prussic acid\r\ndoes not appear to have caused any alarming symptoms; but it should\r\nbe used with the utmost caution where the skin is at all abraded or\r\nulcerated.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--In making an inspection, care should be\r\ntaken; for, if the dose be large, the vapour from the corpse on opening\r\nit has been known to produce giddiness and fainting. Externally, the\r\nskin is pale, livid, or of a violet colour. The hands are clenched,\r\nand the nails blue. The jaws are firmly set, and there is usually some\r\nfroth around the mouth. The internal organs are greatly congested, and\r\nthe venous system gorged with fluid dark-coloured blood. The stomach\r\nand intestines are sometimes inflamed, but in many cases they present\r\nno material alteration in colour.\r\n\r\nThe appearances, when only a small dose has been taken, are not unlike\r\nthose of asphyxia. The detection of the odour of hydrocyanic acid in\r\nthe body is of importance; but this may be absent from the following\r\ncauses:\r\n\r\n    1. Smallness of the quantity of the acid present.\r\n\r\n    2. Volatilisation from exposure of the corpse to the air.\r\n\r\n    3. The smallness of the dose, and its absence the result\r\n       of absorption and elimination, if death has not rapidly\r\n       taken place.\r\n\r\n    4. The amount of dilution of the poison.\r\n\r\n    5. Concealed by other odorous substances.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the smell may be detected in the stomach seven or\r\neight days after death. The viscera should, in all cases of suspected\r\npoisoning, be placed in a glass-stoppered jar, and the stopper covered\r\nby bladder and tinfoil. Hydrocyanic acid is so volatile that, unless\r\nthe greatest care be taken, all traces of it may vanish; and thus the\r\nguilty person may be allowed to escape.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From a few seconds to as many minutes. Under active\r\ntreatment, if a patient survive forty minutes, he will generally\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Thirty minims of the dilute acid of the Pharmacopœia.\r\nThis contains six-tenths of a grain of the anhydrous acid. Recovery\r\nhas, however, taken place even after comparatively large doses. The\r\nstrength and age of the individual, and also the emptiness or fulness\r\nof the stomach at the time the poison is swallowed, will materially\r\naffect the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments on Animals\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments on animals have been made to ascertain the\r\nrapidity with which prussic acid kills. The late Sir R. Christison\r\nfound that three drops projected into the eye acted on a cat in twenty\r\nseconds, and killed it in twenty more. The same quantity dropped on\r\na fresh wound in the loins acted in forty-five, and proved fatal in\r\none hundred and five seconds. In the cases where death did not occur\r\nso rapidly, there were regular fits of violent tetanus; but in the\r\nvery rapid cases, the animals perished, just as the fit was ushered\r\nin, with retraction of the head. In rabbits opisthotonos, in cats\r\nemprosthotonos, were the chief tetanic symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs a proof that the acid acts equally on the brain and spinal cord, may\r\nbe noticed the presence of coma and tetanus in some cases of poisoning\r\nby this substance.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments on animals certain effects were noticed, which are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_Expulsion of the Fæces and Urine._--In some cases only the fæces, in\r\nothers the urine alone, was involuntarily expelled; and in some other\r\ncases neither the one nor the other was present.\r\n\r\n_The Shriek or Cry._--This cry, though a common, is by no means a\r\nconstant symptom.\r\n\r\n_Convulsions._--These are sometimes present.\r\n\r\n_Acts of Volition._--Only slight acts are possible; in the case of one\r\nof the dogs experimented on by Mr. Nunneley, the animal “went down,\r\ncame up, and then went down again the whole flight of a steep, winding\r\nstaircase.”\r\n\r\nThe _Post-mortem Appearances_ were not well marked in the animals\r\nsubjected to experiment. In chronic cases, Mr. Nunneley states that\r\nboth sides of the heart were distended with black blood. The pure\r\nacid is stated to completely destroy the irritability of the heart\r\nand voluntary muscles, galvanism producing no effect whatever. “In\r\neight experiments on cats and rabbits with the pure acid, the heart\r\ncontracted spontaneously, as well as under stimuli, for some time after\r\ndeath, except in the instance of the rabbit killed with twenty-five\r\nminims, and one of the cats killed by three drops applied to the\r\ntongue. In the last two the pulsation of the heart ceased with the\r\nshort fit of tetanus which preceded death; and in the rabbit, whose\r\nchest was laid open instantly after death, the heart was gorged, and\r\nits irritability utterly extinct.”\r\n\r\n=Detection of Hydrocyanic Acid in Cases of Poisoning=\r\n\r\nThe “_Vapour Tests_” are those most readily applied to organic\r\nmixtures; but in some cases it may be necessary to make a distillation\r\nof the suspected substance, in order to isolate the poison.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be noticed is, whether any _odour_ of the acid can\r\nbe perceived in the substance under examination. In any case, the\r\ncontents of the stomach or finely-divided tissues should be mixed with\r\nwater, and examined as to the reaction with test paper. If the mixture\r\nbe found to be _alkaline_, it must be neutralised by the addition of\r\ntartaric acid; if, on the contrary, it be _acid_, carbonate of soda\r\nmust be carefully added to neutralisation. A state of neutrality is\r\nalways necessary previous to distillation, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nAn _alkaline_ state of the liquid would, on the one hand, prevent, or,\r\nat all events, retard, the evolution of the hydrocyanic acid; whilst,\r\non the other, the existence of any _free acid_ would decompose any\r\ncyanide which might be present, and thus give rise to an evolution of\r\nhydrocyanic acid not existing as such in the mixture.\r\n\r\nThe organic mixture is then placed in a flask, and the contents\r\ndistilled at as low a temperature as possible by the aid of a water\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nShould hydrocyanic acid be present, the distillate will yield all the\r\ncharacteristic reactions of the dilute acid.\r\n\r\n1. Nitrate of silver will give a curdy-white precipitate, insoluble\r\nin cold but soluble in boiling nitric acid. A portion of the\r\nprecipitate, on the addition of some liquor potassæ, sulphate of iron,\r\nferric chloride and hydrochloric acid, forms Prussian blue. In this\r\ntest, which may be taken as quite conclusive, the hydrochloric acid\r\ndecomposes the cyanide of silver; and on the addition of the sulphate\r\nof iron, Prussian blue is formed.\r\n\r\n2. If a portion of the dry precipitate formed by the nitrate of silver\r\nbe heated in a test tube, cyanogen gas will be evolved, known by its\r\ncharacteristic odour of peach blossoms, and by its burning at the mouth\r\nof the tube with a rose-coloured flame.\r\n\r\n3. To the solution containing hydrocyanic acid add a few drops of\r\npotassium nitrite, two or three drops of ferric chloride solution and\r\ndilute sulphuric acid until a yellow tint is obtained; heat to boiling,\r\ncool, precipitate excess of iron with ammonia, filter, and add one or\r\ntwo drops of a very dilute solution of colourless ammonium sulphide.\r\nA very minute quantity of hydrocyanic acid gives a violet-red colour,\r\nchanging to blue, green, and finally yellow.\r\n\r\n4. If a solution of starch be tinged blue with iodine, the colour will\r\nbe discharged by a minute quantity of hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n=Vapour Tests.=--There are three tests for the presence of hydrocyanic\r\nacid when present in organic mixtures, which have the advantage of\r\nbeing applicable without the addition of anything extraneous to the\r\nmixture to be tested. They are all dependent on the volatile nature of\r\nhydrocyanic acid, and may be applied as follows, the suspected mixture\r\nbeing divided into three portions:\r\n\r\n1. _Iron or Prussian Blue Test._--The liquid mixture to be tested is\r\nplaced in a small beaker glass, and covered with a glass plate the\r\ncentre of which is smeared with a mixture of potash and proto-sulphate\r\nof iron. The whole is now left undisturbed for some time. The glass is\r\neventually removed, and the mixture of potash and iron treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid, which, should hydrocyanic acid be present, will\r\ncause the development of Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n2. _Sulphur Test, or Liebig‘s Test._--A second portion of the original\r\nmixture is placed in a beaker, and a watch-glass containing a few drops\r\nof bisulphide of ammonium is suspended over the liquid, the mouth\r\nof the beaker being closed. A short time is allowed to elapse; the\r\nwatch-glass is then removed, and its contents evaporated to dryness\r\nat a low temperature. A blood-red colour is developed on the addition\r\nof a little perchloride of iron to the _dry_ residue. This effect is\r\ndue to the absorption of the hydrocyanic acid vapour by the bisulphide\r\nof ammonium--sulphocyanide of ammonium being formed, which, on the\r\naddition of perchloride of iron, gives the blood-red colour of the\r\nsulphocyanide of iron, which is bleached by corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n3. _Silver Test._--This is the most successful of the vapour tests,\r\na single apple pip yielding all the reactions. If a watch-glass\r\ncontaining a few drops of nitrate of silver solution be suspended in\r\na beaker (as in 2), the silver solution will become white and opaque,\r\nfrom the formation of cyanide of silver; examined under the microscope\r\nit is seen to consist of small prismatic crystals. The cyanide as\r\nformed, treated with hydrochloric acid, liquor potassæ, and sulphate of\r\niron, will give Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n_The Quantitative Analysis._--Use the precipitate of cyanide of silver,\r\n100 grains being equal to 20.33 of pure anhydrous acid.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment of poisoning by prussic acid is now to be\r\nconsidered. As part of the general treatment, the stomach pump should\r\nbe at once employed, and the stomach emptied and then washed out with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia._--The use of this substance was first advocated by Mr. John\r\nMurray of London, and is no doubt a valuable remedy if given early.\r\nCare should be taken that the mucous membrane of the air passages and\r\nalimentary canal be not inflamed by using too strong a solution.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine._--Recommended by Riauz in 1822. Water impregnated with the\r\nvapour of chlorine may be given internally, and the gas may be breathed\r\nunder proper precautions.\r\n\r\n_Cold Affusion._--First proposed by Dr. Herbst of Göttingen. Its\r\nsuccess is most to be looked for when it is employed before the\r\nconvulsive stage of the poisoning is over. The cold water should be\r\npoured on the head and down the spine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of cyanide of\r\nsilver obtained by the vapour test, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Bleeding from the Jugular Vein._--In one case treated by Magendie,\r\nbleeding from the jugular vein was attended with success.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Antidotes._--The administration of a solution of carbonate\r\nof potash, followed by a solution of the mixed sulphates of iron, has\r\nbeen suggested. The formation of Prussian blue is the result. The\r\nonly objection to this treatment is, that prussic acid is so rapidly\r\nabsorbed that death may result from the already absorbed acid before\r\nthe antidote can be given.\r\n\r\n_Atropine._--This should be given hypodermically.\r\n\r\n_Peroxide of hydrogen_ should be given freely by means of the stomach\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n_Cobalt_ nitrate 0.5 to 1 per cent. solution has been advocated\r\nhypodermically.\r\n\r\n_Sodium thiosulphate_, in 10 per cent. solution, repeated\r\nhypodermically.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyanide of Potassium\r\n\r\nThis substance is used largely by photographers and electro-platers.\r\nIt acts as a poison in a similar manner to hydrocyanic acid, and the\r\nsymptoms are the same. As a commercial preparation it frequently\r\ncontains undecomposed potassium carbonate, and may exert a corrosive\r\naction on the mucous membranes of the mouth and stomach, leading to the\r\nproduction of blood-stained mucus in the stomach.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These are the same as those described under\r\nhydrocyanic acid, with the addition of the corrosive effects.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Five grains have proved fatal in a quarter of an hour;\r\nrecovery has taken place after forty grains.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Same as for hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS CONTAINING HYDROCYANIC ACID\r\n\r\nThe following plants contain prussic acid, and are therefore more or\r\nless poisonous in proportion to the quantity of the acid which they\r\nseverally contain:\r\n\r\nNat. Ord. Rosaceæ\r\n\r\n    _Amygdalus Communis._--The Almond and its varieties.\r\n    _Prunus Domestica._--The Plum and its varieties.\r\n    _Cerasus._--The Cherry and its varieties.\r\n    _Pyrus Aria_, or White Bean Tree.--The seeds are poisonous.\r\n\r\nNat. Ord. Euphorbiaceæ\r\n\r\n_Jatropha Manihot_, or Bitter Cassava.\r\n\r\n\r\nBitter Almonds\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of bitter almonds is very poisonous. “The oil does\r\nnot, like common essential oils, exist ready formed in the almond,\r\nbut it is only produced when the almond pulp comes in contact with\r\nwater. It cannot be separated by any process whatever from the almond\r\nwithout the co-operation of water--neither, for example, by pressing\r\nout the fixed oil, nor by the action of ether, nor by the action of\r\nabsolute alcohol. After the almond is exhausted by ether, the remaining\r\npulp gives the essential oil as soon as it is moistened; but if it is\r\nalso exhausted by alcohol, the essential oil is entirely lost. The\r\nreason is, that alcohol dissolves out a peculiar crystalline principle\r\nnamed _Amygdalin_, which, with the co-operation of water, forms the\r\nessential oil by reacting on a variety of the albuminous principle in\r\nthe almond, called _Emulsin_, or _Synaptase_.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of bitter almonds may contain from 6.0 to 14.33 per\r\ncent. of hydrocyanic acid. Deaths from the incautious use of this oil\r\nfor flavouring articles of confectionery are not infrequent. As the\r\nflavour is not in the least injured, it has been suggested to subject\r\nthe oil to repeated distillation with caustic potassæ, by which means\r\nthe oil is purified from prussic acid.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._--Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhœa, due to gastric\r\nirritation, have occurred when the dose has been small, as is the case\r\nwhen confectionery owes its flavour to the use of the essential oil.\r\nIdiosyncrasy may have something to do with these effects, for cases\r\nare on record where a single almond has produced a state resembling\r\nintoxication, followed by an eruption not unlike urticaria or\r\nnettle-rash. Taken in large doses, the symptoms produced are identical\r\nwith those described under poisoning by prussic acid. The breath is\r\nusually strongly impregnated with the odour of bitter almonds.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Animals._--Vomiting, trembling, weakness, paralysis,\r\ntetanic convulsions, and coma.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These are identical with those seen in\r\npoisoning by the pure acid.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--The essential oil is from four to eight times as strong\r\nas the acid of the Pharmacopœia. From twenty to thirty drops have\r\nproved fatal. Death may take place in half an hour or less.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as that recommended under prussic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry-Laurel\r\n\r\nThe cherry-laurel, _Prunus Laurocerasus_--the leaves of which have\r\nbeen used for flavouring custards, &c.--contains prussic acid, and is\r\ntherefore poisonous.\r\n\r\nIn the British Pharmacopœia there is an _Aqua Laurocerasi_--laurel\r\nwater--prepared from the leaves. It contains 0.1 per cent. of\r\nhydrocyanic acid. It should be used with extreme caution, as the amount\r\nof hydrocyanic acid contained in the leaves is uncertain. Death has\r\nfrequently resulted from its use. The most important case, however, is\r\nthat of Sir T. Broughton. His mother, who gave him his usual draught\r\non the morning of his death, observed that it had a strong smell of\r\nbitter almonds. Two minutes after he took it she observed a rattling\r\nor gurgling in his stomach; in ten minutes more he seemed inclined to\r\ndoze; and five minutes afterwards she found him quite insensible, with\r\nthe eyes fixed upwards, the teeth locked, froth running out of his\r\nmouth, and a great heaving at his stomach, and gurgling in his throat.\r\nHe died within half an hour after swallowing the draught. No light was\r\nthrown on the case by the carelessly conducted _post-mortem_; but the\r\nsuddenness of his death, the improbability of apoplexy occurring at so\r\nearly an age, and the odour of bitter almonds observed by his mother,\r\npointed out clearly enough the true cause of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITE\r\n\r\nAll parts of this plant, the _Aconitum Napellus_ (_N.O. Ranunculaceæ_),\r\nare poisonous. The poisonous properties depend upon the presence of an\r\nalkaloid--_aconitine_--chiefly found in the root.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by the alkaloid came before the public mind in the case of\r\nDr. Lamson, executed for the murder of his brother-in-law. The symptoms\r\nnoticed in that case were very much as detailed below. When any part\r\nof the plant is chewed, a sensation of tingling is experienced in the\r\nmouth, and burning in the throat. Many of the aconites are, however,\r\ninert. The root, having been taken by mistake for horse-radish, has led\r\nto several cases of accidental poisoning.\r\n\r\n    -------------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n                      Aconite            |          Horse-Radish\r\n    -------------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n      _General Characteristics._--       |  _General Characteristics._--\r\n     Root conical; dark brown externally,| Root cylindrical, of nearly\r\n     and with numerous twisted rootlets; | the same thickness down its\r\n     internally, the colour is whitish.  | whole length.

He then complains of\r\nnausea, vomiting, pain in the epigastrium, and distressing dyspnœa,\r\nof a sensation of formication or tingling, with numbness in his face\r\nand limbs, which appear to him heavy and enlarged. In attempting to\r\nwalk he staggers, his limbs losing their power of supporting his\r\nbody. He becomes giddy, his pupils dilated, and his sight and hearing\r\nimperfect; but he is seldom unconscious till near death. His pulse\r\nirregular, gradually becomes weaker, and at last almost imperceptible;\r\nhis skin cold and clammy; his features pale and bloodless; and his mind\r\nclear: then suddenly he dies, in some cases from shock, in others from\r\nasphyxia; or he may die from syncope, especially after some exertion.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Animals._--Weakness of the limbs and staggering, the\r\nrespiration slow and laboured, loss of sensation, paralysis, dimness of\r\nvision, increasing difficulty in breathing, _convulsions_, and death by\r\n_asphyxia_.\r\n\r\nDelirium is present in some cases, and dilatation of the pupil has also\r\nbeen noticed. In a case recorded in the _British Medical Journal_,\r\n1877, vol. i. p. 258, two ounces of the tincture of aconite were drunk\r\nin mistake for _Succus Limonis_; recovery took place, but not before\r\nalarming symptoms had taken place, and death at one time appeared\r\nimminent.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--General venous congestion. The brain and\r\nits membranes are, in most cases, found congested and the stomach and\r\nintestines inflamed.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--The symptoms may come on immediately, or may be\r\ndelayed for an hour or two. In the case mentioned in the _British\r\nMedical Journal_ the patient walked about five miles after swallowing\r\ntwo ounces of the tincture, which he drank at 11 o‘clock, returning\r\nhome at 2.30 P.M. An excise officer, who died in about four hours, was\r\nable to walk from the Custom House over London Bridge. Death has taken\r\nplace in so short a time as one hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--About two grains of the extract, and one drachm of the\r\ntincture. Much will depend upon the amount of the alkaloid present. One\r\ndrachm of the scraped root is said to have proved fatal. One-fifteenth\r\nof a grain of aconitine has proved fatal.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis and Tests._--The alkaloid must be isolated from the\r\ncontents of the stomach by the process of Stas. The physiological test\r\nconsists in placing a small portion of the extract, or the alkaloid so\r\nobtained, on the tongue or lip, and noting if tingling be produced.\r\nTo the pure alkaloid, nitric acid added produces no change of colour.\r\nOfficinal phosphoric acid added, and the mixture carefully evaporated,\r\na violet colour is produced; this reaction is due to impurities in the\r\naconitine.\r\n\r\n_Kundrat‘s Test._--A solution of ammonium vanadate in strong sulphuric\r\nacid produces a coffee colour with aconitine.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Emetics, stomach lavage, castor-oil, and animal charcoal\r\nshould be given. The administration of digitalis in aconite poisoning\r\nhas been attended with good results. (See _British Medical Journal_,\r\n11th December 1872.) The drug may be given hypodermically as an\r\nantidote. Stimulants will be required; and friction down the spine,\r\ntogether with galvanism and artificial respiration, may be tried.\r\n\r\n=Synopsis of the Action of Aconite=\r\n\r\n1. _On Nervous System._--Giddiness, numbness, and tingling in the limbs\r\nis a primary effect, followed by gradually increasing paralysis of the\r\nmuscles, and insensibility of the surface of the body to pinching and\r\npricking. Dr. Fleming asserts that it produces a _powerful sedative\r\neffect on the nervous system_. At any rate, it now seems to be proved\r\nthat aconite paralyses the sensory nerves, commencing at their\r\nperipheral endings.\r\n\r\n2. _On Vascular System._--Extreme depression of the circulation is\r\nproduced by doses large enough to cause death. The pulse may become\r\nimperceptible at the wrist. In medicinal doses, aconite lowers the\r\nheart‘s action; in poisonous doses, it causes fatal syncope.\r\n\r\n3. _On Digestive System._--Some have denied the irritant action of\r\naconite on the alimentary canal, but Sir R. Christison states that he\r\nwas deterred from the use of aconite “by two patients being attacked\r\nwith severe vomiting, griping, and diarrhœa.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symptom most characteristic of these poisons is the marked\r\nanæsthesia which they produce when their vapours are inhaled. The\r\nhydrate of chloral, though placed under the above heading, is more\r\nclosely allied in its action to opium than to ether or chloroform.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHER\r\n\r\nEther, when taken in its liquid form, produces symptoms and\r\n_post-mortem_ appearances not unlike those caused by alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--No death having been recorded, the fatal dose of this\r\nsubstance is unknown.\r\n\r\n=Ether Vapour.=--The vapour of ether has caused death. Entering the\r\nblood through the lungs, it acts with great rapidity, a state of\r\nlethargy being quickly induced.\r\n\r\nThe early symptoms are noticed in a modification of respiration, the\r\nbreathing becoming slow, prolonged, and stertorous. The face is pale,\r\nthe lips bluish, and the surface of the body cold and exsanguine. The\r\npulse, at first quickened, becomes slower, as the inhalation of the\r\nvapour is continued. The pupils are dilated, and the eyes glassy and\r\nfixed. The voluntary muscles of the body become flabby and relaxed,\r\nthe patient still, however, having the power to move the limbs. The\r\ninvoluntary muscles are not affected; as an instance, the uterus\r\ncontracts and expels its contents with ease. If the inhalation of\r\nthe vapour be pushed too far, the pulse sinks, and coma ensues, from\r\nwhich the patient can only with difficulty be aroused; but if in an\r\nearly stage the ether be discontinued, the patient quickly regains\r\nconsciousness, due to the rapid elimination of the ether by the\r\nlungs. A marked peculiarity in this form of poisoning is the complete\r\nanæsthesia or paralysis of the nerves of sensation.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These are chiefly found in the brain and\r\nlungs, which in most cases are greatly congested. The cavities of the\r\nheart have been found full of dark-coloured liquid blood. A marked\r\neffect noticed in poisoning by ether is the congestion of the vessels\r\nof the upper portion of the spinal cord. The liver, kidneys, and spleen\r\nare sometimes congested.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The contents of the stomach and tissues must be\r\ntreated and distilled, as described under alcohol.\r\n\r\n    _Tests_:\r\n\r\n    1. The vapour passed into a solution of bichromate of\r\n       potash, and sulphuric acid added, gives the reactions of\r\n       alcohol.\r\n    2. The vapour burns with a smoky flame, depositing carbon on\r\n       any cool surface placed above the flame.\r\n    3. It is but sparingly soluble in water, on which liquid it\r\n       floats.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the pulse becomes weak, and the breathing laboured\r\nand stertorous, the inhalation should be discontinued, and cold water\r\ndashed in the face--free ventilation being also allowed. Galvanism and\r\nartificial respiration should also be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by chloroform when swallowed are not unlike those\r\noccasioned by alcohol. Four ounces have been taken without causing\r\ndeath; it is, therefore, not an active poison in this form.\r\n\r\n=Chloroform Vapour.=--The symptoms occasioned by chloroform when\r\ninhaled are not unlike those caused by ether, with this exception, that\r\ninsensibility and general relaxation of the muscles are more rapidly\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of poisoning when chloroform is taken by the\r\nmouth are similar to those following inhalation, with irritation of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. Vomiting generally\r\noccurs, the person becomes unconscious and comatose, the face cyanosed\r\nand the skin moist. The pupils are dilated and insensitive to light.\r\nThe breathing is slow and stertorous, the pulse small and feeble.\r\nDeath is due to respiratory paralysis first, and paralysis of the\r\nheart in addition, or the latter, according to some observers, may be\r\nthe primary cause. On recovery diarrhœa may follow, with occasionally\r\nenlargement of the liver and jaundice.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the vessels of the brain, and\r\nalso of the lungs, is generally found. The cavities of the heart are\r\nusually empty; but, in some cases, the right side of the heart is found\r\ndistended with dark-coloured fluid blood. Congestion of the spleen,\r\nliver, and kidneys is not of infrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period and Dose._--In one or two cases where the vapour was\r\ninhaled, death took place in from one to two minutes. Thirty drops thus\r\ntaken destroyed life in one minute, and even fifteen drops have proved\r\nspeedily fatal. It has thus destroyed life in a smaller dose, and\r\nmore rapidly, than any other known poison. When swallowed, one fluid\r\ndrachm has proved fatal in a boy, about four fluid drachms in an adult.\r\nRecovery has taken place after four fluid ounces. Three hours is the\r\nshortest fatal period after swallowing chloroform.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--In searching for the presence of this substance\r\nin the blood or tissues, the examination should be made as speedily as\r\npossible, as chloroform is thought by some observers to have a great\r\ntendency to pass into formic acid, and thus to escape recognition.\r\n\r\n1. The substance to be examined should be placed in a flask, to which\r\nis adapted a glass tube bent at right angles. A piece of blue litmus\r\npaper, and another portion of paper moistened with iodide of potassium\r\nand starch paste, are inserted into the end of the glass tube. The\r\nflask and its contents should now be placed in a water bath heated to a\r\ntemperature of 161° F. (72° C.), and a portion of the glass tube just\r\npast the bend heated to redness. Any chloroform vapour evolved from\r\nthe contents of the flask is decomposed during its passage through\r\nthe heated glass tube into free chlorine and hydrochloric acid, the\r\npresence of the former being indicated by the starch paper becoming\r\nblue; while at the same time the reddening of the litmus paper reveals\r\nthe presence of the acid. As a further corroboration, the exit tube may\r\nbe made to dip into nitrate of silver solution, when a precipitate of\r\nthe curdy-white chloride of silver will take place, insoluble in nitric\r\nacid, but dissolving on the addition of ammonia. Every 100 parts of\r\nchloride of silver formed, equals 27.758 of chloroform. By this process\r\nchloroform has been detected four weeks after death in putrid organs.\r\n\r\n2. Chloroform may be separated from organic mixtures by distillation.\r\nIf aniline and alcoholic solution of potash be added to chloroform and\r\nheated, the peculiar odour of phenyl-isocyanide is given off.\r\n\r\n3. A solution of β-naphthol dissolved in caustic potash, when added to\r\nchloroform and heated, gives a blue colour.\r\n\r\n4. Chloroform reduces Fehling‘s solution.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same as recommended with regard to ether. M. Nelaton\r\nrecommends inversion of the body, and ascribes the recovery of one\r\npatient to his suddenly lifting him up and throwing him over his\r\nshoulder with his head hanging down.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON BISULPHIDE\r\n\r\nThis substance is largely used in certain industries, as it dissolves\r\noils, fats, caoutchouc, gutta percha, &c. It is very inflammable,\r\nburns with a blue flame, evolving sulphur dioxide. The odour, when\r\nthis substance is impure, is very disagreeable. If taken internally,\r\nit produces an intense burning sensation in the throat, headache, and\r\ngiddiness. In chronic poisoning from the vapour in manufactories where\r\nit is used, there appear to be two stages--one of excitement, and\r\none of depression. In the former, there are more or less persistent\r\nheadache, irritability of temper, tinnitus aurium, and even mania;\r\nin the latter, anæsthesia of the skin, even affecting the mucous\r\nmembranes, patients complaining that their tongues feel as if tied in\r\na cloth. Paralysis of the limbs has been noted in prolonged cases of\r\nchronic poisoning. The _post-mortem_ appearances do not differ much\r\nfrom those found after death from the inhalation of chloroform. Carbon\r\nbisulphide may be separated from organic liquids by distillation, and\r\ndetected by its odour, and by a black precipitate of sulphide of lead\r\nwhen heated with nitrate of lead and potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORAL HYDRATE\r\n\r\nThis substance is prepared by acting on alcohol by chlorine. It is used\r\nextensively as a hypnotic, and, owing to its indiscriminate use, many\r\nfatal cases have been recorded. Care should be taken when large doses\r\nare given not to repeat them too quickly, as there appears to be a\r\ntendency to accumulation, and sudden and dangerous action of the drug.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Chloral, in moderate doses, acts on the brain as a\r\npowerful hypnotic, the early symptoms being gradual drowsiness,\r\nfollowed by deep sleep. With a dose of about 30 grains, the patient\r\ncan, however, by walking about, ward off sleep. In large doses the\r\nnarcosis becomes completely uncontrollable, and the poison then acts\r\nas a depressant to the basal ganglia of the brain, and on the spinal\r\ncord; and, as a result, there is weakness of the heart‘s action, with\r\nultimate diastolic arrest, slowing of the respiratory movements,\r\nand general muscular weakness, with some anæsthesia. Under these\r\ncircumstances the patient has all the appearance of a drunken person,\r\nthe face is flushed, and the deep sleep may pass imperceptibly into\r\ndeath without any marked change. In some cases delirium precedes the\r\ncondition of sleep. The pulse in some cases is quickened, and the\r\nface flushed; but, in other cases, the pulse becomes slow and almost\r\nimperceptible, the heart being ultimately arrested in diastole. In\r\nthese cases the face is pale, and the breathing performed at long\r\nintervals. The motor paralysis present, when a poisonous dose is\r\ntaken, is due to the action of the drug on the spinal cord, and not\r\non the nerves. During the sleep produced by chloral, the pupils are\r\ncontracted, but dilate on the person awakening. In a case described by\r\nDr. Levinstein, and reported in the _Lancet_, 21st February 1874, the\r\npatient took six drachms with intent to commit suicide. The face was\r\nat first flushed, the veins swollen, and the pulse 160 per minute; he\r\nthen became livid, the pupils contracted, and at times the circulation\r\nappeared to be entirely arrested. The temperature varied from 32.9°\r\nC. to 38.7° C. (89.6° F. to 100.4° F.). This case recovered under\r\ntreatment by the subcutaneous injections of strychnine (.03 to .04\r\ngrain), and the use of faradisation in thirty-two hours after the\r\npoison had been taken. Chronic chloral poisoning, “chloral-drinking,”\r\nhas unfortunately become far too common of late years, in which the\r\nmental faculties suffer severely, so that in our asylums, cases of\r\nmania and melancholia are rightly (or wrongly) attributed to the habit.\r\nA peculiar eruption, not unlike that produced by shell-fish, and\r\nfollowed by desquamation, sometimes occurs when this substance has been\r\ngiven for some time in medicinal doses.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--These are not unlike those of asphyxia, the\r\nvessels of the brain being engorged, and the ventricles containing an\r\nabnormal quantity of fluid. The mucous membrane of the larynx may be\r\ninjected, and in some cases œdematous. The right side of the heart is\r\nengorged and the left empty, together with congestion of the lungs.\r\nChloral is very little decomposed into chloroform by the blood. W. H.\r\nRoberts has in several cases recovered it as chloral from the blood.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--The fatal dose cannot be accurately stated, but\r\nchildren, as in the case of belladonna, are said to bear the drug\r\nbetter than adults. A child a year old died in ten hours from a dose of\r\nthree grains. Ten grains proved fatal to an old lady seventy years of\r\nage. Twenty grains has caused death in an adult in half an hour, and in\r\none case thirty grains. As a rule, any quantity over two drachms may\r\nbe considered a dangerous, if not a fatal dose, although recovery has\r\nbeen stated to have occurred after one ounce. Dr. Richardson considers\r\n120 grains, distributed over twenty-four hours, as a safe dose for an\r\nadult. Death may take place suddenly, or after the lapse of several\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--From fifteen minutes, which is the shortest time on\r\nrecord, to thirty-nine and a half hours, which is the longest period\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Chloral may be extracted from the stomach\r\ncontents by digestion with absolute alcohol acidified by sulphuric\r\nacid. The alcoholic extract is filtered and evaporated. The residue is\r\ntreated with petroleum ether to remove fatty substances, and finally\r\nshaken with pure ether to remove the chloral. On evaporating the ether\r\nthe chloral hydrate is left. From urine it may be extracted by first\r\nacidifying with sulphuric acid and then treating it with petroleum\r\nether and ether. Chloral hydrate in solution gives the following\r\nreactions:--\r\n\r\n1. On agitation with solution of caustic potash, and gently warmed if\r\nnecessary, chloroform is evolved, which can be detected by its odour.\r\nFrom a strong solution the chloroform may separate in the form of\r\nminute globules.\r\n\r\n2. If one drop of ammonium sulphide be added to a solution of chloral\r\nhydrate and gently heated, a peculiar opalescent milky reddish-yellow\r\nprecipitate forms. This test is extremely delicate, and differentiates\r\nchloral hydrate from chloroform.\r\n\r\n3. Alcoholic solution of potash and aniline when added to chloral\r\nhydrate solution, shaken up and warmed, produces the peculiar odour of\r\nphenyl-isocyanide. This is due to the formation of chloroform on the\r\naddition of the caustic potash.\r\n\r\n4. If β-naphthol dissolved in caustic potash solution be added to a\r\nsolution of chloral hydrate and the mixture warmed, a blue colour is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n5. Chloral hydrate reduces Fehling‘s solution.\r\n\r\nTo separate chloroform in the stomach contents from chloral hydrate\r\nthey should be acidified with tartaric acid and distilled, when\r\nthe chloroform which was free in the stomach will pass over to the\r\nreceiver. If the residue be now rendered alkaline with caustic potash\r\nand again distilled, any chloroform which then comes over must have\r\nbeen derived from chloral hydrate in the stomach contents.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment consists in washing out the stomach, the\r\nadministration of emetics, or hypodermic injection of apomorphine,\r\nin the use of galvanism, friction, mustard-plasters to the calves of\r\nthe legs, artificial respiration, and the hypodermic injection of a\r\nsolution of nitrate of strychnia or injection of atropine. The warmth\r\nof the body must be carefully maintained in all cases by suitable\r\nexternal applications. Oxygen inhalations are said to be beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHONAL\r\n\r\nSulphonal is a product of the oxidation of mercaptol, obtained from\r\nacetone and mercaptan; it occurs in tasteless, odourless, colourless\r\ncrystals or powder, was introduced into medical practice in 1888, and\r\nhas since caused many accidental deaths. The habit of taking it may\r\nbe acquired. It has a tendency to accumulative action when taken for\r\nsome time without interruption. A serious feature in most of the cases\r\nof poisoning is that usually those taking it have been apparently\r\nbenefited by the drug up to the time of the appearance of toxic\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In medicinal doses (15-30 grains) it has an action\r\nsimilar to that of paraldehyde, it causes sleep with little depression\r\nof the circulation and respiration. Larger doses produce variable\r\nsymptoms, mental confusion with nervous ataxic manifestations, stupor,\r\nand insensibility; less frequently excitement and convulsions. Skin\r\neruptions may follow a large dose or from its long continued use. In\r\nsevere cases there is marked cyanosis, feeble pulse, and stertorous\r\nand irregular breathing. Death usually results from failure of\r\nrespiration, or the urine may be suppressed and fatal coma supervene.\r\nAlbuminuria and hæmatoporphyrinuria are common features, especially\r\nin chronic cases. The deep pink colour of the urine was attributed to\r\nhæmatoporphyrin, and indicating extensive destruction of the red blood\r\ncorpuscles. It is a grave symptom. That the colour of the urine is due\r\nto hæmatoporphyrin is questionable, for on removing the hæmatoporphyrin\r\nthe colour remains the same. The cumulative action is due to slow\r\nelimination by the kidneys. A case published by Drs. Taylor and Sailer,\r\nand reported in the _Lancet_, February 1900, was that of a woman aged\r\nfifty-two years, unmarried, and presenting symptoms of hysteria. On\r\ninquiry it was discovered that she had been in the habit of taking\r\nsulphonal for some time, the dose being fifteen grains per diem.\r\nShe was informed of the evil results likely to follow the continued\r\nuse of the drug, and she discontinued its use for some weeks. After\r\nthis she resumed taking the drug, and began speedily to exhibit all\r\nthe symptoms of sulphonal poisoning: viz. mental confusion, marked\r\ninsomnia, difficulty of speech, and a peculiar sighing dyspnœa. The\r\nurine was tinged a deep pink colour (hæmatoporphyrinuria), and a\r\nstiffness and paralysis of both legs soon developed. The control of\r\nthe sphincters was lost. Cutaneous sensibility was not affected. The\r\nparalysis spread rapidly upwards, and death resulted from cardiac\r\nfailure. Spectroscopic examination of both urine and blood disclosed\r\nthe presence of hæmatoporphyrin. At the necropsy the following\r\nconditions were revealed: fatty degeneration was present in the heart,\r\nliver, and kidneys. The spleen was filled with a greenish pigment, both\r\nfree and within the lymphoid corpuscles, the fibrous trabeculæ were\r\ngreatly increased in size, and the lymphoid follicles were extremely\r\nwell developed. Excessive pigmentation was found also in the lymphatic\r\nglands of the body and in the lungs. No morbid changes could be found\r\nin the spinal cord or brain.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--This is very uncertain, depending upon idiosyncrasy.\r\nThirty grains has caused death in a woman in forty hours, while a\r\ncase is reported in the _Lancet_, January 1904, of recovery after the\r\ntaking of 365 grains. In many cases death has followed the daily use of\r\nmoderate doses (10-20 grains) for several months.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--May occur in a few hours, or days, or after months;\r\nalso after the use of the drug has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Sulphonal is very stable, and is unaffected by\r\nboiling alkalies or by concentrated nitric or sulphuric acids. From\r\nits solution in concentrated sulphuric acid it may be recovered by\r\ndilution. It is easily recovered from the body after death, as its\r\nstability prevents its decomposition. It is isolated from organic\r\nmatter by treatment with alcohol, evaporation, and extraction of the\r\nresidue with hot water, evaporation and final extraction with ether.\r\n\r\n_Tests._--1. Heated in a test tube with powdered charcoal, sulphonal\r\nforms mercaptan, acetic acid, formic acid, and sulphur dioxide. The\r\noffensive odour of mercaptan may be noted, and the vapours will change\r\nblue litmus paper. Sulphur dioxide may be shown by its bleaching action\r\non a piece of filter paper moistened with blue starch iodide and\r\nsuspended in the mouth of the tube.\r\n\r\n2. When melted with potassium cyanide, sulphonal develops a mercaptan\r\nodour, and potassium sulphocyanate is formed at the same time. A\r\nblood-red colour is therefore produced on the addition of ferric\r\nchloride to a solution of the residue in water. Great care must be\r\nexercised in the carrying out of this test, as it is somewhat dangerous\r\nto the experimenter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach should be washed out in order to remove any\r\ndrug unabsorbed. Diuretics, purgatives, and general stimulants given,\r\nsuch as strychnine, hot coffee, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIONAL AND TETRONAL\r\n\r\nThese compounds are very similar in both their chemical and\r\nphysiological properties to sulphonal, but both have a bitter taste.\r\nBoth have caused fatal poisoning, the symptoms being very similar to\r\nthose caused by sulphonal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERONAL\r\n\r\nVeronal, a synthetic compound, is a white crystalline powder about four\r\ntimes as powerful as sulphonal, very slightly soluble in water, more\r\nsoluble in hot water, and in alkaline solutions, and absorption takes\r\nplace from the intestine.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In moderate doses it produces sleep without subsequent\r\ndepression, and does not affect temperature or respiration. In larger\r\ndoses it may cause erythema and constipation, with alternating\r\nsemi-coma and delirium. During the last few years fatal cases of\r\npoisoning have become rather frequent.\r\n\r\nDetails of a fatal case by Dr. Durrant reported in Taylor, p. 616, are,\r\nbriefly: A man aged thirty-three, a heavy drinker, to whom veronal\r\nhad been prescribed, in fifteen-grain doses, with chloral hydrate and\r\nbromide of ammonium, had gradually increased the dose from 15 to 30\r\ngrains, or even 60 grains. Five weeks before death he had taken 100\r\ngrains, and had recovered in three days. Nine hours after taking 120\r\ngrains of veronal with 20 grains of chloral and 40 grains of ammonium\r\nbromide he was found deeply comatose, with surface warm, respirations\r\n32, pulse 102, pupils dilated, corneæ insensitive, reflexes absent.\r\nNext day not so deeply comatose, he could be made to wince by slapping\r\nthe face, the pupils were still dilated, temperature 102° F., pulse\r\n110, reflexes still absent. Later he was still constipated, and the\r\nbreathing impeded by mucus. On the third day he spoke when roused;\r\nthe temperature, bowels, and pupils the same. With slight remission\r\nhe became worse, and on the fourth day, in a comatose condition,\r\nwith muscular flaccidity and absence of reflexes, temperature 104°\r\nF., respirations over 40, and the pulse 150, death took place.\r\n_Post-mortem._--Nothing was found except intense congestion of the\r\nlungs, liver, spleen, and brain, due, no doubt, to the asphyxial form\r\nof death. The mucous membrane of the alimentary canal was congested,\r\nbut otherwise normal.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Tests._--1. Heated dry with sodium carbonate, ammonia is\r\nevolved. If held in the mouth of the tube red litmus paper turns blue,\r\nturmeric paper brown.\r\n\r\n2. A saturated solution acidified with nitric acid gives a white\r\nprecipitate with Millon‘s reagent soluble in excess.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As for sulphonal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNEURAL POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIUM\r\n\r\nThe common or spotted hemlock, _Conium maculatum_ (_N. O.\r\nUmbelliferæ_), is indigenous. It must be distinguished from the\r\n_Myrrhis temulenta_, another indigenous, umbelliferous plant, which\r\nhas also a spotted stem, but which is covered with hairs--the stem of\r\nthe hemlock being smooth. Several cases of poisoning have occurred,\r\nhemlock having been mistaken for parsley, fennel, asparagus, and\r\nparsnip. The leaves of the plant have a peculiar mousy odour, which is\r\nintensified when they are rubbed in a mortar with some caustic potash.\r\nThe poisonous properties reside in an alkaloid, _conine_. The activity\r\nof the plant appears to depend upon the time of the year when it is\r\ngathered, being most powerful in May. The ready decomposition of the\r\nalkaloid by heat or age renders the extract of conium a very uncertain\r\npreparation, the conine being converted into an inert resinoid matter.\r\n\r\n_Conine_ the alkaloid is a colourless volatile oil, lighter than\r\nwater, with an odour of mice. It is strongly alkaline, soluble in\r\ndiluted acid, but its salts have not yet been crystallised. It has been\r\nsuggested that a ptomaine not unlike conine may be formed in the body\r\nby the combination of one molecule of butyric acid and one molecule of\r\nammonia with separation of water, thus:\r\n\r\n    Butyric Acid.    Ammonia.         Conine.\r\n        2C₄H₈O₂    +    NH₃ - 2H₂O  =  C₈H₁₅N\r\n\r\nConine is a deadly poison, killing all animals, death resulting from\r\nasphyxia. Neutralised with an acid, its activity is increased, and it\r\nbecomes more soluble in water. Almost instant death resulted in a dog\r\nfrom injecting two grains of conine, neutralised with hydrochloric\r\nacid, into the femoral vein.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._--The symptoms in some cases resemble those of\r\npoisoning with opium; in others, the patient complains of dryness and\r\nconstriction of the throat, and drowsiness. There is dilatation of the\r\npupil, with closure of the eyes or ptosis, and loss of power in the\r\nmuscles of the extremities, so that the patient falls on attempting to\r\nwalk. The paralysis does not appear to be due to any direct influence\r\nupon the muscles, but upon the motor nerves, and especially on their\r\nextreme peripheral ends, and in this differs from Calabar bean, which\r\nacts on the spinal cord. Gradual loss of power in the respiratory\r\nmuscles is the cause of death. Giddiness, coma, and convulsions were\r\nthe typical symptoms of two cases of accidental poisoning recorded by\r\nDr. Watson.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Animals._--“Palsy, first of the voluntary muscles, next of\r\nthe chest, lastly of the diaphragm--asphyxia, in short, from paralysis,\r\nwithout insensibility, and with slight occasional twitches only of the\r\nlimbs; and the heart was always found contracting vigorously for a long\r\ntime after death” (Christison).\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Congestion of the vessels of the brain and\r\nlungs. The blood is very fluid, and of a dark colour, the fluidity due\r\nprobably to the mode of death--slowly induced asphyxia. There may be\r\nsome redness of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--The symptoms may come on in from ten minutes to an\r\nhour, or more, after the poison has been taken. Death usually takes\r\nplace in about four hours.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Uncertain. Thirty grains of the extract carefully\r\nprepared killed a rabbit in five minutes. A single drop of conine\r\ndropped into the eye of a rabbit killed it in nine minutes.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--Conine may be extracted from organic mixture by\r\nthe general process for extracting alkaloids. The following tests may\r\nthen be applied:\r\n\r\n1. The odour of conine, when diluted with water, resembles that of\r\nmice. Harley states that a mixture of caustic potash with organic\r\nsubstances may evolve a similar odour even when conine is absent.\r\n\r\n2. On warming conine with sulphuric acid and potassium bichromate\r\nbutyric acid is produced, and can be recognised by its peculiar odour.\r\n\r\n3. If conine be added to a solution of alloxan a reddish-purple colour\r\nis produced in a few minutes, and white needle-shaped crystals form\r\non standing. These crystals if dissolved in caustic potash solution\r\nproduce a purple colour, and the odour of conine is given off.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Emetics, stomach pump, castor-oil, followed by ammonia\r\nand other diffusible stimulants. Artificial respiration should be\r\nresorted to and kept up for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALABAR BEAN\r\n\r\nA strong emulsion of Calabar bean, _Physostigma venenosum_ (_N.O.\r\nLeguminosæ_), is used on the West Coast of Africa as a test of\r\ninnocence in cases of suspected witchcraft. In 1864 some children in\r\nLiverpool were poisoned by eating some of these beans, which had been\r\nswept out of a ship from Africa on to a heap of rubbish. The poisonous\r\nalkaloid is physostigmine or eserine.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Vomiting, giddiness, irregular action of the heart. The\r\nmental faculties are unaffected. The eyes are bright and the pupils\r\n_contracted_; in which latter it differs most strikingly from atropine,\r\nhyoscyamine, and daturine, where dilatation of the pupil is the rule.\r\nThe late Sir R. Christison considered that its primary action is on\r\nthe heart, causing paralysis of that organ, and that the insensibility\r\nand coma are only secondary. Dr. Harley considers that it is not a\r\ncardiac, but a respiratory poison. Later experiments have shown that\r\nthe paralysis produced is due to the action of the drug on the spinal\r\ncord and not on the nerve trunks. It appears also that death is due to\r\na failure of the respiration, for the heart in animals has been found\r\nstill beating for one and a half hours after death. The contraction\r\nof the pupil, when locally applied, is probably brought about by its\r\nparalytic action on the peripheral sympathetic nerve fibres of the\r\niris; and it is stated that when very large doses of physostigmine are\r\ngiven, the pupils dilate, pointing to oculo-motor palsy. A few drops of\r\nthe extract placed in the eye cause powerful contraction of the pupil.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--Six beans produced death in a boy six years of age.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The alkaloid eserine should be extracted in the\r\nusual way, benzene being used as a solvent in the place of chloroform\r\nand ether.\r\n\r\nEserine gives the following chemical reactions:\r\n\r\n1. If an aqueous solution of the salt be boiled and then strong nitric\r\nacid added, the solution turns a yellowish-orange colour, changed to\r\nviolet on addition of caustic soda in excess; the violet is discharged\r\non acidulation, but returns on re-alkalising the solution.\r\n\r\n2. A solution of eserine in ammonia solution gives a blue residue on\r\nevaporation to dryness. Dilute acids produce a red-coloured solution\r\nwith it, which is fluorescent by reflected light.\r\n\r\n3. Bromine water produces a red turbid solution with eserine, which\r\nclears on heating.\r\n\r\n4. The physiological test--eserine solution instilled into the eye of\r\nan animal produces contraction of the pupil.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The stomach should be emptied and washed out by means of\r\nthe syphon tube, or emetics administered. One-fiftieth to one thirtieth\r\nof a grain of atropine sulphate should be administered hypodermically\r\nand repeated until the pupils dilate. The tincture of belladonna may\r\nbe given by the mouth. Stimulants should be given and artificial\r\nrespiration carried out if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEXCITOMOTORY POISONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    NUX VOMICA               STRYCHNINE\r\n\r\nSome of the most poisonous known plants belong to the genus _Strychnos_\r\n(_N.O. Loganiaceæ_).\r\n\r\nThe Java poison, Upas Tieuté, is a watery extract of _S. Tieuté_; the\r\nbasis of the poison used in Guiana, and known as Wourali, Ourari,\r\nUrari, or Curare, is the juice of _S. toxifera_. _S. nux vomica_,\r\nthe Koochla tree, produces the nux vomica seeds of commerce; and the\r\nbark of the tree has been accidentally substituted for cusparia, or\r\nangustura bark, hence it is known as _false angustura_ bark. The\r\nsubstitution is attended with considerable risk, on account of the\r\nstrychnine which the false bark contains. It may be known by its\r\nbeing quilled, externally covered with white lichenous spots, and the\r\ninternal surface becoming _blood-red_ when touched with nitric acid.\r\nThis reaction, which depends upon the presence of an alkaloid, brucine,\r\n_does not_ occur when true angustura bark is thus treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUX VOMICA\r\n\r\n_The Seeds of S. Nux Vomica_\r\n\r\nThe British Pharmacopœia contains an extract and a tincture. The\r\nalkaloid strychnine is the active principle of the seeds and other\r\nparts of the plant. Another alkaloid, brucine, is also found, and is\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and _post-mortem_ appearances and treatment will be\r\ndetailed under the head of strychnine. The brown powder of the seeds\r\nmay, in some cases, be seen adhering to the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNINE\r\n\r\nStrychnine is very slightly soluble in cold water to the extent of one\r\npart in 8300; in boiling water one part dissolves in about 2500. It is\r\nmore soluble in alcohol, and very soluble in chloroform or ether and\r\nchloroform mixed.\r\n\r\nIt has a bitter taste, so intense, that one part in 70,000 of water\r\ncan be detected by the taste. Strychnine is not easily decomposed--it\r\nresists the action of warm strong sulphuric acid, and is not altered by\r\nputrefactive processes when present in viscera. It has been discovered\r\nin the body 322 days after death in one case, 368 days in another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of strychnine\r\nsulphate from aqueous solution, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Photo-micrograph of crystal of strychnine\r\nsulphate from aqueous solution, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\nAllen detected strychnine in the residue of some viscera from a person\r\nwho had died of strychnine poisoning, and which he had kept in a jar\r\nfor six years. Richter found the alkaloid at the end of eleven years in\r\nputrid tissues which had been exposed to the air all that time in open\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Should the poison be in solution, the patient complains\r\nof a hot and intensely bitter taste during swallowing. The effects of\r\nthe poison depending to a great extent on the mode of administration,\r\nbecome manifest in from a few minutes to an hour or more after it\r\nis taken. The earliest symptoms are a feeling of suffocation and\r\ngreat difficulty of breathing. These come on suddenly, without any\r\npremonitory warnings. Twitching of the muscles rapidly pass into\r\ntetanic convulsions of nearly all the muscles of the body, which\r\nare simultaneously affected. The head after several jerks becomes\r\nstiffened; the neck rigid; the body curved forward, quite stiff, and\r\nresting on the back of the head and heels. The face is congested, and\r\nthe countenance expresses intense anxiety; the eyes staring, the mouth\r\nopen, and the lips livid. The throat is dry, the thirst great; but\r\nwhen an attempt is made to drink, the jaws are spasmodically closed,\r\nand a piece of the vessel may be bitten out. During the intervals of\r\nthe paroxysms the intellect is usually clear, and the patient appears\r\nconscious of his danger, frequently exclaiming, “I shall die!” He is\r\nalso conscious of the accession of the paroxysms, telling those around\r\nhim of their approach, and asking to be held. In the case of J. P.\r\nCook, poisoned by Palmer, those about him tried to raise him, but he\r\nwas so stiff that they found it impossible. He then said, “Turn me\r\nover,” which they did, and he died in a few minutes. Intense pain is\r\nfelt, due to the powerful contractions of the muscles. After the lapse\r\nof a minute or two, the spasms subside, a sudden lull takes place,\r\nduring which the patient feels exhausted and his skin is bathed in\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by strychnine, the jaws are slightly, if at all, affected,\r\ntrismus is a late symptom, and occurs only during a convulsive seizure.\r\n\r\nIn tetanus the result of disease, the locking of the jaws is an early\r\nand a marked symptom.\r\n\r\nAs death approaches the fits become more frequent, and the patient dies\r\nfrom exhaustion or suffocation.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--There is no characteristic appearance found\r\nafter death. The blood is fluid, the heart empty, with some congestion\r\nof the membranes of the brain. Absence of all cause for so violent and\r\nsudden a death. _Rigor mortis_ is prolonged for some time.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._--The rapidity in the accession of the symptoms and\r\nfatal termination will, to some extent, depend upon the form in which\r\nthe poison is taken--_i.e._ in solution or in pill. In most cases the\r\nsymptoms appear in from three or four minutes to an hour or more after\r\nthe poison is swallowed, death following in from ten minutes to six\r\nhours. As a rule, if the person lives for two hours after the onset of\r\nsymptoms recovery may be expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Photo-micrograph of strychnine sulphate, film\r\npreparation from chloroform solution, × 50. (R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Photo-micrograph of chromate of strychnine, ×\r\n50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose._--A quarter to half a grain; but large doses have been\r\ntaken, followed by recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Photo-micrograph of sulphocyanate of\r\nstrychnine, × 50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The poison may fail to be detected, and this\r\nlink in the scientific evidence may be wanting, as was the case in\r\nPalmer‘s trial. In that case the strychnine had been administered in\r\n_pills_; and when after death the stomach had been cut open, and the\r\ncontents lost, there was little hope of discovering the poison. The\r\nnon-discovery of the poison was made a strong point on the part of the\r\ndefence, ignoring at the same time the fact that the stomach had been\r\ntampered with and the contents spilt. The alkaloid abstracted from the\r\ntissues or contents of the stomach by the process generally used for\r\nextraction of alkaloids, may have the following tests applied to it:\r\n\r\n    1. Scarcely soluble in water, but readily soluble in\r\n    acidulated water.\r\n\r\n    2. Intensely bitter taste.\r\n\r\n    3. Not affected by sulphuric acid; but when a little\r\n    peroxide of lead, or peroxide of manganese, or bichromate\r\n    of potash, or ferricyanide or permanganate of potassium\r\n    is added, a magnificent purple-blue colour, changing to\r\n    crimson, and finally to a light red tint, is the result. The\r\n    ¹/₂₀₀₀₀ part of a grain of strychnine has been stated to\r\n    give this reaction.\r\n\r\n    4. The physiological test consists in introducing a small\r\n    quantity of the suspected substance under the skin of a\r\n    frog, and noting whether or not the animal suffers from\r\n    tetanic spasms.\r\n\r\n    5. _The Galvanic Test._--Place a solution of\r\n    strychnine, say one part of strychnine in 15,000 of water,\r\n    in a slight depression in a piece of platinum foil, and\r\n    allow the mixture to evaporate. When dry, moisten the spot\r\n    with sulphuric acid, connect the foil with a positive pole\r\n    of a single-cell Grove‘s battery, and then touch the acid\r\n    solution with the negative pole. A violet colour will be at\r\n    once produced, remaining permanent.\r\n\r\n    6. _Bloxam‘s Test._--To the solid alkaloid in a\r\n    porcelain dish a drop or two of strong nitric acid is added\r\n    and gently heated; on adding a small quantity of potassium\r\n    chlorate a scarlet colour is produced. Ammonia changes\r\n    this colour to brown and a brown precipitate falls. If the\r\n    mixture he evaporated to dryness it leaves a dark green\r\n    residue forming a green solution in water, changed to\r\n    orange-brown with caustic potash and green again with nitric\r\n    acid. This test distinguishes strychnine from any of the\r\n    alkaloids which commonly occur in cases of poisoning.\r\n\r\n    7. Potassium bichromate when added to a solution of a salt\r\n    of strychnine, produces a yellow crystalline precipitate\r\n    of chromate of strychnine: the reaction can be done on\r\n    a microscope slide and the crystals examined. On drying\r\n    the crystals and then touching them with a drop of strong\r\n    sulphuric acid, the purple colour changing through red to\r\n    green is produced.\r\n\r\n    8. Picric acid gives a yellow crystalline precipitate of the\r\n    picrate.\r\n\r\n    9. Ammonium or potassium sulphocyanate produces crystalline\r\n    precipitates.\r\n\r\n    10. Ferri-cyanide of potassium produces a crystalline\r\n    precipitate with solutions of salts of strychnine.\r\n\r\nStrychnine may not be found in the body, even after death from\r\npoisoning by it, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n    1. Smallness of the quantity taken.\r\n\r\n    2. The time which has elapsed after taking the strychnine\r\n       until the symptoms commence.\r\n\r\n    3. If the careful preservation of the stomach and its\r\n       contents has been overlooked.\r\n\r\n    4. The alkaloid may have been eliminated from the body\r\n       before death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Evacuation of the stomach by emetics and the stomach\r\npump, under anæsthesia, and then the administration of animal charcoal,\r\niodide of potash, tannic acid, and tea; bromide of potassium in large\r\ndoses (half an ounce), and repeated in smaller doses. Chloral should be\r\ngiven in five-grain doses hypodermically every ten minutes, until the\r\nconvulsions are subdued. Chloroform should be inhaled for some time.\r\nUrethane is said by Anrep to be more useful than chloral, and should be\r\ngiven in drachm doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUCINE\r\n\r\nThis alkaloid is present along with strychnine in Nux Vomica seeds\r\nand the Ignatius bean. Cases of poisoning by it seldom occur, as the\r\nalkaloid is but little known by the public.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It resembles strychnine in its action but is much\r\nless poisonous. It produces death by convulsions when injected\r\nsubcutaneously, but according to Brunton does not so often produce\r\nconvulsions when taken into the stomach.\r\n\r\n        Differential Diagnosis of Strychnine Poisoning from\r\n                Tetanus, Hysteria, Epilepsy, and other\r\n                   Poisons causing Tetanic Spasms.\r\n    +--------------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n    |            Tetanus.            |   Tetanus from Strychnine.   |\r\n    +--------------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n    | 1.

J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Photo-micrograph of crystals of brucine\r\nsulphate, × 50.\r\n\r\n(R. J. M. Buchanan.)]\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis._--The alkaloid may be extracted from organic\r\nadmixture by the usual methods. Its reactions to special tests are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. If nitric acid be added to the solid alkaloid, or in aqueous\r\nsolution, a bright red colour is produced which changes to yellow on\r\nheating. The addition of stannous chloride or sulphide of ammonium to\r\nthe acid solution after cooling changes it to violet; the colour is\r\ndischarged by excess of the stannous chloride. If the red acid solution\r\nbe largely diluted with water, a yellow precipitate falls, soluble in\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid. If the filtrate from the yellow precipitate\r\nbe neutralised by ammonia and calcium chloride added, a precipitate of\r\ncalcium oxalate forms, insoluble in acetic but soluble in hydrochloric\r\nacid. This reaction is peculiar to brucine.\r\n\r\n2. With sulphuric acid and potassium bichromate a deep orange-red\r\ncolour is produced.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphomolybdic acid gives an orange-red or purplish-red colour,\r\nchanging to blue.\r\n\r\n4. _Blyth‘s Test._--If methyl iodide be added to a solution of brucine\r\nin strong alcohol, circular rosettes of crystals form in a few minutes.\r\nStrychnine does not give this reaction.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Same as for strychnine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIRRESPIRABLE GASES\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON DIOXIDE\r\n\r\n_Circumstances under which it occurs accidentally._--Death may\r\nresult where several persons are sleeping in the same room, and the\r\nventilation is imperfect; from the admission of the vapour of charcoal\r\ninto a room from an adjoining vent; or from incautiously sleeping in a\r\nbrewery close to a vat in which fermentation is going on. Many deaths\r\nhave occurred from this gas, due to the incautious descent into wells.\r\nIt must also be borne in mind that death may result from the presence\r\nof this gas in an atmosphere which will permit the combustion of a\r\ncandle. For a candle will burn in an atmosphere containing 25 per cent.\r\nof CO₂, whereas 5 per cent. will cause death. The burning of a candle\r\nis therefore no test of security from danger in an atmosphere where\r\nthe presence of carbonic acid is suspected. Carbonic acid does not, as\r\nis generally supposed, sink to the lower portions of a room; and Dr.\r\nTaylor, from his experiments, states “that in a small and close room\r\npersons are liable to be suffocated at all levels, from the very equal\r\nand rapid diffusion of carbonic acid during combustion.”\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the carbonic acid is pure, that is, unmixed with\r\nother gases, spasm of the glottis at once occurs, and the sufferer\r\nfalls down insensible, and death is almost immediate. When the gas\r\nis diluted the early symptoms are a feeling of weight and fulness\r\nin the head, accompanied with giddiness, throbbing of the temporal\r\narteries, drowsiness, palpitation of the heart, gradually increasing\r\ninsensibility, stertorous breathing, ending in death from asphyxia or\r\napoplexy. Sometimes the victim dies convulsed, at other times a deep\r\nsleep quietly merges into death. The symptoms will, of course, depend\r\nupon the quantity and purity of the gas present in the apartment.\r\n\r\n_Action on the Animal Economy._--The opinions of observers vary\r\ngreatly--Berzelius maintaining that an atmosphere containing 5 per\r\ncent. was not injurious to life; Allen and Pepys, on the other hand,\r\nstating that 10 per cent. of the gas would cause death. Bernard\r\nconsiders that it is not poisonous, as it can be injected into the\r\nbodies of animals without injury, and that its action is purely\r\nnegative; it is irrespirable in the same sense as pure hydrogen or\r\nnitrogen is--simply, therefore, causing death by suffocation. Whatever\r\nmay be the true explanation of its action, it is enough for all\r\npractical purposes to know that death follows when it is breathed, even\r\nwhen mixed with a normal amount of oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--The face may be pale and composed, or\r\nswollen and livid. The vessels of the brain are frequently greatly\r\ncongested, and the heart and great vessels gorged with black fluid\r\nblood. The blood in some cases, however, is of a cherry-red colour.\r\nThis may probably be due to the presence of carbon monoxide, which\r\nappears to have the power of preventing the change of arterial into\r\nvenous blood, the opposite effect to that of carbon dioxide. The tongue\r\nmay or may not be protruded beyond the teeth; in most instances the\r\nlatter is the case. Animal heat is long retained after death, and the\r\n_rigor mortis_ occurs as in other forms of death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Bleeding from the arm, cupping from the nape of the neck,\r\nand the employment of cold affusion to the head. The patient should\r\nbe removed without delay into the open air. Artificial respiration\r\nand galvanism have been successfully employed in some cases, and\r\ninhalations of oxygen should be used if possible.\r\n\r\n_How the proportion of Carbon Dioxide may be estimated._--The air to\r\nbe examined is drawn into a vessel capable of holding one and a half\r\ngallons, to which is added a clear solution of lime or baryta. The\r\nvessel, after being well agitated, is allowed to remain untouched for\r\nfrom eight to twenty-four hours. The carbonic acid is absorbed by\r\nthe lime or baryta, and the difference in the causticity of the lime\r\nsolution before and after it is placed in the vessel gives the amount\r\nof carbonic acid present in the air. A simple method of collecting the\r\nair in a mine is by lowering a bottle full of fine sand, so arranged\r\nthat at any depth it may be turned upside down, and the sand allowed to\r\nrun out, its place being taken by the air of the mine. The bottle may\r\nnow be quickly drawn up, corked, and reserved for examination.\r\n\r\n_How may an Apartment, Well, or Mine be cleared of it?_--Free\r\nventilation in the first case. In the case of a well, a basket of\r\nslaked lime may be let down; but in mines a steam fanner or a jet of\r\nsteam must be blown through the mine. No one, of course, should be\r\nallowed to enter the well or mine until it has been cleared of the\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON MONOXIDE\r\n\r\nThis gas is formed in a variety of ways, one being the oxidation of\r\ncarbon at a very high temperature in a limited supply of oxygen. It\r\nis given off by iron stoves at a red heat. It is one of the chief\r\ningredients of the vapour of burning charcoal.\r\n\r\nTo this gas is due the suffocating quality of air in which coke or\r\ncharcoal is burnt. It is inodorous, hence the dangerous insidiousness\r\nwith which it produces its fatal results. It is said that 0.5 per cent.\r\nwill cause death, and even 0.1 per cent. is injurious. The vapours from\r\nbrick kilns and “burnt ballast” heaps are injurious to health, and the\r\nowners of them may be indicted for causing a nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe fumes from burning charcoal are taken advantage of for purposes of\r\nsuicide, a method frequently used on the Continent, but almost unheard\r\nof in England. The suicide generally shuts himself up in a room, which\r\nhe has closed against any ventilation, and in which he has placed a\r\nreceptacle containing burning coke or charcoal.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by carbon monoxide occurs in two forms--_acute_ and _chronic_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms_: _Acute._--The first symptoms may be those of excitation,\r\nwhich are quickly followed by intense headache, giddiness, throbbing of\r\nthe temples, and nausea followed by vomiting. Muscular weakness occurs,\r\nsensation and the reflexes are lost, drowsiness and coma follow, and\r\nin fatal cases convulsions often come on before death. The pulse\r\nbecomes imperceptible at the wrist. The conjunctivæ become hyperæmic,\r\nthe eyes staring, the pupils dilated and insensible. The voluntary and\r\ninvoluntary muscles are relaxed, the skin cold and cyanotic, and the\r\nlips covered with froth.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--The symptoms are headache, neuralgic pains, anæmia,\r\nshortness of breath, and wasting; when advanced they are those of\r\nperipheral neuritis and mental disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe less severe symptoms of chronic carbon monoxide poisoning are not\r\nuncommon, and occur in those who occupy small and badly ventilated\r\nrooms, in which there may be a heating stove, gas stove, or imperfect\r\ngas fittings; the last are especially dangerous when water gas is used\r\nfor illuminating purposes, as it contains a high percentage of carbon\r\nmonoxide.\r\n\r\nIt is a very powerful gas, speedily causing death by acting chiefly\r\non the nervous system, the symptoms being those produced by a pure\r\nnarcotic.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ signs are redness of the face, with reddish patches\r\non different parts of the body. The blood--and this is chiefly\r\ncharacteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning--is cherry-red, due to a\r\nchemical compound formed by the action of the gas on the colouring\r\nmatter of the blood, thus paralysing the oxygen-carrying power of the\r\nblood corpuscles. The gas is supposed to combine with the hæmoglobin\r\nforming a fixed compound, the spectroscopic examination showing the\r\ntwo absorption bands of the hæmoglobin nearer to the violet end of the\r\nspectrum than under normal conditions. (See Blood Spectra, p. 103.)\r\n\r\nThese bands resemble those of O₂Hb, so their position must be compared\r\nwith a spectrum of O₂Hb, the two spectra being side by side.\r\n\r\nThere is another important difference, however, determined by the\r\naction of a reducing agent such as ammonium sulphide. The bands of COHb\r\nare unaltered, while those of O₂Hb are reduced. Death frequently takes\r\nplace before all the Hb has been changed into COHb, so that the blood\r\ncontains a mixture of COHb and O₂Hb, and on the addition of a reducing\r\nagent the spectrum is a composite one of COHb and reduced Hb. Only the\r\nbroad band of reduced Hb is to be seen if the amount of COHb present be\r\nless than 28 per cent. In an atmosphere containing a large percentage\r\nof carbon monoxide death may occur before the blood contains sufficient\r\nCOHb to give the characteristic spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ consists in the removal of the sufferer into the\r\nfresh air, artificial respiration, venesection, and the transfusion of\r\narterialised defibrinated blood. Oxygen inhalations should be given. In\r\ntwo cases subcutaneous injections of nitro-glycerine were followed by\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER GAS\r\n\r\nThis gas is prepared by passing steam through incandescent carbon, and\r\nis a compound of nearly equal parts of carbonic oxide and hydrogen. It\r\nowes its dangerous properties to the first-named gas. When water gas,\r\npure and simple, is supplied for heating purposes, its leakage cannot\r\nbe detected, as the gas possesses no odour. When used for lighting and\r\ncarburetted, its escape is more readily detected by the smell, but\r\neven then it is more dangerous than coal gas as the proportion of CO\r\nis higher. Several deaths have resulted from the use of water gas for\r\nheating and lighting purposes, and also for steel smelting in Leeds.\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning are those of carbon monoxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHURETTED HYDROGEN\r\n\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen is a gas possessing a powerful odour of rotten\r\neggs. It is largely used as a test for most of the metals; and its\r\npresence may be detected by filter paper, moistened with a salt of\r\nlead, becoming black.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the gas is moderately diluted the symptoms produced\r\nare giddiness, throbbing of the temples, pain and oppression of the\r\nstomach, nausea, and vomiting; delirium and convulsions sometimes\r\noccur, together with laborious respiration and an irregular pulse. When\r\nthe gas is but slightly diluted, the person becomes suddenly weak and\r\ninsensible, and rapidly dies.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Fluidity and blackness of the blood, loss\r\nof muscular contractility, and a tendency to rapid putrefaction. The\r\nbronchial tubes are reddened, and the internal vascular organs may\r\nappear almost black.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This will consist in the immediate removal of the person\r\ninto fresh air, and the administration of stimulants, together with the\r\nrespiration of chlorine gas evolved from bleaching powder by the action\r\nof an acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL GAS\r\n\r\nCoal gas is composed of several hydrocarbons, the chief of which is\r\nmarsh gas, together with free hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon\r\ndioxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, and sulphides of carbon, which\r\ngive to it its peculiar odour. The poisonous properties of coal gas are\r\ndue to the carbon monoxide, 7.5 per cent. being present in ordinary\r\ngas as supplied for illuminating purposes. It can be detected by\r\npassing the coal gas through an acid solution of cuprous chloride,\r\nwhich becomes black by the formation of a compound CuCOCl. A dangerous\r\nexplosive compound is formed when the gas reaches the proportion\r\nof 1 in 10 of the atmosphere. Poisoning by this gas is, as a rule,\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Headache, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, ending in coma.\r\nStertorous breathing is noticed in some cases. Should the sufferer\r\nbe removed from the gas, the breath smells strongly of the gas. The\r\nmurderer Chantrelle tried to cover his crime by admitting gas into his\r\nwife‘s bedroom, but the attempt failed. The pupils are, as a rule,\r\ndilated before death.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Appearances._--Cherry-red colour of the blood, redness of\r\nthe pulmonary tissue, and froth in the air-passages. The vessels of the\r\nbrain are engorged, and rose-coloured patches appear on the thighs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This consists in removing the patient into the fresh air,\r\nartificial respiration, oxygen inhalations, &c., as in carbon monoxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBUSTION GASES\r\n\r\nToxic effects have been produced by inhalation of the gases caused by\r\nexplosives. The principal gases are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,\r\nand nitrogen. Gunpowder yields a considerable amount of CO and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Nitro-glycerine, dynamite, and gun-cotton yield\r\na large amount of CO. Tonite yields very little CO, and roburite none.\r\nSmokeless powders give off CO.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of “roburite” and “sicherheit,” which contain\r\ndinitro-benzine, is fraught with danger from this substance, causing,\r\nin acute cases, cyanosis of the face or the whole body, headache,\r\nvertigo, paresis, coldness, quick pulse, dyspnœa, shallow breathing\r\nwith long intervals, and coma. Vomiting may occur, and the blood\r\nbecomes a chocolate colour. A chronic form of poisoning produces\r\nlividity and cyanosis, with gastritis, hepatic enlargement and\r\njaundice, paræsthesia, numbness, and cramps in the muscles, amblyopia\r\nwith concentric contraction of vision-fields, and central scotoma.\r\nThe blood is like that of pernicious anæmia, and the urine brown or\r\nblackish.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETYLENE GAS\r\n\r\nThis gas has a peculiar odour of geranium. It is a product of the\r\nincomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, and is formed when lamps or gas\r\njets are burned with insufficient air, _e.g._ a Bunsen burner which\r\nhas “lighted back,” also from the use of oil stoves, and gas cooking\r\nand heating apparatus. It is used for illumination, and formed by\r\nthe action of water on calcium carbide. It forms a highly explosive\r\nmixture with air. It is not a potent poison. Continued exposure to\r\nit causes anæmia, malnutrition, and nervous symptoms. On animals it\r\nproduces narcosis. It does not combine with hæmoglobin, but acts as an\r\nindifferent gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN MONOXIDE, NITROUS OXIDE\r\n\r\nThis is known as laughing gas; it has a sweetish taste and smell.\r\nWhen breathed in small quantities it produces tingling sensations and\r\ninduces laughter, hence its name. When breathed for anæsthetic purposes\r\nthe skin becomes livid, the blood pressure raised, and unconsciousness\r\nfollows. It acts first upon the higher nerve centres, then upon the\r\nspinal cord, medulla, and heart. If pushed too far it causes death\r\nby asphyxia. In ordinary use for anæsthesia, the latter is rapidly\r\nproduced, and recovery follows quickly when the administration is\r\nstopped. It has peculiar effects upon certain people, who may not only\r\nshow the symptoms of hilarity, but, in some cases, become extremely\r\nviolent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROL FUMES\r\n\r\nPetrol fumes produce toxic effects upon those who breathe them,\r\ncomprising perverted taste, dysphagia, headache, giddiness, cyanosis,\r\ninsensibility, mania and imbecility. Maniacal outbreaks occur during\r\nrecovery. Peripheral neuritis may follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPHTHA, BENZOL OR BENZENE\r\n\r\nThis causes poisoning when swallowed or inhaled, _e.g._ glove cleaning,\r\nwaterproofing, &c. Death has taken place in either way.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In _acute_ poisoning there is excitement, flushing of the\r\nface, cyanosis, dilated pupils, headache, slow breathing, stupor and\r\ncoma, with gastro-intestinal irritation.\r\n\r\nHallucinations and delirium may occur amongst workers in it;\r\nidiosyncrasy plays a part. Women may become intoxicated, excited, and\r\nhysterical. It may cause headache, vertigo, narcosis, and inability to\r\nwalk, with vomiting. Small hæmorrhages may occur. Rapid coma and death\r\nmay occur when the vapour is concentrated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When swallowed, the stomach tube should be used and ether\r\nand strychnine given hypodermically. When overcome by vapour, removal\r\nto the open air, artificial respiration, oxygen inhalations, and\r\nrestoratives are required.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHUR DIOXIDE\r\n\r\nThis is an irrespirible gas with the odour of burning sulphur. It is a\r\npreservative and bleaching agent, is used for disinfection, and occurs\r\nin certain industries.\r\n\r\nThe inhalation of the fumes causes a feeling of suffocation, with spasm\r\nof the glottis, and irritation of the nose, trachea, and bronchi,\r\nproducing sneezing and cough; opacity of the cornea, dyspnœa, cyanosis,\r\nand convulsions may occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\n\r\nThe gas is used for disinfection and bleaching. In chemical works\r\nchronic poisoning may occur causing anæmia, emaciation, gastritis,\r\ndental caries, bronchitis, and emphysema. If concentrated, it causes\r\ndyspnœa, violent cough, hæmoptysis, stupor, and syncope.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Fresh air, steam inhalations, and the general treatment\r\nof the lung conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORETTED HYDROGEN\r\n\r\nThis is a very poisonous gas. Deaths have occurred on board ships\r\ncarrying cargoes of electrolytic ferrosilicate containing calcium\r\nphosphide. It reduces the oxyhæmoglobin. It may produce rapid, followed\r\nby slow and laboured breathing and convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abdomen, P.-M. exam., 58, 59;\r\n      enlargement of, 153;\r\n      in delivery, 156;\r\n      in pregnancy, 153;\r\n      in starvation, 132;\r\n      injuries of, 75\r\n    Abel, Prof., on arsenic, 284\r\n    Abercrombie, Dr., on apoplexy, 73\r\n    Abortion, criminal, 64, 76, 159 _et seq._;\r\n      causes of, 160, 161;\r\n      dangers of, 161;\r\n      definition of, 160, 164;\r\n      examination in, 162, 163;\r\n      in poisoning, 313, 317, 319, 322;\r\n      law of, 159;\r\n      R. _v._ Goodhall, 159\r\n    Abscess, in wounds, 84\r\n    Accident, death from, 2\r\n    Acetanilide (antifebrin), 363\r\n    Acetic acid, 262\r\n    Acetone, in starvation, 132\r\n    Acetylene gas, 401\r\n    Acid poisons, 231, 234, 246\r\n    Aconite and aconitine, 229, 234, 239, 348, 375, 376\r\n    Action (general) of poisons, 232-34\r\n    Acts of Parliament:--\r\n      _Arsenic Act_, 1851 (14 Vict. c. 13), 230, 275;\r\n      _Coroners Acts_, De Officio Coronatoris\r\n          (4 Edw.
