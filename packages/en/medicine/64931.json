Schiller, in his poem, “Die Weltweisen,” recognizes it with\r\nthe words:—\r\n\r\n                   “Einstweilen bis den Bau der Welt\r\n                   Philosophie zusammenhält,\r\n                   Erhält sie das Getriebe\r\n                   Durch Hunger und durch Liebe.”[1]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the sexual life has received but a very\r\nsubordinate consideration on the part of philosophers.\r\n\r\nSchopenhauer (“The World as Will and Idea”) thought it strange that love\r\nhad been thus far a subject for the poet alone, and that, with the\r\nexception of superficial treatment by Plato, Rousseau, and Kant, it had\r\nbeen foreign to philosophers.\r\n\r\nWhat Schopenhauer and, after him, the Philosopher of the Unconscious, E.\r\nv. Hartmann, philosophized concerning the sexual relations is so\r\nimperfect, and in its consequences so distasteful, that, aside from the\r\ntreatment in the works of Michelet (“L’amour”) and Mantegazza\r\n(“Physiology of Love”), which are to be considered more as brilliant\r\ndiscussions than as scientific treatises, the empirical psychology and\r\nmetaphysics of the sexual side of human existence rest upon a foundation\r\nwhich is scientifically almost puerile.\r\n\r\nThe poets may be better psychologists than the psychologists and\r\nphilosophers; but they are men of feeling rather than of understanding,\r\nand at least one-sided in their consideration of the subject. They\r\ncannot see the deep shadow behind the light and sunny warmth of that\r\nfrom which they draw their inspiration. The poetry of all times and\r\nnations would furnish inexhaustible material for a monograph on the\r\npsychology of love; but the great problem can be solved only with the\r\nhelp of Science, and especially with the aid of Medicine, which studies\r\nthe psychological subject at its anatomical and physiological source,\r\nand views it from all sides.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be possible for medical science to gain a stand-point of\r\nphilosophical knowledge midway between the despairing views of\r\nphilosophers like Schopenhauer and Hartmann[2] and the gay, _näive_\r\nviews of the poets.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of the author to lay the foundation of a\r\npsychology of the sexual life, though without doubt psychopathology\r\nwould furnish many important sources of knowledge to psychology.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this treatise is a description of the pathological\r\nmanifestations of the sexual life and an attempt to refer them to their\r\nunderlying conditions. The task is a difficult one, and, in spite of\r\nyears of experience as alienist and medical jurist, I am well aware that\r\nwhat I can offer must be incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject for the welfare of society, especially\r\nforensically, demands, however, that it should be examined\r\nscientifically. Only he who, as a medico-legal expert, has been in a\r\nposition where he has been compelled to pass judgment upon his\r\nfellow-men, where life, freedom, and honor were at stake, and realized\r\npainfully the incompleteness of our knowledge concerning the pathology\r\nof the sexual life, can fully understand the significance of an attempt\r\nto gain definite views concerning it.\r\n\r\nEven at the present time, in the domain of sexual criminality, the most\r\nerroneous opinions are expressed and the most unjust sentences\r\npronounced, influencing laws and public opinion.\r\n\r\nHe who makes the psychopathology of sexual life the object of scientific\r\nstudy sees himself placed on a dark side of human life and misery, in\r\nthe shadows of which the godlike creations of the poet become hideous\r\nmasks, and morals and æsthetics seem out of place in the “image of God.”\r\n\r\nIt is the sad province of Medicine, and especially of Psychiatry, to\r\nconstantly regard the reverse side of life,—human weakness and misery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this difficult calling some consolation may be gained, and\r\nextended to the moralist, if it be possible to refer to morbid\r\nconditions much that offends ethical and æsthetic feeling. Thus Medicine\r\nundertakes to save the honor of mankind before the Court of Morality,\r\nand individuals from judges and their fellow-men. The duty and right of\r\nmedical science in these studies belong to it by reason of the high aim\r\nof all human inquiry after truth.\r\n\r\nThe author would take to himself the words of Tardieu (“Des attentats\r\naux moeurs”): “Aucune misère physique ou morale, aucune plaie, quelque\r\ncorrompue qu’elle soit, ne doit effrayer celui qui s’est voué a la\r\nscience de l’homme et le ministère sacré du médecin, en l’obligeant à\r\ntout voir, lui permet aussi de tout dire.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe following pages are addressed to earnest investigators in the domain\r\nof natural science and jurisprudence. In order that unqualified persons\r\nshould not become readers, the author saw himself compelled to choose a\r\ntitle understood only by the learned, and also, where possible, to\r\nexpress himself in _terminis technicis_. It seemed necessary also to\r\ngive certain particularly revolting portions in Latin[4] rather than in\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this attempt to present to physician and jurist facts\r\nfrom an important sphere of life will receive kindly acceptance and fill\r\nan actual hiatus in literature; for, with the exception of certain\r\nsingle descriptions and cases, the literature presents only the writings\r\nof Moreau and Tarnowsky, which cover but a portion of the field.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinguished author of “Psychopathia Sexualis” speaks for himself\r\nand his work in its preface; but there are not wanting others to speak\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nDr. A. von Schrenck-Notzing, of Munich, writes[6]:—\r\n\r\n“It may be questioned whether it is justifiable to discuss the anomalies\r\nof the sexual instinct apart, instead of treating of them in their\r\nproper place in psychiatry. As a rule, they are certainly only symptoms\r\nof a constitutional malady, or of a weakened state of the brain, which\r\nmanifest themselves in the various forms of sexual perversion.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, attention has been directed to the baneful influence possibly\r\nexerted by such publications as ‘Psychopathia Sexualis.’ To be sure, the\r\nappearance of seven editions of that work could not be accounted for\r\nwere its circulation confined to scientific readers. Therefore, it\r\ncannot be denied that a pornographic interest on the part of the public\r\nis accountable for a part of the wide circulation of the book. But, in\r\nspite of this disadvantage, the injury done by implanting knowledge of\r\nsexual pathology in unqualified persons is not to be compared with the\r\ngood accomplished. History shows that uranism was very wide-spread long\r\nbefore the appearance of ‘Psychopathia Sexualis.’ The courts have\r\nconstantly to deal with sexual crimes in which the responsibility of the\r\naccused comes in question.\r\n\r\n“For the physician himself, sexual anomalies, treated as they are in a\r\ndistant manner in text-books on psychiatry, are in greater part a _terra\r\nincognita_. Exact knowledge of the causes and conditions of development\r\nof sexual aberrations, and of the influence on them of hereditary\r\nconstitution, education, the impressions of every-day life, and modern\r\nrefined civilization, is the prerequisite for a rational prophylaxis of\r\nsexual aberrations, and for a correct sexual education. Without careful\r\nstudy of the circumstances which attend the _development_ of sexual\r\nanomalies, we should never be in a position to use effectual\r\ntherapeusis. The majority of these unfortunates—Krafft-Ebing calls them\r\nNature’s step-children—are devoid of insight into their malady; like\r\ninsane patients destitute of understanding of the ethical development of\r\nman, they are happy in their abnormal instinctive tendency. For this\r\nreason, in spite of the great prevalence of uranism, very few of its\r\nsubjects seek medical treatment. While the terminal forms of sexual\r\naberrations end in asylums for the insane, the doubtful cases, in which\r\nincompleteness of development or apparent viciousness render correct\r\ndiagnosis difficult, make up the majority. But a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe aberrations of the sexual instinct is absolutely indispensable to\r\nthe jurist. The reasons given are thus sufficiently important to\r\ndemonstrate the need of a hand-book on ‘psychopathia sexualis.’”\r\n\r\nThese words also hold true for English-speaking physicians and\r\njurists,—who can scarcely fail to welcome the translation of a work so\r\nsystematic and comprehensive as “Psychopathia Sexualis”; a work\r\nconceived and executed in the highest scientific and humane spirit; a\r\nwork which not only broadens and systematizes our knowledge of\r\npsycho-sexual phenomena, but also demonstrates, in the results of\r\nhypnotic suggestion, how important mental therapeusis must ultimately\r\nbecome in the hands of the physician; a work which is a trustworthy\r\nguide in the study of the concrete case of sexual crime, and a\r\nphilosophical treatise on the inter-relations of sexual criminality,\r\ndisease, and criminal anthropology.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of translation have not been slight; but minor errors\r\ncannot destroy the author’s meaning.\r\n\r\nFor much encouragement in the work of translation my gratitude to Dr.\r\nJames G. Kiernan and Dr. G. Frank Lydston, of Chicago, both well-known\r\ninvestigators in this domain of psychopathology, is here expressed; and\r\nto Dr. William A. Stone, Assistant Superintendent at the Michigan\r\nAsylum, Kalamazoo, I am greatly indebted for assistance in the\r\npreparation of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n                                               CHARLES GILBERT CHADDOCK.\r\n\r\n  ST.

In the\r\ngratification of this natural impulse are found not only sensual\r\npleasure and sources of physical well-being, but also higher feelings of\r\nsatisfaction in perpetuating the single, perishable existence, by the\r\ntransmission of mental and physical attributes to a new being. In\r\ncoarse, sensual love, in the lustful impulse to satisfy this natural\r\ninstinct, man stands on a level with the animal; but it is given to him\r\nto raise himself to a height where this natural instinct no longer makes\r\nhim a slave: higher, nobler feelings are awakened, which,\r\nnotwithstanding their sensual origin, expand into a world of beauty,\r\nsublimity, and morality.\r\n\r\nOn this height man overcomes his natural instinct, and from an\r\ninexhaustible spring draws material and inspiration for higher\r\nenjoyment, for more earnest work, and the attainment of the ideal.\r\nMaudsley (_Deutsche Klinik_, 1873, 2, 3) rightly calls the sexual\r\nfeeling the foundation for the development of the social feeling. “Were\r\nman to be robbed of the instinct of procreation and all that arises from\r\nit mentally, nearly all poetry and, perhaps, the entire moral sense as\r\nwell, would be torn from his life.”\r\n\r\nSexuality is the most powerful factor in individual and social\r\nexistence; the strongest incentive to the exertion of strength and\r\nacquisition of property, to the foundation of a home, and to the\r\nawakening of altruistic feelings, first for a person of the opposite\r\nsex, then for the offspring, and, in a wider sense, for all humanity.\r\n\r\nThus all ethics and, perhaps, a good part of æsthetics and religion\r\ndepend upon the existence of sexual feeling.\r\n\r\nThough the sexual life leads to the highest virtues, even to the\r\nsacrifice of the ego, yet in its sensual force lies also the danger that\r\nit may degenerate into powerful passions and develop the grossest vices.\r\n\r\nLove as an unbridled passion is like a fire that burns and consumes\r\neverything; like an abyss that swallows all,—honor, fortune, well-being.\r\n\r\nIt seems of high psychological interest to trace the developmental\r\nphases through which, in the course of the evolution of human culture to\r\nthe morality and civilization of to-day, the sexual life has passed.[7]\r\nOn primitive ground the satisfaction of the sexual appetite of man seems\r\nlike that of the animal. Openness in the sexual act is not shunned; man\r\nand woman are not ashamed to go naked. To-day we see savages in this\r\ncondition (comp. Ploss, “Das Weib,” p. 196, 1884); as, for example, the\r\nAustralians, the Polynesians, and the Malays of the Philippines. The\r\nfemale is the common property of the males, the temporary booty of the\r\nstrongest, who strive for the possession of the most beautiful of the\r\nopposite sex, thus carrying out instinctively a kind of sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nWoman is a movable thing, a ware, an object of bargain and sale and\r\ngift; a thing to satisfy lust and to work.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a feeling of shame before others in the manifestation\r\nand satisfaction of the natural instinct, and modesty in the intercourse\r\nof the sexes, form the beginning of morality in the sexual life. From\r\nthis arose the effort to conceal the genitals (“And they knew that they\r\nwere naked”) and the secret performance of the sexual act.\r\n\r\nThe development of this degree of culture is favored by the rigors of\r\nclimate and the necessity for complete protection of the body thus\r\nentailed. Thus in part the fact is explained that among northern races\r\nmodesty may be proved anthropologically earlier than among southern\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nA further stage in the development of culture in sexual life is marked\r\nwhen the female ceases to be a movable thing. She becomes a person; and\r\nif still for a long time placed far below the male socially, yet the\r\nidea that the right of disposal of herself and her favors belongs to her\r\nis developed.\r\n\r\nThus she becomes the object of the male’s wooing. To the barbarous\r\nsensual feeling of sexual desire the beginnings of ethical feeling are\r\nadded. The instinct is intellectualized. Property in women ceases to\r\nexist. Individuals of the opposite sexes feel themselves drawn toward\r\neach other by mental and physical qualities, and show love for each\r\nother only. At this stage woman has a feeling that her charms belong\r\nonly to the man of her choice, and wishes to conceal them from others.\r\nThus, by the side of modesty, the foundations of chastity and\r\nfaithfulness—as long as the bond of love lasts—are laid.\r\n\r\nWoman attains this degree of social elevation earlier when, at the\r\ntransition from nomadic life to a state of fixed habitation, man obtains\r\na house and home, and the necessity arises for him to possess in woman a\r\ncompanion for the household,—a housewife.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations of the East, the Egyptians, the Israelites, and the\r\nGreeks, and among those of the West, the Germans, early attained this\r\nstage of culture. Among all these races, at this stage of advancement,\r\nthe esteem in which virginity, chastity, modesty, and sexual\r\nfaithfulness are held is in marked contrast with other nations which\r\noffer the female of the house to the guest for his sexual enjoyment.[8]\r\n\r\nThat this stage in the culture of sexual morality is quite high and\r\nmakes its appearance much later than other developmental forms of\r\nculture—as, for example, æsthetics—is seen from the condition of the\r\nJapanese, with whom it is the custom to marry a woman only after she has\r\nlived for a year in the tea-houses (which correspond with European\r\nhouses of prostitution), and to whom the nakedness of women is nothing\r\nshocking. At all events, among the Japanese every unmarried woman can\r\nprostitute herself without lessening her value as a future wife,—a proof\r\nthat with this remarkable people woman possesses no ethical worth, but\r\nis valued in marriage only as a means of enjoyment, procreation, and\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nChristianity gave the most powerful impulse to the moral elevation of\r\nthe sexual relations by raising woman to social equality with man and\r\nelevating the bond of love between man and woman to a religio-moral\r\ninstitution.[9]\r\n\r\nThe fact that in higher civilization human love must be monogamous and\r\nrest on a lasting contract was thus recognized. If nature does no more\r\nthan provide for procreation, a commonwealth (family or state) cannot\r\nexist without a guaranty that the offspring shall flourish physically,\r\nmorally, and intellectually. Christendom gained both mental and material\r\nsuperiority over the polygamous races, especially Islam, through the\r\nequalization of woman and man, and by establishing monogamous marriage\r\nand securing it by legal, religious, and moral ties.\r\n\r\nIf Mohammed was actuated by a desire to raise woman from her place as a\r\nslave and means of sensual gratification to a higher social and\r\nmatrimonial plane, nevertheless, in the Mohammedan world woman remained\r\nfar below man, to whom alone divorce was allowed and also made very\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nIslam kept woman from any participation in public life under all\r\ncircumstances, and thus hindered her intellectual and moral development.\r\nIn consequence of this the Mohammedan woman has ever remained\r\nessentially a means of sensual gratification and procreation; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the virtues and capabilities of the Christian woman, as\r\nhousewife, educator of children, and equal companion of man, have been\r\nallowed to unfold in all their beauty. Islam, with its polygamy and\r\nharem-life, is glaringly contrasted with the monogamy and family life of\r\nthe Christian world.\r\n\r\nThe same contrast is apparent in a comparison of the two religions with\r\nreference to the conception of the hereafter. The picture of eternity\r\nseen by the faith of the Christian is that of a paradise freed from all\r\nearthly sensuality, promising the purest of intellectual happiness; the\r\nfancy of the Mussulman fills the future life with the delights of a\r\nharem full of houris.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the aids which religion, law, education, and morality\r\ngive civilized man in the bridling of his passions, he is always in\r\ndanger of sinking from the clear height of pure, chaste love into the\r\nmire of common sensuality.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain one’s self on such a height, a constant struggle\r\nbetween natural impulses and morals, between sensuality and morality, is\r\nrequired. Only characters endowed with strong wills are able to\r\ncompletely emancipate themselves from sensuality and share in that pure\r\nlove from which spring the noblest joys of human life.\r\n\r\nIt is yet questionable whether, in the course of the later centuries,\r\nmankind has advanced in morality. It is certain, however, that the race\r\nhas become more modest; and this phenomenon of civilization—this hiding\r\nof the animal propensities—is, at least, a concession that vice makes to\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nFrom a reading of Scherr’s works (“History of German Civilization”) one\r\nwould certainly gain the impression that, in comparison with those of\r\nthe Middle Ages, our own ideas of morals have become refined, even when\r\nit must also be allowed that in many instances finer manners, without\r\ngreater morality, have taken the place of earlier obscenity and\r\ncoarseness of expression.\r\n\r\nWhen widely separated periods of history are compared, no doubt is left\r\nthat public morality, in spite of occasional temporary retrogression,\r\nmakes continuous progress, and that Christianity is one of the most\r\npowerful of the forces favoring moral progress.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are far beyond the sexual conditions which, as shown in the\r\nsodomitic worship of the gods, in the life of the people, and in the\r\nlaws and religious practices, existed among the ancient Greeks,—to say\r\nnothing of the worship of Phallus and Priapus among the Athenians and\r\nBabylonians, of the bacchanals of ancient Rome, and the prominent place\r\nprostitutes took among these peoples. In the slow and often\r\nimperceptible progress which human morality makes there are variations\r\nor fluctuations, just as in the individual sexuality manifests an ebb\r\nand flow.\r\n\r\nPeriods of moral decadence in the life of a people are always\r\ncontemporaneous with times of effeminacy, sensuality, and luxury. These\r\nconditions can only be conceived as occurring with increased demands\r\nupon the nervous system, which must meet these requirements. As a result\r\nof increase of nervousness, there is increase of sensuality, and, since\r\nthis leads to excesses among the masses, it undermines the foundation of\r\nsociety,—the morality and purity of family life. When this is destroyed\r\nby excesses, unfaithfulness, and luxury, then the destruction of the\r\nstate is inevitably compassed in material, moral, and political ruin.\r\nWarning examples of this character are presented by Rome, Greece, and\r\nFrance under Louis XIV and XV.[10] In such times of political and moral\r\ndestruction monstrous perversions of the sexual life were frequent,\r\nwhich, however, may in part be referred to psycho-pathological or, at\r\nleast, neuro-pathological conditions existing in the people.\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the history of Babylon, Nineveh, Rome, and also by the\r\n“mysteries” of life in modern Capitals, that large cities are the\r\nbreeding-places of nervousness and degenerate sensuality. The fact which\r\nmay be learned from reading Ploss’s work is remarkable, viz., that\r\nperversion of the sexual instinct (save among the Aleutians, and in the\r\nform of masturbation among the females of the East and the Nama\r\nHottentots) does not occur in uncivilized or half-civilized races.[11]\r\n\r\nThe study of the sexual life in the individual must begin at its\r\ndevelopment at puberty, and follow it through its different phases to\r\nthe extinction of sexual feelings. In his “Physiology of Love,”\r\nMantegazza describes the longings and impulses of awakening sexual life,\r\nof which presentiments, indefinite feelings, and impulses have existed\r\nlong before the epoch of puberty. This epoch is, physiologically, the\r\nmost important. In the abundant increase of feelings and ideas which it\r\nengenders is manifested the significance of the sexual factor in mental\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese impulses, at first vague and incomprehensible, arising from the\r\nsensations which are awakened by organs which were previously\r\nundeveloped, are accompanied by a powerful excitation of the emotions.\r\nThe psychological reaction of the sexual impulse at puberty expresses\r\nitself in a multitude of manifestations which have in common only the\r\nmental condition of emotion and the impulse to express in some way, or\r\nrender objective, the strange emotionality. Religion and poetry lie\r\nclose to it, which, after the time of sexual development is past and\r\nthese originally incomprehensible feelings and impulses have cleared up,\r\nreceive powerful incentives from the sexual sphere. He who doubts this\r\nhas only to think how often religious enthusiasm occurs at the time of\r\npuberty; how frequent sexual episodes are in the lives of the\r\nsaints;[12] how powerfully sensuality expresses itself in the histories\r\nof religious fanatics; and in what revolting scenes, true orgies, the\r\nreligious festivals of antiquity, no less than the “meetings” of certain\r\nsects in modern times, express themselves,—to say nothing of the lustful\r\nmysteries which characterized the cults of the ancients. On the other\r\nhand, we see that unsatisfied sensuality very frequently finds an\r\nequivalent in religious enthusiasm.[13]\r\n\r\nThis relation between religious and sexual feeling is also shown on the\r\nbasis of unequivocal psycho-pathological states. It suffices to recall\r\nhow intense sensuality makes itself manifest in the clinical histories\r\nof many religious maniacs; the motley mixture of religious and sexual\r\ndelusions that is so frequently observed in psychoses (_e.g._, in\r\nmaniacal women, who think they are or will be the Mother of God), but\r\nparticularly in masturbatic insanity; and, finally, the sensual, cruel\r\nself-punishments, injuries, self-castrations, and even self-crucifixions\r\nresulting from abnormal sexual-religious feeling.\r\n\r\n  Any attempt to explain the relations between religion and love has\r\n  difficulties to encounter. Many analogies present themselves. The\r\n  feeling of sexual attraction and religious feeling (considered as a\r\n  psychological fact) consist of two elements.\r\n\r\n  In religion the primary element is a feeling of dependence,—a fact\r\n  which Schleiermacher recognized long before the later studies in\r\n  anthropology and ethnography, founded on the observation of primitive\r\n  conditions, had led to the same conclusion. It is only at a higher\r\n  stage of culture that the second and essentially ethical element—love\r\n  of God—enters into religious feeling. In the place of the evil spirits\r\n  of the primitive peoples came the two-faced—now kind, now\r\n  angry—creations of the more complicated mythologies, until, finally,\r\n  the God of love, as the giver of eternal happiness, is reverenced,\r\n  whether this be hoped for from Jehovah, as a blessing on earth; from\r\n  Allah, as a physical blessing in Paradise; from Christ, as eternal\r\n  bliss in heaven; or as the Nirvana of the Buddhists.\r\n\r\n  In sexual desire, love, the expectation of unbounded happiness is the\r\n  primary element. The feeling of dependence is of secondary\r\n  development. The nucleus of this feeling exists in both parties, but\r\n  it may remain undeveloped in one. As a rule, owing to her passive part\r\n  in procreation and social conditions, it is more pronounced in woman;\r\n  but exceptionally this is true of men having minds that approach the\r\n  feminine type.\r\n\r\n  In both the religious and sexual spheres love is mystical,\r\n  transcendental. In sexual love the real purpose of the instinct, the\r\n  propagation of the species, does not enter into consciousness; and the\r\n  strength of the desire is greater than any that consciousness of\r\n  purpose could create. In religion, however, the good sought and the\r\n  object of devotion are of such nature that they cannot become a part\r\n  of empirical knowledge. Therefore, both mental processes give\r\n  unlimited range to the imagination.\r\n\r\n  But both have an immortal object, in as far as the bliss which the\r\n  sexual sentiment creates in fancy seems incomparable and infinite in\r\n  contrast with all other pleasurable feelings; and the same is true of\r\n  the promised blessings of faith, which are conceived to be eternal and\r\n  supreme.\r\n\r\n  From the correspondence between the two states of consciousness, with\r\n  reference to the commanding importance of their objects, it follows\r\n  that they both often attain an intensity that is irresistible, and\r\n  which overcomes all opposing motives. Owing to their similarity in\r\n  that their objects cannot be attained, it follows that both easily\r\n  degenerate into silly enthusiasm, in which the intensity of feeling\r\n  far surpasses the clearness and constancy of the ideas. In both cases,\r\n  in this enthusiasm, with the expectation of a happiness that cannot be\r\n  attained, the necessity of unconditional submission plays a part.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the correspondence in many points between these two emotional\r\n  states, it is clear that when they are very intense the one may take\r\n  the place of the other; or one may appear by the side of the other,\r\n  since every intensification of one element of mental life also\r\n  intensifies its associations. The constant emotion thus calls into\r\n  consciousness now one and now the other of the two series of ideas\r\n  with which it is connected. Either of these mental states may become\r\n  transformed into the impulse to cruelty (actively exercised or\r\n  passively suffered).\r\n\r\n  In the religious life this is expressed by sacrifice. Primarily this\r\n  is done with the idea that the victim is materially enjoyed by the\r\n  deity; then, in reverence, as a sign of submission, as a tribute; and,\r\n  finally, with the belief that sins and transgressions against the\r\n  deity are thus atoned for and blessing obtained. If, however, the\r\n  offering consist of self-punishment, which occurs in all religions, in\r\n  individuals of very excitable religious nature, it serves not only as\r\n  a symbol of submission and as an equivalent in the exchange of present\r\n  pain for future bliss, but everything that is thought to come from the\r\n  deity, all that happens in obedience to divine mandate or to the honor\r\n  of the godhead, is felt directly as pleasure. Thus religious\r\n  enthusiasm leads to ecstasy, to a condition in which consciousness is\r\n  so preoccupied with feelings of mental pleasure that the concept of\r\n  suffering endured can only be apperceived without its painful quality.\r\n\r\n  The exaltation of religious enthusiasm may lead actively to pleasure\r\n  in the sacrifice of another, if pity be overcompensated by feelings of\r\n  religious pleasure.\r\n\r\n  Sadism, and particularly masochism (_v. infra_), show that in the\r\n  sphere of the sexual life there may be similar phenomena. Thus the\r\n  well-established relations between religion, lust, and cruelty[14] may\r\n  be comprehended in the following formula: States of religious and\r\n  sexual excitement, at the acme of their development, may correspond in\r\n  the amount and quality of excitement, and, therefore, under favoring\r\n  circumstances, one may take the place of the other. Both, in\r\n  pathological conditions, may become transformed into cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe sexual factor proves to be no less influential in awakening æsthetic\r\nfeelings. What would poetry and art be without a sexual foundation? In\r\n(sensual) love is gained that warmth of fancy without which a true\r\ncreation of art is impossible; and in the fire of sensual feelings its\r\nglow and warmth are preserved. It may thus be understood why great poets\r\nand artists have sensual natures.\r\n\r\nThis world of ideals reveals itself with the inception of the processes\r\nof sexual development. He who, at this period of life, cannot become\r\nenthusiastic for all that is great, noble, and beautiful, remains a\r\nPhilistine all his life. At this epoch does not the least of natural\r\npoets forge verses?\r\n\r\nAt the limits of physiological reaction there are events which take\r\nplace at the time of puberty in which these obscure feelings of longing\r\nexpress themselves in paroxysms of despair of self and the world, which\r\nmay go on to _tædium vitæ_, and are often accompanied by a desire to do\r\nharm to others (weak analogies of a psychological connection between\r\nlust and cruelty).\r\n\r\nYouthful love has a romantic, idealistic character. It elevates the\r\nbeloved object to apotheosis. In its inception it is platonic, and turns\r\nto forms of poetry and romance. With the awakening of sensuality there\r\nis danger that this idealizing power may be brought to bear upon persons\r\nof the opposite sex who are mentally, physically, and socially of\r\ninferior station. Thus there may occur _méssalliances_, seductions, and\r\nerrors, with the whole tragedy of a passionate love that comes in\r\nconflict with the dictates of social position and prospects, and\r\nsometimes terminates in suicide or double suicide.\r\n\r\nOver-sensual love can never be lasting and true. For this reason the\r\nfirst love is, as a rule, very fleeting; because it is nothing else than\r\nthe flare of a passion, the flame of a fire of straw.\r\n\r\nOnly the love that rests upon a recognition of the social qualities of\r\nthe beloved person, only a love which is willing not only to enjoy\r\npresent pleasures, but to bear suffering for the beloved object and\r\nsacrifice all, is true love. The love of a strongly constituted man\r\nshrinks before no difficulties or dangers in order to gain and keep\r\npossession of its object.\r\n\r\nLove expresses itself in acts of heroism and daring. Such love is in\r\ndanger, under certain circumstances, of becoming criminal, if moral\r\nprinciples be weak. Jealousy is an ugly spot in this love. The love of a\r\nweakly constituted man is sentimental. It sometimes leads to suicide\r\nwhen it is not returned or meets with obstacles, while, under like\r\nconditions, the strongly constituted man may become a criminal.\r\n\r\nSentimental love is in danger of becoming a caricature, _i.e._, when the\r\nsensual element is weak (the Knight of Toggenburg, Don Quixote, many\r\nminnesingers and troubadours of the Middle Ages).\r\n\r\nSuch love is flat and soft, and may be even silly; but the true\r\nexpression of this powerful feeling awakens appropriate pity, respect,\r\nor sorrow in the hearts of others.\r\n\r\nFrequently this weak love expresses itself in equivalents—in poetry,\r\nwhich, however, under such circumstances, is effeminate; in æsthetics\r\nwhich are overdrawn; in religion, in which it gives itself up to\r\nmysteries and religious enthusiasm; or, where there is a more powerful\r\nsensual foundation, founds sects or expresses itself in religious\r\ninsanity. The immature love of the age of puberty has something of all\r\nthis in it. Of all the poems and rhymes written at this time of life,\r\nthey only are readable that are the product of poets divinely endowed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the ethics which love requires in order to develop\r\ninto its true and pure form, its strongest root is still sensuality.\r\nPlatonic love is an impossibility, a self-deception, a false designation\r\nfor related feelings.\r\n\r\nIn as far as love rests upon sensual desire, it is only conceivable in a\r\nnormal way as existing between individuals of opposite sex and capable\r\nof sexual intercourse. If these conditions are wanting or destroyed,\r\nthen, in the place of love, comes friendship.\r\n\r\nThe _rôle_ which the retention of sexual functions plays in the case of\r\na man, both in originating and retaining the feeling of self-respect, is\r\nremarkable. In the deterioration of manliness and self-confidence which\r\nthe onanist, in his weakened nervous state, and the man that has become\r\nimpotent, present, may be estimated the significance of this factor.\r\n\r\n  Gyurkovechky (männl. Impotenz. Vienna, 1889) says, very justly, that\r\n  old and young men essentially differ mentally, on account of the\r\n  condition of their virility, and that impotence has a detrimental\r\n  effect upon the feeling of well-being, mental freshness, activity,\r\n  self-confidence, and the play of fancy. This loss becomes the more\r\n  important the younger a man is when he loses his virility and the more\r\n  sensually he was constituted.\r\n\r\n  Under such circumstances a sudden loss of virility may induce severe\r\n  melancholia, and even lead to suicide. For such natures life without\r\n  love is unbearable.\r\n\r\n  But, also, in cases where the reaction is not so deep, the man bereft\r\n  of his virility is morose and spiteful, egotistic, jealous, contrary,\r\n  listless, has but little self-respect or sense of honor, and is\r\n  cowardly. Analogies are seen in the Skopzens,[15] who, after their\r\n  castration, change for the worse.\r\n\r\n  The loss of virility is still more noticeable in certain weakly\r\n  constituted individuals, where it expresses itself in formal\r\n  effemination (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\nIn a woman who has become a matron the condition is of much less\r\nimportance psychologically, though it is noticeable. If the past period\r\nof sexual life has been satisfactory, if children delight the heart of\r\nthe aging mother, then she is scarcely conscious of the change of her\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nThe situation is different, however, where sterility or circumstances\r\nhave kept a woman from the performance of her natural functions and\r\ndenied her that happiness.\r\n\r\nThese facts place in a clear light the differences which exist between\r\nman and woman in the psychology of the sexual life, and in all the\r\nsexual functions and desires.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly man has a much more intense sexual appetite than woman. As a\r\nresult of a powerful natural instinct, at a certain age, a man is drawn\r\ntoward a woman. He loves sensually, and is influenced in his choice by\r\nphysical beauty. In accordance with the nature of this powerful impulse,\r\nhe is aggressive and violent in his wooing. At the same time, this\r\ndemand of nature does not constitute all of his mental existence. When\r\nhis longing is satisfied, love temporarily retreats behind other vital\r\nand social interests.\r\n\r\nWith a woman it is quite otherwise. If she is normally developed\r\nmentally, and well bred, her sexual desire is small. If this were not so\r\nthe whole world would become a brothel and marriage and a family\r\nimpossible. It is certain that the man that avoids women and the woman\r\nthat seeks men are abnormal.\r\n\r\nWoman is wooed for her favor. She remains passive. This lies in her\r\nsexual organization, and is not founded merely on the dictates of good\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the sexual sphere occupies a much larger place in the\r\nconsciousness of woman than in that of man. The need of love in her is\r\ngreater than in man, and is continual, not intermittent; but this love\r\nis rather more spiritual than sensual. While a man loves a woman first\r\nas wife and then as mother of his children, a woman is primarily\r\nconscious of a man as the father of her children and then as husband. In\r\nthe choice of a life-companion a woman is influenced much more by the\r\nmental than the physical qualities of a man. When she has become a\r\nmother she divides her love between child and husband. Sensuality\r\ndisappears in the mother’s love. Thereafter, in marital intercourse, the\r\nwife finds less sensual satisfaction than proof of the love of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nA woman loves with her whole soul. To her love is life; to a man it is\r\nthe joy of life. To him misfortune in love is a wound; but it costs a\r\nwoman her life, or at least her happiness. A psychological question\r\nworthy of consideration is whether a woman can truly love twice in her\r\nlife. Certainly the mental inclination of woman is monogamous, while in\r\nman it is polygamous.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of men in comparison with women lies in the great intensity\r\nof their sexual desires. Man becomes dependent upon woman, and the more,\r\nthe weaker and more sensual he becomes; and this just in proportion as\r\nhe becomes neuropathic. Thus may be understood the fact that, in times\r\nof effeminateness and luxury, sensuality flourishes luxuriantly. Then\r\narises the danger to society that mistresses and their dependents may\r\nrule the state and compass its ruin (the mistresses of the courts of\r\nLouis XIV and XV; the prostitutes of ancient Greece).\r\n\r\nThe biographies of many statesmen of ancient and modern times show that\r\nthey were the instruments of women, owing to their great sensuality,\r\nwhich had its foundation in their neuropathic constitutions. The fact\r\nthat the Catholic Church enjoins celibacy upon its priests, in order to\r\nemancipate them from sensuality and preserve them entirely for the\r\npurpose of their calling, is an example of discerning psychological\r\nknowledge of mankind; but it is unfortunate that the priests, living in\r\ncelibacy, lose the elevating effect which love and matrimony exert upon\r\nthe development of character.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that man by nature plays the aggressive _rôle_ in sexual\r\nlife, he is in danger of overstepping the limits which morality and law\r\nhave set. The unfaithfulness of a wife, in comparison with that of a\r\nhusband, is morally much more weighty, and should be more severely\r\npunished legally. The unfaithful wife dishonors not only herself, but\r\nalso her husband and her family, not to speak of the possibility of\r\n_pater incertus_. Natural instinct and social position favor\r\nunfaithfulness on the part of a husband, while the wife is afforded much\r\nprotection. In the case of an unmarried woman, sexual intercourse is\r\nsomething quite different from what it is in an unmarried man. Of a\r\nsingle man society demands decency; of a woman, also chastity. In the\r\ncultivated social life of to-day, woman, occupying a sexual position and\r\nconcerning herself in the interests of society, can only be thought of\r\nas a wife.\r\n\r\nThe aim and ideal of woman, even when she is sunken in the mire of vice,\r\nis, and remains, marriage. Woman, as Mantegazza justly remarks, desires\r\nnot only satisfaction of her sexual feeling, but also protection and\r\nsupport for herself and her children. A man of right feeling, no matter\r\nhow sensual he may be, demands a wife that has been, and is, chaste. The\r\nemblem and ornament of a woman seeking this, her only worthy purpose in\r\nlife, is modesty. Mantegazza finely characterizes modesty as “one of the\r\nforms of psychical self-respect” in woman. This is not the place for\r\nanthropological and historical consideration of this, the most beautiful\r\nattribute of woman. Probably, feminine modesty is an hereditarily\r\nevolved product of the development of civilization.[16]\r\n\r\nIn remarkable contrast with it, there is occasional exposition of\r\nphysical charms, conventionally sanctioned by the law of fashion, in\r\nwhich even the most discreet maiden allows herself to indulge in the\r\nball-room. The reasons which lead to this display are evident.\r\nFortunately the modest girl is as little conscious of them as of the\r\nreason for the occasionally recurring mode of making certain portions of\r\nthe body more prominent (panniers); to say nothing of corsets, etc.\r\n\r\nIn all times, and among all races, women show a desire to adorn\r\nthemselves and be charming.[17] In the animal kingdom nature has\r\ndistinguished the male with the greater beauty. Men designate women as\r\nthe beautiful sex. This gallantry clearly arises from the sensual desire\r\nof men. As long as this personal adornment has a purpose only in itself,\r\nor the true psychological reason of the desire to please remains unknown\r\nto the woman, nothing can be said against it. When it is done with\r\nknowledge, the effort is called flirting.\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances a dandified man is ridiculous. We are accustomed\r\nto this slight weakness in a woman, and find no fault with it, so long\r\nas it is but a subordinate manifestation. When it has become the\r\nall-absorbing aim, the French apply to it the word coquetry.\r\n\r\nWoman far surpasses man in the natural psychology of love, partly\r\nbecause, through heredity and education, her native element is love; and\r\npartly because she has finer feelings (Mantegazza). Even in a man of the\r\nvery highest breeding, it cannot be found objectionable that he\r\nrecognizes woman as a means of satisfying his natural instinct. But it\r\nbecomes his duty to belong only to the woman of his choice. In a\r\ncivilized state this becomes a binding social obligation,—marriage; and,\r\ninasmuch as the wife requires for herself and children protection and\r\nsupport, it becomes a marriage right.\r\n\r\n  It is of great importance psychologically, and, for certain\r\n  pathological manifestations to be later described, indispensable, to\r\n  examine the psychological events which draw a man and a woman together\r\n  and unite them; so that, of all other persons of the same sex, only\r\n  the beloved one seems desirable.\r\n\r\n  If one could demonstrate design in the processes of nature,—adaptation\r\n  cannot be denied them,—the fact of fascination by a single person of\r\n  the opposite sex, with indifference toward all others, as it occurs\r\n  between true and happy lovers, would appear as a wonderful creative\r\n  provision to insure monogamous unions for the promotion of their\r\n  object.\r\n\r\n  To the scientific observer, however, this love, or “harmony of souls,”\r\n  this “heart-bond,” does not, by any means, appear as a “soul-mystery;”\r\n  but, in the majority of cases, it may be referred to certain physical\r\n  or mental peculiarities, as the case may be, by which the\r\n  attractiveness of the beloved person is exerted.\r\n\r\n  Thus we speak of what is called _fetich_ and _fetichism_. In the term\r\n  _fetich_ we are wont to comprehend objects, or parts, or simply\r\n  peculiarities of objects, which, by virtue of associative relations to\r\n  an intense feeling, or to a personality or idea that awakens deep\r\n  interest, exert a kind of charm (“_fetisso_,” Portuguese), or, at\r\n  least, owing to peculiar individual coloring, produce a very deep\r\n  impression which does not belong to the external sign (symbol, fetich)\r\n  in itself.[18]\r\n\r\n  The individual valuation of the fetich, which may go to the extent of\r\n  an unreasoning enthusiasm in the individual affected, is called\r\n  fetichism. This interesting psychological phenomenon is explicable by\r\n  an empirical law of association,—the relation of a particular to a\r\n  general concept,—in which, however, the essential thing is the\r\n  pleasurable emotional coloring of the particular concept peculiar to\r\n  the individual. It is most common in two related mental spheres,—those\r\n  of religious and erotic feelings and ideas. Religious fetichism\r\n  differs in relation and significance from sexual fetichism, for it\r\n  found, and still finds, its original motive in the delusion that the\r\n  object of the fetichism, or the idol, possesses divine attributes, and\r\n  that it is not simply a symbol; or peculiar wonder-working (relics) or\r\n  protective (amulet) virtues are superstitiously ascribed to the\r\n  fetich.\r\n\r\n  It is otherwise with erotic fetichism, which finds its psychological\r\n  motive in fetiches which consist of physical or mental qualities of a\r\n  person, or even merely of objects which a person has used. These\r\n  always awaken intense associative ideas of the personality as a whole,\r\n  and, moreover, are always colored with a lively feeling of sexual\r\n  pleasure. Analogies with religious fetichism are always discernible;\r\n  for, under certain circumstances, in the latter, the most\r\n  insignificant objects (bones, nails, hair, etc.) become fetiches, and\r\n  are associated with pleasurable feelings which may reach the intensity\r\n  of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nWith respect of the development of physiological love, it is probable\r\nthat its nucleus is always to be found in an individual fetich (charm)\r\nwhich a person of one sex exercises over a person of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe case is the simplest where the sight of a person of the opposite sex\r\noccurs simultaneously with sensual excitement, and the latter is thus\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nEmotional and visual impressions are brought into associative\r\nconnection, and this association is strengthened in proportion as the\r\nrecurring emotion awakens the visual memory-picture, or the latter\r\n(another meeting) renews sexual excitement, which may possibly reach the\r\nintensity of orgasm and pollution (dream-picture). In this case the\r\nwhole physical personality has the effect of a fetich.\r\n\r\nAs Binet and others show, merely parts of the whole, simply\r\npeculiarities, either physical or mental, may affect the person of the\r\nopposite sex as a fetich, when the perception of them is associated with\r\n(accidental) sexual excitement (or induces it).\r\n\r\nIt is well known from experience that accident determines this mental\r\nassociation, that the objects of the fetich may be individually very\r\ndiverse, and that thus the most peculiar sympathies (and antipathies)\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThese physiological facts of fetichism explain the individual sympathies\r\nbetween husband and wife; the preference of a certain person to all\r\nothers of the same sex. Since the fetich represents a symbol that is\r\npurely individual, it is clear that its effect must be individual. Since\r\nit is colored by the most intense pleasurable feeling, it follows that\r\npossible faults in the beloved object are overlooked (“Love is blind”),\r\nand an exaltation of it is induced that to others is incomprehensible,\r\nand even silly under some circumstances. Thus it is clear why lovers are\r\nnot understood by their unaffected fellow-men; and why they deify their\r\nidols, develop a true cult of devotion, and invests them with attributes\r\nwhich objectively they do not possess. Thus we may understand why love\r\nappears sometimes more like a passion, sometimes as a formal,\r\nexceptional mental state, in which the unattainable seems attainable,\r\nthe ugly beautiful, the profane sacred, and every other interest, every\r\nduty, disappears.\r\n\r\nTarde (_Archives de l’anthropologie criminelle_, v year, No. 30)\r\nrightfully emphasizes the fact that the fetich may vary with nations as\r\nwell as with individuals, but that the general ideal of beauty remains\r\nthe same among civilized people of the same era.\r\n\r\nBinet deserves great credit for having studied and analyzed in detail\r\nthe fetichism of love. The particular sympathies all spring from it.\r\nThus one is attracted to slender, another to plump beauties, to blondes\r\nor brunettes. For one a peculiar expression of the eyes; for another a\r\npeculiar tone of the voice, or a particular (even an artificial) odor\r\n(perfume); or the hand, the foot, the ear, etc., may be the individual\r\nfetich (charm),—the beginning of a complicated chain of mental processes\r\nwhich, as a whole, represent love, _i.e._, the longing to possess,\r\nphysically and mentally, the beloved object.\r\n\r\nThis fact is important, as showing a condition for the origin of a\r\nfetichism that falls within physiological limits. The fetich may\r\nconstantly retain its significance without being pathological; but this\r\nis possible only when the particular concept is developed to a general\r\nconcept; when the resulting love comes to take as its object the whole\r\nmental and physical personality.\r\n\r\nNormal love can be nothing but a synthesis, a generalization. Ludwig\r\nBrunn,[19] under the heading, “The Fetichism of Love,” cleverly says:—\r\n\r\n“Thus normal love appears to us as a symphony of tones of all kinds. It\r\nresults from the most various stimuli. It is likewise polytheistic.\r\nFetichism recognizes only the tone of a single instrument; it results\r\nfrom a certain stimulus; it is monotheistic.”\r\n\r\nOn slight reflection any one will see that real love (this word is only\r\ntoo often abused) can be spoken of only when the whole person is both\r\nphysically and mentally the object of adoration. Love must always have a\r\nsensual element, _i.e._, the desire to possess the beloved object, to be\r\nunited with it and fulfill the laws of nature. But when merely the body\r\nof the person of the opposite sex is the object of love, when\r\nsatisfaction of sensual pleasure is the sole object, without desire to\r\npossess the soul and enjoy mutual communion, love is not genuine, no\r\nmore than that of platonic lovers, who love only the soul and avoid\r\nsensual pleasure (many cases of contrary sexuality). For the former\r\nmerely the body, for the latter simply the soul, is a fetich, and the\r\nlove fetichism. Such cases certainly represent transitions to\r\npathological fetichism. This assumption is even more justified when, as\r\na further criterion of real love, mental[20] satisfaction must be given\r\nby the sexual act.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be mentioned, within the physiological phenomena of\r\nfetichism, the fact that among the many things that may become fetiches\r\nthere are certain ones that gain such significance for a majority of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAs such for a man may be mentioned the hair, the hand, the foot of a\r\nwoman, the expression of her eyes. Certain ones of these gain a\r\nremarkable significance in the pathology of fetichism. These facts\r\nclearly play a _rôle_ in the feminine mind, either consciously or\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest cares of women is the cultivation of the hair, to\r\nwhich often an unreasonable amount of time and money is devoted. How a\r\nmother cares for her little daughter’s hair! What a part the\r\nhair-dresser plays! Falling of the hair would cause despair in a young\r\nlady. I recall a proud lady who became insane over it, and died by\r\nsuicide. Young ladies like to talk of coiffures, and are envious of\r\nbeautiful hair.[21]\r\n\r\nBeautiful hair is a powerful fetich with many men. In the legend of the\r\nLoreley, who lured men to destruction, the golden hair, which she combs\r\nwith a golden comb, appears as a fetich. Frequently the hand and foot\r\npossess an attractiveness no less powerful, when, indeed, often (though\r\nby no means invariably) masochistic and sadistic feelings aid in\r\ndetermining the peculiar kind of fetich.\r\n\r\nBy a transference through association of ideas, the gloves or shoes may\r\nobtain the significance of a fetich.\r\n\r\nBrunn (_op. cit._) justly points out that among the customs of the\r\nMiddle Ages drinking from the shoe of a beautiful woman (still to be\r\nfound in Poland) played a remarkable part in gallantry and homage. The\r\nshoe also plays an important _rôle_ in the legend of Aschenbrödel.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the eyes is particularly important as a means of\r\nkindling the sparks of love. A neuropathic eye frequently affects\r\npersons of both sexes as a fetich. “Madame, vos beaux yeux me font\r\nmourir d’amour” (Molière).\r\n\r\nThere is superfluity of examples showing that odors of the body may\r\nbecome fetiches.\r\n\r\nThis fact is also taken advantage of in the _ars amandi_ of woman,\r\neither consciously or unconsciously. Ruth sought to attract Boaz by\r\nperfuming herself. The _demi-monde_ of ancient and modern times is noted\r\nfor its use of perfume. Jäger, in his “Discovery of the Soul,” calls\r\nattention to many olfactory sympathies.\r\n\r\nCases are known where men have married ugly women simply because their\r\npersonal odors were exceedingly pleasing.\r\n\r\nBinet makes it probable that the voice may also become a fetich. He\r\nrelates a case in point of Dumas, who used it in his novel, “La Maison\r\ndu Vent.” It was the case of a wife who fell in love with a tenor’s\r\nvoice, and thus became untrue to her husband. Belot’s romance, “Les\r\nBaigneuses de Trouville,” speaks in favor of this assumption. Binet\r\nthinks that many marriages with singers are due to the fetich of their\r\nvoices. He also calls attention to the interesting fact that among\r\nsinging-birds the voice has the same sexual significance as odors among\r\nquadrupeds. The birds allure by their song, and the male that sings most\r\nbeautifully flies at night to his charmed mate.\r\n\r\nThe pathological facts of masochism and sadism show that mental\r\npeculiarities may also act as fetiches in a wider sense.\r\n\r\nThus the fact of idiosyncrasies is explained, and the old saying, “_De\r\ngustibus non est disputandum_,” retains its force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            II. PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the physiological processes in the reproductive\r\nglands, desires arise in the consciousness of the individual which have\r\nfor their purpose the perpetuation of the species (sexual instinct).\r\n\r\nSexual desire during the years of sexual maturity is a physiological\r\nlaw. The duration of the physiological processes in the sexual organs,\r\nas well as the strength of the sexual desire manifested, vary, both in\r\nindividuals and in races. Race, climate, heredity, and social\r\ncircumstances have a very decided influence upon it. The greater\r\nsensuality of southern races as compared with the sexual needs of those\r\nof the North is well known. Sexual development in the inhabitants of\r\ntropical climes takes place much earlier than in those of more northern\r\nregions. In women of northern countries ovulation, recognizable in the\r\ndevelopment of the body and the occurrence of a periodical flow of blood\r\nfrom the genitals (menstruation), usually begins about the thirteenth or\r\nfifteenth year; in men puberty, recognizable in the deepening of the\r\nvoice, the appearance of hair on the face and the mons veneris, and the\r\noccasional occurrence of pollutions, etc., takes place about the\r\nfifteenth year. In the inhabitants of tropical countries, however,\r\nsexual development takes place several years earlier in women,—sometimes\r\nas early as the eighth year.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that girls who live in cities develop about a\r\nyear earlier than girls living in the country, and that the larger the\r\ntown the earlier, _ceteris paribus_, the development takes place.\r\n\r\nHeredity, however, has no small influence on libido and sexual power.\r\nThus there are families in which, with great physical strength and\r\nlongevity, great libido and virility are preserved until a great age,\r\nwhile in other families the vita sexualis develops late and is early\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIn women the time of the activity of the reproductive glands is shorter\r\nthan in men, in whom the sexual function may last until a great age.\r\nOvulation ceases about thirty years after puberty. This period of\r\ncessation of activity of the ovaries is called the change of life\r\n(climacterium). This biological phase does not represent merely a\r\ncessation of function and final atrophy of the reproductive organs, but\r\nalso a transformation of the whole organism. In Middle Europe the sexual\r\nmaturity of men begins about the eighteenth year, and their virility\r\nreaches its acme at forty. After that age it slowly declines.\r\n\r\nThe potentia generandi ceases usually at the age of sixty-two, but\r\npotentia cœundi may be present even in old age. The existence of the\r\nsexual instinct is continuous during the time of sexual life, but it\r\nvaries in intensity. Under physiological conditions it is never\r\nintermittent (periodical), as in animals. In men it manifests an organic\r\nvariation of intensity in consonance with the collection and expenditure\r\nof semen; in women the increase of sexual desire coincides with the\r\nprocess of ovulation, and in such a way that libido sexualis is greater\r\nafter the menstrual period.\r\n\r\nSexual instinct—as emotion, idea, and impulse—is a function of the\r\ncerebral cortex. Thus far no definite region of the cortex has been\r\nproved to be exclusively the seat of sexual sensations and impulses.[22]\r\n\r\nOwing to the close relations which exist between the sexual instinct and\r\nthe olfactory sense, it is to be presumed that the sexual and olfactory\r\ncentres lie close together in the cerebral cortex. The development of\r\nthe sexual life has its beginning in the organic sensations which arise\r\nfrom the developing reproductive glands. These excite the attention of\r\nthe individual. Readings and the experiences of every-day life (which,\r\nunfortunately, to-day are too early and too frequently suggestive)\r\nconvert these notions into clear ideas. These become accentuated by\r\norganic sensations which are pleasurable. With this accentuation of\r\nerotic ideas by lustful feelings, an impulse to induce these (sexual\r\ndesire) is developed.\r\n\r\nThus there is established a mutual dependence between the cerebral\r\ncortex (as the place of origin of sensations and ideas) and the\r\nreproductive organs. The latter, by reason of physiological processes\r\n(hyperæmia, secretion of semen, ovulation), give rise to sexual ideas,\r\nimages, and impulses.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral cortex, by means of apperceived or reproduced sensual\r\nideas, reacts on the reproductive organs, inducing hyperæmia, secretion\r\nof semen, erection, ejaculation. This results by means of centres for\r\nvasomotor innervation and ejaculation, which are situated in the lumbar\r\nportion of the cord and lie close together. Both are reflex centres.\r\n\r\nThe erection-centre (Goltz, Eckhard) is an intermediate station placed\r\nbetween the brain and the genital apparatus. The nervous paths which\r\nconnect it with the brain probably run through the pedunculi cerebri and\r\nthe pons. This centre may be excited by central (psychical and organic)\r\nstimuli, by direct irritation of the nerve-tract in the pedunculis\r\ncerebri, pons, or cervical portion of the cord, as well as by peripheral\r\nirritation of the sensory nerves (penis, clitoris, and annexa). It is\r\nnot directly subordinated to the will.\r\n\r\nThe excitation of this centre is conveyed to the corpora cavernosa by\r\nmeans of nerves (nervi erigentes—Eckhard) running in the first three\r\nsacral nerves.\r\n\r\nThe action of the nervi erigentes, which renders erection possible, is\r\nan inhibitory one. They inhibit the ganglionic nervous mechanism in the\r\ncorpora cavernosa upon the action of which the smooth muscle-fibres of\r\nthe corpora cavernosa are dependent (Kölliker and Kohlrausch). Under the\r\ninfluence of the action of the nervi erigentes these fibres of the\r\ncorpora cavernosa become relaxed and their spaces fill with blood.\r\nSimultaneously, as a result of the dilatation of the capillary net-work\r\nof the corpora cavernosa, pressure is exerted upon the veins of the\r\npenis and the return of blood is impeded. This effect is aided by\r\ncontraction of the bulbo cavernosus and ischio cavernosus muscles, which\r\nare inserted by means of an aponeurosis on the dorsal surface of the\r\npenis.\r\n\r\nThe erection-centre is under the influence of both exciting and\r\ninhibitory innervation arising in the cerebrum. Ideas and\r\nsense-perceptions of sexual content have an exciting effect. Also,\r\naccording to observations made on men that have been hung, it is evident\r\nthat the erection-centre may be excited by excitation of the tract in\r\nthe spinal cord. Observations on the insane and those suffering with\r\ncerebral disease show that this is also possible as a result of organic\r\nirritation in the cerebral cortex (psycho-sexual centre?). Spinal\r\ndiseases (tabes, especially myelitis) affecting the lumbar portion of\r\nthe cord, in their earlier stages, may directly excite the\r\nerection-centre.\r\n\r\nReflex excitation of the centre is possible and frequent in the\r\nfollowing ways: by irritation of the (peripheral) sensory nerves of the\r\ngenitals and surrounding parts by friction; by irritation of the urethra\r\n(gonorrhœa), of the rectum (hæmorrhoids, oxyuris), of the bladder\r\n(distension with urine, especially in the morning, irritation of\r\ncalculi); by distension of the vesicular seminales with semen; by\r\nhyperæmia of the genitals, occasioned by lying on the back, and thus\r\ninducing pressure of the intestines upon the blood-vessels of the\r\npelvis.\r\n\r\nThe erection-centre may also be excited by irritation of the nervous\r\nganglia which are so abundant in the prostatic tissue (prostatitis,\r\nintroduction of catheter, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe experiment of Goltz, according to whom, when (in dogs) the lumbar\r\nportion of the cord is severed, erection is more easily induced, shows\r\nthat the erection-centre is also subject to inhibitory influences from\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nIn men the fact that the will and emotions (fear of unsuccessful coitus,\r\nsurprise inter actum sexualem, etc.) may inhibit the occurrence of\r\nerection, and cause it, when present, to disappear, also indicates this.\r\n\r\nThe duration of erection is dependent upon the duration of its exciting\r\ncauses (sensory stimuli), the absence of inhibitory influences, the\r\nnervous energy of the centre, and the early or late occurrence of\r\nejaculation (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\nThe central and highest portion of the sexual mechanism is the cerebral\r\ncortex. It is justifiable to presume that there is a definite region of\r\nthe cortex (cerebral centre) which gives rise to sexual feelings, ideas,\r\nand impulses, and is the place of origin of the psycho-somatic processes\r\nwhich we designate as sexual life, sexual instinct, and sexual desire.\r\nThis centre is excitable to both central and peripheral stimuli.\r\n\r\nCentral stimuli, in the form of organic excitation, may be due to\r\ndiseases of the cerebral cortex. Physiologically they consist of\r\npsychical stimuli (memory and sensory perceptions).\r\n\r\nUnder physiological conditions these stimuli are essentially visual\r\nperceptions and memory-pictures (_i.e._, lascivious stories) and also\r\ntactile impressions (touch, pressure of the hand, kiss, etc.).\r\n\r\nWithin physiological limits auditory and olfactory perceptions certainly\r\nplay but a very subordinate _rôle_. Under pathological conditions (_v.\r\ninfra_) the latter have a very decided influence in inducing sexual\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nAmong animals the influence of olfactory perceptions on the sexual sense\r\nis unmistakable. Althaus (“Beiträge zur Physiol. und Pathol. des\r\nOlfactorius.” _Archiv für Psych._, xii, H 1) declares that the sense of\r\nsmell is important with reference to the reproduction of the species. He\r\nshows that animals of opposite sexes are drawn to each other by means of\r\nolfactory perceptions, and that almost all animals, at the time of\r\nrutting, emit a very strong odor from their genitals. An experiment by\r\nSchiff is confirmatory of this. He extirpated the olfactory nerves in\r\npuppies, and found that, as the animals grew, the male was unable to\r\ndistinguish the female. On the other hand, an experiment by Mantegazza\r\n(“Hygiene of Love”), who removed the eyes of rabbits and found that the\r\ndefect constituted no obstacle to procreation, shows how important in\r\nanimals the olfactory sense is for the vita sexualis.\r\n\r\nIt is also remarkable that many animals (musk-ox, civet-cat, beaver)\r\npossess glands on their sexual organs, which secrete materials having a\r\nvery strong odor.\r\n\r\nAlthaus also shows that in man there are certain relations existing\r\nbetween the olfactory and sexual senses. He mentions Cloquet\r\n(“Osphrésiologie,” Paris, 1826), who calls attention to the sensual\r\npleasure excited by the odors of flowers, and tells how Richelieu lived\r\nin an atmosphere loaded with the heaviest perfumes, in order to excite\r\nhis sexual functions.\r\n\r\nZippe (_Wien. Med. Wochenschrift_, 1879, Nr. 24), in connection with a\r\ncase of kleptomania in an onanist, likewise establishes such relations,\r\nand cites Hildebrand as authority, who in his popular physiology says:\r\n“It cannot be doubted that the olfactory sense stands in remote\r\nconnection with the sexual apparatus. Odors of flowers often occasion\r\npleasurable sensual feelings, and when one remembers the passage in the\r\n‘Song of Solomon,’ ‘And my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with\r\nsweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock,’ one finds that it\r\ndid not escape Solomon’s observation. In the Orient the pleasant\r\nperfumes are esteemed for their relation to the sexual organs, and the\r\nwomen’s apartments of the Sultan are filled with the perfumes of\r\nflowers.”\r\n\r\nMost, professor in Rostock (comp. Zippe), relates: “I learned from a\r\nsensual young peasant that he had excited many a chaste girl sexually,\r\nand easily gained his end, by carrying his handkerchief in his axilla\r\nfor a time, while dancing, and then wiping his partner’s perspiring face\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\nThe case of Henry III shows that contact with a person’s perspiration\r\nmay be the exciting cause of passionate love. At the betrothal feast of\r\nthe King of Navarre and Margaret of Valois, he accidentally dried his\r\nface with a garment of Maria of Cleves, which was moist with her\r\nperspiration. Although she was the bride of the Prince of Condé, Henry\r\nconceived immediately such a passionate love for her that he could not\r\nresist it, and made her, as history shows, very unhappy. An analogous\r\ninstance is related of Henry IV, whose passion for the beautiful Gabriel\r\nis said to have originated at the instant when, at a ball, he wiped his\r\nbrow with her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jäger, the “discoverer of the soul,” refers to the same thing\r\nin his well-known book (2d ed., 1880, chap. xv, p. 173); for he regards\r\nthe sweat as important in the production of sexual effects and as being\r\nespecially seductive.\r\n\r\nOne learns from reading the work of Ploss (“Das Weib”) that attempts to\r\nattract a person of the opposite sex by means of the perspiration may be\r\ndiscerned in many forms in popular psychology.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this, a custom which holds among the natives of the\r\nPhilippine Islands when they become engaged, as reported by Jäger, is\r\nremarkable. When it becomes necessary for the engaged pair to separate,\r\nthey exchange articles of wearing-apparel, by means of which each\r\nbecomes assured of faithfulness. These objects are carefully preserved,\r\ncovered with kisses, and smelled.\r\n\r\nThe love of certain libertines and sensual women for perfumes[23]\r\nindicates a relation between the olfactory and sexual senses.\r\n\r\nA case mentioned by Heschl (_Wiener Zeitschrift f. pract. Heilkunde_,\r\nMarch 22, 1861) is remarkable, where the absence of both olfactory lobes\r\nwas accompanied by imperfectly developed genitals. It was the case of a\r\nman aged 45, in all respects well developed, with the exception of the\r\ntesticles, which were not larger than beans and contained no seminal\r\ncanals, and the larynx, which seemed to be of feminine dimensions. Every\r\ntrace of olfactory nerves was wanting, and the trigona olfactoria and\r\nthe furrow on the under surface of the anterior lobes were absent. The\r\nperforations of the ethmoid plate were sparingly present, and occupied\r\nby nerveless processes of the dura instead of by nerves. In the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nose there was also an absence of nerves. Finally, the\r\nclearly-defined relation of the olfactory and sexual senses in mental\r\ndiseases is worthy of notice, in that in the psychoses of both sexes\r\ndependent on masturbation, as well as in insanity due to disease of the\r\nsexual organs of the female, or during the climacteric[24], olfactory\r\nhallucinations are especially frequent, while in cases where a sexual\r\ncause is wanting they are very infrequent.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to doubt[25] that olfactory impressions in man, under\r\nnormal conditions, as in animals, play an important _rôle_ in the\r\nexcitation of the sexual centre. On account of the importance of this\r\n_consensus_ for the understanding of pathological cases, it is necessary\r\nhere to thoroughly consider the relations existing between the olfactory\r\nand sexual senses.\r\n\r\nThe sexual sphere of the cerebral cortex may be excited, in the sense of\r\nan excitation of sexual concepts and impulses, by processes in the\r\ngenerative organs. This is possible as a result of all conditions which\r\nalso excite the erection-centre by means of centripetal influence\r\n(stimulus resulting from distension of the seminal vesicles; enlarged\r\nGraafian follicle; any sensory stimulus, however produced, about the\r\ngenitals; hyperæmia and turgescence of the genitals, especially of the\r\nerectile tissue of the corpus cavernosum of the penis and clitoris, as a\r\nresult of luxurious, sedentary life; plethora abdominalis, high external\r\ntemperature, warm beds, clothing; taking of cantharides, pepper, and\r\nother spices).\r\n\r\nLibido sexualis may also be induced by stimulation of the gluteal region\r\n(castigation, whipping).[26]\r\n\r\nThis fact is not unimportant for the understanding of certain\r\npathological manifestations. It sometimes happens that in boys the first\r\nexcitation of the sexual instinct is caused by a spanking, and they are\r\nthus incited to masturbation. This should be remembered by those who\r\nhave the care of children.\r\n\r\nOn account of the dangers to which this form of punishment of children\r\ngives rise, it would be better if parents, teachers, and nurses were to\r\navoid it entirely.\r\n\r\nPassive flagellation may excite sensuality, as is shown by the sects of\r\nflagellants, so wide-spread in the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\nThey were accustomed to whip themselves, partly as atonement and partly\r\nto kill the flesh (in accordance with the principle of chastity\r\npromulgated by the Church,—_i.e._, the emancipation of the soul from\r\nsensuality).\r\n\r\nThese sects were at first favored by the Church; but, since sensuality\r\nwas only excited the more by flagellation, and the fact became apparent\r\nin unpleasant occurrences, the Church was finally compelled to oppose\r\nit. The following facts from the lives of the two heroines of\r\nflagellation, Maria Magdalena of Pazzi and Elizabeth of Genton, clearly\r\nshow the significance of flagellation as a sexual excitant. The former,\r\na child of distinguished parents, was a Carmelite nun in Florence (about\r\n1580), and, by her flagellations, and, still more, through the results\r\nof them, she became quite celebrated, and is mentioned in the Annals. It\r\nwas her greatest delight to have the prioress bind her hands behind her\r\nand have her whipped on the naked loins in the presence of the assembled\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nBut the whippings, continued from her earliest youth, quite destroyed\r\nher nervous system, and perhaps no other heroine of flagellation had so\r\nmany hallucinations (“Entzückungen”). While being whipped her thoughts\r\nwere of love. The inner fire threatened to consume her, and she\r\nfrequently cried, “Enough! Fan no longer the flame that consumes me.\r\nThis is not the death I long for; it comes with all too much pleasure\r\nand delight.” Thus it continued. But the spirit of impurity wove the\r\nmost sensual, lascivious fancies, and she was several times near losing\r\nher chastity.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with Elizabeth of Genton. As a result of whipping she\r\nactually passed into a state of bacchanalian madness. As a rule, she\r\nrested when, excited by unusual flagellation, she believed herself\r\nunited with her “ideal.” This condition was so exquisitely pleasant to\r\nher that she would frequently cry out, “O love, O eternal love, O love,\r\nO you creatures! cry out with me, love, love!”\r\n\r\nIt is known, on the authority of Taxil (_op. cit._, p. 175), that rakes\r\nsometimes have themselves flagellated, or pricked until blood flows,\r\njust before the sexual act, in order to stimulate their diminished\r\nsexual power.\r\n\r\nThese facts find an interesting confirmation in the following\r\nexperiences, taken from Paullini’s “Flagellum Salutis” (1st ed., 1698;\r\nreproduction, Stuttgart, 1847):—\r\n\r\n“There are some nations, viz., the Persians and Russians, where the\r\nwomen regard blows as a peculiar sign of love and favor. Strangely\r\nenough, the Russian women are never more pleased and delighted than when\r\nthey receive hard blows from their husbands, as John Barclay relates in\r\na remarkable narrative. A German, named Jordan, went to Russia, and,\r\npleased with the country, he settled there and took a Russian wife, whom\r\nhe loved dearly and to whom he was always kind in everything. But she\r\nalways wore an expression of dissatisfaction, and went about with sighs\r\nand downcast eyes. The husband asked the reason, for he could not\r\nunderstand what was wrong. ‘Aye,’ she said, ‘though you love me you do\r\nnot show me any sign of it.’ He embraced her and begged to be told what\r\nhe had carelessly and unconsciously done to hurt her feelings, and to be\r\nforgiven, for he would never do it again. ‘I want nothing,’ was the\r\nanswer, ‘but what is customary in our country,—the whip, the real sign\r\nof love.’ Jordan observed the custom and accustomed himself to it, and\r\nthen his wife began to love him dearly. Similar stories are told by\r\nPeter Petrius, of Erlesund, with the addition that the husbands,\r\nimmediately after the wedding, among other indispensable household\r\narticles, provide themselves with whips.”\r\n\r\nOn page 73 of this remarkable book, the author says further: “The\r\ncelebrated Count of Mirindula, John Picus, relates of one of his\r\nintimate acquaintances that he was an insatiable fellow, but so lazy and\r\nincapable of love that he was practically impotent until he had been\r\nroughly handled. The more he tried to satisfy his desire, the heavier\r\nthe blows he needed, and he could not attain his desire until he had\r\nbeen whipped until the blood came. For this purpose he had a suitable\r\nwhip made, which was placed in vinegar the day before using it. He would\r\ngive this to his companion and on bended knees beg her not to spare him,\r\nbut to strike blows with it, the heavier the better. The good count\r\nthought this singular man found the pleasure of love in this punishment.\r\nWhile in other respects he was not a bad man, he understood and hated\r\nhis weakness. Coelius Rhodigin relates a similar story, as does also the\r\ncelebrated jurist, Andreas Tiraquell. In the time of the skillful\r\nphysician, Otten Brunfelsen, there lived in Munich, then the Capital of\r\nthe Bavarian Electorate, a debauchee who could never perform his\r\n[sexual] duties without a severe preparatory beating. Thomas Barthelin\r\nalso knew a Venetian who had to be beaten and driven before he could\r\nhave intercourse,—just as Cupid himself moved reluctantly driven by his\r\nfollowers with sprays of hyacinth. A few years ago there was in Lübeck a\r\ncheesemonger, living on Mill Street, who, on a complaint to the\r\nauthorities of unfaithfulness, was ordered to leave the city. The\r\nprostitute with whom he had been went to the judges and begged in his\r\nbehalf, telling how difficult all intercourse had become for him. He\r\ncould do nothing until he had been mercilessly beaten. At first the\r\nfellow, from shame and to avoid disgrace, would not confess, but after\r\nearnest questioning he could not deny it. There is said to have been a\r\nman in the Netherlands who was similarly incapable, and could do nothing\r\nwithout blows. On the decree of the authorities, however, he was not\r\nonly removed from his position, but also properly punished. A credible\r\nfriend, a physician in an important city of the kingdom, told me, on\r\nJuly 14th, last year, how a woman of bad character had told a companion,\r\nwho had been in the hospital a short time before, that she, with another\r\nwoman of like character, had been sent to the woods by a man who\r\nfollowed them there, cut rods for them, and then exposed his nates,\r\ncommanding them to belabor him well. This they did. It is easy to\r\nconclude what he then did with them. Not only men have been excited and\r\ninflamed to lasciviousness, but also women, that they too might\r\nexperience greater intensity of pleasure. For this reason the Roman\r\nwoman had herself whipped and beaten by the _lupercis_. Thus Juvenal\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n                        “‘Steriles moriuntur, et illis\r\n              Turgida non prodest condita psycido Lyde:\r\n              Nec prodest agili palmas præbere Luperco.’”\r\n\r\nIn men, as well as in women, erection and orgasm, or even ejaculation,\r\nmay be induced by irritation of various other regions of the skin and\r\nmucous membrane. These “erogenous” zones in woman are, while she is a\r\nvirgin, the clitoris, and, after defloration, the vagina and cervix\r\nuteri.\r\n\r\nIn woman the nipple particularly seems to possess this quality.\r\nTitillatio hujus regionis plays an important part in the _ars erotica_.\r\nIn his “Topographical Anatomy,” 1865, Bd. i, p. 552, Hyrtl cites Val.\r\nHildebrandt, who observed a peculiar anomaly of the sexual instinct in a\r\ngirl, which he called _suctusstupratio_. She had her mammæ sucked by her\r\nlover, and finally, by gradually drawing on her nipples, she became able\r\nto suck them herself,—an act that gave her most intense pleasure. Hyrtl\r\nalso calls attention to the fact that cows sometimes suck the milk from\r\ntheir own udders. L. Brunn (_Zeitg. f. Literatur_, etc., d. Hamburg.\r\nCorrespondent, 1889, Nr. 21), in an interesting article on “Sensuality\r\nand Love of Kin,” points out how zealously the nursing mother gives\r\nherself to nursing the babe, “for love of the weak, undeveloped,\r\nhelpless being.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to assume that, by the side of the ethical motives, the fact\r\nthat the sucking may be attended by feelings of physical pleasure plays\r\na part. The remark of Brunn, which is correct in itself, but one-sided,\r\nthat, according to Houzeau’s experience, among the majority of animals\r\nit is only during the time of nursing that the relations between mother\r\nand offspring are close, and thereafter indifferent, also speaks in\r\nfavor of this assumption.\r\n\r\nBastian found the same thing (blunting of the feeling for the offspring\r\nafter weaning) among savages.\r\n\r\nUnder pathological conditions, as is shown by Chambard, among others, in\r\nhis thesis for the doctorate, other portions of the body (in hysterical\r\npersons) about the mammæ and genitals may attain the significance of\r\n“erogenous” zones.\r\n\r\nIn man, physiologically, the only “erogenous” zone is the glans penis,\r\nand, perhaps, the skin of the external genitals.\r\n\r\nUnder pathological conditions the anus may become an “erogenous” area.\r\nThus anal auto-masturbation, which seems to be only too frequent, and\r\npassive pederasty would be explained. (Comp. Gamier, “Anomalies\r\nsexuelles,” Paris, p. 514; F. Moll, “Conträre Sexualempfindung,” p.\r\n163.)\r\n\r\nThe psycho-physiological process comprehended in the idea of sexual\r\ninstinct is composed of (1) concepts awakened centrally or peripherally;\r\n(2) the pleasurable feelings associated with them.\r\n\r\nThe longing for sexual satisfaction (libido sexualis) arises from them.\r\nThis desire grows stronger constantly, in proportion as the excitation\r\nof the cerebral sphere accentuates the feeling of pleasure by\r\nappropriate concepts and activity of the imagination; and the\r\npleasurable sensations are increased to lustful feeling by excitation of\r\nthe erection centre and the consequent hyperæmia of the genitals\r\n(entrance of liquor prostaticus into the urethra, etc.).\r\n\r\nIf circumstances are favorable for the performance of the sexual act\r\nsatisfactorily, the constantly-increasing desire is complied with; if,\r\nhowever, conditions are unfavorable, inhibitory concepts occur, overcome\r\nthe sexual longing, and prevent the sexual act.\r\n\r\nTo civilized man cultivation of a readiness with ideas which inhibit\r\nsexual desire is necessary and distinctive. The moral freedom of the\r\nindividual, and the decision whether, under certain circumstances,\r\nexcess, and even crime, be committed or not, depend, on the one hand,\r\nupon the strength of the instinctive concepts and the accompanying\r\norganic sensations; on the other, upon the power of the inhibitory\r\nconcepts. Constitution and, especially, organic influences have a marked\r\neffect upon the instinctive impulses; education and cultivation of\r\nself-control have a decisive influence on the opposing concepts.\r\n\r\nThe exciting and inhibitory powers are variable quantities.\r\nOver-indulgence in alcohol in this respect is very fatal, since it\r\nawakens and increases libido sexualis, while at the same time it reduces\r\nmoral resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ACT OF COHABITATION.[27]\r\n\r\nThe essential condition for the man is sufficient erection. Anjel\r\n(_Arch. für Psych._, viii, H. 2) calls attention to the fact that in\r\nsexual excitement the erection centre is not alone influenced,—the\r\nnervous excitement is distributed to the entire vasomotor system of\r\nnerves. The proof of this is the turgescence of the organs in the sexual\r\nact, injection of the conjunctiva, prominence of the eyes, dilatation of\r\nthe pupils, and cardiac palpitation (resulting from paralysis of the\r\nvasomotor nerves of the heart, which arise from the cervical\r\nsympathetic, and the consequent dilatation of the cardiac arteries, and\r\nthe increased stimulation of the cardiac ganglia induced by the\r\nconsequent hyperæmia of the cardiac walls). The sexual act is\r\naccompanied by a pleasurable feeling, which, in the male, is conditioned\r\nby the passage of semen through the _ductus ejaculatorii_ to the\r\nurethra, caused by sensory stimulation of the genitals. The pleasurable\r\nsensation occurs earlier in the male than in the female, grows rapidly\r\nin intensity until the moment of commencement of ejaculation, reaching\r\nits height in the instant of free emission, and disappears quickly _post\r\nejaculationem_.\r\n\r\nIn the female the pleasurable feeling occurs later and comes on more\r\nslowly, and generally outlasts the act of ejaculation.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive event in coitus is ejaculation. This function is\r\ndependent on a centre (genito-spinal), which Budge has shown to be\r\nsituated at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. It is a reflex\r\ncentre. The stimulus that excites it is the ejection of sperma from\r\nthe vesiculæ seminales into the pars membranacea urethræ, which\r\nfollows reflexly from stimulation of the glans penis. As soon as the\r\ncollection of semen, with ever-increasing pleasurable sensation, has\r\nreached a sufficient amount to be effectual as a stimulus of the\r\nejaculation-centre, the centre acts. The reflex motor path lies in the\r\nfourth and fifth lumbar nerves. The action consists of a convulsive\r\nexcitation of the bulbo-cavernosus muscle (innervated by the third and\r\nfourth sacral nerves), which forces the semen out.\r\n\r\nIn the female as well, at the height of sexual and pleasurable\r\nexcitement, a reflex movement occurs. It is induced by stimulation of\r\nthe sensory genital nerves, and consists of a peristaltic movement in\r\nthe tubes and uterus as far down as the portio vaginalis, which presses\r\nout the mucous secretions of the tubes and uterus. Inhibition of the\r\nejaculation centre is possible as a result of cortical influence (want\r\nof desire in coitus, emotions in general; influence of the will, in a\r\nmeasure).\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, with the completion of the sexual act, libido\r\nsexualis and erection disappear, and the psychical and sexual excitement\r\ngives place to a comfortable feeling of lassitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      III. GENERAL PATHOLOGY.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbnormality of the sexual functions proves to be especially frequent in\r\ncivilized races. This fact is explained in part by the frequent abuse of\r\nthe sexual organs, and in part by the circumstance that such functional\r\nanomalies are often the signs of an abnormal constitution of the central\r\nnervous system, which is, for the most part, hereditary (“functional\r\nsigns of degeneration”).\r\n\r\nSince the generative organs stand in important functional connection\r\nwith the entire nervous system, and especially with its psychical and\r\nsomatic functions, it is easy to understand the frequency of general\r\nneuroses and psychoses arising in sexual (functional or organic)\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\n                     SCHEMA OF THE SEXUAL NEUROSES.\r\n\r\n                        }                       }_a._ Anæsthesia.\r\n                        }1.

SPINAL NEUROSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _1. Affections of the Erection Centre._\r\n\r\n(a) _Irritation_ (priapism) arises reflexly from peripheral sensory\r\nirritants (_e.g._, gonorrhœa); directly, from organic irritation of the\r\nnerve-tracts from the brain to the erection centre (spinal disease in\r\nthe lower cervical and upper dorsal regions), or of the centre itself\r\n(certain poisons); or from psychical irritation. In the latter case\r\nsatyriasis exists, _i.e._, abnormal duration of erection, with libido\r\nsexualis. In simply reflex or direct organic irritation, libido sexualis\r\nmay be wanting, and the priapism be accompanied by unpleasant feelings.\r\n\r\n(b) _Paralysis_ from destruction of the centre or of the nerve-tracts\r\n(nervi erigentes), in diseases of the spinal cord (paralytic impotence).\r\nA milder form is that of lessened excitability of the centre, resulting\r\nfrom overstimulation (in sexual excesses, especially in onanism), or\r\nfrom alcoholic intoxication, abuse of bromides, etc. It may be\r\naccompanied by cerebral anæsthesia, and often with anæsthesia of the\r\nexternal genitals. Cerebral hyperæsthesia is here more frequent\r\n(increased libido sexualis, lust). A peculiar form of diminished\r\nexcitability is shown in those cases where the centre responds only to\r\ncertain stimuli. Thus there are men for whom sexual contact with their\r\nvirtuous wives does not supply the necessary stimulus for the excitation\r\nof an erection, but in whom it occurs when the act is attempted with a\r\nprostitute, or in the form of some unnatural sexual act. As far as\r\npsychical stimuli are here concerned, they may be inadequate (_v.\r\ninfra_, paræsthesia and perversion of sexual instinct).\r\n\r\n(c) _Inhibition._ The erection centre may become functionally incapable\r\nas a result of cerebral influence. This inhibitory influence is an\r\nemotion (disgust, fear of contagion), or an idea[30] of impotence. There\r\nare many men in the first condition who have an unconquerable loathing\r\nfor their wives, or fear of infection, or are suffering with perverse\r\nsexual feelings. In the latter condition are neuropathic individuals\r\n(neurasthenics, hypochondriacs), frequently weakened sexually\r\n(masturbators), who have reason, or think they have, to mistrust their\r\nsexual power. This idea acts as an inhibitory concept, and makes the act\r\nwith the person concerned of the opposite sex temporarily or absolutely\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n(d) _Irritable weakness._ In this condition there is abnormal\r\nimpressionability of the centre, but accompanied by rapid diminution of\r\nits energy. There may be functional disturbance of the centre itself, or\r\nweakness of the innervation through the nervi erigentes; or there may be\r\nweakness of the ischio-cavernosus muscle. Cases in which the erection is\r\nineffectual, on account of abnormally early ejaculation, form a\r\ntransition to the following anomalies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n               _2. Affections of the Ejaculation Centre._\r\n\r\n(a) _Abnormally easy ejaculation_ from absence of cerebral inhibition,\r\nresulting from excessive psychical excitement or irritable weakness of\r\nthe centre. In this case, under certain circumstances, the simple\r\nconception of a lascivious situation is sufficient to set the centre in\r\naction (high degree of spinal neurasthenia, usually resulting from\r\nsexual abuse). A third possibility is hyperæsthesia of the urethra, by\r\nvirtue of which, when the semen enters it, an immediate and excessive\r\nreflex action of the ejaculation centre is induced. In such a case,\r\nsimple proximity to the female genitals may be sufficient to induce\r\nejaculation (_ante portam_).\r\n\r\nIn case of hyperæsthesia of the urethra as a cause, the ejaculation may\r\nbe accompanied by painful, instead of pleasurable, sensations. Usually,\r\nin cases where there is hyperæsthesia of the urethra, there is, at the\r\nsame time, irritable weakness of the centre. Both functional\r\ndisturbances are important in the production of pollutio nimia and\r\ndiurna.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying pleasurable feeling may be pathologically absent. This\r\noccurs in defective men and women (anæsthesia, aspermia?), and, further,\r\nas a result of disease (neurasthenia, hysteria); or (in prostitutes) it\r\nfollows overstimulation and the blunting thus induced. The intensity of\r\nthe pleasurable feeling depends on the degree of psychical and motor\r\nexcitement accompanying the sexual act. Under pathological conditions\r\nthis may become so pronounced that the movements of coitus take on the\r\ncharacter of involuntary convulsive movements, and even pass into\r\ngeneral convulsions.\r\n\r\n(b) _Abnormally difficult ejaculation._ It is occasioned by\r\ninexcitability of the centre (absence of libido, paralysis of the\r\ncentre: organic, from disease of brain or spinal cord; functional, from\r\nsexual abuses, marasmus, diabetes, morphinism), and, in this case, for\r\nthe most part, in connection with anæsthesia of the genitals and\r\nparalysis of the erection centre. Or it is the result of a lesion of the\r\nreflex arc, or of peripheral anæsthesia (urethra), or of aspermia. The\r\nejaculation occurs not at all, or tardily, in the course of the sexual\r\nact, or only afterward, in the form of a pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        III. CEREBRAL NEUROSES.\r\n\r\n1. _Paradoxia_, _i.e._, sexual excitement occurring independently of the\r\nperiod of the physiological processes in the generative organs.\r\n\r\n2. _Anæsthesia_ (absence of sexual instinct). Here all organic impulses\r\narising in the sexual organs, as well as all concepts, and visual,\r\nauditory, and olfactory sense-impressions, fail to excite the individual\r\nsexually. This is physiological in childhood and old age.\r\n\r\n3. _Hyperæsthesia_ (increased desire, satyriasis). In this state there\r\nis an abnormally increased impressionability of the vita sexualis to\r\norganic, psychical, and sensory stimuli (abnormally intense libido,\r\nlustfulness, lasciviousness). The stimulus may be central (nymphomania,\r\nsatyriasis) or peripheral, functional or organic.\r\n\r\n4. _Paræsthesia_, (perversion of the sexual instinct, _i.e._,\r\nexcitability of the sexual functions to inadequate stimuli).\r\n\r\nThese cerebral anomalies fall within the domain of psychopathology. The\r\nspinal and peripheral anomalies may occur in combination with them, but\r\nthese affect persons, as a rule, that are free from mental disease. They\r\nmay occur in various combinations, and become the cause of sexual\r\ncrimes. For this reason, they demand consideration in the following\r\ndescription. However, the cerebral anomalies claim the principal\r\ninterest, since they very frequently lead to the commission of perverse\r\nand even criminal acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A. PARADOXIA. SEXUAL INSTINCT MANIFESTING ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY OF\r\n                        PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _1. Sexual Instinct Manifested in Childhood._\r\n\r\nEvery physician conversant with nervous affections and diseases incident\r\nto childhood is aware of the fact that manifestation of sexual instinct\r\nmay occur in very young children. The observations of Ultzmann\r\nconcerning masturbation in childhood[31] are worthy of attention in\r\nrelation to it. It is necessary here to differentiate between the\r\nnumerous cases where, as a result of phimosis, balanitis, or oxyuris in\r\nrectum or vagina, young children have itching of the genitals, and\r\nexperience a kind of pleasurable sensation from manipulations thus\r\ninduced, and thus come to practice masturbation; and those cases in\r\nwhich sexual ideas and impulses occur in the child as a result of\r\ncerebral processes without peripheral causes. It is only in this latter\r\nclass of cases that we have to do with the early manifestation of sexual\r\ninstinct. In such cases it may always be regarded as an accompanying\r\nsymptom of a neuro-psychopathic constitutional condition. A case of\r\nMarc’s (“Die Geisteskrankheiten,” etc., von Ideler, i, p. 66)\r\nillustrates very well these conditions. The subject was a girl of eight\r\nyears, of respectable family, who was devoid of all child-like and moral\r\nfeelings, and had masturbated from her fourth year; at the same time she\r\nconsorted with boys of the age of ten or twelve. She had thought of\r\nkilling her parents, that she might become her own mistress and give\r\nherself up to pleasure with men. In these cases of early manifestation\r\nof libido the children come also to masturbate; and, since they are\r\ngreatly predisposed constitutionally, they frequently sink into\r\ndementia, or become subjects of severe degenerative neuroses or\r\npsychoses.\r\n\r\n  Lombroso (_Archiv di Psichiatria_, iv, p. 22) has collected a number\r\n  of cases of children affected with very decided hereditary taint,\r\n  which belong in this category. One was that of a girl who masturbated\r\n  shamelessly and almost constantly at the age of three. Another girl\r\n  began at the age of eight, and continued to practice masturbation when\r\n  married, and even during pregnancy. She was pregnant twelve times.\r\n  Five of the children died early, four were hydrocephalic, and two boys\r\n  began to masturbate,—one at the age of seven, the other at the age of\r\n  four.\r\n\r\n  Zambaco (_L’Encéphale_, 1882, Nr. 1, 2) tells the disgusting story of\r\n  two sisters affected with premature and perverse sexual desire. The\r\n  elder, R., masturbated at the age of seven, practiced lewdness with\r\n  boys, stole wherever she could, seduced her four-year-old sister into\r\n  masturbation, and at the age of ten was given up to the practice of\r\n  the most revolting vices. Even _ferrum candens ad clitoridem_ had no\r\n  effect in overcoming the practice, and she masturbated with the\r\n  cassock of a priest while he was exhorting her to reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _2. Re-awakening of Sexual Instinct in Old Age._[32]\r\n\r\nThere are infrequent cases in which the sexual instinct persists until a\r\ngreat age. “Senectus non quidem annis sed viribus magis æstimatur”\r\n(Zittmann). Oesterlen (Maschka, Handb., iii, p. 18) mentions the case of\r\na man aged 83, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by a\r\nWurtemberg court on account of sexual misdemeanors. Unfortunately\r\nnothing is said of the nature of the crime or of the mental condition of\r\nthe criminal.[33]\r\n\r\nThe manifestation of sexual instinct in old age is not in itself\r\npathological; but presumption of pathological conditions must\r\nnecessarily be entertained when the individual is decrepit and his\r\nsexual life has already long become extinct; and when the impulse, in a\r\nman whose sexual needs were in his early life, perhaps, not very marked,\r\nmanifests itself with greater strength, and strives for even perverse\r\nsatisfaction in a shameless and impulsive manner. In such cases there is\r\nat once suggested a presumption of pathological conditions. Medical\r\nscience recognizes the fact that such an impulse depends upon the morbid\r\nalterations of the brain which lead to senile dementia. This abnormal\r\nmanifestation of sexual life may be the precursor of senile dementia,\r\nand make its appearance even long before there are any well-defined\r\nmanifestations of intellectual weakness. The attentive and experienced\r\nobserver will always be able to detect in this prodromal stage an\r\nalteration of character _in pejus_, and a deterioration of the moral\r\nsense accompanying the peculiar sexual manifestation.\r\n\r\nThe libido of those passing into senile dementia is at first expressed\r\nin lascivious speech and gesture. The next objects of the attempts of\r\nthese senile subjects of brain atrophy and psychical degeneration are\r\nchildren. This sad and dangerous fact is explained by the better\r\nopportunity they have of falling in with children, but more especially\r\nby a feeling of imperfect sexual power. Defective sexual power and\r\ngreatly diminished moral sense explain the additional fact of the\r\nperversity of the sexual acts of these aged men. They are the\r\nequivalents of the impossible physiological act.\r\n\r\nThe annals of legal medicine distinguish, as such, exhibition of the\r\ngenitals,[34] lustful handling of the genitals of children,[35] inducing\r\nthem to perform manustupration of the seducer, and performing\r\nmasturbation[36] or flagellation on the victim.\r\n\r\nIn this stage the intellect may still be sufficiently intact to allow\r\navoidance of publicity and discovery, while the moral sense is too far\r\ngone to allow consideration of the moral significance of the act and\r\nresistance to the impulse. With the progress of dementia, these acts are\r\nmore and more shamelessly committed. Then care on account of defective\r\nsexual power disappears, and adults also become the objects of the\r\nsenile passion; but the defective sexual power necessitates equivalents\r\nfor coitus. Not infrequently sodomy results, and, as Tarnowsky (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 77) points out, in the sexual act performed with geese,\r\nchickens, etc., the sight of the dying animal and its death-struggles at\r\nthe time of coitus afford complete satisfaction. The perverse sexual\r\nacts with adults are quite as horrible, and may be explained\r\npsychologically in the same way.\r\n\r\nCase 49, in the author’s “Text-Book of Legal Psychopathology,” second\r\ned., p. 161, demonstrates how enormously increased sexual lust may be\r\nduring the course of senile dementia. Quum senex libidinosus germanam\r\nsuam filiam æmulatione motus necaret et adspectu pectoris sciosi puellæ\r\nmoribundæ delectaretur.\r\n\r\nErotic delirium and states of satyriasis may occur, in the course of the\r\nmalady, with or without maniacal episodes, as the following case shows:—\r\n\r\n  Case 1. J. René, always given to indulgence in sensuality and sexual\r\n  pleasures, but always with regard for decorum, has shown, since his\r\n  seventy-sixth year, a progressive loss of intelligence and increasing\r\n  perversion of his moral sense. Previously bright and outwardly moral,\r\n  he now wasted his property in concourse with prostitutes, frequented\r\n  brothels only, asked every woman on the street to marry him or allow\r\n  coitus, and thus became so publicly obnoxious that it was necessary to\r\n  place him in an asylum. There the sexual excitement increased to a\r\n  veritable satyriasis, which lasted until he died. He masturbated\r\n  continuously, even before others; took delight only in obscene ideas;\r\n  thought the men about him were women, and followed them with indecent\r\n  proposals (Legrand du Saulle, “La Folie,” p. 533).\r\n\r\n  Moreover, women previously moral, when affected with senile dementia,\r\n  may manifest similar conditions of great sexual excitement\r\n  (nymphomania, furor uterinus).\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from a reading of Schopenhauer,[37] that, as a result of\r\nsenile dementia, the abnormally excited and perverse instinct may be\r\ndirected exclusively to persons of the same sex (_v. infra_). The manner\r\nof the satisfaction is here passive pederasty, or, as I ascertained in\r\nthe following case, mutual masturbation:—\r\n\r\n  Case 2. Mr. X., aged 80, of high social position, from a family having\r\n  hereditary taint. He was always very sensual and a cynic, of\r\n  uncontrollable temper, and, according to his own confession, as a\r\n  young man, preferred masturbation to coitus. However, he never showed\r\n  signs of contrary sexual instinct, and kept mistresses, raising a\r\n  child by one. At the age of forty-eight he married, out of\r\n  inclination, and begat six children, and never gave his wife cause for\r\n  complaint. I could obtain but an incomplete history of his family. It\r\n  was certain that his brother was suspected of love for men, and that a\r\n  nephew became insane as a result of excessive masturbation.\r\n\r\n  The patient, always peculiar and quick-tempered, for years has been\r\n  growing more extreme in character. He has become exceedingly\r\n  suspicious, and slight opposition to his wishes induces attacks of\r\n  anger which may become actual raving, and in which he may raise his\r\n  hand against his wife. For a year there have been unmistakable signs\r\n  of incipient senile dementia. The patient has become forgetful,\r\n  localizes past events incorrectly, and has false ideas of time. For\r\n  fourteen months it has been noticed that he manifests affection for\r\n  certain male servants, especially for a gardener’s boy. Otherwise rude\r\n  and overbearing to servants, he surfeits his favorite with favors and\r\n  presents, and commands his family and his house officials to treat the\r\n  boy with the greatest respect. The aged patient awaits the hour of\r\n  rendezvous in true sexual excitement. He sends his family away, that\r\n  he may be with his favorite undisturbed, and remains shut up with him\r\n  for hours; and when the doors are opened again, he is found lying on\r\n  the bed exhausted. Besides this object of his passion, the patient had\r\n  intercourse episodically with other servants. It is certain that he\r\n  enticed them, asked them for kisses, exhibited himself, allowed\r\n  manipulation ad genitalia, and practiced mutual masturbation. By these\r\n  practices absolute demoralization was brought about. The family was\r\n  powerless; for any opposition caused violent outbreaks of anger and\r\n  even threats against his relatives. The patient was completely without\r\n  appreciation of his perverse sexual acts; and therefore the only\r\n  course left to the afflicted family was to remove all authority from\r\n  his hands and place him in an asylum. No erotic inclination toward the\r\n  opposite sex was observed, though the patient occupied a\r\n  sleeping-apartment with his wife. With reference to the perverse\r\n  sexuality and the defective moral sense of this unfortunate man, it is\r\n  worthy of note that he questioned the servants of his daughter-in-law\r\n  as to whether she had a lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n          B. ANÆSTHESIA SEXUALIS (ABSENCE OF SEXUAL FEELING).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _1. As a Congenital Anomaly._\r\n\r\nOnly those cases can be regarded as unquestionable examples of absence\r\nof sexual instinct dependent on cerebral causes, in which, in spite of\r\ngenerative organs normally developed and the performance of their\r\nfunctions (secretion of semen, menstruation), the corresponding emotions\r\nof sexual life are absolutely wanting. These functionally sexless\r\nindividuals are seldom seen, and are, indeed, always persons having\r\ndegenerative defects, and in whom other functional cerebral\r\ndisturbances, states of psychical degeneration, and even anatomical\r\nsigns of degeneration, are observed. Legrand du Saulle describes a\r\nclassical case that falls under this head (_Annales médico-psychol._,\r\nMay, 1876).\r\n\r\n  Case 3. D., aged 33, had a mother who suffered with insanity of\r\n  persecution. The mother’s father also suffered with persecutory\r\n  insanity, and committed suicide. Her mother was insane, and this\r\n  woman’s mother became insane in the puerperal state. Three of her\r\n  mother’s children died in babyhood, and those that lived longer had an\r\n  abnormal character. As early as his thirteenth year, D. was troubled\r\n  with the thought of becoming insane. At fourteen he attempted suicide.\r\n  Later, vagabondage, and, as a soldier, repeated insubordination and\r\n  crazy pranks. His intelligence was very limited; no sign of\r\n  degeneration, genitals normal. At seventeen or eighteen he had\r\n  emissions of semen, had never masturbated or had sexual feeling, and\r\n  never had sought intercourse with women.\r\n\r\n  Case 4. P., aged 36, common laborer, was received at my clinic in the\r\n  beginning of November on account of spastic spinal paralysis. He\r\n  declares he comes of a healthy family. A stutterer from his youth.\r\n  Cranium microcephalic (cf. 53 cm.). Patient somewhat imbecile. He was\r\n  never sociable, never had a sexual emotion. The sight of a woman never\r\n  had anything enticing for him. He never had a desire to masturbate.\r\n  Erections frequent, but only on waking in the morning with a full\r\n  bladder, and without a trace of sexual feeling. Pollutions very\r\n  infrequent,—about once a year, in sleep,—and usually while dreaming\r\n  that he is concerned with a female. These dreams, however, as his\r\n  dreams in general, are not markedly erotic. He says the act of\r\n  pollution is not accompanied by any pleasurable sensation. Patient\r\n  does not feel this absence of sexual sensations. He gives the\r\n  assurance that his brother, aged 34, is in exactly the same sexual\r\n  condition as himself, and he makes it seem probable that a sister,\r\n  aged 21, is in a similar state. A younger brother, he says, is normal\r\n  sexually. The examination of his genitals reveals nothing abnormal\r\n  besides phimosis.\r\n\r\nHammond (“Sexual Impotence”), even with his wide experience, reports\r\nonly the following three cases of anæsthesia sexualis:—\r\n\r\n  Case 5. Mr. W., aged 33; strong, healthy, with normal genitals. He had\r\n  never experienced libido, and had vainly sought to awaken his\r\n  defective sexual instinct by means of obscene stories and intercourse\r\n  with prostitutes. On the occasion of such attempts he experienced only\r\n  disgust, with even a feeling of nausea, and became nervously and\r\n  mentally exhausted. Only once, when he forced the situation, did he\r\n  have a transitory erection. W. had never masturbated, and had had\r\n  pollutions about once every two months from his seventeenth year.\r\n  Important interests demanded that he marry. He had no _horror feminæ_,\r\n  and longed for a home and a wife, but felt that he was incapable of\r\n  the sexual act. He died, unmarried, in the American civil war.\r\n\r\n  Case 6. X., aged 27; genitals normal; never felt libido. Mechanical or\r\n  thermic stimuli easily induced erection, but instead of libido\r\n  sexualis there was regularly a desire for alcoholic indulgence. Such\r\n  excesses also induced erections, and he then sometimes masturbated. He\r\n  had a disinclination for women and a loathing of coitus. If, with an\r\n  erection, he made an attempt at coitus, it disappeared at once. Death\r\n  in coma during an attack of cerebral hyperæmia.\r\n\r\n  Case 7. Mrs. O., normally developed, healthy, menstruated regularly;\r\n  aged 35, fifteen years married. She never experienced libido, and\r\n  never had any erotic excitement in sexual intercourse with her\r\n  husband. She was not averse to coitus, and sometimes seemed to\r\n  experience pleasure in it, but she never had a wish for repetition of\r\n  cohabitation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with such pure cases of anæsthesia there should be\r\nconsidered other cases in which the mental side of the vita sexualis is\r\na blank leaf in the life of the individual, but where elementary sexual\r\nsensations manifest themselves at least in masturbation (comp. the\r\ntransitional Case 6). According to Magnan’s ingenious classification,\r\nwhich, however, is not strictly correct and somewhat too dogmatic, in\r\nsuch cases the sexual life is so limited as to be designated spinal.\r\nPossibly in some such cases there exists virtually a mental side of the\r\nvita sexualis, but it is very weak, and undermined by masturbation\r\nbefore it attains development. These represent the transitional cases\r\nfrom the congenital to the acquired (psychical) anæsthesia sexualis.\r\nThis danger threatens many masturbators of vicious constitution. It is\r\npsychologically interesting that when the sexual element is early\r\nvitiated, then an ethical defect is manifested.\r\n\r\nThe two following cases, previously published by me in the _Archiv für\r\nPsychiatrie_, vii, are given here as illustrations worthy of\r\nconsideration:—\r\n\r\n  Case 8. F. J., aged 19, student; mother was nervous, sister epileptic.\r\n  At the age of four, acute brain affection, lasting two weeks. As a\r\n  child he was not affectionate, and was cold toward his parents; as a\r\n  student he was peculiar, retiring, preoccupied with self, and given to\r\n  much reading. Well endowed mentally. Masturbation from fifteenth year.\r\n  Eccentric after puberty, with continual alternation between religious\r\n  enthusiasm and materialism,—now studying theology, now natural\r\n  sciences. At the university his fellow-students took him for a fool.\r\n  He read Jean Paul almost exclusively, and wasted his time. Absolute\r\n  absence of sexual feeling toward the opposite sex. Once he indulged in\r\n  intercourse, experienced no sexual feeling in the act, found coitus\r\n  absurd, and did not repeat it. Without any emotional cause whatever,\r\n  he often had a thought of suicide. He made it the subject of a\r\n  philosophical dissertation, in which he contended that it was, like\r\n  masturbation, a justifiable act. After repeated experiments, which he\r\n  made on himself with various poisons, he attempted suicide with\r\n  fifty-seven grains of opium; but he was saved, and sent to an asylum.\r\n\r\n  Patient is destitute of moral and social feelings. His writings\r\n  disclose incredible frivolity and vulgarity. His knowledge is of a\r\n  wide range, but his logic is peculiarly distorted. There is no trace\r\n  of emotionality. He treats everything (even the sublime) with\r\n  incomparable cynicism and irony. He pleads for the justification of\r\n  suicide with false philosophical premises and conclusions, and, as one\r\n  would speak of the most indifferent affair, he declares that he\r\n  intends to accomplish it. He regrets that his penknife has been taken\r\n  from him. If he had it he would open his veins as Seneca did,—in the\r\n  bath. A short time before a friend had given him, instead of a poison\r\n  as he supposed, a cathartic. Instead of having been a means to send\r\n  him to the other world, it had sent him to the water-closet. Only the\r\n  Great Operator could eradicate his foolish and fatal idea by removing\r\n  his senses, etc.\r\n\r\n  The patient has a large, rhombic, distorted skull, the left half of\r\n  the forehead being flatter than the right. The occiput is very\r\n  straight. Ears far back, widely projecting, and the external meatus\r\n  forms a narrow slit. Genitals very lax; testicles unusually soft and\r\n  small.\r\n\r\n  Now and then the patient suffers with onomatomania. He is compelled to\r\n  think of the most useless problems and give up to an interminable\r\n  distressing and worrying thought; and is so fatigued after it that he\r\n  is no longer capable of any rational thought. After some months the\r\n  patient was sent home unimproved. There he spent his time in reading\r\n  and frivolities, and busied himself with the thought of founding a new\r\n  Christianity, because Christ had been subject to grand delusions and\r\n  had deceived the world with wonders (!). After remaining at home some\r\n  years the sudden occurrence of a maniacal outbreak brought him again\r\n  to the asylum. He presented a mixture of primordial delirium of\r\n  persecution (devil, anti-christ, persecution, poisoning, persecutory\r\n  voices) and delusions of grandeur (Christ, redemption of the world),\r\n  with impulsive, incoherent actions. After five months there was a\r\n  remission of this intercurrent acute mental disease, and the patient\r\n  returned to the level of his original intellectual peculiarity and\r\n  moral defect.\r\n\r\n  Case 9. E., aged 30, journeyman-painter, was arrested while trying to\r\n  cut off the scrotum of a boy he had caught in the woods. He gave as a\r\n  motive for this act that he wished to cut into it in order that the\r\n  world should not multiply. Often in his youth, with like purpose, he\r\n  had cut into his own genitals.\r\n\r\n  It is impossible to learn anything of his ancestry. From his childhood\r\n  he was mentally abnormal, violent, never lively, very irritable,\r\n  irascible, selfish, and weak-minded. He hated women, loved solitude,\r\n  and read much. He sometimes laughed to himself and did silly things.\r\n  Of late years his hatred of women had increased, especially of those\r\n  that were pregnant, they being responsible for the misery of the\r\n  world. He also hated children, and cursed his father. He entertained\r\n  communistic ideas, and berated the rich and the ministry, and God, who\r\n  had allowed him to come into the world so poor. He declared that it\r\n  would be better to castrate all children than to allow others to come\r\n  into the world that could only be fated to endure poverty and misery.\r\n  He had always had the intention, from his fifteenth year, to castrate\r\n  himself, in order to have no part in increasing unhappiness and adding\r\n  to the number of men. He hated the female sex because it was a means\r\n  of procreation. Only twice in his life had he allowed women to\r\n  practice manustupration on him, and, with the exception of this, he\r\n  had never had anything to do with them. Occasionally he had sexual\r\n  desire, but never for a natural satisfaction of it. When nature did\r\n  not help him, he occasionally helped himself by means of masturbation.\r\n\r\n  He is a powerful, muscular man. The formation of the genitals presents\r\n  no abnormality. On the scrotum and penis are numerous scars, which\r\n  resulted from his attempts at self-emasculation, but which, he\r\n  asserts, were not carried out on account of pain. Genu valgum of right\r\n  limb. No evidence of onanism could be discovered. He is moody,\r\n  defiant, irritable. Social feelings are absolutely foreign to him.\r\n  With the exception of imperfect sleep and frequent headaches, there\r\n  are no functional disturbances.\r\n\r\nFrom cases of this kind, depending on cerebral causes, there must be\r\ndistinguished others where the absence of function arises from an\r\nabsence or malformation of the generative organs, as in certain\r\nhermaphrodites, idiots, and cretins. A case belonging here is found in\r\nMaschka’s hand-book.\r\n\r\n  Case 10. Complainant pleads for divorce on account of impotence of her\r\n  husband, who has never had intercourse with her. She is thirty-one\r\n  years old, and a virgin. The husband is somewhat weak mentally,\r\n  physically strong; the genitals well developed. He declares that he\r\n  has never had a complete erection or a flow of semen, and says that he\r\n  is totally indifferent about intercourse with women.\r\n\r\nUltzmann’s[38] observations show that anæsthesia sexualis is not caused\r\nby aspermia simply. He shows that even in congenital aspermia the vita\r\nsexualis and sexual power may be entirely satisfying; an additional\r\nproof that defective libido _ab origine_ is to be sought for in cerebral\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe _naturæ frigidas_ of Zacchias are examples of a milder form of\r\nanæsthesia. They are met more frequently among women than among men. The\r\ncharacteristic signs of this anomaly are: slight inclination to sexual\r\nintercourse, or pronounced disinclination to coitus without sexual\r\nequivalent, and failure of corresponding psychical, pleasurable\r\nexcitation during coitus, which is indulged in simply from sense of\r\nduty. I have often had occasion to hear complaints from husbands about\r\nthis. In such cases the wives have always proved to be neuropathic _ab\r\norigine_. Some were at the same time hysterical.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _2. Acquired Anæsthesia._\r\n\r\nAcquired diminution of sexual instinct, extending through all degrees to\r\nextinction, may depend on various causes. These may be organic and\r\nfunctional, psychical and somatic, central and peripheral. The\r\ndiminution of libido, as age advances, and its temporary disappearance\r\nafter the sexual act, are physiological. The variations with reference\r\nto the duration of the sexual instinct are dependent upon individual\r\nfactors. Education and manner of life have a great influence upon the\r\nintensity of the vita sexualis. Intense mental activity (hard study),\r\nphysical exertion, emotional depression, and sexual continence decidedly\r\ndiminish sexual inclination. Continence at first induces increase, but\r\nsooner or later, according to constitutional conditions, the activity of\r\nthe generative organs decreases, and with it libido. At all events, in a\r\nperson sexually mature, a close connection exists between the activity\r\nof the generative glands and the degree of libido. That this relation is\r\nnot determinate is shown by the cases of sensual women, who, after the\r\nclimacterium, continue to have sexual intercourse, and may manifest\r\nstates of sexual excitement (cerebral). Also in eunuchs it is seen that\r\nlibido may long outlast the production of semen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, experience teaches that libido is\r\nessentially conditioned by the function of the generative glands, and\r\nthat the facts mentioned are exceptional manifestations. As peripheral\r\ncauses of diminution or extinction of libido, may be mentioned\r\ncastration, degeneration of the sexual glands, marasmus, sexual excesses\r\nin the form of coitus and masturbation, and alcoholism [cocainism]. In\r\nthe same way, the disappearance of libido in general disturbances of\r\nnutrition (diabetes, morphinism, etc.) may be explained. Finally, the\r\natrophy of the testicles should be remembered, which has sometimes been\r\nobserved to follow focal lesions of the brain (cerebellum).\r\n\r\nA diminution of the vita sexualis, from degeneration of the tracts of\r\nthe cord and genito-spinal centre, occurs in diseases of the spinal cord\r\nand brain. A central interference with the sexual instinct may be\r\norganically induced by cortical disease (dementia paralytica in its\r\nadvanced stages); functionally, by hysteria (central anæsthesia?) and\r\nemotional insanity (melancholia, hypochondria).\r\n\r\n\r\n         C. HYPERÆSTHESIA (ABNORMALLY INCREASED SEXUAL DESIRE).\r\n\r\nPathology has no easy task, in the single case, when it has to decide\r\nwhether the impulse to sexual satisfaction has reached a pathological\r\ndegree. Emminghaus (“Psychopathologie,” p. 225) declares that the\r\nimmediate re-awakening of desire after satisfaction, with its occupation\r\nof the entire attention, and no less the excitation of libido by the\r\nsight of persons and things which in themselves should have but an\r\nindifferent sexual effect, are decidedly abnormal. In general, sexual\r\ninstinct and its corresponding needs are in proportion to physical\r\nstrength and age. Sexual desire rapidly increases after puberty, until\r\nit reaches a marked degree; is strongest from the twentieth to the\r\nfortieth year, and then slowly decreases. Married life seems to preserve\r\nand control the instinct. Sexual intercourse with many persons increases\r\nthe desire.\r\n\r\nSince woman has less sexual need than man, a predominating sexual desire\r\nin her arouses a suspicion of its pathological significance; and the\r\nmore, when this finds expression in desire for adornment, coquetry, or\r\nmale society, which, passing beyond the limits set by good breeding and\r\nmanners, becomes quite noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe constitution, in both sexes, is of the greatest significance. An\r\nabnormally strong sexual instinct is frequently accompanied by a\r\nneuropathic constitution; and such individuals pass a great part of\r\ntheir lives heavily burdened with the weight of this constitutional\r\nanomaly of their sexual life. The power of the sexual impulse in such\r\ncases may at times rise to the importance of an organic necessity, and\r\nreally endanger the freedom of the will. The want of satisfaction of\r\nthis impulsive desire may, under such conditions, induce a condition\r\nallied to actual rutting, or a psychical condition, accompanied by\r\nemotions of fear, in which the individual gives up to the impulse, and\r\nresponsibility becomes doubtful. If the individual does not give up to\r\nhis powerful impulse, he is in danger, by reason of his enforced\r\nabstinence, of ruining his nervous system by inducing a neurasthenia, or\r\nseriously increasing such a condition if it be already present. In\r\nnormally constituted individuals, too, the sexual instinct is an\r\ninconstant quantity. Aside from the temporary indifference following\r\nsatisfaction, and the diminution of sexual desire in long-continued\r\ncontinence after a certain reactionary stage of sexual desire is\r\novercome, the manner of life has a great influence. Those living in\r\nlarge cities, who are constantly reminded of sexual things and incited\r\nto sexual enjoyment, certainly have more sexual desire than those living\r\nin the country. A dissipated, luxurious, sedentary manner of life,\r\npreponderance of animal food, and the consumption of spirits, spices,\r\netc., have a stimulating influence on the sexual life. In woman the\r\nsexual inclination is post-menstrually increased. At this time, in\r\nneuropathic women, the excitement may reach a pathological degree.\r\n\r\nThe great libido of consumptives is remarkable. Hofmann tells of a\r\nconsumptive peasant who satisfied his wife sexually on the evening\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\nThe sexual acts are coitus (eventually rape) and, _faute de mieux_,\r\nmasturbation; and, with defective moral sense, pederasty or bestiality.\r\nIf sexual power is diminished or extinct, with excessive sexual desire,\r\nall manner of perversity of sexual acts becomes possible.\r\n\r\nExcessive libido may be peripherally or centrally induced. The former\r\nmanner of origin is the more infrequent. Pruritus and eczema of the\r\ngenitals may cause it; and likewise certain substances, like\r\ncantharides, which powerfully stimulate sexual desire. Not infrequently,\r\nin women at the climacteric, sexual excitement occurs, occasioned by\r\npruritus; and also in cases where there is neuropathic taint. Magnan\r\n(_Annales médico-psychol._, 1885, p. 157) reports the case of a lady who\r\nwas afflicted mornings with attacks of frightful erethismus genitalis,\r\nand the case of a man, aged 55, who was tormented at night by unbearable\r\npriapism. In each case there was a neurosis.\r\n\r\nThe central origin of sexual excitement is of frequent occurrence[39] in\r\npersons having neurotic taint or hysteria, and in conditions of\r\npsychical exaltation. Here, where the cortex and the psycho-sexual\r\ncentre are in a condition of hyperæsthesia (abnormal excitability of the\r\nimagination, increased ease of association), not only visual and tactile\r\nimpressions, but also auditory and olfactory sensations, may be\r\nsufficient to call up lascivious concepts.\r\n\r\n  Magnan (_op. cit._) reports the case of a young woman who had an\r\n  increasing sexual desire from puberty, and satisfied it by\r\n  masturbation. Gradually she grew to become sexually excited at the\r\n  sight of any man pleasing to her; and, since she was unable to control\r\n  herself, she would sometimes shut herself up in a room until the storm\r\n  had passed. At last she gave herself up to men of her choice, that she\r\n  might get rest from her tormenting desire; but neither coitus nor\r\n  masturbation brought relief, and she went to an asylum.\r\n\r\n  The case of a mother of five children is added, who, in despair about\r\n  her inordinate sexual impulse, attempted suicide, and then sought an\r\n  asylum. There her condition improved, but she never trusted herself to\r\n  leave it.\r\n\r\nThere are several illustrative cases in men and women in the author’s\r\narticle, “On Certain Anomalies of Sexual Instinct,” Cases 6 and 7\r\n(_Archiv für Psychiatrie_, vii, 2); Cases 3 and 5 are given here.\r\n\r\n  Case 11. On the afternoon of July 7, 1874, Clemens, engineer, being on\r\n  his way, on business, from Trieste to Vienna, left the train at the\r\n  town of Bruck, and, passing through the town to the neighboring\r\n  village of St. Ruprecht, attempted a rape on an old woman, aged 70,\r\n  whom he found alone in a house. He was seized by the neighbors and\r\n  arrested by the local police. At his hearing he declared that he had\r\n  tried to find the pound, in order to satisfy his sexual desire with a\r\n  bitch. He said that he often suffered with such sexual excitement. He\r\n  did not deny his act, but excused it as the result of disease. The\r\n  heat, the motion of the cars, and anxiety about his family, to which\r\n  he wished to go, had confused him and made him ill. Shame and remorse\r\n  were not shown. His conduct was open, his mien gay; eyes red and\r\n  bright, head hot, tongue coated; pulse full, soft, beating over 100;\r\n  fingers somewhat tremulous. The statements of the accused were\r\n  precise, but hurried; his glance uncertain, and with an unmistakable\r\n  expression of lasciviousness. To the medical expert summoned to\r\n  examine him, he gave the impression of one suffering with disease,—as\r\n  if he were in the beginning of alcoholic insanity.\r\n\r\n  C. is forty-five years old, married, father of one child. He does not\r\n  know what diseases his parents or other members of his family have\r\n  had. In childhood he was weak and neuropathic. At the age of five his\r\n  head was injured by a blow with a hoe. A scar one-half cm. broad by\r\n  one cm. long, situated on the right parietal and frontal bones, dates\r\n  from that injury. The bone is here somewhat depressed. The overlying\r\n  skin is united to the bone. Pressure at this point causes pain, which\r\n  radiates along the lower branch of the trigeminus. This spot is also\r\n  frequently spontaneously painful. In his youth he had frequent attacks\r\n  of “fainting”; before puberty, pneumonia, rheumatism, and intestinal\r\n  catarrh. At the age of seven he experienced a peculiar inclination for\r\n  men,—_i.e._, for a certain superior. Whenever he saw this man he had a\r\n  peculiar feeling in his heart; kissed the ground he walked on. At ten\r\n  he fell in love with a certain deputy. Later he had an enthusiasm for\r\n  men, though it was entirely platonic. He began to masturbate at the\r\n  age of fourteen; first intercourse at seventeen. Then the earlier\r\n  manifestations of contrary sexual feeling disappeared entirely. At\r\n  that time he passed through a peculiar acute psychopathic condition,\r\n  which he described as a kind of clairvoyance. From fifteen,\r\n  hæmorrhoids, with symptoms of plethora abdominalis. When he had\r\n  profuse hæmorrhoidal hæmorrhage, which occurred usually every three or\r\n  four weeks, he was better. At other times he was constantly in a\r\n  condition of painful sexual excitement, which he satisfied partly by\r\n  means of onanism and partly by coitus. Every woman he met excited him;\r\n  even when he was among female relatives he was impelled to make\r\n  indecent proposals. Sometimes it was possible for him to master his\r\n  desire; sometimes he was driven to indecent acts. If, after these, he\r\n  was kicked out-of-doors, it seemed perfectly right to him; for he\r\n  thought that he needed such correction and support against his\r\n  powerful impulse, which was a burden to him. No periodicity in this\r\n  sexual excitement was recognizable.\r\n\r\n  Until 1861 he committed excesses in venery and was several times\r\n  infected with gonorrhœa and chancres. In 1861, marriage. He was\r\n  sexually satisfied, but became a burden to his wife on account of his\r\n  great sensuality. In 1864 he passed through an attack of mania in the\r\n  hospital at Fiume, and in the same year he again fell ill, and was\r\n  taken to the insane asylum at Ybbs, where he remained until 1867.\r\n  There he suffered with recurrent mania accompanied by great sexual\r\n  excitement. He says that intestinal catarrh and anxiety were the cause\r\n  of his illness at that time.\r\n\r\n  Thereafter he was well, but he suffered much on account of his\r\n  excessive sexual desire. If he were absent from his wife but a short\r\n  time, the impulse became so powerful that man or animal was\r\n  indifferent to him for the satisfaction of his lust. In summer these\r\n  impulses were much stronger, and were always accompanied by abdominal\r\n  plethora. Something that he remembered in medical reading, made him\r\n  think that in his case the ganglionic system was more powerful than\r\n  the cerebral. In October, 1873, on account of business, he had to\r\n  leave his wife. From that time until Easter, with the exception of\r\n  occasional masturbation, there was no sexual indulgence. After that he\r\n  made use of women and bitches. From the middle of June until July 7,\r\n  he had no opportunity for sexual indulgence. He felt nervously\r\n  excited, relaxed, and as if he were going crazy. Of late he had slept\r\n  badly. A longing for his wife, who lived in Vienna, drove him to leave\r\n  his business. He obtained leave of absence. The heat and the noise of\r\n  the train confused him, and he could no longer hold out against his\r\n  sexual excitement and the pressure of blood in his abdomen. Everything\r\n  danced before his eyes. He left the car at Bruck, and was absolutely\r\n  confused, not knowing where he went; and for a moment the thought came\r\n  to him to throw himself in the water; all was like a mist before his\r\n  eyes. Then he saw a woman, exposed his genitals, and tried to embrace\r\n  her. She cried for help, and thus he was arrested.\r\n\r\n  After the attempt it suddenly became clear to him what he had done. He\r\n  openly confessed his crime, which he remembered in all its details,\r\n  but which seemed to him to be something abnormal. He could not help\r\n  it. For some days after this, C. suffered with headache and\r\n  congestions, and was now and then excited and restless, and slept\r\n  badly. His mental functions are undisturbed, but he is, nevertheless,\r\n  a congenitally peculiar man, with a character weak and devoid of\r\n  energy. The facial expression has something lascivious and peculiar\r\n  about it. He suffers with hæmorrhoids. The genitals present nothing\r\n  abnormal. The cranium is narrow and retreating at the forehead. Body\r\n  large and well nourished. With the exception of diarrhœa, there is no\r\n  disturbance of the vegetative functions.\r\n\r\n  Case 12. Mrs. E., aged 47. Uncle on father’s side was insane; father\r\n  was sanguine, and given to excess in venery. Patient’s brother died of\r\n  an acute cerebral affection. Patient from childhood has been nervous,\r\n  eccentric, and romantic; and while little more than a child manifested\r\n  excessive sexual desire, and at ten began sexual indulgence. At\r\n  nineteen, marriage. Unhappy married life; her husband, who was normal,\r\n  did not satisfy her, and until recent years she constantly had other\r\n  friends besides her husband. She was well aware of the immorality of\r\n  her life, but felt her powerlessness against her insatiable desire,\r\n  which she sought to keep, at least outwardly, a secret. Later she\r\n  thought that she had suffered with a “mania for men.” Patient has\r\n  borne six children. Six years ago she was thrown from a wagon and\r\n  received a severe cerebral concussion. Following this there was\r\n  melancholia, with delusions of persecution, which sent her to the\r\n  asylum. She is approaching the climacterium, and of late the menses\r\n  have been profuse and too frequent. Since this period she is pleased\r\n  to note that the previously powerful sexual impulse has declined.\r\n  Proper behavior. Slight degree of descensus uteri and prolapsus ani.\r\n\r\nHyperæsthesia sexualis may be continuously present with exacerbations,\r\nor it may be intermittent or periodic. In the latter case it is a\r\ncerebral neurosis _per se_ (_vide_ “Special Pathology”), or an\r\naccompanying symptom of a condition of general psychical excitement\r\n(mania; episodically in dementia paralytica, dementia senilis, etc.).\r\n\r\nLentz has published a remarkable case of intermittent satyriasis\r\n(_Bulletin de la société de méd. légale de Belgique_, Nr. 21):—\r\n\r\n  Case 13. For three years the generally respected farmer D., married,\r\n  aged 35, has manifested states of sexual excitement, with increasing\r\n  frequency and severity, which, during the past year, have become true\r\n  paroxysms of satyriasis. It was impossible to discover hereditary or\r\n  other organic cause. D. was compelled, at times when his sexual\r\n  excitement was excessive, to perform the sexual act from ten to\r\n  fifteen times in twenty-four hours, without deriving any feeling of\r\n  satisfaction. Gradually he developed a condition of general nervous\r\n  hyper-irritability (_éréthisme général_) with increased emotional\r\n  irritability to the extent of pathological outbreaks of anger, and\r\n  impulse to over-indulgence in alcohol, which induced symptoms of\r\n  alcoholism. His attacks of satyriasis became so violent that\r\n  consciousness was interfered with, and the patient raged about in\r\n  blind impulse to sexual acts. He demanded that his wife give herself\r\n  to other men or to animals in his presence; that she allow copulation\r\n  with him, _presentibus filiabus_, because this would afford him\r\n  greater enjoyment. Memory for the events at the height of these\r\n  attacks, in which the extreme irritability even led to outbreaks of\r\n  maniacal rage, was entirely wanting. D. himself thought that he must\r\n  have had moments in which he no longer had control of his senses, and\r\n  without satisfaction from his wife would have been compelled to seize\r\n  the next best female. After an attack of violent emotion, these\r\n  attacks of sexual excitement suddenly disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nThe two following cases show how powerful, dangerous, and painful sexual\r\nhyperæsthesia may become in those afflicted with this anomaly:—\r\n\r\n  Case 14. _Hyperæsthesia Sexualis_—_Delirium Acutum ex Abstinentia._—On\r\n  May 29, 1882, F., aged 29, single, shoemaker, was received at the\r\n  clinic. Father was of passionate temper; mother neuropathic, and had\r\n  an insane brother. Patient had never been seriously ill previously,\r\n  and was not a drinker, but had always been sexually very passionate.\r\n  Five days before, he was taken acutely ill mentally. He made two\r\n  attempts at rape in broad daylight, before witnesses, and when\r\n  arrested talked in delirium only of obscene things, and masturbated\r\n  without stint, and for three days had been raving mad. On admission he\r\n  presented the picture of a severe acute delirium, with violent motor\r\n  symptoms of irritation, and fever. Under treatment with ergotin a cure\r\n  was effected.\r\n\r\n  On January 5, 1888, second admission, in a state of violent mania. On\r\n  January 4, he had become morose, irritable, whining, and sleepless;\r\n  and then, after vain assaults on women, had manifested symptoms of\r\n  increasing angry excitement.\r\n\r\n  On January 6, progress of the condition to severe acute delirium\r\n  (great disturbance of consciousness, jactation, grinding of the teeth,\r\n  grimacing, and other motor symptoms of irritation; temperature as high\r\n  as 40.7° C.); impulsive masturbation. Recovery was complete by January\r\n  11, under energetic treatment with ergotin.\r\n\r\n  After his recovery the patient gives an interesting account of the\r\n  cause of his illness. Always very passionate sexually; first coitus at\r\n  the age of sixteen. Continence caused headache, great psychical\r\n  irritability, lassitude, great loss of pleasure in work, and\r\n  sleeplessness. Since he had few opportunities in the country to\r\n  satisfy his desire, he had recourse to masturbation. It was necessary\r\n  for him to masturbate once or twice daily. No coitus in two months.\r\n  Increasing sexual excitement; could think of nothing save means for\r\n  the gratification of his impulse. Masturbation was not sufficient to\r\n  banish the constantly increasing torment _ex abstinentia_. During the\r\n  last four days violent impulse to coitus; increasing sleeplessness and\r\n  irritability. There was only a summary recollection of the height of\r\n  the illness. Patient recovered in December. A very respectable man; he\r\n  considers his inordinate desire decidedly pathological, and is anxious\r\n  about his future.\r\n\r\n  Case 15. On July 11, 1884, R., aged 33, servant, was admitted\r\n  suffering with paranoia persecutoria and neurasthenia sexualis. Mother\r\n  was neuropathic; father died of spinal disease. From childhood he had\r\n  an intense sexual desire, of which he became conscious as early as his\r\n  sixth year. From this age, masturbation; from fifteenth year, _faute\r\n  de mieux_, pederasty; occasionally, sodomitic indulgences. Later,\r\n  abusus coitus in marriage cum uxore. Now and then even perverse\r\n  impulse to commit cunnilingus and to administer cantharides to his\r\n  wife, because her libido did not equal his own. His wife died after a\r\n  short period of married life. Patient’s circumstances became\r\n  straightened, and he had no means to indulge himself sexually. Then\r\n  masturbation again; employment of lingua canis to induce ejaculation.\r\n  At times, priapism and conditions approaching satyriasis. He was then\r\n  driven to masturbate, in order not to become stuporous. Beneficial\r\n  diminution of the libido nimia, with the gradually predominating\r\n  sexual neurasthenia and hypochondria.\r\n\r\nThe following case, valuable for an understanding of many Messalinas,\r\nsome of whom are historically celebrated, is a classical example of pure\r\nhyperæsthesia sexualis, which I take from Trelat’s “Folie lucide”:—\r\n\r\n  Case 16. Mrs. V. has suffered with a passion for men since her\r\n  earliest youth. Of good family, well bred, of pleasant disposition,\r\n  exceedingly modest, she was, as a little girl, a terror to her family,\r\n  because she could scarcely be alone with a person of the opposite sex,\r\n  no matter whether it was with child or man of any age, without\r\n  exposing herself immediately and demanding satisfaction for her sexual\r\n  passion, even going so far as to lay hold of him. An attempt was made\r\n  to cure her by marriage. She loved her husband passionately, but even\r\n  with him she could not keep from demanding coitus of every one with\r\n  whom she could be alone, no matter whether it was servant, laborer, or\r\n  school-boy.\r\n\r\n  Nothing could cure her of this impulse. Even when she became a\r\n  grandmother, she was still a Messalina. One day she locked a\r\n  twelve-year-old boy in her room and tried to seduce him. The boy\r\n  defended himself and escaped. She was severely punished by his\r\n  brother. All was in vain. She was put in a cloister. There she was an\r\n  example of morality, and gave not the slightest cause for blame.\r\n  Immediately after her return the scandal began again. The family\r\n  banished her, and set aside money to support her. She earned by her\r\n  own hand-work enough to buy herself lovers. Any one seeing this neatly\r\n  dressed matron, of good manners and amiable disposition, would never\r\n  suspect how recklessly passionate she still was at the age of\r\n  sixty-five. On January 7, 1854, her family, in despair at new\r\n  scandals, placed her in an asylum. She lived there until May, 1858,\r\n  when she died of apoplexia cerebri, in her seventy-third year. Her\r\n  conduct in the asylum was exemplary. Left to herself, and under\r\n  favorable conditions, her sexual impulses manifested themselves\r\n  shortly before her death. With the exception of this, during an\r\n  observation of four years by physicians of the asylum, she never\r\n  showed a sign of mental abnormality.\r\n\r\n\r\n D. PARÆSTHESIA OF SEXUAL FEELING (PERVERSION OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT).\r\n\r\nIn this condition there is perverse emotional coloring of the sexual\r\nideas. Ideas physiologically and psychologically accompanied by feelings\r\nof disgust, give rise to pleasurable sexual feelings; and the abnormal\r\nassociation finds expression in passionate, uncontrollable emotion. The\r\npractical results are perverse acts (perversion of the sexual instinct).\r\nThis is more easily the case if the pleasurable feelings, increased to\r\npassionate intensity, inhibit any opposing ideas with corresponding\r\nfeelings of disgust; or the influence of such opposing concepts may be\r\nimpossible on account of the absence or loss of all ideas of morality,\r\næsthetics, and law. This loss, however, is only too frequently found\r\nwhere the spring of ethical ideas and feelings (a normal sexual\r\ninstinct) has been poisoned from the beginning.\r\n\r\nWith opportunity for the natural satisfaction of the sexual instinct,\r\nevery expression of it that does not correspond with the purpose of\r\nnature,—_i.e._, propagation,—must be regarded as perverse. The perverse\r\nsexual acts resulting from paræsthesia are of the greatest importance\r\nclinically, socially, and forensically; and, therefore, they must here\r\nreceive careful consideration; all æsthetic and polite disgust must be\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nPerversion of the sexual instinct, as will be seen from what follows, is\r\nnot to be confounded with perversity in the sexual act; since the latter\r\nmay be induced by conditions which are not psychopathology. The concrete\r\nperverse act, monstrous as it may be, is not decisive. In order to\r\ndifferentiate between disease (perversion) and vice (perversity), one\r\nmust investigate the whole personality of the individual and the\r\noriginal impulse leading to the perverse act. Therein will be found the\r\nkey of diagnosis (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\nParæsthesia may occur in combination with hyperæsthesia. This\r\nassociation seems to be frequent clinically. Sexual acts are then\r\nconfidently to be expected. The perverse direction of sexual activity\r\nmay be toward sexual satisfaction with the opposite or the same sex.\r\nThus two great groups of perversions of the sexual life may be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n _1. Sexual Inclination toward Persons of the Opposite Sex, with Perverse\r\n                        Activity of the Instinct._\r\n\r\n1. _Association of Active Cruelty and Violence with\r\nLust_—_Sadism._[40]—That lust and cruelty frequently occur together is a\r\nfact that has long been recognized and not infrequently observed.\r\nWriters of all kinds have called attention to this phenomenon.[41] The\r\nnot infrequent cases where individuals of very excitable sexual natures\r\nbite or scratch the companion in intercourse fall within physiological\r\nlimits.[42] The older authors have called attention to the relation\r\nbetween lust and cruelty.\r\n\r\n  Blumröder (“Ueber Irresein,” Leipzig, 1836, p. 51) saw a man who had\r\n  several wounds bitten into the pectoral muscle, which a woman, in\r\n  great sexual excitement, had given him at the acme of lustful feeling\r\n  during coitus. Blumröder (“Ueber Lust und Schmerz,” Friedreich’s\r\n  _Magazin für Seelenkunde_, 1830, ii, 5) calls especial attention to\r\n  the psychological connection between lust and murder. In relation to\r\n  this, he especially refers to the Indian myths of Siva and Durga\r\n  (Death and Lust); to human sacrifice with sensual mysteries; and to\r\n  sexual instinct at puberty with a lustful impulse to suicide, with\r\n  whipping, pinching, and pricking of the genitals, in the blind impulse\r\n  to satisfy sexual desire. Lombroso (“Verzeni e Agnoletti,” Rome, 1874)\r\n  also cites numerous examples of the occurrence of a desire to murder\r\n  with greatly increased lust.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when murderous lust has been excited, lust itself\r\noften follows. Lombroso (_op. cit._) alludes to the fact, mentioned by\r\nMantegazza, that, with fear of being plundered by bandits, there was\r\nalways a dread of brutal lust.[43] These examples form transitions to\r\nthe pronounced pathological cases.\r\n\r\n  The examples of the degenerate Cæsars (Nero, Tiberius) are also\r\n  instructive. They took delight in having youths and maidens\r\n  slaughtered before their eyes. Not less so is the history of that\r\n  monster, Marschalls Gilles de Rays (Jacob, “Curiosités de l’histoire\r\n  de France,” Paris, 1858), who was executed in 1440, on account of\r\n  mutilation and murder, which he had practiced for eight years on more\r\n  than eight hundred children. As the monster confessed it, it was from\r\n  reading Suetonius and the descriptions of the orgies of Tiberius,\r\n  Caracalla, etc., that the idea was gained of locking children in his\r\n  castles, torturing them, and then killing them. This inhuman wretch\r\n  confessed that in the commission of these acts he enjoyed\r\n  inexpressible pleasure. He had two assistants. The bodies of the\r\n  unfortunate children were burned, and only a number of heads of\r\n  particularly beautiful children were preserved—as memorials.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to explain the association of lust and cruelty, it is\r\nnecessary to return to a consideration of the quasi-physiological cases,\r\nin which, at the moment of most intense lust, very excitable\r\nindividuals, who are otherwise normal, commit such acts as biting and\r\nscratching, which are usually the result of anger. It must further be\r\nremembered that love and anger are not only the most intense emotions,\r\nbut also the only two forms of active (sthenic) emotion. Both seek their\r\nobject, try to possess themselves of it, and naturally exhaust\r\nthemselves in a physical effect on it; both throw the psycho-motor\r\nsphere into the most intense excitement, and thus, by means of this\r\nexcitation, reach their normal expression.\r\n\r\nFrom this stand-point it is clear how lust impels to acts that otherwise\r\nare expressive of anger.[44] The one, like the other, is a state of\r\nexaltation, an intense excitation of the whole psycho-motor sphere. Thus\r\nthere arises an impulse to react on the object that induces the\r\nstimulus, in every possible way, and with the greatest intensity. Just\r\nas maniacal exaltation easily passes to furibund destructiveness,\r\nexaltation of the sexual emotion often induces an impulse to expend\r\nitself in senseless and apparently harmful acts. To a certain extent\r\nthese are psychical accompaniments; but it is not simply an unconscious\r\nexcitation of innervation of muscles (which also sometimes occurs as\r\nblind violence); it is a true hyperbulia, a desire to exert the most\r\nintense effect on the individual giving rise to the stimulus. The most\r\nintense means, however, is the infliction of pain.\r\n\r\nThrough such cases of infliction of pain, during the most intense\r\nemotion of lust, we approach the cases in which a real injury, wound, or\r\ndeath, is inflicted on the victim.[45] In these cases, the impulse to\r\ncruelty, which may accompany the emotion of lust, becomes unbounded in a\r\npsychopathic individual; and, at the same time, owing to defect of moral\r\nfeeling, all normal inhibitory ideas are absent or weakened. Such\r\nmonstrous, sadistic acts have, however, in men, in whom they are much\r\nmore frequent than in women, another source in physiological conditions.\r\nIn the intercourse of the sexes, the active or aggressive _rôle_ belongs\r\nto man; woman remains passive, defensive.[46] It affords a man great\r\npleasure to win a woman, to conquer her; and in the _ars amandi_, the\r\nmodesty of a woman who keeps herself on the defensive until the moment\r\nof surrender, is an element of great psychological significance and\r\nimportance. Under normal conditions a man meets obstacles which it is\r\nhis part to overcome, and for which nature has given him an aggressive\r\ncharacter. This aggressive character, however, under pathological\r\nconditions, may likewise be excessively developed, and express itself in\r\nan impulse to subdue absolutely the object of desire, even to destroy or\r\nkill it.[47][48]\r\n\r\nIf both these constituent elements occur together,—the abnormally\r\nintensified impulse to a violent reaction toward the object of the\r\nstimulus, and the abnormally intensified desire to conquer the\r\nwoman,—then the most violent outbreaks of sadism occur.\r\n\r\nSadism is thus nothing else than an excessive and monstrous pathological\r\nintensification of phenomena,—possible, too, in normal conditions in\r\nrudimental forms,—which accompany the psychical vita sexualis,\r\nparticularly in males. It is, of course, not at all necessary, and not\r\neven the rule, that the sadistic individual should be conscious of his\r\ninstinct. What he feels is, as a rule, only the impulse to cruel and\r\nviolent treatment of the opposite sex, and the coloring of the idea of\r\nsuch acts with lustful feelings. Thus arises a powerful impulse to\r\ncommit the imagined deeds. When the actual motive of this instinct is\r\nnot comprehended by the individual, the sadistic acts have the character\r\nof impulsive deeds.\r\n\r\nWhen the association of lust and cruelty is present, not only does the\r\nlustful emotion awaken the impulse to cruelty, but _vice versâ_; cruel\r\nideas and acts cause sexual excitement, and in this way are used by\r\nperverse individuals.[49]\r\n\r\nA differentiation of original and acquired cases of sadism is scarcely\r\npossible. Many individuals, tainted _ab origine_, for a long time do\r\neverything to conquer the perverse instinct. If they are potent, at\r\nfirst they are able to lead a normal vita sexualis, often with the\r\nassistance of subjective ideas of a perverse nature. Later, after the\r\nopposing motives of an ethical and æsthetic kind have been gradually\r\novercome, and after the constantly repeated experience that the natural\r\nact does not bring complete satisfaction, the abnormal instinct bursts\r\nforth. Owing to this late expression, in acts, of an originally perverse\r\ndisposition, the appearances are those of an acquired perversion. As a\r\nrule, it may be safely assumed that this psychopathic state exists _ab\r\norigine_.\r\n\r\nSadistic acts vary in monstrousness with variation in the power of the\r\nperverse instinct over the individual afflicted, and with variation in\r\nthe strength of opposing ideas that may be present, which almost always\r\nare more or less weakened by original ethical defect, hereditary\r\ndegeneracy, or moral insanity. Thus there arises a long series of forms\r\nwhich begins with capital crime and ends with silly acts which afford\r\nthe perverse desires of the sadistic individual merely symbolic\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nSadistic acts may be further differentiated with reference to their\r\nnature: either as they are indulged in after consummated coitus by which\r\nthe libido nimia remains unsatisfied; or, with diminished virility, as\r\nthey are used to stimulate the diminished power; or, finally, where\r\nvirility is absolutely wanting, as they become an equivalent for the\r\nimpossible coitus, for the induction of ejaculation. In the last two\r\ncases, notwithstanding the impotence, there is still intense libido; or\r\nthere was, at least, intense libido in the individual at the time when\r\nthe sadistic acts became habitual. Sexual hyperæsthesia is always to be\r\nregarded as the basis of sadistic inclinations. The impotence which\r\noccurs so frequently in the psychopathic and neuropathic individuals\r\nhere considered, as a result of excesses indulged in from early youth,\r\nis usually dependent upon spinal weakness. Often, too, there is a kind\r\nof psychical impotence, induced by concentration of thought on the\r\nperverse act with simultaneous fading of the idea of normal\r\nsatisfaction. No matter what the external form of the act may be, the\r\nmentally perverse predisposition and instinct of the individual are\r\nessential to an understanding of it.\r\n\r\n(a) _Lust-Murder_[50] (_Lust Potentiated as Cruelty, Murderous Lust\r\nExtending to Anthropophagy_).—The most horrible example, and one which\r\nmost pointedly shows the connection between lust and a desire to kill,\r\nis the case of Andreas Bichel, which Feuerbach published in his\r\n“aktenmässige Darstellung merkwürdiger Verbrechen.”\r\n\r\n  B. puellas stupratas necavit et dissecuit. With reference to one of\r\n  his victims, at his examination he expressed himself as follows: “I\r\n  opened her breast and with a knife cut through the fleshy parts of the\r\n  body. Then I arranged the body as a butcher does a beef, and hacked it\r\n  with an axe into pieces of a size to fit the hole which I had prepared\r\n  up in the mountain for burying it. I may say that while opening the\r\n  body I was so greedy that I trembled, and could have cut out a piece\r\n  and eaten it.”\r\n\r\n  Lombroso, too (“Geschlechtstrieb und Verbrechen in ihren gegenseitigen\r\n  Beziehungen.” Goltdammer’s _Archiv_, Bd. xxx), mentions cases falling\r\n  in the same category. A certain Phillipe indulged in choking\r\n  prostitutes, post-actum, and said: “I am fond of women, but it is\r\n  sport for me to choke them after having enjoyed them.”\r\n\r\n  A certain Grassi (Lombroso, _op. cit._, p. 12) was one night seized\r\n  with sexual desire for a relative. Irritated by her remonstrance, he\r\n  stabbed her several times in the abdomen with a knife, and also\r\n  stabbed her father and uncle who attempted to hold him back.\r\n  Immediately thereafter he hastened to visit a prostitute in order to\r\n  cool his sexual passion in her arms. But this was not sufficient. He\r\n  then murdered his father and slaughtered several oxen in the stable.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, from what has gone before, that a great number of\r\nso-called lust-murders depend upon a combination of hyperæsthesia and\r\nparæsthesia sexualis. As a result of this perverse coloring of the\r\nfeelings, further acts of bestiality with the body may result,—_e.g._,\r\ncutting it up and wallowing in the intestines. The case of Bichel points\r\nto this possibility.\r\n\r\nA modern example is that of Menesclou (_Annales d’hygiène publique_),\r\nwho was examined by Lasègue, Brouardel, and Motet, declared to be\r\nmentally sound, and executed.\r\n\r\n  Case 17. A four-year-old girl was missing from her parents’ home,\r\n  April 15, 1880. On April 16th, Menesclou, one of the occupants of the\r\n  house, was arrested. The forearm of the child was found in his pocket,\r\n  and the head and entrails, in a half-burned condition, were taken from\r\n  the stove. Parts of the body were found in the water-closet. The\r\n  genitals could not be found. M., when asked their whereabouts, became\r\n  embarrassed. The circumstances, as well as an obscene poem found on\r\n  his person, left no doubt that he had violated the child and then\r\n  murdered her. M. expressed no remorse, asserting that his deed was an\r\n  accident. His intelligence is limited. He presents no anatomical signs\r\n  of degeneration; is somewhat deaf, and scrofulous.\r\n\r\n  M., aged 20; convulsions at the age of nine months. Later, he suffered\r\n  from poor sleep (enuresis nocturna); was nervous, and developed\r\n  tardily and imperfectly. From the time of puberty he was irritable,\r\n  showed evil inclinations; was lazy; could not be taught, and in all\r\n  trades proved, to be of no use. He grew no better even in the House of\r\n  Correction. He was made a marine, but there, too, he proved useless.\r\n  When he returned home he stole from his parents, and spent his time in\r\n  bad company. He did not run after women, but gave himself up\r\n  passionately to masturbation, and occasionally indulged in sodomy with\r\n  bitches. His mother suffered with mania menstrualis periodica. An\r\n  uncle was insane, and another an inebriate. The examination of M.’s\r\n  brain showed morbid changes of the frontal lobes, of the first and\r\n  second temporal convolutions, and of a part of the occipital\r\n  convolutions.\r\n\r\n  Case 18. Alton, a clerk in England, goes out of town for a walk. He\r\n  lures a child into a thicket, and returns after a time to his office,\r\n  where he makes this entry in his note-book: “Killed to-day a young\r\n  girl; it was fine and hot.” The child was missed, searched for, and\r\n  found cut into pieces. Many parts, and among them the genitals, could\r\n  not be found. A. did not show the slightest trace of emotion, and gave\r\n  no explanation of the motive or circumstances of his horrible deed. He\r\n  was a psychopathic individual, and occasionally subject to states of\r\n  depression with tædium vitæ. His father had had one attack of acute\r\n  mania. A near relative suffered from mania with homicidal impulses. A.\r\n  was executed.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it may even happen that appetite for the flesh of the\r\nmurdered victim arises, and, in consequence of this perverse coloring of\r\nthe idea, parts of the body may be eaten.\r\n\r\n  Case 19. Leger, vine-dresser, aged 24. From youth moody, silent, shy\r\n  of people. He starts out in search of a situation. He wanders about\r\n  eight days in the forest, there catches a girl twelve years old,\r\n  violates her, mutilates her genitals, tears out her heart, eats of it,\r\n  drinks the blood, and buries the remains. Arrested, at first he lied,\r\n  but finally confessed his crime with cynical cold-bloodedness. He\r\n  listened to his sentence of death with indifference, and was executed.\r\n  At the post-mortem examination, Esquirol found morbid adhesions\r\n  between the cerebral membranes and the brain (Gorget, “Darstellung der\r\n  Prozesse Leger, Feldtmann,” etc., Darmstadt, 1827).\r\n\r\n  Case 20. Tirsch, hospital beneficiary of Prag, aged 55, always silent,\r\n  peculiar, coarse, very irritable, grumbling, revengeful, was sentenced\r\n  to twenty years’ imprisonment, on account of violating a girl ten\r\n  years old. He had attracted attention on account of outbursts of anger\r\n  from insignificant causes, and also on account of tædium vitæ. In\r\n  1864, on account of the refusal of an offer of marriage which he made\r\n  to a widow, he developed a hatred toward women, and on July 8th he\r\n  went about with the intention of killing one of this hated sex.\r\n  Vetulam occurentem in silvam allexit, coitum poposcit, renitentem\r\n  prostravit, jugulum feminæ compressit “furore captus.” Cadaver virga\r\n  betulæ desecta verberare voluit neque tamen id perfecit, quia\r\n  conscientia sua hæc fieri vetuit, cultello mammae et genitalia desecta\r\n  domi cocta proximis diebus cum globis comedit. On September 12th, when\r\n  he was arrested, the remains of this meal were found. He gave as the\r\n  motive of this act “inner impulse.” He himself wished to be executed\r\n  because he had always been persecuted. In confinement there were great\r\n  emotional irritability and occasional outbursts of fury, preceded by\r\n  refusal of food, which made isolation, lasting several days,\r\n  necessary. It was authoritatively established that the most of his\r\n  earlier excesses were coincident with outbreaks of excitement and fury\r\n  (Maschka, _Prager Vierteljahrsschrift_, 1866, i, p. 79).\r\n\r\nThe Whitechapel murderer, who still eludes the vigilance of the police,\r\nprobably belongs in this category of psycho-sexual monsters.[51] The\r\nconstant absence of uterus, ovaries, and labia, in the victims (ten) of\r\nthis modern Bluebeard, allows the presumption that he seeks and finds\r\nstill further satisfaction in anthropophagy.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of lust-murder, for physical and mental reasons (_vide\r\nsupra_), violation is omitted, and the sadistic crime alone becomes the\r\nequivalent of coitus. The prototype of such cases is the following one\r\nof Verzeni. The life of his victim hung on the rapid or retarded\r\noccurrence of ejaculation. Since this remarkable case presents all the\r\npeculiarities which modern science knows concerning the relation of lust\r\nto lust-murder with anthropophagy, and especially since it was carefully\r\nstudied, it receives detailed description here:—\r\n\r\n  Case 21. Vincenz Verzeni, born in 1849; since January 11, 1872, in\r\n  prison; is accused (1) of an attempt to strangle his nurse Marianne,\r\n  four years ago, while she lay sick in bed; (2) of a similar attempt on\r\n  a married woman, Arsuffi, aged 27; (3) of an attempt to strangle a\r\n  married woman, Gala, by grasping her throat while kneeling on her\r\n  body; (4) on suspicion of the following murders:—\r\n\r\n  In December a fourteen-year-old girl, Johanna Motta, set out for a\r\n  neighboring village between seven and eight o’clock in the morning.\r\n  Since she did not return, her master set out to find her, and\r\n  discovered her body near the village, lying by a path in the fields.\r\n  The corpse was frightfully mutilated with numerous wounds. The\r\n  intestines and genitals had been torn from the opened body, and were\r\n  found near by. The nakedness of the body and erosions on the thighs\r\n  made it seem probable that there had been an attempt at rape; the\r\n  mouth filled with earth pointed to suffocation. In the neighborhood of\r\n  the body, under a pile of straw, were found a portion of flesh torn\r\n  from the right calf, and pieces of clothing. The perpetrator of the\r\n  deed remained undiscovered.\r\n\r\n  On August 28, 1871, a married woman, Frigeni, aged 28, set out in the\r\n  fields early in the morning. Since she did not return by eight\r\n  o’clock, her husband started out to fetch her. He found her a corpse,\r\n  lying naked in the field, with the mark of a thong around her neck,\r\n  with which she had been strangled, and with numerous wounds. The\r\n  abdomen had been slit open, and the intestines were hanging out.\r\n\r\n  On August 29, at noon, as Maria Previtali, aged 19, went through a\r\n  field, she was followed by her cousin, Verzeni. He dragged her into a\r\n  field of grain, threw her to the ground, and began to choke her. As he\r\n  let go of her for a moment to ascertain whether there were any one\r\n  near, the girl got up and, by her supplicating entreaty, induced\r\n  Verzeni to let her go, after he had pressed her hands together for\r\n  some time.\r\n\r\n  Verzeni was brought before a court. He is twenty-two years old. His\r\n  cranium is of more than average size, but asymmetrical. The right\r\n  frontal bone is narrower and lower than the left, the right frontal\r\n  prominence being less developed, and the right ear smaller than the\r\n  left (by 1 centimetre in length and 3 centimetres in breadth); both\r\n  ears are defective in the inferior half of the helix; the right\r\n  temporal artery is somewhat atheromatous. Bull-necked; enormous\r\n  development of the zygomæ and inferior maxilla; penis greatly\r\n  developed, frænum wanting; slight divergent alternating strabismus\r\n  (insufficiency of the internal rectus muscle, and myopia). Lombroso\r\n  concludes, from these signs of degeneration, that there is a\r\n  congenital arrest of development of the right frontal lobe. As seemed\r\n  probable, Verzeni has a bad ancestry,—two uncles are cretins; a third,\r\n  microcephalic, beardless, one testicle wanting, the other atrophic.\r\n  The father shows traces of pellagrous degeneration, and had an attack\r\n  of hypochondria pellagrosa. A cousin suffered from cerebral hyperæmia;\r\n  another is a confirmed thief.\r\n\r\n  Verzeni’s family is bigoted and low-minded. He himself has ordinary\r\n  intelligence; knows how to defend himself well; seeks to prove an\r\n  alibi and cast suspicion on others. There is nothing in his past that\r\n  points to mental disease, but his character is peculiar. He is silent\r\n  and inclined to be solitary. In prison he is cynical. He masturbates,\r\n  and makes every effort to gain sight of women.\r\n\r\n  Verzeni finally confessed his deeds and their motive. The commission\r\n  of them gave him an indescribably pleasant (lustful) feeling, which\r\n  was accompanied by erection and ejaculation. As soon as he had grasped\r\n  his victim by the neck, sexual sensations were experienced. It was\r\n  entirely the same to him, with reference to these sensations, whether\r\n  the women were old, young, ugly, or beautiful. Usually, simply choking\r\n  them had satisfied him, and he then had allowed his victims to live;\r\n  in the two cases mentioned, the sexual satisfaction was delayed, and\r\n  he had continued to choke them until they died. His satisfaction in\r\n  this garroting was greater than in masturbation. The abrasions of the\r\n  skin on Motta’s thighs were produced by his teeth, while sucking her\r\n  blood in most intense lustful pleasure. He had torn out a piece of\r\n  flesh from her calf and taken it with him to roast at home; but on the\r\n  way he hid it under the straw-stack, for fear his mother would suspect\r\n  him. He also carried pieces of the clothing and intestines some\r\n  distance, because it gave him great pleasure to smell and touch them.\r\n  The strength which he possessed in these moments of intense lustful\r\n  pleasure, was enormous. He had never been a fool; while committing his\r\n  deeds he saw nothing around him (apparently as a result of intense\r\n  sexual excitement, annihilation of apperception—instinctive action).\r\n  After such acts he was always very happy, enjoying a feeling of great\r\n  satisfaction. He had never had pangs of conscience. It had never\r\n  occurred to him to touch the genitals of the martyred women, or to\r\n  violate his victims. It had satisfied him to throttle them and suck\r\n  their blood. These statements of this modern vampire seem to rest on\r\n  truth. Normal sexual impulses seem to have remained foreign to him.\r\n  Two sweethearts that he had, he was satisfied to look at; it was very\r\n  strange to him that he had no inclinations to strangle them or press\r\n  their hands; but he had not had the same pleasure with them as with\r\n  his victims. There was no trace of moral sense,—remorse and the like.\r\n\r\n  Verzeni said himself that it would be a good thing if he were to be\r\n  kept in prison, because with freedom he could not resist his impulses.\r\n  Verzeni was sentenced to imprisonment for life (Lombroso, “Verzeni e\r\n  Agnoletti,” Rome, 1873). The confessions which Verzeni made after, his\r\n  sentence, are interesting:—\r\n\r\n  “I had an unspeakable delight in strangling women, experiencing during\r\n  the act erections and real sexual pleasure. It was even a pleasure\r\n  only to smell female clothing. The feeling of pleasure while\r\n  strangling them was much greater than that which I experienced while\r\n  masturbating. I took great delight in drinking Motta’s blood. It also\r\n  gave me the greatest pleasure to pull the hair-pins out of the hair of\r\n  my victims.\r\n\r\n  “I took the clothing and intestines, because of the pleasure it gave\r\n  me to smell and touch them. At last my mother came to suspect me,\r\n  because she noticed spots of semen on my shirt after each murder or\r\n  attempt at one. I am not crazy, but in the moment of strangling my\r\n  victims I saw nothing else. After the commission of the deeds I was\r\n  satisfied and felt well. It never occurred to me to touch or look at\r\n  the genitals or such things. It satisfied me to seize the women by the\r\n  neck and suck their blood. To this very day I am ignorant of how a\r\n  woman is formed. During the strangling and after it, I pressed myself\r\n  on the entire body without thinking of one part more than another.”\r\n\r\n  Verzeni arrived at his perverse acts entirely independently, after\r\n  having noticed, when he was twelve years old, that he experienced a\r\n  peculiar feeling of pleasure while wringing the necks of chickens.\r\n  After this he had often killed great numbers of them, and then said\r\n  that a weasel had been in the hen-coop (Lombroso, Goltdammer’s\r\n  _Archiv_, Bd. xxx, p. 13).\r\n\r\nLombroso mentions an analogous case (Goldtdammer’s _Archiv_) which\r\noccurred in Vittoria (Spain):—\r\n\r\n  Case 22. A certain Gruyo, aged 41, with a blameless past life, having\r\n  been three times married, strangled six women in the course of ten\r\n  years. They were almost all public prostitutes and quite old. After\r\n  the strangling he tore out their intestines and kidneys per vaginam.\r\n  Some of his victims he violated before killing, others, on account of\r\n  the occurrence of impotence, he did not. He set about his horrible\r\n  deeds with such care that he remained undetected for ten years.\r\n\r\n(b) _Mutilation of Corpses._—Following the preceding horrible group of\r\nperversions of the sexual instinct, which arise from hyperæsthesia and\r\nparæsthesia sexualis with retained virility, come naturally the\r\nnecrophiles; for in these cases, just as with lustful murderers and\r\nanalogous cases, an idea which in itself awakens a feeling of horror,\r\nand before which a healthy person would shudder, is accompanied by\r\nlustful feelings, and thus leads to the impulse to indulge in acts of\r\nnecrophilia.\r\n\r\nThe cases of mutilation of bodies mentioned in literature seem to be\r\npathological; but, with the exception of the celebrated one of Sergeant\r\nBertrand (_v. infra_), they come far from being described and observed\r\nwith exactness. In certain cases there may be nothing more than the\r\npossibility that unbridled desire sees in the idea of death no obstacle\r\nto its satisfaction. The seventh case mentioned by Moreau is perhaps\r\nsuch a one:—\r\n\r\n  A man, aged 23, attempted to rape a woman, aged 53. Struggling, he\r\n  killed her and then violated her, threw her in the water, and fished\r\n  her out again for renewed violation. The murderer was executed. The\r\n  meninges of the anterior lobes were thickened and adherent to the\r\n  cortex.\r\n\r\n  French writers have recorded numerous examples of necrophilia. Two\r\n  cases concerned monks, where they were performing the watch for the\r\n  dead. In a third case the subject was an idiot, who also suffered from\r\n  periodical mania, and after commission of rape was sent to an insane\r\n  asylum, and there mutilated female bodies in the mortuary.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, there is undoubtedly direct preference of a\r\ncorpse to the living woman. When no other act of cruelty—cutting into\r\npieces, etc.—is practiced on the cadaver, it is probable that the\r\nlifeless condition itself forms the stimulus for the perverse\r\nindividual. It is possible that the corpse—a human form absolutely\r\nwithout will—satisfies an abnormal desire, in that the object of desire\r\nis seen to be capable of absolute subjugation, without possibility of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n  Brierre de Boismont (_Gazette médicale_, July 21, 1859) relates the\r\n  history of a corpse-violator who, after bribing the watchman, had\r\n  gained entrance to the corpse of a girl of sixteen, who belonged to a\r\n  family of high social position. At night a noise was heard in the\r\n  death-chamber, as if a piece of furniture had fallen over. The mother\r\n  of the dead girl effected an entrance, and saw a man dressed in his\r\n  night-shirt springing from the bed where the body lay. It was at first\r\n  thought that the man was a thief, but the real explanation was soon\r\n  discovered. It was afterward ascertained that the culprit, a man of\r\n  good family, had often violated the bodies of young women. He was\r\n  sentenced to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nThe story of a prelate, reported by Taxil (“La prostitution\r\ncontemporaine,” p. 171), is of great interest as an example of\r\nnecrophilia. From time to time he would visit houses of prostitution in\r\nParis and order a prostitute, dressed in white like a corpse, to be laid\r\nout on a bed. At the appointed hour he would appear in the room, which,\r\nin the meantime, had been elaborately prepared as a room of mourning;\r\nthen he would act as if reading a mass for the soul, and finally throw\r\nhimself on the girl, who, during the whole time, was compelled to play\r\nthe _rôle_ of a corpse.[52]\r\n\r\nThe cases in which the perpetrator injures and cuts up the corpse are\r\nclearer. Such cases come next to those of lust-murder, in that, in these\r\nindividuals, cruelty, or at least an impulse to attack the female body,\r\nis connected with lust. It is possible that a remnant of moral sense\r\ndeters from the cruel act on a living woman, and possibly the fancy\r\npasses beyond lust-murder and rests on its result, the corpse. Here,\r\nalso, it is possible that the idea of defenselessness of the body plays\r\na _rôle_.\r\n\r\n  Case 23. Sergeant Bertrand, a man of delicate physical constitution\r\n  and of peculiar character; from childhood silent and inclined to\r\n  solitude.\r\n\r\n  The details of the health of his family are not satisfactorily known;\r\n  but the occurrence of mental diseases in his ancestry is ascertained.\r\n  It is said that while he was a child he was affected with destructive\r\n  impulses, which he himself could not explain. He would break whatever\r\n  was at hand. In early childhood, without teaching, he learned to\r\n  masturbate. At nine he began to feel inclinations toward persons of\r\n  the opposite sex. At thirteen the impulse to sexual intercourse became\r\n  powerfully awakened in him. He now masturbated excessively. When he\r\n  did this his fancy always created a room filled with women. He would\r\n  imagine that he carried out the sexual act with them, and then killed\r\n  them. Immediately thereafter he would think of them as corpses, and of\r\n  how he defiled them. Occasionally, in such situations, the thought of\r\n  carrying out a similar act with male corpses would come up, but it was\r\n  always attended with a feeling of disgust.\r\n\r\n  In time he felt the impulse to carry out such acts with actual\r\n  corpses. For want of human bodies, he obtained those of animals. He\r\n  would cut open the abdomen, tear out the entrails, and masturbate\r\n  during the act. He declares that in this way he experienced\r\n  inexpressible pleasure. In 1846 these bodies no longer satisfied him.\r\n  He now killed dogs, and proceeded with them as before. Toward the end\r\n  of 1846 he first felt the desire to make use of human bodies. At first\r\n  he had a horror of it. In 1847, being by accident in a grave-yard, he\r\n  ran across the grave of a newly-buried corpse. Then this impulse, with\r\n  headache and palpitation of the heart, became so powerful that,\r\n  although there were people near by, and he was in danger of detection,\r\n  he dug up the body. In the absence of a convenient instrument for\r\n  cutting it up, he satisfied himself by hacking it with a shovel.\r\n\r\n  In 1847 and 1848, during two weeks, as reported, the impulse,\r\n  accompanied by violent headache, to commit brutalities on corpses,\r\n  actuated him. Amidst the greatest dangers and difficulties, he\r\n  satisfied this impulse some fifteen times. He dug up the bodies with\r\n  his hands, in nowise sensible, in his excitement, to the injuries he\r\n  thus inflicted on himself. When he had obtained the body, he cut it up\r\n  with a sword or pocket-knife, tore out the entrails, and then\r\n  masturbated. The sex of the bodies is said to have been a matter of\r\n  indifference to him, though it was ascertained that this modern\r\n  vampire had dug up more female than male corpses. During these acts he\r\n  declares himself to have been in an indescribable state of sexual\r\n  excitement. After having cut them up, he had sometimes reinterred the\r\n  bodies.\r\n\r\n  In July, 1848, he accidentally came across the body of a girl of\r\n  sixteen. Then, for the first time, he experienced a desire to carry\r\n  out coitus on a cadaver. “I covered it with kisses and pressed it\r\n  wildly to my heart. All that one could enjoy with a living woman is\r\n  nothing in comparison with the pleasure I experienced. After I had\r\n  enjoyed it for about a quarter of an hour, I cut the body up, as\r\n  usual, and tore out the entrails. Then I buried the cadaver again.”\r\n  Only after this, as B. declares, had he felt the impulse to use the\r\n  bodies sexually before cutting them up, and thereafter he had done it\r\n  in three instances. The actual motive of the exhuming of the bodies,\r\n  however, was then, as before, to cut them up; and the enjoyment in so\r\n  doing was greater than in using the bodies sexually. The latter act\r\n  had always been nothing more than an episode of the principal one, and\r\n  had never quieted his desires; therefore, he had always cut up the\r\n  body afterward or mutilated another body. The medico-legal examiners\r\n  gave an opinion of “monomania.” Court-martial sentence to one year’s\r\n  imprisonment. (Michéa, _Union méd._, 1849; Lunier, _Annal.\r\n  méd.-psychol._, 1849, p. 153; Tardieu, “Attentats aux moeurs,” 1878,\r\n  p. 114; Legrand, “La folie devant les tribun.,” p. 524.)\r\n\r\n(c) _Injury of Women_ (_Stabbing, Flagellation, etc._).—Following\r\nlust-murder and violation of corpses, come cases closely allied to the\r\nformer, in which injury of the victim of lust and sight of the victim’s\r\nblood are a delight and pleasure for degenerate men. The notorious\r\nMarquis de Sade,[53] after whom the combination of lust and cruelty has\r\nbeen named, was such a monster. Coitus only excited him when he could\r\nprick the object of his desire until the blood came. His greatest\r\npleasure was to injure prostitutes and then bind their wounds.\r\n\r\nHere also belongs the case of a captain mentioned by Brierre de\r\nBoismont, who always compelled the object of his affection to place\r\nleeches ad pudenda before coitus, which was very frequent. Finally this\r\nwoman became very anæmic and, as a result of this, insane.\r\n\r\nThe following case, borrowed from my own clientele, very clearly shows\r\nthe connection between lust and cruelty, with desire to shed and see\r\nblood:—\r\n\r\n  Case 24. Mr. X., aged 25; father syphilitic, died of paretic dementia;\r\n  mother hysterical and neurasthenic. He is a weak individual,\r\n  constitutionally neuropathic, and presents several anatomical signs of\r\n  degeneration. When a child, hypochondria and imperative conceptions;\r\n  later, constant alternation of exaltation and depression. While yet a\r\n  child of ten, the patient felt a peculiar lustful desire to see blood\r\n  flow from his fingers. Thereafter he often cut or pricked himself in\r\n  the fingers, and took great delight in it. Very early, erections were\r\n  added to this, and also if he saw the blood of others; for example,\r\n  when he saw a servant-girl cut her finger it gave him an intense\r\n  lustful feeling. From this time his vita sexualis became more and more\r\n  powerful. Without any teaching he began to masturbate, and always\r\n  during the act there were memory-pictures of bleeding girls. It now no\r\n  longer sufficed him to see his own blood flow; he longed to see the\r\n  blood of young females, especially those that were attractive to him.\r\n  Often he could scarcely overcome the impulse to injure two cousins and\r\n  a certain servant. But also young women that were in themselves not\r\n  attractive induced this impulse when they excited him by some\r\n  peculiarity of dress or adornment, especially coral jewelry. It was\r\n  necessary for him to overcome these desires; but in his imagination\r\n  bloody thoughts were constantly present, and induced lustful\r\n  excitement. There was an inner relation existing between both thoughts\r\n  and feelings. Often there were other cruel fancies. He imagined\r\n  himself in the _rôle_ of a tyrant who had the people shot in crowds\r\n  with grape-shot. He was compelled to fancy a scene as it would be if\r\n  enemies were to take a city and mutilate, torture, kill, and rape the\r\n  young women. In times of quiet this patient, who had a mild\r\n  disposition and was not morally defective, was shamed and horrified by\r\n  such cruel, lustful fancies, and they always became immediately latent\r\n  as soon as his sexual excitement had been satisfied by masturbation.\r\n\r\n  After a few years the patient became neurasthenic. Then simple\r\n  imaginary representation of blood and scenes of blood was sufficient\r\n  to induce ejaculation. In order to free himself from his vice and his\r\n  cruel imagination, he began to indulge in sexual intercourse with\r\n  females. Coitus was possible, but only when the patient called up the\r\n  idea that the girl’s fingers were bleeding. Without the assistance of\r\n  this idea no erection was possible. The cruel thought of cutting was\r\n  limited to the woman’s hand. At times of greatest sexual excitement,\r\n  simply the sight of the hand of an attractive woman was sufficient to\r\n  induce violent erections. Frightened by the popular stories about the\r\n  injurious results of onanism, he abstained and fell into a condition\r\n  of severe general neurasthenia, with hypochondriacal dysthymia and\r\n  tædium vitæ. Careful and watchful medical treatment cured the patient\r\n  after a few months. He has remained mentally well three years; but\r\n  now, as before, he is very sensual, though it is very seldom that he\r\n  is troubled by his earlier bloody ideas. X. has given up masturbation\r\n  entirely. He finds satisfaction in natural sexual indulgence, is\r\n  virile, and it is no longer necessary for him to call up ideas of\r\n  blood.\r\n\r\nThe following case, reported by Tarnowsky (_op. cit._, p. 61), shows\r\nthat such lustful, cruel impulses may be simply episodical, and occur in\r\ncertain exceptional states of mind in neurotic individuals:—\r\n\r\n  Case 25. Z., physician; neuropathic constitution, reacting badly to\r\n  alcohol. Under ordinary circumstances capable of normal coitus, as\r\n  soon as he has indulged in wine he finds that his increased libido is\r\n  no longer satisfied by simple coitus. In this condition he is\r\n  compelled to prick the nates puellæ or to make stabs with the lancet,\r\n  to see blood, and feel the entrance of the blade into the living body,\r\n  in order to have ejaculation and experience complete satiety of his\r\n  lust.\r\n\r\nThe majority of those afflicted with this form of the perversion seem\r\ninsensible to the normal stimulus of woman. In the first case (24), the\r\nassistance of the idea of blood was necessary in order to obtain\r\nerection. The following case is that of a man who, by masturbation,\r\netc., in early youth, had diminished his power of erection so that the\r\nsadistic act took the place of coitus:\r\n\r\n  Case 26. _The girl-stabber of Bozen_ (reported by Demme, “Buch der\r\n  Verbrechen,” Bd. ii, p. 341). In 1829, H., aged 30, soldier, became\r\n  the subject of legal investigation. At different times and in\r\n  different places, he had wounded girls with bread-knives or\r\n  pocket-knives, by stabbing them in the abdomen, probably in the region\r\n  of the genitals. He gave, as a motive for these acts, heightened\r\n  sexual impulse, increasing to the intensity of fury, which found\r\n  satisfaction only in the thought and act of stabbing persons of the\r\n  female sex. This impulse would pursue him for days at a time. He would\r\n  then pass into a confused mental state, which would clear away only\r\n  when the impulse had been satisfied by the deed. In the act of\r\n  stabbing he had a satisfaction like that of completed coitus, which\r\n  was increased by the sight of the blood that ran from the knife. In\r\n  his tenth year the sexual instinct became powerfully manifest. At\r\n  first he gave himself up to masturbation, and felt physically and\r\n  mentally weakened by it. Before he became a girl-stabber he had\r\n  satisfied his sexual lust in violation of immature girls, by causing\r\n  them to practice masturbation on him, and by sodomy. Gradually the\r\n  thought came to him of how pleasurable it would be to stab a young and\r\n  pretty girl in the region of the genitals, and take delight in the\r\n  sight of the blood running from the knife.\r\n\r\n  Among his effects were found copies of objects of art and obscene\r\n  pictures, painted by himself, of Mary’s conception, and of the\r\n  “congealed thought of God” in the lap of the Virgin. He was considered\r\n  a peculiar, very irritable man, shy of people, given to women, moody,\r\n  and glum. He was apparently a person[54] that had become impotent\r\n  through earlier sexual excesses, and who was thus predisposed, by the\r\n  continuance of intense libido sexualis, and heredity, to perversion of\r\n  the sexual life.\r\n\r\n  Case 27. In the “sixties” the inhabitants of Leipzig were frightened\r\n  by a man who was accustomed to attack young girls on the street and\r\n  stab them in the upper-arm with a dagger. Finally arrested, he was\r\n  recognized as a sadist, who, at the instant of stabbing, had an\r\n  ejaculation, and with whom the wounding of the girls was an equivalent\r\n  for coitus. (Wharton, “A Treatise on Mental Unsoundness,” § 623.\r\n  Philadelphia, 1873.)[55]\r\n\r\nImpotence exists, likewise, in the next three cases. It may be\r\npsychical, however, in that the principal tone of the vita sexualis lies\r\nin the sadistic inclination, and the normal elements are distorted:—\r\n\r\n  Case 28. _The girl-cutter of Augsburg_ (reported by Demme, “Buch der\r\n  Verbrechen,” vii, p. 281). Bartle, wine-merchant. He was subject to\r\n  lively sexual excitement at the age of fourteen, though decidedly\r\n  opposed to its satisfaction by coitus, his aversion going so far as\r\n  disgust for the female sex. At that time he already had the idea to\r\n  cut girls, and thus satisfy his sexual desire. He refrained from it,\r\n  however, on account of lack of opportunity and courage. He practiced\r\n  masturbation, and now and then had pollutions with erotic dreams of\r\n  girls that had been cut. At the age of nineteen he first cut a girl.\r\n  During the act he had a seminal emission, and experienced intense\r\n  pleasure. From that time the impulse became constantly more powerful.\r\n  He chose only young and pretty girls, and, as a rule, asked them\r\n  before the deed whether they were still single. The ejaculation or\r\n  sexual satisfaction occurred only when he was sure that he had\r\n  actually wounded the girls. After such an act he always felt tired and\r\n  bad, and was also troubled with qualms of conscience. Until thirty-two\r\n  years old he carried on this process of cutting, but always with care\r\n  not to wound the girls dangerously. From that time until his\r\n  thirty-sixth year he was able to control his impulse. Then he sought\r\n  to satisfy himself by simply pressing the girls on the arm or neck;\r\n  but this gave rise to erections and not to ejaculation. Then he sought\r\n  to attain his object by pricking the girls with a knife in its sheath;\r\n  but this did not suffice. Finally, he stabbed with the open knife and\r\n  had complete success, for he thought that a girl when stabbed bled\r\n  more and had more pain than one that was merely, cut. In his\r\n  thirty-seventh year he was detected and arrested. In his dwelling was\r\n  found a collection of daggers, sword-canes, and knives. He said that\r\n  the mere sight of these weapons, and still more the grasping of them,\r\n  gave him an intense feeling of sensual pleasure, with violent\r\n  excitement. According to his confession he had injured, in all, fifty\r\n  girls. His external appearance was rather pleasing. He lived in very\r\n  good circumstances, but was peculiar and shy.\r\n\r\n  Case 29. J. H., aged 25, in 1883 came for consultation concerning\r\n  severe neurasthenia and hypochondria. Patient confesses that he has\r\n  practiced onanism since his fourteenth year, infrequently up to his\r\n  eighteenth year; but since that time he has been unable to resist the\r\n  impulse. Up to that time he had no opportunity to approach females,\r\n  for he had been anxiously cared for and never left alone, on account\r\n  of his invalidism. He had had no real desire for this unknown\r\n  pleasure; but he accidentally learned what it was when one of his\r\n  mother’s maids cut her hand severely on a pane of glass she had broken\r\n  while washing windows. While helping to stop the blood he could not\r\n  keep from sucking up the blood that flowed from the wound, and in the\r\n  act he experienced extreme erotic excitement, with complete orgasm and\r\n  ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  From this time, in every possible way, he sought to see, and if\r\n  possible to taste, the fresh blood of females. That of young girls was\r\n  preferred by him. He spared no pains or expense to obtain this\r\n  pleasure. At first he availed himself of a young servant who allowed\r\n  her finger to be pricked with a needle or lancet at his request. When\r\n  his mother discovered this, she discharged the girl. Then he was\r\n  driven to prostitutes as a substitute, with success frequently enough,\r\n  though with some difficulty. In the intervals he practiced onanism and\r\n  manustupration per feminam, which, however, never afforded him\r\n  complete satisfaction, but, on the contrary, caused listlessness and\r\n  self-reproach. On account of his nervous difficulties he visited many\r\n  sanitariums, and he was twice a voluntary patient in institutions. He\r\n  used hydrotherapy, electricity, and strengthening cures, without\r\n  particular success. For a time it was possible, by means of cold\r\n  sitz-baths, monobromate of camphor, and bromides, to diminish his\r\n  sexual excitability and onanistic impulse. However, when the patient\r\n  felt himself free again, he would immediately fall into his old\r\n  passions and spare no pains or money in order to satisfy his sexual\r\n  desire in the abnormal manner described.\r\n\r\n  Case 30 (communicated by Dr. A. Moll, Berlin). L. T., aged 21;\r\n  merchant in a Rhenish city. He belongs to a family in which there are\r\n  several nervous and psychopathic members. A sister suffers with\r\n  hysteria and melancholia.\r\n\r\n  The patient was always of quiet disposition and timid. At school he\r\n  frequently kept apart from other pupils, particularly when they talked\r\n  about girls. In the presence of ladies he thought every expression he\r\n  made was an offense against decency. Thus, for example, he thought it\r\n  very improper, in the presence of ladies, married or unmarried, to\r\n  speak of going to bed, rising, etc. In the elementary classes the\r\n  patient learned well. Later he became more indolent and did not make\r\n  good progress.\r\n\r\n  August 17, 1890, the patient visited Dr. Moll on account of abnormal\r\n  symptoms of a sexual kind. He did this on the advice of a physician,\r\n  X., a relative, in whom he had previously confided. The patient\r\n  conveys the impression of being very apprehensive and shy, and in\r\n  answer to questions says that he is very timorous, and that\r\n  particularly in the presence of others all his self-confidence and\r\n  assurance leave him. Dr. X. confirmed this statement.\r\n\r\n  The beginning of his sexual life the patient was able to refer to his\r\n  seventh year. At that age he frequently played with his genitals, and\r\n  was often punished for it. In this onanism, in which he said he had\r\n  erection, he constantly thought of whipping a woman on the naked nates\r\n  with a rod until the skin raised in weals. “It delighted me,” said the\r\n  patient, “when I thought that she was a _proud_, beautiful lady, and\r\n  that I performed the act in the presence of others, especially women,\r\n  particularly with the idea _that she might feel the power I had over\r\n  her_. For this reason I early sought reading about punishment, _e.g._,\r\n  about the abuse of Roman slaves. However, I had erections only when\r\n  the conceived abuse consisted of blows delivered on the back or nates.\r\n  At first I thought this kind of excitement would disappear in time,\r\n  and said nothing about it to any one.”\r\n\r\n  Masturbation, early indulged in, the patient continued to practice,\r\n  and always with the same thought. After his thirteenth or fourteenth\r\n  year he had ejaculation with the act. Decimum septimum annum agens\r\n  primum feminam adiit coëundi causa neque coitum perficere potuit\r\n  libidine et erectione deficientibus. Mox autem iterum apud alteram\r\n  coitum conatus est nullo succesu. Tum feminam per vim verberavit.\r\n  Tantopere erat excitatus ut mulierem dolore clamantem atque\r\n  lamentantem verberare non desierit. He never thought of any legal\r\n  punishment for his acts, and, in fact, escaped it. In this procedure\r\n  erection, orgasm, and ejaculation occurred. The patient performed the\r\n  act in such a way that he took the woman between his knees, with the\r\n  penis in contact with her body, but without emissio penis in vaginam,\r\n  which seemed entirely superfluous to him.\r\n\r\n  But the patient afterward experienced such a feeling of shame about\r\n  the beating, and was overcome with such great depression, that he\r\n  often contemplated suicide. In the following three years he still\r\n  visited women occasionally. But he never again asked one to allow him\r\n  to beat her. He sought to obtain erection by thinking of the beating;\r\n  but this was without result, and manustupration by the woman did not\r\n  induce erection. Finally, after an unsuccessful attempt of this kind,\r\n  the patient determined to give his confidence to a physician.\r\n\r\n  The patient made several other statements concerning his vita\r\n  sexualis. His abnormal sexual desire had troubled him by its\r\n  intensity. He went to sleep with sexual thoughts; they troubled him\r\n  through the night and were still with him when he awoke. He was never\r\n  safe for any length of time from the impulsion of the abnormal ideas\r\n  that excited him; to which, indeed, he gave himself up willingly, and\r\n  from which he could free himself for a short time only by onanism.\r\n\r\n  In response to my question, the patient stated that any other means of\r\n  punishment of women than beating the back, and nates particularly, had\r\n  no charm for him. Neither binding them, walking on them, nor striking\r\n  them, gives him such pleasure. This is to be emphasized the more,\r\n  since the whipping given the woman affords him sexual pleasures\r\n  because its effect on her is “humiliating, mortifying,” and because\r\n  she should “feel that she is completely in his power.” Too, it would\r\n  give the patient no pleasure to beat a woman on any other part of her\r\n  body than those mentioned, or to cause her pain in any other way than\r\n  by blows. Multum minorem ei affert voluptatem si nates suæ a muliere\r\n  verberantur; tamen ea res sæpe ejaculationem seminis effecit, sed hæc\r\n  fieri putat erectione deficienti. Inter verbera autem penem in vaginam\r\n  immittendo nullam voluptatem se habere ratus qualibet parte corporis\r\n  feminæ pene tacte semen ejaculat. _Just as in beating the woman his\r\n  pleasure lay in humiliating her, so with the relations reversed he was\r\n  sexually excited by the fact that the beating humiliated him and he\r\n  felt himself to be completely in the woman’s power._ No other personal\r\n  humiliation than a beating on his nates could excite him. To allow\r\n  himself to be bound or walked on by a woman is repugnant to him.\r\n\r\n  The patient’s dreams, as far as they were of an erotic nature, were\r\n  directed in the same way as his sexual inclinations while awake;\r\n  actual ejaculation also often took place in dreams. Whether the\r\n  perverse sexual thoughts first occurred in dreams or the waking state,\r\n  the patient is not able to state, owing to the fact that his memory\r\n  goes back so far,—to his seventh year. But he thinks that these\r\n  thoughts first occurred to him while awake. In his dreams it\r\n  frequently seemed to him that he was striking a man, which also caused\r\n  ejaculation. In the waking state it excited him but _very little_ to\r\n  think of striking a man. The nude form of a man had _no attraction\r\n  whatever_ for him, while the nude form of a woman had a decided charm\r\n  for him, though his libido found its real satisfaction only when the\r\n  acts previously described took place; and, as he states, he feels no\r\n  desire for coitus in vaginam.\r\n\r\n  The treatment of the patient is directed to the attainment of normal\r\n  coitus with normal desire, where possible; for it may be assumed that,\r\n  with success in making his sexual life normal, the patient’s shyness\r\n  and apprehensiveness, which cause him great annoyance, may be much\r\n  easier removed. The treatment followed by me (Dr. Moll) during three\r\n  months and a half was as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. The patient, who had a great desire to be cured, was most strictly\r\n  forbidden to give himself up to the perverse thoughts. Of course, I\r\n  did not give him the foolish advice not to think of blows at all. The\r\n  patient could not follow such advice, since the thoughts come to him\r\n  without any act of his own, even when he accidentally reads the word\r\n  “blow” (schlagen). I forbade him only ever to voluntarily give himself\r\n  to such thoughts. I advised him more particularly to do everything in\r\n  order to turn his ideas in another direction.\r\n\r\n  2. I allowed him, commanded him even, to think of nude women, because\r\n  many nude females interested him, even though, as he thought, they did\r\n  not excite him sexually.\r\n\r\n  3. I sought, by means of hypnosis—which was hard to induce—and\r\n  suggestion, to fortify the patient in this as far as possible. All\r\n  attempts at coitus were forbidden in order to save the patient from a\r\n  discouraging result.\r\n\r\n  Within two months and a half this treatment led to the result that, as\r\n  the patient stated, the perverse ideas occurred much less frequently\r\n  and were constantly retreating to the background; indeed, according to\r\n  the patient’s statement, erections occurred with the thoughts of nude\r\n  women, became more frequent, and often induced him to masturbate with\r\n  the thought of coitus without the occurrence of any idea of blows.\r\n  Erotic dreams occurred but infrequently. These were concerned\r\n  sometimes with normal coitus, sometimes with blows.\r\n\r\n  After two months and a half of the treatment I advised the patient to\r\n  attempt coitus. Since then he has tried four times. I advised him to\r\n  choose always a woman who pleased him, and sought to increase his\r\n  sexual excitement before coitus by means of tincture of cantharides.\r\n  The four attempts, the last of which took place on November 29, 1890,\r\n  resulted as follows: At the first, prolonged manipulation of the penis\r\n  by the woman was necessary in order to induce erection. Then immisio\r\n  in vaginam and ejaculation with orgasm took place. During the whole\r\n  act there occurred no thought of beating the woman or being beaten,\r\n  but the woman in herself excited him sufficiently for the performance\r\n  of coitus. At the second attempt the result was better and more\r\n  quickly attained; manipulation ad genitalia by the woman was not long\r\n  required. In the third attempt coitus was attained only after the\r\n  patient had thought of beating for a long time, and had thus induced\r\n  erection; but beating was not indulged in. At the fourth attempt\r\n  coitus was attained without any thought of beating and without any\r\n  manipulation ad genitalia.\r\n\r\n  Of course, the case described cannot yet be regarded in any way as\r\n  cured. Though the patient were able to perform coitus in a normal or\r\n  nearly normal way, that does not mean that he will always be able to\r\n  do it in the future; moreover, the thought of beating still affords\r\n  him great pleasure, even though it occurs much less frequently than\r\n  formerly. Yet there is a possibility that the abnormal desire, which\r\n  has been weakened, will remain weakened in the future, and perhaps\r\n  disappear.\r\n\r\nThis carefully observed case is, for several reasons, particularly\r\ninteresting. It discloses clearly one of the hidden roots of sadism,—the\r\nimpulse to complete subjugation of the woman, which here became\r\nconsciously entertained. This is the more remarkable since it occurred\r\nin an individual decidedly timid, and in other respects modest and even\r\napprehensive. The case also shows clearly that powerful libido, which\r\neven impels the individual to overcome all obstacles, may be present,\r\nwhile at the same time coitus is not desired, because the principal\r\nintensity of feeling is, _ab origine_, connected with the cruel part of\r\nthe sadistic (lustful and cruel) circle of ideas. This case also\r\ncontains weak elements of masochism (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\nCases are by no means infrequent in which men with perverse inclinations\r\ninduce prostitutes, by paying them high prices, to allow themselves to\r\nbe whipped and even wounded by them. Works on prostitution contain\r\nreports of them (_vide_ Coffignon, “La Corruption à Paris,” etc.).\r\n\r\n(d) _Defilement of Women._—The perverse sadistic impulse, to injure\r\nwomen and put contempt and humiliation upon them, is also expressed in\r\nthe desire to defile them with disgusting or, at least, foul things.\r\n\r\nThe following case, published by Arndt (_Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger.\r\nMedicin_, N. F. xvii, H. 1), belongs here:—\r\n\r\n  Case 31. A., medical student at Greifswald, accusatus quod iterum\r\n  iterumque puellis honestis parentibus natis in publico genitalia sua e\r\n  bracis dependentia plane nudata quæ antia summo amiculo (overcoat)\r\n  tecta erant, ostenderat. Nonnunquam puellas fugientes secutus easque\r\n  ad se attractas urina oblivit. Hæc luce clara facta sunt; nunquam\r\n  aliquid hæc faciens locutus est.\r\n\r\n  A. is twenty-three years old, powerfully built, neat in dress, and\r\n  decent in manners. Indication of cranium progeneum; chronic pneumonia\r\n  of the apex of the right lung; emphysema. Pulse, 60; in excitement,\r\n  not more than 70 to 80. Genitals normal. Complaints of occasional\r\n  disturbances of digestion and hardness of the abdomen, vertigo;\r\n  excessive excitement of the sexual desires, which early led to\r\n  onanism. The sexual desire has never been directed toward a natural\r\n  method of satisfaction. Complaints of occasional attacks of\r\n  depression, or thoughts of deprecation of self, and of perverse\r\n  impulses, for which he could find no motive; such as laughing at\r\n  serious things, throwing his money in the water, and running about in\r\n  the pouring rain. The father of the culprit is of a nervous\r\n  temperament; his mother is subject to nervous headache. A brother\r\n  suffered with epileptic convulsions.\r\n\r\n  From his youth the culprit presented a nervous temperament, was\r\n  inclined to convulsions and attacks of syncope, and when he was\r\n  severely scolded would fall into a state of momentary stiffness. In\r\n  1869 he studied medicine in Berlin. In 1870 he went to the war as a\r\n  hospital-assistant. His letters at this time betray a peculiar\r\n  torpidity and weakness. On his return home, in 1871, his emotional\r\n  irritability was noticed by those about him. Thereafter frequent\r\n  complaints of bodily ailments; unpleasantness resulting from a love\r\n  affair. In November, 1871, he pursued his studies diligently in\r\n  Greifswald. He was considered very gentlemanly. In confinement he is\r\n  quiet, calm, and sometimes self-absorbed. His acts he attributes to\r\n  painful sexual excitement, which of late had become excessive. He\r\n  declared that he had been fully conscious of his perverse acts, and\r\n  had afterward been ashamed of them. He had not experienced actual\r\n  sexual satisfaction in their commission. He obtained no correct\r\n  insight into his position. He considered himself a kind of\r\n  martyr,—fallen a victim to an evil power. Presumption of\r\n  irresponsibility, as a result of absence of free will.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to defile occurs also, paradoxically, in the aged, when\r\nthere is a re-appearance of sexual instinct, which, under such\r\ncircumstances, is so often expressed in perverse acts. Thus Tarnowsky\r\nreports (p. 76) the following case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 32. I knew such a patient, who had a woman dressed in a\r\n  _décolleté_ ball-dress lie down on a low sofa in a brightly lighted\r\n  room. Ipse apud januam alius cubiculi obscurati constitit adspiciendo\r\n  aliquantulum feminam, excitatus in eam insiluit excrementa in sinus\r\n  ejus deposuit. Hæc faciens ejaculationem quandam se sentire confessus\r\n  est.\r\n\r\nAn officer of Vienna informs me that men, by means of large sums of\r\nmoney, induce prostitutes to suffer ut illi viri in ora earum spuerent\r\net fæces et urinas in ora explerent.[56]\r\n\r\nThe following case by Dr. Pascal (“Igiene dell’amore”) seems also to\r\nbelong here:—\r\n\r\n  Case 33. A man had an inamorata. His relation with her was that he had\r\n  her allow him to blacken her hands with coal or soot, and then she had\r\n  to sit before a mirror in such a way that he could see her hands in\r\n  it. While conversing with her, which was often for a long time, he\r\n  looked constantly at her mirrored hands, and finally, after a time, he\r\n  would take his leave, fully satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe following case, communicated by a physician, may be of interest in\r\nrelation to this subject:—\r\n\r\n  An officer was known in a brothel in K. only by the name of “Oil.”\r\n  “Oil” induced erection and ejaculation only by having puell. publ.\r\n  nudam step into a tub filled with oil, while he rubbed the oil all\r\n  over her body.\r\n\r\nThese acts lead to the presumption that certain cases of injury of\r\nfemales (_e.g._, sprinkling with sulphuric acid, ink, etc.) depend upon\r\na perverse sexual impulse; at least, here it is a kind of injury, and\r\nthose injured are always females, and the perpetrators males. At least\r\nin the future, in crimes of this kind, pains should be taken to examine\r\nthe vita sexualis of the culprits.\r\n\r\nThe case of Bachmann, given below, throws a clear light on the sexual\r\nnature of such crimes; for, in this case, the sexual motive in the deed\r\nis proven.\r\n\r\n(e) _Other Attacks on Females_—_Symbolic Sadism._—The foregoing groups\r\ndo not exhaust the forms in which the sadistic impulse toward women is\r\nexpressed. If the impulse is not overmastering, or there is yet\r\nsufficient moral resistance, it may happen that the perverse inclination\r\nis satisfied by an act that is apparently quite senseless and silly, but\r\nwhich has a symbolic meaning for the perpetrator. This seems to be the\r\nmeaning of the two following cases:—\r\n\r\n  Case 34. (Dr. Pascal, “Igiene dell’amore.”) A man was accustomed to\r\n  go, on a certain day once a month, to an inamorata and cut her “bang.”\r\n  This gave him the greatest pleasure. He made no other demands on the\r\n  girl.\r\n\r\n  Case 35. A man in Vienna regularly visits several prostitutes only to\r\n  lather their faces and then to remove the lather with a razor, as if\r\n  he were shaving them. He never hurts the girls, but becomes sexually\r\n  excited and ejaculates during the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the following cases, in which a sadistic comedy is\r\nplayed, is clearer:—\r\n\r\n  Case 36. A man always announces to a puella publica his intended\r\n  visits. She must stand at the window, awaiting him, with her face done\r\n  up, and, on his entrance into the room, complain of severe toothache.\r\n  He is sorry for her, asks particularly about the pain, takes the cloth\r\n  off and puts it on again; but he never has coitus, and finds his\r\n  satisfaction simply in this act.[57]\r\n\r\nThe following case, which, unfortunately, was not carefully examined\r\nscientifically, is peculiar to itself:—\r\n\r\n  In an examination before a criminal court in Vienna, the following\r\n  facts were brought to light: Count N., accompanied by a young girl,\r\n  appeared in the public garden of an hotel, and, by his actions there,\r\n  gave public offense. He demanded of his companion that she kneel down\r\n  before him and implore him with folded hands. Then she was compelled\r\n  to lick his boots. Finally, he demanded of her, publicly, “an\r\n  unheard-of thing” (osculum ad nates, or the like), and only desisted\r\n  after she had sworn to do it at home.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the most remarkable thing was the desire of the perverse\r\nindividual to humiliate the woman before witnesses (comp. the fancies of\r\nsadists, Case 29); further, that the desire to humiliate the woman came\r\nentirely into the foreground, and acts of a purely symbolic nature were\r\nundertaken. Of course, with these, in this imperfectly-observed case,\r\nacts of cruelty were probable.\r\n\r\n(f) _Sadism with Other Objects_—_Whipping of Boys._—Besides the sadistic\r\nacts with females described, others occur with other living, sensitive\r\nobjects,—children and animals. There may be a full consciousness that\r\nthe impulse is really directed toward women, and that only _faute de\r\nmieux_ the next attainable objects (pupils) are abused. But the\r\ncondition of the perpetrator may be such that the impulse to cruel acts\r\nenters consciousness accompanied only by lustful excitement, while its\r\nreal object (which alone can explain the lustful coloring of such acts)\r\nremains in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe first alternative suffices as an explanation of the cases which Dr.\r\nAlbert describes (Friedreich’s _Blätter f. ger. Med._, p. 77,\r\n1859),—cases in which lustful teachers whipped their pupils on the naked\r\nnates without cause. We must think of the second alternative, the\r\nsadistic impulse with unconsciousness of its object, when boys are\r\nimmediately excited sexually at the sight of punishment of their\r\ncompanions, and are thus determined in their later vita sexualis, as in\r\nthe following cases:—\r\n\r\n  Case 37. K., aged 37, merchant, applied to me in the fall of 1889 for\r\n  advice concerning an anomaly of his vita sexualis, which made him fear\r\n  invalidism and impossibility of future happiness in marriage.\r\n\r\n  Patient came of a nervous family. As a child he was delicate, weak,\r\n  and nervous. Healthy except for measles; he later became strong.\r\n\r\n  At the age of eight, while at school, he saw how the teacher punished\r\n  the boys taking their heads between his thighs and spanking them with\r\n  a ferule. This sight caused the patient lustful excitement. “Without\r\n  any idea of the danger and enormity of onanism,” he satisfied himself\r\n  with it, and from that time often masturbated, during which he always\r\n  called up the memory-picture of a boy being punished.\r\n\r\n  Thus it continued until his twentieth year. Then he learned the\r\n  significance of onanism, was terribly frightened, and tried to\r\n  overcome his impulse to masturbate; but he fell into the practice of\r\n  psychical onanism, which he regarded as innocuous and morally\r\n  defensible, and for which he made use of the memory-pictures of boys\r\n  being whipped, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n  Patient now became neurasthenic, suffered with pollutions, and tried\r\n  to cure himself by visiting brothels; but he could not induce\r\n  erection. Then he sought to obtain normal sexual feelings by means of\r\n  social intercourse with ladies; but he recognized that he was entirely\r\n  insensible to the charms of the fair sex.\r\n\r\n  The patient is an intelligent man, normally developed, and of æsthetic\r\n  taste. There is no inclination to persons of his own sex. My advice\r\n  consisted of means to combat the neurasthenia and pollutions;\r\n  interdiction of psychical and manual onanism; avoidance of all sexual\r\n  excitants; and, possibly, hypnotic treatment to ultimately induce a\r\n  return of the vita sexualis to its normal condition.\r\n\r\n  Case 38. Abortive sadism. N., student, came under observation in\r\n  December, 1890. He had practiced masturbation from early youth.\r\n  According to his statements, he became sexually excited when he saw\r\n  his father whip the children, and, later, when he saw the teacher whip\r\n  his companions. When a spectator of such scenes, he always experienced\r\n  lustful feelings. He could not say exactly when this first occurred,\r\n  but it may have been at about the age of six. He could not tell\r\n  exactly when he began to masturbate, but he stated with certainty that\r\n  his sexual instinct was first awakened by the punishment of others,\r\n  and thus he unconsciously came to practice onanism. The patient\r\n  remembered clearly that from the age of four to the age of eight he\r\n  was frequently spanked, and that this caused him pain, never lustful\r\n  pleasure.\r\n\r\n  Since he did not always have opportunity to see others whipped, he\r\n  began to _imagine_ how others were punished. This excited his lust,\r\n  and he would then masturbate. Whenever he could, he managed to see\r\n  others punished at school. Now and then he also felt desire to whip\r\n  others. At the age of twelve he induced a comrade to allow him to whip\r\n  him. He found great sexual pleasure in it. When, however, his\r\n  companion beat him in return, he experienced nothing but pain.\r\n\r\n  The impulse to beat others was never very strong. The patient\r\n  experienced more satisfaction in filling his imagination with scenes\r\n  of whipping. He never indulged in any other sadistic acts, and never\r\n  had any desire to see blood, etc. Until his fifteenth year his sexual\r\n  indulgence consisted of onanism, indulged in after such fancies. After\r\n  that (dancing lessons, association with girls), the early fancies\r\n  disappeared almost entirely, and were accompanied by but weak lustful\r\n  feelings; so that the patient gave them up entirely. In their place\r\n  came thoughts of coitus in a natural way, without anything sadistic.\r\n\r\n  The patient indulged in coitus for the first time “on account of his\r\n  health.” He then tried to abstain from onanism, but was not\r\n  successful, though he often indulged in coitus, and with more pleasure\r\n  than he had in onanism. He wished to be freed from onanism as\r\n  something vicious. He had coitus once a month, but masturbated once or\r\n  twice every night. He was normal sexually, with the exception of the\r\n  onanism. There was no neurasthenia; genitals normal.\r\n\r\n  Case 39. P., aged 15, of high social position, came of an hysterical\r\n  mother, whose brother and father died in an asylum. Two children of\r\n  the family died, in early childhood, of convulsions. The patient is\r\n  talented, virtuous, and quiet; but at times he is very disobedient,\r\n  stubborn, and passionate. He has epilepsy, and practices onanism. One\r\n  day it was learned that P., with money, induced a comrade of fourteen,\r\n  B., to allow himself to be pinched on the arm, back, and thigh. When\r\n  B. cried, P. became excited and struck at B. with his right hand,\r\n  while with his left he made manipulations in the left pocket of his\r\n  trousers. P. confessed that to maltreat his friend, of whom he was\r\n  very fond, gave him peculiar delight; and that ejaculation while\r\n  hurting his friend gave him much more pleasure than when he\r\n  masturbated alone, (_v._ Gyurkovechky, “Pathol. und Therapie der\r\n  männl. Impotenz.,” p. 80, 1889.)\r\n\r\nThat in all these cases of sadistic abuse of boys there can be no\r\nthought of a combination of sadism and contrary sexual instinct, as\r\noften occurs (_v. infra_) in individuals of contrary sexuality, is\r\nshown—aside from the absence of all positive signs of it—by a study of\r\nthe next group, where, in association with the object of\r\ninjury,—animals,—the instinct for women is seen to appear repeatedly.\r\n\r\n(g) _Sadistic Acts with Animals._—In numerous cases, sadistically\r\nperverse men that are afraid of criminal acts with human beings, or that\r\ncare only for the sight of the suffering of a sensitive being, make use\r\nof the sight of dying animals, or torture animals, to stimulate or\r\nexcite their lust.\r\n\r\n  The case of a man in Vienna, which is reported by Hofmann in his\r\n  “Text-Book of Legal Medicine,” is noteworthy in relation to this.\r\n  According to the evidence of several prostitutes, before the sexual\r\n  act he was accustomed to excite himself by torturing chickens and\r\n  pigeons and other birds, and, therefore, was called “Hendlmann”\r\n  (chicken).\r\n\r\n  For the elucidation of such cases the observation of Lombroso is of\r\n  value, according to whom two men had ejaculation when they killed\r\n  chickens or pigeons, or wrung their necks.\r\n\r\n  The same author, in his “Uomo delinquente,” p. 201, speaks of a poet\r\n  of some reputation, who became powerfully excited sexually whenever he\r\n  saw calves slaughtered, and also at the sight of bloody flesh.\r\n\r\n  According to Mantegazza (_op. cit._, p. 114), among degenerate\r\n  Chinamen, a horrible sport consists of committing sodomy with geese,\r\n  and cutting their necks off _tempoire ejaculationis_!\r\n\r\n  Mantegazza (“Fisiologia del piacere,” 5th ed., pp. 394, 395) mentions\r\n  the case of a man who once saw chickens killed, and from that time had\r\n  a desire to wallow in their warm, steaming entrails, because he\r\n  experienced a feeling of lust while doing it.\r\n\r\nThus, in these and similar cases, the vita sexualis is so constituted\r\n_ab origine_ that the sight of blood, death, etc., excites lustful\r\nfeeling. It is so in the following case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 40. C. L., aged 42, engineer, married, father of two children;\r\n  from a neuropathic family; father irascible, a drinker; mother\r\n  hysterical, subject to eclamptic attacks. The patient remembers that\r\n  in childhood he took particular pleasure in witnessing the\r\n  slaughtering of domestic animals, especially swine. He thus\r\n  experienced lustful pleasure and ejaculation. Later he visited\r\n  slaughter-houses, in order to delight in the sight of flowing blood\r\n  and the death throes of the animals. When he could find opportunity,\r\n  he killed the animals himself, which always afforded him a vicarious\r\n  feeling of sexual pleasure.\r\n\r\n  At the time of full maturity he first attained to a knowledge of his\r\n  abnormality. The patient was not exactly opposed in inclination to\r\n  women, but close contact with them seemed to him repugnant. On the\r\n  advice of a physician, at twenty-five he married a woman who pleased\r\n  him, in the hope of freeing himself of his abnormal condition.\r\n  Although he was very partial to his wife, it was only seldom, and\r\n  after great trouble and exertion of his imagination, that he could\r\n  perform coitus with her; nevertheless, he begat two children. In 1866\r\n  he was in the war in Bohemia. His letters written at that time to his\r\n  wife, were composed in an exalted, enthusiastic tone. He was killed in\r\n  the battle of Königgrätz.\r\n\r\nIf, in this case, the capability of normal coitus was much impaired by\r\nthe predominance of perverse ideas, in the next it seems to have been\r\nentirely repressed:—\r\n\r\n  Case 41. (Dr. Pascal, “Igiene dell’ amore.”) A gentleman visited\r\n  prostitutes, had them purchase a living fowl or rabbit, and required\r\n  them to torture the animal. He had in mind the head and tearing out\r\n  the eyes and entrails. If he found a girl who would consent, and go\r\n  about it right cruelly, he was delighted, and paid her and went his\r\n  way without asking anything more or touching her.\r\n\r\nThe last two sections show that the suffering of any living being may\r\nbecome a source of perverse sexual enjoyment to sadistically constituted\r\npersons, and that there may be sadism with almost any [living] object.\r\nHowever, it would be erroneous and an exaggeration to try to explain by\r\nsadistic perversion all the remarkable and surprising acts of cruelty\r\nthat occur; and, in the innumerable cruelties, as they here and there\r\noccur in history or in certain psychological manifestations among the\r\npeople at the present time, it would be erroneous to assume sadism as a\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\nCruelty arises from various sources, and is natural to primitive man.\r\nCompassion, in contrast with it, is a secondary manifestation, and\r\nacquired late. The instinct to fight and destroy, so important an\r\nendowment in prehistoric conditions, is long afterward operative; and,\r\nin the ideas engendered by civilization, like that of “the criminal,” it\r\nfinds new objects, even though its original object—“the enemy”—still\r\nexists. That not simply the death, but also torture, of the conquered is\r\ndemanded, is in part explained by the sense of power, which satisfies\r\nitself in this way; and in part by the insatiableness of the impulse of\r\nvengeance. Thus all cruelty and all historical enormities may be\r\nexplained without recourse to sadism (which may often have been in\r\noperation, but which cannot be assumed, since it is relatively an\r\ninfrequent perversion).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there is still another powerful psychical element to\r\ntake into consideration, which explains the attraction that is still\r\nexerted by executions, etc.; and that is, the pleasure there is in\r\nintense and unusual impressions and rare sights, in contrast with which,\r\nin coarse and blunted beings, pity is silent.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly there are individuals for whom, in spite of, or even by\r\nreason of, their lively compassion, all that is connected with death and\r\nsuffering has a mysterious attraction; who, with inward opposition, and\r\nyet following a dark impulse, occupy themselves with such things, or at\r\nleast with pictures and notices of them. Still, this is not sadism, as\r\nlong as no sexual element enters into consciousness; and yet it is\r\npossible that, in unconscious life, slender threads connect such\r\nmanifestations with the hidden depths of sadism.\r\n\r\n(h) _Sadism in Woman._—That sadism—a perversion, as we have seen,\r\nfrequent in men—is much less frequent in women, is easily explained. In\r\nthe first place, sadism, in which the need of subjugation of the\r\nopposite sex forms a constituent element, in accordance with its nature,\r\nrepresents a pathological intensification of the masculine sexual\r\ncharacter; in the second place, the obstacles which oppose the\r\nexpression of this monstrous impulse are, of course, much greater for a\r\nwoman than for a man. Yet sadism occurs in women; and it can only be\r\nexplained by the primary constituent element,—the general\r\nhyper-excitation of the motor sphere. Only two cases have thus far been\r\nscientifically studied.\r\n\r\n  Case 42. A married man presented himself with numerous scars of cuts\r\n  on his arms. He told their origin as follows: When he wished to\r\n  approach his wife, who was young and somewhat “nervous,” he first had\r\n  to make a cut in his arm. Then she would suck the wound, and during\r\n  the act become violently excited sexually.\r\n\r\nThis case recalls the wide-spread legend of the vampires, the origin of\r\nwhich may perhaps be referred to such sadistic facts.[58]\r\n\r\nIn a second case of feminine sadism, for which I am indebted to Dr.\r\nMoll, of Berlin, by the side of the perverse impulse, as so frequently\r\noccurs, there is anæsthesia for the normal activities of the sexual\r\nlife; and here there are also traces of masochism (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\n  Case 43. Mrs. H., of H., aged 26, comes of a nervous family, in which\r\n  nervous or mental diseases are said not to have occurred; but the\r\n  patient herself presents signs of hysteria and neurasthenia. Although\r\n  eight years married, and the mother of a child, Mrs. H. never had\r\n  desire to perform coitus. Very strictly educated as a young girl,\r\n  until her marriage she remained almost innocent of any knowledge of\r\n  sexual matters. She has menstruated regularly since her fifteenth\r\n  year. There does not seem to be any essential abnormality of the\r\n  genitals. To the patient coitus is not only not a pleasure, but even\r\n  an unpleasant act; and repugnance to it has constantly increased. The\r\n  patient cannot understand how any one can call such an act the\r\n  greatest delight of love, which, to her, is something far higher and\r\n  unconnected with such a sensual impulse. At the same time, it should\r\n  be mentioned that the patient really loves her husband. In kissing\r\n  him, too, she experiences a decided pleasure, which she cannot exactly\r\n  describe. But she cannot conceive how the genitals can have anything\r\n  to do with love. In other respects Mrs. H. is a decidedly intelligent\r\n  woman, of feminine character.\r\n\r\n  Si oscula dat conjugi, magnum voluptatem percipit in mordendo eum.\r\n  Gratissimum ei esset conjugem mordere eo modo ut sanguis fluat.\r\n  Contenta esset, si loco coitus morderetur a conjuge ipsæque eum\r\n  mordere liceret. Tamen eam pœniteret, si morsu magnum dolorem faceret.\r\n  (Dr. Moll.)\r\n\r\nIn other cases of sadism which history and literature afford, we are\r\ncompelled to think of a reversal of the feminine sexual character,—a\r\npartial viraginity,—in order to explain the sadistic acts.\r\n\r\nIn history there are examples of famous women who, to some extent, had\r\nsadistic instincts. These Messalinas are particularly characterized by\r\ntheir thirst for power, lust, and cruelty. Among them are Valeria\r\nMessalina herself, and Catherine de Medici, the instigator of the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew, whose greatest pleasure was found in having\r\nthe ladies of her court whipped before her eyes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe gifted Henry von Kleist, who was undoubtedly mentally abnormal,\r\ngives a masterly portrayal of complete feminine sadism in his\r\n“Penthesilea.” In scene xxii, Kleist describes his heroine with\r\nAchilles, whom she had been pursuing in the fire of love, betrayed into\r\nher hands, as, overcome with lustful, murderous fury, she tears him in\r\npieces and sets her dogs on him: “She strikes, tearing the armor from\r\nhis body; they set their teeth in his white breast,—she and her dogs,\r\nthe rivals, Oxus and Sphynx,—they on the right side, she on the left;\r\nand as I approached blood dripped from her hands and mouth.” And later,\r\nwhen Penthesilea becomes satiated: “Did I kiss him to death? No. Did I\r\nnot kiss him? Torn in pieces? Then it was a mistake; kissing rhymes with\r\nbiting, and one who loves with the whole heart might easily mistake the\r\none for the other.”[59]\r\n\r\n2. _The Association of Passively Endured Cruelty and Violence, with\r\nLust—Masochism._[60]—Masochism is the opposite of sadism. While the\r\nlatter is the desire to cause pain and use force, the former is the wish\r\nto suffer pain and be subjected to force.\r\n\r\nBy masochism I understand a peculiar perversion of the psychical vita\r\nsexualis, in which the individual affected, in sexual feeling and\r\nthought, is controlled by the idea of being completely and\r\nunconditionally subject to the will of a person of the opposite sex; of\r\nbeing treated by this person as by a master,—humiliated and abused. This\r\nidea is colored by lustful feeling; the individual affected lives in\r\nfancies, in which he creates situations of this kind, and often attempts\r\nto realize them. By this perversion his sexual instinct is not\r\ninfrequently made more or less insensible to the normal stimulus of the\r\nopposite sex,—incapable of a normal vita sexualis,—psychically impotent.\r\nBut this psychical impotence does not in any way depend upon a _horror\r\nsexus alterius_, but upon the fact that this perverse instinct finds an\r\nadequate satisfaction differing from the normal,—in woman, to be sure,\r\nbut not in coitus.\r\n\r\nBut cases also occur, in which, with the perverse impulse, there is also\r\nsensibility, in a measure, to normal stimuli, and intercourse under\r\nnormal conditions takes place. In other cases the impotence is not\r\npurely psychical, but physical, _i.e._, spinal; for this perversion,\r\nlike almost all other perversions of the sexual instinct, is developed\r\nonly on the basis of a psychopathic and, for the most part, hereditarily\r\npredisposed individuality; and, as a rule, such individuals give\r\nthemselves up to excesses, particularly masturbation, to which the\r\ndifficulty of attaining what their fancy creates, drives them again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe number of cases of undoubted masochism thus far observed is very\r\nlarge. Whether masochism occurs associated with normal sexual instincts,\r\nor exclusively controls the individual; whether, and to what extent, the\r\nindividual subject to this perversion strives to realize his peculiar\r\nfancies or not; whether he has thus more or less diminished his virility\r\nor not,—depends upon the degree of intensity of the perversion in the\r\nsingle case, and upon the strength of the opposing ethical and æsthetic\r\nmotives, as well as the relative power of the physical and mental\r\norganization, of the affected individual. The essential thing, from the\r\npsychopathic point of view, and the common element in all these cases,\r\nis _the fact that the sexual instinct is directed to ideas of\r\nsubjugation and abuse by the opposite sex_.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said with reference to the impulsive character\r\n(indistinctness of motive) of the resulting acts, and with reference to\r\nthe original (congenital) nature of the perversion in sadism, is also\r\ntrue in masochism.\r\n\r\nIn masochism there is also a gradation of the acts from the most\r\nrepulsive and monstrous to the silliest, in accordance with the degree\r\nof intensity of the perverse instinct, and the power of the remnants of\r\nmoral and æsthetic motives that oppose it. The ultimate consequences of\r\nmasochism, however, are opposed by the instinct of self-preservation,\r\nand, therefore, murder and serious injury, which may be committed in\r\nsadistic excitement, have here, as far as known, no passive equivalent\r\nin reality; but the perverse desires of masochistic individuals may, in\r\nimagination, attain these extreme consequences (_v. infra_, Case 54).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the acts to which masochists give themselves up, are performed\r\nin some cases in connection with coitus, _i.e._, as preparatory\r\nmeasures; in others, as substitutes for coitus when that is impossible.\r\nHere, too, this depends only upon the condition of sexual power, which\r\nhas been diminished for the most part physically and mentally by the\r\nactivity of the sexual ideas in the perverse direction, and not upon the\r\nnature of the act itself.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Desire for Abuse and Humiliation as a Means of Sexual\r\nSatisfaction._—The following detailed autobiography of a masochist,\r\ngives an exhaustive description of a typical case of this remarkable\r\nperversion:—\r\n\r\n  Case 44. I come of a neuropathic family, in which, with all kinds of\r\n  peculiarities of character and manner of life, there are several\r\n  abnormalities of a sexual nature. My imagination has always been very\r\n  lively, and was very early directed to sexual matters. As far as I can\r\n  remember, I was much given to onanism long before puberty. Even at\r\n  that time my thoughts were, for hours at a time, directed to\r\n  intercourse with females. But the relations in which I placed myself\r\n  with the opposite sex were entirely peculiar. I fancied that I was a\r\n  prisoner and absolutely in a woman’s power, and that this woman used\r\n  her power to hurt and abuse me in every way possible. In this,\r\n  whipping and blows played an important part in my fancy, and there\r\n  were many other acts and situations which all expressed the condition\r\n  of vassalage and subjection. I saw myself constantly kneeling before\r\n  my ideal, trod upon, loaded with chains, and imprisoned. Severe\r\n  punishments of all kinds were inflicted on me, to test my obedience\r\n  and please my mistress. The more severely I was humiliated and abused,\r\n  the more I indulged in these thoughts. (At the same time I developed a\r\n  great preference for velvet and fur, which I liked to touch and\r\n  smooth, and which likewise excited me sexually.)\r\n\r\n  I remember well that when a child I received many actual whippings at\r\n  the hands of females. They never caused me any other feeling than pain\r\n  and shame; never have I thought to connect such realities with my\r\n  fancies. A threat to punish me severely and correct me agitated me\r\n  painfully; but in my fancy I assumed a desire on the part of my\r\n  “mistress” to enjoy my suffering and humiliation, which entranced me.\r\n  Too, I have never brought into relation with my fancies the acts and\r\n  orders of the females that have taken care of me. I was early able to\r\n  discover the truth about the relation of the sexes; but this knowledge\r\n  made no impression on me. The idea of sensual pleasure remained\r\n  connected with the fancies with which it was originally associated. I\r\n  also had the desire to touch females, to embrace and kiss them, but I\r\n  looked for the greatest delight only in their maltreatment, and in\r\n  situations in which they would cause me to feel their power. I soon\r\n  came to realize that I differed from other men, and preferred to be\r\n  alone and absorbed in my dreams. In my boyhood, real girls and women\r\n  had but little interest for me; for I saw no possibility of having\r\n  them act in the way I desired. On lonely paths in the forest I whipped\r\n  myself with branches that had fallen from the trees, and allowed my\r\n  imagination to play in the habitual way. I reveled in the sight of\r\n  pictures of commanding women, particularly if, like queens, they wore\r\n  furs. I read everything related to my cherished ideas. “Rousseau’s\r\n  Confessions,” which then fell into my hands, was a great discovery. I\r\n  found a condition described that resembled mine in essentials. I was\r\n  still more astonished at the similarity of my ideas to those I read of\r\n  in the writings of Sacher-Masoch. I devoured them all with avidity,\r\n  though the blood-curdling scenes often far outdid my imagination, and\r\n  then excited my aversion. Later, in order to supply new food for my\r\n  fancy, I began to write descriptions of erotic scenes to my taste, and\r\n  to make drawings of situations which, up to this time, I had painted\r\n  only in imagination. In this, reality was entirely an indifferent\r\n  matter to me. In the presence of a woman I was devoid of every sensual\r\n  feeling; at most, at the sight of a feminine foot, there would come a\r\n  fleeting wish to be trod upon by it.\r\n\r\n  This indifference, however, was only in relation to pure sensuality.\r\n  In late boyhood and early youth I was subject to an enthusiastic\r\n  partiality for young girls of my acquaintance, with all the\r\n  extravagances common to this youthful enthusiasm. But it never\r\n  occurred to me to connect the world of my sensual thoughts with these\r\n  pure ideals. I never had to overcome such a thought; one never came to\r\n  me. This is the more remarkable, since to me my lustful fancies seemed\r\n  very strange and unattainable in reality, but in no wise vile or\r\n  obnoxious. This, too, was a kind of poetry with me; but it was divided\r\n  into two worlds,—on the one hand was my heart, or, rather, my\r\n  æsthetically excited fancy; on the other, my sensually inflamed\r\n  imagination. While my “elevated” feeling always had a certain young\r\n  girl for its object, at other times I saw myself at the feet of a\r\n  mature woman, who treated me as previously described. I never placed\r\n  any lady of my acquaintance in this rôle. In dreams the two spheres of\r\n  my erotic ideas occurred alternately, but never combined. Only the\r\n  images of the sensual sphere induced pollutions.\r\n\r\n  In my nineteenth year I allowed myself, with outward reluctance, but\r\n  with inward desire, to be taken by friends to visit prostitutes. But\r\n  there I experienced nothing but repugnance and aversion, and left as\r\n  soon as possible, without having felt the faintest trace of sensual\r\n  excitement. Later, on my own initiative, I repeated the attempt, in\r\n  order to convince myself as to whether I was impotent or not; for I\r\n  was much troubled by my unexpected failure in the first instance. The\r\n  result was always the same,—I felt no excitement at all, and had not\r\n  the slightest erection. In the first place, it was not possible for me\r\n  to regard a real woman as an object of sensual gratification; and,\r\n  furthermore, I could not renounce the conditions and situations which\r\n  were the principal things _in sexualibus_ for me, and about which\r\n  nothing could induce me to speak a word. Imissio penis—the act to be\r\n  undertaken by me—seemed to me absolutely senseless and unclean. Again,\r\n  in the second place, there was also my repugnance for common women,\r\n  and fear of infection.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime, in secret, my sexual life went on in the old fashion.\r\n  Whenever my old fancies came to mind, violent erection occurred, and I\r\n  provoked ejaculations almost daily. I began to suffer with all kinds\r\n  of nervous troubles, and now regarded myself as impotent, in spite of\r\n  powerful erections and intense desire when I was alone. Nevertheless,\r\n  from time to time I continued my experiments with prostitutes. In time\r\n  I overcame my timidity, and in part my aversion to contact with common\r\n  women; but I remained absolutely cold.\r\n\r\n  After I had, with advancing years, overcome to some extent my shyness\r\n  and my inclination to indulge in dreams, in my sexual thought there\r\n  was an approach to the normal, as I began to direct my interest to\r\n  real persons. I was even successful in directing sensual thoughts to\r\n  women of my acquaintance, without carrying over any of my peculiar\r\n  ideas from the other sphere. Thus I had some affairs with respectable\r\n  girls. Embracing and kissing occurred; desire was excited, but not the\r\n  power,—at least, it was too weak to allow me to think that under\r\n  normal circumstances I should be virile. Of course, the attention I\r\n  gave to the excitation of my sexual power was not calculated to favor\r\n  this. Thus, always greatly ashamed, I broke off the relations.\r\n\r\n  With this, my old habit continued. I was still a great onanist, even\r\n  though with lessened power. But my fancy no longer satisfied me\r\n  entirely. I now began to follow both respectable women and others on\r\n  the street; in winter, particularly those wearing velvet and furs. I\r\n  often followed prostitutes to their homes, and had them perform\r\n  manustupration. I always thought I should find more real pleasure in\r\n  that than in my fancies; but it was always less. When the woman took\r\n  off her garments, my interest followed them. The empty clothing has\r\n  never attracted me very strongly, but more than the nude female. The\r\n  real object of my interest was the attired woman. In this, velvet and\r\n  furs play the most important part; but also all other articles of\r\n  attire attracted me, and particularly the form as brought out by\r\n  lacing and padding. I had scarcely any other interest in the nude\r\n  female form than an æsthetic one. I have always had a very great\r\n  interest in the shoes of women, particularly in slippers with high\r\n  heels, which is always connected with the thought of being trod upon,\r\n  or of submissively kissing the foot.\r\n\r\n  At last I overcame the last vestige of my shyness, and one day, to\r\n  realize my dreams, had myself whipped, trod upon, etc., by a\r\n  prostitute. The result was a _great disappointment_. What was done to\r\n  me I felt to be rough, repugnant, and silly. The blows caused me\r\n  nothing but pain; the situation, repugnance and shame. Nevertheless, I\r\n  induced an ejaculation mechanically, with which, with the help of my\r\n  imagination, I transformed the real situation into that for which I\r\n  longed. This—the really desired situation—differed from the actual\r\n  essentially in that I created in imagination a woman who abused me\r\n  with the same pleasure that I experienced in her maltreatment of me.\r\n\r\n  All my sexual fancies were erected on the assumption in the woman of a\r\n  tyrannical, cruel disposition, to which I wished to be subject. The\r\n  act expressing the relation was a secondary matter to me. After the\r\n  first attempt at an impossible realization, it was perfectly clear to\r\n  me toward what my longing was directed. To be sure, in my lustful\r\n  dreams, I had often passed beyond all ideas of abuse, and conceived a\r\n  commanding woman, with an imperious mien, a word of command, a kiss on\r\n  the foot, etc; but now I fully realized what it was that attracted me,\r\n  and that flagellation was only the strongest means of expressing the\r\n  principle, and in itself secondary.\r\n\r\n  In spite of this disappointment, after the first step, I did not\r\n  abandon my efforts to realize my erotic ideas. I was confident that,\r\n  when once accustomed to the new reality, my fancy would find food in\r\n  it for more intense activity. For my purpose I sought the most\r\n  suitable women, and instructed them carefully in a complicated comedy.\r\n  In this I occasionally found that the way had been prepared for me by\r\n  predecessors of like disposition. The value of these comedies, for the\r\n  effect of my fancy on my sensuality, remained problematical. What\r\n  these acts and scenes did for me, in the way of intensifying the\r\n  subsidiary circumstances of the desired situation, caused a diminution\r\n  of the intensity of the principal element, which my unaided fancy,\r\n  without the consciousness of planned, coarse deception, could more\r\n  easily bring up before me. My physical sensations, under the various\r\n  punishments, were changeable. The more perfect the self-deception, the\r\n  more perfectly the pain was felt as pleasure.\r\n\r\n  Or, more correctly, the punishment was then conceived as a symbolic\r\n  act. From this arose the illusion of the desired situation, which was\r\n  then accompanied by an intense psychical feeling of pleasure. The\r\n  lustful feeling then spread out over the whole body in lustful\r\n  physical sensations, and thus the perception of the painful quality of\r\n  the punishment was overcome. The process in the moral punishments—the\r\n  humiliations to which I subjected myself—was similar, but simpler;\r\n  because it was confined to the mental sphere. These were also attended\r\n  with pleasurable feeling when the self-deception succeeded. It was\r\n  seldom, however, that it succeeded well, and never perfectly; there\r\n  always remained a disturbing element in consciousness. Therefore, in\r\n  the intervals, I returned to solitary onanism. Moreover, in the other\r\n  case, the conclusion of the act was usually an ejaculation provoked by\r\n  onanism; often an ejaculation without the aid of mechanical means.\r\n\r\n  Thus I went on for many years, with diminishing power, but with\r\n  slightly diminished desire, and with the power of my peculiar sexual\r\n  idea over me unchanged. And at present the condition of my vita\r\n  sexualis is the same. Coitus, which I have never performed, still\r\n  seems to me a strange and unclean act. I learned about it from\r\n  descriptions of sexual dissipations. My own sexual ideas seem natural,\r\n  and do not in the least offend my sensitive taste. Their realization,\r\n  as previously mentioned, for various reasons, leaves me unsatisfied. I\r\n  am pleased with pretty girls and women of respectability, but for a\r\n  long time I have ceased to approach them. I have never attained, not\r\n  even partially, a direct, actual realization of my sexual fancy. As\r\n  often as I have come into close relation with females, I have felt the\r\n  woman’s will to be beneath mine, never _vice versâ_. I have never met\r\n  a woman manifesting a desire of mastery in sexual things. Women who\r\n  wish to rule in the household and exercise petticoat sovereignty are\r\n  entirely different from my erotic ideals.\r\n\r\n  My whole personality presents many abnormalities besides the\r\n  perversion of my vita sexualis; my neuropathic condition is expressed\r\n  in many mental and physical symptoms. Besides, I think I recognize in\r\n  myself an original abnormality of character in the nature of a\r\n  resemblance to the feminine type; at least, I regard as of this nature\r\n  my great weakness of will, and my great lack of courage in the\r\n  presence of men and animals, which is in contrast with my coolness in\r\n  the face of peril. My external appearance is entirely masculine.\r\n\r\nThe author of this autobiography also made me the following\r\ncommunication:—\r\n\r\n  “I always sought to find out whether the peculiar ideas that ruled me\r\n  sexually were entertained by other men. Since the first stories about\r\n  it accidentally came to my ears, I have sought everywhere to learn of\r\n  it. Since it is really a process of inner consciousness, it is, of\r\n  course, not easy to identify it, and it cannot always be done with\r\n  certainty; but I assume the existence of masochism where I find\r\n  perverse sexual acts that cannot be explained except by this\r\n  dominating idea. I look upon this anomaly as wide-spread.\r\n\r\n  “I have heard numerous stories about it from prostitutes here in\r\n  Berlin, and in Vienna; and I thus learned how numerous my\r\n  fellow-sufferers are. I am always careful not to describe my own\r\n  experiences, or ask whether they know of such; but I allow these\r\n  persons to relate their experiences just as they will.\r\n\r\n  “Simple flagellation is so common that almost every prostitute is\r\n  familiar with it; but cases of real masochism are very frequent. The\r\n  men subject to this perversion submit themselves to the most refined\r\n  cruelties. In this they always act the same farce with the instructed\r\n  prostitutes,—humiliating subjection of the man, treading upon him,\r\n  commands, threats, and scoldings that have been committed to memory;\r\n  then flagellation, blows on various portions of the body, and all\r\n  kinds of punishment, pricking with needles, etc. The scenes often end\r\n  with coitus, but more frequently with ejaculation without it. Twice\r\n  prostitutes have shown me heavy iron chains with handcuffs, which\r\n  their patrons had made for them to put on them; and the dried peas, on\r\n  which they kneeled; the seat set with needles, on which they sat at\r\n  command; and many other similar things. Often the perverted man wishes\r\n  the woman to tie his penis so tightly as to cause pain; to prick it\r\n  with needles, make cuts in it with a knife, or beat it with a stick.\r\n  Even the act of hanging is indulged in, it being cut short at just the\r\n  right moment. Others have themselves scratched with a knife or dagger,\r\n  but in the act the woman must threaten them with death. In all these\r\n  things the symbolism of subjection is the most important factor. The\r\n  woman is usually called ‘mistress’; the man, ‘slave.’\r\n\r\n  “A man of high social standing, dressed as a servant, sat on the box\r\n  of a carriage and drove his mistress about. Here there may have been a\r\n  conscious imitation of the ‘Venus in Furs.’ It seems to me that the\r\n  writings of Sacher-Masoch have done much to develop this perversion in\r\n  those predisposed. It is peculiar that the inexplicable enthusiasm for\r\n  furs is so frequently combined with this perversion. It, as well as\r\n  that for velvet, has been peculiar to me from my earliest youth.\r\n\r\n  “All these comedies with prostitutes are for masochists only\r\n  troublesome substitutes. Whether there is such a thing as a\r\n  realization of masochistic dreams in love relations or not, I do not\r\n  know. If it occur, it is certainly very infrequent; for this taste in\r\n  women (sadism in women, as described by Sacher-Masoch) is very\r\n  difficult to find; and, too, the expression of sexual abnormalities\r\n  finds greater obstacles in the modesty of women, etc., than in men. I\r\n  myself have never noticed the slightest indications of anything of\r\n  this kind, and have never been able to attempt an actual realization\r\n  of my fancies. Once a man confidingly told me of his masochistic\r\n  perversion, and said he had found his ideal.”\r\n\r\nThe two following cases are similar to the foregoing:—\r\n\r\n  Case 45. Mr. Z., aged 29, technicist, came for consultation because of\r\n  a fear of tabes. Father was nervous and died tabetic. Father’s sister\r\n  was insane. Several relatives are very nervous and peculiar. On closer\r\n  examination the patient is found to have sexual, spinal, and cerebral\r\n  asthenia. He presents no symptoms of tabes dorsalis, nor does he give\r\n  a history of them. Questions concerning abuse of the sexual organs\r\n  bring out a confession of masturbation practiced since youth. In the\r\n  course of the examination the following interesting psycho-sexual\r\n  anomalies came out: At the age of five the vita sexualis began with\r\n  the impulse to whip himself, as well as with the desire to see others\r\n  whipped. In this he never thought of individuals as of one sex or the\r\n  other. _Faute de mieux_ he practiced flagellation on himself and, in\r\n  time, this induced ejaculation. Long before this he had begun to\r\n  satisfy himself with masturbation, and always during the act reveled\r\n  in imaginary scenes of whipping. After growing up he twice visited\r\n  brothels to have himself flogged by prostitutes. For this purpose he\r\n  chose the prettiest girl he could find; but he was disappointed, and\r\n  did not even have an erection, to say nothing of ejaculation. He\r\n  recognized that the flagellation was subsidiary, and that the idea of\r\n  subjection to the woman’s will was the important thing. He realized\r\n  this on the second trial. When he had the “thought of subjection,” he\r\n  was perfectly successful. In time, by straining his imagination with\r\n  masochistic ideas, he performed coitus without flagellation; but he\r\n  found little satisfaction in it; so that he performed sexual\r\n  intercourse in a masochistic way. He found pleasure in masochistic\r\n  scenes, in the sense of his original desire for flagellation, only\r\n  when he was flagellated _ad podicem_, or, at least, only when he\r\n  called up such a situation in imagination. At times of great\r\n  excitability it was even sufficient if a pretty girl told stories of\r\n  such scenes. He would thus have an orgasm, and usually ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  A very effectual fetichistic idea was early associated with this. He\r\n  noticed that he was attracted and satisfied only by women wearing high\r\n  heels and short jackets (“Hungarian fashion”). He does not know how he\r\n  arrived at this fetichistic idea. Boys’ legs with high heels also\r\n  pleased him, but this charm was purely æsthetic, without any sensual\r\n  coloring; and he said he had never noticed anything homo-sexual in\r\n  himself. The patient referred his fetichism to his partiality for\r\n  calves (legs). He is charmed by ladies’ calves only when elegant shoes\r\n  are on the feet. Nude legs—feminine nudity in general—do not in the\r\n  least affect him sexually. A subordinate fetichistic idea for the\r\n  patient is the masculine ear. It is a lustful pleasure for him to pet\r\n  the ears of handsome men, _i.e._, men having beautiful ears. With men\r\n  this pleasure is slight, but with women it gives him great enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  He also has a weakness for cats. He thinks them simply beautiful; and\r\n  their movements are very attractive to him. The sight of a cat can\r\n  raise him from a feeling of the deepest depression. Cats seem to him\r\n  sacred; he sees something divine in them! He does not know the reason\r\n  for this idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\n  Of late he has also frequently had sadistic ideas about punishing\r\n  boys. In these imaginary flagellations both men and women play a part,\r\n  but particularly the latter; and then his enjoyment is much more\r\n  intense.\r\n\r\n  The patient finds that, with that which he recognizes and feels as\r\n  masochism, there is something else which he prefers to designate\r\n  “pageism.”\r\n\r\n  While his masochistic fancies and acts are entirely of a coarse,\r\n  sensual nature, his “pageism” consists of the idea of being a page to\r\n  a beautiful girl. He conceives her as perfectly chaste, but piquant;\r\n  his relation to her, that of a slave, but perfectly chaste,—a purely\r\n  platonic submission. This reveling in the idea of serving such a\r\n  “beautiful creature” as a page, is colored by a pleasurable feeling;\r\n  but this is in no way sexual. He experienced in it an exquisite\r\n  feeling of moral satisfaction, in contrast with the sensually-colored\r\n  masochism; and, therefore, he could but regard it as something of a\r\n  different nature.\r\n\r\n  At first sight there was nothing remarkable in the patient’s\r\n  appearance; but his pelvis is abnormally broad, the ilia are flat, and\r\n  the pelvis, as a whole, tilted and decidedly feminine. Eyes,\r\n  neuropathic. He also mentions that he often has itching and lustful\r\n  irritation at the anus, and that there (“erogenous” area), _ope\r\n  digiti_, he can satisfy himself.\r\n\r\n  The patient is troubled about his future. Help would be possible for\r\n  him if he could but excite in himself an interest in women, but his\r\n  will and imagination were too weak for that.\r\n\r\nWhat the patient designates as “pageism” does not differ in any way from\r\nmasochism, as may be seen when it is compared with the following cases\r\nof symbolic masochism, and others; and, further, upon the consideration\r\nthat in this perversion coitus is avoided as an inadequate act; and from\r\nthe fact that in such cases there is often a fantastic exaltation of the\r\nperverse ideal:—\r\n\r\n  Case 46. X, writer, aged 28, predisposed. Sexually hyperæsthetic from\r\n  childhood. At the age of six he had dreams of being whipped ad nates\r\n  by a woman. After them he would awake in intense lustful excitement;\r\n  and thus he came to practice onanism. When eight years old he once\r\n  asked the cook to whip him. From his tenth year, neurasthenia. Until\r\n  his twenty-fifth year he had dreams of flagellation, or similar waking\r\n  fancies, and indulged in onanism. Three years ago he had an impulse to\r\n  have himself whipped by a puella. The patient was undeceived, for\r\n  neither erection nor ejaculation occurred. At twenty-seven, another\r\n  effort, with the thought to enforce erection and ejaculation. This was\r\n  finally made possible by the following artifice: While coitus was\r\n  attempted, the puella had to tell him how she had mercilessly flogged\r\n  other impotent men, and threaten him with the same. Besides this, it\r\n  was necessary for him to fancy that he was bound, entirely in the\r\n  woman’s power, helpless, and most painfully beaten by her.\r\n  Occasionally, in order to become potent, it was necessary to have\r\n  himself actually bound. Thus coitus was possible. Pollutions were\r\n  accompanied by lustful feeling only when he (infrequently) dreamed\r\n  that he was abused, or that he looked on while a puella whipped\r\n  others. He never had an intense, lustful pleasure in coitus. The only\r\n  things in women that interest him are the hands. Powerful women with\r\n  big fists are his preference. At the same time, his desire for\r\n  flagellation is only ideal; for with his great cutaneous\r\n  sensitiveness, at the most, a few strokes are sufficient. Blows from\r\n  men were repugnant to him. He wishes to marry. From the impossibility\r\n  of asking a decent woman to perform flagellation, and the doubt about\r\n  being potent with such a woman, spring his embarrassment and desire to\r\n  recover.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing three cases, for the most part, passive flagellation\r\nserves the individual subject to this perversion of masochism as an\r\nexpression of the desired situation of subjection to the woman. The same\r\nmeans is needed by a large number of masochists. But passive\r\nflagellation is a process which, as is known, has a tendency to induce\r\nerection reflexly by irritation of the nerves of the nates.[61] This\r\neffect of flagellation is used by weakened debauchees to help their\r\ndiminished power; and this perversity—not perversion—is very common. It\r\nis, therefore, necessary to ascertain in what relation the passive\r\nflagellation of the masochists stands to these dissipated individuals\r\nwho are not psychically perverse, but physically weakened.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to show that masochism is something essentially\r\ndifferent from flagellation, and more comprehensive; that flagellation\r\nis rather a by-play,—one of the many means used for the purpose of\r\nmasochistic gratification in the sense of subjection to the woman. For\r\nthe masochist the principal thing is subjection to the woman; the\r\npunishment is only the expression of this relation,—the most intense\r\neffect of it he can bring upon himself. For him the act has only a\r\nsymbolic value, and is a means to the end of mental satisfaction of his\r\npeculiar desires. The essential thing is the desire for ill-treatment,\r\nas a sign of this subjection. Besides flagellation, and often without\r\nit, there are many other things which serve to express this subjection;\r\nas is shown by the following series of cases. This fact establishes a\r\npresumption of the existence of an original anomaly of sexual feeling,—a\r\nparæsthesia sexualis. On the other hand, the individual that is weakened\r\nand not a subject of masochism, and who has himself flagellated, desires\r\nonly a mechanical irritation of his spinal centre.\r\n\r\nWhether, in a given case, it is simple (reflex) flagellation or\r\nmasochism, is made clear by the individual’s statements, and often by\r\nthe secondary circumstances. The determination depends upon the\r\nfollowing facts:—\r\n\r\nIn the _first_ place, the impulse to passive flagellation exists _ab\r\norigine_ in the masochist. The desire is felt before there has been any\r\nexperience of the reflex effect, often first in dreams; as, for example,\r\nin Case 48. _Secondly_, with the masochist, as a rule, the flagellation\r\nis only one of many and various punishments which come into his mind as\r\nfancies and are often realized. In these other punishments, and the\r\nfrequent acts expressing purely symbolic humiliations, which occur by\r\nthe side of flagellation, there can, of course, be no thought of a\r\nreflex physical irritative effect. _Thirdly_, it is significant that, in\r\nthe masochist, when the desired flagellation is carried out, it need\r\nhave no aphrodisiac effect at all. Very often, indeed, there is a more\r\nor less perfect disappointment; in fact, always, if the masochist is not\r\nsuccessful in his desire to create, by means of the pre-arranged\r\nprogramme, the illusion of the desired situation (to be in the woman’s\r\npower), so that the woman ordered to carry out the act seems to be\r\nnothing more than the executive agent of his own will. If one cannot\r\ntickle one’s self, no more can one feel one’s self subject to a woman\r\ndirected by one’s own will. In reference to this important point,\r\ncompare the three foregoing cases and Case 50.\r\n\r\nBetween masochism and simple (reflex) flagellation, there is a relation\r\nsomewhat analogous to that existing between contrary sexual instinct and\r\nacquired pederasty. It does not lessen the value of this opinion that,\r\nin the masochist, the flagellation may also have the known reflex\r\neffect; or that a whipping received in childhood may have aroused lust\r\nfor the first time, and thus simultaneously excited the latent\r\nmasochistically-constituted vita sexualis. In this event, the case must\r\nbe characterized by the conditions mentioned above, under the heads of\r\n“_secondly_” and “_thirdly_,” in order to be masochistic. If the details\r\nof the origin of the case are not known, other circumstances, such as\r\nthose mentioned above under “_secondly_,” would make it clearly\r\nmasochistic. This is illustrated in the two following cases:—\r\n\r\n  Case 47. A patient of Tarnowsky’s had a person in his confidence rent\r\n  a house during his attacks, and instruct its _personnel_ (three\r\n  prostitutes) in what was to be done with him. He would come there, and\r\n  was there undressed, manustuprated, and flagellated, as ordered. He\r\n  pretended to offer resistance, and begged for mercy; then, as ordered,\r\n  he was allowed to eat and sleep. But in spite of protest he was kept\r\n  there, and beaten if he did not submit. Thus the affair would go on\r\n  for some days. When the attack was over, he was dismissed; and he\r\n  returned to his wife and children, who had no suspicion of his\r\n  disease. The attacks occurred once or twice a year. (Tarnowsky, _op.\r\n  cit._)\r\n\r\n  Case 48. X., aged 34, greatly predisposed, suffers with contrary\r\n  sexual instinct. For various reasons he had no opportunity to satisfy\r\n  himself with men, in spite of great sexual desire. Occasionally he\r\n  dreamed that a woman whipped him, and then had a pollution.\r\n\r\n  Through this dream he came to have prostitutes beat him as a\r\n  substitute for love with men. Occasionally he would obtain a\r\n  prostitute, undress himself completely (while she was not to take off\r\n  a thing), and have her tread upon him, whip, and beat him. Qua re\r\n  summa libidine affectus pedem feminæ lambit quod solum eum libidinosum\r\n  facere potest: tum ejaculationem assequitur. Then disgust at the\r\n  morally-debasing situation occurred, and he retired as quickly as\r\n  possible.\r\n\r\nCases occur, however, in which passive flagellation alone constitutes\r\nthe entire content of the masochistic fancies, without other ideas of\r\nhumiliation, etc., and without any clear consciousness of the real\r\nnature of this expression of submission. Such cases are difficult to\r\ndifferentiate from those of simple reflex flagellation. A knowledge of\r\nthe primary origin of the desire, before any experience of reflex\r\nstimuli (_v. supra_, under “_first_”), is the only thing that makes the\r\ndifferential diagnosis certain; taken with the circumstance that genuine\r\nmasochists are perverse in their youth, and that the realization of\r\ntheir desires usually comes late, or undeceives them (_v. supra_, under\r\n“_thirdly_”); for the whole thing, for the most part, belongs to the\r\nsphere of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe following case is of this nature:—\r\n\r\n  Case 49. _Autobiography._—In January, 1891, I received the following\r\n  letter from a gentleman in Hungary: “In depression and despair of a\r\n  life that shuts me out from all that makes human happiness, I come to\r\n  you with the last gleam of hope of rescue from a condition which, if\r\n  it continue, can end only tragically.\r\n\r\n  “I am thirty years old, and come of a mother who suffered with\r\n  periodical insanity. As early as my fourteenth year abnormal sexual\r\n  tendencies were noticeable in me. It always gave me a certain lustful\r\n  pleasure to be whipped by boys of my own age, particularly when I was\r\n  taken over the knee and spanked. It particularly delighted me when\r\n  this was done by handsome young persons or boys having well formed\r\n  legs and closely-fitting trousers. By means of such ideas I also came\r\n  to masturbate; and I practiced onanism quite frequently,—almost daily,\r\n  and, in fact, in absolute ignorance of the terrible results of the\r\n  vice. Thus it continued until my eighteenth year, when, thus far\r\n  absolutely unsuspecting, I was made aware of the vicious results of\r\n  the practice.\r\n\r\n  “From this time began the terrible struggle with the desire to give it\r\n  up, which I only too often abandoned. The fancies mentioned did not\r\n  leave me; I longed to be whipped by handsome young persons aged from\r\n  twenty to twenty-two years, wearing tight trousers. My fancy was\r\n  filled especially with young soldiers and hussars. At times I was able\r\n  to repress my imagination and avoid onanism; but I then had pollutions\r\n  with dreams of the same nature.\r\n\r\n  “After my twentieth year, to my astonishment, the sexual inclination\r\n  toward women, which I had noticed in comrades of my own age, and the\r\n  occurrence of which I expected in myself, did not appear. I was cold\r\n  toward women, and embarrassed in their presence. At the same time,\r\n  feminine nudity was not unpleasant; on the contrary, there was\r\n  something attractive about it, but my sensuality was not excited.\r\n\r\n  “I twice attempted coitus; I was not troubled about being in bed with\r\n  the girl, but rather kissed and embraced her with pleasure, and even\r\n  had traces of erection, but that was all. Since then I have had no\r\n  hope, and occasionally returned to onanism, which I had avoided for\r\n  some months previously. Nevertheless, I cultivated social intercourse\r\n  with ladies, and particularly young girls; and I was esteemed in\r\n  society, and liked for my graceful dancing. I was always hoping that\r\n  in this way my unhappy tendency would be overcome successfully, but in\r\n  vain; it grew constantly stronger. Thus I have lived hours of\r\n  wretchedness; and the ghost of suicide has passed before me. I once\r\n  confided in a physician in Pesth, but he had only the usual remedies\r\n  for persons suffering with sexual weakness,—cold baths, quieting\r\n  medicines, intercourse with women, etc.\r\n\r\n  “I tried everything in vain, until by accident a book on contrary\r\n  sexual instinct fell into my hands, and gave me the last ray of hope.\r\n  I have a respected position as a merchant, and appreciate thoroughly\r\n  the joys of family life; and I have an opportunity to marry, under the\r\n  most favorable circumstances, a young girl whom I love, and who loves\r\n  me. But I feel the cruel impossibility of this step. I suffer terribly\r\n  in thinking about these repulsive abnormalities. My only hope lies in\r\n  a cure by means of hypnosis. May it not be in vain!”\r\n\r\n  Pity and a scientific interest induced me to invite the writer of the\r\n  preceding lines to come to see me. Early in February Mr. D. came. He\r\n  was distinguished, pleasing, and masculine in appearance. Examination\r\n  of the case showed it to be one of masochism. He distinctly remembered\r\n  that, when he once saw fellow-pupils whipped by the teacher, it gave\r\n  him a feeling of lustful pleasure. He cannot remember that he was ever\r\n  whipped by a teacher. His masochism had been an _absolutely primary\r\n  manifestation_, and incomprehensible to him. Only gradually and _faute\r\n  de mieux_ had he come to practice onanism, during which ideas of\r\n  flagellation, in which he played the passive _rôle_, filled his mind.\r\n  He had never had desire to be whipped by the teacher; he always wished\r\n  to be flogged by fellow-pupils and well-grown young persons. Since\r\n  maturity he had never been able to induce himself to satisfy his\r\n  masochistic inclinations.\r\n\r\n  In intercourse with puellis he had repeatedly had the thought to have\r\n  himself whipped by them; but since this was not accompanied by sensual\r\n  feeling, it was not carried out. The patient declares that his\r\n  inclinations toward persons of his own sex are purely masochistic. In\r\n  other respects he finds nothing interesting in men. Until his\r\n  eighteenth year the patient had also sadistic tendencies. He was\r\n  enthusiastic about the position of the pedagogue and wanted to be a\r\n  teacher in order to be able to flog boys. _This ideal sadism later\r\n  disappeared entirely._ The patient complains that he feels alone in\r\n  the world, like a pariah, and that he is different from other men. But\r\n  his libido toward women had much diminished, possibly as a result of\r\n  his masturbation. He had no erection at the sight of feminine charms,\r\n  but the sight of a riding-whip or a cane excited him powerfully\r\n  sexually. When he attempted coitus, no masochistic ideas occurred.\r\n  Such ideas arose, however, whenever he saw attractive young men. He\r\n  believed that if he were freed from his ideas of flagellation, he\r\n  would be helped; for his sensuality would then direct itself in a\r\n  normal path.\r\n\r\n  The patient has neuropathic eyes, but is free from all degenerative\r\n  signs. In the direction of hereditary taint, it is noteworthy that his\r\n  maternal grandfather was peculiar, and shot himself while in a\r\n  psychopathic condition. The patient feels well, save for slight\r\n  neurasthenic troubles. Patellar reflex increased. The genitals are\r\n  perfectly normal. His dreams with pollutions are exclusively about\r\n  flagellation by young persons, particularly soldiers with tight\r\n  trousers.\r\n\r\n  The principles of treatment laid down were: 1. Removal of the symptoms\r\n  of neurasthenia. 2. Suggestive treatment looking to (_a_) avoidance of\r\n  onanism; (_b_) indifference toward his own sex and the disappearance\r\n  of thoughts of flagellation, both while awake and asleep; (_c_) libido\r\n  exclusively toward persons of the opposite sex, the occurrence of\r\n  erections at sight of beautiful women, complete power with women, and\r\n  dreams of women exclusively. At the first sitting, by means of\r\n  Bernheim’s method, the patient passed quickly into a state of deep\r\n  lethargy. At the second sitting (February 5) a cataleptic condition of\r\n  the muscles was induced. Sittings almost daily. It was seen that\r\n  stroking the brow induced deeper hypnosis with catalepsy, which,\r\n  however, did not go beyond deep lethargy. Suggestion was begun in the\r\n  third sitting.\r\n\r\n  February 10. The patient says that he has no longer any interest in\r\n  men, but a growing interest in women. He begins to dream of women.\r\n\r\n  February 13. He feels himself free from masochism during the day, and\r\n  canes and whipping do not interest him any more. At night he still has\r\n  “weak” dreams of flagellation concerning men, but without lustful\r\n  feeling or pollution. A short time ago he had had a dream that was\r\n  entirely strange, and without erotic coloring, to the effect that he\r\n  whipped himself.\r\n\r\n  February 19. The patient attempted coitus with a puella pleasing to\r\n  him. Erection was incomplete, and ejaculation did not occur; so he\r\n  gave up the attempt. The patient finds that his libido toward women is\r\n  still very slight. He was not discouraged by his failure, and expected\r\n  ultimate success; for he felt free from his abnormal tendencies, and\r\n  like another man. On February 20, unfortunately, the patient had to\r\n  discontinue treatment, being called home by duties there.\r\n\r\nThe fact that traces of sadism (_v. infra_), were simultaneously\r\npresent, lends certainty to the diagnosis of this rudimentary case as\r\none of masochism. The purely psychical character of this latter\r\nperversion is unquestionable. At the same time, the case is combined\r\nwith incompletely developed contrary sexual instinct, an association not\r\ninfrequent in masochists and sadists.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this case of rudimentary masochism, in which there is\r\nsome difficulty of diagnosis, follows a typical case of masochism, in\r\nwhich the whole circle of ideas peculiar to this perversion appears\r\ncompletely developed. This case, in which there is a detailed personal\r\ndescription of the whole psychical state, is different from Case 44 only\r\nin that here there is no thought of a realization of the perverse\r\nfancies; and that, notwithstanding the perversion of the vita sexualis,\r\nnormal stimuli are so far effectual that sexual intercourse is possible\r\nunder normal conditions.\r\n\r\n  Case 50. I am thirty-five years old, mentally and physically normal.\r\n  Among all my relatives, in the direct as well as in the lateral line,\r\n  I know of no case of mental disease. My father, who, at my birth, was\r\n  thirty years old, as far as I know, had a preference for voluptuous,\r\n  large women.\r\n\r\n  Even in my early childhood I loved to revel in ideas about the\r\n  absolute mastery of one man over others. The thought of slavery had\r\n  something exciting in it for me, and alike whether from the\r\n  stand-point of master or servant. That one man could possess, sell, or\r\n  whip another, caused me intense excitement; and in reading “Uncle\r\n  Tom’s Cabin” (which I read at about the beginning of puberty), I had\r\n  erections. Particularly exciting for me was the thought of a man’s\r\n  being hitched up before a wagon in which another man sat with a whip,\r\n  driving and whipping him. Until my twentieth year these ideas were\r\n  purely objective and sexless,—_i.e._, the one in subjugation in my\r\n  fancy was another (not myself), and the master was not necessarily a\r\n  woman. These ideas were, therefore, without effect on my sexual\r\n  instinct,—_i.e._, on the way in which it was expressed. Though these\r\n  ideas caused erections, yet I have never masturbated in my life; and\r\n  from my nineteenth year I had coitus without the help of these ideas\r\n  and without any relation to them. I always had a great preference for\r\n  elderly, voluptuous, large women, though I did not scorn younger ones.\r\n\r\n  After my twenty-first year my ideas became objective, and it became an\r\n  essential thing that the “mistress” should be a woman over forty years\r\n  old, tall, and powerful. _From this time I was always, in my fancies,\r\n  the subject_; the “mistress” was a rough woman, who made use of me in\r\n  every way, also sexually; who harnessed me before a carriage, and made\r\n  me take her for a drive; whom I must follow like a dog; at whose feet\r\n  I must lie naked, and be punished—_i.e._, whipped—by her. This was the\r\n  constant element in my ideas, around which all others were grouped. In\r\n  these fancies I always found endless pleasure, which caused erection,\r\n  but never ejaculation. As a result of the induced sexual excitement, I\r\n  would immediately seek a woman, preferably one corresponding\r\n  exteriorly with my ideal, and have coitus with her without any actual\r\n  imitation of my fancies, and sometimes also without any thought of\r\n  them during the act. At the same time, I also had inclination toward\r\n  women of a different kind, and had coitus with them without being\r\n  impelled to it by my fancy.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding all this, my life was not exceedingly abnormal\r\n  sexually; yet these ideas were certain to occur periodically, and they\r\n  have remained essentially unchanged. With growing sexual desire, the\r\n  intervals constantly grew shorter. At the present time the ideas come\r\n  every two or three weeks. If I have had coitus, the occurrence of the\r\n  fancies is perhaps postponed. I have never attempted to realize my\r\n  very definite and characteristic ideas,—_i.e._, to connect them with\r\n  the objective world,—but I have contented myself with reveling in the\r\n  thoughts; because I was convinced that my ideal would not allow even\r\n  an approach to realization. The thought of a comedy with paid\r\n  prostitutes always seemed to me silly and purposeless; for a person\r\n  hired by me could never take the place in my imagination of a “cruel\r\n  mistress.” I doubt whether there are sadistically constituted women\r\n  like Sacher-Masoch’s heroines. But, if there were such women, and I\r\n  had the fortune (!) to find one, still, in a world of reality,\r\n  intercourse with her would always seem only like a farce to me.\r\n  Indeed, I can say that, were I to become the slave of a Messalina, I\r\n  believe that, owing to the other necessary renunciations, my desired\r\n  manner of life would soon pall on me, and in my lucid intervals I\r\n  should try to obtain my freedom at all hazards.\r\n\r\n  Yet I have found a way in which to induce, in a certain sense, a\r\n  realization. After my sexual desire has been intensely excited by\r\n  reveling in my fancy, I go to a prostitute and there call up before my\r\n  mind’s eye, with great intensity, some scene of the kind mentioned, in\r\n  which I play the principal _rôle_. After thinking of such a situation\r\n  for about half an hour, with a constantly resulting erection, I\r\n  perform coitus with increased lustful pleasure and strong ejaculation.\r\n  After the latter, the vision fades away. Ashamed, I depart as quickly\r\n  as possible, and try not to think of the affair. Then, for about two\r\n  weeks, I have no more such ideas; indeed, after a particularly\r\n  satisfactory coitus, it may happen that, until the next attack, I have\r\n  no sympathy whatever with masochistic ideas. But the next attack is\r\n  sure to come sooner or later. I must, however, state that I also have\r\n  coitus without being prepared by such ideas, especially, too, with\r\n  women that are acquainted with me and my position, and in whose\r\n  presence I abhor such fancies. _Under the latter circumstances,\r\n  however, I am not always potent, while, with masochistic ideas, my\r\n  virility is perfect._ It does not seem superfluous to add that\r\n  otherwise, in my thought and feeling, I am very æsthetic, and despise\r\n  anything like maltreatment of a human being. Finally, I will not leave\r\n  unmentioned the fact that the form of address is of importance. In my\r\n  fancies it is essential that the “mistress” address me in the second\r\n  person (_Du_), while I must address her in the third (_Sie_). This\r\n  circumstance of being thus familiarly addressed (_Du_) by a person so\r\n  inclined, as the expression of absolute mastery, has, from my youth,\r\n  given me lustful pleasure, and does to-day.\r\n\r\n  I had the fortune to find a wife who is in everything, but especially\r\n  sexually, attractive to me; though, as I scarcely need say, she in no\r\n  way resembles my masochistic ideal. She is gentle, but proud; for\r\n  without the latter characteristic I cannot conceive such a thing as\r\n  sexual charm. The first few months of married life were normal\r\n  sexually; the masochistic attacks did not occur, and I had almost lost\r\n  all thought of masochism. Then came the first confinement and the\r\n  necessary abstinence. Punctually, then, with the occurrence of libido,\r\n  came the masochistic fancies again, which, in spite of my great love\r\n  for my wife, necessitated coitus with another, with the accompaniment\r\n  of masochistic ideas. It is here worthy of note that _coitus\r\n  maritalis_, which was later resumed, did not prove sufficient to\r\n  banish the masochistic ideas, as masochistic coitus always does. As\r\n  for the essential element in masochism, I am of the opinion that the\r\n  ideas,—_i.e._, the mental element,—are the end and aim.\r\n\r\n  If the realization of the masochistic ideas (_i.e._, passive\r\n  flagellation, etc.) be the desired end, then it is in opposition with\r\n  the fact that the majority of masochists never attempt realization;\r\n  or, when this is attempted, great disappointment occurs, or at least\r\n  the desired satisfaction is not obtained.\r\n\r\n  Thus the reveling in imagination is the principal thing; and, in fact,\r\n  this gives an unspeakable delight that takes its subject beyond\r\n  external things, beyond all troubles and cares.\r\n\r\n  It is an astonishing fact that there is an author, who, instead of\r\n  keeping them to himself, as others do, discloses his imaginary ideals\r\n  to the world in novels and romances. In “Venus in Furs,” we find those\r\n  that are like us in feeling,—word for word, line for line, are\r\n  expressed the ideas so familiar to us, which we believe to be our own\r\n  exclusive discovery.\r\n\r\n  Until then I did not think it possible that there could be, in any\r\n  other brain than mine, the lustful thought of being harnessed to a\r\n  plow and made to work like a draught-horse.\r\n\r\n  And the ill-temper of the mistress to be served at the toilet and\r\n  bath; the imprisonment,—ah, how familiar such ideas are to us from\r\n  childhood!\r\n\r\n  Therefore, perhaps by reason of this open disclosure of things that\r\n  should be secret, the reading of this book shocks masochists,\r\n  undeceives them, and exerts a curative influence.\r\n\r\n  Finally, I should mention that, according to my experience, the number\r\n  of masochists, especially in large cities, seems to be quite large.\r\n  The only sources of such information are—since men do not reveal these\r\n  things—words of prostitutes; and, since they agree on the essential\r\n  points, it may be concluded that certain facts are proved.\r\n\r\n  Thus there is the fact that every experienced prostitute is accustomed\r\n  to keep some suitable instrument (usually a whip) for flagellation;\r\n  but it must be remembered that there are men who have themselves\r\n  whipped simply to increase their sexual pleasure; who, in contrast\r\n  with masochists, regard flagellation as a means to an end.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, almost all prostitutes agree that there are many\r\n  men who like to play “slave,”—_i.e._, like to be so called, and have\r\n  themselves scolded and trod upon and beaten. As has been said, the\r\n  number of masochists is larger than has yet been dreamed.\r\n\r\n  As you can imagine, reading the “New Investigations”[62] made a great\r\n  impression on me. I should like to have faith in a cure, in a logical\r\n  cure, so to speak, in accordance with the motto: “Tout comprendre\r\n  c’est tout guérir.” (To understand all is to cure all.)\r\n\r\n  Of course the word _cure_ is to be taken with some limitation, and\r\n  there must be a distinction made between general feelings and concrete\r\n  ideas. The former can never be overcome; they come like a stroke of\r\n  lightning, are there, and one does not know whence or how.\r\n\r\n  But this practice of masochism in imagination, by means of concrete,\r\n  associated ideas, can be avoided, or at least restricted.\r\n\r\n  Now the thing is changed. I say to myself: What! you busy your mind\r\n  with things which not only the æsthetic sense of others, but also your\r\n  own, disapproves? You regard that as beautiful and desirable which, in\r\n  your own judgment, is at once ugly, coarse, silly, and impossible? You\r\n  long for a situation which in reality you can never obtain? This\r\n  opposing idea has an immediate inhibitory and undeceiving effect, and\r\n  takes the edge off the fancy. Too, since reading the “New\r\n  Investigations” (early this year), I have actually not reveled in my\r\n  fancy once, though the masochistic tendency has occurred with\r\n  regularity.\r\n\r\n  I must also confess that, in spite of its marked pathological\r\n  character, masochism is not only incapable of destroying my pleasure\r\n  in life, but it does not in the least affect my outward life. When not\r\n  in a masochistic state, as far as feeling and action are concerned, I\r\n  am a perfectly normal man. During the activity of the masochistic\r\n  tendencies there is, of course, a great revolution in my feeling, but\r\n  my outward manner of life suffers no change; I have a calling that\r\n  makes it necessary for me to move much in public, and I pursue it in\r\n  the masochistic condition as well as ever.\r\n\r\nThe author of the foregoing lines also sends me the following notes:—\r\n\r\n  1. Masochism, according to my experience, is, under all circumstances,\r\n  congenital, and never acquired by the individual. I know positively\r\n  that I was never spanked; that my masochistic ideas were manifested\r\n  from my earliest youth; and that, as long as I have been capable of\r\n  thinking, I have had such thoughts. If the origin of them had been the\r\n  result of a particular event, especially of a beating, I should\r\n  certainly not have forgotten it. It is characteristic that the ideas\r\n  were present before there was any libido. At that time the ideas were\r\n  absolutely sexless. I remember that, when a boy, it affected (not to\r\n  say excited) me intensely when an older boy addressed me in the second\r\n  person (_Du_), while I spoke to him in the third (_Sie_). I would keep\r\n  up a conversation with him, and have the exchange of address take\r\n  place as often as possible. Later, when I had become more mature\r\n  sexually, such things affected me only when they occurred with a\r\n  married woman, and one relatively old.\r\n\r\n  2. Physically and mentally I am in all respects masculine. I have a\r\n  superabundant growth of beard, and my whole body is very hairy. In my\r\n  relations to the female sex that are not masochistic, the dominating\r\n  position of the man is an indispensable condition, and any attempt to\r\n  change it would meet with my energetic opposition. I am energetic, if\r\n  not over-courageous; but the want of courage is not manifest when my\r\n  pride is injured. I am not sensitive to events in nature\r\n  (thunder-storms, storms at sea, etc.).[63]\r\n\r\n  Too, my masochistic tendencies have nothing feminine or effeminate\r\n  about them (?). To be sure, in these the inclination to be sought and\r\n  desired by the woman is dominant; but the general relation desired\r\n  with her is not that in which a woman stands to a man, but that of the\r\n  slave to the master, the domestic animal to its owner. If one regards\r\n  the ultimate aim of masochism without prejudice, it must be\r\n  acknowledged that its ideal is the position of a dog or horse. Both\r\n  are owned by masters, and punished by them; and the masters are\r\n  responsible to no one. Just this unlimited power of life and death, as\r\n  exercised over slaves and domestic animals, is the end and aim of all\r\n  masochistic ideas.\r\n\r\n  3. The foundation of all masochistic ideas is libido; and as this ebbs\r\n  and flows, so do the masochistic fancies. On the other hand, as soon\r\n  as the ideas are present, they greatly intensify the libido. I am by\r\n  no means excessively sensual naturally. However, when the masochistic\r\n  ideas occur, I am impelled to coitus at any cost (for the most part I\r\n  am driven to the lowest women); and if these impulses are not soon\r\n  obeyed, libido soon becomes almost satyriasis. One is almost justified\r\n  in looking upon this as a _circulus vitiosus_.\r\n\r\n  Libido occurs either in the course of time, or as the result of\r\n  especial excitement (also of a kind that is not masochistic,—_e.g._,\r\n  kissing). In spite of its manner of origin, this libido, by virtue of\r\n  the masochistic ideas it engenders, is soon transformed into a\r\n  masochistic and impure libido.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, there is no doubt that external, accidental impressions,\r\n  particularly loitering in the streets of a large city, greatly\r\n  intensify the desire. The sight of beautiful and imposing female\r\n  forms, _in nature_ as well as in art, is exciting. For those subject\r\n  to masochism,—at least during the attacks,—the whole external world\r\n  becomes masochistic. The box on the ear administered by the teacher to\r\n  the pupil and the crack of the driver’s whip make deep impressions on\r\n  the masochist, while they leave him indifferent or annoy him when he\r\n  is not in the masochistic state.\r\n\r\n  4. An example of masochistic ideas follows: “She” is a peasant\r\n  woman,—a rough, tall, large-boned woman of forty or fifty years. She\r\n  is the possessor of a small, remote farm, which she works with the\r\n  help of her slave alone. The work begins before sunrise. At four\r\n  o’clock in the morning she opens the shed where she has kept me shut\r\n  up over night, and wakens me, as I lie on the ground, with a kick;\r\n  then she leads me out and harnesses me to a milk-cart bound for town.\r\n  She leads me by a halter, and urges me along. On the road she gets on\r\n  the heavily-loaded wagon, and sleeps until the destination is reached.\r\n  There, in the open market-place of the town, still harnessed to the\r\n  wagon, I lie down on the bare ground to rest. Those passing knock\r\n  against me or step on me, without giving me any attention. After the\r\n  stock is sold, we start homeward. After a short rest the work begins\r\n  again, always under the direction of the mistress, who holds me by the\r\n  halter and urges me on. At seven or eight o’clock at night I am put up\r\n  to rest, and sleep until the next morning, when the same thing begins\r\n  again. Work and blows, blows and work; no pleasure, no recreation, day\r\n  in and day out!\r\n\r\n  Another time I fancy myself in the _rôle_ of a paid lover of an\r\n  elderly female _roué_, who makes use of me, sexually, in the most\r\n  reckless manner; and in this direction makes the most shameful demands\r\n  on me. If I do not submit to these willingly, I am beaten and\r\n  punished; and, at the same time, she despises me unspeakably; gives me\r\n  the lowest housework to do; and on every occasion shows me how low an\r\n  opinion she has of my manhood.\r\n\r\n  I cannot clothe the character of masochism in any better formula than\r\n  the following: A real masochist, without reflection, prefers the kick\r\n  of a low woman to the embrace of a Venus.\r\n\r\n  5. In reading Sacher-Masoch, it struck me that in masochists, now and\r\n  then, there was also an undercurrent of sadistic feeling. Too, I have\r\n  now and then discovered in myself sporadic feelings of sadism. I must\r\n  remark, however, that the sadistic feelings are not so marked as the\r\n  masochistic; and that, aside from the fact that they are infrequently\r\n  accessory, the sadistic fancies never leave the sphere of abstract\r\n  feeling, and, above all, never take the form of concrete, connected\r\n  ideas (like those above mentioned). The effect on libido, however, is\r\n  the same with both.\r\n\r\nIf this case is remarkable on account of the complete development of the\r\npsychical state that constitutes masochism, the following one is\r\nnoteworthy because of the great extravagance of the acts resulting from\r\nthe perversion. The case is also particularly suited to make clear the\r\nreason for the subjection and humiliation at the hands of the woman, and\r\nthe peculiar sexual coloring of the resulting situations:—\r\n\r\n  Case 51. _Masochism._—Mr. Z., official, aged 50; tall, muscular,\r\n  healthy. He is said to come of healthy parentage, but his father was\r\n  thirty years older than his mother. A sister, two years older than Z.,\r\n  suffers with delusions of persecution. There is nothing remarkable in\r\n  Z.’s external appearance. Skeleton entirely masculine; abundant beard,\r\n  but no hair on trunk. He characterizes himself as a man of sanguine\r\n  temperament, whom no one can depress; though irascible and\r\n  quick-tempered, he is quick to regret outbursts.\r\n\r\n  Z. says he has never masturbated. From his youth there have been\r\n  nightly pollutions, in which girls play a part; but the sexual act,\r\n  never. For example, he dreams that a pleasing woman lies heavily on\r\n  him, or that, as he lies sleeping on the grass, she playfully walks up\r\n  his back. Z. had always been averse to coitus with a woman. This act\r\n  seemed animal to him. Nevertheless, he was drawn to women. It was only\r\n  in the society of beautiful women and girls that he felt well and in\r\n  his place. He was very gallant without being forward.\r\n\r\n  A voluptuous woman of beautiful form, and particularly with a pretty\r\n  foot, when seated, had the power to throw him into intense excitement.\r\n  He was impelled to offer himself as a chair, in order “to offer so\r\n  much devotion.” A kick, a box on the ear from her, would be heaven to\r\n  him. He had a horror at the thought of coitus with her. He felt the\r\n  need to serve the woman. He thought how ladies liked to ride. He\r\n  reveled in the thought of how fine it would be to be wearied by the\r\n  burden of a beautiful woman, in order to give her pleasure. He painted\r\n  the situation in all colors; thought of the beautiful foot armed with\r\n  spurs, the beautiful legs, and the soft, full thighs. Every beautiful\r\n  mature woman, every pretty female foot, always excited his\r\n  imagination; but he never betrayed the peculiar feelings that seemed\r\n  to him abnormal, and was able to control himself. But he felt no need\r\n  to fight against them; on the contrary, it would have hurt him had he\r\n  been compelled to give up the feelings that had become so dear to him.\r\n\r\n  At the age of thirty-two Z. happened to make the acquaintance of an\r\n  attractive woman, aged twenty-seven, who had been separated from her\r\n  husband, and whom he found in need. He took her, and worked for her,\r\n  without any selfish motive, for months. One evening she impatiently\r\n  demanded sexual satisfaction from him, and almost used violence.\r\n  Coitus was successful. Z. took the woman, lived with her, and indulged\r\n  in coitus moderately; but coitus was more a burden than a pleasure;\r\n  erections became weak, and he could no longer satisfy the woman. She\r\n  finally declared that she would not have intercourse with him, because\r\n  he only excited without satisfying her. Though he loved the woman very\r\n  much, he could not give up his peculiar fancies. After this he lived\r\n  with her only in friendly relations, and deeply regretted that he\r\n  could not serve her in the way she desired.\r\n\r\n  Fear of how she would receive his propositions, and a feeling of\r\n  shame, kept him from confessing. He found a substitute in his dreams.\r\n  Thus, for example, he dreamed that he was a proud, fiery steed, ridden\r\n  by a beautiful lady. He, felt her weight, the bit he had to obey, the\r\n  pressure of the thighs on his flanks; he heard her beautiful, joyous\r\n  voice. The exertion threw him into a perspiration; the touch of the\r\n  spurs did the rest, and always induced pollution with great lustful\r\n  pleasure. At other times be dreamed that he was a small, weak horse.\r\n  Then a large, heavy woman came and mounted the horse, and set off on a\r\n  long journey in the mountains. Recklessly, and without mercy, she\r\n  allowed the poor animal to feel her weight; she made herself\r\n  comfortable on his back; while he threatened to give out under her,\r\n  she had the greatest enjoyment, and with calm mind enjoyed the\r\n  beautiful scenery. Under the influence of such dreams, seven years ago\r\n  Z. overcame his reluctance, in order to experience such things in\r\n  reality. He was successful in creating suitable opportunity. He speaks\r\n  of it as follows: “I knew how to arrange it so that on an occasion she\r\n  would, of her own will, seat herself on my back. Then I endeavored to\r\n  make this situation as pleasant as possible, and easily made it so\r\n  that on the next occasion she said, spontaneously: ‘Come, give me a\r\n  little ride!’ Swelling with pride, and with both hands braced on a\r\n  chair, I made my back horizontal, and she mounted astride, after the\r\n  manner of a man. I then did the best I could to imitate the movements\r\n  of a horse, and loved to have her treat me like a horse, without any\r\n  thought of _me_. She could beat, prick, scold, or caress me, just as\r\n  she felt inclined. I could carry on my back persons weighing from\r\n  sixty to eighty kilos, for half or three-quarters of an hour, without\r\n  interruption. At the end of this time I usually asked for a rest.\r\n  During this the intercourse between the mistress and me was perfectly\r\n  harmless and without any relation to what had preceded. After about a\r\n  quarter of an hour I was always rested, and placed myself at the\r\n  disposal of the mistress again. When time and circumstances allowed\r\n  it, I did this three or four times in succession. It sometimes\r\n  happened that I practiced it both in the morning and afternoon. After\r\n  it I never felt weary or had any uncomfortable feeling; but on such\r\n  days I had very little appetite. When possible, I liked best to bare\r\n  my trunk, that I might feel the rider more perfectly. The mistress had\r\n  to be decent. I liked her best in pretty shoes and stockings, with\r\n  short, closed drawers, reaching to the knee; with the upper portion of\r\n  her person completely dressed, and with hat and gloves.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Z. further says that he has not performed coitus in seven years;\r\n  but he thinks he is potent. The riding was a perfect substitute for\r\n  that “animal act,” even when ejaculation was not induced.\r\n\r\n  For eight months Z. had determined to give up his masochistic play,\r\n  and had kept his determination. But he thought that if a woman only\r\n  half-way pretty were to address him directly, and say, “Come, I want\r\n  to ride you,” he would not be strong enough to withstand the\r\n  temptation. Z. wishes to know whether his abnormality is curable;\r\n  whether he is unworthy as a vicious man, or an invalid deserving pity.\r\n\r\nThe following case seems very similar:—\r\n\r\n  Case 52. A man finds satisfaction in the following manner:\r\n  Occasionally he goes to a puella publica. Here he has a porcelain\r\n  ring, like those used in hanging curtains, put on his penis. Two cords\r\n  are attached to the ring and drawn backward between his legs and\r\n  attached to the bedstead. Then he tells the woman to beat him\r\n  mercilessly with a whip and cry “whoa” to him constantly, and treat\r\n  and abuse him as if he were an unruly horse. The more the woman spurs\r\n  him on to pull, with shouts and blows, the greater his sexual\r\n  excitement becomes. Erection occurs (probably mechanically favored by\r\n  compression of the dorsal vein of the penis, which, when the cords are\r\n  strained, must be closed by the pressure of the hard ring). With\r\n  increasing erection, the whole member is compressed by the ring, and\r\n  finally ejaculation occurs, with lustful feeling.\r\n\r\nEven in the foregoing series of cases, with other things, the act of\r\nbeing walked upon has played a _rôle_ as a means of expressing the\r\nmasochistic situations of humiliation and pain. The exclusive and most\r\nextensive use of this means for perverse excitation and satisfaction is\r\nshown in the following classical case of masochism, which Hammond\r\nreports (_op. cit._, p. 28) from an observation by Dr. Cox,[64] of\r\nColorado:—\r\n\r\n  Case 53. X., a model husband, very moral, the father of several\r\n  children, has times—_i.e._, attacks—in which he visits brothels,\r\n  chooses two or three of the largest girls, and shuts himself up with\r\n  them. He bares the upper portion of his body, lies down on the floor,\r\n  crosses his hands on his abdomen, closes his eyes, and then has the\r\n  girls walk over his naked breast, neck, and face, urging them at every\r\n  step to press hard on his flesh with the heels of their shoes.\r\n  Sometimes he wants a heavier girl, or some other act still more cruel\r\n  than this procedure. After two or three hours he has enough. He pays\r\n  the girls with wine and money, rubs his blue bruises, dresses himself,\r\n  pays his bill, and goes back to his business, only to give himself the\r\n  same strange pleasure again after a few weeks.\r\n\r\n  Occasionally it happens that he has one of the girls stand on his\r\n  breast; and the others then turn her around until his skin is torn and\r\n  bleeding from the turning of the heels of her shoes. Frequently one of\r\n  the girls has to stand on him in such a way that one shoe is over the\r\n  eyes, with its heel pressing on one eye, while the other rests across\r\n  his neck. In this position he endures the pressure of a person\r\n  weighing about one hundred and fifty pounds for four or five minutes.\r\n  _The author speaks of dozens of similar cases that are known to him._\r\n  Hammond presumes, with reason, that this man had become impotent for\r\n  intercourse with women; that, in this strange procedure, he found an\r\n  equivalent for coitus; and that, when the heels drew blood, he had\r\n  pleasant sexual feelings, accompanied by ejaculation.\r\n\r\nThe ten cases of masochism thus far described, and the numerous\r\nanalogous cases mentioned by those who report them, form a counterpart\r\nto the previously described group “_c_” of sadism. Just as in sadism men\r\nexcite and satisfy themselves by maltreating women, so in masochism the\r\nsame effect is sought in the passive reception of similar abuse. But\r\ngroup “_a_” of the sadists,—that of lust-murder,—strange as it may seem,\r\nis not without its counterpart in masochism. In its extreme\r\nconsequences, masochism must lead to the desire to be killed by a person\r\nof the opposite sex, in the same way that sadism has its acme in active\r\nlust-murder. But the instinct of self-preservation opposes such a\r\nresult; so that the extreme is not actually carried out. When, however,\r\nthe whole structure of masochistic ideas is purely psychical, in the\r\nimagination of such individuals, even the extreme may be reached; as the\r\nfollowing case shows:—\r\n\r\n  Case 54. A middle-aged man, married and the father of a family, who\r\n  has always led a normal vita sexualis, but who says he comes of a very\r\n  nervous family, makes the following communication: In his early youth\r\n  he was powerfully excited sexually at the sight of a woman\r\n  slaughtering an animal with a knife. From that time, for many years,\r\n  he had reveled in the lustfully-colored idea of being stabbed and cut\r\n  and even killed by women with knives. Later, after the beginning of\r\n  normal sexual intercourse, these ideas lost completely their perverse\r\n  stimulus for him.\r\n\r\nThis case should be compared with the statements made under Case 44,\r\naccording to which men find sexual pleasure in being lightly pricked\r\nwith knives in the hands of women, who, at the same time, threaten them\r\nwith death.\r\n\r\nSuch fancies, perhaps, give the key to an understanding of the following\r\nstrange case, for which I am indebted to a communication from Dr.\r\nKörber, of Rankau:—\r\n\r\n  Case 55. A lady makes me the following communication: While still a\r\n  young and innocent girl, she was married to a man of about thirty\r\n  years. On their wedding-night he forced a towel and soap into her\r\n  hands, and, without any other expression of love, wanted her to lather\r\n  his chin and neck (as if for shaving). The inexperienced young wife\r\n  did it, and was not a little astonished, during the first weeks of\r\n  married life, to learn its secrets in absolutely no other form. Her\r\n  husband always told her that it gave him the greatest delight to have\r\n  his face lathered by her. Later, after she had sought the advice of\r\n  friends, she induced her husband to perform coitus, and had three\r\n  children in the course of time (by him, she states with every\r\n  assurance). The husband is industrious and reliable, but a moody man,\r\n  with little perseverance; by occupation a merchant.\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred that this man conceived the act of being shaved\r\n(_i.e._, the lathering as a preparatory measure) as a rudimentary,\r\nsymbolic realization of ideas of injury or death, or of fancies about\r\nknives; like those the man previously mentioned had had in his youth,\r\nand by means of which he had been sexually excited and satisfied. The\r\nperfect sadistic counterpart to this case, looked upon in this light, is\r\noffered by Case 35, which is a case of symbolic sadism.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there is a whole group of masochists who satisfy themselves\r\nwith the symbolic representations of situations corresponding with their\r\nperversion; a group that corresponds with group “_e_” of “symbolic”\r\nsadists, just as the previously mentioned cases of masochism correspond\r\nwith the groups “_c_” and “_a_” of sadism. Thus, just as the perverse\r\nlongings of the masochist may, on the one hand, advance to “passive\r\nlust-murder” (to be sure, only in imagination); so, on the other hand,\r\nthey may be satisfied with simple symbolic representations of the\r\ndesired situations, which otherwise are expressed in acts of cruelty\r\n(this, of course, taken objectively, goes much further than the idea of\r\nbeing murdered, but in fact not so far, owing to the determining\r\nsubjective conditions).\r\n\r\nWith Case 55, other similar cases should be here described, in which the\r\nacts desired and planned by the masochist have a purely symbolic\r\ncharacter, and, to a certain extent, serve to indicate the desired\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n  Case 56. (Pascal, “Igiene dell’ amore.”) Every three months a man of\r\n  about forty-five years would visit a certain prostitute, and pay her\r\n  ten francs for the following act. The puella had to undress him, tie\r\n  his hands and feet, bandage his eyes, and draw the curtains of the\r\n  windows. Then she would have her guest sit down on a sofa, and had to\r\n  leave him there alone. After half an hour she had to come back and\r\n  unbind him. Then the man would pay her and leave perfectly satisfied,\r\n  to repeat his visit in about three months.\r\n\r\nIn the dark this man seems to have extended this situation, of being\r\nhelpless in the hands of a woman, further in imagination. The following\r\ncase, in which again a complicated comedy, in the sense of masochistic\r\ndesires, is played, is still more peculiar:—\r\n\r\n  Case 57. (Dr. Pascal, _ibid._) A gentleman in Paris was accustomed to\r\n  call on certain evenings at a house where a woman, the owner, acceded\r\n  to his peculiar desire. He entered the _salon_ in full-dress, and she,\r\n  likewise in evening _toilette_, had to receive him with a very haughty\r\n  manner. He addressed her as “Marquise,” and she had to call him “dear\r\n  Count.” Then he spoke of his good fortune in finding her alone, of his\r\n  love for her, and of a lover’s rendezvous. At this the lady had to\r\n  feel insulted. The pseudo-count grew bolder and bolder, and asked the\r\n  pseudo-marquise for a kiss on her shoulder. There is an angry scene;\r\n  the bell is rung; a servant, prepared for the occasion, appears, and\r\n  throws the count out of the house. He departs well satisfied, and pays\r\n  the actors in the farce handsomely.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this case of symbolic masochism, two more are here\r\ngiven, in which the psychical perversion was entirely confined to the\r\nsphere of thought and imagination, and no realization was attempted. The\r\nfirst is that of an individual, mentally and physically predisposed,\r\nbearing degenerative signs, in whom mental and physical impotence\r\noccurred early:—\r\n\r\n  Case 58. Mr. Z., aged 22, single, was brought to me by his father for\r\n  medical advice, because he was very nervous and apparently abnormal\r\n  sexually. Mother and maternal grandmother were insane. His father\r\n  begat him at a time when he was suffering severely nervously.\r\n\r\n  Patient is said to have been a very lively and talented child. At the\r\n  age of seven he was noticed to practice masturbation. After his ninth\r\n  year he became inattentive, forgetful, and did not progress in his\r\n  studies, constantly requiring help and protection. With difficulty he\r\n  got through the Gymnasium, and during his time of freedom had\r\n  attracted attention by his indolence, absent-mindedness, and various\r\n  foolish acts.\r\n\r\n  Consultation was occasioned by an occurrence on the street, in which\r\n  Z. had forced himself on a young girl in a very impetuous manner, and\r\n  in great excitement had tried to have a conversation with her.\r\n\r\n  The patient gave as a reason, that, by conversing with a respectable\r\n  girl, he wished to excite himself so that he could be potent in coitus\r\n  with a prostitute!\r\n\r\n  His father characterizes him as a man of perfectly good disposition,\r\n  moral, but lazy, and dissatisfied with himself; as one often in\r\n  despair about his want of success in life; as indolent, and interested\r\n  in nothing but music, for which he possesses great talent.\r\n\r\n  The patient’s exterior—his plagiocephalic head; his large, prominent\r\n  ears; the deficient innervation of the right facialis about the mouth;\r\n  the neuropathic expression of the eyes—indicates a degenerate,\r\n  neuropathic individual.\r\n\r\n  Z. is tall, of powerful frame, and, in all respects, of masculine\r\n  appearance. Pelvis masculine; testicles well developed; penis\r\n  remarkably large; mons veneris with abundant hair. The right testicle\r\n  hangs much lower than the left; the cremasteric reflex is weak on both\r\n  sides. The patient is below the average intellectually. He feels his\r\n  deficiency, complains of his indolence, and asks to have his will\r\n  strengthened. His awkward, embarrassed manner, timid glances, and\r\n  relaxed attitude, point to masturbation. The patient confesses that\r\n  from his seventh year, until a year and a half ago, he practiced it,\r\n  years at a time, from eight to ten times daily. Until a few years ago,\r\n  when he became neurasthenic (cephalic pressure, loss of mental power,\r\n  spinal irritation, etc.), he says he always found great sensual\r\n  pleasure in it. Since then this had been lost, and the desire to\r\n  masturbate had disappeared. He had constantly grown more bashful and\r\n  indolent, less energetic, and more cowardly and apprehensive. He had\r\n  lost interest in everything, and did his business only from a sense of\r\n  duty, feeling very low-spirited. He had never thought of coitus, and,\r\n  from his stand-point as an onanist, he could not understand how others\r\n  could find pleasure in it.\r\n\r\n  Investigations in the direction of contrary sexual instinct gave a\r\n  negative result. He says he never was drawn toward persons of his own\r\n  sex; he rather thinks that he has now and then had a weak inclination\r\n  for females. He asserts that he came to masturbate independently. In\r\n  his thirteenth year he first noticed ejaculations as a result of\r\n  masturbatic manipulations.\r\n\r\n  It was only after long persuasion that Z. consented to entirely unveil\r\n  his vita sexualis. As his statements, which follow, show, he may be\r\n  classified as a case of ideal masochism, with rudimentary sadism. The\r\n  patient distinctly remembers that, at the age of six, without any\r\n  cause, he had “ideas of violence.” He was compelled to imagine that a\r\n  servant-girl spread his legs apart and showed his genitals to another;\r\n  that she tried to throw him into cold or hot water, in order to cause\r\n  him pain. These “ideas of violence” were attended with lustful\r\n  feeling, and became the cause of masturbatic manipulations. Later the\r\n  patient called them up voluntarily, in order to incite himself to\r\n  masturbation. They also played a part in his dreams; but they never\r\n  induced pollution, apparently because the patient masturbated\r\n  excessively during the day.\r\n\r\n  In time, to these masochistic “ideas of violence,” others of a\r\n  sadistic nature were added. At first they were scenes in which boys\r\n  forcibly practiced onanism on one another, or cut off the genitals. He\r\n  often imagined himself such a boy, now in an active, now in a passive,\r\n  _rôle_. Later he busied himself with mental pictures of girls and\r\n  women that exhibited themselves to one another. He reveled in the\r\n  thought, for example, of a servant-girl spreading another girl’s legs\r\n  apart and pulling the genital hair; or in the thought of boys treating\r\n  girls cruelly, and pricking and pinching their genitals.\r\n\r\n  Such ideas also always induced sexual excitement, but he never\r\n  experienced any impulse to carry them out actively or to have them\r\n  performed on himself passive. It satisfied him to use them for\r\n  masturbation. Since a year and a half ago, with diminishing sexual\r\n  imagination and libido, these ideas and impulses had become\r\n  infrequent, but their content remained unchanged. The masochistic\r\n  “ideas of violence” predominated over the sadistic. Now, when he sees\r\n  a lady, he has the thought that she has sexual ideas like his own. In\r\n  this way, in part, he explains his embarrassment in social\r\n  intercourse. Owing to the fact that he had heard that he would get rid\r\n  of his burdensome sexual ideas, if he were to accustom himself to\r\n  natural sexual indulgence, during the last year and a half he has\r\n  twice attempted coitus though he only experienced repugnance, and was\r\n  not confident of success. On both occasions the attempt was a fiasco.\r\n  The second time he made the attempt, he felt such aversion that he\r\n  pushed the girl away and fled.\r\n\r\nThe second case is the following one, placed at my disposal by a\r\ncolleague. Even though it be aphoristic, it seems particularly suited to\r\nthrow a clear light on the distinctive element of masochism,—the\r\nconsciousness of subjection, in its peculiar psycho-sexual effect:—\r\n\r\n  Case 59. _Masochism._—Z., aged 27, artist. He is powerfully built, of\r\n  pleasing appearance, and is said to be free from hereditary taint.\r\n  Healthy in youth, since his twenty-third year he has been nervous and\r\n  inclined to be hypochondriacal. Though inclined to indulgence\r\n  sexually, he is not very virile. In spite of associations with\r\n  females, his relations with them are limited to innocent attentions.\r\n  At the same time, his desire to devote himself to women that are cold\r\n  toward him is remarkable. Since his twenty-fifth year he has noticed\r\n  that females, no matter how ugly, always excite him sexually, whenever\r\n  he discovers anything domineering in their character. An angry word\r\n  from the lips of such a woman is sufficient to give him the most\r\n  violent erections. Thus, one day, he sat in a _café_ and heard the\r\n  (ugly) female cashier scold the waiters in a loud voice. This threw\r\n  him into the most intense sexual excitement, which soon induced\r\n  ejaculation. Z. requires the women, with whom he is to have sexual\r\n  intercourse, to repulse and annoy him in various ways. He thinks that\r\n  only a woman like the heroines of Sacher-Masoch’s romances could charm\r\n  him.\r\n\r\nCases like this, in which the whole perversion of the vita sexualis is\r\nconfined to the sphere of imagination,—to the inner world of thought and\r\ninstinct,—and only accidentally comes to the knowledge of others, do not\r\nseem to be infrequent. Their _practical_ significance, like that of\r\nmasochism in general (which has not the great forensic importance of\r\nsadism), is confined to the psychical impotence to which such\r\nindividuals, as a rule, become subject; and to the intense impulse to\r\nsolitary indulgence, with adequate imaginary ideas, and its results.\r\n\r\nThat masochism is a perversion of uncommonly frequent occurrence is\r\nsufficiently shown by the relatively large number of cases that have\r\nthus far been studied scientifically, as well as by the agreement of the\r\nvarious statements reported.\r\n\r\nThe works concerning prostitution in large cities also contain numerous\r\nstatements concerning this matter.\r\n\r\nLéo Taxil (_op. cit._, p. 228) describes masochistic scenes in Parisian\r\nbrothels. The man affected with this perversion is there also called\r\n“slave.”\r\n\r\nCoffignon (“La corruption à Paris”) has a chapter in his book entitled\r\n“Les Passionels,” which contains contributions to this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting and worthy of mention, that one of the most celebrated\r\nof men was subject to this perversion, and describes it in his\r\nautobiography (though somewhat erroneously). From “Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau’s Confessions” it is evident that he was affected with\r\nmasochism.\r\n\r\n  Rousseau, with reference to whose life and malady Möbius (“J. J.\r\n  Rousseau’s Krankengeschichte,” Leipzig, 1889) and Chatelain (“La folie\r\n  de J. J. Rousseau,” Neuchatel, 1890) may be consulted, tells, in his\r\n  “Confessions” (part i, book i), how Miss Lambercier, aged thirty,\r\n  greatly impressed him when he was eight years old and lived with her\r\n  brother as his pupil. Her solicitude, when he could not immediately\r\n  answer a question, and her threats to punish him if he did not learn\r\n  well, made the deepest impression on him. When, one day, he had blows\r\n  at her hands, with the feeling of pain and shame, he also experienced\r\n  sensual pleasure that incited a great desire to be whipped by her\r\n  again. It was only for fear of disturbing the lady, that Rousseau\r\n  failed to make other opportunities to experience this lustful, sensual\r\n  feeling. One day, however, he unintentionally gave cause for a\r\n  whipping at Miss Lambercier’s hands. This was the last; for Miss\r\n  Lambercier must have noticed something of the peculiar effect of the\r\n  punishment; and from this time on she did not allow the eight-year-old\r\n  boy to sleep in her room. From this time Rousseau felt a desire to\r\n  have himself punished by ladies pleasing to him, a la Lambercier; but\r\n  he asserts that until his youth he knew nothing of the relation of the\r\n  sexes to each other. As is known, Rousseau was first introduced to the\r\n  real mysteries of love in his thirtieth year, and lost his innocence\r\n  through Madame de Warrens. Until that time he had had only feelings\r\n  and impulses attracting him to woman, in the nature of passive\r\n  flagellation and other masochistic ideas.\r\n\r\nRousseau describes, _in extenso_, how he suffered, with his great sexual\r\ndesires, by reason of his peculiar sensuality, which had undoubtedly\r\nbeen awakened by his whippings; for he reveled in desire, and could not\r\ndisclose his longings. It would be erroneous, however, to suppose that\r\nRousseau was concerned merely with flagellation. Flagellation only\r\nawakened ideas of a masochistic nature. At least, in these ideas lies\r\nthe psychological nucleus of his interesting study of self. The\r\nessential element with Rousseau was the feeling of subjection to the\r\nwoman. This is clearly shown by the “Confessions,” in which he expressly\r\nemphasizes that “_Etre aux genoux d’une maitresse impérieuse, obéir à\r\nses ordres, avoir des pardons à lui demander,—etaient pour moi de très\r\ndouces jouissances._”[65]\r\n\r\nThis passage proves that the consciousness of subjection and humiliation\r\nbefore the woman was the most important element.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, Rousseau was himself in error in supposing that this impulse\r\nto be humiliated before a woman had arisen by association of ideas from\r\nthe idea of flagellation:—\r\n\r\n“N’osant jamais déclarer mon goût, je l’amusais du moins par des\r\nrapports qui m’en conservaient l’idée.”[66]\r\n\r\nIt is only in connection with the numerous cases of masochism, the\r\nexistence of which has now been established, and among which there are\r\nso many that are in nowise connected with flagellation, showing the\r\nprimary and pure psychical character of this instinct of subjection,—it\r\nis only in connection with these cases that a complete insight into\r\nRousseau’s case is obtained, and the error detected into which he\r\nnecessarily fell in the analysis of his own condition.\r\n\r\nBinet (_Revue Anthropologique_, xxiv, p. 256), who analyzes Rousseau’s\r\ncase in detail, also justly calls attention to its masochistic\r\nsignificance, when he says: “Ce qu’aime Rousseau dans les femmes, ce\r\nn’est pas seulement le sourcil froncé, la main levée, le regard sévère,\r\nl’attitude impérieuse, c’est aussi l’état émotionnel, dont ces faits\r\nsont la traduction extérieure; il aime la femme fière, dédaigneuse,\r\nl’écrasant à ses pieds du poids de sa royale colère.”[67]\r\n\r\nThe solution of this enigmatical psychological fact Binet finds in his\r\nassumption that it is an instance of fetichism, only with the difference\r\nthat the object of the fetichism—i.e., the object of individual\r\nattraction (fetich)—is not a portion of the body, like a hand or foot,\r\nbut a mental peculiarity. This enthusiasm he calls “_amour\r\nspiritualiste_,” in contrast with “_amour plastique_,” as manifested in\r\nordinary fetichism.\r\n\r\nThis deduction is acute, but it gives only a word with which to\r\ndesignate a fact, not a solution of it. Whether an explanation is\r\npossible will later occupy our attention.\r\n\r\nThere were also elements of masochism (and sadism) in the celebrated, or\r\nnotorious, French writer, C. P. Baudelaire, who died insane.\r\n\r\n  Baudelaire came of an insane and eccentric family. From his youth he\r\n  was mentally abnormal. His vita sexualis was decidedly abnormal. He\r\n  had love-affairs with ugly, repulsive women,—negresses, dwarfs,\r\n  giantesses. About a very beautiful woman, he expressed the wish to see\r\n  her hung up by her hands, and to kiss her feet. This enthusiasm for\r\n  the naked foot also appears in one of his glowing poems as the\r\n  equivalent of sexual indulgence. He said women were animals who had to\r\n  be shut up, beaten, and fed well. The man displaying these masochistic\r\n  and sadistic inclinations died of paretic dementia. (Lombroso, “The\r\n  Man of Genius.”)\r\n\r\nIn scientific literature, the conditions that constitute masochism have\r\nnot received attention until recently. All there is to mention is that\r\nTarnowsky (“die Krankhaften Erscheinungen des Geschlechtssinns,” Berlin,\r\n1886) relates that he has known happily married, intellectual men, who\r\nfrom time to time felt an irresistible impulse to subject themselves to\r\nthe coarsest, cynical treatment,—to scoldings or blows from passive or\r\nactive pederasts, or prostitutes. It is worthy of remark that, in\r\nTarnowsky’s observation, in certain cases blows, even when they draw\r\nblood, do not bring the result desired (virility, or at least\r\nejaculation during flagellation) by those given to passive flagellation.\r\n“The individual must then be undressed by force, his hands tied,\r\nfastened to a bench, etc., during which he fancies that he makes\r\nopposition, scolds, and pretends to resist. Only under such\r\ncircumstances do the blows induce excitement that leads to ejaculation.”\r\n\r\nO. Zimmermann’s work, “Die Wonne des Leids,” Leipzig, 1885, also\r\ncontributes much to this subject,[68] taken from the history and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nOf late the subject has been given much attention.\r\n\r\nA. Moll, in his work, “Die Conträre Sexualempfindung,” pp. 133 and 141\r\n_et seq._, Berlin, 1891, gives a number of cases of complete masochism\r\nin individuals of contrary sexuality, and among them the case of a man\r\nsuffering with contrary sexual instinct, who sent written instructions,\r\ncontaining twenty paragraphs, to a man engaged for his purpose, who was\r\nto treat and abuse him like a slave.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1891, Mr. Dimitri von Stefanowsky, Deputy Government Attorney\r\nin Jaroslaw, Russia, informed me that, about three years before, he had\r\ngiven his attention to the perversion of the vita sexualis, designated\r\n“masochism” by me, and called “passivism” by him; that a year and a half\r\npreviously he had prepared a paper on the subject for Professor von\r\nKowalewsky for the Russian _Archives of Psychiatry_; and that in\r\nNovember, 1888, he had read a paper on this subject, considered in its\r\nlegal and psychological aspects, before the Legal Society of Moscow\r\n(printed in the _Juridischen Boten_, the organ of the society, in\r\nnumbers 6 to 8).\r\n\r\nIn later fiction the psycho-sexual perversion which forms the subject of\r\nthis study has been treated by Sacher-Masoch, whose writings, already\r\nfrequently alluded to, afford typical pictures of the perverse mental\r\nlife of men of this kind. Many affected with this perversion refer\r\ndirectly to the writings of Sacher-Masoch, as is seen from the foregoing\r\ncases, as typical descriptions of their own psychical condition.\r\n\r\nIn “Nana,” Zola has a masochistic scene, and likewise in “Eugène\r\nRougon.” The latest “decadent” literature of France and Germany is also\r\nlargely concerned with the themes of sadism and masochism. According to\r\nvon Stefanowsky’s statement, the modern Russian novel frequently treats\r\nthe subject; but the statements of the writer of travels, Johann Georg\r\nForster (1754–1794), show that this subject also played a _rôle_ in\r\nRussian folk-songs.\r\n\r\n(b) _Foot-and Shoe-Fetichists—Larvated Masochism._—Following the\r\nabove-mentioned group of “symbolic” masochists, who do not exactly\r\ndesire abuse by women as the means of expression of subjection, but all\r\nkinds of silly acts that can be understood only through an acquaintance\r\nwith the masochistic circle of ideas, comes the very numerous class of\r\nfoot- and shoe-fetichists.\r\n\r\nBy fetichists (_v. infra_, 3) I understand individuals whose sexual\r\ninterest is confined exclusively to parts of the female body, or to\r\ncertain portions of female attire. One of the most frequent forms of\r\nthis fetichism is that in which the female foot or shoe is the fetich,\r\nand becomes the exclusive object of sexual feeling and desire. It is\r\nhighly probable, and shown by a correct classification of the observed\r\ncases, that the majority—and perhaps all—of the cases of shoe-fetichism\r\nrest upon a basis of more or less conscious masochistic desire for\r\nself-humiliation.\r\n\r\nIn Hammond’s case (Case 53) the satisfaction of a masochist was found in\r\nbeing trod upon. In Cases 44 and 48, they also had themselves trod upon;\r\nin Case 51, _equus eroticus_, the person loved a woman’s foot, etc. In\r\nthe majority of cases of masochism, the act of being trod upon with feet\r\nplays a part[69] as an easily accessible means of expressing the\r\nrelation of subjection.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous established cases of shoe-fetichism, the following one,\r\nreported by Dr. A. Moll, of Berlin, which corresponds in many respects\r\nwith Hammond’s case, but which is described in more detail and more\r\ncarefully observed, seems especially suited to show the connection\r\nbetween masochism and shoe-fetichism:—\r\n\r\n  Case 60. O. L., aged 31, book-keeper in a city of Wurtemburg; comes of\r\n  a tainted family.\r\n\r\n  The patient is a large, powerful man, of ruddy appearance. In general\r\n  he is of a quiet temperament, but may become very violent on occasion;\r\n  he says himself that he is quarrelsome and inclined to assert himself.\r\n  L. is of a kindly disposition and generous; easily made to weep. At\r\n  school he passed for a talented pupil, with good powers of\r\n  comprehension. The patient at times has congestion of the head, but is\r\n  otherwise healthy, except that he is much depressed and melancholic as\r\n  a result of his sexual perversion, here to be described.\r\n\r\n  But little can be learned of any hereditary taint.\r\n\r\n  The following facts concerning the development of his sexual life are\r\n  gathered from the patient’s own statements:—\r\n\r\n  In very early youth—in fact, when he was eight or nine years old—L.\r\n  had the desire to lick his teacher’s boots like a dog. L. thinks it\r\n  possible that this thought was excited in him by his once seeing a dog\r\n  actually do this, but he cannot state this with certainty; and it\r\n  seems much more certain to the patient that the first ideas of this\r\n  kind came in a waking state, not in dreams.\r\n\r\n  From his tenth to his fourteenth year he constantly sought to touch\r\n  the shoes of his fellow-pupils, and also those of little girls; but\r\n  for this purpose he always chose boys who had wealthy and prominent\r\n  parents. One of these, the son of a rich landed proprietor, had\r\n  riding-boots; in the boy’s absence L. took these in his hands, struck\r\n  himself with them, and pressed them against his face. L. did the same\r\n  thing with the elegant boots of an officer of dragoons.\r\n\r\n  After the beginning of puberty the desire was transferred exclusively\r\n  to the boots of females. Thus, while skating, the patient’s attention\r\n  was entirely occupied with putting on and taking off skates for\r\n  ladies; but he always chose only such women as were rich and prominent\r\n  socially, wearing elegant boots. In the street and everywhere L.\r\n  constantly looked for elegant boots. His love for them went so far\r\n  that he often put in his purse, and even in his mouth, the sand and\r\n  mud that bore their imprints. As a boy of fourteen L. visited\r\n  brothels; and he often visited a _café chantant_ solely to excite\r\n  himself with the sight of elegant boots (low shoes were less\r\n  attractive). In his school-books and on the walls of closets, L. drew\r\n  boots. In the theatre he saw nothing but the shoes of the ladies. For\r\n  hours at a time, in the street and on board steam-boats, L. would run\r\n  after ladies wearing elegant boots; and he thought with delight of how\r\n  he might get a chance to touch the boots. This peculiar love for boots\r\n  remains unchanged. _The thought to have himself trod upon by ladies in\r\n  their boots, or to kiss the boots, gives L. the most intense sensual\r\n  delight._ Before shoe-stores he will stand and stand, merely to look\r\n  at the boots. He is particularly excited by their elegance.\r\n\r\n  The patient prefers high-buttoned or laced boots with high heels; but\r\n  less elegant boots, even with low heels, also excite him, if their\r\n  wearer is a wealthy, distinguished, and proud lady.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twenty L. attempted coitus; but, “in spite of the\r\n  greatest efforts,” as he believes, he was not successful. During the\r\n  attempt the patient had no thought of shoes; on the contrary, he had\r\n  first sought to excite himself sexually with shoes, and he asserts\r\n  that too great excitement was to blame for his want of success in\r\n  coitus. Up to this time, being thirty-one years old, he has attempted\r\n  coitus only four or five times, and always in vain.\r\n\r\n  On one occasion the patient, already much to be pitied on account of\r\n  his disease, had the misfortune to contract syphilis. In reply to the\r\n  question as to what he regarded as the most lustful act, the patient\r\n  said: “_It is my greatest delight to lie naked on the floor and have\r\n  myself trod upon by girls wearing elegant boots_; but, of course, this\r\n  is possible only in brothels.” Moreover, according to the patient’s\r\n  statements, these sexual perversions of men are well known in many\r\n  houses of prostitution,—a proof that these are not so very infrequent.\r\n  The prostitutes call these men “boot-lovers.” But the patient has only\r\n  very infrequently had the lustful act actually performed,\r\n  notwithstanding the fact that it is most beautiful and pleasant to\r\n  him. The patient has no thoughts that impel to intercourse; at least,\r\n  not in the sense of immissio penis in vagina,—an act that affords him\r\n  no pleasure whatever. Indeed, he has gradually developed a fear of\r\n  coitus, which may be sufficiently explained by his numerous\r\n  unsuccessful attempts; for the patient says himself that his inability\r\n  to complete coitus embarrassed him exceedingly. The patient has never\r\n  practiced real onanism. With the exception of a few occasions on which\r\n  the patient satisfied his sexual desire by onanism with boots or in a\r\n  similar way, he is innocent of such satisfaction; for, in the\r\n  excitement with boots, there is scarcely ever anything more than\r\n  erection; at most, only a slight discharge of fluid takes place\r\n  slowly, which the patient takes to be semen.\r\n\r\n  Simply a shoe, worn by no one, excites him when he sees it, but not\r\n  nearly as intensely as when it is worn by a woman. New shoes that have\r\n  not been worn excite him much less than those that have been used; but\r\n  they must be free from wear and look as new as possible. Shoes of this\r\n  kind excite him the most. As has been said, ladies’ boots excite him\r\n  when they are not on the feet. Under such circumstances, in fancy, L.\r\n  creates a lady for them; he presses them to his lips and on his penis.\r\n  He would “die with delight” if a proud, respectable lady were to tread\r\n  upon him with her shoes.\r\n\r\n  Aside from the previously mentioned characteristics of the women\r\n  (pride, wealth, social prominence), which, in connection with the\r\n  elegance of the boots, constitute an especial stimulus, the patient is\r\n  by no means indifferent to the physical charms of the female sex. He\r\n  is enthusiastic about beautiful women without thinking of boots, but\r\n  this love is not directed to sexual satisfaction. The bodily charms\r\n  play a part even in connection with the boots; a homely old woman,\r\n  even wearing the most elegant boots, cannot affect the patient. The\r\n  rest of the attire and other circumstances also play an essential\r\n  _rôle_, as is shown by the fact that elegant boots worn by proud,\r\n  distinguished women especially excite the patient. A common\r\n  servant-girl, in her working-dress, even in the most elegant shoes,\r\n  would not excite him. Men’s shoes and boots no longer affect the\r\n  patient; and he never in the slightest degree feels himself attracted\r\n  to men sexually.\r\n\r\n  Yet the patient has erections very easily. When he takes a child in\r\n  his lap, when he pats a dog or horse for some time, when he travels on\r\n  the cars, or when he rides,—erections occur. In the latter case he\r\n  thinks it is due to the shaking. He has erections every morning; and\r\n  he can induce erection in a very short time by thinking of the act\r\n  with boots that is so pleasing to him. Pollutions formerly occurred\r\n  frequently at night—about every three or four weeks; now they are more\r\n  infrequent, occurring once about every three months.\r\n\r\n  In his erotic dreams the patient is almost always sexually excited by\r\n  the same thoughts that excite him in the waking state. For some time\r\n  he thinks he has felt ejaculation during erection; but he draws this\r\n  conclusion only from feeling a little moisture at the end of the\r\n  penis. Books touching the sphere of the patient’s sexual ideas\r\n  especially excite him. Thus, in reading “Venus in Furs,”[70] by\r\n  Sacher-Masoch, he is so excited “that the semen just _runs_ away from\r\n  him.” Moreover, with L., this kind of ejaculation, while reading, is a\r\n  decided satisfaction of his sexual desire. My question, whether blows\r\n  received from a woman’s hand would also excite him, the patient thinks\r\n  he would have to answer in the affirmative. The patient has never made\r\n  any such trial, but playful taps had, at any rate, always been very\r\n  pleasing to him.\r\n\r\n  It would afford the patient a particularly intense pleasure if he were\r\n  to be kicked by a woman, even without shoes, and with bare feet. He\r\n  does not think that the blows, as such, would cause the excitement,\r\n  but rather the thought of being maltreated by a woman; and this might\r\n  follow scolding as well as actual blows. Besides, blows and cross\r\n  words had an exciting effect only when they came from a proud and\r\n  distinguished lady. In general it is the _feeling of humiliation and\r\n  slavish subjection_ that gives the patient lustful pleasure. “Were a\r\n  lady,” the patient tells me, “to command me to wait on her, even with\r\n  distant coldness, I should, nevertheless, feel sensual pleasure.”\r\n\r\n  To the question, whether with boots the feeling of humiliation came\r\n  over him, the patient answers: “I think that this general passion for\r\n  self-humiliation has been concentrated especially on ladies’ boots;\r\n  for it is symbolic of one’s being ‘unworthy to loosen the latchet of\r\n  another’s shoe’; and, besides, a subject kneels.”\r\n\r\n  Women’s stockings also have an exciting effect on the patient, but\r\n  only to a slight extent, and perhaps only through awakening an idea of\r\n  boots. The patient’s passion for ladies’ boots had constantly\r\n  increased, but of late years he thought he had noticed a diminution of\r\n  it. He seldom visits public women, and is also more capable of\r\n  self-restraint. Yet this passion still rules him absolutely, and every\r\n  other pleasure is spoiled by it. A pretty female boot could attract\r\n  his glance from the most beautiful landscape. At the present time he\r\n  often goes about at night in the corridors of hotels,[71] seeking\r\n  elegant ladies’ shoes, which he kisses and presses against his face\r\n  and neck, but principally against his penis.\r\n\r\n  The patient, who is very well-to-do, a short time ago went voluntarily\r\n  to Italy, only with the thought of becoming the servant of a rich and\r\n  distinguished lady unacquainted with him; but the plan failed. The\r\n  patient, who came only for consultation, has not yet been treated\r\n  medically.\r\n\r\n  The foregoing history reaches almost to the present time, and in the\r\n  interval he has made me communications by letter concerning his\r\n  condition. It does not require an extensive commentary. It seems to me\r\n  to be one of the best cases to illustrate the relationship between\r\n  shoe-fetichism and masochism, as set forth by von Krafft-Ebing.[72]\r\n  The principal charm for the patient, as he, without leading questions,\r\n  always emphasizes, is his subjection to a woman, who, in pride and\r\n  position, must be as far above him as possible.\r\n\r\nSuch cases, in which, within a fully-developed circle of masochistic\r\nideas, the foot and the shoe or boot of a woman, conceived as a means of\r\nhumiliation, have become the objects of especial sexual interest, are\r\nnumerous. Through numerous degrees that are easily discriminated, they\r\nform the demonstrable transition to other cases in which the masochistic\r\ninclinations retreat more and more to the background, and little by\r\nlittle pass beyond the threshold of consciousness; while the interest in\r\nwomen’s shoes, apparently absolutely inexplicable, alone remains in\r\nconsciousness. The latter are the numerous cases of shoe-fetichism.\r\nThese very frequent cases of shoe-lovers, which, like all cases of\r\nfetichism, possess forensic interest (theft of shoes), occupy a position\r\nmidway between masochism and fetichism. The majority or all may be\r\nlooked upon as instances of larvated masochism (the motive remaining\r\nunconscious) in which _the female foot or shoe, as the masochist’s\r\nfetich_, has acquired an independent significance.\r\n\r\nNext come two cases in which the female shoe possesses a subordinate\r\ninterest, but in which unmistakable masochistic desires play an\r\nimportant part (comp. Case 44):—\r\n\r\n  Case 61. Mr. X. aged 25, parents healthy, never sick before, places\r\n  the following autobiography at my disposal: “I began to practice\r\n  onanism at the age of ten, without ever having any lustful thoughts\r\n  during the act. Yet at that time—I am sure of this—the sight and touch\r\n  of girls’ elegant boots had a peculiar charm for me; my greatest\r\n  desire was also to wear such shoes,—a wish that was occasionally\r\n  fulfilled at masquerades. But I was also troubled by a very different\r\n  thought: _My ideal was to see myself in a position of humiliation; I\r\n  would gladly have been a slave_, and whipped; in short, I wished to\r\n  receive the treatment that one finds described in many stories of\r\n  slavery. I do not know whether the reading of such stories gave rise\r\n  to my wish, or whether it arose spontaneously.\r\n\r\n  “Puberty began at the age of thirteen; with the occurrence of\r\n  ejaculation lustful pleasure increased, and I masturbated more\r\n  frequently, often two or three times a day. From my twelfth to my\r\n  sixteenth year, during the act of onanism, I always had the idea that\r\n  I was forced to wear girls’ boots. The sight of an elegant boot, on\r\n  the foot of a girl at all pretty, intoxicated me; I inhaled the odor\r\n  of the leather with avidity. In order to smell leather during the act\r\n  of onanism, I bought a pair of leathern cuffs, which I smelled while I\r\n  masturbated. My enthusiasm for ladies’ leathern shoes remains the same\r\n  to-day; only, since my seventeenth year, it has been coupled with the\r\n  _wish to become a servant, to blacken shoes for distinguished ladies,\r\n  to put on and take off their shoes for them, etc._\r\n\r\n  “My dreams at night are made up of shoe-scenes: either I stand before\r\n  the show-window of a shoe-store regarding the elegant ladies’\r\n  shoes,—particularly buttoned shoes,—or I lie at a lady’s feet and\r\n  smell and lick her shoes. For about a year I have given up onanism and\r\n  go ad puellas; coitus takes place through intense thought of ladies’\r\n  buttoned shoes; or, if necessary, I take the shoe of the puella to bed\r\n  with me. I have never suffered from my former onanism. I learn easily,\r\n  have a good memory, and have never had headache in my life. This much\r\n  concerning myself.\r\n\r\n  “A few words about my brother: I am thoroughly convinced that he is\r\n  also a shoe-fetichist. Of the many facts that demonstrate this to me,\r\n  it is only necessary to mention that it is a great pleasure for him to\r\n  have a certain cousin (a very beautiful girl) tread upon him. As for\r\n  the rest, I might undertake to tell whether a man who stands before a\r\n  shoe-store, and regards the shoes on exhibition, is a “foot-lover” or\r\n  not. This anomaly is uncommonly frequent. When in the circle of my\r\n  acquaintance I turn the conversation to the question of what woman’s\r\n  charm is, I very frequently hear it said that it is much more in\r\n  attire than in nudity; but every one is careful not to reveal his\r\n  especial fetich. I think an uncle of mine is also a shoe-fetichist.”\r\n\r\n  Case. 62. Reported by Mantegazza in his “Anthropological Studies,”\r\n  1886, p 110. X., American, of good family, mentally and morally well\r\n  constituted; from the beginning of puberty capable of being excited\r\n  sexually only by a woman’s shoe. Her body and naked or stockinged foot\r\n  made no impression on him; but the foot, when covered with the shoe,\r\n  or a shoe alone, induced erection and even ejaculation. Sight alone\r\n  was sufficient for him in the case of elegant shoes,—_i.e._, shoes of\r\n  black leather, buttoning up the side, and having very high heels. His\r\n  sexual desire was powerfully excited by touching, kissing, or drawing\r\n  on such shoes. His enjoyment was increased by driving nails through\r\n  the soles so that their points would penetrate his feet while walking.\r\n  This caused him terrible pain, but he had real lustful feeling at the\r\n  same time. His greatest enjoyment was to kneel down before the\r\n  elegantly-clad feet of ladies and have them step on him. If the wearer\r\n  were an ugly woman, the shoes would not affect him, and his fancy\r\n  would cool. If the patient had shoes alone at his disposal, his fancy\r\n  would create a beautiful woman wearing them, and ejaculation would\r\n  result. His nightly dreams were of the shoes of beautiful women. He\r\n  considered the exposure of ladies’ shoes in show-windows immoral;\r\n  while talk about the nature of woman seemed to him harmless, but in\r\n  bad taste. X. attempted coitus several times without success;\r\n  ejaculation never occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the following case the masochistic element is also plain enough, as\r\nis also the sadistic (comp. “Torture of Animals,” under “Sadism”):—\r\n\r\n  Case 63. A young, powerful man, aged 26. Nothing in the opposite sex\r\n  excites his sensual feeling except elegant shoes on the feet of a\r\n  handsome woman, especially when they are made of black leather and\r\n  have high heels. The shoes without the wearer are sufficient. It gives\r\n  him the greatest pleasure to see, touch, and kiss them. The feminine\r\n  foot, when bare or covered with a stocking, has no effect on him.\r\n  Since childhood he has had a weakness for ladies’ fine shoes.\r\n\r\n  X. is potent; during the sexual act the female must be elegantly\r\n  dressed and, above all, have on pretty shoes. At the height of sensual\r\n  excitement cruel thoughts about the shoes arise. He is forced to think\r\n  with delight of the death-agonies of the animal from which the leather\r\n  was taken. Sometimes he is impelled to take chickens and other animals\r\n  with him to Phryne, in order to have her tread on them with her pretty\r\n  shoes for his pleasure. He calls this “sacrificing to the feet of\r\n  Venus.” At other times he has the woman walk on him with her shoes on,\r\n  the harder the better.\r\n\r\n  Until the last year it was sufficient—since he did not take the\r\n  slightest sensual pleasure in women—to caress ladies’ shoes that\r\n  pleased him, thus attaining ejaculation and complete satisfaction.\r\n  (Lombroso, _Archiv di Psichiatria_, ix, fascic. iii.)\r\n\r\nThe following case reminds one of the third of this series, on account\r\nof the interest in the nails of the shoes (as capable of inflicting\r\npain); and of the fourth, on account of the slight accompanying sadistic\r\nelement:—\r\n\r\n  Case 64. X., aged 34, married; of neuropathic parentage; suffered\r\n  severely from convulsions as a child; remarkably precocious, but\r\n  one-sided in development (could read at age of three); nervous from\r\n  childhood. At the age of seven he manifested an inclination to handle\r\n  shoes, especially the nails of women’s shoes. The mere sight, but\r\n  still more the touching, of the shoe-nails and counting them, gave him\r\n  indescribable pleasure.\r\n\r\n  At night he gave himself up to imagining how his cousins had their\r\n  measures taken for shoes; how he nailed horse-shoes on to one of them\r\n  or cut her feet off. In time the shoe-scenes came upon him during the\r\n  day, and involuntarily induced erection and ejaculation. Frequently he\r\n  took the shoes of female occupants of the house; and if he touched\r\n  them with his penis he had an ejaculation. For a long time, when a\r\n  student, it was possible for him to control his ideas and\r\n  inclinations; but there came a time when he was compelled to listen to\r\n  female footsteps on the pavements, which, like the sight of the\r\n  nail-marks in ladies’ shoes, or the sight of shoes in the windows of\r\n  the shoe-shops, always gave him a feeling of lustful pleasure. He\r\n  married, and during the first months of his married life was free from\r\n  these desires.\r\n\r\n  Gradually he became hysteropathic and neurasthenic. At this stage he\r\n  began to have hysterical attacks when the shoemaker spoke to him of\r\n  nails in ladies’ shoes or of driving nails in the same. The reaction\r\n  was still greater if he chanced to see a pretty lady with shoes well\r\n  beset with nails. In order to induce ejaculation it was only necessary\r\n  for him to cut soles out of pasteboard and beset them with nails; or\r\n  he would buy ladies’ shoes, have them beset with nails in the store,\r\n  and at home scrape them on the ground, and finally touch the end of\r\n  his penis with them. Moreover, lustful shoe-visions occurred\r\n  spontaneously, in which he satisfied himself by masturbation.\r\n\r\n  X. is otherwise intelligent, skillful in his calling, but powerless in\r\n  combating his perverse inclinations. He presents phimosis; penis\r\n  short, expanded at the root, and incapable of complete erection. One\r\n  day the patient allowed himself to masturbate when excited by the\r\n  sight of ladies’ shoes beset with nails in the window of a shoe-shop,\r\n  and thus became a criminal. (Blanche, _Archiv. de Neurologie_, 1882,\r\n  Nr. 22.)\r\n\r\nReference may be made here to a case of contrary sexuality, to be\r\ndescribed later, in which the principal sexual interest was in the boots\r\nof male servants. The desire was to be trod upon by them.\r\n\r\n  Case 65. (Dr. Pascal, “Igiene dell’ amore.”) X., merchant, from time\r\n  to time (but particularly in bad weather) had the following desire: He\r\n  would accost some prostitute and ask her to go to a shoe-shop with\r\n  him, where he would buy her the handsomest pair of shoes of patent\r\n  leather, under the condition that she would put them on immediately.\r\n  After this took place, she had to go about in the street, walking in\r\n  manure and mud as much as possible, in order to soil the shoes. After\r\n  this, X. would lead the person to an hotel, and, almost before they\r\n  had reached a room, he would cast himself on her feet, feeling an\r\n  extraordinary pleasure in applying his lips to them. When he had\r\n  cleansed the shoes in this manner, he paid her and went his way.\r\n\r\nFrom these cases it may be plainly seen that the shoe is the fetich of\r\nthe masochist, and apparently because of the relation of the dressed\r\nfemale foot to the idea of being trod upon and other acts of\r\nhumiliation. When, therefore, in other cases of shoe-fetichism, the\r\nfemale shoe appears alone as the excitant of sexual desire, one is\r\njustified in presuming that masochistic motives have remained latent.\r\nThe idea of being trod upon, etc., remains in the depths of unconscious\r\nlife, and the idea of the shoe alone, the means for such acts, rises\r\ninto consciousness. Cases that are otherwise wholly inexplicable are\r\nthus sufficiently explained. Here one has to do with larvated masochism;\r\nand this may always be assumed as the unconscious motive, when, as\r\noccurs not exceptionally, the origin of the fetichism, from an\r\nassociation of ideas on the occasion of some particular event, can be\r\nproved, as in Cases 87 and 88.\r\n\r\nSuch cases of desire for ladies’ shoes, without conscious motive and\r\nwithout demonstrable origin, are really innumerable.[73] Three cases are\r\nhere given as examples:—\r\n\r\n  Case 66. Minister, aged 50. From time to time he goes to houses of\r\n  prostitution and asks to rent a room. He enters it with a girl. Then\r\n  he lustfully regards her shoes, takes one off and kisses and bites it.\r\n  Finally, he puts it ad genitalia and ejaculat semen semineque\r\n  ejaculato axillas pectusque terit; then he comes out of his sensual\r\n  ecstasy. He begs the woman to allow him to keep the shoe for a few\r\n  days, and always, at the appointed time, returns it with thanks\r\n  (Cantarano, _La Psichiatria_, v, p. 205).\r\n\r\n  Case 67. Student, Z., aged 23; comes of a tainted family. Sister was\r\n  insane; brother suffered with hysteria virilis. The patient, peculiar\r\n  from childhood, has frequent attacks of hypochondriacal depression,\r\n  tædium vitæ, and feels that he is persecuted. In a consultation on\r\n  account of mental trouble, I find him a very perverse, hereditarily\r\n  predisposed man, with neurasthenic and hypochondriacal symptoms. A\r\n  suspicion of masturbation is confirmed. Patient makes interesting\r\n  disclosures concerning his vita sexualis. At the age of ten he was\r\n  powerfully attracted by the foot of one of his comrades. At twelve he\r\n  became an enthusiast for ladies’ feet. It gave him a delightful\r\n  sensation to revel in the sight of them. At fourteen he began to\r\n  masturbate, thinking, at the same time, of the beautiful foot of a\r\n  lady. From this time on he was taken with the feet of his\r\n  three-year-old sister. The feet of other females that attracted him\r\n  induced sexual excitement. Only women’s feet—no other part of\r\n  them—interested him. The thought of sexual intercourse with women\r\n  excited his disgust. He had never attempted coitus. After his twelfth\r\n  year he had no interest in the feet of male individuals. The style of\r\n  covering of the female foot is indifferent to him; it is only\r\n  necessary that the person seem to be sympathetic. The thought of\r\n  enjoying the feet of prostitutes was disgusting to him. For years he\r\n  had been in love with his sister’s feet. If he could but obtain her\r\n  shoes, the sight of them powerfully excited his sensuality. Kissing or\r\n  embracing his sister did not have this effect. His greatest delight\r\n  was to embrace and kiss the foot of a sympathetic woman, when\r\n  ejaculation would result with a lively pleasurable sensation. Often he\r\n  was impelled to touch his genitals with one of his sister’s shoes; but\r\n  he had been able, thus far, to master this impulse, especially for the\r\n  reason that for two years (owing to progressive irritable weakness of\r\n  the genitals) the simple sight of the foot had induced ejaculation.\r\n  From his relatives it is ascertained that the patient has a silly\r\n  admiration for the feet of his sister; so that she avoids him and\r\n  seeks to hide her feet from him. The patient looks upon his perverse\r\n  sexual impulse as pathological, and is painfully affected by the fact\r\n  that his vile fancy has for its object his sister’s foot. He avoided\r\n  opportunity as much as he could, and sought to help the matter by\r\n  masturbation when, as in dreams accompanied by pollution, ladies’ feet\r\n  filled his imagination. However, when the impulse became too powerful\r\n  he could not avoid gaining a partial sight of his sister’s foot.\r\n  Immediately after ejaculation he would become angry with himself at\r\n  having been weak again. His partiality for his sister’s foot had cost\r\n  him many a sleepless night. He often wondered that he could still love\r\n  his sister. Although it seemed right to him that she should conceal\r\n  her feet from him, yet he was often irritated because the concealment\r\n  caused him to have pollutions. The patient gives assurances of being\r\n  moral in other respects, which are confirmed by his relatives.\r\n\r\n  Case 68. S., New York, is accused of being a street-thief. Numerous\r\n  cases of insanity in his ancestry; father, brother, and sister\r\n  mentally abnormal. At seven years, violent cerebral concussion twice.\r\n  At thirteen, struck with a beam. At fourteen S. had violent attacks of\r\n  headache. Accompanying these attacks, or immediately after them,\r\n  peculiar impulse to take the shoes of female members of the family—as\r\n  a rule, those belonging to one member—and hide them in some\r\n  out-of-the-way corner. Taken to task, he would lie, or declare that he\r\n  had no memory of the affair. The passion for shoes was unconquerable,\r\n  and made its appearance every three or four months. On one occasion he\r\n  attempted to take the shoe from the foot of one of the servants, and\r\n  on another he stole his sister’s shoe from her sleeping-apartment. In\r\n  the spring two ladies had their shoes torn from their feet in the open\r\n  street. In August S. left his home early in the morning to go to his\r\n  work as a printer. A moment afterward he tore the shoe from a girl’s\r\n  foot in the open street, fled to his place of work, and there was\r\n  arrested as a street-thief. He declared that he did not know much of\r\n  his act; that it had come upon him like a stroke of lightning, at the\r\n  sight of a shoe, that he must possess himself of it, but for what\r\n  purpose he did not know. He had acted while in a state of\r\n  unconsciousness. The shoe, as he correctly indicated, was found in his\r\n  coat. In confinement he was so much excited mentally that an outbreak\r\n  of insanity was feared. Discharged, he stole his wife’s shoes while\r\n  she slept. His moral character and habits of life were blameless. He\r\n  was an intelligent workman; but irregularity of employment, that soon\r\n  followed, made him confused and incapable of work. Pardoned. (Nichols,\r\n  _Am. Journal of Insanity_, 1859; Beck, “Med. Jurisprudence,” vol. i,\r\n  p. 732, 1860.)\r\n\r\nDr. Pascal (_op. cit._) has some similar cases, and many others have\r\nbeen mentioned to me by colleagues and patients.\r\n\r\n(c) _Disgusting Acts for the Purpose of Self-Humiliation and Sexual\r\nGratification_—_Larvated Masochism._—There are numerous established\r\ncases in which perverted men are thrown into sexual excitement by the\r\nsecretions, or even the excretions, of women, and try to see and touch\r\nthem. Probably in these cases there is almost always an unconscious\r\nmasochistic impulse,—pleasure in the most extreme humiliation of self,\r\nand desire to experience it.\r\n\r\nThis connection is made perfectly clear by the confessions of those\r\naffected with this repugnant perversion. Case 88 of the sixth\r\nedition—that of an individual affected with contrary sexuality, which is\r\nlater described—is here instructive. The subject of this case not only\r\nrevels in the thought of being the slave of the beloved man, and refers\r\non this point to Sacher-Masoch’s “Venus in Furs,” sed etiam sibi fingit\r\namatum poscere ut crepidas sudore diffluentes olfaciat ejusque stercore\r\nvescatur. Deinde narrat, quia non habeat, quæ confingat et exoptet,\r\neorum loco suas crepidas sudore infectas olfacere suoque stercore vesci,\r\ninter quæ facta pene errecto se voluptate perturbari semenque ejaculari.\r\n\r\nThe masochistic significance of a disgusting act in the following case,\r\ncommunicated by a professional friend, is clear:—\r\n\r\n  Case 69. H. v. G., landed proprietor; major; died in his sixtieth\r\n  year; came of a family in which irresponsibility, tendency to run in\r\n  debt, and defect of morals are hereditary. In his youth he was given\r\n  to most reckless dissipation (he was known as the leader of “naked\r\n  balls”). He was always of a cynical and brutal nature, though\r\n  punctilious and exact in his military service, which, on account of a\r\n  disreputable affair that was not made known, he had to leave, and he\r\n  lived in private life seventeen years. Untrammeled by the necessity to\r\n  earn his living, he led everywhere the life of a man-of-the-town, and\r\n  was everywhere avoided on account of his lascivious nature. His\r\n  ostracism by the best society, which, in spite of his independence, he\r\n  noticed, caused him to prefer the ordinary society of fakirs,\r\n  artisans, and loafers. It cannot be ascertained that he had sexual\r\n  intercourse with men, but it is certain that in his later years he\r\n  arranged symposiums with mixed company and was known as a _roué_. In\r\n  the last few years of his life he was accustomed to hang about new\r\n  buildings in the evening, and of the women working there he would ask\r\n  the dirtiest to accompany him. It is certain that he had the woman\r\n  undress, and then he would suck her toes, his libido being excited and\r\n  satisfied by the act.\r\n\r\nCantarano also reports a case in _La Psichiatria_, v year, p. 207, in\r\nwhich, preceding the act, apparently from a similar cause, there was\r\nbiting and sucking of a woman’s toes in as filthy a state as possible.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases have come to my knowledge in which, with other masochistic\r\nacts (maltreatment, humiliation), such disgusting desires were\r\nentertained; and the confessions of the individuals left no doubt of\r\ntheir significance.\r\n\r\nSuch cases prepare the way to an understanding of others which are\r\nabsolutely incomprehensible without the connection with the\r\nmasochistic desire for humiliation.[74] It is probable, however, that\r\nthis impulse, in its actual significance, remains unknown to the\r\nperverted individual, and only the desire for disgusting things rises\r\ninto consciousness,—again larvated masochism.\r\n\r\nOther cases of Cantarano’s (_loc. cit._) belong here: mictio even\r\ndefæcatio puellæ ad linguam viri ante actum; consumption of confects\r\nsmelling like fæces, in order to become potent; and also the following\r\ncase, likewise communicated to me by a physician:—\r\n\r\n  Case 70. A Russian prince, who was very decrepit, was accustomed to\r\n  have his mistress turn her back to him and defecate on his breast;\r\n  this being the only way in which he could excite the remnant of\r\n  libido.\r\n\r\n  Another supported a mistress in unusually brilliant style, with the\r\n  condition that she eat marchpane exclusively. Ut libidinosus fiat et\r\n  ejaculare possit excrementa feminæ ore excipit. A Brazilian physician\r\n  tells me of several cases of defæcatio feminæ in os viri that have\r\n  come to his knowledge. Such cases occur everywhere, and are not at all\r\n  infrequent. All kinds of secretions—saliva, nasal mucus, and even\r\n  aural cerumen—are used in this way and swallowed with pleasure; and\r\n  oscula ad nates and even ad anum are indulged in. Dr. Moll (_op.\r\n  cit._, p. 135) reports the same thing of a man affected with contrary\r\n  sexuality. The perverse desire to practice cunnilingus, which is very\r\n  wide-spread, probably frequently has its root in masochistic impulses.\r\n\r\nPalanda (_Archivio di Psichiatria._ x, fascicolo 3, 4) relates the\r\nfollowing case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 71. W., aged 45, predisposed, was given to masturbation at the\r\n  age of eight. A decimo sexto anno libidines suas bibendo recentem\r\n  feminarum urinam satiavit. Tanta erat voluptas urinam bibentis ut nec\r\n  aliquid olfaceret nec saperet, hæc faciens. After drinking he always\r\n  experienced disgust and ill-feeling, and made firm resolutions to do\r\n  it no more in the future. Once he had the same pleasure in drinking\r\n  the urine of a nine-year-old boy, with whom he once practiced\r\n  fellatio. The patient suffers with epileptic insanity.\r\n\r\nThe cases described in this group form the complete counterpart to group\r\n“_d_” of the sadists.\r\n\r\n  Still other older cases belong here, which Tardieu (“Étude\r\n  médico-légale sur les attentats aux mœurs,” p. 206) observed in senile\r\n  individuals. He describes as “Renifleurs” persons “qui in secretos\r\n  locos nimirum theatrorum pasticos convenientes quo complures feminæ ad\r\n  micturiendum festinant, per nares urinali odore excitati, illico se\r\n  invicem polluunt.” The “Stercoraires” that Taxil (“La prostitution\r\n  contemporaine”) mentions are, in relation to this subject, unique.\r\n\r\nFinally, space is here given to the following case, reported to me by a\r\nphysician:—\r\n\r\n  Case 72. A notary, known from his youth to those about him as peculiar\r\n  and misanthropic. During his school-days he was given to masturbation.\r\n  According to his own story, he excited his sexual desire by spreading\r\n  out on the cover of his bed pieces of toilet-paper that he had used,\r\n  induced erection by regarding and smelling them, and then practiced\r\n  masturbation. After his death, by the side of his bed, there was found\r\n  a large basket of such papers, with the dates marked on them. Here\r\n  there were probably fancies of the nature of the above-mentioned acts.\r\n\r\n(d) _Masochism in Women._—In woman voluntary subjection to the opposite\r\nsex is a physiological phenomenon. Owing to her passive _rôle_ in\r\nprocreation and long-existent social conditions, ideas of subjection\r\nare, in woman, normally connected with the idea of sexual relations. So\r\nto speak, they form the harmonics which determine the tone-quality of\r\nfeminine feeling.\r\n\r\nAny one conversant with the history of civilization knows in what a\r\nstate of absolute subjection woman was always kept until a relatively\r\nhigh degree of civilization was reached;[75] and an attentive observer\r\nof life may still easily recognize how the custom of unnumbered\r\ngenerations, in connection with the passive _rôle_ with which woman has\r\nbeen endowed by Nature, has given her an instinctive inclination to\r\nvoluntary subordination to man; he will notice that exaggeration of\r\ncustomary gallantry is very distasteful to women, and that a deviation\r\nfrom it in the direction of masterful behavior, though loudly\r\nreprehended, is often accepted with secret satisfaction.[76] Under the\r\nveneer of polite society the instinct of feminine servitude is\r\neverywhere discernible.\r\n\r\nThus it is easy to regard masochism in general as a pathological growth\r\nof specific feminine mental elements,—as an abnormal intensification of\r\ncertain features of the psycho-sexual character of woman,—and to seek\r\nits primary origin in that sex (_v. infra_, p. 145). It may, however, be\r\nheld to be established that, in woman, an inclination to subordination\r\nto man (which may be regarded as an acquired, purposeful arrangement, a\r\nphenomenon of adaptation to social requirements) is to a certain extent\r\na normal manifestation.\r\n\r\nThe reason that, under such circumstances, the “poetry” of the symbolic\r\nact of subjection is not reached, lies partly in the fact that man has\r\nnot the vanity of that weakling who would use blows to display his power\r\n(as the love-serving knights did with the ladies of the Middle Ages),\r\nbut prefers to demonstrate his real advantages. The barbarian has his\r\nwife plow for him, and the civilized lover speculates about her dowry;\r\nshe willingly endures both.\r\n\r\nCases of pathological increase of this instinct of subjection, in the\r\nsense of feminine masochism, are probably frequent enough, but custom\r\nrepresses their manifestation. Many young women like nothing better than\r\nto kneel before their husbands or lovers. Among all Slavs of the lower\r\nclasses it is said that the wives feel hurt if they are not beaten by\r\ntheir husbands. A Hungarian officer informs me that peasant women of the\r\nSomogy’er Comitates do not think they are loved by their husbands until\r\nthey have received the first box on the ear as a sign of love.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be difficult for the physician to find cases of\r\nfeminine masochism. Subjective and objective restraints—modesty and\r\ncustom—naturally constitute, in women, insurmountable obstacles to the\r\nexpression of perverse sexual instinct. Thus it happens that, up to the\r\npresent time, but one case of masochism in a woman has been\r\nscientifically established; and this is accompanied by circumstances\r\nthat obscure it.\r\n\r\n  Case 73. Miss v. X., Russian, aged 35; of greatly predisposed family.\r\n  For some years she has been in the initial stage of paranoia\r\n  persecutoria. This sprang from cerebro-spinal neurasthenia, the origin\r\n  of which is found to be sexual hyper-excitation. Since her\r\n  twenty-fourth year she has been given to masturbation. As a result of\r\n  disappointment in an engagement and intense sexual excitement, she\r\n  began to practice masturbation and psychical onanism. _Inclination\r\n  toward persons of her own sex never occurred._ The patient says: “At\r\n  the age of six or eight I conceived a desire to be whipped. Since I\r\n  had never been whipped, and had never been present when others were\r\n  thus punished, I cannot understand how I came to have this strange\r\n  desire. I can only think that it is congenital. With these ideas of\r\n  being whipped I had a feeling of actual delight, and pictured in my\r\n  fancy how fine it would be to be whipped by one of my female friends.\r\n  I never had any thought of being whipped by a man. I reveled in the\r\n  idea, and never attempted any actual realization of my fancies. These\r\n  disappeared after my tenth year. Only when I read “Rousseau’s\r\n  Confessions,” at the age of thirty-four, did I understand what my\r\n  longing for whippings meant, and that my abnormal ideas were like\r\n  those of Rousseau. Since my tenth year I have never had any more such\r\n  fancies.”\r\n\r\nOn account of its original character and the reference to Rousseau, this\r\ncase may with certainty be called a case of masochism. The fact that it\r\nis a female friend that is conceived in imagination as whipping her, is\r\nexplained by the circumstance that the masochistic desire was here\r\npresent in the mind of a child before the psychical vita sexualis had\r\ndeveloped and the instinct for the male had been awakened. Contrary\r\nsexual instinct is here expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN MASOCHISM.\r\n\r\nThe facts of masochism are certainly among the most interesting in the\r\ndomain of psychopathology. An attempt to explain them must first seek to\r\ndistinguish in them the essential from the unessential. The\r\ndistinguishing characteristic in masochism is certainly the unlimited\r\nsubjection to the will of a person of the opposite sex (in sadism, on\r\nthe contrary, the unlimited mastery of this person), with the awakening\r\nand accompaniment of lustful sexual feelings to the degree of orgasm.\r\nFrom all that has preceded it is clear that the particular manner in\r\nwhich this relation of subjection or domination is expressed (_v.\r\nsupra_), whether in simply symbolic acts, or whether there is also a\r\ndesire to suffer pain at the hands of a person of the opposite sex, is a\r\nsubordinate matter.\r\n\r\nWhile sadism may be looked upon as a pathological intensification of the\r\nmasculine sexual character in its psychical peculiarities, masochism\r\nrather represents a pathological degeneration of the distinctive\r\npsychical peculiarities of woman. But masculine masochism is undoubtedly\r\nfrequent; and it is this that most frequently comes under observation\r\nand almost exclusively makes up the series of observed cases. The reason\r\nfor this has been previously stated (p. 139).\r\n\r\nTwo sources of masochism can be distinguished in the sphere of normal\r\nphenomena. The first is, that in the state of lustful excitement every\r\nimpression made by the person giving rise to the sexual stimulus,\r\nindependently of the nature of its action, is pleasing to the individual\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely physiological that playful taps and light blows should be\r\ntaken for caresses,\r\n\r\n        “Like the lover’s pinch which hurts and is desired.”[77]\r\n\r\nFrom here the step is not long to a state where the wish to experience a\r\nvery intense impression at the hands of the consort leads to a desire\r\nfor blows, etc., in cases of pathological intensification of lust; for\r\npain is always a ready means for producing an intense bodily impression.\r\nJust as in sadism the sexual emotion leads to a state of exaltation in\r\nwhich the excessive motor excitement implicates neighboring nervous\r\ntracts; so in masochism an ecstatic state arises, in which the rising\r\nflood of a single emotion ravenously devours and covers with lust every\r\nimpression coming from the beloved person.\r\n\r\nThe second and, indeed, the most important source of masochism is to be\r\nsought in a wide-spread phenomenon, which, though it is extraordinary\r\nand abnormal, by no means lies within the domain of sexual perversion.\r\n\r\nI here refer to the very prevalent fact that in innumerable instances,\r\nwhich occur in all varieties, one individual becomes dependent on\r\nanother of the opposite sex, in a very extraordinary and remarkable\r\nmanner,—even to the loss of all independent will; a dependence which\r\nforces the party in subjection to acts and suffering which greatly\r\nprejudice personal interest, and often enough to offense against both\r\nmorality and law.\r\n\r\nThis dependence, however, differs from the manifestations of normal life\r\nonly in the intensity of the sexual feeling that here comes in play, and\r\nin the slight degree of will-power necessary for the maintenance of its\r\nequilibrium. The difference is one of intensity, not of quality, as in\r\nmasochistic manifestations.\r\n\r\nThis dependence of one person upon another of the opposite sex, that is\r\nabnormal but not perverse,—a phenomena possessing great interest when\r\nregarded from a forensic stand-point,—I designate “_sexual\r\nbondage_;”[78] for the relations and circumstances attending it have in\r\nall respects the character of bondage. The will of the ruling individual\r\ndominates that of the person in subjection, just as a master’s does his\r\nbondsman’s.[79]\r\n\r\nThis “sexual bondage,” as has been said, is certainly an abnormal\r\nphenomenon. It begins with the first deviation from the normal. The\r\ndegree of dependence of one person upon another, or of two upon each\r\nother, resulting from individual peculiarity in the intensity of motives\r\nthat in themselves are normal, constitutes the normal standard\r\nestablished by law and custom. Sexual bondage is not a perverse\r\nmanifestation, however; the instinctive activities at work here are the\r\nsame as those that set in motion—even though it be with less\r\nviolence—the psychical vita sexualis which moves entirely within normal\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nFear of losing the companion and the desire to keep him always\r\nsatisfied, amiable, and inclined to sexual intercourse, are here the\r\nmotives of the individual in subjection. An extraordinary degree of\r\nlove—which, particularly in woman, does not always indicate an unusual\r\ndegree of sensuality—and a weak character are the simple elements of\r\nthis extraordinary process.[80]\r\n\r\nThe motive of the dominant individual is egoism, which finds unlimited\r\nroom for action.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of sexual bondage are various in form, and the cases\r\nare very numerous.[81] At every step in life we find men that have\r\nfallen into sexual bondage. Among married men, hen-pecked husbands\r\nbelong to this category, particularly elderly men who marry young wives\r\nand try to overcome the disparity of years and physical defects by\r\nunconditional submission to the wife’s every whim; and unmarried men of\r\nripe maturity, who seek to better their last chance of love by unlimited\r\nsacrifice, are also to be enumerated here. Here belong, also, men of any\r\nage, who, seized by hot passion for a woman, meet coldness and\r\ncalculation, and have to capitulate on hard conditions; men of loving\r\nnatures who allow themselves to be persuaded to marriage by notorious\r\nprostitutes; men who, to run after adventuresses, leave everything and\r\njeopardise their future; husbands and fathers who leave wife and child,\r\nto lay the income of a family at the feet of a harlot.\r\n\r\nBut, numerous as the examples of masculine “bondage” are, every observer\r\nof life, who is at all unprejudiced, must allow that they are far from\r\nequalling, in number and importance, the cases of feminine “bondage.”\r\nThis is easily explained. For a man, love is almost always only an\r\nepisode, and he has many other and important interests; for a woman, on\r\nthe other hand, love is the principal thing in life, and, until the\r\nbirth of children, always her first interest. After this it is still\r\noften her first thought, but always, at least, takes the second place.\r\nBut, what is still more important, the man ruled by this impulse easily\r\nsatisfies it in embraces for which he finds unlimited opportunities. A\r\nwoman in the upper classes of society, if she have a husband, is bound\r\nto him alone; and even in the lower classes there are still great\r\nobstacles to polyandry. Therefore, _a woman’s husband means for her the\r\nwhole sex_, and his importance to her becomes very great. It must also\r\nbe considered that the normal relation established by law and custom\r\nbetween husband and wife is far from being one of equality. In itself it\r\nexpresses a sufficient predominance of woman’s dependence. The\r\nconcessions she makes to her lover, to retain the love which it would be\r\nalmost impossible for her to replace, only plunge her deeper in bondage;\r\nand this increases the insatiable demands of husbands resolved to use\r\ntheir advantage and traffic in woman’s readiness to sacrifice herself.\r\n\r\nHere may be placed the fortune-hunter, who for money allows himself to\r\nbe enveloped in the easily created illusions of a maiden; the seducer,\r\nand the man who compromises wives, calculating on blackmail; the gilded\r\narmy officer and the musician with the lion’s mane, who know so well how\r\nto stammer “Thee or death!” as a means to pay debts and provide a life\r\nof ease. Here, too, belong the kitchen-soldier, whose love the cook\r\nreturns with love plus means to satisfy a different appetite; the\r\ndrinker, who consumes the savings of the mistress he marries; and the\r\nman who with blows compels the prostitute on whom he lives to earn a\r\ncertain sum for him daily. These are only a few of the innumerable forms\r\nof bondage into which woman is forced by her greater need of love and\r\nthe difficulties of her position.\r\n\r\nThe subject of “sexual bondage” must here receive brief consideration;\r\nfor in it may be clearly seen the soil from which the main root of\r\nmasochism springs. The relationship of these two phenomena of psychical\r\nsexual life is immediately apparent. Bondage and masochism both consist\r\nof the unconditional subjection of the individual affected with the\r\nabnormality to a person of the opposite sex, and of domination of the\r\nformer by the latter.[82] The two phenomena, however, must be strictly\r\ndifferentiated; they are not different in degree, but in quality.\r\n\r\nSexual bondage is not a perversion and not pathological; the elements\r\nfrom which it arises—love and weakness of will—are not perverse; it is\r\nonly their simultaneous activity that produces the abnormal result which\r\nis so opposed to self-interest, and often to custom and law. The motive,\r\nin obedience to which the subordinated individual acts and endures\r\ntyranny, is the normal instinct toward woman (or man); the satisfaction\r\nof which is the price of bondage. The acts of the person in subjection,\r\nby means of which the bondage is expressed, are performed at the command\r\nof the ruling individual, to satisfy selfishness, etc. For the\r\nsubordinated individual they have no independent purpose; they are only\r\nthe means to an end,—to obtain or retain possession of the ruling\r\nindividual. Finally, bondage is a result of love for a particular\r\nperson; it first appears when this love is awakened.\r\n\r\nIn masochism, which is decidedly abnormal and a perversion, this is all\r\nvery different. The motive of the acts and suffering of the person in\r\nsubjection is here the charm afforded by the tyranny in itself. There\r\nmay, at the same time, be a desire for coitus with the dominant person;\r\nbut the impulse is directed to the acts which serve to express the\r\ntyranny, as the immediate objects of gratification. These acts in which\r\nmasochism is expressed are, for the individual in subjection, not means\r\nto an end, as in bondage, but the end in themselves. Finally, in\r\nmasochism the longing for subjection occurs _a priori_, before the\r\noccurrence of an inclination to any particular object of love.\r\n\r\nThe connection between bondage and masochism may be assumed by reason of\r\nthe correspondence of the two phenomena in the objective condition of\r\ndependence, notwithstanding the difference in their motives; and the\r\ntransformation of the abnormality into the perversion probably takes\r\nplace in the following manner: Any one living for a long time in sexual\r\nbondage becomes disposed to acquire a slight degree of masochism. Love\r\nthat willingly bears the tyranny of the loved one then becomes an\r\nimmediate love of tyranny. _When the idea of being tyrannized over is\r\nlong closely associated with the lustful thought of the beloved person,\r\nthe lustful emotion is finally connected with the tyranny itself, and\r\nthe transformation to perversion is completed._ This is the manner in\r\nwhich masochism may be acquired by cultivation.[83]\r\n\r\nThus a mild degree of masochism may arise from “bondage,”—become\r\nacquired; but genuine, complete, deep-rooted masochism, with its\r\nfeverish longing for subjection from the time of earliest youth, is\r\ncongenital.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the origin of the infrequent perversion of fully\r\ndeveloped masochism is most probably to be found in the assumption that\r\nit arises from the very frequent abnormality of “sexual bondage”; in\r\nthat now and then _this abnormality is hereditarily transferred to a\r\npsychopathic individual in such a way that it becomes transformed into a\r\nperversion_. It has been previously shown how a slight displacement of\r\nthe psychical element under consideration may effect this transition.\r\n\r\nThis transformation of the abnormality into the perversion, through\r\nhereditary transference, would take place very easily where the\r\npsychopathic constitution of the descendant presented the other factor\r\nof masochism,—_i.e._, what has been previously called its main root,—the\r\ntendency of sexually hyperæsthetic natures to assimilate all impressions\r\ncoming from the beloved person with the sexual impression.\r\n\r\nFrom these two elements,—from “sexual bondage” on the one hand, and from\r\nthe above-mentioned disposition to sexual ecstasy, which apperceives\r\neven maltreatment with lustful emotion, on the other,—the roots of which\r\nmay be traced back to the field of physiological facts, masochism arises\r\non the basis of psychopathic predisposition; in that its sexual\r\nhyperæsthesia intensifies first all the physiological accessories of the\r\nvita sexualis and, finally, only its abnormal accompaniments, to the\r\npathological degree of perversion.[84]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, masochism, as a congenital sexual perversion, constitutes a\r\nfunctional sign of degeneration in (almost exclusively) hereditary\r\ntaint; and this clinical deduction is confirmed in my cases of masochism\r\nand sadism. It is easy to demonstrate that the peculiar,\r\npsychically-anomalous direction of the vita sexualis which masochism\r\nrepresents, is an original abnormality, and not, so to speak, cultivated\r\nin a predisposed individual by passive flagellation, through association\r\nof ideas, as Rousseau and Binet suppose. This is shown by the numerous\r\ncases of masochism—in fact, the majority—in which flagellation never\r\nappears; in which the perverse impulse is directed exclusively to purely\r\nsymbolic acts expressing subjection without any actual infliction of\r\npain. This is demonstrated by the whole series of cases, from Case 53,\r\ngiven here.\r\n\r\nThe same result—namely, that passive flagellation is not the nucleus\r\naround which all the rest is gathered—is reached when closer study is\r\ngiven to the cases in which passive flagellation plays a _rôle_, as in\r\nCase 44 and Case 50. Case 51 is particularly instructive in relation to\r\nthis; for in this instance there can be no thought of a\r\nsexually-stimulating effect of punishment received in youth. Moreover,\r\nin this case, connection with an early experience is not possible; for\r\nthe situation constituting the object of principal sexual interest is\r\nabsolutely incapable of being carried out by a child.\r\n\r\nFinally, the origin of masochism in purely psychical elements, on\r\nconfronting it with sadism (_v. infra_), is convincingly demonstrated.\r\nThat passive flagellation occurs so frequently in masochism is explained\r\nsimply by the fact that it is the most extreme means of expressing the\r\nrelation of subjection.\r\n\r\nI repeat that the decisive points, in the differentiation of simple\r\npassive flagellation from flagellation dependent upon masochistic\r\ndesire, are that, in the former, the act is a means to make coitus, or\r\nat least ejaculation, possible; and that, in the latter, it is a means\r\nof gratification of masochistic desires.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, masochists subject themselves to all other\r\nkinds of maltreatment and suffering in which there can be no question of\r\nreflex excitation of lust. Since such cases are numerous, in such acts\r\n(and in flagellation in masochists, having like significance) we must\r\nseek to ascertain in what relation pain and lust stand to each other.\r\nFrom the statement of a masochist it is as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe relation is not of such a nature that that which causes physical\r\npain is here simply perceived as physical pleasure; but the person in a\r\nstate of masochistic ecstasy feels no pain; either because, by reason of\r\nhis emotional state (like that of the soldier in battle), the physical\r\neffect on his cutaneous nerves is not apperceived; or because (as with\r\nreligious martyrs and enthusiasts), with the preoccupation of\r\nconsciousness with lustful emotion, the idea of maltreatment remains\r\nmerely a symbol, without its quality of pain.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent there is over-compensation of physical pain in\r\npsychical pleasure; and only the excess remains in consciousness as\r\npsychical lust. This also undergoes an increase; since, either through\r\nreflex spinal influence or through a peculiar coloring in the sensorium\r\nof sensory impressions, a kind of hallucination of bodily pleasure takes\r\nplace, with a vague localization of the objectively projected sensation.\r\n\r\nIn the self-torture of religious enthusiasts (fakirs, howling dervishes,\r\nreligious flagellants) there is an analogous state, only with a\r\ndifference in the quality of pleasurable feeling. Here the conception of\r\nmartyrdom is also apperceived without its pain; for consciousness is\r\nfilled with the pleasurably colored idea of serving God, atoning for\r\nsins, deserving heaven, etc., through martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MASOCHISM AND SADISM.\r\n\r\nThe perfect counterpart of masochism is sadism. While in the former\r\nthere is a desire to suffer and be subjected to violence, in the latter\r\nthe wish is to inflict pain and use violence.\r\n\r\nThe parallelism is perfect. All the acts and situations used by the\r\nsadist in the active _rôle_ become the object of the desire of the\r\nmasochist in the passive _rôle_. In both perversions these acts advance\r\nfrom purely symbolic acts to severe maltreatment. Even murder, in which\r\nsadism reaches its acme, finds, as is shown by Case 54,—of course, only\r\nin fancy,—its passive counterpart. Under favoring conditions, both\r\nperversions may occur with a normal vita sexualis; in both, the acts in\r\nwhich they express themselves are preparatory for coitus or substitutes\r\nfor it.[85]\r\n\r\nBut the analogy does not exist simply in external manifestation; it also\r\nextends to the subjective character of both perversions. Both are to be\r\nregarded as original psychopathies in mentally abnormal individuals,\r\nwho, in particular, are affected with psychical hyperæsthesia sexualis,\r\nand, as a rule, also with other abnormalities; and for each of these\r\nperversions two constituent elements may be demonstrated, which have\r\ntheir roots in psychical facts lying within physiological limits. For\r\nmasochism, as shown above, these elements lie in the fact (1) that in\r\nthe state of sexual emotion every impression produced by the consort,\r\nindependently of the manner of its production, is, _per se_, attended\r\nwith lustful pleasure, which, where there is hyperæsthesia sexualis, may\r\ngo so far as to over-compensate all painful sensation; and in the fact\r\n(2) that “sexual bondage,” dependent on mental factors that are in\r\nthemselves not perverse, may, under pathological conditions, become a\r\nperverse, pleasurable desire for subjection to the opposite sex,\r\nwhich—even if it be quite unnecessary to assume its inheritance from the\r\nfemale side—represents a pathological degeneration of the character\r\nbelonging to woman,—of the instinct of subordination, physiological in\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this, there are, likewise, two constituent elements\r\nexplanatory of sadism, the origin of which may also be traced back\r\nwithin physiological limits. These are: the fact (1) that in sexual\r\nemotion, to a certain extent, as an accompanying psychical excitation,\r\nan impulse may arise to influence the object of desire in every possible\r\nway and with the greatest possible intensity, which, in individuals\r\nsexually hyperæsthetic, may become an impulse to inflict pain; and the\r\nfact (2) that, under pathological conditions, the man’s active _rôle_ of\r\nwinning woman may become an unlimited desire for subjugation.\r\n\r\nThus masochism and sadism represent perfect counterparts. It is also in\r\nharmony with this that the individuals affected with these perversions\r\nregard the opposite perversion in the other sex as their ideal, as shown\r\nby Case 44 and Case 50, and also by “Rousseau’s Confessions.”\r\n\r\nBut the contrast of masochism and sadism may also be used to invalidate\r\nthe assumption that the former has its origin in the reflex effect of\r\npassive flagellation; and that all the rest is the product of\r\nassociations of related ideas, as Binet, in explanation of Rousseau’s\r\ncase, thinks, and as Rousseau himself believed.\r\n\r\nIn the active maltreatment forming the object of the sadist’s sexual\r\ndesire there is, in fact, no irritation of his own sensory nerves by the\r\nact of maltreatment; so that there can be no doubt of the purely\r\npsychical character of the origin of this perversion. Sadism and\r\nmasochism, however, are so related to each other, and so correspond in\r\nall points with each other, that the one allows, by analogy, a\r\nconclusion for the other; and this is alone sufficient to establish the\r\npurely psychical character of masochism.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above-detailed contrast of all the elements and\r\nphenomena of masochism and sadism, and as a _résumé_ of all observed\r\ncases, lust in the infliction of pain and lust in inflicted pain appear\r\nbut as two different sides of the same psychical process, of which the\r\nprimary and essential thing is the consciousness of active or passive\r\nsubjection, in which the combination of cruelty and lustful pleasure has\r\nonly a secondary psychological significance. Acts of cruelty serve to\r\nexpress this subjection; first, because they are the most extreme means\r\nfor the expression of this relation; and, again, because they represent\r\nthe most intense effect that one person, either with or without coitus,\r\ncan exert on another.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which sadism and masochism occur simultaneously in one\r\nindividual are interesting, but they present some difficulties of\r\nexplanation. Cases 49, 50, 58, etc., are of this kind, and also\r\nparticularly Case 30. From the latter it is evident that it is\r\nespecially the idea of subjection that, both actively and passively,\r\nforms the nucleus of the perverse desires. Traces of the same thing are\r\nalso to be observed, with more or less clearness, in many other cases.\r\nAt any rate, one of the two perversions is always markedly predominant.\r\n\r\nOwing to this marked predominance of one perversion, and the later\r\nappearance of the other, in such cases it may well be assumed that the\r\npredominating perversion is _original_, and that the other has been\r\n_acquired_ in the course of time. The ideas of subjection and\r\nmaltreatment, colored with lustful pleasure, either in an active or\r\npassive sense, have become deeply impressed in such an individual.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the imagination is tempted to try the same ideas in an\r\ninverted _rôle_. There may even be realization of this inversion. Such\r\nattempts in imagination and in acts, however, are usually soon abandoned\r\nas inadequate for the original inclination.\r\n\r\nMasochism and sadism also occur in combination with contrary sexual\r\ninstinct, and, too, in association with all forms and degrees of this\r\nperversion. The individual of contrary sexuality may be a sadist as well\r\nas masochist (comp. Cases 48 and 49 and numerous cases in the following\r\nseries of cases of contrary sexual instinct).\r\n\r\nWherever a sexual perversion has developed on the basis of a neuropathic\r\nindividuality, sexual hyperæsthesia, which may always be assumed to be\r\npresent, may induce the phenomena of masochism and sadism—now of the\r\none, now of both combined, one arising from the other. Thus masochism\r\nand sadism appear as the fundamental forms of psycho-sexual perversion,\r\nwhich may make their appearance at any point in the domain of sexual\r\naberration.[86]\r\n\r\n3. _The Association of Lust with the Idea of Certain Portions of the\r\nFemale Person, or with Certain Articles of Female Attire—Fetichism._—In\r\nthe considerations concerning the psychology of the normal sexual life\r\nin the introduction to this work (_vide_ p. 17), it was shown that,\r\nwithin physiological limits, the pronounced preference for a certain\r\nportion of the body of persons of the opposite sex, particularly for a\r\ncertain form of this part, may attain great psycho-sexual importance.\r\nIndeed, the especial power of attraction possessed by certain forms and\r\npeculiarities for many men—in fact, the majority—may be regarded as the\r\nreal principle of individualization in love.\r\n\r\nThis preference for certain particular physical characteristics in\r\npersons of the opposite sex,—by the side of which, likewise, a marked\r\npreference for certain psychical characteristics may be\r\ndemonstrated,—following Binet (“du Fetischisme dans l’amour,” _Revue\r\nphilosophique_, 1887) and Lombroso (Introduction to the Italian edition\r\nof the second edition of this work), I have called “fetichism”; because\r\nthis enthusiasm for certain portions of the body (or even articles of\r\nattire) and the worship of them, in obedience to sexual impulses,\r\nfrequently call to mind the reverence for relics, holy objects, etc., in\r\nreligious cults. This physiological fetichism has already been described\r\nin detail on page 17 _et seq._\r\n\r\nBy the side of this physiological fetichism, however, there is, in the\r\npsycho-sexual sphere, an undoubted pathological, erotic fetichism, of\r\nwhich there is already a numerous series of cases presenting phenomena\r\nhaving great clinical and psychiatric interest, and, under certain\r\ncircumstances, forensic importance. This pathological fetichism does not\r\nconfine itself to certain parts of the body alone, but it is even\r\nextended to inanimate objects, which, however, are almost always\r\narticles of female wearing-apparel, and thus stand in close relation\r\nwith the female person.\r\n\r\nThis pathological fetichism is connected, through gradual transitions,\r\nwith physiological fetichism; so that (at least in body-fetichism) it is\r\nalmost impossible to sharply define the beginning of the perversion.\r\nMoreover, the whole field of body-fetichism does not really extend\r\nbeyond the limits of things which normally stimulate the sexual\r\ninstinct. Here the abnormality consists only in the fact that the whole\r\nsexual interest is concentrated on the impression made by a part of the\r\nperson of the opposite sex, so that all other impressions fade and\r\nbecome more or less indifferent. Therefore, the body-fetichist is not to\r\nbe regarded as a _monstrum per excessum_, like the sadist or masochist,\r\nbut rather as a _monstrum per defectum_. What stimulates him is not\r\nabnormal, but rather what does not affect him,—the limitation of sexual\r\ninterest that has taken place in him. Of course, this limited sexual\r\ninterest, within its narrower limits, is usually expressed with a\r\ncorrespondingly greater and abnormal intensity.\r\n\r\nIt would seem reasonable to assume, as the distinguishing mark of\r\npathological fetichism, the necessity for the presence of the fetich as\r\na _conditio sine qua non_ for the possibility of performance of coitus.\r\nBut when the facts are more carefully studied, it is seen that this\r\nlimitation is really only indefinite. There are numerous cases in which,\r\neven in the absence of the fetich, coitus is possible, but it is\r\nincomplete and forced (often with the help of fancies relating to the\r\nfetich), and particularly unsatisfying and exhausting; and, too, closer\r\nstudy of the distinctive subjective psychical conditions in these cases\r\nshows that there are transitional states, passing, on the one hand, to\r\nmere physiological preferences, and, on the other, to psychical\r\nimpotence in the absence of the fetich. It is therefore better, perhaps,\r\nto seek the pathological criterion of body-fetichism in purely\r\nsubjective psychical states. The concentration of the sexual interest on\r\na certain portion of the body that has no direct relation to sex (as\r\nhave the mammæ and external genitals)—a peculiarity to be\r\nemphasized—often leads body-fetichists to such a condition that they do\r\nnot regard coitus as the real means of sexual gratification, but rather\r\nsome form of manipulation of that portion of the body that is effectual\r\nas a fetich. This perverse instinct of body-fetichists may be taken as\r\nthe pathological criterion, no matter whether actual coitus is also\r\npossible or not.\r\n\r\nFetichism of inanimate objects or articles of dress, however, in all\r\ncases, may well be regarded as a pathological phenomenon; since its\r\nobjects fall without the circle of normal sexual stimuli. But even here,\r\nin the phenomena, there is a certain outward correspondence with\r\nprocesses of the normal psychical vita sexualis; the inner connection\r\nand meaning of pathological fetichism, however, are entirely different.\r\nIn the ecstatic love of a man mentally normal, a handkerchief or shoe, a\r\nglove or letter, the flower “she gave,” or a lock of hair, etc., may\r\nbecome the object of worship, but only because they represent a mnemonic\r\nsymbol of the beloved person—absent or dead—whose whole personality is\r\nreproduced by them. The pathological fetichist has no such relations.\r\nThe fetich constitutes the entire content of his idea. When he is\r\npossessed by it, sexual excitement occurs, and the fetich makes itself\r\nfelt.[87]\r\n\r\nAccording to all observations thus far made, pathological fetichism\r\nseems to arise only on the basis of a psychopathic constitution that is\r\nfor the most part hereditary, or on the basis of existent mental\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThus it happens that it not infrequently appears combined with the other\r\n(original) sexual perversions that arise on the same basis. Not\r\ninfrequently fetichism occurs in the most various forms in combination\r\nwith contrary sexuality, sadism, and masochism. Indeed, certain forms of\r\nbody-fetichism (hand- and foot-fetichism) probably have a more or less\r\ndistinct connection with the latter two perversions (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\nBut if fetichism also rests upon a congenital general psychopathic\r\ndisposition, yet this perversion is not, like those previously\r\nconsidered, essentially of an original nature; it is not congenitally\r\nperfect, as we may well assume sadism and masochism to be. While in the\r\nsexual perversions thus far described we have met only cases of a\r\ncongenital nature, here we meet only _acquired_ cases. Aside from the\r\nfact that in fetichism the causative circumstance of its acquirement is\r\noften demonstrable, here the physiological conditions are wanting, which\r\nin sadism and masochism, by means of sexual hyperæsthesia, are\r\nintensified to perversions, and justify the assumption of congenital\r\norigin. In fetichism, every case requires an event which affords the\r\nsubject of perversion. As has been said, it is, of course, physiological\r\nin sexual life to be partial to one or another of woman’s peculiarities,\r\nand to be enthusiastic about it; but concentration of the entire sexual\r\ninterest on such partial impressions is here the essential thing; and\r\nfor this concentration there must be a particular reason in every\r\nindividual affected. Therefore, we may accept Binet’s conclusion that\r\n_in the life of every fetichist there may be assumed to have been some\r\nevent which determined the association of lustful feeling with the\r\nsingle impression_. This event is to be referred to the time of early\r\nyouth, and, as a rule, occurs in connection with the first awakening of\r\nthe vita sexualis. This first awakening is associated with some partial\r\nsexual impression (since it is always something standing in some\r\nrelation to woman), and stamps it for life as the principal object of\r\nsexual interest. The circumstances under which the association arises\r\nare usually forgotten. It is only the result of the association that is\r\nretained. The general predisposition to psychopathic states and the\r\nsexual hyperæsthesia of such individuals are all that is original\r\nhere.[88]\r\n\r\nLike the other perversions thus far considered, erotic (pathological)\r\nfetichism may also express itself in strange, unnatural, and even\r\ncriminal acts: gratification with the female person _loco indebito_,\r\ntheft and robbery of objects of fetichism, pollution of such objects,\r\netc. Here, too, it only depends upon the intensity of the perverse\r\nimpulse and the relative power of opposing ethical motives, whether and\r\nto what extent such acts are performed. These perverse acts of\r\nfetichists, like those of other sexually perverse individuals, may\r\neither alone constitute the entire external vita sexualis, or occur\r\ntogether with the normal sexual act. This depends upon the condition of\r\nphysical and psychical sexual power, and the degree of excitability to\r\nnormal stimuli that has been retained. Where excitability is diminished,\r\nnot infrequently the sight or touch of the fetich serves as a necessary\r\npreparatory act.\r\n\r\nThe great practical importance which attaches to the facts of fetichism,\r\nin accordance with what has been said, lies in two factors. First,\r\npathological fetichism is not infrequently a cause of _psychical\r\nimpotence_.[89] Since the object upon which the sexual interest of the\r\nfetichist is concentrated stands, in itself, in no immediate relation to\r\nthe normal sexual act, it often happens that the fetichist diminishes\r\nhis excitability to normal stimuli by his perversion, or, at least is\r\ncapable of coitus only by means of concentration of his fancy upon his\r\nfetich. In this perversion, and in the difficulty of its adequate\r\nsatisfaction, just as in the other perversions of the sexual instinct,\r\nlie conditions favoring psychical and physical onanism, which again\r\nreacts deleteriously on the constitution and sexual power. This is\r\nespecially true in the case of youthful individuals, and particularly in\r\nthe case of those who, on account of opposing ethical and æsthetic\r\nmotives, shrink from the realization of their perverse desires.\r\nSecondly, fetichism is of great forensic importance. Just as sadism may\r\nextend to murder and the infliction of bodily injury, fetichism may lead\r\nto theft and even to robbery for the possession of the desired articles.\r\n\r\nErotic fetichism has for its object either a certain portion of the body\r\nof a person of the opposite sex, or a certain article or material of\r\nwearing-apparel of the opposite sex. (Only cases of pathological\r\nfetichism in men have thus far been observed, and therefore only\r\nportions of the female person and attire are spoken of here.) In\r\naccordance with this, fetichists fall into three groups.\r\n\r\n(a) _The Fetich is a Part of the Female Body._—Just as, in physiological\r\nfetichism, the eyes, the hand, the foot, and the hair of woman very\r\nfrequently become fetiches, so, in the pathological domain, the same\r\nportions of the body become the sole objects of sexual interest. This\r\nexclusive concentration of interest on these parts, by the side of which\r\neverything else feminine fades, and all other sexual value of woman may\r\nsink to _nil_, so that, instead of coitus, strange manipulations of the\r\nfetich become the object of desire,—this it is that makes these cases\r\npathological.\r\n\r\n  Case 74. (Binet, _op. cit._) X., aged 34, teacher in a Gymnasium. In\r\n  childhood he suffered with convulsions. At the age of ten he began to\r\n  masturbate, with lustful feelings, which were connected with very\r\n  strange ideas. He was particularly partial to women’s eyes; but since\r\n  he wished to imagine some form of coitus, and was absolutely innocent\r\n  in sexual matters, to avoid too great a separation from the eyes, he\r\n  evolved the idea of making the nostrils the seat of the female sexual\r\n  organs. Then his lively sexual desires were connected with this idea.\r\n  He sketched drawings representing correct Greek profiles of female\r\n  heads, but the nostrils were so large that immissio penis would have\r\n  been possible.\r\n\r\n  One day, in an omnibus, he saw a girl in whom he thought he recognized\r\n  his ideal. He followed her to her home and immediately proposed to\r\n  her. Shown the door, he returned again and again, until arrested. X.\r\n  never had sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nHand-fetichists are very numerous. The following case is not really\r\npathological. It is given here as a transitional case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 75. B., of neuropathic family, very sensual, mentally intact. At\r\n  the sight of the hand of a beautiful young lady he is always charmed\r\n  and feels sexual excitement to the extent of ejaculation. It is his\r\n  delight to kiss and press such hands. As long as they are covered with\r\n  gloves he feels unhappy. By pretexts he tries to get hold of such\r\n  hands. He is indifferent to the foot. If the beautiful hands are\r\n  ornamented with rings, his lust is increased. Only the living hand,\r\n  not its image, causes him this lustful excitement. It is only when he\r\n  is exhausted sexually by frequent coitus that the hand loses its\r\n  sexual charm. At first the memory-picture of female hands disturbed\r\n  him even while at work. (Binet, _op. cit._)\r\n\r\nBinet states that such cases of enthusiasm for the female hand are\r\nnumerous. Here it may be recalled that, according to Case 24, a man may\r\nbe partial to the female hand as a result of sadistic impulses; and\r\nthat, according to Case 46, the same thing may be due to masochistic\r\ndesires. Thus such cases have more than one meaning. But this is by no\r\nmeans to say that all, or even a majority, of the cases of\r\nhand-fetichism allow or require a sadistic or masochistic explanation.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting case, that has been studied in detail, shows\r\nthat, in spite of the fact that at first a sadistic or masochistic\r\nelement seems to have exercised an influence, at the time of the\r\nindividual’s maturity and the complete development of the perversion,\r\nthe latter contained nothing of these elements. Of course, it is\r\npossible that, in the course of time, these disappeared; but here the\r\nassumption of the origin of the fetichism in an accidental association\r\nmeets every requirement:—\r\n\r\n  Case 76. A case of _hand-fetichism_, communicated by Albert Moll. P.\r\n  L., aged 28, a merchant of Westphalia. Aside from the fact that the\r\n  patient’s father was remarkably moody and somewhat quick-tempered,\r\n  nothing of an hereditary nature could be proved in the family. At\r\n  school the patient was not very diligent; he was never able to\r\n  concentrate his attention on any one subject for any length of time;\r\n  on the other hand, from childhood he had a great inclination for\r\n  music. His temperament was always nervous.\r\n\r\n  In August, 1890, he came to me complaining of headache and abdominal\r\n  pain, which in every way gave the impression of being neurasthenic.\r\n  The patient also said he was destitute of energy. Only after\r\n  accurately directed questions did the patient make the following\r\n  statements concerning his sexual life. As far as he could remember,\r\n  the beginnings of sexual excitement occurred in his seventh year.\r\n  Whenever he saw a boy of his own age urinate and caught sight of his\r\n  genitals, he became lustfully excited. L. states with certainty that\r\n  this excitement was associated with very evident erections. Led astray\r\n  by another boy, L. learned to masturbate at the age of seven or eight.\r\n  “Being of a very excitable nature,” said L., “I practiced masturbation\r\n  very frequently until my eighteenth year, without gaining any clear\r\n  idea of the evil results or the meaning of the practice.” He was\r\n  particularly fond of practicing mutual onanism with some of his\r\n  school-friends, but it was by no means an indifferent matter who the\r\n  other boy was; on the contrary, only a few of his companions could\r\n  satisfy him in this respect. To the question as to what particularly\r\n  caused him to prefer this or that boy, L. replied that a _white,\r\n  beautifully-formed hand_ in his school-fellows impelled him to\r\n  practice mutual onanism with them. L. further remembered that\r\n  frequently, at the beginning of the gymnastic lesson, he would\r\n  exercise by himself on a bar standing apart. He did this for the\r\n  purpose of exciting himself as much as possible; and he was so\r\n  successful that, without using his hand and without ejaculation,—L.\r\n  was still too young,—he had lustful pleasure. Another early event\r\n  which L. remembers is interesting. One day his favorite companion, N.,\r\n  who practiced mutual onanism with him, proposed that L. should try to\r\n  get hold of his (N.’s) penis, and he would do all he could to prevent\r\n  it. L. acquiesced. In this way the onanism way directly combined with\r\n  a struggle between both parties, in which N. was always overcome. The\r\n  struggle always finally ended in N.’s being compelled to allow L. to\r\n  practice onanism on him. L. assured me that this kind of masturbation\r\n  had given him, as well as N., especial pleasure.[90] In this way L.\r\n  continued to practice masturbation very frequently until his\r\n  eighteenth year. Warned by a friend, he then began to struggle with\r\n  all his might against his evil habit. He became more and more\r\n  successful, and finally, after the first performance of coitus, he\r\n  stopped the practice of onanism entirely. But this was only\r\n  accomplished in his twenty-second year. It now seems incomprehensible\r\n  to the patient—and he says he is filled with disgust at the thought of\r\n  it—how he could ever have found pleasure in performing masturbation\r\n  with other boys. Now, nothing could induce him to touch another man’s\r\n  genitals, the sight of which is even unpleasant to him. He has lost\r\n  all inclination for men, and feels attracted by women exclusively.\r\n\r\n  It must be mentioned, however, that, though L. has a decided\r\n  inclination for the female sex, he presents an abnormal phenomenon.\r\n\r\n  The essential thing in woman that excites him is the sight of her\r\n  beautiful hands; L. is by far more impressed when he touches a\r\n  beautiful female hand than he would be were he to see its possessor in\r\n  a state of complete nudity. The extent to which L.’s preference for\r\n  beautiful female hands goes is shown by the following incident:—\r\n\r\n  L. knew a beautiful young lady possessed of every charm, but her hands\r\n  were quite large and not beautifully formed, and often they were not\r\n  as clean as L. could wish. For this reason it was not only impossible\r\n  for L. to conceive a deeper interest in the lady, but he was not able\r\n  even to touch her. L. believes that there is nothing more disgusting\r\n  to him than dirty finger-nails; this alone would make it impossible\r\n  for him to touch a woman who in all other respects was most beautiful.\r\n  L. formerly, as a substitute for coitus, had the puella perform\r\n  genital manipulation with her hand until ejaculation took place.\r\n\r\n  To the question as to what there was about a woman’s hand that\r\n  attracted him in particular, whether he saw in it a symbol of power,\r\n  and whether it gave him pleasure to be directly humiliated by a woman,\r\n  the patient answered that only the _beautiful form_ of the hand\r\n  charmed him; that it afforded him no gratification to be humiliated by\r\n  a woman; and that he had never had any thought to regard the hand as\r\n  the symbol or instrument of a woman’s power. The preference for the\r\n  hand is still so great that the patient has greater pleasure when his\r\n  genitals are touched by it than when he performs coitus in vaginam.\r\n  Yet, the patient prefers to perform the latter, because it seems to\r\n  him to be natural, while the former seems abnormal. The touch of a\r\n  beautiful female hand on his body immediately causes him to have\r\n  erection; he thinks that kissing and other contacts do not exert\r\n  nearly so strong an influence. It is only of late years that the\r\n  patient has performed coitus frequently, but it has always been very\r\n  difficult for him to determine to do it. Too, in coitus, he did not\r\n  find the complete satisfaction he sought. However, when he finds\r\n  himself near a woman whom he would like to possess, sometimes, at mere\r\n  sight of her, his sexual excitement becomes so intense that\r\n  ejaculation results. L. says expressly that during this he does not\r\n  intentionally touch or press his genitals; ejaculation under such\r\n  circumstances affords him much more pleasure than he experiences in\r\n  actual coitus.[91]\r\n\r\n  To go back, the patient’s dreams were never about coitus. When he had\r\n  pollutions at night, they were almost always associated with other\r\n  thoughts than those that occur in the normal man. The patient’s dreams\r\n  are of events of his school-days. During his school-days, besides the\r\n  mutual onanism described, he had ejaculations whenever he became\r\n  anxiously excited. When, for example, the teacher dictated an\r\n  extemporaneous exercise, and L. was unable to follow in translation,\r\n  ejaculation often occurred.[92] The pollutions that now occur\r\n  occasionally, at night, are only accompanied by dreams that have the\r\n  same or a similar subject,—the events at school just mentioned. On\r\n  account of his unnatural feeling and sensibility, the patient thinks\r\n  he is incapable of loving a woman long.\r\n\r\n  Treatment of the patient’s perversion has not yet been possible.\r\n\r\nThis case of hand-fetichism certainly does not depend on masochism or\r\nsadism, but is to be explained simply by early indulgence in mutual\r\nonanism. There is here, also, quite as little of contrary sexual\r\ninstinct. Before the sexual appetite was clearly conscious of its\r\nobject, the hands of school-fellows were used. As soon as the instinct\r\nfor the opposite sex became evident, the interest for the hand was\r\ntransferred to woman.\r\n\r\nIn hand-fetichists, who, according to Binet, are so numerous, it is\r\npossible that other associations lead to the same result.\r\n\r\nNext to the hand-fetichists, naturally come the foot-fetichists. While\r\nglove-fetichism, which belongs to the next group of object-fetichism,\r\nseldom takes the place of hand-fetichism, we find shoe- and\r\nboot-fetichism, of which there are innumerable cases occurring\r\neverywhere, taking the place of enthusiasm for the naked female foot.\r\nThere are only here and there traces of the latter enthusiasm, and these\r\nare scarcely pathological. It is easy to see the reason for this. The\r\nfemale hand is usually seen uncovered; the foot, covered. Thus the early\r\nassociations which determine the direction of the vita sexualis are\r\nnaturally connected with the naked hand, but with the covered foot.\r\n\r\nShoe-fetichism also finds its place in the following group of\r\ndress-fetichism; however, on account of its demonstrable masochistic\r\ncharacter in the majority of cases, it has been, for the most part,\r\ndescribed already (p. 123 _et seq._).\r\n\r\nBesides the eyes, hand, and foot, the mouth and ears often play the\r\n_rôle_ of a fetich. Among others, Moll (_op. cit._) mentions such cases.\r\n(Comp. also Belot’s romance, “La Bouche de Madame X.,” which, B. states,\r\nrests upon actual observation.)\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable case came under my personal observation:—\r\n\r\n  Case 77. A gentleman of very bad heredity consulted me concerning\r\n  impotence that was driving him almost to despair. While he was young,\r\n  his fetich was women of plump form. He married such a lady, and was\r\n  happy and potent with her. After a few months the lady fell very ill,\r\n  and lost much flesh. When, one day, he tried to resume his marital\r\n  duty, he was absolutely impotent, and remained so. If, however, he\r\n  attempted coitus with plump women, he was perfectly potent.\r\n\r\nEven bodily defects may become fetiches.\r\n\r\n  Descartes, who himself (“Traité des Passions,” cxxxvi) expresses some\r\n  opinions concerning the origin of peculiar affections in associations\r\n  of ideas, was always partial to cross-eyed women, because the object\r\n  of his first love had such a defect. (Binet, _op. cit._)\r\n\r\n  Lydston (“A Lecture on Sexual Perversion,” Chicago, 1890[93]) reports\r\n  the case of a man who had a love-affair with a woman whose right lower\r\n  extremity had been amputated. After separation from her, he searched\r\n  for other women with a like defect.[94]—A negative fetich.\r\n\r\nWhen the part of the female body forming the fetich is capable of\r\nremoval, like the hair, the most extravagant acts may be\r\nperformed. Therefore, hair-fetichists form an interesting and\r\nforensically-important category. While such admirers of female hair are\r\nprobably not infrequent within physiological limits, and possibly\r\nvarious senses (sight, smell, and hearing, through crepitant sounds,—and\r\ncertainly touch, just as with velvet- and silk-fetichists, _v. infra_)\r\nare thus excited with an accompaniment of lustful feeling; yet, a series\r\nof similar pathological cases has also been observed, in which the\r\nhair-fetichism had become an overpowering impulse, and driven the\r\nindividuals to commit crimes.[95],[96] These form the group of\r\nhair-despoilers.\r\n\r\n  Case 78. _A hair-despoiler._ P., aged 40, artistic locksmith, single.\r\n  His father was temporarily insane, and his mother was very nervous. He\r\n  developed well, and was intelligent; but he was early affected with\r\n  _tics_ and imperative ideas. He had never masturbated. He loved\r\n  platonically, and often busied himself with matrimonial plans. He had\r\n  coitus infrequently with prostitutes, but never felt satisfied with\r\n  such intercourse—rather, disgusted. Three years ago he was overtaken\r\n  by misfortune (financial ruin), and, besides, he had a febrile\r\n  disease, with delirium. These things had a very bad effect on his\r\n  hereditarily-predisposed nervous system. On August 28, 1889, P. was\r\n  arrested at the Trocadero, in Paris, _in flagranti_, as he forcibly\r\n  cut off a young girl’s hair. He was arrested with the hair in his hand\r\n  and a pair of shears in his pocket. He excused himself on the ground\r\n  of momentary mental confusion and an unfortunate, irresistible\r\n  passion; he confessed that he had ten times cut off hair, which he\r\n  took great delight in keeping at home. On searching his home,\r\n  sixty-five switches and tresses of hair were found, assorted in\r\n  packets. P. had already been once arrested, on December 15, 1886,\r\n  under similar circumstances, but was released for lack of evidence.\r\n\r\n  P. states that, for the last three years, when he is alone in his room\r\n  at night, he feels ill, anxious, excited, and dizzy, and then is\r\n  troubled by the impulse to touch female hair. When it happened that he\r\n  could actually take a young girl’s hair in his hand, he felt intensely\r\n  excited sexually, and had erection and ejaculation without touching\r\n  the girl in any other way. On reaching home, he would feel ashamed of\r\n  what had taken place; but the wish to possess hair, always accompanied\r\n  by great sensual pleasure, became more and more powerful in him. He\r\n  wondered that previously, even in the most intimate intercourse with\r\n  women, he had experienced no such feeling. One evening he could not\r\n  resist the impulse to cut off a girl’s hair. With the hair in his\r\n  hand, at home, the sensual process was repeated. He was forced to rub\r\n  his body with the hair and envelop his genitals in it. Finally, quite\r\n  exhausted, he grew ashamed, and could not trust himself to go out for\r\n  several days. After months of rest he was again impelled to possess\r\n  himself of female hair, indifferent as to whose it might be. If he\r\n  attained his end, he felt himself possessed by a supernatural power\r\n  and unable to give up his booty. If he could not attain the object of\r\n  his desire, he became greatly depressed, hurried home, and there\r\n  reveled in his collection of hair. He combed and fondled it, and thus\r\n  had intense orgasm, satisfying himself by masturbation. Hair exposed\r\n  in the cases of hair-dressers made no impression on him; it required\r\n  hair hanging down from a female head.\r\n\r\n  At the height of his act, he states, he is in such a state of\r\n  excitement that he has only imperfect apperception and subsequent\r\n  memory of what he does. When he touches the hair with the shears he\r\n  has erection, and, at the instant of cutting it off, ejaculation.\r\n  Since his misfortune, about three years ago, he states that he has had\r\n  weakness of memory, is easily exhausted mentally, and has been\r\n  troubled by sleeplessness and night-terrors. P. deeply regrets his\r\n  crime.\r\n\r\n  Not only hair, but a number of hair-pins, ribbons, and other articles\r\n  of the feminine toilet, were found in his possession, which he had had\r\n  presented to him. He had always had an actual mania for collecting\r\n  such things, as well as newspapers, pieces of wood, and other\r\n  worthless trash, which he would never give up. He also had a strange\r\n  and, to him, inexplicable fear of passing a certain street; if he ever\r\n  tried it, it made him ill.\r\n\r\n  The opinion (medico-legal) showed him to be hereditarily predisposed,\r\n  and proved the imperative, impulsive, and decidedly involuntary\r\n  character of the criminal acts, which had the significance of an\r\n  imperative act, induced by an imperative idea, with an accompaniment\r\n  of overpowering abnormal sexual feeling. Pardon; asylum for insane.\r\n  (Voisin, Socquet, Motet, _Annales d’hygiène_, April, 1890.)\r\n\r\nFollowing this case, is a similar one which also deserves attention; for\r\nit has been well studied, and may be called almost classical; and, too,\r\nit places the fetich, as well as the original associative awakening of\r\nthe idea, in a clear light:—\r\n\r\n  Case 79. _A hair-despoiler._ E., aged 25. Maternal aunt, epileptic;\r\n  brother had convulsions. E. says he was fairly healthy as a child, and\r\n  learned quite easily. At the age of fifteen he had a sensual feeling\r\n  of pleasure, with erection, at the sight of one of the village\r\n  beauties combing her hair. Until that time persons of the opposite sex\r\n  had made no impression on him. Two months later, in Paris, the sight\r\n  of young girls with their hair flowing down over their shoulders\r\n  always excited him intensely. One day he could not resist an\r\n  opportunity to twist a young girl’s hair in his fingers. For this he\r\n  was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for three months. After\r\n  that he served five years as a soldier. During this time hair was not\r\n  dangerous for him, though also not very accessible; but he dreamed\r\n  sometimes of female heads with the hair braided or flowing. Occasional\r\n  coitus with women, but without having their hair effective as a\r\n  fetich. Once more in Paris, he again dreamed as before, and became\r\n  greatly excited by female hair. He never dreamed about the whole form\r\n  of a woman, only of heads with braids of hair. His sexual excitement\r\n  due to this fetich had become so intense of late that he had resorted\r\n  to masturbation. The idea of touching female hair, or, better, of\r\n  possessing it to masturbate while handling it, grew more and more\r\n  powerful. Of late, when he had female hair in his fingers, ejaculation\r\n  was induced. One day he succeeded in cutting hair, about 25\r\n  centimetres long, from three little girls in the street, and keeping\r\n  it in his possession, when he was arrested in a fourth attempt. Deep\r\n  regret and shame. He was not sentenced. Since spending some time in\r\n  the asylum, he has so far improved that female hair no longer excites\r\n  him. Set at liberty, he thought of going to his native place, where\r\n  the women wear their hair done up. (Magnan, _Archiv. de l’anthropol.\r\n  criminelle_, v, Nr. 28.)\r\n\r\nA third case is the following, which is likewise suited to illustrate\r\nthe psychopathic nature of such phenomena; and the remarkable means\r\nwhich induced a cure are worthy of note:—\r\n\r\n  Case 80. _Hair-fetichism._ Mr. X., between thirty and forty years old;\r\n  from the higher class of society; single. He says that he comes of a\r\n  healthy family, but from childhood has been nervous, vacillating, and\r\n  peculiar; that since his eighth year he has been powerfully attracted\r\n  by female hair. This was particularly true in the case of young girls.\r\n  When he was nine years old, a girl of thirteen seduced him. He did not\r\n  understand it, and was not at all excited. A twelve-year-old sister of\r\n  this girl also courted, kissed, and hugged him. He allowed this\r\n  quietly, because this girl’s hair pleased him so well. When about ten\r\n  years old, he began to have sensual feelings at the sight of female\r\n  hair that pleased him. Gradually these feelings occurred\r\n  spontaneously, and memory-pictures of girls’ hair were always\r\n  immediately associated with them. At the age of eleven he was taught\r\n  to masturbate by school-mates. The associative connection of sexual\r\n  feelings and a fetichistic idea was already established, and always\r\n  appeared when the patient indulged in evil practices with his\r\n  companions. With advancing years, the fetich grew more and more\r\n  powerful. Even false hair began to excite him, but he always preferred\r\n  natural hair. When he could touch or kiss it, he was perfectly happy.\r\n  He wrote essays and poems on the beauty of female hair; he sketched\r\n  heads of hair and masturbated. After his fourteenth year he became so\r\n  powerfully excited by his fetich that he had violent erections. In\r\n  contrast with his early taste while a boy, he was now charmed only by\r\n  luxuriant, thick black hair. He experienced intense desire to kiss\r\n  such hair, particularly to suck it. To touch such hair afforded him\r\n  but little satisfaction; he obtained much more pleasure in looking at\r\n  it, but particularly in kissing and sucking it. If this were\r\n  impossible, he would become unhappy, even to the extent of tædium\r\n  vitæ. Then he would attempt to relieve himself, imagining fantastic\r\n  “hair-adventures” and masturbating. Not infrequently, in the street\r\n  and in crowds, he could not keep from imprinting a kiss on ladies’\r\n  heads. He would then hurry home to masturbate. Sometimes he could\r\n  resist this impulse; but it was then necessary for him, filled with\r\n  feelings of fear, to run away as quickly as possible, in order to\r\n  escape the domination of his fetich. He was only once impelled to cut\r\n  off a girl’s hair in a crowd. In the act he was seized with fear, and\r\n  was not successful with his pocket-knife; and, by flight, he narrowly\r\n  escaped detection.\r\n\r\n  When he became mature, he attempted to satisfy himself in coitus with\r\n  puellis. He induced powerful erection by kissing the hair, but could\r\n  not induce ejaculation. Therefore, he was unsatisfied by coitus. At\r\n  the same time, his favorite idea was coitus with kissing of hair; but\r\n  even this did not satisfy him, because it did not induce ejaculation.\r\n  _Faute de mieux_, he once stole the combings of a lady’s hair, put it\r\n  in his mouth, and masturbated while calling its owner up in\r\n  imagination. In the dark a woman could not interest him, because he\r\n  could not then see her hair. Flowing hair also had no charm for him;\r\n  nor did the hair about the genitals. His erotic dreams were all about\r\n  hair. Of late the patient had become so excited that he had a kind of\r\n  satyriasis. He was incapable of business, and felt so unhappy that he\r\n  sought to drown his sorrow in alcohol. He drank large quantities, had\r\n  alcoholic delirium, an attack of alcoholic epilepsy, and required\r\n  hospital treatment. After the intoxication had passed away, under\r\n  appropriate treatment, the sexual excitement soon disappeared; and\r\n  when the patient was discharged, he was freed from his fetichistic\r\n  idea, save for its occasional occurrence in dreams. The physical\r\n  examination showed normal genitals and no degenerative signs whatever.\r\n\r\nSuch cases of hair-fetichism, which lead to attacks on female hair, seem\r\nto occur everywhere, from time to time. In November, 1890, according to\r\nreports in American newspapers, several cities in the United States were\r\ntroubled by such hair-despoilers.\r\n\r\n(b) _The Fetich is an Article of Female Attire._—The great importance of\r\nadornment, ornament, and dress, in the normal vita sexualis of man, is\r\nvery generally recognized. Culture and fashion[97] have, to a certain\r\nextent, endowed woman with artificial sexual characteristics, the\r\nremoval of which, when woman is seen unattired, in spite of the normal\r\nsensual effect of this sight, may exert an opposite influence.[98] It\r\nshould not be overlooked that female dress often shows a tendency to\r\nemphasize and exaggerate certain sexual peculiarities,—secondary sexual\r\ncharacteristics (bosom, waist, hips). In most individuals the sexual\r\ninstinct awakes long before there is any possibility or opportunity of\r\nintimate intercourse, and the early desires of youth are concerned with\r\nthe ordinary appearance of the attired female form. Thus it happens that\r\nnot infrequently, at the beginning of the vita sexualis, ideas of the\r\npersons exerting sexual charms and ideas of their attire become\r\nassociated. This association may be lasting—the attired woman may be\r\nalways preferred—if the individuals dominated by this perversion do not\r\nin other respects attain to a normal vita sexualis, and find\r\ngratification in natural charms.\r\n\r\nIn psychopathic individuals, sexually hyperæsthetic, as a result of\r\nthis, it actually happens that the dressed woman is always preferred to\r\nthe nude female form. It may be recalled that in Case 48 the woman was\r\nnot to take off a garment, and that in Case 51, _equus eroticus_, the\r\nwoman was preferred dressed. In Case 89, of the sixth edition,—that of a\r\nman manifesting contrary sexuality,—the same preference is expressed.\r\n\r\nDr. Moll (_op. cit._) mentions a patient who could not perform coitus\r\nwith puella nuda; the woman had to have on a chemise, at least. The same\r\nauthor (_op. cit._, p. 129) mentions a man affected with contrary\r\nsexuality, who was subject to the same dress-fetichism.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this phenomenon is apparently to be found in the mental\r\nonanism of such individuals. In seeing innumerable clothed forms, they\r\nhave cultivated desires before seeing nudity.[99]\r\n\r\nA more marked form of dress-fetichism is that in which, instead of the\r\ndressed woman, a certain kind of attire becomes a fetich. One can\r\nunderstand how, with an intense and early sexual impression, combined\r\nwith the idea of a particular garment on the woman, in hyperæsthetic\r\nindividuals, a very intense interest in this garment might be developed.\r\n\r\nHammond (_op. cit._) reports the following case, taken from Roubaud\r\n(“Traité de l’impuissance,” Paris):—\r\n\r\n  Case 81. X., son of a general. He was raised in the country. At the\r\n  age of fourteen he was initiated into the joys of love by a young\r\n  lady. This lady was a blonde, and wore her hair in ringlets; and, in\r\n  order to avoid detection in sexual intercourse with her young lover,\r\n  she always wore her usual clothing,—gaiters, a corset, and a silk\r\n  dress.\r\n\r\n  When his studies were completed, and he was sent to a garrison where\r\n  he could enjoy freedom, he found that his sexual desire could be\r\n  excited only under certain conditions. A brunette could not excite him\r\n  in the least, and a woman in night-clothes could stifle every bit of\r\n  love in him. In order to awaken his desire, a woman had to be a\r\n  blonde, and wear gaiters, a corset, and a silk dress,—in short, she\r\n  had to be dressed like the lady who had first awakened his sexual\r\n  desire. He was always compelled to give up thoughts of matrimony,\r\n  because he knew he would be unable to fulfill his marital duty with a\r\n  woman in night-clothes.\r\n\r\n  Hammond reports another case where coitus maritalis could be performed\r\n  only by the help of a certain costume; and Dr. Moll mentions several\r\n  similar cases in individuals of hetero- and homo-sexuality. The cause\r\n  may often be shown to be an early association, and such may always be\r\n  assumed. It is only in this way that one can explain why a certain\r\n  costume cannot be resisted by such individuals, no matter what person\r\n  wears the fetich. Thus one can understand why, as Coffignon (_op.\r\n  cit._) relates, men at brothels demand that the women with whom they\r\n  are concerned put on certain costumes, such as that of a\r\n  ballet-dancer, or nun, etc.; and why these houses are furnished with a\r\n  complete wardrobe for such purposes.\r\n\r\n  Binet (_op. cit._) relates the case of a judge who was exclusively in\r\n  love with Italian girls who came to Paris as artists’ models, and\r\n  their peculiar costume. The cause was here demonstrably an impression\r\n  made at the time of the awakening of the sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nA third form of dress-fetichism, having a much higher degree of\r\npathological significance, is by far the most frequent. In this form it\r\nis no longer the woman herself, dressed, or even dressed in a particular\r\nfashion, that constitutes the principal sexual stimulus, but the sexual\r\ninterest is so concentrated on some certain article of female attire\r\nthat the lustful idea of this object is entirely separated from the idea\r\nof woman, and thus obtains an independent value. This is the real domain\r\nof dress-fetichism, where an inanimate object—an isolated article of\r\nwearing-apparel—is alone used for the excitation and satisfaction of the\r\nsexual instinct. This third form of dress-fetichism is also the one that\r\nis important forensically.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of these cases the fetiches are articles of female\r\nunderwear, which, owing to their private use, are suited to occasion\r\nsuch associations.\r\n\r\n  Case 82. K., aged 45, shoemaker, is reported to be without hereditary\r\n  taint. He is peculiar, and has small mental endowment. He is of\r\n  masculine habitus and without signs of degeneration. Previously\r\n  blameless in conduct, on the evening of July 5, 1876, he was detected\r\n  taking stolen female under-garments from a place of concealment. There\r\n  were found with him about three hundred articles of the female toilet,\r\n  among them, besides chemises and drawers, night-caps, garters, and a\r\n  female doll. When arrested he was wearing a chemise. Since his\r\n  thirteenth year he had been a slave to an impulse to steal women’s\r\n  linen; but, after his first punishment for it, he had become very\r\n  careful, and stolen with refinement and success. When this longing\r\n  came over him, he would grow anxious, and his head would become heavy.\r\n  Then he could not resist the impulse, cost what it might. He was\r\n  indifferent to the source of the articles. At night, on going to bed,\r\n  he would put on the stolen clothing and create beautiful women in\r\n  imagination, thus inducing pleasurable feeling and ejaculation. This\r\n  was apparently the motive of his thefts; at least, he had never\r\n  disposed of any of the articles, but had hidden them here and there.\r\n\r\n  He declared that, earlier in his life, he had indulged in normal\r\n  sexual intercourse with women. He denied onanism, pederasty, and other\r\n  sexual acts. He said he was engaged at twenty-five, but the engagement\r\n  was broken through no fault of his. He was incapable of insight into\r\n  the abnormality of his condition and the wrong of his acts. (Passow,\r\n  _Vierteljahrsschrift f. ger. Medic._, N. F. xxviii, p. 61; Krauss,\r\n  “Psychologie des Verbrechens,” 1884, p. 190.)\r\n\r\nHammond (_op. cit._) reports a case of passionate interest in single\r\narticles of female wearing-apparel. Here, also, the patient’s pleasure\r\nconsisted in wearing a corset and other female garments (without any\r\ntraces of contrary sexual instinct). The pain of tight lacing,\r\nexperienced by himself or induced in women, is a delight to\r\nhim,—sadistic-masochistic element.\r\n\r\nA case probably belonging here is one reported by Diez (“Der\r\nSelbstmord,” 1838, p. 24), where a young man could not resist the\r\nimpulse to tear female linen. While tearing it, he always had\r\nejaculation.\r\n\r\nA combination of fetichism with an impulse to destroy the fetich (in a\r\ncertain sense, sadism with inanimate objects) seems to occur quite\r\nfrequently (comp. Case 93).\r\n\r\nAn article of dress, which, though it has not really a private\r\ncharacter, by its material and color, as well as by the place where it\r\nis worn, recalls under-garments, and hence has sexual relations, is the\r\napron (comp. also the metonymic use of the word “apron” for “petticoat”\r\nin the saying, “To chase every apron,” etc.). This explains the\r\nfollowing case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 83. C., aged 37; of a badly tainted family; of small mental\r\n  endowment; plagiocephalic. At fifteen his attention was attracted by\r\n  aprons hung out to dry. He bound them about himself and masturbated\r\n  behind the fence. From that time he could not see aprons without\r\n  repeating the act. If any one—no matter whether man or woman—with an\r\n  apron on came near him, he was compelled to run after the person. In\r\n  order to free him from this constant stealing of aprons, he was sent\r\n  as a marine in his sixteenth year. In this calling he saw no aprons,\r\n  and had continual rest. When, at nineteen, he returned home, he was\r\n  again compelled to steal aprons, and, as a result, got into serious\r\n  complications, and was several times locked up. He sought to free\r\n  himself of his weakness by a sojourn of several years in a cloister.\r\n  When he came out, he was just as bad as before. As a result of a new\r\n  theft, he underwent a medico-legal examination, and was committed to\r\n  an asylum. He never stole anything but aprons. It was a pleasure to\r\n  him to revel in the memory of the first apron he ever stole. His\r\n  dreams were filled with aprons. He occasionally used the memory of his\r\n  thefts to make coitus possible, or for masturbation. (Charcot and\r\n  Magnan, _Arch. de neurolog._, 1882, Nr. 12.)\r\n\r\n  In a case reported by Lombroso (“Amori anomali precoci nei pazzi,”\r\n  _Arch. di psich._, 1883, p. 17), analogous to those of this series, a\r\n  boy of very bad heredity, at the age of four, had erections and great\r\n  sexual excitement at the sight of white garments, particularly\r\n  underclothing. He was lustfully excited by handling and crumpling\r\n  them. At the age of ten he began to masturbate at the sight of white,\r\n  starched linen. He seems to have been affected with moral insanity,\r\n  and was executed for murder.\r\n\r\nThe following case of petticoat-fetichism is combined with peculiar\r\ncircumstances:—\r\n\r\n  Case 84. Z., aged 35; official; the only child of a nervous mother and\r\n  healthy father. From childhood he was “nervous,” and at the\r\n  consultation his neuropathic eyes, delicate, slender body, fine\r\n  features, very thin voice, and sparse growth of beard attracted\r\n  attention. The patient presents nothing abnormal except symptoms of\r\n  slight neurasthenia. Genitals and sexual functions normal. Patient\r\n  states that he has only masturbated four or five times, and that when\r\n  he was very young. As early as at the age of thirteen, the patient was\r\n  powerfully excited sexually by the sight of wet female dresses; while\r\n  the same dresses, when dry, had no effect upon him. His greatest\r\n  delight was to look at women with wet garments in the rain. If he met\r\n  a woman having a pleasing face under such circumstances, he\r\n  experienced an intense feeling of lustful pleasure, had erection, and\r\n  felt impelled to perform coitus. He states that he has never had any\r\n  desire to wet female dresses or to throw water on women. He can give\r\n  no explanation of the origin of his peculiarity.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that, in this case, the sexual instinct was first\r\n  awakened by the sight of a woman as she exposed her charms by raising\r\n  her skirts in wet weather. The obscure instinct, not yet conscious of\r\n  its object, then became directed to the wet garments, as in other\r\n  cases.\r\n\r\n_Lovers of female handkerchiefs_ are frequent, and, therefore, important\r\nforensically. As to the frequency of handkerchief-fetichism, it may be\r\nremarked that the handkerchief is the one article of feminine attire\r\nwhich, outside of intimate association, is most frequently displayed,\r\nand which, with its warmth from the person and specific odors, may by\r\naccident fall into the hands of others. The frequency of early\r\nassociation of lustful feelings with the idea of a handkerchief, which\r\nmay always be presumed to have occurred in such cases of fetichism,\r\nprobably is due to this.\r\n\r\n  Case 85. A baker’s assistant, aged 32, single, previously of good\r\n  repute, was discovered stealing a handkerchief from a lady. In sincere\r\n  remorse, he confessed that he had stolen from eighty to ninety such\r\n  handkerchiefs. He had cared only for handkerchiefs, and, indeed, only\r\n  for those belonging to young women attractive to him. In his outward\r\n  appearance the culprit presents nothing peculiar. He dresses himself\r\n  with much taste. His conduct is peculiar, anxious, depressed, and\r\n  unmanly, and he often lapses into whining and tears. Lack of\r\n  self-reliance, weakness of comprehension, and slowness of perception\r\n  and reflection, are noticeable. One of his sisters is epileptic. He\r\n  lives in good circumstances; was never severely sick; developed well.\r\n  In relating his history, he shows weakness of memory and lack of\r\n  clearness; calculation is hard for him, though when young he learned\r\n  and comprehended easily. His anxious, uncertain state of mind gives\r\n  rise to a suspicion of onanism. The culprit confessed that he had been\r\n  given to this practice excessively since his nineteenth year. For some\r\n  years, as a result of his vice, he had suffered with depression,\r\n  lassitude, trembling of the limbs, pain in the back, and\r\n  disinclination for work. Frequently a depressed, anxious state of mind\r\n  came over him, in which he avoided people. He had exaggerated,\r\n  fantastic notions about the results of sexual intercourse with women,\r\n  and could not bring himself to indulge in it. Of late, however, he had\r\n  thought of marriage. With great remorse and in a weak-minded way, X.\r\n  now confessed that six months before, while in a crowd, he became\r\n  violently excited sexually at the sight of a pretty young girl, and\r\n  was compelled to crowd up against her. He felt an impulse to\r\n  compensate himself for the want of a more complete satisfaction of his\r\n  sexual excitement, by stealing her handkerchief. Thereafter, as soon\r\n  as he came near attractive females, with violent sexual excitement,\r\n  palpitation of the heart, erection and _impetus coeundi_, the impulse\r\n  would seize him to crowd up against them and, _faute de mieux_, steal\r\n  their handkerchiefs. Although the consciousness of his criminal act\r\n  never left him for a moment, he was unable to make any resistance to\r\n  the impulse. During the act he felt an anxiety which was in part due\r\n  to his inordinate sexual impulse, and partly to the fear of detection.\r\n  The medico-legal opinion rightly gave weight to the congenital mental\r\n  enfeeblement and the pernicious influence of masturbation, and\r\n  referred the abnormal impulses to a perverse sexual impulse, calling\r\n  attention to the presence of an interesting and well-known\r\n  physiological connection between the olfactory and sexual senses. The\r\n  inability to resist the pathological impulse was recognized. X. was\r\n  not punished. (Zippe, _Wiener Med. Wochenschrift_, 1879, Nr. 23.)\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the kindness of Dr. Fritsch, of Vienna, for further\r\nfacts concerning this handkerchief-fetichist, who was again arrested in\r\nAugust, 1890, in the act of taking a handkerchief from a lady’s pocket:—\r\n\r\n  On searching his house, four hundred and forty-six ladies’\r\n  handkerchiefs were found. He stated that he had burned besides two\r\n  bundles of them. In the course of the examination, it was further\r\n  shown that X. had been punished with imprisonment for fourteen days,\r\n  in 1883, for stealing twenty-seven handkerchiefs, and again with\r\n  imprisonment for three weeks, in 1886, for a similar crime. Concerning\r\n  his relatives, nothing more could be learned than that his father was\r\n  subject to congestions, and that a brother’s daughter was weak-minded\r\n  and constitutionally neuropathic. X. had married in 1879, and embarked\r\n  in an independent business, and in 1881 he made an assignment. Soon\r\n  after that, his wife, who could not live with him, and with whom he\r\n  did not perform his marital duty (denied by X.), demanded a divorce.\r\n  Thereafter he lived as assistant baker to his brother. He complained\r\n  bitterly of an impulse for ladies’ handkerchiefs, but when opportunity\r\n  offered, unfortunately, he could not resist it. In the act he\r\n  experienced a feeling of delight, and felt as if some one were forcing\r\n  him to it. Sometimes he could restrain himself, but, when the lady was\r\n  pleasing to him, he yielded to the first impulse. He would be wet with\r\n  sweat, partly from fear of detection, and partly on account of the\r\n  impulse to perform the act. He says he has been sensually excited, by\r\n  the sight of handkerchiefs belonging to women, since puberty. He\r\n  cannot recall the exact circumstances of this fetichistic association.\r\n  The sensual excitement, occasioned by the sight of a lady with a\r\n  handkerchief hanging out of her pocket, had constantly increased. This\r\n  had repeatedly caused erection, but never ejaculation. After his\r\n  twenty-first year, he says, he had inclination to normal sexual\r\n  indulgence, and had coitus without difficulty without ideas of\r\n  handkerchiefs. With increasing fetichism, the appropriation of\r\n  handkerchiefs had afforded him much more satisfaction than coitus. The\r\n  appropriation of the handkerchief of a lady attractive to him was the\r\n  same to him as intercourse with her would have been. In the act he had\r\n  true orgasm.\r\n\r\n  If he could not gain possession of the handkerchief he desired, he\r\n  would become painfully excited, tremble, and sweat all over. He kept\r\n  separate the handkerchiefs of ladies particularly pleasing to him, and\r\n  reveled in the sight of them, taking great pleasure in it. The odor of\r\n  them also gave him great delight, though he states that it was really\r\n  the odor peculiar to the linen, and not the perfume, which excited him\r\n  sensually. He had masturbated but very seldom.\r\n\r\n  X. complained of no physical ailments except occasional headache and\r\n  vertigo. He greatly regretted his misfortune, his abnormal\r\n  impulse,—the evil spirit that impelled him to such criminal acts. He\r\n  had but one wish: that some one might help him. Objectively there are\r\n  mild neurasthenic symptoms, anomalies of the distribution of blood,\r\n  and unequal pupils.\r\n\r\n  It was proved that X. had committed his crimes in obedience to an\r\n  abnormal, irresistible impulse. Pardon.\r\n\r\nSuch cases of handkerchief-fetichism, where an abnormal individual is\r\ndriven to theft, are very numerous. They also occur in combination with\r\ncontrary sexuality, as is proved by the following case, which I borrow\r\nfrom page 125 of Dr. Moll’s frequently-cited work[100]:—\r\n\r\n  Case 86. _Handkerchief-fetichism in a Case of Contrary Sexual\r\n  Instinct._—K., aged 38; mechanic; a powerfully built man. He makes\r\n  numerous complaints,—weakness of the legs, pain in the back, headache,\r\n  want of pleasure in work, etc. The complaints give the decided\r\n  impression of neurasthenia with tendency to hypochondria. Only after\r\n  the patient had been under my treatment several months did he state\r\n  that he was also abnormal sexually.\r\n\r\n  K. had never had any inclination whatever for women; but handsome men,\r\n  on the other hand, had a peculiar charm for him. Patient had\r\n  masturbated frequently until he came to me. He had never practiced\r\n  mutual onanism or pederasty. He did not think that he would have found\r\n  satisfaction in this, because, in spite of his preference for men, an\r\n  article of white linen was his chief charm, though the beauty of its\r\n  owner played a _rôle_. The handkerchiefs of handsome men particularly\r\n  excite him sexually. His greatest delight is to masturbate in men’s\r\n  handkerchiefs. For this reason he often took his friend’s\r\n  handkerchiefs. In order to save himself from detection, he always left\r\n  one of his own handkerchiefs with his friend in place of the one he\r\n  stole. In this way he sought to escape the suspicion of theft, by\r\n  creating the appearance of a mistake. Other articles of men’s linen\r\n  also excited K. sexually, but not to the extent handkerchiefs did.\r\n\r\n  K. had often performed coitus with women, having erection and\r\n  ejaculation, but without lustful pleasure. There was also nothing\r\n  which could stimulate the patient to the performance of coitus.\r\n  Erection and ejaculation occurred only when, during the act, he\r\n  thought of a man’s handkerchief; and this was easier for the patient\r\n  when he took a friend’s handkerchief with him, and had it in his hand\r\n  during coitus. In accordance with his sexual perversion, in his\r\n  nightly pollutions with lustful ideas, men’s linen played the\r\n  principal _rôle_.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that, in this interest in (used) handkerchiefs, elements\r\nof feeling in the sense of masochism, group “_c_,” are also often at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nStill far more frequent than the fetichism of linen garments is that of\r\nwomen’s shoes. These cases are, in fact, almost innumerable, and a great\r\nmany of them have been scientifically studied; but I have but a few\r\nreports at second hand of the similar glove-fetichism (concerning the\r\nreason for the relative infrequency of glove-fetichism, _vide_ p. 161).\r\n\r\nIn shoe-fetichism the close relationship of the object to the feminine\r\nperson, which explains linen-fetichism, is absolutely wanting. For this\r\nreason, and because there is a large number of well-observed cases at\r\nhand, in which the fetichistic enthusiasm for the female shoe or boot\r\nconsciously and undoubtedly arises from masochistic ideas, an origin of\r\na masochistic nature, even when it is concealed, may always be assumed\r\nin shoe-fetichism, when, in the concrete case, no other manner of origin\r\nis demonstrable. For this reason the majority of the cases of shoe- or\r\nfoot-fetichism have been given under “Masochism.” There the constant\r\nmasochistic character of this form of erotic fetichism has been\r\nsufficiently demonstrated by means of transitional conditions. This\r\npresumption of the masochistic character of shoe-fetichism is weakened\r\nand removed only where another accidental cause for an association\r\nbetween sexual excitation and the idea of women’s shoes—the occurrence\r\nof which is quite improbable _a priori_—is demonstrable. In the two\r\nfollowing cases, however, there is such a demonstrable connection:—\r\n\r\n  Case 87. _Shoe-fetichism._ Mr. v. P., of an old and honorable family,\r\n  Pole, aged 32, consulted me, in 1890, on account of “unnaturalness” of\r\n  his vita sexualis. He gave the assurance that he came of a perfectly\r\n  healthy family. He had been nervous from childhood, and had suffered\r\n  with chorea minor at the age of eleven. For ten years he had suffered\r\n  with sleeplessness and various neurasthenic ailments. From his\r\n  fifteenth year he had recognized the difference of the sexes and been\r\n  capable of sexual excitation. At the age of seventeen he had been\r\n  seduced by a French governess, but coitus was not permitted; so that\r\n  intense mutual sensual excitement (mutual masturbation) was all that\r\n  was possible. In this situation his attention was attracted by her\r\n  very elegant boots. They made a very deep impression. His intercourse\r\n  with this lewd person lasted four months. During this association her\r\n  shoes became a fetich for the unfortunate boy. He began to have an\r\n  interest in ladies’ shoes in general, and actually went about trying\r\n  to catch sight of ladies wearing pretty boots. The shoe-fetichism\r\n  gained great power over his mind. He had the governess touch his penis\r\n  with her shoes, and thus ejaculation with great lustful feeling was\r\n  immediately induced. After separation from the governess, he went to\r\n  puellis, whom he had perform the same manipulation. This was usually\r\n  sufficient for satisfaction. Only seldom did he resort to coitus as an\r\n  auxiliary, and inclination for it grew less and less. His vita\r\n  sexualis consisted of dream-pollutions, in which women’s shoes played\r\n  the exclusive _rôle_; and of gratification with women’s shoes apposita\r\n  ad mentulam, but this had to be done by the puella. In the society of\r\n  the opposite sex the only thing that interested him was the shoe, and\r\n  that only when it was elegant, of the French style, with heels, and of\r\n  a brilliant black, like the original.\r\n\r\n  In the course of time the following conditions have become accessory:\r\n  A prostitute’s shoe that is elegant and _chic_; starched petticoats,\r\n  and black hose, if possible. Nothing else in woman interests him. _He\r\n  is absolutely indifferent to the naked foot._ Women have not the\r\n  slightest mental charm for him. He had never had masochistic desires,\r\n  in the sense of being trod upon. In the course of years his fetichism\r\n  had gained such power that when he saw a lady on the street, of a\r\n  certain appearance and with certain shoes, he was so intensely excited\r\n  that he had to masturbate. Slight pressure on the penis sufficed to\r\n  induce ejaculation, in his state of severe neurasthenia. Shoes\r\n  displayed in shops, and, of late, even advertisements of shoes,\r\n  sufficed to excite him intensely. In states of intense libido he made\r\n  use of onanism, if shoes were not at his immediate command. The\r\n  patient quite early recognized the pain and danger of his condition,\r\n  and, even when he was free from neurasthenic ailments, he was morally\r\n  very much depressed. He sought help of various physicians. Cold-water\r\n  cures and hypnotism were unsuccessful. The most celebrated physicians\r\n  advised him to marry, and assured him that, as soon as he once really\r\n  loved a girl, he would be free from his fetichism. The patient had no\r\n  confidence in his future, but he followed the advice of the\r\n  physicians. He was cruelly disappointed in the hope which the\r\n  authority of the physicians had aroused in him, though he led to the\r\n  altar a lady distinguished by both mental and physical charms. The\r\n  wedding-night was terrible; he felt like a criminal, and did not\r\n  approach his wife. The next day he saw a prostitute with the required\r\n  _chic_. He was weak enough to have intercourse with her in his way.\r\n  Then he bought a pair of elegant ladies’ boots, and hid them in bed,\r\n  and, by touching them, while in marital embrace, after a few days, he\r\n  was able to perform his marital duty. He ejaculated tardily, for he\r\n  had to force himself to coitus; and, after a few weeks, this artifice\r\n  failed, because his imagination failed. He felt unspeakably miserable,\r\n  and would have preferred to make an end of himself. He could no longer\r\n  satisfy his wife, who was sensual, and much excited by their previous\r\n  intercourse; and he saw her suffering severely, both mentally and\r\n  morally. He could not, and would not, disclose his secret. He\r\n  experienced disgust in marital intercourse; he felt afraid of his\r\n  wife, and feared the coming of night and being alone with her. He\r\n  could no longer induce erection.\r\n\r\n  He again made attempts with prostitutes, and satisfied himself by\r\n  touching their shoes. Then the puella had to touch his penis, when he\r\n  would have ejaculation; but, if this did not take place, he would\r\n  attempt coitus with the lewd woman; without success, however, for\r\n  ejaculation would occur immediately. In absolute despair, the patient\r\n  comes for consultation. He deeply regretted that, against his inner\r\n  conviction, he had followed the unfortunate advice of the physicians,\r\n  and made a virtuous wife unhappy, having deeply injured her, both\r\n  mentally and morally. Could he answer God for continuing such a\r\n  marriage? Even if he were to discover himself to his wife, and she\r\n  were to do everything for him, it would not help him; for the familiar\r\n  perfume of the _demi-monde_ was also necessary.\r\n\r\n  Aside from his mental pain, this unfortunate man presented no\r\n  remarkable symptoms. Genitals perfectly normal. Prostate somewhat\r\n  enlarged. He complained that he was so under the domination of his\r\n  boot-ideas that he would even blush when boots were talked about. His\r\n  whole imagination was given up to such ideas. When he was on his\r\n  estate, he often suddenly had to go a distance of ten miles to the\r\n  city, to satisfy his fetichism with shoe-stores or with puellis.\r\n\r\n  This pitiable man could not bring himself to take treatment; for his\r\n  faith in physicians had been greatly shaken. An attempt to ascertain\r\n  whether hypnosis and a removal of the fetichistic association by this\r\n  means, were possible, increased the mental excitement of the\r\n  unfortunate man, who was exclusively controlled by the thought that he\r\n  had made his wife unhappy.\r\n\r\n  Case 88. X., aged 24, from a badly-tainted family (mother’s brother\r\n  and grandfather insane, one sister epileptic, another sister subject\r\n  to migraine, parents of excitable temperament). During dentition he\r\n  had had convulsions. At the age of seven he was taught to masturbate\r\n  by a servant-girl. X. first experienced pleasure in these\r\n  manipulations when this girl occasionally _stroked his penis with her\r\n  foot with her shoe on_. Thus, in the predisposed boy, an association\r\n  was established, as a result of which, from that time on, merely the\r\n  sight of women’s shoes, and, finally, merely the idea of them,\r\n  sufficed to induce sexual excitement and erection. He now masturbated\r\n  while looking at women’s shoes, or while calling them up in\r\n  imagination. At school the teacher’s shoes excited him intensely, and\r\n  in general he was affected by shoes that were partly concealed by\r\n  female garments. One day he could not keep from grasping the teacher’s\r\n  shoes,—an act that caused him great sexual excitement. In spite of\r\n  punishment he could not keep from performing this act repeatedly.\r\n  Finally, it was recognized that there must be an abnormal motive in\r\n  play, and he was sent to a male teacher. He then reveled in the memory\r\n  of shoe-scenes with his former school-mistress, and thus had\r\n  erections, orgasm, and, after his fourteenth year, ejaculation. At the\r\n  same time, he masturbated while thinking of a woman’s shoe. One day\r\n  the thought came to him to increase his pleasure by using such a shoe\r\n  for masturbation. Thereafter he frequently took shoes secretly, and\r\n  used them for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  Nothing else in a woman could excite him; the thought of coitus filled\r\n  him with horror. Men did not interest him in any way. At the age of\r\n  eighteen he opened a general store, and, among other things handled\r\n  ladies’ shoes. He was excited sexually by fitting shoes for his female\r\n  patrons, or by manipulating shoes that they had worn. One day, while\r\n  doing this, he had an epileptic attack, and, soon after, another,\r\n  while practicing onanism in his customary way. Then he recognized, for\r\n  the first time, the injury to health caused by his sexual practices.\r\n  He tried to overcome his onanism, sold no more shoes, and strove to\r\n  free himself from the abnormal association between women’s shoes and\r\n  the sexual function. Then frequent pollutions, with erotic dreams\r\n  about shoes, occurred, and the epileptic attacks continued. Though\r\n  devoid of the slightest feeling for the female sex, he determined on\r\n  marriage, which seemed to him to be the only remedy.\r\n\r\n  He married a pretty young lady. In spite of lively erections when he\r\n  thought of his wife’s shoes, in attempts at cohabitation he was\r\n  absolutely impotent; for his distaste for coitus, and for close\r\n  intercourse in general, was far more powerful than the influence of\r\n  the shoe-idea, which induced sexual excitement. On account of his\r\n  impotence, the patient applied to Dr. Hammond, who treated his\r\n  epilepsy with bromides, and advised him to hang a shoe up over his\r\n  bed, and look at it fixedly during coitus, at the same time imagining\r\n  his wife to be a shoe. The patient became free from epileptic attacks,\r\n  and potent so that he could have coitus about once a week. Too, his\r\n  sexual excitation by women’s shoes grew less and less. (Hammond,\r\n  “Sexual Impotence.”)\r\n\r\nFollowing these two cases of shoe-fetichism, which apparently depend\r\nmerely upon accidental association, and are not favored by any inner\r\nrelation between the things themselves, is given the very strange case\r\nof a fetichist who was excited sexually only by the idea of a night-cap\r\non the head of an ugly old woman; also a case arising apparently from\r\nmerely accidental association:—\r\n\r\n  Case 89. L., aged 37, clerk, from tainted family, had his first\r\n  erection at five years, when he saw his bed-fellow—an aged\r\n  relative—put on a night-cap. The same thing occurred later, when he\r\n  saw an old servant put on her night-cap. Later, simply the idea of an\r\n  old, ugly woman’s head, covered with a night-cap, was sufficient to\r\n  cause an erection. Simply the sight of a cap, or of a naked woman or\r\n  man, made no impression, but the mere touch of a night-cap induced\r\n  erection, and sometimes even ejaculation. L. was not a masturbator,\r\n  and had never been sexually active until his thirty-second year, when\r\n  he married a young girl with whom he had fallen in love. On his\r\n  marriage-night he remained cold until, from necessity, he brought to\r\n  his aid the memory-picture of an ugly woman’s head with a night-cap.\r\n  Coitus was immediately successful. Thereafter it was always necessary\r\n  for him to use this means. Since childhood he had been subject to\r\n  occasional attacks of depression, with tendency to suicide, and now\r\n  and then to frightful hallucinations at night. When looking out of\r\n  windows, he became dizzy and anxious. He was a perverse, peculiar, and\r\n  easily embarrassed man, of bad mental constitution. (Charcot and\r\n  Magnan, _Arch. de neurol._, 1882, No. 12.)\r\n\r\nIn this very peculiar case, the simultaneous coincidence of the first\r\nsexual excitation and an absolutely heterogeneous impression seems to\r\nhave determined the association.\r\n\r\nHammond (_op. cit._) also mentions a case of accidental associative\r\nfetichism that is quite as peculiar. A married man, aged 30, who, in\r\nother respects, was healthy, physically and mentally, is said to have\r\nsuddenly lost his sexual power, after moving to another house, and to\r\nhave regained it as soon as the furniture of the sleeping-room had been\r\narranged as it was before.\r\n\r\n(c) _The Fetich is Some Special Material._—There is a third principal\r\ngroup of fetichists who have as a fetich neither a portion of the female\r\nbody nor a part of female attire, but some particular material which is\r\nso used, not because it is a material for female garments, but because\r\nin itself it can arouse or increase sexual feelings. In many cases of\r\nthis kind, the act of feeling of such material during the sexual act\r\nseems indispensable, in order to make the latter possible, or at least\r\nsatisfactory. Such materials are furs, velvet, and silk.\r\n\r\nThese cases differ from the foregoing instances of erotic\r\ndress-fetichism, in that these materials, unlike female linen, do not\r\nhave any close relation to the female body; and, unlike shoes and\r\ngloves, they are not related to certain parts of the person which have\r\npeculiar symbolic significance. Moreover, this fetichism cannot be due\r\nto an accidental association, like that in the cases of the night-caps\r\nand the arrangement of the sleeping-room; for these cases form an entire\r\ngroup having the same object. It must be presumed that certain tactile\r\nsensations (a kind of tickling which stands in some distant relation to\r\nlustful sensations?), in hyperæsthetic individuals, furnish the occasion\r\nfor the origin of this fetichism.\r\n\r\nThe following is a personal observation of a man affected with this\r\npeculiar fetichism:—\r\n\r\n  Case 90. N. N., aged 37; of a neuropathic family; neuropathic\r\n  constitution. He makes the following statement: “From my earliest\r\n  youth I have always had a deeply-rooted partiality for furs and\r\n  velvet, in that these materials cause me sexual excitement, and the\r\n  sight and touch of them give me lustful pleasure. I can recall no\r\n  event that caused this peculiarity (such as the simultaneous\r\n  occurrence of the first sexual excitation and an impression of these\r\n  materials,—_i.e._, first excitation by a woman dressed in them); in\r\n  fact, I cannot remember when this enthusiasm began. However, by this I\r\n  would not exclude the possibility of such an event,—of an accidental\r\n  connection in a first impression and consequent association; but I\r\n  think it very improbable that such a thing took place, because I\r\n  believe such an occurrence would have deeply impressed me. All I know\r\n  is, that even when a small child I had a lively desire to see and\r\n  stroke furs, and thus had an obscure sensual pleasure. With the first\r\n  occurrence of definite sexual ideas,—_i.e._, the direction of sexual\r\n  thoughts to woman,—the peculiar preference for women dressed in such\r\n  materials was present. Since then, up to mature manhood, it has\r\n  remained unchanged. A woman wearing furs or velvet, or, better, both,\r\n  excites me much more quickly and intensely than one devoid of these\r\n  auxiliaries. To be sure, these materials are not a _conditio sine qua\r\n  non_ of excitation; the desire occurs also without them, in response\r\n  to the usual stimuli; but the sight and, particularly, the touch of\r\n  these fetich-materials form for me a powerful aid to other normal\r\n  stimuli, and intensify erotic pleasure. Often merely the sight of only\r\n  a passably pretty girl, dressed in these materials, causes me lively\r\n  excitement, and overcomes me completely. Even the sight of my\r\n  fetich-materials gives me pleasure, but the touch of them much more.\r\n  (To the penetrating odor of furs I am indifferent—rather, it is\r\n  unpleasant—and it is endurable only by reason of the association with\r\n  pleasing visual and tactile impressions.) I have an intense longing to\r\n  touch these materials while on a woman’s person, to stroke and kiss\r\n  them, and bury my face in them. My greatest pleasure is, _inter\r\n  actum_, to see and feel my fetich on the woman’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n  “Fur, or velvet alone, exerts on me the effect described, the former\r\n  much more intensely than the latter. The combination of the two has\r\n  the most intense effect. Too, female garments of velvet and fur, seen\r\n  and touched without the wearer, cause me sexual excitement; indeed,\r\n  though to a less extent, the same effect is exerted by furs or robes\r\n  having no relation to female attire, and also by the velvet and plush\r\n  of furniture and drapery. Merely pictures of costumes of furs and\r\n  velvet are objects of erotic interest to me; indeed, simply the word\r\n  “fur” has a magic charm for me, and immediately calls up erotic ideas.\r\n\r\n  “Fur is such an object of sexual interest for me that a man wearing\r\n  fur that is effective (_v. infra_) makes a very unpleasant, repugnant,\r\n  and disgusting impression on me; such as would be made on a normal\r\n  person by a man in the costume and attire of a ballet-dancer.\r\n  Similarly repugnant to me is the sight of an old or ugly woman clad in\r\n  beautiful furs; because opposing feelings are thus aroused.\r\n\r\n  “This erotic delight in furs and velvet is something entirely\r\n  different from simple æsthetic pleasure. I have a very lively\r\n  appreciation of beautiful female attire, and, at the same time, a\r\n  particular partiality for point-lace; but it is purely of an æsthetic\r\n  nature. A woman dressed in a point-lace _toilette_ (or in other\r\n  elegant, elaborate attire) is more _beautiful_ than another; but one\r\n  dressed in my fetich-material is more _charming_.\r\n\r\n  “But furs exercise on me the effect described only when the fur has\r\n  very thick, fine, smooth, and rather long hair, that stands out like\r\n  that of the so-called bearded furs. I have noticed that the effect\r\n  depends upon this. I am entirely indifferent not only to the common\r\n  coarse, bushy furs, but also to those that are commonly regarded as\r\n  beautiful and precious, from which the long hair has been removed\r\n  (seal, beaver), or of which the hair is naturally short (ermine); and\r\n  likewise to those of which the hair is over-long and lies down\r\n  (monkey, bear). The specific effect is exerted only by the standing\r\n  long hair of the sable, marten, skunk, etc. But velvet is made of\r\n  thick, fine, standing hairs (fibres); and its effect may be due to\r\n  this. The effect seems to depend upon a very definite impression of\r\n  the points of thick, fine hair upon the end-organs of the sensory\r\n  nerves.\r\n\r\n  “But how this peculiar impression on the tactile nerves is related to\r\n  sexual instinct is a perfect enigma to me. The fact is, that this is\r\n  the case with many men. I would also state expressly that beautiful\r\n  female hair pleases me, but plays no more important part than the\r\n  other charm; and that while touching fur I have no thought of female\r\n  hair. The tactile sensation, also, has not the least resemblance to\r\n  that imparted by female hair. There is never association of any other\r\n  idea. Fur, _per se_, arouses sensuality in me,—how, I cannot explain.\r\n\r\n  “The mere æsthetic effect, the beauty of costly furs, to which every\r\n  one is more or less susceptible; which, since Raphael’s Fornarina and\r\n  Reuben’s Helene Fourment, has been used as the foil and frame of\r\n  female beauty by innumerable painters; and which plays so important a\r\n  _rôle_ in fashion,—the art and science of female dress,—this æsthetic\r\n  effect, as has been remarked, explains nothing here. Beautiful furs\r\n  have the same æsthetic effect on me as on normal individuals, and\r\n  affect me in the same way that flowers, ribbons, precious stones, and\r\n  other ornaments affect every one. Such things, when skillfully used,\r\n  enhance female beauty, and thus, under certain circumstances, may have\r\n  an indirect sensual effect. They never have a direct, powerful,\r\n  sensual effect on me, as do the fetich-materials mentioned.\r\n\r\n  “Though in me, and, in fact, in all ‘fetichists,’ the sensual and\r\n  æsthetic effect must be strictly differentiated, nevertheless, that\r\n  does not prevent me from demanding in my fetich a whole series of\r\n  æsthetic qualities in form, style, color, etc. I could give a very\r\n  lengthy description of these qualities that my taste demands; but I\r\n  omit it as not being essential to the real subject in hand. I would\r\n  only call attention to the fact that erotic fetichism is complicated\r\n  with purely æsthetic tastes.\r\n\r\n  “The specific erotic effect of my fetich-materials can be explained no\r\n  better by the association with the idea of the person of the female\r\n  wearing them, than by their æsthetic impression. For, in the first\r\n  place, as has been said, these materials, as such, affect me when\r\n  entirely isolated from the body; and, in the second place, articles of\r\n  clothing of a much more private nature, and which undoubtedly call up\r\n  associations, exert a much weaker influence over me. Thus the\r\n  fetich-materials have an independent sensual value for me; why, is an\r\n  enigma to me.\r\n\r\n  “Feathers in women’s hats, fans, etc., have the same erotic\r\n  fetichistic effect on me as furs and velvet (similar tactile sensation\r\n  of airy, peculiar tickling). Finally, the fetichistic effect, with\r\n  much less intensity, is exerted by other smooth materials (satin and\r\n  silk); but rough goods (cloth, flannel) have a repelling effect.\r\n\r\n  “In conclusion, I will mention that somewhere I read an article by\r\n  Carl Vogt on microcephalic men, according to which these creatures, at\r\n  the sight of furs, rushed for them and stroked them with every\r\n  manifestation of delight. I am far from any thought, on this ground,\r\n  to see in wide-spread fur-fetichism an atavistic retrogression to the\r\n  taste of our hairy ancestors. Every cretin, with that simplicity\r\n  belonging to his condition, touches anything that pleases him; and the\r\n  act is not necessarily of a sexual nature; just as many normal men\r\n  like to stroke a cat and the like, or even velvet and furs, and are\r\n  not thus excited sexually.”\r\n\r\nIn the literature of this subject, there are a few cases belonging\r\nhere:—\r\n\r\n  Case 91. A boy, aged 12, became powerfully excited sexually when he\r\n  chanced to put on a fox-skin. From that time there was masturbation\r\n  with the employment of furs, or by means of taking a furry dog to bed.\r\n  Ejaculation would result, sometimes followed by an hysterical attack.\r\n  His nocturnal pollutions were induced by dreaming that he lay entirely\r\n  covered up in a white skin. He was absolutely insusceptible to stimuli\r\n  coming from men or women. He was neurasthenic, suffered with delusions\r\n  of being watched, and thought that every one noticed his sexual\r\n  anomaly. He had tædium vitæ on account of this, and finally became\r\n  insane. He had marked taint; his genitals were imperfectly formed, and\r\n  he presented other signs of degeneration. (Tarnowsky, _op. cit._, p.\r\n  22.)\r\n\r\n  Case 92. C. is an especial lover of velvet. He is attracted in a\r\n  normal way by beautiful women, but it particularly excites him to have\r\n  the person with whom he has sexual intercourse dressed in velvet. In\r\n  this, it is remarkable that it is not so much the sight as the touch\r\n  of the velvet that causes the excitation. C. told me that stroking a\r\n  woman’s velvet jacket would excite him sexually to an extent scarcely\r\n  possible in any other way. (Dr. Moll, _op. cit._, p. 127.)\r\n\r\nThe following is a very peculiar case of material-fetichism. It is\r\ncombined with the impulse to injure the fetich, which, in this case,\r\nrepresents an element of sadism toward the woman wearing the fetich, or\r\nimpersonal sadism toward objects, which is of frequent occurrence in\r\nfetichists (comp. p. 170). This impulse to injure made this a remarkable\r\ncriminal case:—\r\n\r\n  Case 93. In July, 1891, Alfred Bachmann, aged 25, locksmith, was\r\n  brought before Judge I., in the second term of the criminal court, in\r\n  Berlin. In April, 1891, the police had had numerous complaints,\r\n  according to which some evil hand had cut women’s dresses with a very\r\n  sharp instrument. On April 25, they were successful in arresting the\r\n  perpetrator in the person of the accused. A policeman noticed how the\r\n  accused pressed, in a remarkable manner, against a lady in the company\r\n  of a gentleman, while they were going through a passage. The officer\r\n  requested the lady to examine her dress, while he held the man under\r\n  suspicion. It was ascertained that the dress had received quite a long\r\n  slit. The accused was taken to the station, where he was examined.\r\n  Besides a sharp knife, which he confessed he used for cutting dresses,\r\n  two silk sashes, such as ladies wear on their dresses, were found on\r\n  him; he also confessed that he had taken these from dresses in crowds.\r\n  Finally, the examination of his person brought to light a lady’s silk\r\n  neck-cloth. The accused said he had found this. Since his statement in\r\n  this case could not be refuted, complaint was therefore made to rest\r\n  on the result of the search; in two instances in which complaint was\r\n  made by the injured parties his acts were designated as injury to\r\n  property, and in two other instances as theft. The accused, a man who\r\n  had been often punished before, with a pale, expressionless face,\r\n  before the judge, gave a strange explanation of his enigmatical\r\n  action. A major’s cook had once thrown him down-stairs when he was\r\n  begging of her, and since that time he had entertained great hatred of\r\n  the whole female sex. There was a doubt about his responsibility, and\r\n  he was therefore examined by a physician. The medical expert gave the\r\n  opinion, at the final trial, that there was no reason to regard the\r\n  accused as insane, though he was of low intelligence. The culprit\r\n  defended himself in a peculiar manner. An irresistible impulse forced\r\n  him to approach women wearing silk dresses. _The touch of silk\r\n  material gave him a feeling of delight_, and this went so far that,\r\n  while in prison for examination, he had been excited if a silk thread\r\n  happened to pass through his fingers while raveling rags. Judge Müller\r\n  considered the accused to be simply a dangerous, vicious man, who\r\n  should be made harmless for a long time. He advised imprisonment for\r\n  one year. The court sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment, with\r\n  loss of honor for a year.\r\n\r\nThe following case was communicated to me by a physician:—\r\n\r\n  In a brothel a certain man was known by the name of “Velvet.” He\r\n  dressed a puella pleasing to him in a black velvet dress, and excited\r\n  and satisfied his sexual appetite simply by stroking his face with a\r\n  part of the velvet skirt, touching the woman in no other way.\r\n\r\nI am assured by an officer that, among masochists, a partiality for\r\nfurs, velvet, and feathers, is very frequent (comp. Case 44). In the\r\nnovels of Sacher-Masoch, fur plays an important part; indeed, it\r\nfurnishes a title to some of them. The explanation given there seems\r\nfar-fetched and unsatisfactory,—that fur (ermine) is the symbol of\r\nroyalty, and therefore the fetich of the men described in the novels.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. _Great Diminution or Complete Absence of Sexual Feeling for the\r\n Opposite Sex, with Substitution of Sexual Feeling and Instinct for the\r\n       Same Sex. (Homo-sexuality, or Contrary Sexual Instinct)._\r\n\r\nAfter the attainment of complete sexual development, among the most\r\nconstant elements of self-consciousness in the individual, are the\r\nknowledge of representing a definite sexual personality and the\r\nconsciousness of desire, during the period of physiological activity of\r\nthe reproductive organs (production of semen and ova), to perform sexual\r\nacts corresponding with that sexual personality,—acts which, consciously\r\nor unconsciously, have a procreative purpose.\r\n\r\nThe sexual instinct and desire, save for indistinct feelings and\r\nimpulses, remain latent until the period of development of the sexual\r\norgans. The child is _generis neutrius_; and though, during this latent\r\nperiod,—when sexuality has not yet risen into clear consciousness, is\r\nbut virtually present, and unconnected with powerful organic\r\nsensations,—too early excitation of the genitals may occur, either\r\nspontaneously or as a result of external influence, and find\r\nsatisfaction in masturbation; yet, notwithstanding this, the _psychical_\r\nrelation to persons of the opposite sex is still absolutely wanting, and\r\nthe sexual acts during this period partake more or less of a reflex\r\nspinal nature.\r\n\r\nThe fact of innocence, or of sexual neutrality, is the more remarkable,\r\nsince very early, in education, employment, dress, etc., the child\r\nundergoes a differentiation from children of the opposite sex. These\r\nimpressions, however, remain destitute of mental meaning, because they\r\napparently are without sexual coloring; for the central organ (cortex)\r\nof sexual emotions and ideas is not yet capable of activity, owing to\r\nits undeveloped condition.\r\n\r\nWith the inception of anatomical and functional development of the\r\ngenerative organs, and the differentiation of form belonging to each\r\nsex, which goes hand in hand with it in the boy or girl, rudiments of a\r\nmental feeling corresponding with the sex are developed; and in this, of\r\ncourse, education and external influences in general have a powerful\r\neffect upon the individual, who is now all attention.\r\n\r\nIf the sexual development is normal and undisturbed, a definite\r\ncharacter, corresponding with the sex, is developed. Certain definite\r\ninclinations and reactions in intercourse with persons of the opposite\r\nsex arise; and it is psychologically worthy of note with what relative\r\nrapidity the definite mental type corresponding with the sex is evolved.\r\n\r\nWhile modesty, for example, during childhood, is essentially but an\r\nuncomprehended and incomprehensible exaction of education and imitation,\r\nand in the innocence and _näiveté_ of the child but imperfectly\r\nexpressed; in the youth and maiden it becomes an imperative requirement\r\nof self-respect; and, if in any way it is offended, intense vasomotor\r\nreaction (blushing) and psychical emotion are induced.\r\n\r\nIf the original constitution is favorable and normal, and factors\r\ninjurious to the psycho-sexual development exercise no influence, then a\r\npsycho-sexual personality is developed that is so unchangeable, and\r\ncorresponds so completely and harmoniously with the sex the individual\r\nrepresents, that subsequent loss of the generative organs (as by\r\ncastration), or the climacteric or senility, cannot essentially alter\r\nit. But this, of course, is not to declare that the castrated man or\r\nwoman, the youth and the aged man, the maiden and matron, the impotent\r\nand the potent man, do not differ essentially from one another mentally.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and important question for what follows is, whether the\r\nperipheral influences of the generative glands (testes and ovaries), or\r\ncentral cerebral conditions, are the determining factors in\r\npsycho-sexual development. The fact that congenital deficiency of the\r\ngenerative glands, or removal of them before puberty, has a great\r\ninfluence on physical and psycho-sexual development, so that the latter\r\nis distorted and assumes a type more closely resembling the opposite sex\r\n(eunuchs, certain viragoes, etc.), betokens their great importance in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nBut that the physical processes taking place in the genital organs are\r\nonly co-operative, and not the exclusive factors in the process of\r\ndevelopment of the psycho-sexual character, is shown by the fact that,\r\nnotwithstanding a normal anatomical and physiological state of these\r\norgans, a sexual instinct may be developed which is the exact opposite\r\nof that characteristic of the sex to which the individual belongs.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the cause is to be sought only in an anomaly of central\r\nconditions,—in an abnormal psycho-sexual constitution. This\r\nconstitution, as far as its anatomical and functional foundation is\r\nconcerned, is absolutely unknown. Since, in almost all such cases, the\r\nindividual subject to the perverse sexual instinct displays a\r\nneuropathic predisposition in several directions, and the latter may be\r\nbrought into relation with hereditary degenerate conditions, this\r\nanomaly of psycho-sexual feeling may be called, clinically, a functional\r\nsign of degeneration. This perverse sexuality appears spontaneously,\r\nwithout external cause, with the development of sexual life, as an\r\nindividual manifestation of an abnormal form of the vita sexualis, and\r\nthen has the force of a _congenital_ phenomenon; or it develops upon a\r\nsexuality the beginning of which was normal, as a result of very\r\ndefinite injurious influences, and thus appears as an _acquired_\r\nanomaly. Upon what this enigmatical phenomenon of acquired homo-sexual\r\ninstinct depends is still inexplicable, and only a matter for\r\nhypothesis. Careful examination of the so-called acquired cases makes it\r\nprobable that the predisposition also present here consists of a latent\r\nhomo-sexuality, or, at least, bi-sexuality, which, for its\r\nmanifestation, requires the influence of accidental exciting causes to\r\nrouse it from its slumber.\r\n\r\nIn so-called contrary sexual instinct there are degrees of the\r\nphenomenon which quite correspond with the degrees of predisposition of\r\nthe individuals. Thus, in the milder cases, there is simple\r\nhermaphroditism; in more pronounced cases, only homo-sexual feeling and\r\ninstinct, but limited to the vita sexualis; in still more complete\r\ncases, the whole psychical personality, and even the bodily sensations,\r\nare transformed to correspond with the sexual perversion; and, in the\r\ncomplete cases, the physical form is correspondingly altered.\r\n\r\nThe following division of the various phenomena of this psycho-sexual\r\nanomaly is made, therefore, in accordance with these clinical facts:—\r\n\r\nA. _Homo-sexual Feeling as an Acquired Manifestation._—The determining\r\ncondition here is the demonstration of perverse feeling for the same\r\nsex; not the proof of sexual acts with the same sex. These two phenomena\r\nmust not be confounded with each other; perversity must not be taken for\r\nperversion.\r\n\r\nPerverse sexual acts, not dependent upon perversion, often come under\r\nobservation. This is especially true with reference to sexual acts\r\nbetween persons of the same sex, particularly pederasty. Here\r\nparæsthesia sexualis is not necessarily at work; but hyperæsthesia, with\r\nphysical or mental impossibility of natural sexual satisfaction. Thus we\r\nfind homo-sexual intercourse in impotent masturbators or debauchees, or\r\n_faute de mieux_ in sensual men and women in imprisonment, on\r\nship-board, in garrisons, bagnios, boarding-schools, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is an immediate return to normal sexual intercourse as soon as\r\nobstacles to it are removed. Very frequently the cause of such temporary\r\naberration is masturbation and its results in youthful individuals.\r\n\r\nNothing is so prone to contaminate—under certain circumstances, even to\r\nexhaust—the source of all noble and ideal sentiments, which arise of\r\nthemselves from a normally developing sexual instinct, as the practice\r\nof masturbation in early years. It despoils the unfolding bud of perfume\r\nand beauty, and leaves behind only the coarse, animal desire for sexual\r\nsatisfaction. If an individual, spoiled in this manner, reaches an age\r\nof maturity, there is wanting in him that æsthetic, ideal, pure, and\r\nfree impulse which draws one toward the opposite sex. Thus the glow of\r\nsensual sensibility wanes, and the inclination toward the opposite sex\r\nbecomes weakened. This defect influences the morals, character, fancy,\r\nfeeling, and instinct of the youthful masturbator, male or female, in an\r\nunfavorable way, and, under certain circumstances, allows the desire for\r\nthe opposite sex to sink to _nil_; so that masturbation is preferred to\r\nthe natural mode of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSometimes the development of higher sexual feelings toward the opposite\r\nsex suffers, on account of hypochondriacal fear of infection in sexual\r\nintercourse; or on account of an actual infection; or they suffer as a\r\nresult of a faulty education which points out such dangers and\r\nexaggerates them. Again (especially in females), fear of the result of\r\ncoitus (pregnancy), or abhorrence of men, by reason of mental or moral\r\nweakness, may direct into perverse channels an instinct that makes\r\nitself felt with abnormal intensity. But too early and perverse sexual\r\nsatisfaction injures not merely the mind, but also the body; inasmuch as\r\nit induces neuroses of the sexual apparatus (irritable weakness of the\r\ncentres governing erection and ejaculation; defective pleasurable\r\nfeeling in coitus), while, at the same time, it maintains the\r\nimagination and libido in continuous excitement.\r\n\r\nAlmost every masturbator at last reaches a point where, frightened on\r\nlearning the results of the vice, or on experiencing them\r\n(neurasthenia), or led by example or seduction to the opposite sex, he\r\nwishes to free himself of the vice and re-instate his vita sexualis. The\r\nmoral and mental conditions are the most unfavorable possible. The pure\r\nglow of sexual feeling is destroyed; the fire of sexual instinct is\r\nwanting, and self-confidence, no less; for every masturbator is more or\r\nless timid and cowardly. If the youthful sinner at last comes to make an\r\nattempt at coitus, he is either disappointed because enjoyment is\r\nwanting, on account of defective sensual feeling, or he is lacking in\r\nthe mental strength necessary to accomplish the act. The fiasco has a\r\nfatal effect, and leads to absolute psychical impotence. A bad\r\nconscience and the memory of past failures prevent success in any\r\nfurther attempts. The constant libido sexualis, however, demands\r\nsatisfaction; but this moral and mental perversion separates him further\r\nand further from women. For various reasons, however (neurasthenic\r\ncomplaints, hypochondriacal fear of the results, etc.), the individual\r\nis kept from masturbation. Occasionally, under such circumstances, there\r\nmay be bestiality. Intercourse with the same sex is then near at\r\nhand,—as a result of occasional seduction or of the feelings of\r\nfriendship which, on the level of pathological sexuality, easily\r\nassociate themselves with sexual feelings. Passive and mutual onanism\r\nthen becomes the equivalent of the avoided act. If there is a\r\nseducer,—which, unfortunately, is so frequent,—then the cultivated\r\npederast is produced,—_i.e._, a man who performs _quasi_ acts of onanism\r\nwith persons of his own sex, and, at the same time, feels and prefers\r\nhimself in an active _rôle_ corresponding with his real sex; who is\r\nmentally indifferent not only to persons of the opposite sex, but also\r\nto those of his own sex.\r\n\r\nSexual aberration in the _normally_ constituted, _untainted_, mentally\r\nhealthy individual, reaches this degree. No case has been demonstrated\r\nin which perversity has been transformed into perversion,—into a\r\nreversal of the sexual instinct.[101]\r\n\r\nWith tainted individuals, the matter is quite different. The latent\r\nperverse sexuality is developed under the influence of neurasthenia\r\ninduced by masturbation, abstinence, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nGradually, in contact with persons of the same sex, sexual excitation by\r\nthem is induced. Related ideas are colored with lustful feelings, and\r\nawaken corresponding desires. This decidedly degenerate reaction is the\r\nbeginning of a process of physical and mental transformation, a\r\ndescription of which is attempted in what follows, and which is one of\r\nthe most interesting psychological phenomena that has been observed.\r\nThis metamorphosis presents different stages, or degrees.\r\n\r\n_I. Degree: Simple Reversal of Sexual Feeling._—This degree is attained\r\nwhen persons of the same sex have an aphrodisiac effect, and the\r\nindividual has a sexual feeling for them. Character and feeling,\r\nhowever, still correspond with the sex of the individual presenting the\r\nreversal of sexual feeling. He feels himself in the active _rôle_; he\r\nrecognizes his impulse toward his own sex as an aberration, and finally\r\nseeks aid. With episodical improvement of the neurosis, at first even\r\nnormal sexual feelings may re-appear and assert themselves. The\r\nfollowing case seems well suited to exemplify this stage of the\r\npsycho-sexual degeneration:—\r\n\r\n  Case 94. _Acquired Contrary Sexual Instinct._—“I am an official, and,\r\n  as far as I know, come of an untainted family. My father died of an\r\n  acute disease; my mother is living and is _quite nervous_. _A sister\r\n  has been very intensely religious for some years._\r\n\r\n  “I myself am tall, and, in speech, gait, and manner, give a perfectly\r\n  masculine impression. Measles is the only disease I have had; but\r\n  since my thirteenth year I have suffered with so-called nervous\r\n  headache. My sexual life began in my thirteenth year, when I became\r\n  acquainted with a boy somewhat older than myself, with whom I took\r\n  pleasure in mutual fondling of the genitals. I had the first\r\n  ejaculation in my fourteenth year. Seduced to onanism by two older\r\n  school-mates, I practiced it partly with others and partly alone; in\r\n  the latter case, however, always with the thought of persons of the\r\n  female sex. My libido sexualis was very great, as it is to-day. Later,\r\n  I tried to win a pretty, stout servant-girl who had very large mammæ;\r\n  id solum assecutus sum, ut me praesente superiorem corporis sui partem\r\n  enudaret mihique concederet os mammasque osculari, dum ipsa penem meum\r\n  valde erectum in manum suam recepit eumque trivit.\r\n\r\n  “Notwithstanding my urgent demand for coitus, she would not allow it;\r\n  but she finally permitted me to touch her genitals.\r\n\r\n  “After going to the University, I visited a brothel and succeeded\r\n  without especial effort.\r\n\r\n  “There an event occurred which brought a change in me. One evening I\r\n  accompanied a friend home, and in a mild state of intoxication I\r\n  grasped him ad genitalia. He made but slight opposition. I then went\r\n  up to his room with him, and we practiced mutual masturbation. From\r\n  that time we indulged in it quite frequently; in fact, it came to\r\n  immissio penis in os, with resultant ejaculations. But it is strange\r\n  that I was not at all in love with this person, but passionately in\r\n  love with another friend, near whom I never felt the slightest sexual\r\n  excitement, and whom I never connected with sexual matters, even in\r\n  thought. My visits to brothels, where I was gladly received, became\r\n  more infrequent; in my friend I found a substitute, and did not desire\r\n  sexual intercourse with women.\r\n\r\n  “We never practiced pederasty, and that word was not even known\r\n  between us. From the beginning of this relation with my friend, I\r\n  again masturbated more frequently, and naturally the thought of\r\n  females receded more and more into the background, and I thought more\r\n  and more about young, handsome, strong men with the largest genitals.\r\n  I preferred young fellows, from sixteen to twenty-five years old,\r\n  without beards, but they had to be handsome and clean. Young laborers\r\n  dressed in trousers of Manchester cloth or English leather,\r\n  particularly masons, especially excited me.\r\n\r\n  “Persons in my own position had hardly any effect on me; but, at the\r\n  sight of one of those strapping fellows of the lower class, I\r\n  experienced marked sexual excitement. It seems to me that the touch of\r\n  such trousers, the opening of them, and the grasping of the penis, as\r\n  well as kissing the fellow, would be the greatest delight. My\r\n  sensibility to female charms is somewhat dulled; yet in sexual\r\n  intercourse with a woman, particularly when she has well-developed\r\n  mammæ, I am always potent without the help of imagination. I have\r\n  never attempted to make use of a young laborer, or the like, for the\r\n  satisfaction of my evil desires, and never shall; but I often feel the\r\n  longing to do it. I often impress on myself the mental image of such a\r\n  man, and then masturbate at home.\r\n\r\n  “I am absolutely devoid of taste for female work. I rather like to\r\n  move in female society, but dancing is repugnant to me. I have a\r\n  lively interest in the fine arts. That my sexual sense is partly\r\n  reversed is, I believe, in part due to greater convenience, which\r\n  keeps me from entering into a relation with a girl; as the latter is a\r\n  matter of too much trouble. To be constantly visiting houses of\r\n  prostitution is, for æsthetic reasons, repugnant to me; and thus I am\r\n  always returning to solitary onanism, which is very difficult for me\r\n  to avoid.\r\n\r\n  “Hundreds of times I have said to myself that, in order to have a\r\n  normal sexual sense, it would be necessary for me, first of all, to\r\n  overcome my irresistible passion for onanism,—a practice so repugnant\r\n  to my æsthetic feeling. Again and again I have resolved with all my\r\n  might to fight this passion; but I am still unsuccessful. When I felt\r\n  the sexual impulse gaining strength, instead of seeking satisfaction\r\n  in the natural manner, I preferred to masturbate, because I felt that\r\n  I would thus have more enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  “And yet experience has taught me that I am always potent with girls,\r\n  and that, too, without trouble and without the help of imagining\r\n  masculine genitals. In one case, however, I did not attain ejaculation\r\n  because the woman—it was in a brothel—was devoid of every charm. I\r\n  cannot avoid the thought and severe self-accusation that, to a certain\r\n  extent, my contrary sexuality is the result of excessive onanism; and\r\n  this especially depresses me, because I am compelled to acknowledge\r\n  that I scarcely feel strong enough to overcome this vice by the force\r\n  of my own will.\r\n\r\n  “As a result of my relations with my fellow-student and school-mate\r\n  for years, mentioned in this communication,—which, however, began\r\n  while we were at the University, and after we had been friends for\r\n  seven years,—the impulse to unnatural satisfaction of libido has grown\r\n  much stronger. I trust you will permit the description of an incident\r\n  which occupied me for months:—\r\n\r\n  “In the summer of 1882, I made the acquaintance of a companion six\r\n  years younger than myself, who, with several others, had been\r\n  introduced to me and my acquaintances. I very soon felt a deep\r\n  interest in this handsome man, who was unusually well proportioned,\r\n  slim, and full of health. After a few weeks of association, this\r\n  feeling became friendship, and at last passionate love, with feelings\r\n  of the most intense jealousy. I very soon noticed that, in this,\r\n  sexual excitation was also very marked; and, notwithstanding my\r\n  determination, aside from all others, to keep myself in check in\r\n  relation to this man, whom I respected so highly for his superior\r\n  character, one night, after free indulgence in beer, as we were\r\n  enjoying a bottle of champagne in my room and drinking to good, true,\r\n  and lasting friendship, I yielded to the irresistible impulse to\r\n  embrace him, etc.\r\n\r\n  “When I saw him, next day, I was so ashamed that I could not look him\r\n  in the face. I felt the deepest regret for my action, and accused\r\n  myself bitterly for having thus sullied this friendship, which was to\r\n  be and remain so pure and precious. In order to prove to him that I\r\n  had lost control of myself only momentarily, at the end of the\r\n  semester I urged him to make an excursion with me; and after some\r\n  reluctance, the reason of which was only too clear to me, he\r\n  consented. Several nights we slept in the same room without any\r\n  attempt on my part to repeat my action. I wished to talk with him\r\n  about the event of that night, but I could not bring myself to it;\r\n  even when, during the next semester, we were separated, I could not\r\n  induce myself to write to him on the subject; and when I visited him,\r\n  in March, at X., it was the same. And yet I felt a great desire to\r\n  clear up this dark point by an open statement. In October of the same\r\n  year, I was again in X., and this time found courage to speak without\r\n  reserve; indeed, I asked him why he had not resisted me. He answered\r\n  that, in part, it was because he wished to please me, and, in part,\r\n  owing to the fact that he was somewhat apathetic as a result of being\r\n  a little intoxicated. I explained to him my condition, and also gave\r\n  him “Psychopathia Sexualis” to read, expressing the hope that by the\r\n  force of my own will I should become fully and lastingly master of my\r\n  unnatural impulse. Since this confession, the relation between this\r\n  friend and me has been the most delightful and happy possible; there\r\n  are the most friendly feelings on both sides, which are heart-felt and\r\n  true; and it is to be hoped that they will endure.\r\n\r\n  “If I should not improve my abnormal condition, I am determined to put\r\n  myself under your treatment; the more because, after a careful study\r\n  of your work, I cannot count myself as belonging to the category of\r\n  so-called urnings; and, too, because I have the firm conviction, or\r\n  hope, at least, that a strong will, assisted and combined with\r\n  skillful treatment, could transform me into a man of normal feeling.”\r\n\r\n  Case 95. Ilma S.,[102] aged 29; single; merchant’s daughter. She comes\r\n  of a family having bad nervous taint. Father was a drinker and died by\r\n  suicide, as also did the patient’s brother and sister. A sister\r\n  suffers with convulsive hysteria. Mother’s father shot himself while\r\n  insane. Mother was sickly, and died paralyzed after apoplexy. The\r\n  patient never had any severe illness. She is bright, enthusiastic, and\r\n  dreamy. Menses at the age of eighteen without difficulty; but\r\n  thereafter they were very irregular. At fourteen, chlorosis and\r\n  catalepsy from fright. Later, hysteria gravis and an attack of\r\n  hysterical insanity. At eighteen, relations with a young man which\r\n  were not platonic. This man’s love was passionately returned. From\r\n  statements of the patient, it seems that she was very sensual, and\r\n  after separation from her lover practiced masturbation. After this she\r\n  led a romantic life. In order to earn a living, she put on male\r\n  clothing, and became a tutor; but she gave up her place because her\r\n  mistress, not knowing her sex, fell in love with her and courted her.\r\n  Then she became a railway-employé. In the company of her companions,\r\n  in order to conceal her sex, she was compelled to visit brothels with\r\n  them, and hear the most vulgar stories. This became so distasteful to\r\n  her that she gave up her place, resumed the garments of a female, and\r\n  again sought to earn her living. She was arrested for a theft, and on\r\n  account of severe hystero-epilepsy was sent to the hospital. There,\r\n  inclination and impulse toward the same sex were discovered. The\r\n  patient became troublesome on account of passionate love for female\r\n  nurses and patients.\r\n\r\n  Her sexual perversion was considered congenital. With regard to this\r\n  the patient made some interesting statements:—\r\n\r\n  “I am judged incorrectly, if it is thought that I feel myself a man\r\n  toward the female sex. In my whole thought and feeling I am much more\r\n  a woman. I loved my cousin as only a woman can love a man.\r\n\r\n  “The change of my feeling originated in this, that, in Pesth, dressed\r\n  as a man, I had an opportunity to observe my cousin. I saw that I had\r\n  wholly deceived myself in him. That gave me terrible heart-pangs. I\r\n  knew that I could never love another man; that I belonged to those who\r\n  love but once. Of similar effect was the fact that, in the society of\r\n  my companions at the railway, I was compelled to hear the most\r\n  offensive language and visit the most disreputable houses. As a result\r\n  of the insight into men’s motives, gained in this way, I took an\r\n  unconquerable dislike to them. However, since I am of a very\r\n  passionate nature and need to have some loving person on whom to\r\n  depend, and to whom I can wholly surrender myself, I felt myself more\r\n  and more powerfully drawn toward intelligent women and girls who were\r\n  in sympathy with me.”\r\n\r\nThe contrary sexual instinct of this patient, which was clearly\r\nacquired, expressed itself in a stormy and decidedly sensual way, and\r\nwas further augmented by masturbation; because constant oversight in\r\nhospitals made sexual satisfaction with the same sex impossible.\r\nCharacter and occupation remained feminine. There were no manifestations\r\nof viraginity. According to information lately received by the author,\r\nthis patient, after two years of treatment in an asylum, was entirely\r\nfreed from her neurosis and sexual perversion, and discharged cured.\r\n\r\n  Case 96. X., aged 19; mother nervous; two sisters of mother’s father\r\n  were insane. Patient of nervous temperament; well endowed mentally;\r\n  well developed; normally formed. When he was twelve years old, he was\r\n  seduced into mutual onanism by an elder brother.\r\n\r\n  After this, the patient continued the vice alone. In the last three\r\n  years, during the act of masturbation, he had had peculiar fancies in\r\n  the sense of “contrary sexual instinct.”\r\n\r\n  He fancies himself a female; as, for example, a ballet-dancer in the\r\n  act of coitus with an officer or circus rider. These perverse fancies\r\n  have accompanied the act of masturbation since the patient became\r\n  neurasthenic. He understands the harm of masturbation, fights\r\n  desperately against it, but always gives up to the impulse.\r\n\r\n  If he is able to withstand the impulse for a few days, a normal desire\r\n  for sexual intercourse with females is awakened; but a certain fear of\r\n  infection holds these desires in check, and always drives him again to\r\n  masturbation.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of remark that this unfortunate’s lascivious dreams\r\n  concerned only females.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the last few months, the patient had become very\r\n  neurasthenic and hypochondriacal. He feared tabes.\r\n\r\n  I advised treatment of the neurasthenia, suppression of masturbation,\r\n  and marital cohabitation, if possible, after improvement of the\r\n  neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n  Case 97. Mr. X, aged 35, single, official; mother insane, brother\r\n  hypochondriacal.\r\n\r\n  Patient was healthy, strong, of lively sensual temperament. He had\r\n  manifested powerful sexual instinct abnormally early, and masturbated\r\n  while yet a small boy. He had coitus the first time at the age of\r\n  fourteen, he says, with enjoyment and complete power. When fifteen\r\n  years old, a man sought to seduce him, and performed manustupration on\r\n  him. X. experienced a feeling of repulsion, and freed himself from the\r\n  disgusting situation. At maturity he committed excesses in libido,\r\n  with coitus; in 1880 he became neurasthenic, being afflicted with\r\n  weakness of erection and ejaculatio præcox. He thus became less and\r\n  less potent, and no longer experienced pleasure in the sexual act. At\r\n  this time of sexual decadence, for a long time, he still had what was\r\n  previously foreign to him, and is still incomprehensible to him,—an\r\n  inclination for sexual intercourse with immature girls of the age of\r\n  twelve or thirteen. His libido increased as virility diminished.\r\n\r\n  Gradually he developed inclination for boys of thirteen or fourteen.\r\n  He was impelled to approach them.\r\n\r\n  Quodsi ei occasio data est ut tangere posset pueros qui ei placuere,\r\n  penis vehementer se erexit tum maxime quum crura puerorum tangere\r\n  potuisset. Abhinc feminas non cupivit. Nonnunquam feminas ad coitum\r\n  coëgit sed erectio debilis, ejaculatio præmatura erat sine ulla\r\n  voluptate.\r\n\r\n  Now only youths interested him. He dreamed about them and had\r\n  pollutions. After 1882 he now and then had opportunity concumbere cum\r\n  juvenibus. This led to powerful sexual excitement, which he satisfied\r\n  by masturbation. It was only exceptional for him to venture to touch\r\n  his bed-fellow and indulge in mutual masturbation. He shunned\r\n  pederasty. For the most part, he was compelled to satisfy his sexual\r\n  needs by means of solitary masturbation. In the act he called up the\r\n  vision of pleasing boys. After sexual intercourse with such boys, he\r\n  always felt strengthened and refreshed, but morally depressed; because\r\n  there was consciousness of having performed a perverse, indecent, and\r\n  punishable act. He found it painful that his disgusting impulse was\r\n  more powerful than his will.\r\n\r\n  X. thinks that his love for his own sex has resulted from great excess\r\n  in natural sexual intercourse, and bemoans his situation. On the\r\n  occasion of a consultation, in December, 1889, he asked whether there\r\n  were any means to bring him back to a normal sexual condition, since\r\n  he had no real horror feminæ, and would very gladly marry.\r\n\r\n  This intelligent patient, free from degenerative signs, presented no\r\n  abnormal symptoms except those of sexual and spinal neurasthenia of\r\n  moderate degree.\r\n\r\n_II. Degree: Eviration and Defemination._—If, in cases of contrary\r\nsexual instinct thus developed, no restoration occurs, then deep and\r\nlasting transformations of the psychical personality may occur. The\r\nprocess completing itself in this way may be briefly designated\r\n_eviration_. The patient undergoes a deep change of character,\r\nparticularly in his feelings and inclinations, which become those of a\r\nfemale. After this, he also feels himself to be a woman during the\r\nsexual act, has desire only for passive sexual indulgence, and, under\r\ncertain circumstances, sinks to the level of a prostitute. In this\r\ncondition of deep and more lasting psycho-sexual transformation, the\r\nindividual is like the (congenital) urning of high grade. The\r\npossibility of a restoration of the previous mental and sexual\r\npersonality seems, in such a case, excluded.\r\n\r\nThe following case is a classical example of this variety of lasting\r\nacquired contrary sexual instinct:—\r\n\r\n  Case 98. Sch., aged 30, physician, one day told me the story of his\r\n  life and malady, asking explanation, and advice concerning certain\r\n  anomalies of his vita sexualis. The following description gives, for\r\n  the most part verbatim, the details of the autobiography; only in some\r\n  portions is it shortened:—\r\n\r\n  “My parents were healthy. As a child I was sickly; but with good care\r\n  I thrived, and got on well in school. When eleven years old, I was\r\n  taught to masturbate by my playmates, and gave myself up to it\r\n  passionately. Until I was fifteen, I learned easily. On account of\r\n  frequent pollutions, I became less capable, did not get on easily in\r\n  school, and was uncertain and embarrassed when called on by the\r\n  teacher. Frightened by my loss of capability, and recognizing that the\r\n  loss of semen was responsible for it, I gave up masturbation; but the\r\n  pollutions became even more frequent, so that I often had two or three\r\n  in a night. In despair, I now consulted one physician after another.\r\n  None were able to help me.\r\n\r\n  “Since I grew weaker and weaker, by reason of the loss of semen, with\r\n  the impulse to sexual satisfaction growing more and more powerful, I\r\n  sought houses of prostitution. But I was there unable to find\r\n  satisfaction; for, even though the sight of a naked female pleased me,\r\n  neither orgasm nor erection occurred; and even manustupration by the\r\n  puella was not capable of inducing erection. Scarcely would I leave\r\n  the house, when the impulse would seize me again, and I would have\r\n  violent erections. I grew ashamed before the girls, and ceased to\r\n  visit such houses. Thus a couple of years passed. My sexual life\r\n  consisted of pollutions. My inclination toward the opposite sex grew\r\n  less and less. At nineteen I went to the University. The theatre had\r\n  more attractions for me. I wished to become an actor. My parents were\r\n  not willing. At the Capital I was compelled now and then to visit\r\n  girls with my comrades. I feared such a situation; because I knew that\r\n  coitus was impossible for me, and because my friends might discover my\r\n  impotence. Therefore, I avoided, as far as possible, the danger of\r\n  becoming the butt of jokes and ridicule.\r\n\r\n  “One evening, in the opera-house, an old gentleman sat near me. He\r\n  courted me. I laughed heartily at the foolish old man, and entered\r\n  into his joke. Exinapinato genitalia mea prehendit, quo facto statim\r\n  penis meus se erexit. Frightened, I demanded of him what he meant. He\r\n  said that he was in love with me. Having heard of hermaphrodites in\r\n  the clinics, I thought I had one before me, and became curious to see\r\n  his genitals. The old man was very willing, and went with me to the\r\n  water-closet. Sicuti penem maximum ejus erectum adspexi, perterritus\r\n  effugi.\r\n\r\n  “This man followed me, and made strange proposals which I did not\r\n  understand, and repelled. He did not give me any rest. I learned the\r\n  secrets of male love for males, and felt that my sexuality was excited\r\n  by it. But I resisted the shameful passion (as I then regarded it),\r\n  and, for the next three years, I remained free from it. During this\r\n  time I repeatedly attempted coitus with girls in vain. My attempts to\r\n  free myself of my impotence by means of medical treatment were also\r\n  vain. Once, when my libido sexualis was troubling me again, I recalled\r\n  what the old man had told me: that male-loving men were accustomed to\r\n  meet on the E. Promenade.\r\n\r\n  “After a hard struggle, and with beating heart, I went there, made the\r\n  acquaintance of a blonde man, and allowed myself to be seduced. The\r\n  first step was taken. This kind of sexual love was satisfactory to me.\r\n  I always preferred to be in the arms of a strong man. The satisfaction\r\n  consisted of mutual manustupration; occasionally in osculum ad penem\r\n  alterius. I was then twenty-three years old. Sitting, together with my\r\n  comrades, on the beds of patients in the clinic during the lectures,\r\n  excited me so intensely that I could scarcely listen to the lectures.\r\n  In the same year I entered into a formal love-relation with a merchant\r\n  of thirty-four. We lived as man and wife. X. played the man, and fell\r\n  more and more in love. I gave up to him, but now and then I had to\r\n  play the man. After a time I grew tired of him, became unfaithful, and\r\n  he became jealous. There were terrible scenes, which led to temporary\r\n  separation, and finally to actual rupture. (The merchant afterward\r\n  became insane, and died by suicide.)\r\n\r\n  “I made many acquaintances, and loved the most ordinary people. I\r\n  preferred those having a full beard, and who were tall and of middle\r\n  age, and able to play the active _rôle_ well. I developed a proctitis.\r\n  The professor thought it was the result of sitting too much while\r\n  preparing for examinations. I developed a fistula, and had to undergo\r\n  an operation; but this did not cure me of my desire to allow myself to\r\n  be used passively. I became a physician, and went to a provincial\r\n  city, where I had to live like a nun. I developed a desire to move in\r\n  ladies’ society, and was gladly welcomed there; because it was found\r\n  that I was not so one-sided as most men, and was interested in\r\n  _toilettes_ and such feminine things. However, I felt very unhappy and\r\n  lonesome. Fortunately, in this town, I made the acquaintance of a man,\r\n  a ‘sister,’ who felt like me. For some time I was taken care of by\r\n  him. When he had to leave, I had an attack of despair, with\r\n  depression, which was accompanied by thoughts of suicide.\r\n\r\n  “When it became impossible for me to longer endure the town, I became\r\n  a military surgeon in the Capital. There I began to live again, and\r\n  often made two or three acquaintances in one day. I had never loved\r\n  boys or young people; only fully-developed men. The thought of falling\r\n  into the hands of the police was frightful. Thus I have escaped the\r\n  clutches of the blackmailer. At the same time, I could not keep myself\r\n  from the satisfaction of my impulse. After some months I fell in love\r\n  with an official of forty. I remained true to him for a year, and we\r\n  lived like a pair of lovers. I was the wife, and was formally courted\r\n  by the lover. One day I was transferred to a small town. We were in\r\n  despair. The last night was spent in continually kissing and caressing\r\n  one another.\r\n\r\n  “In T. I was unspeakably unhappy, in spite of some ‘sisters’ whom I\r\n  found. I could not forget my lover. In order to satisfy my sexual\r\n  desire, which cried for satisfaction, I chose soldiers. Money obtained\r\n  men; but they remained cold, and I had no enjoyment with them. I was\r\n  successful in being re-transferred to the Capital. There, there was a\r\n  new love-relation, but much jealousy; because my lover liked to go\r\n  into the society of ‘sisters,’ and was proud and coquettish. There was\r\n  a rupture. I was very unhappy and very glad to be transferred from the\r\n  Capital. I now stayed in C., alone and in despair. Two infantry\r\n  privates were brought into service, but with the same unsatisfactory\r\n  result. When shall I ever find true love again?\r\n\r\n  “I am over medium height, well developed, and look somewhat aged; and,\r\n  therefore, when I wish to make conquests I use the arts of the toilet.\r\n  My manner, movements, and face are masculine. Physically I feel as\r\n  youthful as a boy of twenty. I love the theatre, and especially art.\r\n  My interest in the stage is in the actresses, whose every movement and\r\n  gesture I notice and criticise.\r\n\r\n  “In the society of gentlemen I am silent and embarrassed, while in the\r\n  society of those like myself I am free, witty, and as fawning as a\r\n  cat, if a man is sympathetic. If I am without love, I become deeply\r\n  melancholic; but the favors of the first handsome man dispel my\r\n  depression. In other ways I am frivolous; anything but ambitious. My\r\n  profession is nothing to me. Masculine pursuits do not interest me. I\r\n  prefer novels and going to the theatre. I am effeminate, sensitive,\r\n  easily moved, easily injured, and nervous. A sudden noise makes my\r\n  whole body tremble, and I have to collect myself in order to keep from\r\n  crying out.”\r\n\r\n  _Remarks_: The foregoing case is certainly one of acquired contrary\r\n  sexual instinct, since the sexual instinct and impulse were originally\r\n  directed toward the female sex. Sch. became neurasthenic through\r\n  masturbation.\r\n\r\n  As an accompanying manifestation of the neurasthenic neurosis,\r\n  lessened impressionability of the erection-centre and consequent\r\n  relative impotence came on. As a result of this, sexual sensibility\r\n  toward the opposite sex was lessened, with simultaneous persistence of\r\n  libido sexualis. The acquired contrary sexual instinct must be\r\n  abnormal, since the first touch by a person of the same sex is an\r\n  adequate stimulus for the erection-centre. The perverse sexual feeling\r\n  became complete. At first Sch. felt like a man in the sexual act; but\r\n  more and more, as the change progressed, the feeling and desire of\r\n  satisfaction changed to the form which, as a rule, characterizes the\r\n  (congenital) urning.\r\n\r\n  This eviration induces a desire for the passive _rôle_, and, further,\r\n  for (passive) pederasty. It makes a deeper impress on the character.\r\n  The character becomes feminine, inasmuch as Sch. now prefers to move\r\n  in the society of actual females, has an increasing desire for\r\n  feminine occupations, and, indeed, makes use of the arts of the toilet\r\n  in order to improve his fading charms and make “conquests.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts, concerning acquired contrary sexual instinct and\r\neffemination, find an interesting confirmation in the following\r\nethnological data:—\r\n\r\n  Even Herodotus describes a peculiar disease which frequently affected\r\n  the Scythians. The disease consisted in this: that men became\r\n  effeminate in character, put on female garments, did the work of\r\n  women, and even became effeminate in appearance. As an explanation of\r\n  this insanity of the Scythians,[103] Herodotus relates the myth that\r\n  the goddess Venus, angered by the plundering of the temple at Ascalon\r\n  by the Scythians, had made women of these plunderers and their\r\n  posterity.\r\n\r\n  Hippocrates, not believing in supernatural diseases, recognized that\r\n  impotence was here a causative factor, and explained it, though\r\n  incorrectly, as due to the custom of the Scythians, by attributing it\r\n  to disease of the jugular veins induced by excessive riding. He\r\n  thought that these veins were of great importance in the preservation\r\n  of the sexual powers, and that when they were severed, impotence was\r\n  induced. Since the Scythians considered their impotence due to divine\r\n  punishment, and incurable, they put on the clothing of females, and\r\n  lived as women among women.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that, according to Klaproth (“Reise in den\r\n  Kaukasus,” Berlin, 1812, v, p. 285) and Chotomski, even at the present\r\n  time impotence is very frequent among the Tartars, as a result of\r\n  riding unsaddled horses. The same is observed among the Apaches and\r\n  Navajos of the Western Continent, who ride excessively, scarcely ever\r\n  going on foot, and are remarkable for small genitals and mild libido\r\n  and virility. Sprengel, Lallemand, and Nysten recognized the fact that\r\n  excessive riding may be injurious to the sexual organs.\r\n\r\n  Hammond reports analogous observations of great interest concerning\r\n  the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. These descendants of the Aztecs\r\n  cultivate so-called “mujerados,” of which every Pueblo tribe requires\r\n  one in the religious ceremonies (actual orgies in the spring), in\r\n  which pederasty plays an important part. In order to cultivate a\r\n  “mujerado,” a very powerful man is chosen, and he is made to\r\n  masturbate excessively and ride constantly. Gradually such irritable\r\n  weakness of the genital organs is engendered that, in riding, great\r\n  loss of semen is induced. This condition of irritability passes into\r\n  paralytic impotence. Then the testicles and penis atrophy, the hair of\r\n  the beard falls out, the voice loses its depth and compass, and\r\n  physical strength and energy decrease. Inclinations and disposition\r\n  become feminine. The “mujerado” loses his position in society as a\r\n  man. He takes on feminine manners and customs, and associates with\r\n  women. Yet, for religious reasons, he is held in honor. It is probable\r\n  that, at other times than during the festivals, he is used by the\r\n  chiefs for pederasty. Hammond had an opportunity to examine two\r\n  “mujerados.” One had become such seven years before, and was\r\n  thirty-five years old at the time. Seven years before, he was entirely\r\n  masculine and potent. He had noticed gradual atrophy of the testicles\r\n  and penis. At the same time he lost libido and the power of erection.\r\n  He differed in nowise, in dress and manner, from the women among whom\r\n  Hammond found him. The genital hair was wanting, the penis was\r\n  shrunken, the scrotum lax and pendulous, and the testicles were very\r\n  much atrophied and no longer sensitive to pressure. The “mujerado” had\r\n  large mammæ like a pregnant woman, and asserted that he had nursed\r\n  several children whose mothers had died. A second “mujerado,” aged\r\n  thirty-six, after he had been ten years in the condition, presented\r\n  the same peculiarities, though with less development of mammæ. Like\r\n  the first, the voice was high and thin. The body was plump.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Degree: Stage of Transition to Metamorphosis Sexualis Paranoica._\r\n\r\nA further degree of development is represented by those cases in which\r\nbodily sensation is also transformed in the sense of a _transmutatio\r\nsexus_. In this respect the following case is unique:—\r\n\r\n  Case 99. _Autobiography._ “Born in Hungary in 1844, for many years I\r\n  was the only child of my parents; for the other children died for the\r\n  most part of general weakness. A brother came late, who is still\r\n  living.\r\n\r\n  “I come of a family in which nervous and mental diseases have been\r\n  numerous. It is said that I was very pretty as a little child, with\r\n  blonde locks and transparent skin; very obedient, quiet, and modest,\r\n  so that I was taken everywhere in the society of ladies without any\r\n  offense on my part.\r\n\r\n  “With a very active imagination—my enemy through life—my talents\r\n  developed rapidly. I could read and write at the age of four; my\r\n  memory reaches back to my third year. I played with everything that\r\n  fell into my hands,—with leaden soldiers, or stones, or ribbons from a\r\n  children’s store; but a machine for working in wood, that was given to\r\n  me as a present, I did not like. I liked best to be at home with my\r\n  mother, who was everything to me. I had two or three friends, with\r\n  whom I got on good-naturedly; but I liked to play with their sisters\r\n  quite as well, who always treated me like a girl, which at first did\r\n  not embarrass me. I must have already been on the road to become just\r\n  like a girl; at least, I can still well remember how it was always\r\n  said: ‘He is not intended for a boy.’ At this I tried to play the\r\n  boy,—imitated my companions in everything, and tried to surpass them\r\n  in wildness. In this I succeeded. There was no tree or building too\r\n  high for me to reach its top. I took great delight in soldiers. I\r\n  avoided girls more, because I did not wish to play with their\r\n  play-things; and it always annoyed me that they treated me so much\r\n  like one of themselves.\r\n\r\n  “In the society of mature people, however, I was always modest, and,\r\n  also, always regarded with favor. Fantastic dreams about wild\r\n  animals—which once drove me out of bed without waking me—frequently\r\n  troubled me. I was always very simply, but very elegantly, dressed,\r\n  and thus developed a taste for beautiful clothing. It seems peculiar\r\n  to me that, from the time of my school-days, I had a partiality for\r\n  ladies’ gloves, which I put on secretly as often as I could. Thus,\r\n  when once my mother was about to give away a pair of gloves, I made\r\n  great opposition to it, and told her, when she asked why I acted so,\r\n  that I wanted them myself. I was laughed at; and from that time I took\r\n  good care not to display my preference for female things. Yet my\r\n  delight in them was very great. I took especial pleasure in masquerade\r\n  costumes,—_i.e._, only in female attire. If I saw them, I envied their\r\n  owners. What seemed to me the prettiest sight was: two young men,\r\n  beautifully dressed as white ladies, with masks on; and yet I would\r\n  not have shown myself to others as a girl for anything; I was so\r\n  afraid of being ridiculed. At school I worked very hard, and was\r\n  always among the first. From childhood my parents taught me that duty\r\n  came first; and they always set me an example. It was also a pleasure\r\n  for me to attend school; for the teachers were kind, and the elder\r\n  scholars did not plague the younger ones. We left my first home; for\r\n  my father was compelled, on account of his business,—which was dear to\r\n  him,—to separate from his family for a year. We moved to Germany. Here\r\n  there was a stricter, rougher manner, partly in teachers and partly in\r\n  scholars; and I was again ridiculed on account of my girlishness. My\r\n  school-mates went so far as to give a girl, who had exactly my\r\n  features, my name, and me hers; so that I hated the girl. But I later\r\n  came to be on terms of friendship with her after her marriage. My\r\n  mother tried to dress me elegantly; but this was repugnant to me,\r\n  because it made me the object of joke. So, finally, I was delighted\r\n  when I had correct trousers and coats. But with these came a new\r\n  annoyance. They irritated my genitals, particularly when the cloth was\r\n  rough; and the touch of tailors while measuring me, on account of\r\n  their tickling, which almost convulsed me, was unendurable,\r\n  particularly about the genitals. Then I had to practice gymnastics;\r\n  and I simply could do nothing at all, or only indifferently the things\r\n  that girls cannot do easily. While bathing I was troubled by feeling\r\n  ashamed to undress; but I liked to bathe. Until my twelfth year I had\r\n  a great weakness in my back. I learned to swim late, but ultimately so\r\n  well that I took long swims. At thirteen I had pubic hair, and was\r\n  about six feet tall; but my face was feminine until my eighteenth\r\n  year, when my beard came in abundance and gave me rest from\r\n  resemblance to woman. An inguinal hernia that was acquired in my\r\n  twelfth year, and cured when I was twenty, gave me much trouble,\r\n  particularly in gymnastics. Besides, from my twelfth year on, I had,\r\n  after sitting long, and particularly while working at night, an\r\n  itching, burning, and twitching, extending from the penis to my back,\r\n  which the acts of sitting and standing increased, and which was made\r\n  worse by catching cold. But I had no suspicion whatever that this\r\n  could be connected with the genitals. Since none of my friends\r\n  suffered in this way, it seemed strange to me; and it required the\r\n  greatest patience to endure it; the more owing to the fact that my\r\n  abdomen troubled me.\r\n\r\n  “In _sexualibus_ I was still perfectly innocent; but now, as at the\r\n  age of twelve or thirteen, I had a definite feeling of preferring to\r\n  be a young lady. A young lady’s form was more pleasing to me; her\r\n  quiet manner, her deportment, but particularly her attire, attracted\r\n  me. But I was careful not to allow this to be noticed; and yet, I am\r\n  sure that I should not have shrunk from the castration-knife, could I\r\n  have thus attained my desire. If I had been asked to say why I\r\n  preferred female attire, I could have said nothing more than that it\r\n  attracted me powerfully; perhaps, too, I seemed to myself, on account\r\n  of my uncommonly white skin, more like a girl. The skin of my face and\r\n  hands, particularly, was very sensitive. Girls liked my society; and,\r\n  though I should have preferred to have been with them constantly, I\r\n  avoided them when I could; for I had to exaggerate in order not to\r\n  appear feminine. In my heart I always envied them. I was particularly\r\n  envious when one of my young girl friends got long dresses and wore\r\n  gloves and veils. When, at the age of fifteen, I was on a journey, a\r\n  young lady, with whom I was boarding, proposed that I mask as a lady\r\n  and go out with her; but, owing to the fact that she was not alone, I\r\n  did not acquiesce, much as I should have liked it. Others stood on\r\n  very little ceremony with me. While on this journey, I was pleased at\r\n  seeing boys in one city wearing blouses with short sleeves, and the\r\n  arms bare. A lady elaborately dressed was like a goddess to me; and if\r\n  even her hand touched me coldly I was happy and envious, and only too\r\n  gladly would have put myself in her place in the beautiful garments\r\n  and lovely form. Nevertheless, I studied assiduously, and passed\r\n  through the Realschule and the Gymnasium in nine years, passing a good\r\n  final examination. I remember, when fifteen, to have first expressed\r\n  to a friend the wish to be a girl. In answer to his question, I could\r\n  not give the reason why. At seventeen I got into fast society; I drank\r\n  beer, smoked, and tried to joke with waiter-girls. The latter liked my\r\n  society, but they always treated me as if I wore petticoats. I could\r\n  not take dancing lessons, they repelled me so; but if I could have\r\n  gone as a mask, it would have been different. My friends loved me\r\n  dearly; I hated only one, who seduced me into onanism. Shame on those\r\n  days, which injured me for life! I practiced it quite frequently, but\r\n  in it seemed to myself like a double man. I cannot describe the\r\n  feeling; I think it was masculine, but mixed with feminine elements. I\r\n  could not approach girls; I feared them, but they were not strange to\r\n  me. They impressed me as being more like myself; I envied them. I\r\n  would have denied myself all pleasures if, after my classes, at home I\r\n  could have been a girl and thus have gone out. Crinoline and a\r\n  smoothly-fitting glove were my ideals. With every lady’s gown I saw I\r\n  fancied how I should feel in it,—_i.e._, as a lady. I had no\r\n  inclination toward men. But I remember that I was somewhat lovingly\r\n  attached to a very handsome friend with a girl’s face and dark hair,\r\n  though I think I had no other wish than that we both might be girls.\r\n\r\n  “At the high-school I finally once had coitus; hoc modo sensi, me\r\n  libentius sub puella concubuisse et penem meum cum cunno mutatum\r\n  maluisse. To my astonishment, too, the girl had to treat me as a girl,\r\n  and did it willingly; but she treated me as if I were she (she was\r\n  still quite inexperienced, and, therefore, did not laugh at me).\r\n\r\n  “When a student, at times I was wild, but I always felt that I assumed\r\n  this wildness as a mask. I drank and duelled, but I could not take\r\n  lessons in dancing, because I was afraid of betraying myself. My\r\n  friendships were close, but without other thoughts. It pleased me most\r\n  to have a friend masked as a lady, or to study the ladies’ costumes at\r\n  a ball. I understood such things perfectly. Gradually I began to feel\r\n  like a girl.\r\n\r\n  “On account of unhappy circumstances, I twice attempted suicide.\r\n  Without any cause I once slept fourteen days, had many hallucinations\r\n  (visual and auditory at the same time), and was with both the living\r\n  and the dead. The latter habit of thought remains. I also had a friend\r\n  (a lady) who knew my hobby and put on my gloves for me; but she always\r\n  looked upon me as a girl. Thus I understood women better than other\r\n  men did, and in what they differed from men; so I was always treated\r\n  _more feminarum_,—as if they had found in me a female friend. On the\r\n  whole, I could not endure obscenity, and indulged in it myself only\r\n  out of braggadocio when it was necessary. I soon overcame my aversion\r\n  to foul odors and blood, and even liked them. I was wanting in only\r\n  one respect: I could not understand my own condition. I knew that I\r\n  had feminine inclinations, but believed that I was a man. Yet I doubt\r\n  whether, with the exception of the attempts at coitus, which never\r\n  gave me pleasure (which I ascribe to onanism), I ever admired a woman\r\n  without wishing I were she; or without asking myself whether I should\r\n  not like to be the woman, or be in her attire. Obstetrics I learned\r\n  with difficulty (I was ashamed for the exposed girls, and had a\r\n  feeling of pity for them); and even now I have to overcome a feeling\r\n  of fright in obstetrical cases; indeed, it has happened that I thought\r\n  I felt the traction myself. After filling several positions\r\n  successfully as a physician, I went through a military campaign as a\r\n  volunteer surgeon. Riding, which, while a student, was painful to me,\r\n  because in it the genitals had more of a feminine feeling, was\r\n  difficult for me (it would have been easier in the female style).\r\n\r\n  “Still, I always thought I was a man with obscure masculine feeling;\r\n  and whenever I associated with ladies, I was still soon treated as an\r\n  inexperienced lady. When I wore a uniform for the first time, I should\r\n  have much preferred to have slipped into a lady’s costume, with a\r\n  veil; I was disturbed when the stately uniform attracted attention. In\r\n  private practice I was successful in the three principal branches.\r\n  Then I made another military campaign; and during this I came to\r\n  understand my nature; for I think that, since the first ass, no beast\r\n  of burden has ever had to endure with so much patience as I have.\r\n  Decorations were not wanting, but I was indifferent to them.\r\n\r\n  “Thus I went through life, such as it was, never satisfied with\r\n  myself, full of dissatisfaction with the world, and vacillating\r\n  between sentimentality and a wildness that was for the most part\r\n  affected.\r\n\r\n  “My experience as a candidate for matrimony was very peculiar. I\r\n  should have preferred not to marry, but family circumstances and\r\n  practice forced me to it. I married an energetic, amiable lady, of a\r\n  family in which female government was rampant. I was in love with her\r\n  as much as one of us can be in love,—_i.e._, what we love we love with\r\n  our whole hearts, and live in it, even though we do not show it as\r\n  much as a genuine man does. We love our brides with all the love of a\r\n  woman, almost as a woman might love her bridegroom. But I cannot say\r\n  this for myself; for I still believed that I was but a depressed man,\r\n  who would come to himself, and find himself out by marriage. But, even\r\n  on my marriage-night, I felt that I was only a woman in man’s form;\r\n  sub femina locum meum esse mihi visum est. On the whole, we lived\r\n  contented and happy, and for two years were childless. After a\r\n  difficult pregnancy, during which I was in mortal fear of death, the\r\n  first boy was born in a difficult labor,—a boy on whom a melancholy\r\n  nature still hangs; who is still of melancholy disposition. Then came\r\n  a second, who is very quiet; a third, full of peculiarities; a fourth,\r\n  a fifth; and all have predisposition to neurasthenia. Since I always\r\n  felt out of my own place, I went much in gay society; but I always\r\n  worked as much as human strength would allow. I studied and operated;\r\n  and I experimented with many drugs and methods of cure, always on\r\n  myself. I left the regulation of the house to my wife, as she\r\n  understood house-keeping very well. My marital duties I performed as\r\n  well as I could, but without personal satisfaction. Since the first\r\n  coitus, the masculine position in it has been repugnant, and, too,\r\n  difficult for me. I should have much preferred to have the other\r\n  _rôle_. When I had to deliver my wife, it almost broke my heart; for I\r\n  knew how to appreciate her pain. Thus we lived long together, until\r\n  severe gout drove me to various baths, and made me neurasthenic. At\r\n  the same time, I became so anæmic that every few months I had to take\r\n  iron for some time; otherwise I would be almost chlorotic or\r\n  hysterical, or both. Stenocardia often troubled me; then came\r\n  unilateral cramps of chin, nose, neck, and larynx; hemicrania and\r\n  cramps of the diaphragm and chest-muscles. For about three years I had\r\n  a feeling as if the prostate were enlarged,—a bearing-down feeling, as\r\n  if giving birth to something; and, also, pain in the hips, constant\r\n  pain in the back, and the like. Yet, with the strength of despair, I\r\n  fought against these complaints, which impressed me as being female or\r\n  effeminate, until three years ago, when a severe attack of arthritis\r\n  completely broke me down.\r\n\r\n  “But before this terrible attack of gout occurred, in despair, to\r\n  lessen the pain of gout, I had taken hot baths, as near the\r\n  temperature of the body as possible. On one of these occasions it\r\n  happened that I suddenly changed, and seemed to be near death. I\r\n  sprang with all my remaining strength out of the bath: I had felt\r\n  exactly like a woman with libido. Too, at the time when the extract of\r\n  Indian hemp came into vogue, and was highly prized, in a state of fear\r\n  of a threatened attack of gout (feeling perfectly indifferent about\r\n  life), I took three or four times the usual dose of it, and almost\r\n  died of haschisch poisoning. Convulsive laughter, a feeling of unheard\r\n  of strength and swiftness, a peculiar feeling in brain and eyes,\r\n  millions of sparks streaming from the brain through the skin,—all\r\n  these feelings occurred. But I could not force myself to speak. All at\r\n  once I saw myself a woman from my toes to my breast; I felt, as before\r\n  while in the bath, that the genitals had shrunken, the pelvis\r\n  broadened, the breasts swollen out; a feeling of unspeakable delight\r\n  came over me. I closed my eyes, so that at least I did not see the\r\n  face changed. My physician looked as if he had a gigantic potatoe\r\n  instead of a head; my wife had the full moon on her nates. And yet I\r\n  was strong enough to briefly record my will in my note-book when both\r\n  left the room for a short time.\r\n\r\n  “But who could describe my fright, when, on the next morning, I awoke\r\n  and found myself feeling as if completely changed into a woman; and\r\n  when, on standing and walking, I felt vulva and mammæ! When at last I\r\n  raised myself out of bed, I felt that a complete transformation had\r\n  taken place in me. During my sickness a visitor said: ‘He is too\r\n  patient for a man.’ And the visitor gave me a plant in bloom, which\r\n  seemed strange, but pleased me. From that time I was patient, and\r\n  would do nothing in a hurry; but I became tenacious, like a cat,\r\n  though, at the same time, mild, forgiving, and no longer bearing\r\n  enmity,—in short, I had a woman’s disposition. During the last\r\n  sickness I had many visual and auditory hallucinations,—spoke with the\r\n  dead, etc.; saw and heard familiar spirits; felt like a double person;\r\n  but, while lying ill, I did not notice that the man in me had been\r\n  extinguished. The change in my disposition was a piece of good fortune\r\n  which came over me like lightning, and which, had it come with me\r\n  feeling as I formerly did, would have killed me; but now I gave myself\r\n  up to it, and no longer recognized myself. Owing to the fact that I\r\n  still often confounded neurasthenic symptoms with the gout, I took\r\n  many baths, until an itching of the skin with the feeling of scabies,\r\n  instead of being diminished, was so increased that I gave up all\r\n  external treatment (I was made more and more anæmic by the baths), and\r\n  hardened myself as best I could. But the imperative female feeling\r\n  remained, and became so strong that I wear only the mask of a man, and\r\n  in everything else feel like a woman; and gradually I have lost memory\r\n  of the former individuality. What was left of me from the gout, the\r\n  influenza ruined entirely.\r\n\r\n  “_Present Condition_: I am tall, slightly bald, and the beard is\r\n  growing gray. I begin to stoop. Since having the influenza, I have\r\n  lost about a quarter of my strength. Owing to a valvular lesion, my\r\n  face looks somewhat red; full beard; chronic conjunctivitis; more\r\n  muscular than fat. The left foot seems to be developing varicose\r\n  veins, and it often goes to sleep; but it is not really thickened,\r\n  though it seems to be.\r\n\r\n  “The mammary region, though small, swells out perceptibly. The abdomen\r\n  is feminine in form; the feet are placed like a woman’s, and the\r\n  calves, etc., are feminine; and it is the same with arms and hands. I\r\n  can wear ladies’ hose, and gloves, 7½ to 7¾ in size. I also wear a\r\n  corset without annoyance. My weight varies between 168 and 184 pounds.\r\n  Urine without albumen or sugar, but it contains an excess of uric\r\n  acid. But if there is not too much uric acid in it, it is clear, and\r\n  almost as clear as water after any excitement. Bowels usually regular;\r\n  but should they not be, then come all the symptoms of female\r\n  obstipation. Sleep is poor,—for weeks at a time only two or three\r\n  hours long. Appetite quite good; but, on the whole, my stomach will\r\n  not bear more than that of a strong woman, and reacts to irritating\r\n  food with cutaneous eruption and burning in the urethra. The skin is\r\n  white, and, for the most part, feels quite smooth; there has been\r\n  unbearable cutaneous itching for the last two years; but during the\r\n  last few weeks it has diminished, and is now present only in the\r\n  popliteal spaces and on the scrotum.\r\n\r\n  “Tendency to perspire. Perspiration was previously as good as wanting,\r\n  but now there are all the odious peculiarities of the female\r\n  perspiration, particularly about the lower part of the body; so that I\r\n  have to keep myself cleaner than a woman. (I perfume my handkerchief,\r\n  and use perfumed soap and _eau-de-Cologne_.)\r\n\r\n  “_General Feeling_: I feel like a woman in a man’s form; and even\r\n  though I often am sensible of the man’s form, yet it is always in a\r\n  feminine sense. Thus, for example, I feel the penis as clitoris; the\r\n  urethra as urethra and vaginal orifice, which always feels a little\r\n  wet, even when it is actually dry; the scrotum as labia majora; in\r\n  short, I always feel the vulva. And all that that means one alone can\r\n  know who feels or has felt so. But the skin all over my body feels\r\n  feminine; it receives all impressions, whether of touch, of warmth, or\r\n  whether unfriendly, as feminine, and I have the sensations of a woman.\r\n  I cannot go with bare hands, as both heat and cold trouble me. When\r\n  the time is past when we men are permitted to carry sun-umbrellas, I\r\n  have to endure great sensitiveness of the skin of my face, until\r\n  sun-umbrellas can again be used. On awaking in the morning, I am\r\n  confused for a few moments, as if I were seeking for myself; then the\r\n  imperative feeling of being a woman awakens. I feel the sense of the\r\n  vulva (that one is there), and always greet the day with a soft or\r\n  loud sigh; for I have fear again of the play that must be carried on\r\n  throughout the day. I had to learn everything anew; the\r\n  knife—apparatus, everything—has felt different for the last three\r\n  years; and with the change of muscular sense I had to learn everything\r\n  over again. I have been successful, and only the use of the saw and\r\n  bone-chisel are difficult; it is almost as if my strength were not\r\n  quite sufficient. On the other hand, I have a keener sense of touch in\r\n  working with the curette in the soft parts. It is unpleasant that, in\r\n  examining ladies, I often feel their sensations; but this, indeed,\r\n  does not repel them. The most unpleasant thing I experience is fœtal\r\n  movement. For a long time—several months—I was troubled by reading the\r\n  thoughts of both sexes, and I still have to fight against it. I can\r\n  endure it better with women; with men it is repugnant. Three years ago\r\n  I had not yet consciously seen the world with a woman’s eyes; this\r\n  change in the relation of the eyes to the brain came almost suddenly,\r\n  with violent headache. I was with a lady whose sexual feeling was\r\n  reversed, when suddenly I saw her changed in the sense I now feel\r\n  myself,—viz., she as man,—and I felt myself a woman in contrast with\r\n  her; so that I left her with ill-concealed vexation. At that time she\r\n  had not yet come to understand her own condition perfectly.\r\n\r\n  “Since then, all my sensory impressions are as if they were feminine\r\n  in form and relation. The cerebral system almost immediately adjusted\r\n  itself to the vegetative; so that all my ailments were manifested in a\r\n  feminine way. The sensitiveness of all nerves, particularly that of\r\n  the auditory and olfactory and trigeminal, increased to a condition of\r\n  nervousness. If only a window slammed, I was frightened inwardly; for\r\n  a man dare not tremble at such things. If food is not absolutely\r\n  fresh, I perceive a cadaverous odor. I could never depend on the\r\n  trigeminus; for the pain would jump whimsically from one branch of it\r\n  to another; from a tooth to an eye. But, since my transformation, I\r\n  bear toothache and migraine more easily, and have less feeling of fear\r\n  with stenocardia. It seems to me a strange fact that I feel myself to\r\n  be a fearful, weak being, and yet, when danger threatens, I am much\r\n  rather cool and collected; and this is true in dangerous operations.\r\n  The stomach rebels against the slightest indiscretion (in female diet)\r\n  that is committed without thought of the female nature, either by\r\n  ructus or other symptoms; but particularly against abuse of\r\n  alcoholics. The indisposition after intoxication that a man who feels\r\n  like a woman experiences is much worse than any a student could get\r\n  up. It seems to me almost as if one feeling like a woman were entirely\r\n  controlled by the vegetative system.\r\n\r\n  “Small as my nipples are, they demand room, and I feel them as mammæ;\r\n  just as during the beginning of puberty, the nipples swelled and\r\n  pained. On this account, the white shirt, the waistcoat, and the coat\r\n  trouble me. I feel as though the pelvis were female; and it is the\r\n  same with the anus and nates. At first the sense of a female abdomen\r\n  was troublesome to me; for it cannot bear trousers, and it always\r\n  possesses or induces the feminine feeling. I also have the imperative\r\n  feeling of a waist. It is as if I were robbed of my own skin, and put\r\n  in a woman’s skin that fitted me perfectly, but which felt everything\r\n  as if it covered a woman; and whose sensations passed through the\r\n  man’s body, and exterminated the masculine element. The testes, even\r\n  though not atrophied or degenerated, are still no longer testes, and\r\n  often cause me pain, with the feeling that they belong in the abdomen,\r\n  and should be fastened there; and their mobility often bothers me.\r\n\r\n  “Every four weeks, at the time of the full moon, I have the molimen of\r\n  a woman for five days, physically and mentally, only I do not bleed;\r\n  but I have the feeling of a loss of fluid; a feeling that the genitals\r\n  and abdomen are (internally) swollen. A very pleasant period comes\r\n  when, afterward and later in the interval for a day or two, the\r\n  physiological desire for procreation comes, which with all power\r\n  permeates the woman. My whole body is then filled with this sensation,\r\n  as an immersed piece of sugar is filled with water, or as full as a\r\n  soaked sponge. It is like this: first, a woman longing for love, and\r\n  then, for a man; and, in fact, the desire, as it seems to me, is more\r\n  a longing to be possessed than a wish for coitus. The intense natural\r\n  instinct or the feminine concupiscence overcomes the feeling of\r\n  modesty, so that indirectly coitus is desired. I have never felt\r\n  coitus in a masculine way more than three times in my life; and even\r\n  if it were so in general, I was always indifferent about it. But,\r\n  during the last three years, I have experienced it passively, like a\r\n  woman; in fact, oftentimes with the feeling of feminine ejaculation;\r\n  and I always feel that I am impregnated. I am always fatigued as a\r\n  woman is after it, and often feel ill, as a man never does. Sometimes\r\n  it caused me so great pleasure that there is nothing with which I can\r\n  compare it; it is the most blissful and powerful feeling in the world;\r\n  at that moment the woman is simply a vulva that has devoured the whole\r\n  person.\r\n\r\n  “During the last three years I have never lost for an instant the\r\n  feeling of being a woman, and now, owing to habit, this is no longer\r\n  annoying to me, though during this period I have felt debased; for a\r\n  man could endure to feel like a woman without a desire for enjoyment;\r\n  but when desires come! The happiness ceases; then come the burning,\r\n  the heat, the feeling of turgor of the genitals (when the penis is not\r\n  in a state of erection the genitals do not play any part). In case of\r\n  intense desire, the feeling of sucking in the vagina and vulva is\r\n  really terrible—a hellish pain of lust hardly to be endured. If I then\r\n  have opportunity to perform coitus, it is better; but, owing to\r\n  defective sense of being possessed by the other, it does not afford\r\n  complete satisfaction; the feeling of sterility comes with its weight\r\n  of shame, added to the feeling of passive copulation and injured\r\n  modesty. I seem almost like a prostitute. Reason does not give any\r\n  help; the imperative feeling of femininity dominates and rules\r\n  everything. The difficulty in carrying on one’s occupation, under such\r\n  circumstances, is easily appreciated; but it is possible to force\r\n  one’s self to it. Of course, it is almost impossible to sit, walk, or\r\n  lie down; at least, any one of these cannot be endured long; and with\r\n  the constant touch of the trousers, etc., it is unendurable.\r\n\r\n  “Marriage then, except during coitus, where the man has to feel\r\n  himself a woman, is like two women living together, one of whom\r\n  regards herself as in the mask of a man. If the periodical molimen\r\n  fail to occur, then come the feelings of pregnancy or of sexual\r\n  satiety, which a man never experiences, but which take possession of\r\n  the whole being, just as the feeling of femininity does, and are\r\n  repugnant in themselves; and, therefore, I gladly welcome the regular\r\n  molimen again. When erotic dreams or ideas occur, I see myself in the\r\n  form I have as a woman, and see erected organs presenting. Since the\r\n  anus feels feminine, it would not be hard to become a passive\r\n  pederast; only positive religious command prevents it, as all other\r\n  deterrent ideas would be overcome. Since such conditions are\r\n  repugnant, as they would be to any one, I have a desire to be sexless,\r\n  or to make myself sexless. If I had been single, I should long ago\r\n  have taken leave of testes, scrotum, and penis.\r\n\r\n  “Of what use is female pleasure, when one does not conceive? What good\r\n  comes from excitation of female love, when one has only a wife for\r\n  gratification, even though copulation is felt as though it were with a\r\n  man? What a terrible feeling of shame is caused by the feminine\r\n  perspiration! How the feeling for dress and ornament lowers a man!\r\n  Even in his changed form, even when he can no longer recall the\r\n  masculine sexual feeling, he would not wish to be forced to feel like\r\n  a woman. He still knows very well that, before, he did not constantly\r\n  feel sexually; that he was merely a human being uninfluenced by sex.\r\n  Now, suddenly, he has to regard his former individuality as a mask,\r\n  and constantly feel like a woman, only having a change when, every\r\n  four weeks, he has his periodical sickness, and in the intervals his\r\n  insatiable female desire. If he could but awake without immediately\r\n  being forced to feel like a woman! At last he longs for a moment in\r\n  which he might raise his mask; but that moment does not come. He can\r\n  only find amelioration of his misery when he can put on some bit of\r\n  female attire or finery, an under-garment, etc.; for he dare not go\r\n  about as a woman. To be compelled to fulfill all the duties of a\r\n  calling with the feeling of being a woman costumed as a man, and to\r\n  see no end of it, is no trifle. Religion alone saves from a great\r\n  lapse; but it does not prevent the pain when temptation affects the\r\n  man who feels as a woman; and so it must be felt and endured! When a\r\n  respectable man who enjoys an unusual degree of public confidence, and\r\n  possesses authority, must go about with his vulva—imaginary though it\r\n  be; when one, leaving his arduous daily task, is compelled to examine\r\n  the _toilette_ of the first lady he meets, and criticise her with\r\n  feminine eyes, and read her thoughts in her face; when a journal of\r\n  fashions possesses an interest equal to that of a scientific work (I\r\n  felt this as a child); when one must conceal his condition from his\r\n  wife, whose thoughts, the moment he feels like a woman, he can read in\r\n  her face, while it becomes perfectly clear to her that he has changed\r\n  in body and soul,—what must all this be? The misery caused by the\r\n  feminine gentleness that must be overcome! Oftentimes, of course, when\r\n  I am away alone, it is possible to live for a time more like a woman;\r\n  for example, to wear female attire, especially at night, to keep\r\n  gloves on, or to wear a veil or a mask in my room, so that thus there\r\n  is rest from excessive libido. But when the feminine feeling has once\r\n  gained an entrance, it imperatively demands recognition. It is often\r\n  satisfied with a moderate concession, such as the wearing of a\r\n  bracelet above the cuff; but it imperatively demands some concession.\r\n  My only happiness is to see myself dressed as a woman without a\r\n  feeling of shame; indeed, when my face is veiled or masked, I prefer\r\n  it so, and thus think of myself. Like every one of Fashion’s fools, I\r\n  have a taste for the prevailing mode; so greatly am I transformed. To\r\n  become accustomed to the thought of feeling only like a woman, and\r\n  only to remember the previous manner of thought to a certain extent in\r\n  contrast with it; and, at the same time, to express one’s self as a\r\n  man,—it requires a long time and an infinite amount of persistence.\r\n\r\n  “Nevertheless, in spite of everything, it will happen that I betray\r\n  myself by some expression of feminine feeling, either in _sexualibus_,\r\n  when I say that I feel so and so, expressing what a man without the\r\n  female feeling cannot know; or when I accidentally betray that female\r\n  attire is my talent. Before women, of course, this does not amount to\r\n  anything; for a woman is greatly flattered when a man understands\r\n  something of her matters; but this must not be displayed to my own\r\n  wife. How frightened I once was when my wife said to a friend that I\r\n  had great taste in ladies’ dress! How a haughty, stylish lady was\r\n  astonished when, as she was about to make a great error in the\r\n  education of her little daughter, I described to her in writing and\r\n  verbally all the feminine feelings! To be sure, I lied to her, saying\r\n  that my knowledge had been gleaned from letters. But her confidence in\r\n  me is as great as ever; and the child, who was on the road to\r\n  insanity, is rational and happy. She had confessed all the feminine\r\n  inclinations as sins; now she knows what, as a girl, she must bear and\r\n  control by will and religion; and she feels that she is human. Both\r\n  ladies would laugh heartily, if they knew that I had only drawn on my\r\n  own sad experience. I must also add that I now have a finer sense of\r\n  temperature and, besides, a sense of the elasticity of the skin and\r\n  tension of the intestines, etc., in patients, that was unknown to me\r\n  before; that in operations and autopsies, poisonous fluids more\r\n  readily penetrate my (uninjured) skin. Every autopsy causes me pain;\r\n  examination of a prostitute, or a woman having a discharge, a\r\n  cancerous odor, or the like, is actually repugnant to me. In all\r\n  respects I am now under the influence of antipathy and sympathy, from\r\n  the sense of color to my judgment of a person. Women usually see in\r\n  each other the periodical sexual disposition; and, therefore, a lady\r\n  wears a veil, if she is not always accustomed to wear one, and usually\r\n  she perfumes herself, even though it be only with handkerchief or\r\n  gloves; for her olfactory sense in relation to her own sex is intense.\r\n  Odors have an incredible effect on the female organism; thus, for\r\n  example, the odors of violets and roses quiet me, while others disgust\r\n  me; and with ihlang-ihlang I cannot contain myself for sexual\r\n  excitement. Contact with a woman seems homogeneous to me; coitus with\r\n  my wife seems possible to me because she is somewhat masculine, and\r\n  has a firm skin; and yet it is more an _amor lesbicus_.\r\n\r\n  “Besides, I always feel passive. Often at night, when I cannot sleep\r\n  for excitement, it is finally accomplished, si femora mea distensa\r\n  habeo, sicut mulier cum viro concumbens, or if I lie on my side; but\r\n  an arm or the bed-clothing must not touch the mammæ, or there is no\r\n  sleep; and there must be no pressure on the abdomen. I sleep best in a\r\n  chemise and night-robe, and with gloves on; for my hands easily get\r\n  cold. I am also comfortable in female drawers and petticoats, because\r\n  they do not touch the genitals. I liked female dresses best when\r\n  crinoline was worn. Female dresses do not annoy the feminine-feeling\r\n  man; for he, like every woman, feels them as belonging to his person,\r\n  and not as something foreign.\r\n\r\n  “My dearest associate is a lady suffering with neurasthenia, who,\r\n  since her last confinement, feels like a man, but who, since I\r\n  explained these feelings to her, coitu abstinet as much as possible, a\r\n  thing I, as a husband, dare not do. She, by her example, helps me to\r\n  endure my condition. She has a more perfect memory of the female\r\n  feelings, and has often given me good advice. Were she a man and I a\r\n  young girl, I should seek to win her; for her I should be glad to\r\n  endure the fate of a woman. But her present appearance is quite\r\n  different from what it formerly was. She is a very elegantly dressed\r\n  gentleman, notwithstanding bosom and hair; she also speaks quickly and\r\n  concisely, and no longer takes pleasure in the things that please me.\r\n  She has a kind of melancholy dissatisfaction with the world, but she\r\n  bears her fate worthily and with resignation, finding her comfort only\r\n  in religion and the fulfillment of duty. At the time of the menses,\r\n  she almost dies. She no longer likes female society and conversation,\r\n  and has no liking for delicacies.\r\n\r\n  “A youthful friend felt like a girl from the very first, but he had\r\n  inclinations toward the male sex. His sister had the opposite\r\n  condition; and when the uterus demanded its right, and she saw herself\r\n  as a loving woman, in spite of her masculinity, she cut the matter\r\n  short, and committed suicide by drowning.\r\n\r\n  “Since complete effemination, the principal changes I have observed in\r\n  myself are:—\r\n\r\n  “1. The constant feeling of being a woman from top to toe.\r\n\r\n  “2. The constant feeling of having female genitals.\r\n\r\n  “3. The periodicity of the monthly molimen.\r\n\r\n  “4. The regular occurrence of female desire, though not directed to\r\n  any particular man.\r\n\r\n  “5. The passive female feeling in coitus.\r\n\r\n  “6. After that, the feeling of impregnation.\r\n\r\n  “7. The female feeling in thought of coitus.\r\n\r\n  “8. At the sight of women, the feeling of being of their kind, and the\r\n  feminine interest in them.\r\n\r\n  “9. At the sight of men, the feminine interest in them.\r\n\r\n  “10. At the sight of children, the same feeling.\r\n\r\n  “11. The changed disposition and much greater patience.\r\n\r\n  “12. The final resignation to my fate, for which I have nothing to\r\n  thank but positive religion; without it I should have long ago\r\n  committed suicide.\r\n\r\n  “To be a man and to be compelled to feel that chaque femme est futuée\r\n  ou elle désire d’être, is hardly to be endured.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing autobiography, scientifically so important, was\r\naccompanied by the following no less interesting letter:—\r\n\r\n  “SIR: I must next beg your indulgence for troubling you with my\r\n  communication. I lost all control, and thought of myself only as a\r\n  monster before which I myself shuddered. Then your work gave me\r\n  courage again; and I determined to go to the bottom of the matter, and\r\n  examine my past life, let the result be what it might. It seemed a\r\n  duty of gratitude to you to tell you the result of my recollection and\r\n  observation, since I had not seen any description by you of an\r\n  analogous case; and, finally, I also thought it might perhaps interest\r\n  you to learn, from the pen of a physician, how such a worthless human,\r\n  or masculine, being thinks and feels under the weight of the\r\n  imperative idea of being a woman.\r\n\r\n  “It is not perfect; but I no longer have the strength to reflect more\r\n  upon it, and have no desire to go into the matter more deeply. Much is\r\n  repeated; but I beg you to remember that any mask may be allowed to\r\n  fall off, particularly when it is not voluntarily worn, but enforced.\r\n\r\n  “After reading your work, I hope that, if I fulfill my duties as\r\n  physician, citizen, father, and husband, I may still count myself\r\n  among human beings who do not deserve merely to be despised.\r\n\r\n  “Finally, I wished to lay the result of my recollection and reflection\r\n  before you, in order to show that one thinking and feeling like a\r\n  woman can still be a physician. I consider it a great injustice to\r\n  debar woman from Medicine. A woman, through her feeling, gets on the\r\n  track of many ailments which, in spite of all skill in diagnosis,\r\n  remain obscure to a man; at least, in the diseases of women and\r\n  children. If I could have my way, I should have every physician live\r\n  the life of a woman for three months; then he would have a better\r\n  understanding and more consideration in matters affecting the half of\r\n  humanity from which he comes; then he would learn to value the\r\n  greatness of women, and appreciate the difficulty of their lot.”\r\n\r\n  _Remarks_: The badly-tainted patient is originally psycho-sexually\r\n  abnormal, in that, in character and in the sexual act, he feels as a\r\n  female. This abnormal feeling remained purely a psychical anomaly\r\n  until three years ago, when, owing to severe neurasthenia, it received\r\n  overmastering support in imperative bodily sensations of a\r\n  _transmutatio sexus_, which now dominate consciousness. Then, to the\r\n  patient’s horror, he felt bodily like a woman; and, under the impulse\r\n  of his imperative feminine sensations, he experienced a complete\r\n  transformation of his former masculine feeling, thought, and will; in\r\n  fact, of his whole vita sexualis, in the sense of eviration. At the\r\n  same time, his ego is able to control these abnormal psycho-physical\r\n  manifestations, and prevent descent to paranoia,—a remarkable example\r\n  of imperative feelings and ideas on the basis of neurotic taint, which\r\n  is of great value for a comprehension of the way in which the\r\n  psycho-sexual transformation may be accomplished.\r\n\r\n_IV. Degree: Metamorphosis Sexualis Paranoica._—A final possible stage\r\nin this disease-process is the delusion of a transformation of sex. It\r\narises on the basis of sexual neurasthenia that has developed into\r\nneurasthenia universalis, resulting in a mental disease,—paranoia.\r\n\r\nThe following cases show the development of the interesting\r\nneuro-psychological process to its height:—\r\n\r\n  Case 100. K., aged 36, single, servant, received at the clinic on\r\n  February 26, 1889, is a typical case of paranoia persecutoria,\r\n  resulting from neurasthenia sexualis, with olfactory hallucinations,\r\n  sensations, etc. He comes of a predisposed family. Several brothers\r\n  and sisters were psychopathic. Patient has an hydrocephalic skull,\r\n  depressed in the region of the right fontanelle; eyes neuropathic. He\r\n  has always been very sensual; began to masturbate at nineteen; had\r\n  coitus at twenty-three; begat three illegitimate children. He gave up\r\n  further sexual intercourse, on account of fear of begetting more\r\n  children, and of being unable to provide for them. Abstinence proved\r\n  very painful to him. He also gave up masturbation, and was then\r\n  troubled with pollutions. A year and a half ago he became sexually\r\n  neurasthenic, had diurnal pollutions, became thereafter ill and\r\n  miserable, and, after a time, generally neurasthenic, finally\r\n  developing paranoia. A year ago he began to have paræsthetic\r\n  sensations,—as if there were a great coil in the place of his\r\n  genitals; and then he felt that his scrotum and penis were gone, and\r\n  that his genitals were changed into those of a female. He felt the\r\n  growth of his breasts; that his hair was that of a woman; and that\r\n  feminine garments were on his body. He thought himself a woman. The\r\n  people in the street gave utterance to corresponding remarks: “Look at\r\n  the woman! The old blowhard!” In a half dreamy state, he had the\r\n  feeling as if he played the part of a woman in coitus with a man.\r\n  During it he had the most lively feelings of pleasure. During his stay\r\n  at the clinic, a remission of the paranoia occurred, and, at the same\r\n  time, a marked improvement of the neurasthenia. Then the feelings and\r\n  ideas due to a developing metamorphosis sexualis disappeared.\r\n\r\nA more advanced case of eviration, on the way to a transformatio sexus\r\nparanoica, is the following:—\r\n\r\n  Case 101. Franz St., aged 33; school-teacher; single; probably of\r\n  tainted family; always neuropathic; emotional, timid, intolerant of\r\n  alcohol; began to masturbate at eighteen. At thirty there were\r\n  manifestations of neurasthenia sexualis (pollutions with consequent\r\n  fatigue, which at last began to occur during the day; pain in the\r\n  region of the sacral plexus, etc.). Gradually, spinal irritation,\r\n  pressure in the head, and cerebral neurasthenia were added. Since the\r\n  beginning of 1885 the patient had given up coitus, in which he no\r\n  longer experienced pleasurable feeling. He masturbated frequently.\r\n\r\n  In 1888 he began to have delusions of suspicion. He noticed that he\r\n  was avoided, and that he had unpleasant odors about him (olfactory\r\n  hallucinations). In this way he explained the altered attitude of\r\n  people, and their sneezing, coughing, etc. He smelled corpses and foul\r\n  urine. He recognized the cause of his bad smells in inward pollutions.\r\n  He recognized these in a feeling he had as if a fluid flowed up from\r\n  the symphysis toward the breast. Patient soon left the clinic.\r\n\r\n  In 1889 he was again received in an advanced stage of paranoia\r\n  masturbatoria persecutoria (delusions of physical persecution).\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of May, 1889, the patient attracted notice, in that\r\n  he was cross when he was addressed as “mister.” He protested against\r\n  it, because he was a woman. Voices told him this. He noticed that his\r\n  breasts were growing. Some weeks before, others had touched him in a\r\n  sensual manner. He heard it said that he was a whore. Of late, dreams\r\n  of pregnancy. He dreamed that, as a woman, he indulged in coitus. He\r\n  felt the immissio penis, and, during the hallucinatory act, also a\r\n  feeling of ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  Head straight; facial form long and narrow; parietal eminences\r\n  prominent; genitals normally developed.\r\n\r\nThe following case, observed in the asylum at Illenau, is a pertinent\r\nexample of lasting delusional alteration of sexual consciousness:—\r\n\r\n  Case 102. _Metamorphosis Sexualis Paranoica._—N., aged 23, single,\r\n  pianist, was received in the asylum at Illenau in the last part of\r\n  October, 1865. He came of a family in which there was said to be no\r\n  hereditary taint; but it was tuberculous (father and brother died of\r\n  pulmonary tuberculosis). Patient, as a child, was weakly and dull,\r\n  though especially talented in music. He was always of abnormal\r\n  character; silent, retiring, unsocial, and sullen. He practiced\r\n  masturbation after fifteen. After a few years neurasthenic symptoms\r\n  (palpitation of the heart, lassitude, occasional pressure in the head,\r\n  etc.), and also hypochondriacal symptoms, were manifested. During the\r\n  last year he had worked with great difficulty. For about six months\r\n  neurasthenia had increased. He complained of palpitation of the heart,\r\n  pressure in the head, and sleeplessness; was very irritable, and\r\n  seemed to be sexually excited. He declared that he must marry for his\r\n  health. He fell in love with an artist, but almost at the same time\r\n  (September, 1865) he fell ill with paranoia persecutoria (ideas of\r\n  enemies, derision in the street, poison in food; obstacles were placed\r\n  on the bridges to keep him from going to his _inamorata_). On account\r\n  of increasing excitement and conflicts with those about him that he\r\n  considered inimical to him, he was taken to the asylum. At first he\r\n  presented the picture of a typical paranoia persecutoria with symptoms\r\n  of sexual, and later general, neurasthenia, though the delusions of\r\n  persecution did not rest upon this neurotic foundation. It was only\r\n  occasionally that the patient heard such sentences as this: “Now the\r\n  semen will be drawn out of him. Now the bladder will be cut out.”\r\n\r\n  In the course of the years 1866–68, the delusions of persecution\r\n  became less and less apparent, and were for the most part replaced by\r\n  erotic ideas. The somatic and mental basis was a lasting and powerful\r\n  excitation of the sexual sphere. The patient fell in love with every\r\n  woman he saw, heard voices which told him to approach her, and begged\r\n  to be allowed to marry, declaring that, if he was not given a wife, he\r\n  would waste away. With continuance of masturbation, in 1869, signs of\r\n  future effemination made themselves manifest. “He would, if he should\r\n  get a wife, love her only platonically.” The patient grows more and\r\n  more peculiar, lives in a circle of erotic ideas, sees prostitution\r\n  practiced in the asylum, and now and then hears voices which impute\r\n  immoral conduct with women to him. For this reason he avoids the\r\n  society of women, and only associates with them for the sake of music\r\n  when two witnesses are with him.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the year 1872, the neurasthenic condition became\r\n  markedly increased. Now paranoia persecutoria again comes into the\r\n  foreground, and takes on a clinical coloring from the neurotic basis.\r\n  Olfactory hallucinations occur. Magnetic influences are at work on him\r\n  (false interpretation of sensations due to spinal asthenia). With\r\n  continued and intense sexual excitement and excess in masturbation,\r\n  the process of effemination constantly progresses. Only episodically\r\n  is he a man and inclined toward a woman, complaining that the\r\n  shameless prostitution of the men in the house makes it impossible for\r\n  a lady to come to him. He is dying of magnetically poisoned air and\r\n  unsatisfied love. Without love he cannot live. He is poisoned by lewd\r\n  poison that affects his sexual desire. The lady that he loves is sunk\r\n  in the lowest vice. The prostitutes in the house have fortune-chains;\r\n  that is, chains in which, without moving, a man can indulge in lustful\r\n  pleasure. He is ready now to satisfy himself with prostitutes. He is\r\n  possessed of a wonderful ray of thought that emanates from his eyes,\r\n  which is worth twenty millions. His compositions are worth 500,000\r\n  francs. With these indications of delusions of grandeur, there are\r\n  also those of persecution—the food is poisoned by venereal excrement;\r\n  he tastes and smells poison, hears infamous accusations, and asks for\r\n  instruments to close his ears. From August, 1872, however, the signs\r\n  of effemination become more and more frequent. He acts somewhat\r\n  affected, declaring that he can no longer live among men that drink\r\n  and smoke. He thinks and feels like a woman. He must thenceforth be\r\n  treated like a woman and transferred to a female ward. He asks for\r\n  confections and delicate desserts. Occasionally, on account of\r\n  tenesmus and cystospasm, he asks to be transferred to a lying-in\r\n  hospital and treated as a woman very ill in pregnancy. The abnormal\r\n  magnetism of masculine attendants has an unfavorable effect on him. At\r\n  times he still feels himself to be a man, but in a way which indicates\r\n  his abnormally altered sexual feeling. He pleads only for satisfaction\r\n  by means of masturbation, or for marriage without coitus. Marriage is\r\n  a sensual institution. The girl that he would take for a wife must be\r\n  a masturbator. About the end of December, 1872, his personality became\r\n  completely feminine. From that time he remained a woman. He had always\r\n  been a woman, but in his babyhood a French Quaker, an artist, had put\r\n  masculine genitals on him, and by rubbing and distorting his thorax\r\n  had prevented the development of his breasts. After this he demanded\r\n  to be transferred to the female department, protection from men that\r\n  wished to violate him, and asked for female clothing. Eventually he\r\n  also desired to be given employment in a toy-shop, with crocheting and\r\n  embroidery work to do, or a place in a dress-making establishment with\r\n  female work. From the time of the transformatio sexus, the patient\r\n  begins a new reckoning of time. He conceives his previous personality\r\n  in memory as that of a cousin.\r\n\r\n  He always speaks of himself in the third person, and calls himself the\r\n  Countess V., the dearest friend of the Empress Eugenie; asks for\r\n  perfumes, corsets, etc. He takes the other men of the ward for girls,\r\n  tries to raise a head of hair, and demands “Oriental Hair-Remover,” in\r\n  order that no one may doubt his gender. He takes delight in praising\r\n  onanism, for “she had been an onanist from fifteen, and had never\r\n  desired any other kind of sexual satisfaction.” Occasionally\r\n  neurasthenic symptoms, olfactory hallucinations, and persecutory\r\n  delusions are observed. All the events up to the time of December,\r\n  1872, belong to the personality of the cousin.\r\n\r\n  The patient’s delusion that he is the Countess V. can no longer be\r\n  corrected. She proves her identity by the fact that the nurse has\r\n  examined her, and finds her to be a lady. The countess will not marry,\r\n  because she hates men. Since he is not provided with female clothing\r\n  and shoes, he spends the greatest part of the day in bed, acts like an\r\n  invalid lady of position, affectedly and modestly, and asks for\r\n  bon-bons and the like. His hair is done, up in a knot as well as it\r\n  allows, and the beard is pulled out. Breasts are made out of biscuits.\r\n\r\n  In 1874 caries began in the left knee-joint, to which pulmonary\r\n  tuberculosis was soon added. Death on December 2, 1874. Skull normal.\r\n  Frontal lobes atrophic. Brain anæmic. Microscopical (Dr. Schüle): In\r\n  the superior layer of the frontal lobe, ganglion cells somewhat\r\n  shrunken; in the adventitia of the vessels, numerous fat-corpuscles;\r\n  glia unchanged; isolated pigment particles and colloid bodies. The\r\n  lower layers of the cortex normal. Genitals very large; testicles\r\n  small, lax, and show no change macroscopically on section.\r\n\r\nThe delusion of sexual transformation, displayed, in its conditions and\r\nphases of development, in the foregoing case, is a manifestation\r\nremarkably infrequent in the pathology of the human mind. Besides the\r\nforegoing cases, personally observed, I have seen such a case, as an\r\nepisodical phenomenon, in a lady having contrary sexuality (Case 92 of\r\nthe sixth edition of this work), one in a girl affected with original\r\nparanoia, and another in a lady suffering with original paranoia.\r\n\r\nSave for a case briefly reported by Arndt, in his text-book (p. 172),\r\nand one quite superficially described by Sérieux (“Recherches Clinique,”\r\np. 33), and the two cases known to Esquirol, I cannot recall any cases\r\nof delusion of sexual transformation in literature. Arndt’s case may be\r\nbriefly given here, though, like Esquirol’s cases, it gives nothing\r\nconcerning the genesis of the delusion:—\r\n\r\n  Case 103. A middle-aged woman in the asylum at Greifswald thought she\r\n  was a man, and acted out her belief. She cut her hair short, and\r\n  parted it on one side in the military fashion. A sharply-cut profile,\r\n  a nose somewhat large, and a certain heaviness of all the features\r\n  gave the face something characteristic, and, in combination with the\r\n  short hair combed smoothly over the ears, gave the whole head a\r\n  decidedly masculine appearance. She was tall and lean; her voice low\r\n  and rough; the larynx angularly prominent; her attitude erect; her\r\n  gait, like all her movements, heavy, but not awkward. She looked like\r\n  a man in female dress. Asked how she had come to think she was a man,\r\n  she would almost always cry excitedly: “Just look at me! Don’t I look\r\n  like a man? I feel like a man, too. I have always felt so, but I only\r\n  gradually came to understand it clearly. The man who should be my\r\n  husband is not a real man. I raised my children myself. I always felt\r\n  somewhat like this, but I came to understand later. Did I not always\r\n  work like a man? The man who passed for my husband only helped. He did\r\n  what I planned. From my youth I have been more masculine than\r\n  feminine. I have always had more liking for the garden and farm than\r\n  for work in the house and kitchen. But I never understood the reason.\r\n  Now I know I am a man, and I shall bear myself like one. It is a shame\r\n  to make me always wear women’s clothes.”\r\n\r\n  Case 104. X., aged 26, tall, and of handsome appearance. Since his\r\n  earliest youth he has loved to wear female attire. As he grew up, he\r\n  managed it so that, when he was a participant in theatricals, he\r\n  always had a female part. After an attack of mental excitement, he\r\n  imagined that he was actually a woman, and tried to convince others of\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  He liked to undress himself, and dress his hair and put on female\r\n  clothing. In this state he wished to go out on the street. In other\r\n  respects he was perfectly reasonable. He would spend the whole day\r\n  arranging his hair and looking at himself in the glass, costuming\r\n  himself in a night-dress as much like a woman as possible. In walking\r\n  he imitated women. One day, when Esquirol acted as if about to lift up\r\n  his dress, he flew into a passion and upbraided him for his want of\r\n  modesty (Esquirol).\r\n\r\n  Case 105. Mrs. X., widow. Owing to the death of her husband and loss\r\n  of fortune, she had been greatly troubled in mind. She became\r\n  disturbed mentally, and was admitted to the Salpêtrière after\r\n  attempting suicide.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. X., lean, thin; constantly maniacal; she believes herself a man,\r\n  and flies angry if she is addressed as “madam.” Once, when male\r\n  clothing was placed at her disposal, she was beside herself with joy.\r\n  She died, in 1802, of a consumptive malady; and she expressed her\r\n  delusion of being a man until shortly before her death (Esquirol).\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the interesting relations existing between the\r\nfacts of delusional transformation of sex and the so-called insanity of\r\nthe Scythians.\r\n\r\nMarandon (“Annales médico-psychologiques,” 1877, p. 161), like others,\r\nhas erroneously presumed that with the ancient Scythians there was an\r\nactual delusion, and that the condition was not merely that of\r\neviration. According to the law of empirical actuality, the delusion, so\r\ninfrequent to-day, must also have been very infrequent in ancient times.\r\nSince it can only be conceived as arising on the basis of a paranoia,\r\nthere can be no thought of its endemic occurrence; it can only be\r\nregarded as a superstitious manifestation of eviration (the result of\r\nanger of the goddess), as is also evident from the statements of\r\nHippocrates.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the so-called Scythian insanity, as well as the facts\r\nlately learned about the Pueblo Indians, are also noteworthy\r\nanthropologically, in that atrophy of the testes and genitals in\r\ngeneral, and approximation to the female type, physically and mentally,\r\nwere observed. This is the more remarkable, since, in men who have lost\r\ntheir procreative organs, such a reversal of instinct is quite as\r\nunusual as in women, mutatis mutandis, after the natural or artificial\r\nclimacteric.\r\n\r\nB. _Homo-Sexual Feeling as an Abnormal Congenital\r\nManifestation._[105]—The essential feature of this strange manifestation\r\nof the sexual life is the want of sexual sensibility for the opposite\r\nsex, even to the extent of horror, while sexual inclination and impulse\r\ntoward the same sex are present. At the same time, the genitals are\r\nnormally developed, the sexual glands perform their functions properly,\r\nand the sexual type is completely differentiated.\r\n\r\nFeeling, thought, will, and the whole character, in cases of the\r\ncomplete development of the anomaly, correspond with the peculiar sexual\r\ninstinct, but not with the sex which the individual represents\r\nanatomically and physiologically. This abnormal mode of feeling may not\r\ninfrequently be recognized in the manner, dress, and calling of the\r\nindividuals, who may go so far as to yield to an impulse to don the\r\ndistinctive clothing corresponding with the sexual _rôle_ in which they\r\nfeel themselves to be.\r\n\r\nAnthropologically and clinically, this abnormal manifestation presents\r\nvarious degrees of development:—\r\n\r\n1. Traces of hetero-sexual, with predominating homo-sexual, instinct\r\n(psycho-sexual hermaphroditism).\r\n\r\n2. There exists inclination only toward the same sex (homo-sexuality).\r\n\r\n3. The entire mental existence is altered to correspond with the\r\nabnormal sexual instinct (effemination and viraginity).\r\n\r\n4. The form of the body approaches that which corresponds to the\r\nabnormal sexual instinct. However, actual transitions to hermaphrodites\r\nnever occur, but, on the contrary, completely differentiated genitals;\r\nso that, just as in all pathological perversions of the sexual life, the\r\ncause must be sought in the brain (androgyny and gynandry).\r\n\r\n  The first definite communications[106] concerning this enigmatical\r\n  phenomenon of Nature are made by Caspar (“Ueber Nothzucht und\r\n  Päderastie,” Caspar’s _Vierteljahrsschrift_, 1852, i), who, it is\r\n  true, classes it with pederasty, but makes the pertinent remark that\r\n  this anomaly is, in most cases, congenital, and, at the same time, to\r\n  be regarded as a mental hermaphroditism. There exists here an actual\r\n  disgust of sexual contact with women, while the imagination is filled\r\n  with beautiful young men, and with statues and pictures of them. It\r\n  did not escape Casper that in such cases emissio penis in anum\r\n  (pederasty) is not the rule, but that, by means of other sexual acts\r\n  (mutual onanism), sexual satisfaction is sought and obtained.\r\n\r\n  In his “Clinical Novels” (1863, p. 33) Casper gives the interesting\r\n  confession of a man showing this perversion of the sexual instinct,\r\n  and does not hesitate to assert that, aside from vicious imagination\r\n  and vice, as a result of over-indulgence in normal sexual intercourse,\r\n  there are numerous cases in which pederasty has its origin in a\r\n  remarkable, obscure impulse, which is congenital and inexplicable.\r\n  About the middle of the “sixties,” a certain assessor, Ulrichs,\r\n  himself subject to this perverse instinct, came out and declared, in\r\n  numerous articles,[107] that the sexual mental life was not connected\r\n  with the bodily sex; that there were male individuals that felt like\r\n  women toward men (“anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa”). He\r\n  called these people “_urnings_,” and demanded nothing less than the\r\n  legal and social recognition of this sexual love of the urnings as\r\n  congenital and, therefore, as right; and the permission of marriage\r\n  among them. Ulrichs failed, however, to prove that this certainly\r\n  congenital and paradoxical sexual feeling was physiological, and not\r\n  pathological.\r\n\r\n  Griesinger (_Archiv f. Psychiatrie_, i, p. 651) threw the first ray of\r\n  light on these facts, anthropologically and clinically, by pointing\r\n  out the marked hereditary taint of the individual, in a case which\r\n  came under his own observation.\r\n\r\n  We have Westphal (_Archiv f. Psychiatrie_, ii, p. 73) to thank for the\r\n  first systematic consideration of the manifestation in question, which\r\n  he defined as “congenital reversal of the sexual feeling, with\r\n  consciousness of the abnormality of the manifestation,” and designated\r\n  with the name, since generally accepted, of _contrary sexual\r\n  instinct_. At the same time, he began a series of cases,[108] which,\r\n  up to this time, has reached ninety-three, those reported in this\r\n  monograph not being included.\r\n\r\n  Westphal leaves it undecided as to whether contrary sexual feeling is\r\n  a symptom of a neuropathic or of a psychopathic condition, or whether\r\n  it may occur as an isolated manifestation. He holds fast to the\r\n  opinion that the condition is congenital.\r\n\r\nFrom the cases published up to 1877, I have designated this peculiar\r\nsexual feeling as a functional sign of degeneration, and as a partial\r\nmanifestation of a neuro-psychopathic state, in most cases hereditary,—a\r\nsupposition which has found renewed confirmation in a consideration of\r\nadditional cases. The following peculiarities may be given as the signs\r\nof this neuro-psychopathic taint:—\r\n\r\n1. The sexual life of individuals thus organized manifests itself, as a\r\nrule, abnormally early, and thereafter with abnormal power. Not\r\ninfrequently still other perverse manifestations are presented besides\r\nthe abnormal method of sexual satisfaction, which in itself is\r\nconditioned by the peculiar sexual feeling.\r\n\r\n2. The psychical love manifest in these men is, for the most part,\r\nexaggerated and exalted in the same way as their sexual instinct is\r\nmanifested in consciousness, with a strange and even compelling force.\r\n\r\n3. By the side of the functional signs of degeneration attending\r\ncontrary sexual feeling are found other functional, and in many cases\r\nanatomical, evidences of degeneration.\r\n\r\n4. Neuroses (hysteria, neurasthenia, epileptoid states, etc.) co-exist.\r\nAlmost always the existence of temporary or lasting neurasthenia may be\r\nproved. As a rule, this is constitutional, having its root in congenital\r\nconditions. It is awakened and maintained by masturbation or enforced\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nIn male individuals, owing to these practices or to congenital\r\ndisposition, there is finally neurasthenia sexualis, which manifests\r\nitself essentially in irritable weakness of the ejaculation centre. Thus\r\nit is explained that, in most of the cases, simply embracing and\r\nkissing, or even only the sight of the loved person, induce the act of\r\nejaculation. Frequently this is accompanied by an abnormally powerful\r\nfeeling of lustful pleasure, which may be so intense as to suggest a\r\nfeeling of magnetic currents passing through the body.\r\n\r\n5. In the majority of cases, psychical anomalies (brilliant endowment in\r\nart, especially music, poetry, etc., by the side of bad intellectual\r\npowers or original eccentricity) are present, which may even go so far\r\nas pronounced conditions of mental degeneration (dementia, moral\r\ninsanity).\r\n\r\nIn many urnings, either temporarily or permanently, insanity of a\r\ndegenerative character (pathological emotional states, periodical\r\ninsanity, paranoia, etc.) makes its appearance.\r\n\r\n6. In almost all cases where an examination of the physical and mental\r\npeculiarities of the ancestors and blood-relations has been possible,\r\nneuroses, psychoses, degenerative signs, etc., have been found in the\r\nfamilies.[109]\r\n\r\nThe depth of congenital contrary feeling is shown by the fact that the\r\nlustful dream of the male-loving urning has for its content only male\r\nindividuals; that of the female-loving woman, only female individuals,\r\nwith corresponding situations.\r\n\r\nThe observation of Westphal, that the consciousness of one congenitally\r\ndefective in sexual desires toward the opposite sex is painfully\r\naffected by the impulse toward the same sex, is true in only a number of\r\ncases. Indeed, in many instances, the consciousness of the abnormality\r\nof the condition is wanting. The majority of urnings are happy in their\r\nperverse sexual feeling and impulse, and unhappy only in so far as\r\nsocial and legal barriers stand in the way of the satisfaction of their\r\ninstinct toward their own sex.\r\n\r\nThe study of contrary sexual feeling points directly to anomalies of the\r\ncerebral organization of the affected individuals. Gley (_Revue\r\nphilosoph._, January, 1884) believes that he is able to solve the riddle\r\nby the theory that the individuals have a female brain and male sexual\r\nglands; and, further, that pathological brain conditions determine the\r\nsexual life, while normally the sexual organs determine the sexual\r\nfunctions of the brain.\r\n\r\nOne of my patients offered me an interesting theory in explanation of\r\noriginal contrary sexual instinct. He started with the actual\r\nbi-sexuality shown by the fœtus anatomically up to a certain age. While\r\nnormally the organs which attain complete development exclusively\r\ncondition and determine the sexual type, and the influence of the\r\nopposite organs, which remain rudimentary, is _nil_, it is conceivable\r\nthat, under the influence of a factor inimical to the normal development\r\nof the brain (hereditary taint, etc.), these rudimentary organs likewise\r\nexercise an influence which, under certain circumstances, may be even\r\ngreater than that of the fully developed organs which determine the\r\nexternal sexual type.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, Kiernan (_Medical Standard_, 1888) and G. Frank\r\nLydston (_Phila. Med. and Surg. Reporter_, 1888) attempt to explain a\r\npart of the cases of congenital sexual paranoia. Magnan, too (_Ann. méd.\r\npsychol._, 1885, p. 458), writes, in all earnestness, of the brain of a\r\nwoman in the body of a man, and _vice versâ_.[110]\r\n\r\nThe attempted explanations of congenital urnings are not less\r\nsuperficial; for instance, that of Ulrichs, who, in his “Memnon,” 1868,\r\nspeaks of an “anima muliebris virili corpore inclusa (virili corpori\r\ninnata),” and thus tries to explain the congenital origin and the female\r\ncharacter of his abnormal sexual instinct. The idea of the patient, the\r\nsubject of Case 124, is original. He supposes that when his father begat\r\nhim he thought to beget a girl, but, instead of a girl, a boy resulted.\r\nOne of the strangest explanations of congenital contrary sexual feeling\r\nis made by Mantegazza (_op. cit._, p. 106, 1886).\r\n\r\nAccording to this author, in such individuals there exist anatomical\r\nanomalies which, by an error of Nature, consist in a distribution to the\r\nrectum of the nerves intended for the genitals; so that only in this\r\nsituation the lustful sensation is aroused which otherwise results from\r\nstimulation of the genitals. But how does this author, in other ways so\r\nacute, explain the great majority of cases, where pederasty is abhorred\r\nby those affected with contrary sexual feeling? Besides, Nature never\r\nmakes such leaps. Mantegazza rests his hypothesis upon the statements of\r\nan acquaintance, a celebrated writer, who assured him that he was not\r\nsure that he took a greater pleasure in coitus than in defecation!\r\nAllowing the correctness of his experience, still it would only prove\r\nthat the man was sexually abnormal, and that his pleasure in coitus was\r\nreduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of congenital contrary sexual feeling may perhaps be\r\nfound in the fact that it represents a peculiarity bred in descendants,\r\nbut arising in ancestry. The hereditary factor might be an _acquired_\r\nabnormal inclination for the same sex in the ancestors (_v. infra_),\r\nfound fixed as a congenital abnormal manifestation in the descendants.\r\nSince, according to experience, acquired physical and mental\r\npeculiarities, not simply improvements, but essentially defects, are\r\ntransmitted, this hypothesis becomes tenable. Since individuals affected\r\nwith contrary sexual feeling not infrequently beget children,—at least,\r\nthey are not absolutely impotent (women never are),—a transmission to\r\ndescendants is possible.\r\n\r\nThis supposition is decidedly favored by Case 124, in which the\r\neight-year-old daughter of an individual affected with contrary sexual\r\nfeeling, practiced mutual masturbation—a sexual act—at an age which\r\npermits the presumption of contrary sexual feeling. No less significant\r\nis the communication made to me by a young man of twenty-six, who\r\nbelongs to the third group of contrary sexuality. He knew with certainty\r\nthat his father, who had died some years before, was also subject to\r\ncontrary sexuality. An informant assured me, at least, that he knew many\r\nother men with whom his father had sustained “relations.” Whether, in\r\nthe case of the father, it was an acquired or a congenital contrary\r\nsexual instinct, and to what group he belonged, could not be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing hypothesis seems the more plausible, when it is considered\r\nthat the first three degrees of congenital contrary sexual instinct\r\ncorrespond exactly with the developmental stages which are discoverable\r\nin the development of the acquired anomaly. One, therefore, feels\r\ninclined to designate the various degrees of congenital contrary sexual\r\ninstinct as various degrees of an hereditarily-induced sexual anomaly,\r\nacquired from the progenitors or otherwise developed. Here, too, the law\r\nof progressive heredity must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe sexual acts, by means of which male urnings seek and find\r\nsatisfaction, are multifarious. There are individuals, of fine feeling\r\nand strength of will, who sometimes satisfy themselves with platonic\r\nlove, with the risk, however, of becoming nervous (neurasthenic) and\r\ninsane, as a result of this enforced abstinence. In other instances, for\r\nthe same reasons which may lead normal individuals to avoid coitus,\r\nonanism, _faut de mieux_, is indulged in.\r\n\r\nIn urnings with nervous systems congenitally irritable, or injured by\r\nonanism (irritable weakness of the ejaculation centre), simple embraces\r\nor caresses, with or without contact of the genitals, are sufficient to\r\ninduce ejaculation and consequent satisfaction. In less irritable\r\nindividuals, the sexual act consists of manustupration by the loved\r\nperson, or mutual onanism, or imitation of coitus between the thighs. In\r\nurnings morally perverse and potent, quoad erectionem, the sexual desire\r\nis satisfied by pederasty,—an act, however, which is repugnant to\r\nperverted individuals that are not defective morally, much in the same\r\nway as it is to normal men. The statement of urnings is remarkable, that\r\nthe sexual act with persons of the same sex, which is adequate for them,\r\ngives them a feeling of great satisfaction and accession of strength,\r\nwhile satisfaction by solitary onanism, or by enforced coitus with a\r\nwoman, affects them in an unfavorable way, making them miserable and\r\nincreasing their neurasthenic symptoms. The manner of satisfaction of\r\nthe female urning is little known. In one of my cases, the girl\r\nmasturbated, and during the act felt herself to be a man; and her fancy\r\ncreated a beloved female person. In another case, the act consisted of\r\npracticing onanism on the person loved, and fondling her genitals.\r\n\r\n_Amor lesbicus_ is presumably not infrequent here, for which an enlarged\r\nclitoris or an artificial priapus may be used.\r\n\r\nAs to the frequency[111] of the occurrence of the anomaly, it is\r\ndifficult to reach a just conclusion, since those affected with it break\r\nfrom their reserve only very infrequently; and in criminal cases the\r\nurning with perversion of sexual instinct is usually classed with the\r\nperson given to pederasty for simply vicious reasons. According to\r\nCasper’s and Tardieu’s, as well as my own, experience, this anomaly is\r\nmuch more frequent than reported cases would lead us to presume.\r\n\r\nUlrichs (“Kritische Pfeile,” p. 2, 1880) declares that, on an average,\r\nthere is one person affected with contrary sexual instinct to every two\r\nhundred mature men, or to every eight hundred of the population; and\r\nthat the percentage among the Magyars and South Slavs is still\r\ngreater,—statements which may be regarded as untrustworthy. The subject\r\nof one of my cases knows personally, at his home (13,000 inhabitants),\r\nfourteen urnings. He further declares that he is acquainted with at\r\nleast eighty in a city of 60,000 inhabitants. It is to be presumed that\r\nthis man, otherwise worthy of belief, makes no distinction between the\r\ncongenital and the acquired anomaly.\r\n\r\n1. _Psychical Hermaphroditism._[112]—The characteristic mark of this\r\ndegree of inversion of the sexual instinct is that, by the side of the\r\npronounced sexual instinct and desire for the same sex, a desire toward\r\nthe opposite sex is present; but the latter is much weaker and is\r\nmanifested episodically only, while the homo-sexuality is primary, and,\r\nin time and intensity, forms the most striking feature of the vita\r\nsexualis.\r\n\r\nThe hetero-sexual instinct may be but rudimentary, manifesting itself\r\nsimply in unconscious (dream) life; or (episodically, at least) it may\r\nbe powerfully exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe sexual instinct toward the opposite sex may be strengthened by the\r\nexercise of will and self-control; by moral treatment, and possibly by\r\nhypnotic suggestion; by improvement of the constitution and the removal\r\nof neuroses (neurasthenia); but especially by abstinence from\r\nmasturbation. However, there is always the danger that homo-sexual\r\nfeelings, in that they are the most powerful, may become permanent, and\r\nlead to enduring and exclusive contrary sexual instinct. This is\r\nespecially to be feared as a result of the influences of masturbation\r\n(just as in acquired inversion of the sexual instinct) and its\r\nneurasthenia and consequent exacerbations; and, further, it is to be\r\nfound as a consequence of unfavorable experiences in sexual intercourse\r\nwith persons of the opposite sex (defective feeling of pleasure in\r\ncoitus, failure in coitus on account of weakness of erection and\r\npremature ejaculation, infection). On the other hand, it is possible\r\nthat æsthetic and ethical sympathy with persons of the opposite sex may\r\nfavor the development of hetero-sexual desires. Thus it happens that the\r\nindividual, according to the predominance of favorable or unfavorable\r\ninfluences, experiences now hetero-sexual, now homo-sexual, feeling.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me probable that such hermaphrodites from constitutional\r\ntaint are not infrequent.[113] Since they attract very little attention\r\nsocially, and since such secrets of married life are only exceptionally\r\nbrought to the knowledge of the physician, it is at once apparent why\r\nthis interesting and practically important transitional group to the\r\ngroup of absolute contrary sexuality, has thus far escaped scientific\r\ninvestigation. Many cases of frigiditas uxoris and mariti may possibly\r\ndepend upon this anomaly. Sexual intercourse with the opposite sex is,\r\nin itself, possible. At any rate, in cases of this degree, no horror\r\nsexus alterius exists. Here is a fertile field for the application of\r\nmedical and moral therapeutics (_v. infra_). The differential diagnosis\r\nfrom acquired contrary sexual instinct may present difficulties; for in\r\nsuch cases, as long as the vestiges of a normal sexual instinct are not\r\nabsolutely lost, the actual symptoms are the same (_v. infra_). In the\r\nfirst degree, the sexual satisfaction of homo-sexual impulses consists\r\nin passive and mutual onanism and coitus inter femora.\r\n\r\n  Case 106. _Psychical Hermaphroditism in a Lady._—Mrs. M., aged 44,\r\n  exemplifies the fact that an inverted and a normal sexual instinct may\r\n  be united in one person, be it in man or woman. The father of this\r\n  lady was very musical, and very talented as an artist. He took life\r\n  easily; and to his extraordinary beauty was added a great admiration\r\n  for the opposite sex. After several apoplectic attacks, he died\r\n  demented in an asylum. Father’s brother was neuro-psychopathic, and\r\n  when a child was a somnambulist; and all his life he was afflicted\r\n  with hyperæsthesia sexualis. Thus, although married and the father of\r\n  married sons, he tried to seduce his niece, Mrs. M., with whom he was\r\n  wildly in love, when she was eighteen years old. Father’s father was\r\n  very eccentric and a distinguished actor. He first studied theology,\r\n  but, as a result of partiality for the dramatic muse, he became an\r\n  actor and singer. He committed excesses in baccho et venere; was a\r\n  spendthrift and luxurious. He died at forty-nine, of apoplexia\r\n  cerebri. Mother’s father and mother died of tuberculosis of the lungs.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. M. was one of eleven children, of whom six are still living. Two\r\n  brothers, who resembled the mother physically, died, at sixteen and\r\n  twenty, of tuberculosis. A brother suffers with laryngeal phthisis.\r\n  Four living sisters and Mrs. M. resemble the father physically, and\r\n  the eldest is unmarried, very nervous, and shy of people. Two younger\r\n  sisters are married, healthy, and have healthy children. The other is\r\n  unmarried, and suffers with nervous complaints. Mrs. M. has four\r\n  children, several of whom are delicate and neuropathic.\r\n\r\n  The patient can tell nothing of importance concerning her childhood.\r\n  She learned easily, and was æsthetically and poetically inclined. She\r\n  was considered a little high-strung, and too much given to\r\n  novel-reading and sentimentality. Her constitution was neuropathic,\r\n  and she was extremely sensitive to changes of temperature, sometimes\r\n  having annoying cutis anserina as a result of slight draughts. It is\r\n  remarkable that one day, when she was about ten years old, she thought\r\n  that her mother no longer loved her; and she put matches in her coffee\r\n  to make herself really sick, that she might thus excite her mother’s\r\n  love for her.\r\n\r\n  Puberty began, without difficulty, at the age of eleven. Thereafter\r\n  the menses were regular. Before the time of puberty sexuality\r\n  manifested itself, and, according to the opinion of the patient, its\r\n  promptings have been abnormally intense all her life. The first\r\n  feelings and impulses were decidedly inverted. She conceived a\r\n  passionate but platonic love for a young lady. She wrote verses and\r\n  sonnets to her, and was perfectly happy if she could admire “the\r\n  entrancing charms” of her goddess in the bath, or steal a glimpse of\r\n  her neck, shoulders, and breast while she was dressing. The wild\r\n  impulse to touch these physical charms was always overcome. While a\r\n  young girl, she had actually been in love with Madonnas of Raphael and\r\n  Guido Reni. In all kinds of weather she would run after pretty girls\r\n  and ladies for hours at a time, admiring their beauty, losing no\r\n  opportunity to please them, offering them bouquets, etc. The patient\r\n  asserted that, until the age of nineteen, she was absolutely without a\r\n  suspicion of a difference of sex; because she had been educated as in\r\n  a cloister by a very prudish aunt, who was an old maid. As a result of\r\n  this great ignorance, the patient became the victim of a man who was\r\n  passionately in love with her, and who had coitus with her by means of\r\n  stratagem. She became the wife of this man, bore one child, and lived\r\n  an “eccentric” sexual life with him. She felt perfectly satisfied with\r\n  married intercourse. After a few years she became a widow. Since then,\r\n  women have again been the object of her love, primarily, as the\r\n  patient thinks, from fear of the results of sexual intercourse with a\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  At twenty-seven, second marriage, without love, to a phthisical\r\n  husband. Patient was three times confined, and fulfilled her maternal\r\n  duties. Her physical health failed, and in the later years of this\r\n  married life she had an increasing aversion for her husband, partly\r\n  due to a sense of his disease, though, at the same time, there was\r\n  constantly present an intense desire for sexual indulgence.\r\n\r\n  Three years after the death of her second husband, the patient\r\n  discovered the fact that her nine-year-old daughter, by her first\r\n  husband, was given to masturbation, and that she was failing in\r\n  physical health. The patient read of this vice, and could not overcome\r\n  the impulse to indulge in the practice, becoming, in consequence, an\r\n  onanist. She is unable to bring herself to give the details of this\r\n  period of her life. She says that she was frightfully excited\r\n  sexually, and had to send her daughters from home to save them from\r\n  terrible consequences; but the two boys she was able to keep at home.\r\n\r\n  Patient became neurasthenic ex masturbatione (spinal irritation,\r\n  feeling of pressure in head, weariness, lack of mental control), and,\r\n  at times, had dysthymia and painful tædium vitæ. Her sexual feeling\r\n  would be directed at one time to women, at another to men. She was\r\n  able to restrain herself, and suffered much from abstinence,\r\n  especially because, on account of her neurasthenic troubles, she\r\n  sought to obtain relief in masturbation, though only in case of great\r\n  necessity. At the present time, though forty-four years old, and\r\n  menstruating regularly, she suffers intensely with a passion for a\r\n  young man whose presence she cannot avoid on account of the exigencies\r\n  of occupation.\r\n\r\n  Patient presents nothing remarkable in external appearance. She is\r\n  gracefully formed, but the muscular system is not strongly developed.\r\n  Pelvis is, in all respects, that of a female, but the arms and legs\r\n  are decidedly large and of masculine form. Ladies’ shoes do not fit\r\n  her, but, being opposed to exciting attention, she forces her feet\r\n  into female shoes, and they are, therefore, much deformed. Genitals\r\n  normally developed, and present no other abnormality than descent of\r\n  the uterus, with hypertrophy of the vaginal portion. On thorough\r\n  examination it is seen that the patient is essentially homo-sexual,\r\n  and that the desire for the opposite sex is but episodical and\r\n  sensual. Thus, at present, she suffers intensely with sexual desires\r\n  for every man with whom she comes in contact, but it is a more refined\r\n  and higher pleasure for her to imprint a kiss on the soft, round cheek\r\n  of a maiden. This pleasure is one she often enjoys, because she is\r\n  much beloved as the “dear aunt” by all the “sweet creatures”; for she\r\n  voluntarily does them the most various chivalrous favors, always\r\n  feeling herself at such times as a man.\r\n\r\n  Case 107. _Contrary Sexual Instinct with Sexual Satisfaction in\r\n  Hetero-Sexual Intercourse._—Mr. Z., aged 36, Hollander, consulted me,\r\n  in 1888, on account of an anomaly of his sexual feelings, which had\r\n  become a matter of anxiety to him in connection with an intended\r\n  marriage. Patient’s father was neuropathic, and suffered with\r\n  nightmare and night-terrors. Grandfather was mentally unsound;\r\n  father’s brother an idiot. Patient’s mother and her family were\r\n  healthy and normal mentally. The patient had four sisters and one\r\n  brother, the latter being subject to moral insanity. Three sisters are\r\n  healthy, and living happy married lives.\r\n\r\n  As a child, the patient was weak, nervous, and subject to\r\n  night-terrors, like his father; but he never had any severe sickness\r\n  except coxitis, as a result of which he limps slightly. Sexual\r\n  impulses were manifested early. At eight, without any teaching, he\r\n  began to masturbate. From his fourteenth year, ejaculation. He was\r\n  mentally well endowed, and his principal interest was in art and\r\n  literature. He was always weak muscularly, and had no inclination for\r\n  boyish sports and later for manly occupations. He had a certain\r\n  interest for female _toilettes_, ornaments, and occupations. From the\r\n  time of puberty the patient noticed in himself an inexplicable\r\n  inclination toward male persons. Youths of the lowest classes were\r\n  especially attractive to him. Cavalrymen especially excited his\r\n  interest. He experienced a lustful desire to press himself against\r\n  such individuals from behind. Occasionally, in crowds, it was possible\r\n  for him to do this; and in such an event an intense feeling of\r\n  pleasure passed over him. After his twenty-second year, on such\r\n  occasions, he now and then had an ejaculation. From that time\r\n  ejaculation occurred when a sympathetic man laid his hand on the\r\n  patient’s thigh. He was now in great anxiety lest he might sometime\r\n  assault a man sexually. People of the lower classes, wearing tight,\r\n  brown trousers, were especially dangerous for him. His greatest\r\n  pleasure would be: to embrace such a man and press himself on him;\r\n  but, unfortunately, the morality of his country did not allow such a\r\n  thing. Pederasty seemed disgusting to him.\r\n\r\n  It gave him great pleasure to gain a sight of the genitals of males.\r\n  He was always compelled to look at the genitals of every man he met.\r\n  In circuses, theatres, etc., only male performers interested him.\r\n  Patient has never noticed any inclination for women. He does not avoid\r\n  them, even dances with them on occasion, but he never feels the\r\n  slightest sensual excitation under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twenty-eight the patient was neurasthenic as a result of\r\n  his excessive masturbation.\r\n\r\n  Then frequent pollutions in sleep occurred, which weakened him very\r\n  much. It was only occasionally that he dreamed of men when he had\r\n  pollutions; and never of women. A lascivious dream-picture (pederasty)\r\n  had occurred but once. He dreamed of dying-scenes, of being attacked\r\n  by dogs, etc. After these, as before, he suffered with great libido\r\n  sexualis. Often there came up before him such lascivious thoughts as\r\n  gloating over the death of animals in the slaughter-house, or allowing\r\n  himself to be whipped by boys; but he always overcame such desires,\r\n  and also the impulse to dress in a military uniform.\r\n\r\n  In order to cure himself of masturbation, and to thoroughly satisfy\r\n  his libido, he determined to frequent brothels. He first attempted\r\n  sexual intercourse with a woman when twenty-one, after over-indulgence\r\n  in wine. The beauty of the female form, and female nudity in general,\r\n  made no impression on him. However, he was able to enjoy the act of\r\n  coitus, and thereafter he visited brothels regularly for “purposes of\r\n  health.”\r\n\r\n  From this time he took great pleasure in hearing men tell stories of\r\n  their sexual relations with the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n  Ideas of flagellation would also come to him while in a brothel, but\r\n  the retention of such fancies was not essential for the performance of\r\n  coitus. He considered sexual intercourse with prostitutes only a\r\n  remedy against the desire for masturbation and men,—a kind of\r\n  safety-valve to prevent compromising himself with some man.\r\n\r\n  The patient now wishes to marry, but fears not only that he could have\r\n  no love for a decent woman, but also that he might be impotent for\r\n  intercourse with one. Hence his thought and need of medical advice.\r\n\r\n  The patient is very intelligent, and is, in all respects, of masculine\r\n  appearance. In dress and manner he presents nothing that would attract\r\n  attention. Gait, voice, and skeleton,—the pelvis especially,—masculine\r\n  in character. Genitals of normal development. The normal growth of\r\n  hair for a male is abundant. The patient’s relatives and friends have\r\n  not the slightest suspicion of his sexual anomalies. In his inverted\r\n  sexual fancies, he has never felt himself in the _rôle_ of a woman\r\n  toward a man. For some years he has been entirely free from\r\n  neurasthenic troubles.\r\n\r\n  The question as to whether he considered himself a subject of\r\n  congenital inversion of sexual instinct he could not answer. It seems\r\n  probable that there was a congenital weak inclination for the opposite\r\n  sex, with a greater one for the same sex, which, as a result of early\r\n  masturbation in consequence of the homo-sexual instinct, was still\r\n  more weakened, but not reduced to _nil_. With the cessation of\r\n  masturbation, the feeling for women became in a measure more natural,\r\n  but only in a coarsely sensual way.\r\n\r\n  Since the patient explained that, for reasons of family and business,\r\n  it was necessary for him to marry, it was impossible to avoid this\r\n  delicate question.\r\n\r\n  Fortunately, the patient limited his inquiries to the question as to\r\n  his virility as a husband; and it was necessary to reply that he was\r\n  virile, and that he would probably be so in conjugal intercourse with\r\n  the wife of his choice,—at least, if she were to be in mental sympathy\r\n  with him; besides, that he could at all times improve his power by\r\n  exercising his imagination in the right direction.\r\n\r\n  The main thing was to strengthen the sexual inclination for the\r\n  opposite sex, which was defective, but not absolutely wanting. This\r\n  could be done by avoiding and opposing all homo-sexual feelings and\r\n  impulses, possibly with the help of the artificial inhibitory\r\n  influences of hypnotic suggestion (removal of homo-sexual desires by\r\n  suggestion); by the excitation and exercise of normal sexual desires\r\n  and impulses; by complete abstinence from masturbation, and\r\n  eradication of the remnants of the neurasthenic condition of the\r\n  nervous system by means of hydrotherapy, and possibly general\r\n  faradization.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to a physician, aged thirty, for the following\r\nautobiography, which in another respect is noteworthy:—\r\n\r\n  Case 108. _Mental Hermaphroditism; Abortive Contrary Sexual\r\n  Instinct._—“In my ancestry I am somewhat predisposed hereditarily. My\r\n  grandfather on my father’s side was a high-liver and a speculator. My\r\n  father was a man of character, but for more than thirty years he has\r\n  suffered with folie circulaire, without, however, being much hindered\r\n  by it in business. My mother, like her father before her, suffers with\r\n  stenocardiac attacks. My mother’s father and brother are said to have\r\n  been sexually hyperæsthetic. My only sister, about nine years older\r\n  than myself, was twice subject to attacks of eclampsia, and during\r\n  puberty was religiously exalted, and probably also sexually\r\n  hyperæsthetic. During many years she had to suffer with a severe\r\n  hysterical neurosis, but she is now completely well.\r\n\r\n  “As an only son, and born late, I was the apple of my mother’s eye;\r\n  and I have her indefatigable care to thank that I survived childhood,\r\n  after having passed through all the possible diseases of children\r\n  (hydrocephalus, measles, croup, small-pox, and, at thirteen, chronic\r\n  intestinal catarrh that lasted a year). My mother, being herself very\r\n  religious, raised me, without spoiling me, in a religious way, and\r\n  implanted in me, as the guiding moral principle, an unyielding\r\n  devotion to duty, which was further carried to an extreme in me by a\r\n  teacher whom I still call a friend. Owing to my delicate health, my\r\n  childhood, in greater part, was spent in bed; and I was thus given to\r\n  quiet occupations, especially reading; and thus as a boy I came to\r\n  be—if not _blasé_—premature at least. As early as eight or nine the\r\n  parts of books that excited me most were those where injuries or\r\n  operations that had to be endured by beautiful girls or ladies, were\r\n  described. Thus I was thrown into great excitement by a story in which\r\n  was pictured a maiden that had run a thorn into her foot, with a boy\r\n  taking it out for her. Indeed, every time that I looked upon this\r\n  picture, which was in nowise lascivious, I had an erection. Whenever\r\n  possible, I went to see chickens killed; and if I had missed that, I\r\n  looked at the spots of blood, and stroked the warm bodies of the\r\n  birds, with pleasurable shudders. I would emphasize the fact that I\r\n  have always been a great lover of animals, and have felt disgust and\r\n  pity while killing larger animals, and even in the vivisection of\r\n  frogs.\r\n\r\n  “The killing of chickens is still a great sexual stimulus for me, and\r\n  especially holding them, during which I have palpitation of the heart\r\n  and precordial oppression. It is of interest that my father had a\r\n  passion for binding together the hands of girls and young women.\r\n\r\n  “I think that another of my sexual abnormalities is attributable to\r\n  this strain of cruelty. As I shall clearly describe later, one of my\r\n  favorite games was that of an improvised doll-theatre, where I\r\n  prescribed the parts of my companions. Almost always it was a young\r\n  girl who, at the command of her papa, whom I represented, had to have\r\n  a painful operation done on her foot. The more the girl cried, the\r\n  more satisfaction I had. How I came to hit upon the foot as the\r\n  constant object of operation will be seen from the following: When a\r\n  very young boy, I happened to see my eldest sister change her\r\n  stockings. When she hastily hid her feet, my attention was attracted,\r\n  and immediately the sight of her bare feet to the ankles came to be\r\n  the ideal of my longing. Naturally, this made my sister very careful;\r\n  and thus there was occasioned a constant quarrel, which, on my part,\r\n  was kept up with all the wiles of cunning and flattery, and with even\r\n  explosions of anger, until my seventeenth year. In other respects my\r\n  sister was very indifferent. Indeed, her kiss is repugnant to me.\r\n  _Faute de mieux_, I made use of the feet of servants; masculine feet\r\n  had no effect on me. My greatest desire would have been to cut the\r\n  nails, or, _sit venia verbo_, the corns, on the beautiful foot of a\r\n  woman. My lustful dreams were concerned with these things. Indeed, I\r\n  applied myself to the study of medicine really in the expectation of\r\n  gaining an opportunity to satisfy my desires, or cure them. Thank God,\r\n  I attained the latter. After undertaking the first dissection of the\r\n  lower extremity of a female, this unhappy desire was removed from me.\r\n  I was unhappy because I was always deeply ashamed of this impulse. I\r\n  think I may spare further details concerning it, since this peculiar\r\n  enthusiasm, which even inspired me to write verses, has been\r\n  sufficiently described by others.\r\n\r\n  “Now, concerning the last phase of my sexual errors: I was about\r\n  thirteen, and had just begun to mature, when a school-mate, who\r\n  happened to be our guest, teased me one night by kicking me with his\r\n  bare feet under the covers. I seized his foot, and immediately became\r\n  greatly excited, and had a pollution after it,—the first that I had.\r\n  The boy was peculiarly girlish in form, and was also mentally\r\n  effeminate. Too, another comrade who had very small and delicate hands\r\n  and feet, whom I once saw in a bath, caused unusual excitement in me.\r\n  I thought it a great piece of good fortune to be in bed with either of\r\n  these, though any nearer sexual intercourse than embracing them never\r\n  came into my mind. Moreover, I always thrust such thoughts aside with\r\n  aversion. Some years later, when about sixteen or eighteen, I made the\r\n  acquaintance of two other boys that awakened my sexual feeling. When I\r\n  played with either of these, I immediately had an erection. Both were\r\n  very energetic and lively, but delicately formed and child-like. At\r\n  the occurrence of puberty I lost interest in both of them, though a\r\n  warm friendship was preserved. I should never have allowed myself to\r\n  have indulged in vicious practices with them.\r\n\r\n  “When I went to the University, I forgot completely these errors of my\r\n  libido sexualis, and from principle I kept from sexual intercourse\r\n  until I was twenty-four, in spite of the contempt of my companions.\r\n  When pollutions became too frequent, and I began to fear cerebral\r\n  neurasthenia ex abstinentia, I gave myself up to normal sexual\r\n  indulgence, though somewhat mechanically; and it was, of course, very\r\n  beneficial to me.\r\n\r\n  “The especial field of work to which I have devoted myself is\r\n  responsible for the fact that I am almost impotent with puellis\r\n  publicis, and also for the fact that the naked form of a woman\r\n  disgusts rather than excites me. The act always satisfies me the most,\r\n  if, during it, I can keep the vision of the face before me; but since,\r\n  on the other hand, the idea that the girl near me is enjoyed by\r\n  another is unbearable, for years I have found it absolutely necessary\r\n  for my mental comfort, in spite of the pecuniary sacrifice, to keep a\r\n  mistress, and, indeed, a virgin. Otherwise the most terrible jealousy\r\n  made me absolutely incapable of work. I must also mention that, at\r\n  thirteen, I fell in love platonically for the first time; and since\r\n  then I have often pined in chaste love. What distinguishes my case\r\n  from all others is the fact that I have never once masturbated in my\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  “Some weeks ago, in sleep, I was frightened by a dream of a naked boy,\r\n  from which I awoke with an erection. In conclusion, I venture to\r\n  undertake the difficult task of describing my present condition:\r\n  Medium height, gracefully formed. Skull dolichocephalic, with\r\n  prominence in the occipital region; circumference, 59 centimetres;\r\n  frontal prominence marked; glance somewhat neuropathic; pupils medium;\r\n  teeth very defective; musculature strong and tense; abundant hair,\r\n  blonde. Varicocele on the left side; frenulum too short, which\r\n  hindered me in coitus. I severed it myself three years ago. Since then\r\n  ejaculation is retarded, and pleasurable feeling much diminished.\r\n  Temperament choleric. Quick of comprehension; good at drawing\r\n  conclusions; energetic; for one hereditarily predisposed, very\r\n  persevering. I learn languages easily, and have a good ear for music,\r\n  but otherwise I have no talent for the arts. I am always ambitious to\r\n  do my duty, but I am constantly troubled with tædium vitæ, and only\r\n  kept from attempts at suicide by my religion and the thought of my\r\n  mother. Otherwise I am a typical candidate for suicide. I am\r\n  ambitious, jealous, have a fear of paralysis; left-handed. I am filled\r\n  with socialistic ideas. I like adventures, and I am courageous. I have\r\n  decided never to marry.”\r\n\r\n  Case 109. _Psychical Hermaphroditism. Autobiography._—“I was born in\r\n  1868. The families of both my parents are healthy; at any rate, mental\r\n  disease has never occurred in them. My father was a merchant; he is\r\n  now sixty-five years old, and for years has been nervous and\r\n  especially inclined to be melancholic. Before his marriage, my father\r\n  is said to have lived fast. My mother is healthy, though not very\r\n  strong. There are two other healthy children.\r\n\r\n  “I was very early developed sexually, and in my fourteenth year was so\r\n  much troubled by pollutions that I was frightened. Under what\r\n  circumstances they occurred, particularly the nature of the dreams\r\n  that were connected with them, I am no longer able to state. The fact\r\n  is, that for years I have only felt myself drawn toward men sexually;\r\n  and, with every effort and a terrible struggle, I am still unable to\r\n  overcome this unnatural impulse that is so repugnant to me. It is said\r\n  that I had many severe illnesses in my childhood, and that my life was\r\n  often despaired of. To this was probably due the fact that I was\r\n  spoiled and made very delicate. I was always much in the house,\r\n  preferred to play with dolls rather than with soldiers, and I liked to\r\n  play quietly in the house better than to play noisily in the streets.\r\n  I entered the Gymnasium at the age of ten. Though I was lazy, I was\r\n  among the best scholars; for I learned very easily, and was the\r\n  favorite of my teacher. From my earliest childhood (seventh year), I\r\n  took pleasure in little girls. I remember that, even until my\r\n  thirteenth year, I had formal love-affairs with them, and was jealous\r\n  of those who associated with them; that I took pleasure in looking\r\n  under the petticoats of my sister’s friends and the servants; and that\r\n  I had erections when touching the persons of my female playmates. I\r\n  can, however, recall with certainty that boys attracted and excited me\r\n  sexually just as early and powerfully. I always took great delight in\r\n  reading and in the theatre. I had a doll-theatre, with which I played\r\n  by preference. I knew whole pieces by heart, and copied the actors I\r\n  saw, taking especially the female parts, in which I was delighted to\r\n  put on female attire.\r\n\r\n  “As my sexual life became more pronounced, my inclination for boys won\r\n  the upper hand. I fell completely in love with my companions, and had\r\n  lustful feeling if one of them who pleased me touched my body. I\r\n  became very shy, and refused to take gymnastic and swimming lessons. I\r\n  thought I was different from my comrades, and did not like to undress\r\n  before them. I liked to look at the penes of my companions, and easily\r\n  had erections. I masturbated but once, and that in my youth. When a\r\n  friend told me that one could have pleasure without women, I likewise\r\n  tried it; but I found no pleasure in it. At that time, also, a book\r\n  fell in my hands which warned against the effects of onanism. After\r\n  that one trial I never did it again. In my fourteenth or fifteenth\r\n  year, I made the acquaintance of two younger boys who excited me\r\n  sexually to the highest degree. I was especially in love with one of\r\n  them. I became sexually excited in his presence, and was restless when\r\n  I did not have him near me. I was jealous of those who associated with\r\n  him, and embarrassed in his presence. He had no suspicion of my\r\n  condition. I felt very unhappy, and often wept gladly, feeling then\r\n  relieved. Yet I could not understand this feeling, and always felt its\r\n  irregularity. I was also especially unhappy because my ability to work\r\n  disappeared all at once. I, who before had learned with ease, suddenly\r\n  had difficulty; my thoughts were never on the subject. Only by\r\n  straining every nerve could I get anything through my head. I always\r\n  had to study aloud, in order to keep my attention on the matter in\r\n  hand. My memory, which was previously excellent, often left me in the\r\n  lurch. Nevertheless, I continued to be a good scholar, and I still\r\n  pass for a talented man; but I have terrible difficulty in learning\r\n  anything. I exerted all my energy to free myself from this sad\r\n  condition. Daily I went swimming; I practiced turning, rode much, and\r\n  practiced fencing, in all of which I enjoyed myself very much. I still\r\n  like to be on a horse’s back, though I know nothing about horses, and\r\n  have no particular talent for physical exercises. I was never absent\r\n  from a drinking-party, and I smoked. I was much liked. In _cafés_ I\r\n  associated much with waitresses, and liked to amuse myself with them,\r\n  without, however, being sexually excited by them. Among my friends and\r\n  teachers, I passed for a man who was much with women, and spoiled by\r\n  them. Unfortunately, this was not true.\r\n\r\n  “At the age of nineteen I went to the University. My first semester\r\n  was spent at the University of B., and it is still terrible to recall\r\n  it. My sexual appetite powerfully excited me, and at night, for hours\r\n  at a time, I ran about looking for men, especially when I was\r\n  intoxicated. The next morning I would be crazy about myself.\r\n  Fortunately, I found no one. In the second semester, I went to M. This\r\n  was my happiest time. I had pleasant friends, and, for a wonder, took\r\n  pleasure in women, and was very happy about it. I had a love-affair\r\n  with a young girl of spoiled character, with whom I spent wild nights.\r\n  I was extraordinarily virile. I, who had formerly been chaste, also\r\n  associated with other women, as never before. I felt fresh and well\r\n  after coitus. I was not charmed so much by the female figure, which\r\n  was never beautiful to me, as by—I know not what. In short, I knew\r\n  women whose touch immediately induced erection. This joy and state of\r\n  delight did not last long. I was so foolish as to take rooms with a\r\n  friend. We had one sleeping-room. My friend was very talented and\r\n  amiable, and a favorite with women; and it was by these\r\n  characteristics that he at first so strongly attracted me. In fact, I\r\n  love only highly-educated men; uneducated, powerful persons are able\r\n  to excite me intensely only for the moment, and cannot retain my\r\n  affections. I soon fell in love with my friend. Then came the terrible\r\n  time that destroyed my health. I slept in the same room with my\r\n  friend, and had to see him undress daily; so that it required all my\r\n  strength to keep from betraying myself. I became nervous, cried\r\n  easily, and was jealous of those who associated with my friend. I\r\n  still associated with women; but it was only with difficulty that I\r\n  could perform coitus, which, like woman, was repugnant to me. The same\r\n  women who had excited me intensely, no longer had any effect on me. I\r\n  followed my friend to W., where he met an earlier friend, with whom he\r\n  associated. I became jealous and sick with love and longing. At the\r\n  same time, I associated with women again, but seldom, and only with\r\n  difficulty, indulged in coitus. I became terribly depressed and almost\r\n  insane. Work was out of the question. I led a foolish, wild life, and\r\n  spent a great amount of money, almost throwing it away. Then, after\r\n  six weeks of it, I broke down, and had to visit a water-cure, where I\r\n  spent many months. There I came to myself again, and soon became much\r\n  liked; for I can be very gay, and I take great pleasure in the society\r\n  of educated ladies. In conversation, I prefer married women to younger\r\n  girls; I am also very gay in the society of gentlemen at the\r\n  beer-table and bowling-alley.\r\n\r\n  “At this sanitarium I met a man of twenty-nine, who was apparently\r\n  constituted like myself. The fellow forced himself upon me, and wanted\r\n  to embrace and kiss me; but he was very repugnant to me, though he\r\n  excited me, and his touch caused erection, and even ejaculation. One\r\n  evening he got me to perform mutual onanism. After it I spent a most\r\n  frightful, sleepless night; I was terribly disgusted with the whole\r\n  affair, and thought I should never do such a thing with a man again.\r\n  All day long I could get no rest. It was terrible to me that, in spite\r\n  of this, and against my will, this man so excited me sexually; yet, on\r\n  the other hand, it gave me satisfaction that he was in love with me,\r\n  and apparently had to go through struggles similar to my earlier ones.\r\n  From that time I was successful in keeping him away from me.\r\n\r\n  “I again went to various Universities, and also visited many\r\n  water-cures, with temporary, but never permanent, benefit. I fell in\r\n  love, too, with many friends, but never so deeply as with the friend\r\n  at M. I no longer had sexual intercourse, neither with women—I was\r\n  incapable of it—nor with men; for I had no opportunity for it with the\r\n  latter, and I forced myself to avoid it. I still often met my friend\r\n  of M.; we are as good friends as ever, and, much to my delight, he no\r\n  longer excites me. It is usually so; when for a long time I have not\r\n  seen a person who excites me, the sexual influence disappears.\r\n\r\n  “I passed my examinations with distinction. During the last year\r\n  before they took place,—when I was twenty-three,—I began to practice\r\n  masturbation; for I could find no other way in which to gratify my\r\n  burdensome sexual appetite. Still, I did it very infrequently; for\r\n  after it I was always disgusted, and spent a sleepless night. But when\r\n  I have drunk much, I lose all strength; and then I run about for\r\n  hours, seeking men, and finally come to onanism, to awake the next day\r\n  with a dull head and a horror of myself, and go about all day in a\r\n  melancholy state. As long as I have control of myself, I use all my\r\n  strength to combat my nature. It is terrible when one can have no\r\n  pleasure in associating with friends, and every erect soldier or\r\n  butcher-boy makes one tremble and throb. It is frightful when night\r\n  comes, and I watch at the window for some one to urinate against a\r\n  wall across the way, and give me an opportunity to see his genitals.\r\n  These thoughts are terrible; and besides, there is the consciousness\r\n  of the immorality and criminality of my state of mind and my longing.\r\n  I have a repugnance for myself that I cannot describe. I consider my\r\n  condition abnormal; I cannot think that it is congenital, but I\r\n  believe that the impulse was bred in me by faulty education. My\r\n  suffering makes me reckless and egotistical; it takes away all\r\n  kindness of disposition, and makes me careless about my family. I am\r\n  moody, and often almost insane; often I am so depressed that I know\r\n  not what to do, and then am easily moved to tears. And yet I have a\r\n  horror of sexual intercourse with men. One evening when I came from a\r\n  drinking-party, drunk and excited and in a half-conscious state, and,\r\n  full of desire, was wandering about, I met a young man, who got me to\r\n  perform mutual masturbation. Though he excited me, after the act I was\r\n  beside myself. To-day, when I go by the place, I am overcome with\r\n  horror; and lately, when riding by it, without any cause, I fell from\r\n  my gentle horse, that I know so well,—I was so overcome by the memory\r\n  of my unworthy deed.\r\n\r\n  “I love family life and children, and social intercourse; and, with my\r\n  position in society, I am suited to have a family. But I must give up\r\n  all that; and yet, I cannot abandon hope of cure. And so I vacillate\r\n  between hopeful gaiety and frightful hopelessness, and neglect\r\n  business and family. Indeed, I do not ask that I may marry and found a\r\n  family; I wish only to overcome the terrible inclination for the male\r\n  sex; only to associate quietly with my friends, and to learn to\r\n  respect myself again.\r\n\r\n  “No one has any suspicion of my condition; I pass rather for a great\r\n  _roué_,—a reputation I try to maintain. I often try to have relations\r\n  with girls, for which I often have opportunity. I have known many who\r\n  loved me, and who would have sacrificed their honor for me; but I have\r\n  no love to offer them, and nothing sexual to give. And yet I can love\r\n  a man. I am excited only by young men,—_i.e._, aged from seventeen to\r\n  twenty-five, without full beards, and preferably with no beards at\r\n  all. I can love only those that are educated, respectable, and\r\n  amiable. I am, in short, very proud, and quick; I am also\r\n  enthusiastic, and easily led by persons who please me. These I try to\r\n  imitate, but I am very sensitive with them, and easily hurt. I put\r\n  much value on appearances, love beautiful furniture and dress, and\r\n  assume a distinguished manner and elegant address. I am unhappy in\r\n  that my neurasthenic condition keeps me from doing and learning what I\r\n  should like.”\r\n\r\n  Last fall I made the patient’s acquaintance. He is destitute of\r\n  degenerative signs, and of perfectly masculine appearance, even though\r\n  he is delicately formed and slender. Genitals perfectly normal.\r\n  Appearance distinguished, with nothing striking. He is much troubled\r\n  about his sexual perversion, and wishes to be freed from it at any\r\n  price. In spite of the greatest effort on the part of both physician\r\n  and patient, only a slight degree of hypnosis, insufficient for\r\n  suggestive treatment, could be induced.\r\n\r\n  Case 110. _Psychical Hermaphroditism—Mouth-fetichism._—“I am\r\n  thirty-one years old, and an official in a manufactory. My parents are\r\n  healthy, and have nothing abnormal about them. My paternal grandfather\r\n  is said to have had brain disease; my maternal grandmother died\r\n  melancholic; a cousin of my mother was given to drink; several other\r\n  blood-relations are abnormal mentally.\r\n\r\n  “I was four years old when my sexual appetite awoke. A man between\r\n  twenty and thirty years old, who played with us children, and took us\r\n  in his arms, excited in me the desire to embrace and kiss him\r\n  passionately. This desire for sensual kissing on the mouth is\r\n  characteristic of me, and it still forms the chief charm of my sexual\r\n  gratification.\r\n\r\n  “I experienced a similar excitation in about my ninth year. A man who\r\n  was ugly and dirty, and had a red beard, likewise excited in me this\r\n  desire for him. Here was manifested, for the first time, a\r\n  characteristic peculiar to me, which is still present,—_i.e._, the\r\n  peculiar stimulus which coarseness—the filthiness of a person in dress\r\n  and conduct—is to my senses at times.\r\n\r\n  “While in the Gymnasium, from my eleventh to my fifteenth year, I was\r\n  affected with a passion for a comrade. In this case, it was also my\r\n  greatest pleasure to embrace him, and kiss him on the mouth. I was\r\n  often seized with a desire for him as intense as that I now have for\r\n  persons I love. I think, however, that I first had erections in my\r\n  thirteenth year. During these years, as I have said, I had only the\r\n  desire to embrace and kiss; cupiditas videndi vel tangendi aliorum\r\n  genitalia mihi plane deerat. I was a perfectly innocent, _näive_ boy,\r\n  and, until my fifteenth year, did not know the meaning of an erection;\r\n  indeed, I never once ventured to kiss the beloved person; for I felt\r\n  that it would be doing something strange. I felt no desire to\r\n  masturbate, and also had the good fortune not to be seduced to it by\r\n  older comrades. I have never yet masturbated; I feel a certain\r\n  repugnance for it.\r\n\r\n  “In my fourteenth and fifteenth years I was seized with a passion for\r\n  several young persons, some of whom still attract me. Thus I was very\r\n  much in love with a boy with whom I had never spoken. It was even a\r\n  delight to meet him on the street.\r\n\r\n  “That my passions were of a sensual nature is shown by the fact that,\r\n  when I pressed and caressed the hands of those I loved, I had powerful\r\n  erections. But it has always been my greatest pleasure amplecti et os\r\n  osculari; I desired nothing else.\r\n\r\n  “I did not know that what I experienced was sexual love; I only said\r\n  to myself that it was impossible that I alone felt such stimuli.\r\n\r\n  “Until my fifteenth year a woman had never excited me; but one\r\n  evening, when I was alone with our servant-girl in a room, I\r\n  experienced the same desire that I had for many boys. At first I\r\n  played with her; and, when I found that she liked to be kissed, I\r\n  covered her with kisses. I felt such sensual pleasure in it as I now\r\n  seldom experience. Mouth to mouth, we kissed each other, and after\r\n  about ten minutes ejaculation occurred. Thus I gratified myself two or\r\n  three times a week. I soon began a similar relation with our cook, and\r\n  with other servant-girls. Ejaculation always took place after kissing\r\n  for about ten minutes.\r\n\r\n  “In the meantime, I had taken dancing-lessons. There I was first\r\n  charmed by a nice girl; but this love soon disappeared, and I fell in\r\n  love with another girl, with whom I never became acquainted, but at\r\n  the sight of whom I felt an attraction like that of boys, and unlike\r\n  the purely brutal passion I felt for other girls. At this time my\r\n  impulse for girls was at its acme; I was pleased by about an equal\r\n  number of girls and boys. As mentioned above, I gratified my\r\n  sensuality by kissing the servant-girl and inducing ejaculation. Thus\r\n  I spent the time from my sixteenth to my eighteenth year. The\r\n  departure of the servant deprived me of opportunity.\r\n\r\n  “Then came two or three years during which I had to give up sexual\r\n  pleasure. In general, girls pleased me less; and, too, now that I had\r\n  grown older, I was ashamed to surrender myself to the servant-girls.\r\n\r\n  “It was not possible for me to obtain a mistress; for, notwithstanding\r\n  my years, I was carefully watched by my parents, and associated but\r\n  little with young men, and thus had but little independence. With the\r\n  diminution in the desire for women, the attractiveness of youths\r\n  increased.\r\n\r\n  “Since I had had, since my sixteenth year, frequent pollutions at\r\n  night with dreams,—in part of women and in part of men,—which weakened\r\n  and depressed me exceedingly, I desired to make an end of them by\r\n  means of normal coitus. But scruples and the belief that prostitutes\r\n  would have no effect on me, kept me from the brothel until my\r\n  twenty-first year. For two or three years I went through a daily\r\n  struggle (if there had been male houses of prostitution, no scruples\r\n  would have hindered me). Finally I visited a brothel. I could not even\r\n  induce erection; for one reason because the girl, though she was\r\n  unusually fresh and pretty for a prostitute, did not affect me; but\r\n  really because she would not kiss me on the mouth. I was very much\r\n  depressed, and thought I was impotent. Three weeks afterward I visited\r\n  another prostitute, and she immediately induced erection by her kiss.\r\n  She was erect and had thick lips, and was much more sensual than the\r\n  first one. After only three minutes of simple kissing, mouth to mouth,\r\n  ejaculation was induced,—of course, ante portam. Thus it was only\r\n  after I had visited prostitutes about seven times that I was\r\n  successful in coitus.\r\n\r\n  “At one time I would have no erection at all, because the girl made no\r\n  impression on me; again I would ejaculate prematurely. The first times\r\n  I was reluctant penem introducere; and, too, even after I was\r\n  successful in normal coitus, I found no pleasure in it. Sensual\r\n  satisfaction comes with kissing on the mouth; for me this is the\r\n  principal thing, coitus serving only as something secondary to\r\n  embracing. Coitus, no matter how much the woman might charm me, would\r\n  be an indifferent matter without kissing; indeed, erection disappears,\r\n  or does not occur at all, when the woman will not kiss on the mouth.\r\n  Yet, I cannot kiss every woman, but only such as have faces pleasing\r\n  to me; a prostitute, the sight of whom is repugnant to me, with any\r\n  amount of kissing, which then only disgusts me, cannot excite me.\r\n\r\n  “Thus, during the last four years, I have visited brothels about every\r\n  ten days or two weeks. Only seldom does coitus fail; for I have\r\n  learned my peculiarities, and in the choice of a prostitute know\r\n  immediately whether she will excite me or have no effect. Of late,\r\n  however, it has again happened that I thought the woman would\r\n  stimulate me, and yet no erection occurred. This happened when, the\r\n  day before, I had to repress too forcibly the desire for men.\r\n\r\n  “At first, when I went to brothels, the sensual pleasure was very\r\n  slight; only a very few times did I have true lustful feeling (as in\r\n  kissing previously). Now, on the contrary, for the most part I\r\n  experience sensual pleasure. The lower houses have a particular charm\r\n  for me; for of late the coarseness of the women, the dark entrance,\r\n  the yellow light of the lamps, and all the surroundings, have a\r\n  peculiar charm for me; probably because my sensuality is unconsciously\r\n  excited by meeting soldiers, who frequent such places, and who at the\r\n  same time lend a certain charm to the women. If I but find a woman\r\n  whose face attracts me, I can have intense lustful pleasure. Besides\r\n  by prostitutes, my desire can be excited by peasant-girls,\r\n  servant-girls, working-women, and girls of the lower classes,—in\r\n  general, by those in common dress. Red cheeks, thick lips, and erect\r\n  forms please me particularly. I am absolutely indifferent to\r\n  respectable women and young ladies.\r\n\r\n  “My pollutions are usually without lustful pleasure, and often occur\r\n  with dreams of men, but very seldom—almost never—with dreams of women.\r\n  As is shown by the last circumstance, in spite of regular coitus, my\r\n  desire is still for young men. Indeed, I may say that it has only\r\n  increased, and that very markedly. Though immediately after coitus the\r\n  girls have no charm for me, yet the kiss of a pleasing woman could\r\n  immediately induce erection again. For the first few days after\r\n  coitus, young men seem the most attractive to me.\r\n\r\n  “Sexual congress with women does not satisfy all my sensual desire. I\r\n  have days when I frequently have erections with an intense desire for\r\n  young men; then come quieter days, with moments of complete\r\n  indifference for women and latent desire for men. On the other hand,\r\n  too great sensual rest makes me melancholy; viz., when such rest\r\n  follows moments of repressed excitement. Only, then, when the thought\r\n  of beloved youths again causes erection, do I feel light-hearted\r\n  again. Then the rest changes to intense nervousness; I feel depressed,\r\n  and sometimes have headache (after repressed erection). This\r\n  nervousness often increases to ungovernable restlessness, which I then\r\n  seek to overcome by coitus.\r\n\r\n  “Last year an essential change took place in my sexual life, when I\r\n  dared to enjoy male love for the first time. In spite of pleasurable\r\n  coitus with women (more correctly, pleasurable kissing with resultant\r\n  ejaculation), my desire for young men gave me no peace. I determined\r\n  to go to a brothel much frequented by soldiers, and, in extremity, to\r\n  buy a soldier for myself. I had the good luck to meet immediately one\r\n  like myself, who, notwithstanding his much lower station, in character\r\n  and behavior was not unworthy of me. What I experienced (and still\r\n  experience) with this young man is something different from what I\r\n  feel with women. The sensual pleasure is not greater than with\r\n  prostitutes, whose kisses and embraces excite me extraordinarily; but\r\n  I can experience lustful pleasure with him at any time, and for him I\r\n  have a feeling that is wanting for women. Unfortunately, I have been\r\n  able to embrace and kiss him only about eight times.\r\n\r\n  “Though we have been separated many months, he having been sent to a\r\n  garrison in Hungary, we have not forgotten each other, and keep up a\r\n  regular correspondence. In order to possess him, I dared to go to a\r\n  brothel and there embrace him, being in danger of being betrayed.\r\n\r\n  “Early in our acquaintance there came a time when I heard nothing more\r\n  of him; for he did not think he could trust me. During these weeks I\r\n  endured anxiety and pain that brought me into a state of depression\r\n  and anxious restlessness, such as I had never before experienced.\r\n  Scarcely to have found a lover and then to be compelled to lose him,\r\n  seemed the greatest misfortune to me. When, thanks to my efforts, we\r\n  met again, my joy was unbounded; indeed, I was so excited that, in his\r\n  embrace again for the first time, in spite of my sensual lust, I could\r\n  not induce ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  “Usus sexualis in osculis et amplexionibus solis constitit, pene meo\r\n  ludere ei licebat (while the touch on it of a woman’s hand is\r\n  unendurable to me, and I never allow it). It is also to be noted that,\r\n  in the company of my lover, I immediately have an erection; the\r\n  pressure of his hand, or even his look, is sufficient. Evenings, for\r\n  hours at a time, I have gone about with him, never tiring of his\r\n  society for a moment, despite his inferior station. With him I feel\r\n  happy, and the sexual satisfaction is merely the crowning of our love.\r\n  Although I had finally found the man like myself, whom I had so long\r\n  sought, and I could at last enjoy male love, yet I have not become\r\n  insensitive to women; and I visit brothels when I am too sorely\r\n  troubled by desire. I had hoped to be able to spend this winter in the\r\n  city where my lover is; but this is, unfortunately, impossible, and I\r\n  am now forced to be separated from him for an indefinite period.\r\n  Nevertheless, we shall try to see each other, if only for a short\r\n  time, and only once or twice a year; at least, I hope that in the\r\n  future we may again be together for a longer time. Thus, for this\r\n  winter, I am again compelled to be without a friend like myself. I\r\n  had, indeed, resolved, on account of the danger of discovery, never to\r\n  try to find another urning; but this is impossible. Sexual intercourse\r\n  with women does not satisfy me, and my desire for young men constantly\r\n  increases. I am often afraid of myself; afraid that, in asking all\r\n  prostitutes, as I do, whether they know others like me, I might be\r\n  discovered. Yet I cannot keep from seeking a youth like myself;\r\n  indeed, I know that in case of necessity I shall buy a soldier, though\r\n  I know perfectly well the penalty meted out to one caught in such\r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\n  “I can no longer do without male love; without it I should always be\r\n  out of harmony with myself. My ideal would be to be associated with a\r\n  number like myself; but I should be satisfied if I could have\r\n  unrestrained intercourse with one lover. I could easily dispense with\r\n  women, if I had regular male satisfaction; but I think that at long\r\n  intervals I should embrace a woman for the sake of variety, as my\r\n  nature is absolutely hermaphroditic in a psycho-sexual sense (women I\r\n  can only desire sensually, but I can love and sensually desire young\r\n  men). If there were marriage between men, I think I should not avoid a\r\n  life-long union; while marriage with a woman seems to me something\r\n  impossible. For, in the first place, though the woman charmed me, the\r\n  charm would soon be lost in regular intercourse, and then all sexual\r\n  indulgence, if not impossible, would certainly be devoid of pleasure\r\n  for me; and, in the second place, true love for the wife would be\r\n  wanting—the attraction that I feel with young men I love, and which\r\n  makes the intercourse that is not simply sensual seem desirable to me.\r\n  The constant association with a youth physically pleasing and in\r\n  mental harmony with me, and who could understand all my feelings and\r\n  share my intellectual opinions and desires, would, it seems to me, be\r\n  the greatest happiness.\r\n\r\n  “The young men who please me must be between eighteen and\r\n  twenty-eight. As I have grown older, the limit of age in those\r\n  pleasing to me has increased; otherwise, I am pleased with the most\r\n  various forms. The principal _rôle_, if not the exclusive one, is\r\n  played by the face. Blondes excite me more than dark persons; they\r\n  must have no beard, but merely a small moustache that is not too\r\n  thick, or none at all. As for the rest, the only thing I can say is,\r\n  that certain kinds of faces please me. Faces with large, straight\r\n  noses are excluded, as are also pale cheeks; but there are exceptions.\r\n  I regard soldiers with favor, and many please me when in uniform who\r\n  do not affect me when in civil dress. Just as in women certain\r\n  ordinary articles of dress (like light-colored jackets) please me, so\r\n  the military costume attracts me. To go to dance-halls—usually\r\n  beer-halls—where there are many soldiers, and mix with the crowd of\r\n  soldiers and boys that please me, and try to get a kiss and\r\n  embrace,—this mingling with them would, of course, be an excitant only\r\n  of sensuality; intellectually and socially, everything common in\r\n  speech and conduct is repugnant to me.\r\n\r\n  “With young men of higher position, my sensual desire is less\r\n  prominent.\r\n\r\n  “What I have said of the attractiveness of certain kinds of dress is\r\n  not to be understood in the sense that they attract me in themselves.\r\n  This charm only means that the dress may help to strengthen or make\r\n  prominent the attraction exerted by the face, when, perhaps, the same\r\n  face in itself would not attract me to the same extent. I may say the\r\n  same thing, though with a different meaning, of the odor of lighted\r\n  cigars. In indifferent persons the odor of cigars is rather repugnant\r\n  than pleasing to me, but exciting in those sexually attractive. The\r\n  kiss of a prostitute smelling of cigar-smoke, affords greater pleasure\r\n  (because, even though in part unconsciously, I am reminded of the kiss\r\n  of a man). Therefore, I took pleasure in kissing my lover just after\r\n  he had smoked. (It is to be noted that I myself have never smoked a\r\n  cigar or cigarette, and have never even tried to smoke.) I am tall and\r\n  thin; my face is masculine; my eyes are restless; and in my whole form\r\n  I often have something girlish. My health leaves much to be desired.\r\n  It is much influenced by my sexual anomaly. As previously mentioned, I\r\n  am very nervous, and I often have paroxysms of onomatomania. At times,\r\n  I also have terrible depression and melancholia, when I see the\r\n  difficulty of gratification corresponding with my male-loving nature;\r\n  and when I am greatly excited sexually, and have overcome the desire,\r\n  owing to impossibility of male gratification. In such conditions,\r\n  often the depression is associated with absolute lack of sexual\r\n  desire. In work I am industrious, but often too quick; for I am\r\n  inclined to work too rapidly and violently. I have a lively interest\r\n  in art and literature. Among poets and writers of fiction, I prefer,\r\n  for the most part, those who describe refined feelings, peculiar\r\n  passions, and far-fetched impressions; an artificial or\r\n  hyper-artificial style pleases me. Likewise in music, it is the\r\n  nervous, exciting music of a Chopin, a Schumann, a Schubert, or a\r\n  Wagner, etc., that is in most perfect harmony with me. Everything in\r\n  art that is not only original, but _bizarre_, attracts me.\r\n\r\n  “I do not like physical exercise, and do not practice it.\r\n\r\n  “In character I am kind and compassionate; and, though I have much to\r\n  suffer with my anomaly, I am not unhappy because I love young men, but\r\n  because the satisfaction of such love is considered improper, and\r\n  because I cannot gratify it without restraint. I cannot regard male\r\n  love as a vice, though I can well understand why it is considered\r\n  vicious. But, since this love is regarded as criminal, in gratifying\r\n  it I am in harmony with myself, but not with our age of the world;\r\n  and, therefore, I must, necessarily, be somewhat depressed; the more,\r\n  since I have a frank character that hates a lie. The pain of having\r\n  always to hide it all in myself has induced me to confess my anomaly\r\n  to a few friends, of whose silence and appreciation I am confident.\r\n  Nevertheless, my situation often seems sad. On account of the\r\n  difficulty of gratification and the general abhorrence of male love, I\r\n  am often a little proud that I have such anomalous feelings. Of\r\n  course, I shall never marry. This does not seem any misfortune, even\r\n  though I love family life, and have thus far lived only with my\r\n  parents. I live in the hope that later I shall have a lover; I must\r\n  have one; without one, the future seems dark and barren, and all the\r\n  ambitions usually cherished—honor, position, etc.—seem empty and\r\n  unattractive. If I should not have this hope fulfilled, I know I shall\r\n  be unable to long devote myself to my business with pleasure, and I\r\n  shall soon be in a condition to sacrifice everything to obtain male\r\n  love. I no longer have any moral scruples on account of my anomalous\r\n  inclination; I have, in fact, never been troubled because I felt\r\n  attracted to boys. I am much more inclined to judge morality and\r\n  immorality in accordance with my feelings than in accordance with\r\n  fixed principles; for I have always been given to skepticism, and have\r\n  never yet studied out a fixed belief for myself. As yet, only what\r\n  injures others seems to me to be evil and immoral, and that that I\r\n  would not have inflicted on myself; and, in this direction, I may say\r\n  that I try to infringe on the rights of others as little as possible,\r\n  and that I am capable of great indignation at injustice inflicted on\r\n  another. But, why love of men should be something immoral, I cannot\r\n  understand; purposeless activity of the sexual instinct (if the\r\n  immoral is to be seen in all that is useless and unnatural) is also\r\n  found in intercourse with prostitutes, and even in marriage where\r\n  means to prevent conception are used; and it seems to me that the\r\n  sexual intercourse of men must be placed on the same level with all\r\n  sexual congress that has not procreation as an end. But that only\r\n  sexual gratification that has this purpose is moral, seems to me to be\r\n  questionable. Certainly, sexual satisfaction that is not directed to\r\n  procreation is not contrary to nature; and, whether it has not other\r\n  purposes unknown to us, is uncertain; and, even if it were\r\n  purposeless, it would not necessarily be despicable (it is not certain\r\n  that the measure of a moral act is its usefulness).\r\n\r\n  “I am very certain that present prejudice will disappear, and that\r\n  when once such individuals experience male-love, the right of\r\n  unrestricted love will be acknowledged. For the possibility of such\r\n  recognition one need but recall the Greeks and their friendships,\r\n  which were nothing but sexual love; and one has only to think that,\r\n  despite such unnatural vice, practiced by their greatest men in\r\n  intellectual and æsthetic matters, the Greeks are still regarded as an\r\n  unattainable example, and held up for imitation.\r\n\r\n  “I have already thought of having my anomaly cured by hypnotism. If it\r\n  were to be of any use, which I doubt, yet I should certainly desire to\r\n  be assured of a lasting love for women. For even though I cannot\r\n  satisfy myself with men, yet I prefer to feel this capability of\r\n  inordinate lust and love, even ungratified, to being absolutely\r\n  without feeling. Thus I still have the hope that I shall find\r\n  opportunity to satisfy the love I desire, the love that would make me\r\n  happy; and I should not prefer the suggestive removal of homo-sexual\r\n  feelings, without the simultaneous substitution of a hetero-sexual\r\n  equivalent, to my present condition. Finally, I should like to add, in\r\n  contrast with the statements of urnings in the published biographies,\r\n  that I, at least, find it very difficult to recognize those like\r\n  myself. Though I have described my sexual anomaly somewhat in detail,\r\n  it seems to me that the following notes are important for a better\r\n  understanding of my condition:—\r\n\r\n  “Of late I have given up immissio penis, and confined myself to coitus\r\n  inter femoræ puellæ. Ejaculation occurs earlier than with conjunctio\r\n  membrorum, and I experience a certain lustful feeling in the penis\r\n  itself. If this manner of sexual intercourse is quite pleasant to me,\r\n  it is, perhaps, in part to be referred to the fact that in this kind\r\n  of sexual indulgence the sex is quite indifferent, and I am, perhaps,\r\n  unconsciously reminded of masculine embrace. But this memory is\r\n  absolutely unconscious, and but obscurely felt; for I am not indebted\r\n  to my imagination for my pleasure, but it is due immediately to\r\n  kissing the woman’s mouth. I feel that the charm which the brothel and\r\n  prostitutes have for me also begins to fade; but I am sure certain\r\n  women will always be able to excite me by their kisses. Still, no\r\n  woman is, or ever will be, so attractive as to induce me to overcome\r\n  obstacles in winning her; but even the danger of discovery and\r\n  disgrace could only with difficulty restrain me from seeking a man’s\r\n  embraces.\r\n\r\n  “Thus I lately allowed myself to be induced to buy a soldier at a\r\n  prostitute’s house. The lustful pleasure was very great, but the\r\n  subsequent feeling of satisfaction was especially very exhilarating.\r\n  The next day I felt similarly strengthened (capable of erection at any\r\n  moment); and though I have not yet been able to meet the soldier\r\n  again, the thought that I shall venture to purchase another gives me\r\n  peace. But I could be perfectly satisfied only in finding one feeling\r\n  like myself, of my own position and education.\r\n\r\n  “I have not yet mentioned that the female form (with the exception of\r\n  the face) and genitals have no attraction for me (to touch the latter\r\n  with my hand would be disgusting to me); but membrum virile me tangere\r\n  dum os meum os ejus osculatur, mihi exoptatum esse; indeed, to kiss\r\n  that of a very pleasing man would not be disgusting to me. Onanism, as\r\n  has been said, would be quite impossible for me.”\r\n\r\n  Case 111. _Psychical Hermaphroditism._-Hetero-sexual feeling early\r\n  interfered with by masturbation, but episodically very intense.\r\n  Homo-sexual feeling _ab origine_ perverse (sexual excitation by men’s\r\n  boots).\r\n\r\n  Mr. X., of high social position, Russian, aged 28, came to me in\r\n  September, 1887, in a despairing mood, to consult me on account of a\r\n  perversion of his vita sexualis, which made life seem almost\r\n  unbearable to him, and which had repeatedly brought him near to\r\n  suicide. The patient comes of a family in which neuroses and psychoses\r\n  have been of frequent occurrence. In the father’s family there had\r\n  been consanguineous marriages for three generations. The father is\r\n  said to have been a healthy man, and to have lived morally in\r\n  marriage. However, his father’s preference for fine-looking servants\r\n  seems remarkable to the son. The mother’s family is described as\r\n  eccentric. The mother’s grandfather and great-grandfather died\r\n  melancholic; her sister was insane; a daughter of the grandfather’s\r\n  brother was hysterical, and had nymphomania. Only three of the\r\n  mother’s twelve brothers and sisters married. Of these, one brother\r\n  was homo-sexual, and always nervous as a result of excessive\r\n  masturbation.\r\n\r\n  The patient’s mother is said to be a bigot, and of small mental\r\n  endowment, nervous, irritable, and inclined to melancholia. Patient\r\n  has a sister and a brother. The brother is frequently melancholy, and,\r\n  though mature, has never shown the slightest trace of sexual\r\n  inclinations. The sister is an acknowledged beauty, and much sought by\r\n  gentlemen. This lady is married, but childless, as reported, owing to\r\n  the impotence of her husband. She has always been indifferent to the\r\n  attentions shown her by men, but is charmed by female beauty, and\r\n  actually in love with some of her female friends.\r\n\r\n  With respect of himself, the patient asserts that, when four years\r\n  old, he dreamed of handsome jockeys wearing shining boots. Too, he\r\n  never dreamed of women when he grew older. His nightly pollutions were\r\n  always induced by “boot-dreams.” From his fourth year he had a\r\n  peculiar partiality for men, or, more correctly, for lackeys wearing\r\n  shining boots. At first they only excited his interest, but, with\r\n  development of his sexual functions, the sight of them caused powerful\r\n  erections and lustful pleasure. It was only servants’ boots that\r\n  affected him; the same kind of boots on persons of like social station\r\n  were without effect on him. In a homo-sexual sense, there was no\r\n  sexual impulse connected with these situations. Even the thought of\r\n  such a possibility was disgusting to him. At times, however, he had\r\n  sensually-colored ideas,—like being his servant’s servant, and drawing\r\n  off his boots; but the idea of being stepped on by him, or of having\r\n  to blacken his boots, was most pleasing. The pride of the aristocrat\r\n  rose up against such thoughts. In general, these notions about boots\r\n  were disgusting and painful to him.\r\n\r\n  Sexual instinct was early and powerfully developed. It first found\r\n  expression in indulgence in sensual thoughts about boots, and, after\r\n  puberty, in dreams accompanied by pollutions; otherwise, the mental\r\n  and physical development was undisturbed. Patient was well endowed\r\n  mentally,—learned easily, finished his studies, and became an officer.\r\n  On account of his distinguished, manly appearance and his high\r\n  position, he was much sought in society.\r\n\r\n  He characterizes himself as a clever, quiet, strong-willed, but\r\n  superficial man. He asserts that he is a passionate hunter and rider,\r\n  and that he has never had any inclination for feminine pursuits. In\r\n  the society of ladies he has always been reserved; dancing always\r\n  tired him. He had never had any interest in a lady of high social\r\n  position. As for women, only the buxom peasant girls, such as are the\r\n  models of painters in Rome, had interested him. He had, however, never\r\n  felt any sexual interest in such representatives of the female sex. In\r\n  the theatre and circus only male performers had excited his interest;\r\n  but, at the same time, they had caused him no sensual feelings. As for\r\n  men, only their boots excited him, and, indeed, only when the wearers\r\n  belonged to the servant class and were handsome men. Men of his own\r\n  position, wearing never so fine boots, were absolutely indifferent to\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  With reference to his sexual inclinations, the patient is still\r\n  uncertain whether he feels more inclination toward the opposite sex or\r\n  toward his own sex. He is inclined to think that originally he had\r\n  more inclination for women, but that this sympathy was, in any case,\r\n  very weak. He states with certainty that the sight of a naked man made\r\n  no impression on him, and that the sight of male genitals was even\r\n  repugnant to him. In the case of women, this was not exactly the case,\r\n  but he was not excited sexually even by the most beautiful feminine\r\n  form. When a young officer, he was now and then compelled to accompany\r\n  his comrades to brothels. He was the more easily persuaded to this,\r\n  since he hoped by this means to be rid of his vile partiality for\r\n  boots; but he was impotent unless he brought the thought of boots to\r\n  his aid. Under such circumstances, the act of cohabitation was\r\n  normally performed, but without pleasurable feeling. Patient felt no\r\n  impulse to intercourse with women, always requiring some external\r\n  cause,—_i.e._, persuasion. Left to himself, his vita sexualis\r\n  consisted in reveling in ideas about boots, and in corresponding\r\n  dreams with pollutions. Since more and more there became connected\r\n  with them the impulse to kiss his servant’s boots, to draw them off,\r\n  etc., the patient determined to use every means to rid himself of this\r\n  disgusting desire, which deeply wounded his pride. At that time, being\r\n  in his twentieth year, and in Paris, he recalled a very beautiful\r\n  peasant girl, who lived in his distant home. He hoped, with her\r\n  assistance, to free himself of his perverse sexual inclination. He\r\n  went directly home, and tried to win the girl’s favor. It seems that\r\n  the patient was not naturally homo-sexual. He asserts that at that\r\n  time he was actually in love with this person, and that her glance, or\r\n  the touch of her dress, gave him sensual pleasure; and, when she once\r\n  kissed him, he had a powerful erection. After about a year and a half,\r\n  the patient succeeded in gaining his desires with this person.\r\n\r\n  He was potent, but ejaculated tardily (ten to twenty minutes), and\r\n  never had a pleasurable feeling in the act.\r\n\r\n  After about a year and a half of sexual intercourse with this girl,\r\n  his love for her grew cold, because he did not find her so “fine and\r\n  pure” as he wished. From this time it was necessary for him to call\r\n  upon ideas about boots for help, which had been latent, in order to be\r\n  potent in sexual intercourse with her. In proportion as his power\r\n  failed, these ideas arose spontaneously. Thereafter he had coitus with\r\n  other women. Now and then, especially when the woman was in sympathy\r\n  with him, the act took place without any assistance of imagination. It\r\n  once happened that the patient committed a rape. It is remarkable that\r\n  on this single occasion he had a pleasurable feeling in the (forced)\r\n  act. Immediately after the deed he had a feeling of disgust. When, an\r\n  hour after the forced indulgence, he had coitus with the same woman,\r\n  with her consent, he experienced no feeling of pleasure.\r\n\r\n  With decrease of virility,—_i.e._, when it was preserved only in\r\n  connection with ideas about boots,—libido for the opposite sex\r\n  decreased. The patient’s slight libido and weak inclination for women\r\n  are evidenced by the fact that, while he still sustained sexual\r\n  relations with the peasant girl, he began to masturbate. He learned\r\n  the vice from “Rousseau’s Confessions,” the book accidentally falling\r\n  into his hands. The boot-fancies immediately linked themselves with\r\n  corresponding impulses. He then had violent erections, masturbated,\r\n  and ejaculation afforded him a lively feeling of pleasure, which was\r\n  denied to him in coitus; and at first he felt himself fresher and\r\n  brighter, as a result of the masturbation.\r\n\r\n  In time, however, symptoms of sexual, and, later, of general,\r\n  neurasthenia, with spinal irritation, appeared. He then at first gave\r\n  up masturbation, and sought his first love; but she was now more than\r\n  ever indifferent to him. Since he finally became impotent, even when\r\n  he called ideas of boots to his assistance, he gave up women entirely,\r\n  and again practiced masturbation; by which he felt himself protected\r\n  from the impulse to kiss and blacken servants’ boots. At the same\r\n  time, he continued to feel that his sexual position was a painful one.\r\n  He again occasionally attempted coitus, and was successful in it as\r\n  soon as he thought of blackened boots. Too, after continued abstinence\r\n  from masturbation, he was sometimes successful in coitus without any\r\n  artificial aid.\r\n\r\n  The patient says that his sexual needs are intense. If he has not had\r\n  an ejaculation in a long time, he becomes congestive and psychically\r\n  much excited, and tormented by repugnant images of boots, so that he\r\n  is forced to have coitus, or, preferably, to masturbate.\r\n\r\n  For some time his moral position has been complicated most painfully\r\n  by the fact that, as the last of a wealthy line of high position, and\r\n  at the importunate desire of his parents, he must marry. The bride is\r\n  of rare beauty, and mentally in perfect sympathy with him; but, as a\r\n  woman, she is as indifferent to him as any other. Æsthetically she\r\n  satisfies him “as a work of art;” in his eyes, she is an ideal. To\r\n  honor her in a platonic way would be happiness worth striving for; but\r\n  to possess her as a wife is a painful thought. He is certain\r\n  beforehand that with her he will be impotent, save with the help of\r\n  ideas of boots. To use such means, however, is in opposition to his\r\n  respect and his moral and æsthetic feeling for the lady. Were he to\r\n  soil her with such thoughts, she would lose, in his eyes, all her\r\n  æsthetic value; and then he would become impotent for her, and she\r\n  would become repugnant to him. The patient considers his position one\r\n  of despair, and confesses that he has lately been repeatedly near\r\n  suicide.\r\n\r\n  He is a man of much intelligence, and decidedly of masculine\r\n  appearance, with abundant growth of beard, deep voice, and normal\r\n  genitals. The eye has a neuropathic expression. No signs of\r\n  degeneration. Symptoms of spinal neurasthenia. It was possible to\r\n  reassure the patient, and give him hope of his future.\r\n\r\n  The medical advice consisted in means for combating the neurasthenia,\r\n  and the interdiction of masturbation and indulgence of the fancy in\r\n  images of boots, in the hope that, with the removal of the\r\n  neurasthenia, cohabitation without ideas of boots would become\r\n  possible; and that, in time, the patient would become morally and\r\n  physically capable of marriage.\r\n\r\n  In the latter part of October, 1888, the patient wrote me that he had\r\n  resolutely resisted masturbation and his imagination. In the interval\r\n  he had had but one dream about boots, and scarcely a pollution. He had\r\n  been free from homo-sexual inclinations, but, in spite of this, there\r\n  was often considerable sexual excitement, without anything like\r\n  adequate libido for women. In this deplorable situation, he was\r\n  compelled, by circumstances, to marry in three months.\r\n\r\n_2. Homo-Sexual Individuals, or Urnings._—In distinction from the\r\npreceding group of psycho-sexual hermaphrodites, there are here, _ab\r\norigine_, sexual desires and inclinations for persons of the same sex\r\nexclusively; but, in contrast with the following group, the anomaly is\r\nlimited to the vita sexualis, and does not more deeply and seriously\r\naffect the character and mental personality.\r\n\r\nThe vita sexualis of these urnings, _mutatis mutandis_, is entirely like\r\nthat in normal hetero-sexual love; but, since it is the exact opposite\r\nof the natural feeling, it becomes a caricature, and this the more,\r\nsince these individuals, at the same time, as a rule, are subject to\r\nhyperæsthesia sexualis, and, therefore, their love for their own sex is\r\nemotional and passionate.\r\n\r\nThe urning loves and deifies the male object of his affections, just as\r\na man idealizes the woman he loves. He is capable of the greatest\r\nsacrifice for him, and experiences the pangs of unfortunate, often\r\nunrequited, love; suffers from the unfaithfulness of the beloved object,\r\nand is subject to jealousy, etc.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the male-loving man is given only to male dancers,\r\nactors, athletes, statues, etc. The sight of female charms is\r\nindifferent to him, if not repulsive. A naked woman is disgusting to\r\nhim, while the sight of male genitals, hips, etc., affords him infinite\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe bodily contact of a sympathetic man induces a thrill of delight;\r\nand, since such individuals are mostly sexually neurasthenic,\r\ncongenitally or from onanism or enforced abstinence from sexual\r\nintercourse, under such circumstances ejaculation is very easily\r\ninduced, which, in the most intimate intercourse with women, cannot be\r\ninduced at all, or only by mechanical means. The sexual act with a man,\r\nin many instances, affords pleasure, and leaves behind a feeling of\r\nwell-being. Should the urning be able to force himself to coitus, in\r\nwhich, as a rule, disgust has the effect of an inhibitory concept, and\r\nmakes the act impossible, then his feeling is something like that of a\r\nman compelled to take disgusting food or drink. However, experience\r\nteaches that not infrequently urnings falling in this group marry,\r\neither out of ethical or social considerations.\r\n\r\nSuch unfortunates are relatively potent, in that in marital intercourse\r\nthey incite their imagination, and, instead of thinking of their wives,\r\nthey call up the image of some loved male person. But for them coitus is\r\na great sacrifice, and no pleasure; and it makes them, for days after,\r\nnervous and miserable. If such urnings, by means of powerful excitation\r\nof their imagination, or under the influence of alcoholic drinks, or by\r\nerections induced by an overfilled bladder, etc., are enabled to\r\novercome the inhibitory feelings and ideas, then they are still entirely\r\nimpotent; while simply the touch of a man may induce powerful erection,\r\nand even ejaculation.\r\n\r\nDancing with a woman is unpleasant to an urning, but to dance with a\r\nman, especially one with an attractive form, seems to him the greatest\r\nof pleasures. The male urning, in so far as he possesses higher culture,\r\nis not opposed to non-sexual intercourse with women, when by mind and\r\nrefinement they make conversation pleasant. It is only of woman in her\r\nsexual _rôle_ that he has a horror. The homo-sexual woman offers the\r\nsame manifestations, _mutatis mutandis_. In this degree of sexual\r\ndegeneration, character and occupation correspond with the sex which the\r\nindividual represents. The sexual perversion remains isolated, but an\r\nanomaly of the mental being of the individual which deeply affects the\r\nsocial existence. In accordance with this, many of these individuals, in\r\nthe sexual act, feel themselves in the _rôle_ which would naturally\r\nbelong to them in hetero-sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nHowever, transitions to group 3 occur, in as much as sometimes the\r\npassive _rôle_ which corresponds with the homo-sexual manner of feeling,\r\nis thought of or desired, or at least forms the subject of dreams.\r\nMoreover, inclinations for occupations and tendencies of taste are\r\nmanifested, which do not correspond with the sex of the individual. In\r\nmany cases, one gets the impression that such symptoms are artificial,\r\nthe result of educational influences; in other cases, that they\r\nrepresent deeper acquired degenerations of the original anomaly, induced\r\nby the perverse sexual activity (masturbation), analogous to the signs\r\nof progressive degeneration observed in acquired inversion of the sexual\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the manner of sexual satisfaction, it must be stated that\r\nwith many male urnings simple embraces are sufficient to induce\r\nejaculation, since they are subject to irritable weakness of the sexual\r\napparatus. In case of sexual hyperæsthesia, and where there is\r\nparæsthesia of the moral sense, great pleasure is afforded by\r\nintercourse with persons of the lowest condition. On the same basis,\r\ndesires to commit pederasty (active, of course) and other similar acts\r\noccur, though it is but seldom, and apparently only in cases of moral\r\ndefect, and by reason of libido nimia in individuals especially\r\npassionate, that pederasty is indulged in. The sensual desire of mature\r\nurnings, _in contradistinction from old and decrepit debauchees, who\r\nprefer boys (and indulge in pederasty by preference), seems never to be\r\ndirected to immature males_. Only for want of better material, and in\r\ncase of violent passion, does the urning become dangerous to boys. The\r\nmanner of sexual satisfaction in female urnings may be mutual and\r\npassive masturbation. To them coitus is quite as disgusting, wearisome,\r\nand inadequate as it is to the male urning.\r\n\r\n  Case 112. The following is an extract from a very circumstantial\r\n  autobiography which a physician affected with contrary sexual instinct\r\n  has put at my disposal:—\r\n\r\n  “I am now forty years old, of healthy family,[114] and have always\r\n  been healthy and considered a model of physical and mental strength\r\n  and energy. I am of powerful build, but have only a moderate beard,\r\n  and, with the exception of hair in the axillæ and on the mons veneris,\r\n  my body is hairless. The penis, even soon after birth unusually large,\r\n  measures, in statu erectionis, 24 centimetres long by 11 centimetres\r\n  in circumference. I am a skillful rider, athlete, and swimmer, and\r\n  have passed through two great campaigns as a military surgeon. I never\r\n  experienced any taste for female attire and vocation. Up to the time\r\n  of puberty I was shy toward the female sex, and I am yet shy with new\r\n  acquaintances.\r\n\r\n  “I have always had a distaste for dancing. In my eighth year an\r\n  inclination for my own sex made its appearance. I next experienced\r\n  pleasure in regarding my brother’s genitals. I induced my brother to\r\n  indulge with me in mutual fondling of the genitals, as a result of\r\n  which I had an erection. Later, in bathing with the school-children,\r\n  the boys excited a lively interest in me; the girls, none at all. I\r\n  had so little interest in them that, as late as my fifteenth year, I\r\n  believed that they also had a penis. In company with boys like myself,\r\n  I took pleasure in mutual manustupration. At eleven and a half years I\r\n  was given a strict tutor, and thereafter could steal to my friends but\r\n  seldom. I learned very easily, but could not get along with my\r\n  teacher; and when one day he made it too hard for me, I became furious\r\n  and struck at him with a knife, and would have gladly stabbed him, if\r\n  he had not fallen into my arms. In my thirteenth year, for a similar\r\n  cause, I escaped from the teacher, and wandered about for six weeks in\r\n  the neighboring country.\r\n\r\n  “I now entered the Gymnasium. At that time I was already sexually\r\n  developed, and amused myself while bathing with my comrades in the way\r\n  above mentioned, and later by imitatio coitus between the thighs. I\r\n  was then thirteen years old. I took absolutely no pleasure with girls.\r\n  Violent erections caused me to play with my genitals, and I came to\r\n  take my penis in my mouth, which I succeeded in doing by bending over.\r\n  This induced ejaculation. I thus learned masturbation. I was much\r\n  frightened, looked upon myself as a criminal, and confessed to a\r\n  companion of sixteen. He encouraged and quieted me, and entered into a\r\n  love-bond with me. We were happy, and satisfied ourselves by mutual\r\n  onanism. At the same time, I masturbated. After two years the bond was\r\n  broken; but to this day, when we occasionally meet,—my friend is a\r\n  high official,—the old fire lights up anew.\r\n\r\n  “That time with my friend H. was a happy one, the return of which I\r\n  would gladly buy with my heart’s blood. Then life was a pleasure,\r\n  learning was mere play, and I had a feeling for everything beautiful.\r\n\r\n  “During this time a physician, a friend of my father’s, seduced me by\r\n  caressing me and practicing masturbation on me on the occasion of a\r\n  visit, and by explaining the sexual act to me. He advised me never to\r\n  practice manustupration, since it was injurious to health. He then\r\n  practiced mutual onanism with me, and explained that this was the only\r\n  way in which he could perform the sexual function. He had a horror of\r\n  women, and, therefore, had lived unhappily with his deceased wife. He\r\n  gave me a pressing invitation to visit him as often as possible. The\r\n  physician was a pompous man, and the father of two sons aged fourteen\r\n  and fifteen respectively, with whom in the following year I entered\r\n  into love-relations similar to those I had with my friend H.\r\n\r\n  “I was ashamed of my unfaithfulness to him, but at the same time\r\n  continued my relations with the physician. He practiced mutual\r\n  masturbation with me, showed me our spermatozoa under the microscope,\r\n  and pornographic works and pictures, which, however, did not please\r\n  me, because I had interest only for male forms. On the occasion of\r\n  later visits, he asked me to do him a favor which he had never yet\r\n  enjoyed, and which he very much desired. Since I loved him, I\r\n  acquiesced in everything. He dilated my anus with instruments, and\r\n  practiced pederasty on me, and at the same time performed\r\n  masturbation, so that I experienced pleasure and pain at once. After\r\n  this discovery I went immediately to my friend H., with the thought\r\n  that this beloved man would be able to give me still greater pleasure.\r\n  We practiced pederasty on each other, but were both deceived, and did\r\n  not repeat it; for passively I had only pain, and actively no\r\n  pleasure, while mutual onanism gave us both the greatest enjoyment.\r\n  Thereafter, out of gratitude, I was still frequently at the disposal\r\n  of the physician only. Up to my fifteenth year I practiced passive or\r\n  mutual onanism with my friend. Now I was quite grown, and had all\r\n  kinds of signs made to me by women and girls; but I fled from them as\r\n  Joseph did from Potiphar’s wife. At fifteen I came to the Capital. I\r\n  had but infrequent opportunity for the satisfaction of my sexual\r\n  inclination. I reveled in the sight of pictures and statues of male\r\n  forms, and could not keep from kissing the beloved statues. The\r\n  fig-leaves on the genitals were my principal annoyance.\r\n\r\n  “At seventeen I went to the University. There, again, I lived two\r\n  years with my friend H.\r\n\r\n  “When I was in my eighteenth year, while in a state of mild\r\n  intoxication, I was set on to have coitus with a woman. I forced\r\n  myself to it, but immediately afterward I fled the house, overcome\r\n  with disgust. Just as after the first active manustupration, I had a\r\n  feeling as if I had committed a crime. On the occasion of another\r\n  attempt, while in a sober condition, in spite of every effort of a\r\n  beautiful naked girl, I could not get an erection; though the mere\r\n  sight of a boy or the touch of a man’s hand on my thigh, would always\r\n  throw my penis into violent erection. A short time before, my friend\r\n  H. had had a similar experience. In vain we racked our brains to\r\n  discover the reason for it. Now I let women alone, and found enjoyment\r\n  with friends in passive and mutual onanism, among others with both the\r\n  sons of the physician, who had used them for pederasty after my\r\n  departure.\r\n\r\n  “When nineteen years old, I made the acquaintance of two genuine\r\n  urnings:—\r\n\r\n  “A., aged 56, of effeminate appearance, beardless, of small endowment\r\n  mentally, possessing a powerful sexual desire that had been manifested\r\n  abnormally early, had indulged in urnings’ love since his sixth year.\r\n  Once a month he visited the Capital. I had to sleep with him. He was\r\n  insatiable in mutual onanism, and made me take part in active and\r\n  passive pederasty, which was an unpleasant part of the bargain for\r\n  me.”\r\n\r\n  “B., a merchant, aged 36, of masculine appearance, was as passionate\r\n  as I was. He knew how to make his manipulations on me such a stimulus\r\n  that I had to serve him passively in pederasty. He was the only one\r\n  with whom I ever had any pleasure in passive pederasty. He confessed\r\n  to me that when he but knew that I was near, he had the most painful\r\n  erections; and that when I could not serve him, he was compelled to\r\n  satisfy himself by masturbation.\r\n\r\n  “While pursuing these love-affairs, I was clinical assistant in\r\n  hospital, and was considered ambitious and skillful in my work. I\r\n  naturally sought throughout literature for an explanation of my sexual\r\n  peculiarity. I found it in part as a crime deserving punishment, while\r\n  for myself I could only recognize in it the natural satisfaction of my\r\n  sexual desire. I was aware that this was congenital with me. But\r\n  feeling myself in opposition to the whole world, often near insanity\r\n  and suicide, I again sought to satisfy my powerful sexual desire with\r\n  women. The result was always the same,—either want of sufficient\r\n  erection, or, when it became possible, to force myself to the act,\r\n  disgust and horror of its repetition. As a military surgeon, I\r\n  suffered terribly from the sight and touch of thousands of naked male\r\n  forms. Fortunately, I formed a love-bond with a lieutenant affected\r\n  similarly, and passed again a time of happiness. For love of him I\r\n  consented to pederasty, for which he longed. We loved each other until\r\n  he lost his life at Sedan. From that time I never gave myself to\r\n  active or passive pederasty, although I had many love-affairs, and was\r\n  a person much sought.\r\n\r\n  “At twenty-three I went to the country as a physician, and was sought\r\n  and esteemed. I satisfied myself with boys over fourteen. I interested\r\n  myself in political affairs, and made an enemy of the clergyman, and,\r\n  being betrayed by one of my lovers, was denounced and compelled to\r\n  flee. The legal investigation, fortunately, did me no harm. I was able\r\n  to return, but I was greatly shaken; and I went to the war (1870) as a\r\n  soldier, in the hope of meeting my death. I returned, however, with\r\n  many distinctions, much matured; and I found still more pleasure in\r\n  earnest work in my profession. I hoped that the extinction of my\r\n  excessive sexual desire was near at hand, exhausted by the great\r\n  hardships of the campaign.\r\n\r\n  “Scarcely had I recovered, when the old unbounded desire again\r\n  appeared, and led to new unbridled satisfaction. Of course, I often\r\n  thought of it; but my inclination, so revolting to the world, did not\r\n  seem so to me.\r\n\r\n  “For a year, by means of the greatest exercise of my will, I\r\n  abstained; then I went to the Capital to force myself to cohabit with\r\n  a woman. I, who at the sight of the dirtiest ragamuffin had painful\r\n  erections, could scarcely induce one with the most beautiful woman.\r\n  Overcome, I returned home and obtained a young man-servant for my\r\n  personal service and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  “The solitude of life as a country physician, and the longing for\r\n  children, drove me to marriage; besides, I wished to make an end to\r\n  gossip, and I hoped finally to triumph over my fatal desire.\r\n\r\n  “I knew a young girl, of whose respect and love for me I was\r\n  convinced. Through my esteem and honor for my wife, I was enabled to\r\n  perform the conjugal duties, and begat four boys. The boyish\r\n  appearance of my wife was of effectual assistance. I called her my\r\n  ‘Raphael.’ I forced into my fancy images of boys, in order to induce\r\n  erection. If my fancy ceased for a moment, the erection failed. I was\r\n  unable to sleep with my wife. Within the last few years coitus has\r\n  become constantly more difficult to attain, and for two years we have\r\n  given up all attempts. My wife knows my mental condition, and her\r\n  esteem and love for me may become estranged.\r\n\r\n  “My sexual inclination for my own sex is unchanged, and,\r\n  unfortunately, too often forces me to become untrue to my wife. To\r\n  this day, the sight of a youth of sixteen puts me into violent sexual\r\n  excitement with painful erections, so that occasionally I am compelled\r\n  to help myself with manustupration of him and onanism on myself.\r\n\r\n  “The sufferings I endure are indescribable. _Faute de mieux_, I have\r\n  my wife practice manustupration on me; but what my wife’s hand\r\n  accomplishes with great effort in half an hour is produced by the hand\r\n  of a boy in a few seconds. Thus I live, miserable, a slave of the law\r\n  and of my duty to my wife! I never had pleasure in active or passive\r\n  pederasty. If I ever practiced or suffered it, it was only from\r\n  gratitude or desire to please.”\r\n\r\nThe physician to whom I owe the preceding autobiography assures me that\r\nhe, up to this time, has had sexual intercourse with at least six\r\nhundred urnings. There were, indeed, many among them who to-day occupy\r\nhigh and respected positions. Only about ten per cent. of them came\r\nlater to love women. Another portion did not avoid women, but were more\r\ninclined to their own sex; the remainder were exclusively and lastingly\r\nurnings.\r\n\r\nThis physician asserted that among the six hundred he never found\r\nabnormal formation of the genitals; but there were, however, frequent\r\napproaches to the female form, as well as incomplete growth of hair,\r\ndelicate complexion, and higher voice. Development of the mammæ was not\r\ninfrequent. He asserted that from his thirteenth to his fifteenth year\r\nhe had milk in his mammæ, which his friend H. sucked out. Only about ten\r\nper cent. of this number showed inclination for female occupations, etc.\r\nAll his acquaintances were affected with a sexual desire that was\r\nabnormally powerful, and made its appearance abnormally early. The vast\r\nmajority felt themselves as the man in their relations with the other,\r\nand satisfied themselves by mutual onanism, or by manustupration on the\r\nperson of the lover, or by masturbation at his hands. The majority were\r\ninclined to active pederasty; but very frequently the law and æsthetic\r\nfeeling were reasons for the non-performance of the act. Those feeling\r\nthemselves toward the others as women were few, and the inclination to\r\npassive pederasty was very infrequent.\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of 1887, this physician was arrested for having\r\n  commuted acts of indecency on the persons of two boys under fourteen\r\n  years. The crime consisted in his having first rubbed mentulam\r\n  propriam inter femora viri until ejaculatio, and the same procedure\r\n  cum mentula propria inter femora pueri. At the examination it was\r\n  recognized that an abnormal instinct was in play, though, at the same\r\n  time, it was shown that the culprit was not mentally unsound, and not\r\n  deprived of free will; at least, he had not acted in obedience to an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse. Therefore, he was sentenced to prison for one\r\n  year, the mildest possible punishment.\r\n\r\n  Case 113. Mr. X., Hungarian, merchant, consulted me on account of\r\n  neurasthenia and sleeplessness, which had existed for years. The\r\n  investigation of the cause of his trouble led the patient to confess\r\n  that he had an abnormal sexual instinct for his own sex, that he was\r\n  very passionate, and that his nervous trouble might well come from\r\n  that. The following, taken from the history of this intelligent\r\n  patient, possesses scientific interest:—\r\n\r\n  “My abnormal sexual instinct reaches back to my childhood. When three\r\n  years old, I got hold of a journal of fashions. The beautiful pictures\r\n  of the men I kissed until the paper was torn to tatters, but I paid no\r\n  attention to the female figures. I did not like to play with boys. I\r\n  preferred to play with girls, because they always had dolls. I\r\n  especially liked to cut out dolls’ clothes; and to-day, in spite of my\r\n  thirty-three years, dolls still possess an interest for me. When a\r\n  boy, for hours I would lurk about available places, in order to get a\r\n  sight of male genitals. When I succeeded, a strange, dizzy feeling\r\n  came over me. Weak, unattractive men or boys made no impression on me.\r\n  At thirteen I began to masturbate. From my thirteenth till my\r\n  fifteenth year, I slept with a handsome young man. That was happiness.\r\n  Hours at a time at night, with erections, I would wait for his return.\r\n  If in bed he chanced to touch my genitals, it gave me delight. At\r\n  fourteen I had a school-mate whose instincts were like my own. For\r\n  hours at a time, during school-hours, we held each other’s genitals.\r\n  Ah, those were happy hours! As often as I could, I lingered in\r\n  bath-houses. That was always a feast for me. The sight of male\r\n  genitals induced violent erections. At sixteen I came to the\r\n  metropolis. Seeing so many handsome men charmed me. In my eighteenth\r\n  year I attempted coitus with a prostitute, but disgust and fear made\r\n  it impossible. Other attempts were failures, until my nineteenth year,\r\n  when I tried again with success; but the act afforded me no pleasure,\r\n  rather inducing a feeling of disgust. I conquered myself, and was\r\n  proud of my success at being a man, which I had gradually begun to\r\n  doubt.\r\n\r\n  “Subsequent attempts were no longer successful. The disgust was too\r\n  great. When the woman was undressing, it became necessary, on account\r\n  of my feeling of repugnance, to put out the light. I now considered\r\n  myself impotent, consulted physicians, and visited baths and\r\n  sanitariums to cure my supposed impotence; for I still did not know\r\n  what to think of it. I took pleasure in the society of ladies, perhaps\r\n  out of conceit; for I impressed most ladies as being sympathetic and\r\n  amiable; but I valued in them nothing more than mental and æsthetic\r\n  qualities. I liked to dance with them; but if one pressed against me\r\n  in dancing, I experienced a feeling of repugnance, and even disgust,\r\n  and felt like striking her. If in joke I happened to dance with a\r\n  gentleman, I always took the part of the lady. I would press and rub\r\n  against him, and take a perfect delight in it. When I was eighteen, a\r\n  gentleman who came into the office, said, ‘That is a fine youth; in\r\n  the East he would bring a pound sterling every time!’ I puzzled my\r\n  head over that. Another gentleman liked to joke with me, and steal\r\n  kisses of me as he was going away, which I would have given him only\r\n  too gladly. He afterward became my lover. These circumstances excited\r\n  my attention, and I waited for an opportunity.\r\n\r\n  “When I was twenty-five years old, it happened that a man who was\r\n  formerly a Capucine monk became attracted to me. For me he was like a\r\n  Mephistopheles. Finally he spoke to me. To this day I can almost feel\r\n  the beating of my heart that he caused me; I almost fainted. He made a\r\n  rendezvous for that evening at a public house. I went, but at the\r\n  threshold I turned back, afraid. On the next evening he met me again.\r\n  He overcame my scruples, and took me to his room. I was scarcely able\r\n  to walk for excitement. My seducer made me sit on his sofa, and,\r\n  smiling at me, he fixed his wonderful black eyes on me, and I lost\r\n  consciousness. This delight, this ideal, divine sense of pleasure that\r\n  filled my whole being,—I could write too much about it. I think only\r\n  an innocent youth, over head and ears in love, who for the first time\r\n  has his love’s longing fulfilled, could be as happy as I was that\r\n  night. My seducer demanded my life, in joke; but I at first thought\r\n  him in earnest. I begged him to let me be happy for a time, and then,\r\n  united to him, I would end my life. It would have been entirely in\r\n  accordance with the high-flown ideas I entertained at that time. For\r\n  five years after that, I kept up a relation with the man, who is still\r\n  so dear to me. Oh, how happy, and yet, often, how unhappy, I was\r\n  during those years! If I but saw him speak to a handsome young man, I\r\n  became wildly jealous.\r\n\r\n  “When twenty-seven, I became engaged to a young lady. Her mind and\r\n  æsthetic feeling, as well as financial considerations, induced me to\r\n  think of marriage. At the same time, I am very fond of children, and,\r\n  whenever I meet even the commonest day-laborer and his wife and a\r\n  pretty child, I envy the man his good fortune. Thus I made a fool of\r\n  myself. I managed to get through the time of courtship; when kissing\r\n  my bride I felt more anxiety and fear than pleasure. On one or two\r\n  occasions, however, after luxurious dinners, while kissing her\r\n  passionately, I had erections. How happy I was at that! I saw myself\r\n  already a father. I twice came near breaking off the engagement. On my\r\n  marriage-day, when all the guests had assembled, I locked myself in a\r\n  room, cried like a child, and felt that I could not proceed with the\r\n  ceremony. At the persuasion of all the relatives, to whom I made the\r\n  best excuses that occurred to me, I allowed myself to be taken, in\r\n  ordinary street-costume, to the altar.\r\n\r\n  “As great good fortune would have it, at the time of the marriage, my\r\n  wife was menstruating. Oh, how thankful I was for this excuse! I am\r\n  now convinced that this circumstance is all that made later\r\n  cohabitation possible. How it later became possible for me to cohabit\r\n  with my wife, and have a lovely boy, I do not know. He is the comfort\r\n  of my ruined life. I can only thank God for the happiness of having a\r\n  child. I was a cheat, so to speak, in the marriage-bed. My wife, whom\r\n  I respect for her high qualities of character, has no suspicion of my\r\n  condition, but she often complains of my coldness. With her goodness\r\n  of heart and simplicity, it was possible for me to make her think that\r\n  the conjugal duty should be performed but once a month. Since she is\r\n  in nowise sensual, and I can find excuse in my nervousness, I am\r\n  successful in keeping up the swindle. Cohabitation is the greatest\r\n  sacrifice for me. By taking considerable wine, and by making use of\r\n  the erections which occur in the morning, as the result of an\r\n  overfilled bladder, it is possible for me to perform coitus once a\r\n  month; but it affords me no pleasurable feeling, and I am worried and\r\n  experience an increase of my nervous difficulties all day long after\r\n  it. The consciousness of having fulfilled my duty toward my wife, whom\r\n  in all other respects I love, affords me moral consolation and\r\n  satisfaction. With a man, it is otherwise. With him I can perform the\r\n  act several times in a night, always taking the sexual _rôle_ of a\r\n  man. In this, I experience the greatest pleasure, the purest\r\n  happiness. I feel myself refreshed and invigorated by it. Of late, my\r\n  desire for men has somewhat decreased; in fact, I have courage even to\r\n  avoid a handsome young man that approaches me. Will it last? I fear\r\n  not. I am absolutely unable to do without male love; if I am compelled\r\n  to forego it, I become depressed, feel weary and miserable, and have\r\n  pain and pressure in my head. I have always regarded my pitiable\r\n  peculiarity as something congenital, and I would feel happy if I had\r\n  only not married. I pity my good wife. Often the fear seizes me that I\r\n  cannot endure it with her longer; then thoughts about divorce,\r\n  suicide, and flight to America come to me.”\r\n\r\n  No one seeing the patient to whom I owe this communication would\r\n  suspect his condition. His outward appearance is, in all respects,\r\n  masculine; he has a well-developed, full beard, strong and deep voice,\r\n  and normal genitals. The cranium is normally formed; signs of\r\n  degeneration are absolutely wanting, and only an exquisitely nervous\r\n  eye makes one suspect a neuropathic condition. The vegetative organs\r\n  perform their functions normally. The patient presents the usual\r\n  symptoms of a neurasthenia, which may, in all essentials, be ascribed\r\n  to sexual excesses with persons of his own sex, in a man abnormally\r\n  passionate; and to the injurious influences of forced, though\r\n  infrequent, coitus with the wife where horror feminæ exists.\r\n\r\n  The patient declares that he comes from healthy parents, and that he\r\n  knows of no neuroses or mental disease in his ancestry. His elder\r\n  brother was married three years. There was a separation, because the\r\n  husband never had sexual intercourse with his wife. He married a\r\n  second time. The second wife also complained of neglect on the part of\r\n  the husband; but she had four children, concerning whose legitimacy no\r\n  doubt was ever raised. A sister is hysteropathic.\r\n\r\n  The patient says that, when a young man, he suffered with momentary\r\n  attacks of dizziness, during which it seemed to him as if he were\r\n  about to die. He says that he has always been very excitable and\r\n  emotional, and an enthusiast for the arts, especially poetry and\r\n  music. He himself designates his character as enigmatical, abnormal,\r\n  nervous, restless, extravagant, and undecided. He is often exalted\r\n  without real reason, and then again depressed, even to thoughts of\r\n  suicide. He may pass through quick and sudden changes,—“religious and\r\n  frivolous, optimistic and cynical, cowardly and brave, credulous,\r\n  amiable, and suspicious; inclined to do others harm, and sorrowful to\r\n  tears over the misfortunes of others; and with this, generous to\r\n  excess, and then again miserly _à la Harpagon_.” The patient is\r\n  certainly a tainted individual. He seems to be very well endowed\r\n  intellectually, and, as he says, to have learned easily, and been\r\n  among the first at school.\r\n\r\n  The marriage of this man was not happy. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\n  it was but very infrequently that he performed the inadequate and\r\n  injurious sexual act with his wife, and that he sought and found a\r\n  substitute in male lovers, he remained neurasthenic. His disease, at\r\n  times, presents marked exacerbations, even manifesting itself in\r\n  despairing depression about his matrimonial, sexual, and mental\r\n  condition, which even extends to violent tædium vitæ.\r\n\r\n  His wife became hysteropathic and anæmic, and the patient attributed\r\n  this to sexual abstinence. Try as he would to force himself, of late\r\n  years he has not been able to perform coitus, erection failing\r\n  completely; while, in intercourse with male lovers, he is very potent.\r\n\r\n  The son of these unfortunate parents, who is now over nine years old,\r\n  develops well. The patient adds that formerly, in coitus with his\r\n  wife, he was potent only when he thought of a beloved man. (From the\r\n  author’s “Lehrb. der Psychiatrie.”)\r\n\r\n  Case 114. _Autobiography._ “The writer of this is a congenital urning.\r\n  If I have not consorted with other urnings, nevertheless, I am fully\r\n  informed of my condition; for it has been my lot to see almost all\r\n  literature on the subject. A short time ago, your work, ‘Psychopathia\r\n  Sexualis,’ was sent to me. I saw in it that you were working and\r\n  studying without prejudice in the interest of science and humanity.\r\n\r\n  “If I cannot tell you much that is new, yet I will speak of a few\r\n  things which I trust you will receive as one more stone to be used by\r\n  you in your work; which, I am confident, will, in your hands, aid in\r\n  saving us.\r\n\r\n  “When you presume that there is often an hereditary tainted condition,\r\n  perhaps you are right. My father was subject to spinal disease before\r\n  my birth; later, he became mentally unsound, and took his own life.\r\n\r\n  “Another point, which I am inclined to doubt, is the one mentioned by\r\n  you in another place,—_i.e._, that onanism practiced from youth may\r\n  lead to perverse instinct.\r\n\r\n  “I (merchant, owner of a small business, unmarried) am in the\r\n  beginning of my thirtieth year. I am apparently healthy, and show\r\n  scarcely a deviation from the normal masculine type. The first sexual\r\n  impulses were immediately and exclusively directed to the male sex,\r\n  and I experienced them from my tenth year. I have masturbated since my\r\n  twelfth year. Since, in spite of all attempts, coitus with women was\r\n  always absolutely impossible for me; and since I have never had desire\r\n  for women—on the contrary, rather aversion; and since my attempts have\r\n  never resulted in the slightest erection, I have been compelled to\r\n  satisfy myself by onanism.\r\n\r\n  “If now I am to confess the manner of my sexual satisfaction, I may\r\n  say that in my earlier years my fellow-pupils and companions excited\r\n  me sexually. Now my impulse consists in a desire for boys of about\r\n  ten, but mostly for youths of from fifteen to twenty years.\r\n\r\n  “For a long time, strong and healthy cadets, of fine form, have had a\r\n  particular charm for me; and by their handsome uniforms and fine\r\n  presence they especially excite my desire. I have no opportunity to\r\n  approach them, or even to enter into distant social intercourse with\r\n  them; but I am compelled to satisfy myself with following them in the\r\n  streets and squares; or in restaurants, horse-cars or railways, by\r\n  sitting near them, and, when it is possible to do it unnoticed, under\r\n  such circumstances, by practicing onanism. My most ardent wish has\r\n  often been to become the friend, servant, or slave of such a young\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  “I have never even dreamed of direct pederasty; my desire has always\r\n  been bodily contact, embrace, manustupration of my genitals by my\r\n  lover, and, on my part, a kiss on his genitals or podex.\r\n\r\n  “I often have the desire, however, to represent Sacher-Masoch in his\r\n  ‘Venus in Furs.’ There a man makes himself the voluntary slave of a\r\n  woman, and feels an intense thrill of lustful pleasure, if he is only\r\n  chastised and humiliated by her. But I naturally feel that I could,\r\n  under no circumstances, become the slave of a woman, but only of a\r\n  man; more correctly, of a young man; one, however, for whom I should\r\n  have such an infinite love that I could give myself up entirely to his\r\n  mercy or cruelty.\r\n\r\n  “The lustful images that float before my mind in masturbation are\r\n  those of this or that young man that I have just seen. As a sad and\r\n  incomplete substitute, I practice this onanism constantly.\r\n\r\n  “I pass into a lustful dream in this way (and I say all here, because\r\n  I wish to write only the truth and the whole truth): I choose a young\r\n  man that pleases me by his form, and in imagination give myself up to\r\n  involuntary obedience to him. I imagine that he wishes to humiliate\r\n  me, and that he commands me, for example, to kiss his feet; or compels\r\n  me to smell his socks. For want of the desired actuality, I take my\r\n  own socks, smell of them, take them into my mouth, rub them over my\r\n  genitals, and immediately erection and ejaculation, with sensual\r\n  pleasure, take place.\r\n\r\n  “Yes, I am so dominated by this mental imagery that I imagine that the\r\n  young man is my confessor, and, in order to humiliate me, orders me to\r\n  eat of his excrement. Here again, in want of actuality, I eat of my\r\n  own excrement, but only in small quantity. Then, with an imperfect\r\n  feeling of disgust and violent palpitation of the heart, erection and\r\n  ejaculation take place.\r\n\r\n  “However, I come to this vile, feverish imagery and the performance of\r\n  these acts, only when it has not been possible for me for a long time\r\n  to satisfy myself by onanism in the immediate vicinity of a young man.\r\n\r\n  “This is for me more natural, because I then have more pleasure, and\r\n  experience a more perfect physical and mental benefit, even though my\r\n  ideal of actual and direct satisfaction in mutual understanding were\r\n  never to be accorded me.\r\n\r\n  “I almost believe that the above-mentioned disgusting imagery is only\r\n  the evil result of constant want of normal satisfaction,—_i.e._, of my\r\n  normal satisfaction as an urning; and that with a regular\r\n  satisfaction, body to body, the imagery that becomes almost insane\r\n  would be less intense, and certainly would not go to such\r\n  extravagance. Or it is the ultimate result of an attempt at\r\n  abstinence; for these idiotic, sensual images only come after a long\r\n  period of it.\r\n\r\n  “I believe, indeed, that, under other social conditions, I should be\r\n  capable of great and noble love and self-sacrifice. My thoughts are in\r\n  no way exclusively carnal or diseased. How often, at the sight of a\r\n  handsome young man, a deep feeling of impatience seizes me, and I\r\n  breathe at once the sweet words of Heine:—\r\n\r\n     “‘Du bist wie eine Blume, so hold, so schön, so rein,’ etc.[115]\r\n\r\n  “And once, when I was compelled to part with a young man who had\r\n  honored and valued me as his friend and protector, though my love had\r\n  remained unknown to him, those fine verses by Scheffel kept passing\r\n  through my mind, especially the last,—_mutatis mutandis_:—\r\n\r\n             “‘Grau wie der Himmel, steht vor mir die Welt,\r\n             Doch wend’ es sich zum Guten oder Bösen,\r\n             Du, lieber Freund, in Treuen denk’ ich Dein!\r\n             Behüt Dich Gott! es wär’ zu schön gewesen,\r\n             Behüt Dich Gott, es hat nicht sollen sein!’[116]\r\n\r\n  “I have never independently revealed my love to a young man, and have\r\n  never spoiled or injured one morally; but I have, now and then, made\r\n  the way easy for many. Under such circumstances, nothing is too much\r\n  trouble, and I obtain victims as only I can.\r\n\r\n  “When I have an opportunity to have such a beloved friend about me, to\r\n  educate, protect, and help, if my recognized love find a (natural,\r\n  unsexual) return, then all my disgusting mental imagery grows less and\r\n  less intense; then my love becomes almost platonic and ennobled, to\r\n  sink again into the mire when this worthy satisfaction is removed.\r\n\r\n  “As for the rest, and without over-estimating myself, I may say that I\r\n  am not one of the worst of men. Brighter mentally than the average\r\n  man, I take interest in all that moves humanity. I am amiable, and\r\n  easily moved to pity, and am incapable of doing any animal, much less\r\n  a man, an injury; but, on the contrary, do good wherever I can.\r\n\r\n  “When I have nothing to reproach myself with in my own conscience, and\r\n  must, at the same time, set myself in opposition to the judgment of\r\n  the world, I suffer very much. Indeed, I have done no one harm, and I\r\n  consider my love, in its noblest activity, to be quite as holy as that\r\n  of a normal man; but, with the unhappy lot which impatience and\r\n  ignorance cast upon us, I suffer even to the extent of tædium vitæ.\r\n\r\n  “No pen, no tongue can describe all the misery, all the unhappy\r\n  situations, the constant fear of having this peculiarity recognized,\r\n  and of being cast from society. The one thought that, as soon as\r\n  recognized, one’s existence would be lost, and he would be cast away\r\n  from all, is as terrible as any thought can be. Then all the good that\r\n  one had ever done would be forgotten; then, in the pride of his great\r\n  morality, every normal man would be moved to scorn, even though he\r\n  himself had been never so frivolous in his own love.\r\n\r\n  “Then what does our misery amount to? We may, cursing man, end our\r\n  unhappy lives. Truly, I often long for the quiet of an asylum. My life\r\n  may end when it will, the quicker the better; I am ready.\r\n\r\n  “To refer to one more point: I also believe, like the others that have\r\n  written to you, that our nervousness is first acquired as a result of\r\n  our unhappy, unspeakably miserable life among our fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n  “And still another: You write, at the conclusion of your work,\r\n  concerning the repeal of the legal enactments concerned. Indeed,\r\n  humanity would not be destroyed if they were repealed. In Italy there\r\n  is no such law, as far as I know; and Italy is not a wilderness, but a\r\n  cultivated nation.\r\n\r\n  “As for myself, compelled as I am to undermine my life by onanism, the\r\n  law could not touch me; for I have never sinned against it in a\r\n  letter. But, at the same time, I suffer under the accursed scorn to\r\n  which we are subjected. How can the ideas of society be changed, so\r\n  long as there is a law which strengthens it in its immorality? The law\r\n  must, of course, correspond with public opinion; but it should not be\r\n  in harmony with the erroneous opinion of ignorance, but only in accord\r\n  with the ideas of the best and most scientific thinkers,—not with the\r\n  wish and prejudice of the vulgar. True thinking minds cannot much\r\n  longer be satisfied with the old idea.\r\n\r\n  “Pardon me, Professor, if I close without a signature. Do not try to\r\n  find me. I could tell you nothing more. I give you these lines in the\r\n  interest of future sufferers. Publish from them, in the interest of\r\n  science, truth, and justice, what seems to you to be necessary.”\r\n\r\n  Case 115. On a summer evening, at twilight, X. Y., a physician of a\r\n  city in North Germany, was detected by a watchman while committing a\r\n  misdemeanor with a countryman in a field. He was practicing\r\n  masturbation on him, and then mentulam alius in os suum immisit. X.\r\n  escaped legal prosecution by flight. The authorities dismissed the\r\n  complaint, because there had been no publicity, and because immissio\r\n  membri in anum had not taken place. Among X.’s effects was found an\r\n  extensive correspondence of a perverse sexual character, which showed\r\n  that he had had perverse intercourse for years with all classes of\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  X. came of a neurotic family. His paternal grandfather died by suicide\r\n  while insane. His father was a weak, peculiar man. One brother\r\n  masturbated at the age of two. A cousin was sexually perverse, and\r\n  practiced perverse acts, similar to those of X., while a youth; he\r\n  became weak-minded, and died of spinal disease. A paternal great-uncle\r\n  was an hermaphrodite. His mother’s sister was insane. His mother is\r\n  said to have been healthy. X.’s brother is nervous and irascible.\r\n\r\n  X., likewise, was nervous as a child. The mewing of a cat would create\r\n  great fear in him; and if one but imitated the voice of a cat, he\r\n  would cry bitterly, and run to others for protection. Slight physical\r\n  disturbance caused violent fever. He was a quiet, dreamy child, of\r\n  excitable imagination, but of slight mental capabilities. He did not\r\n  indulge much in boyish games; he preferred feminine pursuits. It gave\r\n  him especial pleasure to curl the hair of the house-maid or of his\r\n  brother.\r\n\r\n  At thirteen X. went to an Institute. There he practiced mutual\r\n  masturbation, seduced his comrades, and, by his cynical conduct, made\r\n  them unmanageable; so that he had to be taken home. At that time the\r\n  parents found love-letters with lascivious contents, showing perverse\r\n  sexuality. From the age of seventeen he studied under the strict\r\n  surveillance of a professor in a Gymnasium. He made but sad progress\r\n  in learning. He had only a talent for music.\r\n\r\n  After finishing his studies, the patient entered the University, at\r\n  the age of nineteen. There he attracted attention by his cynical\r\n  character and his association with young persons who were thought to\r\n  be given to masculine love. He began to be dandified; wore striking\r\n  cravats, and shirts that were low cut; he forced his feet into narrow\r\n  shoes, and curled his hair in a remarkable way. This peculiarity\r\n  disappeared when he left the school, and had returned home.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twenty-four he was for a long time neurasthenic. From\r\n  that time until his twenty-ninth year, he was earnest and skillful in\r\n  his profession; but he avoided the society of the opposite sex, and\r\n  constantly associated with men of doubtful character.\r\n\r\n  The patient would not allow a personal examination. In writing, he\r\n  made the excuse for this that it would be of no use, because his\r\n  impulse to his own sex had existed from his earliest childhood, and\r\n  was congenital. He had always had horror feminæ, and had never been\r\n  inclined to avail himself of the charms of women. Toward men he felt\r\n  himself in the _rôle_ of a man. He recognized his impulse toward his\r\n  own sex as abnormal, and excused his sexual indulgence as being the\r\n  result of an abnormal natural condition.\r\n\r\n  Since his flight X. lives out of Germany, in Southern Italy, and, as I\r\n  learned from a letter, now, as before, he indulges in perverse love.\r\n  X. is an earnest, stately man, of masculine features, well-grown\r\n  beard, and normally developed genitals. Dr. X. furnished me, a short\r\n  time ago, with his autobiography, of which the following is worthy of\r\n  mention:—\r\n\r\n  “When, at the age of seven, I entered the private school, I felt very\r\n  uncomfortable, and found very little sympathy with my companions. Only\r\n  toward one of them, who was a very handsome child, did I feel\r\n  attracted, and I loved him wildly. In childish games I always knew how\r\n  to arrange it so that I could appear in feminine attire; and my\r\n  greatest pleasure was to form intricate coiffures for our\r\n  servant-girls. I often regretted that I was not a girl.\r\n\r\n  “My sexual instinct awakened when I was thirteen, and from the moment\r\n  of its appearance was directed toward youthful, strong men. At first I\r\n  was not really certain that this was abnormal, but consciousness of it\r\n  came when I saw and heard how my companions were characterized\r\n  sexually. I began to masturbate at the age of thirteen. At seventeen I\r\n  left home and went to the Gymnasium of a large Capital, where I was\r\n  put to board with a married professor of the Gymnasium, with whose son\r\n  I afterward had sexual relations. It was with him that I first had\r\n  sexual satisfaction. Thereafter I made the acquaintance of a young\r\n  artist, who very soon noticed that I was abnormal, and confessed to me\r\n  that he was in the same condition. I learned from him that this\r\n  abnormality was very frequent; and this knowledge overcame the trouble\r\n  that I had had in supposing that I was alone in my abnormality. This\r\n  young man had an extensive acquaintance with persons in like\r\n  condition, to which he introduced me. There I became the object of\r\n  general attention, for on all sides I was declared to be very\r\n  attractive physically. I soon became insanely loved by an old\r\n  gentleman; but, not finding him to my taste, I endured him but a short\r\n  time, and then gave ear to a young and handsome officer who lay at my\r\n  feet. He was really my first love.\r\n\r\n  “After passing my final examination, at the age of nineteen, free from\r\n  the discipline of school, I made the acquaintance of a great number of\r\n  people like myself, and among them Karl Ulrichs (Numa Numantinus).\r\n\r\n  “When, later, I took up the study of medicine, and associated with\r\n  many normal youths, I was often in a position where I was compelled to\r\n  visit public prostitutes. After having consorted to no purpose with\r\n  various prostitutes, some of whom were very beautiful, the opinion was\r\n  spread among my acquaintances that I was impotent, and I strengthened\r\n  this by telling of previous sexual excesses. At that time I had\r\n  numerous external relations with persons who prized my physical\r\n  peculiarities, which were considered very beautiful. The result of\r\n  this was, that I was exciting somebody all the time; and I received\r\n  such a mass of love-letters that I was often in embarrassment. The\r\n  acme of this was reached later, when, as a physician, I lived in the\r\n  hospital. There I moved about like a celebrated person, and the scenes\r\n  of jealousy that took place, on my account, almost led to the\r\n  discovery of the whole thing. Shortly after this, I fell ill with an\r\n  inflammation of my shoulder-joint, from which I recovered after three\r\n  months. During this illness I received subcutaneous injections of\r\n  morphine several times daily, which were suddenly discontinued, and\r\n  which I practiced thereafter secretly after my recovery. For the\r\n  purpose of special study, I spent some months in Vienna, before\r\n  entering into private practice, and there, by means of some\r\n  recommendations, I gained entrance to various circles of people like\r\n  myself. I there learned that the abnormality in question, in its\r\n  various forms, is spread through the lower classes as well as the\r\n  higher, and that those who are approachable for money are not\r\n  infrequently met among the higher classes.\r\n\r\n  “When I established myself in the country, I hoped to cure myself of\r\n  the morphine habit by means of cocaine; and then I became a victim of\r\n  cocaine, which, only after three relapses, I was able to rid myself of\r\n  (about two years ago). In my position, it was impossible for me to\r\n  find sexual satisfaction, and I noticed with pleasure that the use of\r\n  cocaine had overcome my desire. When, on the first occasion, at the\r\n  urgent request of my aunt, I had emancipated myself from cocaine, I\r\n  traveled for a few weeks, in order to improve my health, the perverse\r\n  impulses were again awakened in their old strength, and, one evening,\r\n  while out in the fields by the city amusing myself with a man, I\r\n  noticed that I had been detected by the authorities and advertised;\r\n  but that the act of which I was accused was not punishable, in\r\n  accordance with the opinion expressed by the highest court of the\r\n  German kingdom. I had, therefore, to be careful; for already the\r\n  announcement of the crime had been heralded on all sides. I saw that,\r\n  after this, I would be compelled to leave Germany, and find a new home\r\n  where neither the law nor public opinion would be opposed to that\r\n  impulse, which, like all abnormal instincts, could not be overcome by\r\n  the will. Since I was never deceived for a moment about the matter, in\r\n  recognizing my impulses as opposed to social usages, I repeatedly\r\n  attempted to become master of them; but by these efforts they were\r\n  increased in power. This same observation has been communicated to me\r\n  by acquaintances. Since I was exclusively drawn toward strong,\r\n  youthful, and masculine individuals, and they were very seldom\r\n  inclined to yield to my wishes, I was compelled to buy them. Since my\r\n  desire was limited to persons of the lower classes, I was always able\r\n  to find such as were purchasable with money. I hope that the following\r\n  statements will not awaken your repugnance. At first I intended to\r\n  omit them; but, for the completeness of this communication, I may\r\n  include them, since they serve to enrich the clinical material. I am\r\n  compelled to perform the sexual act in the following way:—\r\n\r\n  “Pene juvenis in os recepto, ita ut commovendo ore meo effecerim, ut\r\n  is quem cupio, semen ejaculaverit, sperma in perinæum exspuo, femora\r\n  comprimi jubeo et penem meum ad versus et intra femora compressa\r\n  immitto. Dum hæc fiunt, necesse est, ut juvenis me, quantum potest,\r\n  amplectatur. Quæ prius me fecisse narravi, eandem mihi afferunt\r\n  voluptatem, acsi ipse ejaculo. Ejaculationem pene in anum immittendo\r\n  vel manu terendo assequi, mihi nequaquam amœnum est.\r\n\r\n  “Sed inveni, qui penem meum receperint atque ea facientes, quæ supra\r\n  exposui, effecerint, ut libidines meæ plane sint saturatæ.\r\n\r\n  “Concerning my person, I must still mention the following: I am 186\r\n  centimetres tall, of masculine appearance, and, with the exception of\r\n  abnormal irritability of the skin, healthy. My hair and beard are\r\n  black and thick. My genitals are of medium size and normally formed. I\r\n  am able, without any trace of fatigue, to perform the sexual act from\r\n  four to six times in twenty-four hours. My life is very regular. I use\r\n  alcohol and tobacco very sparingly. I play the piano quite well, and\r\n  some of my unpretentious compositions have been much applauded. I have\r\n  lately finished a novel, which, as my first work, has been very\r\n  favorably criticised by my friends. The story has several problems\r\n  taken from the life of urnings in the subject-matter.\r\n\r\n  “Among the large number of fellow-sufferers that are personally known\r\n  to me, I have naturally been in a position to make observations\r\n  concerning the condition and the degrees of abnormality; and, perhaps,\r\n  the following communications may be of service to you:—\r\n\r\n  “The most abnormal thing that I am acquainted with, was the impulse of\r\n  a gentleman who lived in Berlin. He preferred, above all others, young\r\n  fellows with unwashed feet, which he would lick passionately. A\r\n  gentleman in Leipzig was similar to him; who, where it was possible,\r\n  would linguam in anum immittere, preferring the parts to be uncleaned.\r\n  Several have assured me that the sight of riding-boots or of parts of\r\n  military uniforms, induced such excitement in them that ejaculation\r\n  resulted. A man in Paris compelled a friend ut in os ei mingat.\r\n\r\n  “With reference to the degree in which many feel themselves as women,\r\n  which is with me not the case, two persons in Vienna are examples.\r\n  They bore feminine names. One is a barber who calls himself ‘French\r\n  Laura’; the other was formerly a butcher, who calls himself\r\n  ‘Selcher-Fanny.’ Both of them never missed an opportunity, during the\r\n  carnival time, to show themselves in very fantastic feminine masks. In\r\n  Hamburg there is a person that many people believe to be a woman,\r\n  because he always goes about the house in feminine attire, and only\r\n  occasionally leaves the house, and always in such clothing. This man\r\n  wished to stand as godmother at a christening, and, as a result of it,\r\n  gave rise to great scandal.\r\n\r\n  “Feminine timidity, frivolity, obstinacy, and weakness of character,\r\n  are the rule in such individuals.\r\n\r\n  “Several cases of perverse sexuality are known to me where epilepsy\r\n  and psychoses are present. Hernias are remarkably frequent. In\r\n  practice many persons come to me to be treated for diseases of the\r\n  anus, because of recommendation by friends. I saw two syphilitic and\r\n  one local chancre, and several fissures; and at present I am treating\r\n  a gentleman for condylomata of the anus, which form a rounded tumor as\r\n  large as a fist. One case of primary affection of the soft palate I\r\n  saw in Vienna, in a young man who was accustomed to frequent\r\n  mask-balls dressed as a girl, and entice young men; he would then\r\n  pretend that he was menstruating, and thus induce the others to use\r\n  him per os. The assertion was made that in this way he had deceived\r\n  fourteen men in one evening. Since, in none of the publications\r\n  concerning contrary sexuality that I have seen, I have found anything\r\n  concerning the intercourse of pederasts among themselves, I venture to\r\n  communicate something concerning it in conclusion:—\r\n\r\n  “As soon as individuals that are affected with contrary sexuality\r\n  become acquainted, there is a detailed narration of their experiences,\r\n  loves, and seductions, as far as the social difference between them\r\n  allows such entertainment. Only in very few cases is this amusement\r\n  uncommon with new acquaintances. Among themselves, they call\r\n  themselves ‘aunts’; in Vienna, ‘sisters’; and two very masculine\r\n  public prostitutes in Vienna, whom I accidentally became acquainted\r\n  with, and who lived in a perverse sexual relation with each other,\r\n  told me that for the corresponding condition in women the name ‘uncle’\r\n  was used. Since becoming conscious of my abnormal instinct, I have met\r\n  thousands of such individuals.\r\n\r\n  “Almost every large city has some meeting-place, as well as a\r\n  so-called promenade. In smaller cities there are relatively few\r\n  ‘aunts,’ though in a small town of 2300 inhabitants I found eight, and\r\n  in one of 7000 eighteen of whom I was absolutely sure,—to say nothing\r\n  of those whom I suspected. In my own town of 30,000 inhabitants, I\r\n  personally know about one hundred and twenty ‘aunts.’ The greater\r\n  number of them, and I especially, possess the capability of judging\r\n  another immediately as to whether they are alike or not, which, in the\r\n  language of the ‘aunts,’ is called ‘reasonable’ or ‘unreasonable.’ My\r\n  acquaintances are often astounded at the certainty of my judgment.\r\n  Individuals that are apparently absolutely masculine I recognize as\r\n  ‘aunts’ at the first sight. On the other hand, I am able to behave\r\n  myself in such a masculine way that, in circles to which I have been\r\n  introduced by acquaintances, there is a doubt as to my genuineness.\r\n  When I am in the mood, I can act exactly like a girl.\r\n\r\n  “Since the majority of ‘aunts,’ like myself, in no way regret their\r\n  abnormality, but would be sorry if the condition were to be changed;\r\n  and, moreover, since the congenital condition, according to my own and\r\n  all other experience, cannot be influenced; therefore, all our hope\r\n  rests upon the possibility of a change of the laws with reference to\r\n  it, so that only rape or the commission of public offense, when this\r\n  can be proved at the same time, shall be punishable.”\r\n\r\n  Case 116. _Contrary Sexual Instinct in a Woman._—S. J., aged 38,\r\n  governess, came to me for advice about a nervous trouble. Her father\r\n  was temporarily insane, and died of a brain disease. The patient is an\r\n  only child, and even when quite young she suffered with feelings of\r\n  anxiety and painful ideas. She thought, for example, that she would\r\n  awake in her coffin after it had been closed; that at confession she\r\n  might forget something, and make a sinful confession. She suffered\r\n  much with headache. She was always very much excited and apprehensive,\r\n  but yet she had to see horrible things, like corpses, etc.\r\n\r\n  Even in her earliest childhood, the patient was excited sexually, and\r\n  began to masturbate without any teaching. The menses began at\r\n  fourteen, and were always accompanied by colicky pains, violent sexual\r\n  excitement, migraine, and depression. After her eighteenth year she\r\n  learned to repress her impulse to masturbate.\r\n\r\n  The patient has never felt any inclination toward persons of the\r\n  opposite sex. If she thought of marriage, it was only because she\r\n  sought in matrimony a means of being supported. On the other hand, she\r\n  felt powerfully attracted by girls. At first she regarded this\r\n  inclination as friendship; but in the depth of her attachment to\r\n  female friends, and in the longing she constantly felt for them, she\r\n  recognized that the feeling was something more than friendship.\r\n\r\n  The patient cannot understand how a girl can love a man, but she can\r\n  easily see how a man might love a girl. She always has a lively\r\n  interest in beautiful women and girls, and is powerfully excited at\r\n  sight of them. Her longing had always been to kiss and embrace such\r\n  dear creatures. She had never dreamed of a man, but only of girls. Her\r\n  delight had been to revel in the sight of them. Separation from such\r\n  female friends had always made her desperate.\r\n\r\n  The patient, whose appearance is perfectly feminine and very\r\n  respectable, states that she has never felt herself in any particular\r\n  _rôle_ with her friends, not even in dreams. Female pelvis; large\r\n  mammæ; no sign of beard.\r\n\r\n  Case 117. Mrs. R., Russian, aged 35, of high social position, was\r\n  brought to me, in 1886, by her husband for advice.\r\n\r\n  Father was a physician, and very neuropathic. Paternal grandfather was\r\n  healthy and normal, and reached the age of ninety-six. Facts\r\n  concerning paternal grandmother are wanting. All the children of\r\n  father’s family are said to have been nervous. The patient’s mother\r\n  was nervous, and suffered with asthma. The mother’s parents were\r\n  healthy. One of the mother’s sisters had melancholia.\r\n\r\n  From her tenth year patient has been subject to habitual headache.\r\n  With the exception of measles, she has had no illness. She was\r\n  capable, and enjoyed the best of training, having especial talent for\r\n  music and languages. It became necessary for her to prepare herself\r\n  for the work of a governess, and during her earlier years she was\r\n  mentally overworked. She passed through an attack of melancholia _sine\r\n  delirio_, of some months’ duration, at seventeen. The patient asserts\r\n  that she has always had sympathy only for her own sex, and found only\r\n  an æsthetic interest in men. She never had any taste for female work.\r\n  As a little girl, she preferred to play with boys.\r\n\r\n  She says she remained well until her twenty-seventh year. Then,\r\n  without external cause, she became depressed and considered herself a\r\n  bad, sinful person, had no pleasure in anything, and was sleepless.\r\n  During this time of illness she was also troubled with imperative\r\n  conceptions: that she must think of the death of herself and her\r\n  relatives. Recovery after about five months. She then became a\r\n  governess, was overworked, but remained well, except for occasional\r\n  neurasthenic symptoms and spinal irritation.\r\n\r\n  At twenty-eight she made the acquaintance of a lady five years younger\r\n  than herself. She fell in love with her, and her love was returned.\r\n  The love was very sensual, and satisfied by mutual masturbation. “I\r\n  loved her as a god; her’s is a noble soul,” she said, when she\r\n  mentioned this love-bond. It lasted four years, and was ended by the\r\n  (unfortunate) marriage of her friend.\r\n\r\n  In 1885, after much emotional strain, the patient became ill with\r\n  symptoms of hystero-neurasthenia (dyspepsia, spinal irritation, and\r\n  tonic spasmodic attacks; attacks of hemiopia with migraine and\r\n  transitory aphasia; pruritus pudendi et ani). In February, 1886, these\r\n  symptoms disappeared.\r\n\r\n  In March she became acquainted with her present husband, and married\r\n  him without taking much time for reflection; for he was rich, much in\r\n  love with her, and his character was in sympathy with her own.\r\n\r\n  On April 6th, she read the sentence, “Death misses no one.” Like a\r\n  flash of lightning in a clear sky, the former imperative conceptions\r\n  of death returned. She was forced to meditate on the most horrible\r\n  manner of death for herself and those about her, and constantly\r\n  imagine death-scenes. She lost rest and sleep, and took no pleasure in\r\n  anything. Her condition improved. Late in May, 1886, she was married,\r\n  but was still troubled by painful thoughts at that time: that she\r\n  would bring misfortune on her husband and those about her.\r\n\r\n  First coitus on June 6, 1886. She was deeply depressed morally by it.\r\n  She had had no such conception of matrimony. The husband, who really\r\n  loved his wife, did all he could to quiet her. He consulted\r\n  physicians, who thought all would be well after pregnancy. The husband\r\n  was unable to explain the peculiar behavior of his wife. She was\r\n  friendly toward him, and suffered his caresses. In coitus, which was\r\n  actually carried out, she was entirely passive, and after the act she\r\n  was tired, exhausted all day long, nervous, and troubled with spinal\r\n  irritation.\r\n\r\n  A bridal tour brought about a meeting with her old friend, who had\r\n  lived in an unhappy marriage for three years. The two ladies trembled\r\n  with joy and excitement as they sank into each other’s arms, and\r\n  became inseparable. The husband saw that this friendly relation was a\r\n  peculiar one, and hastened their departure. He had an opportunity to\r\n  ascertain, through the correspondence of his wife with this friend,\r\n  that the letters interchanged were like those of two lovers.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. R. became pregnant. During pregnancy the remains of depression\r\n  and imperative ideas disappeared. In September, during about the ninth\r\n  week of pregnancy, abortion took place. After that, renewed symptoms\r\n  of hystero-neurasthenia. In addition to this, there were anteflexio et\r\n  latero-positio dextra uteri, anæmia, and atonia ventriculi.\r\n\r\n  At the consultation the patient gave the impression of a very\r\n  neuropathic, tainted person. The neuropathic expression of the eyes\r\n  cannot be described. Appearance entirely feminine. With the exception\r\n  of a very narrow, arched palate, there was no skeletal abnormality.\r\n  With difficulty the patient could be brought to give the details of\r\n  her sexual abnormality. She complained that she had married without\r\n  knowing what marriage between men and women was. She loved her husband\r\n  dearly for his mental qualities, but marital intercourse was a pain to\r\n  her; she did it unwillingly, without ever finding any satisfaction in\r\n  it. Post actum, all day long she was weary and exhausted. Since the\r\n  abortion and the interdiction of sexual intercourse by the physicians,\r\n  she had been better; but she thought of the future with horror. She\r\n  esteemed her husband, and loved him mentally; but she would do\r\n  anything for him, if he would but avoid her sexually in the future.\r\n  She hoped to have sensual feeling for him in time. When he played the\r\n  violin, she seemed to feel the beginning of an inclination for him\r\n  that was something more than friendship; but it was only transitory,\r\n  and she could get no assurance for the future in it. Her greatest\r\n  happiness was in correspondence with her former lover. She felt that\r\n  this was wrong, but she could not give it up; for to do so made her\r\n  miserable.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the anomaly may be long limited to mere perversion\r\nof the sexual instinct, and that the impulse to perverse indulgence may\r\nmake its appearance after some accidental cause,—_e.g._, seduction, or\r\nsome neurosis. Such cases might easily be mistaken for acquired contrary\r\nsexual instinct (_v. supra_), if, with reference to the sexual feeling,\r\nthey should not be demonstrated by the history to be original and\r\ncongenital.\r\n\r\n  Case 118. Mrs. C., aged 32, wife of an official, a large, not uncomely\r\n  woman, feminine in appearance, comes of a neuropathic and emotional\r\n  mother. A brother was psychopathic, and died of drink. Patient was\r\n  always peculiar, obstinate, silent, quick-tempered, and eccentric. The\r\n  brothers and sisters are excitable people. Pulmonary phthisis has been\r\n  frequent in her family. When only a girl of thirteen, with signs of\r\n  great sexual excitement, she attracted attention by enthusiastic love\r\n  for a female friend of her own age. Her education was strict, though\r\n  the patient secretly read many novels, and wrote innumerable poems.\r\n  She married at eighteen to free herself from unpleasant circumstances\r\n  at home.\r\n\r\n  She says she has always been indifferent toward men. In fact, she\r\n  avoided balls. Female statues pleased her. Her greatest happiness was\r\n  to think of marriage with a beloved woman. She was not aware of her\r\n  sexual peculiarity until marriage, and the thing had remained\r\n  inexplicable to her. Patient did her marital duty, and bore three\r\n  children, two of whom were subject to convulsions. She lived\r\n  pleasantly with her husband, but she esteemed him only for his moral\r\n  qualities. She gladly avoided coitus. “I should have preferred\r\n  intercourse with a woman.”\r\n\r\n  Until 1878 she had been neurasthenic. On the occasion of a sojourn at\r\n  a watering-place, she made the acquaintance of a female urning, whose\r\n  history I have reported as Case 6, in the _Irrenfreund_, No. 1, 1884.\r\n\r\n  The patient came home a changed person. Her husband says: “She was no\r\n  longer a woman, no longer had any love for me and the children, and\r\n  would have no more of marital approaches. She was inflamed with\r\n  passionate love for her female friend, and had taste for nothing\r\n  else.” After the husband forbade her lover the house, there was\r\n  interchange of letters with such expressions in them as “My dove! I\r\n  live only for you, my soul.” There were meetings and frightful\r\n  excitement when an expected letter did not come. The relation was in\r\n  nowise platonic. From certain indications it is presumable that mutual\r\n  masturbation was the means of sensual satisfaction. This relation\r\n  lasted until 1882, and made the patient decidedly neurasthenic.\r\n\r\n  She absolutely neglected the house, and her husband hired a woman of\r\n  sixty years as a house-keeper, and also a governess for the children.\r\n  The patient fell in love with both, who, at least, allowed caresses,\r\n  and profited materially through the love of their mistress.\r\n\r\n  In the latter part of 1883, on account of developing pulmonary\r\n  tuberculosis, she had to go south. There she became acquainted with a\r\n  Russian lady of forty years, and fell passionately in love with her;\r\n  but she did not meet with a return of love in her sense. One day\r\n  insanity became manifest. She thought the Russian lady a nihilist;\r\n  that she was magnetized by her; and she presented formal persecutory\r\n  delusions. She fled, and was caught in an Italian city, and placed in\r\n  a hospital, where she soon became quiet. Again she followed the lady\r\n  with her love, felt herself very unhappy, and planned suicide.\r\n\r\n  When she returned home, she was greatly depressed because she did not\r\n  have the lady, and was contrary toward her family. A delusive, erotic\r\n  state of excitement came on about the end of May, 1884. She danced,\r\n  shouted, and called herself a man; demanded her former lovers, and\r\n  said she was of royal blood. She escaped from the house in male\r\n  attire, and was taken to the asylum in a state of eroto-maniacal\r\n  excitement. After a few days the exaltation disappeared. The patient\r\n  became quiet, and made a despairing attempt at suicide; and after it\r\n  she was in great anguish of mind with tædium vitæ. The perverse sexual\r\n  feeling grew less and less noticeable, and the tuberculosis\r\n  progressed. The patient died of phthisis in the beginning of 1885.\r\n\r\n  The examination of the brain presented nothing unusual as far as\r\n  architecture and arrangement of convolutions were concerned. Weight of\r\n  brain 1150 grammes. Skull slightly asymmetrical. No anatomical signs\r\n  of degeneration. External and internal genitals without anomaly.\r\n\r\n3. _Effemination and Viraginity._—There are various transitions from the\r\nforegoing cases to those making up this category, characterized by the\r\ndegree in which the psychical personality, especially in general manner\r\nof feeling and inclinations, is influenced by the abnormal sexual\r\nfeeling. In this group, fully-developed cases in men are females in\r\nfeeling; in women, males. This abnormality of feeling and of development\r\nof the character is often apparent in childhood. The boy likes to spend\r\nhis time with girls, play with dolls, and help his mother about the\r\nhouse; he likes to cook, sew, knit, and develops taste in female\r\n_toilettes_, so that he may even become the adviser of his sisters. As\r\nhe grows older he eschews smoking, drinking, and manly sports, and, on\r\nthe contrary, finds pleasure in adornment of person, art,\r\n_belles-lettres_, etc., even to the extent of giving himself entirely to\r\nthe cultivation of the beautiful. Since women possess corresponding\r\ninclinations, he prefers to move in the society of women.\r\n\r\nIf he can assume the _rôle_ of a female at a masquerade, it is his\r\ngreatest delight. He seeks to please his lover, so to speak, by\r\nstudiously trying to represent what pleases the female-loving man in the\r\nopposite sex,—sweetness, sympathy, taste for æsthetics, poetry, etc.\r\nEfforts to approach the female appearance in gait, attitude, and style\r\nof dress are frequently seen.\r\n\r\nThe female urning, even when a little girl, presents the reverse. Her\r\nfavorite place is the play-ground of boys. She seeks to rival them in\r\ntheir games. The girl will have nothing to do with dolls; her passion is\r\nfor playing horse, soldier, and robber. For female employments there is\r\nmanifested not merely a lack of taste, but often unskillfulness in them.\r\nThe _toilette_ is neglected, and pleasure found in a coarse, boyish\r\nlife. Instead of an inclination for the arts, there is manifested an\r\ninclination and taste for the sciences. Occasionally there may be\r\nattempts to smoke and drink. Perfumes and cosmetics are abhorred. The\r\nconsciousness of being born a woman, and, therefore, of being compelled\r\nto renounce the University, with its gay life, and the army, induces\r\npainful reflections.\r\n\r\nIn the inclinations of the amazon for manly sports, the masculine soul\r\nin the female bosom manifests itself; and not less in the show of\r\ncourage and manly feeling. The female urning loves to wear her hair and\r\nhave her clothing in the fashion of men; and it is her greatest\r\npleasure, when opportunity offers, to appear in male attire. Her ideals\r\nare historical and contemporary feminine personalities distinguished for\r\nmind and energy.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the sexual feeling and instinct of these urnings, so\r\nthoroughly permeated in all their mental being, the men, without\r\nexception, feel themselves to be females; the women feel themselves to\r\nbe males. Thus they feel themselves to be antagonistic to persons of\r\ntheir own sex constituted like themselves; for, of course, they are like\r\nthem in form. But, on the other hand, they are drawn toward those of\r\ntheir own sex that are homo-sexual or sexually normal. The same jealousy\r\nwhich occurs in normal sexual life also occurs here, when rivalry is\r\nthreatened; and, indeed, since they are, as a rule, hyperæsthetic\r\nsexually, this jealousy is often boundless.\r\n\r\nIn cases of completely-developed contrary sexuality, hetero-sexual love\r\nis looked upon as a thing absolutely incomprehensible; sexual\r\nintercourse with a person of the opposite sex is unthinkable,\r\nimpossible. Such an attempt brings on the inhibitory concept of disgust\r\nor even horror, which makes erection impossible. Only two of my\r\ntransitional cases to the third category were able, with the help of\r\ntheir imagination, by thinking of themselves as men with reference to\r\nthe woman, to have cohabitation; but the act, which was inadequate for\r\nthem, was a great sacrifice, and afforded them no pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn homo-sexual intercourse the man always feels himself, in the act, as\r\na woman; the woman, as a man. The means of indulgence, in the case of a\r\nman, where there is irritable weakness of the ejaculation centre, are\r\nsimply _succubus_, or passive _coitus inter femora_; in other cases,\r\npassive masturbation, or _ejaculatio viri dilecti in ore proprio_. Many\r\nhave a desire for passive pederasty; occasionally a desire for active\r\npederasty occurs. In one attempt of this kind, the man desisted because\r\nof the disgust which seized him when the act reminded him of coitus.\r\n\r\n_There was never inclination for immature persons (boy-love)._ Not\r\ninfrequently there were only platonic desires. The sexual satisfaction\r\nof the female probably consists of _amor lesbicus_, or active\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\n  Case 119. _Autobiography._ “1. _Descent:_ I am now in my twenty third\r\n  year. I have chosen the study of the technical arts as an occupation,\r\n  and am completely satisfied with it. I had but the mild diseases of\r\n  children, while the other children, who are now healthy, had to pass\r\n  through severe illnesses. My parents are both living, and my father is\r\n  an advocate. He, like my mother, is, as we say, nervously\r\n  hyper-sensitive. In my father’s family there were two other children,\r\n  who died early.\r\n\r\n  “2. _My person:_ As for my physical peculiarities, I am of robust\r\n  figure, without being of especially handsome form; eyes, gray; hair,\r\n  blonde; hair and beard correspond with my sex and years. The mammæ and\r\n  genitals are normally developed. My gait is firm and almost heavy; my\r\n  bearing, careless. It is remarkable that the breadth of the pelvis is\r\n  exactly equal to that of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n  “I am naturally well endowed mentally. In one of my certificates my\r\n  talents are, in fact, called ‘excellent.’ Without any particular\r\n  desire to excel in them, I passed my examinations with distinction. I\r\n  have an interest in everything that concerns the well-being of\r\n  humanity, and in science, art, and industry. With my energy it is\r\n  comparatively easy to postpone for a time the satisfaction of my\r\n  desires, which will be described hereafter. Intentionally and\r\n  consciously, I curse the morality of to-day, which forces those who\r\n  are abnormal sexually to break laws that are voluntarily established,\r\n  and regards sexual congress of two persons of the same sex as a matter\r\n  depending on the choice of the individual, and a matter in which\r\n  law-makers have a right to interfere. From my studies I have found the\r\n  most earnest incentives to construct, on the basis of the Darwinian\r\n  theory, after Carneri’s method, a system of morals, which, to be sure,\r\n  does not harmonize with the prevailing system, but which seeks to\r\n  elevate and improve mankind in accordance with natural law.\r\n\r\n  “I think that there are not many marks of hereditary taint in me.\r\n  There is a certain hyper-sensitiveness. A very intense dream-life is\r\n  perhaps important. In general, it is occupied with indifferent\r\n  matters, and never has so-called sensual images as a subject; at most,\r\n  in this direction, it is concerned only with female attire and putting\r\n  it on, which for me is a lustful thought. At the same time, until my\r\n  sixteenth year, it often went to the extent of somnambulism, or, very\r\n  frequently, as is still often the case, to loud talking in sleep.\r\n\r\n  “3. _My inclinations:_ The above-mentioned abnormal proclivity is the\r\n  fundamental factor in my sexual feeling. When I am dressed like a\r\n  woman, I feel perfectly satisfied. A peculiar feeling of peace and\r\n  comfort comes over me, which allows me to work mentally with greater\r\n  ease. My libido for indulgence in sexual intercourse is extremely\r\n  slight. Too, I have much love and taste for female handiwork, and,\r\n  without assistance, I learned to crochet and embroider, and I like to\r\n  do these things in secret. I also like other female employments, like\r\n  sewing, etc.; so that at home, where I keep my proclivity perfectly\r\n  concealed, and guard against indulging it by involuntary activity, I\r\n  have often won the praise of being as good as a servant-girl; which\r\n  did not make me ashamed, but, on the contrary, filled me with secret\r\n  pride. I can make nothing out of dancing with women; I liked to dance\r\n  only with my school-fellows, for which the manner of our instruction\r\n  in dancing gave opportunity. But in this it gave me pleasure only when\r\n  I could dance as a lady. A multitude of other desires and dreams,\r\n  which seem to have something typical about them, I pass over, because\r\n  they seem exactly similar to those described in ‘Psychopathia\r\n  Sexualis.’ .... In other respects my inclinations are not different\r\n  from those of my sex. I smoke and drink moderately, love delicacies,\r\n  and have no pleasure in physical exercises.\r\n\r\n  “4. _Development:_ After this brief description of my personality, I\r\n  may pass on to an analysis of the developmental history of my\r\n  abnormality. As soon as I was able, to some extent, to think\r\n  independently, and I understood the difference between the sexes, it\r\n  was my secret and fixed desire to be a girl. In fact, I believed I was\r\n  one. But when in the bath I saw the same genitals on other boys, the\r\n  impossibility of my thought became apparent. I reduced my wish, and\r\n  hoped that I was at least an hermaphrodite. And, owing to the fact\r\n  that I had a certain shyness about looking closely at pictures or\r\n  descriptions of the genitals, this hope was entertained,\r\n  notwithstanding the fact that I had abundant opportunity to read\r\n  writings on the subject, until my studies compelled me to make a\r\n  closer acquaintance with the matter. During this time I read\r\n  everything I could get about hermaphroditism, and longed to be in the\r\n  place of the female who, as the newspapers often reported, had been\r\n  raised as a male and been restored to her sex by accident. The\r\n  recognition of my masculinity made an end of this dreaming, and did\r\n  not fill me with any especial delight. I tried to destroy my sexual\r\n  glands by gradual pressure, but pain soon caused me to desist. My\r\n  longing is still for the external characteristics of the female\r\n  sex,—for a pretty coiffure, a rounded breast, a slim waist.\r\n\r\n  “At the age of twelve I first had an opportunity to put on female\r\n  attire; and I soon came to drape myself, by means of bed-clothes,\r\n  bed-linen, etc., with female petticoats. When I grew older, it was my\r\n  greatest delight to put on my sister’s dresses secretly, even if it\r\n  could be but for a few moments, and with constant danger of detection.\r\n  Later, much to my delight, I had an opportunity to play a female\r\n  _rôle_ in a love-scene; and it is said that I was not at all bad in\r\n  the part. When I began to lead an independent life as a student, I\r\n  immediately obtained female dresses and linen, which I kept in order\r\n  myself. When at night, safe from discovery, I can put on one article\r\n  after another, from corset to apron and bracelet, I am perfectly\r\n  satisfied, and devote myself to some quiet employment, inwardly happy\r\n  and full of delight in doing it. While dressing, an erection usually\r\n  occurs, but it is never followed by an ejaculation, and soon\r\n  disappears. I also try to approximate the female appearance in\r\n  externals, by arranging my hair appropriately and removing the beard,\r\n  which I should have preferred to tear out.\r\n\r\n  “5. _Sexual inclinations:_ In passing to the description of my sexual\r\n  proclivities, I desire, first, to note, in general, that puberty\r\n  occurred normally, as I judge from the pollutions that occurred, the\r\n  change of voice, etc. Pollutions still occur regularly once every\r\n  three weeks, seldom more frequently. With them I never experience any\r\n  lustful feeling. I have never practiced onanism; until lately I knew\r\n  nothing more of it than its name, and I had to seek direct information\r\n  about it, in order to understand it. Any touch on the erect penis is\r\n  disturbing and painful to me, and without lustful feeling.\r\n\r\n  “Previously I behaved very shyly toward women, but I now act quietly,\r\n  and associate with them as with my kind. Direct excitation, in a\r\n  sexual sense, by a woman, sometimes occurred; but when I try to\r\n  analyze this, it seems to me that it was never her person, but rather\r\n  her attire alone, that was effectual. I fell in love with her dress,\r\n  and the thought of wearing one like it was heavenly. Thus sexual\r\n  excitation never took place, not even in brothels where I was led by\r\n  friends, in spite of the sight of the greatest voluptuousness and\r\n  beauty. But friendly feelings for the female sex were in my heart. I\r\n  imagined how, dressed as a woman and unrecognized, I could stay with\r\n  them, associate with them, and take pleasure with them. I prefer the\r\n  impression made on me by girls whose breasts have not yet fully\r\n  developed, particularly those wearing the hair short; for such girls\r\n  are more nearly like me and my aspect. Once I was so fortunate as to\r\n  find a girl who felt unhappy in her sex. We formed a firm bond of\r\n  friendship with one another, and we often took delight in the idea of\r\n  exchanging places. Perhaps it is not inappropriate or unimportant for\r\n  the characterization, to record the following: Some months ago, when\r\n  the story was running through the newspapers of an Hungarian countess\r\n  who, dressed as a man, had married, and felt like a man, in all\r\n  earnestness, I thought of offering myself to her, in order to contract\r\n  an inverted marriage,—she as husband, I as wife.... I have never\r\n  attempted coitus, and have never felt any desire for it. But since I\r\n  foresaw that the erection necessary with a woman would be wanting, I\r\n  thought of putting on some of her clothing; and I think that then the\r\n  expected result would occur.\r\n\r\n  “As for my behavior toward male persons, first of all, it is to be\r\n  emphasized that I had the warmest friendships during my school-days.\r\n  My heart was full of happiness, if I could do some small service for\r\n  the object of my devotion. I really worshiped him passionately. But,\r\n  on the slightest occasion, I evinced terrible jealousy; and while my\r\n  anger lasted I felt as if I could neither live nor die. When\r\n  reconciliation occurred, for a short time I was the happiest of\r\n  creatures. I also tried to make friends of boys, whom I bribed with\r\n  sweetmeats, and whom I should gladly have kissed. Though my love\r\n  always remained platonic, yet it is abnormal. An expression that I\r\n  unconsciously made at that time about an elder friend, whom I\r\n  worshiped, shows that. I said I loved him so that I should have liked\r\n  to marry him. And even now, when I indulge but little in intercourse,\r\n  I am easily taken with a handsome man with a fine beard and refined\r\n  features. Yet I have never met a being feeling like myself, whom I\r\n  could confide in, and with whom I could live as a female friend. I\r\n  never attempted to exercise my inclinations directly, and never\r\n  committed any foolish act of this kind. Finally I ceased to visit\r\n  museums where nude male figures were displayed; for the erections,\r\n  which were sure to occur, were exceedingly annoying. I had often\r\n  secretly wished to sleep with a man, and often found opportunity. I\r\n  was asked by a rather unattractive elderly man to sleep with him. Cum\r\n  eo concubui, ille genitalia mea tetigit; and though his person was\r\n  unattractive to me, I was filled with an intense feeling of lust. I\r\n  felt as if completely surrendered to him; in a word, _I felt like a\r\n  woman_.\r\n\r\n  “If I may be permitted to add a concluding word to what I have already\r\n  said, I wish to state expressely that, though I am conscious of the\r\n  abnormality of my inclinations, I have no desire to change them; I\r\n  long only for a time when, more easily and with less danger of\r\n  discovery, I can give rein to my desires and experience a delight that\r\n  will harm no one.”\r\n\r\n  Case 120. Miss Z., aged 31, artist, comes for consultation on account\r\n  of neurasthenic symptoms. She is remarkable for coarse, masculine\r\n  features, a deep voice, short hair, a masculine style of dress,\r\n  masculine gait, and self-consciousness. In other respects she is\r\n  feminine, with well-developed mammæ and a female pelvis, and without\r\n  any indication of beard.\r\n\r\n  Examination with reference to contrary sexual instinct gives a\r\n  positive result:—\r\n\r\n  The patient states that even when a little girl she preferred to play\r\n  with boys, and particularly “soldier,” “merchant,” and “robber.” She\r\n  was very wild and unrestrained in these games with boys, but never had\r\n  any proclivity for dolls or female employment, of which she learned\r\n  only the most ordinary things (knitting, sewing).\r\n\r\n  In school she made good progress, being especially interested in\r\n  mathematics and chemistry. She early had a desire for sculpture, and\r\n  showed talent for it. Her greatest ambition was to become a real\r\n  artist. In her dreams of the future, she never thought of marriage. As\r\n  an artist, she was interested in handsome men, but she was really\r\n  attracted only by female forms; she saw male forms only “in the\r\n  distance.” She could never endure “trumpery”; “manly dress” was all\r\n  that pleased her. The ordinary society of girls was repugnant to her,\r\n  because their talk about _toilettes_, ornaments, and love-affairs with\r\n  men, seemed stale and tiresome to her. On the other hand, since her\r\n  childhood she had had enthusiastic friendships with certain girls; at\r\n  the age of ten she was in love with a girl companion, and wrote her\r\n  name everywhere. Since then she had had numerous female friends, with\r\n  whom she had indulged in passionate kissing. She pleased the girls, as\r\n  a rule, because of her masculine bearing. She wrote poems to her\r\n  female friends, and could have done anything out of love for them. To\r\n  her it was very remarkable that she was embarrassed before girls,\r\n  especially when they were friends. She could not undress before them.\r\n  The more she loved a friend, the more modest she was before her.\r\n\r\n  At the present time she has such a relation. She kisses and embraces\r\n  her Laura, walks by her window, and suffers all the pangs of jealousy,\r\n  particularly when she sees her conversing with men. Her only wish is\r\n  to live always with this female friend.\r\n\r\n  The patient states, however, that twice in her life men have made an\r\n  impression on her. She thinks that if she had been really sought,\r\n  there would have been a marriage; for she is very fond of family life\r\n  and children. If a man wished to possess her, it would be necessary\r\n  for him to win her; she herself would prefer to win a female friend.\r\n  She thinks woman is more beautiful and ideal than man. In her\r\n  infrequent erotic dreams, the subject had always been a female. She\r\n  had never dreamed of men. She does not think that she could now love a\r\n  man; for men are false, and she herself is nervous and anæmic.\r\n\r\n  She considers herself a woman in all respects, but regrets that she is\r\n  not a man. Even at the age of four it had been her greatest pleasure\r\n  to put on boys’ clothes. She certainly had a masculine character, and,\r\n  too, had never wept. Her greatest passion was for riding, gymnastics,\r\n  fencing, and driving. She suffered much because no one about her\r\n  understood her. It seemed silly to her to talk about feminine things.\r\n  Many of her acquaintances had thought that she should really have been\r\n  a man.\r\n\r\n  The patient says that she was never sensual. In embracing female\r\n  friends, she had often experienced a peculiar lustful feeling.\r\n  Embracing and kissing had been her only manner of expressing her\r\n  friendship.\r\n\r\n  The patient states that she comes of a nervous father, and an insane\r\n  mother who, as a young girl, had been passionately in love with her\r\n  own brother, and had tried to induce him to flee with her to America.\r\n  The patient’s brother is a very eccentric, peculiar man.\r\n\r\n  The patient presents no external degenerative signs; head regular. She\r\n  says the menses began at fourteen, and that they have been regular,\r\n  but always painful.\r\n\r\n  Case 121. “In order to designate at once my unhappy diseased condition\r\n  with its correct name, I will state at the beginning that it bears all\r\n  the marks of what, in your work, ‘Psychopathia Sexualis,’ you have\r\n  named _effemination_.\r\n\r\n  “I am now thirty-eight years old, and, thanks to my abnormality, I\r\n  look back on a life that has been full of indescribable suffering; so\r\n  that I am often astonished to think what capacity for suffering a man\r\n  has. Of late consciousness of the suffering I have endured has become\r\n  the source of a kind of self-respect, which, in itself, makes my life,\r\n  in a measure, endurable.\r\n\r\n  “But I shall now endeavor to describe my condition with all truth. I\r\n  am physically healthy, and, as far as I can remember, have never had\r\n  any severe illness. I come of a healthy family. But my parents are\r\n  both of a very excitable nature, my father being of the so-called\r\n  choleric, and my mother of the sanguine, temperament; she has a strong\r\n  tendency to mild melancholia. She is a lively woman, loved for her\r\n  good-heartedness and active benevolence; but she is still very\r\n  dependent and deficient in self-confidence. All these peculiarities\r\n  were marked in her father. I mention this fact, because I am told that\r\n  I resemble them both; and as far as the last two peculiarities are\r\n  concerned, I can myself acknowledge the resemblance. But when I made\r\n  attempts, by means of my inner strength and by thinking of my own\r\n  power, to rend the bond that, with magic force, draws me to men, there\r\n  was always a residuum left that I could not eradicate. As far as I can\r\n  remember, I have always had this elementary longing for a male lover.\r\n  To be sure, its first expressions were of a coarse, sensual nature. I\r\n  do not know whether I was yet ten years old, when, while lying in bed\r\n  in the day-time, I suddenly discovered how, by pressure on my\r\n  genitals, I induced a new and intoxicating feeling, while fancying\r\n  that a man of my acquaintance performed sensual manipulations on me.\r\n  It was only many years afterward that I learned that this was onanism.\r\n  At first I was so frightened and so depressed by the inexplicableness\r\n  of my longing, that I then made my first attempt at suicide. If I had\r\n  only put it into execution! For since then there has been such\r\n  frequent violent agitation of mind and body that my heart has been\r\n  bound as with a chain, and made cold. I may say at once that, up to\r\n  the present time, onanism has not loosened me from its clutches; it\r\n  has overcome all attempts and efforts to escape, and my desire to\r\n  resist it is almost destroyed. Three or four times I have given it up\r\n  for a month at a time, usually under the influence of mental\r\n  excitement.\r\n\r\n  “When about thirteen, I had my first love. To-day it seems as if my\r\n  greatest wish then was to kiss my school-fellow’s fresh, rosy lips. It\r\n  was a passion full of romantic dreams. At the age of fifteen or\r\n  sixteen it became more violent, when I first experienced the insane\r\n  pangs of a jealousy which is more terrible than that of natural love\r\n  can be. This second period of my life lasted for years, though I spent\r\n  but a few days with the object of my passion; and then we did not see\r\n  each other for fifteen years. Gradually my feeling cooled, and I then\r\n  fell passionately in love several times with other men, who, with the\r\n  exception of one, were about my own age.\r\n\r\n  “My love—if you will kindly allow this expression for a feeling\r\n  condemned by the majority of mankind—has never been returned; I have\r\n  never had intercourse with a man in any way that would not bear the\r\n  light of day; never has any one shown even extraordinary interest in\r\n  me, though one of my friends discovered my secret longing; and yet I\r\n  have had a burning desire for masculine love. In this longing my\r\n  feelings seem to me to be entirely those of a loving woman; and I\r\n  notice, with horror, that my sensual ideas grow more and more like\r\n  those of a woman. During the periods when I am free from any\r\n  particular love, my longing degenerates so that, in my onanistic\r\n  manipulations, I conjure up only coarse, sensual ideas. But I am still\r\n  finally able to overcome these. My efforts to repress the love,\r\n  however, are absolutely vain. At the present time I am again suffering\r\n  with such an exaggerated state of feeling that has existed for months;\r\n  and I have pondered so much over its peculiarities that I think I can\r\n  describe my feelings truthfully. In this way I have made the peculiar\r\n  observation that I have never loved a bearded man. From this it might\r\n  easily be presumed that I am given to so-called boy-love; but that is\r\n  not the case. For, to the sensual charm, on closer association, a\r\n  mental interest is added. With this begins the mental pain. I am\r\n  seized with such a passionate longing that I am willing to sacrifice\r\n  myself, in a way. I excite confidence in myself; and from this mutual\r\n  feeling a heart-felt friendship might be engendered, if deep down in\r\n  my soul were not sleeping the demon which impels me to the closest of\r\n  relationships, which is allowed only between human beings of opposite\r\n  sex. My whole being, every fibre of my body, longs for it, and I am\r\n  consumed by a hot, glowing passion. I wonder that here I can again\r\n  describe in unfeeling words the feelings that coursed through my whole\r\n  being. Of course, by the struggle of years, I have been forced to\r\n  learn to conceal my inclination, and smile when torn by pain. For, in\r\n  never having my love returned, I have learned to know all the\r\n  sufferings of love. Jealousy—insane, blinding jealousy—of any and\r\n  every body who casts but a friendly glance at the object of my secret\r\n  love!\r\n\r\n  “I have emphasized the mental element, in order to show how deeply\r\n  rooted my abnormal impulse is. I have never felt the slightest touch\r\n  of sensual love for the opposite sex. The idea of being forced to\r\n  associate sensually with women is repugnant to me. At times I have\r\n  suffered enough on being assured of the love of young girls. Like\r\n  every young man, I have had abundant opportunity to enjoy the modern\r\n  social pleasures, dancing among them. I like to dance; but if I could\r\n  dance with men, as a girl, I should be really happy.\r\n\r\n  “I wish once more to remark that my love is entirely sensual. How\r\n  could I otherwise explain the fact that the pressure of my lover’s\r\n  hand, often merely his glance, causes palpitation and erection! I have\r\n  done everything to eradicate this love from my—let us say ‘heart.’ I\r\n  have tried to still it by means of onanism; to drag it in the mire, in\r\n  order to raise myself above it. (About ten years ago, during such a\r\n  time of love, I avoided onanism, and felt that my feeling of love\r\n  elevated me.) I still entertain the delusion that if the object of my\r\n  love were to tell me he loved me, that he loved me, and only me, I\r\n  should willingly give up sensual gratification to repose in faithful\r\n  arms. But that is certainly a self-deception.\r\n\r\n  “Honored sir, I have a responsible occupation, and I think I can give\r\n  the assurance that my abnormal inclination has never, even in a hair’s\r\n  breadth, caused me to deviate from the duty imposed on me. Aside from\r\n  this abnormality, I am not insane, and I might ultimately become\r\n  contented; but I have, particularly of late years, suffered too much\r\n  not to look on the future with painful feeling. For the future will\r\n  certainly not bring fulfillment of the desire which constantly glows\r\n  under the ashes,—the desire to possess a lover who understands and\r\n  returns my love. Such a relation would make me truly happy. I have\r\n  thought much about the origin of my abnormality, particularly because\r\n  I think I am forced to assume that it was not inherited. I believe\r\n  that onanism has changed the inborn feeling into a burning passion. I\r\n  might long ago have put an end to my misery, since I have no fear of\r\n  death, and since in religion—which, strange to say, has not departed\r\n  from my impure heart—I find no warning against suicide. But the\r\n  consciousness that I am not alone responsible, and that a worm has\r\n  nipped my whole life in the bud,—a certain comfort that has sprung up\r\n  of late out of indescribable suffering,—leads me to see whether\r\n  comparative happiness in life cannot be obtained on an entirely new\r\n  basis: something which fills the whole heart. I think I could be happy\r\n  under the influence of quiet family life. But I dare not conceal from\r\n  you the fact that the thought of married life with a wife is terrible\r\n  to me, and that I make the attempt of a change of life with a bleeding\r\n  heart; for thus I absolutely abandon the hope that is always awake;\r\n  namely, the delusion that fate may yet bring me the desired happiness.\r\n\r\n  “This delusion is so deeply rooted in me that I think nothing but\r\n  hypnotic suggestion could help me. If you could advise me, you would\r\n  make me unspeakably happy. Of course, your strictest injunction would\r\n  be to abandon onanism. How gladly I would follow it! But if I were not\r\n  to have direct physical, some mechanical, means at hand to help me, I\r\n  should certainly be unable to free myself from this vice; and this the\r\n  more, because I fear that, by long years of habit, my nature has\r\n  become accustomed to it. Of course, I have not escaped the effects of\r\n  it, even though they are not so terrible as they are often pictured. I\r\n  suffer with mild nervousness, am, indeed, weakened, and have\r\n  periodical disturbance of digestion; but I can still endure hard work,\r\n  and take a certain pleasure in it, when it is not too great. I am\r\n  depressed, but I can be happy, and, fortunately, I take pleasure in my\r\n  calling, and am interested in various things, particularly music, art,\r\n  and _belles-lettres_. I have never indulged in female pursuits.\r\n\r\n  “As may be seen from the foregoing, I like to associate with men,\r\n  especially with those who are handsome; but I have never had intimate\r\n  relations with them. A wide gulf separates me from them!\r\n\r\n  “_Postscript:_ I feared that in the foregoing I had not described my\r\n  sexual life with sufficient exactness. It consists only in onanism;\r\n  but in it I abandon myself to almost all the repugnant acts that are\r\n  comprehended under coitus inter femora, ejaculatio in ore, etc.\r\n\r\n  “My _rôle_ is passive. When I am seized by a passion, the ideas\r\n  change, and become entirely a desire to be impregnated. The struggle\r\n  against such a passion is so terrible, because my mind is also\r\n  implicated. I long for the closest, the most complete union that can\r\n  be conceived as existing between two men,—always together, common\r\n  interests, unlimited confidence, sexual union. I think that natural\r\n  love is different from this only in its degree of warmth; it does not\r\n  reach the boiling-point of our passion. Just now I am fighting the\r\n  battle over again; with force I stifle the insane passion that has so\r\n  long enthralled me. All night long I walk about, followed by the image\r\n  of him I love; for love of whom I would give up all I possess. How sad\r\n  it is that the noblest feeling given to man—friendship—is sullied by\r\n  common sensual feeling!\r\n\r\n  “I wish once more to state that I cannot come to the determination to\r\n  transform my sexual life by means of sexual intercourse with the\r\n  opposite sex. The thought of such intercourse fills me with repugnance\r\n  and disgust.”\r\n\r\n  Case 122. “I write, as well as I can, the history of my suffering,\r\n  actuated only by the desire, by this autobiography, to clear up to\r\n  some extent the misunderstanding and errors concerning ‘contrary\r\n  sexual instinct’ which are still so widely prevalent.\r\n\r\n  “I am thirty-seven years old, and come of healthy parents, both of\r\n  whom were very nervous. I only mention this, because I have often had\r\n  the thought that my contrary sexual instinct came by way of\r\n  inheritance; but this is nothing more than vague. Of my grandparents,\r\n  whom I did not know, the only remarkable thing I can mention is, that\r\n  my maternal grandfather was known as a great Don Juan.\r\n\r\n  “I was rather a weak child, and during my first two years suffered\r\n  severely with fits, as a result of which my understanding and memory\r\n  may have suffered; for I learn but slowly things which do not\r\n  particularly interest me, and easily forget them. I may also mention\r\n  that, during the time before I was born, my mother was subject to\r\n  violent mental excitement, and was often frightened. From my third\r\n  year I have been perfectly well, and have escaped severe illness. Only\r\n  when a boy, from the age of twelve to sixteen, I had peculiar,\r\n  indescribable nervous sensations, which made themselves felt in my\r\n  head and finger-tips, and in which it seemed to me as if my whole\r\n  being were about to cease. For many years, however, these attacks have\r\n  ceased to occur. I am rather a powerful man, with abundant growth of\r\n  hair, and in all respects masculine.\r\n\r\n  “Even when a boy of six years, I came independently to masturbate,\r\n  and, until my nineteenth year, I practiced the vice quite\r\n  persistently; and even now, _faute de mieux_, I quite frequently\r\n  resort to it, notwithstanding the fact that I understand the vileness\r\n  of the passion, and always feel somewhat weakened after it. But sexual\r\n  intercourse with a man does not affect me in the least; on the\r\n  contrary, it gives me a feeling of being strengthened. I began school\r\n  at the age of seven, and soon experienced an intense feeling of\r\n  sympathy for my companions, which, however, made no other impression\r\n  on me. In the Gymnasium, at the age of fourteen, my companions\r\n  explained to me the sexual life of man, which, up to that time, was\r\n  absolutely unknown to me; but I was not much interested in the matter.\r\n  At this time I also practiced mutual onanism with two or three friends\r\n  who had seduced me into it; and it had an extraordinary charm for me.\r\n  I was still perfectly unconscious of the perversity of my sexual\r\n  instinct, and considered my vices as sins of youth, like those\r\n  committed by all boys of the same age. Interest in the female sex I\r\n  thought would come in time. Thus I became nineteen years old. During\r\n  the following years I fell insanely in love three times,—once with a\r\n  very handsome actor, then with a bank employé, and with one of my\r\n  friends, the last two being men who were nothing less than beautiful,\r\n  and calculated to excite sensual feeling. But this love was merely\r\n  platonic, and occasionally found expression in glowing poetry. It was,\r\n  perhaps, the most perfect period of my life; for I regarded everything\r\n  with pure, innocent eyes. In my twenty-first year\r\n\r\nI gradually began to notice that I was not constituted exactly like my\r\ncomrades; for I found no pleasure in masculine pursuits. I had but\r\nlittle liking for smoking, drinking, and card-playing, and I was\r\nfrightened to death by a brothel. I have never been in one; I was always\r\nable to avoid visiting one on some pretext or other. But I now began to\r\nthink about myself; I often felt terribly lonesome, miserable, and\r\nunhappy, and longed for a friend constituted like myself, without,\r\nhowever, ever thinking that there could be other men like me. At\r\ntwenty-two I made the acquaintance of a young man who finally explained\r\nto me contrary sexual instinct and the individuals affected with it. He,\r\nbeing also an urning, was in love with me. It was as if scales had\r\nfallen from my eyes; and I bless the day this explanation came to me.\r\nFrom that time I saw the world with different eyes; I saw that many\r\nothers were given the same fate; and I began to learn to content myself\r\nwith this lot as well as I could. Unfortunately, I did not succeed very\r\nwell, and I am still often seized with bitterness and a deep hatred of\r\nthe modern ideas which treat us poor urnings with such terrible\r\nharshness. For what is our fate? In most cases we are not understood,\r\nand are derided and despised; and even when all goes well, and we are\r\nunderstood, we are still pitied like invalids or the insane,—and pity\r\nwas always sickening to me. I now began to play a part, in order to\r\ndeceive my fellow-men as to my state of mind; and it always gave me\r\ngreat satisfaction to succeed in this. I made the acquaintance of\r\nseveral men like myself, with whom I established relations, which,\r\nhowever, never lasted long; for I was very fearful and cautious; but, at\r\nthe same time, I was very particular and easily wearied.\r\n\r\n“I have always absolutely despised pederasty as something unworthy a\r\nman, and I only wish that all those like me would do the same; but,\r\nunfortunately, with many this is not the case. If all like me thought as\r\nI do, then the contempt and scoffing of men that feel differently would\r\nbe a still greater injustice to us than it now is.\r\n\r\n“Toward the man I love I feel completely like a woman, and, therefore,\r\nin the sexual act I am quite passive. In general, my whole sensibility\r\nand feeling are feminine. I am vain, coquettish, fond of ornament, and\r\nlike to please others. I love to dress myself beautifully, and, in cases\r\nwhere I wish to please, I even make use of the arts of the toilet, in\r\nwhich I am quite skilled.\r\n\r\n“While I have but little interest in politics, I am passionately fond of\r\nmusic and an inspired follower of Richard Wagner. I have noticed this\r\npreference in the majority of us; I find that this music is perfectly in\r\naccord with our nature.\r\n\r\n“I play the violin quite well; I like reading, and read much, but I have\r\nlittle interest in anything else. Everything else in life is quite\r\nindifferent to me, owing to the deep resignation that more and more\r\ntakes possession of me.\r\n\r\n“Even though I should have reason to be satisfied with my fate, in that\r\nI have an assured position in a technical employment in a large city of\r\nGermany, still I take no pleasure in my calling. I should be best suited\r\nif, independent and free, I could travel about with a handsome lover,\r\nand live for music and literature, particularly for the theatre, which\r\nseems to me to be one of the greatest pleasures. A connection with a\r\ncourt theatre I think of as being very acceptable.\r\n\r\n“The only position or calling that seems really desirable to me is that\r\nof a great artist,—singer, actor, painter, or sculptor; and it seems to\r\nme that it would be even finer to be born to the throne of a king,—a\r\nwish that is in harmony with my pronounced desire for power. (If there\r\nis really such a thing as transmigration of souls, a subject I have\r\nstudied much, and which seems to me to clear up much, I must have lived\r\nat one time as an emperor, or ruler of some kind.) But a man must be\r\nborn to all this; and since I am not, I am without ambition for\r\nso-called social honors and distinctions.\r\n\r\n“As to my tastes, I must mention a painful dissension there is in them.\r\nHandsome, intellectual young men of at least twenty years, who must be\r\nof my own social station, seem to me to be suited rather for platonic\r\nlove; but with them I satisfy myself completely with a straightforward,\r\nthough ideal, friendship, which seldom goes beyond a few kisses. But I\r\ncan be excited sensually only by coarse, powerful men that are at least\r\nof my own age, and mentally and socially beneath me. The reason for this\r\nstrange phenomenon may be that my pronounced feeling of shame and my\r\ninnate apprehensiveness, with my cautious disposition, have the effect\r\nof an inhibitory idea with men of my own social position; so that with\r\nthem it is with difficulty and seldom that I can induce sexual\r\nexcitement in myself. That this diversity is painful to me is owing to\r\nthe fact that I am always afraid to discover myself to these simple men,\r\nbelow me in station, who may often be bought with money. But I cannot\r\nimagine anything worse than a scandal, which would at once drive me to\r\nsuicide. For I can think of nothing more terrible than, through some\r\nslight act of carelessness or the enmity of any man, suddenly to be\r\nbranded before the world, and to be powerless to avert it. But what is\r\nit that we do that is so different from what normally constituted men\r\ncan do, at least, quite as frequently without embarrassment, and without\r\nshame? That we do not feel as the crowd feels is not our fault, but a\r\ncruel trick of Nature.\r\n\r\n“Innumerable times I have puzzled my brain to know whether science, or\r\nany of her free and unprejudiced devotees, could think of any way in\r\nwhich to give us step-children of Nature a more endurable position\r\nbefore the law and mankind. But I have always reached the same sad\r\nconclusion, that when one enters the lists in behalf of anything, he\r\nmust first know thoroughly, and be able to explain, that for which he\r\ncontends. And who is to-day able to perfectly explain and define\r\ncontrary sexual instinct? Yet there must be some correct explanation of\r\nit; there must be some way in which the mass of mankind can be brought\r\nto a milder and more reasonable judgment of it; and, first of all, there\r\nmust be some way to show that contrary sexual instinct should not be\r\nregarded as meaning the same as pederasty, as the majority of men—I may\r\nsay all—regard it. By such an act a man might erect for himself an\r\nimmortal monument in the gratitude of thousands of men of present and\r\nfuture generations; for there have been, are, and will ever be, urnings,\r\nand in greater number than perhaps has been suspected.\r\n\r\n“In Wilbrand’s work, ‘Fridolin’s Secret Marriage,’ I find a very\r\nplausible theory given in explanation of this matter; for I myself have\r\nrepeatedly had opportunity to observe that all urnings do not love men\r\nwith the same intensity, but that there are innumerable\r\nsub-varieties,—from the most feminine man to the man of contrary\r\nsexuality who is equally sensitive to female charms. This may also\r\naccount for the so-called difference between congenital and acquired\r\ncontrary sexual instinct, which, in my inadequate opinion, does not\r\nexist. Yet, in all the fifty-five individuals I have become acquainted\r\nwith in the three years since I came to understand this matter, I have\r\nmet the same peculiarities of temperament, disposition, and character.\r\nAlmost all of them are more or less idealists: they smoke but little, or\r\nnot at all; they are bigoted, vain, desirous of admiration, and\r\nsuperstitious; and, unfortunately, I must confess that they combine more\r\nthe defects and the reverse sides of both sexes than their good\r\nqualities. For woman in a sexual _rôle_ I experience a feeling of true\r\nhorror, which I could never overcome, even with the help of my extremely\r\nlively imagination. I have never attempted it, because I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced of the fruitlessness of such an attempt, that seems to me\r\nunnatural and sinful.\r\n\r\n“In purely social and friendly relations, I like to associate with\r\nladies and girls, and I am gladly welcomed in ladies’ society; for I am\r\nmuch interested in the fashions for ladies, and know how to talk of such\r\nthings with great skill. When I wish to, I can be very gay and amiable;\r\nbut my faculty for conversation is, for the most part, only assumed, and\r\nit always tires me. I have always had great skill in female work, and\r\nshown interest in it. As a child, and up to my thirteenth year, I was\r\npassionately fond of playing with dolls, whose clothes I made myself;\r\nand it still affords me much pleasure to work at beautiful embroidery,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, I can do only in secret. I have the same\r\npreference for knick-knacks, photographs, flowers, sweetmeats,\r\ntoilet-articles, and such feminine things; and my room, which I arranged\r\nand decorated myself, is like the over-crowded boudoir of a lady.\r\n\r\n“As particularly remarkable, I wish still to mention that I have never\r\nsuffered with pollutions. I dream very much, and intensely, almost every\r\nnight; occasionally I have lascivious dreams, which have only men as\r\nsubjects, but I always wake out of them before it comes to ejaculation.\r\nIn reality I am not very passionate sexually, and I have periods lasting\r\nfrom four to six weeks, in which I have almost no sexual desire.\r\nUnfortunately, these periods are infrequent, and they are usually\r\nfollowed by an awakening of my intense sexual desire that is only the\r\nmore violent; which, when it is unsatisfied, causes intense physical and\r\nmental suffering. I then become moody, depressed, sensitive, irritable,\r\nand retiring; peculiarities, however, which, with the first opportunity\r\nI have for sexual gratification, again disappear. I must mention, also,\r\nthat often, on the slightest occasion, my mood may change several times\r\nduring the day; it is like April weather.\r\n\r\n“I dance well, and like to; but I love dancing only for its rhythmical\r\nmovement, and because of my partiality for music.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, I wish to speak of something that always arouses\r\nrepugnance in me. We are usually considered diseased, and that is\r\nabsolutely incorrect. For in every disease there is a means of cure or\r\namelioration; but no power in the world can take from an urning his\r\nperverse natural constitution. Even suggestion, which has been used with\r\nso much apparent success, cannot induce any enduring change in the\r\nmental life of an urning. In us, effect is mistaken for cause. We are\r\nconsidered diseased, because in time the majority of us really become\r\nill. I am almost convinced that two-thirds of us, in later life, when we\r\nreally live so long, have a mental defect of one kind or another; and\r\nthis is only too easily explained. For, what strength of will and nerves\r\nis required for one to constantly dissimulate, lie, and play the\r\nhypocrite all his life! How often in the society of normal men, when the\r\nconversation turns to contrary sexual instinct, must one agree with the\r\nwords of abuse and contempt, while every one of them wounds the heart.\r\nOn the other hand, there are always the tiresome and indecent jokes and\r\ntalk about women, etc., that must be heard; and which to-day, in\r\nso-called ‘good society,’ are popular—and to show interest and give\r\nattention to them! Daily and hourly to see so many handsome men to whom\r\none cannot reveal himself; to be compelled to go without a friend,\r\nintercourse with whom we desire so much; and besides, constantly the\r\nfearful anxiety of betraying one’s self before the eyes of the world,\r\nand then standing covered with ignominy and shame! It is really no\r\nwonder that the majority of us are incapable of real work; for we need\r\nall our strength of will and power of endurance for the struggle with\r\nour own fate. How injurious it is to our nerves constantly to be\r\ncompelled to shut up all these thoughts and feelings in our hearts;\r\nwhere our lively fancy, feeding on it all, plays all the more intensely,\r\nso that we go about with a burning fire within us that only too often\r\nthreatens to consume us! Happy are those of us that are never denied the\r\nstrength to lead such a life; but those, too, are happy that have passed\r\nbeyond it.”\r\n\r\nCase 123. _Autobiography._ “In what follows, you will find the\r\ndescription of the character, as well as the mental and sexual\r\ndisposition, of an urning,—_i.e._, of an individual who, in spite of his\r\nmasculine form, feels as a woman, whose senses women do not excite, and\r\nwhose sexual desires are constantly directed toward men.\r\n\r\n“Convinced that the enigma of our existence can be solved, or, at least,\r\nilluminated, only by the unprejudiced thought of scientific men, I\r\ndescribe my life only with the aim of perhaps clearing up this cruel\r\nerror of Nature, and possibly doing a kindness to people like me to come\r\nin later generations; for there will be urnings as long as men are born,\r\njust as it is a fact that they have existed in every age. With the\r\nprogress of science in our epoch, men will see in me and those like me\r\nnot objects of hatred, but objects of pity, which deserve not the odium,\r\nbut the compassion, of their more fortunate brothers. I shall be as\r\nbrief as possible in my communication, and also objective; and, with\r\nreference to my caustic, often cynical, style, I may note that, above\r\nall, I shall be honest, and, therefore, not avoid strong expressions;\r\nfor they are most happily suited to the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n“I am in my thirty-fifth year; a merchant, with a fair income; somewhat\r\nabove average height, slim, weak of muscle, with full beard, and quite\r\nordinary face, and, at first sight, in nowise different from ordinary\r\nmen. On the other hand, my gait is feminine, and particularly mincing in\r\nfast walking; the movements are awkward and displeasing, indicative of a\r\nwant of manly feeling. The voice is neither feminine nor shrill, but\r\nrather a baritone.\r\n\r\n“This is my external appearance.\r\n\r\n“I do not smoke or drink, and can neither whistle, ride, do gymnastic\r\nfeats, fence, nor shoot. I have absolutely no interest in horses or\r\ndogs, and have never had a gun or sword in my hand. In inner feeling and\r\nsexual desire, I am completely a woman. Without thorough education,—I\r\npassed through but few classes in the Gymnasium,—I am yet intelligent,\r\nlike to read well-written, improving books, and have good judgment; but\r\nI allow myself to be carried away by the feelings of the moment, and I\r\nam easily influenced by any one who knows my weakness and how to make\r\nuse of it. Constantly making resolves, I have never the energy to carry\r\nthem out; like a woman, I am moody and nervous, often irritated without\r\nreason, and sometimes mean. Toward persons that do not please me, I am\r\narrogant, unjust, and often shamefully insulting.\r\n\r\n“In all my conduct I am superficial, and often frivolous, and I have no\r\ndeep moral feeling. I have little consideration for parents and brothers\r\nand sisters. I am not egotistic, but, on occasion, self-sacrificing. I\r\ncannot withstand tears, and can—like a woman—be won by amiability and\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n“In my earliest years I avoided playing soldier, gymnastics, or the\r\nrough games of my manly comrades, and ran about with little girls, with\r\nwhom I was much more in sympathy than with boys. I was retiring,\r\nbashful, and often blushing. When no more than twelve or thirteen years\r\nold, the close-fitting uniform of a handsome soldier gave me the most\r\npeculiar feeling; and while, during the next few years, my comrades were\r\nalways talking about girls, and even engaged in love-affairs, I could,\r\nfor hours at a time, run after a well-built man with well-rounded hips,\r\nand feast my eyes on the sight.\r\n\r\n“Without thinking much of these impressions, so different from the\r\nfeelings of my comrades, I began to masturbate, always during the act\r\nthinking of a heroic, handsome form; and this continued until my\r\nseventeenth year, when I learned from a companion constituted like\r\nmyself a true explanation of my condition. Since that time I have been\r\nwith girls eight or ten times; but, in order to have an erection, it was\r\nalways necessary to think of a handsome man of my acquaintance. And I am\r\nthoroughly convinced that to-day, even with the help of imagination, I\r\nshould be unable to have intercourse with a girl.\r\n\r\n“Shortly after my discovery I preferred to associate with mature,\r\npowerful urnings; for at this time I had neither mind nor opportunity to\r\nassociate with real men. Since this my taste has changed entirely, and\r\nmen, real men, of twenty-five or thirty-five years, with supple,\r\npowerful forms, are the only ones that ravish my senses, and charm me as\r\nif I were a woman. Circumstances have allowed me, during these years, to\r\nmake about a dozen male acquaintances that would serve my purpose for a\r\ngulden or two a visit. If I am alone in a room with a handsome youth, my\r\ngreatest pleasure is membrum ejus vel maxime si magnum atque crassum\r\nest, manibus capere et apprehendere et premere, turgentes nates\r\nfemoraque tangere atque totum corpus manibus contrectare et, si\r\nconceditur, os faciem atque totum corpus, immovero nates, ardentibus\r\nosculis obtegere. Quodsi membrum magnum purumque est, dominusque ejus\r\nmihi placet, ardente libidine mentulam ejus in os meum receptam\r\ncomplures horas sugere possum, neque autem delector, si semen in os meum\r\nejaculatur, cum maxima eorum qui “urnings” nominantur pars hac re non\r\nmodo delectatur, sed etiam semen nonnunquam devorat.\r\n\r\n“The most intense delight, however, is experienced when I find a real\r\nman, qui membrum meum in os recepit et erectionem in ore suo concedit.\r\n\r\n“Improbable as it sounds, I am yet able to find some coarse fellows who\r\nwill allow themselves to be used for this purpose. They learn the thing\r\nwhile in military service, for urnings know that under such\r\ncircumstances they can be made to do the most for money; and when the\r\nfellows are once trained, circumstances often compel them, in spite of\r\ntheir passion for the opposite sex, to continue the practice.\r\n\r\n“With certain exceptions, urnings make no impression on me, because\r\neverything feminine is repugnant to me. At the same time, there are some\r\nthat know how to give me the most intense pleasure, just as a real man\r\ncan; and I prefer to consort with them, for the reason that sometimes\r\nthey return my passionate caresses. In _tête-à-tête_ with such a person,\r\nI throw all check from my excited senses, and give my animal passions\r\nfree rein, osculor, premo, amplector eum, linguam meam in os ejus\r\nimmitto; ore cupiditate tremente ejus labrum superius sugo, faciem meam\r\nad ejus nates adpono et odore voluptari e natibus emanente voluptate\r\nobstupescor. Real men, in close-fitting uniform, make the deepest\r\nimpression on me; and if I have an opportunity to embrace and kiss such\r\na ravishing fellow, ejaculation takes place at once,—a weakness which I\r\nattribute to my frequent masturbation. In my earlier years I practiced\r\nit very frequently, almost every time I saw a man pleasing to me, whose\r\nimage I kept before my eye during the act. For this my taste is in\r\nnowise difficult to please—like that a servant-girl might have in\r\nfinding her ideal in a dragoon guard. A handsome face is a pleasant\r\nsupplement, inflaming my sensual desire, but in no respect an essential.\r\nThe requisite remains: vir inferiore corporis parte robusta et bene\r\nformosa, turgidis femoribus durisque natibus, while the upper portion of\r\nthe body may be slim. Corpulence disgusts me. A sensual mouth with\r\npretty teeth affects me more intensely; and if the person has also a\r\nmembrum pulchrum magnum et æqualiter formatum, all my demands—the most\r\nfar-reaching—are fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“When I was younger, with men that pleased me and excited my passions\r\nintensely, ejaculation took place from five to eight times in a night,\r\nand now it occurs from four to six times; for I am unusually strong\r\nsensually, and, as an example, even the clinking of a hussar’s sword may\r\nexcite me. At the same time, I have a very lively fancy, and spend most\r\nof my leisure hours thinking of handsome men with strong limbs; and I\r\nwould be delighted to look on when a powerful fellow, using force, magna\r\nmentula præditus me præsente puellam futuat; mihi persuasum est, fore ut\r\nhoc aspectu sensus mei vehementissima perturbatione afficiantur et dum\r\nfutuit corpus adolescentis pulchri tangam et, si liceat, ascendam in eum\r\ndum cum puella concumbit atque idem cum eo faciam et membrum meum in\r\nejus anum immittam. The accomplishment of these cynical ideas—with which\r\nmy mind is often filled—is hindered only by my limited means; otherwise,\r\nI should long ago have had the reality.\r\n\r\n“Soldiers have the greatest charm for me, but I have also a weakness for\r\nbutchers, fakirs, drivers, circus-riders, and boat-captains; and all\r\nthese must be supple and powerfully built. Urnings I hate in intimate\r\nrelation, and for the majority of them I have an inexplicable and unjust\r\naversion. I have never had but one urning for an intimate friend. On the\r\nother hand, the most affectionate and enduring ties bind me to men of my\r\nown age, in whose company I delight, but with whom I have no sexual\r\nrelations, and who have no idea of my condition.\r\n\r\n“Talk on politics and economics, like every other earnest subject, I\r\nhate; though I gossip with considerable sense and peculiar pleasure\r\nabout the theatre. At operas I see myself on the stage, feel myself\r\napplauded by the public, and would prefer to sing as a passive heroine,\r\nor in the dramatic _rôle_ of a woman.\r\n\r\n“The most interesting subject of conversation for me, and those like me,\r\nis, however, always—men; for us this is inexhaustible. Their secret\r\ncharms are described in the most minute details, mentulæ æstimantur,\r\nquanta sint magnitudine, quanta, crassitudine; de forma earum atque\r\nrigiditate conferimus, alter ab altero cognoscit cujus semen celerius,\r\ncujus tardius ejaculetur. I may add that, of my four brothers, one gave\r\nhimself to the service of urnings, without himself being one; and all\r\nfour are ladies’ men, and indulge in sexual excesses. The genitals of\r\nthe men of our family are, without exception, unusually developed.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, I repeat the words with which I began these lines. I\r\ncould not choose my expressions, because my object in the foregoing has\r\nbeen to afford material for the study of the urning’s existence, and\r\nabsolute truth was essential. I beg the numerous cynics to keep this\r\ncircumstance in mind.”\r\n\r\nIn October, 1890, the writer of the foregoing lines presented himself to\r\nme. In all essentials his appearance corresponded with his description.\r\nGenitals large, with abundant growth of hair. His parents had been well\r\nnervously. One brother had shot himself on account of nervous trouble;\r\nthree others were intensely nervous. The patient came to me in a state\r\nof despair. He could not endure such a life any longer; for he had been\r\nadmonished about intercourse with men that could be bought; and with his\r\nextreme sensual nature he was unable to abstain. Too, he could not\r\nunderstand how he could be made to love women, and enjoy the nobler joys\r\nof life. He had had love for men since his thirteenth year.\r\n\r\nHe felt in all respects like a woman, and longed to be won by men that\r\nwere not urnings. When he was with an urning, it was just as if two\r\ngirls were together. He would prefer being sexless to living longer as\r\nhe was. Would not castration help him?\r\n\r\nAn attempt at hypnosis with the highly excited patient induced only a\r\nvery slight degree of lethargy.\r\n\r\nCase 124. B., waiter, aged 42, single, was sent to me by his physician,\r\nwith whom he was in love, as one who was suffering from contrary sexual\r\nfeeling. B. very willingly, and in a decent manner, gave a history of\r\nhis past life, especially of his sexual life, and was glad at least to\r\nhave an authoritative opinion concerning his sexual condition, which had\r\nalways appeared to him abnormal.\r\n\r\nB. knew nothing to report of his grandparents. His father had been a\r\npassionate, excitable man, a drinker, and always very sensual. After he\r\nhad begotten twenty-four children by one wife, he was divorced from her;\r\nand after that his landlady became three times pregnant by him. His\r\nmother was healthy.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-three children, but six were living; several were nervous,\r\nbut not sexually abnormal, with the exception of one sister, who always\r\nsought men.\r\n\r\nB. asserts that from childhood he was sickly. At eight his sexual life\r\nbegan. He masturbated, and became possessed of the idea penem aliorum\r\npuerorum in os arrigere, which gave him the greatest pleasure. At twelve\r\nhe began to fall in love with men, usually with those between thirty and\r\nforty, with moustaches. Even at that time his sexual desire was greatly\r\ndeveloped, and he had erections and pollutions. From that time, indeed,\r\nhe masturbated daily, and during the act thought of a beloved man. Yet\r\nhis greatest delight had been penem viri in os arrigere. During the act\r\nhe had ejaculation, with an intense feeling of pleasure. Only about\r\ntwelve times had he had this pleasure. He had never felt disgust with\r\nthe penis of another sympathetic man; quite the contrary. He had never\r\naccepted proffers of pederasty; actively or passively, it was very\r\ndisgusting to him. In the perverse sexual act he had always thought of\r\nhimself in the _rôle_ of a woman. His passion for men in sympathy with\r\nhim had been unbounded. He would have done everything for a lover; even\r\nat the sight of him he would tremble with excitement and joy.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen he often allowed himself to be taken by his comrades to\r\nhouses of prostitution. He never had pleasure in coitus, and only in the\r\nmoment of ejaculation felt satisfaction. In order to get an erection\r\nwith a woman, it was always necessary, in the act, for him to think of a\r\nbeloved man. He would always have preferred to have the woman allow\r\nimmissio penis in os, which, however, was always denied him. _Faute de\r\nmieux_, he had practiced coitus, and, indeed, twice became a father. The\r\nlast child, a girl of eight, had already begun to practice masturbation\r\nand mutual onanism, which troubled him very much as a father. He wished\r\nto know whether there was any remedy for it.\r\n\r\nThe patient asserted that he always felt himself toward men in a\r\nfeminine _rôle_ (also in sexual intercourse). He had always thought that\r\nhis sexual perversion had resulted from his father’s wishing to beget a\r\ngirl when he begat him. His brothers and sisters had always joked him on\r\naccount of his feminine manners. Sweeping and house-cleaning had always\r\nbeen pleasant occupations for him. His activities in this direction had\r\noften been wondered at, and he was considered more skillful than a girl.\r\nWhenever he could, he dressed like a woman. At the carnival he appeared\r\nat the dances masked as a female. He was very successful at coquetry on\r\nsuch occasions, because he had a feminine nature.\r\n\r\nHe had never had real pleasure in drinking, smoking, or in masculine\r\noccupations or pleasures; but, on the other hand, he loved to sew, and\r\nas a child had often been scolded for his playing with dolls. His\r\ninterest at the circus or theatre was confined to men. Frequently he\r\ncould not overcome the impulse to hang around water-closets, in order to\r\nget sight of male genitals.\r\n\r\nFeminine charms had never pleased him. Coitus had been possible only\r\nwhen he thought of a beloved man. Nocturnal pollutions were always\r\ninduced by lascivious dreams of men.\r\n\r\nIn spite of much sexual excess, B. had never suffered from neurasthenia\r\nsexualis, and, besides, there was not a symptom of neurasthenia\r\ndiscoverable in him.\r\n\r\nPatient is delicate, and his whiskers and moustache, which made their\r\nappearance in his twenty-eighth year, are thin. Externally, with the\r\nexception of a weaving gait, he presents nothing which would point to\r\nhis feminine nature. He asserts that he has often been joked about his\r\nfeminine gait. His conduct is in all respects decent. His genitals are\r\nlarge, well developed, and normal in all respects, and the growth of\r\ngenital hair is abundant; the pelvis is masculine. The head is rachitic,\r\nsomewhat hydrocephalic, with prominence of the parietal bones. The face\r\nis remarkably small. The patient says that he is irritable and easily\r\nangered.\r\n\r\nCase 125. On May 1, 1880, G., Ph.D., and a writer, was brought to the\r\nclinic for mental diseases, at Graz, by the public authorities. While on\r\nhis return from Italy, G. found a soldier in Graz who gave himself up to\r\nhim for hire, but ultimately denounced G. to the police, because G. had\r\nopenly confessed his love for men. The authorities considered his mental\r\ncondition doubtful, and sent him to alienists for examination. To the\r\nphysicians G. related, with cynical openness, that years before, in M.,\r\nhe had had just such an affair with the police, and was in prison\r\nfourteen days. In the South there was no danger from such people; it was\r\nonly in Germany and Austria that the thing was regarded as an evil.\r\n\r\nG. is fifty years old, tall, powerful, and has a humerous expression,\r\nand a cynical, coquettish manner; the eye has a neuropathic, swimming\r\nexpression; the teeth of the under jaw stand far back from those of the\r\nupper jaw. The cranium is normal, the voice masculine, and the beard\r\nabundant. The genitals are well formed, though the testicles are\r\nsomewhat small. With the exception of slight emphysema of the lungs and\r\nexternal fistula in ano, there are no remarkable anomalies of the\r\nvegetative organs. G.’s father was subject to periodical insanity. His\r\nmother was a high-strung person, and she had an insane sister. Of the\r\nchildren, four died in childhood.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of scrofulosis, G. asserts that he was healthy. He\r\nobtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; at twenty-five, he had\r\nhæmoptysis, and went to Italy, where he has since lived, with slight\r\ninterruption, by writing and by giving private lessons. G. says that he\r\noften has congestions, and also some spinal irritation,—_i.e._, pain in\r\nhis back,—but otherwise he has a genial disposition; only he is not much\r\nof a financier; and at the same time, like all old prostitutes, he has a\r\nvery good appetite. Further, he states, with great satisfaction and\r\nremarkable cynicism, that he has congenital contrary sexual instinct.\r\nWhen only five years old, it was his greatest pleasure to get sight of a\r\npenis, and he hung about appropriate places, in order to enjoy that\r\npleasure. Even before puberty he practiced masturbation. At the time of\r\npuberty he noticed an inward feeling for friends. An obscure impulse\r\npointed out to him the way his love would take. He was actually impelled\r\nto kiss young men, and now and then to caress their genitals. When\r\ntwenty-six years old, he first began to have sexual intercourse with\r\nmen, toward whom he felt like a woman. Even as a child, it was his\r\ngreatest delight to put on female attire. He was often chastised by his\r\nfather because, in the effort to satisfy this impulse, he put on his\r\nsister’s clothing. If he happened to see a _ballet_, only the male\r\ndancers interested him. Since he could remember, he had had a horror\r\nfeminæ. If he happened to visit a brothel, it was only to see young men.\r\nHe was, indeed, a rival of prostitutes. If he saw a young man, he just\r\nlooked at his eyes; in case these pleased him, then came the\r\nmouth—whether it was well formed for kissing; then he would look at the\r\ngenitals—whether they were well developed. G. pointed, with great\r\nfeeling of self-satisfaction, to his poetical works, and tried to make\r\nit appear that persons with natures like his were poetically endowed. He\r\ngave as examples Voltaire, Frederick the Great, Eugene of Savoy, and\r\nPlato, as well as numerous distinguished men of the present, who,\r\naccording to his opinion, were urnings. His greatest pleasure was to\r\nhave a sympathetic young man read his verses to him. During the last\r\nsummer he had had such a lover. When he had to part with him, he was\r\nquite undone, and he did not eat or sleep until gradually he had\r\nregained his former condition. He said that the love of urnings was a\r\npassionate, inner fire. According to his statement, in Naples the\r\n_effeminelli_ lived in a quarter together, just as in Paris the\r\n_grisettes_ live with their lovers. They sacrifice themselves for their\r\nlovers, and care for the household, just as the grisettes do. On the\r\nother hand, an urning repels an urning, “just as one prostitute does\r\nanother—that is the curse.”\r\n\r\nThe need of intercourse with males occurs about once a week with G. He\r\nis happy in his peculiar sexuality, which he, it is true, considers\r\npeculiar, but which he will not regard as abnormal or wrong. He thinks\r\nthat nothing remains for him and those like him but to raise what is\r\nunnatural in themselves to the supernatural. He looks upon the love of\r\nurnings as the higher, the ideal, as godlike, an abstract love. When\r\nshown that such a love is far from the purpose of Nature and the\r\npreservation of the race, he expresses the pessimistic thought that the\r\nworld should die out, and the earth turn round its axis without men, who\r\nwere on it only for trouble. As reason and explanation of his unnatural\r\nsexual feeling, G. refers to Plato, “who certainly was no beast.” Plato\r\nexpressed allegorically the idea that men were originally balls. The\r\ngods had divided these into two hemispheres. For the most part, man is\r\nsuited to woman, but sometimes man to man. In the latter case, the\r\nimpulse to union is quite as powerful as in the former, and they\r\nstrengthen each other in the same way. G. further relates that his\r\ndreams, when they were erotic, never had women, but only men, for their\r\nsubjects. Male-love was the only kind that could satisfy him. He\r\nconsidered it disgusting for one human being to be prodding about in the\r\nabdomen of another with his penis, since he had heard that in this\r\ndisgusting fashion coitus was usually carried out. He had never had the\r\ncuriosity to inform himself concerning the female genitals; the subject\r\nwas disgusting to him. The indulgence of his sexual appetite he did not\r\nconsider a vice, but the result of a natural impulse which compelled him\r\nto it. It conduced to self-preservation. Onanism was a poor substitute,\r\nand, moreover, injurious, while urning-love was morally elevating and\r\nconducive to physical well-being.\r\n\r\nWith moral indignation, which in contrast with his cynicism in other\r\ndirections appeared ridiculous, he protested against the classification\r\nof urnings with those who indulged in pederasty. He looked on the podex\r\nwith disgust, as it was a secreting organ. The intercourse of urnings\r\nalways took place in front, and was combined onanism.\r\n\r\nThis was the extent of G.’s disclosures, whose mental condition was\r\ncertainly congenitally abnormal. As proof of this, may be cited his\r\ncynicism; his incredible frivolity in his application of his vices to\r\nreligion, in which direction we cannot follow him without overstepping\r\nthe bounds set by scientific inquiry; his perverse philosophical ideas\r\nwith reference to his sexual perversion; his perverse manner of looking\r\nat the world; his ethical defect in all directions; his vagabondage; and\r\nhis perverse mind and exterior. G. makes the impression of an original\r\nparanoiac. (Personal case. _Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie._)\r\n\r\nCase 126. Taylor had occasion to examine a certain Eliza Edwards, aged\r\n24. It was discovered that she was of masculine sex. E. had worn female\r\nclothing from her fourteenth year, and also been an actress. The hair\r\nwas worn long after the manner of females, and parted in the middle. The\r\nform of the face was feminine, but otherwise the body was masculine. The\r\nbeard was carefully pulled out. The masculine, well-developed genitals\r\nwere fixed in an upward position by an artful bandage. The condition of\r\nthe anus indicated passive pederasty.\r\n\r\nCase 127. An official of middle age, who for some years had been happy\r\nin family life, and was married to a virtuous woman, presented a\r\npeculiar manifestation of contrary sexual feeling.\r\n\r\nOne day, through the indiscretion of a prostitute, the following scandal\r\nbecame public: About once a week X. would appear in a house of\r\nprostitution, and there dress himself up as a woman, always requiring,\r\nas a part of his costume, a coiffure. When his toilet was completed, he\r\nwould lie down on the bed, and have the prostitute perform\r\nmanustupration. But he very much preferred to have a male person (a\r\nservant of the house). This man’s father was hereditarily tainted, had\r\nbeen insane several times, and was afflicted with hyperæsthesia and\r\nparæsthesia sexualis.\r\n\r\nCase 128. C. R., maid-servant, aged 26, suffered from the time of her\r\ndevelopment with original paranoia and hysteria. As a result of her\r\ndelusions, her life had been somewhat romantic, and in 1884, in\r\nSwitzerland, where she had gone as a result of delusions of persecution,\r\nshe came under the observation of the authorities. On this occasion, it\r\nwas ascertained that R. was affected with contrary sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nConcerning her parents and relatives there is no information at hand. R.\r\nasserted that, with the exception of an inflammation of the lungs at the\r\nage of sixteen, she had never been severely ill.\r\n\r\nFirst menstruation at fifteen, without any difficulties; thereafter it\r\nwas very often irregular and abnormally excessive. The patient declared\r\nthat she never had had inclinations toward the opposite sex, and had\r\nnever allowed the approach of a man. She never could understand how her\r\nfriends could describe the beauty and amiability of men. But it was\r\ncharming and inspiring for her to imprint a kiss on the lips of a\r\nbeloved female friend. She had a love for girls that was\r\nincomprehensible to her. She had passionately loved and kissed some of\r\nher female friends, and she would have given up her life for them. Her\r\ngreatest delight would have been to have constantly lived with such a\r\nfriend and absolutely possessed her.\r\n\r\nIn this she felt toward the beloved girl like a man. Even as a little\r\nchild, she had an inclination only for the play of boys, and she loved\r\nto hear shooting and military music, was always much excited by them,\r\nand would gladly have gone as a soldier. The chase and war have been her\r\nideals. In the theatre only feminine performers interested her. She knew\r\nvery well that the whole of this inclination was unwomanly, but she\r\ncould not help it. It had always been a great pleasure for her to go\r\nabout in male clothing, and in the same way she had always preferred\r\nmasculine work, and had shown unusual skill in it; while with reference\r\nto feminine occupations, especially handiwork, she had to say the\r\ncontrary. The patient had also a weakness for smoking and spirits. On\r\naccount of persecutory delusions, in order to rid herself of her\r\npersecutions, the patient had often gone about in male attire, and\r\nplayed the part of a man. She did this with such (congenital) skill\r\nthat, as a rule, she was able to deceive people concerning her sex.\r\n\r\nIt is authoritatively established that in 1884, for a long time, the\r\npatient went about in male attire, now in the garments of a civilian,\r\nnow in the uniform of a lieutenant; and in August of the same year,\r\ndressed as a male servant, she fled to Switzerland as a result of\r\ndelusions of persecution. There she found service in a merchant’s\r\nfamily, and fell in love with the daughter of the house, “the beautiful\r\nAnna,” who, on her side, not recognizing the sex of R., fell in love\r\nwith the handsome young man.\r\n\r\nConcerning this episode the patient makes the following characteristic\r\nstatement: “I was madly in love with Anna. I don’t know how it came\r\nabout, and I cannot put myself right concerning this impulse. In this\r\nfatal love lies the reason why I played the _rôle_ of a man so long. I\r\nhave never yet felt any love for a man, and I believe that my love is\r\nfor the female and not the male sex. I can in nowise understand my\r\ncondition.”\r\n\r\nFrom Switzerland R. wrote letters home to her friend, Amelia, which were\r\nproduced at the examination. They are letters showing passionate love,\r\nwhich goes beyond the bounds of friendship. She apostrophizes her\r\nfriend, “My flower, sun of my heart, longing of my soul.” She was her\r\ngreatest happiness on earth; her heart was hers. And in her letters to\r\nher friend’s parents she wrote: “You, too, should watch your flower,\r\nfor, if she should die, you also would be unable to endure life.”\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of investigating her mental condition, R. remained for\r\nsome time in an asylum. On one occasion, when Anna was allowed to pay R.\r\na visit, there was no end of passionate embraces and kisses. The visitor\r\nacknowledged freely that they had before secretly embraced and kissed in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nR. is a tall, slim, stately person, of feminine form in all respects,\r\nbut with masculine features. Cranium regular; no anatomical signs of\r\ndegeneration. Genitals normal and indicative of virginity. All the\r\ncircumstances indicate that she has only indulged in platonic love.\r\nGlance and appearance are indicative of a neuropathic person. Severe\r\nhysteria, occasional cataleptoid attacks, with visionary and delirious\r\nstates. The patient is very easily brought into a state of somnambulism\r\nby hypnotic influence, and in this condition is susceptible to all\r\npossible suggestions. (Personal case. _Friedreich’s Blätter_, 1886, Heft\r\n1.)\r\n\r\n4. _Androgyny and Gynandry._—Forming direct transitions from the\r\nforegoing groups are those individuals of contrary sexuality in whom not\r\nonly the character and all the feelings are in accord with the abnormal\r\nsexual instinct, but also the skeletal form, the features, voice, etc.;\r\nso that the individual approaches the opposite sex anthropologically,\r\nand in more than a psychical and psycho-sexual way. This anthropological\r\nform of the cerebral anomaly apparently represents a very high degree of\r\ndegeneration; but that this variation is based on an entirely different\r\nground than the teratological manifestation of hermaphroditism, in an\r\nanatomical sense, is clearly shown by the fact that thus far, in the\r\ndomain of contrary sexuality, no transitions to hermaphroditic\r\nmalformation of the genitals have been observed. The genitals of these\r\npersons always prove to be fully differentiated sexually, though not\r\ninfrequently there are present anatomical signs of degeneration\r\n(epispadiasis, etc.), in the sense of arrests of development in organs\r\nthat are otherwise well differentiated.\r\n\r\nThere is yet wanting a sufficient record of cases belonging to this\r\ninteresting group of women in masculine attire with masculine genitals,\r\nand men in feminine dress with the sexual organs of the female. Every\r\nexperienced observer of his fellow-men remembers masculine persons that\r\nwere very remarkable for their womanish character and type (wide hips,\r\nform rounded by abundant development of adipose tissue, absence or\r\ninsufficient development of beard, feminine features, delicate\r\ncomplexion, falsetto voice, etc.); and, on the other hand, women that,\r\nby reason of build, pelvis, gait, attitude, heavy and decidedly\r\nmasculine features, rough and deep voice, etc., had little to remind one\r\nof femininity.\r\n\r\nWe have already met some indications of such an anthropological\r\ntransformation in foregoing groups, as in Case 106, where the woman had\r\nthe feet of a man; and in Case 112, where there was development of mammæ\r\nand production of milk during puberty.\r\n\r\nIn persons belonging to the fourth group, and in certain ones in the\r\nthird, forming transitions to the fourth, there seems to be a feeling of\r\nshame (sexual) toward persons of the same sex, and not toward those of\r\nthe opposite sex.\r\n\r\n  Case 129. _Androgyny._ Mr. v. H., aged 30, single; of neuropathic\r\n  mother. Nervous and mental diseases are said not to have occurred in\r\n  the patient’s family, and his only brother is said to be mentally and\r\n  physically completely normal. The patient developed tardily\r\n  physically, and, therefore, spent much of his time at the sea-shore\r\n  and climatic resorts. From childhood he was of neuropathic\r\n  constitution, and, according to the statements of his relatives,\r\n  unlike other boys. His disinclination for masculine pursuits and his\r\n  preference for feminine amusements were early remarked. Thus he\r\n  avoided all boyish games and gymnastic exercises, while doll-play and\r\n  feminine occupations were particularly pleasing to him. Thereafter he\r\n  developed well physically, and escaped severe illnesses, but he\r\n  remained mentally abnormal, incapable of an earnest aim in life, and\r\n  decidedly feminine in thought and feeling.\r\n\r\n  In his seventeenth year pollutions occurred, became more frequent, and\r\n  finally took place during the day; so that the patient grew weak, and\r\n  manifested various nervous disturbances. Symptoms of neurasthenia\r\n  spinalis made their appearance, and have lasted up to the last few\r\n  years, but they have become milder with the decrease in the number of\r\n  pollutions. Onanism is denied, but is very probable. An indolent,\r\n  effeminate, dreamy habit of thought has become more and more\r\n  noticeable ever since puberty. All efforts to induce the patient to\r\n  take up an earnest pursuit in life were vain. His intellectual\r\n  functions, though formally quite undisturbed, were never equal to the\r\n  motive of an independent character, and the higher ideals of life. He\r\n  remained dependent, an overgrown child; and nothing more clearly\r\n  indicated his original abnormal condition than an actual incapability\r\n  to take care of money, and his own confession that he had no ability\r\n  to use money reasonably; that as soon as he had money he wasted it for\r\n  curios, toilet-articles, and the like.\r\n\r\n  Incapable as he was of a reasonable use of money, the patient was no\r\n  more capable of leading a social existence; indeed, he was incapable\r\n  of gaining an insight into its significance and value.\r\n\r\n  He learned very poorly, spending his time in _toilettes_ and artistic\r\n  nothings, particularly in painting, for which he evinced a certain\r\n  capability; but in this direction he accomplished nothing, since he\r\n  was wanting in perseverence. He could not be brought to take up any\r\n  earnest thought; he had a mind only for externals, was always\r\n  distracted, and serious things quickly wearied him. Preposterous acts,\r\n  senseless journeys, waste of money, and debts repeatedly occur\r\n  throughout the course of his later life; and even for these positive\r\n  faults in his life he was wanting in understanding. He was self-willed\r\n  and intractable, and never did well as soon as an attempt was made to\r\n  put him on his feet and point out to him his own interests.\r\n\r\n  With these manifestations of an original abnormal and defective mind,\r\n  there were notable indications of perverse sexual feeling, which were\r\n  also indicated in the somatic habitus of the patient. Sexually, the\r\n  patient felt like a woman toward men, and had inclinations toward\r\n  people of his own sex, with indifference, if not actual\r\n  disinclination, for females.\r\n\r\n  In his twenty-second year it is asserted that he had sexual\r\n  intercourse with women, and was able to perform the act of\r\n  cohabitation normally; but, partly on account of increase of\r\n  neurasthenic symptoms which was occasional after coitus, and partly on\r\n  account of fear of infection,—but really by reason of a want of\r\n  satisfaction,—he soon ceased to indulge in such intercourse.\r\n  Concerning his abnormal sexual condition, he is not quite clear; he is\r\n  conscious of an inclination toward the male sex, but confesses, only\r\n  in a shame-faced way, that he has certain pleasurable feelings of\r\n  friendship for masculine individuals, which, however, are not\r\n  accompanied by any sensual feelings. The female sex he does not\r\n  exactly abhor; he could even bring himself to marry a woman who could\r\n  have an attraction for him, by means of similarity in artistic tastes,\r\n  if he could but be freed from conjugal duties, which were unpleasant\r\n  to him, and the performance of which made him tired and weak. He\r\n  denied having had sexual intercourse with men, but his blushing and\r\n  embarrassment, and, still more, an occurrence in N., where the\r\n  patient, some time before, provoked a scandal by attempting to have\r\n  sexual intercourse with youths, gave him the lie.\r\n\r\n  Too, his external appearance, habitus, form, gestures, manners, and\r\n  dress are remarkable, and decidedly recall the feminine form and\r\n  characteristics. The patient, however, is over middle height, but\r\n  thorax and pelvis are decidedly of feminine form. The body is rich in\r\n  fat; the skin is well cared for, delicate, and soft. This impression\r\n  of a woman in masculine dress is further increased by a thin growth of\r\n  hair on the face, which is shaven, with the exception of a small\r\n  moustache; by the mincing gait; the shy, effeminate manner; the\r\n  feminine features; the swimming, neuropathic expression of the eyes;\r\n  the traces of powder and paint; the curtailed cut of the clothing,\r\n  with the bosom-like prominence of the upper garments; the fringed,\r\n  feminine cravat; and the hair brushed down smoothly from the brow to\r\n  the temples. The physical examination makes undoubted the feminine\r\n  form of the body. The external genitals are well developed, though the\r\n  left testicle has remained in the canal; the growth of hair on the\r\n  mons veneris is thin, and the latter is unusually rich in fat and\r\n  prominent. The voice is high, and without masculine timbre.\r\n\r\n  Too, the occupation and manner of thought of v. H. are decidedly\r\n  feminine. He has a boudoir and a well-supplied toilet-table, with\r\n  which he spends many hours in all kinds of arts for beautifying\r\n  himself. He abhors the chase, practice with arms, and such masculine\r\n  pursuits, and calls himself an _æsthete_; speaks with preference of\r\n  his paintings and attempts at poetry. He is interested in feminine\r\n  occupations, which—_e.g._, embroidery—he engages in, and calls his\r\n  greatest pleasure. He could spend his life in an artistic and æsthetic\r\n  circle of ladies and gentlemen, in conversation, music, and æsthetics.\r\n  His conversation is preferably about feminine things,—fashions,\r\n  needlework, cooking, and household work.\r\n\r\n  The patient is well nourished, but anæmic. He is of neuropathic\r\n  constitution, and presents symptoms of neurasthenia, which are\r\n  maintained by a bad manner of life, lying abed, living in-doors, and\r\n  effeminateness. He complains of occasional pain and pressure in the\r\n  head, and habitual obstipation. He is easily frightened; complains of\r\n  occasional lassitude and fatigue, and drawing pains in the\r\n  extremities, in the direction of the lumbo-abdominal nerves. After\r\n  pollutions, and regularly after eating, he feels tired and relaxed; he\r\n  is sensitive to pressure over the spinous processes of the dorsal\r\n  vertebræ, as also to pressure along accessible nerves. He feels\r\n  peculiar sympathies and antipathies for certain persons, and, when he\r\n  meets people for whom he has an antipathy, he falls into a condition\r\n  of peculiar fear and confusion. His pollutions, though now they occur\r\n  but seldom, are pathological, in that they occur by day, and are\r\n  unaccompanied by any sensual excitement.\r\n\r\n  _Opinion:_ 1. Mr. v. H., according to all observations and reports, is\r\n  mentally an abnormal and defective person, and that, in fact, _ab\r\n  origine_. His contrary sexual instinct represents a part of his\r\n  abnormal physical and mental condition.\r\n\r\n  2. This condition, in that it is congenital, is incurable. There\r\n  exists defective organization of the highest cerebral centres, which\r\n  renders him incapable of leading an independent life, and of obtaining\r\n  a position in life. His perverse sexual instinct prevents him from\r\n  exercising normal sexual functions; and this is attended by all the\r\n  social consequences of such an anomaly, and the danger of satisfaction\r\n  of perverse impulses arising out of his abnormal organization, with\r\n  consequent social and legal conflicts. Fear of the latter, however,\r\n  cannot be great, since the (perverse) sexual impulse of the patient is\r\n  weak.\r\n\r\n  3. Mr. v. H., in the legal sense of the word, is not irresponsible,\r\n  and neither fit for, or in need of, treatment in a hospital for the\r\n  insane. It is possible for him—though but an overgrown child, and\r\n  incapable of personal independence—to live in society, though under\r\n  the care and guidance of normal individuals. Too, to a certain extent,\r\n  it is possible for him to respect the laws and restrictions of\r\n  society, and to judge his own acts; but, with respect of possible\r\n  sexual errors and conflicts with criminal laws, it must be emphasized\r\n  that his sexual instinct is abnormal, having its origin in organic\r\n  pathological conditions; and this circumstance should eventually be\r\n  used in his favor. On account of his notorious lack of independence,\r\n  he cannot be discharged from parental care or guardianship, inasmuch\r\n  as otherwise he would be ruined financially.\r\n\r\n  4. Mr. v. H. is also physically ill. He presents signs of slight\r\n  anæmia and of neurasthenia spinalis. A rational regulation of his\r\n  manner of life and a tonic regimen, and, if possible,\r\n  hydro-therapeutic treatment, seem necessary. The suspicion that this\r\n  trouble has its origin in early masturbation should be entertained,\r\n  and the possibility of the existence of spermatorrhœa, that is of\r\n  importance etiologically and therapeutically, lies near. (Personal\r\n  case. _Zeitschr. f. Psychiatrie._)\r\n\r\n  Case 130. Miss X., aged 38, consulted me, late in the fall of 1881, on\r\n  account of severe spinal irritation and obstinate sleeplessness, in\r\n  combating which she had become addicted to morphine and chloral. Her\r\n  mother and sister were nervous sufferers, but the rest of the family\r\n  were healthy. The trouble dated from a fall on her back in 1872, at\r\n  which time the patient was terribly frightened, though, when a girl,\r\n  she had been subject to muscular cramps and hysterical symptoms.\r\n  Following this shock, a neurasthenic and hysterical neurosis\r\n  developed, with predominating spinal irritation and sleeplessness.\r\n  Episodically, hysterical paraplegia, lasting as long as eight months,\r\n  and hysterical hallucinatory delirium, with convulsive attacks,\r\n  occurred. In the course of this, symptoms of morphinism were added. A\r\n  stay of some months in the hospital relieved the latter, and\r\n  considerably improved the neurasthenic neurosis, in the treatment of\r\n  which general faradization exerted a remarkably favorable influence.\r\n\r\n  Even at the first meeting, the patient produced a remarkable\r\n  impression by reason of her attire, features, and conduct. She wore a\r\n  gentleman’s hat, her hair closely cut, eye-glasses, a gentleman’s\r\n  cravat, a coat-like outer garment of masculine cut that reached well\r\n  down over her gown, and boots with high heels. She had coarse,\r\n  somewhat masculine features; a harsh, deep voice; and made rather the\r\n  impression of a man in female attire than that of a lady, if one but\r\n  overlooked the bosom and the decidedly feminine form of the pelvis.\r\n  During the long time that she was observed, there were never signs of\r\n  erotocism. When questioned concerning her attire, she would only\r\n  respond that the style she chose suited her better. Gradually it was\r\n  ascertained from her that, even when she was a small girl, she had had\r\n  a preference for horses and masculine pursuits, and never any interest\r\n  in feminine occupations. Later she developed a particular pleasure in\r\n  reading, and prepared herself to be a teacher. Dancing had never\r\n  pleased her; it had always seemed silly to her. Too, the _ballet_ had\r\n  never interested her. Her greatest pleasure had always been in the\r\n  circus. Until her sickness, in 1872, she had neither had inclination\r\n  for persons of the opposite nor for those of her own sex. From that\r\n  time she had, what was remarkable to herself, a peculiar friendship\r\n  for females, particularly for young ladies; and she had a desire, and\r\n  satisfied it, to wear hats and coats of masculine style. Since 1869,\r\n  besides, she had worn her hair short, and parted it on the side, as\r\n  men do. She asserts that she was never sensually excited in the\r\n  company of men, but that her friendship and self-sacrifice for\r\n  sympathetic ladies was unbounded; while from that time she also\r\n  experienced repugnance for gentlemen and their society.\r\n\r\n  Her relatives report that, before 1872, the patient had a proposal of\r\n  marriage, which she refused; and that when she returned from a sojourn\r\n  at a watering-place, in 1874, she was sexually changed, and\r\n  occasionally showed that she did not regard herself as a female.\r\n\r\n  Since that time she would associate only with ladies, and has had a\r\n  kind of love-relation with one or another, and made remarks which\r\n  indicated that she looked upon herself as a man. This predilection for\r\n  women was decidedly more than mere friendship, since it expressed\r\n  itself in tears, jealousy, etc.\r\n\r\n  When, in 1874, she was stopping at a watering-place, a young lady, who\r\n  took her for a man in disguise, fell in love with her. When this lady\r\n  married, later, the patient was for a long time depressed, and spoke\r\n  of unfaithfulness. Moreover, since her sickness, her relatives were\r\n  struck by her desire for masculine attire, her masculine conduct, and\r\n  disinclination for feminine pursuits; while previously, at least\r\n  sexually, she had presented nothing unusual.\r\n\r\n  Further investigations showed that the patient had a love-relation,\r\n  which was not purely platonic, with the lady described in Case 118;\r\n  and that she wrote her affectionate letters like those of a lover to\r\n  his beloved. In 1887 I again saw the patient in a sanitarium, where\r\n  she had been placed on account of hystero-epileptic attacks, spinal\r\n  irritation, and morphinism. The contrary sexual feeling existed\r\n  unchanged, and only by the most careful watching was the patient kept\r\n  from improper advances toward her fellow-patients.\r\n\r\n  Her condition remained quite unchanged until 1889. Then the patient\r\n  began to fail, and she died of “exhaustion,” in August, 1889. The\r\n  autopsy showed, in the vegetative organs, amyloid degeneration of the\r\n  kidneys, fibroma of the uterus, and cyst of the left ovary. The\r\n  frontal bone was much thickened, uneven on the inner surface, with\r\n  numerous exostoses; dura adherent to vault of cranium. Long diameter\r\n  of skull, 175 millimetres; lateral diameter, 148 millimetres; weight\r\n  of the œdematous, but not atrophied, brain, 1175 grammes. The meninges\r\n  delicate, easily removed. Cortex pale. Convolutions broad, not\r\n  numerous, regularly arranged. Nothing abnormal in cerebellum and great\r\n  ganglia.\r\n\r\n  Case 131. _Gynandry._[117] History: On November 4, 1889, the\r\n  step-father of a certain Count Sandor V. complained that the latter\r\n  had swindled him out of 800f., under the pretense of requiring a bond\r\n  as secretary of a stock company. It was ascertained that Sandor had\r\n  entered into matrimonial contracts and escaped from the nuptials in\r\n  the spring of 1889; and, more than this, that this ostensible Count\r\n  Sandor was no man at all, but a woman in male attire,—Sarolta\r\n  (Charlotte), Countess V.\r\n\r\n  S. was arrested, and, on account of deception and forgery of public\r\n  documents, brought to examination. At the first hearing S. confessed\r\n  that she was born on Sept. 6, 1866; that she was a female, Catholic,\r\n  single, and worked as an authoress under the name of Count Sandor V.\r\n\r\n  From the autobiography of this man-woman I have gleaned the following\r\n  remarkable facts that have been independently confirmed:—\r\n\r\n  S. comes of an ancient, noble, and highly-respected family of Hungary,\r\n  in which there have been eccentricity and family peculiarities. A\r\n  sister of the maternal grandmother was hysterical, a somnambulist, and\r\n  lay seventeen years in bed, on account of fancied paralysis. A second\r\n  great-aunt spent seven years in bed, on account of a fancied fatal\r\n  illness, and at the same time gave balls. A third had the whim that a\r\n  certain table in her _salon_ was bewitched. If anything were laid on\r\n  this table, she would become greatly excited and cry, “Bewitched!\r\n  bewitched!” and run with the object into a room which she called the\r\n  “Black Chamber,” and the key of which she never let out of her hands.\r\n  After the death of this lady, there were found in this chamber a\r\n  number of shawls, ornaments, bank-notes, etc. A fourth great-aunt,\r\n  during two years, did not leave her room, and neither washed herself\r\n  nor combed her hair; then she again made her appearance. All these\r\n  ladies were, nevertheless, intellectual, finely educated, and amiable.\r\n\r\n  S.’s mother was nervous, and could not bear the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n  From her father’s family it is said she had a trace too much. One line\r\n  of the family gave itself up almost entirely to spiritualism. Two\r\n  blood-relations on the father’s side shot themselves. The majority of\r\n  her male relatives are unusually talented; the females are decidedly\r\n  narrow and domestic. S.’s father had a high position, which, however,\r\n  on account of his eccentricity and extravagance (he wasted over a\r\n  million and a half), he lost.\r\n\r\n  Among many foolish things that her father encouraged in her was the\r\n  fact that he brought her up as a boy, called her Sandor, allowed her\r\n  to ride, drive, and hunt, admiring her muscular energy.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, this foolish father allowed his second son to go\r\n  about in female attire, and had him brought up as a girl. This farce\r\n  ceased in his fifteenth year, when the son was sent to a higher\r\n  school.\r\n\r\n  Sarolta-Sandor remained under her father’s influence till her twelfth\r\n  year, and then came under the care of her eccentric maternal\r\n  grandmother, in Dresden, by whom, when the masculine play became too\r\n  obvious, she was placed in an Institute, and made to wear female\r\n  attire.\r\n\r\n  At thirteen she had a love-relation with an English girl, to whom she\r\n  represented herself as a boy, and ran away with her.\r\n\r\n  Sarolta returned to her mother, who, however, could do nothing, and\r\n  was compelled to allow her daughter to again become Sandor, wear male\r\n  clothes, and, at least once a year, to fall in love with persons of\r\n  her own sex.\r\n\r\n  At the same time, S. received a careful education, and made long\r\n  journeys with her father,—of course, always as a young gentleman. She\r\n  early became independent, and visited _cafés_, even those of doubtful\r\n  character, and, indeed, boasted one day that in a brothel she had had\r\n  a girl sitting on each knee. S. was often intoxicated, had a passion\r\n  for masculine sports, and was a very skillful fencer.\r\n\r\n  She felt herself drawn particularly toward actresses, or others of\r\n  similar position, and, if possible, toward those who were not very\r\n  young. She asserts that she never had any inclination for a young man,\r\n  and that she has felt, from year to year, an increasing dislike for\r\n  young men.\r\n\r\n  “I preferred to go into the society of ladies with ugly, ill-favored\r\n  men, so that none of them could put me in the shade. If I noticed that\r\n  any of the men awakened the sympathies of the ladies, I felt jealous.\r\n  I preferred ladies who were bright and pretty; I could not endure them\r\n  if they were fat or much inclined toward men. It delighted me if the\r\n  passion of a lady was disclosed under a poetic veil. All immodesty in\r\n  a woman was disgusting to me. I had an indescribable aversion for\r\n  female attire,—indeed, for everything feminine,—but only in as far as\r\n  it concerned me; for, on the other hand, I was all enthusiasm for the\r\n  beautiful sex.”\r\n\r\n  During the last ten years S. had lived almost constantly away from her\r\n  relatives, in the guise of a man. She had had many _liaisons_ with\r\n  ladies, traveled much, spent much, and made debts.\r\n\r\n  At the same time, she carried on literary work, and was a valued\r\n  collaborator on two noted journals of the Capital.\r\n\r\n  Her passion for ladies was very changeable; constancy in love was\r\n  entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n  Only once did such a _liaison_ last three years. It was years before\r\n  that S., at Castle G., made the acquaintance of Emma E., who was ten\r\n  years older than herself. She fell in love with her, made a\r\n  marriage-contract with her, and they lived together, as man and wife,\r\n  for three years at the Capital.\r\n\r\n  A new love, which S. regarded as a fate, caused her to sever her\r\n  matrimonial relations with E. The latter would not have it so. Only\r\n  with the greatest sacrifice was S. able to purchase her freedom from\r\n  E., who, it is reported, still looks upon herself as a divorced wife,\r\n  and regards herself as the Countess V.! That S. also had the power to\r\n  excite passion in other women is shown by the fact that when she\r\n  (before her marriage with E.) had grown tired of a Miss D., after\r\n  having spent thousands of guldens on her, she was threatened with\r\n  shooting by D. if she should become untrue.\r\n\r\n  It was in the summer of 1887, while at a watering-place, that S. made\r\n  the acquaintance of a distinguished official’s family. Immediately she\r\n  fell in love with the daughter, Marie, and her love was returned.\r\n\r\n  Her mother and cousin tried in vain to break up this affair. During\r\n  the winter, the lovers corresponded zealously. In April, 1888, Count\r\n  S. paid her a visit, and in May, 1889, attained her wish; in that\r\n  Marie—who, in the meantime, had given up a position as teacher—became\r\n  her bride in the presence of a friend of her lover, the ceremony being\r\n  performed in an arbor, by a false priest, in Hungary. S., with her\r\n  friend, forged the marriage-certificate. The pair lived happily, and,\r\n  without the interference of the step-father, this false marriage,\r\n  probably, would have lasted much longer. It is remarkable that, during\r\n  the comparatively long existence of the relation, S. was able to\r\n  deceive completely the family of her bride with regard to her true\r\n  sex.\r\n\r\n  S. was a passionate smoker, and in all respects her tastes and\r\n  passions were masculine. Her letters and even legal documents reached\r\n  her under the address of “Count S.” She often spoke of having to\r\n  drill. From remarks of the father-in-law, it seems that S. (and she\r\n  afterward confessed it) knew how to imitate a scrotum with\r\n  handkerchiefs or gloves stuffed in the trousers. The father-in-law\r\n  also, on one occasion, noticed something like an erected member on his\r\n  future son-in-law (probably a priapus). She also occasionally remarked\r\n  that she was obliged to wear a suspensory bandage while riding. The\r\n  fact is, S. wore a bandage around the body, possibly as a means of\r\n  retaining a priapus.\r\n\r\n  Though S. often had herself shaved _pro forma_, the servants in the\r\n  hotel where she lived were convinced that she was a woman, because the\r\n  chambermaids found traces of menstrual blood on her linen (which S.\r\n  explained, however, as hæmorrhoidal); and, on the occasion of a bath\r\n  which S. was accustomed to take, they claimed to have convinced\r\n  themselves of her real sex by looking through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n  The family of Marie make it seem probable that she for a long time was\r\n  deceived with regard to the true sex of her false bridegroom. The\r\n  following passage in a letter from Marie to S., August 26, 1889,\r\n  speaks in favor of the incredible simplicity and innocence of this\r\n  unfortunate girl: “I don’t like children any more, but if I had a\r\n  little Bezerl or Patscherl by my Sandi,—ah, what happiness, Sandi\r\n  mine!”\r\n\r\n  A large number of manuscripts allow conclusions to be drawn concerning\r\n  S.’s mental individuality. The chirography possesses the character of\r\n  firmness and certainty. The characters are genuinely masculine. The\r\n  same peculiarities repeat themselves everywhere in their\r\n  contents,—wild, unbridled passion; hatred and resistance to all that\r\n  opposes the heart thirsting for love; poetical love, which is not\r\n  marred by one ignoble blot; enthusiasm for the beautiful and noble;\r\n  appreciation of science and the arts.\r\n\r\n  Her writings betray a wonderfully wide range of reading in classics of\r\n  all languages, in citations from poets and prose writers of all lands.\r\n  The evidence of those qualified to judge literary work shows that S.’s\r\n  poetical and literary ability is by no means small. The letters and\r\n  writings concerning the relation with Marie are psychologically worthy\r\n  of notice.\r\n\r\n  S. speaks of the happiness there was for her when by M.’s side, and\r\n  expresses boundless longing to see her beloved, if only for a moment.\r\n  After such a happiness, she could have but one wish,—to exchange her\r\n  cell for the grave. The bitterest thing was the knowledge that now\r\n  Marie, too, hated her. Hot tears, enough to drown herself in, she had\r\n  shed over her lost happiness. Whole quires of paper are given up to\r\n  the apotheosis of this love, and reminiscences of the time of the\r\n  first love and acquaintance.\r\n\r\n  S. complained of her heart, that would allow no reason to direct it;\r\n  she expressed emotions which were such as only could be felt,—not\r\n  simulated. Then, again, there were outbreaks of most silly passion,\r\n  with the declaration that she could not live without Marie. “Thy dear,\r\n  sweet voice; the voice whose tone perchance would raise me from the\r\n  dead; that has been for me like the warm breath of Paradise! Thy\r\n  presence alone were enough to alleviate my mental and moral anguish.\r\n  It was a magnetic stream; it was a peculiar power your being exercised\r\n  over mine, which I cannot quite define; and, therefore, I cling to\r\n  that ever-true definition: I love you because I love you. In the night\r\n  of sorrow I had but one star,—the star of Marie’s love. That star has\r\n  lost its light; now there remains but its shimmer,—the sweet, sad\r\n  memory which even lights with its soft ray the deepening night of\r\n  death,—a ray of hope.”\r\n\r\n  This writing ends with the apostrophe: “Gentlemen, you learned in the\r\n  law, psychologists and pathologists, do me justice! Love led me to\r\n  take the step I took; all my deeds were conditioned by it. God put it\r\n  in my heart.\r\n\r\n  “If He created me so, and not otherwise, am I then guilty; or is it\r\n  the eternal, incomprehensible way of fate? I relied on God, that one\r\n  day my emancipation would come; for my thought was only love itself,\r\n  which is the foundation, the guiding principle, of His teaching and\r\n  His kingdom.\r\n\r\n  “O God, Thou All-pitying, Almighty One! Thou seest my distress; Thou\r\n  knowest how I suffer. Incline Thyself to me; extend Thy helping hand\r\n  to me, deserted by all the world. Only God is just. How beautifully\r\n  does Victor Hugo describe this in his ‘Legendes du Siècle’! How sad do\r\n  Mendelssohn’s words sound to me: ‘Nightly in dreams I see thee’!”\r\n\r\n  Though S. knew that none of her writings reached her lover, she did\r\n  not grow tired writing of her pain and delight in love, in page after\r\n  page of deification of Marie. And to induce one more pure flood of\r\n  tears, on one still, clear summer evening, when the lake was aglow\r\n  with the setting sun like molten gold, and the bells of St. Anna and\r\n  Maria-Wörth, blending in harmonious melancholy, gave tidings of rest\r\n  and peace, she wrote: “For that poor soul, for this poor heart that\r\n  beat for thee till the last breath.”\r\n\r\n  _Personal Examination:_ The first meeting which the experts had with\r\n  S. was, in a measure, a time of embarrassment to both sides; for them,\r\n  because perhaps S.’s somewhat dazzling and forced masculine carriage\r\n  impressed them; for her, because she thought she was to be marked with\r\n  the stigma of moral insanity. She had a pleasant and intelligent face,\r\n  which, in spite of a certain delicacy of features and diminutiveness\r\n  of all its parts, gave a decidedly masculine impression, had it not\r\n  been for the absence of a moustache. It was even difficult for the\r\n  experts to realize that they were concerned with a woman, despite the\r\n  fact of female attire and constant association; while, on the other\r\n  hand, intercourse with the man Sandor was much more free, natural, and\r\n  apparently correct. The culprit also felt this. She immediately became\r\n  more open, more communicative, more free, as soon as she was treated\r\n  like a man.\r\n\r\n  In spite of her inclination for the female sex, which had been present\r\n  from her earliest years, she asserts that in her thirteenth year she\r\n  first felt a trace of sexual feeling, which expressed itself in\r\n  kisses, embraces, and caresses, with sensual pleasure, and this on the\r\n  occasion of her elopement with the red-haired English girl from the\r\n  Dresden Institute. At that time feminine forms exclusively appeared to\r\n  her in dream-pictures, and ever since, in sensual dreams, she has felt\r\n  herself in the situation of a man, and occasionally, also, at such\r\n  times, experienced ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  She knows nothing of solitary or mutual onanism. Such a thing seemed\r\n  very disgusting to her, and not conducive to manliness. She had, also,\r\n  never allowed herself to be touched ad genitalia by others, because it\r\n  would have revealed her great secret. The menses began at seventeen,\r\n  but were always scanty, and without pain. It was plain to be seen that\r\n  S. had a horror of speaking of menstruation; that it was a thing\r\n  repugnant to her masculine consciousness and feeling. She recognized\r\n  the abnormality of her sexual inclinations, but had no desire to have\r\n  them changed, since in this perverse feeling she felt both well and\r\n  happy. The idea of sexual intercourse with men disgusted her, and she\r\n  also thought it would be impossible.\r\n\r\n  Her modesty was so great that she would prefer to sleep among men\r\n  rather than among women. Thus, when it was necessary for her to answer\r\n  the calls of nature or to change her linen, it was necessary for her\r\n  to ask her companion in the cell to turn her face to the window, that\r\n  she might not see her.\r\n\r\n  When occasionally S. came in contact with this companion,—a woman from\r\n  the lower walks of life,—she experienced a sexual excitement that made\r\n  her blush. Indeed, without being asked, S. related that she was\r\n  overcome with actual fear when, in her cell, she was compelled to\r\n  force herself into the unusual female attire. Her only comfort was,\r\n  that she was at least allowed to keep a shirt. Remarkable, and what\r\n  also speaks for the significance of olfactory sensations in her vita\r\n  sexualis, is her statement that, on the occasions of Marie’s absence,\r\n  she had sought those places on which Marie’s head was accustomed to\r\n  repose, and smelled of them, in order to experience the delight of\r\n  inhaling the odor of her hair. Among women, those who are beautiful,\r\n  or voluptuous, or quite young do not particularly interest her. The\r\n  physical charms of women she makes subordinate. As by magnetic\r\n  attraction, she feels herself drawn to those between twenty-four and\r\n  thirty. She found her sexual satisfaction exclusively in corpora\r\n  feminæ (never in her own person), in the form of manustupration of the\r\n  beloved woman, or cunnilingus. Occasionally she availed herself of a\r\n  stocking stuffed with oakum as a _priapus_. These admissions were made\r\n  only unwillingly by S., and with apparent shame; just as in her\r\n  writings, immodesty or cynicism are never found.\r\n\r\n  She is religious, has a lively interest in all that is noble and\r\n  beautiful,—men excepted,—and is very sensitive to the opinion others\r\n  may entertain of her morality.\r\n\r\n  She deeply regrets that in her passion she made Marie unhappy, and\r\n  regards her sexual feelings as perverse, and such a love of one woman\r\n  for another, among normal individuals, as morally reprehensible. She\r\n  has great literary talent and an extraordinary memory. Her only\r\n  weakness is her great frivolity and her incapability to manage money\r\n  and property reasonably. But she is conscious of this weakness, and\r\n  does not care to talk about it.\r\n\r\n  She is 153 centimetres tall, of delicate skeleton, thin, but\r\n  remarkably muscular on the breast and thighs. Her gait in female\r\n  attire is awkward. Her movements are powerful, not unpleasing, though\r\n  they are somewhat masculine, and lacking in grace. She greets one with\r\n  a firm pressure of the hand. Her whole carriage is decided, firm, and\r\n  somewhat self-conscious. Her glance is intelligent; mien somewhat\r\n  diffident. Feet and hands remarkably small, having remained in an\r\n  infantile stage of development. Extensor surfaces of the extremities\r\n  remarkably well covered with hair, while there is not the slightest\r\n  trace of beard, in spite of all shaving experiments. The hips do not\r\n  correspond in any way with those of a female. Waist is wanting. The\r\n  pelvis is so slim, and so little prominent, that a line drawn from the\r\n  axilla to the corresponding knee is straight,—not curved inward by a\r\n  waist, or outward by the pelvis. The skull is slightly oxycephalic,\r\n  and in all its measurements falls below the average of the female\r\n  skull by at least one centimetre.\r\n\r\n  The circumference of the head is 52 centimetres; the occipital\r\n  half-circumference, 24 centimetres; the line from ear to ear, over the\r\n  vertex, 23 centimetres; the anterior half-circumference, 28.5\r\n  centimetres; the line from glabella to occiput, 30 centimetres; the\r\n  ear-chin line, 26.5 centimetres; long diameter, 17 centimetres;\r\n  greatest lateral diameter, 13 centimetres; diameter at auditory meati,\r\n  12 centimetres; zygomatic diameter, 11.2 centimetres. The upper jaw\r\n  projects strikingly, its alveolar process projecting beyond the under\r\n  jaw about 0.5 centimetre. The position of the teeth is not fully\r\n  normal; the right upper canine has not developed. Mouth remarkably\r\n  small. Ears prominent; lobes not differentiated, passing over into the\r\n  skin of the cheek. Hard palate narrow and high; voice rough and deep;\r\n  mammæ fairly developed, soft, and without secretion. Mons veneris\r\n  covered with thick, dark hair. Genitals completely feminine, without\r\n  trace of hermaphroditic appearance, but at the stage of development of\r\n  those of a ten-year-old girl. The labia majora touch each other almost\r\n  completely; labia minora have a cock’s-comb-like form, and project\r\n  under the labia majora. The clitoris is small, and very sensitive.\r\n  Frenulum delicate; perineum very narrow; introitus vaginæ narrow;\r\n  mucous membrane normal. Hymen wanting (probably congenitally);\r\n  likewise, the carunculæ myrtiformes. Vagina so narrow that the\r\n  insertion of a membrum virile would be impossible, and it is also very\r\n  sensitive; certainly coitus had not taken place. Uterus is felt,\r\n  through the rectum, to be about the size of a walnut, immovable, and\r\n  retroflected.\r\n\r\n  The pelvis appears generally narrowed (dwarf-pelvis), and of decidedly\r\n  masculine type. The distance between anterior superior spines is 22.5\r\n  centimetres (instead of 26.3 centimetres). Distance between the crests\r\n  of the ilii, 26.5 centimetres (instead of 29.3 centimetres); between\r\n  the trochanters, 27.7 centimetres (31); the external conjugate\r\n  diameter, 17.2 centimetres (19 to 20); therefore, presumably, the\r\n  internal conjugate would be 7.7 centimetres (10.8). On account of\r\n  narrowness of the pelvis, the direction of the thighs is not\r\n  convergent, as in a woman, but straight.\r\n\r\n  The opinion given showed that in S. there was a congenitally abnormal\r\n  inversion of the sexual instinct, which, indeed, expressed itself,\r\n  anthropologically, in anomalies of development of the body, depending\r\n  upon great hereditary taint; further, that the criminal acts of S. had\r\n  their foundation in her abnormal and irresistible sexuality.\r\n\r\n  S.’s characteristic expressions—“God put love in my heart. If He\r\n  created me so, and not otherwise, am I, then, guilty; or is it the\r\n  eternal, incomprehensible way of fate?”—are really justified.\r\n\r\n  The court granted pardon. The “countess in male attire,” as she was\r\n  called in the newspapers, returned to her home, and again gave herself\r\n  out as Count Sandor. Her only distress is her lost happiness with her\r\n  beloved Marie.\r\n\r\n  A married woman, in Brandon, Wisconsin, whose case is reported by Dr.\r\n  Kiernan (_The Medical Standard_, 1888, November and December), was\r\n  more fortunate. She eloped, in 1883, with a young girl, married her,\r\n  and lived with her as husband undisturbed.\r\n\r\n  An interesting “historical” example of androgyny is a case reported by\r\n  Spitzka (_Chicago Medical Review_, August 20, 1881). It was that of\r\n  Lord Cornbury, Governor of New York, who lived in the reign of Queen\r\n  Anne. He was apparently affected with moral insanity; was terribly\r\n  licentious, and, in spite of his high position, could not keep himself\r\n  from going about in the streets in female attire, coquetting with all\r\n  the allurements of a prostitute.\r\n\r\n  In a picture of him that has been preserved, his narrow brow,\r\n  asymmetrical face, feminine features, and sensual mouth at once\r\n  attract attention. It is certain that he never actually regarded\r\n  himself as a woman.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMoreover, in individuals afflicted with contrary sexual instinct, in\r\nthemselves, the perverse sexual feeling and inclination may be\r\ncomplicated with other perverse manifestations. Thus here, with\r\nreference to the activity of the instinct, there may be acts quite\r\nanalogous to acts indulged in by individuals in perverse satisfaction of\r\nthe instinct, but who, at the same time, have a natural inclination\r\ntoward persons of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nOwing to the circumstance that abnormally increased sexuality is almost\r\na regular accompaniment of contrary sexual feeling, acts of lustful\r\ncruelty in the satisfaction of libido are easily possible. A remarkable\r\nexample of this is the case of Zastrow (Casper-Liman, 7. Auflage, Bd. i,\r\np. 190; ii, p. 487), who bit one of his victims (a boy), tore his\r\nprepuce, slit the anus, and strangled the child.\r\n\r\n  Z. came of a psychopathic grandfather and melancholic mother. His\r\n  brother indulged in abnormal sexual pleasures, and committed suicide.\r\n\r\n  Z. was a congenital urning, and in habitus and occupation masculine.\r\n  There was phimosis. Mentally, he was a weak, perverse, unsocial man.\r\n  He had horror feminæ, and, in his dreams, he felt himself like a woman\r\n  toward a man. He was painfully conscious of his want of normal sexual\r\n  feeling and his perverse instinct, and sought satisfaction in mutual\r\n  onanism, with frequent desire for pederasty.\r\n\r\nSimilar sadistic feelings of this kind, in those afflicted with contrary\r\nsexual instinct, are found in some of the foregoing histories (comp.\r\nCases 107 and 108 of this edition, and Case 96 of the sixth edition).\r\nBut masochism also occurs (comp. Case 43, sixth edition; Cases 111 and\r\n114 of this edition; and Case 3, in the first edition of “Neue\r\nForschungen”).\r\n\r\n  As examples of perverse sexual satisfaction dependent on contrary\r\n  sexual instinct, may be mentioned the Greek, who, as Athenäus reports,\r\n  was in love with a statue of Cupid, and defiled it, in the temple of\r\n  Delphi; and besides the monstrous cases reported by Tardieu\r\n  (“Attentats,” p. 272), the terrible one reported by Lombroso (“L’uomo\r\n  delinquente,” p. 200), of a certain Artusio, who wounded a boy in the\r\n  abdomen, and abused him sexually _by means of the incisions_.\r\n\r\n  Cases 86, 110, and 111, also, show that fetichism may also occur with\r\n  contrary sexual instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, AND THERAPY OF CONTRARY SEXUAL INSTINCT.\r\n\r\nWhile up to this time contrary sexual instinct has had but an\r\nanthropological, clinical, and forensic interest for science, now, as a\r\nresult of the latest investigations, there is some thought of therapy in\r\nthis incurable condition, which so heavily burdens its victims,\r\nsocially, morally, and mentally.\r\n\r\nA preparatory step for the application of therapeutic measures is the\r\nexact differentiation of the acquired from the congenital cases; and\r\namong the latter, again, the assignment of the concrete case to its\r\nproper position in the categories that have been established\r\nempirically.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic differentiation of the acquired from the congenital\r\ncondition is made without difficulty in the early stages of the anomaly.\r\n\r\nIf sexual inversion has already taken place, then the history of the\r\ndevelopment of the case will throw light upon it.\r\n\r\nThe important decision, prognostically, as to whether the contrary\r\nsexual instinct is congenital or acquired, can only be made in such\r\ncases by means of the most minute details of the history.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the fact that contrary sexual instinct existed\r\nbefore indulgence in masturbation is of great importance with reference\r\nto deciding whether the anomaly is congenital or not. In this, however,\r\na difficulty arises, owing to the possibility of imperfect localization\r\nof past events (illusions of memory).\r\n\r\nFor the presumption of acquired contrary sexual instinct, it is\r\nimportant to prove the existence of hetero-sexual instinct before the\r\nbeginning of solitary or mutual onanism.\r\n\r\nIn general, the acquired cases are characterized in that:—\r\n\r\n1. The homo-sexual instinct appears secondarily, and always may be\r\nreferred to influences (masturbatic neurasthenia, mental) which\r\ndisturbed normal sexual satisfaction. It is, however, probable that\r\nhere, in spite of powerful sensual libido, the feeling and inclination\r\nfor the opposite sex are weak _ab origine_, especially in a spiritual\r\nand æsthetic sense.\r\n\r\n2. The homo-sexual instinct, as long as inversio sexualis has not taken\r\nplace, is looked upon, by the individual affected, as vicious and\r\nabnormal, and yielded to only _faute de mieux_.\r\n\r\n3. The hetero-sexual instinct long remains predominant, and the\r\nimpossibility of its satisfaction gives pain. It weakens in proportion\r\nas the homo-sexual feeling gains in strength.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in congenital cases (_a_) the homo-sexual instinct is\r\nthe one that occurs primarily, and becomes dominant in the vita\r\nsexualis. It appears as the natural manner of satisfaction, and also\r\ndominates the dream-life of the individual. (_b_) The hetero-sexual\r\ninstinct fails completely, or, if it should make its appearance during\r\nthe life of the individual (psycho-sexual hermaphroditism), it is still\r\nbut an episodical phenomenon which has no root in the mental\r\nconstitution of the individual, and is essentially but a means of\r\nsatisfaction of sexual desire.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of the above groups of congenital contrary sexuality\r\nfrom one another, and from the cases in which the anomaly is acquired,\r\nwill, after the foregoing, present no difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis of the cases of acquired contrary sexual instinct is, at\r\nall events, much more favorable than that of the congenital cases. In\r\nthe former, the occurrence of effemination—the mental inversion of the\r\nindividual, in the sense of perverse sexual feeling—is the limit beyond\r\nwhich there is no longer hope of benefit from therapy. In the congenital\r\ncases, the various categories established in this book form as many\r\nstages of psycho-sexual taint, and benefit is _probable_ only within the\r\ncategory of the psychical hermaphrodites, though _possible_ (_vide_ the\r\ncase of Schrenk-Notzing) in that of the urnings.\r\n\r\nThe prophylaxis of these conditions becomes thus the more important,—for\r\nthe congenital cases, prohibition of the reproduction of such\r\nunfortunates; for the acquired cases, protection from the injurious\r\ninfluences which experience teaches may lead to the fatal inversion of\r\nthe sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nNumerous predisposed individuals meet this sad fate, because parents and\r\nteachers have no suspicion of the danger which masturbation brings in\r\nits train to such children.\r\n\r\nIn many schools and academies masturbation and vice are actually\r\ncultivated. At present much too little attention is given to the mental\r\nand moral peculiarities of the pupils. If only the tasks are done,\r\nnothing more is asked. That many pupils are thus ruined in body and soul\r\nis never considered. In obedience to affected prudery, the vita sexualis\r\nis veiled from the developing youth, and not the slightest attention\r\ngiven to the excitations of his sexual instinct. How few family\r\nphysicians are ever called in, during the years of development of\r\nchildren, to give advice to their patients that are often so greatly\r\npredisposed!\r\n\r\nIt is thought that all must be left to Nature; in the meantime, Nature\r\nrises in her power, and leads the helpless, unprotected innocent into\r\ndangerous by-paths.\r\n\r\nA more detailed treatment of this prophylactic side of the subject is\r\nimpossible here.[118]\r\n\r\nTo parents and teachers, the experiences detailed in this work, and\r\nnumerous scientific works on masturbation, give suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe lines of treatment, when contrary sexual instinct exists, are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n1. Prevention of onanism, and removal of other influences injurious to\r\nthe vita sexualis.\r\n\r\n2. Cure of the neurosis (neurasthenia sexualis and universalis) arising\r\nout of the unhygienic conditions of the vita sexualis.\r\n\r\n3. Mental treatment, in the sense of combating homo-sexual, and\r\nencouraging hetero-sexual, feelings and impulses.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the treatment lies in fulfilling the third\r\nindication, particularly with reference to onanism.\r\n\r\nOnly in very few cases, where acquired contrary sexual instinct has not\r\nprogressed far, can the fulfillment of 1 and 2 be sufficient, as the\r\nfollowing case, fully reported by the author in the _Irrenfreund_, 1884,\r\nNo. 1, proves:—\r\n\r\n  Case 132. Count Z., aged 51, of psychopathic mother, was early sent to\r\n  a military school, and there was taught onanism. He developed well,\r\n  and had normal sexual feelings, but, as a result of masturbation, he\r\n  became somewhat neurasthenic in his seventeenth year. He enjoyed\r\n  intercourse with women, was married at twenty-five, but after a year\r\n  more became neurasthenic, and absolutely lost his inclination for\r\n  women. In its place came contrary sexual instinct. Involved in an\r\n  accusation for high treason, he was sent to prison for two years, and\r\n  then to Siberia for five years. In these seven years, under the\r\n  influence of continued masturbation, neurasthenia and contrary sexual\r\n  instinct constantly increased. With his freedom restored at the age of\r\n  thirty-five, the patient began to visit all kinds of health-resorts on\r\n  account of his great neurasthenia; and this has since been his\r\n  occupation. In all these years his abnormal sexual feeling has not\r\n  changed in any way. For the most part, he lived away from his wife,\r\n  whom, it is true, he esteemed for her mental qualities; though he\r\n  avoided her, as he did every other woman. His contrary sexual feeling\r\n  is purely platonic. “Friendship,” sweet embraces, and kisses sufficed\r\n  him. Pollutions, which occasionally occurred, were induced by\r\n  lascivious dreams which had for subject persons of his own sex. Also,\r\n  during the day, the most beautiful woman had no charm for him, while\r\n  simply the sight of handsome men induced erection and ejaculation.\r\n  Only athletes and male dancers in the circus and _ballet_ interested\r\n  him. At times of greater excitability, even masculine statues gave him\r\n  erections. Now and again he resumed his old vice of masturbation. This\r\n  man of æsthetic culture had a horror of pederasty.\r\n\r\n  He felt, always, that his perverse sexual feeling was something\r\n  abnormal, without, however, in his apparently much weakened libido and\r\n  virility, feeling unhappy.\r\n\r\n  The examination gave the usual findings of neurasthenia. Development,\r\n  manner, and attire presented nothing remarkable. Electrical massage\r\n  was unusually successful. After a few sittings the patient was\r\n  mentally and physically much better. After twenty sittings libido was\r\n  again awakened, not in the same way, but normally, as the patient had\r\n  felt until his twenty-fifth year. Lascivious dreams were concerned\r\n  only with women; and one day the patient joyfully gave the information\r\n  that he had had coitus, and that he had had the same natural feeling\r\n  in it that he had had twenty-six years before. He then began to live\r\n  with his wife again, and hoped that he was lastingly freed from\r\n  neurasthenia and contrary sexual instinct. His hope was fulfilled for\r\n  the six years during which I was able to keep the patient under\r\n  observation.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, physical treatment, even though it be re-inforced morally by\r\ngood advice with reference to the avoidance of masturbation, the\r\nrepression of homo-sexual feelings and impulses, and the encouragement\r\nof hetero-sexual desires, will not prove sufficient, even in cases of\r\nacquired contrary sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nHere a method of mental treatment—hypnotic suggestion—is all that can\r\nbring benefit.\r\n\r\nThe following case is interesting; and it is an example of successful\r\nauto-suggestion that gives encouragement for the milder forms of the\r\nanomaly:—\r\n\r\n  Case 133. _Autobiography of a Psychical Hermaphrodite. Successful\r\n  Struggle against Homo-sexual Inclinations made by the Patient\r\n  himself._—“My father once had a stroke, but has recovered save for\r\n  paralysis of the face. My mother was very anæmic and melancholic. Both\r\n  suffered severely with hæmorrhoids, and my father ascribed to this\r\n  trouble the lumbar pain with which he suffered from time to time after\r\n  his marriage.\r\n\r\n  “I am, if I may so express myself, a passive character. When a child,\r\n  I indulged in all kinds of fancies, religious as well as others. I\r\n  suffered with incontinence of urine, and it is said that in sleep I\r\n  handled my genitals, so that my father fastened my hands to the bed!\r\n  (I was then a mere child, and had not masturbated.) I was always very\r\n  shy and embarrassed in social intercourse. When about fourteen or\r\n  fifteen years old, I was seduced into onanism. The impulse and desire\r\n  for women, occurring in connection with the awakening sexual feeling,\r\n  were, in reality, only of a platonic nature; I was also without the\r\n  society of ladies. When about eighteen, I attempted to satisfy my\r\n  sexual desire in the natural way, more in obedience to a feeling of\r\n  curiosity than from inner longing. Since that time, without having\r\n  experienced any real inclination for women, as often as possible I\r\n  have satisfied my desire by means of sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n  “Soon after puberty I became very anæmic, and appeared much older than\r\n  I really was. Then came melancholic and peculiar ideas. It was a\r\n  delight to me to fancy myself humiliated in the extreme. It may be of\r\n  interest to add that, at that time, I was troubled with religious\r\n  doubts, and only later found the courage to rise above religions. I\r\n  fell in love with young men. At first I opposed these ideas; later\r\n  they became so powerful that I became a genuine urning. Women seemed\r\n  to me to be human beings of the second class. I was in a state of\r\n  despair. My sickened soul was filled with tædium vitæ and thoughts\r\n  inimical to humanity. One day I read: ‘What will it come to?’ And ere\r\n  I knew it, I was a socialist; but an ideal one. Life again had value\r\n  for me, for I had an ideal,—the joyous struggle for the social\r\n  elevation of the proletariat. This caused a powerful revolution in me.\r\n  As in my best years (from the age of sixteen to seventeen), I took\r\n  interest in art, particularly in dramatic art. I am, at the present\r\n  time, writing a play and a story, and I am occupied with the grandest\r\n  thoughts. I read a remark of Schlegel’s concerning Sophocles, who was\r\n  indebted to his physical exercise for his energy and creative power,\r\n  and to music for his artistic proportions. In another place I read:\r\n  ‘The dramatist must, above all things, be mentally intact.’ This\r\n  depressed me; for my contrary sexual feelings could not arise in a\r\n  perfectly normal mind.\r\n\r\n  “I thought of having myself treated hypnotically; but shame held me\r\n  back. Then I said to myself that I was a weakling, indeed, to have so\r\n  little confidence in myself, and began in earnest to combat my\r\n  abnormal desires. At the same time, I struggled against my nervousness\r\n  by leading the proper kind of a life. I rowed, fenced, and was much in\r\n  the open air; and I was delighted when, at last, I awoke and seemed to\r\n  be an entirely different man. When I thought of the time from my\r\n  twentieth to my twenty-sixth year, it seemed to me that, during those\r\n  years, a strange and depressive being had been dwelling within me.\r\n\r\n  “I was astonished that the handsomest rider or the trimmest waiter\r\n  excited in me almost no interest; even the muscular masons had no\r\n  effect on me. I was disgusted when I thought that, at one time, such\r\n  men had seemed handsome to me. My self-respect increased; I am\r\n  good-natured, but my character is entirely active. Since my twentieth\r\n  year my appearance has steadily improved. My appearance now\r\n  corresponds perfectly with my years. There were recurrences of my\r\n  abnormal inclinations, to be sure; but I struggled against them\r\n  energetically. I satisfy my libido only by means of natural\r\n  intercourse, and I hope that, by continuing to lead a proper life, my\r\n  pleasure in natural coitus will increase.”\r\n\r\nAs a rule, only suggestion coming from a second person, and that by\r\nmeans of hypnosis, promises any success. In such cases, the object of\r\npost-hypnotic suggestion is to remove the impulse to masturbation and\r\nhomo-sexual feelings and impulses, and to encourage hetero-sexual\r\nfeelings with a sense of virility. A prerequisite is, of course, the\r\npossibility to induce hypnosis of sufficient intensity. It is,\r\nunfortunately, in these very cases of neurasthenia that this is\r\nimpossible, since they are often excited, embarrassed, and in no\r\ncondition to concentrate their thoughts.\r\n\r\nThus, in a case reported by me in the _International. Centralblatt für\r\ndie Physiologie und Pathologie der Harn- und Sexualorgane_, Bd. i, Heft\r\n2, p. 58, it was impossible for me to induce hypnosis, though the\r\npatient desired it, and did everything to make it successful. By reason\r\nof the great benefit that can be given to such unfortunates, and with\r\nLadame’s case in view (_v. infra_), in the future, in all such cases,\r\neverything should be done to bring about hypnosis,—the only means of\r\nsalvation. The result, in the three following cases, was satisfactory:—\r\n\r\n  Case 134. _Contrary Sexual Instinct Acquired through\r\n  Masturbation._—Mr. X., merchant, aged 29. Father’s parents healthy.\r\n  Nothing nervous in father’s family. Father was an irritable, peevish\r\n  old man. One brother of the father was a man-about-town, and died\r\n  unmarried. Mother died in third confinement, when the patient was six\r\n  years old; she had a deep, rough, masculine voice, and coarse\r\n  appearance. Of the children, one brother is irritable, “melancholic,”\r\n  and indifferent to women.\r\n\r\n  When a child patient had scarlet fever with delirium. Until his\r\n  fourteenth year he was light-hearted and social, but, after that,\r\n  quiet, solitary, and “melancholic.” The first trace of sexual feeling\r\n  appeared in his tenth or eleventh year, and at that time he learned\r\n  masturbation from other boys, and practiced mutual onanism with them.\r\n  At the age of thirteen or fourteen, ejaculation for the first time.\r\n  Patient has felt no evil results of onanism until the last three\r\n  months.\r\n\r\n  In school he learned easily, but was troubled with headaches. After\r\n  the age of twenty, pollutions, in spite of daily practice of onanism.\r\n  With pollutions, “procreative” dreams, as man and wife might perform\r\n  the act, occurred. In his seventeenth year he was seduced into mutual\r\n  onanism by a man having a love for men. He found satisfaction in this,\r\n  inasmuch as he was always very passionate sexually. It was a long time\r\n  before the patient again sought new opportunities for intercourse with\r\n  males. He did it simply to rid himself of semen. He felt no friendship\r\n  or love for the person with whom he had intercourse. He felt\r\n  satisfaction only when he played the passive _rôle_,—when\r\n  manustupration was practiced on him. When the act was once completed,\r\n  he had no respect for the individual. If it happened that, later, he\r\n  came to respect the man, then he ceased to indulge in the act with\r\n  him. Later it became indifferent to him whether he masturbated or had\r\n  masturbation practiced on him. When he himself practiced onanism, he\r\n  always thought of pleasing men practicing onanism on him during the\r\n  act. He preferred a hard, rough hand.\r\n\r\n  The patient thought that, had he not been led astray, he would have\r\n  arrived at a natural mode of satisfaction of his sexual desires. He\r\n  never felt love for his own sex, though he had pleased himself with\r\n  the thought of loving men. At first he had had sensual inclinations\r\n  toward the opposite sex. He had taken pleasure in dancing, and he had\r\n  been pleased with women, but he had taken more pleasure in the figure\r\n  than the face. Too, he had had erections at the sight of women that\r\n  pleased him. He had never attempted coitus, for fear of infection;\r\n  whether he was potent or not with women, he did not know. He thought\r\n  he could be so no longer, because his feeling for women had grown\r\n  cold, especially during late years.\r\n\r\n  While previously, in his sensual dreams, he had had ideas of both men\r\n  and women, of late years he had dreamed only of approaches to men; he\r\n  could not remember that he had dreamed, in late years, of sensual\r\n  relations with a woman. At the theatre, as well as in the circus and\r\n  _ballet_, the feminine figure had always interested him. In museums\r\n  masculine and feminine statues had affected him equally.\r\n\r\n  Patient is a great smoker, a beer-drinker, loves male society, and is\r\n  a gymnast and skater. Anything dandified was repugnant to him, and he\r\n  had never felt any desire to please men; he would even have preferred\r\n  to please women.\r\n\r\n  He now felt his position to be painful, because onanism had obtained\r\n  the upper hand. Masturbation, that had previously been practiced\r\n  without evil effects, now began to disclose its bad results.\r\n\r\n  Since July, 1889, he had suffered with neuralgia of the testicles. The\r\n  pain occurred particularly at night; and at night there was also\r\n  trembling (increased reflex excitability).\r\n\r\n  Sleep was not refreshing, and he would wake up with pain in the\r\n  testicles. He was inclined, now, to indulge more frequently in\r\n  onanism. He was afraid of the consequences of the habit. He hoped that\r\n  his sexual life might still be turned into normal channels. Now, he\r\n  thought of the future; he had a relation with a girl, who was\r\n  attractive to him, and the thought to possess her as a wife was\r\n  pleasing.\r\n\r\n  For five days he had abstained from onanism, but he could scarcely\r\n  believe that he would be able, with his own strength, to overcome the\r\n  habit. Of late he had been very much depressed, having lost all desire\r\n  for work, and become tired of life.\r\n\r\n  Patient is tall, powerful, well nourished, and has a thick growth of\r\n  beard. Skull and skeleton normal. Knee-jerks very prompt; deep\r\n  reflexes in upper extremities much increased. Pupils dilated, equal,\r\n  and act promptly. Carotids of equal calibre; hyperæsthesia urethræ;\r\n  cords and testicles not sensitive; genitals normal.\r\n\r\n  The patient was calmed, and given hope for the future, provided that\r\n  he give up onanism and attempt to transfer his sexual desires from\r\n  persons of his own sex to females.\r\n\r\n  Hip-baths (24° to 20° R.); ext. secal. conut. aquos., 0.5; antipyrin,\r\n  1.0 (_pro die_); pot. brom., 4.0 (evenings), were ordered.\r\n\r\n  December 13th. To-day the patient came, in a disturbed condition of\r\n  mind, complaining that, unaided, he was unable to resist the impulse\r\n  to masturbate, and he asked for help.\r\n\r\n  A trial of hypnosis induced a condition of deep lethargy in the\r\n  patient.\r\n\r\n  He was given the following suggestions:—\r\n\r\n  1. I can not, must not, and will not masturbate again.\r\n\r\n  2. I abhor the love for my own sex, and shall never again think men\r\n  handsome.\r\n\r\n  3. I shall and will become well again, fall in love with a virtuous\r\n  woman, be happy, and make her happy.\r\n\r\n  December 14th. While out walking to-day, patient saw a handsome man,\r\n  and felt himself powerfully drawn toward him.\r\n\r\n  From this time there were hypnotic sittings every second day, with the\r\n  above suggestions.\r\n\r\n  December 18th (fourth sitting), somnambulism occurred; the impulse to\r\n  onanism and interest in men disappear.\r\n\r\n  At the eighth sitting “complete virility” was added to the above\r\n  suggestions. The patient feels himself morally elevated and physically\r\n  strengthened. The neuralgia of the testicles has disappeared. He now\r\n  found that he was without sexual feeling.\r\n\r\n  He now believed himself free from masturbation and contrary. sexual\r\n  inclination.\r\n\r\n  After the eleventh sitting he thought that further help was\r\n  unnecessary. He wished to go home, and marry. He felt well and potent.\r\n  Early in January, 1890, treatment ceased.\r\n\r\n  In March, 1890, the patient wrote: “I have since had several occasions\r\n  on which it has been necessary for me to use all my moral strength in\r\n  order to overcome my habit, and, thank God, I have been successful in\r\n  freeing myself from this vice. Several times I have had opportunity\r\n  for sexual intercourse, and I have found pleasure in it. I look calmly\r\n  on my happy future.”\r\n\r\n  Case 135. _Acquired Contrary Sexual Instinct. Marked Improvement under\r\n  Hypnotic Treatment._—Mr. P., born in 1863, official in a manufactory.\r\n  He comes of a highly respected patrician family of Middle Germany, in\r\n  which nervousness and insanity have been of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n  His great-grandfather on the father’s side and his sister died insane;\r\n  the grandmother died of apoplexy; father’s brother died insane, and a\r\n  daughter of the latter died of cerebral tuberculosis. The maternal\r\n  grandmother was melancholic for years; maternal grandfather, insane. A\r\n  maternal uncle took his life in an attack of insanity. The patient’s\r\n  father is very nervous. An elder brother is very neurasthenic, and has\r\n  anomalies of the vita sexualis; another is the subject of Case 155; a\r\n  third is eccentric in conduct, and is said to be subject to fixed\r\n  ideas. A sister suffers with convulsions, and another died of them\r\n  when a little child.\r\n\r\n  The patient is constitutionally predisposed; for he was early very\r\n  peculiar, irritable, irascible, and impressed those around him as\r\n  being abnormal.\r\n\r\n  His vita sexualis appeared very early and in great intensity, and was\r\n  satisfied, without any seductions, in onanism. From his sixteenth year\r\n  the prematurely developed boy visited brothels of the Capital, using\r\n  his permissions to go out on Sundays and holidays for that purpose. He\r\n  took pleasure in coitus, but during the week he satisfied himself with\r\n  onanism. After his twentieth year, when he became independent, the\r\n  patient indulged with prostitutes excessively, and fell ill with\r\n  neurasthenia sexualis, becoming relatively impotent and unsatisfied in\r\n  coitus, owing to weakness of erection and premature ejaculation. His\r\n  sexual libido became more powerful than ever, and was satisfied in\r\n  onanism. Early in 1888 the patient made the acquaintance of a young\r\n  man. “By his pleasing face, his attractive manner, and his beautiful\r\n  form, he conquered me entirely. I wished to speak to him, and was\r\n  happy at mere sight of him. I was completely in love with him. With\r\n  this, my love for women was extinguished. Any man could excite me to\r\n  such an extent that, for some moments, I would feel my memory fail,\r\n  and I would stammer.\r\n\r\n  “Soon after this I made the acquaintance of a gentleman who was\r\n  likewise very attractive, and who had a decided influence on my future\r\n  life. He was male-loving. I confessed to him that I no longer felt\r\n  anything but aversion for the female sex, and that I was attracted to\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  “When I once asked my companion how he brought it about that soldiers\r\n  would surrender themselves to him, he answered that the principal\r\n  thing was skill; almost any of them could be brought to it. Late in\r\n  1888, thinking of these words, I was attracted by an officer’s\r\n  servant, and was intensely excited by him, but ejaculation never\r\n  occurred. Since I saw that the soldier would surrender himself without\r\n  trouble, I approached him. Alium quondam militem in cubiculum allectum\r\n  rogavi ut veste exuta mecum in lectum concumberet. Rogatus fecit quæ\r\n  volui et alter alterius penem trivit.\r\n\r\n  “Though after this success I misused many persons, I was never really\r\n  in love, so to speak, with but one. He was a very handsome young\r\n  fellow of seventeen. His voice was so attractive to me, and his manner\r\n  was so delicately proper, that I cannot forget him. In my dreams I\r\n  thought only of handsome young men, and often for whole nights I could\r\n  not sleep, owing to sensual feeling.”\r\n\r\n  Early in 1889 the patient’s conduct awakened a suspicion of male-love.\r\n  A threatening communication frightened him, and plunged him in deep\r\n  depression, so that he contemplated suicide. At the advice of the\r\n  family physician, he came to the Capital. Since the patient was unable\r\n  to overcome his habitual desires by his own will, hypnotic treatment\r\n  was undertaken. It induced but mild lethargy, and, in opposition to\r\n  the seduction of former lovers, it had but little effect.\r\n\r\n  At that time the patient was wanting in earnest desire. There was some\r\n  improvement in matters, in the face of the disgrace to relatives and\r\n  the prospect of a legal examination that was actually threatening. The\r\n  patient determined to attempt a cure with the author.\r\n\r\n  I found him to be a delicate, pale, very neurasthenic man, much\r\n  depressed, and despairing about the future. He was without\r\n  degenerative signs. He realized his perverted situation, and seemed to\r\n  be willing to do anything in order to become again a decent, moral\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  He regretted exceedingly his sexual perversion, which he regarded as\r\n  abnormal, but also as having been acquired. He made no attempt to\r\n  conceal the fact that he could not control himself with young men, and\r\n  likewise he would not say that he could abstain from onanism, to\r\n  which, _faute de mieux_, he was driven. Only a powerful, imperious\r\n  will could keep him from it.\r\n\r\n  Thus far his male-love had consisted exclusively of mutual onanism.\r\n  Erections occurred only when touching men he loved; ejaculation\r\n  resulted early, but simple embrace was not sufficient. He had never\r\n  felt himself in any particular sexual _rôle_ toward a man. Genitals\r\n  and vegetative organs normal.\r\n\r\n  In addition to treatment directed to his neurasthenia, on April 8,\r\n  1890, hypnotic suggestion was begun. Hypnosis was easily induced by\r\n  simply looking at him, with verbal suggestion. After a half-minute the\r\n  patient passed into deep lethargy, with a cataleptiform state of the\r\n  muscles. The awakening was brought about by suggesting it at counting\r\n  three. Post-hypnotic suggestions were always successful. The\r\n  intra-hypnotic suggestions were:—\r\n\r\n  1. The interdiction of onanism.\r\n\r\n  2. The command that male-love should be felt to be disgraceful and\r\n  despicable, and that it should be impossible.\r\n\r\n  3. The command to regard only women as beautiful; to approach them, to\r\n  dream of them, and to have libido and erection at sight of them.\r\n\r\n  The sittings occurred daily. On April 14th, the patient announced,\r\n  with thankfulness and a kind of moral satisfaction, that he had had\r\n  pleasure in coitus, and had ejaculated tardily. On April 16th, he felt\r\n  free from inclination to masturbate, attracted to women, and perfectly\r\n  indifferent to men. He dreamed of female charms and coitus with women.\r\n  May 1st, the patient seemed and felt himself to be normal sexually. He\r\n  has become a different man mentally, full of courage and\r\n  self-confidence. He has coitus with complete satisfaction, and thinks\r\n  that he is insured against relapse.\r\n\r\n  In a later letter Mr. P. writes: “As was only to be expected, I find\r\n  myself lastingly freed from my errors. All that remains to remind me\r\n  of my unhappy time are the dreams, which, though they are infrequent,\r\n  come from my past, which I have no power to banish, and which\r\n  sometimes, indeed, pleasantly occupy my thoughts. But by my own will I\r\n  yet hope soon to succeed in freeing myself absolutely from them.\r\n  Should I ever become weak again, the ideas you have impressed on me\r\n  would, I am sure, make an energetic resistance, and I should not\r\n  succumb.”\r\n\r\n  On October 20, 1890, P. wrote me: “I am completely cured of onanism,\r\n  and I have no pleasure in male-love. Yet complete virility does not\r\n  seem to have been re-established, notwithstanding the fact that I lead\r\n  a virtuous life. Nevertheless, I feel satisfied.”\r\n\r\n  Case 136. _Acquired Contrary Sexual Instinct._—Mr. Z., aged 32,\r\n  divorced. He comes of a hysteropathic mother. Maternal grandmother\r\n  suffered with hysteria, and her brothers and sisters were neurotic.\r\n  One brother is an urning. Z. was but poorly endowed mentally, and did\r\n  not learn easily. No sickness besides scarlatina. When thirteen, he\r\n  was taught to masturbate by companions in a school. Sexually, he was\r\n  hyperæsthetic, and, at seventeen, began to indulge in coitus, with\r\n  full pleasure and power. For reasons of position and money, he married\r\n  at twenty-six. The marriage was very unhappy. After a year Mrs. Z.\r\n  became incapable of coitus, by reason of uterine disease. Z. satisfied\r\n  his inordinate desires with other women, _faute de mieux_, by\r\n  masturbation. Besides, he gave himself up to play, led an absolutely\r\n  dissolute life, became exceedingly neurasthenic, and sought to\r\n  strengthen his weakened nerves by drinking great quantities of wine\r\n  and brandy. To his essential cerebral asthenia were added peripheral\r\n  alcoholic cramps and globus, and he became very emotional. His libido\r\n  nimia continued unabated. On account of his disgust of prostitutes and\r\n  fear of infection, satisfaction by coitus was exceptional. For the\r\n  most part, the patient helped himself with onanism.\r\n\r\n  Four years ago he noticed weakening of erection and decrease of libido\r\n  for women. He began to feel himself drawn toward men, and his\r\n  lascivious dreams were no longer concerned with women, but with men.\r\n\r\n  Three years ago, while being rubbed by a bath-attendant, he became\r\n  powerfully excited sexually (the attendant also had an erection, to\r\n  patient’s surprise). He could not keep from embracing and kissing the\r\n  attendant, and allowing him to perform masturbation on him, the\r\n  attendant doing it most willingly. From this time this mode of sexual\r\n  indulgence was all that he cared for. Women became a matter of entire\r\n  indifference to him; he devoted himself exclusively to men. With them\r\n  he practiced mutual masturbation, and had a longing to sleep with\r\n  them. He abhorred pederasty. He was entirely satisfied until (August,\r\n  1890) an anonymous letter, warning him to be careful, brought him to\r\n  his senses. He was much frightened, had hysterical attacks, and became\r\n  much depressed. He was embarrassed before men, seemed like a pariah in\r\n  society, contemplated suicide, and finally confessed to a priest, who\r\n  comforted him. He now fell into a religious state (equivalent), and,\r\n  out of remorse and to cure himself of his abnormal sexual\r\n  inclinations, wished to go into a cloister. While in this state, my\r\n  “Psychopathia Sexualis” fell into his hands. He was frightened and\r\n  filled with shame, but found a comfort in it, inasmuch as he concluded\r\n  that he must have some malady. His first thought was to rehabilitate\r\n  himself sexually in his own eyes. He overcame all disinclination, and\r\n  visited a brothel. At first he was not successful, on account of great\r\n  excitement, but he finally succeeded.\r\n\r\n  Since, however, his contrary sexual inclinations were not overcome, in\r\n  spite of all his efforts to put them down, he finally came to me,\r\n  asking for assistance. He felt himself to be terribly unfortunate, and\r\n  very near to despair and suicide. He saw destruction before him, and\r\n  would be saved at any price.\r\n\r\n  His confession was interrupted by numerous hysterical attacks.\r\n  Comforting and encouraging words about his future had a calming\r\n  influence.\r\n\r\n  Physically, patient presented a slightly retreating brow, with no\r\n  other anatomical signs of degeneration. Spinal irritation, exaggerated\r\n  deep reflexes, and a sense of pressure in the head pointed to a\r\n  neurasthenic condition. No genital anomalies, though there was\r\n  hyperæsthesia urethræ. Mien distressed; attitude relaxed; mind\r\n  distracted and vacillating.\r\n\r\n  Hip baths, massage, ergot with antipyrin and pot. brom., ordered, with\r\n  interdiction of onanism, intercourse with men, and lascivious thoughts\r\n  of them.\r\n\r\n  After a few days the patient came complaining that he was not equal to\r\n  the task. He said his will was too weak. In this precarious situation,\r\n  it seemed that nothing but hypnotic treatment could bring improvement.\r\n\r\n  September 11, 1889. First sitting. Bernheim’s method used, in order to\r\n  induce lethargy as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n  Suggestions:—\r\n\r\n  1. I abhor onanism, and will not masturbate again.\r\n\r\n  2. I regard the inclination for men disgusting,—horrible; and I shall\r\n  never think men handsome and enticing.\r\n\r\n  3. Women alone I find enticing. Once a week I shall cohabit, with full\r\n  pleasure and power.\r\n\r\n  The patient received these suggestions, and repeated them in a\r\n  drawling tone.\r\n\r\n  The sittings took place every second day. After the fifteenth, it was\r\n  possible to induce the somnambulic stage of hypnosis with any\r\n  post-hypnotic suggestions desired.\r\n\r\n  The patient improved morally and mentally, but symptoms of cerebral\r\n  neurasthenia troubled him still, and, now and then, dreams of men\r\n  occurred; and there were, also, in the waking state, inclinations\r\n  toward men, which depressed him exceedingly.\r\n\r\n  Treatment until September 24th. Result: Free from onanism; no longer\r\n  excitable to men, though impressionable to women. Normal coitus once\r\n  in eight days. Hysterical symptoms absent; neurasthenic symptoms much\r\n  ameliorated.\r\n\r\n  On October 6th the patient reported by letter that he was feeling\r\n  well, and expressed his gratitude for his salvation; he felt as if\r\n  given a new life.\r\n\r\n  December 9, 1889, patient again came for treatment. Of late he had had\r\n  lascivious dreams of men twice, but had experienced no inclination\r\n  toward men in the waking state. He had also resisted the impulse to\r\n  masturbate, though, while living alone in the country, he had had no\r\n  opportunity for coitus. He had inclinations only for the opposite sex,\r\n  and, as a rule, dreamed only of females. Returned to the city, he had\r\n  indulged in coitus with pleasure. The patient felt himself morally\r\n  rehabilitated, being almost free from neurasthenic symptoms; and,\r\n  after three more hypnotic sittings, he declared himself perfectly\r\n  well, and confident that he would not relapse. Such a relapse\r\n  occurred, however, in September, 1890, when, after over-exertion on an\r\n  excursion into the mountains, and emotional strain with want of\r\n  opportunity for coitus, he had again become neurasthenic.\r\n\r\n  Again he had dreams of men, and felt drawn toward attractive male\r\n  forms; he masturbated many times, and, after returning to the city,\r\n  found no real pleasure in coitus. By means of anti-neurasthenic\r\n  treatment and hypnosis, it was possible soon to restore the previous\r\n  condition.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the years 1890 and 1891 the patient now and then had\r\n  contrary sexual feelings and dreams, but only when, as a result of\r\n  emotional strain or excesses, his neurosis re-appeared. At such times\r\n  satisfaction in coitus was wanting. He would then find it necessary to\r\n  undergo a few hypnotic sittings, in order to restore his\r\n  equilibrium—always with success.\r\n\r\n  At the end of 1891 the patient pointed with satisfaction to the fact\r\n  that, since treatment, he had been able to avoid masturbation and\r\n  male-intercourse, and had regained his self-confidence and\r\n  self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing details of the successful results of hypnotic suggestion,\r\nin cases of acquired contrary sexual feeling, make it seem possible that\r\nthose unfortunates that are afflicted with the congenital perversion may\r\nbe helped in some degree by the same means.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, here the condition is entirely different, since a congenital\r\ncondition must be combated, an abnormal psycho-sexual life annihilated,\r\nand a new one created. _A priori_ this task seems impossible; at least,\r\nin the perfect urning. That the apparently impossible is artificially\r\npossible may be seen from the case of Schrenk-Notzing, which follows\r\nbelow. It far surpasses the case reported by me (_v. infra_), in which\r\nat least the homo-sexual feelings and impulses were removed by means of\r\nhypnotic suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe case of Ladame (_v. infra_) is an analogous one. The conditions are\r\nmore favorable in psycho-sexual hermaphrodites, where at least there are\r\nrudiments of hetero-sexual feelings that may be strengthened and made\r\noperative by suggestion.\r\n\r\n  Case 137. “I was born in 1858, out of wedlock. It was only late that I\r\n  was able to trace my obscure origin, and obtain knowledge of my\r\n  parents; and this knowledge is, unfortunately, very obscure and\r\n  imperfect. My father and mother were cousins. My father died three\r\n  years ago. He had later married, and, as far as I know, had several\r\n  healthy children.\r\n\r\n  “I do not think that my father had contrary sexual feelings. Without\r\n  knowing him as my father, I often saw him when I was a child. He was a\r\n  powerful, masculine man. As for the rest, it is said that, at the time\r\n  of my birth, or before, he was sexually ill.\r\n\r\n  “I have often seen my mother on the street, but I did not then know\r\n  that she was my mother. At the time of my birth she may have been\r\n  about twenty-four years old. She was tall, and quick and energetic of\r\n  movement, and her character was decided. At the time of my birth she\r\n  is reported to have gone about much in male attire, to have worn short\r\n  hair, to have smoked a long pipe, and in general to have been\r\n  remarkable for her eccentric character. She was exceedingly well\r\n  educated, and is said to have been beautiful in her youth. She left a\r\n  fortune,—considerable even when measured by our present ideas,—but she\r\n  died unmarried.\r\n\r\n  “In any case, all this would point to homo-sexual inclinations, or, at\r\n  least, to abnormalities. On the other hand, several years before my\r\n  birth, my mother took care of a little girl. This step-sister, whom I\r\n  never knew, married young, but early in her married life, for reasons\r\n  unknown to me, she poisoned herself.\r\n\r\n  “I am 1.7 metres tall, measure 92 centimetres around the waist, and\r\n  102 centimetres around hips, and, therefore, I think my pelvis is\r\n  somewhat over-developed. The subcutaneous fat has always been\r\n  abundant. Skeletal form is strong. The muscular system is well formed,\r\n  but, from lack of exercise, perhaps owing to the influence of early,\r\n  long-continued, and frequent indulgence in onanism, it is not well\r\n  developed; so that I appear stronger than I really am. Hair of head\r\n  and face is normal; genital hair, somewhat thin. The upper portion of\r\n  the body is as good as without hair. In all other ways my appearance\r\n  is fully masculine. Gait, attitude, and voice are those of a fully\r\n  developed man, and other urnings have often told me that they would\r\n  never have suspected my passion. I served in the army, and always\r\n  found pleasure in all knightly exercises,—riding, fencing, swimming,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  “My early training was under a priest. I had but few real playmates.\r\n  The family life of my foster-parents was faultless. In October, 1861,\r\n  I entered the Institute. Here I indulged in my first perverse acts,\r\n  which I shall describe more fully when I come to the development of my\r\n  sexual life.\r\n\r\n  “I finished the Gymnasium, served my voluntary years in the army, and\r\n  then studied forestry, being now a director of estates. During my\r\n  early years my mental development was very slow. I first learned to\r\n  speak in my third year, and thus the supposition that I had\r\n  hydrocephalus was strengthened. From the time of beginning school, my\r\n  mental development was abnormal; indeed, I learned easily, but I have\r\n  never been able to concentrate my activity on any particular subject.\r\n  I have a great interest in art and æsthetics, but almost none in\r\n  music. In early years my character was the worst possible. Without\r\n  being able to give any reason for it, during the last twelve years\r\n  there has been an entire transformation. Now, there is nothing I hate\r\n  more than a lie, and I never speak untruth even in jest. In financial\r\n  matters, without being avaricious, I have become an economical\r\n  manager.\r\n\r\n  “It is enough that, with a deep feeling of shame, I look back on my\r\n  past; and, if I could be freed from my unhappy sexual perversion, or\r\n  perversity, I should justly regard myself as a true gentleman. I am\r\n  kind, and always ready to be charitable to the extent of my means; I\r\n  am gay-spirited, and regarded with favor socially. I have no trace of\r\n  that nervous irritability which is so often noticeable in others like\r\n  me. Too, I am not wanting in personal courage. There is nothing in the\r\n  early period of my development that points to abnormality. To be sure,\r\n  as a child, I liked to lie in bed on my abdomen, and, of a morning, I\r\n  often took delight in rolling about on my abdomen, much to the\r\n  amusement of my foster-parents; but I cannot recall that, at such\r\n  times, I ever had sensual feeling. I never sought much to play with\r\n  girls, and I never played with dolls. I early heard talk about sexual\r\n  matters; but I never thought anything about it. In my dreams, too, at\r\n  that time, there was nothing sexual; and, in my association with boys\r\n  of my own age, there was nothing of that kind. I think I may say that\r\n  my vita sexualis was really first awakened after I had been seduced\r\n  into mutual masturbation, in my thirteenth year, by a room-mate at the\r\n  Institute. At that time ejaculation did not take place, but first\r\n  about a year later. Nevertheless, I gave myself up to the vice of\r\n  onanism passionately. At this time, however, the first signs of\r\n  homo-sexual inclination were manifested. Youthful, powerful men,\r\n  market-helpers, workmen, and soldiers took possession of my dreams,\r\n  and played an important _rôle_ in my fancy while masturbating. At this\r\n  time was also first shown the tendency to pederasty, especially\r\n  passive. Up to my fourteenth year I frequently made mutual attempts at\r\n  pederasty with my seducer, but neither of us were successful in\r\n  bringing about immissio. At the same time, there was also a weak\r\n  inclination for the female sex. About a year after the first\r\n  indulgence in onanism, I was once with a puella publica, but I had\r\n  neither ejaculation nor any especial feeling of sensual pleasure.\r\n  Thereafter, and up to my nineteenth year, I performed coitus in public\r\n  houses about six times. Erection and ejaculation occurred promptly,\r\n  but without marked sensual pleasure. At least onanism, particularly\r\n  mutual onanism, I liked quite as much. I have never had any love for\r\n  athletes. About ten years ago, while at H., a watering-place, I\r\n  thought I was in love with a beautiful lady of a highly respectable\r\n  family; I was happy in her presence, and thought myself happy in\r\n  finding my love returned. For a time this affair kept me from\r\n  masturbating; I was only afraid that, weakened by onanism that had\r\n  been practiced for years, I should be incapable of performing my\r\n  marital duty. When we became widely separated, my feeling quickly\r\n  cooled; I found that I had deceived myself; and, after about two\r\n  years, without jealousy, I was able to hear that the lady had married.\r\n  My inclination for women—if, in reality, I have ever had any—grew\r\n  colder and colder. Two and a half years ago, when I visited a public\r\n  house with very virile friends, I last performed coitus. There was\r\n  erection, but no ejaculation. Women have become indifferent to me. A\r\n  prostitute who acts coarsely excites my repugnance. With intellectual\r\n  women, particularly when they are elderly, I like to converse, but in\r\n  their society I am often unskillful and awkward, often devoid of tact.\r\n  I have never been able to find any charm in woman’s physical form.\r\n\r\n  “But, to return to the perverse inclinations. When, at the age of\r\n  fourteen, I went to H., I lost sight of my lover and seducer. He was\r\n  some years older than I, and was an official; and, in this capacity,\r\n  when I was nineteen, I again met him once on the railway. We\r\n  immediately cut the journey short, and lodged together, attempting\r\n  mutual pederasty; but, on account of pain, immissio was not\r\n  successful. We amused ourselves in mutual onanism. In H. I had sexual\r\n  intercourse with two fellow-students, but this intercourse was\r\n  confined to frequent mutual onanism, owing to the fact that they were\r\n  not inclined to pederasty. During the last year of my stay (when I was\r\n  nineteen), I had intercourse with another person, which likewise\r\n  consisted of onanism; but our intercourse was more intimate, and we\r\n  always retired, and practiced mutual onanism in bed. From Easter,\r\n  1869, until July, 1870, I had no lover. I practiced onanism alone.\r\n  When the war broke out, I offered myself as a volunteer, but was not\r\n  accepted. At the same time a former school-mate offered himself. He\r\n  had developed into a remarkably handsome man. I had to spend one night\r\n  with him in an over-crowded hotel. Though as students we had never\r\n  associated sexually, he was not averse to my desire, and attempted\r\n  pederasty. In this instance pain prevented success; but, in the\r\n  attempt, ejaculatio ante anum meum occurred. Even now I can recall the\r\n  pleasurable feeling I had in it,—a feeling previously unknown. After\r\n  the war I frequently met this friend, but our intercourse was later\r\n  limited to onanism. During the following eighteen years I had but two\r\n  opportunities for homo-sexual intercourse. The first was in the winter\r\n  of 1879, on the occasion of meeting a handsome hussar in a railway\r\n  carriage. I induced him to sleep with me at an hotel. Later he\r\n  confessed to me that he had previously practiced mutual masturbation\r\n  with the son of a landed proprietor of his town. I could not bring him\r\n  to pederasty. On the other hand, I induced ejaculation in him by\r\n  receptio penis ejus in os meum. This caused me no satisfaction, but\r\n  rather disgust. I have never tried it again; and, too, I have never\r\n  allowed receptio penis mei in os alterius. In 1887, likewise on the\r\n  railway, I made the acquaintance of a sailor, and induced him to stay\r\n  with me at an hotel. He said he had never practiced pederasty, but he\r\n  was ready for it. He was apparently sensually excited; he had an\r\n  erection immediately, and performed the act with evident passion. It\r\n  was the first time that pederasty was successfully performed. I had\r\n  terrible pain, but also indescribable pleasure.\r\n\r\n  “With my sojourn here, my vita sexualis has undergone a complete\r\n  change. I have learned how easy it is to find persons who, partly for\r\n  money and partly from desire, yield to our inclinations. I have also\r\n  not been spared annoying experiences with cheats. Until the end of the\r\n  last year (since then, owing to fear of venereal infection, I have not\r\n  gone beyond mutual masturbation), I enjoyed male-love to the full\r\n  extent, particularly in passive pederasty. I have never practiced\r\n  active pederasty, because I have found no one able to endure the pain.\r\n\r\n  “Generally, I seek my lovers among cavalrymen and sailors, and,\r\n  eventually, among workmen, especially butchers and smiths. Robust\r\n  forms, with healthy facial complexions, attract me especially.\r\n  Leathern riding-trousers have a particular charm for me. I have no\r\n  partiality for kissing and the like. I also love large, hard, and\r\n  calloused hands.\r\n\r\n  “I do not wish to leave unmentioned that, under certain circumstances,\r\n  I have great control of myself.\r\n\r\n  “As director of an estate, I lived in a large house. My personal\r\n  servant was a very handsome young man who had served in the hussars.\r\n  After once having spoken with him, in general terms, on the subject,\r\n  and found that he could not be approached, for years I lived in close\r\n  intimacy with him, and enjoyed his beauty, but never touched him. I\r\n  think that, to this day, he knows nothing of my passion. Likewise, two\r\n  and a half years ago, in C., I made the acquaintance of a sailor, who\r\n  is still regarded by me and my acquaintances as one of the handsomest\r\n  men we know. After an absence of more than two years, on invitation,\r\n  he visited me a few weeks ago. I knew how to arrange matters so that\r\n  we slept in the same room, and I burned with desire to be nearer to\r\n  him. As a preliminary, however, I sounded him in confidential talk;\r\n  and, when I found that he despised everything connected with\r\n  male-love, I had not the heart to approach him more closely. For weeks\r\n  we slept in the same room, and I took constant delight in his divine\r\n  form (at first, was sexually excited, in fact); I bathed with him, in\r\n  the Roman manner, in order to see his beautiful form naked,—but he\r\n  never learned anything of my passion. I still have an ideal, platonic\r\n  relation with this young man, who, for one of his position, has an\r\n  unusual education and fine talent for poetry.\r\n\r\n  “Until my thirty-eighth year I had not a clear understanding of my\r\n  condition. I always thought that, by early and frequent masturbation,\r\n  I had become averse to women, and hoped always that, when the right\r\n  woman came, I should be able to abandon onanism and find pleasure in\r\n  her. Here it was that I first came to fully understand my condition,\r\n  after making the acquaintance of others suffering and feeling like\r\n  myself. At first I was frightened; later I came to look upon my fate\r\n  as something not dependent on myself. Too, I made no further effort to\r\n  resist temptation.\r\n\r\n  “Two or three weeks ago ‘Psychopathia Sexualis’ fell into my hands.\r\n  The work has made an unexpectedly deep impression on me. At first I\r\n  read the work with an interest that was undoubtedly lascivious. The\r\n  description of the cultivation of _mujerados_, for example, excited me\r\n  uncommonly. The thought of a young, powerful man being emasculated in\r\n  this manner, in order, later, to be used for pederasty by a whole\r\n  tribe of wild, powerful, and sensual Indians, so excited me that I\r\n  masturbated five times during the next two days, fancying myself such\r\n  a presumptive _mujerado_. The farther I read in the book, however, the\r\n  more I saw its moral earnestness; the more I felt disgust with my\r\n  condition; and the more I saw that I must do everything, if it were\r\n  possible, to bring about a change in my condition. When I had finished\r\n  the book, I was determined to seek assistance from its author.\r\n\r\n  “The reading of this work had an undoubted effect. Since then I have\r\n  masturbated only twice, and have practiced onanism with cavalrymen\r\n  only twice. In every instance I have had really less pleasure and\r\n  satisfaction than before, and I always have the feeling: ‘Ah, if I\r\n  could only be free from it!’ Nevertheless, I confess that, even now,\r\n  in the society of handsome soldiers, I immediately have erection.\r\n\r\n  “In conclusion, I may add that, in spite of, or, perhaps, on account\r\n  of, onanism, I have never had pollutions. The ejaculation of semen,\r\n  which usually consists of only a few drops, and it has always been so,\r\n  takes place only after prolonged friction. If, for any reason, I have\r\n  not masturbated for a long time, the ejaculation takes place quickly,\r\n  and is more abundant. About twelve years ago Hansen tried in vain to\r\n  hypnotize me.”\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1891 the writer of the foregoing autobiography\r\n  visited me, with the declaration that he could live no longer in his\r\n  condition; that he looked to hypnotic treatment as the only hope of\r\n  salvation, for he had not strength enough to resist his impulse to\r\n  masturbation and satisfaction with persons of his own sex. He felt\r\n  like a pariah; like an unnatural man; like one outside the laws of\r\n  nature and society, and in danger of criminal prosecution. He felt\r\n  moral repugnance when he performed the act with a man, but yet the\r\n  sight of any handsome soldier actually electrified him. For years he\r\n  had not had the slightest sympathy with women, not even mentally.\r\n\r\n  The patient looked to be exactly the person, physically and mentally,\r\n  described by himself in his autobiography. His head was exquisitely\r\n  hydrocephalic, and also plagiocephalic. At first attempts at hypnosis\r\n  met with difficulties. Only by Braid’s method, with the help of a\r\n  little chloroform, was deep lethargy attained at the third sitting.\r\n  From that time simply looking at a shining object was sufficient. The\r\n  suggestions consisted of the command to avoid masturbation, the\r\n  removal of homo-sexual feelings, and the assurance that the patient\r\n  would have inclination for women and be virile, and have pleasure only\r\n  in hetero-sexual intercourse. Masturbation was indulged in but once;\r\n  after the eighth sitting the patient dreamed of a woman.\r\n\r\n  When, after the fourteenth sitting, the patient had to return, on\r\n  account of pressing business, he declared that he was quite free from\r\n  any inclination to masturbate or to indulge in male-love, but that he\r\n  was by no means absolutely free from his partiality for men. He felt a\r\n  returning interest in the female sex, and hoped to be freed finally\r\n  from his unhappy condition by continuance of the treatment.\r\n\r\n  Case 138. _Psychical Hermaphroditism._—Mr. von P., aged 25, single,\r\n  comes of a neuropathic family. As a child he had convulsions. He\r\n  recovered, but remained weak, emotional, and irritable. No severe\r\n  illnesses. Before his tenth year sexuality was manifested. His\r\n  earliest remembrance concerning it was that of lascivious feelings in\r\n  company with the servants of the house. When older, he had sensual\r\n  dreams which were of intercourse with men. In circuses the male\r\n  performers alone interested him.\r\n\r\n  Youthful, powerful men were most enticing to him. Often, he could\r\n  scarcely resist the longing to fall on their necks and kiss them. Of\r\n  late simply the touching of such persons had become sufficient to give\r\n  him pleasure and induce ejaculation. The impulse to engage in\r\n  “affairs” with men he had, thus far, fortunately resisted. The patient\r\n  is a psychical hermaphrodite, in so far as he is not insensitive to\r\n  the charms of women, and finds men more pleasing than women. In fact,\r\n  feminine nudity had never pleased him, and he can remember only to\r\n  have dreamed once of coitus with a woman.\r\n\r\n  On account of his great sexual desire, and because he was ashamed to\r\n  give himself up to men, after his twentieth year he began to have\r\n  sexual intercourse with women. Since then, he has very seldom indulged\r\n  in manual onanism, but often in mental masturbation, during which the\r\n  forms of handsome men float through his fancy.\r\n\r\n  He had coitus with success, but without pleasure or sensual feeling.\r\n  On account of circumstances, he was forced to abstain from his\r\n  twenty-second until his twenty-fourth year. This abstinence was\r\n  painful, and he relieved himself, now and then, by mental onanism.\r\n\r\n  When, a year ago, he had opportunity again for coitus, he noticed\r\n  failure of libido for women, imperfect erection, and premature\r\n  ejaculation. Finally he gave up coitus; then libido for men was\r\n  manifested.\r\n\r\n  In the condition of irritable weakness of the ejaculatory centre, mere\r\n  touching of sympathetic men was sufficient to induce ejaculation.\r\n\r\n  Patient is an only child. The circumstances of his family demand that\r\n  he marry. He justly hesitates to do this, thinks he is mentally\r\n  impotent, and asks for advice and help.\r\n\r\n  He points out that his feeling for men must be eradicated in order to\r\n  help him.\r\n\r\n  Patient’s appearance is, in all respects, masculine. His head is\r\n  slightly hydrocephalic and rhombic. Abundant growth of beard. Genitals\r\n  normal; cremasteric reflex cannot be excited. No manifestations of\r\n  neurasthenia. Neuropathic eyes. Pollutions infrequent. Erections occur\r\n  only as a result of contact with men.\r\n\r\n  July 16, 1889, hypnotic suggestion, after Bernheim’s method, was\r\n  begun. It was first at the third sitting that deep lethargy was\r\n  induced.\r\n\r\n  Suggestions: “You have no longer any desire for men. Only woman is\r\n  beautiful and desirable. You will love a woman, marry, be happy, and\r\n  make her happy. You are fully potent; you feel that already.”\r\n\r\n  In daily hypnosis, which never goes beyond lethargy, the patient\r\n  accepts the suggestions. On July 24th, he announces that he has had\r\n  pleasure in coitus; and the male servants no longer interest him. At\r\n  the same time, he still finds men more beautiful than women. On August\r\n  1, 1889, it was necessary to discontinue treatment. Result: Completely\r\n  potent; entire indifference for men, but also for women.\r\n\r\nThe same treatment met with decided success in a case of psycho-sexual\r\nhermaphroditism, reported by me in vol. i of the _Internat. Centralblatt\r\nfür die Physiol. u. Path. der Harn- und Sexualorgane_.\r\n\r\n  Case 139. Mr. von X., aged 25, landed proprietor. He comes of a\r\n  neuropathic, passionate father. Father is said to have been normal\r\n  sexually. His mother was nervous, as were her two sisters. Maternal\r\n  grandmother was nervous, and his maternal grandfather was a _roué_,\r\n  much given to venery. Patient is like his mother, and an only child.\r\n  From birth he was weak, suffered much with migraine, and was nervous.\r\n  He passed through several illnesses. At fifteen he began masturbation,\r\n  without having been taught it.\r\n\r\n  Until his seventeenth year he says he never had feeling for men, or,\r\n  in fact, any sexual inclination; but at this time desire for men\r\n  arose. He fell in love with a comrade. His friend returned his love.\r\n  They embraced and kissed and indulged in mutual onanism. Occasionally\r\n  patient practiced coitus inter femora viri. He abhorred pederasty.\r\n  Lascivious dreams were concerned only with men. In the circus and\r\n  theatre males alone interested him. The inclination was for those of\r\n  about twenty years. Handsome, tall forms were enticing to him. Given\r\n  these conditions, he was quite indifferent to other characteristics of\r\n  the men. In his sexual affairs with men his part was always that of a\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  After his eighteenth year the patient was always a source of anxiety\r\n  to his highly respected parents, for he then began a love-affair with\r\n  a male waiter, who fleeced him and made him an object of remark and\r\n  ridicule. He was taken home. He consorted with servants and hostlers.\r\n  He caused a scandal. He was sent away for travel. In London he got\r\n  into a “blackmailing scrape,” but succeeded in escaping to his home.\r\n\r\n  He profited in no way by this bitter experience, and again showed\r\n  disgraceful inclinations toward men. Patient was sent to me to be\r\n  cured of his fatal peculiarity (December 12, 1888). Patient is a tall,\r\n  stately, robust, well-nourished young man, of masculine build; large,\r\n  well-formed genitals. Gait, voice, and attitude are masculine. He has\r\n  no pronounced masculine passions. He smokes but little, and only\r\n  cigarettes; drinks little, and is fond of confectionery. He loves\r\n  music, arts, æsthetics, flowers, and moves in ladies’ society by\r\n  preference. He wears a moustache, the face being otherwise cleanly\r\n  shaved. His garments are in nowise remarkable. He is a soft, _blasé_\r\n  fellow, and a do-nothing. He lies abed mornings, and can scarcely be\r\n  made to rise before noon. He says he has never regarded his\r\n  inclination toward his own sex as abnormal. He looks upon it as\r\n  congenital; but, taught by his evil experiences, he wishes to be cured\r\n  of his perversion. He has little faith in his own will. He has tried\r\n  to help himself, but always begins to masturbate. This he finds\r\n  injurious, inasmuch as it causes slight neurasthenic symptoms. There\r\n  is no moral defect. The intelligence is a little below the average.\r\n  Careful education and aristocratic manners are apparent. The exquisite\r\n  neuropathic eye betrays the nervous constitution. The patient is not a\r\n  complete and hopeless urning. _He has hetero-sexual feelings, but his\r\n  sensual inclinations toward the opposite sex are manifested weakly and\r\n  infrequently._ When nineteen, he was first taken to a brothel by\r\n  friends. He experienced no horror feminæ, had efficient erections, and\r\n  some pleasure in coitus, but not the instinctive delight he\r\n  experienced while embracing men.\r\n\r\n  Since then, patient asserts that he has had coitus six times, twice\r\n  _sua sponte_. He gives the assurance that he is always capable of it,\r\n  but he does it only _faute de mieux_, as he does masturbation, when\r\n  the sexual impulse troubles him, as a substitute for intercourse with\r\n  men. He has thought of the possibility of finding a sympathetic lady\r\n  and marrying her. He would regard marital cohabitation and abstinence\r\n  from intercourse with men as hard duties.\r\n\r\n  Since there were rudiments of hetero-sexual feelings present, and the\r\n  case could not be looked upon as hopeless, it seemed that treatment\r\n  was indicated. The indications were clear enough, but there was no\r\n  support for them in the will of the indolent patient, so unconscious\r\n  of his own position. It lay near to seek support for the moral\r\n  influence in hypnosis. The fulfillment of this hope seemed doubtful,\r\n  because the famous Hansen had tried several times, in vain, to\r\n  hypnotize him.\r\n\r\n  At the same time, by reason of the most important social interests of\r\n  the patient, it was necessary to make another attempt. To my great\r\n  surprise, Bernheim’s procedure induced immediately a condition of deep\r\n  lethargy, with possibility of post-hypnotic suggestion.\r\n\r\n  At the second sitting somnambulism was induced by merely looking at\r\n  him. The patient is obnoxious to suggestions of all kinds; indeed,\r\n  contractures are induced by stroking him. He is awakened by counting\r\n  three. Awakened, patient has amnesia for all the events of the\r\n  hypnotic state. Hypnosis is induced every second or third day for the\r\n  communication of hypnotic suggestions. At the same time, moral and\r\n  hydro=therapeutic measures are employed.\r\n\r\n  The hypnotic suggestions were as follow:—\r\n\r\n  1. I abhor onanism, because it makes me sick and miserable.\r\n\r\n  2. I no longer have inclination toward men; for love of men is against\r\n  religion, nature, and law.\r\n\r\n  3. I feel an inclination toward women; for woman is lovely and\r\n  desirable, and created for man.\r\n\r\n  During the sittings the patient always repeats these suggestions.\r\n  After the fourth sitting it was noticeable that, when taken into\r\n  society, he paid court to ladies. Shortly after that, when a famous\r\n  prima-donna sang, he was all enthusiasm for her. Some days later the\r\n  patient sought the address of a brothel.\r\n\r\n  At the same time, he preferred the society of young gentlemen; but the\r\n  most careful watching failed to reveal anything suspicious.\r\n\r\n  February 17th. Patient asks to be allowed to indulge in coitus, and is\r\n  very well satisfied with his experience with one of the _demi-monde_.\r\n\r\n  March 16th. Up to this time, hypnosis twice a week. The patient always\r\n  passes into deep somnambulism by simply being looked at, and, at\r\n  request, repeats the suggestions. He is obnoxious to all kinds of\r\n  post-hypnotic suggestion, and, in the waking state, knows not the\r\n  least of the influences exerted on him in the hypnotic state. In the\r\n  hypnotic condition he always gives the assurance that he is free from\r\n  onanism and sexual feeling for men. Since he gives the same answers in\r\n  hypnosis,—_e.g._, that on such and such a date he practiced onanism\r\n  for the last time, and that he is too much under the will of the\r\n  physician to be able to lie,—his assertions deserve belief; the more,\r\n  since he looks well and is free from all neurasthenic symptoms, and,\r\n  in the society of men, not the slightest suspicion rests on him. An\r\n  open, free, and manly bearing is developed.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, since, of his own will, he now and then indulges in coitus\r\n  with pleasure, and occasional pollutions are induced by lascivious\r\n  dreams which concern women, there can be no doubt of the favorable\r\n  change of his vita sexualis; and it is presumable that the hypnotic\r\n  suggestions have developed into auto-suggestive inclinations, which\r\n  direct his feelings, thoughts, and will. Probably the patient will\r\n  always remain a natura frigida; but he more often speaks of marriage,\r\n  and of his intention to win a wife as soon as he has become acquainted\r\n  with a sympathetic lady.\r\n\r\n  In July, 1889, I received a letter from his father, which told me of\r\n  his good health and conduct.\r\n\r\n  On May 24, 1890, by chance, I met my former patient, while on a\r\n  journey. His bright, healthful appearance allowed the most favorable\r\n  opinion of his condition. He told me that he still had sympathetic\r\n  feeling for some men, but never anything like love. He occasionally\r\n  had pleasurable coitus with women, and now thought of marriage.\r\n\r\n  I hypnotized him, in the former manner, to try him, and asked for the\r\n  commands I had given him. In a deep condition of somnambulism, and in\r\n  the same tone of voice as formerly, the patient repeated the\r\n  suggestions he had received in December, 1888,—an excellent example of\r\n  the possible duration and power of post-hypnotic suggestion.\r\n\r\n  Case 140. _Psychical Hermaphroditism; Improvement with Hypnotic\r\n  Treatment._—Mr. von K., aged 23; of distinguished family; well endowed\r\n  mentally; scrofulous as a child. His father is said to have been\r\n  dissipated. His father’s brother is said to have been subject to\r\n  contrary sexuality.\r\n\r\n  The patient states that, when only seven years old, he had a peculiar\r\n  inclination for male persons. It was particularly coachmen and\r\n  servants having moustaches for whom he showed partiality at that time.\r\n  He experienced a peculiar delightful sensation when he pressed himself\r\n  against such persons.\r\n\r\n  The patient entered the cadet corps early, and there he was seduced\r\n  into mutual onanism, and also learned imitatio coitus inter femora\r\n  viri. At the age of seventeen he had coitus with a prostitute for the\r\n  first time. He performed the act perfectly, but had not the slightest\r\n  pleasure in it; and he learned that this kind of gratification\r\n  amounted to nothing, or that he must be different from other young\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless, he often had coitus, and contracted gonorrhœa. After\r\n  this he experienced an increasing aversion for the female sex, and\r\n  indulged in coitus less and less frequently; in fact, only when, with\r\n  intense libido, he could not gain opportunity for intercourse with\r\n  men. His inclination for men predominated more and more, and he was\r\n  attracted exclusively by those handsomely formed, and having as little\r\n  beard as possible. He descended to the most revolting\r\n  practices,—coitus buccalis, active and passive pederasty.\r\n\r\n  The patient was deeply ashamed of such depravity, and was constantly\r\n  endeavoring to get into better ways by means of coitus with women. But\r\n  he came to the despairing conclusion that his moral strength was\r\n  insufficient, that he was indifferent about intercourse with women, or\r\n  that it was repugnant to him; and that he was created for sexual\r\n  intercourse with persons of his own sex. In fact, he had never dreamed\r\n  of women, but always of men; and that at a time, too, when he had no\r\n  suspicion of the difference between the sexes.\r\n\r\n  The patient comes for consultation, because he sees that he is\r\n  jeopardizing the happiness of his whole life, and recognizes the\r\n  unnaturalness and immorality of his sexual life. He does not regard\r\n  his condition as hopeless; for he has no horror of women, and three\r\n  weeks ago he had successful coitus with one, though it was devoid of\r\n  all pleasure and mental satisfaction. He has no doubt that he was\r\n  really created to love men; but, owing to acquired neurasthenia, in\r\n  the sexual act with a man he experiences no such pleasure as formerly.\r\n  He had given up his position as an officer, because the soldiers\r\n  excited him so sexually that he feared he might compromise himself.\r\n\r\n  The patient is devoid of degenerative signs. His appearance is\r\n  perfectly masculine, and his genitals are normal. Examination of the\r\n  semen revealed abundance of spermatozoa. The penis is large and well\r\n  developed; the growth of hair ad genitalia, as well as on the rest of\r\n  the body, is abundant. The patient has masculine tastes, but has never\r\n  been partial to drinking and smoking. A neuropathic eye is all that\r\n  points to a nervous constitution.\r\n\r\n  In his sexual acts with men, he states that, as a rule, he has felt as\r\n  a man, only now and then as a woman.\r\n\r\n  An attempt at hypnosis leads to lethargy, with cataleptic condition of\r\n  the muscles, and the opportunity is used to impart suitable\r\n  suggestions.\r\n\r\n  After the fourth sitting he expressed himself as satisfied, and\r\n  wondered that men made no impression on him. He wished to try his\r\n  fortune with women, but was afraid that he was impotent.\r\n\r\n  After the sixth sitting, without advice, he attempted coitus cum\r\n  muliere. His libido was very great, but inter actum this and erection\r\n  left him.\r\n\r\n  After the ninth sitting the patient was forced to discontinue\r\n  treatment, owing to business that called him home. He was satisfied,\r\n  in that he felt indifferent and capable of resistance to men. He felt\r\n  sure that he would not relapse into his former vices. At the same\r\n  time, he had not the slightest interest in the female sex.\r\n\r\n  Case 141. Mr. X., aged 31, chemist, comes of a neuropathic family, and\r\n  from childhood has been nervous, emotional, and apprehensive, and\r\n  afflicted with migraine. He remembers distinctly that, when a very\r\n  small boy, he had a lustful feeling at the sight of the half-naked\r\n  persons in the work-shop at his father’s house, and felt drawn to\r\n  them. When he began school, he felt in the same way toward his\r\n  companions. At the age of eleven, without teaching, he began to\r\n  masturbate, during which he thought of his comrades. Later there were\r\n  enthusiastic friendships. His vita sexualis gained the upper hand. As\r\n  he grew up, women also interested him, but his chief interest was in\r\n  men of the higher circles of society. He felt that this inclination\r\n  was abnormal, and sought the acquaintance of puellis; he often had\r\n  coitus, but never with any real pleasure. Thus he became more and more\r\n  given to contrary sexuality, practiced mutual masturbation and coitus\r\n  inter femora viri, and occasionally gave himself up to passive\r\n  pederasty; but he soon abandoned this, on account of the pain it\r\n  caused him.\r\n\r\n  He asserts that he feels perfectly masculine, and has never had female\r\n  inclinations. Skeleton and attitude perfectly masculine; strabismus;\r\n  abundant beard; genitals entirely normal. No aversion to the female\r\n  sex. Occasional coitus with puellis, but without satisfaction. The\r\n  patient feels exceedingly unhappy, and clearly recognizes his abnormal\r\n  position; at any price, he wishes to be freed from his homo-sexual\r\n  inclination, and made capable of marriage. “It is terrible to have to\r\n  act a farce constantly.” At the first attempt at hypnosis, after\r\n  Bernheim’s method, the patient passes into a state of deep lethargy.\r\n  He proves to be very susceptible to suggestion, and suitable\r\n  suggestions are imparted. After the fourth sitting, he states, with\r\n  gratitude, that men become indifferent, and he begins to have pleasure\r\n  in coitus; but he did not feel mentally satisfied, owing to the fact\r\n  that he was limited to puellæ publicæ. After the fourteenth sitting he\r\n  declared that he required no more treatment. He was in love with a\r\n  young lady, and thought of marrying her. He asked for her hand, and\r\n  was refused. Soon after, while he was on a journey in Italy, men\r\n  interested him again. He had a relapse, and asked for further\r\n  treatment. A few sittings re-established the _status quo ante_.\r\n\r\n  Case 142. _Psychical Hermaphroditism; Successful Treatment by Hypnotic\r\n  Suggestion._—Mr. von Z., aged 29. He asserts that he comes of healthy\r\n  grandparents; of a healthy father, but of a nervous mother. He is an\r\n  only child, and was petted by his mother. At the age of eight he was\r\n  powerfully excited sexually by a male servant, who showed him\r\n  pornographic pictures and his penis.\r\n\r\n  When twelve years old, Z. fell in love with his tutor. On going to\r\n  sleep, the naked form of this man appeared before him. He thought of\r\n  himself as in a female _rôle_ in relation to him, and thought to marry\r\n  him some time.\r\n\r\n  At the age of thirteen, at a private ball, his fancy was excited by a\r\n  young governess, and, at fifteen, he fell in love with a young lady.\r\n  He remained very excitable sensually; but, thereafter, exclusively so\r\n  to men pleasing to him. Masturbation was not practiced.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twenty the patient became neurasthenic (ex\r\n  abstinentia?). He now attempted coitus, but was not successful. On the\r\n  other hand, he had intense desire on an occasion when he saw a naked\r\n  man in a steam-bath. The latter noticed his excitement, approached\r\n  him, and performed masturbation on him, giving the patient intense\r\n  delight. He felt powerfully attracted to this man, and, thereafter,\r\n  allowed him to repeat the act. In the meantime, there were attempts at\r\n  coitus with females, which always ended in a fiasco. The patient was\r\n  much troubled by this, and consulted physicians, who explained his\r\n  impotence as due to nervousness, and thought that it would soon pass\r\n  off.\r\n\r\n  Until his twenty-fifth year his sexual indulgence consisted of\r\n  masturbation by the beloved man about once a month. At this time he\r\n  last felt attracted to a woman. It was to a young peasant-girl. She\r\n  would not accede to his wishes. Since his lover was also unattainable,\r\n  the patient began to masturbate alone. With this, his neurasthenia\r\n  increased. For this reason he was unable to finish his studies; he\r\n  became shy, dysthymic, abulic, and now vainly tried cures at various\r\n  hydropathic establishments. On account of continued severe\r\n  (cerebro-spinal) neurasthenia, the patient came to me for advice, in\r\n  the latter part of February, 1890.\r\n\r\n  A tall, slim man, of aristocratic and decidedly masculine manners.\r\n  Neuropathic appearance; large ears, the lobes of which run into and\r\n  lose themselves in the skin of the cheeks. Genitals perfectly normal.\r\n  The usual picture of cerebro-spinal neurasthenia of moderate degree.\r\n  Great depression; complaint of being dissatisfied with life, even to\r\n  tædium vitæ; he is pained by his sexual anomaly, especially because he\r\n  is urged by his family to marry.\r\n\r\n  He is interested in women only mentally, not physically. Sexually, his\r\n  only interest is in men of distinction. His dreams have never been\r\n  about persons of the opposite sex, but of those of his own sex. In\r\n  these lascivious dreams he has always seen himself in the _rôle_ of a\r\n  woman.\r\n\r\n  The most refined woman has never been able to induce erection or even\r\n  libido in him.\r\n\r\n  His sexual intercourse with men has consisted of passive or mutual\r\n  masturbation. He had practiced solitary onanism only infrequently and\r\n  _faute de mieux_. During the last five months he had abstained, and\r\n  had had no male intercourse since August, 1889.\r\n\r\n  An attempt at hypnosis, after Bernheim’s method, failed; prolonged\r\n  stroking of the brow induced deep lethargy, with catalepsy.\r\n\r\n  This method is used, in order to carry out suggestive treatment of\r\n  this patient, who is so worthy of compassion. The hypnotic state is\r\n  always the same; he cannot be brought into a state of somnambulism.\r\n\r\n  At the third sitting the patient is given the suggestions: ever\r\n  despise onanism and male love; find women beautiful, and dream of\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  After the sixth sitting (March 10th) a moral transformation takes\r\n  place in his mind. The patient becomes quieter, feels more free, and\r\n  dreams now and then of women, and no longer of men, finding that the\r\n  latter have become indifferent to him. He gratefully states that he\r\n  has no more inclination to masturbation. He approaches women, but he\r\n  notices that they have not the least attraction for him.\r\n\r\n  On March 19th, business called the patient home; so that the treatment\r\n  had to be discontinued.\r\n\r\n  On May 17, 1890, the patient returned for treatment. He asserted that\r\n  he had not masturbated in the interval, and that he had resisted his\r\n  inclination to men. Too, he had not dreamed of men, but twice of\r\n  women, though only platonically. His cerebral asthenia (ex\r\n  abstinentia?) had increased. He apparently suffers for the want of\r\n  mental and sensual satisfaction of his vita sexualis; for homo-sexual\r\n  love and masturbation have become impossible for him, and intercourse\r\n  with women is denied him. The patient is thus painfully depressed to\r\n  the extent of tædium vitæ.\r\n\r\n  He is now subjected to anti-neurasthenic treatment (hydro-therapeutic\r\n  and electro-therapeutic), and the treatment by hypnosis is resumed.\r\n  Only after ten weeks of painstaking treatment did the neurasthenic\r\n  symptoms disappear. Progressing parallel with this, there was a change\r\n  of his mental personality.\r\n\r\n  The patient was gratified to note that he grew stronger; that his\r\n  sexual life no longer played a dominating part. Though he felt more\r\n  drawn toward men than women, yet he easily resisted homo-sexual\r\n  desires. His former _boudoir_ became a work-room; instead of to\r\n  adornment and frivolous reading, he gave himself to walks in the\r\n  mountains and forests. On account of the danger of a fiasco, the\r\n  initiative in hetero-sexual attempts was left to the patient.\r\n\r\n  It was not until the fourteenth week of treatment that the patient\r\n  made an attempt. It was perfectly successful. The patient became\r\n  happy, and sound in body and mind, and expressed the best hope of his\r\n  future, even having thoughts of marriage.\r\n\r\n  He experienced increasing pleasure in normal sexual intercourse; he\r\n  occasionally had lascivious dreams of women, and no longer dreamed of\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  The patient stopped treatment at the end of September. He felt\r\n  perfectly normal in hetero-sexual intercourse, devoid of neurasthenia,\r\n  and had thoughts of marriage. Yet he freely confessed that he still\r\n  always had erections at the sight of a naked, handsome man; though he\r\n  could easily resist the desires that arose, and in dreams had\r\n  exclusively “_relations avec la femme_.”\r\n\r\n  In April, 1891, I again saw the patient, and he was in the best of\r\n  health. He regarded his vita sexualis as perfectly normal; for he had\r\n  coitus regularly with pleasure and full virility, dreamed only of\r\n  women, and had no inclination to masturbation. Yet he made the\r\n  interesting confession that frequently, post coitum, he still had a\r\n  temporary “_gout pour l’homme_,” which he could easily control. He\r\n  thought he was lastingly cured, and was occupied with thoughts of\r\n  marriage.\r\n\r\n  Case 143. _Congenital Contrary Sexual Feeling. Successful Removal of\r\n  Homo-Sexual Feelings by Suggestions._—L., doctor of philosophy, aged\r\n  34, German, consulted me, in the spring of 1888, on account of\r\n  perversion of his vita sexualis, and asked whether he could not be\r\n  freed from it by means of hypnotic treatment.\r\n\r\n  Patient came of a healthy mother, in whose family, for generations,\r\n  there had been neither insanity nor nervous disease. He, like his only\r\n  brother, is much like his father mentally. His brother is very\r\n  sensual, and also psychically abnormal, and given to over-indulgence\r\n  in drink.\r\n\r\n  His father was a neuropathic, eccentric man. Nothing is known of any\r\n  abnormal sexual manifestations in him, though, like all his brothers,\r\n  he had a tendency to over-indulgence in alcohol.\r\n\r\n  This vice seems to have been inherited from his mother (grandmother of\r\n  patient), who was a notorious drinker. The father of this woman\r\n  (great-grandfather of patient) was also a great drinker. No other\r\n  ancestral history was obtainable.\r\n\r\n  Patient states that from childhood he was nervous and easily excited.\r\n  He learned very easily, and had a talent for languages. He was always\r\n  interested in art, particularly in music and poetry. His education was\r\n  excellent, and given at home. When he was thirteen, his father told\r\n  him that he should never touch his genitals, for it was wrong to do\r\n  so, and to do it might bring unhappiness.\r\n\r\n  Occasionally his father showed him pictures of syphilitic diseased\r\n  conditions, etc., in an anatomical museum, and the patient was\r\n  disgusted and frightened. He believed that his later fear of sexual\r\n  intercourse with women was partly nourished by this early erroneous\r\n  teaching.\r\n\r\n  However, the patient seeks the principal cause of his sexual\r\n  perversion in a defect of organization. When a small boy, he had a\r\n  silly enthusiasm for companions. He also remembers that, at that time,\r\n  he had a desire only for girlish games, and preferred the society of\r\n  girls. When a boy, he had a passion for crocheting and embroidering.\r\n  At fourteen he was still without any sexual knowledge, and fell into\r\n  the hands of a pederast. He ran away, frightened, when he learned what\r\n  was to be done with him. When fifteen, a sympathetic companion was\r\n  accustomed to lay his head in the patient’s lap. This gave the patient\r\n  a peculiar pleasurable feeling, but he knew no explanation of it. At\r\n  sixteen he had the first erections—at the sight of men.\r\n\r\n  At twenty he first learned that his sexual condition was perverse, and\r\n  recognized the fact that what he had taken for friendship was love. He\r\n  was much frightened at the discovery, and much pained. His sympathies\r\n  were directed toward young men of the upper class that were handsomely\r\n  formed and of pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\n  The society of ladies had no effect on him. He was never attracted by\r\n  the charms of the opposite sex. In his fifteenth year he had a sensual\r\n  dream, in which he thought a girl of elegant figure sat opposite him,\r\n  on a sofa.\r\n\r\n  In the theatre it was only the art of the actresses that he admired;\r\n  the actors excited his real interest.\r\n\r\n  Drinking and smoking had always been very repugnant to him. Hunting\r\n  and gymnastics, and other masculine occupations, had no interest for\r\n  him. He did not enter the army, because his general physical weakness\r\n  precluded it.\r\n\r\n  The patient has but little sexual desire. He has never had any impulse\r\n  to satisfy himself with persons of his own sex. Some years ago, when\r\n  he first tried to embrace a man lovingly, he had powerful erection and\r\n  became greatly excited; but he was able to control himself and to\r\n  repel his lover. Thereafter he always avoided such attempts. It was\r\n  only seldom that he became powerfully excited sexually, and even then\r\n  he was not driven to satisfy himself. He was never given to onanism.\r\n  During the establishment of puberty, the patient had frequent dreams\r\n  with pollutions, but these were not induced by erotic fancies of any\r\n  kind.\r\n\r\n  Some years ago, for a long time, ejaculation was always induced by the\r\n  embrace of a sympathetic man, but this condition of irritable weakness\r\n  disappeared. As years passed, the patient, who had always had a desire\r\n  for marriage and a family, became anxious on account of the conviction\r\n  that the inclination toward females, for which he had hoped, would\r\n  never come. It became more and more clear to him that he was abnormal,\r\n  and he began to have fears about his virility and his future happiness\r\n  in life.\r\n\r\n  In order to test the matter, he sought a brothel. He found a\r\n  prostitute of beautiful form; he had the best will to satisfy himself\r\n  that he was virile; the woman did all she could, but in vain. There\r\n  was no erection, and he withdrew, ashamed. New attempts, under the\r\n  most favorable circumstances, were likewise failures, though the\r\n  patient brought his imagination to his aid, and thought himself to be\r\n  embracing a man instead of a woman.\r\n\r\n  He now realized that his ideal—to consummate marriage—was impossible.\r\n  He felt himself very unfortunate, and dissatisfied with life. Besides,\r\n  it forced itself upon him that morally he was lowered, because he\r\n  could not overcome his inclination for his own sex, and his friendship\r\n  for respectable men of his circle was degraded by sexual feelings. In\r\n  his consultation with me, the patient was unending in the description\r\n  of his painful situation. His ideal was marriage. He longed for it,\r\n  for purely ethical reasons. He thought of it as something holy; but\r\n  the begetting of children, the sexual act, was very repugnant to him.\r\n  At the same time, he saw that he could not really marry without being\r\n  potent. Would not hypnotic suggestion exercise a favorable influence\r\n  on his sexual life? He had not the energy of a man of normal sexual\r\n  condition. He seemed to himself to be all wrong. He would endure\r\n  all—to be poor and miserable—if he could but have a normal sexual\r\n  inclination.\r\n\r\n  When the patient was gently told of the congenital and deep\r\n  constitutional significance of his sexual anomaly, and shown that,\r\n  therefore, the creation of a normal sexual condition was doubtful, he\r\n  thought that he would be satisfied to remain in his condition. But he\r\n  wished to know whether it were not possible to eradicate his\r\n  inclination for men, without attempting to create an equivalent for\r\n  women; and if, in hypnosis, it could not be suggested to him that, in\r\n  the future, men be a matter of indifference to him, and that, in\r\n  intercourse with his friends, he no longer be excited sexually. Such a\r\n  result would elevate very much his moral feeling, and make him\r\n  satisfied and unembarrassed in social relations with his friends.\r\n\r\n  The possibility of such suggestive removal of feelings by hypnosis\r\n  could not be gainsaid, though he was in doubt as to whether he could\r\n  be hypnotized or not, since the hypnoscope had proved to have no\r\n  effect upon him.\r\n\r\n  Out of pity and scientific interest, I decided to make an immediate\r\n  attempt at hypnosis, after Bernheim’s method.\r\n\r\n  The patient passed easily into a condition of deep lethargy, and, in a\r\n  drawling voice, repeated the following suggestion: “I feel that, from\r\n  this time, I am sexually indifferent to men; and, that a man is as\r\n  sexually indifferent to me as a woman.”\r\n\r\n  When I counted three,—having suggested previously that he awake at\r\n  three,—the patient came to himself, as if out of a deep sleep, and\r\n  performed immediately the post-hypnotic suggestion to open the door of\r\n  the stove. He said that he had not lost consciousness entirely, that\r\n  he had felt as one paralyzed and without will, and that he had felt a\r\n  peculiar creeping sensation in all his limbs.\r\n\r\n  After five days the patient came again. In manner he was a different\r\n  person, and he said, joyfully, that he felt like another man. Energy\r\n  and will-power—the loss of which he had felt so keenly—had returned.\r\n  He felt, now, entirely unembarrassed toward men, and had a new joy in\r\n  living.\r\n\r\n  The following seven days he was hypnotized. Hypnosis is no longer as\r\n  deep as at first, though the suggestion is always accepted and\r\n  repeated. However, he is quite profoundly influenced; for, the\r\n  suggestion given, he sleeps on, in a state of lethargy, for ten\r\n  minutes, and has to be awakened by suggestion. This always occurs as\r\n  if from a deep sleep,—slowly, and through a stage of somnolence.\r\n\r\n  After the eighth sitting the patient found himself well and happy, and\r\n  in possession of full self-confidence. He had the feeling and the\r\n  evidence that men had no influence on him.\r\n\r\n  He thought he could dispense with hypnotic treatment, and gratefully\r\n  took his leave, with the promise that, should the influence of the\r\n  suggestion fade, he would come again. Since then, I have heard nothing\r\n  more of this interesting patient, and I have reason to hope that he\r\n  remains improved.\r\n\r\n  The patient is, in all respects, of masculine appearance; beard\r\n  abundant. Physically, with the exception of slight neurasthenic\r\n  symptoms, he presents nothing remarkable. Genitals normal. (Personal\r\n  case. _Internat. Centralblatt_, etc., Bd. i, Heft 1.)\r\n\r\n  Case 144. X., aged 33; single; tall. Mentally, of small endowment;\r\n  comes of tainted family. Paternal grandfather died at thirty-four with\r\n  a mental disease, which is said to have developed as a result of\r\n  onanism and spermatorrhœa. His father and brother suffered with\r\n  disturbances of the sexual functions. There was insanity in the\r\n  mother’s family; other branches of the family were noted for their\r\n  irritable and eccentric character.\r\n\r\n  The patient has too small a head, a retreating brow, abnormal ears,\r\n  sparse growth of hair, and a hernia, which is probably congenital.\r\n  Genitals large, and normally developed.\r\n\r\n  Great impressionability; neuropathic constitution; occasional tædium\r\n  vitæ. For several years, peculiar, imperative ideas: that he is a\r\n  locomotive; a horse; a velocipede; and, that he must act accordingly.\r\n  From his earliest youth, contrary sexual feeling (congenital). Horror\r\n  feminæ; sexual inclination toward boys; satisfaction by sensual\r\n  contact, and, _faute de mieux_, masturbation. One day he had an affair\r\n  with a boy dressed in gray, which made a deep impression on him. Since\r\n  then, while masturbating, the image of the boy comes into his mind;\r\n  and he cannot see gray clothes without having powerful erections. On\r\n  the advice of physicians whom he consulted, he attempted coitus with\r\n  women, but was cold and impotent, notwithstanding the assistance of\r\n  memory-pictures of the boy dressed in gray; and he finally gave up the\r\n  efforts.\r\n\r\n  March 27th, first hypnotic sitting. Small result. He resists, and says\r\n  his fancy keeps him from going to sleep.\r\n\r\n  In a further series of sittings he declares that he experiences\r\n  unfavorable effects,—is more excited, and troubled by imperative ideas\r\n  and the desire to masturbate. He makes fun of the physician and\r\n  hypnotism, and offers much resistance, with the expression that\r\n  hypnotism is good for nothing, and only makes people crazy.\r\n\r\n  However, gradually it became possible to induce somnambulism. After\r\n  twenty-five sittings the patient confessed that he was better, and\r\n  that he was less troubled with imperative ideas and onanism. The\r\n  sittings were repeated every week or two. The patient felt mentally\r\n  and morally well, ceased to masturbate, but, at the end of treatment,\r\n  was indifferent toward the opposite sex (Dr. Ladame, _Revue de\r\n  l’hypnotisme_, September 1, 1889).\r\n\r\nIn the two foregoing cases there was successful suggestive removal of\r\nhomo-sexual feelings,—a result which, as Case 143 shows, means a great\r\nimprovement for such unfortunate individuals, in that it protects them\r\nfrom shame and the law. An entirely different and phenomenal result is\r\npresented by the following case, reported by Dr. v. Schrenk-Notzing in\r\nthe _Wiener internat. klin. Rundschau_, October 6, 1889, No. 40, which\r\nis a case of effemination. It discloses a new method of treatment of\r\nurnings; but it is necessary to guard against illusions. Only where\r\nhypnosis can be deepened to somnambulism, are decided and lasting\r\nresults to be expected:—\r\n\r\n  Case 145. _Congenital Contrary Sexual Instinct Improved by Hypnotic\r\n  Suggestion._—R., official, aged 28. January 20, 1888, he sought\r\n  medical advice. He is the brother of the patient who is the subject of\r\n  Case 135, and, therefore, of a badly tainted family (_v. supra_).\r\n  Toward the end of treatment, he confessed that he was the author of\r\n  the autobiography which was published as Case 83 in the fifth edition\r\n  of this work, and it is here reproduced:—\r\n\r\n  “In brief, my abnormality consists of this, that in sexual relations I\r\n  feel myself to be completely feminine. Since my earliest youth, in my\r\n  sexual acts and fancies, I have always had before my eyes only images\r\n  of masculine beings and masculine genitals.\r\n\r\n  “Until I went to the University, I found nothing in this (I had never\r\n  spoken with others about my fancies, but rather, while at the\r\n  Gymnasium, lived a silent and retired life).\r\n\r\n  “While at the University, it struck me that female persons made not\r\n  the slightest impression on me. Since then, in houses of prostitution,\r\n  etc., I have attempted coitus, or only to obtain an erection, with\r\n  women, but always in vain.\r\n\r\n  “Erection ceased immediately, as soon as I was in a room alone with a\r\n  woman. At first I considered it impotence, though, at the same time, I\r\n  was so excited sexually that I had to masturbate several times during\r\n  the day in order to sleep.\r\n\r\n  “Quite different, however, has been the development of my feelings\r\n  toward the masculine sex, and it has grown stronger every year. At\r\n  first they expressed themselves in extraordinary, enthusiastic\r\n  friendship for certain persons, under whose windows at night I would\r\n  wait for hours; whom in all possible ways I would try to meet on the\r\n  streets, and with whom I sought to come in contact. I wrote such\r\n  persons the most passionate letters, in which, however, I was shy in\r\n  expressing my feelings too plainly. Later, after my twentieth year, I\r\n  came to understand the essential nature of my inclinations,\r\n  particularly from the sensual pleasure I experienced as soon as I came\r\n  in direct contact with any of these friends. These persons were all\r\n  finely built men, with dark hair and eyes. I have never had my\r\n  feelings excited by boys. Real pederasty is absolutely\r\n  incomprehensible to me. About this time (twenty-second to twenty-third\r\n  year) the circle of my beloved friends grew more and more extensive.\r\n  Now I can scarcely see a handsome man on the street without having the\r\n  wish to possess him excited in me. The fact is, I especially love\r\n  persons of the lower classes, whose powerful forms attract\r\n  me,—soldiers, policemen, car-drivers, etc.,—_i.e._, all that wear\r\n  uniforms. If one of these returns my look, I feel a kind of thrill go\r\n  through my whole body. I am especially excitable in the evening, and\r\n  merely the heavy tread of a soldier is alone sufficient to induce the\r\n  most powerful erections. I take a very peculiar pleasure in following\r\n  such persons and looking at them. As soon as I learn that they are\r\n  married, or that they consort with girls, my excitement very\r\n  frequently ceases.\r\n\r\n  “A few months ago I became able to control my inclinations to such an\r\n  extent that they were not directly noticeable. About this time I\r\n  followed a soldier who seemed likely to acquiesce in my desire, and\r\n  spoke to him. For money he was ready for anything. At once I was\r\n  filled with a most violent longing to embrace and kiss him, and the\r\n  danger of being noticed did not deter me from doing it. He had\r\n  scarcely grasped my genitals when ejaculation followed. With this\r\n  meeting, I had finally attained the long-desired goal of my life. I\r\n  knew that my whole nature would find its happiness and satisfaction in\r\n  it, and from this time I gave myself up entirely to the effort to find\r\n  a person whom I could love, and from whom I should never part. For my\r\n  acts I do not experience the slightest twinge of conscience.\r\n\r\n  “To be sure, in quiet moments, I very well appreciate the difference\r\n  between my way of thinking and the way of the world; as a lawyer, too,\r\n  I naturally recognize the dangers of a relation of the kind I desire;\r\n  but, as long as my entire nature does not change, I shall not be able\r\n  to give up the opportunities offered me. Nevertheless, I should be\r\n  willing to undergo any cure to be freed from my abnormal condition.\r\n\r\n  “I recognize my feminine feeling, among other things, in the fact that\r\n  any sensual idea in connection with a woman must be forced, and seems\r\n  unnatural to me. I am also sure that my respect for a woman—I move\r\n  much in the society of ladies, and enjoy it—would change immediately\r\n  to repugnance, were I to notice any sensual inclination in her toward\r\n  me. In my dreams and sensual fancies of men, I always think of myself\r\n  in such positions with them that their faces are always toward mine.\r\n  My greatest delight would be to have a powerful man, undressed, take\r\n  me in his arms with a force I could not resist. In such situations I\r\n  always think of myself in a passive _rôle_, and have to force my\r\n  feelings, in order to think of myself in any other position. In this,\r\n  I am truly feminine. Great as my desire may be to approach certain\r\n  persons, my struggle is as great not to allow this to be noticed.\r\n  Moustaches, abundance of hair, and even dirt, seem to be especially\r\n  enticing. It is hardly necessary to say that, to me, my condition,\r\n  with reference to society, is absolutely desperate; and, if I had not\r\n  the hope of finding a being that would understand me, life would be\r\n  scarcely endurable. I feel that sexual commerce with a man is the only\r\n  means of successfully combating my impulse to onanism. Though this has\r\n  a very bad effect on me, I cannot keep myself from it constantly,\r\n  because, as I have often found, I will be even more weakened by\r\n  pollutions at night and persistent erections during the day.\r\n\r\n  “Up to this time I have truly loved but two men. Both were officers,\r\n  remarkably endowed mentally, handsomely and gracefully formed, and of\r\n  dark skin and eyes. I became acquainted with the first at the\r\n  University. I was madly in love with him, and suffered unspeakably on\r\n  account of his indifference. I spent nights under his window, simply\r\n  to be near him. When he was officially transferred, I was in despair.\r\n\r\n  “Soon after, I became acquainted with an officer that resembled him,\r\n  who likewise enchained me at first sight. I sought every opportunity\r\n  to meet him, spent the day in the streets, and at places where I hoped\r\n  to get a sight of him. I knew how the blood came into my face when,\r\n  unsuspected, I saw him. When I saw him friendly with others, I could\r\n  scarcely contain myself for jealousy. When I sat near him, I was\r\n  impelled to touch him. I could scarcely conceal my excitement when I\r\n  touched his knee or thigh. I never ventured, however, to express my\r\n  feelings to him; for, from his conduct, I was convinced that he would\r\n  not understand them or share them.\r\n\r\n  “I am twenty-seven years old, of medium height, and well-developed,\r\n  and would be considered handsome. My chest is somewhat narrow, hands\r\n  and feet small, and voice weak. Mentally, I think I am well endowed;\r\n  for I passed the State examination with distinction, speak several\r\n  languages, and am a good painter.\r\n\r\n  “In my calling I pass for one that is industrious and conscientious.\r\n  My acquaintances think me cold and peculiar. I do not smoke, do not\r\n  play games, and cannot sing or whistle. My gait, like my voice, is\r\n  somewhat affected. I have much taste for elegance, love adornment,\r\n  sweetmeats, and perfumes, and prefer the society of ladies.”\r\n\r\n  From Dr. von Schrenk’s notes of the case, it is learned, further, that\r\n  social and criminal deterrents, on the one hand, and uncontrollable\r\n  desire for his own sex, on the other, caused violent mental struggles,\r\n  and made life unendurable. For this reason the patient confided in the\r\n  physician. January 22, 1889, hypnotic treatment, with suggestion,\r\n  after the method of Nancy, was begun with the patient. Gradually it\r\n  became possible to induce somnambulism.\r\n\r\n  The suggestions were made with reference to indifference to men, and\r\n  ability to resist them, and to increase of interest in women;\r\n  masturbation was thus forbidden, and women substituted for men in\r\n  lascivious dreams. After a few sittings pleasure at sight of women was\r\n  induced. At the seventh sitting successful coitus was suggested; this\r\n  was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n  During the next three months the patient remained, under the influence\r\n  of occasional hypnotic suggestions, in the full possession of normal\r\n  sexual functions. April 22, 1889, there was a relapse, induced by a\r\n  companion. At the next sitting, remorse and shame. As expiation,\r\n  coitus with a woman in the presence of his seducer.\r\n\r\n  The patient complained that coitus with women below him in station did\r\n  not satisfy his æsthetic feelings. He hoped to find satisfaction in a\r\n  happy marriage. After forty-five sittings (May 2, 1889) the patient\r\n  considered himself cured. Treatment ceased. He became engaged to a\r\n  young lady some weeks later, and presented himself again, after six\r\n  months, as a happy bridegroom. He thought that, in his happiness with\r\n  his wife, he had a sure preventive against relapse.\r\n\r\n  The author emphasizes the fact that the hypnotic treatment had no\r\n  injurious collateral effect, and leaves undecided the question as to\r\n  whether the cure is permanent or not, with R.’s very bad heredity. But\r\n  he expresses the conviction that, in case of relapse, renewed hypnotic\r\n  treatment would not be contra-indicated.\r\n\r\nSince the incredible result of this case interested me exceedingly, as\r\ndid its further course, I wrote to the author, requesting information\r\nconcerning his patient.\r\n\r\nDr. v. Schrenk very kindly placed at my disposal the following letter,\r\nwhich he had received from the patient in January, 1890:—\r\n\r\n  “By means of suggestive treatment given me by Baron Schrenk, for the\r\n  first time I became possessed of the psychical condition that\r\n  permitted me to have intercourse with a woman, which, up to that time,\r\n  in spite of repeated efforts, I had been unable to do successfully.\r\n\r\n  “Since my æsthetic needs were unsatisfied by intercourse with\r\n  prostitutes, I thought to find my real salvation in matrimony. The\r\n  earlier friendly inclination toward a lady known in my youth offered\r\n  me the opportunity, the more because I believed that she, of all\r\n  others, would be in a position to awaken feelings for the opposite sex\r\n  which were absolutely foreign to me. Her character,—_i.e._, our\r\n  harmony,—is in such accord with my inclinations that I am fully\r\n  convinced that I shall also find complete psychical satisfaction. This\r\n  conviction has not changed during the eight months of my engagement.\r\n\r\n  “I intend to be married in about four weeks.\r\n\r\n  “As far as my position with respect of my own sex is concerned, my\r\n  power of resistance—and this is the lasting positive result of this\r\n  treatment—is absolutely changed in degree. While previously it was\r\n  impossible for me to overcome an intense sexual excitation when I saw\r\n  a finely formed car-driver, to-day, in the company of my former\r\n  lovers, I am without sexual excitement. At the same time, I must add\r\n  that now, as formerly, their society has a certain attraction for me,\r\n  though it is not to be compared with my earlier passion.\r\n\r\n  “On the other hand, I have refused repeated persuasions to indulge in\r\n  sexual intercourse with men, without expending much force in\r\n  resistance,—persuasions which formerly I should have been unable to\r\n  resist. I may say, indeed, that it is a feeling of compassion for my\r\n  former lovers, that have proved their passionate devotion to me, which\r\n  keeps me from directly repulsing them. My action seems to be due to a\r\n  feeling of duty, rather than to inner need.\r\n\r\n  “Since the conclusion of treatment, I have not consorted with\r\n  prostitutes. This circumstance, and the numerous letters and\r\n  persuasions from my former lover, may well be the reason why, in the\r\n  eight months that have elapsed, I have allowed him to persuade me to\r\n  sexual intercourse on three or four occasions. At these times I have\r\n  always been conscious of being completely master of myself, as\r\n  compared with my earlier passionate condition in like situations, as\r\n  the violent reproaches of my friend convinced me. _I always feel a\r\n  certain unconquerable repugnance, which cannot be based on moral\r\n  grounds, but which, I believe, must be attributed to the treatment._ I\r\n  no longer feel a love for him in the former sense. Besides, since the\r\n  treatment, I have sought no opportunities for sexual intercourse with\r\n  men, and I feel no need of it. But, formerly, not a day passed on\r\n  which I did not feel impelled to it, so that at times I was unable to\r\n  think of anything else. Awake or dreaming, ideas of sexual content are\r\n  very infrequent.\r\n\r\n  “I may express the belief that my marriage, that is to take place in a\r\n  few weeks, and the much desired change of place that is bound to it,\r\n  will entirely remove the residuum of my earlier condition. I conclude\r\n  these lines with the honest assurance that, subjectively, I am another\r\n  man, and that this change has restored the mental equilibrium that was\r\n  previously wanting.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing words, which Dr. v. Schrenk completes with the verbal\r\nstatement of the patient that he had not practiced onanism again, are a\r\nbrilliant proof of the lasting effect of post-hypnotic suggestion. I\r\nconsider the hetero-sexual instinct of the patient to be the artificial\r\ncreation of his excellent physician; and the patient himself seems to\r\nrecognize this, in that he speaks of a repugnance which “does not rest\r\non moral grounds, but which depends on the treatment.”\r\n\r\nThe further fate of this interesting patient may be learned from the\r\nfollowing letter, kindly submitted by Dr. v. Schrenk:—\r\n\r\n  “Honored Sir: Having been home some days from my wedding-journey, I\r\n  wish to send you a short report of my present condition. During the\r\n  week before my wedding I was in great excitement, because I feared\r\n  that I should be unable to perform certain duties. The impelling\r\n  thoughts of my friend, who wished another meeting with me, at any\r\n  price, had no effect on me. We had not seen each other since I heard\r\n  from you last. [Receipt of the professor’s letter.] However, I was\r\n  much troubled with the thought that my marriage must be unhappy. Now,\r\n  however, I have no anxiety. To be sure, on the first night, success\r\n  was difficult,—to induce sexual excitation in myself,—but on the\r\n  following night, and since, the influences needed for a normal man, I\r\n  believe, would have been sufficient for me. I am also convinced that\r\n  the harmony between us, which, of course, is mentally of long\r\n  standing, will become more and more complete. A relapse to the former\r\n  condition seems impossible. It is, perhaps, significant for my present\r\n  condition, that I one night dreamed of my former lover, and that the\r\n  dream was not sensual, and did not excite me sensually.\r\n\r\n  “I am satisfied with my present circumstances. I am, of course, well\r\n  aware that my present inclinations are far from being of a degree\r\n  equal to what they formerly were. I believe, however, that they will\r\n  daily grow stronger. Already my former life is incomprehensible, and I\r\n  cannot understand why I did not earlier think to overcome the abnormal\r\n  sexual instinct by normal sexual indulgence. A relapse would now be\r\n  possible only with an entire change of my mental life; and, in a word,\r\n  it seems impossible.\r\n\r\n                                      “Your obedient servant,      ——d.”\r\n\r\nFrom a letter of Dr. v. Schrenk’s, of December 7th, I extract the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n  “In this case the cure seems to be of longer duration than I expected;\r\n  for, on speaking with the patient, some months ago, he said that he\r\n  was perfectly happy in marriage, and, as I hear, he expects soon the\r\n  happiness of a father.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. v. Schrenk has reported in the _Wiener internationalen klinischen\r\n  Rundschau_, 1891, No. 26, later and very interesting facts concerning\r\n  his patient, which, therapeutically, are very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IV. SPECIAL PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ABNORMAL SEXUAL LIFE IN THE VARIOUS FORMS AND\r\n                     STATES OF MENTAL DISTURBANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ARREST OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nSexual life in idiots is, in general, but slightly developed. It is\r\nwanting entirely in idiots of high grade. In such instances the genitals\r\nare frequently small and deformed, and menstruation is late or does not\r\noccur at all. There is impotence, or sterility, as the case may be. Even\r\nin idiots of low grade, sexuality is not prominent. In infrequent cases\r\nit is manifested with a certain periodicity, and then with greater\r\nintensity. It may then be expressed impulsively, and be violently\r\nsatisfied. Perversions of the sexual instinct do not occur at the lowest\r\nlevels of mental development.\r\n\r\nWhen the desire for sexual satisfaction is opposed in these cases, great\r\npassion is excited, with danger of murderous assault on the persons\r\nattacked. It is to be expected that idiots should not exercise choice,\r\nand they attempt to satisfy the sexual instinct on their nearest\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n  Thus Marc-Ideler reports the case of an idiot who attempted to rape\r\n  his sister, and had almost strangled her when he was discovered.\r\n\r\n  Friedreich reports an analogous case (_Friedreich’s Blätter_, 1858, p.\r\n  50).\r\n\r\n  I have repeatedly had occasion to give opinions in cases of attempts\r\n  to rape little girls.\r\n\r\n  Giraud (_Annal. méd. psych._, 1885, Nr. 1) also reports a case of this\r\n  kind. Consciousness of the significance of the act is always wanting;\r\n  an instinctive knowledge that such obscene acts are not publicly\r\n  permitted is often present, and causes the attempted sexual act to be\r\n  undertaken in a deserted place.\r\n\r\nIn imbeciles the sexual instinct is usually developed as in normal\r\nindividuals. The moral inhibitory ideas are cloudy, and, therefore, the\r\nsexual impulse is more or less openly manifested. For this reason\r\nimbeciles are sources of disturbance in society. Abnormal intensity and\r\nperversion of the sexual instinct are infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent manner of satisfaction of the sexual desire is\r\nonanism. The weak-minded seldom make sexual attacks on adults of the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\nSexual satisfaction with animals is frequently attempted. The great\r\nmajority of cases of injury (sexual) to animals must be attributed to\r\nimbeciles. Children are quite often their victims.\r\n\r\n  Emminghaus (Maschka’s Handb. iv., p. 234) draws attention to the\r\n  frequency of open manifestation of sexual instinct, which comprises\r\n  open masturbation, exhibition of the genitals, attacks on children and\r\n  those of the same sex, and sodomy.\r\n\r\nGiraud (_Annal. méd. psychol._, 1855, Nr. 1) has reported a whole series\r\nof immoral attacks on children:—\r\n\r\n  1. H., aged 17, imbecile, enticed a little girl into a barn, by giving\r\n  her nuts. There he exposed her genitals and showed his own, making\r\n  movements of coitus on the child’s abdomen. He had no idea of the\r\n  moral significance of the act.\r\n\r\n  2. L., aged 21; imbecile; degenerate. While he was watching cattle,\r\n  his sister of eleven years, with a playmate of eight years, came and\r\n  told him how some unknown man had attempted to do them violence. L.\r\n  led the children to a deserted house and attempted coitus with the\r\n  younger child, but let her go because no emission occurred, and\r\n  because the child cried out. On the way home he promised to marry her\r\n  if she would not say anything. At the trial he thought that by\r\n  marriage he could right the wrong he had done.[119]\r\n\r\n  3. G., aged 21, microcephalic, imbecile, has masturbated since his\r\n  sixth year, and practiced active and passive pederasty. He has\r\n  repeatedly tried to perform pederasty with boys, and attacked little\r\n  girls. He was absolutely without an understanding of his acts. His\r\n  sexual desire was manifested periodically and intensely, as in\r\n  animals.[120]\r\n\r\n  4. B., aged 21; imbecile. While alone in a forest with his sister of\r\n  nineteen, he demanded that she allow coitus. She refused. He\r\n  threatened to strangle her, and stabbed her with a knife. The\r\n  frightened girl fondled his penis, and he then left her and quietly\r\n  went on with his work. B. has a deformed, microcephalic skull, and has\r\n  no sense of the significance of his act.\r\n\r\nEmminghaus (_op. cit._, p. 234) reports the case of an exhibitionist:—\r\n\r\n  Case 146. A man, aged 40, married, had for sixteen years been\r\n  accustomed to exhibit himself in parks, at dusk, to little girls and\r\n  servants, and drew their attention to himself by whistling. After\r\n  having been frequently punished for it, he avoided the places, but he\r\n  carried on his practice elsewhere. Hydrocephalus. Mental weakness of\r\n  slight degree. Mild sentence passed.\r\n\r\n  Case 147. X., of tainted family; imbecile; defective and perverted in\r\n  intellect, feeling, and will. For help and protection he was brought\r\n  before an officer. It was complained that he had repeatedly exposed\r\n  his genitals to servant-girls, and had shown himself at windows with\r\n  the upper portion of his body naked. No other manifestations of sexual\r\n  instinct. No onanism reported. (Sander, _Archiv f. Psych._, i, p.\r\n  655.)\r\n\r\n  Case 148. _Pederasty with a Child._—On April 8, 1884, at ten o’clock\r\n  A.M., while X. was sitting on the street, holding a boy of eighteen\r\n  months on her lap, a certain Vallario approached and took the child\r\n  from X., saying he was going to take it for a walk. He went the\r\n  distance of half a kilometre, and returned, saying that the child had\r\n  fallen from his arms, and thus injured its anus. The anus was torn,\r\n  and blood was pouring from it. At the place where the deed was done,\r\n  traces of semen were found. V. confessed his horrible crime, and, at\r\n  his final trial, he acted so strangely that an examination of his\r\n  mental condition was made. He had impressed the prison attendants as\r\n  being an imbecile. V., aged 45, mason, defective morally and\r\n  intellectually, is dolicho-microcephalic; has narrow, deformed facial\r\n  bones, and the halves of the face and the ears are asymmetrical; the\r\n  brow is low and retreating; genitals normal. V. shows general\r\n  diminution of cutaneous sensibility, is imbecile, and has no ideas. He\r\n  lives in the present, has no ambition, and does nothing of his own\r\n  will. He has no desires and no emotional feeling. He has never had\r\n  coitus. Nothing more could be ascertained about his vita sexualis.\r\n  Proofs of intellectual and moral idiocy, due to microcephaly; the\r\n  crime is referred to a perverse, uncontrollable sexual impulse. Sent\r\n  to an asylum. (Virgilio, _il Manicomio_, V. year, No. 3.)\r\n\r\nA case mentioned by L. Meyer (_Arch. f. Psych._, Bd. i, p. 103) shows\r\nhow female imbeciles may indulge in shameless prostitution and\r\nimmorality.[121]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  STATES OF ACQUIRED MENTAL WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\nThe numerous anomalies of the vita sexualis in senile dementia have been\r\ndescribed in the section on “General Pathology.” In other conditions of\r\nacquired mental weakness,—those due to apoplexy; trauma capitis; to the\r\nsecondary stages of psychoses; or to inflammatory processes in the\r\ncortex (lues, paretic dementia),—perversions of the sexual instinct seem\r\nto be infrequent; and here the immoral sexual acts seem to depend on\r\nabnormally increased or uninhibited sexual feeling, which, in itself, is\r\nnot abnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                (1) _Dementia Consecutive to Psychoses._\r\n\r\nCasper (_Klin. Novellen_, Fall 31) reports a case that belongs here. It\r\nis that of a physician, aged 33, who attempted rape on a child. He was\r\nweakened mentally, as a result of hypochondriacal melancholia. He\r\nexcused his deed in a very silly way, and had no appreciation of the\r\nmoral and criminal meaning of the act, which was apparently the result\r\nof a sexual impulse that could not be controlled on account of his\r\nmental weakness.\r\n\r\nCase 21, in Liman’s _Zweifelhafte Geisteszuständen_, is an analogous\r\ncase (dementia after melancholia; offense against morals by exhibition).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     (2) _Dementia After Apoplexy._\r\n\r\n  Case 149. B., aged 52. He passed through a cerebral attack, and was no\r\n  longer able to carry on his business as a merchant.\r\n\r\n  One day, in the absence of his wife, he locked two girls in the house,\r\n  gave them liquors to drink, and then carried out sexual acts with the\r\n  children. He commanded them to say nothing, and went to his business.\r\n  The medical expert established mental weakness, resulting from\r\n  repeated apoplexies. B., who, up to this time, had been wellbehaved,\r\n  says he committed the criminal act because of an uncontrollable and\r\n  incomprehensible impulse; and that, when he came to himself, he was\r\n  ashamed, and sent the girls away. Since his apoplectic attack, B. had\r\n  been weak-minded, incapable of business, and hemiplegic; but, soon\r\n  after arrest, he made an unskillful attempt at suicide. He often cried\r\n  childishly. His moral and intellectual energy in opposing his sensual\r\n  impulses was certainly much weakened. No sentence. (Giraud, _Ann. méd.\r\n  Psychol._ March, 1881.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (3) _Dementia After Injury of Head._\r\n\r\n  Case 150. K., when fourteen years old, was injured on the head by a\r\n  horse. The skull was fractured in several places, and several pieces\r\n  of bone required removal.\r\n\r\n  From that time K. was weak mentally, passionate, and ill-tempered.\r\n  Gradually he developed an inordinate and truly beastly sensuality,\r\n  which drove him to the most immoral acts. One day he raped a girl of\r\n  twelve, and strangled her for fear of discovery. Arrested, he\r\n  confessed. The medical experts declared him responsible, and he was\r\n  executed.\r\n\r\n  The autopsy revealed ossification of almost all the sutures,\r\n  remarkable asymmetry of the halves of the skull, and evidences of\r\n  healed fractures. The affected hemisphere had bands of cicatricial\r\n  tissue running through it, and was one-third smaller than the other.\r\n  (_Friedreich’s Blätter_, 1885, Heft 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Acquired Mental Weakness, Probably Resulting from Lues._\r\n\r\n  Case 151. X., officer, had repeatedly committed immoral acts with\r\n  little girls; among other things, he had induced them to perform\r\n  manustupration on him, had exposed his genitals, and handled theirs.\r\n\r\n  X., formerly healthy, and of blameless life, was infected with\r\n  syphilis in 1867. In 1879 paralysis of the left abducens occurred.\r\n  Thereafter mental weakness was noticed, with a change of his\r\n  disposition and character. Headache, occasional incoherence of speech,\r\n  failure of power of thought and logic, occasional inequality of\r\n  pupils, and paresis of the right facial muscles, were observed.\r\n\r\n  X., aged 37, shows no trace of lues when examined. The paralysis of\r\n  the left abducens is still present. The left eye is amblyopic. He is\r\n  mentally weak. Concerning the trial that was before him, he said it\r\n  was nothing but a harmless misunderstanding. Indications of aphasia.\r\n  Weakness of memory, particularly for recent events. Superficial\r\n  emotional reaction; rapid exhaustion of memory and ability to speak.\r\n  Proved: that the ethical defect and the perverse sexual impulse are\r\n  the symptoms of an abnormal condition of brain induced by lues.\r\n\r\n  Suspension of criminal proceedings. (Personal case. _Jahrbücher für\r\n  Psychiatrie._)\r\n\r\n(5) _Paretic Dementia._\r\n\r\nHere the sexual life is usually abnormally affected; in the incipient\r\nstages of the disease, as well as in episodical states of excitement, it\r\nis intensified, and sometimes perverse. In the final stages libido and\r\nsexual power usually become _nil_.\r\n\r\nJust as in the prodromal stage of the senile forms, one sees here, in\r\nconnection with more or less evident losses in the moral and\r\nintellectual spheres, expressions of an apparently intensified sexual\r\ninstinct (obscene talk, openness in intercourse with the opposite sex,\r\nthoughts of marriage, frequenting of brothels, etc.), which is\r\ncharacteristic of the clouding of consciousness.\r\n\r\nSeduction, abduction, and public scandal are here the order of the day.\r\nAt first there is still some appreciation of the circumstances, though\r\nthe cynicism of the acts is striking enough. As the mental weakness\r\nincreases, such patients become criminal by reason of exhibition,\r\nmasturbation in the streets, and attempts at immoral acts with children.\r\n\r\nIf conditions of mental excitement come on, attempts at rape are\r\ncommitted, or, at least, grossly immoral acts,—the patient attacks women\r\non the street, appears in public in very imperfect dress; or,\r\nhalf-clothed, tries to force his way into strange houses, to cohabit\r\nwith the wife of an acquaintance, or to marry the daughter on the spot.\r\n\r\n  Numerous cases belonging to this category are cited by Tardieu\r\n  (“Attentats aux moeurs”); Mendel (“Progressive Paralyse der Irren,”\r\n  1880, p. 123); Westphal (_Arch. f. Psych._, vii, p. 622); and a case\r\n  by Petrucci (_Annal. méd. Psychol._, 1875) shows that bigamy may also\r\n  occur here.\r\n\r\n  The brutal disregard of consequences with which the patients in the\r\n  advanced stages attempt to satisfy their sexual instinct, is\r\n  characteristic.\r\n\r\n  In a case reported by Legrand (“La folie,” p. 519), the father of a\r\n  family was found masturbating in the open street. After the act he\r\n  consumed his semen.\r\n\r\n  A patient seen by me, an officer, of a prominent family, in broad\r\n  daylight, made attacks on little girls at a watering-place.\r\n\r\n  A similar case is reported by Dr. Régis (“De la dynamie ou exaltation\r\n  fonctionnelle au début de la paral. gén.,” 1878).\r\n\r\n  Cases reported by Tarnowsky (_op. cit._, p. 82) show that also\r\n  pederasty and bestiality may occur in the prodromal stages and course\r\n  of this malady.\r\n\r\n_Epilepsy._—Epilepsy is allied to the acquired states of mental weakness\r\nbecause it often leads to them, and then all the possibilities of\r\nreckless satisfaction of the sexual impulse that have been mentioned may\r\noccur. Moreover, in many epileptics the sexual instinct is very intense.\r\nFor the most part, it is satisfied by masturbation, now and then by\r\nattacks on children, and by pederasty. Perversion of the instinct with\r\nperverse sexual acts seems to be infrequent.\r\n\r\nMuch more important are the numerous cases in literature in which\r\nepileptics, who, during intervals, present no signs of active sexual\r\nimpulse, but manifest it in connection with epileptic attacks, or during\r\nthe time of equivalent or post-epileptic exceptional mental states.\r\nThese cases have scarcely yet been studied clinically, and forensically\r\nnot at all; but they deserve careful study. In this way certain cases of\r\nviolence and rape would be understood, and legal murders prevented.\r\n\r\nFrom the following facts, it will certainly be clear that the cerebral\r\nchanges which accompany the epileptic outbreak may induce an abnormal\r\nexcitation of the sexual instinct. Besides, in the exceptional mental\r\nstates of epileptics, they are unable to resist their impulses, by\r\nreason of the disturbance of consciousness.\r\n\r\n  For years I have known a young epileptic, of bad heredity, who, always\r\n  after frequent epileptic seizures, attacks his mother, and tries to\r\n  violate her.[122] After a time he comes to himself, and has no memory\r\n  of his acts. In the intervals he is very strict in morals, and has but\r\n  slight sexual inclination.\r\n\r\n  Some years ago I became acquainted with a young peasant, who, during\r\n  epileptic attacks, masturbated shamelessly, but during the intervals\r\n  was above reproach.\r\n\r\n  Simon (“Crimes et délits,” p. 220) mentions an epileptic girl of\r\n  twenty-three, well educated, and of the best morals, who, in attacks\r\n  of vertigo, would shout out obscene words, then raise her dress, make\r\n  lascivious movements, and try to tear open her under-garments.\r\n\r\n  Kiernan (_Alienist and Neurologist_, January, 1884) reports the case\r\n  of an epileptic who always had, as an aura, the vision of a beautiful\r\n  woman in lascivious attitudes, which induced ejaculation. After some\r\n  years, with treatment with potassium bromide, the vision was changed\r\n  to that of a devil attacking him with a pitchfork. The instant this\r\n  reached him, he became unconscious.\r\n\r\n  The same author speaks of a very respectable man who had, two or three\r\n  times a year, epileptic attacks of furor and dysthymia, with impulses\r\n  to pederasty, which lasted a week or two; and of a lady who, with\r\n  epilepsy that came on during the climacterium, had sexual desire for\r\n  boys.\r\n\r\n  Case 152. W., of good heredity, previously healthy; before and after,\r\n  sound mentally, quiet, kind, temperate. On April 18, 1877, he had no\r\n  appetite. On the 14th, in the presence of his wife and children, he\r\n  demanded coitus, first of his wife’s friend, who was present, then of\r\n  his wife. Taken away, he had an epileptoid attack; after this he\r\n  became wildly maniacal and destructive, threw hot water on those that\r\n  tried to approach him, and threw a child in the stove. Then he soon\r\n  became quiet, but for some days remained confused, and finally came to\r\n  himself with no memory of the events of his attack. (Kowalewsky,\r\n  _Jahrbücher f. Psych._, 1879.)\r\n\r\n  Another case, examined by Casper (_Klin. Novellen_, p. 267), may be\r\n  attributed to epilepsy (larvated). A respectable man attacked four\r\n  women, one after another, in the open street (once before two\r\n  witnesses), and violated one of them, “notwithstanding that his young,\r\n  pretty, and healthy wife” lived hard by.\r\n\r\nThe epileptic significance of the sexual acts in the following cases is\r\nunequivocal:—\r\n\r\n  Case 153. L., official, aged 40; a kind husband and father. During\r\n  four years he has offended public morals twenty-five times, for which\r\n  he has had to endure long imprisonment.\r\n\r\n  In the first seven complaints he was accused of exposing his genitals\r\n  to girls from eleven to thirteen years old, while riding by them, and\r\n  calling their attention by obscene words. While in confinement, he had\r\n  exposed his genitals at a window which opened on a popular street.\r\n\r\n  L.’s father was insane; his brother was once met on the street wearing\r\n  only a shirt. During his military service L. had had two attacks of\r\n  severe fainting. Since 1859 he had suffered with peculiar attacks of\r\n  vertigo, at such times becoming weak, tremulous, and deathly pale; it\r\n  grew dark before his eyes, and he saw bright stars, and was forced to\r\n  get support in order to keep upright. After violent attacks, great\r\n  weakness, profuse sweating.\r\n\r\n  Since 1861 he had been very irritable, which, respected though he was\r\n  as an official, caused him much trouble in his work. His wife noticed\r\n  the change in him. He had days when he would run about the house as if\r\n  insane, holding his head between his hands, striking the wall, and\r\n  complaining of headache. In 1864 he fell to the ground four times,\r\n  lying there stiff, with eyes open. Confused states of consciousness\r\n  were also proved to have occurred.\r\n\r\n  L. declared that he had not the slightest remembrance of the crime of\r\n  which he was accused. Observation showed further and more violent\r\n  attacks of epileptic vertigo. L. was not sentenced. In 1875 paretic\r\n  dementia developed with a rapidly fatal result. (Westphal, _Arch. f.\r\n  Psych._, vii, p. 113.)\r\n\r\n  Case 154. A rich man of twenty-six had lived for a year with a girl\r\n  with whom he was very much in love. He cohabited infrequently, and was\r\n  never perverse.\r\n\r\n  Twice during the year, after excessive indulgence in alcohol, he had\r\n  had epileptic attacks. One evening after dinner, where he had taken\r\n  much wine, he hurried to the house of his mistress, and into her\r\n  sleeping-apartment, although the servant told him she was not at home.\r\n  From there he hastened into a room where a boy of fourteen was\r\n  sleeping, and began to violate him. At the cry of the child, whose\r\n  prepuce and hand he had injured, the servant hurried to them. He left\r\n  the boy and attacked the maid; after that he went to bed and slept\r\n  twelve hours. When he awoke, he had an indistinct remembrance of\r\n  intoxication and coitus. Thereafter there were repeated epileptic\r\n  attacks. (Tarnowsky, _op. cit._, p. 52.)\r\n\r\n  Case 155. X., of high social position, led a dissolute life for some\r\n  time, and had epileptic attacks. He became engaged. On his\r\n  wedding-day, shortly before the ceremony, he appeared, on his\r\n  brother’s arm, before the assembled guests. When he came before his\r\n  bride, he exposed his genitals and began to masturbate. He was at once\r\n  taken to an expert in mental disease. On the way he constantly\r\n  masturbated, and for some days was actuated by this impulse, which\r\n  gradually decreased in intensity. After this paroxysm the patient had\r\n  only a confused memory of the events, and could give no explanation of\r\n  his acts. (Tarnowsky, _op. cit._, p. 53.)\r\n\r\n  Case 156. Z., aged 27; very bad heredity; epileptic. He violated a\r\n  girl of eleven, and then killed her. He lied about the deed. Absence\r\n  of memory, _i.e._, mental confusion at the time of the crime, was not\r\n  proved. (Pugliese, _Arch. di Psich._, viii, p. 622.)\r\n\r\n  Case 157. V., aged 60, physician, violated children. Sentenced to\r\n  imprisonment for two years. Dr. Marandon later proved the existence of\r\n  epileptoid attacks of apprehensiveness, dementia, erotic and\r\n  hypochondriacal delusions, and occasional attacks of fear.\r\n  (Lacassagne, _Lyon. méd._, 1887, No. 51.)\r\n\r\n  Case 158. On August 4, 1878, H., aged 15, was picking gooseberries\r\n  with several little girls and boys as her companions. Suddenly she\r\n  threw L., aged 10, to the ground and exposed her, and ordered A., aged\r\n  8, and O., aged 5, to bring about conjunctio membrorum with the girl;\r\n  and they obeyed.\r\n\r\n  H. had a good character. For five years she had been subject to\r\n  irritability, headache, vertigo, and epileptic attacks. Her mental and\r\n  physical development had been arrested. She had not menstruated, but\r\n  she manifested menstrual molimena. Her mother is suspected to be\r\n  epileptic. For three months H., after seizures, had frequently done\r\n  strange things, and afterward had no memory of them.\r\n\r\n  H. seems to have been deflowered. Mental defect is not apparent. She\r\n  said she had no memory of the act of which she was accused. According\r\n  to her mother’s testimony, she had an epileptic attack on the morning\r\n  of August 4th, and she had been, on that account, told by her mother\r\n  not to leave the house. (Pürkauer, _Friedreich’s Blätter f. ger.\r\n  Med._, 1879.)\r\n\r\n  Case 159. _Immoral Acts of an Epileptic in States of Abnormal\r\n  Unconsciousness._—T., revenue-collector; aged 52; married. He is\r\n  accused of having practiced immorality with boys for about seventeen\r\n  years, by practicing masturbation on them, and by inducing them to\r\n  carry out the act on himself. The accused, a respected officer, is\r\n  overcome by the terrible crime attributed to him, and declares that he\r\n  knows nothing of the deeds of which he is accused. His mental\r\n  integrity is questionable. His family physician, who has known him\r\n  twenty years, emphasizes his peculiar, retiring disposition and his\r\n  mercurial moods. His wife asserts that T. once tried to throw her in\r\n  the water, and that he sometimes had outbreaks in which he tore off\r\n  his clothing, and tried to throw himself out of windows. T. knew\r\n  nothing of these attacks. Other witnesses testified to strange changes\r\n  of mood and peculiarities of character. A physician reports the\r\n  observation of occasional attacks of vertigo and convulsions in him.\r\n\r\n  T.’s grandmother was insane; his father was affected with chronic\r\n  alcoholism, and of late years had had epileptiform attacks. The\r\n  father’s brother was insane, and had killed a relative while in a\r\n  delirious state. Another uncle of T. had killed himself. Of T.’s three\r\n  children, one was weak-minded, another cross-eyed, and the third was\r\n  subject to convulsions. The accused asserted that he had occasional\r\n  attacks in which consciousness was so reduced that he did not know\r\n  what he was about. These attacks were ushered in by an aura-like pain\r\n  in the back of his neck. He was then impelled to go out in the air. He\r\n  did not know where he went. His wife had perfectly satisfied him\r\n  sexually. For eighteen years he had had chronic eczema (actual) of the\r\n  scrotum, which had often caused him to have extraordinary sexual\r\n  excitement. The opinions of the six experts were contradictory\r\n  (sane,—attacks of larvated epilepsy); the jury disagreed, so that he\r\n  was dismissed. Dr. Legrand du Saulle, who was called as an expert\r\n  witness, found that, until his twenty-second year, T. had urinated in\r\n  bed from ten to eighteen times a year. After that time the enuresis\r\n  nocturna had ceased; but, from that time, states of mental confusion,\r\n  lasting from an hour to a day, had occurred occasionally, and they\r\n  left the patient without any memory of them. Soon again T. was\r\n  arrested for public immorality, and sentenced to imprisonment for\r\n  fifteen months. In prison he grew sick, and apparently much weaker\r\n  mentally. For this reason he was pardoned, but the mental weakness\r\n  increased. T. was noticed to have repeated epileptoid convulsions\r\n  (tonic convulsion with tremor and loss of consciousness). (Auzouy,\r\n  _Annal. méd. psychol._, 1874, Nov.; Legrand du Saulle, “Étude méd.\r\n  légale,” etc., p. 99.)\r\n\r\nThe following case of immoral acts with children, observed by the author\r\nand reported in _Friedreich’s Blätter_, will serve to conclude this\r\ngroup,[123] so important in its legal bearings. It is the more\r\nimportant, in that a state of unconsciousness was established at the\r\ntime of the act, and because, for allied reasons, the facts related in\r\nLatin show how a complicated and refined act becomes possible in such a\r\nstate of unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n  Case 160. P., aged 49; married; hospital beneficiary. He was accused\r\n  of having committed the following terrible acts with two girls—D.,\r\n  aged ten, and G., aged nine,—whom he had taken to his work-shop on May\r\n  25, 1883.\r\n\r\n  D. testifies: “I was in the meadow with G. and my sister J., aged\r\n  three. P. called us into his shop and fastened the door. Tum nos\r\n  exosculabatur, linguam in os meum demittere tentabat faciemque mihi\r\n  lambebat; sustulit me in gremium, bracas aperuit, vestes meas\r\n  sublevavit, digitis me in genitalibus titillabat et membro femina mea\r\n  fricabat ita ut humida fierem. When I cried, he gave me twelve\r\n  kreuzers, and threatened to shoot me if I told on him. At last he\r\n  tried to persuade me to come again the next day.”\r\n\r\n  G. testified: “P. nates et genitalia D. æ exosculatus, iisdem me\r\n  conatibus aggressus est. Deinde filiolum quoque tres annos natum in\r\n  manus acceptum osculatus est nudatumque parti suæ virili appressit.\r\n  Postea quæ nobis essent nomina interrogavit ac censuit, genitalia D. æ\r\n  meis multo esse majora. Quin etiam nos impulit, ut membrum suum\r\n  intueremur, manibus comprehenderemus et videremus, quantopere id esset\r\n  erectum.”\r\n\r\n  At his examination, May 29th, P. said he had but an indistinct\r\n  recollection of having fondled, caressed, and made presents to a\r\n  little girl a short time before. If he had done anything more, it must\r\n  have been in an irresponsible condition. Besides, he had suffered for\r\n  years with weakness in his head, as result of an injury. On June 22d\r\n  he knew nothing of the events of May 25th, and nothing of his\r\n  examination on May 29th. This amnesia was shown, also, on\r\n  cross-examination.\r\n\r\n  P. comes of a family affected with cerebral disease; a brother was\r\n  epileptic. P. was formerly a drinker. Years before, he had actually\r\n  suffered an injury to his head. Since then, from time to time, he has\r\n  had attacks of mental disturbance, introduced by moroseness,\r\n  irritability, tendency to alcoholic excesses, apprehension, and\r\n  delusions of persecution sufficient to induce threats and deeds of\r\n  violence. At the same time, he would have auditory hyperæsthesia,\r\n  vertigo, headache, and cerebral congestion,—all this, with great\r\n  mental confusion and amnesia for the whole period of the attack, which\r\n  would sometimes last for weeks.\r\n\r\n  During the intervals he was subject to headache, which started from\r\n  the seat of injury on the head (a small scar in the skin over the\r\n  right temple), which was painful on pressure. With exacerbation of the\r\n  headache, he became very irritable, morose to an extent that inclined\r\n  him to suicide, and mentally like one drunk. In 1879, while in such a\r\n  state, he made an impulsive attempt at suicide, of which he afterward\r\n  had no memory. Soon after this, being sent to hospital, he gave the\r\n  impression of being epileptic, and, for a long time, was treated with\r\n  pot. bromide. At the end of 1879 he was taken to the infirmary, no\r\n  actual epileptic attack having been observed.\r\n\r\n  During his lucid intervals he was a virtuous, industrious,\r\n  good-natured man, and had never shown any sexual excitement; and,\r\n  until this time, never sexual inclinations, even during his mental\r\n  confusion. Moreover, until lately, he had lived with his wife. At the\r\n  time of the criminal act, he had shown signs of an approaching attack,\r\n  and had asked the physician to prescribe pot. bromide.\r\n\r\n  P. asserted that, since the injury to his head, he had been intolerant\r\n  of heat and alcohol, which immediately brought on headache and\r\n  confusion. The medical examination proved the truth of his assertions\r\n  about mental weakness, irritability, and poor sleep.\r\n\r\n  If pressure were made at the seat of the trauma, P. became congested,\r\n  irritable, confused, and trembled all over; he appeared excited;\r\n  consciousness was disturbed, and remained so for hours.\r\n\r\n  At times, when he is free from the sensations that start from the\r\n  scar, he seems kind, free, willing, and open, though he is mentally\r\n  weak and cloudy. P. was not sentenced. (_Vide Friedreich’s Blätter_\r\n  for full report.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PERIODICAL INSANITY.\r\n\r\nJust as in cases of non-periodical mania, an abnormal intensity or a\r\nnoticeable prominence of the sexual sphere is very often manifested in\r\nthe periodical attacks (_v. infra_, “Mania”).\r\n\r\nThe following case, reported by Servaes (_Arch. f. Psych._), shows that\r\nit then may also be perverted:—\r\n\r\n  Case 161. Catharine W., aged 16; she has not yet menstruated;\r\n  previously healthy.\r\n\r\n  Seven weeks before admission (December 3, 1872), melancholic\r\n  depression and irritability. November 27th, maniacal outbreak, lasting\r\n  two days; thereafter, melancholic. December 6th, normal condition.\r\n\r\n  December 24th (twenty-eight days after the first maniacal attack),\r\n  silent, shy, depressed. December 27th, exaltation (jolly, laughing,\r\n  etc.), with violent love for an attendant (female). December 31st,\r\n  suddenly melancholic catalepsy, which disappeared after two hours.\r\n  January 20, 1873, new attack like the previous one. A similar one on\r\n  February 18th, with traces of menses. The patient had no memory\r\n  whatever for what occurred in the paroxysms, and blushed scarlet with\r\n  astonishment and shame when told about them.\r\n\r\n  Thereafter there were abortive attacks, which entirely disappeared, to\r\n  give place to the normal mental condition in June.\r\n\r\nIn a case reported by Gock (_Arch. f. Psych._, v), which was probably\r\ncircular insanity, in a man of very bad heredity, during the stage of\r\nexaltation there was manifestation of sexual feeling for men. In this\r\ncase, however, the patient thought himself a girl, and it is\r\nquestionable whether the sexual inclination was induced by the delusion\r\nor by a contrary sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these cases of abnormal manifestation of the sexual\r\ninstinct are those which, as a symptom of mania, manifest an abnormal\r\nand frequently a perverse sexual instinct in an impulsive way, analogous\r\nto dipsomania, which forms the nucleus of the psychical disturbance,\r\nwhile in the intervals the sexual instinct is neither intense nor\r\nperverse.\r\n\r\nQuite a pure case of such periodical psychopathia sexualis, connected\r\nwith the process of menstruation, is the following, reported by Anjel\r\n(_Arch. f. Psych._, xv, H. 2):—\r\n\r\n  Case 162. A quiet lady, near the climacteric. Very bad heredity. In\r\n  her youth, attacks of petit mal. Always eccentric, quick-tempered;\r\n  very moral; childless marriage.\r\n\r\n  Several years ago, after a violent emotional disturbance, a\r\n  hystero-epileptic attack, with post-epileptic insanity of several\r\n  weeks’ duration. Thereafter there was sleeplessness for several\r\n  months. Following this, there was always menstrual insomnia, and the\r\n  impulse to embrace and kiss boys of ten, and fondle their genitals.\r\n  During this excitement there was no desire for coitus; certainly not\r\n  for intercourse with adults.\r\n\r\n  The patient often speaks openly of this impulse, and asks to be\r\n  watched, as she is not to be trusted. In the intervals she anxiously\r\n  avoids all talk of it, is very modest, and in nowise passionate\r\n  sexually.\r\n\r\n  With reference to the still imperfectly-known cases of periodical\r\n  psychopathia sexualis of this kind, Tarnowsky (_op. cit._, p. 38) has\r\n  made valuable contributions, though his cases were not all of a\r\n  periodic nature; and one of the cases, taken from a work of the\r\n  author’s, is not rightly understood (Case 8, p. 37), since sodomy was\r\n  only subsidiary, and the abnormal intense libido sexualis was not\r\n  periodic.\r\n\r\n  Tarnowsky reports cases where married, cultured men, the fathers of\r\n  families, were, from time to time, compelled to perform the most\r\n  terrible sexual acts, while during the intervals they were sexually\r\n  normal, abhorred their paroxysmal sexual acts, and shuddered before\r\n  the expectation of their repetition.\r\n\r\n  If a new paroxysm came on, the normal sexual instinct disappeared; a\r\n  state of mental excitement arose with insomnia, and thoughts and\r\n  impulses to commit the perverse sexual acts, with anxious confusion\r\n  and an increasing impulse to the abhorred indulgence. In this state\r\n  the act was a relief, because it ended the condition. The analogy with\r\n  dipsomania is complete.\r\n\r\nFor other cases (of periodical pederasty), _vide_ Tarnowsky, _op. cit._,\r\np. 41. The case there reported, on page 46, belongs in the category of\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\nThe following case, reported by Anjel (_Arch. f. Psych._, xv, H. 2), is\r\none of the most typical of the convulsive-like occurrence of sexual\r\nexcitement:—\r\n\r\n  Case 163. A gentleman of high social position, aged 45; generally\r\n  respected and beloved; heredity good; very moral; married fifteen\r\n  years. Previously normal sexually; the father of several healthy\r\n  children, and living in happy matrimony. Eight years ago he suffered a\r\n  violent fright. For some weeks thereafter he had a feeling of\r\n  apprehension and cardiac attacks. Then came attacks, at intervals of\r\n  several months or a year, of what the patient called his “moral\r\n  catarrh.” He became sleepless. After three days, loss of appetite,\r\n  increasing irritability, strange appearance; fixed stare, staring into\r\n  space; paleness, changing with redness; tremor of the fingers; red,\r\n  shining eyes, with peculiar glassy expression; and violent, quick\r\n  manner of speech. There was a desire for girls of from five to ten\r\n  years, even for his own daughters. He would beg his wife to guard the\r\n  children. For days at a time, while in this state, he would shut\r\n  himself in his room. Previously he was compelled to pass school-girls\r\n  on the street, and he found a peculiar pleasure in exposing his\r\n  genitals before them, by acting as if about to urinate.\r\n\r\n  For fear of exposure, he shuts himself in his room, full of desire,\r\n  incapable of movement, and torn by feelings of fear. Consciousness\r\n  seems to be undisturbed. The attacks last from eight to fourteen days.\r\n  The cause of their return is not clear. Improvement is sudden; there\r\n  is great desire for sleep, and, after this is satisfied, he is again\r\n  well. In the interval there is nothing abnormal. The author assumes an\r\n  epileptic foundation, and considers the attacks to be the psychical\r\n  equivalents of epileptic convulsions (!).\r\n\r\n_Mania._—With the general excitation that here exists in the psychical\r\norgan, the sexual sphere is likewise often implicated. In maniacal\r\nindividuals of the female sex, this is the rule. In certain cases, it\r\nmay be questionable whether the instinct, which, in itself, is not\r\nintensified, is simply recklessly manifested, or whether it is present\r\nin actual abnormal intensity. For the most part, the latter is the true\r\nassumption,—certainly so where sexual delusions and their religious\r\nequivalents are constantly expressed. In accordance with the degrees of\r\nintensity of the disease, the intensified instinct is expressed in\r\ndifferent forms.\r\n\r\nIn simple maniacal exaltation in men, courting, frivolity, and\r\nlasciviousness in speech, and frequenting of brothels, are observed; in\r\nwomen, inclination for the society of men, personal adornment, perfumes,\r\ntalk of marriage and scandals, suspicion of the virtue of other women;\r\nor there is manifested the religious equivalent,—pilgrimages, missionary\r\nwork, desire to go into a cloister or to become the servant of a priest;\r\nand in this case there is much talk about innocence and virginity.\r\n\r\nAt the height of mania there may be seen invitations to coitus,\r\nexhibition, obscenity, great excitation at sight of women, tendency to\r\nsmear the person with saliva, urine, and even fæces; religio-sexual\r\ndelusions,—to be under the protection of the Holy Ghost, to have given\r\nbirth to Christ, etc.; open onanism, and pelvic movements of coitus.\r\n\r\nIn maniacal men care must be taken to prevent shameless masturbation and\r\nsexual attacks on women.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SATYRIASIS AND NYMPHOMANIA.\r\n\r\nStates of mental excitement, in which an abnormal intense sexual impulse\r\nis prominent, are called satyriasis (in males) and nymphomania (in\r\nwomen), or uteromania.\r\n\r\nMoreau considers these cases peculiar to themselves, but he is certainly\r\nin error. The sexual complexus of symptoms is always but the partial\r\nmanifestation of a general psychosis (mania, hallucinatory insanity?).\r\n\r\nThe essential element of the state of sexual excitement is a condition\r\nof psychical hyperæsthesia with involvement of the sexual sphere. The\r\nimagination calls up only sexual images, which may lead to\r\nhallucinations, illusions, and true hallucinatory delirium.\r\n\r\nThe most indifferent ideas excite sensual association, and the lustful\r\ncoloring of the ideas and apperceptions is very much intensified.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal state of consciousness implicates the whole course of\r\nfeeling and desire, and is accompanied by general physical excitement\r\nlike that that accompanies coitus (v. “Physiology”). Often the genitals\r\nare in a constant state of turgor (priapism in males).\r\n\r\nThe man affected with this sexual passion seeks to satisfy his desire at\r\nany price, and, therefore, becomes very dangerous to women. _Faute de\r\nmieux_, he practices onanism or sodomy. The nymphomaniacal woman seeks\r\nmen by exhibition, or to attract them by her sensual conduct; at the\r\nsight of men she is intensely excited sexually, and satisfies herself by\r\nmasturbation, or by pelvic movements of coitus.\r\n\r\nSatyriasis is infrequent. Nymphomania is more frequently observed, and\r\nnot seldom in the climacteric. It may occur in senility.\r\nAbstinence,[124] with constant excitation of the sexual sphere as a\r\nresult of psychical or peripheral irritation (pruritus pudendi, oxyuris,\r\netc.), may cause these conditions, but probably only in those\r\npredisposed.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that it may also result from poisoning by cantharides\r\nseems to depend upon confounding it with priapism. The primary lustful\r\nfeeling that accompanies priapism due to cantharides soon becomes\r\npainful. Satyriasis and nymphomania are acute abnormal psycho-sexual\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThere are also cases that, not without reason, might be called chronic\r\nsatyriasis or nymphomania. To these belong the men who, for the most\r\npart as a result of abusus veneris, or more particularly of\r\nmasturbation, suffer with neurasthenia sexualis, and at the same time\r\nhave intense libido sexualis. The imagination, as in acute cases, is in\r\na state of excitement, and the mind full of obscene images; so that the\r\nmost elevated ideas are besmirched with the most cynical images and\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThe thought and desire of such men are solely directed to the sexual\r\nsphere; and since their flesh is weak, led on by their fancy, they come\r\nto indulge in the grossest perversions of the sexual act.\r\n\r\nAnalogous cases in women may be called chronic nymphomania. They\r\nnaturally lead to prostitution. Legrand du Saulle (“La folie,” p. 510)\r\nreports interesting cases which apparently are pure.\r\n\r\n_Melancholia._—The thoughts and feelings of melancholiacs are not\r\nfavorable for the excitation of sexual desires. At the same time, these\r\npatients sometimes masturbate. In my experience such cases have always\r\nbeen hereditarily predisposed and previously given to onanism. The act\r\ndid not seem to be so much due to a lustful desire as to be induced by\r\nhabit, _ennui_, anxiety, and the impulse to change temporarily the\r\npainful mental condition.\r\n\r\n_Hysteria._—In this neurosis the sexual life is very frequently\r\nabnormal; indeed, always in predisposed individuals. All the possible\r\nanomalies of the sexual function may occur here, with sudden changes and\r\npeculiar activity; and, on an hereditary degenerate basis and in moral\r\nimbecility, they may appear in the most perverse forms. The abnormal\r\nchange and inversion of the sexual feeling are never without effect upon\r\nthe patient’s disposition.\r\n\r\nThe following case, reported by Giraud, is one of this nature worthy of\r\nrepetition:—\r\n\r\n  Case 164. Marian L., of Bordeaux. At night, while the household was\r\n  asleep under the influence of narcotics she had administered, she had\r\n  given the children of the house to her lover for sexual enjoyment, and\r\n  had looked on at the immoral acts. It was found that L. was hysterical\r\n  (hemianæsthesia and convulsive attacks), but before her illness she\r\n  had been a moral, trustworthy person. Since her illness she had become\r\n  a shameless prostitute, and lost all moral sense.\r\n\r\nIn the hysterical the sexual sphere is often abnormally excited. This\r\nexcitement may be intermittent (menstrual?). Shameless prostitution,\r\neven in married women, may result. In a milder form the sexual impulse\r\nexpresses itself in onanism, going about in a room naked, smearing the\r\nperson with urine and other things, or wearing male attire, etc.\r\n\r\nSchüle (_Klin. Psychiatrie_, 1886, p. 237) finds very frequently an\r\nabnormally intense sexual impulse “which disposes girls, and even women\r\nliving in happy marriage, to become Messalinas.”\r\n\r\nThe author cited knows cases in which, on the wedding-journey, attempts\r\nat flight with men, who had been accidentally met, were made; and\r\nrespected wives who entered into _liaisons_, and sacrificed everything\r\nto their insatiable impulse.\r\n\r\nIn hysterical insanity the abnormally intense sexual impulse may express\r\nitself in delusions of jealousy, unfounded accusations against men for\r\nimmoral acts,[125] hallucinations of coitus,[126] etc.\r\n\r\nOccasionally frigidity may occur, with absence of lustful feeling,—due,\r\nfor the most part, to genital anæsthesia.\r\n\r\n_Paranoia._—Abnormal manifestations in the sexual sphere, in the various\r\nforms of paranoia, are not infrequent. Many of these cases are developed\r\non sexual abuse (masturbatic paranoia) or sexual excitement; and,\r\naccording to experience, in individuals psychically degenerate, with\r\nother functional signs of degeneracy, the sexual sphere is, for the most\r\npart, deeply implicated.\r\n\r\nIn paranoia religiosa and erotica the abnormally intense and, under\r\ncertain circumstances, perverse sexual instinct is most clearly\r\nmanifested. In the first variety, however, the condition of sexual\r\nexcitation is expressed not so much in a direct method of satisfaction\r\nof the sexual desires as (there are exceptions) in platonic love,—in\r\nenthusiastic admiration of a person of the opposite sex who is pleasing\r\næsthetically. Under certain circumstances, the enthusiasm is for a\r\nfanciful person, a portrait, or a statue.\r\n\r\nA love for the opposite sex that is weak and purely mental, too, often\r\nhas its basis in weakness of the genitals due to long-continued\r\nmasturbation; and, under the guise of virtuous admiration of a beloved\r\nperson, great lasciviousness and sexual perversion are often concealed.\r\nEpisodically, especially in women, violent sexual excitement may occur\r\nas a nymphomania.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, paranoia religiosa rests upon sexuality which\r\nmanifests itself in a sexual impulse that is abnormally early and\r\nintense. The libido finds satisfaction in masturbation or religious\r\nenthusiasm, the object of which may be a certain minister, saint, etc.\r\n\r\nThe psycho-pathological relations between the sexual and religious\r\ndomains have been described in detail on p. 8 _et seq._\r\n\r\nApart from masturbation, sexual crimes are relatively frequent in\r\nreligious paranoia.\r\n\r\nMarc’s work (p. 160) contains a remarkable example of religious\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nGiraud (_Annal. méd. psychol._) has reported a case of rape of a little\r\ngirl by a religious paranoiac, aged 43, who was temporarily erotic.\r\nHere, also, belongs a case of incest (Liman, _Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger.\r\nMed._).\r\n\r\n  Case 165. M. impregnated his daughter. His wife, mother of eighteen\r\n  children, and herself pregnant by her husband, lodged the complaint.\r\n  M. had had religious paranoia for two years. “It was revealed to me\r\n  that I should beget the Eternal Son with my daughter. Then a man of\r\n  flesh and blood would arise by my faith, who would be eighteen hundred\r\n  years old. He would be a bridge between the Old and New Testaments.”\r\n  This command, which he deemed divine, was the cause of his insane act.\r\n\r\nSexual acts that have a pathological motive sometimes occur in\r\npersecutory paranoia.\r\n\r\n  Case 166. A married woman of thirty had, by means of money and\r\n  sweetmeats, enticed a boy of five, who played near her, handled his\r\n  genitals, and then attempted coitus. She was a teacher, who had been\r\n  betrayed and then cast off. Previously moral, for some time she had\r\n  given herself to prostitution. The explanation of her immoral change\r\n  was given, when it was found that she had various delusions of\r\n  persecution, and thought she was under the secret influence of her\r\n  seducer, who impelled her to sexual acts. She also believed that the\r\n  boy had been put in her way by her seducer. Coarse sensuality as a\r\n  motive for her crime came less into consideration, as it would have\r\n  been easy for her to satisfy sexual desire in a natural way. (Küssner,\r\n  _Berl. klin. Wochenschrift._)\r\n\r\nCullerre (“Perversions sexuelles chez les persécutés,” in _Annal.\r\nmédico-psychol._, March, 1886) has reported similar cases,—the case of a\r\npatient who, suffering with paranoia sexualis persecutoria, tried to\r\nviolate his sister, giving as a reason that the impulse was given him by\r\nBonapartists.\r\n\r\nIn another case a captain, suffering with delusions of persecution by\r\nelectro-magnetism, was driven to pederasty,—a thing he abhorred. In a\r\nsimilar case the persecutor impelled to onanism and pederasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            V. PATHOLOGICAL SEXUALITY IN ITS LEGAL ASPECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws of all civilized nations punish those who commit perverse\r\nsexual acts. Inasmuch as the preservation of chastity and morals is one\r\nof the most important reasons for the existence of the commonwealth, the\r\nstate cannot be too careful, as a protector of morality, in the struggle\r\nagainst sensuality. This contest is unequal; because only a certain\r\nnumber of the sexual crimes can be legally combated, and the infractions\r\nof the laws by so powerful a natural instinct can be but little\r\ninfluenced by punishment. It also lies in the nature of the sexual\r\ncrimes, that but a part of them ever reach the knowledge of the\r\nauthorities. Public sentiment, in that it looks upon them as\r\ndisgraceful, lends much aid.\r\n\r\nCriminal statistics prove the sad fact that sexual crimes are\r\nprogressively increasing in our modern civilization.[127] This is\r\nparticularly the case with immoral acts with children under the age of\r\nfourteen. The moralist sees in these sad facts nothing but the decay of\r\ngeneral morality, and in some instances comes to the conclusion that the\r\npresent mildness of the laws punishing sexual crimes, in comparison with\r\ntheir severity in past centuries, is in part responsible for this.\r\n\r\nThe medical investigator is driven to the conclusion that this\r\nmanifestation of modern social life stands in relation to the\r\npredominating nervousness of later generations, in that it begets\r\ndefective individuals, excites the sexual instinct, leads to sexual\r\nabuse, and, with continuance of lasciviousness associated with\r\ndiminished sexual power, induces perverse sexual acts.\r\n\r\nIt will be clearly seen, from what follows, how such an opinion is\r\njustified, especially with respect of the increasing number of sexual\r\ncrimes committed on children. It is at once evident, from what has gone\r\nbefore, that neuropathic, and even psychopathic, states are largely\r\ndeterminate for the commission of sexual crimes. Here nothing less than\r\nthe responsibility of many of the men who commit such crimes is called\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nPsychiatry cannot be denied the credit of having recognized and proved\r\nthe psycho-pathological significance of numerous monstrous, paradoxical\r\nsexual acts. Law and Jurisprudence have thus far given but little\r\nattention to the facts resulting from investigations in psychopathology.\r\nLaw is, in this, opposed to Medicine, and is constantly in danger of\r\npassing judgment on individuals who, in the light of science, are not\r\nresponsible for their acts.\r\n\r\nOwing to this superficial treatment of acts that deeply concern the\r\ninterests and welfare of society, it becomes very easy for justice to\r\ntreat a delinquent, who is as dangerous to society as a murderer or a\r\nwild beast, as a criminal, and, after punishment, release him to prey on\r\nsociety again; on the other hand, scientific investigation shows that a\r\nman mentally and sexually degenerate _ab origine_, and therefore\r\nirresponsible, must be removed from society for life, but not as a\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nA judge who considers only the crime, and not its perpetrator, is always\r\nin danger of injuring not only important interests of society (general\r\nmorality and safety), but also those of the individual (honor).\r\n\r\nIn no domain of criminal law is co-operation of judge and medical expert\r\nso much to be desired as in that of sexual delinquencies; and here only\r\nanthropological and clinical investigation can afford light and\r\nknowledge. The nature of the act can never, in itself, determine a\r\ndecision as to whether it lies within the limits of mental pathology, or\r\nwithin the bounds of mental physiology. The perverse act does not\r\nindicate perversion of instinct. At any rate, the most monstrous and\r\nperverse sexual acts have been committed by persons of sound mind. The\r\nperversion of feeling must be shown to be pathological. This proof is to\r\nbe obtained by learning the conditions attending its development, and by\r\nproving the existence of a general neuropathic or psychopathic\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe _species facti_ is important; but it allows, however, only\r\npresumptions, since the same sexual act, according as it is committed by\r\nan epileptic, paralytic, or a man of sound mind, takes on other features\r\nand peculiarities, in accordance with the manner in which it is done.\r\n\r\nPeriodical recurrence of the act under identical circumstances, and an\r\nimpulsive manner in carrying it out, give rise to weighty presumptions\r\nthat it is of pathological significance. The decision, however, must\r\nfollow after referring the act to its psychological motive\r\n(abnormalities of thought and feeling), and after showing this\r\nelementary anomaly to be but one symptom of a general neuropathic\r\ncondition,—either an arrest of mental development, or a condition of\r\npsychical degeneration, or a psychosis.\r\n\r\nThe cases discussed in the portion of this work devoted to general and\r\nspecial pathology will certainly be useful to the medical expert, in\r\nassisting him to discover the motive of the act. To obtain the facts\r\nnecessary to allow a decision of the question whether immorality or\r\nabnormality occasioned the act, a medico-legal examination is\r\nrequired,—an examination which is made according to the rules of\r\nscience; which takes account of both the past history of the individual\r\nand the present condition,—the anthropological and clinical data.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the existence of an original, congenital anomaly of the\r\nsexual sphere is important, and points to the need of an examination in\r\nthe direction of a condition of psychical degeneration. An acquired\r\nperversity, to be pathological, must be found to depend upon a\r\nneuropathic or psychopathic state.\r\n\r\nPractically, paretic dementia and epilepsy must first come to mind. The\r\ndecision concerning responsibility will depend on the demonstration of\r\nthe existence of a psychopathic state in the individual convicted of a\r\nsexual crime.\r\n\r\nThis is indispensable, to avoid the danger of covering simple immorality\r\nwith the cloak of disease.\r\n\r\nPsychopathic states may lead to crimes against morality, and at the same\r\ntime remove the conditions necessary to the existence of responsibility,\r\nunder the following circumstances:—\r\n\r\n1. To oppose the normal or intensified sexual desire, there may be no\r\nmoral or legal notions, owing to (_a_) the fact that they may never have\r\nbeen developed (states of congenital mental weakness); or to (_b_) the\r\nfact that they have been lost (states of acquired mental weakness).\r\n\r\n2. When the sexual desire is increased (states of psychical exaltation)\r\nand consciousness simultaneously clouded, the mental mechanism is too\r\nmuch disturbed to allow the opposing ideas, virtually present, to exert\r\ntheir influence.\r\n\r\n3. When the sexual instinct is perverse (states of psychical\r\ndegeneration). It may, at the same time, be intensified.\r\n\r\nCases of sexual delinquency that occur outside of states of mental\r\ndefect, degeneration, or disease, can never be excused on the ground of\r\nirresponsibility.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, instead of an abnormal psychical condition, a neurosis\r\n(local or general) is found. Inasmuch as the transitions from a neurosis\r\nto a psychosis are easy, and elementary psychical disturbances are\r\nfrequent in the former, and constant in profound perversion of the\r\nsexual life, the neurotic affection—_e.g._, impotence, irritable\r\nweakness, etc.—exerts an influence on the motive of the incriminating\r\nact; and a just judge, notwithstanding the lack of legal\r\nirresponsibility due to mental defect or disease, will recognize the\r\ncircumstances which ameliorate the heinousness of the crime.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons the practical jurist will, in all cases of sexual\r\ncrimes, call medical experts to make a psychiatric examination.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, his own conscience and judgment must be the guides when\r\nnecessity makes them his only reliance. Under the following\r\ncircumstances _indices_ are given which point to a pathological\r\ncondition:—\r\n\r\nThe accused is senile. The sexual crime is committed openly, with\r\nremarkable cynicism. The manner of obtaining sexual satisfaction is\r\nsilly (exhibition), or cruel (mutilation or murder), or perverse\r\n(necrophilia, etc.).\r\n\r\nFrom what experience teaches, it may be said that, among the sexual acts\r\nthat occur, rape, mutilation, pederasty, _amor lesbicus_, and bestiality\r\nmay have a psycho-pathological basis.\r\n\r\nIn case of lust-murder,—in as far as it goes beyond murder itself,—and\r\nlikewise in case of mutilation of corpses, psychopathic conditions are\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nExhibition and mutual masturbation make pathological states seem very\r\nprobable. Masturbation of another and passive onanism may occur in\r\nconnection with senile dementia and contrary sexual feeling, but also\r\nwith mere sensuality.\r\n\r\nCunnilingus and fellare (penem in os mulieris arrigere) have not thus\r\nfar been shown to depend upon psycho-pathological conditions.\r\n\r\nThese horrible sexual acts seem to be committed only by sensual men who\r\nhave become satiated or impotent from excessive indulgence in a normal\r\nway. Pædicatio mulierum does not seem to be psychopathic, but rather a\r\npractice of married men of low morality, who wish to prevent pregnancy;\r\nand of satiated cynics in non-marital sexual indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe practical importance of the subject makes it necessary that the\r\nsexual acts threatened with punishment as sexual crimes be considered by\r\njurists from the stand-point of the medico-legal expert. Thus there is\r\nan advantage gained, in that the psycho-pathological acts, according to\r\ncircumstances, are placed in the right light by comparison with\r\nanalogous acts that fall within the domain of physiological psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n         1. OFFENSE AGAINST MORALITY IN THE FORM OF EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n (Austrian Statutes, § 516; Abridgment, § 195. German Statutes, § 183.)\r\n\r\nIn man’s present condition of civilization, modesty is a characteristic\r\nand motive so firmly fixed by centuries of education that presumption of\r\na psycho-pathological element necessarily arises when public decency is\r\ncoarsely offended.\r\n\r\nThe presumption is justifiable that an individual who in this way has\r\noffended public decency and his own self-respect was incapable of moral\r\nfeeling (idiots); or that it has been lost (states of acquired mental\r\nweakness); or that he has acted while in a clouded state of\r\nconsciousness (transitory insanity, states of partial consciousness).\r\n\r\nA very distinctive act which belongs here is that of _exhibition_\r\n(exposure). The cases thus far recorded are exclusively those of men who\r\nostentatiously expose their genitals to persons of the opposite sex, in\r\nsome instances following them, without, however, becoming aggressive.\r\n\r\nThe silly manner of this sexual activity, or really sexual\r\ndemonstration, points to intellectual and moral weakness; or, at least,\r\nto temporary inhibition of the intellectual and moral functions, with\r\nexcitation of libido dependent upon a decided disturbance of\r\nconsciousness (abnormal unconsciousness, mental confusion); and, at the\r\nsame time, the virility of these individuals is called in question. Thus\r\nthere are various categories of exhibitionists.\r\n\r\nThe first category includes states of mental weakness in which, owing to\r\nthe causative cerebral (or spinal) disease, consciousness is clouded,\r\nand the ethical and intellectual functions are interfered with; and in\r\nwhich there can be no opposition made to a sexual desire that has either\r\nalways been intense, or that has been intensified by the\r\ndisease-process. At the same time, impotence exists, and no longer\r\npermits expression of the sexual instinct in violent acts (rape), but\r\nonly in acts that are silly.\r\n\r\nThe majority of reported cases[128] fall in this category. They are\r\nthose of individuals afflicted with senile dementia, paretic dementia,\r\nor mental defects due to alcoholism, epilepsy, etc.\r\n\r\n  Case 167. Z., high official, aged 60; widower; father of a family. He\r\n  had excited offense in that, during fourteen days, he had repeatedly\r\n  exposed his genitals at his window, to a girl of eight years who lived\r\n  opposite him. After a few months, under like circumstances, this man\r\n  repeated his indecent act. At his examination he acknowledged the\r\n  depravity of his action, and could give no excuse for it. Death, a\r\n  year later, due to cerebral disease. (Lasègue, _op. cit._)\r\n\r\n  Case 168. Z., aged 78; seaman. He had repeatedly exhibited his\r\n  genitals on children’s play-grounds, and in the neighborhood of girls’\r\n  schools. This was the only way in which he was active sexually. He was\r\n  married, and the father of ten children. Twelve years before, he had\r\n  suffered a severe head-injury, since which he had had a deep scar,\r\n  which indented the bone. Pressure on this scar caused pain; at the\r\n  same time his face would flush, his expression become fixed, and he\r\n  would grow somnolent, with convulsive movements in the right upper\r\n  extremity (apparently epileptoid state in connection with cortical\r\n  disease). Besides, there was senile dementia and advanced senium. It\r\n  is not reported whether the exhibition coincided with epileptoid\r\n  attacks or not. Senile dementia proved; pardoned. (Dr. Schuchardt,\r\n  _op. cit._)\r\n\r\nPelanda (_op. cit._) has reported a number of cases of this kind:—\r\n\r\n  1. Paralytic, aged 60. At the age of fifty-eight he began to exhibit\r\n  himself to women and children. In the asylum at Verona, for a long\r\n  time thereafter, he was lascivious and also attempted _fellatio_.\r\n\r\n  2. A drinker, aged 66, suffering with folie circulaire. His exhibition\r\n  was first noticed in church during divine service. His brother was\r\n  likewise an exhibitionist.\r\n\r\n  3. A drinker, predisposed, aged 49. He was always very excitable\r\n  sexually; in an asylum on account of chronic alcoholism. He exhibited\r\n  himself whenever he saw a woman.\r\n\r\n  4. A man, aged 64; married; father of fourteen children. Great\r\n  predisposition. Rachitic, microcephalic head. For years he had been an\r\n  exhibitionist, in spite of repeated punishment.\r\n\r\n  Case 169. X., merchant, born in 1833; single. He had repeatedly\r\n  exhibited himself to children, or even urinated at the same time;\r\n  once, under these circumstances, he had kissed a little girl, driving\r\n  her away. Twenty years previously X. had had a severe attack of mental\r\n  disease, lasting two years, in which he is said to have had an\r\n  apoplectic attack. Later, after loss of his fortune, he gave himself\r\n  to drink, and of late years had often appeared absent-minded. His\r\n  condition was that of alcoholism, senium præcox, and mental weakness.\r\n  Penis small; phimosis; testicles atrophic. Proof of mental disease;\r\n  pardoned. (Dr. Schuchardt, _op. cit._)\r\n\r\nSuch cases recall the lasciviousness of youthful, sexuallyexcited\r\npersons that are still more or less boyish; but also that of many mature\r\ncynics of low morality, who find pleasure in defiling the walls of\r\npublic closets, etc., with drawings of male and female genitals,—a kind\r\nof ideal exhibition which, however, is still widely separated from\r\nactual exhibition.\r\n\r\nAnother category of exhibitionists is made up of epileptics. This\r\ncategory is essentially to be distinguished from the foregoing, in that\r\na conscious motive for the exhibition is wanting; and it appears much\r\nmore like an impulsive act which, without any consideration of external\r\ncircumstances, is performed as if it were an abnormal organic necessity.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the act there is always a state of imperfect\r\nconsciousness; and thus is explained the fact that the unfortunate\r\nindividual, without consciousness of the meaning of his act, or, at\r\nleast, without cynicism, does it in obedience to a blind impulse. On\r\nregaining consciousness, he regrets and abhors it if there is not\r\npermanent mental weakness.\r\n\r\nThe prime motive in this state of imperfect consciousness, as with other\r\nimpulsive acts, is a feeling of apprehensive oppression. If a sexual\r\nfeeling become associated with it, then the ideas are given a certain\r\ndirection in the sense of a corresponding (sexual) act.\r\n\r\nHow sexual ideas very easily arise temporarily in epileptics may be\r\nunderstood from the discussion under “Epilepsy.”\r\n\r\nIf, however, such an association has once been formed; if a particular\r\nact has taken place in an attack,—it is the more easily repeated in\r\nevery subsequent attack; for, so to speak, a known tract has been\r\nestablished in the path of motivity.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of anxiety, with the state of imperfect consciousness,\r\ncauses the associated sexual impulse to appear as a command,—an inner\r\nforce, which is acted upon in a purely impulsive manner and in a state\r\nof absolute irresponsibility.\r\n\r\n  Case 170. K., a subordinate official, aged 29; of neuropathic family;\r\n  living in happy marriage, and the father of one child. He has\r\n  repeatedly, especially at dusk, exhibited himself to servant-girls. K.\r\n  is tall, slim, pale, nervous, and hasty in manner. _There is imperfect\r\n  memory of the crimes._ Since childhood there have been frequent severe\r\n  congestive attacks, with intense flushing of the face, a rapid, tense\r\n  pulse, and a fixed, absent stare. At the same time there were, now and\r\n  then, confusion and vertigo. In this (epileptic) exceptional state K.\r\n  would answer only after repeated questioning, and then _it was as if\r\n  he were waking from a dream_. K. states that he has always felt\r\n  excited and restless for some hours before his criminal acts, and\r\n  experienced a feeling of fear, with oppression, and congestion of the\r\n  head. In this condition he had often been giddy, and experienced an\r\n  indistinct feeling of sexual excitement. At the height of such states\r\n  he had left the house, without any purpose in view, and exposed his\r\n  genitals anywhere. When he had reached home again, he had had but a\r\n  dreamy remembrance of what had occurred, and felt very weak and\r\n  depressed. It is also remarkable that, while exhibiting his genitals,\r\n  he had used lighted matches to make them visible. The opinion was to\r\n  the effect that the criminal acts depended upon epilepsy, and were\r\n  imperative impulses; but he was, nevertheless, sentenced, with the\r\n  assumption of extenuating circumstances. (Dr. Schuchardt, _op. cit._).\r\n\r\n  Case 171. L., aged 39; single; tailor. His father was probably a\r\n  drinker; he had two epileptic brothers, one of whom was insane. The\r\n  patient himself has slight epileptic attacks, and from time to time\r\n  states of imperfect consciousness, in which he runs about aimlessly,\r\n  and thereafter does not know where he has been. He was considered a\r\n  moral man, but he is now accused of having exhibited and played with\r\n  his genitals in a strange house five or six times. His memory of these\r\n  acts was very imperfect.\r\n\r\n  On account of repeated desertion from the army (probably likewise in\r\n  epileptic states of imperfect consciousness), L. had been severely\r\n  punished. In imprisonment he became insane with “epileptic insanity,”\r\n  was sent to the Charité, and from there discharged “cured.” As far as\r\n  the criminal acts were concerned, cynicism and wantonness could be\r\n  excluded. That they were committed in a state of imperfect\r\n  consciousness is probable from the fact, among other things, that to\r\n  the policeman who arrested him, the “imbecile,” who was then in a\r\n  cloudy state of consciousness, was in a remarkable mental state.\r\n  (Liman, _Vierteljahrsschrift f. ger. Med._, N. F. xxxviii, H. 2.)\r\n\r\n  Case 172. L., aged 37. From October 15th to November 2d, he had many\r\n  times given offense, by exhibiting himself to girls in daylight on the\r\n  open street, and even in schools, into which he forced himself. It\r\n  happened occasionally that he wanted the girls to perform\r\n  manustupration or allow coitus, and, when refused, he performed\r\n  masturbation before them. In G., in a public-house, he rapped on the\r\n  window, with his penis exposed, so that the children and servant-girl\r\n  in the kitchen were forced to see it.\r\n\r\n  After his arrest it was ascertained that since 1876 L. had very\r\n  frequently caused trouble by exhibitions, but had always escaped\r\n  punishment, owing to the demonstration of mental disease by\r\n  physicians. On the other hand, he had been punished for desertion and\r\n  theft in the army, and, later, once, as a civilian, for stealing\r\n  cigars. L. had repeatedly been in asylums on account of insanity\r\n  (attacks of insanity). Besides, he was often remarkable on account of\r\n  his changeable, quarrelsome character, occasional excitement, and\r\n  inconstancy.\r\n\r\n  L.’s brother died of paralysis. He himself presents no degenerative\r\n  signs; no epileptic antecedents. During the time of observation he is\r\n  neither insane nor mentally weakened. He behaves himself very well,\r\n  and expresses great regret for his sexual crimes. About himself he\r\n  states that, though no drinker, he occasionally has an impulse to\r\n  drink. Soon after beginning, congestion of the head, vertigo,\r\n  restlessness, anxiety, and oppression come on. He then passes into a\r\n  dreamy state. An irresistible impulse now forces him to expose\r\n  himself; and he then experiences a feeling of relief and breathes more\r\n  easily. When he has once exposed himself, he knows nothing more of\r\n  what he does. As precursors of such attacks, he had often, a short\r\n  time before, had flames before the eyes, and vertigo. For the time of\r\n  his clouded state of consciousness, he had but a clouded, dreamy\r\n  memory.\r\n\r\n  It was only after a time that sexual ideas and impulses had become\r\n  associated with these apprehensive, cloudy states of consciousness.\r\n  Years ago, in such states, without motive and with great danger, he\r\n  had deserted; once he had jumped from a third-story window; on another\r\n  occasion he had left a good position to wander about aimlessly in a\r\n  neighboring country, where he was at once arrested for exhibition.\r\n\r\n  When, outside of his abnormal periods, L. once became intoxicated,\r\n  there was no exhibition. In the lucid state his sexual feeling and\r\n  intercourse are perfectly normal. (Dr. Hotzen, _Friedreich’s Blätter_,\r\n  1890, H. 6). For other instances, _vide_ Cases 153, 155.\r\n\r\nA clinical group that very nearly approaches the epileptic\r\nexhibitionists is made up of certain neurasthenic individuals, in whom,\r\nlikewise, there may occur attacks (epileptoid?) of imperfect\r\nconsciousness[129] in connection with a feeling of apprehensive\r\noppression; and with this sexual impulses may be associated, resulting\r\nin acts of exhibition having an impulsive character.\r\n\r\n  Case 173. Dr. S., academic teacher, had aroused public indignation by\r\n  being seen repeatedly running about in the Zoological Garden at\r\n  Berlin, before ladies and children, with his genitals hanging out. S.\r\n  admitted this, but denied all thought or consciousness of causing\r\n  public offense, and excused himself by saying that his running about\r\n  with exposed genitals afforded him relief from nervous excitement.\r\n  Mother’s father was insane, and died by suicide; his mother was\r\n  constitutionally neuropathic, a somnambulist, and had been temporarily\r\n  insane. The culprit was neuropathic, had been a somnambulist, and had\r\n  had continuous aversion to sexual intercourse with females. In his\r\n  youth he practiced onanism. He was a neurasthenic man, shy, torpid,\r\n  and easily became embarrassed and confused. He was sexually always\r\n  much excited. Frequently he dreamed that he was running about with\r\n  exposed genitals, or that, dressed only in a shirt, he hung from a\r\n  fence with his head downward, so that the shirt fell down, exposing\r\n  his erected penis. His dreams would induce pollution, and he would\r\n  then have rest for a few days or an entire week.\r\n\r\n  Also, in his waking state, the impulse would often come upon him, just\r\n  as in his dreams, to run about with exposed genitals. As he was about\r\n  to expose himself, he would become very hot, and then he would run\r\n  aimlessly about. The member would become moist with secretion, but\r\n  pollution was never induced. Finally, when it had become flaccid, he\r\n  would put it up, and then come to himself, glad if no one had seen\r\n  him. In such conditions of excitement he seemed to be in a dream; as\r\n  if intoxicated. He had never had the intention to offend women. S. was\r\n  not epileptic. His declarations had the impress of truth. He had\r\n  actually never followed or spoken to women while in this condition.\r\n  Frivolity and coarseness were excluded. In agreement with Westphal,\r\n  the author regards S. as belonging “to a class of individuals of\r\n  peculiar hypochondriacal tendencies, in whom the attention is\r\n  constantly directed, in an abnormal way, to certain bodily sensations\r\n  and processes; who brood over these, connecting all kinds of peculiar\r\n  conceptions with them, at last making use of quite as strange means to\r\n  combat the bodily sensations and ideas.” At least, S.’s act was due to\r\n  pathological sensation and idea, and S. was in a condition of\r\n  pathological disturbance of mental action at the time of the\r\n  commission of his acts. In the case of this exhibitionist, the manner\r\n  of satisfaction of the sexual instinct may be considered as peculiar\r\n  to the individual. (Liman, _Vierteljahrsschrift für gerichtel. Med._,\r\n  N. F. xxxviii, Heft 2.)\r\n\r\n  Case 174. X., aged 38; married; father of one child. Always sullen and\r\n  silent. Suffers frequently with headache. Very neurasthenic, though\r\n  not insane. He is troubled much at night by pollutions. He has\r\n  repeatedly followed shop-girls, for whom he had lain in wait, exposing\r\n  and handling his genitals. In one case he even followed a girl into a\r\n  shop. (Trochon, _Arch. de l’anthropologie criminelle_, iii, p. 256.)\r\n\r\nIn the following case the exhibition seems subsidiary to the impulsive\r\ndesire to satisfy sudden, intense libido, by means of masturbation:—\r\n\r\n  Case 175. R., coachman, aged 49, Vienna; married since 1866;\r\n  childless. Father neuropathic and given to sexual excesses; died of\r\n  cerebral disease. He presents no degenerative signs.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twenty-nine he suffered a severe concussion by falling\r\n  from a height. Up to that time the vita sexualis had been normal.\r\n  Since that time, every three or four months, he has been seized with\r\n  very painful sexual excitement, accompanied by an intense desire to\r\n  masturbate. A feeling of weariness and discomfort, with a desire for\r\n  alcoholic indulgence, precedes this. In the intervals he is sexually\r\n  cold, and has but very infrequent desire for his wife, who, moreover,\r\n  for five years has been sick, and incapable of cohabitation. He gives\r\n  the assurance that, as a young man, he never masturbated, and that, in\r\n  the intervals between his attacks, he has never thought of satisfying\r\n  himself sexually in this way.\r\n\r\n  The impulse to masturbation during the attack is always excited by\r\n  certain feminine charms,—short cloak, pretty foot and ankle, elegant\r\n  appearance. Age makes no difference; even little girls excite him. The\r\n  impulse is sudden and unconquerable. R. describes the situation and\r\n  act as characteristically impulsive. He had often tried to resist it;\r\n  but then he would grow hot, terribly frightened, his head would burn,\r\n  and he would seem to be in a fog; but he never lost consciousness. At\r\n  the same time he would have violent, darting pain in the testicles and\r\n  spermatic cords. He regretted it, but had to confess that the impulse\r\n  was stronger than his will. In such a situation it forced him to\r\n  masturbate, no matter where he might be. After ejaculation he would\r\n  become calm, and regain his self-control. He regarded it as a terrible\r\n  affliction. Defense shows that R. has been punished six times for\r\n  similar offenses—exhibition and masturbation in the open street.\r\n\r\n  On November 4, 1889, R., while in his worst condition, happened to be\r\n  in the street as a crowd of school-girls went by. This awakened his\r\n  unconquerable impulse. There was not time to run to a closet, he was\r\n  so excited. There was immediate exhibition, masturbation in front of a\r\n  house,—great scandal and immediate arrest. R. is not weak-minded, and\r\n  has no ethical defect. He bemoans his fate, deeply regrets his act,\r\n  and fears new attacks. He regards his condition as abnormal,—as a fate\r\n  against which he is powerless.\r\n\r\n  He thinks himself still virile. Penis abnormally large. Cremasteric\r\n  reflex present; patellar reflex increased. Weakness of the sphincter\r\n  of the bladder, that has existed for some years. Various neurasthenic\r\n  difficulties.\r\n\r\n  The opinion showed that R. was subject to the influence of abnormal\r\n  conditions, and had acted impulsively. Patient was sent to an asylum,\r\n  from which he was discharged after a few months.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing case the important point, clinically, lies not in the\r\nneurosis that is present, but rather in the impulsive character of the\r\nact (exhibition dependent on masturbation).\r\n\r\nWith the enumeration of the categories of imbeciles, of mentally\r\nweakened individuals, and of the exhibitionists that are in a neurotic\r\n(epileptic or neurasthenic) state of imperfect consciousness, apparently\r\nthe clinical and forensic side of this phenomenon is still unexhausted;\r\nin addition to these, there is another class, the representatives of\r\nwhich, owing to deep hereditary taint (hereditary degenerative\r\nneurosis?), are impelled to periodical and very impulsive exhibition.\r\n\r\nWith reference to these conditions of psychopathia sexualis periodica\r\n(comp. “Periodical Insanity”), in which the accidentally-awakened\r\nimpulse to exhibition is but a partial manifestation of a clinical\r\nwhole, like dipsomania periodica, Magnan, from whom I borrow the\r\nfollowing instructive cases, justly lays the greatest stress upon the\r\nimpulsive, periodical feature of these abnormal impulses; and no less\r\nupon the fact that they are often accompanied by terrible anxiety,\r\nwhich, after the realization of the impulse, gives place to a feeling of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThese facts, and no less, the clinical picture of degeneracy that, for\r\nthe most part, is referable to injurious conditions that are hereditary,\r\nor that exercise an injurious effect on the development of brain in\r\nearly years (rachitis, etc.), are, medicolegally, of decisive importance\r\n[with reference to the question of responsibility].\r\n\r\n  Case 176. G., aged 29, waiter in a _café_. In 1888, while standing\r\n  under a church-door, he exhibited himself to several girls working\r\n  opposite. He confessed the act, and also that, many times, in the same\r\n  place and at the same time of day, he had been guilty of the same\r\n  crime, having been punished for it, the year before, with imprisonment\r\n  for one month.\r\n\r\n  G. has very nervous parents. His father is mentally unstable and very\r\n  irascible. His mother is at times insane, and suffers with severe\r\n  nervous disease.\r\n\r\n  G. has always had nervous twitching of the face, and constant\r\n  alternation of causeless depression, with tædium vitæ, and periods of\r\n  elation. At the ages of ten and fifteen, for slight cause, he wished\r\n  to commit suicide. When excited, he has similar twitching of the\r\n  extremities. He presents constant general analgesia. In prison he was\r\n  at first beside himself with shame about the disgrace he had brought\r\n  on his family, and said he was the worst of men, deserving the\r\n  severest punishment.\r\n\r\n  Until his nineteenth year G. had satisfied himself with solitary and\r\n  mutual masturbation, and, on one occasion, he had practiced onanism\r\n  with a girl. From that time, working in a _café_, the female customers\r\n  had excited him so intensely that ejaculation was often induced. He\r\n  suffered with almost constant priapism, and, as his wife stated, in\r\n  spite of coitus, it often disturbed his rest at night. For seven years\r\n  he had repeatedly exhibited himself at his window, and also exposed\r\n  himself naked to female neighbors living opposite.\r\n\r\n  In 1883 he married out of desire. Marital intercourse did not satisfy\r\n  his needs. At times his sexual excitement was so intense that he had\r\n  headache, and seemed confused, like one drunk, strange, and incapable\r\n  of work.\r\n\r\n  Case 177. B., aged 27; of neuropathic mother and alcoholic father. He\r\n  has one brother who is a drinker; and an hysterical sister.\r\n\r\n  After his eleventh year, onanism, solitary or mutual. After his\r\n  fifteenth year, impulses to exhibition. He attempted it at a\r\n  street-urinal; he felt pleasure in it, but also immediately twinges of\r\n  conscience. If he attempted to oppose his impulse thereafter, he\r\n  became apprehensive, and had a feeling of oppression in his chest.\r\n  When a soldier, he was often impelled to expose himself, under various\r\n  pretexts, to his comrades.\r\n\r\n  After his seventeenth year he had sexual congress with women. It gave\r\n  him great pleasure to show himself naked before them. He continued his\r\n  exhibition on the street. Since he could but infrequently count on\r\n  female spectators at urinals, he changed his place to churches. In\r\n  order to exhibit himself at such places, he always had to strengthen\r\n  his courage by drinking. Under the influence of spirits, the impulse,\r\n  at other times controllable with difficulty, became irresistible. He\r\n  was not sentenced. He lost his position, and then drank more. Not long\r\n  after, he was again arrested for exhibition and masturbation in a\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  Case 178. X., aged 35; barber’s assistant. Repeatedly punished for\r\n  offense against decency, he is again arrested; for, during three\r\n  weeks, he had been hanging around girls’ schools, trying to attract\r\n  the attention of the pupils, and, when he had succeeded in this, had\r\n  exhibited himself. Occasionally he had promised them money, with the\r\n  words, “Habeo mentulam pulcherrimam, venite ad me ut eam lambatis.” At\r\n  his examination X. confessed everything, but did not know how it had\r\n  come about. He was the most reasonable of men in other respects, but\r\n  had the impulse to commit this crime, and could not overcome it.\r\n\r\n  In 1879, when in the army, he was once out on leave, and had run\r\n  around exhibiting himself to children: imprisonment for a year. The\r\n  same crime in 1881. He chased the crying children, and “stared” at\r\n  them: imprisonment of one year and three months. Two days after his\r\n  discharge, he said to two little girls: “If you want to see my tail,\r\n  come with me to this (market) booth.” He denied these words, and\r\n  claimed drunkenness: imprisonment for three months.\r\n\r\n  In 1883, renewed exhibition; during the act he said nothing. At his\r\n  examination he stated that, since a severe illness, eight years\r\n  previously, he had suffered with such excitations: imprisonment for\r\n  one month.\r\n\r\n  In 1884, exhibition before girls in a church-yard; again in 1885. He\r\n  declared: “I understand my crime, but it is like a disease. When it\r\n  comes over me, I cannot keep from such acts. It sometimes happens\r\n  that, for quite a long time, I am free from these inclinations.”\r\n  Imprisonment for six months.\r\n\r\n  Discharged on August 12, 1885, he had a relapse on August 15. The same\r\n  excuse was given. This time he underwent medical examination. The\r\n  examination revealed no mental disturbance. Sentenced to three years.\r\n  After discharge, a series of new exhibitions. On this occasion,\r\n  examination revealed the following:—\r\n\r\n  His father suffered with chronic alcoholism, and is said to have been\r\n  guilty of the same crime. Mother and sister nervously ill, and the\r\n  whole family of excitable temperament.\r\n\r\n  _From his seventh to his eighteenth year X. suffered with epileptic\r\n  convulsions._ First cohabitation at sixteen; later, gonorrhœa and, it\r\n  is stated, syphilis. After that, normal sexual intercourse until his\r\n  twenty-first year. At that time he often had to pass a play-ground,\r\n  and he occasionally had to urinate there; and it happened that the\r\n  children looked at him, out of curiosity.\r\n\r\n  He noticed, occasionally, that this looking at him caused him sexual\r\n  excitement, and induced erection, and even ejaculation. He now found\r\n  more pleasure in this kind of sexual gratification, and became\r\n  indifferent about coitus, satisfying himself only in this manner. He\r\n  felt that all his thought was ruled by this, and he dreamed only of\r\n  exhibitions, with pollutions. His attempts to control his impulse\r\n  became more and more ineffectual. It came over him with such force\r\n  that he noticed nothing around him, and saw and heard nothing, and was\r\n  like one “devoid of reason,”—like “a bull trying to butt his head\r\n  through a wall.”\r\n\r\n  X. has an abnormally broad head. Small penis; the left testicle\r\n  deformed. Patellar reflex absent. Symptoms of neurasthenia, especially\r\n  cerebral. Frequent pollutions. For the most part, his dreams are about\r\n  normal coitus, only infrequently about exhibition before little girls.\r\n\r\n  With reference to his sexual acts, he states that the impulse to seek\r\n  and approach little girls is primary; only when he has succeeded in\r\n  attracting their attention to his exposed genitals do erection and\r\n  ejaculation occur. He does not lose consciousness in the act. After it\r\n  he is troubled about his deed, and, if undiscovered, says to himself,\r\n  “Once more I have escaped the authorities.”\r\n\r\n  In prison he did not have the impulse; there, he was troubled only\r\n  with dreams and pollutions. In freedom he had daily sought opportunity\r\n  to satisfy himself with exhibition. He would give ten years of his\r\n  life to be free from the thing; “this life of constant anxiety, this\r\n  alternation between freedom and imprisonment, is unendurable.”\r\n\r\n  The opinion assumed a congenital (?) perversity of the sexual\r\n  instinct, with unmistakable hereditary taint, neuropathic\r\n  constitution, asymmetry of cranium, and defective development of the\r\n  genitals.\r\n\r\n  It is also worthy of remark _that the exhibition began when the\r\n  epilepsy ceased; so that one might think of a vicarious phenomenon_.\r\n\r\n  The sexual perversity developed, with predisposition, through\r\n  accidental association of ideas of sexual content (children looking at\r\n  him while urinating) with an act that, in itself, was purposeless.\r\n\r\n  The patient was not sentenced, but sent to an asylum. (Dr. Freyer,\r\n  _Zeitschr. f. Medicinalbeamte_, 3 Jahrg., No. 8.)\r\n\r\n  Case 179. At 9 o’clock at night, in the spring of 1891, a lady, in\r\n  great trepidation, came to the policeman in the city park of X., with\r\n  the statement that a man, absolutely naked in front, had approached\r\n  her from the bushes, and she had run away, frightened. The officer\r\n  went at once to the place indicated, and found a man, who exposed\r\n  ventrem et genitalia nuda. He attempted to escape, but was overtaken\r\n  and arrested. He stated that he had been sexually excited by alcohol,\r\n  and had been on the point of going to a prostitute. On his way through\r\n  the park, however, he recalled the fact that exhibition gave him much\r\n  greater pleasure than was afforded him by coitus, in which he seldom,\r\n  and only _faute de mieux_, indulged. After drawing up his shirt, he\r\n  posted himself in the bushes, and, when two women came up the path, he\r\n  approached them with exposed genitals. In such exhibition he had a\r\n  pleasurable feeling of warmth, and the blood mounted to his head.\r\n\r\n  The accused works in a manufactory, and his employer states that he is\r\n  faithful, saving, sober, and intelligent.\r\n\r\n  In 1886 B. had been punished because he had twice exhibited himself\r\n  publicly,—once in broad daylight, and once at night, under a lamp.\r\n\r\n  B., aged 37, single, makes a peculiar impression, owing to his\r\n  dandified dress and affected manner. His eyes have a neuropathic,\r\n  languishing expression; around his mouth plays a smile of\r\n  self-satisfaction. He is said to come of healthy parents. A sister of\r\n  his father, and one of his mother, were insane. Others of their\r\n  relatives were thought religiously eccentric.\r\n\r\n  B. has never had any severe illness. From childhood he was eccentric\r\n  and imaginative. He loved romances about knights and others, was\r\n  entirely absorbed by them, and even went so far as to identify himself\r\n  in fancy with the heroes. He always thought himself a little better\r\n  than others, and thought much of elegant dress and ornament; and when\r\n  he strutted about on Sundays, he imagined himself a high official.\r\n\r\n  B. has never had epileptic symptoms. In youth, moderate indulgence in\r\n  masturbation; later, moderate indulgence in coitus. Previously, never\r\n  any perverse sexual feelings or impulses. Retired manner of life; in\r\n  leisure hours, reading (popular novels, heroic tales, Dumas, and\r\n  others). B. was no drinker. Exceptionally he made himself a kind of\r\n  punch, by which he was always excited sexually.\r\n\r\n  For some years, with marked decrease of libido, after such alcoholic\r\n  indulgence, he had had “accursedly silly thoughts,” and developed the\r\n  desire genitalia adspectui feminarum publice exhibere.\r\n\r\n  If he got into this state, he felt warm, his heart beat violently,\r\n  blood rushed to his head, and he could then no longer resist his\r\n  impulse. He heard and saw nothing more, and was absolutely absorbed in\r\n  his lust. Afterward he had often pounded his crazy head with his\r\n  fists, and firmly resolved never to do such a thing again; but the\r\n  crazy ideas had always returned.\r\n\r\n  In his exhibition his penis became only half-erected, and ejaculation\r\n  never occurred; even in coitus it was always tardy. In exhibition he\r\n  was satisfied with genitalia sua adspicere, and he had the lustful\r\n  thought that this sight must be very pleasant to women, since he liked\r\n  so much to see genitalia feminarum. He was capable of coitus only when\r\n  the puella showed herself very partial to him; without this, he\r\n  preferred rather to pay and go without doing anything. In his dreams\r\n  he exhibited himself to young, voluptuous women.\r\n\r\n  The medico-legal opinion recognized the hereditary psychopathic\r\n  character of the culprit, and the perverse, impulsive desire to\r\n  perform the incriminating acts; and pointed out, further, the\r\n  remarkable fact that in B., who was otherwise sober and saving, the\r\n  impulses to indulge in alcohol depended on abnormal conditions that\r\n  recurred periodically, and forced him to indulge. That, during his\r\n  attacks, B. was in an exceptional psychical state, in a kind of mental\r\n  confusion, and absolutely absorbed in his perverse sexual fancy, is\r\n  clearly shown by the _species facti_. Thus is explained the fact that\r\n  he became aware of the approach of the police only when it was too\r\n  late to try to escape. In this hereditary and degenerate impulsive\r\n  exhibitionism, it is interesting to note how the perverse sexual\r\n  impulse is awakened from its latency by the influence of alcohol.\r\n\r\nA forensically important variety of exhibition, which, clinically,\r\ncertainly rests upon a similar neurotic and degenerate foundation, and\r\nwhich expresses itself in a peculiar act, conditioned by violent libido\r\n(hyperæsthesia sexualis), associated with diminished virility, is made\r\nup of the so-called _frotteurs_.\r\n\r\nThe three following cases, borrowed from Magnan (_op. cit._), are\r\ntypical:—\r\n\r\n  Case 180. D., aged 44, hereditarily predisposed, drinker, and\r\n  suffering with lead poisoning. Until the last year he had masturbated\r\n  much, and often drawn pornographic pictures, and shown them to his\r\n  acquaintances. He had repeatedly dressed himself as a woman in secret.\r\n  For two years, since becoming impotent, he had felt desire, while in\r\n  crowds at dusk, mentulam denudare eamque ad nates mulieris crassissimæ\r\n  terere. Once, when discovered in the act, he had been sentenced to\r\n  imprisonment for four months.\r\n\r\n  His wife kept a milk-shop. Iterum iterumque sibi temperare non potuit\r\n  quin genitalia in ollam lacte completam mergeret. In the act he felt\r\n  lustful pleasure, “as if touched with velvet.” He was cynical enough\r\n  to use this milk for himself and the customers. During imprisonment\r\n  alcoholic persecutory insanity developed in him.\r\n\r\n  Case 181. M., aged 31; married six years; father of four children;\r\n  badly predisposed; subject to melancholia at times. Three years\r\n  before, he was discovered by his wife with a silk dress on,\r\n  masturbating. One day he was discovered, in a store, in the act of\r\n  _frottage_ on a lady. He was very repentant, and asked to be severely\r\n  punished for his irresistible impulse.\r\n\r\n  Case 182. G., aged 33; badly predisposed hereditarily. At an\r\n  omnibus-station he was discovered in the act of _frottage_ with his\r\n  penis on a lady. Deep repentance; but he stated that at the sight of a\r\n  noticeable posteriora of a lady, he was irresistibly impelled to\r\n  practice _frottage_, and that he became confused and knew not what he\r\n  did. Sent to an asylum.\r\n\r\n  Case 183. A _frotteur_. Z., born in 1850; of blameless life\r\n  previously; of good family; private official. He is well-to-do\r\n  financially; untainted. After a short married life he became a\r\n  widower, in 1873. For some time he had attracted attention in\r\n  churches, because he crowded up behind women, both old and young\r\n  indifferently, and toyed with their tournures. He was watched, and one\r\n  day he was arrested in the act. Z. was terribly frightened, and in\r\n  despair about his situation; and, in making a full confession, he\r\n  begged for pardon, for nothing but suicide remained for him.\r\n\r\n  For two years he had been subject to the unhappy impulse to go in\r\n  crowds of people,—in churches, at box-offices of theatres, etc,—and\r\n  press up behind females and manipulate the prominent portion of their\r\n  dresses, having orgasm and ejaculation during the act.\r\n\r\n  Z. states that he was never given to masturbation, and had never been\r\n  in any way perverse sexually. Since the early death of his wife, he\r\n  had gratified his great sexual desire in temporary love-affairs,\r\n  having always had an aversion for prostitutes and brothels. The\r\n  impulse to _frottage_ had suddenly seized him, two years before, while\r\n  he happened to be in church. Though he was conscious that it was\r\n  wrong, he could not help yielding to it immediately. Since then he had\r\n  been excitable to the posteriora of females, and had been actually\r\n  impelled to seek opportunity for _frottage_. The only thing on women\r\n  that excited him was the tournure; every other part of the body and\r\n  attire was a matter of indifference to him; and it made no difference\r\n  to him whether the woman was old or young, beautiful or ugly. Since\r\n  this began, he had had no more inclination for natural gratification.\r\n  Of late _frottage_ scenes had appeared in his dreams. During his acts\r\n  he was fully conscious of his situation and the act, and tried to\r\n  perform it in such a way as to attract as little attention as\r\n  possible. After his act he was always ashamed of what he had done.\r\n\r\n  The medical examination revealed no sign of mental disease or mental\r\n  weakness, but symptoms of neurasthenia sexualis,—ex abstinentia\r\n  libidinosi (?),—which was also proved by the circumstance that even\r\n  simple touching of the fetich with the unexposed genitals sufficed to\r\n  induce ejaculation. Apparently Z., weakened sexually and distrusting\r\n  his virility, and yet libidinous, had come to practice _frottage_ by\r\n  having the sight of posteriora feminæ fall together accidentally with\r\n  sexual excitement; and this associative combination of a perception\r\n  with a feeling permitted the former to attain the significance of a\r\n  fetich.\r\n\r\nAs an act which offends public morals, and which is, therefore,\r\npunishable, the violation of statues—a whole series of cases of which\r\nMoreau (_op. cit._) has collected from ancient and modern times—may be\r\nenumerated here. They are, unfortunately, given too much like anecdotes\r\nto allow satisfactory judgment of them. They always give the impression\r\nof being pathological,—like the story of a young man (related by\r\nLucianus and St. Clemens, of Alexandria) who made use of a Venus of\r\nPraxiteles for the gratification of his lust; and the case of Clisyphus,\r\nwho violated the statue of a goddess in the Temple of Samos, after\r\nhaving placed a piece of meat on a certain part. In modern times, the\r\n_Journal L’événement_ of March 4, 1877, relates the story of a gardener\r\nwho fell in love with a statue of the Venus of Milo, and was discovered\r\nattempting coitus with it. At any rate, these cases stand in etiological\r\nrelation with abnormally intense libido and defective virility or\r\ncourage, or lack of opportunity for normal sexual gratification.\r\n\r\nThe same thing, must be assumed in the case of the so-called\r\n_voyeurs_,[130]—_i.e._, men who are so cynical that they seek to get\r\nsight of coitus, in order to assist their virility; or who seek to have\r\norgasm and ejaculation at the sight of an excited woman. Concerning this\r\nmoral aberration, which, for various reasons, cannot be further\r\ndescribed here, it will suffice to refer to Coffignon’s book, “La\r\nCorruption à Paris.” The revelations, in the domain of sexual\r\nperversity, and also perversion, which this book makes, are horrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. RAPE AND LUST-MURDER.\r\n\r\n   (Austrian Statutes, § 125, 127; Austrian Abridgment, § 192; German\r\n                           Statutes, § 177.)\r\n\r\nBy the term rape, the jurist understands coitus, outside of the marriage\r\nrelation, with an adult, enforced by means of threats or violence; or\r\nwith an adult in a condition of defenselessness or unconsciousness; or\r\nwith a girl under the age of fourteen years. Immissio penis, or, at\r\nleast, conjunctio membrorum (Schütze), is necessary to establish the\r\nfact. To-day, rape on children is remarkably frequent. Hofmann (“Ger.\r\nMed.,” i, p. 155) and Tardieu (“Attentats”) report horrible cases.\r\n\r\nThe latter establishes the fact that, from 1851 to 1875 inclusive,\r\n22,017 cases of rape came before the courts in France, and, of these,\r\n17,657 were committed on children.\r\n\r\nThe crime of rape presumes a temporary, powerful excitation of sexual\r\ndesire, induced by excess in alcohol, or by some other condition. It is\r\nhighly improbable that a man morally intact would commit this most\r\nbrutal crime. Lombroso (Goltdammer’s _Arch._) considers the majority of\r\nmen who commit rape to be degenerate, particularly when the crime is\r\ndone on children or old women. He asserts that, in many such men, he has\r\nfound actual signs of degeneracy.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that rape is very often the act of degenerate male\r\nimbeciles,[131] where, under some circumstances, the bond of blood is\r\nnot respected.\r\n\r\nCases as a result of mania, satyriasis, and epilepsy, have occurred, and\r\nare to be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nThe crime of rape may follow the murder of the victim.[132] There may be\r\nunintentional murder, murder to destroy the only witness of the crime,\r\nor murder out of lust (_v. supra_). Only for cases of the latter kind\r\nshould the term _lust-murder_[133] be used.\r\n\r\nThe motives of lust-murder have been previously considered. The cases\r\ngiven in illustration are characteristic of the manner of the deed. The\r\npresumption of a murder out of lust is always given when injuries of the\r\ngenitals are found, the character and extent of which are such as could\r\nnot be explained by merely a brutal attempt at coitus; and, still more,\r\nwhen the body has been opened, or parts (intestines, genitals) torn out,\r\nand are wanting.[134]\r\n\r\nLust-murders dependent upon psychopathic conditions are never committed\r\nwith accomplices.\r\n\r\n  Case 184. _Weak-mindedness, Epilepsy. Attempt at Rape; Murder._—On the\r\n  evening of May 27, 1888, an eight-year-old boy, Blasius, was playing\r\n  with other children in the neighborhood of the village of S. An\r\n  unknown man came along and enticed the boy into the woods. The next\r\n  day the boy’s body was found in a ravine, with the abdomen slit open,\r\n  an incised wound in the cardiac region, and two stab-wounds in the\r\n  neck.\r\n\r\n  Since, on May 21st, a man, answering to the description given of the\r\n  murderer by the children, had attempted to treat a six-year-old girl\r\n  in a similar manner, and had only accidentally been detected, it was\r\n  presumed to be a case of lust-murder. It was proved that the body was\r\n  found in a heap, with only the shirt and jacket on; also, that there\r\n  was a long incision in the scrotum.\r\n\r\n  Suspicion fell upon a peasant, E.; but, on confrontation with the\r\n  children, it was not possible to identify him with the stranger who\r\n  had enticed the boy into the woods. Besides, with the help of his\r\n  sister, he proved an alibi. The untiring efforts of the officers\r\n  brought new evidence to light, and finally E. confessed. He had\r\n  enticed the girl into the woods, thrown her down, exposed her\r\n  genitals, and was about to abuse her; but, as she had an eruption on\r\n  her head, and was crying loudly, his desire cooled, and he fled.\r\n\r\n  After he enticed the boy into the woods, with the pretext of showing\r\n  him a bird’s nest, he was taken with a desire to abuse him. Since the\r\n  boy refused to take off his trousers, he did it for him; and when the\r\n  boy began to cry out, he stabbed him twice in the neck. Then he made\r\n  an incision, just above the pubes, in imitation of female genitals, in\r\n  order to use it to satisfy his lust. But, since the body grew cold\r\n  immediately, he lost his desire, and, cleaning his knife and hands\r\n  near the body, he fled. When he saw the boy dead, he was filled with\r\n  fear, and his limbs became weak.\r\n\r\n  During his examination E. looked apathetically at a garland. He had\r\n  acted in a state of mental weakness. He could not understand how he\r\n  came to do such a thing. He must have been beside himself; for he\r\n  often became senseless, so that he would almost fall down. Previous\r\n  employers report that he had periods when he was devoid of thought and\r\n  confused, doing no work all day, and avoiding others. His father\r\n  states that E. learned with difficulty, was unskillful at work, and\r\n  often so obstinate that one did not think to punish him. At such times\r\n  he would not eat, and occasionally ran away and remained all day. At\r\n  such times he also seemed quite lost in thought, screwed his face up,\r\n  and said senseless things. When quite a boy, he still sometimes wet\r\n  the bed, and often came home from school with wet or soiled clothing.\r\n  He was very restless in sleep, so that no one could sleep beside him.\r\n  He had never had playmates. He had never been cruel, bad, or immoral.\r\n\r\n  His mother gave similar testimony; and further, that, in his fifth\r\n  year, E. first had convulsions, and once lost the power of speech for\r\n  seven days. Sometime about his seventh year he once had convulsions\r\n  for forty days, and was also dropsical. Later, too, he was often\r\n  seized in sleep, and he often then talked in his sleep; and mornings,\r\n  after such nights, the bed was found wet.\r\n\r\n  At times it was impossible to do anything with him. Since his mother\r\n  did not know whether it was due to viciousness or disease, she did not\r\n  venture to punish him.\r\n\r\n  Since his convulsions, in his seventh year, he had failed so in mind\r\n  that he could not learn even the common prayers; and he also became\r\n  very irascible.\r\n\r\n  Neighbors, persons prominent in the community, and teachers, state\r\n  that E. was peculiar, weak-minded, and irascible; that at times he was\r\n  very strange, and apparently in an exceptional mental state.\r\n\r\n  The examinations of the medical experts gave the following results:—\r\n\r\n  E. is tall, slim, and poorly nourished. His head measures 53\r\n  centimetres in circumference. The cranium is rhombic, and in the\r\n  occipital region flattened.\r\n\r\n  His expression is devoid of intelligence; his glance is fixed,\r\n  expressionless; his attitude is careless, and his body is bent\r\n  forward. Movements are slow and heavy. Genitals normally developed.\r\n  E.’s whole appearance points to torpidity and mental weakness.\r\n\r\n  There are no signs of degenerative marks, no abnormality of the\r\n  vegetative organs, and no disturbances of motility or sensibility. He\r\n  comes of a perfectly healthy family. He knows nothing of convulsions\r\n  or of wetting his bed at night, but he states that, of late years, he\r\n  has had attacks of vertigo and loss of mind.\r\n\r\n  At first, in circumlocution, he denies the murder. Later, in great\r\n  contrition, before the examining judge, he confessed all, and gave a\r\n  clear motive for his crime. He had never had such a thought before.\r\n\r\n  He has been given to onanism for years; he even practiced it twice\r\n  daily. He states that, for want of courage, he had never ventured to\r\n  ask coitus of a woman, though in dreams such scenes exclusively passed\r\n  before him. Neither in dreams nor in the waking state had he ever had\r\n  perverse instincts; particularly no sadistic or contrary sexual\r\n  feelings. Too, the sight of the slaughter of animals had never\r\n  interested him. When he enticed the girl into the woods, his desire\r\n  was to satisfy his lust with her; but how it happened that he tried\r\n  such a thing with a boy, he could not explain. He thought he must have\r\n  been out of his mind at that time. The night after the murder he could\r\n  not sleep on account of fear; he had twice confessed already, to ease\r\n  his conscience. He was only afraid of being hung. This should not be\r\n  done, as he had done the deed in a weak-minded condition.\r\n\r\n  He could not tell why he had cut open the boy’s abdomen. It had not\r\n  occurred to him to handle the intestines, smell them, etc. He stated\r\n  that, after the attempt on the girl in the day-time, and in the night,\r\n  after the murder of the boy, he had convulsions. At the time of his\r\n  crime he was indeed conscious, but he had not thought at all of what\r\n  he did.\r\n\r\n  He suffered much with headache; could not endure heat, thirst, or\r\n  alcohol; there were times when he was perfectly confused. The test of\r\n  his intelligence showed a high grade of weak-mindedness.\r\n\r\n  The opinion (Dr. Kautzner, of Graz) showed the imbecility and neurosis\r\n  of the accused, and made it probable that his crime, for which he had\r\n  only a general recollection, had been committed in an exceptional\r\n  (præ-epileptic) mental state, conditioned by the neurosis. Under all\r\n  circumstances, E. was considered dangerous, and probably would require\r\n  commitment to an asylum for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. BODILY INJURY, INJURY TO PROPERTY, AND TORTURE OF ANIMALS DEPENDENT\r\n                            ON SADISM.[135]\r\n\r\n (Austrian, § 152, 411; German, § 223 [bodily injury]. Austrian, § 85,\r\n 468; German, § 303 [injury to property]. Austrian Police Regulations;\r\n             German Statutes, § 360 [torture of animals].)\r\n\r\nAside from lust-murder, described in the foregoing section, as milder\r\nexpressions of sadistic desires, impulses to stab, flagellate, or defile\r\nfemales, to flagellate boys, to maltreat animals, etc., also occur.\r\n\r\nThe deep degenerative significance of such cases is clearly demonstrated\r\nby the series of examples given under “General Pathology.” Such mentally\r\ndegenerate individuals, should they be unable to control their perverse\r\nimpulses, could only be objects of care in asylums.\r\n\r\n\r\n      4. BODILY INJURY, ROBBERY, AND THEFT DEPENDENT ON FETICHISM.\r\n\r\n (Austrian, § 190; German, § 249 [robbery]. Austrian, § 171, 460; German,\r\n                             § 242 [theft].)\r\n\r\nIt is seen from the section on fetichism, under “General Pathology,”\r\nthat pathological fetichism may become the cause of crimes. There are\r\nnow recognized, as such, hair-despoiling (Cases 78, 79, 80); robbery or\r\ntheft of female linen, handkerchiefs, aprons (Cases 82, 83, 85, 86),\r\nshoes (Cases 68, 87, 88), and silks (Case 93). It cannot be doubted that\r\nsuch individuals are subjects of deep mental taint. But, for the\r\nassumption of an absence of mental freedom and consequent\r\nirresponsibility, it must be proved that there was an irresistible\r\nimpulse, which, either owing to the strength of the impulse itself, or\r\nto the existence of mental weakness, made control of the punishable,\r\nperverse impulsion impossible. Such crimes and the peculiar manner in\r\nwhich they are performed,—in which they differ very much from common\r\nrobbery and theft,—always demand a medico-legal examination. But that\r\nthe act _per se_ does not, by any means, necessarily arise from\r\npsycho-pathological conditions is shown by the infrequent cases of\r\nhair-despoiling[136] simply for the purpose of gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n         5. VIOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\n   (Austrian Statutes, § 128, 132; Austrian Abridgment, § 189, 191^3;\r\n                     German Statutes, § 174, 176^3)\r\n\r\nBy violation of sexually immature individuals, the jurist understands\r\nall the possible immoral acts with persons under fourteen years of age\r\nthat are not comprehended in the term rape. The term violation, in the\r\nlegal sense of the word, comprehends the most horrible perversions and\r\nacts, which are possible only to a man who is controlled by lust and\r\nmorally weak, and, as is usually the case, lacking in sexual power.\r\n\r\nA common feature of these crimes, committed on persons that are more or\r\nless children, is that they are unmanly, childish, and often silly. It\r\nis a fact that such acts, with exceptions in pathological cases, like\r\nthose of imbeciles, paretics, and senile dements, are almost exclusively\r\ncommitted by young men who lack courage or have no faith in their\r\nvirility; or by _roués_ who have, to some extent, lost their virility.\r\nIt is psychologically incomprehensible that an adult of full virility,\r\nand mentally sound, should indulge in sexual abuses with children.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of debauchees, in actively or passively picturing the\r\nimmoral acts, is exceedingly lively; and that the following enumeration\r\nof the sexual acts of this kind known to law exhausts all the\r\npossibilities is questionable. Most frequently the abuse consists of\r\nsexual handling (under some circumstances, flagellation[137]), active\r\nmanustupration, or seducing children by inducing them to perform\r\nonanism, or lustful handling, on the seducer. Less frequent acts are\r\ncunnilingus, irrumare on boys or girls, pædicatio puellarum, coitus\r\ninter femora, and exhibition.\r\n\r\n  In a case which Maschka reports (“Handb.,” iii, p. 174), a young man\r\n  had naked girls, from eight to twelve years old, dance about in his\r\n  room, and urinate before him, until he ejaculated. Not infrequently\r\n  boys are abused by sensual women, who undertake to bring about\r\n  conjunctio membrorum with them, in order to satisfy themselves by\r\n  means of friction or onanism.[138]\r\n\r\n  Tardieu saw one of the most disgusting examples. A servant, in company\r\n  with her lover, masturbated children intrusted to them, performed\r\n  cunnilingus with a girl of seven, and introduced parsnips and potatoes\r\n  into her vagina, and put similar things into the rectum of a baby of\r\n  two years!\r\n\r\n  Case 185. Z., aged 62; deeply tainted, masturbator. He states he has\r\n  never had coitus, but has frequently practiced fellatio. He is in an\r\n  asylum, on account of paranoia. It had been his greatest pleasure to\r\n  entice girls, aged from ten to fourteen years, and practice\r\n  cunnilingus and other vile acts with them. In these acts he had orgasm\r\n  and ejaculation. Masturbation did not give him the same satisfaction,\r\n  and induced ejaculation only with difficulty. _Faute de mieux_ he also\r\n  practiced fellatio with men; occasionally an exhibitionist. Phimosis;\r\n  asymmetrical cranium. (Pelanda, _Arch. di Psichiatria_, x. fascic. 3,\r\n  4.)\r\n\r\n  Case 186. X., priest, aged 40. He was accused of enticing girls, aged\r\n  from ten to thirteen, undressing and fondling them lustfully, and\r\n  finally masturbating. He is tainted, and has been an onanist from\r\n  childhood; morally imbecile; always very excitable sexually. Head\r\n  somewhat small. Penis unusually large; indications of hypospadiasis.\r\n  (Pelanda, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\n  Case 187. K., aged 23; laborer. He was accused and convicted of\r\n  repeatedly enticing boys, and now and then girls, to an out-of-the-way\r\n  place, and practicing abuses with them (mutual masturbation, fellatio\r\n  puerorum, fondling of the genitals of the girls).\r\n\r\n  K. is an imbecile, and physically deformed, being scarcely 1.5 metres\r\n  tall; cranium rachitic and hydrocephalic; teeth bad,—furrowed,\r\n  defective, and irregular. Large lips, idiotic expression, stuttering\r\n  speech, and an awkward attitude complete the picture of\r\n  psycho-physical degeneration. K. behaves like a child discovered in\r\n  some mischievous act. Scarcely any growth of beard. Genitals well and\r\n  normally developed. He has a superficial consciousness of having done\r\n  something improper, but he is unconscious of the moral, social, and\r\n  legal significance of his crimes.\r\n\r\n  K. comes of a drunken father, and a mother who became insane from the\r\n  abuse of her husband, and died in an asylum. In his babyhood the boy\r\n  was almost blinded by corneal ulcers, and, after his sixth year, he\r\n  grew up with an almoner, and later with difficulty earned his living\r\n  as an organ-grinder. His brother is good for nothing, and the culprit\r\n  himself was considered a surly, quarrelsome, evil, moody, irritable\r\n  man. The opinion emphasized the intellectual, moral, and physical\r\n  defect of the culprit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it must be admitted that the most revolting of these\r\ncrimes are done by sane individuals who, by reason of satiety in normal\r\nsexual indulgence, lasciviousness, and brutality, and not seldom during\r\nintoxication, forget that they are human beings.\r\n\r\nA great number of these cases, however, certainly depend upon\r\npathological states. This is particularly true where old men become the\r\nseducers of children.[139]\r\n\r\nI agree with Kirn, who, under all circumstances, in cases of this kind,\r\nholds a mental examination to be always necessary; since, frequently\r\nenough, a re-awakened, perverse, abnormally intense, and uncontrollable\r\nsexual desire is shown to be one of the manifestations of a senile\r\ndementia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6. UNNATURAL ABUSE—SODOMY.[140]\r\n\r\n (Austrian Statutes, § 129; Abridgment, § 190; German Statutes, § 175.)\r\n\r\n\r\n              (a) _Violation of Animals—Bestiality._[141]\r\n\r\nViolation of animals, monstrous and revolting as it seems to mankind, is\r\nby no means always due to psycho-pathological conditions. Low morality\r\nand great sexual desire, with lack of opportunity of natural indulgence,\r\nare the principal motives of this unnatural means of sexual\r\nsatisfaction, which is resorted to by women as well as by men.\r\n\r\n  To Polak we owe the knowledge that in Persia bestiality is frequently\r\n  practiced because of the delusion that it cures gonorrhœa; just as in\r\n  Europe an idea is still prevalent that intercourse with children heals\r\n  venereal disease.\r\n\r\n  Experience teaches that bestiality with cows and horses is none too\r\n  infrequent. Occasionally the acts may be undertaken with goats,\r\n  bitches, and, as a case of Tardieu’s and one by Schauenstein show\r\n  (Lehrb., p. 125), with hens.\r\n\r\n  The action of Frederick the Great, in the case of a cavalryman who had\r\n  committed bestiality with a mare, is well known: “The fellow is a\r\n  beast, and shall be reduced to the infantry.”\r\n\r\n  The intercourse of females with beasts is limited to dogs. A monstrous\r\n  example of the moral depravity in large cities is related by Maschka\r\n  (“Handb.,” iii),—the case of a Parisian female who showed herself in\r\n  the sexual act with a trained bull-dog, to a secret circle of _roués_,\r\n  at 10 francs a head.\r\n\r\nThere has been, heretofore, but little legal consideration of the mental\r\ncondition in those given to violation of animals. In several cases known\r\nto the writer, the individuals were weak-minded. In Schauenstein’s case\r\nthere was insanity.\r\n\r\nThe following case of bestiality is one that was certainly conditioned\r\nby disease. He was an epileptic. In this case the desire for animals\r\nappeared as an equivalent of the normal sexual desire:—\r\n\r\n  Case 188. X., peasant, aged 40; Greek-Catholic. Father and mother were\r\n  hard drinkers. Since his fifth year patient has had epileptic\r\n  convulsions,—_i.e._, he falls down unconscious, lies still two or\r\n  three minutes, and then gets up and runs wildly about with staring\r\n  eyes. Sexuality was first manifested at seventeen. The patient had\r\n  inclinations neither for women nor for men, but for animals (birds,\r\n  horses, etc.). He had intercourse with hens and ducks, and later with\r\n  horses and cows. Never any onanism.\r\n\r\n  The patient paints pictures of saints; is of very limited\r\n  intelligence. For years, religious paranoia, with states of ecstasy.\r\n  He has an “unspeakable” love for the Virgin, for whom he would\r\n  sacrifice his life. Taken to hospital, he proves to be free from\r\n  infirmity and signs of degeneration.\r\n\r\n  He had always had an aversion for women. In a single attempt at coitus\r\n  with a woman he was impotent, but with animals he was always potent.\r\n  He is ashamed before women; coitus with women he regards almost as a\r\n  sin. (Kowalewsky, _Jahrb. f. Psychiatrie_, vii, Heft 3.)\r\n\r\n  Case 189. On the afternoon of September 23, 1889, W., aged 16,\r\n  shoemaker’s apprentice, caught a goose in a neighbor’s garden, and\r\n  committed bestiality on the fowl until the neighbor approached. On\r\n  being accused by the neighbor, W. said, “Is there anything wrong with\r\n  the goose?” and then went away. At his examination he confessed the\r\n  act, but excused himself on the ground of temporary loss of mind.\r\n  Since a severe illness, in his twelfth year, he several times a month\r\n  had attacks, with heat in his head, in which he was intensely excited\r\n  sexually, could not help himself, and did not know what he did. He had\r\n  done the act in such an attack. He answered for himself in the same\r\n  way at the trial, and stated that he knew nothing of the _species\r\n  facti_ except from the statements of the neighbor. His father states\r\n  that W., who comes of a healthy family, has always been sickly since\r\n  an attack of scarlatina in his fifth year, and that, at the age of\r\n  twelve, he had a febrile cerebral disease. W. had a good reputation,\r\n  learned well in school, and, later, helped his father in his work. He\r\n  was not given to masturbation.\r\n\r\n  The medical examination revealed no intellectual or moral defect. The\r\n  physical examination revealed normal genitals; penis relatively\r\n  greatly developed; marked exaggeration of the patellar reflexes. In\r\n  other respects, negative result.\r\n\r\n  The history of the condition at the time of the deed was not to be\r\n  depended upon. There was no history of previous attacks of mental\r\n  disturbance, and there were none during the six weeks of observation.\r\n  There was no perversion of the vita sexualis. The medical opinion\r\n  allowed the possibility that some organic cause (cerebral congestion),\r\n  dependent upon cerebral disease, may have exercised an influence at\r\n  the time of the commission of the criminal act. (From the opinion of\r\n  Dr. Fritsch, of Vienna.)\r\n\r\n  Case 190. _Impulsive Sodomy._—A., aged 16; gardener’s boy; born out of\r\n  wedlock; father, unknown; mother, deeply tainted, hystero-epileptic.\r\n  A. has a deformed, asymmetrical cranium, and deformity and asymmetry\r\n  of the bones of the face; the whole skeleton is also deformed,\r\n  asymmetrical, and small. From childhood he was a masturbator; always\r\n  morose, apathetic, and fond of solitude; very irritable, and\r\n  pathological in his emotional reaction. He is imbecile, probably much\r\n  reduced physically by masturbation, and neurasthenic. Besides, he\r\n  presents hysteropathic symptoms (limitation of the visual field,\r\n  dyschromatopsia; diminution of the senses of smell, taste, and hearing\r\n  on the right side; anæsthesia of the right testicle, clavus, etc.).\r\n\r\n  A. is convicted of having committed masturbation and sodomy on dogs\r\n  and rabbits. When twelve years old he saw how boys masturbated a dog.\r\n  He imitated it, and thereafter he could not keep from abusing dogs,\r\n  cats, and rabbits in this vile manner. Much more frequently, however,\r\n  he committed sodomy on female rabbits,—the only animal that had a\r\n  charm for him. At dusk he was accustomed to repair to his master’s\r\n  rabbit-pen, in order to gratify his vile desire. Rabbits with torn\r\n  rectums were repeatedly found. The act of bestiality was always done\r\n  in the same manner. There were actual attacks which came on every\r\n  eight weeks, always in the evening, and always in the same way. A.\r\n  would become very uncomfortable, and have a feeling as if some one\r\n  were pounding his head. He felt as if losing his reason. He struggled\r\n  against the imperative idea of committing sodomy with the rabbits, and\r\n  thus had an increasing feeling of fear and intensification of\r\n  headache, until it became unbearable. At the height of the attack\r\n  there was sound of bells, cold perspiration, trembling of the knees,\r\n  and, finally, loss of resistive power, and impulsive performance of\r\n  the perverse act. As soon as this was done, he lost all anxiety; the\r\n  nervous cycle was completed, and he was again master of himself,\r\n  deeply ashamed of the deed, and fearful of the return of an attack. A.\r\n  states that, in such a condition, if called upon to choose between a\r\n  woman and a female rabbit, he could make choice only of the latter. In\r\n  the intervals, of all domestic animals, he is partial only to rabbits.\r\n  In his exceptional states simple caressing or kissing, etc., of the\r\n  rabbit suffices, as a rule, to afford him sexual satisfaction; but\r\n  sometimes he has, when doing this, such furor sexualis that he is\r\n  forced to wildly perform sodomy on the animal.\r\n\r\n  The acts of bestiality mentioned are the only acts which afford him\r\n  sexual satisfaction, and they constitute the only manner in which he\r\n  is capable of sexual indulgence. A. states that, in the act, he never\r\n  had a lustful feeling, but satisfaction, inasmuch as he was thus freed\r\n  from the painful condition into which he was brought by the imperative\r\n  impulse.\r\n\r\n  The medical evidence easily proved that this human monster was a\r\n  psychically degenerate, irresponsible invalid, and not a criminal.\r\n  (Boeteau, _La France médicale_, 38th year, No. 38.)\r\n\r\nThe following case seems to be devoid of a psychopathic basis:—\r\n\r\n  Case 191. _Sodomy._—In a provincial town a man was caught in\r\n  intercourse with a hen. He was thirty years old, and of high social\r\n  position. The chickens had been dying one after another, and the man\r\n  causing it had been searched for a long time. To the question of the\r\n  judge, as to the reason for such an act, the accused said that his\r\n  genitals were so small that coitus with women was impossible. Medical\r\n  examination showed that the genitals were actually extremely small.\r\n  The man was mentally entirely sound.\r\n\r\n  There were no statements concerning any abnormalities at the time of\r\n  puberty, etc. (Gyurkovechky, “Männl. Impotenz,” 1889, p. 82.)\r\n\r\n\r\n   (b) _With Persons of the Same Sex—Pederasty; Sodomy in its Strict\r\n                                Sense._\r\n\r\nGerman law takes cognizance of unnatural sexual relations only between\r\nmen; Austrian, between those of the same sex; and, therefore, unnatural\r\nrelations between women are punishable.\r\n\r\nAmong the immoralities between men, pederasty (immissio penis in anum)\r\nclaims the principal interest. Indeed, the jurist thought only of this\r\nperversity of sexual activity; and, according to the opinions of\r\ndistinguished interpreters of the law (Oppenhoff, “Stgsb.,” Berlin,\r\n1872, p. 324, and Rudolf and Stenglein, “D. Strafgesb. f. d. Deutsche\r\nReich,” 1881, p. 423), immissio penis in corpus vivum belongs to the\r\ncriminal act covered by § 175.\r\n\r\nAccording to this interpretation, legal punishment would not follow\r\nother improper acts between male persons, _so long as they were not\r\ncomplicated with offense to public decency, with force, or undertaken\r\nwith boys under the age of fourteen_. Of late this interpretation has\r\nagain been abandoned, and the crime of unnatural abuse between men has\r\nbeen assumed when merely acts _similar to cohabitation_ were\r\nperformed.[142]\r\n\r\nThe study of contrary sexual instinct has placed male love of males in a\r\nvery different light from that in which it, and particularly pederasty,\r\nstood at the time the statutes were framed. The fact that there is no\r\ndoubt about the pathological basis of many cases of contrary sexual\r\ninstinct shows that pederasty may also be the act of an irresponsible\r\nperson, and makes it necessary, in court, to examine not merely the\r\ndeed, but also the mental condition of the perpetrator.\r\n\r\nThe principles laid down previously must also be adhered to here. Not\r\nthe deed, but only an anthropological and clinical judgment of the\r\nperpetrator can permit a decision as to whether we have to do with a\r\nperversity deserving punishment, or with an abnormal perversion of the\r\nmental and sexual life, which, under certain circumstances, excludes\r\npunishment. The next legal question to settle is whether the contrary\r\nsexual feeling is congenital or acquired; and, in the latter case,\r\nwhether it is abnormal perversion or moral perversity.\r\n\r\nCongenital contrary sexual instinct occurs only in predisposed (tainted)\r\nindividuals, as a partial manifestation of a defect evidenced by\r\nanatomical or functional abnormalities, or both. The case becomes\r\nclearer, and the diagnosis more certain, if the individual, in character\r\nand disposition, seems to correspond entirely with his sexual\r\npeculiarity; and if the inclination toward persons of the opposite sex\r\nis entirely wanting, and horror of sexual intercourse with them is felt;\r\nand if the individual, in the impulses to satisfy the contrary sexual\r\ninstinct, shows other anomalies of the sexual sphere, such as more\r\npronounced degeneration in the form of periodicity of the impulse and\r\nimpulsive conduct, and is a neuropathic and psychopathic person.\r\n\r\nAnother question concerns the mental condition of the urning. If this be\r\nsuch as to remove the possibility of moral responsibility, then the\r\npederast is not a criminal, but an irresponsible insane person. This\r\ncondition in congenital urnings is apparently less frequent than\r\nanother. As a rule, these cases present elementary psychical\r\ndisturbances, which do not remove responsibility. But this does not\r\nsettle the question of the responsibility of the urning. The sexual\r\ninstinct is one of the most powerful organic needs. There is no law that\r\nlooks upon its satisfaction outside of marriage as punishable in itself;\r\nif the urning feels perversely, it is not his fault, but the fault of a\r\ncondition natural to him. His sexual instinct may be æsthetically very\r\nrepugnant, but, from his stand-point, it is natural. And, too, in the\r\nmajority of these unfortunates, the perverse sexual instinct is\r\nabnormally intense, and their consciousness recognizes it as nothing\r\nunnatural. Thus they fail to have moral and æsthetic ideas to assist\r\nthem in resisting the instinct. Innumerable normally constituted men are\r\nin a position to overcome the desire for satisfaction of their libido\r\nwithout suffering from it in health. Many neuropathic individuals,—and\r\nurnings are almost always neuropathic,—on the contrary, become nervously\r\nill when they do not satisfy the sexual desire, either as Nature prompts\r\nor in a way that is for them perverse.\r\n\r\nThe majority of urnings are in a painful situation. On the one hand,\r\nthere is an impulse toward persons of their own sex that is abnormally\r\nintense, the satisfaction of which has a good effect, and is natural to\r\nthem; on the other, is public sentiment which stigmatizes their acts,\r\nand the law which threatens them with punishment. Before them lies\r\nmental despair,—even insanity and suicide,—at the very least, nervous\r\ndisease; behind them, shame, loss of position, etc. It cannot be doubted\r\nthat, under these circumstances, states of necessity and compulsion may\r\nbe created by the unfortunate natural disposition and constitution.\r\nSociety and the law should understand these facts. The former must pity,\r\nand not despise, such unfortunates; the latter must cease to punish\r\nthem,—at least, while they remain within the limits which are set for\r\nthe activity of their sexual instinct.\r\n\r\n  As a confirmation of these opinions and demands concerning these\r\n  step-children of Nature, it is permissible to reproduce here the\r\n  memorial of an urning to the author. The writer of the following lines\r\n  is a man of high position in London:—\r\n\r\n  “You have no idea what a constant struggle we all—particularly those\r\n  of us that have the most mind and finest feelings—have to endure, and\r\n  how we suffer under the prevailing false ideas about us and our\r\n  so-called immorality.\r\n\r\n  “Your opinion that the phenomenon under consideration is primarily due\r\n  to a congenital ‘pathological’ disposition will, perhaps, make it\r\n  possible to overcome existing prejudices, and awaken pity for poor,\r\n  ‘abnormal’ men, instead of the present repugnance and contempt. Much\r\n  as I believe that the opinion expressed by you is exceedingly\r\n  beneficial to us, I am still compelled, in the interest of science, to\r\n  repudiate the word ‘pathological’; and you will permit me to express a\r\n  few thoughts with respect of it.\r\n\r\n  “Under all circumstances the phenomenon is anomalous; but the word\r\n  ‘pathological’ conveys another meaning, which I cannot think suits\r\n  this phenomenon; at least, as I have had occasion to observe it in\r\n  very many cases. I will allow, _a priori_, that, among urnings, a far\r\n  higher proportion of cases of insanity, of nervous exhaustion, etc.,\r\n  may be observed than in other normal men. Does this increased\r\n  nervousness necessarily depend upon the character of urningism, or is\r\n  it not, in the majority of cases, to be ascribed to the effect of the\r\n  laws and the prejudices of society, which prohibit the indulgence of\r\n  their sexual desires, depending on a congenital peculiarity, while\r\n  others are not thus restrained?\r\n\r\n  “The youthful urning, when he feels the first sexual promptings and\r\n  näively expresses them to his comrades, soon finds that he is not\r\n  understood; he shrinks into himself. If he tell his parents or teacher\r\n  what moves him, that which is as natural to him as swimming is to a\r\n  fish is described as wrong and sinful, and he is told it must be\r\n  fought and overcome at any price. Then an inner conflict begins, a\r\n  powerful repression of sexual inclinations; and the more the natural\r\n  satisfaction of desire is repressed, the more lively the fancy\r\n  becomes, and paints the very pictures that the wish is to banish. The\r\n  more energetic the character that carries on this inner conflict, the\r\n  more the whole nervous system must suffer. Such a powerful repression\r\n  of an instinct so deeply implanted in us, in my opinion, develops the\r\n  abnormal symptoms which are observed in many urnings; but this does\r\n  not necessarily follow from the urning’s disposition.\r\n\r\n  “Some continue the conflict for a longer or shorter time, and thus\r\n  injure themselves; others at last come to the knowledge that the\r\n  powerful instinct born in them cannot possibly be sinful, and,\r\n  therefore, they cease to try to do the impossible,—the repression of\r\n  the instinct. Then, however, begin constant suffering and excitement.\r\n  When a normal man seeks satisfaction of sexual inclination, he knows\r\n  how to find it easily; it is not so with the urning. He sees men that\r\n  attract him, but he dares not say—nay, not even betray by a look—what\r\n  his feelings are. He thinks that he alone of all the world has such\r\n  abnormal feelings. Naturally he seeks the society of young men; but he\r\n  does not venture to confide in them. Thus he comes to provide himself\r\n  with a satisfaction that he cannot otherwise obtain. Onanism is\r\n  practiced inordinately, and followed by all the evil results of that\r\n  vice. When, after a time, the nervous system has been injured, the\r\n  abnormality is again not the result of urningism, but it is produced\r\n  by the onanism to which the urning resorts, as a result of the public\r\n  sentiment that denies him opportunity to satisfy the sexual instinct\r\n  that is natural to him.\r\n\r\n  “Or, let us suppose the urning has had the rare fortune to soon find a\r\n  person like himself; or, that he has been introduced by an experienced\r\n  friend to the events of the world of urnings. Then he is spared much\r\n  of the inner conflict; but, at the same time, fearful cares and\r\n  anxieties follow his footsteps. Now he knows that he is not the only\r\n  one in the world that has such abnormal feelings; he opens his eyes\r\n  and wonders that he meets so many of his kind in all social circles\r\n  and in all callings; he also learns that, in the world of urnings, as\r\n  in the other, there is prostitution, and that men as well as women can\r\n  be bought. Thus there is no longer any want of opportunity for sexual\r\n  satisfaction. But here how differently the experience is gained from\r\n  that obtained in the normal manner of sexual indulgence!\r\n\r\n  “Let us consider the happiest case. After longing all one’s life, the\r\n  friend of like feeling is found. But he cannot be approached openly,\r\n  as a lover approaches the girl he loves. In constant fear, both must\r\n  conceal their relations; nay, even intimacy that might easily excite\r\n  suspicion—especially should they not be of like age, or should they\r\n  belong to different classes—must be kept from the world. Thus, even in\r\n  this relation, is forged a chain of anxiety and fear that the secret\r\n  will be betrayed or discovered, which leaves them no joy in the\r\n  indulgence. The slightest thing that would not affect others makes\r\n  them tremble with fear that suspicion might be excited and the secret\r\n  discovered, and destroy social position and business. Could this\r\n  constant anxiety and care be endured without leaving a trace, without\r\n  exerting an influence on the entire nervous system?\r\n\r\n  “Another less fortunate man does not find a friend of like feeling,\r\n  but falls into the hands of a handsome man, who sought him until the\r\n  secret was discovered. Now the most refined blackmail is extorted. The\r\n  unfortunate, persecuted man, brought to the alternative of paying or\r\n  of losing his social position, and bringing disgrace on himself and\r\n  his family, pays; and the more he gives, the more voracious the\r\n  vampire becomes; until at last there remains nothing but absolute\r\n  financial ruin or dishonor. Who can wonder that nerves are not equal\r\n  to such a terrible struggle!\r\n\r\n  “They give way; insanity comes on; and the miserable man at last finds\r\n  the rest in an asylum that he could not find in the world. Another, in\r\n  the same situation, driven to despair, finds relief in suicide. It\r\n  cannot be known how many of the suicides of young men are to be\r\n  attributed to this combination of circumstances.\r\n\r\n  “I do not think that I am in error when I declare that at least\r\n  one-half of the suicides of young men are due to such conditions. Even\r\n  in those cases where urnings are not persecuted by a heartless\r\n  villain, but where a happy relation between two men exists, discovery,\r\n  or even the fear of it, very often leads to suicide. How many\r\n  officers, how many soldiers, having such relations with their\r\n  subordinates or companions, in the moment when they have believed\r\n  themselves discovered, have sought to escape the threatened disgrace\r\n  by means of a bullet! And it is the same in all callings.\r\n\r\n  “Therefore, if it must be admitted that, among urnings, more mental\r\n  abnormalities and more insanity are actually observed than among other\r\n  men, yet this does not prove that the mental disturbance is a\r\n  necessary accompaniment of the urning’s condition, and that the latter\r\n  induces the former.\r\n\r\n  “According to my firm conviction, by far the greater number of cases\r\n  of mental disturbance or abnormal disposition observed in urnings are\r\n  not to be attributed to the sexual anomaly; but they are caused by the\r\n  existing notions concerning urnings, and the resulting laws, and\r\n  dominant public sentiment concerning the anomaly. Any one with an\r\n  adequate idea of the mental and moral suffering, of the anxiety and\r\n  care, that the urning must endure; of the constant hypocrisy and\r\n  secrecy he must practice, in order to conceal his inner instinct; of\r\n  the difficulties that meet him in satisfying his natural desire,—can\r\n  only be surprised that more insanity and nervous disturbance does not\r\n  occur in urnings. The greater part of these abnormal states would not\r\n  be developed, if the urning, like another, could find a simple and\r\n  easy way in which to satisfy his sexual desire,—if he were not forever\r\n  troubled by these anxieties!”\r\n\r\n_De lege lata_, as far as the urning is concerned, the paragraph with\r\nreference to pederasty must not be applied without the proof of actual\r\npederasty; and psychical and somatic abnormalities must be examined by\r\nexperts with respect of an estimate in the individual of the question of\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n_De lege ferenda_, the urnings wish a repeal of the paragraphs. The\r\njurist could not consent to this, if he were to remember that pederasty\r\nis much more frequently a disgusting vice than the result of physical\r\nand mental infirmity; and that, moreover, many urnings, though driven to\r\nsexual acts with their own sex, are yet in nowise compelled to indulge\r\nin pederasty,—a sexual act which, under all circumstances, must stand as\r\ncynical, disgusting, and, when passive, as certainly injurious. Whether\r\nfor reasons of expediency (difficulty of fixing the guilt, encouragement\r\nof blackmail, etc.), it would not be opportune to strike from the\r\nstatutes the legal punishment of the male-loving man, and to protect\r\nyouth by the use of the paragraphs concerning sexual abuses, is a future\r\nquestion for jurists.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said concerning congenital contrary sexuality and its\r\nrelation to the law is also applicable to the acquired abnormality. The\r\naccompanying neurosis or psychosis should have much diagnostic and\r\nforensic weight with reference to the question of guilt.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to describe acquired non-pathological pederasty,—one of\r\nthe saddest pages in the history of human delinquencies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CULTIVATED PEDERASTY.[143]\r\n\r\nThe motives that bring to pederasty a man originally normal sexually and\r\nof sound mind are various. It is used temporarily as a means of sexual\r\nsatisfaction _faute de mieux_,—as in infrequent cases of\r\nbestiality,—where abstinence from normal sexual indulgence is a\r\nnecessity.[144] It thus occurs on ship-board during long voyages, in\r\nprisons, in baths, etc. It is highly probable that, among men subjected\r\nto such conditions, there are single individuals of low morals and great\r\nsensuality, or actual urnings, who seduce the others. Lust, imitation,\r\nand desire further their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the sexual instinct is most markedly shown by the fact\r\nthat such circumstances are sufficient to overcome repugnance for the\r\nunnatural act.\r\n\r\nAnother category of pederasts is made up of old _roues_ that have become\r\nsupersatiated in normal sexual indulgence, and who find in pederasty a\r\nmeans of exciting sensual pleasure, the act being a new method of\r\nstimulation. Thus they temporarily renew their power, that has been\r\npsychically and physically reduced to so low a state. The new sexual\r\nsituation makes them, so to speak, relatively potent, and makes pleasure\r\npossible that is no longer possible in normal intercourse. In time power\r\nto indulge in pederasty is also lost. The individual may thus finally be\r\nreduced to passive pederasty as a stimulus to make possible temporary\r\nactive pederasty; just as, occasionally, flagellation or looking on at\r\nobscene acts (Maschka’s case of mutilation of animals) is resorted to\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe termination of sexual activity expresses itself in all kinds of\r\nabuse of children,—cunnilingus, fellare, and other enormities.\r\n\r\nThis kind of pederasts is the most dangerous, since they deal mostly\r\nwith boys, and ruin them in body and soul.\r\n\r\n  In reference to this, the experiences of Tarnowsky (_op. cit._, p. 53\r\n  _et seq._), gathered from the society of St. Petersburg, are terrible.\r\n  The places where pederasty is cultivated are Institutes. Old _roués_\r\n  and urnings play the _rôle_ of seducers. At first it is difficult for\r\n  the person to carry out the disgusting act. Fancy is made to assist by\r\n  calling up the image of a woman. Gradually, with practice, the\r\n  unnatural act becomes easy, and at last the individual, like one\r\n  injured by masturbation, becomes relatively impotent for women, and\r\n  lustful enough to find pleasure in the perverse act. Such individuals,\r\n  under certain circumstances, give themselves for money.\r\n\r\n  As Tardieu, Hofmann, Simon, and Taylor show, such individuals are not\r\n  infrequently found in large cities. From numerous statements made to\r\n  me by urnings, it is learned that actual prostitution and houses of\r\n  prostitution for male-loving men exist in large cities. The arts of\r\n  coquetry used by these male prostitutes are noteworthy,—ornament,\r\n  perfumes, feminine styles of dress, etc., to attract pederasts and\r\n  urnings. This imitation of feminine peculiarities is spontaneous and\r\n  unconscious in congenital cases, and in many acquired cases of\r\n  (abnormal) contrary sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nThe following lines are of interest to the psychologist, and offer the\r\nofficers of the law important facts concerning the social life and\r\npractice of pederasts:—\r\n\r\n  Coffignon, “La Corruption à Paris,” p. 327, divides active pederasts\r\n  into “_amateurs_,” “_entreteneurs_,” and “_souteneurs_.”\r\n\r\n  The “_amateurs_” (“_rivettes_”) are debauched persons, but also\r\n  frequently congenitally perverse sexually, of position and fortune,\r\n  who are forced to guard themselves against detection in the\r\n  gratification of their homo-sexual desires. For this purpose they\r\n  visit brothels, lodging-houses, or the private houses of female\r\n  prostitutes, who are usually on good terms with male prostitutes. Thus\r\n  they escape blackmail.\r\n\r\n  Some of these “_amateurs_” are cunning enough to indulge their vile\r\n  desires in public places. They thus run the risk of arrest, but, in a\r\n  large city, little risk of blackmail. Danger is said to add to their\r\n  secret pleasure.\r\n\r\n  The “_entreteneurs_” are old sinners who, even with the danger of\r\n  falling into the hands of blackmailers, cannot deny themselves the\r\n  pleasure of keeping a (male) mistress.\r\n\r\n  The “_souteneurs_” are pederasts that have been punished, who keep\r\n  their “_jesus_,” whom they send out to entice customers (“_faire\r\n  chanter les rivettes_”), and who then, at the right moment, if\r\n  possible, appear for the purpose of plucking the victim.\r\n\r\n  Not infrequently they live together in bands, the members, in\r\n  accordance with individual desire, living together as husbands and\r\n  wives. In such bands there are formal marriages, betrothals, banquets,\r\n  and introductions of brides and grooms into their apartments.\r\n\r\n  These “_souteneurs_” attach their “_jesus_” to themselves.\r\n\r\n  The passive pederasts are “_petits jesus_,” “_jesus_,” or “_aunts_.”\r\n\r\n  The “_petits jesus_” are lost, depraved children, whom accident places\r\n  in the hands of active pederasts, who seduce them, and reveal to them\r\n  the horrible means of earning a livelihood, either as “_entretenus_”\r\n  or as male street-walkers, with or without “_souteneurs_.”\r\n\r\n  The most suitable and promising “_petits jesus_” are given into the\r\n  hands of persons who instruct these children in the art of female\r\n  dress and manner. Gradually they then seek to emancipate themselves\r\n  from their teachers and masters, in order to become “_femmes\r\n  entretenues_”; and not infrequently by means of anonymous denunciation\r\n  of their “_souteneurs_” to the police.\r\n\r\n  It is the object of the “_souteneur_” and the “_petit jesus_” to make\r\n  the latter appear young, as long as possible, by means of all the arts\r\n  of the toilet.\r\n\r\n  The limit of age is about twenty-five years; then they all become\r\n  “_jesus_” and “_femmes entretenues_” and are then sustained by several\r\n  “_souteneurs_.” The “_jesus_” fall into three categories: “_filles\r\n  gallantes_,” _i.e._, those that have fallen again into the hands of a\r\n  “_souteneur_”; “_pierreuses_” (ordinary street-walkers, like their\r\n  female colleagues); and “_domestics_.”\r\n\r\n  The “_domestics_” hire out to active pederasts, either to gratify\r\n  their desires or to obtain “_petits jesus_” for them.\r\n\r\n  A sub-group of these “_domestics_” is formed by such of them as enter\r\n  the service of “_petits jesus_” as “_femmes de chambre_.” The\r\n  principal object of these “_domestics_” is to use their positions to\r\n  obtain compromising knowledge, with which they later practice\r\n  blackmail, and thus assure themselves ease in their old age.\r\n\r\n  The most horrible class of active pederasts is made up of the\r\n  “_aunts_,”—_i.e._, the “_souteneurs_” of (male) prostitutes,—who,\r\n  though normal sexually, are morally depraved, and practice pederasty\r\n  (passive) only for gain, or for the purpose of blackmail.\r\n\r\n  The wealthy “_amateurs_” have their reunions and places of meeting,\r\n  where the passive ones appear in female attire, and horrible orgies\r\n  take place. The waiters, musicians, etc., at such gatherings, are all\r\n  pederasts. The “_filles gallantes_” do not venture, except during the\r\n  carnival, to show themselves on the street in female dress; but they\r\n  know how to lend to their appearance something indicative of their\r\n  calling, by means of style of dress, etc. They entice by means of\r\n  gesture, peculiar movements of the hands, etc., and lead their victims\r\n  to hotels, baths, or brothels.\r\n\r\n  What the author says of blackmail is generally known. There are cases\r\n  where pederasts have allowed their entire fortune to be wrung from\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nThe following notice from a Berlin (National?) newspaper, of February,\r\n1884, which fell into my hands by accident, seems suited to show\r\nsomething of the life and customs of urnings:—\r\n\r\n  “_The Woman-Haters’ Ball._—Almost every social element of Berlin has\r\n  its social reunions,—the fat, the bald-headed, the young,—and why not\r\n  the woman-haters? This species of men, so interesting psychologically\r\n  and none too edifying, had a great ball to-day. ‘Grand Vienna\r\n  Mask-Ball,’—so ran the notice. The sale of tickets was very rigorous;\r\n  they wish to be very exclusive. Their rendezvous was a well-known\r\n  dance-hall. We enter the hall about midnight. The graceful dancing is\r\n  to the strains of a fine orchestra. Thick tobacco-smoke, veiling the\r\n  gas-lights, does not allow the details of the moving mass to become\r\n  obvious; only during the pause between the dances can we obtain a\r\n  closer view. The masks are by far in the majority; black dress-coats\r\n  and ball-gowns are seen only now and then.\r\n\r\n  “But what is that? The lady in rose-tarletan, that just now passed us,\r\n  has a lighted cigar in the corner of her mouth, and puffs like a\r\n  trooper; and she also wears a small, blonde beard, lightly painted\r\n  out. And yet she is talking with a very _décolleté_ ‘angel’ in\r\n  _tricots_, who stands there, with bare arms folded behind her,\r\n  likewise smoking. The two voices are masculine, and the conversation\r\n  is likewise very masculine; it is about the ‘d— tobacco, that permits\r\n  no air.’ Two men in female attire. A conventional clown stands there,\r\n  against a pillar, in soft conversation with a ballet-dancer, with his\r\n  arm around her faultless waist. She has a blonde ‘Titus-head,’\r\n  sharp-cut profile, and apparently a voluptuous form. The brilliant\r\n  ear-rings, the necklace with a medallion, the full, round shoulders\r\n  and arms, do not permit a doubt of her ‘genuineness,’ until, with a\r\n  sudden movement, she disengages herself from the embracing arm, and,\r\n  yawning, moves away, saying, in a deep bass, ‘Emile, you are too\r\n  tiresome to-day!’ The ballet-dancer is also a male!\r\n\r\n  “Suspicious now, we look about further. We almost suspect that here\r\n  the world is topsy-turvy; for here goes, or, rather, trips, a man—no,\r\n  no man at all, even though he wears a carefully trained moustache. The\r\n  well-curled hair; the powdered and painted face with the blackened\r\n  eyebrows; the golden ear-rings; the bouquet of flowers reaching from\r\n  the left shoulder to the breast, ornamenting the elegant black gown;\r\n  the golden bracelets on the wrists; the elegant fan in the\r\n  white-gloved hand,—all these things are anything but masculine. And\r\n  how he toys with the fan! How he dances and turns, and trips and\r\n  lisps! And yet kindly Nature made this doll a man. He is a salesman in\r\n  a great millinery store, and the ballet-dancer mentioned is his\r\n  ‘colleague.’\r\n\r\n  “At a little corner-table there seems to be a great social circle.\r\n  Several elderly gentlemen press around a group of _décolleté_ ladies,\r\n  who sit over a glass of wine and—in the spirit of fun—make jokes that\r\n  are none too delicate. Who are these three ladies? ‘Ladies!’ laughs my\r\n  knowing friend. ‘Well, the one on the right, with the brown hair and\r\n  the short, fancy dress, is called “Butterrieke,” and he is a\r\n  hair-dresser; the second one—the blonde in a singer’s costume, with\r\n  the necklace of pearls—is known here by the name of “Miss Ella of the\r\n  tight-rope,” and he is a ladies’ tailor; and the third,—that is the\r\n  widely-celebrated “Lottie.”\r\n\r\n  “But that person cannot possibly be a man? That waist, that bust,\r\n  those classic arms, the whole air and person are markedly feminine!\r\n\r\n  “I am told that ‘Lottie’ was once a book-keeper. To-day she, or,\r\n  rather, he, is exclusively ‘Lottie,’ and takes pleasure in deceiving\r\n  men about his sex as long as possible. ‘Lottie’ is singing a song that\r\n  would hardly do for a drawing-room, in a high voice, acquired by years\r\n  of practice, which many a soprano might envy. ‘Lottie’ has also\r\n  ‘worked’ as a female comedian. Now the quondam book-keeper has so\r\n  entered into the female _rôle_ that he appears on the street in female\r\n  attire almost exclusively, and, as the people with whom he lodges\r\n  state, uses an embroidered night-dress.\r\n\r\n  “On closer examination of the assembly, to my astonishment, I discover\r\n  acquaintances on all hands: my shoemaker, whom I should have taken for\r\n  anything but a woman-hater—he is a ‘troubadour,’ with sword and plume;\r\n  and his ‘Leonora,’ in the costume of a bride, is accustomed to place\r\n  my favorite brand of cigars before me in a certain cigar-store.\r\n  ‘Leonora,’ who, during an intermission, removes her gloves, I\r\n  recognize with certainty by her large, blue hands. Right! There is my\r\n  haberdasher, also; he moves about in a questionable costume as\r\n  Bacchus, and is the swain of a repugnantly bedecked Diana, who works\r\n  as a waiter in a beer-restaurant. The real ‘ladies’ of the ball cannot\r\n  be described here. They associate only with one another, and avoid the\r\n  woman-hating men; and the latter are exclusive, and amuse themselves,\r\n  absolutely ignoring the charms of the women.”\r\n\r\nThese facts deserve the careful attention of the police, who should be\r\nplaced in a position to cope with male prostitution, as they now do with\r\nthat of women.\r\n\r\nMale prostitution is certainly much more dangerous to society than that\r\nof females; it is the darkest stain on the history of humanity.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements of a high police official of Berlin, I learn that\r\nthe police of Berlin are conversant with the male _demi-monde_ of the\r\nGerman Capital, and do all they can to suppress blackmail among\r\npederasts,—a practice which often does not stop short of murder.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts justify the wish that the law-maker of the future\r\nmay, for reasons of utility, at least, abandon the prosecution of\r\npederasty.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this point, it is worthy of note that the French Code\r\ndoes not punish it so long as it does not become an offense to public\r\ndecency. Probably for politico-legal reasons, the new Italian Penal Code\r\npasses over the crime of unnatural abuse in silence, as do the statutes\r\nof Holland and, as far as I know, Belgium and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn how far such cultivated pederasts are to be regarded as mentally and\r\nmorally sound may remain an open question. The majority of them suffer\r\nwith genital neuroses. At least, in these cases, there are the stages of\r\ntransition to acquired pathological contrary sexual instinct. The\r\nresponsibility of these individuals, who are certainly much lower than\r\nthe women who prostitute themselves, in general cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe various categories of male-loving men, with respect of the manner of\r\nsexual indulgence, may be thus characterized in general:—\r\n\r\nThe congenital urning becomes a pederast only exceptionally, and\r\neventually resorts to it after having practiced and exhausted all the\r\npossible immoral acts with males. Passive pederasty is for him the\r\nideally and practically adequate form of the sexual act. He practices\r\nactive pederasty only to please another. The most important point here\r\nis the congenital and unchangeable perversion of the sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with the pederast by cultivation. He has once acted\r\nnormally sexually, or, at least, had normal inclinations, and\r\noccasionally has intercourse with the opposite sex. His sexual\r\nperversity is neither congenital nor unchangeable. He begins with\r\npederasty and ends in other perverse sexual acts, induced by weakness of\r\nthe centres for erection and ejaculation. At the height of his power,\r\nhis sexual desire is not for passive, but for active pederasty. He\r\nyields himself to passive pederasty only to please another; for money,\r\nin the _rôle_ of a male prostitute; or as a means, when virility is\r\ndeclining, to make active pederasty still occasionally possible.\r\n\r\nA horrible act, that must be alluded to, in conclusion, is pædicatio\r\nmulierum,[145] and even uxorum. Sensual individuals sometimes do it with\r\nhardened prostitutes, or even with their wives. Tardieu gives examples\r\nwhere men, usually practicing coitus, sometimes indulged in pederasty\r\nwith their wives. Occasionally fear of a repetition of pregnancy may\r\ninduce the man to perform, and the woman to tolerate, the act.\r\n\r\n  Case 192. _Imputation of pederasty that was not proved._ _Résumé_ from\r\n  the legal proceedings:—\r\n\r\n  On May 30, 1888, Dr. S., chemist, of H., in an anonymous letter, was\r\n  accused by his step-father of having immoral relations with G., aged\r\n  19, the son of a butcher. Dr. S. received the letter, and, astounded\r\n  by its contents, hastened to his lawyer, who promised to proceed\r\n  discreetly in the matter, and to ascertain from the authorities\r\n  whether he would be publicly prosecuted.\r\n\r\n  On the next morning, G., who lived in the house of Dr. S., was\r\n  arrested. At the time he was sick with gonorrhœa and orchitis. Dr. S.\r\n  tried to induce the authorities to release G., and advised caution,\r\n  but he was refused. In his statement to the judge, S. said that he\r\n  became acquainted with G. on the street, three years previously, and\r\n  then saw no more of him until the fall of 1887, when he met him in his\r\n  father’s shop. After November G. supplied Dr. S.’s kitchen with\r\n  meat,—coming in the evening to get the order, and bringing the meats\r\n  the next morning. Thus S. gradually became well acquainted with G.,\r\n  and came to have a very friendly feeling for him. When S. fell ill and\r\n  was, for the most part, confined to his bed until the middle of May,\r\n  1888, G. gave him so much attention that S. and his wife were much\r\n  attracted to him on account of his harmless, child-like, and happy\r\n  disposition. Dr. S. showed and explained to him his collection of\r\n  curiosities, and they spent the evenings pleasantly together, the wife\r\n  also being usually present; besides, S. and G. experimented in making\r\n  sausages, jelly, etc. In February, 1888, G. fell ill with gonorrhœa.\r\n  Dr. S., being his friend, and having studied medicine for several\r\n  terms, took care of G., procured medicine for him, etc. In May, G.\r\n  being still sick, and, for several reasons, inclined to leave home, S.\r\n  and his wife took him into their own home to care for him. S. denied\r\n  the truth of all the suspicions that had been raised by this relation,\r\n  and defended himself by pointing to his life of previous\r\n  respectability, his education, and to the fact that G., at the time,\r\n  was suffering with a disgusting, contagious disease, and that he\r\n  himself had a painful affection (nephritic calculus, with occasional\r\n  attacks of colic).\r\n\r\n  Opposed to this statement of Dr. S.’s must be mentioned the facts that\r\n  were brought out in court, and which led to conviction in the first\r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n  The relation of S. to G. had, by reason of its obviousness, given\r\n  cause for remark by private individuals, as well as by those in public\r\n  houses. G. spent almost all his evenings with S.’s family, and,\r\n  finally, came to be quite at home there. They took walks together.\r\n  Once, while out on such a walk, S. said to G. that he was a pretty\r\n  fellow, and that he (S.) was very fond of him. On the same occasion,\r\n  there was also talk of sexual matters, and also of pederasty. S. said\r\n  he touched on these subjects only to warn G. With reference to the\r\n  intercourse at home, it was proved that occasionally S., while sitting\r\n  on a sofa, embraced G., and kissed him. This happened in the presence\r\n  of the wife, as well as of the servant-girls. When G. was ill with\r\n  gonorrhœa, S. instructed him in the method of using a syringe, and, at\r\n  the time, took the penis in his hand. G. testified that S., in answer\r\n  to his question why he was so fond of him, said, “I don’t know,\r\n  myself.” When, one day, G. remained away, S., with tears in his eyes,\r\n  complained of it to him when he returned. S. also told him that his\r\n  marriage was unhappy, and, in tears, begged G. not to leave him; that\r\n  he must take the place of his wife.\r\n\r\n  From all this resulted the just accusation, that the relation between\r\n  the culprits had a sexual direction. The fact that all was open and\r\n  known to everybody, according to the complaint, did not speak for the\r\n  harmlessness of the relation, but more for the intensity of the\r\n  passion of S. The spotless life of the accused was allowed, as well as\r\n  his honesty and gentleness. The probability of an unhappy marriage,\r\n  and that S. was of a very sensual nature, was shown.\r\n\r\n  During the course of the trial, G. was repeatedly examined by the\r\n  medical experts. He is scarcely of medium size, pale, and of powerful\r\n  frame; penis and testicles are very perfectly developed (large).\r\n\r\n  In consonance with the accusation, it was found that the anus was\r\n  pathologically changed, in that there were no wrinkles in the skin\r\n  about it and the sphincter was relaxed; and it was presumed that these\r\n  changes pointed to the probability of passive pederasty.\r\n\r\n  The conviction was based on these facts. The judgment passed\r\n  recognized that the relation that existed between the culprits did not\r\n  necessarily point to unnatural abuses, any more than did the physical\r\n  conditions found on the person of G.\r\n\r\n  However, by reason of the combination of the two facts, the court was\r\n  convinced of the guilt of both culprits, and held it proved: “That the\r\n  abnormal condition of G.’s anus had been caused by the frequently\r\n  repeated introduction of the penis of S., and that G. voluntarily\r\n  permitted the performance of this immoral act on himself.”\r\n\r\n  Thus the conditions of § 175, R. St. G. B., seemed to be covered. In\r\n  passing sentence, there was consideration of S.’s education, which\r\n  made him appear to be G.’s seducer; in G.’s case, this fact and his\r\n  youth were given weight; and the previous respectability of both was\r\n  held in view. Thus Dr. S. was sentenced to imprisonment for eight\r\n  months, and G. for four months.\r\n\r\n  The culprits appealed to the Supreme Court at Leipzig, and prepared\r\n  themselves, in case the appeal should be denied, to collect evidence\r\n  sufficient to call for a new trial.\r\n\r\n  They subjected themselves to examination and observation by\r\n  distinguished experts. The latter declared that G.’s anus presented no\r\n  signs of indulgence in passive pederasty.\r\n\r\n  Since it seemed of importance to those interested to make clear the\r\n  psychological aspect of the case, which was not touched on at the\r\n  trial, the author was intrusted with the examination and observation\r\n  of Dr. S. and G.\r\n\r\n  _Results of the Personal Examination, from December 11 to 13, 1888, in\r\n  Graz._—Dr. S., aged 37; two years married, without children.\r\n  Ex-Director of the City Laboratory of H. He comes of a father who is\r\n  said to have been nervous, owing to great activity; who had an\r\n  apoplectic attack in his fifty-seventh year, and died, at the age of\r\n  sixty-seven, of another attack of apoplexy. His mother is living, and\r\n  is described as a strong person, who has been nervous for years. Her\r\n  mother reached quite an old age, and is said to have died of a\r\n  cerebellar tumor. A brother of the mother’s father is said to have\r\n  been a drinker. The paternal grandfather died early, of softening of\r\n  the brain.\r\n\r\n  Dr. S. has two brothers, who are in perfect health.\r\n\r\n  He states that he is of nervous temperament, and has been of strong\r\n  constitution. After articular rheumatism, which he had in his\r\n  fourteenth year, he suffered with great nervousness for some months.\r\n  Thereafter he often suffered with rheumatic pains, palpitation, and\r\n  shortness of breath. These symptoms gradually disappeared with\r\n  sea-bathing. Seven years ago he had gonorrhœa. This disease became\r\n  chronic, and for a long time caused bladder-difficulty.\r\n\r\n  In 1887 he had his first attack of renal colic, and he had such\r\n  attacks repeatedly during the winter of 1887 and 1888, until May 16,\r\n  1888, when quite a large renal calculus was passed. Since then his\r\n  condition had been quite satisfactory. While suffering with stone,\r\n  during coitus, at the moment of ejaculation, he felt severe pain in\r\n  the urethra, and the same pain on urinating.\r\n\r\n  With reference to his life, S. states that he attended the Gymnasium\r\n  until he was fourteen, but after that, owing to the results of his\r\n  severe illness, he studied privately. He then spent four years in a\r\n  drug-store, and then studied medicine for six semesters at the\r\n  University, serving, in the war of 1870, as a voluntary hospital\r\n  assistant. Since he had no certificate of graduation from the\r\n  Gymnasium, he gave up the study of medicine, and obtained the degree\r\n  of doctor of philosophy. Then he served in the Museum of Minerals in\r\n  K., and later as assistant in the Mineralogical Institute of H.\r\n  Thereafter he made special studies in the chemistry of food-stuffs,\r\n  and five years ago became Director of the City Laboratory.\r\n\r\n  He makes all these statements in a prompt, precise manner, and does\r\n  not think long about his answers; so that one is more and more led to\r\n  think that he is a man who loves and speaks the truth,—the more,\r\n  since, on the following day, his statements are identical. With\r\n  reference to his vita sexualis, Dr. S., in a modest, delicate, and\r\n  open way, states that, in his eleventh year, he began to have a\r\n  knowledge of the difference of the sexes, and for some time, until his\r\n  fourteenth year, was given to onanism. He first had coitus at\r\n  eighteen, and thereafter indulged moderately. His sensual desire had\r\n  never been very great, but, until lately, the sexual act had been\r\n  normal in every way, and accompanied by gratifying pleasurable feeling\r\n  and full virility. Since his marriage, two years ago, he had cohabited\r\n  with his wife exclusively. He had married his wife out of love, and\r\n  still loved her, having coitus with her at least several times a week.\r\n  The wife, who was also at hand, confirmed these statements.\r\n\r\n  All cross-questioning with reference to a perversion of sexual feeling\r\n  toward men Dr. S. answered repeatedly in the negative, to repeated\r\n  examination, and that without contradiction or any thought of the\r\n  answers. Even when, in order to trap him, he is told that the proof of\r\n  a perverse sexual instinct would be of avail in the trial, he sticks\r\n  to his statements. One gains the important impression that S. has not\r\n  the slightest knowledge of the facts of male-love. Thus it is learned\r\n  that his lascivious dreams have never been about men; that he is\r\n  interested only in female nudity; that he liked to dance with ladies,\r\n  etc. No traces of any kind of sexual inclination for his own sex can\r\n  be discovered in S. With reference to his relations with G., Dr. S.\r\n  expresses himself exactly as he did at his examination before the\r\n  court. In explanation of his partiality for G., he can only say that\r\n  he is nervous, and a man of feeling and great sensibility, and very\r\n  sensitive to friendliness. During his illness he had felt very\r\n  lonesome and depressed; his wife had frequently been with her parents;\r\n  and thus it had happened that he had become friendly with G., who was\r\n  so gentle and kind. He still had a weakness for him, and felt\r\n  remarkably quiet and contented while in his society.\r\n\r\n  He had had two such close friendships previously: when he was yet a\r\n  student, with a corps-brother, a Dr. A. whom he also embraced and\r\n  kissed; later, with a Baron M. When it happened that he could not see\r\n  him for a few days, he became depressed, and even cried.\r\n\r\n  He also had a similar feeling and attachment for animals. Thus he had\r\n  a poodle that died a short time ago, mourned like a member of the\r\n  family; and he had often kissed the animal. (On relating this, the\r\n  tears came to his eyes.) His brother confirmed these statements, with\r\n  the remark, with reference to his brother’s remarkable friendship for\r\n  A. and M., that in these instances there was not the slightest\r\n  suspicion of sexual coloring or relation. Too, the most careful and\r\n  detailed examination of Dr. S. gave not the slightest reason for such\r\n  a presumption.\r\n\r\n  He states that he never had the slightest sensual feeling for G., to\r\n  say nothing of erection or sensual desire. His partiality for G.,\r\n  which bordered on jealousy, S. explained as due merely to his\r\n  sentimental temperament and his inordinate friendship. G. was still as\r\n  dear to him as if he were his son.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that S. stated that when G. told him about his\r\n  love-adventures with girls, it had hurt him only because G. was in\r\n  danger of injuring himself and ruining his health by dissipation. He\r\n  had never felt hurt himself by this. If he knew a good girl for G. he\r\n  would be glad to rejoice with him, and do all he could to promote\r\n  their marriage.\r\n\r\n  S. states that it was first in the course of his legal examination\r\n  that he saw how he had been careless in his intercourse with G., by\r\n  causing gossip. His openness he explained as due to the innocence of\r\n  the friendship.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that S.’s wife never noticed anything suspicious\r\n  in the intercourse between her husband and G., though the most simple\r\n  wife would instinctively notice anything of that nature. Mrs. S. had\r\n  also made no opposition to receiving G. into the house. On this point\r\n  she remarked that the guest-chamber in which G. lay ill, was on the\r\n  second floor, while the living apartments were on the fourth; and,\r\n  further, that S. never associated alone with G. as long as he was in\r\n  the house. She states that she is convinced of her husband’s\r\n  innocence, and that she loves him as before.\r\n\r\n  Dr. S. states freely that formerly he had often kissed G., and talked\r\n  with him about sexual matters. G. was much given to women, and in\r\n  friendship he had often warned him about sexual dissipation,\r\n  particularly when G., as often happened, did not look well. He had\r\n  once said that G. was a handsome fellow; it was in a perfectly\r\n  harmless relation.\r\n\r\n  The kissing of G. had been due to inordinate friendship, when G. had\r\n  shown him some particular attention, or pleased him especially. In the\r\n  act he had never had any sexual feeling. Too, when he had now and then\r\n  dreamed of G., it was in a perfectly harmless way.\r\n\r\n  It appeared of great importance to the author to form also an opinion\r\n  of G.’s personality. On December 12th, the desired opportunity was\r\n  given, and G. was carefully examined.\r\n\r\n  G. is a young man, aged 20, of delicate build, whose development\r\n  corresponds with his years; and he appears to be neuropathic and\r\n  sensual. The genitals are normal and well developed. The author thinks\r\n  he may be permitted to pass over the condition of the anus, as he does\r\n  not feel called upon to pass judgment upon it. With prolonged\r\n  association with G., one gets the impression that he is a harmless,\r\n  kind, and artless man, who is light-minded, but not morally depraved.\r\n  Nothing in his dress or manner indicates perverse sexual feeling.\r\n  There cannot be the slightest suspicion that he is a male courtesan.\r\n\r\n  When G. is introduced _in medias res_, he states that S. and he,\r\n  feeling their innocence, had told the matter as it actually was, and\r\n  on this the whole trial had been based.\r\n\r\n  At first, S.’s friendship, and especially the kissing, had seemed\r\n  remarkable, even to him. Later he had convinced himself that it was\r\n  merely friendship, and had then thought no more about it.\r\n\r\n  G. had looked upon S. as a father-like friend; for he was so\r\n  unselfish, and loved him so.\r\n\r\n  The expression “handsome fellow” was made when G. had a love-affair,\r\n  and when S. expressed his fears about a happy future for G. At that\r\n  time S. had comforted him, and said that his (G.’s) appearance was\r\n  pleasing, and that he would make an eligible match.\r\n\r\n  Once S. had complained to him (G.) that his wife was inclined to\r\n  drink, and burst into tears. G. was touched by his friend’s\r\n  unhappiness. On this occasion S. had kissed him, and begged for his\r\n  friendship, and asked him to visit him frequently.\r\n\r\n  S. had never spontaneously directed the conversation to sexual\r\n  matters. G. once asked what pederasty was, of which he had heard much\r\n  while in England; and S. had explained it to him.\r\n\r\n  G. acknowledges that he is sensual. At the age of twelve he had been\r\n  made acquainted with sexual matters by school-mates. He had never\r\n  masturbated, had first had coitus at the age of eighteen, and had\r\n  since visited brothels frequently. He had never felt any inclination\r\n  for his own sex, and had never experienced any sexual excitement when\r\n  S. kissed him. He had always had pleasure in coitus normally\r\n  performed. His lascivious dreams had always been of women. With\r\n  indignation, and pointing to his descent from a healthy and\r\n  respectable family, he repels the insinuation of having been given to\r\n  passive pederasty. Until the gossip about them came to his ears, he\r\n  had been innocent and devoid of suspicion. The anal anomalies he tries\r\n  to explain in the same way that he did at the trial. Auto-masturbation\r\n  in ano he denies.\r\n\r\n  It should be noted that Mr. J. S. claims to be no less astonished by\r\n  the charge against his brother of male-love than those more closely\r\n  associated with him. Yet he could not understand what attached his\r\n  brother to G.; and all the explanations which S. made to him\r\n  concerning his relation to G. were vain.\r\n\r\n  The author took the trouble to observe Dr. S. and G., in a natural\r\n  way, while they were dining, in company with S.’s brother and Mrs. S.,\r\n  in Graz. This observation revealed not the slightest sign of improper\r\n  friendship.\r\n\r\n  The general impression which Dr. S. made on me was that of a nervous,\r\n  sanguine, somewhat overstrained individual, but, at the same time,\r\n  kind, open-hearted, and very emotional.\r\n\r\n  Dr. S. is physically strong, somewhat corpulent, with a symmetrical,\r\n  brachycephalic cranium. The genitals are well developed; the penis\r\n  somewhat bellied; the prepuce somewhat hypertrophied.\r\n\r\n  _Opinion._—Pederasty is, unfortunately, not infrequent among mankind\r\n  to-day; but still, occurring among the peoples of Europe, it is an\r\n  unusual, perverse, and even monstrous manner of sexual gratification.\r\n  It presumes a congenital or acquired perversion of the sexual\r\n  instinct, and, at the same time, defect of moral sense that is either\r\n  original or acquired, as a result of pathological influences.\r\n\r\n  Medico-legal science is thoroughly conversant with the physical and\r\n  psychical conditions from which this aberration of the sexual instinct\r\n  arises; and in the concrete and doubtful case it seems requisite to\r\n  ascertain whether these empirical, subjective conditions necessary for\r\n  pederasty are present. Too, it is essential to distinguish between\r\n  active and passive pederasty.\r\n\r\n  Active pederasty occurs:—\r\n\r\n  I. As a _non-pathological_ phenomenon:—\r\n\r\n  1. As a means of sexual gratification, in case of great sexual desire,\r\n  with enforced abstinence from natural sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n  2. In old debauchees, who have become satiated with normal sexual\r\n  intercourse, and more or less impotent, and also morally depraved; and\r\n  who resort to pederasty, in order to excite their lust with this new\r\n  stimulus, and aid their virility, that has sunk so low psychically and\r\n  physically.\r\n\r\n  3. Traditionally, among certain barbarous races that are devoid of\r\n  morality.\r\n\r\n  II. As a _pathological_ phenomenon:—\r\n\r\n  1. Upon the basis of congenital contrary sexual instinct, with\r\n  repugnance for sexual intercourse with women, or even absolute\r\n  incapability of it. But, as even Casper knew, pederasty, under such\r\n  conditions, is very infrequent. The so-called urning satisfies himself\r\n  with a man by means of passive or mutual onanism, or by means of\r\n  coitus-like acts (_e.g._, coitus inter femora); and he resorts to\r\n  pederasty only very exceptionally, as a result of intense sexual\r\n  desire, or with a low or lowered moral sense, out of desire to please\r\n  another.\r\n\r\n  2. On the basis of acquired contrary sexual instinct:—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) As a result of long years of onanism, which finally causes\r\n  impotence for women with continuance of intense sexual desire.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) As a result of severe mental disease (senile dementia,\r\n  brain-softening of the insane, etc.), in which, as experience teaches,\r\n  an inversion of the sexual instinct may take place.\r\n\r\n  Passive pederasty occurs:—\r\n\r\n  I. As a _non-pathological_ phenomenon:—\r\n\r\n  1. In individuals of the lowest class, who, having had the misfortune\r\n  to be seduced in boyhood by debauchees, endured pain and disgust for\r\n  the sake of money, and became depraved morally, so that, in more\r\n  mature years, they have fallen so low that they take pleasure in being\r\n  male prostitutes.\r\n\r\n  2. Under circumstances analogous to those of I, 1,—as a remuneration\r\n  to another for having allowed active pederasty.\r\n\r\n  II. As a _pathological_ phenomenon:—\r\n\r\n  1. In individuals affected with contrary sexual instinct, with\r\n  endurance of pain and disgust, as a return to men for the bestowal of\r\n  sexual favors.\r\n\r\n  2. In urnings who feel toward men like women, out of desire and lust.\r\n  In such female-men there is horror feminæ and absolute incapability\r\n  for sexual intercourse with women. Character and inclinations are\r\n  feminine.\r\n\r\n  The empirical facts that have been gathered by legal medicine and\r\n  psychiatry are all included in this classification. Before the court\r\n  of medical science, it would be necessary to prove that a man belonged\r\n  to one of the above categories in order to carry the conviction that\r\n  he was a pederast.\r\n\r\n  In the life and character of Dr. S., one searches in vain for signs\r\n  which place him in one of the categories of active pederasts which\r\n  science has established. He is neither one forced to sexual\r\n  abstinence, nor one made impotent for women by debauchery; neither is\r\n  he congenitally male-loving, nor alienated from women by masturbation,\r\n  and attracted to men through continuance of sexual desire; and,\r\n  finally, he is not sexually perverse as a result of severe mental\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n  In fact, the general conditions necessary for the occurrence of\r\n  pederasty are wanting in him,—moral imbecility or moral depravity, on\r\n  the one hand, and inordinate sexual desire, on the other.\r\n\r\n  It is likewise impossible to classify the accomplice, G., in any of\r\n  the empirical categories of passive pederasty; for he possesses\r\n  neither the peculiarities of the male prostitute nor the clinical\r\n  marks of effemination; and he has not the anthropological and clinical\r\n  stigmata of the female-man. He is, in fact, the very opposite of all\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  In order to make a pederastic relation between the two plausible\r\n  medico-scientifically, it would be requisite for Dr. S. to present the\r\n  antecedents and marks of the active pederasts of I, 2, and G., those\r\n  of the passive pederasts of II, 1 or 2.\r\n\r\n  The assumption lying at the basis of the verdict is, from a\r\n  psychological stand-point, legally untenable.\r\n\r\n  With the same right, every man might be considered a pederast. It\r\n  remains to consider whether the explanations given by Dr. S. and G. of\r\n  their remarkable friendship are psychologically valid.\r\n\r\n  Psychologically it is not without parallel that so sentimental and\r\n  eccentric a man as S.—without any sexual excitement whatever—should\r\n  entertain a transcendental friendship. It suffices to recall the\r\n  friendship of school-girls, the self-sacrificing friendship of\r\n  sentimental young persons in general, and the partiality which this\r\n  sensitive man sometimes showed even for domestic animals,—where no one\r\n  would think of sodomy. With S.’s mental character, extraordinary\r\n  friendship for the youth G. may be easily comprehended. The openness\r\n  of this friendship permits the conclusion that it was innocent, much\r\n  rather than that it depended upon sensual passion.\r\n\r\n  The defendants succeeded in obtaining a new trial. The new trial took\r\n  place on March 7, 1890. There was much evidence presented in favor of\r\n  the accused.\r\n\r\n  The previous moral life of S. was generally acknowledged. The Sister\r\n  of Charity who cared for G. in S.’s house, never noticed anything\r\n  suspicious in the intercourse between S. and G. S.’s former friends\r\n  testified to his morality, his deep friendship, and his habit of\r\n  kissing them on meeting or leaving them. The anal abnormalities\r\n  previously found on G. were no longer present. Experts called by the\r\n  court allowed the possibility that they had been due simply to digital\r\n  manipulations; their diagnostic value in any case was contested by the\r\n  experts called by the defense.\r\n\r\n  The court recognized that the imputed crime had not been proved, and\r\n  exonerated the defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LESBIAN LOVE.[146]\r\n\r\nWhere the sexual intercourse is between adults, its legal importance is\r\nvery slight; it could come into consideration only in Austria. In\r\nconnection with urningism, this phenomenon is of anthropological and\r\nclinical value. The relation is the same, _mutatis mutandis_, as between\r\nmen. Lesbian love does not seem to approach urningism in frequency. The\r\nmajority of female urnings do not act in obedience to an innate impulse,\r\nbut they are developed under conditions analogous to those which produce\r\nthe urning by cultivation.\r\n\r\nThese “forbidden friendships” flourish especially in penal institutions\r\nfor females.\r\n\r\n  Kraussold (_op. cit._) reports: “The female prisoners often have such\r\n  friendships, which, when possible, extend to mutual manustupration.\r\n\r\n  “But temporary manual gratification is not the only purpose of such\r\n  friendships. They are made to be enduring,—entered into\r\n  systematically, so to speak,—and intense jealousy and a passion for\r\n  love are developed which could scarcely be surpassed between persons\r\n  of opposite sex. When the friend of one prisoner is merely smiled at\r\n  by another, there are often the most violent scenes of jealousy, and\r\n  even beatings.\r\n\r\n  “When the violent prisoner has been put in irons, in accordance with\r\n  the prison-regulations, she says ‘she has had a child by her friend.’”\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Parent-Duchatelet (“De la prostitution,” 1857, vol.\r\ni, p. 159) for interesting communications concerning Lesbian love.\r\n\r\n  According to this experienced author, repugnance for the most\r\n  disgusting and perverse acts (coitus in axilla, inter mammæ, etc.)\r\n  which men perform on prostitutes is not infrequently responsible for\r\n  driving these unfortunate creatures to Lesbian love. From his\r\n  statements it is seen that it is essentially prostitutes of great\r\n  sensuality who, unsatisfied with intercourse with impotent or perverse\r\n  men, and impelled by their disgusting practices, come to indulge in\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  Besides these, there are prostitutes who let themselves be known as\r\n  given to tribadism; persons who have been in prisons for years, and in\r\n  these hot-beds of Lesbian love, ex abstinentia, acquired this vice.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to know that prostitutes hate those who practice\r\n  tribadism,—just as men abhor pederasts; but female prisoners do not\r\n  regard the vice as indecent.\r\n\r\n  Parent mentions the case of a prostitute who, while intoxicated, tried\r\n  to force another to Lesbian love. The latter became so enraged that\r\n  she denounced the indecent woman to the police. Taxil (_op. cit._ p.\r\n  166, 170) reports similar instances.\r\n\r\n  Mantegazza (“Anthropol. culturhistorische Studien,” p. 97) also finds\r\n  that sexual intercourse between women has especially the significance\r\n  of a vice which arises on the basis of unsatisfied hyperæsthesia\r\n  sexualis.\r\n\r\n  In many cases of this kind, however, aside from congenital contrary\r\n  sexual instinct, one gains the impression that, just as in men (_vide\r\n  supra_), the cultivated vice gradually leads to acquired contrary\r\n  sexual instinct, with repugnance for sexual intercourse with the\r\n  opposite sex.\r\n\r\n  At least Parent’s cases were probably of this nature. The\r\n  correspondence with the lover was quite as sentimental and exaggerated\r\n  in tone as it is between lovers of the opposite sex; unfaithfulness\r\n  and separation broke the heart of the one abandoned; jealousy was\r\n  unbridled, and led to bloody revenge. The following cases of Lesbian\r\n  love, by Mantegazza, are certainly pathological, and possibly examples\r\n  of congenital contrary sexual instinct:—\r\n\r\n  1. On July 5, 1777, a woman was brought before a court in London, who,\r\n  dressed as a man, had been married to three different women. She was\r\n  recognized as a woman, and sentenced to imprisonment for six months.\r\n\r\n  2. In 1773, another woman, dressed as a man, courted a girl, and asked\r\n  for her hand; but the trick did not succeed.\r\n\r\n  3. Two women lived together as man and wife for thirty years. On her\r\n  death-bed the “husband” confessed her secret to those about her.\r\n\r\n  Coffignon (_op. cit._, p. 301) makes later statements worthy of\r\n  notice.\r\n\r\n  He reports that this vice is, of late, quite the fashion,—partly owing\r\n  to novels on the subject, and partly as a result of excessive work on\r\n  sewing-machines, the sleeping of female servants in the same bed,\r\n  seduction in schools by depraved pupils, or seduction of daughters by\r\n  perverse servants.\r\n\r\n  The author declares that this vice (“saphism”) is met more frequently\r\n  among ladies of the aristocracy and prostitutes.\r\n\r\n  He does not differentiate physiological and pathological cases, nor,\r\n  among the latter, the acquired and congenital cases. The details of a\r\n  few cases, which are certainly pathological, correspond exactly with\r\n  the facts that are known about men of contrary sexuality.\r\n\r\n  The saphists have their places of meeting, recognize each other by\r\n  peculiar glances, carriage, etc. Saphistic pairs like to dress and\r\n  ornament themselves alike, etc. They are then called “_petites sœurs_”\r\n  (little sisters).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          7. NECROPHILIA.[147]\r\n\r\n                      (Austrian Statutes, § 306.)\r\n\r\nThis horrible kind of sexual indulgence is so monstrous that the\r\npresumption of a psychopathic state is, under all circumstances,\r\njustified; and Maschka’s recommendation, that the mental condition of\r\nthe perpetrator should always be investigated, is well founded. In any\r\ncase, an abnormal and decidedly perverse sensuality is required to\r\novercome the natural repugnance which man has for a corpse, and permit a\r\nfeeling of pleasure to be experienced in sexual congress with a cadaver.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the majority of the cases reported, the mental\r\ncondition was not examined; so that the question whether necrophilia is\r\ncompatible with mental soundness must remain open. But any one having\r\nknowledge of the horrible aberrations of the sexual instinct would not\r\nventure, without further consideration, to answer the question in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               8. INCEST.\r\n\r\n (Austrian Statutes, § 132; Abridgment, § 189; German Statutes, § 174.)\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the moral purity of family life is a product of\r\ncivilization;[148] and feelings of intense displeasure arise in an\r\nethically intact man at thought of lustful feeling toward a member of\r\nthe same family. Only great sensuality and defective ideas of laws and\r\nmorals can lead to incest.\r\n\r\nBoth conditions may, in tainted families, be operative. Drinking and a\r\nstate of intoxication in men; weak-mindedness which does not allow the\r\ndevelopment of the feeling of shame, and which, under certain\r\ncircumstances, is associated with eroticism in females,—these facilitate\r\nthe occurrence of incestuous acts. External conditions which facilitate\r\ntheir occurrence are due to defective separation of the sexes among the\r\nlower classes.\r\n\r\nAs a decidedly pathological phenomenon, the author has found incest in\r\nstates of congenital and acquired mental weakness, and infrequently in\r\ncases of epilepsy and paranoia.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases, probably a majority, it is not possible, however,\r\nto find a pathological basis for the act which so deeply wounds not only\r\nthe tie of blood, but also the feeling of a civilized people. But in\r\nmany of the cases reported in literature, to the honor of humanity, the\r\npresumption of a psychopathic basis is possible.\r\n\r\n  In the Feldtmann case (Marc-Ideler, vol. i, p. 18), where a father\r\n  constantly made immoral attacks on his adult daughter, and finally\r\n  killed her, the unnatural father was weak-minded and, besides,\r\n  probably subject to periodical mental disease. In another case of\r\n  incest between father and daughter (_loc. cit._, p. 247), the latter,\r\n  at least, was weak-minded. Lombroso (_Archiv. di Psichiatria_, viii,\r\n  p. 519) reports the case of a peasant, aged 42, who practiced incest\r\n  with his daughters, aged, respectively, 22, 19, and 11; he even forced\r\n  the youngest to prostitute herself, and then visited her in a brothel.\r\n  The medico-legal examination showed predisposition, intellectual and\r\n  moral imbecility, and alcoholism.\r\n\r\n  There was no mental examination in the case reported by Schürmeyer\r\n  (_Deutsche Zeitschr. für Staatsarzneikunde_, xxii, H. 1), in which a\r\n  mother laid her son of five and a half years on herself, and practiced\r\n  abuse with him; and in that given by Lafarque (_Journ. Méd. de\r\n  Bordeaux_, 1874), where a girl, aged 17, laid her brother, aged 13,\r\n  upon herself, brought about membrorum conjunctionem, and performed\r\n  masturbation on him.\r\n\r\n  The following cases are those of tainted individuals: Magnan (_Ann.\r\n  méd.-psych._, 1885) mentions an unmarried woman, aged 29, who, though\r\n  indifferent toward other children or even men, suffered frightfully in\r\n  the presence of her nephew, and could scarcely control her impulse to\r\n  cohabit with him. This sexual peculiarity continued only as long as\r\n  the nephew was quite young.\r\n\r\n  Legrand (_Ann. méd.-psych._, May, 1876) mentions a girl, aged 15, who\r\n  seduced her brother into all manner of sexual excesses on her person;\r\n  and when, after two years of this incestuous practice, her brother\r\n  died, she attempted to murder a relative. In the same article there is\r\n  the case of a married woman, aged 36, who hung her open breast out of\r\n  a window, and indulged in abuse with her brother, aged 18; and also\r\n  the case of a mother, aged 39, who practiced incest with her son, with\r\n  whom she was madly in love, became pregnant by him, and induced\r\n  abortion.\r\n\r\nThrough Casper we know that depraved mothers in large cities sometimes\r\ntreat their little daughters in a most horrible fashion, in order to\r\nprepare them for the sexual use of debauchees. This crime belongs\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n     9. IMMORAL ACTS WITH PERSONS IN THE CARE OF OTHERS; SEDUCTION\r\n                              (AUSTRIAN).\r\n\r\n (Austrian Statutes, § 131; Abridgment, § 188; German Statutes, § 173).\r\n\r\nAllied to incest, but still less repugnant to moral sensibility, are\r\nthose cases in which persons seduce those entrusted to them for care or\r\neducation, and who are more or less dependent upon them, to commit or\r\nsuffer vicious practices. Such acts, which especially deserve legal\r\npunishment, seem only exceptionally to have psychopathic significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Abuse,

1:\r\n\r\n  “Meanwhile, until Philosophy shall at last unite and maintain the\r\n  world, Hunger and Love impel it onward.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Hartmann’s philosophical view of love, in the “Philosophy of the\r\n  Unconscious,” p. 583, Berlin, 1869, is the following: “Love causes\r\n  more pain than pleasure. Pleasure is illusory. Reason would cause love\r\n  to be avoided if it were not for the fatal sexual instinct; therefore,\r\n  it would be best for a man to have himself castrated.” The same\r\n  opinion, minus the consequence, is also expressed by Schopenhauer\r\n  (“Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,” 3. Aufl., Bd. ii, p. 586 u.\r\n  ff.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  “No physical or moral misery, no suffering, however corrupt it may be,\r\n  should frighten him who has devoted himself to a knowledge of man and\r\n  the sacred ministry of medicine; in that he is obliged to see all\r\n  things, let him be permitted to say all things.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The Latin is left untranslated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The works of Moll and von Schrenck-Notzing have since appeared.—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Die Suggestions-Therapie, etc., F.

Westermarck, “History of Human Marriage.” McMillan & Co., 1891.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  This generally entertained idea, also held by many historians,\r\n  requires some limitation, in that the symbolic and sacramental\r\n  character of marriage was first made clear and unequivocal by the\r\n  Council of Trent, even though there was ever in the spirit of\r\n  Christianity that which would free woman and raise her from the\r\n  inferior position occupied by her in the ancient world and the Old\r\n  Testament.\r\n\r\n  That this took place so late may well be due in part to the traditions\r\n  of Genesis of the secondary creation of woman from the rib of man, and\r\n  of her part in the Fall, and the consequent curse: “Thy will shall be\r\n  to thy husband.” Since the Fall, for which the Old Testament made\r\n  woman responsible, became the corner-stone of the fabric of\r\n  churchteachings, the wife’s social position could but remain inferior\r\n  until the spirit of Christianity had gained a victory over tradition\r\n  and scholasticism.\r\n\r\n  It is remarkable that, with the exception of the interdiction of\r\n  putting away a wife (Matt. xix, 9), the gospels contain nothing\r\n  favoring woman. Gentleness toward the adulteress and the repentant\r\n  Magdalene does not affect the position of the wife in itself. The\r\n  Epistles of Paul specifically declare that the position of woman shall\r\n  not be altered (II Corinth. xi, 3–12; Ephes. v, 22: “Wives, submit\r\n  yourselves unto your husbands;” and 33, “And the wife _see_ that she\r\n  reverence her husband”).\r\n\r\n  Passages in Tertullian show how the Fathers of the Church were\r\n  prejudiced against woman by Eve’s guilt: “Woman, thou shouldst forever\r\n  go in sorrow and rags, thy eyes filled with tears! Thou hast brought\r\n  man to the ground!” St. Hieronymus has nothing good to say of woman.\r\n  He says, “Woman is a door for the devil, a way to evil, the sting of\r\n  the scorpion.” (“De cultu feminarum,” i, 1.)\r\n\r\n  Canonical Law declares: “Only man was created in the image of God, not\r\n  woman; therefore, woman should serve him and be his maid!”\r\n\r\n  The Provincial Council of Macon, in the sixth century, earnestly\r\n  debated the question whether woman had a soul.\r\n\r\n  The effect of these ideas in the Church on the peoples embracing\r\n  Christianity was direct. Among the Germans, after the acceptance of\r\n  the new faith, for the foregoing reason, the weregild for a wife—the\r\n  simple expression of her value—decreased (J. Falke, “Die ritterliche\r\n  Gesellschaft,” p. 49. Berlin, 1862). Concerning the value of each sex\r\n  among the Jews, _vide_ Leviticus, xxvii, 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, polygamy, which is expressly recognized in the Old Testament\r\n  (Deut. xxi, 15), is nowhere explicitly interdicted in the New\r\n  Testament. Christian princes (_e.g._, the Marovingian kings, Clotar I,\r\n  Childebert I, Pepin I, and many of the royal Franks) lived in\r\n  polygamy; and at that time the Church made no opposition to it\r\n  (Weinhold, “Die deutschen Frauen im Mittelalter,” ii, p. 15).

Friedreich, “gerichtl. Psychologie,” p. 389, who has collected\r\n  numerous examples. Thus the nun Blanbekin was always troubled with the\r\n  thought about what had become of the part lost at the circumcision of\r\n  Christ. Veronica Juliani, canonized by Pope Pius II, in memory of the\r\n  divine lion, took an actual lion in her bed and kissed it, and let it\r\n  suck from her breast; and even secreted a few drops of milk for it.\r\n  St. Catherine, of Genoa, often burned with such inward fire that, in\r\n  order to cool herself, she would lie down on the ground and cry “Love,\r\n  love, I can endure it no longer!” At the same time she felt a peculiar\r\n  inclination for her confessor. One day she lifted his hand to her nose\r\n  and smelled an odor which penetrated to her heart, “a heavenly\r\n  perfume, so delightful that it would wake the dead.” St. Armelle and\r\n  St. Elizabeth were troubled with a similar longing for the child\r\n  Jesus. The temptations of St. Anthony, of Padua, are well known. An\r\n  old prayer is significant: “O, that I had found thee, Holy Emanuel; O,\r\n  that I had thee in my bed to bring delight to body and soul. Come and\r\n  be mine, and my heart shall be thy resting-place.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Comp. Friedreich, “Diagnostik der psych. Krankheiten,” p. 347 _u.\r\n  ff._; Neumann, “Lehrb. d. Psychiatrie,” p. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  The relation of this trio finds its expression not only in the events\r\n  of real life, as above indicated, but also in romance, and even in the\r\n  sculpture of degenerate eras. As an example we may point to the group\r\n  of St. Theresa, by Bernini, who “sinks in an hysterical faint on a\r\n  marble cloud, with an amorous angel plunging the arrow (of divine\r\n  love) into her heart” (Lübke).\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  A Russian religious sect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Westermarck (_op. cit._, p. 211), after a careful review of the\r\n  evidence, says: “These facts appear to prove that the feeling of\r\n  shame, far from being the original cause of man’s covering his body,\r\n  is, on the contrary, a result of this custom; and that the covering,\r\n  if not used as a protection from climate, owes its origin, at least in\r\n  a great many cases, to the desire of men and women to make themselves\r\n  attractive.”—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  This is not literally the case. “It is expressly stated, of the women\r\n  of several savage peoples, that they are less desirous of\r\n  self-decoration than the men.”—Westermarck, _op. cit._, p. 184. And\r\n  the same writer (p. 182) says that “it is a common notion that women\r\n  are by nature vainer and more addicted to dressing and decorating\r\n  themselves than men. This certainly does not hold good for savage and\r\n  barbarous peoples in general.”—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Comp. Max Müller, who derives the word fetich etymologically from\r\n  _factitious_ (artificial, an insignificant thing).\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Deutsches Montagsblatt, Berlin, August 20, 1888.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Magnan’s “spinal cérébral postérieur,” who finds pleasure in every\r\n  woman, and on whom every woman looks with favor, has only desire to\r\n  satisfy his lust. Purchased or forced love is not real love\r\n  (Mantegazza). The one who originated the saying, “Sublata lucerna\r\n  nullum discrimen inter feminas,” must have been a cynic indeed. Power\r\n  in a man to perform love’s act is no proof that this makes possible\r\n  the greatest pleasure of love. There are, indeed, urnings who are\r\n  potent for women,—men who do not love their wives, but who are still\r\n  able to perform the marital “duty.” In most cases of this kind,\r\n  indeed, there is no lustful pleasure; it is essentially a kind of\r\n  onanistic act, for the most part made possible by means of help of\r\n  imagination that calls up another beloved person. By this deception\r\n  sensual pleasure can be induced, but this rudimentary psychical\r\n  satisfaction is the result of a mental trick, just as in solitary\r\n  onanism, where fancy has to assist in order to induce sensual\r\n  pleasure. As a rule, the degree of orgasm necessary as a means to the\r\n  attainment of lustful pleasure seems attainable only when the\r\n  imagination intervenes. Where mental impediments exist (indifference,\r\n  repugnance, disgust, fear of infection or pregnancy, etc.), sensual\r\n  pleasure seems usually wanting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  “The important part played by the hair of the head as a stimulant of\r\n  sexual passion appears in a curious way from Mr. Sibree’s account of\r\n  King Radàma’s attempt to introduce European customs among the Hovas\r\n  of Madagascar. As soon as he had adopted the military tactics of the\r\n  English, he ordered that all his officers and soldiers should have\r\n  their hair cut, but this command produced so great a disturbance\r\n  among the women of the capital that they assembled in great numbers\r\n  to protest against the king’s order, and could not be quieted until\r\n  they were surrounded by troops, and their leaders cruelly\r\n  speared.”—Westermarck, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n  Here male hair was a physiological fetich of females. It represents a\r\n  relation of the sexes that civilization has gradually reversed. While\r\n  in civilized society woman exercises her ingenuity to increase her\r\n  attractiveness, among savages it is the men who are anxious to\r\n  increase their physical charms. This reversal of the primitive\r\n  relation is a very interesting fact, and is probably to be explained\r\n  by the transference of the “liberty of choice” from woman to man which\r\n  civilization has gradually induced. Westermarck (_op. cit._, p. 185)\r\n  says: “It should be noted that it is, as a rule, the man only that\r\n  runs the risk of being obliged to lead a single life. Hence it is\r\n  obvious that, to the best of his ability, he must endeavor to be taken\r\n  into favor by making himself as attractive as possible. In civilized\r\n  Europe, on the other hand, the opposite occurs. Here it is the woman\r\n  that has the greatest difficulty in getting married, and she is also\r\n  the vainer of the two.”—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  The olfactory centre is presumed by Ferrier (“Functions of the Brain”)\r\n  to be in the region of the _gyrus uncinatus_. Zuckerkandl (“Ueber das\r\n  Riechcentrum,” 1887), from researches in comparative anatomy,\r\n  concludes that the olfactory centre has its seat in Ammon’s horn.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Comp. Laycock, who (“Nervous Diseases of Women,” 1840) found that in\r\n  women the love for musk and similar perfumes was related to sexual\r\n  excitement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Also in the insanity of gestation.—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  The following case, reported by Binet, seems to be in opposition to\r\n  this idea. Unfortunately nothing is said concerning the mental\r\n  characteristics of the person. In any event, it is certainly\r\n  confirmatory of the relations existing between the olfactory and\r\n  sexual senses:—\r\n\r\n  D., a medical student, was seated on a bench in a public park, reading\r\n  a book (on pathology). Suddenly a violent erection disturbed him. He\r\n  looked up and noticed that a lady, redolent with perfume, had taken a\r\n  seat upon the other end of the bench. D. could attribute the erection\r\n  to nothing but the unconscious olfactory impression made upon him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Meibomius, “De flagiorum usu in re medica,” London, 1765; Boileau,\r\n  “The History of the Flagellants,” London, 1783.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Comp.

It is possible that tendencies to such outbreaks of sadism are\r\n  atavistic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  In the Jahrbücher für Psychologie, ii, p. 128, Schäfer (Jena) refers\r\n  to the reports of two cases by A. Payer. In the first case states of\r\n  great sexual excitement were induced by the sight of battles or of\r\n  paintings of them; in the second, by cruel torturing of small animals\r\n  (_vide_ Case 24). It is added: “The pleasure of battle and murder is\r\n  so predominantly an attribute of the male sex throughout the animal\r\n  kingdom, that there can be no question about the close relation\r\n  existing between this side of the masculine character and male\r\n  sexuality. I believe, too, that by unprejudiced observation I can show\r\n  that, in men who are absolutely normal mentally and physically, the\r\n  first indefinite and incomprehensible precursors of sexual excitement\r\n  may be induced by reading exciting scenes of the chase and\r\n  war,—_i.e._, they give rise to unconscious longings for a kind of\r\n  satisfaction in warlike games (wrestling), in which, also, the\r\n  fundamental sexual impulse to the most perfect and intense contact\r\n  with a companion is expressed, with the more or less clearly defined\r\n  secondary thought of conquest.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  It sometimes happens that an accidental sight of blood, etc., is what\r\n  first excites the preformed psychical mechanism of the sadistic\r\n  individual, and awakens the instinct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Comp.

Then he wrote obscene\r\n  novels filled with lust, cruelty, and the most obscene scenes. When\r\n  Bonaparte became Consul, Sade made him a present of his novels\r\n  magnificently bound. The Consul had the works destroyed, and the\r\n  author committed to Charenton again, where he died, at the age of\r\n  sixty-four.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Comp.

Among\r\n  the Greeks it has its origin in the myth of the _lamiæ_ and\r\n  _marmolykes_,—blood-sucking women. Goethe made use of this in his\r\n  “Bride of Corinth.” The verses referring to vampirism, “suck thy\r\n  heart’s blood,” etc., can be thoroughly understood only when compared\r\n  with their ancient sources.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  In the latest literature we find the matter treated, but particularly\r\n  in Sacher-Masoch’s novels, which are hereafter to be alluded to, and\r\n  in Ernest von Wildenbruch’s “Brunhilde,” Rachilde’s “La Marquise de\r\n  Sade,” etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  So named from the writer, Sacher-Masoch, whose romances and novels\r\n  have as their particular object the description of this perversion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Comp., _supra_, Introduction, p. 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  The author’s “Neue Forschungen auf d.

Case 44), even though it is the only indication of\r\n  effemination mentioned in this case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Transactions of the Colorado State Medical Society, quoted in the\r\n  Alienist and Neurologist, 1883, p. 345.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  “To be at the feet of an imperious mistress; to obey her orders; to be\r\n  compelled to sue her for pardon,—these things are my most intense\r\n  delight.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  “Never daring to express my desire, I at least gave it rein under\r\n  circumstances that served to preserve in me the idea of it.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  “What Rousseau loves in women is not only the frowning brow, the\r\n  threatening hand, the angry glance, the imperious attitude, but it is\r\n  also the emotional state of which these are the objective translation;\r\n  he loves the fierce, disdainful woman who crushes him at her feet with\r\n  the weight of her royal displeasure.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  However, the domain of masochism must be sharply differentiated from\r\n  the principal subject of that work, which is, that love contains an\r\n  element of suffering. Unrequited love has always been described as\r\n  “sweet, but sorrowful;” and poets have spoken of “blissful pain” or\r\n  “painful bliss.” This must not, as it is by Z., be confounded with the\r\n  manifestations of masochism, any more than the characterization of an\r\n  unyielding lover as “cruel” should be. It is remarkable, however, that\r\n  Hamerling (“Amor und Psyche,” iv, Gesang) uses perfect masochistic\r\n  pictures, flagellation, etc., to express this feeling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  The desire to be trod upon also occurs in religious enthusiasts (comp.\r\n  Turgenjew, “Sonderbare Geschichten”).\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  In this story the writer describes a man whose greatest pleasure lies\r\n  in being treated like a slave by a beautiful woman, whom he loves.\r\n  Besides numerous scenes in which the man is whipped by the woman,\r\n  there are others in which he is trod upon by her. It is this act that\r\n  forms the principal means of excitement in the case above described.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  In Continental hotels the guests are accustomed to put their shoes in\r\n  the corridors at night, to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  However, against the theory that foot- and shoe-fetichism is a\r\n  manifestation of (latent) masochism, Dr. Moll (_op. cit._, p. 136)\r\n  raises the objection that it is still unexplained why the fetichist so\r\n  often prefers boots with high heels, then boots and shoes of a\r\n  particular kind—buttoned or laced. To this objection it may be\r\n  remarked that, in the first place, the high heels characterize the\r\n  shoes as feminine; and, in the second place, that in spite of the\r\n  sexual character of his inclination, the fetichist demands all kinds\r\n  of æsthetic qualities in his fetich (comp. Case 90).\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  There is apparently a connection between foot-fetichism and the fact\r\n  that certain persons of this kind, whom coitus does not satisfy, or\r\n  who are unable to perform it, find a substitute for it in tritus\r\n  membri inter pedes mulieris.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Analogy with the excesses of religious enthusiasm is found even here.\r\n  The religious enthusiast, Antoinette Bouvignon de la Porte, mixed her\r\n  food with fæces to punish herself (Zimmermann, _op. cit._, p. 124).\r\n  The beatified Marie Alacoque, to “mortify” herself, licked up with her\r\n  tongue the dejections of patients, and sucked their toes covered with\r\n  sores.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  The laws of the early Middle Ages gave the husband the right to kill\r\n  the wife; those of the later Middle Ages, the right to beat her. The\r\n  latter right was used freely, even by those of high standing (comp.\r\n  Schultze, Das höfische Leben zur Zeit des Minnesangs, Bd. i, p. 163\r\n  _et seq._). Yet, by the side of this, the paradoxical chivalry of the\r\n  Middle Ages stands unexplained.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Comp. Lady Milford’s words in Schiller’s “Kabale und Liebe”: “We women\r\n  can only choose between ruling and serving; but the highest pleasure\r\n  power affords is but a miserable substitute, if the greater joy of\r\n  being the slaves of a man we love is denied us!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Anthony and Cleopatra, v. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Comp. the author’s article, “über geschlechtliche Hörigkeit und\r\n  Masochismus,” in the Psychiatrischen Jahrbücher, Bd. x, p. 169 _et\r\n  seq._, where this subject is treated in detail, and particularly from\r\n  the forensic stand-point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  The expressions “slave” and “slavery,” though often used\r\n  metaphorically under such circumstances, are avoided here because they\r\n  are the favorite expressions of masochism, from which this “bondage”\r\n  must be strictly differentiated.\r\n\r\n  The expression “bondage” is not to be construed to mean J. S. Mill’s\r\n  “Bondage of Woman.” What Mill designates with this expression are laws\r\n  and customs, social and historical facts. Here, however, we always\r\n  speak of facts having peculiar individual motives that even conflict\r\n  with prevalent customs and laws.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the most important element is, that by the habit of submission\r\n  a kind of mechanical obedience, without consciousness of its motives,\r\n  which operates with automatic certainty, may be established, having no\r\n  opposing motives to contend with, because it lies beyond the threshold\r\n  of consciousness; and it may be used by the dominant individual like\r\n  an inanimate instrument.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Sexual bondage, of course, plays a _rôle_ in all literatures. Indeed,\r\n  for the poet, the extraordinary manifestations of the sexual life that\r\n  are not perverse form a rich and open field. The most celebrated\r\n  description of masculine “bondage” is that by Abbé Prévost, “Mano\r\n  Lescault.” An excellent description of feminine “bondage” is that of\r\n  “Leone Leoni,” by George Sand. But first of all comes Kleist’s\r\n  “Käthchen von Heilbronn,” who himself called it the counterpart of\r\n  (sadistic) “Penthesilea.” Halm’s “Griseldis” and many other similar\r\n  poems also belong here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  Cases may occur in which the sexual bondage is expressed in the same\r\n  acts that are common in masochism. When rough men whip their wives,\r\n  and the latter suffer for love, without, however, having a desire for\r\n  blows, we have a pseudo form of bondage that may simulate masochism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  It is very interesting, and dependent upon the nature of bondage and\r\n  masochism, which essentially correspond in external effects, that to\r\n  illustrate the former certain playful, metaphorical expressions are in\r\n  general use; such as “slavery,” “to bear chains,” “bound,” “to hold\r\n  the whip over,” “to harness to the triumphal car,” “to lie at the\r\n  feet,” “hen-pecked,” etc.,—all things which, literally carried out,\r\n  form the objects of the masochist’s desire. Such similes are\r\n  frequently used in daily life and have become trite. They are derived\r\n  from the language of poetry. Poetry has always recognized, within the\r\n  general idea of the passion of love, the element of dependence in the\r\n  lover, who practices self-sacrifice spontaneously or of necessity. The\r\n  facts of “bondage” have also always presented themselves to the\r\n  poetical imagination. When the poet chooses such expressions as those\r\n  mentioned, to picture the dependence of the lover in striking similes,\r\n  _he proceeds exactly as does the masochist_, who, to intensify the\r\n  idea of his dependence (his ultimate aim), creates such situations in\r\n  reality. In ancient poetry, the expression “domina” is used to signify\r\n  the loved one, with a preference for the simile of “casting in chains”\r\n  (_e.g._, Horace, Od. iv, 11). From antiquity through all the centuries\r\n  to our own times (comp. Grillparzer, “Ottokar,” Act v: “To rule is\r\n  sweet, almost as sweet as to obey”), the poetry of love is filled with\r\n  similar phrases and similes. The history of the word “mistress” is\r\n  also interesting. But poetry reacts on life. It is probable that the\r\n  courtly chivalry of the Middle Ages arose in this way. In its\r\n  reverence for women as “mistresses” in society and in individual\r\n  love-relations; its transference of the relations of feudalism and\r\n  vassalage to the relation between the knight and his lady; its\r\n  submission to all feminine whims; its love-tests and vows; its duty of\r\n  obedience to every command of the lady,—in all this, chivalry appears\r\n  as a systematic, poetical development of the “bondage” of love.\r\n  Certain extreme manifestations, like the deeds and suffering of Ulrich\r\n  von Lichtenstein or Pierre Vidal in the service of their ladies; or\r\n  the practice of the fraternity of the “Galois” in France, whose\r\n  members sought martyrdom in love and subjected themselves to all kinds\r\n  of suffering,—these clearly have a masochistic character, and\r\n  demonstrate the natural transformation of one phenomenon into the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  If it be considered that, as shown above, “sexual bondage” is a\r\n  phenomenon observed much more frequently and in a more pronounced\r\n  degree in the female sex than in the male, the thought arises that\r\n  masochism (if not always, at least as a rule) is an inheritance of the\r\n  “bondage” of feminine experience. Thus it comes into a relation—though\r\n  distant—with contrary sexual instinct, as a transference to the male\r\n  of a perversion really belonging to the female. This conception of\r\n  masochism as a rudimentary contrary sexual instinct, as a partial\r\n  effemination, here affecting only the secondary sexual character of\r\n  the vita sexualis (a theory still more unconditionally expressed in\r\n  the sixth edition of this work) finds its support in the statements of\r\n  the subjects of Case 44 and Case 50, who present other features of\r\n  effemination, and give as their ideal a relatively old woman who seeks\r\n  and wins them; and, further, in the fact that the (potent) masochist\r\n  prefers the _rôle_ of succubus, as shown by statements referring to\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  It must, however, be emphasized that “bondage” also plays no\r\n  unimportant _rôle_ in the masculine vita sexualis, and that masochism\r\n  in man may also be explained without any such transference of feminine\r\n  elements. It must also be remembered here that masochism, as well as\r\n  its counterpart, sadism, occurs in irregular combination with contrary\r\n  sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Of course, both have to contend with opposing ethical and æsthetic\r\n  motives _in foro interno_. After these have been overcome and sadism\r\n  appears, it immediately comes in conflict with the law. This is not\r\n  the case with masochism; which accounts for the greater frequency of\r\n  masochistic acts. But the instinct of self-preservation and fear of\r\n  pain oppose the realization of the latter. The practical significance\r\n  of masochism lies only in its relations to psychical impotence; while\r\n  that of sadism lies beyond that, and is principally forensic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  Every attempt to explain the facts of either sadism or masochism,\r\n  owing to the close connection of the two phenomena demonstrated here,\r\n  must also be suited to explain the other perversion. An attempt to\r\n  offer an explanation of sadism, by J. G. Kiernan (Chicago) (_vide_\r\n  “Psychological Aspects of the Sexual Appetite,” Alienist and\r\n  Neurologist, St. Louis, April, 1891) meets this requirement, and for\r\n  this reason may be briefly mentioned here. Kiernan, who has several\r\n  authorities in Anglo-American literature for his theory, starts from\r\n  the assumption of several naturalists (Dallinger, Drysdale, Rolph,\r\n  Cleukowsky) which conceives the so-called conjugation, a sexual act in\r\n  certain low forms of animal life, to be cannibalism, a devouring of\r\n  the partner in the act. He brings into immediate connection with this\r\n  the well-known facts that at the time of sexual union crabs tear limbs\r\n  from their bodies and spiders bite off the heads of the males, and\r\n  other sadistic acts performed by rutting animals with their consorts.\r\n  From this he passes to lust-murder and other lustful acts of cruelty\r\n  in man, and assumes that hunger and the sexual appetite are, in their\r\n  origin, identical; that the sexual cannibalism of lower forms of\r\n  animal life has an influence in higher forms and in man, and that\r\n  sadism is an example of atavism.\r\n\r\n  This explanation of sadism would, of course, also explain masochism;\r\n  for if the origin of sexual intercourse is to be sought in\r\n  cannibalistic processes, then both the survival of one sex and the\r\n  destruction of the other would fulfill the purpose of nature, and thus\r\n  the instinctive desire to be the victim would be explained. But it\r\n  must be stated in objection that the basis of this reasoning is\r\n  insufficient. The extremely complicated process of conjugation in\r\n  lower organisms, into which science has really penetrated only during\r\n  the last few years, is by no means to be regarded as simply a\r\n  devouring of one individual by another (comp. Weismann, Die Bedeutung\r\n  der Sexuellen Fortpflanzung für die Selectionstheorie, p. 51, Jena,\r\n  1886).\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  In Zola’s “Therese Raquin,” where the lover repeatedly kisses his\r\n  mistress’s boot, the case is quite different from that of shoe- and\r\n  boot-fetichists, who, at the sight of every boot worn by a lady, or\r\n  even alone, are thrown into sexual excitement, even to the extent of\r\n  ejaculation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  Though Binet (_op. cit._) declares that every sexual perversion,\r\n  without exception, depends upon such an “accident acting on a\r\n  predisposed subject” (where, under predisposition, only hyperæsthesia\r\n  in general is understood), yet such an assumption for other\r\n  perversions than fetichism is neither necessary nor satisfactory. For\r\n  example, it is not clear how the sight of another’s punishment could\r\n  excite sexually even a very excitable individual, if the physiological\r\n  relationship of lust and cruelty had not been developed into\r\n  _original_ sadism in an abnormally excitable individual.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  When young husbands who have associated much with prostitutes feel\r\n  impotent in the face of the chastity of their young wives—a thing that\r\n  frequently occurs—the condition may be regarded as a kind of\r\n  (psychical) fetichism in a wider sense. One of my patients was never\r\n  potent with his beautiful and chaste young wife, because he was\r\n  accustomed to the lascivious methods of prostitutes. When he now and\r\n  then attempted coitus with puellis he was perfectly potent. Hammond\r\n  (_op. cit._) reports a very similar interesting case. Of course, in\r\n  such cases, a bad conscience and hypochondriacal fear of impotence\r\n  play an important part.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  A kind of rudimentary sadism in L. and masochism in N.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  Great sexual hyperæsthesia. Comp. note on p. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  This is also sexual hyperæsthesia. Any intense excitement affects the\r\n  sexual sphere (Binet’s “dynamogénie générale”). Concerning this, Dr.\r\n  Moll communicates the following case: “A similar thing is described by\r\n  Mr. E., aged 27; merchant. While at school, and afterward, he often\r\n  had ejaculation with pleasurable feeling when he was seized with a\r\n  feeling of intense anxiety. Besides, almost every other physical or\r\n  mental pain exerted a similar influence. E., as he states, has a\r\n  normal sexual instinct, but suffers with nervous impotence.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Phila. Med. and Surg. Rep., Sept. 7, 1889.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  This case was originally reported by Dr. A. R. Reynolds, Chicago\r\n  (Western Med. Reporter, Nov., 1888).\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  Moll (_op. cit._ p. 131) reports: “A man, X., becomes intensely\r\n  excited sexually whenever he sees a woman with the hair in a braid;\r\n  loose hair, no matter how beautiful, cannot produce this effect.”\r\n\r\n  Of course, it is not justifiable to consider all hair-despoilers\r\n  fetichists, for in a few cases such acts are done for the purpose of\r\n  gain,—_i.e._, the stolen hair is not a fetich.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  Magnan (Arch, de Neurologie, vol. xxxiii, No. 69, 1892) gives the\r\n  details of a case of sexual perversion in a degenerate individual,\r\n  where the elements of fetichism and sadism were combined, and _faute\r\n  de mieux_ the sadistic impulse found satisfaction in self-mutilation.\r\n  The perverse impulse began at the age of six; the sight of a boy or\r\n  girl with a delicate, white skin awakened in him sexual appetite, with\r\n  a desire to bite and eat a piece of the skin. While caressing a horse,\r\n  the impulse to bite the soft skin of its nostrils arose, and afterward\r\n  the memory of this became associated with the act of onanism. Later,\r\n  he began to prick himself with pins, knives, etc., while masturbating.\r\n  The desire to bite and eat skin was also provoked by the sight of\r\n  shining blades, like those of scissors. He was always able to resist\r\n  the impulse to attack young girls; but the struggle was hard, and for\r\n  eight months he hesitated before venting his passion on his own\r\n  person. He was finally arrested in the act of cutting a large piece of\r\n  skin from his arm with scissors. Asked the motive of his\r\n  self-mutilation, he stated that for several hours he had been\r\n  following a young girl who had a fine, white skin, and was burning\r\n  with desire to cut out a piece of it and eat it. On his person there\r\n  were many scars of previous mutilations. The impulse was devoid of\r\n  natural sexual desire. Chewing the piece of skin provoked\r\n  ejaculation.—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  The frequent changes of style of dress which fashion dictates may be\r\n  referred to a physiological law. The reaction of the nervous system to\r\n  a constant stimulus diminishes in proportion to the duration of the\r\n  action of the stimulus. Constant association with nudity removes its\r\n  power to excite sexually. Owing to this, the savage endeavors to\r\n  attract attention by changing his physical peculiarities; he dresses\r\n  his hair in some remarkable way, or paints his body; then he tattooes\r\n  his skin, or performs striking self-mutilation, such as\r\n  half-castration and circumcision (comp. Westermarck, _op. cit._, p.\r\n  205). Finally, mutilation is replaced by movable appendages, upon\r\n  which ornaments are worn; and thus there is afforded opportunity for\r\n  _change_, in obedience to the unconscious physiological requirement,\r\n  which is called a “_taste_ for change.” Undoubtedly, woman’s desire\r\n  for changes of fashion is primarily dependent upon man’s desire to be\r\n  pleased; and her function in this direction has certainly been\r\n  transferred from him to her by civilization (comp. p. 16).—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  Comp: Goethe’s remarks about his adventure in Geneva (“Briefe aus der\r\n  Schweiz,” 1. Abtheil., Schluss).\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  The fact that the partly-veiled form is often more charming than when\r\n  it is perfectly nude, is, as far as object goes, similar, but quite\r\n  different psychically. This depends upon the effect of contrast and\r\n  expectation, which are common phenomena, and in no sense pathological.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  On page 124 (_op. cit._) Dr. Moll writes concerning this impulse in\r\n  hetero-sexual individuals: “The passion for handkerchiefs may go so\r\n  far that the man is entirely under their control. A woman tells me: ‘I\r\n  know a certain gentleman, and when I see him at a distance I only need\r\n  to draw out my handkerchief so that it peeps out of my pocket, and I\r\n  am certain that he will follow me as a dog follows its master. Go\r\n  where I please, this gentleman will follow me. He may be riding in a\r\n  carriage or engaged in important business, and yet, when he sees my\r\n  handkerchief he drops everything in order to follow me,—_i.e._, my\r\n  handkerchief.’”\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Garnier (Anomalies Sexuelles, Paris, pp. 508, 509) reports two cases\r\n  (Cases 222 and 223) that are apparently opposed to this assumption,\r\n  particularly the first, in which despair about the unfaithfulness of a\r\n  lover led the individual to submit to the seductions of men. But the\r\n  case itself clearly shows that this individual never found pleasure in\r\n  homo-sexual acts. In Case 223, the individual was effeminated _ab\r\n  origine_, or was at least a psychical hermaphrodite.\r\n\r\n  Those who hold to the opinion that the origin of homo-sexual feelings\r\n  and instinct is found to be exclusively in defective education and\r\n  other psychological influences are entirely in error.\r\n\r\n  An untainted male may be raised never so much like a female, and a\r\n  female like a male, but they will not become homo-sexual. The natural\r\n  disposition is the determining condition; not education and other\r\n  accidental circumstances, like seduction. There can be no thought of\r\n  contrary sexual instinct save when the person of the same sex exerts a\r\n  psycho-sexual influence on the individual, and thus brings about\r\n  libido and orgasm,—_i.e._, has a psychical attraction. Those cases are\r\n  quite different in which, _faute de mieux_, with great sensuality and\r\n  a defective æsthetic sense, the body of a person of the same sex is\r\n  used for an onanistic act (not for coitus in a psychical sense).\r\n\r\n  In his excellent monograph, Moll shows very clearly and convincingly\r\n  the importance of original predisposition in contrast with exciting\r\n  causes (comp. _op. cit._, pp. 156–175). He knows “many cases where\r\n  early sexual intercourse with men was not capable of inducing\r\n  perversion.” Moll significantly says, further: “I know of such an\r\n  epidemic (of mutual onanism) in a Berlin school, where a person who is\r\n  now an actor shamelessly introduced mutual onanism. Though I now know\r\n  the names of very many urnings in Berlin, yet I could not ascertain,\r\n  even with anything like probability, that among all the scholars of\r\n  that school at that time there was one that had become an urning; but,\r\n  on the other hand, I have quite certain knowledge that many of those\r\n  scholars are now normal sexually, in feeling and intercourse.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Comp, author’s Experimental Study in the Domain of Hypnotism, 1889.

G.\r\n  Kiernan’s article on “Responsibility in Sexual Perversion,” read\r\n  before the Chicago Medical Society, March 7, 1892: “In accordance with\r\n  the well-known physiological law, that too frequent excitation of a\r\n  nerve exhausts the reaction of that nerve to that excitant, sexual\r\n  excess exhausts the normal reaction, whence it occurs that abnormal\r\n  stimulus is required and the vice type of sexual perversion results.\r\n  Such vice types crop up among savages. Dr. A. B. Holder (N. Y. Med.\r\n  Jour., 1889) describes a sexual pervert called the ‘bote’ by the\r\n  Montana and the ‘burdach’ by the Washington Indians. Such a pervert is\r\n  found among all the tribes of the Northwest. Like all other sexual\r\n  perverts, these ‘botes’ can recognize each other. Dr. Holder has found\r\n  that the ‘bote’ wears the squaw dress, parts his hair like a squaw,\r\n  and assumes feminine speech and manners. Their features are often\r\n  masculine. In childhood feminine dress and manners are assumed, but\r\n  not until puberty do ‘bote’ practices result. These consist in taking\r\n  the male organ of the active party in the lips of the ‘bote,’ who\r\n  experiences the sexual orgasm at the same time. A ‘bote’ examined by\r\n  Dr. Holder was a splendidly formed fellow, of prepossessing face, in\r\n  perfect health, active in movement, and happy in disposition. By\r\n  offering payment, he induced him to submit himself, though with\r\n  considerable reluctance, to a thorough examination. He was five feet\r\n  eight inches high, weighed one hundred and fifty-eight pounds, and had\r\n  a frank, intelligent face,—being an Indian, of course beardless. He\r\n  was thirty-three years of age, and had worn woman’s dress for\r\n  twenty-eight years. His dress was the usual dress of the Indian\r\n  female, consisting of four articles,—a single dress or gown of half a\r\n  dozen yards of cloth, made loose with wide sleeves, and skirt reaching\r\n  to the ankles, the skirt and body of one piece, very much like the\r\n  ‘Mother Hubbard’ _negligée_ worn by ladies; a beaded belt loosely\r\n  confining this at the waist; stockings from government annuity goods,\r\n  and buckskin moccasins extending above the ankles. The hair,\r\n  twenty-four or twenty-six inches long, was parted in the centre and\r\n  allowed to hang loose in two masses behind the shoulders. Since among\r\n  the Sioux and some other tribes it is usual for men to wear their hair\r\n  in this way, it is well to observe that in this tribe (Absaroke) the\r\n  men usually wear the hair in long braids, and always part it on the\r\n  side and ‘roach’ the front. His skin was smooth and free from hair,\r\n  there being absolutely none on the legs, arms, or breast, or in the\r\n  arm-pits. This is of no special significance, as male and female\r\n  Indians are both free from hair on these parts of the body. The mammæ\r\n  were as rudimentary as those of the male. When he removed his dress he\r\n  threw his thighs together so as to completely conceal the organs,\r\n  whether male or female; such a movement is made by timid women under\r\n  examination,—a movement usually successful in the female, owing to the\r\n  non-projecting character of the genitals and to the rotundity of the\r\n  thighs; but not usually easy, for the reverse reasons, in the male. In\r\n  this the ‘bote’—either from the conformation of the thighs, which had\r\n  the feminine rotundity, or from skill acquired by habit—succeeded\r\n  completely. When he separated his thighs, male organs came into view,\r\n  in size perhaps not quite so large as the physique of the man would\r\n  indicate, but in position and shape altogether normal. The penis was\r\n  flaccid. The ‘bote’ in habits very closely resembles a class described\r\n  by Hippocrates among the Scythians of Caucasus, called by the Greeks\r\n  anandreis, a word strikingly similar in meaning to ‘bote.’”—TRANS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Bibliography (besides works mentioned hereafter): Tardieu, Des\r\n  attentats aux moeurs, 7 édit., 1878, p. 210.—Hofmann, Lehrb. d. ger.\r\n  Med., 3 Aufl., pp. 172, 850.—Gley, Revue philosophique, 1884, Nr.\r\n  1.—Magnan, Annal. med.-psychol., 1885, p. 458.—Shaw and Ferris,\r\n  Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 1883, April.—Bernhardi, Der\r\n  Uranismus, Berlin (Volksbuchhandlung), 1882.—Chevalier, De l’inversion\r\n  de l’instinct sexual, Paris, 1885.—Ritti, Gaz. hebdom. de médecine et\r\n  de chirurg., 1878, 4.

Erfahrungsseelenkunde, vol. viii, Berlin, 1791, there are\r\n  references to contrary sexual instinct in man. In fact, there two\r\n  biographies of men are reported who manifested an enthusiastic love\r\n  for persons of their own sex. In the second case, which is\r\n  particularly noteworthy, the patient himself explains his aberration\r\n  by the fact that, as a child, he was caressed only by grown persons,\r\n  and, as a boy of ten or twelve years, only by his school-fellows.\r\n  “This, and the want of association with persons of the opposite sex,\r\n  in me, caused the natural inclination toward the female sex to be\r\n  entirely diverted to the male sex. I am still quite indifferent to\r\n  women.”\r\n\r\n  It cannot be determined whether such a case is one of congenital\r\n  (psycho-sexual hermaphroditism?) or acquired contrary sexual instinct.\r\n  The oldest case of contrary sexual instinct, that has thus far been\r\n  proved in Germany, is that of a woman who was married to another, and\r\n  gratified herself sexually with a leathern priapus. A case of\r\n  viraginity, historically and legally interesting, derived from the\r\n  legal proceedings, which took place early in the eighteenth century,\r\n  is reported by Dr. Müller (Alexandersbad), in Friedrich’s Blätter f.\r\n  ger.

In this instance, lues of the parents played a part,\r\n  as in a similar case of Scholz (Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger. Med.), in\r\n  which the perversion of the sexual desires stood in causal relation\r\n  with an arrest of psychical development, caused by traumatism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  This supposition is overthrown by the result of the post-mortem of my\r\n  case (118), where the brain-weight was 1150 grammes, and of Case 130,\r\n  where it was 1175 grammes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  That inversion of the sexual instinct is not infrequent is proved,\r\n  among other things, by the circumstance that it is frequently a\r\n  subject in novels. Chevalier (_op. cit._) points out in French\r\n  literature, besides the novels of Balzac, like “La Passion au Desert”\r\n  (treating of bestiality) and “Sarrazine” (treating of the love of a\r\n  woman for a eunuch), Diderot’s “La Religieuse” (a story of one given\r\n  to _amor lesbicus_); Balzac’s “La Fille aux Yeux d’Or” (_amor\r\n  lesbicus_); Th. Gautier’s “Mademoiselle de Maupin”; Feydeau’s “La\r\n  Comtesse de Chalis”; Flaubert’s “Salammbo,” etc. Belot’s “Mademoiselle\r\n  Giraud, Ma Femme” may also be mentioned (now translated into English).\r\n  It is interesting that the heroines of these (Lesbian) novels appear\r\n  in the character and _rôle_ of the husband of a lover of the same sex,\r\n  and that their love is extremely passionate. Moreover, the neuropathic\r\n  foundation of this sexual perversion does not escape the writers. This\r\n  theme is treated, in German literature, in “Fridolin’s heimliche Ehe,”\r\n  by Wilbrand; in “Brick and Brack Oder Licht in Schatten,” by Emerich\r\n  Graf Stadion. The oldest urning’s romance is probably that published\r\n  by Petronius at Rome, under the Empire, under the title Satyricon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  Comp. author’s work, “Ueber psychosexuales Zwitterthum,” in the\r\n  internationalen Centralblatt f. d.

He could report a\r\n  number of cases of his acquaintance, in which married men at the same\r\n  time had “relations” with men.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  Later it became known that a near relative died insane, and, further,\r\n  that eight of his parent’s children had died of acute or chronic\r\n  hydrocephalus at ages ranging from one to fifteen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n    “Thou art like any flower, so sweet, so beautiful, so pure,” etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n           “Lowering like the heavens, frowns the world on me,\r\n           Yet blest or cursed will be the fate I meet.\r\n           With trusting heart, dear friend, I think of thee!\r\n           God keep thee, dear! it would have been too sweet!\r\n           God keep thee, dear! such happiness was not to be!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  Comp. the expert medical opinion of this case, by Dr. Birnbacher, in\r\n  Friedreich’s Blätter f. ger.

His assumption that it is\r\n  related to masochism, in that there is a stimulus for the _voyeur_ in\r\n  suffering at seeing a woman in the possession of another, does not\r\n  seem to me to be justified. For further details, _vide_ Moll, “Die\r\n  conträre Sexualempfindung,” p. 137.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  Annal. médico-psychol., 1849, p. 515; 1863, p. 57; 1864, p. 215; 1866,\r\n  p. 253.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Comp. the cases of Tardieu, Attentats, p. 182–192.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Comp.

Modern criminal law no longer recognizes the principle,\r\n  “volenti non fit injuria”; and the present Austrian statute, in § 4,\r\n  says expressly: “Crimes may also be committed on persons who demand\r\n  their commission on themselves.”\r\n\r\n  As Herbst (Handb. d. österr. Strafrechts., Wien, 1878, p. 72) remarks,\r\n  there are, nevertheless, crimes conditioned by the absence of assent\r\n  on the part of the injured individual, which cease to be such as soon\r\n  as the injured individual has given consent,—_e.g._, theft, rape.\r\n\r\n  But Herbst also enumerates here the limitation of personal freedom\r\n  (?).\r\n\r\n  Of late a decided change of views on this point has taken place. The\r\n  German criminal law regards the consent of a man to his own death of\r\n  such importance that a very different and much milder punishment is\r\n  inflicted under such circumstances (§ 216); and it is the same in\r\n  Austrian law (Austrian Abridgment, § 222). The so-called double\r\n  suicide of lovers was the act considered. In bodily injury and\r\n  deprivation of freedom, the consent of the victim must also receive\r\n  consideration at the hands of the judge. Certainly a knowledge of\r\n  masochism is of importance in making a judgment of the probability of\r\n  asserted consent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  According to Austrian law, this crime should fall under § 411, as\r\n  _slight_ bodily injury; according to the German criminal law, it is\r\n  bodily injury (comp. Liszt, p. 325).\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  Cases, _vide_ Friedreich’s Blätter f. ger.

Kirn, Allg. Zeitschr. f. Psych., 39, p. 217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  I follow the usual terminology in describing bestiality and pederasty\r\n  under the general term sodomy. In Genesis (chap. xix), whence this\r\n  word comes, it signifies exclusively the vice of pederasty. Later,\r\n  sodomy was often used synonymously with bestiality. The moral\r\n  theologians, like St. Alphons of Liguori, Gury, and others, have\r\n  always distinguished correctly, _i.e._, in the sense of Genesis,\r\n  between sodomia, _i.e._, concubitus cum persona ejusdem sexus, and\r\n  bestialitas, _i.e._, concubitus cum bestia (comp. Olfus,\r\n  Pastoralmedicin, p. 78).\r\n\r\n  The jurists brought confusion into the terminology by establishing a\r\n  “Sodomia ratione sexus” and a “S. ratione generis.” Science, however,\r\n  should assert itself as _ansilla theologiæ_, and return to the correct\r\n  usage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  For interesting histories, _vide_ Krauss, Psychol. d.

Med., p.\r\n  180.—Rosenbaum, Die Lustseuche.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  How difficult, unpleasant, and dangerous for the jurist judgment of\r\n  these “coitus-like” acts for the establishment of the objective fact\r\n  of the crime may be is well shown by an article on the\r\n  punishableness of male intercourse, in the Zeitschr. f. d. gesammte\r\n  Strafrechtswissenschaft., Bd. vii, Heft 1, as well as by a similar\r\n  one in Friedreich’s Blätter f. ger.

From there\r\n  it spread to Rome, where it flourished luxuriantly. In Persia and\r\n  China (where it is actually tolerated) it is wide-spread, as it also\r\n  is in Europe. (Comp. Tarnowsky _et al._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Lombroso (Der Verbrecher, p. 20 _et seq._) shows that also, in case of\r\n  animals, intercourse with the same sex occurs where normal indulgence\r\n  is impossible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Comp.

CAPP, M.D., Philadelphia. This is just such a book as a\r\nfamily physician would advise his lady patients to obtain and read. It\r\nanswers many questions which every busy practitioner of medicine has put\r\nto him in the sick-room at a time when it is neither expedient nor wise\r\nto impart the information sought.\r\n\r\nIt is complete in one beautifully printed (large, clear type) 12mo\r\nvolume of 150 pages.\r\n\r\n  Handsomely bound in Extra Cloth, price, post-paid, in the United\r\n    States and Canada, $1.00, net; Great Britain, 5s. 6d; France, 6 fr.\r\n    20.\r\n\r\n               In Paper Cover (Unabridged), 50 cts., net.\r\n\r\nIn the 144 pages allotted to him he has compressed an amount of homely\r\nwisdom on the physical, mental, and moral development of the female\r\nchild from birth to maturity which is to be found elsewhere in only the\r\ngreat book of experience. It is, of course, a book for mothers, but is\r\none so void of offense in expression or ideas that it can safely be\r\nrecommended for all whose minds are sufficiently developed to appreciate\r\nits teachings.—_Philadelphia Public Ledger._\r\n\r\nMany delicate subjects are treated with skill and in a manner which\r\ncannot strike any one as improper or bold. The absolute ignorance in\r\nwhich most young girls are allowed to exist, even until adult life, is\r\noften productive of much misery, both mental and physical. Quite a\r\nnumber of books written by physicians for popular use have been prepared\r\nin such a way that the professional man can read between the lines\r\nstrong bids for popular favor, etc. These objectionable features will\r\nnot be found in Dr. Capp’s _brochure_, and for this reason it is worthy\r\nthe confidence of physicians.—_Medical News._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _CATHELL_\r\n\r\n                     Book on the Physician Himself\r\n\r\n   AND THINGS THAT CONCERN HIS REPUTATION AND SUCCESS.

This is the author’s final\r\nrevision of one of the most useful, successful, and popular medical\r\nbooks ever published. It has been wisely and carefully revised\r\nthroughout. The well-known charming style of the author is preserved\r\nintact, while the practical value of the book is truly enhanced by the\r\naddition of much of the author’s gathered wisdom not introduced into any\r\nprevious edition. The volume has been brought to perfection, as far as\r\nhuman effort can achieve, and though enlarged to 350 _Royal Octavo\r\nPages_ the price has not been increased.\r\n\r\n Handsomely Bound in Extra Cloth, price, in the United States and Canada,\r\n post-paid, $2.00, net; in Great Britain, 11s. 6d.; in France, 12 fr. 40.\r\n\r\n“The Physician Himself” interested me so much that I actually read it\r\nthrough at one sitting. It is brimful of the very best advice possible\r\nfor medical men. I, for one, shall try to profit by it.—_Prof. William\r\nGoodell, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nIt is marked with good common sense and replete with excellent maxims\r\nand suggestions for the guidance of medical men.—_The British Medical\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\nWe advise our readers to buy it. It will give them food for thought and\r\nshow them how to and how not to achieve reputation and success.—_The\r\nMedical Age._\r\n\r\nWe cannot too strongly commend it to the attention of every young\r\ndoctor. Many a lesson is pleasantly and gently taught in its pages which\r\ncannot otherwise be learned unless by bitter experience.—_Canada Medical\r\nRecord._\r\n\r\nOf course, one reason for its occult power is that it is written with\r\nadmirable grace and precision, besides presenting the ups and downs of a\r\nphysician’s life in such a natural and perfect way. The book will help\r\nany one who will read it. It tells you how to begin practice; leads you\r\ninto medical ethics properly, and, carefully studied, the pages of this\r\nbook will be of great benefit to the young and old.—_Charlotte Medical\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\nThis book is evidently the production of an unspoiled mind and the fruit\r\nof a ripe career. I admire its pure tone and feel the value of its\r\npractical points. How I wish I could have read such a guide at the\r\noutset of my career!—_Prof. James Nevins Hyde, Chicago, Ill._\r\n\r\n“The Physician Himself” is useful alike to the tyro and the sage—the\r\nneophyte and the veteran. It is a _headlight_ in the splendor of whose\r\nbeams a multitude of our profession shall find their way to\r\nsuccess.—_Prof. J. M. Bodine, Dean University of Louisville._\r\n\r\nWe have read one of the former, and smaller, editions through very\r\ncarefully, and know of no work in medical literature more profitable for\r\nperusal and possession.—_Denver Medical Times._\r\n\r\nThis book will do a world of good, a good that will be far-reaching and\r\nconstant, and the fact that it has reached its tenth edition proves\r\ntoward a higher and yet higher teaching, that “the elevation of the\r\nprofession” is a consistent and timely aim.—_Chicago Clinical Review._\r\n\r\n                              _CLEVENGER_\r\n\r\n                           Spinal Concussion.\r\n\r\n SURGICALLY CONSIDERED AS A CAUSE OF SPINAL INJURY, AND NEUROLOGICALLY\r\n   RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN SYMPTOM GROUP, FOR WHICH IS SUGGESTED THE\r\n DESIGNATION ERICHSEN’S DISEASE, AS ONE FORM OF THE TRAUMATIC NEUROSES.\r\n\r\nBy S.

Such is the\r\ncase with the work before us. It is difficult to put it aside after one\r\nhas begun to read it.—_Memphis Med. Monthly._\r\n\r\nDr. Coltman has written a very readable book, illustrated with\r\nreproductions of photographs taken by himself.—_Boston Med. and Surg.\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\nAttached to a number of hospitals and dispensaries, he has had ample\r\nopportunity to observe the medical aspect of the Chinese. The most\r\nprevalent diseases are such as affect the alimentary tract and eye\r\ntroubles. Renal troubles are also frequent. Skin diseases are abundant\r\nand syphilis is far from infrequent. Erysipelas is rare and enteric\r\nfever infrequent. Cholera appears in epidemics and is then frightfully\r\nfatal. Leprosy, of course, is common, and the author states that it\r\ncannot be contagious, as is supposed by many, or it would assume a\r\nterrible prevalence in China, where lepers are permitted to go about\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWe will not further mention the subjects discussed in this excellent\r\nbook. The style of the author is very interesting and taking, and much\r\ninformation is given in an entertaining manner. The political situation\r\nis very intelligently handled in its various bearings. The\r\nphoto-engravings are handsome and well-executed, the book in general\r\nbeing gotten up in a very artistic manner. We can heartily commend this\r\nwork not only to physicians, but to intelligent lay readers.—_St. Louis\r\nMedical Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _DAVIS_\r\n\r\n         CONSUMPTION: How to Prevent it and How to Live with it.\r\n\r\n ITS NATURE, CAUSES, PREVENTION, AND THE MODE OF LIFE, CLIMATE, EXERCISE,\r\n                FOOD, AND CLOTHING NECESSARY FOR ITS CURE.\r\n\r\nBy N.

The whole subject is treated from\r\nthe present stand-point of electric science _with new and original\r\nillustrations_, the thorough studies of the author and his wide clinical\r\nexperience rendering him an authority upon electricity itself and its\r\ntherapeutic applications. The author has enhanced the practical value of\r\nthe work by including _the exact details_ of treatment and results in a\r\nnumber of cases taken from his private and hospital practice.\r\n\r\n Price, post-paid, in the United States and Canada, $1.50, net; in Great\r\n                  Britain, 8s. 6d.; in France, 9 fr. 35.\r\n\r\n  A new edition of this practical manual attests the utility of its\r\n  existence and the recognition of its merits. The directions are\r\n  simple, easy to follow and to put into practice; the ground is well\r\n  covered, and nothing is assumed, the entire book being the record of\r\n  experience.—_Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases._\r\n\r\n  It is only a few months since we noticed the first edition of this\r\n  little book; and it is only necessary to add now that we consider it\r\n  the best treatise on this subject we have seen, and that the\r\n  improvements introduced into this edition make it more valuable\r\n  still.—_Boston Medical and Surgical Journ._\r\n\r\n  The style is clear, but condensed. Useless details are omitted, the\r\n  reports of cases being pruned of all irrelevant material. The book is\r\n  an exceedingly valuable one, and represents an amount of study and\r\n  experience which is only appreciated after a careful reading.—_Medical\r\n  Record._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Physicians’ Interpreter.\r\n\r\n  IN FOUR LANGUAGES (ENGLISH, FRENCH, GERMAN, AND ITALIAN). SPECIALLY\r\n                  ARRANGED FOR DIAGNOSIS BY M. VON V.\r\n\r\nThe object of this little work is to meet a need often keenly felt by\r\nthe busy physician, namely, the need of some quick and reliable method\r\nof communicating intelligibly with patients of those nationalities and\r\nlanguages unfamiliar to the practitioner. The plan of the book is a\r\nsystematic arrangement of questions upon the various branches of\r\nPractical Medicine, and each question is so worded that the only answer\r\nrequired of the patient is merely Yes or No. The questions are all\r\nnumbered, and a complete Index renders them always available for quick\r\nreference. The book is written by one who is well versed in English,\r\nFrench, German, and Italian, being an excellent teacher in all those\r\nlanguages, and who has also had considerable hospital experience.

It is handsomely printed, and bound in flexible red\r\n  leather in the form of a diary. It would scarcely make itself felt in\r\n  one’s hip-pocket, and would insure its bearer against any ordinary\r\n  conversational difficulty in dealing with foreign-speaking people, who\r\n  are constantly coming into our city hospitals.—_New York Medical\r\n  Journal._\r\n\r\n  This little volume is one of the most ingenious aids to the physician\r\n  which we have seen. We heartily commend the book to any one who, being\r\n  without a knowledge of the foreign languages, is obliged to treat\r\n  those who do not know our own language.—_St. Louis Courier of\r\n  Medicine._\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Medical Bulletin Visiting-List or Physicians’ Call Record.\r\n\r\n ARRANGED UPON AN ORIGINAL AND CONVENIENT MONTHLY AND WEEKLY PLAN FOR THE\r\n                 DAILY RECORDING OF PROFESSIONAL VISITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Frequent Rewriting of Names Unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis Visiting-List is arranged so that the names of patients need be\r\nwritten but ONCE a month instead of FOUR times a month, as in the\r\nold-style lists. By means of a new feature, a simple device consisting\r\nof STUB OR HALF LEAVES IN THE FORM OF INSERTS, the first week’s visits\r\nare recorded in the usual way, and the second week’s visits are begun by\r\nsimply turning over the half-leaf without the necessity of rewriting the\r\npatients’ names. This very easily understood process is repeated until\r\nthe month is ended and the record has been kept complete in every detail\r\nof VISIT, CHARGE, CREDIT, etc., and the labor and time of entering and\r\ntransferring names at least THREE times in the month has been saved.\r\nThere are no intricate rulings; not the least amount of time can be lost\r\nin comprehending the plan, for it is acquired at a glance.\r\n\r\n                    THE THREE DIFFERENT STYLES MADE.\r\n\r\nThe No. 1 Style of this List provides space for the DAILY record of\r\nseventy different names each month for a year; for physicians who prefer\r\na List that will accommodate a larger practice we have made a No. 2\r\nStyle, which provides space for the daily record of 105 different names\r\neach month for a year, and for physicians who may prefer a Pocket\r\nRecord-Book of less thickness than either of these styles we have made a\r\nNo. 3 Style, in which “The Blanks for the Recording of Visits in” have\r\nbeen made into removable sections. These sections are very thin, and are\r\nmade up so as to answer in full the demand of the largest practice, each\r\nsection providing ample space for the DAILY RECORD OF 210 DIFFERENT\r\nNAMES for two months; or 105 different names daily each month for four\r\nmonths; or seventy different names daily each month for six months. Six\r\nsets of these sections go with each copy of NO. 3 STYLE.\r\n\r\n             SPECIAL FEATURES NOT FOUND IN ANY OTHER LIST.\r\n\r\nIn this NO. 3 STYLE the PRINTED MATTER, and such matter as the BLANK\r\nFORMS FOR ADDRESSES OF PATIENTS, Obstetric Record, Vaccination Record,\r\nCash Account, Birth and Death Records, etc., are fastened permanently in\r\nthe back of the book. The addition of a removable section does not\r\nincrease the thickness more than an eighth of an inch. This brings the\r\nbook into such a small compass that no one can object to it on account\r\nof its thickness, as its bulk is VERY MUCH LESS than that of any\r\nvisiting-list ever published. Every physician will at once understand\r\nthat as soon as a section is full it can be taken out, filed away, and\r\nanother inserted without the least inconvenience or trouble. _Extra or\r\nadditional sections will be furnished at any time for 15 cents each or\r\n$1.75 per dozen._ This Visiting-List contains calendars, valuable\r\nmiscellaneous data, important tables, and other useful printed matter\r\nusually placed in Physicians’ Visiting-Lists.\r\n\r\nPhysicians of many years’ standing and with large practices pronounce it\r\nTHE BEST LIST THEY HAVE EVER SEEN. It is handsomely bound in fine,\r\nstrong leather, with flap, including a pocket for loose memoranda, etc.,\r\nand is furnished with a Dixon lead-pencil of excellent quality and\r\nfinish. It is compact and convenient for carrying in the pocket. Size, 4\r\n× 6⅞ inches.\r\n\r\n                           IN THREE STYLES.                  NET PRICES.\r\n No. 1.

SEIBERT, M.D., of Easton, Pa.\r\n\r\nProbably no class of people lose more money through carelessly kept\r\naccounts and overlooked or neglected bills than physicians. Often\r\ndetained at the bedside of the sick until late at night, or deprived of\r\neven a modicum of rest, it is with great difficulty that he spares the\r\ntime or puts himself in condition to give the same care to his own\r\nfinancial interests that a merchant, a lawyer, or even a farmer devotes.\r\nIt is then plainly apparent that a system of bookkeeping and accounts\r\nthat, without sacrificing accuracy, but, on the other hand, ensuring it,\r\nat the same time relieves the keeping of a physician’s book of half\r\ntheir complexity and two-thirds the labor, is a convenience which will\r\nbe eagerly welcomed by thousands of overworked physicians. Such a system\r\nhas at last been devised, and we take pleasure in offering it to the\r\nprofession in the form of The Physician’s All-Requisite Time- and\r\nLabor-Saving Account-Book.\r\n\r\nThere is no exaggeration in stating that this Account-Book and Ledger\r\nreduces the labor of keeping your accounts more than one-half, and at\r\nthe same time secures the greatest degree of accuracy. We may mention a\r\nfew of the superior advantages of The Physician’s All-Requisite Time-\r\nand Labor-Saving Account-Book, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  =_First_=—Will meet all the requirements of the law and courts.\r\n\r\n  =_Second_=—Self-explanatory; no cipher code.\r\n\r\n  =_Third_=—Its completeness without sacrificing anything.\r\n\r\n  =_Fourth_=—No posting; one entry only.\r\n\r\n  =_Fifth_=—Universal; can be commenced at any time of the year, and can\r\n    be continued indefinitely until every account is filled.\r\n\r\n  =_Sixth_=—Absolutely no waste of space.\r\n\r\n  =_Seventh_=—One person must needs be sick every day of the year to\r\n    fill his account, or might be ten years about it and require no more\r\n    than the space for one account in this ledger.\r\n\r\n  =_Eighth_=—Double the number and many times more than the number of\r\n    accounts in any similar book; the 300–page book contains space for\r\n    900 accounts, and the 600–page book contains space for 1800\r\n    accounts.\r\n\r\n  =_Ninth_=—There are no smaller spaces.\r\n\r\n  =_Tenth_=—Compact without sacrificing completeness; every account\r\n    complete on same page—a decided advantage and recommendation.\r\n\r\n  =_Eleventh_=—Uniform size of leaves.\r\n\r\n  =_Twelfth_=—The statement of the most complicated account is at once\r\n    before you at any time of month or year—in other words, the account\r\n    itself as it stands is its simplest statement.\r\n\r\n  =_Thirteenth_=—No transferring of accounts, balances, etc.\r\n\r\nTo all physicians desiring a quick, accurate, and comprehensive method\r\nof keeping their accounts, we can safely say that no book as suitable as\r\nthis one has ever been devised.

The second\r\n  edition is a great improvement over the first, all of the matter being\r\n  thoroughly revised, much of it being rewritten, and many additions\r\n  being made.

The book will prove a valuable addition to the\r\n  physician’s library.—_Occidental Med. Times._\r\n\r\n  It is a meritorious work, with many unique features. It is richly\r\n  illustrated by well-tried prescriptions showing the practical\r\n  application of the various drugs discussed.

Though the author goes to some extent into\r\ntechnicalities, he confines himself to the use of good, plain English,\r\nand in that respect sets a notable example to many other writers on\r\nsimilar subjects. Furthermore, the book is written from a thoroughly\r\nAmerican stand-point.—_Medical Record._\r\n\r\nThis is an exceedingly interesting book, both scientific and\r\npractical in character, intended for both professional and lay\r\nreaders.

READING, A.M., M.D., Professor of Physiology in the Chicago\r\nVeterinary College, writes:—“I have carefully examined the ‘Smith’s\r\nPhysiology,’ published by you, and like it. It is comprehensive,\r\nexhaustive, and complete, and is especially adapted to those who desire\r\nto obtain a full knowledge of the principles of physiology, and are not\r\nsatisfied with a mere smattering of the cardinal points.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Smith’s presentment of his subject is as brief as the status of the\r\nscience permits, and to this much-desired conciseness he has added an\r\nequally welcome clearness of statement. The illustrations in the work\r\nare exceedingly good, and must prove a valuable aid to the full\r\nunderstanding of the text—_Journal of Comparative Medicine and Surgery._\r\n\r\nVeterinary practitioners and graduates will read it with pleasure.\r\nVeterinary students will readily acquire needed knowledge from its\r\npages, and veterinary schools, which would be well equipped for the work\r\nthey aim to perform, cannot ignore it as their text-book in\r\nphysiology.—_American Veterinary Review._\r\n\r\nAltogether, Professor Smith’s “Physiology of the Domestic Animals” is a\r\nhappy production, and will be hailed with delight in both the human\r\nmedical and veterinary medical worlds. It should find its place,\r\nbesides, in all agricultural libraries.—PAUL PAQUIN, M.D., V.S., in the\r\n_Weekly Medical Review_.\r\n\r\nThe author has judiciously made the nutritive functions the strong point\r\nof the work, and has devoted special attention to the subject of foods\r\nand digestion.

His book contains over seven\r\n  hundred large pages, and is profusely illustrated with original\r\n  diagrams and sketches in colors, and with many carefully selected\r\n  wood-cuts and reproduced photographs of typical cases. A large amount\r\n  of valuable information, not a little of which has but recently\r\n  appeared in medical literature, is presented in compact form, and thus\r\n  made easily accessible. In our opinion, Dr. Ranney’s book ought to\r\n  meet with a cordial reception at the hands of the medical profession,\r\n  for, even though the author’s views may be sometimes open to question,\r\n  it cannot be disputed that his work bears evidence of scientific\r\n  method and honest opinion.—_American Journal of Insanity._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STANTON’S\r\n\r\n                 Practical and Scientific Physiognomy;\r\n\r\n                                   OR\r\n\r\n                           How to Read Faces.\r\n\r\nBy MARY OLMSTED STANTON.
