BY PROFESSOR GOLDWIN SMITH                         539\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the great and fertile scientific conceptions which have either\r\noriginated or become firmly established during the nineteenth century,\r\nthe theory of evolution, if not the greatest of them all, will\r\ncertainly take its place in the front rank. As a partial explanation\r\n(for no complete explanation is possible to finite intelligence) of the\r\nphenomena of nature, it illuminates every department of science, from\r\nthe study of the most remote cosmic phenomena accessible to us to that\r\nof the minutest organisms revealed by the most powerful microscopes;\r\nwhile upon the great problem of the mode of origin of the various\r\nforms of life—long considered insoluble—it throws so clear a light\r\nthat to many biologists it seems to afford as complete a solution, in\r\nprinciple, as we can expect to reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE AND LIMITS OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nSo many of the objections which are still made to the theory of\r\nevolution, and especially to that branch of it which deals with living\r\norganisms, rest upon a misconception of what it professes to explain,\r\nand even of what any theory can possibly explain, that a few words on\r\nits nature and limits seem to be necessary.\r\n\r\nEvolution, as a general principle, implies that all things in the\r\nuniverse, as we see them, have arisen from other things which\r\npreceded them by a process of modification, under the action of those\r\nall-pervading but mysterious agencies known to us as “natural forces,”\r\nor, more generally, “the laws of nature.” More particularly the term\r\nevolution implies that the process is an “unrolling,” or “unfolding,”\r\nderived probably from the way in which leaves and flowers are usually\r\nrolled up or crumpled up in the bud and grow into their perfect form\r\nby unrolling or unfolding. Insects in the pupa and vertebrates in the\r\nembryo exhibit a somewhat similar condition of folding, and the word\r\nis therefore very applicable to an extensive range of phenomena; but\r\nit must not be taken as universally applicable, since in the material\r\nworld there are other modes of orderly change under natural laws to\r\nwhich the terms development or evolution are equally applicable. The\r\n“continuity” of physical phenomena, as illustrated by the late Sir\r\nWilliam Grove in 1866, has the same general meaning, but evolution\r\nimplies more than mere continuity or succession—something like growth\r\nor definite change from form to form under the action of unchangeable\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe point to be especially noted here is, that evolution, even if it\r\nis essentially a true and complete theory of the universe, can only\r\nexplain the existing conditions of nature by showing that it has been\r\nderived from some pre-existing condition through the action of known\r\nforces and laws. It may also show the high probability of a similar\r\nderivation from a still earlier condition; but the further back we\r\ngo the more uncertain must be our conclusions, while we can never\r\nmake any real approach to the absolute beginnings of things. Herbert\r\nSpencer, and many other thinkers before him, have shown that if we\r\ntry to realize the absolute nature of the simplest phenomena, we are\r\ninevitably landed either in a contradiction or in some unthinkable\r\nproposition. Thus, suppose we ask, Is matter infinitely divisible, or\r\nis it not? If we say it is, we cannot think it out, since all infinity,\r\nhowever it may be stated in words, is really unthinkable.\r\n\r\nIf we say there is a limit—the ultimate atom—then, as all size is\r\ncomparative, we can imagine a being to whom this atom seems as large\r\nas an apple or even a house does to us; and we then find it quite\r\nunthinkable that this mass of matter should be in its nature absolutely\r\nindivisible even by an infinite force. It follows that all explanations\r\nof phenomena can only be partial explanations. They can inform us of\r\nthe last change or the last series of changes which brought about the\r\nactual conditions now existing, and they can often enable us to predict\r\nfuture changes to a limited extent; but both the infinite past and the\r\nremote future are alike beyond our powers. Yet the explanations that\r\nthe theory of evolution gives us are none the less real and none the\r\nless important, especially when we compare its teachings with the wild\r\nguesses or the total ignorance of the thinkers of earlier ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIf we trace, however briefly, the gradual development of knowledge and\r\nspeculation on this subject, we shall perhaps appreciate more fully the\r\nadvance we have really made during the present century.\r\n\r\nThe first speculations on the nature and source of the phenomena of the\r\nuniverse, of which we have any knowledge, are those of the early Greek\r\nphilosophers, such as Thales, Anaximander, Anaxagoras, and Empedocles;\r\nbut as the more important of their teachings are embodied, with some\r\napproach to system and with much acuteness of reasoning, in the great\r\npoem of the Latin author Lucretius, “On the Nature of Things,” it will\r\nbe sufficient to give a sketch of his main conclusions, making use\r\nof the excellent prose translation by Mr. H. A. J. Munro, of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nLucretius had a very clear idea of the indestructibility of matter.\r\nHe argues that things cannot have come out of nothing, and he says:\r\n“A thing never returns to nothing, but all things, after disruption,\r\ngo back into the first bodies of matter.” He then argues that, as\r\nthe actual processes of growth, decay, and other natural changes are\r\nimperceptible to us, therefore “Nature works by unseen bodies.” He\r\njustly claims great importance for the demonstration of the fact that\r\nin all matter whatever, however solid and hard it may be, there are\r\nvacancies, or, as he expresses it, “Mixed up in all things there is\r\nvoid or empty space.” He thus anticipated the modern doctrine that the\r\nmolecules of matter do not come into actual contact. He then defines\r\natoms thus: “First bodies are solid and without void”; and as nothing\r\ncan be produced from nothing, he concludes that these first bodies\r\n(atoms or molecules) must be everlasting, and that they supply matter\r\nfor the reproduction of all things.\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to prove that these “first beginnings are of solid\r\nsingleness, not formed of parts, but strong in everlasting singleness.”\r\nHe further proves that these “first beginnings” (atoms) cannot be\r\ninfinitely small, and also that the universe cannot be limited—that\r\nit is infinite. He thus anticipated the main ideas as to atoms and the\r\nuniverse which have been held by most materialistic thinkers down to\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nLucretius was an absolute materialist, for though he did not deny the\r\nexistence of the gods he refused them any share in the construction of\r\nthe universe, which, he again and again urges, arose by chance, after\r\ninfinite time, by the random motions and collisions and entanglements\r\nof the infinity of atoms. He assumes some forces analogous to\r\ngravitation and the molecular motions of gases in the following\r\npassage: “For the first beginnings of things move first of themselves;\r\nnext these bodies which form a small aggregate and come nearest, so\r\nto say, to the powers of the first beginnings are impelled and set in\r\nmovement by the unseen strokes of these first bodies, and they next in\r\nturn stir up other bodies which are a little larger.”\r\n\r\nHe also anticipated Galileo as to the equal speed of all falling bodies\r\nwhen not checked by the air in the following precise statement: “For\r\nwhenever bodies fall through water and thin air they must quicken their\r\ndescents in proportion to their weights, because the body of water and\r\nsubtle nature of air cannot retard everything to an equal degree; on\r\nthe other hand, empty void cannot offer resistance to anything in any\r\ndirection at any time, but must continually give way; and for this\r\nreason all things must be moved and borne along with equal velocity,\r\nthough of unequal weights, through the unresisting void.”\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully accurate general statement of the equal rate\r\nof motion of all kinds of matter under the same forces; and when we\r\nconsider that there is no indication of any experimental basis for this\r\nconclusion, and that nothing equivalent to our sciences of physics or\r\nchemistry existed, we are amazed at the general correctness of many\r\nof his views, derived solely by a process of reasoning from the most\r\nobvious phenomena of nature. He argues that, given infinite matter and\r\nspace and inherent motion, “things must go on and be completed,” and\r\nhis general conclusion is thus expressed: “If you will apprehend and\r\nkeep in mind these things, nature, free at once and rid of her haughty\r\nlords, is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without the\r\nmeddling of the gods.”\r\n\r\nIt is when he attempts to deal with the origin of living organisms\r\nthat the absence of all knowledge of chemistry, physiology, and\r\nhistology renders his task impossible and leads him into what seem to\r\nus the wildest absurdities. He has an elaborate but very unconvincing\r\nargument that sensation can arise out of atoms which have no sensation;\r\nand, taking the appearance of worms, etc., in the earth and in putrid\r\nmatter as a proof that they are still actually produced _de novo_ in\r\nit, he argues that at some remote epoch the now worn-out earth was more\r\nfertile, and produced in like manner all kinds of animals. The first\r\nhuman infants he supposes to have been formed at some very remote time\r\nin the manner following: “For much heat and moisture would then abound\r\nin the fields; and therefore wherever a suitable spot offered wombs\r\nwould grow, attached to the earth by roots; and when the warmth of the\r\ninfants, flying the wet and craving the air, had opened these in the\r\nfulness of time, nature would turn to that spot the pores of the earth\r\nand constrain it to yield from its opened veins a liquid most like to\r\nmilk. To the children the earth would furnish food, the heat raiment,\r\nthe grass a bed rich in abundance of soft down.... Wherefore, again and\r\nagain I say, the earth, with good title, has gotten and keeps the name\r\nof mother, since she of herself gave birth to mankind, and at a time\r\nnearly fixed shed forth every beast that ranges wildly over the great\r\nmountains, and at the same time the fowls of the air with all their\r\nvaried shapes.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that this mode of origin commended itself to one of the\r\nbrightest intellects of the first century B. C., enlightened by the\r\nbest thought of the Grecian philosophers, may enable us the better to\r\nappreciate the immense advance made by modern evolutionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST REAL STEPS TOWARDS EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nWe have now a great blank of fifteen centuries—the dark ages of human\r\nprogress—after which the era of observation and experiment began, and\r\nfor the first time men really set themselves to study nature, thus\r\nlaying the foundation for all the great theoretical advances of our\r\ntime. As leading to the next great step in theories of evolution, we\r\nmust note the life-long observations by Tycho Brahe of the apparent\r\nmotions of the planets; the grand discovery of Kepler that all these\r\napparently erratic motions were due to their revolution round the sun\r\nin elliptic orbits, with a fixed relation between their distance from\r\nthe sun and their periods of revolution; and Newton’s epoch-making\r\ntheory of universal gravitation by which all these facts and many\r\nothers since discovered were harmonized and explained.\r\n\r\nBut all this implied no law of development, and it was long thought\r\nthat the solar system was fixed and unchangeable—that some altogether\r\nunknown or miraculous agency must have set it going, and that it had in\r\nitself no principle of change or decay, but might continue as it now is\r\nto all eternity. It was at the very end of the eighteenth century that\r\nLaplace announced his “Nebular Hypothesis,” the first attempt ever made\r\nto explain the origin of the solar system under the influence of the\r\nknown laws of motion, gravitation, and heat, acting upon an altogether\r\ndifferent antecedent condition of things—a true process of evolution.\r\n\r\nLaplace supposed that the whole matter of the solar system was once in\r\na condition of vapor, and that it formed an enormous nebulous mass many\r\ntimes larger than the then known dimensions of the planetary sphere.\r\nHe showed how, under the influence of gravitation, this nebula would\r\ncondense, and that such irregularities of motion and density as would\r\nbe sure to exist would lead to rotation of the mass. Under the law of\r\ngravitation this would lead to outer rings being left behind by the\r\ncontraction of the central mass, which rings would at a later period\r\nbecome drawn together at some point of initial greater density and\r\nthus form planets. The whole process is admitted to be mathematically\r\ndemonstrable, given the initial conditions; but recent extensions\r\nof our knowledge of the interplanetary and interstellar spaces have\r\nshown that the supposed void is really full of invisible solid matter,\r\nranging from the bulk of the smaller planets down to the finest dust,\r\nand it is very difficult to imagine any possible causes which would\r\nkeep all the solid matter of the system in a state of vapor, when\r\nsubject, on the confines of the mass, to the cold of interstellar\r\nspace. The antecedent condition of our system is now thought to have\r\nbeen either wholly or partially meteoritic, but in either case we have\r\na genuine theory of its evolution which has now been so extended as\r\nto include the appearance of comets and meteors, of nebulæ, and star\r\nclusters, of temporary, periodic, and colored stars, and many other\r\nphenomena of the stellar universe. It is no objection to these grand\r\ntheories to urge that they do not explain the origin of the matter of\r\nthe universe, either what it is or how it came to be where we now find\r\nit. We can only take one step at a time, and even if in these greater\r\nproblems any further advance should be as yet denied us, it is still\r\na great thing to have been able to take even one secure step into the\r\nvast and mysterious depths of the interstellar spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF THE EARTH’S CRUST\r\n\r\nAlthough Pythagoras (500 B. C.) believed that sea and land must often\r\nhave changed places, and a few other observers at different epochs came\r\nto the same conclusion, yet, till quite recent times, the earth was\r\ngenerally supposed to have been always very much as it is now; people\r\nspoke of “the eternal hills”; and the great mountain ranges, the mighty\r\nravines and precipices, as well as the deep seas and oceans, were\r\nbelieved to be the direct work of the Creator.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the latter half of the eighteenth century that a few\r\nobservers began to see the importance of studying the nature of the\r\nearth’s crust, so far as it could be reached in ravines, quarries, and\r\nmines; and one of the most earnest of these students, Dr. Hutton, of\r\nEdinburgh, after more than thirty years of travel and study, published\r\nhis great work, _The Theory of the Earth_, which must be considered to\r\nbe the starting-point of modern geology. He maintained that it was only\r\nby observing causes now in action that we can explain the phenomena\r\npresented by the stratified and igneous rocks; he showed that the\r\nformer must have been laid down by water, and that the larger part of\r\nthem, containing as they do marine shells and other fossils, must have\r\nbeen deposited on the sea-bottom. He showed how rain and rivers, frost\r\nand snow, wind and heat disintegrated the hardest rocks and would in\r\ntime excavate the deepest valleys; while earthquakes, however small\r\nan elevation any one of them might produce, would in time raise the\r\nsea-bottom sufficiently high to form, when denuded, mountain ranges,\r\nplains, and valleys like those we now see everywhere upon the earth’s\r\nsurface. He also showed that the most ancient stratified rocks, those\r\nthat lie at the very base of the series, presented every indication of\r\nhaving been formed in exactly the same way as the most recent ones.\r\nHence he stated a conclusion which excited a storm of opposition, in\r\nthese words: “In the economy of the world I can find no traces of a\r\nbeginning, no prospect of an end.” This was thought to imply a denial\r\nof creation, and was quite sufficient at that period to prevent the\r\nwork of any man of science from being judged impartially.\r\n\r\nBut although Playfair and a few others upheld Hutton’s views, they\r\nwere too novel to receive much support by his contemporaries, and this\r\nwas especially the case as regards the slow and continuous action\r\nof existing causes being sufficient to account for all the known\r\nphenomena presented by the crust of the earth. Hence the belief in\r\ncatastrophes and cataclysms—in great convulsions tearing mountains\r\nasunder, and vast floods sweeping over whole continents—continued to\r\nprevail, till finally banished by the genius and perseverance of one\r\nman, Sir Charles Lyell. His _Principles of Geology_ was first published\r\nin 1830, and successive editions, revised and often greatly extended,\r\ncontinued to appear till the author’s death, forty-five years later. As\r\nthis work affords a fine example of the application of the principles\r\nof evolution to the later phases of the earth’s history, and as it not\r\nonly revolutionized scientific opinion in its own domain, but prepared\r\nthe way for the acceptance of the still more novel and startling\r\napplication of the same principles to the entire organic world, it\r\nwill be necessary to show what opinions prevailed at the time it first\r\nappeared in order that we may understand how great was the change it\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the nineteenth century the standard geological\r\nwork, both in Great Britain and on the Continent, was Cuvier’s _Essay\r\non the Theory of the Earth_. In 1827 a fifth edition of the English\r\ntranslation appeared, and there was a German translation so late as\r\n1830—sufficient proofs of its wide popularity. Yet this work abounds\r\nin statements which are positively ludicrous to any one conversant\r\nwith modern geology. It never appeals to known causes, but again and\r\nagain assumes forces to be at work for which no evidence is adduced and\r\nwhich are totally at variance with what we see in the world to-day. A\r\nfew examples justifying these statements must be here given. Cuvier\r\nshows that he was acquainted with the theory of modern causes, but he\r\naltogether rejects it, saying that “the march of nature is changed,\r\nand none of the agents she now employs would have been sufficient\r\nfor the production of her ancient works.” He adduces “the primitive\r\nmountains” whose “sharp and bristling ridges and peaks are indications\r\nof the violent manner in which they have been elevated.” He allows\r\nthat atmospheric agencies may form sea-cliffs, alluvial deposits, and\r\ntaluses of loose matter at the foot of the precipices, but he adds:\r\n“These are but limited effects to which vegetation in general puts\r\na stop, and which, besides, presuppose the existence of mountains,\r\nvalleys, and plains—in short, all the inequalities of the globe—and\r\nwhich, therefore, cannot have given rise to those inequalities.” He\r\ncontrasts the calm and peaceful aspect of the surface of the earth\r\nwith the appearances discovered when we examine its interior. Here, in\r\nthe raised beds of shells, the fractured rocks, the inclined or even\r\nvertical stratification, he finds abundant proofs “that the surface of\r\nthe globe has been broken up by revolutions and catastrophes.”\r\n\r\nHe also refers to the numerous large blocks of the primitive rocks\r\nscattered over the surface of secondary formations, and separated by\r\ndeep valleys or even by arms of the sea from the peaks or ridges from\r\nwhich they must have been derived, as further proofs of catastrophes;\r\nfor, it is argued, they must have been either ejected by volcanic\r\neruptions or carried by waters, which, in either case, “must have\r\nexceeded in violence anything we can imagine at the present day,” and\r\nhe therefore concludes that “it is in vain we search among the powers\r\nwhich now act upon the surface of the earth for causes sufficient to\r\nproduce the revolutions and catastrophes, the traces of which are\r\nexhibited in its crust.” He is quite confident that all these changes\r\ngo on rapidly, periods of catastrophe alternating with periods of\r\nrepose. The present surface of the earth he holds to be quite recent,\r\nand he maintains “that, if anything in geology be established, it\r\nis that the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden\r\nrevolution, the date of which cannot be referred to a much earlier\r\nperiod than five or six thousand years ago; that this revolution\r\noverwhelmed and caused to disappear the countries which were previously\r\ninhabited by man, and the species of animals now best known; that, on\r\nthe other hand, it laid dry the bottom of the last sea, and formed\r\nof it the countries which are at the present day inhabited.” And he\r\nfurther declares that “this event has been sudden, instantaneous,\r\nwithout any gradation; and what is so clearly demonstrated with respect\r\nto this last catastrophe is not less so with reference to those which\r\npreceded it.”\r\n\r\nThe method followed by Lyell was the very reverse of that of Cuvier.\r\nInstead of assuming hastily that modern causes were totally inadequate,\r\nand appealing constantly to purely imaginary and often inconceivable\r\ncatastrophes, Lyell investigated these causes with painstaking\r\naccuracy, applying the tests of survey and time measurement, so as in\r\nmany cases to prove that, given moderately long periods of time—not\r\na few thousands only, but hundreds of thousands of years—they were\r\nfully adequate to explain the phenomena. He also showed that the\r\nimaginary causes of Cuvier would not explain the facts, for that\r\neverywhere in the crust of the earth we found conclusive proofs of very\r\nslow continuous changes exactly analogous to what now occur, never\r\nof great convulsions, except quite locally, as we have them now. He\r\nshowed that modern volcanoes had poured out vast masses of melted rock\r\nduring a single eruption, covering areas as extensive as those which\r\nany ancient volcano could be proved to have ejected in an equally\r\nshort period; that strata were now in process of formation comparable\r\nin extent and thickness with any ancient strata; that organic remains\r\nare being preserved in them just as in the older rocks; that the land\r\nis almost everywhere rising or sinking as of old; that valleys are\r\nbeing excavated and plateaus or mountains upheaved; that earthquake\r\nshocks are producing faults beneath the surface; that vegetation is\r\nstill preparing future coal beds; that limestones, clays, sandstones,\r\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks are all still being formed; and that,\r\ngiven time, and the intermittent or continuous action of the causes we\r\ncan now trace in operation, and all the varied features of the earth’s\r\nsurface, as well as all the contortions and fractures which we discover\r\nin its crust, and every other phenomenon supposed to necessitate\r\ncatastrophes and cataclysms will be again produced.\r\n\r\nIn the massive volumes of the later editions of the _Principles of\r\nGeology_ all these points are discussed and illustrated with such a\r\nwealth of facts and such cogent yet cautious reasoning as have carried\r\nconviction to all modern students. It affords us perhaps the very best\r\nproof yet given of evolution in one department of the universe—that of\r\nthe surface and the crust of the earth we inhabit. Not only have all\r\nthe chief modifications during an almost unimaginable period of time\r\nbeen clearly depicted, but they have in almost every case been shown to\r\nbe the inevitable results of real and comparatively well-known causes,\r\nsuch as we now see at work around us.\r\n\r\nThe grand generalizations of Lyell have been strengthened since his\r\ndeath by more complete investigations of certain phenomena and their\r\ncauses than were possible in his day; while the only objections to them\r\nseem to be founded, to some extent, upon a misconception. He has been\r\ntermed a “Uniformitarian,” and it is alleged that it is unphilosophical\r\nto take the limited range of causes we now see in action, as a measure\r\nof those which have acted during all past geological time. But neither\r\nLyell nor his followers make any such assumption. They merely say, we\r\ndo not find any proof of greater or more violent causes in action in\r\npast times, and we do find many indications that the great natural\r\nforces then in action—seas and rivers, sun and cloud, rain and\r\nhail, frost and snow, as well as the very texture and constituents\r\nof the older rocks, and the mode in which the organisms of each age\r\nare preserved in them, must have been in their general nature and\r\nmagnitude very much as they are now. Other objections, such as that\r\nthe internal forces were greater when the earth was hotter, and that\r\ntidal effects must have been more powerful when the moon was nearer\r\nthe earth, are altogether beside the question until we can obtain\r\nmore definite measures of past time than we now possess in reference\r\nto both geological and cosmical phenomena. It may well be that the\r\nphysical changes above referred to have been so slow that they would\r\nhave produced no perceptibly increased effect at the epoch of the\r\nearly stratified rocks. Lyell’s doctrine is simply that of real\r\nagainst imaginary causes, and he only denies catastrophes and more\r\nviolent agencies in early times, because there is no clear evidence\r\nof their actual existence, and also because known causes are quite\r\ncompetent to explain all geological phenomena. It must be remembered,\r\ntoo, that uniformitarians have never limited the natural forces of\r\npast geological periods to the precise limits of which we have had\r\nexperience during the historical period. What they maintain is, that\r\nforces of the same _nature_ and of the same _order of magnitude_ are\r\nadequate to have brought about the evolution of the crust of the earth\r\nas we now find it.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC EVOLUTION, ITS LAWS AND CAUSES\r\n\r\nWe now come to that branch of the subject which is the most important\r\nand distinctive of our age, and which, in popular estimation, alone\r\nconstitutes evolution—the mode of origin of the innumerable species of\r\nanimal and plant life which now exist or have ever existed upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the different forms of life has till quite recent times\r\nbeen looked upon as an almost insoluble problem, although a few\r\nadvanced thinkers, even in the eighteenth century, perceived that it\r\nwas probably the result of some natural process of modification or\r\nevolution; but no force or law had been set forth and established\r\nin any way adequate to produce it until the publication of Darwin’s\r\n_Origin of Species_, in 1859. In the later editions of that work,\r\nDarwin has given a historical sketch of the progress of opinion on the\r\nsubject. I shall, therefore, now only notice a few great writers which\r\nhe has not referred to.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what an impossible and even ludicrous explanation had\r\nto be given by Lucretius; and from his day down to the middle of the\r\neighteenth century no advance had been made. Either the problem was\r\nnot referred to at all, or the theological doctrine of a special\r\ncreation was held to be the only possible one. But in the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century the great French naturalist, Buffon, published\r\nhis very important work, _Histoire Naturelle_, in fifteen volumes\r\n(1749–1767), in which, besides describing the characters and habits\r\nof all the animals then known, he introduced much philosophical and\r\nspeculative thought, which would probably have been carried much\r\nfurther had he not felt obliged to conform to the religious prejudices\r\nof the age. We are indebted to Mr. Samuel Butler for having brought\r\ntogether all the important passages of Buffon’s voluminous and now\r\nlittle-read works bearing upon the question of evolution, and it is\r\nfrom his volume that I quote.\r\n\r\nBuffon lays stress on the great resemblance of all mammalia in internal\r\nstructure, showing that the most unlike creatures may be really alike\r\nstructurally. He says: “The horse, for example—what can at first\r\nsight seem more unlike mankind? Yet when we compare man and horse,\r\npoint by point and detail by detail, our wonder is excited rather by\r\nthe resemblances than by the differences between them.” He then shows\r\nthat all the parts of the skeleton agree, and that it is only in\r\nproportions, the increase of some bones and the suppression of others,\r\nthat they differ, adding: “If we regard the matter thus, not only the\r\nass and the horse, but even man himself, the apes, etc., might be\r\nregarded as forming members of one and the same family.” Then, after a\r\nfew more illustrations, he remarks: “If we once admit that there are\r\nfamilies of plants and animals, so that the ass may be of the family\r\nof the horse, and that the one may only differ from the other by\r\ndegeneration from a common ancestor, we might be driven to admit that\r\nthe ape is of the family of man, that he is but a degenerate man, and\r\nthat he and man have had a common ancestor.... If it were once shown\r\nthat we had right grounds for establishing these families, if the point\r\nwere once gained that among plants and animals there have been even a\r\nsingle species which had been produced in the course of direct descent\r\nfrom another species, then there is no further limit to be set to the\r\npower of nature, and we should not be wrong in supposing that with\r\nsufficient time she could have evolved all other organized forms from\r\none primordial type.”\r\n\r\nThis indicates clearly enough his own opinion, but to save himself from\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities he at once adds this saving clause: “But\r\nno! It is certain, from revelation, that all animals have alike been\r\nfavored with the grace of an act of direct creation, and that the first\r\npair of every species issued full formed from the hands of the Creator.”\r\n\r\nSuch examples of disarming religious prejudice are frequent, but he\r\ncontinually recurs to statements as to mutability which neutralize\r\nthem. Here, for example, is a broad claim for nature as opposed to\r\ncreation. He has been showing how variable are many animals, and how\r\nchanges of food, climate, and general surroundings influence both their\r\nforms and their habits; and then he exclaims:\r\n\r\n“What cannot nature effect with such means at her disposal? She can do\r\nall except either create matter or destroy it. These two extremes of\r\npower the Deity has reserved for Himself only; creation and destruction\r\nare the action of His omnipotence. To alter and undo, to develop and\r\nrenew—these are powers which He has handed over to the charge of\r\nnature.”\r\n\r\nHere we have a claim for the power of nature in the modification of\r\nspecies which fully comes up to the requirements of the most advanced\r\nevolutionist. It is remarkable, too, how clearly he perceived the\r\ngreat factors so important for the evolution of organisms, rapid\r\nmultiplication, great variability, and the struggle for existence.\r\nThus he remarks: “It may be said that the movement of nature turns\r\nupon two immovable pivots—one, the illimitable fecundity which she\r\nhas given to all species; the other, the innumerable difficulties\r\nwhich reduce the results of that fecundity and leave throughout time\r\nnearly the same quantity of individuals in every species.” Here the\r\nterm “difficulties” corresponds to the “positive checks” of Malthus,\r\nand to the “struggle for existence” of Darwin; and he again and again\r\nrefers to variability—as when he says: “Hence, when by some chance,\r\ncommon enough with nature, a variation or special feature makes its\r\nappearance, man has tried to perpetuate it by uniting together the\r\nindividuals in which it has appeared.”\r\n\r\nAs Buffon thus clearly understood artificial selection, thoroughly\r\nappreciated the rapid increase of all organisms, and equally well saw\r\nthat their inordinate increase was wholly neutralized through such\r\ndestructive agencies as hunger, disease, and enemies, and as, at the\r\nsame time, he had such unbounded faith in the power of nature to modify\r\nanimal and vegetable forms, we feel assured that this great writer and\r\noriginal thinker only needed freedom to pursue this train of thought a\r\nlittle further and he would certainly have anticipated Darwin’s great\r\ndiscovery of natural selection by a whole century. Even as it is we\r\nmust class him as one of the great pioneers of organic evolution.\r\n\r\nThe next distinct step towards a theory of organic evolution was made\r\nby the poet Goethe at the very end of the eighteenth century, in his\r\nviews of the metamorphosis of plants. He pointed out the successive\r\nmodifications of the leaf which produced all the other essential parts\r\nof the higher plants—the simple cotyledons or seed leaves became\r\nmodified into the variously formed leaves of the fully grown plants;\r\nthese again were successively modified into the calyx, corolla,\r\nstamens, and ovary of the flower. He supposed this to be due to the\r\nincreased refinement of the sap under the influence of light and air,\r\nand to indicate the steps by which the various parts of the flower\r\nhad been developed. It was, therefore, a theory of evolution; but it\r\nwas very unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it in no way accounted for the\r\nwonderful variety of the floral organs, or indicated any purpose served\r\nby the most prominent and conspicuous part of the flower, the highly\r\ncolored and often strangely formed corolla. It was also erroneous in\r\nsupposing that the corolla was a modified calyx, whereas it is now\r\nknown to be a modification of the stamens.\r\n\r\nNext came the great work of Lamarck in the first decade of the\r\nnineteenth century, in which he proposed a general system of\r\nevolution of the whole animal world. Hence he may be termed the\r\nfirst systematic evolutionist. His system has been rather fully\r\ndescribed by Lyell, who, in his _Principles of Geology_, devotes\r\na whole chapter to a summary of his doctrines; while Mr. Butler\r\ngives copious quotations in three chapters of his _Evolution Old and\r\nNew_; and any one who is not acquainted with the original work of\r\nLamarck should read these two authors in order to understand how wide\r\nwas his knowledge, how ingenious his explanations, and in how many\r\nimportant points he anticipated the views both of Lyell and Darwin.\r\nBut he was half a century in advance of his age, and his only alleged\r\ncauses of modification—changed conditions, use and disuse, habit\r\nand effort—were wholly insufficient to account for the vast range\r\nof the phenomena presented by the innumerable minute adaptations of\r\nliving organisms to their conditions of life. He even imputed all the\r\nmodifications of domestic animals to the changed conditions of food and\r\nhabits to which they have been subjected by man, making no reference to\r\nthe use of selection by breeders, in this respect falling short of his\r\ngreat predecessor, Buffon.\r\n\r\nThe general laws which Lamarck deduces from his elaborate study of\r\nnature are these:\r\n\r\n“Firstly. That in every animal which has not passed its limit of\r\ndevelopment, the more frequent and sustained employment of any organ\r\ndevelops and aggrandizes it, giving it a power proportionate to the\r\nduration of its employment, while the same organ, in default of\r\nconstant use, becomes insensibly weakened and deteriorated, decreasing\r\nimperceptibly in power until it finally disappears.\r\n\r\n“Secondly. That these gains or losses of organic development, due to\r\nuse or disuse, are transmitted to offspring, provided they have been\r\ncommon to both sexes, or to the animals from which the offspring have\r\ndescended.”\r\n\r\nThe whole force of this argument depends upon the second clause—the\r\ninheritance of those individual modifications due to use and disuse.\r\nBut no direct evidence of this has ever been found, while there is\r\na good deal of evidence showing that it does not occur. Again, there\r\nare many structures which cannot have been produced by use, such, for\r\nexample, as the feathers of the peacock’s train, the poison in the\r\nserpent’s fangs, the hard shells of nuts, the prickly covering of many\r\nfruits, the varied armor of the turtle, porcupine, crocodile, and many\r\nothers. For these reasons Lamarck’s views gained few converts; and\r\nalthough some of his arguments have been upheld in recent years, the\r\nfatal objections to his general principle as a means of explaining the\r\nevolution of organic forms has never been overcome.\r\n\r\nBetween the periods of Lamarck and Darwin many advances were made\r\nwhich clearly pointed to a general law of evolution in nature. Such\r\nwere Sir William Grove’s lectures on the “Correlation of the Physical\r\nForces,” in 1842; Helmholtz on the “Conservation of Energy,” in 1847;\r\nand Herbert Spencer’s essay on “The Development Hypothesis,” in 1852.\r\nThis latter work was a complete and almost unanswerable argument for a\r\nnatural process of continuous evolution of the whole visible universe,\r\nincluding organic nature, man, and social phenomena. It is further\r\nextended in the later editions of the author’s _First Principles_,\r\nwhich, as a coherent exposition of philosophy, co-ordinating and\r\nexplaining all human knowledge of the universe into one great system of\r\nevolution everywhere conforming to the same general principles, must\r\nbe held to be one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the\r\nnineteenth century. It left, however, the exact method of evolution\r\nof organisms untouched, and thus failed to account for those complex\r\nadaptations and appearances of design in the various species of animals\r\nand plants which have always been the stronghold of those who advocated\r\nspecial creation. This difficulty was met by Darwin’s theory of _The\r\nOrigin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_, published in 1859,\r\nand the series of works that succeeded it; and to a brief sketch of\r\nthis theory the remainder of our space must be devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF “NATURAL SELECTION”\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have seen, a succession of great writers and thinkers\r\nhad for more than half a century shown the necessity for some process\r\nof evolution as the only rational or intelligible mode of origin\r\nof existing species of animals and plants, as well as of the whole\r\nphysical universe, yet these views were by no means generally accepted\r\nby the educated classes, while few bodies of students were less\r\ninfluenced by them than zoologists and botanists, generally known as\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nNow, Darwin wrote especially for these classes, and no one knew better\r\nthan he did their great prejudice on this matter. Not only had such\r\nmen as Sir Charles Lyell and Sir John Herschel expressed themselves\r\nstrongly against all theories of the transmutation of species, but\r\nthe universal contempt and indignation of naturalists as well as\r\ntheologians against _The Vestiges of Creation_, published anonymously\r\na few years earlier, and giving a most temperate and even religious\r\nexposition of the general arguments for the universality of evolution,\r\nshowed what any one might expect who advocated and attempted to\r\ndemonstrate a similar theory. This accounts for Darwin writing to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, in 1844, of his being “almost convinced that species are\r\nnot (it is like confessing a murder) immutable,” and again, in 1845, to\r\nthe Rev. L. Blomefield, that he now saw the way in which new varieties\r\nbecome exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life and to\r\nother surrounding beings, and he adds: “I am a bold man to lay myself\r\nopen to being thought a complete fool, and a most deliberate one.”\r\nIt is only by a consideration of the frame of mind of even advanced\r\nthinkers at the time Darwin was preparing his work, and remembering\r\nhow small was the effect which had been produced by Buffon, Goethe,\r\nLamarck, the author of _Vestiges of Creation_, and the earlier writings\r\nof Herbert Spencer, that we can adequately realize the marvellous work\r\nthat he accomplished. Let us now briefly consider the essential nature\r\nof this new theory, which in a few brief years became the established\r\nbelief of the great majority of the students of nature, and which also\r\ngave a new interest in nature to the whole thinking world.\r\n\r\nThe theory of natural selection is founded upon a few groups of\r\nthoroughly ascertained and universally admitted facts, with the direct\r\nand necessary results of those facts.\r\n\r\nThe first group of facts consists of the great powers of increase\r\nof all organisms and the circumstance that, notwithstanding this\r\ngreat yearly increase, the actual population of each species remains\r\nstationary, there being no permanent increase. Now, these two facts\r\nwere recognized by Buffon, but though, of course, known to all\r\nsubsequent writers, were fully appreciated or thought out to their\r\nlogical results by none of them. Lamarck, so far as I can ascertain,\r\ntook no notice of them whatever. Darwin has given illustrations of\r\nthese facts in Chapter IV. of the _Origin of Species_, and I have added\r\nothers in the second chapter of my _Darwinism_. That the population\r\nof each species remains stationary, with, of course, considerable\r\nfluctuations, is both a matter of observation and of reasoning. The\r\npowers of increase of all creatures are so great that if there is in\r\nany country room and food for a larger number of any species they will\r\nbe produced in a year or two. It is impossible, therefore, to believe\r\nthat, in a state of nature, where all kinds of animals and plants have\r\nlived together as they best could for thousands of years, there can be\r\nany important difference in their numbers from year to year or from\r\ncentury to century.\r\n\r\nNow, it is as a consequence of these two indisputable facts that the\r\nstruggle for existence necessarily results. For if every year each pair\r\nof animals or each plant produces only ten young animals or plants,\r\nand this is very far below the average, and if the adult life of these\r\nis taken at ten years, again below the average of the higher plants\r\nand animals, then, unless some of the parents die, the whole of the\r\noffspring must die off every year; or, in other words, only as many\r\nyoung can survive as are necessary to replace the old ones that die.\r\nHence the deaths must always (on the average and in the long run) equal\r\nthe births. This terrible yearly destruction is an absolutely certain\r\nfact, as well as an inevitable result of the two preceding facts, and\r\nit is said to be due to the struggle for existence. This struggle\r\nis manifold in its nature. Individuals of the same species struggle\r\ntogether for food, for light, for moisture; they struggle also against\r\nother species having the same wants; they struggle against every kind\r\nof enemy, from parasitic worms and insects up to carnivorous animals;\r\nand there is a continual struggle with the forces of nature—frosts,\r\nrains, droughts, floods, and tempests.\r\n\r\nThese varied causes of destruction may be seen constantly at work\r\nby any one who looks for them. They act from the moment of birth,\r\nbeing more especially destructive to the young; and, as only one in\r\nten or fifty or a thousand (according to the rate of increase of\r\nthe particular species) can possibly come to the full breeding age,\r\nwe feel compelled to ask ourselves: What determines the nine or the\r\nforty-nine or the nine hundred and ninety-nine, as the case may be,\r\nwhich die, and the one which survives? Darwin calls this process of\r\nextermination one of “natural selection”—that is, by this process\r\nnature weeds out the weak, the unhealthy, the unadapted, the imperfect\r\nin any way. Of course, what may be called chance or accident produces\r\nmany deaths of individuals otherwise well fitted to live, but if we\r\nthink of the process going on day by day and year by year till only\r\none in a hundred of those born in a given area are left alive, it is\r\nimpossible to suppose that the _one_ which has passed through all\r\nthe dangers and risks which have been fatal to, say, his ninety-nine\r\nrelations was not, in all the faculties and qualities essential to the\r\ncontinuance of the race, decidedly better organized than the bulk of\r\nthose which succumbed. Herbert Spencer calls the process the “survival\r\nof the fittest,” and though the term may not be strictly accurate in\r\nthe case of any one species in any one year, yet when we consider that\r\nthe struggle is going on _every_ year, during the whole duration of\r\neach species, we cannot doubt that, on the whole, and in the long run,\r\nthose which survive are among the fittest. The struggle is so severe,\r\nso incessant, that the smallest defect in any sense organ, any physical\r\nweakness, any imperfection in constitution, will almost certainly, at\r\none time or another, be fatal.\r\n\r\nThis continual weeding out of the less fit, in every generation, and\r\nwith exceptional severity in recurring adverse seasons, will produce\r\ntwo distinct effects, which require to be clearly distinguished. The\r\nfirst is the preservation of each species in the highest state of\r\nadaptation to the conditions of its existence; and, therefore, so\r\nlong as these conditions remained unchanged, the effect of natural\r\nselection is to keep each well-adapted species also unchanged. The\r\nsecond effect is produced whenever the conditions vary, when, taking\r\nadvantage of the variations continually occurring in all well-adapted\r\nand therefore populous species, the same process will slowly but surely\r\nbring about complete adaptation to the new conditions. And here another\r\nfact—the normal variability of all populous or dominant species, which\r\nis seldom realized except by those who have largely and minutely\r\ncompared the individuals of many species in a state of nature—comes\r\ninto play. There are some writers who admit all the preceding facts\r\nand reasoning, so far as the action of natural selection in weeding\r\nout the unfit and thus keeping every species in the highest state of\r\nefficiency is concerned, but who deny that it can modify them in such a\r\nway as to adapt them to new conditions, because they allege that “the\r\nright variations will not always occur at the right time.” This seems\r\na strong and real objection to many of their readers, but to those\r\nwho have studied the variability of species in nature, it is a mere\r\nverbal difficulty dependent on ignorance of the actual facts. A brief\r\nstatement of the facts must therefore be given.\r\n\r\nOf late years, and chiefly since Darwin’s works were written, the\r\nvariability of animals and plants in a state of nature has been\r\ncarefully studied, by actual comparison and measurement of scores,\r\nhundreds, and even thousands of individuals of many common, that is,\r\nabundant and widely distributed species; and it is found that in almost\r\nevery case they vary greatly, and, what is still more important, that\r\nevery organ and every appendage varies independently and to a large\r\namount. Some of the best known of these facts of variation are adduced\r\nin my _Darwinism_, and are illustrated by numerous diagrams, and much\r\nmore extensive series have since been examined, always with the same\r\ngeneral result. By large variability is meant a variation of from ten\r\nto twenty-five per cent. on each side of the mean size, this amount\r\nof variation occurring in at least five or ten per cent. of the whole\r\nnumber of individuals, and in every organ or part as yet examined,\r\nexternal or internal.\r\n\r\nNow, as the weeding-out process is so severe, only from one in ten to\r\none in a hundred of those born surviving to produce young, the above\r\nproportion of variations affords ample scope for the selection of\r\nany variation needed in order to modify the species so as to bring it\r\ninto harmony with new or changing conditions. And this will be the\r\nmore easy and certain if we consider how slowly land-surfaces and\r\nclimates undergo permanent changes; and these are certainly the kind of\r\nchanges that initiate and compel alterations, first, perhaps, in the\r\ndistribution, and afterwards in the structure and habits of species.\r\nIt follows, therefore, as an absolutely necessary conclusion from the\r\nfacts, if natural selection can and does keep each continually varying\r\nspecies in close adaptation to an unchanging environment, that it\r\npreserves the fixity of its mean or average condition, and almost every\r\nobjector admits this. Then, given a slowly changing environment, the\r\nsame power must inevitably bring about whatever corresponding change is\r\nneeded for the well-being and permanent survival of the various species\r\nwhich are subjected to those changed conditions.\r\n\r\nI shall not add here a further consideration of the objections and\r\ndifficulties alleged by critics of the theory. All of these have,\r\nI believe, been fully answered either by Darwin or myself, many of\r\nthe most recent having been discussed in review articles. Suffice\r\nit to say here that this theory of natural selection—meaning the\r\nelimination of the least fit, and therefore the ultimate “survival of\r\nthe fittest”—has furnished a rational and precise explanation of the\r\nmeans of adaptation of all existing organisms to their conditions,\r\nand therefore of their transformation from the series of distinct but\r\nallied species which occupied the earth at some preceding epoch. In\r\nthis sense it has actually demonstrated the “origin of species,” and,\r\nby carrying back this process step by step into earlier and earlier\r\ngeological times, we are able mentally to follow out the evolution of\r\nall forms of life from one or a few primordial forms. Natural selection\r\nhas thus supplied that motive power of change and adaptation that was\r\nwanting in all earlier attempts at explanation, and this has led to its\r\nvery general acceptance both by naturalists and by the great majority\r\nof thinkers and men of science.\r\n\r\nThe brief sketch now given of the progress of human thought on the\r\nquestions of the fact and the mode of the evolution of the material\r\nuniverse indicates how great has been the progress during the\r\nnineteenth as compared with all preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nAlthough the philosophical writers of classical times obtained a few\r\nglimpses of the action of law in nature regulating its successive\r\nchanges, nothing satisfactory could be effected till the actual facts\r\nhad been better ascertained by the whole body of workers who, during\r\nthe last five centuries, have penetrated ever more and more deeply into\r\nnature’s mysteries and laws. By their labors we became possessed of\r\nsuch a body of carefully observed facts that, towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century, such thinkers as Laplace and Hutton were enabled\r\nto give us the first rudiments of theories of evolution as applied to\r\nthe solar system and the earth’s crust, both of which have been greatly\r\ndeveloped and rendered more secure during the century just passed away.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Buffon and Goethe may be said to have started the idea\r\nof organic evolution, more systematically treated a little later by\r\nLamarck, but still without any discovery of laws adequate to produce\r\nthe results we see everywhere in nature. The subject then languished,\r\ntill, after twenty years of observation and research, Charles Darwin\r\nproduced a work which at once satisfied many thinkers that the\r\nlong-desired clew had been discovered. Its acceptance by almost the\r\nwhole scientific world soon followed: it threw new light on almost\r\nevery branch of research, and it will probably take its place, in the\r\nopinion of future generations, as the crowning achievement of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n            ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of the science of chemistry forms one phase of the\r\nprogress of human thought. While at first mankind was contented to\r\nobserve certain phenomena, and to utilize them for industrial purposes,\r\nif they were found suitable, “philosophers,” as the thinking portion\r\nof our race loved to call themselves, have always attempted to assign\r\nsome explanation for observed facts, and to group them into similars\r\nand dissimilars. It was for long imagined, following the doctrines of\r\nthe Greeks and of their predecessors, that all matter consisted of four\r\nelements or principles, names which survive to this day in popular\r\nlanguage. These were “fire,” “air,” “water,” and “earth.” It was not\r\nuntil the seventeenth century that Boyle in his _Sceptical Chymist_\r\n(1661) laid the foundations of the modern science, by pointing out\r\nthat it was impossible to explain the existence of the fairly numerous\r\nchemical substances known in his day, or the changes which they can be\r\nmade to undergo, by means of the ancient Greek hypotheses regarding the\r\nconstitution of matter. He laid down the definition of the modern\r\nmeaning of the word “element”; he declined to accept the current view\r\nthat the properties of matter could be modified by its assimilating\r\nthe qualities of fire, air, earth, or water, and he defined an element\r\nas the _constituent_ of a compound body. The first problem, then, to be\r\nsolved, was to determine which of the numerous forms of matter were\r\nto be regarded as elementary, and which are compound, or composed of\r\ntwo or more elements in a state of combination; and to produce such\r\ncompounds by causing the appropriate elements to unite with each other.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects to excite curiosity and interest was the air\r\nwhich surrounds us, and in which we live and move and have our being.\r\nIt was, however, endowed with a semi-spiritual and scarcely corporeal\r\nnature in the ideas of our ancestors, for it does not affect the\r\nsenses of sight, smell, or taste, and though it can be felt, yet it\r\neludes our grasp. The word “gas,” moreover, was not invented until Van\r\nHelmont devised it to designate various kinds of “airs” which he had\r\nobserved. The important part which gases play in the constitution of\r\nmany chemical compounds was accordingly overlooked; and, indeed, it\r\nappeared to be almost as striking a feat of necromancy to produce a\r\nquantity of a gas of great volume from a small pinch of solid powder\r\nas for a “Jinn” of enormous stature but of delicate texture to issue\r\nfrom a brass pot, as related in the _Arabian Nights Entertainments_.\r\nGradually, however, it came to be recognized, not merely that gases\r\nhave corporeal existence, but that they even possess weight. This,\r\nthough foreshadowed by Torricelli, Jean Rey, and others, was first\r\nclearly proved by Black, professor of chemistry in Edinburgh, in 1752,\r\nthrough his masterly researches, as carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of the material nature of gases and of their weight\r\nlies at the bottom of the “Phlogistic Theory,” a theory devised by\r\nStahl about the year 1690, to account for the phenomena of combustion\r\nand respiration and the recovery or “reduction” of metals from their\r\n“earths” by heating with charcoal or allied bodies. According to\r\nthis inverted theory, a substance capable of burning was imagined\r\nto contain more or less phlogiston, a principle which it parted\r\nwith on burning, leaving an earth deprived of phlogiston, or\r\n“dephlogisticated,” behind if a metal. This earth, when heated with\r\nsubstances rich in phlogiston, such as coal, wood, flour, and similar\r\nbodies, recovered the phlogiston, which it had lost on burning, and,\r\nwith the added phlogiston, its metallic character. Other substances,\r\nsuch as phosphorus and sulphur, gave solids or acid liquids, to\r\nwhich phlogiston was not so easy to add; but even they could be\r\nrephlogisticated. On this hypothesis, it was the earths, and such acid\r\nliquids as sulphuric or phosphoric acids, which were the elements; the\r\nmetals and sulphur and phosphorus were their compounds with phlogiston.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of oxygen by Priestley and by Scheele in 1774, and\r\nthe explanation of its functions by Lavoisier during the following\r\nten years, gave their true meaning to these phenomena. It was then\r\nrecognized that combustion was union with oxygen; that an “earth” or\r\n“calx” was to be regarded as the compound of a metal with oxygen; that\r\nwhen a metal becomes tarnished, and converted into such an earthy\r\npowder, it is being oxidized; that this oxide, on ignition with\r\ncharcoal or carbon, or with compounds such as coal, flour, or wood,\r\nof which carbon is a constituent, gives up its oxygen to the carbon,\r\nforming an oxide of carbon, carbonic oxide on the one hand, or carbonic\r\n“acid” on the other, while the metal is reproduced in its “reguline”\r\nor metallic condition, and that the true elements are metals, carbon,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, and similar bodies, and not the products of their\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that air is in the main a mixture of nitrogen, an inert\r\ngas, and oxygen, an active one, together with a small proportion of\r\ncarbonic “acid” (or, as it is now termed, anhydride)—a discovery\r\nperfected by Rutherford, Black, and Cavendish—and that water is a\r\ncompound with oxygen of hydrogen, previously known as inflammable air,\r\nby Cavendish and by Watt, finally overthrew the theory of phlogiston;\r\nbut at the beginning of this century it still lingered on, and was\r\ndefended by Priestley until his death in 1804. Such, in brief, was\r\nthe condition of chemical thought in the year 1800. Scheele had died\r\nin 1786, at the early age of forty-four; Lavoisier was one of the\r\nvictims of the French Revolution, having been guillotined in 1794;\r\nCavendish had ceased to work at chemical problems, and was devoting his\r\nextraordinary abilities to physical problems of the highest importance,\r\nwhile living the life of an eccentric recluse, and Priestley, driven\r\nby religious persecution from England to the more tolerant shores of\r\nAmerica, was enjoying a peaceful old age, enlivened by occasional\r\nincursions into the region of sectarian controversy.\r\n\r\nThe first striking discovery of our century was that of the compound\r\nnature of the alkalies and of the alkaline earths. This discovery was\r\nmade by Humphry Davy. Born in Cornwall in 1778, he began the study of\r\nchemistry, self-taught, in 1796; and in 1799 he became director of\r\nthe “Pneumatic Institution,” an undertaking founded by Dr. Beddoes,\r\nat Bristol, for the purpose of experiments on the curative effects\r\nof gases in general. Here he at once made his mark by the discovery\r\nof the remarkable properties of “laughing gas,” or nitrous oxide. At\r\nthe same time he constructed a galvanic battery, and began to perform\r\nexperiments with it in attempting to decompose chemical compounds by\r\nits means. In 1801 Davy was appointed professor of chemistry at the\r\nRoyal Institution, a society or club which had been founded a few\r\nyears previously by Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, for the purpose\r\nof instructing and amusing its members with recent discoveries in\r\nchemistry and natural philosophy. In 1807 Davy applied his galvanic\r\nbattery to the decomposition of damp caustic potash and soda, using\r\nplatinum poles. He was rewarded by seeing globules of metal, resembling\r\nmercury in appearance, at the negative pole; and he subsequently proved\r\nthat these globules, when burned, reproduced the alkali from which\r\nthey had been derived. They also combined with “oxymuriatic acid,” as\r\nchlorine (discovered by Scheele) was then termed, forming ordinary\r\nsalt, if sodium be employed, and the analogous salt, “muriate of\r\npotash,” if the allied metal, potassium, were subjected to combustion.\r\nBy using mercury as the negative pole, and passing a current through a\r\nstrong solution of the chloride of calcium, strontium, or barium, Davy\r\nsucceeded in procuring mixtures with mercury or “amalgams” of their\r\nmetals, to which he gave the names calcium, strontium, and barium.\r\nDistillation removed most of the mercury, and the metal was left\r\nbehind in a state of comparative purity. The alkali metals, potassium\r\nand sodium, were found to attack glass, liberating “the basis of the\r\nsilex,” to which the name silicon has since been given.\r\n\r\nThus nearly the last of the “earths” had been decomposed. It was proved\r\nthat not merely were the “calces” of iron, copper, lead, and other\r\nwell-known metals compounds of the respective metals with oxygen, but\r\nDavy showed that lime, and its allies, strontia and baryta, and even\r\nsilica or flint, were to be regarded as oxides of elements of metallic\r\nappearance. To complete our review of this part of the subject,\r\nsuffice it to say that aluminum, a metal now produced on an industrial\r\nscale, was prepared for the first time in 1827 by Wöhler, professor of\r\nchemistry at Göttingen, by the action of potassium on its chloride,\r\nand alumina, the earthy basis of clay, was shown to be the oxide of\r\nthe metal aluminum. Indeed, the preparation of this metal in quantity\r\nis now carried out at Schoffhausen-on-the-Rhine and at the Falls of\r\nFoyers, in Scotland, by electrolysis of the oxide dissolved in melted\r\ncryolite, a mineral consisting of the fluorides of sodium and aluminum,\r\nby a method differing only in scale from that by means of which Davy\r\nisolated sodium and potassium in 1806.\r\n\r\nTo Davy, too, belongs the merit of having dethroned oxygen from its\r\ncentral position among the elements. Lavoisier gave to this important\r\ngas the name “oxygen,” because he imagined it to be the constituent\r\nof all acids. He renamed the common compounds of oxygen in such a\r\nmanner that the term oxygen was not even represented in the name—only\r\ninferred. Thus a “nitrate” is a compound of an oxide of nitrogen\r\nand an oxide of a metal; a “sulphate,” of the oxide of a metal with\r\none of the oxides of sulphur, and so on. Davy, by discovering the\r\nelementary nature of chlorine, showed, first, that it is not an\r\noxide of hydrochloric acid (or muriatic acid as it was then called);\r\nand, second, that the latter acid is the compound of the element\r\nchlorine with hydrogen. This he did by passing chlorine over white-hot\r\ncarbon—a substance eminently suited to deprive oxy-compounds of their\r\noxygen—and proving that no oxide of carbon is thereby produced; by\r\nacting on certain chlorides, such as those of tin or phosphorus with\r\nammonia, and showing that no oxide of tin or phosphorus is formed; and,\r\nlastly, by decomposing “muriatic acid gas” (gaseous hydrogen chloride)\r\nwith sodium, and showing that the only product besides common salt is\r\nhydrogen. Instead, therefore, of the former theory that a chloride was\r\na compound of the unknown basis of oxymuriatic acid with oxygen and\r\nthe oxide of a metal, he introduced the simpler and correct view that\r\na chloride is merely a compound of the element chlorine with a metal.\r\nIn 1813 he established the similar nature of fluorine, pointing out\r\nthat on the analogy of the chlorides it was a fair deduction that the\r\nfluorides are compounds of an undiscovered element, fluorine, with\r\nmetals; and that hydrofluoric acid is the true analogue of hydrochloric\r\nacid. The truth of this forecast has been established of recent years\r\nby Henri Moissan, who isolated gaseous fluorine by subjecting a mixture\r\nof hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen potassium fluoride contained in a\r\nplatinum U tube to the action of a powerful electric current. He has\r\nrecently found that the tube may be equally well constructed of copper;\r\nand this may soon lead to the industrial application of the process.\r\nThe difficulty of isolating fluorine is due to its extraordinary\r\nchemical energy; for there are few substances, elementary or compound,\r\nwhich resist the action of this pale yellow, suffocating gas. In 1811\r\niodine, separated by Courtois from the ashes of sea-plants, was shown\r\nby Davy to be an element analogous to chlorine. Gay-Lussac subsequently\r\ninvestigated it and prepared many of its compounds; and in 1826 the\r\nlast of these elements, bromine, was discovered in the mother-liquor\r\nof sea-salt by Balard. The elements of this group have been termed\r\n“halogens,” or “salt producers.”\r\n\r\nWhile Davy was pouring his researches into the astonished ears of\r\nthe scientific and dilettante world, John Dalton, a Manchester\r\nschool-master, conceived a theory that has proved of the utmost service\r\nto the science of chemistry, and which bids fair to outlast our day. It\r\nhad been noticed by Wenzel, by Richter, by Wollaston, and by Cavendish,\r\ntowards the end of the last century, that the same compounds contain\r\nthe same constituents in the same proportions, or, as the phrase runs,\r\n“possess constant composition.” Wollaston, indeed, had gone one step\r\nfarther, and had shown that when the vegetable acid, oxalic acid, is\r\ncombined with potash, it forms two compounds, in one of which the acid\r\nis contained in twice as great an amount relatively to the potash as\r\nin the other. The names _monoxalate_ and _binoxalate_ of potash were\r\napplied to these compounds, to indicate the respective proportions of\r\nthe ingredients. Dalton conceived the happy idea that by applying the\r\nancient Greek conception of atoms to such facts the relative weights\r\nof the atoms could be determined. Illustrating his views with the two\r\ncompounds of carbon with hydrogen, marsh gas and olefiant gas, and with\r\nthe two acids of carbon, carbonic oxide, carbonic “acid,” he regarded\r\nthe former as a compound of one atom of carbon and one of hydrogen, and\r\nthe second as a compound of one atom of carbon and two of hydrogen, and\r\nsimilarly for the two oxides of carbon. Knowing the relative weights\r\nin which these elements enter into combination, we can deduce the\r\nrelative weights of the atoms. Placing the relative weight of an atom\r\nof hydrogen equal to unity, we have:\r\n\r\n            Marsh     Olefiant  |           Carbonic  Carbonic\r\n             Gas        Gas     |            Oxide      Acid\r\n  Carbon      6          6      |  Carbon      5          6\r\n  Hydrogen    1          2      |  Oxygen      8         16\r\n\r\nThus the first compound, marsh gas, was regarded by Dalton as\r\ncomposed of an atom of carbon in union with an atom of hydrogen; or,\r\nto reproduce his symbols, as ⊜◉; while the second, olefiant gas, on\r\nthis hypothesis, was a compound of two atoms of hydrogen with one of\r\ncarbon, or ◉◍◉. Similarly the symbols ◍○, and ○◍○ were given to the two\r\ncompounds of carbon with oxygen. So water was assigned the symbol ◉○,\r\nfor Dalton imagined it to be a compound of one atom of hydrogen with\r\none of oxygen. Compounds containing only two atoms were termed by him\r\n“binary”; those containing three, “ternary”; four, “quaternary,” and\r\nso on. The weight of an atom of oxygen was eight times that of an atom\r\nof hydrogen; while that of an atom of carbon was six times as great\r\nas the unit. By assigning symbols to the elements, consisting of the\r\ninitial letters of their names, or of the first two letters, formulas\r\nwere developed, indicating the composition of the compound, the atomic\r\nweights of the elements being assured. Thus, NaO signified a compound\r\nof an atom of sodium (natrium), weighing twenty-three times as much as\r\na similar atom of hydrogen, with an atom of oxygen, possessing eight\r\ntimes the weight of an atom of hydrogen. Therefore, thirty-one pounds\r\nof soda should consist of twenty-three pounds of sodium in combination\r\nwith eight pounds of oxygen, for, according to Dalton, each smallest\r\nparticle of soda contains an atom of each element, and the proportion\r\nis not changed, however many particles be considered.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out by Judge Stallo, of Philadelphia, in his\r\n_Concepts of Physics_, that such a hypothesis as that of Dalton is\r\nno explanation; that a fact of nature, as, for example, the fact of\r\nsimple and multiple proportions, is not _explained_ by being minified.\r\nAllowing the general truth of this statement, it is, nevertheless,\r\nundoubted that chemistry owes much to Dalton’s hypothesis—a lucky\r\nguess at first, it represents one of the fundamental truths of nature,\r\nalthough its form must be somewhat modified from that in which Dalton\r\nconceived it. Dalton’s work was first expounded by Thomas Thomson,\r\nprofessor at Glasgow, in his _System of Chemistry_, published in 1805;\r\nand subsequently in Dalton’s own _New System of Chemical Philosophy_,\r\nthe three volumes of which were published in 1808, in 1810, and in 1827.\r\n\r\nThe determination of these “Constants of Nature” was at once followed\r\nout by many chemists, Thomson among the first. But chief among the\r\nchemists who have pursued this branch of work was Jacob Berzelius,\r\na Swede, who devoted his long life (1779–1848) to the manufacture\r\nof compounds, and to the determination of their composition, or, as\r\nit is still termed, the determination of the “atomic weights”—more\r\ncorrectly, “equivalents”—of the elements of which they are composed.\r\nIt is to him that we owe most of our analytical methods, for, prior to\r\nhis time, there were few, if any, accurate analyses. Although Lavoisier\r\nhad devised a method for the analysis of compounds of carbon, viz.,\r\nby burning the organic compounds in an atmosphere of oxygen contained\r\nin a bell-jar over mercury, and measuring the volume of carbon dioxide\r\nproduced, as well as that of the residual oxygen, Berzelius achieved\r\nthe same results more accurately and more expeditiously by heating the\r\nsubstance, mixed with chlorate of potassium and sodium chloride, and\r\nthen estimating the hydrogen as well as the carbon; this process was\r\nafterwards perfected by Liebig. Berzelius, however, was able to show\r\nthat compounds of carbon, like those of other elements, were instances\r\nof combination in constant and in multiple proportions.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 two papers were published in the _Annals of Philosophy_ by Dr.\r\nProut, which have had much influence on the progress of chemistry. They\r\ndealt with the figures which were being obtained by Thomson, Berzelius,\r\nand others, at that time supposed to represent the “atomic weights” of\r\nthe elements. Prout’s hypothesis, based on only a few numbers, was that\r\nthe atomic weights of all elements were multiples of that of hydrogen,\r\ntaken as unity. There was much dispute regarding this assertion at the\r\ntime, but as it was contradicted by Berzelius’s numbers, the balance\r\nof opinion was against it. But about the year 1840 Dumas discovered an\r\nerror in the number (12.12) given by Berzelius as the atomic weight of\r\ncarbon; and with his collaborator, Stas, undertook the redetermination\r\nof the atomic weights of the commoner elements—for example, carbon,\r\noxygen, chlorine, and calcium. This line of research was subsequently\r\npursued alone by Stas, whose name will always be remembered for the\r\nprecision and accuracy of his experiments. At first Dumas and Stas\r\ninclined to the view that Prout’s hypothesis was a just one, but it\r\nwas completely disproved by Stas’s subsequent work, as well as by that\r\nof numerous other observers. It is, nevertheless, curious that a much\r\nlarger proportion of the atomic weights approximate to whole numbers\r\nthan would be foretold by the doctrine of chances, and perhaps the last\r\nhas not been heard of Prout’s hypothesis, although in its original\r\ncrude form it is no longer worthy of credence.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noteworthy of the discoveries of the century was\r\nmade by Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) in the year 1808. In conjunction with\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, Gay-Lussac had rediscovered about three years\r\nbefore what had previously been established by Cavendish—namely,\r\nthat, as nearly as possible, two volumes of hydrogen combine with one\r\nvolume of oxygen to form water, the gases having been measured at the\r\nsame temperature and pressure. Humboldt suggested to Gay-Lussac that\r\nit would be well to investigate whether similar simple relations exist\r\nbetween the volumes of other gaseous substances when they combine with\r\neach other. This turned out to be the case; it appeared that almost\r\nexactly two volumes of carbonic oxide unite with one volume of oxygen\r\nto form carbon dioxide; that equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen\r\nunite to form hydrochloric acid gas; that two volumes of ammonia\r\ngas consist of three volumes of hydrogen in union with one volume\r\nof nitrogen, and so on. From such facts, Gay-Lussac was led to make\r\nthe statement that: The weights of equal volumes of both simple and\r\ncompound gases, and therefore their densities, are proportional to\r\ntheir empirically found combining weights, or to rational multiples\r\nof the latter. Gay-Lussac recognized this discovery of his to be a\r\nsupport for the atomic theory; but it did not accord with many of the\r\nthen received atomic weights. The assumption that equal volumes of\r\ngases contain equal numbers of particles, or, as they were termed by\r\nhim, _molécules intégrantes_, was made in 1811 by Avogadro, professor\r\nof physics at Turin (1776–1856). This theory, which has proved of the\r\nutmost importance to the sciences both of physics and of chemistry,\r\nhad no doubt occurred to Gay-Lussac, and had been rejected by him for\r\nthe following reasons: A certain volume of hydrogen, say one cubic\r\ninch, may be supposed to contain an equal number of particles (atoms)\r\nas an equal volume of chlorine. Now these two gases unite in equal\r\nvolumes. The deduction appears so far quite legitimate that one atom of\r\nhydrogen has combined with one atom of chlorine. But the resulting gas\r\noccupies two cubic inches, and must therefore contain the same number\r\nof particles of hydrogen chloride, the compound of the two elements,\r\nas one cubic inch originally contained of hydrogen, or of chlorine.\r\nThus we have two cubic inches containing, of uncombined gases, twice\r\nas many particles as is contained in that volume, after combination.\r\nAvogadro’s hypothesis solved the difficulty. By premising two different\r\norders of particles, now termed _atoms_ and _molecules_, the solution\r\nwas plain. According to him, each particle, or molecule, of hydrogen is\r\na complex, and contains two atoms; the same is the case with chlorine.\r\nWhen these gases combine, or rather _react_, to form hydrogen chloride,\r\nthe phenomenon is one of a change of partners; the molecule, the double\r\natom, of hydrogen splits; the same is the case with the molecule of\r\nchlorine; and each liberated atom of hydrogen unites with a liberated\r\natom of chlorine, forming a compound, hydrogen chloride, which equally\r\nconsists of a molecule, or double atom. Thus two cubic inches of\r\nhydrogen chloride consist of a definite number of molecules, equal\r\nin number to those contained in a cubic inch of hydrogen, plus those\r\ncontained in a cubic inch of chlorine. The case is precisely similar,\r\nif other compounds of gases be considered.\r\n\r\nBerzelius was at first inclined to adopt this theory, and indeed went\r\nso far as to change many of his atomic weights to make them fit it.\r\nBut later he somewhat withdrew from his position, for it appeared to\r\nhim that it was hazardous to extend to liquids and solids a theory\r\nwhich could be held only of gases. Avogadro’s suggestion, therefore,\r\nrested in abeyance until the publication, in 1858, by Cannizzaro, now\r\nprofessor of chemistry in Rome, of an essay in which all the arguments\r\nin favor of the hypothesis were collected and stated in a masterly\r\nmanner. It will be advisable to revert to this hypothesis at a later\r\npoint, and to consider other guides for the determination of atomic\r\nweights.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Dulong (1785–1838), director of the Ecole Polytechnique at\r\nParis, and Petit (1791–1820), professor of physics there, made the\r\ndiscovery that equal amounts of heat are required to raise equally the\r\ntemperature of solid and liquid elements, provided quantities are taken\r\nproportional to their atomic weights. Thus, to raise the temperature of\r\n56 grammes of iron through one degree requires approximately the same\r\namount of heat as is required to raise through one degree 32 grammes of\r\nsulphur, 63.5 grammes of copper, and so on; these numbers representing\r\nthe atomic weights of the elements named. In other words, _equal\r\nnumbers of atoms have equal capacity for heat_. The number of heat\r\nunits, or calories (one calory is the amount of heat required to raise\r\nthe temperature of 1 gramme of water through 1° C.), which is necessary\r\nto raise the atomic weight expressed in grammes of any solid or liquid\r\nelement through 1° C. is approximately 6.2; it varies between 5.7 and\r\n6.6 in actual part. This affords a means of determining the true value\r\nof the atomic weight of an element, as the following example will show:\r\nThe analysis of the only compound of zinc and chlorine shows that it\r\ncontains 47.49 per cent. of zinc and 52.16 per cent. of chlorine. Now\r\none grain of hydrogen combines with 35.5 grains of chlorine to form\r\n36.5 grains of hydrogen chloride; and, as already remarked, one volume\r\nof hydrogen and one volume of chlorine combine, forming two volumes of\r\nhydrogen chloride. Applying Avogadro’s hypothesis, one molecule of\r\nhydrogen and one molecule of chlorine react to yield two molecules of\r\nhydrogen chloride; and as each molecule is supposed to consist in this\r\ncase of two atoms, hydrogen chloride consists of one atom of each of\r\nits constituent elements. The amount of that element, therefore, which\r\ncombines with 35.5 grains of chlorine may give the numerical value of\r\nthe atomic weight of the element, if the compound contains one atom\r\nof each element; in that case the formula of the above compound would\r\nbe zinc, and the atomic weight of zinc, 32.7; but if the formula is\r\nZuCl3, the atomic weight of zinc would be 32.7 × 2; if ZuCl3, 32.7 × 3,\r\nand so on. The specific heat of metallic zinc enables this question to\r\nbe solved. For it has been found, experimentally, to be about 0.095;\r\nand 6.2 ÷ 0.095 = 65.2, a close approximation to 32.7 × 2 = 65.4. The\r\nconclusion is therefore drawn that zinc chloride is composed of one\r\natom of zinc in combination with two atoms of chlorine, that the atomic\r\nweight of zinc is 65.4, and that the molecular weight of zinc chloride\r\nis 65.4 + (35.5 × 2) = 136.4. Inasmuch as the relative weight of a\r\nmolecule of hydrogen is 2 (that of an atom being 1), zinc chloride in\r\nthe gaseous state should be 136.4 ÷ 2 = 68.2 times that of hydrogen,\r\nmeasured at the same temperature and pressure. This has been found,\r\nexperimentally, to be the case.\r\n\r\nThe methods of determining the vapor densities, or relative weights of\r\nvapors, are three in number; the first method, due to Dumas (1827),\r\nconsists in vaporizing the substance in question in a bulb of glass or\r\nof porcelain, at a known temperature, closing the bulb while still hot,\r\nand weighing it after it is cold. Knowing the capacity of the bulb,\r\nthe weight of hydrogen necessary to fill it at the desired temperature\r\ncan be calculated, and the density of the vapor thus arrived at.\r\nA second method was devised by Gay-Lussac and perfected by A. W.\r\nHofmann (1868); and a third, preferable for its simplicity and ease of\r\nexecution, is due to Victor Meyer (1881).\r\n\r\nIn 1858, as already remarked, Cannizzaro showed the connection between\r\nthese known facts, and for the first time attention was called to\r\nthe true atomic weights, which were, up to that time, confused with\r\nequivalents, or weights of elements required to replace one unit weight\r\nof hydrogen. These were generally regarded as atomic weights by Dalton\r\nand his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nSome exceptions had been observed to the law of Dulong and Petit, viz.,\r\nberyllium, or glucinium, an element occurring in emeralds; boron,\r\nof which borax is a compound; silicon, the component of quartz and\r\nflint, and carbon. It was found by Weber that at high temperatures\r\nthe specific heats of these elements are higher, and the atomic heats\r\napproximate to the number of 6.2; but this behavior is not peculiar to\r\nthese elements, for it appears that the specific heat of all elements\r\nincreases with rise of temperature.\r\n\r\nA certain number of exceptions have also been noticed to the law of\r\nGay-Lussac, which may be formulated: the molecular weight of a compound\r\nin a gaseous state is twice its density referred to hydrogen. Thus\r\nequal volumes of ammonia and hydrogen chloride unite to form ammonium\r\nchloride. It was to be expected that the density should be half the\r\nmolecular weight, thus:\r\n\r\n    NH3 +  HCl  =  NH4Cl; and 53.5 ÷ 2 = 26.75 = density.\r\n  (14+3) (1+35.5)  53.5\r\n\r\nBut the density actually found is only half that number, viz., 13.37;\r\nand for long this and similar cases were supposed to be exceptions\r\nto the law of Gay-Lussac, viz., that equal volumes of gases at the\r\nsame pressure expand equally for equal rise of temperature. In other\r\ninstances the gradual decrease in density with rise of temperature can\r\nbe followed, as with chloral hydrate, the products of which are chloral\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nIt was recognized by St. Claire Deville (1857) that the decrease\r\nin density of such mixtures of gases was due, not to their being\r\nexceptions to Avogadro’s law, but to the gradual decomposition of the\r\ncompound body with rise of temperature. To this gradual decomposition\r\nhe gave the name _dissociation_. This conception has proved of the\r\nutmost importance to the science, as will be seen in the sequel. To\r\ntake the above instance of ammonium chloride, its abnormal density is\r\ndue to its dissociation into ammonia and hydrogen chloride; and the gas\r\nwhich is obtained on raising its temperature consists, not of gaseous\r\nammonium chloride, but of a mixture of ammonia and hydrogen chloride,\r\nwhich, as is easily seen, occupy, when separate, twice the volume that\r\nwould be occupied by the gaseous compound. Of recent years it has been\r\nshown by Brereton Baker that, if perfectly free from moisture, ammonium\r\nchloride gasifies as such, and that its density in the state of vapor\r\nis, in fact, 26.75.\r\n\r\nThe molecular complexity of gases has thus gradually become\r\ncomprehended, and the truth of Avogadro’s law has gained acceptance.\r\nAnd as a means of picturing the behavior of gaseous molecules, the\r\n“Kinetic Theory of Gases” has been devised by Joule, Clausius, Maxwell,\r\nThomson (Lord Kelvin), and others. On the assumption that the pressure\r\nof a gas on the walls of the vessel which contains it is due to the\r\ncontinued impacts of its molecules, and that the temperature of a gas\r\nis represented by the product of the mass of the molecules, or the\r\nsquare of their velocity, it has been possible to offer a mechanical\r\nexplanation of Boyle’s law, that at constant temperature the volume\r\nof a gas diminishes in proportion as the pressure increases; of\r\nGay-Lussac’s law, that all gases expand equally for equal rise of\r\ntemperature, provided pressure is kept constant; the condition being\r\nthat equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules. A\r\nstriking support is lent to this chain of reasoning by the facts\r\ndiscovered by Thomas Graham (1805–1869), professor at University\r\nCollege, London, and subsequently master of the Royal Mint. Graham\r\ndiscovered that the rate of diffusion of gases into each other is\r\ninversely as the square roots of their densities. For instance, the\r\ndensity of hydrogen being taken as unity, that of oxygen is sixteen\r\ntimes as great; if a vessel containing hydrogen be made to communicate\r\nwith one containing oxygen, the hydrogen will pass into the oxygen and\r\nmix with it; and, conversely, the oxygen will pass into the hydrogen\r\nvessel. This is due to the intrinsic motion of the molecule of each\r\ngas. And Graham found, experimentally, that for each volume of oxygen\r\nwhich enters the hydrogen vessel four volumes of hydrogen will enter\r\nthe oxygen vessel. Now, 4 = √16; and as these masses are relatively\r\n1 and 16, and their temperatures are equal, the square of their\r\nvelocities are respectively 1 and 16.\r\n\r\nThe question of the molecular complexity of gases being thus disposed\r\nof, it remains to be considered what are the relative complexity of\r\nliquid molecules. The answer is indicated by a study of the capillary\r\nphenomena of liquids, one method of measuring which is the height of\r\ntheir ascent in narrow or capillary tubes. We shall not enter here into\r\ndetail as to the method and arguments necessary; suffice it to say that\r\nthe Hungarian physicist Eötvös was the first to indicate the direction\r\nof research, and that Ramsay and Shields succeeded in proving that the\r\ncomplexity of the molecules of most liquids is not greater than that\r\nof the gases which they form on being vaporized; and also that certain\r\nliquids, _e.g._, water, the alcohols, and other liquids, are more or\r\nless “associated,” _i.e._, their molecules occur in couplices of two,\r\nthree, four, or more, and as the temperature is raised the complexity\r\nof molecular structure diminishes.\r\n\r\nAs regards the molecular complexity of solids, nothing definite\r\nis known, and, moreover, there appears to be no method capable of\r\nrevealing it.\r\n\r\nWhile the researches of which a short account has now been given have\r\nled to knowledge regarding the nature of molecules, the structure\r\nof the molecule has excited interest since the early years of the\r\ncentury, and its investigation has led to important results. The\r\nfact of the decomposition of acidified water by an electric current,\r\ndiscovered by Nicholson and Carlisle, and of salts into “bases” and\r\n“acids” by Berzelius and Hisinger in 1803, led to the belief that\r\na close connection exists between electric energy, or, as it was\r\nthen termed, “electric force,” and the affinity which holds the\r\nconstituents of chemical compounds in combination. In 1807 Davy\r\npropounded the theory that all compounds consist of two portions, one\r\nelectro-positive and the other electro-negative. This idea was the\r\nresult of experiments on the behavior of substances, such, for example,\r\nas copper and sulphur—if portions of these elements be insulated and\r\nthen brought into contact they become oppositely electrified. The\r\ndegree of electrification is intensified by rise of temperature until,\r\nwhen combination ensues, the electrification vanishes. Combination,\r\ntherefore, according to Davy, is concurrent with the equalization of\r\npotentials. In 1812 Berzelius brought forward an electro-chemical\r\ntheory which for the following twenty years was generally accepted.\r\nHis primary assumption was that the atoms of elements, or, in certain\r\ncases, groups of atoms, are themselves electrified; that each atom, or\r\ngroup of atoms, possesses two poles, one positive, the other negative;\r\nthat the electrification of one of these poles predominates over\r\nthat of the other, so that the atom or group is itself, as a whole,\r\nelectro-positive, or electro-negative; that combination ensued between\r\nsuch oppositely electrified bodies by the neutralization, partial or\r\ncomplete, of their electric charges; and, lastly, that the polarity\r\nof an element or group could be determined by noting whether the\r\nelement or group separated at the positive or at the negative pole of\r\nthe galvanic battery, or electrolysis. For Berzelius, oxygen was the\r\nmost electro-negative and potassium the most electro-positive of the\r\nelements, the bridge between the “non-metals” and the “metals” being\r\nhydrogen, which, with nitrogen, forms a basic, or electro-positive,\r\ngroup, while with chlorine, etc., it forms electro-negative groups.\r\nThe fact that an electric current splits compounds in solution\r\ninto two portions led Berzelius to devise his “dualistic” system,\r\nwhich involved the assumption that all compounds consist of two\r\nportions, one electro-positive, the other electro-negative.\r\nThus sulphate of magnesium and potassium was to be regarded as\r\ncomposed of electro-positive potassium sulphate in combination\r\nwith electro-negative magnesium sulphate; the former in its turn\r\nconsisted of electro-negative sulphur trioxide (SO3) in combination\r\nwith electro-positive oxide of potassium (K2O); while each of these\r\nproximate constituents of potassium sulphate were themselves composed\r\nof the electro-negative oxygen in combination with electro-positive\r\nsulphur, or potassium. On contrasting sulphur with potassium, however,\r\nthe former was considered more electro-negative than the latter; so\r\nthat the group SO3 as a whole was electro-negative, while K2O was\r\nelectro-positive. The symbols given above, which are still in universal\r\nuse, were also devised by Berzelius for the purpose of illustrating and\r\nemphasizing his views. These views, however, met with little acceptance\r\nat the time in England.\r\n\r\nLavoisier’s idea, that oxygen was the necessary constituent of all\r\nacids, began about this time to lose ground. For Davy had proved the\r\nelementary nature of chlorine; and hydrochloric acid, one of the\r\nstrongest, was thus seen to contain no oxygen, and Davy expressed the\r\nview, founded on his observation, that iodic “acid,” I2O5, was devoid\r\nof acid properties until dissolved in water, and that the essential\r\nconstituent of all acids was hydrogen, not oxygen. The bearing of this\r\ntheory on the dualistic theory is, that while, _e.g._, sulphuric acid\r\nwas regarded by Berzelius as SO3, containing no hydrogen, and was\r\nsupposed to be separated as such at the positive pole of a battery,\r\nDavy’s suggestion led to the opposite conclusion that the formula\r\nof sulphuric acid is H2SO4, and that by the current it is resolved\r\ninto H2 and SO4. Faraday’s electrolytic law, that when a current is\r\npassed through electrolytes in solution the elements are liberated in\r\nquantities proportional to their equivalents, led to the abandonment\r\nof the dualistic theory. For when a current is passed in succession\r\nthrough acidified water, fused lead chloride, and a solution of\r\npotassium sulphate, the quantities of hydrogen and oxygen from the\r\nwater, of lead and chlorine from the lead chloride, and the potassium\r\nof the sulphate are in accordance with Faraday’s law. But in addition\r\nto the potassium there is liberated at the same pole an equivalent of\r\nhydrogen. Now, if Berzelius’s theory be true, the products should be\r\nSO3 and K2O, but if the opposite view be correct, then K2 is liberated\r\nfirst and by its subsequent action on water it yields potash and\r\nits equivalent of hydrogen. This was pointed out first by Daniell,\r\nprofessor at King’s College, London, and it was regarded as a powerful\r\nargument against Berzelius’s system. In 1833, too, Graham investigated\r\nthe phosphoric acids, and prepared the salts of three, to which he\r\ngave the names, _ortho-_, _pyro-_, and _meta-_ phosphoric acids. To\r\nunderstand the bearing of this on the doctrine of dualism it must be\r\nremembered that P2O5, pentoxide of phosphorus, was at that date named\r\nphosphoric acid. When dissolved in water it reacts with bases, forming\r\nsalts—the phosphates. But the quantity of water necessary was not then\r\nconsidered essential; Graham, however, showed that there exist three\r\nseries of salts—one set derived from P2O5,3H2O, one from P2O5,2H2O,\r\nand a third from P2O5,H2O. His way of stating the fact was that water\r\ncould play the part of a base; for example, the ordinary phosphate\r\nof commerce possessed, according to him, the formula P2O5,2Na2O,H2O,\r\ntwo-thirds of the “water of constitution” being replaced by oxide of\r\nsodium. Liebig, then professor at Giessen (1803–1873), founded on these\r\nand on similar observations of his own the doctrine of poly-basic\r\nacids—acids in which one, two, three, or more atoms of hydrogen\r\nwere replaceable by metals. Thus, instead of writing, as Graham did,\r\nP2O5,2Na2O,H2O, he wrote, PO4Na2H; and for orthophosphoric acid\r\nPO4H3. The group of atoms (PO4), therefore, existed throughout the\r\nwhole series of orthophosphates, and could exist in combination with\r\nhydrogen, with hydrogen and metals, or with metals alone. Similarly\r\nthe group (P2O7) was characteristic of pyrophosphates and (PO3) of\r\nmetaphosphates, for P2O5,2H2O=(P2O7)H4; and P2O5,H2O=2(PO3)H.\r\n\r\nThe first clear ideas of the structure of the molecule were, however,\r\ngained from the study of the compounds of carbon. It was difficult to\r\napply the dualistic theory to them. For few of them are electrolytes,\r\nand therefore their products of electrolysis, being non-existent,\r\ncould not be classified. Nevertheless, Gay-Lussac regarded alcohol,\r\nC2H6O, as a compound of C2H4, ethylene, and H2O, water; and oxalic\r\nacid (anhydrous), C2O3, as one of CO2 with CO. The discovery of\r\n“isomeric compounds,” _i.e._, of compounds which possess the same\r\nultimate formula and yet differ entirely in their properties,\r\nforced upon chemists the necessity of attending to the structure of\r\nthe molecule; for only by such a supposition could the difference\r\nbetween two isomeric bodies be explained. In 1823 Liebig discovered\r\nthat silver fulminate and silver cyanate both possessed the empirical\r\nformula AgCNO; in 1825 this was followed by the discovery by Faraday\r\nthat oil gas contains a hydrocarbon identical in composition with\r\nethylene, C2H4, yet differing from it in properties; and in 1829\r\nWöhler, professor in Göttingen (1800–1882), discovered that urea, a\r\nconstituent of urine, could be produced by heating ammonium cyanate,\r\nNH4CNO, a substance of the same formula. It therefore became clear that\r\nthe identity of a compound must depend on some other cause than its\r\nultimate composition.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Liebig and Wöhler took an important step in elucidating this\r\nquestion by their investigations on benzoic acid and acid obtainable\r\nby distilling a resin named gum benzoin. They showed that this acid,\r\nC7H6O2, could be conceived as consisting of the group C7H5O, to which\r\nthey gave the name “benzoyl,” in combination with OH; that benzoic\r\naldehyde, C7H6O, might be regarded as its compound with hydrogen; that\r\nit also formed compounds with chlorine, and bromine, and sulphur,\r\nand replaced hydrogen in ammonia (C7H6O,NH2). They termed this\r\ngroup, benzoyl, a “compound element” or a “radical.” This research\r\nwas followed by one by Robert Bunsen, professor at Heidelberg, born\r\nin 1811, and recently (1899) dead, which bore reference to cacodyl,\r\na compound of arsenic, carbon and hydrogen, in which the idea of a\r\nradical was confirmed and amplified.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a radical having thus become established, Jean Baptiste\r\nAndrée Dumas, professor in Paris (1800–1884), propounded the theory\r\nof “substitution,” _i.e._, that an element such as chlorine or oxygen\r\n(which, be it noticed, is electro-negative on Berzelius’s scale) could\r\nreplace hydrogen in carbon compounds, atom for atom, the resulting\r\ncompound belonging to the same “type” as the one from which it was\r\nderived. And Laurent, warden of the mint at Paris (1807–1853), and\r\nGerhardt, professor at Montpelier and at Strasburg (1816–1856),\r\nemphasized the fact that one element, be it what it may, can replace\r\nanother without fundamentally altering its chemical character, and\r\nalso that an atom of hydrogen can be replaced by a group of atoms or\r\nradical, behaving for the occasion like the atom of an element. It is\r\nto Laurent and Gerhardt that we owe the definition of an atom—_the\r\nsmallest quantity of an element which can be present in a compound_; an\r\nequivalent—_that weight of an element which combines with or replaces\r\none part by weight of hydrogen_; and a molecule—_the smallest quantity\r\nwhich can exist in a free state, whether of an element or a compound_.\r\nThey recognized, too, that a molecule of hydrogen, chlorine, etc.,\r\nconsists of two atoms.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Wurtz, professor in Paris (1817–1884), and Hofmann, then\r\nprofessor in the College of Chemistry in London, afterwards at Berlin\r\n(1818–1892), discovered a series of compounds allied to ammonia, NH3,\r\nin which one or more atoms of hydrogen were replaced by a group or\r\nradical, such as methyl (CH3), ethyl (C2H5), or phenyl (C6H5). Wurtz\r\nreferred such compounds to the ammonia “type.” They all resemble\r\nammonia in their physical properties—smell, taste, etc.—as well as\r\nin their power of uniting with acids to form salts resembling ammonium\r\nchloride (NH4Cl), and other ammonium compounds. Shortly afterwards\r\nWilliamson, professor at University College, London, added the “water\r\ntype,” in consequence of his researches on “mixed ethers”—bodies in\r\nwhich the hydrogen of water might be regarded as replaced by organic\r\nradicals. Thus we have the series:\r\n\r\nH. O. H.; CH3. O. H.; CH3. O. CH3; and NH3; NH2; H3; NH(CH3)2; and\r\nN(CH3)3; the first representing compounds following the water type,\r\nthe latter the ammonia type. This suggestion had been previously made\r\nby Laurent, in 1846. But Williamson extended his views to inorganic\r\ncompounds; thus, sulphuric acid was represented as constructed on the\r\ndouble water type—HO. SO2. OH, being derived from H. O. (H. H) O.\r\nH, the two hydrogen atoms enclosed in brackets being replaced by the\r\nradical SO2. To these types Gerhardt added the hydrogen and hydrogen\r\nchloride types, H.H. and H.Cl; and, later, Kekulé, professor in Bonn\r\n(1829), added the marsh gas type C(H)4. The next important step was\r\ntaken by Frankland, professor in the Royal School of Mines, London;\r\nhis work, however, had been anticipated by Cunn Brown, professor at\r\nEdinburgh University, in a pamphlet even yet little known. It was to\r\nattribute to elements one or more powers of combination. To these\r\nhe gave the name “valency,” and the capacity of possessing valency\r\nwas called “quantivalence.” Thus hydrogen was taken as a “monad,” or\r\nmonovalent. Chlorine, because it unites with hydrogen atom to atom,\r\nis also a monad. Oxygen, having the power to combine with two atoms\r\nof hydrogen, was termed a dyad, or divalent; nitrogen a triad, or\r\ntrivalent; carbon a tetrad, or tetravalent, and so on. This is evident\r\nfrom inspection of the formulas of their compounds with hydrogen, thus:\r\n\r\n                         H     H   H\r\n                        /       \\ /\r\n  H——Cl;  H——O——H;  H——N   ;     C\r\n                        \\       / \\\r\n                         H     H   H\r\n\r\nInstances of penta, hexa, and even hepta-valency are not wanting.\r\n\r\nThis was the key to unlock the structure of chemical compounds; and\r\nFrankland’s views, just stated, are still held by chemists. The\r\ndetermination of the constitution of compounds, chiefly those of\r\ncarbon, occupied the attention of chemists, almost exclusively, until\r\n1880. The plan of action is much the same as that of a mechanician who\r\nwishes to imitate a complicated mechanism. He must first dissect it\r\ninto groups of mechanical contrivances; these are next constructed; and\r\nthey are finally built together into the complete machine. In certain\r\ncases the atoms of carbon are arranged in “chains,” as, for example, in\r\npentyl alcohol:\r\n\r\n  H3C——C——C——C——C——O——H\r\n          H2 H2 H2 H2\r\n\r\neach atom being tetrad, and its “affinities,” or powers of combination,\r\nsaturated either with hydrogen or with those of neighboring atoms of\r\ncarbon; in others they are in the form of a “ring,” as in benzene, the\r\nformula of which was first suggested by Kekulé, viz.:\r\n\r\n     H  H\r\n     C——C\r\n    /    \\\r\n  HC      CH;\r\n    \\    /\r\n     C==C\r\n     H  H\r\n\r\nor in both, as in ethyl benzene,\r\n\r\n     H  H\r\n     C——C\r\n    /    \\   H  H\r\n  HC      C——C——CH.\r\n    \\    /   H  H\r\n     C==C\r\n     H  H\r\n\r\nOne or more atoms of nitrogen, or of oxygen, may form part of the\r\ncircle, as in pyridine:\r\n\r\n    H  H                       H  H\r\n    C——C                       C  C\r\n   /    \\                     /\r\n  N      CH  and furfurane,  O  ==  ,\r\n   \\    /                     \\\r\n    C==C                       C  C\r\n    H  H                       H  H\r\n\r\nand so on. By means of conceptions such as these many interesting\r\ncompounds have been built up out of the elements which they contain;\r\n_e.g._, urea and uric acid, constituents of urine; theobromine and\r\ncaffeine, the essential principles of cocoa and tea; alizarine and\r\nindigo, valuable dyestuffs; and several of the alkaloids, bitter\r\nprinciples contained in plants, of great medicinal value.\r\n\r\nThey have led, too, to the discovery of many brilliant colors, now\r\nalmost universally employed, to the exclusion of those less brilliant,\r\nbecause less pure, derived from plants, and in one or two cases\r\nfrom animals; the manufacture of gun-cotton, dynamite, and similar\r\nhigh explosives; and to the development of the candle industry; the\r\nsugar manufacture; to improvement in tanning, in brewing, and in the\r\npreparation of gas and oils for illuminating purposes. In short, it may\r\nbe said that the industrial progress of the latter half of the century\r\nhas been due to the theoretical views of which a short sketch has just\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\nSuch formulas, however, can evidently not represent the true\r\nconstitution of matter, inasmuch as the atoms are imagined to lie\r\non a plane, whereas it is evident that they must occupy space\r\nof three dimensions and possess the attributes of solidity. The\r\nconception which led to the formulation of such views was due first\r\nto Pasteur, in his later years director of the institute known by\r\nhis name at Paris, and more directly to LeBel and Van’t Hoff, now\r\nprofessor at Berlin, independently of each other. In 1848 Pasteur\r\ndiscovered that it was possible to separate the two varieties of\r\ntartaric acid from each other; and that that one which rotated the\r\nplane of polarized light to the right gave crystals with an extra\r\nface, unsymmetrically disposed with regard to the other faces of the\r\ncrystal. The variety, the solution of which in water was capable of\r\nproducing left-handed rotation, also possessed a similar face, but so\r\nplaced that its reflection in a mirror reproduced the right-handed\r\nvariety. Pasteur also showed that a mixture of these acids gave\r\ncrystals not characterized by an unsymmetrically placed face; and\r\nalso that the solution was without action on polarized light. These\r\nobservations remained unexplained, until LeBel and Van’t Hoff, in\r\n1874, simultaneously and independently devised a theory which has,\r\nup till now, stood the test of research. It is briefly this: Imagine\r\ntwo regular tetrahedra, or three-sided pyramids, standing each on its\r\ntriangular base. An idea can best be got by a model, easily made by\r\nlaying on a table three lucifer matches so as to form an equilateral\r\ntriangle, and erecting a tripod with three other matches, so that\r\neach leg of the tripod stands on one corner of the triangle. At the\r\ncentre of such a tetrahedron, an atom of carbon is supposed to be\r\nplaced. Marsh gas, CH4, is supposed to have such a structure, each\r\ncorner, or solid angle of the structure (of which there are four),\r\nbeing occupied by an atom of hydrogen. This represents the solid or\r\n_stereochemical_ formula of methane or marsh gas. Now, suppose one of\r\nthe atoms of hydrogen in each of these structures to be replaced by\r\nchlorine, the group (OH), or any other monovalent element or group. It\r\nis evident that if not exactly similar (owing to the replacement not\r\nhaving been made at similar corners in each), the two structures can be\r\nmade similar by turning one of them round, until the position of the\r\nsubstituting atom or group (which we will term X) coincides in position\r\nwith X in the stationary one. If two such replacements be made, say,\r\nwith X and Y in each, coincidence can again be made to take place; but\r\nthe same is not the case if X, Y, and Z replace three atoms of hydrogen\r\nin the structure; for there is one way of replacement which is the\r\noptical image of the other, and represents the other’s reflection in a\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Tetrahedron XYZ) and (Tetrahedron XZY)]\r\n\r\nNow, it is found that when the four corners of such a structure are\r\noccupied by four separate atoms or groups, or when (as the expression\r\ngoes) the body contains an “asymmetrical carbon atom,” if the substance\r\nor one of its derivations can be obtained in a crystalline form, the\r\ncrystals are also asymmetric, _i.e._, arc develops a face which is the\r\nmirror-reflection of a similar face developed on the other variety;\r\nand if a beam of polarized light be passed through the solution of\r\nthe substance, its plane is rotated to the left if one variety be\r\nused, and, if the other, to the right. This hypothesis of LeBel’s\r\nand Van’t Hoff’s has had an enormous influence on the progress of\r\norganic chemistry. By its means Fischer, now professor at Berlin, has\r\nexplained the reason of the existence of the enormous number of bodies\r\nanalogous to grape and cane sugar, and has prepared many new varieties;\r\nand it appears likely that the terpenes, a class of bodies allied to\r\nturpentine, and comprising most of the substances to which the odor of\r\nflowers is due, may thereby find their explanation. It may be mentioned\r\nin passing that Pasteur, having found that ordinary mould destroyed\r\none variety of tartaric acid rather than the other in a mixture of\r\nthe two, and made use of this observation in order to prepare the\r\nunattached variety in a state of purity, was led to study the action\r\nof organisms more or less resembling mould; and that this has led\r\nto the development of the science of bacteriology, which has had an\r\nenormous influence on our views regarding fermentation in general,\r\nand guides the work of our physicians, our surgeons (witness Lister’s\r\nantiseptic treatment), our sanitary engineers in their estimate of\r\nthe purity of drinking-water and of the disposal of sewage, of our\r\nmanufacturers of beer and spirits, of wine-growers, and more recently\r\nof farmers. All these processes depend upon the action of organisms\r\nin producing chemical changes, whether in the tissues of the body,\r\ncausing or curing disease, or in the production of flavored alcohol\r\nfrom sugar, or in the manufacture of butter and cheese, or in preparing\r\nthe land for the reception of crops. We also owe to the genius of\r\nVan’t Hoff the most important advance of recent times in the region\r\nof physical chemistry. It has been observed by Raoult, professor at\r\nGrenoble, that the freezing-point of a solvent as a general rule is\r\nlowered to the same extent if there be dissolved in it quantities of\r\nsubstances proportional to their molecular weights. Thus, supposing\r\n1.80 grams of grape-sugar be dissolved in 100 grams of water and the\r\nsolution cooled below 0° with constant stirring, ice separates suddenly\r\nin thin spicules, and the temperature rises to −0.185°. If 3.42 grams\r\nof cane-sugar be similarly dissolved in 100 grams of water, the\r\nfreezing-point of the solution is again −0.185°. Now, 1.80 and 3.42 are\r\nrespectively the hundredth part of the molecular weights of grape-sugar\r\n(C6H12O6) and cane-sugar (C12H22O11). Similarly, Raoult found that\r\nquantities proportional to molecular weights dissolved in a solvent\r\ndepress the vapor pressure of that solvent equally, or, what comes to\r\nthe same thing, raise its boiling-point by an equal number of degrees.\r\nBut ordinary salts, such as sodium chloride, potassium nitrate, etc.,\r\ndissolved in water, give too great a depression of the freezing-point\r\nand too high a boiling-point. Next, it has been observed by botanists,\r\nDevries, Pfeffer, and others, who had examined the ascent of sap in\r\nplants, that if a vessel of unglazed porcelain, so treated as to cause\r\na film of cupric ferrocyanide (a slimy red compound) to deposit in the\r\npores of its walls, be filled with a weak (about 1 per cent.) solution\r\nof sugar or similar substance, and plunged in a vessel of pure water,\r\nwater entered through the pores. By attaching a monometer to the porous\r\nvessel the pressure exerted by the entering water could be measured.\r\nSuch pressure was termed “osmotic pressure,” referring to the “osmosis”\r\nor passage through the walls of the vessel. Such prepared walls are\r\npermeable freely to water, but not to sugar or similar bodies. Van’t\r\nHoff pointed out that the total pressure registered is proportional to\r\nthe amount of substance in solution, and that it is proportional to\r\nthe absolute temperature, and he showed, besides, that the pressure\r\nexerted by the sugar molecules is the same as that which would be\r\nexerted at the same temperature were an equal number of molecules of\r\nhydrogen to occupy the same volume as the sugar solution. This may\r\nbe expressed by stating that when in dilute solution sugar molecules\r\nbehave _as if_ they were present in the gaseous state. Here again,\r\nhowever, it was noticed that salts tended to give a higher pressure; it\r\nwas difficult to construct a semi-permeable diaphragm, however, which\r\nwould resist the passage of salt molecules, while allowing those of\r\nwater to pass freely. Lastly, Arrhenius, of Stockholm, had shown that\r\nthe conductivity of salt solutions for electricity may be explained on\r\nthe assumption that when a salt, such as KNO3 is dissolved in water,\r\nit dissociates into portions similar in number and kind to those it\r\nwould yield if electrolyzed (and if no secondary reactions were to\r\ntake place). Such portions (K and NO3, for example) had been named\r\nions by Faraday. The conductivity of such solutions becomes greater,\r\nper unit of dissolved salt, the weaker the solution, until finally a\r\nlimit is reached, after which further dilution no longer increases\r\nconductivity. Now Van’t Hoff united all these isolated observations\r\nand showed their bearing on each other. Stated shortly, the hypothesis\r\nis as follows: When a substance is dissolved in a large quantity of\r\na solvent, its molecules are separated from each other to a distance\r\ncomparable with that which obtains in gases. They are, therefore,\r\ncapable of independent action; and when placed in a vessel the walls of\r\nwhich are permeable to the solvent, but not to the dissolved substance\r\n(“semi-permeable membrane”), the imprisoned molecules of the latter\r\nexert pressure on the interior surface of these walls as if they\r\nwere gaseous. Van’t Hoff showed the intimate connection between this\r\nphenomenon and the depression of freezing-point and the use of vapor\r\npressure already alluded to. He pointed out further that the exceptions\r\nto this behavior, noticed in the case of dissolved salts, are due to\r\ntheir “electric dissociation,” or “ionization,” as it is now termed;\r\nand that in a sufficiently dilute solution of potassium nitrate,\r\nfor example, the osmotic pressure, and the correlated depression of\r\nfreezing-point and rise of boiling-point, are practically equal to what\r\nwould be produced were the salt to be split into its ions, K and NO3.\r\nThese views were vigorously advocated by Ostwald, professor at Leipzig,\r\nin his _Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie_, and he and his pupils\r\nhave done much to gather together facts in confirmation of this theory,\r\nand in extending its scope.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the ions K and NO3 are not, strictly\r\nspeaking, atoms; they are _charged_ atoms; the K retains a +, and the\r\nNO3 a − charge. On immersing into the solution the poles of a battery,\r\none charged + and the other −, the + K atoms are attracted to the −\r\npole, and are there discharged; as soon as they lose their charge they\r\nare free to act on the water, when they liberate their equivalent of\r\nhydrogen. Similarly, the − NO3 groups are discharged at the + pole, and\r\nabstract hydrogen from the water, liberating an equivalent quantity\r\nof oxygen. Thus the phenomenon of electrolysis, so long a mysterious\r\nprocess, finds a simple explanation. The course of ordinary chemical\r\nreactions is also readily realized when viewed in the light of this\r\ntheory. Take, for example, the ordinary equation:\r\n\r\n  AgNO3.Aq + NaCl.Ag = AgCl + NaNO3.Aq;\r\n\r\n_i.e._, solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride give a\r\nprecipitate of silver chloride, leaving sodium nitrate in solution. By\r\nthe new views, such an equation must be written:\r\n\r\n  +       −        +       −              +       −\r\n  Ag.Aq + NO3.Aq + Na.Aq + Cl.Aq = AgCl + Na.Aq + NO3.Aq.\r\n\r\nThe compound, silver chloride, being insoluble in water, is formed\r\nby the union of the ions Ag and Cl, and their consequent discharge,\r\nforming an electrically neutral compound; while the sodium ions,\r\ncharged positively together with the NO3 ions, negatively charged,\r\nremain in solution.\r\n\r\nOne more application of the principle may be given. Many\r\nobservers—Andrews, Favre, and Silbermann, but especially Julius\r\nThomsen, of Copenhagen, and M. Berthelot, of Paris—have devoted much\r\nlabor and time to the measurement of the heat evolved during chemical\r\nreactions. Now, while very different amounts of heat are evolved when\r\nchlorine, bromine, or iodine combine respectively with sodium or\r\npotassium, the number of heat units evolved on neutralizing sodium\r\nor potassium hydroxide with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, or\r\nnitric acids is always about 13,500. How can this fact be explained? It\r\nfinds its explanation as follows: These acids and bases are ionized in\r\nsolution as shown in the equation:\r\n\r\n  +      −        +       −              +       −\r\n  H.Aq + Cl.Aq. + Na.Aq + OH.Aq = H.OH + Na.Aq + Cl.Aq.\r\n\r\nWater is the only compound formed; and it is produced by the union\r\nof the hydrogen-ion originally belonging to the acid, and the OH or\r\nhydroxyl-ion originally belonging to the base. No further change has\r\noccurred; hence the uniform evolution of heat by the interaction of\r\nequivalent quantities of these acids and bases.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to give a short account of the greatest generalization\r\nwhich has as yet been made in chemistry. It has been termed the\r\n“Periodic Arrangement of the Elements.”\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Newlands, of London, and Lothar Meyer, late of Tübingen, found\r\nthat by arranging the elements in the order of their atomic weights\r\ncertain regularities were to be observed between each element, and\r\nin general the eighth in succession from it, in the order of their\r\nnumerical value. Such similar elements formed groups or quantities;\r\nwhile the elements separating them belong to a _period_, hence the name\r\n“periodic arrangement.” Commencing with lithium, a light, lustrous\r\nmetal found in silicate in certain minerals, we have the following\r\nseries:\r\n\r\n  Lithium Beryllium Boron    Carbon  Nitrogen   Oxygen  Fluorine Neon\r\n     7       9.2      11       12       14        16       19     20\r\n\r\n  Sodium  Magnesium Aluminum Silicon Phosphorus Sulphur Chlorine Argon\r\n    23      24.3      27       28       31        34      35.5    40\r\n\r\nand so on. It is unnecessary to point out in detail the resemblances\r\nbetween the elements which stand in the vertical columns; but it\r\nmay be stated that the resemblance extends also to the formulas and\r\nproperties of their compounds. Thus the chlorides of lithium and sodium\r\nare each white soluble salts, of the formulas LiCl and NaCl; oxides of\r\nmagnesium and of beryllium are both insoluble white earthy powders,\r\nMgO and BeO (GeO), and so on. Newlands, in his preliminary sketch,\r\ntermed this order the “Law of Octaves,” and predicted the existence of\r\ncertain undiscovered elements which should occupy unfilled positions in\r\nthe table. Mendeléef, professor at St. Petersburg, in 1869 amplified\r\nand extended these relations; and he and Meyer pointed out that the\r\nvolume occupied by equal numbers of atoms of such elements underwent\r\na periodic variation when the elements are classified as above.\r\nThe prediction of undiscovered elements was made by Mendeléef in a\r\nmore assured manner; and in several cases they have been realized.\r\nThus what Mendeléef called “ekaboron” has since been discovered by\r\nLecoq de Boisbandron and named, patriotically, “gallium”; Mendeléef’s\r\n“eka-silicon” is now known as “germanium,” discovered by Winkler; and\r\n“eka-aluminum” is now Cléve’s “scandium.” Moreover, the atomic weights\r\nof cæsium, beryllium, molybdenium, and mercury have been altered so\r\nthat they fit the periodic table; and further research has justified\r\nthe alteration.\r\n\r\nThe valency of these elements increases from right to left, as will be\r\nseen by inspection of the following series:\r\n\r\n  LiCl     BeCl3    BCl3     CCl4              NH4Cl\r\n  Na2O     MgO      B2O3     SiO2              PCl3\r\n  Monad.   Dyad.   Triad.   Tetrad.     Triad and Pentad.\r\n\r\n        OH2                  FH                Ne——\r\n        SO3               Cl(OH)O3             A——\r\n    Dyad and Hexad.    Monad and Heptad.   No valency.\r\n\r\nThe elements of no valency are of recent discovery. In 1894 Lord\r\nRayleigh had determined the density of the nitrogen of the atmosphere,\r\nhaving separated from it the oxygen and carbon dioxide which is mixed\r\nwith nitrogen in air. He found it to be of somewhat higher density\r\nthan that obtainable from ammonia and other compounds of nitrogen.\r\nIn conjunction with Ramsay he investigated atmospheric nitrogen; it\r\nwas absorbed either by a method devised by Cavendish, or by making it\r\ncombine with magnesium at a red heat. They found that the unabsorbable\r\nresidue possessed an unknown spectrum, and that its density was nearly\r\n20. To this new gas they gave the name “argon,” or inactive, seeing\r\nthat all attempts to cause it to enter into combination had failed.\r\nIn 1895 Ramsay, searching for possible combinations of argon in\r\nminerals, experimented with one which had been previously examined by\r\nHillebrand, of Baltimore, and obtained from it helium, a gas of density\r\n2, possessing a spectrum which had been previously discovered in 1868\r\nin the chromosphere of the sun, by Jannsen, of Paris, and named helium\r\nby Frankland and Lockyer. Subsequent liquefaction of crude argon by\r\nmeans of liquid air, prepared by a process invented simultaneously by\r\nLinde and Hampson, gave a residue which was named by its discoverers,\r\nRamsay and Travers, “neon.” Liquid argon has yielded two other gases\r\nalso, “krypon” and “xenon.” These elements form a separate group in the\r\nPeriodic Table, commencing with helium, with atomic weight, 4; neon,\r\n20; argon, 40; krypon, 82; and xenon, 128. They all agree in being\r\nmono-atomic, _i.e._, their molecules consist of single atoms; and they\r\nhave no tendency to form compounds, _i.e_., they possess no valency.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch of the progress of chemistry during the century which\r\nhas just passed, attention has been paid chiefly to the progress\r\nof thought. Allusions must, however, be made to the applications\r\nof chemistry to industrial purposes. The development of the soda\r\nindustry, the preparation of carbonate of soda and caustic from common\r\nsalt—initiated in France by LeBlanc (1742–1806)—has been developed\r\nby Tennant, in Scotland, and Muspeath and Gossage, and by Hargreaves,\r\nWeldon, and Maetea, in England; this process has at present a serious\r\nrival in the ammonia-soda process, developed by Solway, in Belgium,\r\nand by Brunner and Mond, in England. The main action of sulphuric\r\nacid, so long associated with the alkali process, has made enormous\r\nstrides during the present century, but is still, in the main, the\r\noriginal process of causing sulphur dioxide in presence of water to\r\nabsorb the oxygen of the air through nitric oxide. But the saving of\r\nthe oxides of nitrogen through the invention of a sulphuric acid power\r\nby Gay-Lussac, known by his name, and the re-utilization of these\r\noxides in the “Glover” power, invented by John Glover, of Newcastle,\r\nhave greatly lessened the cost of the acid. Concentration of the acid\r\nin iron vessels is now common, the cost of platinum or of fragile\r\nglass vessels being thereby saved. The desulphurization of iron and\r\nthe removal of silicon, carbon, and phosphorus by Bessemer’s process,\r\nmodified by Thomas and Gilchrist through the introduction of a “basic\r\nmagnesia lining” for the convertors, has made it possible to obtain\r\npure iron and steel from ores previously regarded as of little value.\r\n\r\nThe use of artificial manures, prepared by mixing refuse animal\r\nmatters with tetra-hydrogen, calcium phosphate, and nitrate of soda,\r\nor sulphate of ammonia, first introduced by Liebig, has created\r\na revolution in agricultural methods and in the weight of crops\r\nobtainable from a given area of soil. The influence of manures on\r\ncrops has been fully studied by Lawes and Gilbert for more than fifty\r\nyears in their experimental farm at Rothampstead. The most remarkable\r\nadvances which have been made, however, are due to cheap electric\r\ncurrent. The electrolysis of alumina, dissolved in fused cryolite to\r\nobtain aluminum, an operation carried out at Schaffhausen-on-the-Rhine,\r\nand at the Falls of Foyers, in Scotland; the electro-deposition of pure\r\ncopper for electric wires and cables, electro-silvering, gilding, and\r\nnickelling, all these are instances where decomposition of a compound\r\nby the electric current has led to important industrial results. At\r\npresent soda and chlorine are being manufactured by the electrolysis\r\nof salt solution contained in rocking trays, one of the electrodes\r\nbeing mercury, by the Castner-Kellner process. This manufacture is\r\nbeing carried on at Niagara, as well as in England. But electricity\r\nas a heating agent finds ever-extending application. Louis Moisson,\r\nprofessor at Paris, led the way by utilizing the enormous heat of\r\nthe ore in his electric furnace, thereby, among other interesting\r\nreactions, manufacturing diamonds, small, it is true, though none the\r\nless real. The use of electricity as a heating agent has received\r\nnew applications. Phosphorus is now made by distilling a mixture of\r\nphosphates of lime and alumina with coke; a new polishing agent has\r\nbeen found in “carborundum,” a compound of carbon and silicon, produced\r\nby heating in an electric furnace a mixture of sand and coke; and\r\ncyanide of potassium, almost indispensable for the extraction of gold\r\nfrom ores poor in gold, is now manufactured by heating a mixture of\r\ncarbon and carbonate of barium in an electric furnace in a current\r\nof carbon monoxide. These are but some of the instances in which\r\nelectricity has been adopted as an agent in effecting chemical changes;\r\nand it may be confidently predicted that the earlier years of the\r\ntwentieth century will witness a great development in this direction.\r\nIt may be pointed out that the later developments of industrial\r\nchemistry owe their success entirely to the growth of chemical theory;\r\nand it is obvious that that nation which possesses the most competent\r\nchemists, theoretical and practical, is destined to succeed in the\r\ncompetition with other nations for commercial supremacy and all its\r\nconcomitant advantages.\r\n\r\n            WILLIAM RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHÆOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write of the progress of archæology in this century is scarcely\r\npossible, as the idea of the subject was unknown a hundred years ago;\r\nit is, therefore, the whole history of its opening and development\r\nthat we have to deal with. The conception of the history of man being\r\npreserved to us in material facts, and not only in written words, was\r\nquite disregarded until the growth of geology had taught men to read\r\nnature for themselves, instead of trusting to the interpretations\r\nformed by their ancestors. Even down to the present the academic view\r\nis that classical archæology is more important than other branches,\r\nbecause it serves to illustrate classical literature. Looked at as\r\narchæology, it is, on the contrary, the least important branch, because\r\nwe already know so much more of the classical ages than we do of others.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the present generation that it has been realized that\r\nwherever man has lived he has left the traces of his action, and that\r\na systematic and observant study of those remains will interpret to us\r\nwhat his life was, what his abilities and tastes were, and the extent\r\nand nature of his mind. Literature is but one branch of the archæology\r\nof the higher races; another—equally important for the understanding\r\nof man—is art; these two give the highest and most complex and\r\ncharacteristic view of the nature of a race. At the opposite end of the\r\nscale are the rudest stone weapons which remain as the sole traces of\r\nthe savages who used them. These highest and lowest evidences of mind,\r\nand all that lies between them, are the domain of archæology.\r\n\r\nWe now purpose to review the growth of archæology in contact with\r\ngeology, where it concerns man as the last of the links of life on the\r\nglobe; and then to notice the archæology of each country in turn, as\r\nit leads on to the times of historical record, and so passes down to\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nA century ago the world of thought was divided between the old and new\r\nideas very differently from what is now the case. Then there stood on\r\none side the idea of a special creation of an individual man, at 4000\r\nB. C.; the compression of all human history into a prehistoric age\r\nof about three thousand years, and a fairly logical solution of most\r\nof the difficulties of understanding in a comfortable teleology. On\r\nthe other hand stood many who felt the inherent improbability of such\r\nsolutions of the problem of life, and who were feeling their way to\r\nsome more workable theory on the basis of Laplace, Lamarck, Erasmus\r\nDarwin, and others; vaguely mingling together questions of physics,\r\ngeology, archæology, anthropology, and theology, each of which we\r\nnow see must be treated on its own basis, and be decided on internal\r\nevidence, before we can venture to let it affect our judgment on other\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe great new force which thrust itself in to divide and decide on\r\nthese questions is the scientific study of man and his works. Strangely\r\nshaped flints had been noticed, but no one had any knowledge of their\r\nage. One such, when found with the bones of a mammoth, was attributed\r\nto the Roman age, because no person could have brought elephants into\r\nBritain except some Roman general. The argument was excellent and\r\nirrefutable until geology found plenty more remains of the mammoth and\r\nshowed that it was here long before the Romans. It was less than half\r\na century ago that our eyes began to open to the abundant remains of\r\nflint-using man. Then a single rude stone weapon was an unexplained\r\ncuriosity; now an active collector will put together his tens of\r\nthousands of specimens, will know exactly where they were found, their\r\nrelation of age and of purpose, and their bearing on the history of man.\r\n\r\nNot only have worked flint implements been found in the river gravels\r\nof France and England, where they were first noticed in the middle of\r\nthis century, but also in most parts of Europe, in Egypt on the high\r\ndesert, in Somaliland, at the Cape of Good Hope, in India, America, and\r\nother countries; and the most striking feature is the exact similarity\r\nin form wherever they have been found. So precisely do the same types\r\nrecur, so impossible would it be to say from its form whether a flint\r\nhad been found in Europe, Asia, or Africa, that it appears as if the\r\nart of working had spread from some single centre over the rest of the\r\nworld. This is especially the case with the river-gravel flints—the\r\nearlier class—usually called Paleolithic. Soon after the general\r\ndivision had been made between polished stone-work of the later or\r\nNeolithic times, found on the surface, and the rough chipped work of\r\nthe earlier or Paleolithic times, found in geological deposits, a\r\nfurther sub-division was made by separating the Paleolithic age into\r\nthat of the river gravels and that of the cave-dwellers. The latter has\r\nagain been divided into three classes by French writers, named, from\r\ntheir localities, _Mousterien_, _Solutrien_, _Magdalenien_; and, though\r\nthese classes may be much influenced by locality, they probably have\r\nsome difference of age between them.\r\n\r\nAnd now within the last few years a still earlier kind of workmanship\r\nhas been recognized in flints found in England on the high hills in\r\nKent. Though at first much disputed, the human origin of the forms is\r\nnow generally acknowledged, and they show a far ruder ability than\r\neven the most massive of the Paleolithic forms. The position also of\r\nthese flints, in river deposits lying on the highest hills some six\r\nhundred feet above the present rivers, shows that the whole of the\r\nvalleys has been excavated since they were deposited, and implies a far\r\ngreater age than any of the gravel beds of the Paleolithic ages.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, have passed now at the beginning of this century to\r\na far wider view of man’s history, and classify his earlier ages in\r\nEurope thus:\r\n\r\n    First—Eolithic: Rudest massive flints from deposits 600 feet up.\r\n\r\n    Second—Paleolithic: Massive flints from gravels 200 feet up and\r\n    less (Achuleen).\r\n\r\n    Third—Paleolithic—Cave-dwellers: Flints like the preceding and\r\n    flakes (Mousterien).\r\n\r\n    Fourth—Paleolithic—Cave-dwellers: Flints well worked and finely\r\n    shaped (Solutrien).\r\n\r\n    Fifth—Paleolithic—Cave-dwellers: Abundant bone working and\r\n    drawing (Magdalenien).\r\n\r\n    Sixth—Neolithic: Polished flint working, pastoral and\r\n    agricultural man.\r\n\r\nWhat time these periods cover nothing yet proves. The date of 4000\r\nB. C. for man’s appearance, with which belief the nineteenth century\r\nstarted, has been pushed back by one discovery after another. Estimates\r\nof from 10,000 to 200,000 years have been given from various possible\r\nclews. In Egypt an exposure of 7000 years or more only gives a faint\r\nbrown tint to flints lying side by side with Paleolithic flints that\r\nare black with age. I incline to think that 100,000 years B. C. for the\r\nrise of the second class, and 10,000 B. C. for the rise of the sixth\r\nclass will be a moderate estimate.\r\n\r\nPassing now from Paleolithic man of the latest geological times whose\r\nworks lie under the deposit of ages, to Neolithic man of surface\r\nhistory whose polished stone tools lie on the ground, we find also how\r\ngreatly views have changed. For ages past metal-using man has looked\r\non the beautifully polished or chipped weapons of his forefathers as\r\n“thunderbolts,” possessing magic powers, and he often mounted the\r\nsmaller ones to wear as charms. At the beginning of this century\r\nwell-finished stone weapons were only preserved as curiosities which\r\nmight belong to some remote age, but without any definite ideas about\r\nthem. The recognition of long ages of earlier unpolished stone work has\r\nnow put these more elaborate specimens to a comparatively late period,\r\nand yet they are probably older than the date to which our forefathers\r\nplaced the creation of man.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a more intelligent knowledge of such things was laid\r\nby the systematic excavations of the burial mounds scattered over the\r\nsouth of England, which was done in the early part of this century by\r\nSir Richard Colt Hoare. A solid basis of facts was laid, which began\r\nto supersede the romances woven by Stukeley and others in the last\r\ncentury. Gradually more exact methods of search were introduced, and in\r\nthe last thirty years Canon Greenwell has done much, and General Pitt\r\nRivers has established a standard of accurate and complete work with\r\nperfect recording, which is the highest development of archæological\r\nstudy. These and other researches have opened up the life of Neolithic\r\nman to us, and we see that he was much as modern man, if compared\r\nwith the earlier stage of man as a hunter. The Neolithic man made\r\npottery, spun and wove linen, constructed enormous earthworks both for\r\ndefence and for burial, and systematically made his tools of the best\r\nmaterial he could obtain by combined labor in mining. The extensive\r\nflint-mines in chalk districts of England show long-continued labor;\r\nand the perfect form and splendid finish of many of the stone weapons\r\nshow that skilled leisure could be devoted to them, and that æsthetic\r\ntaste had been developed. The large camps prove that a thorough tribal\r\norganization prevailed, though probably confined to small clans.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century a new type of dwelling began to be\r\nexplored—the lake dwelling; this system of building towns upon piles\r\nin lakes had the great advantage of protection from enemies and wild\r\nbeasts, and a constant supply of food in the fish that could be hooked\r\nfrom the water below. Though such settlements were first found in the\r\nSwiss lakes, and explored there by Keller, they have since been found\r\nin France, Hungary, Italy, Holland, and the British Isles. The earlier\r\nsettlements of this form belong to the Neolithic age, but only in\r\ncentral Europe. In these earliest lake dwellings weaving was known,\r\nand the cultivation of flax, grapes, and other fruit and corn; while\r\nthe usual domestic animals were kept and cattle were yoked to the\r\nplough; pottery was abundant, and was often ornamented with geometric\r\npatterns. The type of man was round-headed. Following the Neolithic\r\nlake dwellings came those of the Bronze age, and as the bronze objects\r\nare similar to those found in other kinds of dwellings we shall notice\r\nthem in the Bronze age in general. The type of man was longer-headed\r\nthan in the earlier lake settlement. The domestication of animals shows\r\nan advance; the horse was common, and the dog, ox, pig, and sheep were\r\ngreatly improved. Pottery was better made and elaborately decorated,\r\noften with strips of tin-foil.\r\n\r\nThe Bronze age marks a great step in man’s history. In many countries\r\nthe use of copper, hardened by arsenic or oxide, was common for long\r\nbefore the alloy of copper and tin was used. In other countries,\r\nwhere the use of metals was imported, copper only appears as a native\r\nimitation of the imported bronze. Hence there is a true age of copper\r\nin lands where the use of metals has grown. It must by no means be\r\nsupposed that copper excluded the use of flint; it was not until bronze\r\nbecame common that flint was disused. The existence of a Bronze age\r\nwas first formulated, as distinct from a Stone age, about seventy years\r\nago; and the existence of a Copper age has been much disputed in the\r\nlast thirty years, but has only been proved clearly ten years ago, in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the bronze weapons found in England were\r\nattributed to the Romans by some writers, though others, with more\r\nreason, argued that they were British. In the first year of the\r\ncentury began the comparative study of such weapons with reference to\r\nmodern savage products. The development of the metal forms from stone\r\nprototypes was pointed out in 1816; the tracing out of the succession\r\nof the forms and the modes of use appeared in 1847. Further study\r\ncleared up the details, and within the last twenty years the full\r\nknowledge of the Bronze age in other countries has left no question as\r\nto the general facts of the sequence of its history. In each type of\r\ntool and weapon there appears first a very simple form imitated from\r\nthe stone implements which were earlier used. Gradually the facilities\r\ngiven by the casting and toughness of the metal were used, and the\r\nforms were modified; ornamentation was added, and thin work in embossed\r\npatterns gave the stiffness and strength which had been attained before\r\nby massive forms. The general types are the axe—first a plain slip of\r\nmetal, later developed with a socket; then the chisel, gouge, sickle,\r\nknife, dagger, sword, spear, and shield; personal objects, as pins,\r\nnecklets, bracelets, ear-rings, buttons, buckles, and domestic caldrons\r\nand cups. Most of these forms were found together, all worn out and\r\nbroken, in the great bronze-founder’s hoard at Bologna.\r\n\r\nLastly in the prehistory of Europe comes the Iron age, which so much\r\nbelongs to the historical period that we can best consider it in\r\nnoticing separate countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the recent discoveries in Egypt we can gain some idea of the date\r\nof these periods. We ventured to assign about 10,000 B. C. for the rise\r\nof the Neolithic or polished-stone period (it may very possibly be\r\nearlier); the beginning of the use of copper may be placed about 5000\r\nB. C.; the beginning of bronze was perhaps 3000 or 2000 B. C., as its\r\nfree use in Egypt is not till 1600 B. C.; and the use of iron beginning\r\nabout 1000 B. C., probably in Armenia, spreading thence through Europe\r\nuntil it reached Italy, perhaps 700 years B. C., and Britain about 400\r\nB. C. Such is the briefest outline of the greater part of the history\r\nof man, massed together in one general term of “prehistoric,” before we\r\nreach the little fringe of history nearest to our own age. The whole of\r\nthis knowledge results from the work of the century.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the historical ages of each of the principal countries,\r\nto review what advance has been made even where a basis of written\r\nrecord has come down to us, equally accessible in all recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century Egypt was a land of untouched and\r\ninexplicable mystery; the hieroglyphics were wondered at, and puzzled\r\nover, without any idea of how they were to be read, whether as symbols\r\nor as letters. The history was entirely derived from the confused\r\naccounts of Greek authors, the lists remaining of Manetho’s history,\r\nwritten about 260 B. C., and the allusions in the Bible. The attempt to\r\nmake everything fit to the ideas of the Greeks, and to make everything\r\nrefer to the Biblical history, greatly retarded the understanding of\r\nthe monuments, and is scarcely overcome yet. The first great step\r\nforward was when an inscription was found at Rosetta, in 1799, written\r\nin two methods, the monumental hieroglyphic and the popular demotic,\r\nalong with a Greek version. By 1802 some groups of each writing had\r\nbeen translated. Young identified more signs, and Gell, by 1822, could\r\nsuccessfully apportion three-quarters of the signs to the Greek words.\r\nThe next step was to apply the modern Coptic language, descended from\r\nthe ancient Egyptian, to the reading of the words. Gell had been doing\r\nso, but it needed a student of Coptic—Champollion—to carry this out\r\nthoroughly, as he did in 1821–32. Since then advance in reading has\r\nbeen only a matter of detail, not requiring any new principles.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the art began with the admiration for the debased work\r\nof Roman times, the principal interest at the beginning of the century.\r\nThen the excavations among the Rameside monuments at Thebes, about\r\n1820–30, took attention back to the age of 1500–1000 B. C. The work of\r\nLepsius, and later of Mariette, from 1840–80, opened men’s eyes to the\r\nsplendid work of the early dynasties, about 4000–3000 B. C. And lastly\r\nthe excavations of 1893–99 have fascinated scholars by a view of the\r\nrise of the civilization and the prehistoric period before 5000 B. C.\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of the century the archæology of Egypt lay\r\nuntouched; all attention was given to the language; and even Gardner\r\nWilkinson’s fine view of the civilization (1837) depended largely on\r\nGreek authors, and had no perspective of history in tracing changes and\r\ndevelopment. It is only in the last ten or fifteen years that any exact\r\nknowledge has been acquired about the rise and progress of the various\r\narts of life; this study now enables us to date the sculpture, metal\r\nwork, pottery, and other art products as exactly as we can those of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe view that we now have of the rise and decay of this great\r\ncivilization and its connection with other lands is more complete and\r\nfar-reaching than that of any other country. In the early undated\r\nage, before the monarchy which began about 4800 B. C., a flourishing\r\ncivilization was spread over upper Egypt. Towns were built of brick,\r\nas in later times; clothing was made of woven linen and of leather;\r\npottery was most skilfully formed, without the potter’s wheel,\r\nhand-made, yet of exquisite regularity and beauty of outline, while the\r\nvariety of form is perhaps greater than in any other land; stone vases\r\nwere made entirely by hand, without a lathe, as perfect in form as the\r\npottery, and of the hardest rocks, as diorite and granite; wood was\r\ncarved for furniture; the art of colored glazing was common, and was\r\neven applied to glazing over large carvings in rock crystal; ornaments\r\nand beads were wrought of various stones and precious metals; ivory\r\ncombs with carved figures adorned the hair; ivory spoons were used\r\nat the table; finely formed weapons and tools of copper served where\r\nstrength was needful, while more useful were flint knives and lances\r\nwhich were wrought with a miraculous finish that has never been reached\r\nby any other people; and games were played with dainty pieces made of\r\nhard stone and of ivory. But all this tasteful skill of 6000–5000 B. C.\r\nhad its negative side; in the artistic copying of nature the mechanical\r\nskill of these people carried them a very little way; their figures and\r\nheads of men and animals are strangely crude. And they had no system\r\nof writing, although marks were commonly used. They always buried the\r\nbody doubled up, and often preserved the head and hands separately.\r\nCommerce was already active, and large rowing-galleys carried the wares\r\nof different countries around the Mediterranean. These people were the\r\nsame as the modern Kabyle, of Algeria, and akin to the South European\r\nraces, but with some negro admixture. Our whole knowledge of this age\r\nhas only been gained within the last five years.\r\n\r\nAt about 5000 B. C. there poured into Egypt a very different people,\r\nprobably from the Red Sea. Having far more artistic taste, a commoner\r\nuse of metals, a system of writing already begun, and a more organized\r\ngovernment, these fresh people started a new civilization in Egypt;\r\nadopting readily the art and skill of the earlier race, they formed by\r\ntheir union the peculiar culture known as Egyptian, a type which lasted\r\nfor four thousand years. The same foundation of a type is seen in the\r\nbodily structure; the early historical people had wider heads and more\r\nslender noses than the prehistoric, but from 4000 B. C. down to Roman\r\ntimes the form shows no change.\r\n\r\nFrom this union of two able races came one of the finest peoples ever\r\nseen, the Egyptians of the old kingdom, 4500—3500 B. C. Full of grand\r\nconceptions, active, able, highly mechanical, and yet splendid artists,\r\nthey have left behind them the greatest masses of building, the most\r\naccurate workmanship and exquisite sculptures in the grand pyramids\r\nand tombs of their cemeteries. They perfected the art of organizing\r\ncombined labor on the immense public works. In all these respects\r\nno later age or country has advanced beyond this early ability. The\r\nmoral character and ideas are preserved to us in the writings of these\r\npeople; and we there read of the ability, reserve, steadfastness, and\r\nkindliness which we see reflected in the lifelike portraiture of that\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAfter a partial decay about 3000 B. C. this civilization blossomed out\r\nagain nobly in the twelfth dynasty about 2600 B. C.; though the works\r\nof this age hardly reach the high level of the earlier times, yet they\r\nare finer than anything that followed them. At this period more contact\r\nwith other countries is seen; both Syria and the Mediterranean were\r\nknown, though imperfectly.\r\n\r\nTo this succeeded another decadence, sealed by the disaster of the\r\nforeign invasion of the Hyksos. But this was thrown off by the rise of\r\na third age of brilliance—the eighteenth dynasty, 1500 B. C.—which,\r\nthough inferior to early times in its highest work, yet shines by the\r\nwidespread of art and luxury throughout the upper classes. Magnificence\r\nbecame fashionable, and the lower classes contented themselves with\r\nmost barefaced imitations of costly wares. Foreign islands came\r\nclosely in contact with Egypt. The ships of the Syrian coast and\r\nCyprus continually traded to and fro, exchanging silver, copper, and\r\nprecious stones for the gold of Egypt. Greece also traded its fine\r\npottery of the Mycenæan age for the showy necklaces of gold and the\r\nrings and amulets with names of Pharaohs. Egypt then dominated the\r\nshores of the western Mediterranean, the plains of the Euphrates, and\r\nthe fertile Soudan. But this power and wealth led to disaster. Like\r\nRome, later on, she could not resist the temptation to live on plunder;\r\nheavy tribute of corn was exacted, large numbers were employed in\r\nunproductive labor, and national disaster was the natural consequence.\r\nEgypt never recovered the dominion or the splendor that were hers in\r\nthis age. Of this period some slight notions are given us from literary\r\nremains in the Bible and Greek authors; but archæology is, so far, our\r\nonly practical guide, as in the earlier ages. The great temples and\r\nmonuments of the eighteenth-twentieth dynasties (1600–1100 B. C.) bear\r\nhundreds of historical inscriptions, the tombs are covered with scenes\r\nof private life, the burials and the ruins of towns furnish us with all\r\nthe objects of daily use. This age is one of the fullest and richest\r\nin all history, and hardly any other is better known even in Greece or\r\nItaly. Yet all this has been brought to light in the century, and the\r\nknowledge of the foreign relations of Egypt is entirely the result of\r\nthe last fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe final thousand years of the civilization of Egypt is checkered\r\nwith many changes; sometimes independent, as in the ages of Shishak\r\nof Necho, and of the Ptolemies; at other times a prey to Ethiopians,\r\nPersians, Greeks, or Romans. Its arts and crafts show a constant decay,\r\nand there was but little left to resist the influence of Greek taste\r\nand design, which ran a debased course in the country. There was,\r\nhowever, a spread of manufactures and of cheap luxuries into lower and\r\nlower classes; and the wealth of the country accumulated under the\r\nbeneficent rule of the earlier Ptolemies (300–200 B. C.).\r\n\r\nThe principal discoveries about these later ages have been in the\r\npapyri, which have been largely found during the last twenty years.\r\nThe details of the government and life of the country in the Ptolemaic\r\n(305–30 B. C.) and Roman (30 B. C.–640 A. D.) periods have been cleared\r\nup; and many prizes of classical literature have also been recovered.\r\nThe archæology of the Middle Ages in Egypt has also been studied.\r\nMany of the Arabic buildings have been recently cleaned and put in\r\ngood condition, and the splendid collection of manuscripts in Cairo\r\nhas opened a view of the beautiful art of the thirteenth-fifteenth\r\ncenturies so closely akin to what was done in Europe at the same time.\r\n\r\nEgypt is, then, before all other lands, the country of archæology. A\r\ncontinuous history of seven thousand years, with abundant remains of\r\nevery period to illustrate it, and a rich prehistoric age before that,\r\ngive completeness to the study and the fullest value to archæological\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESOPOTAMIA\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Euphrates might well rival that of the Nile if it\r\nwere scientifically explored, but unhappily all the excavation has been\r\ndone solely with a view to inscription and sculpture, and no proper\r\nrecord has been made, nor have any towns been examined, the only work\r\nbeing in palaces and temples.\r\n\r\nThe earliest study on the ground was by Rich (1818–20), who gathered\r\nsome few sculptures and formed an idea of Assyrian art. The French\r\nConsul, Botta, excavated Khorsabad (founded 700 B. C.) in 1834–35, and\r\nLayard excavated Nimrud in 1845–47; these were both Assyrian sites.\r\nThe older Babylonian civilization was touched at Erech by Loftus, in\r\n1849–52; and this age has attracted the most important excavations\r\nmade since, at Tello by Sarzec (1876–81), and at Nippur by Peters and\r\nHaynes, of Philadelphia, during the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe cuneiform characters were absolutely unexplained until Grotefend,\r\nin 1800, resolved several of them by taking inscriptions which he\r\npresumed might contain names of Persian kings and comparing them\r\nalongside of the known names; thus—without a single fixed point to\r\nstart from—he tried a series of hypotheses until he found one which\r\nfitted the facts. Bournouf (in 1836) and Lassen (1836–44) rectified and\r\ncompleted the alphabet. But the cuneiform signs were used to write many\r\ndiverse languages, as the Roman alphabet is used at present; and the\r\nshort Persian alphabet was only a fraction of the great syllabary of\r\nsix hundred signs used for Assyrian. Rawlinson had independently made\r\nout the Persian alphabet, using the Zend and Sanskrit for the language.\r\nHe next, from the trilingual Behistun inscription in Persian, Assyrian,\r\nand Vannic, resolved the long Assyrian syllabary, using Hebrew for the\r\nlanguage. Since then other more obscure languages written in cuneiform\r\nhave been worked with more or less success; the most important is\r\nthe Turanian language, used by the earlier inhabitants of Babylonia\r\nbefore the Semitic invasion; this is recorded by many syllabaries and\r\ndictionaries, and translations compiled by the literary Semitic kings.\r\n\r\nThe general view of the civilization which has been obtained by these\r\nlabors of the century shows it to have been more important to the\r\nworld than any other. Cuneiform was the literary script of the world\r\nfor at least six thousand years, the only medium of writing from the\r\nMediterranean to the Indian Ocean. The Babylonian culture was almost\r\ncertainly the source of the oldest present civilization—that of China.\r\nAnd the arts were developed probably even earlier than in Egypt. The\r\nfirst inhabitants were called Sumirian (or river folk) in distinction\r\nfrom the Accadian (or highland) people, who came from Elam down into\r\nthe Euphrates valley, bringing with them the use of writing. Their\r\nearliest writing was of figure symbols (like the Egyptian and Hittite);\r\nbut as in the valley clay tablets were the only material for writing,\r\nthe figures became gradually transformed into groups of straight lines\r\nand spots impressed on the clay; hence the signs were formalized into\r\nwhat we call cuneiform. The Semitic invaders were using cuneiform\r\ncharacters by about 3000 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe early civilization was intensely religious, the main buildings\r\nbeing the temples, which were placed on enormous piles of brick-work.\r\nThe sculpture was at a high level in the time of Naram-Sinn, about\r\n3750 B. C.; and yet below his ruins at Nippur there are no less than\r\nthirty-five feet depth of earlier ruins, which must extend back to\r\n6000 or 7000 B. C. In early times stone implements were used alongside\r\nof copper and bronze, as we find in Egypt 4000 B. C. Pottery was well\r\nmade, and also reliefs in terra-cotta. Personal ornaments of engraved\r\ngems and gold-work were common.\r\n\r\nThe main landmarks in the later time of this civilization are the\r\nElamite invasion of Kudur-nan-khundi (2280 B. C.) which upset the\r\nSemitic rulers, and the Assyrian invasion of Tiglath-Adar (1270\r\nB. C.), after which interest centres in the Assyrian kingdom and its\r\ndevelopment of the Mesopotamian culture which it borrowed. The main\r\nbuildings of the Assyrian kings were their enormous palaces, the mass\r\nof which was of unbaked bricks, faced with alabaster slabs; such were\r\nthe works of Assurnazir-pal (Nimrud, 880 B. C.), Sargon (Khorsabad,\r\n710 B. C.), Sennacherib and Assurbani-pal (Kouyunjik, 700 B. C.). The\r\nlater, Assyrian, form of the civilization was to the earlier Chaldean\r\nmuch what Rome was to Greece, a rather clumsy borrower, who laboriously\r\npreserved the literature and art. Some of the Assyrian sculpture\r\nof animals is, however, perhaps unsurpassed for vivid action. The\r\nsystematic libraries, containing copies of all the older literature\r\nfor general study, were most creditable, though the Assyrian himself\r\ncomposed nothing better than chronicles. Nearly all that we possess\r\nof Babylonian religion, and much of the history, is in the copies\r\nscrupulously made from the ancient tablets by the Assyrian scribes, who\r\nnoted every defect in the original with critical fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe Mesopotamian civilization has left its mark on the modern world.\r\nIts religion greatly influenced Hebrew, and thence Christian, thought,\r\nthe psalms, for instance, being a Babylonian form of piety. Its science\r\nfixed the signs of the zodiac, the months of the year, the days of the\r\nweek, and the division of the circle in degrees, all of which are now\r\nuniversal. And its art, carried by the Phœnicians, was copied by the\r\nGreeks and Etruscans, and thus passed on into modern design.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRIA\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of Palestine was but slight, and of northern Syria\r\nnothing to speak of, a century ago. Travellers with some scientific\r\nability, such as Robinson (1838 and 1852), De Saulcy (1853), and\r\nVan de Velde (1854), greatly extended our view and led up to the\r\nsplendid survey by the Palestine Exploration Fund (1866 and on), which\r\nexhausted the surface study of the land. The more archæological work of\r\nexcavation was begun at Jerusalem (1867–70), and resumed (1892–99) at\r\nLachish, Jerusalem, etc. The topographical results are all important,\r\nand leave nothing to be done until excavation can be freely applied;\r\nand the small amount of digging yet done has fixed the varieties of\r\npottery back to 2000 B. C. and given some early architecture. But the\r\nruins of Syria, and indeed of Turkey in general, are practically yet\r\nuntouched. The discovery (1868) of the inscription of Mesha, King of\r\nMoab (896 B. C.), opened a new prospect of research which cannot yet\r\nbe entered upon. In the north of Syria nothing has been done except\r\nthe German work at Singerli, from which came an Aramean inscription of\r\nabout 740 B. C. And in the south a large number of early inscriptions\r\nof the Arabian dynasties, reaching back some centuries B. C., have been\r\ncopied; but there, also, excavation is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe main new light from Syria has been on the Hittite power.\r\nBurckhardt, in 1812, had noticed a new kind of hieroglyph at Hamath.\r\nAfter several ineffective copies, Wright made casts of the stones\r\nin 1872. Several other such inscriptions have been found, and from\r\nthese and the Egyptian and Assyrian references to the Hittites we now\r\nrealize that they were a northern people, with a great capital on the\r\nEuphrates, at Karkhemish, and ruling over nearly all Syria and Asia\r\nMinor. Little has yet been fixed about the writing; a few signs are\r\nread and some have passed into the Cypriote alphabet. A striking proof\r\nof the spread of Babylonian culture is seen in the tablets found in\r\nEgypt at Tel-el-Amarna in 1887, which show that all the correspondence\r\nbetween Egypt and Syria in the fifteenth century B. C. was carried on\r\nin cuneiform. These hundreds of letters give a vivid picture of life in\r\nSyria at that early date.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE\r\n\r\nThe revival of interest in Greek civilization was at first purely\r\nliterary, and remained so during two or three centuries. But during the\r\nlast century various travellers and residents abroad made collections\r\nwhich awoke an interest in the art; and though most of these collectors\r\nwere content with merely showy sculpture, greatly restored and\r\nfalsified for the market, yet some—such as Hamilton—took a real\r\narchæological interest in the unearthing and collecting of ancient art.\r\nThe condition of study at the end of the eighteenth century was that\r\nmany private men of wealth had bought large quantities of sculpture\r\nwhich was but little understood, and looked on more from a decorative\r\nthan a scientific point of view, while there were the beginnings of a\r\nserious appreciation of it which had been just laid down by Winckelmann.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century opened with a grand work of publishing the\r\nprincipal treasures of classical art in England, which was finally\r\nissued in 1809 by Payne, Knight, and Townley; this marks the highest\r\npoint of the dilettante collecting spirit, which was soon eclipsed by\r\ntruer knowledge. Hitherto the best sculpture had hardly been known but\r\nat second hand through Roman copies; a closer acquaintance began with\r\nthe travels of Dodwell, Gell, and Leake, all in the first decade of\r\nthe century. The free opening of the British Museum, in 1805, and the\r\naccumulation there of all the best collections within the first quarter\r\nof the century, also served to educate a public taste. The first\r\nstruggle of scientific and artistic knowledge against the dilettante\r\nspirit was over the Elgin marbles; by 1816 they were accepted as the\r\nmasterpieces which all later criticism has proved them to be. The\r\nÆginetan and Phigaleian sculptures, brought to Munich and London,\r\nhelped also to show the nobility of early Greek art; so that the last\r\ntwo generations have had a canon of taste to rely upon, the value of\r\nwhich cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this noble foundation, other collectors worked in\r\nGreece and Asia Minor, and the British Museum profited by the\r\nlabors of Burgon, Fellows, and Woodhouse between 1840 and 1860. The\r\ndiplomatically supported work of Newton on the Mausoleum (1857–58),\r\nand Wood at Ephesus (1863–75), filled out our knowledge of the middle\r\nperiod of Greek art (350 B. C.). Comparatively little has been done\r\nsince then by England, but the activity of the Germans at Olympia\r\nhas given us the only original masterpiece that is known—the Hermes\r\nof Praxiteles (350 B. C.), and their work at Pergamon revealed the\r\ngreat altar belonging to the later age (180 B. C.). The excavations\r\nat Athens (in 1886) have produced the impressive statues dedicated to\r\nAthene about 520 B. C., which reveal the noble rise of Attic sculpture.\r\nBut attention during the last quarter-century has been largely fixed\r\nupon the earlier ages. The discoveries of Schliemann at Hissarlik\r\n(Troy, 1870–82), Mycenæ (1876), Orchomenos (1880–81), and Tiryns\r\n(1884), opened a new world of thought and research. Though at first\r\nbitterly attacked, it is now agreed that these discoveries show us the\r\ncivilization of Greece between 2000 and 1000 B. C. Lastly, during ten\r\nyears past Egypt has provided the solid chronology for prehistoric\r\nGreece by discoveries of trade between the two countries.\r\n\r\nWe can now very briefly estimate the present position of our knowledge\r\nas gained during the century. Setting aside the early foreign pottery\r\nfound in Egypt, which belongs probably to Greece or Italy at 5000 and\r\n3000 B. C., we first touch a civilized city in the lowest town of Troy,\r\nwhere metal was scarcely yet in use, which is certainly before 2000\r\nand probably about 3000 B. C. in date. Succeeding that is the finely\r\nbuilt second Troy, rich in gold vases and ornaments, which—though\r\nmistaken by Schliemann for the Homeric Troy—must yet be long before\r\nthat, probably before 2000 B. C. After the burning of that come three\r\nother rebuildings before we reach the town of the age of Mycenæ, about\r\n1500 B. C. Of this, which was in Greece the climax of the prehistoric\r\ncivilization, there are the splendid treasures found at Mycenæ, the\r\nmagnificent domed tombs, the abundance of fine jewelry and metal-work,\r\nof beautiful pottery and glazed ornament. To this age belong the\r\ngreat palaces of Mycenæ, Tiryns, Athens, and other hill fortresses,\r\nof which hardly more than the plans can now be traced. And it is this\r\ncivilization which traded eagerly with Egypt, exchanging the valued\r\nmanufactures of each country. This period was at its full bloom from\r\n1500–1200 B. C., and began to decay by 1100 B. C., this dating being\r\ngiven by the contact with Egypt.\r\n\r\nThis natural decadence of art in Greece was hastened by the invasion\r\nof the barbarous Dorians about 1000 B. C. Art, however, was by no\r\nmeans extinguished, but only repressed by the troubles of the age; and\r\nAthens, which was not conquered by the Dorians, was the main centre of\r\nthe revival of the arts. Other examples of such a history are familiar\r\nin Egypt (after the Hyksos invasion) and in Italy (after the Lombards),\r\nwhere earlier abilities revive and bloom afresh when vigorous invaders\r\nbecome united to an artistic stock. After the centuries of warfare\r\na quieter age allowed the growth of fine arts again in the seventh\r\ncentury B. C., largely influenced by Egyptian and Assyrian work at\r\nsecond hand, through the Greek settlements in Cyprus and Egypt. By\r\n600 B. C. definite types of sculpture were started, and a course\r\nwas begun which only ended in the fall of classical civilization.\r\nThe century before the Persian invasion, in 480 B. C., was one of\r\nrapid development; and in sculpture and vase-painting we see that\r\nthis century carried forward the arts to technical perfection and the\r\nhighest power of expression. Immediately after the Persian wars came\r\nthe supreme works of Pheidias and Myron, most familiar in the Parthenon\r\nand the Discobolus; and in vase-painting comes the reversal from vases\r\ndrawn in black on a red ground to the blocking out of the ground in\r\nblack, leaving the figure in red, thus giving far greater scope to the\r\nfilling in of finely drawn detail. The civilization of Athens was also\r\nat its height in this age, under Pericles, and the minor arts received\r\ntheir most refined and perfect treatment. After this comes nothing but\r\nripening to decay. It must always be remembered that we have but very\r\nfew examples of original work of the great artists. Nearly all the\r\nactual marbles preserved are copies made in later times, which show\r\nlittle of the delicacy of the original; and the few original marbles\r\nthat remain are mostly of unknown subjects by unknown men. The great\r\nwork in Greek archæology during the last fifty years has been comparing\r\nthe records of ancient art (in Pliny, Pausanias, etc.) with the\r\nremaining sculptures, critically assigning the various types of statues\r\nto their celebrated originals, and thus forming some idea of the real\r\nhistory of Greek art.\r\n\r\nFrom these studies, full of detail and controversy, we may briefly sum\r\nup the characteristics of the principal artists and their imitators. At\r\nabout 440 B. C. Pheidias showed in the Parthenon the highest expression\r\nof divine and mythic forms, in a simple and heroic style which was\r\nnever equalled. Half a century later Polykleitos followed a more human\r\nexpression, using motives (as in the Doryphoros), but yet portraying an\r\nabstract humanity. By 330 B. C. Praxiteles brought the expression of\r\nmoods to his works, graceful, animated, and with a full ripeness, as\r\nin the Hermes of Olympia, or the Faun. Skopas, slightly later, marked\r\nhis work by his great vigor and strong personality. This was the second\r\nturning-point, when ripeness passed into decay; and in Lysippos there\r\nis mere vivid naturalism and an impressionist manner without much soul\r\nor thought, as in his Apoxyomenos, about 330 B. C. After this mere\r\ntriviality and genre subjects are usual, portraiture is a common aim,\r\nand dignity was vainly striven for in colossal size. The glorification\r\nof showing dead and vanquished enemies is seen in the Dying Gaul and\r\nfigures of slain foes at Pergamon. Later on, about 180 B. C., we\r\nsee the violent, complicated, and straining action of the figures\r\naround the great altar of Pergamon, which also appears in the groups\r\nof the Laocoon and Farnese Bull. In the Græco-Roman age a conscious\r\nartificiality took the place of life and expression, as we see in the\r\nApollo Belvidere, the Venus di Medici, and the Farnese Hercules. Art\r\nwas saved in the first century A. D. by the devotion of portraiture,\r\nwhich gave a sense of reality and conviction which is entirely absent\r\nin the imaginative works. Lastly, a painstaking study and admiration of\r\nearlier works led, under the wealthy patronage of Hadrian (130 A. D.),\r\nto an eclectic revival which was wholly artificial, and passed away\r\nwithin a generation. We have fixed on sculpture as the most complete\r\nexpression of Greek art; in other directions there is neither enough\r\nmaterial nor enough research to give us a connected view. Not a single\r\ntown, hardly a single house, in Greece has been excavated; there is no\r\nconsecutive knowledge of the ordinary products and objects of life;\r\nand there is very little recorded of the discoveries of the tombs. The\r\nartistic interest of the sculpture and architecture has starved other\r\nbranches of archæology, and for Greece more remains to be done than for\r\nsome less celebrated lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY\r\n\r\nThe interest in Italy at the beginning of the nineteenth century was\r\nmainly for the sake of its second-hand version of Greek art, and for\r\nthe architecture and painting of the Renaissance. On the contrary, now\r\nthe objects from Greece itself have far eclipsed the Italian copies,\r\nand the interest lies in the early Italian civilization and its purely\r\nRoman derivatives; while modern taste values the mediæval art of Italy\r\nfar from the bastard products of the florid age which followed. The\r\nfirst detailed studies in Italy were those on Pompeii, especially by\r\nGell (1817), which made that debased style very popular, and paved the\r\nway for appreciation of better work. The various isolated discoveries\r\nof Etruscan tombs were summed up in the admirable work of Dennis\r\n(1848), which presented a general view of that civilization which has\r\nnot been superseded. The earlier Italic culture has been examined in\r\nmany places where accidental discoveries have revealed it during the\r\nlatter half of the nineteenth century, and especially in the systematic\r\nwork of Zannoni, at Bologna (1870–75), and of Orsi, lately, in Sicily.\r\nThe history of the city of Rome has been almost rewritten in the\r\nlast thirty years owing to the great changes of the new government;\r\nthese have been largely worked by Lanciani, and recorded by him and\r\nMiddleton. The view of Italian history at present begins in the Stone\r\nage, which has been well studied, and has links with the later periods,\r\nas in the general use of black pottery. The earliest metal objects are\r\nvery simple blades of daggers, found in graves, mingled with flint\r\narrow-heads and knives. The admirable Italian plan of preserving whole\r\nburials undisturbed in museums enables us to see these graves complete\r\nin the Kircherian Museum. A special branch of the early Bronze age\r\nlife was the system of lake dwellings (natural or artificially water\r\ngirt), which abound in the northern Italian lakes and over the plain\r\nof Lombardy. These towns (“terra mare”) are arranged on a rectangular\r\nplan, and form the earliest stage of many of the present cities. The\r\nfull development of the Bronze age civilization seems to have been\r\nlater than in Greece, at about 800 B. C., to which belong the great\r\ndiscoveries of tombs, weapons, and tools at Bologna, and the cemetery\r\nof Falerii.\r\n\r\nUpon all the native Italic civilization came an entirely different\r\ninfluence from the immigrant Etruscan. Traditionally coming from\r\nAsia Minor, he brought art and religion which had no relation to the\r\nItalic. The earliest Etruscan paintings are strongly northern in style,\r\ninfluenced by north European feeling (Veii). But soon the Etruscan\r\nborrowed largely from other races, from the Greek mainly, but also\r\nfrom Assyria and Egypt. Thus the fascinating problem in Italy is to\r\ndistinguish the various sources of Italic, Etruscan, Græco-Etruscan,\r\nOriental-Etruscan, and pure Greek, which are found in all degrees of\r\ncombination before Roman times, and which can still be traced through\r\nthe Roman age. The characteristics of Etruscan taste are: (1) The\r\nextraneous objects and figures, such as rows of pendants to a metal\r\nvase, monstrous heads standing out from a bowl, and statuettes placed\r\nfor handles; (2) in forms of vases and furniture, the combination of\r\nmany different parts and curves which never form a whole design; (3)\r\nand in sculpture the large round head and staring eyes. In general, an\r\nair of clumsy adaptation by a race deficient in originality. The glory\r\nof the Etruscan was his engineering, which he handed as a legacy to\r\nRome. Strange to say, although thousands of Etruscan inscriptions are\r\nknown, and many words are translated, yet the language is sealed to us,\r\nand none of the many attempts to read it has succeeded. The scientific\r\nstudy of Etruscan tombs has been well followed lately, as shown in the\r\nFlorence Museum, where a separate room is devoted to each city.\r\n\r\nIn the south of Italy Greek art prevailed, and many of the finest\r\nworks belong to this civilization. The Greek in Italy had rather\r\ndifferent ideals to those of Greece; he started more from the level\r\nof Polykleitos and Praxiteles than from the severe age; his favorite\r\ntype is that of youth and adolescence, never of maturity. The grace and\r\nfeeling of such bronze statues as the Hermes and so-called Sappho of\r\nHerculaneum are peculiar to southern Italy. And when the Greek artist\r\npenetrated north and allied himself with the mechanical skill of the\r\nEtruscan, such splendid work was done as the Orator of Sanguineto.\r\n\r\nRome in the earlier centuries was an Italic town which came under\r\nEtruscan influence as Tuscany was conquered. But from the age of\r\nforeign conquest in the first century B. C., Greek art in a debased\r\nform ruled over all else, and ran into utter degradation in the third\r\ncentury A. D. It was this art that the power of Rome spread around the\r\nwhole Mediterranean, from Palmyra to Britain, and is the parent of most\r\nmodern decoration. But in the great reconstruction of the empire under\r\nDiocletian the debased Greek taste was mostly shaken off, and Rome\r\nwent back to the old Italic-Etruscan style and motives. The statues\r\nhave the round heads and staring eyes of old Etruria; the taste for\r\nquaint accessories, such as lions supporting objects, came back and\r\npassed into mediæval art, and the exaggerated, lengthy forms of men and\r\nanimals reappeared.\r\n\r\nOf the Christian period De Rossi’s work in the catacombs has given\r\na firm base of facts for the third to the sixth century A. D., the\r\nactual tomb and body of Saint Cecilia being the most striking result.\r\nThe later Roman and mediæval age in Italy is full of interest, but in\r\nthat—as in the rest of mediæval Europe—research has been mainly on\r\narchitecture and objects which are not the result of excavation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\nThe Hindus have never been chronologists or historians, and their\r\ngreat Sanskrit literature tells practically nothing about the rise of\r\nBuddhism, the invasion of Alexander, or the spread of civilization in\r\nIndo-China. All before the Islamic conquest in the tenth century A. D.\r\nis in a mist of Puranic mythology. Here, then, more than in other\r\ncountries, archæology has restored the history, and done so entirely\r\nwithin the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Sanskrit literature was revealed to the West by Sir\r\nWilliam Jones at the end of the last century, and this gave scope to\r\nOriental scholars, while antiquities only interested the collector. But\r\nserious exploration was led by Prinsep, whose decipherment of the Asoka\r\ninscriptions in 1837, which ranks with the achievements of Champollion\r\nand Rawlinson, gave the key to a mass of inscriptions.\r\n\r\nHis assistant, Cunningham, excavated many sites and collected coins,\r\nbeing head of the Archæological Survey from 1861 to 1885. Fergusson\r\nwas the historian of Indian architecture; Burgess has published the\r\ncave-temples in west and south India; Sewell in Madras and Führer in\r\nthe northwest have excavated and explored, and a few native pundits\r\nhave been educated to such research. The government, in financial\r\ndifficulty, has withdrawn from the work, but the congress of\r\nOrientalists in 1897 resolved to establish an Indian exploration fund.\r\n\r\nInscriptions abound in India, on copper plate, stone pillars, and\r\nnative rock. Those in Sanskrit, or modern vernaculars, are records of\r\nland grants or local dynasties. The oldest—in two different alphabets\r\n(of Semitic origin)—are the famous edicts of Asoka (third century\r\nB. C.), who has been called The Buddhist Constantine. He placed these\r\nmonuments of his power and religion around his frontiers of northern\r\nIndia; but their meaning was forgotten until Prinsep’s decipherment.\r\nThe Hindus seem to have a coinage of stamped silver plate before\r\nAlexander; but regular coinage begins in the Bactrian kingdoms (200\r\nB. C.–200 A. D.), with Greek and native inscriptions. Since then the\r\ncoinage is continuous, and invaluable for history. No stone building\r\nor sculpture is older than Alexander (327 B. C.), or certainly earlier\r\nthan Asoka (264–233 B. C.). Greek influence is plain in the Punjab,\r\nbut native style is seen in the cave-temples. The richest results have\r\nbeen from the mounds, some of which are ruins of forts or palaces,\r\nbut the more important are the _stupas_, lofty domes erected two to\r\none thousand years ago to enshrine Buddhist relics. These domes are\r\nsurrounded with sculptured reliefs of scenes in the life of Buddha,\r\nand are often dated by inscriptions. From one lately opened the Buddha\r\nrelic has been sent to the King of Siam, the only Buddhist king. Much\r\nhas been done by the government in publishing and providing casts and\r\nphotographs; but India yet needs a scientific archæologist to record\r\ndetails with the accuracy demanded by modern research.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA\r\n\r\nArchæological work in the United States and in Central America was\r\nbegun by Squier about the middle of the century, and the attention\r\nthus drawn to the subject has borne fruit in the more accurate and\r\nscientific explorations connected with the surveying and geological\r\ndepartments, and, above all, those of the Smithsonian Bureau of\r\nEthnology. The names of Whitney, Wright, Cyrus Thomas, Holmes, Fowke,\r\nMindeleff, and others, will be familiar to all American readers by\r\ntheir work of the last twenty years, and need no introducing here.\r\n\r\nThe earliest remains of man in America—or perhaps in the world—are\r\nthose beneath the great lava beds of California; since those were\r\ndeposited the rivers have cut their beds through two thousand to four\r\nthousand feet of lava rock, implying an erosion during tens, or perhaps\r\nhundreds, of thousands of years. But little can be assigned, however,\r\nwith any certainty to a date before the Christian era, though mounds of\r\nrefuse on both ocean shores may probably belong to an age before any\r\nhuman history.\r\n\r\nThe most important studies have been those on the highest civilization\r\nof the continent, that of Central America. The destroying Spaniards\r\npreserved but little of native record, except incidentally, and the\r\nfirst collector of Aztec manuscripts was Benaduci (1736), of whose\r\ntreasures but an eighth survived his imprisonments and persecutions,\r\none of the greatest disasters to history. The first great publication\r\nof manuscripts was the magnificent work of Lord Kingsborough (1830);\r\nand almost at the same time appeared Prescott’s history. Though the\r\nlater researches have shown that the land was divided into many small\r\nkingdoms, rather than under one power, as Prescott supposed, yet his\r\naccount of the calendar and chronology of the Aztecs has been verified\r\nand added to, and far more has been done in reading the manuscripts\r\nthan he supposed possible. Aubin, after years of work in Mexico,\r\nbrought to Europe manuscripts of an entirely new kind, showing a fully\r\ndeveloped system of phonetic writing, which he has largely deciphered\r\nwith success, having analyzed over one hundred syllabic values\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nOne of the most complete studies has been that of the Mayan Quiché\r\npeoples, and especially of the Mayans of Yucatan. In 1864 Landa’s work\r\non Yucatan (written 1566) was rediscovered, and the account of the\r\ncalendar has sufficed to enable Goodman to discover the meaning of a\r\nvery large number of signs (1897); these enable the numerical documents\r\nto be translated, and show that a period of as much as eight thousand\r\nyears was dealt with by the Mayans, perhaps belonging to mythical ages.\r\nThe alphabetic signs of Landa have proved useless so far, and Goodman\r\neven disbelieves in any record except that of numbers. Seler has shown\r\nthe identical origin of the signs used by Aztecs and Mayans for the\r\ndays and months. Little had been done to make known these remains until\r\nthe recent explorations, casts, and publications of Maudsley, who\r\nhas worked magnificently for seventeen years at Copan, Palenque, and\r\nChichen-Itza; these, however, are but three of innumerable cities of\r\nGuatemala and Yucatan that need exploration.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico the many ruins from the Colorado to the Rio Grande have\r\nbeen proved to resemble those of the modern Pueblo Indians, and to have\r\nnone of the characteristics of Central American architecture; there\r\nare no sculptures, and the rock inscriptions are too primitive to be\r\ninterpreted. Nothing points to an Aztec occupation, and probably the\r\nancestors of the present people were the builders.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable earthworks of the Mississippi valley were formerly\r\nsupposed to belong to some vanished race. And the view that they were\r\nconnected with the Central American civilization is favored by the\r\npyramid mound, which was hardly known otherwise, and by the excellence\r\nof the minor sculpture. But there are great differences between the two\r\ncivilizations. The mound-builders were far inferior in metal-working,\r\nand their burial customs are peculiar. The use of materials from both\r\neast and west coasts shows an extensive commerce. The best summing up\r\nof the researches is that by Prof. Cyrus Thomas, after his extensive\r\nexcavations. He concludes that the remains of the mound-builders show\r\nno great antiquity; that they were formed by tribes like the existing\r\nIndians; that the builders were of the same culture as were the Indians\r\nwhen discovered; that such mounds continued to be made and used for\r\nburial during the European period, and that the principal builders were\r\nthe Cherokees.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen now how totally our view of man’s history has been\r\nchanged by the study of archæology, and how fundamentally this science\r\naffects our ideas of the past and our expectations for the future of\r\nour race. The main outlines have been dimly seen; but in every country\r\nthe greater part yet remains to be done, and in Turkey, Persia, and\r\nChina most important civilizations are as yet quite untouched by\r\nexploration. The new century will no doubt see a harvest from these\r\nlands; and it is to be hoped that what yet remains in the safe keeping\r\nof the earth may be found by able men, who will preserve it for\r\ninstruction and enable posterity to trace the fortunes of our species.\r\n\r\n[India and America are here treated with the assistance of Mr. J. S.\r\nCotton and Mr. D. MacIver.]\r\n\r\n            W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking back over a century’s work in the oldest of the sciences,\r\none is struck not only by the enormous advance that has been made in\r\nthose branches of the science dealing with the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies which were cultivated at least eight thousand years ago by\r\nearly dwellers in the valleys of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates,\r\nbut with the fact that during the century that has just passed away\r\na perfectly new science of astronomy arose. By annexing physics and\r\nchemistry astronomers now study the motions of the particles of which\r\nall celestial bodies are composed; a new molecular astronomy has now\r\nbeen firmly established side by side with the old molar astronomy which\r\nformerly alone occupied the thoughts of star-gazers.\r\n\r\nAlong this new line our knowledge has advanced by leaps and bounds, and\r\nthe results already obtained in expanding and perfecting man’s views of\r\nnature in all her beauty and immensity are second to none which have\r\nbeen garnered during the last hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nIt may be well before attempting to obtain a glimpse of recent progress\r\nthat we should try to grasp the state of the science at the time when\r\nthe nineteenth century was about to dawn, and this, perhaps, can be\r\nbest accomplished by seeing what men were working at this period, at\r\nwhich the greatest activity was to be found in Germany; there was\r\nno permanent observatory in the southern hemisphere or in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost among the workers—he has, in fact, been described\r\nas “the greatest of modern astronomers”—was William Herschel, a German\r\ndomiciled in England. In the year 1773 he hired a telescope, and with\r\nthis small instrument he obtained his first glimpses of the rich fields\r\nof exploration open in the skies. From that time onward he had one\r\nfixed purpose in his mind, which was to obtain as intimate knowledge as\r\npossible of the construction of the heavens.\r\n\r\nTo do this, of course, great optical power was necessary, and such was\r\nhis energy that, as large instruments were not to be obtained at any\r\nprice, he set to work and made them himself.\r\n\r\nHerschel presented the beginning of the nineteenth century not only\r\nwith a definite idea of the constitution of the stellar system, based\r\non a connected body of facts and deductions from facts, as gleaned\r\nthrough his telescopes, but observations without number in many fields.\r\nHe discovered a new planet, Uranus, and several satellites of the\r\nplanets; published catalogues of nebulæ; established the gravitational\r\nbond between many “double stars,” and carried on observations of the\r\nsun, then supposed to be a habitable globe. What Herschel did for\r\nobservational astronomy and deductions therefrom, Laplace did for the\r\nfurtherance of our knowledge concerning the exact motions of the bodies\r\ncomprising the solar system. Newton had long before announced that\r\ngravitation was universal, and Laplace brought together investigations\r\nundertaken to determine the validity of this law. These were given to\r\nthe world in his wonderful book on _Celestial Mechanics_, the first\r\nvolumes of which appeared in 1799.\r\n\r\nA survey of the work of these two great astronomers gives one an idea\r\nof what was going on in observational and mathematical astronomy at\r\nthe beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nThe study was now destined to make rapid strides, as not only were new\r\noptical instruments—some designed for special purposes—introduced,\r\nnew mathematical processes applied, fresh fields for research\r\nopened up, but the number of workers was considerably augmented by\r\nthe increased means available; so much so, indeed, that the first\r\nastronomical periodical was founded by Von Zach in 1800 to facilitate\r\nintercommunications between the observers.\r\n\r\nThe first evening of the nineteenth century (January 1, 1801) augured\r\nwell for progress. It had long been thought that all the members of\r\nthe solar system had not as yet been discovered, and there was a very\r\nnotable gap between the planets Mars and Jupiter, indicated by Bode’s\r\nlaw. Observers were organized to make a thorough search for the missing\r\nplanet, portions of the sky being divided between them for minute\r\nexamination. It fell to the Italian observer, Piazzi, to discover a\r\nsmall body which was moving in an orbit between these two planets on\r\nthe date named. The century thus began with a sensation, and because\r\nthe new body, which was named “Ceres,” was not of sufficient size to be\r\naccepted as the “missing planet,” the idea was suggested that perhaps\r\nit was a fragment of a larger planet that had been blown to pieces in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity here arose for mathematical astronomy to come to the\r\nhelp of the observer, for Ceres soon was lost in the solar rays, and in\r\norder to rediscover it, after it had passed conjunction, an approximate\r\nknowledge of its path and future position was necessary.\r\n\r\nWith the then existing methods of computation of orbits it was\r\nimperative to have numerous measured positions to use as data for the\r\ncalculation. The scanty data available in the case of Ceres were not\r\nsufficient for the application of the method. The occasion discovered a\r\nman, one of the greatest mathematicians of the nineteenth century, Karl\r\nFrederick Gauss, who, although only twenty-five years of age, undertook\r\nthe solution of the problem by employing a system which he had devised,\r\nknown as “the method of least squares,” which enabled him to obtain a\r\nmost probable result from a given set of observations.\r\n\r\nThis, with a more general method of orbit computation, also elaborated\r\nby himself, was sufficient to enable him to calculate future positions\r\nof Ceres, and on the anniversary of the original discovery, Olbers,\r\nanother great pioneer in orbit calculations, found the planet in very\r\nnearly the position assigned by Gauss. So great was the curiosity\r\nregarding the other portions of the planet, which was supposed to have\r\nbeen shattered, that numerous observers at once commenced to search\r\nafter other fragments.\r\n\r\nThese were the _actualities_ of 1801 and thereabouts; but the seed\r\nof much future work was sown. Kant and Laplace had already occupied\r\nthemselves with theories as to the world formation, and spectrum\r\nanalysis as applied to the heavenly bodies may be said to have been\r\nstarted by Wollaston’s observations of dark lines in the solar spectrum\r\nin 1802. Fraunhofer was then a boy at school. In the same year the\r\nfirst photographic prints were produced by Wedgewood and Davy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATORIES\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that at the beginning of the century there were\r\nno permanent observatories either in the southern hemisphere or in\r\nthe United States. The end of the century finds us with two hundred\r\nobservatories all told, of which fourteen are south of the equator\r\nand forty-seven in the United States, among which latter are the\r\nbest-equipped and most active in the world.\r\n\r\nThe observatory of Parramatta was the first established (1821) in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. This was followed by that at the Cape of Good Hope\r\nin 1829. Of the more modern southern observatories from which the best\r\nwork has come we may mention Cordova, the seat of Gould’s important\r\ninvestigations, established in 1868, and Arequipa, a dependency of\r\nHarvard, whence the spectra of the southern stars have been secured,\r\nerected still more recently (1881).\r\n\r\nI believe, but I do not know, that the large number of American\r\nobservatories have radiated from Cincinnati, where, in consequence of\r\neloquent appeals, both by voice and pen, from Mitchell, then professor\r\nof astronomy, an observatory was commenced in 1845. There can be no\r\ndoubt that at the present moment, with the numerous well-equipped and\r\nactive observatories, and the careful and thorough teaching established\r\nside by side with them, which enables numberless students to use the\r\nvarious instruments, the United States, in matters astronomical, fills\r\nthe position occupied by Germany at the beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nIn Europe special observatories have been established at Meudon,\r\nKensington, and Potsdam, so that new astrophysical inquiries may be\r\nundertaken without interfering with the prosecution or extension of the\r\nimportant meridional work carried on at Paris, Greenwich, and Berlin.\r\nA large proportion of the observations made by the Lick and Yerkes\r\nobservatories in the United States has been astrophysical.\r\n\r\nOne of the special inquiries committed to the charge of the Solar\r\nPhysics Observatory at Kensington at its establishment by the\r\nBritish government had relation to the possibility of running home\r\nmeteorological changes on the earth, especially those followed by\r\ndrought and famines in various parts of the empire, to the varying\r\nchanges in the sun indicated by the ebb and flow of spots on its\r\nsurface. With this end in view observations of the sun were commenced\r\nin India and the Mauritius to supplement those taken at Greenwich. At\r\nthe same time other daily observations of sun spots by a different\r\nmethod were commenced at Kensington.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work was at first considered ideally useless; we shall see\r\nlater on what has become of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN TELESCOPES\r\n\r\nThe progress in astronomical science throughout the nineteenth century\r\nhas naturally to a great extent depended upon the advances made both\r\nin the optics of the telescope and the way in which they are mounted,\r\neither with circles to record exact times and positions, or made to\r\nmove so as to keep a star or other celestial objects in the field of\r\nview while under observation. The perfection of definition and the\r\nmagnitude of the lenses employed in the modern instrument have been\r\nresponsible for many important discoveries.\r\n\r\nEver since the telescope was invented—Galileo’s lens was smaller\r\nthan those used in spectacles—men’s minds have been concentrated on\r\nproducing instruments of larger and larger size to fathom the cosmos to\r\nits innermost depths.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century we were, as we have seen already, in\r\npossession of reflectors of large dimensions; Herschel’s four-foot\r\nmirror, the instrument he was using in 1801, which had a focal length\r\nof forty feet, was capable of being employed with high magnifying\r\npowers; and it was the judicious use of these, on occasions when the\r\nfinest of weather prevailed, that enabled him to enrich so extensively\r\nour knowledge of the stellar and planetary systems. For the ordinary\r\nwork of astronomy, however, especially when circles are used,\r\nrefractors are the more suitable instruments. This form suffers less\r\nfrom the vicissitudes of weather and temperature, and is, therefore,\r\nmore suited where exact measurements are required.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century a Swiss artisan, Pierre\r\nGuinard, after many years of patient labor, succeeded in producing pure\r\ndisks of flint glass as large as six inches in diameter. The modern\r\nrefracting telescope thus became possible.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 there was started at Munich the famous optical and mechanical\r\ninstitute, which soon made its presence felt in the astronomical world.\r\nReforms in instrument making were soon taken in hand, and under the\r\nleadership of the great German astronomer, Bessel, great strides were\r\nmade in instruments of precision. Fraunhofer, who had been silently\r\nworking away at the theory of lenses, and making various experiments\r\nin the manufacture of glass, was joined, in 1805, by Guinard. In 1809\r\nTroughton invented a new method of graduating circles, according to\r\nAiry the greatest improvement ever achieved in the art of instrument\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Fraunhofer successfully completed and perfected an object-glass\r\nof 9.9 inches in diameter for the Dorpat Observatory. This objective\r\nmight literally have been called a “giant,” for nothing approaching it\r\nin size had been previously made.\r\n\r\nEngland, which was at one time the exclusive seat of the manufacture of\r\nrefracting telescopes, was now completely outstripped by both Germany\r\nand France, and for this we had to thank “the short-sighted policy of\r\nthe government, which had placed an exorbitant duty on the manufacture\r\nof flint glass.” In 1833 the Dorpat refractor was eclipsed by one of\r\nfifteen inches aperture made for the Pulkowa Observatory by Merz &\r\nMähler, Fraunhofer’s successors, who about ten years later supplied a\r\nsimilar instrument to Harvard College. At that time Lord Rosse emulated\r\nwith success the efforts of Herschel and rehabilitated the reflector by\r\nproducing a metallic mirror of six-foot aperture and fifty-four-foot\r\nfocal length which he mounted at Parsonstown. The speculum weighed\r\nno less than four tons. To mount this immense mass efficiently and\r\nsafely was a work of no light nature, but he successfully accomplished\r\nit, and eventually both mirror and the telescope, which weighed now\r\naltogether fourteen tons, were so well counterpoised that they could be\r\neasily moved in a limited direction by means of a windlass worked by\r\ntwo men. The perfection of the “seeing” qualities of this instrument\r\nand its enormous light-grasping powers were particularly striking, and\r\nobservational astronomy was considerably enriched by the discoveries\r\nmade with it.\r\n\r\nSpeculum metal was not destined to stay; ten years later (1857) the\r\ngenius of Léon Foucault introduced glass mirrors with a thin coating of\r\nsilver deposited chemically, and these have now universally superseded\r\nthe metallic ones.\r\n\r\nThe long supremacy of Germany in the matter of refractors was broken\r\ndown ultimately by the famous English optician and engineer, Thomas\r\nCooke, of York. His first considerable instrument, one of seven\r\ninches aperture, was finished in 1851; and in 1865, a year before his\r\nlamented death, he completed the first of our present giant refractors,\r\none of twenty-five inches aperture, for Mr. Newall, of Gateshead.\r\nIn consequence of the success of Cooke’s achievement other large\r\nrefractors were soon undertaken.\r\n\r\nAlvan Clarke, the famous optician of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts,\r\nat once commenced a twenty-six-inch for the Washington Observatory.\r\nThe next was one of twenty-seven inches, made by Grubb for the Vienna\r\nObservatory. Object-glasses now grew inch by inch in size, depending\r\non the increased dimensions of disks that could be satisfactorily cast.\r\nGautier, of Paris, completed a twenty-nine-and-a-half-inch for the Nice\r\nObservatory, while Alvan Clarke made an objective of thirty inches for\r\nPulkowa. In 1877 the latter successfully completed the mounting of\r\nan objective of thirty-six inches for the Lick Observatory, but this\r\nimmense lens was only achieved after a great number of failures. Even\r\nthis large object-glass was surpassed in size by the completion in 1892\r\nof the forty-inch which he made for the Yerkes Observatory, and by that\r\nmade by Gautier for the Paris Exhibition of 1900.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the largest refractors. In recent years, since the\r\nintroduction of the silver on glass mirrors, with their stability of\r\nfigure and brilliant surface, which can be easily renewed, reflectors\r\nof large apertures are again being produced. The first of these was\r\none of thirty-six inches aperture made by Calver for Dr. Common, who\r\ndemonstrated its fine qualities and his own skill by the beautiful\r\nphotographs of the nebula of Orion he was enabled to secure with\r\nit. Dr. Common himself has since turned his attention to the making\r\nand silvering of large mirrors of this kind, and the largest he has\r\nactually completed and mounted equatorially is one with a diameter of\r\nfive feet. Another of thirty-six inches aperture is in use at the Solar\r\nPhysics Observatory at Kensington.\r\n\r\nThe progress of depositing silver on glass has led of late years to\r\nimportant developments in which _plane_ mirrors are used. Foucault was\r\nthe first to utilize such mirrors in his “siderostat,” in which such a\r\nmirror is made to move in front of a horizontal fixed telescope, which\r\nmay be of any focal length, and no expensive dome or rising floor is\r\nrequired. The plane mirror of the siderostat in the Paris Exhibition\r\ntelescope is six feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nA variation of this instrument is the cœlostat more recently advocated\r\nby Lippmann. The Coudé equatorial mounting also depends upon the use of\r\nplane mirrors; with such a telescope the observer is at rest at a fixed\r\neye-piece or camera in a room which may be kept at any temperature.\r\n\r\nNow that in astronomical work eye observations are indispensably\r\nsupplemented by the employment of photography, an important\r\nmodification of the refracting telescope has become necessary; this was\r\nfirst suggested by Rutherfurd.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary achromatic object-glass consists, as a rule, of two\r\nlenses, one made of flint and the other of crown glass; but in this\r\nform the photographic rays are not brought to the same focus as the\r\nvisual rays. This, however, can be achieved by employing three lenses\r\ninstead of two, each of different kinds of glass. The most modern\r\nimprovement in the telescope is due to Mr. Dennis Taylor, of Cooke &\r\nSons, and to Dr. Schott and Professor Abbe, whose researches in the\r\nmanufacture of old and new varieties of optical glass have rendered\r\nMr. Taylor’s results feasible. By the Taylor lens outstanding color is\r\nabolished, all the rays being brought absolutely to the same focus;\r\nsuch lenses can therefore be used either for visual observations or for\r\nphotography for spectroscopy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECTROSCOPIC ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nThe branch of physics which at the present day has assumed such mighty\r\nand far-reaching proportions in astronomical work is that dealing with\r\nspectrum analysis, which, although suggested as early as the time of\r\nKepler, did not receive any impetus as regards its application to\r\ncelestial bodies until the beginning of the present century at the\r\nhands of Wollaston and Fraunhofer. Then, however, it still lacked the\r\nchemical touch supplied afterwards by Kirchhoff and Bunsen. They showed\r\nus that the spectrum observed when the light from any heated body is\r\npassed through a prism is an index to the chemical composition of the\r\nlight source; the constitution of a vapor when in a condition to absorb\r\nlight can be determined by an extension of the same principle, first\r\ndemonstrated by Stokes, Angström, and Balfour Stewart, when the century\r\nwas about half completed.\r\n\r\nThe first celestial body towards which the spectroscope was turned was\r\nour central luminary, the sun.\r\n\r\nWollaston first discovered that its spectrum was crossed by a few\r\ndark lines; we learned next from Fraunhofer, who in 1814 worked with\r\ninstruments of greater power, that the solar spectrum was crossed\r\nnot only by a few dark lines, but by some hundreds. Not content with\r\nexamining the light of the sun, Fraunhofer turned his instrument\r\ntowards the stars, the light of which he also examined, so that he may\r\nbe justly called the inventor of stellar spectrum analysis. It is not\r\nto the credit of modern science that from this time forward spectrum\r\nanalysis did not become a recognized branch of scientific inquiry, but,\r\nas a matter of fact, Fraunhofer’s observations were buried in oblivion\r\nfor nearly half a century. The importance of them was not recognized\r\ntill the origin of the dark lines, both in sun and stars, had been\r\nexplained by Stokes and others, as before stated. The lines in the\r\nsolar spectrum were mapped with great diligence by Kirchhoff in 1861\r\nand 1862, and later by Angström and Thalen, and this was done side by\r\nside with chemical work in the laboratory. The chemistry of the sun was\r\nthus to a great extent revealed; it was no longer a habitable globe,\r\nbut one with its visible boundary at a fierce heat, surrounded by an\r\natmosphere of metallic vapors, chief among them iron, also in a state\r\nof incandescence. To these metallic vapors Angström added hydrogen\r\nshortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was established a firm link between the heavens and the\r\nearth; the first step to the problem of the chemistry of space had been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that as advances were made the instrumental\r\nequipment should keep pace with them. Spectroscopes were built on\r\na larger scale; more prisms, which meant greater dispersion, were\r\nemployed to render the measurements of the lines in spectra more\r\naccurate. The growth of our knowledge especially necessitated the\r\nmaking of maps of the lines in the solar spectrum, and in the spectra\r\nof the chemical elements which had been compared with it on a natural\r\nscale. This was done by Angström, who utilized for this purpose the\r\ndiffraction grating invented by Fraunhofer, and defined the position of\r\nall lines in spectra by their “wave lengths,” in ten-millionths of a\r\nmillimetre or “tenth-metres.”\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Rutherfurd extended Fraunhofer’s work on the stars by a first\r\nattempt at classification. Two years later Huggins and Miller produced\r\nmaps of the spectra of some stars. Donati demonstrated that comets gave\r\nradiation spectra, and Huggins did the same for nebulæ.\r\n\r\nBy these observations comets and nebulæ were shown to be\r\nspectroscopically different from stars, which at that time were studied\r\nby their dark lines only.\r\n\r\nChiefly by the labors of Pickering, the energetic head of the Harvard\r\nObservatory, science has been enriched during the later years by\r\nobservations of thousands of stellar spectra, the study of which has\r\nbrought about the most marvellous advance in our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThese priceless data have enabled us now to classify the stars not only\r\nby their brightness, or their color, but by their chemistry.\r\n\r\nNext to be chronicled is the application of the so-called\r\nDoppler-Fizeau principle, which teaches us that when a light source\r\nis approaching or receding from us the light waves are crushed\r\ntogether or drawn out, so that the wave length is changed. The amount\r\nof change gives us the velocity of approach or recess, so that the\r\nrate of movement of stars towards or from the earth, or the up-rush\r\nor down-rush of the solar vapors on the sun’s disk can be accurately\r\ndetermined. A further utilization of this principle is found when the\r\nstars are so close together that they appear as one if the plane of\r\nmotion passes near the earth. A line common to the spectra of both\r\nstars will appear double twice in each revolution, when the motion to\r\nor from the earth, or, as it is termed, “in the line of sight,” is\r\ngreatest. “Spectroscopic doubles,” as these stars are called, yield\r\nup many of their secrets which otherwise would elude us. Their time\r\nof revolution, the size of the orbit, and the combined mass can be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nTo return from the stars to the sun.\r\n\r\nBy the device of throwing an image of the sun on the slit of the\r\nspectroscope the spectra of solar spots have been studied from 1866\r\nonward, and a little later the brighter portions of the sun’s outer\r\nenvelopes, revealed till then only during eclipses, were brought within\r\nour ken spectroscopically, so that they are now studied every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nWedgewood and Davy, in 1802, made prints on paper by means of silver\r\nsalts, but it was not until 1830 that Niepce and Daguerre founded\r\nphotography, which Arago, in an address to the French Chamber, at once\r\nsuggested might subsequently be used to record the positions of stars.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 we find Sir John Herschel carrying out a series of experiments\r\nso important for our correct knowledge of the sequence of steps in the\r\nearly stages of photography that I have no hesitation in quoting from\r\none of Herschel’s manuscripts relating to a deposit on a glass plate\r\nof “muriate” [chloride] of silver from a mixed solution of the nitrate\r\nwith common salt. The manuscript states: “After forty-eight hours [the\r\nchloride] had formed a film firm enough to bear draining the water off\r\nvery slowly by a siphon. Having dried it, I found that it was very\r\nlittle affected by light, and by washing it with nitrate of silver,\r\nweak, and drying it, it became highly sensitive. In this state I took a\r\ncamera picture of the telescope on it.”\r\n\r\nThe original of the above-mentioned photograph, the first photograph\r\never taken on glass, is now in the science collection at the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum, South Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of photography colored glasses were first used\r\nto investigate the action of different colors on the photographic\r\nplate. Sir John Herschel was among the first to propose that such\r\ninvestigations should be made direct with a spectrum, and he, like Dr.\r\nJ. W. Draper, stated that he had found a new kind of light beyond the\r\nblue end of the spectrum, as the photographic plate showed a portion of\r\nthe spectrum there which was not visible to the eye. Advance followed\r\nadvance, and in 1842 Becquerel photographed the whole solar spectrum,\r\nin colors, with nearly all the lines registered by the hand and eye\r\nof Fraunhofer, not only the blue end, but the complete spectrum, from\r\nDraper’s “latent light,” as he called the ultra-violet rays, to the\r\nextreme red end.\r\n\r\nThe first photograph of a celestial object was one of the moon, secured\r\nby Dr. J. W. Draper in 1840; we had to wait till 1845, so far as I\r\nknow, before a daguerreotype was taken of the sun; this was done by\r\nFoucault and Fizeau, while the first photograph of a star—Vega—was\r\ntaken at Harvard in 1850. After the introduction of the wet-collodion\r\nprocess regular photography of the sun’s surface was commenced, at Sir\r\nJohn Herschel’s recommendation, at Kew in 1858, and the total solar\r\neclipse of 1860 was made memorable by the photographs of De La Rue, who\r\nbefore that time had secured most admirable photographs of the moon, as\r\nalso had Rutherfurd.\r\n\r\nPhotography now began to pay the debt she owed to spectrum analysis.\r\n\r\nThe first laboratory photograph of the spectra of the chemical elements\r\nwas taken by Dr. W. A. Miller in 1862.\r\n\r\nRutherfurd was the first to secure a photograph of the solar spectrum\r\nwith considerable dispersion by means of prisms.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Mascart undertook a complete photographic investigation of\r\nthe ultra-violet portion of the solar spectrum, a work of no mean\r\nmagnitude. He, however, did not employ a train of prisms for producing\r\nthe spectrum, but a diffraction grating, using the light reflected\r\nfrom the first surface. The first photograph of the spectrum of a star\r\nwas secured by Henry Draper, the son of Dr. J. W. Draper, one of the\r\npioneers in photography in 1872.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the introduction of dry plates in 1876 that the\r\nphotography of the fainter celestial objects or of their spectra was\r\npossible, as a long exposure was naturally required. Stellar spectra\r\nwere photographed by Huggins in 1879, and in the next year Draper\r\nphotographed the nebula of Orion. As the dry plates became more rapid,\r\nand as longer exposures were employed, revelation followed revelation;\r\nthe nebulæ as seen by the naked eye, and even some stars, were found\r\nby the Henrys, Roberts, Max Wolf, Barnard, and others, to be but the\r\nbrighter kernels of large nebulous patches.\r\n\r\nThis new application of photography, depending upon long exposures (the\r\nlongest one I know of has extended to forty hours), had an important\r\nreflex action on the mechanical parts of the telescope; it was not\r\nonly necessary to keep the faintest star exactly on the same part of\r\nthe plate during the whole of the exposure, but night after night the\r\nstellar image must be brought on to the same part of the plate so that\r\nthe exposure might be continued.\r\n\r\nA system of electric control of the going of the driving-clock of the\r\ntelescope by means of a sidereal clock was introduced, the simplest one\r\nbeing designed by Russell, of Sydney; a most elaborate one by Grubb, of\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nAnother application of the method of long exposures has been the\r\ndiscovery of minor planets by the trails impressed by their motion\r\namong the stars on the photographic plates on which the images of both\r\nare impressed.\r\n\r\nA complete spectroscopic survey of the stars by means of photography\r\nwas commenced in 1886 at Harvard College, as a memorial to Draper, who\r\ndied while he was laboring diligently and successfully in securing\r\nadvances in astrophysical inquiries. To carry on this work at Harvard,\r\nProfessor Pickering wisely reverted to the method first employed by\r\nFraunhofer, and utilized by Respighi and another in 1871, of placing\r\nprisms in front of the object-glass.\r\n\r\nIn the photographing of stellar spectra by means of objective prisms,\r\nthe driving-clock of the telescope must _not_ go exactly at sidereal\r\nrate, but at certain speeds depending on the brightness and position of\r\nthe star under examination.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary because the image of the spectrum of a star on\r\nthe photograph is only a thin line in which it is impossible to see\r\nthe spectral lines; the spectrum must be broadened, and this is\r\naccomplished by making the star image “trail” to a certain degree on\r\nthe plate. This trailing is accomplished by means of the clock, the\r\nrate of which is made to vary. In this way the trail of a spectrum of\r\na star on the photographic plate is always obtained of the same width,\r\nwhile the density of the image is made fairly constant by increasing\r\nthe rate for bright stars and decreasing it for fainter ones. In this\r\nway spectra of the brighter stars rivalling in perfection and detail\r\nthose obtained of the spectrum of the sun itself thirty years ago\r\nhave been obtained. Such photographs have rendered a minute chemical\r\nclassification of the stars possible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting applications of photography to spectrum\r\nanalysis during the latter part of the century has been the utilization\r\nby Messrs. Deslandres and Hale of a suggestion made by Janssen, that\r\nby employing photography images of the sun and its surroundings can\r\nbe obtained in light on one wave length. In this way we can study\r\nthe distribution of any one of the chemical constituents of the sun\r\nseparately, and note its behavior, not only on the sun itself, but in\r\nthe atmosphere which enfolds the disk.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that, in spite of the suggestions of Faye, and others\r\nafter him, one of the great advantages of the employment of photography\r\nin astronomical work, namely, the abolition of “personal equation,” has\r\nso far been almost entirely neglected. What “personal equation” is can\r\nbe perhaps illustrated by considering an observer who is observing the\r\ntransit of a star over the wires in a transit instrument.\r\n\r\nHis object is to note the exact time, to a fraction of a second, when\r\na star passes each wire; and this is done by listening to the beats\r\nof a clock near at hand and estimating the fractions. Some observers\r\nconstantly note the time either a little in advance or a little later\r\nthan the actual time, and this small distance between the observer\r\nand the true times is more or less constant for each observer. This\r\ndifference has to be taken into account for every observation. Even\r\nthe use of the chronograph in transit work, by which the observation\r\nis electrically recorded, does not entirely eliminate the error.\r\nThe photographic method of transit work has been experimented on,\r\nbut, so far as I know, it has not yet been used at more than one or\r\ntwo observatories. It will doubtless eventually rid us of “personal\r\nequation” entirely, for the star image may be photographed and the time\r\nrecorded by the same current of electricity.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the century we could almost say that except in relation\r\nto the work of the meridional observatories, photographic methods of\r\nrecording observations had become exclusively used. One of the cases\r\nin which its utility is most in evidence is in the matter of eclipse\r\nobservations. Spectra of the sun’s surroundings containing a thousand\r\nlines are taken in a second of time, thus replacing five or six\r\ndoubtful eye observations by wealth of results which have enabled the\r\nrecent vast progress to be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES\r\n\r\nCatalogues of the stars were among the first scientific records\r\nstarted by man, and so long as only the naked eye was used the work\r\nwas not difficult, as only approximate positions were attempted,\r\neven by Hipparchus; but long before the eighteenth century dawned\r\nthe problem was entirely changed by the invention of the telescope\r\nand by the provision of accurately divided circles; not only could\r\nbetter positions be recorded, but the number of stars to be catalogued\r\nwas enormously increased, and, furthermore, other objects, nebulæ,\r\npresented themselves in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the star catalogues chiefly relied on were those of Lacaille,\r\ncontaining about three thousand stars scattered over the whole heavens.\r\n\r\nMaskelyne, who was then Astronomer Royal, had published in 1790\r\na catalogue of thirty-six fundamental stars, chiefly for the\r\npurposes of navigation. The first great catalogue of the century\r\nwas the _Fundamenta Astronomiae_ of Bessel, produced in 1818. This\r\ncontained three thousand two hundred and twenty-two stars. The Bonn\r\n_Durchmüsterung_, with its catalogue of three hundred and twenty-four\r\nthousand one hundred and ninety-eight stars in the northern hemisphere,\r\nand the corresponding atlas published in 1857–63, was the next\r\nmemorable achievement in this direction. For it we have to thank Bessel\r\nand Argelander and a perfect system of work.\r\n\r\nAnother monumental catalogue dealing with the stars in the southern\r\nheavens has been that of the southern stars observed by Gould (1866).\r\nWhile the century was closing, another catalogue, far more stupendous\r\nthan anything which could be conceived possible a few years ago, was\r\nsteadily being compiled. This we owe to the far-sightedness and energy\r\nof Admiral Mouchez, a late director of the Paris Observatory. The work\r\nwas commenced in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe whole heavens, north and south alike, have been divided into zones,\r\nand the chief observatories on the earth’s surface are busy night after\r\nnight in taking photographs of that part intrusted to them. The whole\r\nheavens are thus being made to write their autobiography, and the total\r\ngain to the astronomy of the future of this most priceless record can\r\nperhaps be scarcely grasped as yet, although the advantage of being\r\nable at any point of future time to see on a photographic plate what\r\nthe heavens are telling now is sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nCatalogues of the stars have, of course, led to other minor catalogues\r\nof various classes of stars, binary, variable, and the like. In the\r\nlater years catalogues of stars according to their spectra have\r\nenriched science.\r\n\r\nThe first extensive catalogue of stellar spectra was published by\r\nVogel. It dealt with four thousand and fifty-one stars, and appeared in\r\n1883; it has since been followed by the Draper catalogue, based upon\r\nphotographs of the spectra, which contains a much larger number. With\r\nregard to nebulæ, Herschel published his third catalogue in 1802. The\r\nlast catalogue of this nature is by Dreyer (1888), and contains seven\r\nthousand eight hundred and forty of these objects. In the time of Tycho\r\nthey could be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATIONS OF SOME IMPORTANT ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century was fruitful in the determination of many\r\nnumerical values which are all important in enabling us to determine\r\nthe distance and masses of the heavenly bodies, thereby giving us a\r\nfirm grasp not only of the dimensions of our own system, but of those\r\nscattered in the celestial spaces.\r\n\r\nTo take the distances first. We must begin with the exact measure of\r\nthe earth; for this we must measure the exact length of an arc of\r\nmeridian or of parallel—that is, a stretch of the earth’s surface\r\nlying north and south or east and west, between places of which the\r\nlatitudes are accurately known in the former case, and the longitude in\r\nthe latter. In either case we can determine the number of miles which\r\ngo to a degree. Beginning at the opening of the nineteenth century with\r\nan arc of meridian of two degrees measured by Gauss, from Göttingen to\r\nAltona, the arcs of meridian grew longer as the century grew older,\r\ntill, at the close, the measurement of an arc of meridian from the Cape\r\nto Cairo, embracing something like sixty-eight degrees of latitude, was\r\nmooted.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of arcs of parallel have been developed by the rapid\r\nextension of telegraphic communications, which now permit the longitude\r\nof the terminal stations to be determined with the greatest accuracy.\r\n\r\nThanks to this work, we now have the size of our planet to a few miles.\r\nThe polar diameter is 41,709,790 feet, but the equator is not a circle:\r\nthe equatorial diameter from longitude 8 degrees 15 minutes west to\r\nlongitude 188 degrees 15 minutes west is 41,853,258 feet; that at right\r\nangles to it is 41,850,210 feet—that is, some thousand yards shorter.\r\nThe earth, then, is shaped like an orange slightly squeezed.\r\n\r\nKnowing the earth’s diameter, we can obtain the sun’s distance by\r\nseveral methods, the old one by observing transits of Venus, one of\r\nwhich Cook went out to observe in 1768, and two of which recurred in\r\n1874 and 1882; new ones by observations of Mars or one of the minor\r\nplanets at a favorable opposition, and by determining the velocity of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery of a minor planet, Eros, which in one part of its\r\norbit is nearer the earth than Mars, has recently revived interest in\r\nthis method, and a combined attack is in contemplation.\r\n\r\nIt has been long known that light has a finite velocity, but we had\r\nto wait till the 60’s before Fizeau and Foucault showed us how to\r\ndetermine its exact value. The methods introduced by them have been\r\nrecently applied by Cornu, Newcomb, and Michelson, and the resulting\r\nvalue is slightly less than three hundred thousand metres per second.\r\nCombining this with the constant of aberration, the distance of the sun\r\ncan be determined.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how these vastly different methods agree in the\r\nresulting mean distance. At the beginning of the century it stood\r\nroughly at ninety-five million miles; this has been reduced to\r\nninety-three million nine hundred and sixty-five thousand miles.\r\nThe extreme difference between the old and new values of the solar\r\nparallax, two-fifths of a second of arc, is represented by the apparent\r\nbreadth of a human hair viewed at a distance of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet.\r\n\r\nKnowing the distance of the sun, the way is open to us to determine,\r\nby a method suggested by Galileo, the distances of those stars which\r\noccupy a different position among their fellows, as seen from opposite\r\npoints in the earth’s orbit round the sun, points one hundred and\r\neighty-six million miles apart. We now know the distances of many such\r\nstars, Bessel having determined the first in 1838. The nearest star\r\nto us, so far as we know, is Centauri, the light of which takes four\r\nand a half years to reach us. Not many years ago Pritchard applied\r\nphotography to this branch of inquiry; we may, therefore, expect a\r\nstill more rapid progress in the future.\r\n\r\nWith regard to masses. We naturally must first know that of the earth;\r\nhaving its size, if we can determine its density, the rest follows.\r\n\r\nThe problem of determining the mean density of the earth occupied the\r\nminds of many workers during the nineteenth century. Newton (about\r\n1728) pointed out how it could be deduced by observing the deviation\r\nfrom the vertical of a plumb-line suspended near a large mass of\r\nmatter—a mountain, the volume and density of which could be previously\r\ndetermined. This method, which is very laborious and requires the\r\ngreatest skill and most delicate instruments, has been employed several\r\ntimes, by Bouguer and Condamine, in 1738, at Chimborazo; Maskelyne, in\r\n1774, at Schehallien in Scotland; and James, at Arthur’s Seat, near\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century another method was introduced by\r\nCavendish. This consists in measuring the attraction of two large\r\nspheres of known size and mass, such as two balls of lead on two very\r\nsmall and light spheres, by means of a torsion balance constructed by\r\nMitchell for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe most recent determination by this method, and one which is\r\nconsidered to give us perhaps the most accurate value, is that which\r\nis due to the skill and ingenuity of Professor Boys. His improvement\r\nconsisted in constructing a most delicate torsion balance; the\r\nattracted spheres consisted of small gold balls suspended by a quartz\r\nfibre carrying a mirror to indicate the amount of twist. The whole\r\ninstrument was quite small, and could easily be protected from air\r\ncurrents and changes of temperature, while the use of the quartz\r\nfibres reduced to a minimum one of the greatest difficulties of the\r\nCavendish experiment. The value of the mean density of the earth is\r\nnow considered to be 5.6, which means that if we have a globe of water\r\nexactly the same size as our own earth, the real earth would weigh\r\njust 5.6 times this globe of water. The earth’s weight, in tons,\r\ndoes not convey much idea, but that it is six thousand trillions may\r\ninterest the curious. This determination has enabled the masses of the\r\nsun, moon, planets and satellites, and many sidereal systems to be\r\naccurately known in relation to the mass of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACHIEVEMENTS OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nUranus, a planet unknown to the ancients, was discovered by its\r\nmovement among the stars by William Herschel in 1781. It was not until\r\n1846 that another major planet was added to the solar system, and this\r\ndiscovery was one of the sensations of the century.\r\n\r\nThe story of the independent discovery of Neptune by Adams and Le\r\nVerrier, who were both driven to the conclusion that certain apparent\r\nregularities in the motion of Uranus were due to the attraction of\r\nanother body travelling on an orbit outside it, has been often told.\r\nThe subsequent discovery of the external body not far from the place at\r\nwhich their mathematical analysis had led them to believe it would be\r\nseen, will forever be regarded as a fine triumph of the human intellect.\r\n\r\nBut the results of the inquiries which now concern us are generally\r\nof not so sensational a character, although they lie at the root of\r\nour knowledge of celestial motions. They more often take the shape of\r\ntables and discussions relating to the movements of the bodies which\r\nmake up our solar system.\r\n\r\nGauss may be said to have led the way during the nineteenth century by\r\nhis _Theoria molus corporum coelestium solem ambientium_. This was a\r\nworthy sequel to the _Méchanique Céleste_, in which work, towards the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, Laplace had enshrined all that was known\r\non the planetary results of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIn later years Le Verrier and Newcomb have been among the chief workers\r\non whom the mantle of such distinguished predecessors has fallen. From\r\nthem the planet and satellite tables now in use have been derived.\r\n\r\nBut the motion of our own satellite, the moon, has had fascinations for\r\nother analysts besides those we have named.\r\n\r\nThe problem, indeed, of the moon’s motion is one of the most difficult,\r\nand has taxed the ingenuity of astronomers from an early date. Even at\r\nthe present day it is impossible to predict the exact position of the\r\nmoon at any one moment owing to inequalities and perturbations, the\r\nexact varying values of which are not known.\r\n\r\nThe two most important theories of the motion of the moon completed\r\ntowards the middle of the century were due to Hansen and Delaunay.\r\nThe former’s appeared in 1838, the lunar tables being published later\r\n(1857), while the latter’s was published in 1860.\r\n\r\nHansen’s theory had for its chief object the formation of tables;\r\nto avoid the inconvenience of using in his calculations series which\r\nslowly converge, he inserted numerical values throughout. In Hansen’s\r\nsolution the problem is one actually presented by nature, allowance\r\nbeing made for every known cause of disturbance. There is one\r\ndisadvantage, namely, that should observations demand a change in any\r\nof the constants used, there is no means of making any correction in\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\nDelaunay’s theory surmounted this difficulty, but at the expense\r\nof still greater inconvenience for making an ephemeris. The slow\r\nconvergence of certain series involved an immense amount of labor to\r\ngive sufficiently approximate results.\r\n\r\nMore recently, as the century was closing, Dr. Brown took up the\r\nsubject and made a fresh attempt to calculate the motion of our\r\nsatellite. It may be stated that he adopts all Delaunay’s modifications\r\nof the problem and works them out algebraically; but there are many\r\ntechnical differences which it would be out of place to mention here.\r\n\r\nEnough has been stated to show that there is not likely to be any\r\nbreach of continuity in the treatment of this most important problem.\r\n\r\nAnother attack on the moon, and, incidentally, its motion, has recently\r\nbeen made by another analyst, Professor George Darwin; grappling with\r\nall the consequences of tidal friction, he has been able to present to\r\nus the past and future history of our satellite. Beginning as a part of\r\nthe material congeries from which subsequently some fifty million years\r\nago both earth and moon, as separate bodies, were formed, it has ever\r\nsince been extending its orbit, and so retreating farther away from its\r\ncentre of motion, while the period of the earth’s rotation has been\r\nincreasing at the same time, from a possible period of some three hours\r\nwhen the moon was born, to one of one thousand four hundred hours when\r\nthe day and month will be equal, something like one hundred and fifty\r\nmillion years being required for the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTELLAR EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIt was only in the 80’s, after thousands of observations of the spectra\r\nof stars, nebulæ, and comets had been secured, that the full meaning of\r\nthe revelations of the spectroscope began to dawn upon the world.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of spectrum analysis all stars were supposed\r\nto be suns, and the only difference recognized among them was one of\r\nbrilliancy and the variation of brilliancy in the case of some of them.\r\n\r\nIt ultimately came out that great classes might be recognized by\r\nthe differences of their spectra, which were ultimately traced to\r\ndifferences in their chemistry and in their temperature, as determined\r\nby the extension of the spectra in the ultra-violet, the whiter stars\r\nbeing hotter than the red ones, as a white-hot poker is hotter than a\r\nred-hot poker.\r\n\r\nNext there was evidence to show that a large proportion of the stars\r\nwere not stars at all like the sun, but swarms of meteorites; and in\r\nthis way the mysterious new stars which appear from time to time in\r\nthe heavens, and a large number of variable stars, were explained as\r\narising from collisions among such swarms.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry which dealt with the spectroscopic results, having thus\r\nintroduced the ideas of meteor swarms and collisions to explain many\r\nstellar phenomena, went further and showed that the various chemical\r\nchanges observed in passing from star to star might also be explained\r\nby supposing the whole stellar constitution to arise from cool\r\nmeteoritic swarms represented by nebulæ, the changes up to a certain\r\npoint being explained by a rise of temperature due to condensation\r\ntowards a centre. Here the new view was opposed to that of Laplace,\r\nadvanced during the last century, that the stars were produced by\r\ncondensation and cooling; but Kelvin had shown, before the new view\r\nwas enunciated, that Laplace’s view was contrary to thermodynamics,\r\na branch of science which had developed since Laplace published his\r\nfamous _Exposition du Système du Monde_.\r\n\r\nAfter all the meteorites in the parent swarm had been condensed into\r\nthe central gaseous mass, that mass had to cool. So that we had in\r\nthe heavens not only stars more or less meteoritic in structure,\r\nof _rising_ temperature, but stars chiefly gaseous, of falling\r\ntemperature. It was obvious that representatives of both these classes\r\nof stars might have nearly the same mean effective temperature, and\r\ntherefore more or less the same spectrum. A minute inquiry entirely\r\njustified these conclusions.\r\n\r\nSo far had the detailed chemistry of the stars been carried in the\r\nlatter years of the century that the question of stellar evolution gave\r\nrise to that of inorganic evolution generally, the sequence in the\r\nphenomena of which can only be studied in the stars, for laboratory\r\nwork without stint has shown that in them we have celestial furnaces,\r\nthe heat of which transcends that of our most powerful electric sparks.\r\nIn this way astronomy is paying the debt she owes to chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN AND HIS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAlthough the outer confines of space have, as we have seen, been\r\ncompelled to bring their tribute of new knowledge by means of the\r\npenetrating power possessed by modern telescopes, and the cameras and\r\nspectroscopes attached to them, the study of the _near_ has by no means\r\nbeen neglected, and for the reason that in astronomy especially we must\r\ncontent ourselves in the case of the more distant bodies by surmising\r\nwhat happens in them from the facts gathered in the region where alone\r\ndetailed observations are possible.\r\n\r\nThus what we can learn about the sun helps to explain what we discern\r\nmuch more dimly in the case of stars; a study of the moon’s face we\r\nare compelled to take as showing us the possibilities relating to the\r\nsurface condition of other satellites so far removed from us that they\r\nonly appear as points of light.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, with the sun. Where a volume might be written, a few\r\nwords must suffice. I have already stated that at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century the prevailing opinion was that it was a habitable\r\nglobe. It was limited to the fiery ball we see. At the end of the\r\ncentury it is a body of the fiercest heat, and the ball we see is only\r\na central portion of a huge and terribly interesting mechanism, the\r\nouter portions of which heave and throb every eleven years. Spots,\r\nprominences, corona, everything feels this throbbing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the discovery of spots on the sun was among Galileo’s first\r\nachievements, it was reserved for the last half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to demonstrate their almost perfect periodicity.\r\n\r\nThanks to the labors of Schwabe, Wolf, Carrington, and De la Rue,\r\nStewart, and Loewy, we now know that every eleven years the spots wax\r\nand wane; Tacchini and Ricco, during the last thirty years, have proved\r\nthat the prominences follow suit, and the fact that the corona also\r\nobeys the same law was established during the American eclipse of 1878.\r\n\r\nThe study of solar physics consists in watching and recording the\r\nthermal, chemical, and other changes which accompany this period. Some\r\nof these effects can be best studied during those times when the ball\r\nitself is covered by the moon in an eclipse. Then the outer portions of\r\nthe sun are revealed in all their beauty and majesty, and all the world\r\ngoes to see.\r\n\r\nBut it is the quiet daily work in the laboratory which has enabled us\r\nto study the sun’s place in relation to the other stars, and so to\r\nfound a chemical classification of all the stars that shine.\r\n\r\nFrom the sun we may pass to his system, and first consider the nearest\r\nbody to us—the moon.\r\n\r\nWhile some astronomers have been discussing the movements and evolution\r\nof our satellite, others have been engaged upon maps of its surface,\r\nupon questions dealing with a lunar atmosphere, or a study of the\r\norigin of the present conformations and of possible changes. The\r\nscience of selenology may be said to have been founded by Schröter\r\nat the beginning of the century, but it required the application of\r\nphotography in later years to put it on a firm basis. Maps of the moon\r\nhave been prepared by Lohrmann, Beer and Mädler, and Schmidt, the\r\nlatter showing the positions of more than thirty thousand craters.\r\n\r\nVery erroneous notions are held by some as to what we may hope to do\r\nin the examination of the moon’s surface by a powerful telescope. A\r\npower of a thousand enables us to see it as if we were looking at\r\nYork from London. It is recorded that Lassell once said that with his\r\nlargest reflector in a “fit” of the finest definition he thought he\r\nmight be able to detect whether a carpet as large as Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields was round or square. Under these circumstances, then, we may\r\nwell understand that the question of changes on the surface has been\r\nraised from time to time never to be absolutely settled one way or the\r\nother. By many the existence of an atmosphere is denied, and this is a\r\ncondition which would negative changes, anything like the geological\r\nchanges brought about on the surface of the earth, but the idea is now\r\nheld by many that there is still an atmosphere, though of great tenuity.\r\n\r\nThe last few years of the century were rendered memorable from the\r\nlunar point of view by the publication and minute study of a most\r\nadmirable series of photographs of the moon obtained by the great\r\nequatorial Coudé of the Paris Observatory by Loewy and Puiseaux.\r\nOne of the chief points aimed at has been to determine the sequence\r\nof the various events represented by the rills, craters, and walled\r\nplains, the mountain ranges and seas. This work is still in progress,\r\nthe fourth part of the atlas being published in 1900; but enough has\r\nalready appeared to indicate that the results of the inquiry when\r\ncompleted will be of the most important kind. The authors have already\r\ncome to the conclusion that the lunar and terrestrial sea-bottoms\r\nmuch resemble each other, inasmuch as both have convex surfaces. The\r\nlunar seas began by sinking of vast regions; the formidable volcanic\r\neruptions of which the moon has been the scene have taken place in\r\ntimes equivalent to those labelled “recent” in geological parlance.\r\nThere is evidence that the axis of the moon has undergone great\r\ndisplacements, and four great periods of change have been made out.\r\nFinally they state that there is serious ground to believe that there\r\nis an atmosphere of some sort remaining.\r\n\r\nIt may readily be understood that with each increase of optical power\r\nnew satellites of the various planets have been discovered. Soon after\r\nthe discovery of Neptune a satellite was noted by Lassell. In 1846\r\nboth he and the eagle-eyed observer Dawes independently discovered\r\nanother satellite (Hyperion) of Saturn. Lassell was rewarded in the\r\nnext year by the discovery of two more satellites of Uranus; but,\r\nstrangest observation of all, in 1877 Hall discovered at Washington\r\ntwo satellites of Mars some six or seven miles only in diameter, one\r\nof them revolving round the planet in seven and one-half hours at a\r\ndistance of less than four thousand miles. As the day on Mars is not\r\nfar different in duration from our own, this tiny satellite must rise\r\nin the west and south three times a day!\r\n\r\nWonderful as this discovery was, it is certainly not less wonderful\r\nwhen we consider it in connection with a passage in _Gulliver’s\r\nTravels_, so true is it that truth is stranger than fiction. Swift,\r\nin his satirical reference to the inhabitants of Laputa, writes:\r\n“They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which\r\nrevolve round Mars, whereof the innermost is distant from the centre\r\nof the primary planet exactly three of his diameters and the outermost\r\nfive; the former revolves in the space of ten hours; and the latter in\r\ntwenty-one and a half.”\r\n\r\nThe last discovery of this kind has been that of an inner satellite of\r\nJupiter by Barnard in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe planets from Mercury to Saturn were known to the ancients. I\r\nhave already referred to the discovery of Uranus by Herschel’s giant\r\ntelescope, not long before the nineteenth century was born, and of\r\nNeptune, by analysis, towards the end of the first half of the century.\r\nWith regard to what modern observations have done in regard to their\r\nphysical appearance, the first place in general interest must be given\r\nto Saturn and Mars.\r\n\r\nSaturn has always been regarded as the most interesting of the\r\nplanetary family on account of its unique rings. Many subdivisions of\r\nthe rings, and a dusky ring, first seen by Dawes and Bond, have been\r\ndiscovered during the last sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe meteoritic nature of the rings was suggested by Clerk Maxwell in\r\n1857, and Keeler’s demonstration of the truth of this view by means\r\nof the spectroscope, a few years ago, was brilliant in conception and\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nBut during the last half of the century the interest centred in Mars\r\nhas been gradually increasing. The drawings made during the opposition\r\nof 1862, when compared with those made by Beer and Mädler (1830–40),\r\nmade it perfectly clear that in this planet we had to deal with one\r\nstrangely like our own in many respects. There were obviously land and\r\nwater surfaces; the snow at the poles melted in the summer-time; clouds\r\nwere seen forming from time to time, and the changing tones of the\r\nwater surfaces suggested fine and rough weather.\r\n\r\nAfterwards came the revelation of the hawk-eyed Schiaparelli, beginning\r\nin the year 1877, and his wonderful map of the planet’s surface. The\r\nland surfaces, instead of being unbroken, were cut up, as an English\r\nfarm is cut up by hedges; straight lines of different breadths and\r\ntints crossed the land surfaces in all directions, and at times some of\r\nthem appeared double. Schiaparelli naturally concluded that they were\r\nrivers—water channels—and being an Italian he used the appropriate\r\nword _canali_. This, unfortunately, as it turned out, was translated\r\n_canals_. Now canals are dug, _ergo_ there were diggers. From this the\r\ndemonstration, not of the habitability, but of the actual habitation,\r\nof Mars was a small step, and the best way of signalling to newly found\r\nkinsmen across some thirty millions of miles of space was discussed.\r\n\r\nThe world of science owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Percival Lowell\r\nfor having taken out to the pure air and low latitude of Arizona an\r\neighteen-inch telescope for the sole purpose of accumulating facts\r\ntending to throw light upon this newly raised question. This he did\r\nin 1894. Schiaparelli has continued his magnificent observations\r\nthrough each opposition when the planet is most favorably situated for\r\nobservation, and since 1896 Signor Cerulli, armed with a fifteen-inch\r\nCooke, in the fine climate of Italy, has joined in the inquiry, so\r\nthat facts are now being rapidly accumulated. It has been stated that\r\nmarkings similar to the strange so-called “canals” on Mars are to be\r\nseen on Mercury, Venus, and even on the satellites of Jupiter. Mr.\r\nPercival Lowell does not hesitate to proclaim himself in favor of their\r\nbeing due, _in Mars_, to an intelligent system of irrigation. Signor\r\nCerulli claims that _wherever seen_ they are mere optical effects.\r\nWe may be well content to leave to the twentieth century a general\r\nagreement on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nFinally, in our survey of our own system, come comets and meteor\r\nswarms. One of the most fruitful discoveries of the century, that\r\ncomets are meteor swarms, we owe to the genius of Schiaparelli, A. H.\r\nNewton, and other workers on those tiny celestial messengers which give\r\nrise to the phenomena of “falling” or “shooting” stars.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent displays of 1799, 1833, 1866, and, alas! that which\r\nfailed to come in 1899, we now know must be associated with Tempel’s\r\nComet. This is by no means the only case so far established; the\r\nconnection will in the future be closer still when the orbits of the\r\nvarious swarms observed throughout the year shall be better known.\r\n\r\nComets which attract public attention by their brightness and grandeur\r\nof form are rather rare, and, in fact, only twenty-five of such have\r\nbeen seen since 1800. We have, however, with the great advance in\r\ninstrumental equipment, been able to discover many which are scarcely\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and this has swollen the number of comets\r\nvery considerably. In the seventeenth century we find that only\r\nthirty-two were observed, while in the eighteenth this number was more\r\nthan doubled (seventy-two). In the nineteenth century more than three\r\nhundred were placed on record, which is practically more than four\r\ntimes the number seen in the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nThe last great comet visible any considerable time was that discovered\r\nby Donati in 1858, and so carefully observed by Bond. It is unfortunate\r\nthat since the importance, in so many directions, of spectroscopic\r\nobservations of comets has been recognized they have been conspicuous\r\nby their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL WEATHER\r\n\r\nEverybody agrees that all the energy utilized on this planet of ours,\r\nwith the single exception of that supplied by the tides, comes from\r\nthe sun. We are all familiar with the changes due to the earth’s daily\r\nrotation bringing us now on the side of our planet illuminated by\r\nthe sun, then plunging us into darkness; that changes of season must\r\nnecessarily follow from the earth’s yearly journey round the sun is\r\nuniversally recognized.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is a modern idea that those solar phenomena which\r\nprove to us considerable changes of temperature in the sun itself,\r\nmay, and indeed should, be echoed by changes on our planet, giving us\r\nthereby an eleven-year period to be considered, as well as a year and a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis response of the earth to solar changes was first observed in the\r\ncontinuous records of those instruments which register for us the\r\nearth’s magnetism at any one place. The magnetic effects were strongest\r\nwhen there were more spots, taking them as indicators of solar changes.\r\nLamont first (without knowing it) made this out, at the beginning of\r\nthe latter half of the century (1851), from the Göttingen observations\r\nof the daily range of the declination needle. Sabine the next year not\r\nonly announced the same cycle in the violence of the “magnetic storms”\r\nobserved at Toronto, but at once attributed them to solar influence,\r\nthe two cycles running concurrently. It is now universally recognized\r\nthat terrestrial magnetic effects, including auroræ, minutely echo the\r\nsolar changes.\r\n\r\nThe eleven-year period is not one to be neglected.\r\n\r\nNext comes the inquiry in relation to meteorology. Sir William\r\nHerschel, in the first year of the century, when there were practically\r\nneither sun-spot nor rainfall observations available, did not hesitate\r\nto attack the question whether the price of wheat was affected by the\r\nmany-or-few-spot solar condition. He found the price to be high when\r\nthe sun was spotless, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nBy 1872, however, we had both rainfall and sun-spot observations,\r\nand the cycle of the latter had been made out. Meldrum, the most\r\ndistinguished meteorologist living at the time, and others, pronounced\r\nthat the rainfall was greatest at sun-spot maximum, and, further, that\r\nthe greatest number of cyclones occurred in the East and West Indies at\r\nsuch times.\r\n\r\nThis result with regard to rainfall was not generally accepted, but\r\nChambers showed shortly afterwards an undoubted connection between the\r\ncycles of solar spots and barometric pressure in the Indian area.\r\n\r\nBy means of a study of the widened lines observed in sun spots an\r\nattempt has been recently made to study the temperature, history of the\r\nsun since about 1877, and the years of mean temperature and when the\r\nheat was in excess (+) and defect (-) made out, have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  Heat\r\n  condition   mean   +   mean   −   mean   +     mean    −     mean\r\n  Years       1869       1876       1881        1886–87       1891–92\r\n                 1870–75     1877–80    1882–86       1881–91  1892\r\n\r\nHaving these solar data, the next thing to do was to study the Indian\r\nrainfall during the southwest monsoon for the years 1877–1886, the\r\nobject being to endeavor to ascertain if the + and − temperature pulses\r\nin the sun were echoed by + and − pulses of rainfall. The Indian\r\nrainfall was taken first because in the tropics the phenomena are\r\nknown to be the simplest. It was found that in many parts of India the\r\n+ and − conditions of solar temperature were accompanied by + and −\r\npulses, producing pressure changes and heavy rains in the Indian Ocean\r\nand the surrounding land. These occurred generally in the first year\r\nfollowing the mean condition, that is, in 1877–78 and 1882–83.\r\n\r\nThe rainfalls at Mauritius, Cape Town, and Batavia were next collated\r\nto see if the pulses felt in India were traceable in other regions\r\nsurrounding the Indian Ocean to the south and east. This was found to\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\nA wider inquiry was followed, we are told, with equal success, so that\r\nwe are justified in hoping that the question of the dependence of\r\nterrestrial upon solar weather has made a step in advance.\r\n\r\nBut just as the general public and practical men took little heed of\r\nthe connection between sun spots and magnetism until experience taught\r\nthem that telegraphic messages often could not “get through” when\r\nthere were many sun spots, so the same public will not consider the\r\nconnection in regard to meteorology unless the forecasting of droughts\r\nand famines be possible.\r\n\r\nThe recent work suggests that, if the recent advances in solar physics\r\nbe considered, the inquiries regarding rainfall may be placed on a\r\nfirmer basis than they could possibly have had in 1872, and that such\r\nforecastings may become possible.\r\n\r\nWhat was looked for in 1872 was a change in the quantity of rain at\r\nmaximum sun spots only, the idea being that there might be an effective\r\nchange of solar temperature, either in excess or defect, at such times\r\nand that there would be a gradual and continuous variation from maximum\r\nto maximum.\r\n\r\nWe see that the rainfalls referred to above justify the conclusions\r\nderived from the recent work that two effects ought to be expected in a\r\nsun-spot cycle instead of one. There was excess of rainfall, not only\r\nnear the sun-spot maximum, but near the minimum.\r\n\r\nIf the authors of this communication to which I refer are right, then\r\ndroughts and famines occur in India because the rain pulses, which are\r\nassociated with the solar-heat pulses, are of short duration. When\r\nthey cease the quantity of rain which falls in the Indian area is not\r\nsufficient, without water storage, for the purposes of agriculture;\r\nthey are followed, therefore, by droughts, and at times subsequently by\r\nfamines. They divide the period 1877—89 as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           { 1877.\r\n  Rain from − pulse        { 1878.\r\n                           { 1879 (part).\r\n\r\n                           { 1879 (part).\r\n  No rain pulse            { 1880 (central year).\r\n                           { 1881 (part).\r\n\r\n                           { 1881 (part).\r\n                           { 1882.\r\n  Rain from + pulse        { 1883.\r\n                           { 1884 (part).\r\n\r\n                           { 1884 (part).\r\n                           { 1885 }\r\n  No rain pulse            { 1886 } (central year).\r\n                           { 1887 (part).\r\n\r\n                           { 1887 (part).\r\n  Rain from − pulse        { 1888.\r\n                           { 1889.\r\n\r\nTheir statement is based on the fact that all the famines which have\r\ndevastated India for the last seventy years have occurred at intervals\r\nof eleven years, or thereabouts, working backward and forward from the\r\ncentral years 1880 and 1885–86 in the above table, the middle years,\r\nthat is, between the pulses.\r\n\r\nMr. Willcocks, in a paper read at the Meteorological Congress at\r\nChicago, remarked that “famines in India are generally years of low\r\nflood in Egypt.”\r\n\r\nIt is now pointed out that the highest Niles follow the years of the +\r\nand − pulses, as does the highest rainfall in the Indian area.\r\n\r\nEven if these results, which were communicated to the Royal Society\r\nof London five weeks before the end of the century, be confirmed, it\r\nmay be pointed out that Sir William Herschel’s suggestion of 1801 will\r\nhave required a whole century for its fulfilment, so slowly do those\r\nbranches of science move which have not already led to some practical\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n            NORMAN LOCKYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a natural illusion that makes us think of each century as\r\nexhibiting the continuous development of one tendency of mind through\r\na series of stages whose differences are only of secondary importance,\r\nand, on the other hand, to regard the steps from one century to another\r\nas corresponding to some marked transition of thought, as if the world\r\nhad been suddenly precipitated into a new sphere of existence. For\r\nsome purposes a rough generalization of this kind, that breaks at\r\nstated intervals the continuity of time, may, perhaps, be convenient.\r\nWhen, however, we begin to look at things more closely, we discover\r\nthat it is impossible thus to cut through the historical connection of\r\nevents, as it were, “with a hatchet.” We discover, for example, that\r\nthe characteristics of the eighteenth century were strongly marked\r\nonly in one period of it; and that what we call the spirit of the\r\nnineteenth century was born some time before the year 1800, and has\r\nnever quite prevailed over other tendencies. At the same time, there is\r\nan important difference indicated by these two loosely used names, and\r\nas it is always easier to define things by contrast, it may help us to\r\nmake our subject more definite to consider what they mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is too late now to “abuse the eighteenth century,” which had its\r\ngood and evil, like other periods. It is commonly conceived as the\r\nera of individualism and analysis, the era of logical enlightenment\r\nand sceptical criticism; and, again, as the era of liberation from\r\ngroundless superstitions and fictitious claims of authority; the era\r\nin which mankind seemed for the first time to throw off the weight\r\nof the past and to enter without fear upon the enjoyment of their\r\nearthly heritage. The science of Newton had given the last blow to\r\nthe astronomy that made the earth the centre of the universe. It had\r\nundermined and discredited the simple theology that explained the\r\nwhole material world as a cosmos arranged for the supply of human\r\nneeds. At the same time, the progress of biology was bringing man to a\r\nconsciousness that as a physical being he is only _primus inter pares_\r\nin the animal kingdom, and the decay of religious belief was making him\r\nrealize his finitude, the limits of his natural existence, as, perhaps,\r\nhe had never done before, at least never since the beginning of the\r\nChristian era. Earth seemed to be disconnected from heaven, and the\r\nhuman race thrown upon its own resources. By the new enlightenment all\r\npowers, ecclesiastical or political, were stripped of the mysterious\r\nsanctity that had once invested them. “The nimbus was taken away from\r\nthe heads of the gods and rulers of the world.” Every authority that\r\nclaimed man’s homage was weighed in the scales of the understanding,\r\nand, so weighed, every such authority was found wanting. The State had\r\ncome to be regarded as only a collection of individuals who had agreed\r\nto live together under a ruler deriving all his claims from their\r\nconsent, and invested with no divine right to their allegiance. The\r\nChurch was no longer a sacred institution governed by priests who held\r\ntheir commission directly from God, but only a sort of spiritual police\r\nagency, an ally of the State in the restraint of vice and crime, or,\r\nat best, in Protestant countries, a society for mutual improvement.\r\nMen were “free and equal,” each standing face to face with his\r\nfellows, admitting no superiority or superstition of hero-worship in\r\nregard to any one of them. And the Deity, if his existence were not\r\ndenied, tended to become a mere “Supreme Being,” who was removed to\r\nsuch a distance from mankind that he could hardly be reached by their\r\nreverence, still less by their love.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the influences which, in one point of view, seemed to\r\nlimit and narrow human existence, in another point of view tended to\r\nliberate and enlarge it. If they excluded the idea of the infinite from\r\nman’s life, they emancipated him from many degrading superstitions,\r\nwhich in an earlier age had held him “all his lifetime subject to\r\nbondage.” And as the pressure from above was lightened the individual\r\nseemed to become master of himself and of his destiny. If the king\r\ncould no longer say, “_L’Etat c’est moi_,” the rights of the subject\r\nwere vindicated; if the authority of the Church was weakened, the bonds\r\nof free inquiry were broken; if imagination ceased to fill men with the\r\nawe and wonder of higher powers, the way was opened up for scientific\r\nand industrial development; if God was regarded as unknowable, “the\r\nproper study of mankind was man,” and that study could now be pursued\r\nwithout fear or hinderance. Poetry and religion might be impoverished,\r\nthe sense of the binding force of social relations might be weakened,\r\nbut interest in the bettering of man’s earthly condition was awakened,\r\nand with it came a new desire for justice to all, a new intolerance\r\nof human suffering, and a new demand that the lot of the class “which\r\nis most numerous and poor” should be made less wretched and insecure,\r\nand, towards the end of the century, a new turn was given to its\r\nleading thought, for an effort was made to discover in the nature of\r\nthe individual himself the equivalent of those universal powers which\r\nthe enlightenment had banished from the external world and from the\r\nlife of society. Rousseau carried individualism to an extreme point,\r\nat which it became its own correction, and taught men to find _within_\r\ntheir own souls the infinite which they could no longer discover\r\n_without_. Rejecting in the first instance all social conventions as\r\nunjust limitations of the natural man, and adopting the prevailing\r\ntheory of the time, that the State is only the product of a contract\r\nbetween independent persons, he yet discovered in the individual thus\r\nliberated from all external pressure a “common reason,” and “a general\r\nwill,” which could reorganize his life and bind him to his fellow-men\r\nand to God. This great idea, which appears in Rousseau rather as a\r\nstroke of insight, an intuition of genius—lifting him above his\r\nfirst thoughts and insensibly changing their meaning—was grasped\r\nby Kant as the principle of a new philosophy and worked out in a\r\ncomprehensive system that dealt with all the great problems of thought\r\nand life. Kant, indeed, seemed, like Rousseau, to begin on the plane\r\nof eighteenth-century individualism, but, influenced as he was by the\r\nphilosophy of Leibnitz, he from the first conceived the individual as\r\nin himself universal; or, to speak more exactly, as having a universal\r\nprinciple realized in him. Thus, though in one aspect of his being man\r\nis a finite object among other objects, confined within limits of space\r\nand time, and forming only a link in the chain of natural causation,\r\nin another aspect of it, as a conscious self, he is emancipated\r\nfrom all these limitations. For—such is Kant’s argument—a knowing\r\nsubject, for whom the whole finite world, including his own finite\r\nexistence, is an object of knowledge, cannot himself be comprehended\r\nin that world or limited by any of its conditions. As there can be no\r\nworld of objects except for a self, it is impossible that such a self\r\nshould be merely one of these objects. Thus, as knowing, or capable\r\nof knowing, all things, man cannot be identified with any of them;\r\nor if, from one point of view, as an individual, he is so identified,\r\nyet he has within him a universal principle that carries him beyond\r\nthe limits of his individuality. And this contrast shows itself also\r\nin his practical life. For if as an object he appears to be but an\r\nanimal organism, moved by the impressions of pleasure and pain which\r\nhe receives from other objects, yet in his inner moral life man is\r\nrevealed to himself as a self-determining subject, emancipated from all\r\nsensuous motives and from the necessity of nature which they bring with\r\nthem, and conscious of subordination only to the law of duty, which is\r\nthe law of his own reason. And that law, in spite of every pressure of\r\ncircumstance from without, and of every impulse of passion from within,\r\nhe knows that he ought to obey, and therefore he knows that he _can_\r\nobey it. Thus, in Kant’s theory, the two extreme views of humanity, as\r\nnatural and as spiritual, as limited to a finite individuality, hemmed\r\nin by necessities on every side, and yet as possessing a universal\r\ncapacity of knowing, and an absolute power of self-determination,\r\nthese two views are presented in sharp antithesis, and at the same\r\ntime held together as different aspects of one life. In fact, we have\r\nhere, as it were, compressed into a nutshell, the result of the whole\r\nhistory of eighteenth-century individualism, which began by depressing\r\nman and ended by exalting him; which, with one of its voices, seemed\r\nto reduce him to the level of an animal, a mere part of the partial\r\nworld, a transitory phenomenal existence among other phenomena; and\r\nthen, with its other voice, proceeded to recognize him as a member of\r\nthe intelligible world, a “spectator of all time and existence,” and\r\ngifted with the absolute freedom of a will which could be determined\r\nby nothing but itself. “The solitary,” says Aristotle, “must be either\r\na god or a beast,” and the eighteenth century, in its conception of\r\nthe individual, seemed to oscillate between the one and the other\r\ntill Kant, awaking to the impossibility of omitting either aspect of\r\nhis being, demanded that he should be conceived as both at once. Kant\r\nthus set the problem of the future; and if he did not solve it, he\r\nat least showed the futility of any narrow or one-sided solution and\r\nthe direction in which an adequate solution could alone be sought. In\r\nshort, Kant asked the question to which the nineteenth century, in all\r\nits philosophical reflection, has been striving to find an answer.\r\n\r\nFor in philosophy, as in other departments of knowledge, the work of\r\nthe nineteenth century has been one of mediation and reconciliation.\r\nIt has been an endeavor to break down the sharp antithesis of\r\nphilosophical and scientific theories that was characteristic of an\r\nearlier time. In the writings of the greatest thinkers, the oppositions\r\nof materialism and spiritualism, of sensationalism and idealism, of\r\nempiricism and _a priori_ speculation, of individualism and socialism,\r\nall the great oppositions of theoretical and practical philosophy,\r\nwhich formerly were held to be absolute and irreconcilable, have\r\nbeen modified, restated, reduced to the _relative_ antagonism of the\r\ndifferent aspects of one truth. The great controversies of the past\r\nhave thus passed into a new phase, in which absolute statements _pro_\r\nand _con_ have become, as it were, antiquated; and the question is\r\nno longer whether a particular doctrine or its opposite is true, but\r\nwhat are the elements of truth and error in each of them, and how we\r\ncan attain to a comprehensive view of things, in which justice is done\r\nto both. And if it be asked, what are the principles or ideas that\r\nhave suggested this reconciling work, and have been the guides of the\r\ngreatest scientific or philosophic writers in attempting to achieve\r\nit, I think the answer must be that they are _the idea of organic\r\nunity_, and, as implied in that, _the idea of development_. Goethe and\r\nHegel, in Germany; Comte, in France; Darwin and Spencer, in England,\r\nare writers who almost span the whole range of difference in modern\r\nthought; but they, and a multitude of others in every department of\r\nstudy, have been inspired by the ideas of organism and development.\r\nAnd they have all used them somewhat in the same way to turn the edge\r\nof the old controversial weapons, or to lift thought above the “yes”\r\nand “no” of opposing dogmatisms. It is true that the definitions or\r\ninterpretations of the ideas of organism and development given by these\r\nwriters are very different, and often, indeed, so sharply opposed that\r\nthey seem to bring back the old controversies in a new form. But this\r\ndoes not alter the significance of the general fact; for, in the first\r\nplace, the use of an idea by any writer is by no means always limited\r\nby his own interpretation of it; and, in the second place, the true\r\ninterpretation of the idea is that which contains the secret of its\r\npower and prevalence, and it must in the long run gain the victory over\r\nall other interpretations of it. We may, therefore, fairly say that\r\nthese ideas have been the marked ideas of the century, the conscious\r\nor unconscious stimulus of its best thought; and that they have been\r\nworking, and are working still, in the direction of a deeper and more\r\ncomprehensive irenicon between the different tendencies of the human\r\nmind than has been attained in any previous stage of the history of\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a general characterization of an age, there is the same\r\nobjection which Burke indicated when he said that “he could not draw up\r\nan indictment against a nation.” We are taking a distant and general\r\nview of a period, in which all its inequalities of movement, all the\r\nebb and flow of opinion, are lost sight of, and only one main current\r\nof thought is visible. We may get a step nearer to the subject by\r\ndistinguishing three periods in the century, in which there is a\r\npartial difference of tendency. The first period, which we may roughly\r\ndefine as lasting well on into the 30’s, is, in the main, a period of\r\nconstruction, of creative thought, in which the great germinating ideas\r\nthat distinguished the century are more or less adequately expressed\r\nin different countries, and in which they receive a first, somewhat\r\nhasty, application to all departments of human knowledge. Idealistic\r\nphilosophy, which gave the fullest expression to those ideas, seems\r\nfor a time to carry all before it in Germany; and a similar movement\r\nof thought, less definitely reflective or speculative, enriches the\r\nliterature of other countries. In the next period, lasting until the\r\n70’s, the new ideas do not lose their hold upon men’s minds, but there\r\nis a certain critical recoil against them, a tendency to explain\r\nthem away. The first premature synthesis of idealistic philosophy is\r\nattacked by a scepticism, which seems at times as if it would measure\r\nback the whole way to the individualistic materialism of an earlier\r\nage, or which only avoids that extreme to fall into a scientific\r\nagnosticism, at first sight even more hostile to the claims of\r\nphilosophy. But the lesson of Kant could never be altogether forgotten,\r\nnor could the negative or sceptical tendencies of the _Critique of Pure\r\nReason_ be permanently separated from the positive results of his later\r\nwritings. And the great scientific movement of the time, which at first\r\nseemed to draw away all interest from speculative inquiry, tended in\r\nthe long run, especially by the advance of biological study, to raise\r\nmetaphysical questions which the methods of science were incapable of\r\nanswering. Hence, in the latest decades of the century, there has come\r\na revival of interest in philosophy, and especially in the idealistic\r\nphilosophy of its first years. But if philosophy has revived, it is\r\nin a more critical and cautious form, and accompanied by a clear\r\nconsciousness that the only true idealism is that which is able to\r\nabsorb and assimilate all the data supplied by empirical investigation,\r\nand do justice to all the results of the special sciences. The general\r\nmovement of thought in the nineteenth century has thus, on the whole,\r\ntaken an idealistic direction; but there has come with it also a deeper\r\nconsciousness of the immense difficulty of a comprehensive synthesis;\r\nof the inefficacy of any easy monism or optimism, that would pluck\r\nthe fruit of knowledge before it is ripe; of the infinite labor and\r\npatience, the sympathetic appreciation of the opposing views of others,\r\nand constant and unsparing criticism of our own, which are needed for\r\nthe construction of a true philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn a short article like this, it is impossible to give more than a\r\nfew indications of the way in which this three-fold _schema_ of the\r\nhistory of nineteenth-century philosophy should be filled up. To give\r\nany definite impression, the writer must, so to speak, put on the\r\nseven-leagued boots of Jack the Giant Killer; in other words, however\r\nconscious he may be of the truth that _dolus latet in generalibus_, he\r\nmust generalize and be content to mention only a few leading names in\r\nillustration of the tendencies of thought of which he speaks.\r\n\r\nIt is the instinct of each new generation to vindicate its freedom\r\nby rebelling against the authority of its predecessors; and when a\r\nnew idea begins to influence human thought, it usually, on its first\r\nappearance, shows that side which is most antagonistic to the spirit\r\nof the past. Thus the peculiar nineteenth-century movement begins with\r\na reassertion of the _universal_ as against the _individual_, which\r\nis so emphatic that it looks like a return to Spinozism. Schelling is\r\nthe most prominent philosophical representative of this tendency. In\r\nthe works which he wrote about the beginning of the century, he broke\r\naway even from the universalized individualism of Fichte, and gave\r\nemphatic prominence to the great philosophical commonplace—which had\r\nbeen almost forgotten by the previous age—that there is an identity\r\nwhich is below or above all distinction, and that the universe is one\r\nthrough all its multiplicity, and permanent through all its changes.\r\nHis maxim—that there are none but _quantitative_ differences in\r\nthings, and that all these, even the difference of mind and matter,\r\ndisappear in the “indifference” of the Absolute—was like a declaration\r\nof war against the “enlightenment.” It meant that philosophy was no\r\nlonger content to regard the whole as the sum of the parts, but could\r\nlook upon the distinction of the parts only as a differentiation of\r\nthe whole. With Schelling, indeed, this differentiation was in danger\r\nof being reduced to a mere appearance and the unity of the Absolute\r\nwas on the point of vanishing in a bare or abstract identity. But his\r\nstrong assertion of the unity beneath all difference, of the priority\r\nof the universal to all particulars, was perhaps necessary, ere the\r\ntrue conception of the organic unity of the world could be arrived\r\nat. And the correction soon came with Hegel, who maintained that the\r\nabsolute is “not substance, but subject.” For this meant that the\r\nabsolute is a self-differentiating principle, realizing itself in a\r\nworld of difference which is no mere appearance, but its own essential\r\nmanifestation; and again—what is the counterpart or complementary\r\ntruth to this—that in the world there are “degrees of reality,” and\r\nthat “mind is higher in degree than nature.” But these ideas could\r\nhardly have been understood until the uncompromising assertion of the\r\nabsolute unity had been made, and until the subjectivity of the Kantian\r\nand Fichtean points of view had once for all been set aside.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Hegel derives its power from the way in which\r\nit strikes what, as I have already said, was the key-note of the\r\nnineteenth-century philosophy. In the first place, it is a philosophy\r\nof reconciliation, which attempts, through a criticism of the\r\noppositions of philosophical theory, to reach a point of view in\r\nwhich they are all seen to be subordinated to the unity of one\r\nprinciple. His attack upon the “law of contradiction,” as formulated\r\nby scholastic logicians, meant simply that absolute distinctions are\r\nunmeaning, and that the only real differences are differences within\r\na unity. On this principle he tried to show that all the oppositions\r\nof thought and things which have found expression in philosophy are\r\nrelative oppositions, which find a solution or reconciliation in the\r\nlife and movement of the whole. Hence he maintained that in all the\r\ngreat controversies that have divided the world, in metaphysics and\r\npsychology, in ethics and theology, the combatants have really been\r\nco-operators. Both sides, to use the expression of Leibnitz, have been\r\n“right in what they affirmed and wrong only in what they denied.”\r\nAnd their conflict has been the means of the evolution of a fuller\r\ntruth than that which was contained in the doctrine of either party.\r\nIn the second place, Hegel is guided throughout by the conception of\r\nthe universe—and, in a sense, of every even relatively independent\r\nexistence in it—as an organism, every element in which implies the\r\nwhole, every change in which is a phase of its self-evolution. For\r\nhis logical doctrine of the “_notion_” (as _Begriff_ is commonly\r\ntranslated) means simply that we do not see anything truly until\r\nwe comprehend it as a whole, in which one principle manifests\r\nitself through all the difference of the parts and—just through\r\ntheir distinctions and their relations—binds itself into one\r\nindividual—reality. In this sense, everything just so far as it has\r\nan independent individual existence at all is an organism. Lastly,\r\nwhile thus conceiving the universe as organic, Hegel maintained that\r\nit is not a natural but a spiritual organism. For the limited scope of\r\na natural organism and its process cannot be regarded as commensurate\r\nwith a universe, which comprehends all existence, whether classed as\r\norganic or inorganic. Only the conscious and self-conscious unity\r\nof mind can overreach and overcome such extreme antagonisms, and\r\nreduce them all to elements in the realization of its own life. We\r\nmust, therefore, think of the universe as an organism which includes\r\nnature, but manifests its ultimate principle only in the life of man.\r\nWe may add that in all this Hegel attempted to show that he was only\r\nworking out in the sphere of speculative thought what Christianity had\r\nalready expressed for the ordinary consciousness, according to its\r\nhalf-pictorial methods of representation.\r\n\r\nWhile this is the general meaning of Hegelianism, it must be added\r\nthat Hegel was more successful in formulating these ideas in their\r\nlogical or metaphysical form than in applying them to the results of\r\nthe special sciences of nature, which he only knew at second hand; or\r\neven to the different provinces of the spiritual life and history of\r\nman, which he had studied more thoroughly. In both cases his data were\r\nvery incomplete, and the scientific interpretation of them had not then\r\nbeen carried far enough to prepare—as, according to Hegel himself, it\r\nshould prepare—for the final interpretation of philosophy. There is\r\nanother circumstance to be taken into account, a circumstance which\r\ndeeply affected Hegel and all the writers of his time. In the slow\r\nprocess of human history the new wine is always at first poured into\r\nold bottles, and only when the old bottles burst is an effort made\r\nto find new ones that will contain it safely. Hence the development\r\nof the new spirit in philosophy seemed often to go hand-in-hand with\r\na movement of restoration in politics and religion which was not\r\neasily distinguishable from reaction. Just as the politicians of the\r\ntime could find for the newly awakened spirit of nationality no other\r\nembodiment than the institutions of the ancient _régime_, and tried\r\nto revive the old system destroyed by the Revolution, with only a\r\nfew repairs and additions, so the great philosophical writers sought\r\ngenerally to reanimate the old scheme of life and thought by means of\r\nthe new ideas, rather than completely to recast it in accordance with\r\nthem. Hence, although Hegel’s _principle_ of evolution was as hostile\r\nto reaction as to revolution, as hostile to an authoritative system\r\nthat denied the rights of the individual as to mere individualism, his\r\nparticular doctrines, both in politics and theology, took a strongly\r\nconservative tinge. When we look more closely we see that it is only as\r\nrestoration is at the same time reformation, as it makes the old forms\r\nthe expression of a new life, that Hegel could logically defend them.\r\nBut the form which he gave to his ideas was perplexing; it tended in\r\nmany minds to identify the principle of development, which means that\r\nthe future can only spring _out_ of the past and the present, with the\r\ndefence of the _status quo_ in Church and State; and, on the other\r\nhand, to confuse the forces of progress with those of revolution. Thus\r\nthe mediating, reconciling power of the new doctrine was for a time\r\nobscured, and its effect in raising men’s minds above the old levels of\r\ncontroversy was delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn other countries during the earlier decades of the century a similar\r\nmovement of thought is discernible, though it was not carried out\r\nanywhere with the same philosophical thoroughness as in Germany. In\r\nFrance the organic idea did not find any very powerful representative\r\ntill the time of Comte, and even in his expression of it there is a\r\ncertain ambiguity. In his well-known law of development, indeed, he\r\nseems to reproduce the individualistic doctrine of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and to deny the reality of the _universal_, both in its\r\ntheological and its philosophical form. But already in the last volume\r\nof his _Positive Philosophy_, when he begins to deal with human\r\nsociety, he maintains that “the individual man is an abstraction,\r\nand that there is nothing real but humanity”; and in his _Positive\r\nPolitics_ he treats this unity of mankind as not only real, but divine.\r\nIn that work, moreover, he makes another step. Rejecting at once the\r\nobstructions of the individualists and those of the socialists, he\r\nrises to the conception of a social organism, which gives play to\r\nthe competitive energy of individuals, and yet binds them together\r\nin its own more comprehensive life. In England, before the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century, the same spirit had found a representative\r\nin Burke, who rejected entirely the idea of a social contract, and\r\nmaintained that the State is based on an unconscious reason of\r\nsociety, which is far wiser than the conscious reason of even the\r\nwisest individuals. In general, however, the spiritualistic movement\r\nof the earlier part of the century took, among the English-speaking\r\npeople, rather a poetic and literary than a philosophical form.\r\nAnd the imperfect attempts of Coleridge to transplant German ideas\r\ninto England—attempts followed up with signal energy by Frederic\r\nDenison Maurice—hardly constitute an exception to this rule. In\r\nthis connection, also, as one who partly grasped the organic idea of\r\nsocial life and its development, but who gave it a somewhat imperfect\r\nand even contradictory expression, I may mention a later writer,\r\nThomas Carlyle, whose imaginative genius and moral enthusiasm did\r\nmuch to breathe a new life into history. Though not a philosopher in\r\nany technical sense, he was, like his friend Emerson, a vehicle of\r\nphilosophical ideas, and he contributed greatly to scatter the seed of\r\nidealism upon British soil. His Calvinistic pessimism, indeed, makes a\r\ncurious contrast with the fearless optimism of the new country which is\r\ncharacteristic of Emerson; but whether great men are to be regarded as\r\n“heroes to be worshipped,” according to the teaching of the one, or as\r\n“representative men,” who are to be followed because they express what\r\nall are thinking, according to the ideas of the other, we are led, in\r\nboth cases, to a deeper view of the solidarity of human society and of\r\nits spiritual basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine more than approximately the beginning\r\nof special movements of thought; for the different nations of the\r\ncivilized world are not exactly contemporaneous in their development,\r\nand in each nation there are always individuals who lag behind the time\r\nor hasten on before it. But, speaking generally, we may say that as\r\nearly as the fourth decade of the century a certain reaction had set\r\nin against the conclusions of idealistic philosophy, and especially\r\nagainst the organic idea of human life; and a tendency was even\r\nshown to revert, so far as possible, to the methods and ideas of the\r\neighteenth century. The reasons for this change are various. In Germany\r\nthe succession of great philosophers had come to an end, and their\r\nfollowers were smaller men, who were inclined too much to repeat the\r\nformulas, but had little of the creative power, of their predecessors.\r\nMore attention, therefore, began to be paid to the protests of writers\r\nlike Herbart and Schopenhauer, who, even in the hour of its triumph,\r\nhad criticised and attacked the prevailing philosophy. Again, the\r\nphysical sciences were advancing by “leaps and bounds,” and there was\r\na growing inclination to believe in the universal validity of the\r\nmechanical methods of explanation to which _they_ owed their success,\r\nand even in those sociological and historical studies to which the\r\nidealistic philosophy had given so great an impetus. The progress of\r\nempirical research and the increase of the materials of knowledge\r\ncaused much of the work of Hegel and his followers to seem inadequate,\r\nif not entirely to set it aside. Even in Germany, where the new ideas\r\nhad taken a distinctly philosophical shape, they seemed to lose\r\ntheir hold in the controversies that attended the breaking up of the\r\nHegelian school; and in other countries, where they never found such a\r\nsystematic expression, they were even less able to resist the attack\r\nnow made upon them. Furthermore, as I have already indicated, writers\r\nof an idealistic tendency, in their recoil from the enlightenment, had\r\ndevoted themselves so much to an appreciation of institutions derived\r\nfrom the past that they seemed to have no eyes for the defects of these\r\ninstitutions, and to confuse evolution with restoration.\r\n\r\nThe general result of all these influences was, then, to discredit\r\nphilosophy and exalt science, so far as might be, into its place.\r\nEither the abstract methods of the physical sciences were proclaimed\r\nas adequate for the discovery of all truth, or, if this was seen to\r\nbe impossible, agnosticism was professed in regard to all subjects\r\nto which these methods could not be applied. Even the phenomena of\r\nlife were supposed to be capable of explanation by the action and\r\nreaction of the parts or elements of the physical organism, and Huxley\r\nlooked forward to the time when man with all his spiritual endowments\r\nshould be shown to be only the “cunningest of nature’s clocks.” The\r\nnew science of psychophysics, which arose in Germany and has been\r\ncultivated with so much zeal by Wundt and others in all civilized\r\ncountries, seemed to carry the method of physics into the investigation\r\nof mind, and some of its students were ready to maintain that it\r\nwas the only psychology that deserved the name of science. Darwin’s\r\ngreat work on the _Origin of Species_, in so far as it set aside the\r\nidea of special creation and referred the “purposiveness” of organic\r\nstructures to a process in which the external environment, and not any\r\ninward power of self-adaptation, was the controlling factor, seemed\r\nto bring a new reinforcement to the same way of thinking. And he and\r\nhis followers were not slow to apply the theory of natural selection\r\nto the life of man, as well as to that of plants and animals. Finally,\r\nthe historical studies, which were now cultivated with an energy to an\r\nextent hitherto unexampled, and immensely extended the knowledge of the\r\nprocess whereby the present has grown out of the past, were invaded\r\nby a similar spirit; and the historical method was maintained to be a\r\nsolvent which could disintegrate all metaphysical conceptions of ethics\r\nor politics or even of theology. The account of the genesis of any\r\nidea was regarded as reducing its claims to the level of the elements\r\nor rudiments out of which it had sprung, and thus as enabling the\r\nscientific historian to explain, or explain away, the spiritual by the\r\nnatural in all human life and experience. All things appeared again to\r\nbe pointing towards a system of thought which would resolve ethics and\r\npsychology into physiology, and physiology into chemistry and physics.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the victory of this tendency was always more apparent\r\nthan real. In the first place, “out of the eater came forth meat”—that\r\nvery advance of the special sciences, which in its earlier stages had\r\ntended to throw all speculative thought into the shade, in the long run\r\ncaused the need of philosophy to be again felt. In particular, the\r\nstudy of development in the organic world, which had received so great\r\na stimulus from the work of Darwin, could not be carried on without\r\nthe aid of higher conceptions than were required for the guidance\r\nof the physicist. The hypothesis of natural selection might expel\r\nthe idea of design in the cruder form of a special creation of every\r\ndistinct species; and the emphasis which it had laid upon the outward\r\nconditions of growth might seem unfavorable to the higher conception\r\nof an immanent teleology of the organism, but it was confessed by\r\nits author to be an incomplete theory of development, and Darwin\r\nhimself, when he turned his attention to the evolution of man, found\r\nit necessary to supplement it by what might be called the converse\r\ntheory of sexual selection; thus adding a principle of co-operation\r\nto his first principle of competition. And Mr. Spencer, who defined\r\ngrowth as a process of integration and differentiation, little as he\r\nmight himself intend it, was really putting into popular language the\r\nHegelian idea of evolution—an idea which necessarily involved the\r\nconception of a self-determined end. Evolutionists might cling, as they\r\nstill cling, to the belief that, though constantly and necessarily\r\nspeaking of purpose, they could eliminate it from the result of their\r\ninvestigations by the hypothesis of Darwin, or, subsequently, of\r\nWeissmann; but their discussions, especially when they were extended\r\nto the historical development of man, could not but reawaken the great\r\ncontroversy whether in the _ultimate_ explanation of things it is more\r\nreasonable to “level up,” or to “level down,” to explain the higher\r\nby the lower, or the lower by the higher. That both explanations are\r\nnecessary, nay, that no teleology can be of much worth which does not\r\npresuppose a thorough inquiry into the causal connections of particular\r\nphenomena, was admitted by all modern idealists. But they began to\r\npress the question whether the unity of the whole is not prior to\r\nits distribution into parts, and does not govern their relations with\r\neach other; and, in particular, whether it is possible in the case\r\nof organic beings, and especially of organic beings possessed of\r\nconsciousness and self-consciousness, to be satisfied with a mode of\r\nexplanation that treats them as mere collections of material elements\r\nwhich act and react externally upon each other. Whatever its value as\r\na provisional hypothesis, can such a mode of explanation be finally\r\nregarded as adequate for the explanation of the nature of the world\r\nas a whole, or, indeed, of any one existence in it, that has even a\r\nrelative independence or separate being of its own?\r\n\r\nBut, in the second place, a revival of the idealistic philosophy was\r\nmade necessary by an obvious weakness which clung to the scientific\r\nmaterialism of the nineteenth century from the very beginning. The\r\nKantian criticism of knowledge, which could not be entirely neglected,\r\nhad convincingly proved that in our experience objects can be known\r\nonly in relation to a subject, and matter only in relation to mind.\r\nBut, if so, how could the latter be explained by the former? Even\r\nto those who had not fully understood this doctrine, it became\r\nevident that mind is at least co-ordinate with matter, and cannot be\r\ntreated as a mere “_epiphenomenon_” of it. Mr. Spencer, therefore,\r\nhad to take refuge in the strange notion that we are possessed of\r\n“two consciousnesses”: the consciousness of ideas within us, and the\r\nconsciousness of motions without us; and that neither of these can be\r\nresolved into the other, though both are the phenomena of an unknowable\r\nAbsolute. It is in this citadel of ignorance that Huxley tries to\r\nintrench himself; but the place was taken before it could be occupied.\r\nThe self-contradiction of an unknowable Absolute, and the equal though\r\nless obvious self-contradiction of a dualistic separation between\r\ntwo aspects of our life—which, as a matter of fact, are never,\r\nand logically can never be, divided—could not long be maintained\r\nagainst a criticism armed with the weapons of Kant and his idealistic\r\nsuccessors. Already, in the 50’s, the cry “Back to Kant” was raised\r\nin Germany, and, not long after, it led in England and America to a\r\nrenewed study of the German idealistic writers, in which Dr. Hutchison\r\nSterling and the late Professor Green took a leading part. It was soon\r\nobvious to every one who had learned the lesson of critical philosophy\r\nthat the agnostic dualism of Mr. Spencer was due to a fundamental\r\nmisconception of what is meant by the subjectivity of knowledge. It was\r\npointed out that if we have the consciousness of object and subject\r\nonly in relation to each other, it is not necessary to seek for the\r\nprinciple of their unity in any _Tertium Quid_ which is neither the\r\none nor the other. That which Mr. Spencer sought in an unknowable\r\nAbsolute was “in our mouths and in our hearts”; it was to be found\r\nin the inseparable unity of experience, in which the inward and the\r\noutward are correlative elements. Agnosticism was a sort of spiritual\r\nrefuge for the destitute constructed by those who had renounced their\r\nheritage: who, in other words, had by their abstractions separated the\r\nelements of experience from each other, and were thus forced to seek\r\nbeyond experience for the unity which they had lost. The true remedy\r\nfor the evil was to give up such abstract ways of thinking and to learn\r\nto “think things together”; in other words, to recognize the organic\r\nrelation of the inner and the outer life, and to explain the parts by\r\nthe whole, and not the whole by the artificially severed parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe great distinguishing feature of the last two decades of the century\r\nhas been a movement of approximation, partly conscious and partly\r\nunconscious, between the representatives of science, and particularly\r\nof those sciences that deal with special aspects or elements of\r\nhuman life, on the one hand, and the representatives of idealistic\r\nphilosophy on the other. The reconciling ideas of an earlier time\r\nhave become better understood and have shown more effectively their\r\npower to reconcile. Not that this mediating power had previously been\r\nentirely unfelt. Even in the time when philosophy was most discredited\r\nin Germany, Lotze, in whom a cautious critical temper was combined\r\nwith deep moral and religious sympathies, and a practical knowledge\r\nof the biological and medical sciences with careful studies of Kant\r\nand Hegel, sought to show how an idealistic view of the universe\r\nand of human life could be maintained consistently with the fullest\r\nrecognition of scientific methods and results. And though his system\r\nwas, on the whole, rather a compromise than a true reconciliation\r\nof philosophy and science, yet it has undoubtedly had very great\r\ninfluence in modifying the ideas of the opposing schools of thought\r\nand narrowing the ground of controversy between them. Thus the old\r\nEnglish empirical psychology, which was represented by the Mills and\r\nby Mr. Bain, has gradually widened its scope in the hands of writers\r\nlike Professor Ward and Mr. Stout, at first probably through the study\r\nof Herbart and then by contact with the revived idealistic movement.\r\nOn the other hand, we may notice how idealistic writers, like Mr.\r\nBradley and Mr. Bosanquet, have tried to absorb every lesson that can\r\nbe learned from empiricism, and to shun with the utmost care the very\r\nsuspicion of anything like dogmatism. Mr. Bradley’s denunciations of\r\na “too easy monism” and a philosophy that turns the living world into\r\na “ballet of bloodless categories” are too well known to be more than\r\nreferred to. Nor is this the place to discuss whether his fear of\r\nsuch a result has not sometimes led him into compromises which are\r\ninconsistent with his own fundamental principle that the world must be\r\nconceived as an intelligible system. In any case, we may fairly point\r\nto his work and to the work of other writers animated by a similar\r\nspirit, as showing the growing prevalence of that reconciling spirit\r\nwhich seeks at once to do justice to all the results of empirical\r\ninquiry and of the investigations of the special sciences, and yet\r\nat the same time to give them a new interpretation in the light of\r\nan idealistic philosophy. It is impossible within our limits to\r\nillustrate this view of the tendencies of the time by further reference\r\nto the recent philosophical literature of England and America, or of\r\nGermany and France. Still less can I refer to the numerous books on\r\nspecial departments of inquiry in ethics and theology, in sociology\r\nand in history, in which the “ideally organic view of life and the\r\nworld,” as we may call it, has shown its mediating and reconciling\r\ninfluence. Nor can I do more than refer to the counter current of\r\npessimism, which has found its most distinguished representatives in\r\nHartmann and Nietzsche; the former a man of great wealth of thought\r\nand dialectical power, whose philosophy is idealistic in all but its\r\nultimate principle, and is indeed pessimistic only by an exaggeration\r\nof the opposition between the conscious and the unconscious working of\r\nreason; the latter, hardly a philosopher at all but rather a writer\r\nof pungent and suggestive aphorisms, winged with indignant passion\r\nagainst prevalent opinions—aphorisms which always contradict some one,\r\nand often contradict each other. From Nietzsche at his best we may\r\nreceive a useful warning against too easily satisfying ourselves with\r\nthe commonplaces of idealistic optimism; from Hartmann we may derive\r\nvery considerable help in estimating the difficulties that have to be\r\nmet by those who would seek to work out idealistic principles into a\r\nsystematic view of the world. But, without attempting to enter upon any\r\nmore detailed criticism of these or other important writers of recent\r\nyears, I shall devote the space that remains to one general thought as\r\nto the present state of controversy, in relation to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nEver since the revival of the study of Kant, the main conflict in\r\nphilosophy has ceased to lie between materialism and idealism.\r\nIt has rather become a conflict between those who take up some\r\nposition analogous to that of Kant and those who seek to carry out\r\nthe idealistic principle to all its consequences. For the essential\r\ncharacteristic of Kant’s position lay in his sharp division between\r\nthe spheres of knowledge and of faith—between a knowledge which was\r\nconfined to phenomena and their connection in experience, and a faith\r\nof practical reason, which reached beyond experience to apprehend that\r\nwhich is noumenally real. Even the agnosticism of Mr. Spencer might\r\nbe regarded as a modification of the Kantian point of view, in so far\r\nas his denial of the possibility of knowing the absolute is based on\r\nMansel’s version of the Kantian antinomies; while his description of\r\nthe “vague consciousness” of the absolute which he bids us worship may\r\nbe regarded as representing that faith which, in Kant’s view, enables\r\nus to pierce the veil of the phenomena and grasp the ultimate reality\r\nof things. And in the latter part of the century there has been a\r\ncontinual germination of similar theories, theories agreeing with the\r\nKantian philosophy at least in making some kind of dualistic division\r\nbetween the sphere of clearly defined knowledge and the sphere of ideal\r\nor spiritual faith, and also in confining the former to phenomena\r\nwhile the latter is held to be capable of rising in some way from the\r\nphenomenal to the real. One of the earliest fruits of the Neo-Kantian\r\nmovement in Germany was Lange’s _History of Materialism_, which\r\ninsisted on the strictest interpretation of the lesson of the _Critique\r\nof Pure Reason_, that scientific knowledge is confined to the empirical\r\nand phenomenal, but which maintained also the chartered freedom of\r\nimagination to feed our hopes with the idea of a world not realized,\r\nor realizable, under the conditions of finite experience. And, with\r\na different aim, but in a similar spirit, Ritschl, borrowing some of\r\nhis weapons from Lotze, sought to take away from philosophy the right\r\nto investigate the spiritual truths of religion, and maintained that\r\nsuch truths were given in a kind of intuition of faith which is above\r\ncriticism and which some of his followers identify, like Kant, with\r\nthe demands or postulates of the moral consciousness. Other writers,\r\nfollowing Schopenhauer, have sought to emancipate the will from the\r\nintelligence and to give it an independent power of estimating values.\r\nThe great effort to bring science and philosophy together—which, as\r\nwe have seen, has characterized the later years of the century—has\r\nitself naturally given rise to many such dualistic compromises, of\r\nwhich Lotze’s philosophy was among the earliest. And it is partly to\r\nLotze’s influence that we owe the tendency, visible in some of the most\r\nimportant recent contributions to philosophy, to regard our actual\r\nexperience as having an intuitive completeness which is beyond all\r\nanalysis, while reflective thought on the other hand is conceived as\r\nhaving a purely analytic and discursive operation, which can grasp only\r\nthe severed fragments of the given reality and connect them externally\r\nto each other, but which can never restore the organic whole again.\r\nHere, too, we seem by another way to be landed in the same conclusion,\r\nviz., that we are perpetually poised between an ideal which we cannot\r\nverify, but which yet is held to be our only vision of reality, and a\r\ndefinite result of knowledge, which only gives us what is abstract and\r\nphenomenal. Yet it is difficult to understand how such an organic idea\r\nof the universe can exist except for the thinking intelligence, and how\r\nthe thought that grasps it can be separated from the discursive thought\r\nby which the different elements of reality are brought into relation.\r\nHow, indeed, can there be any thought which is not both discursive and\r\nintuitive at once, any thought which connects the parts without resting\r\nupon the unity of the whole to which they belong?\r\n\r\nAll these different compromises are really different forms of the\r\nKantian dualism, but they supply convenient cities of refuge for those\r\nwho are unwilling to admit that faith is but implicit reason, and\r\nthat it is always possible to translate its intuitions of truth into\r\nexplicit logic. There is much excuse, indeed, in many cases for such\r\nunwillingness when we consider how often reason has presented itself\r\nas purely a critical or dissolving power, and how often abstract\r\ntheories which grasp only one aspect of things have been set forth as\r\ncomplete explanations of religion or morality or some other of the\r\nhigher interests of life. It has always to be kept in view that it\r\nis in something like immediate perception that truth is given in the\r\nfirst instance, and that philosophy, therefore, must always be in a\r\nsense toiling after the intuitions of faith. Yet, on the other hand,\r\nto hold that there is anywhere an abstract division between the two is\r\nto hold that faith is essentially irrational; it is to exalt it above\r\nreason in a way that inevitably leads in the end to its being depressed\r\nbelow reason. If, however, this view can be maintained it must lead in\r\nthe long run to the rejection of all dualistic compromises. And there\r\nare already many who hold that after the unstable equilibrium of the\r\nKantian theory has been shaken there is no secure standing-ground for\r\nphilosophy short of a thorough-going idealism. Yet even they have\r\nlearned by experience how dangerous it is to snatch prematurely at the\r\nreadiest idealistic interpretation of facts; and they are aware how\r\neasy it is to fall into a simple optimistic theory, which slurs over\r\ndifficulties instead of solving them. They know that if Hegel or any\r\none ever pretended, or could reasonably be interpreted as pretending,\r\nto construe the universe _a priori_, the pretence was futile, and\r\nthat a true and valuable idealism can be reached only through the\r\ninterpretation of the data of experience by the special sciences, and\r\nthe reinterpretation of the results of these sciences by philosophy.\r\nThey hold, in short, that if the well-known saying of Hegel is to\r\nbe taken for truth, both of its clauses must be equally emphasized,\r\nand that no philosophy can safely maintain that “what is rational is\r\nactual” which has not gone through all the effort that is necessary to\r\nprove that “what is actual is rational.”\r\n\r\n            EDWARD CAIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nFor countless generations the prophets and kings of humanity have\r\ndesired to see the things which men have seen, and to hear the things\r\nwhich men have heard in the course of the wonderful nineteenth century.\r\nTo the call of the watchers on the towers of progress there had been\r\nthe one sad answer—the people sit in darkness and in the shadow of\r\ndeath. Politically, socially, and morally the race had improved,\r\nbut for the unit, for the individual, there was little hope. Cold\r\nphilosophy shed a glimmer of light on his path, religion in its various\r\nguises illumined his sad heart, but neither availed to lift the curse\r\nof suffering from the sin-begotten son of Adam. In the fulness of time,\r\nlong expected, long delayed, at last Science emptied upon him from\r\nthe horn of Amalthea blessings which cannot be enumerated, blessings\r\nwhich have made the century forever memorable; and which have followed\r\neach other with a rapidity so bewildering that we know not what next\r\nto expect. To us in the medical profession, who deal with this unit,\r\nand measure progress by the law of the greatest happiness to the\r\ngreatest number, to us whose work is with the sick and suffering,\r\nthe great boon of this wonderful century, with which no other can be\r\ncompared, is the fact that the leaves of the tree of Science have been\r\nfor the healing of the nations. Measure as we may the progress of the\r\nworld—materially, in the advantages of steam, electricity, and other\r\nmechanical appliances; sociologically, in the great improvement in\r\nthe conditions of life; intellectually, in the diffusion of education;\r\nmorally, in a possibly higher standard of ethics—there is no one\r\nmeasure which can compare with the decrease of physical suffering in\r\nman, woman, and child when stricken by disease or accident. This is the\r\none fact of supreme personal import to every one of us. This is the\r\nPromethean gift of the century to man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC MEDICINE\r\n\r\nThe century opened auspiciously, and those who were awake saw signs of\r\nthe dawn. The spirit of Science was brooding on the waters. In England\r\nthe influence of John Hunter stimulated the younger men to the study\r\nof the problems of anatomy and pathology. On the Continent the great\r\nBoorhaave—the Batavian Hippocrates—had taught correct ways in the\r\nstudy of the clinical aspects of disease, and the work of Haller had\r\ngiven a great impetus to physiology. The researches of Morgagni had,\r\nas Virchow had remarked, introduced anatomical thinking into medicine.\r\nBut theories still controlled practice. Under the teaching of Cullen,\r\nthe old idea that humors were the seat of disease had given place to a\r\nneuro-pathology which recognized the paramount influence of the nervous\r\nsystem in disease. His colleague at Edinburgh, Brown, brought forward\r\nthe attractive theory that all diseases could be divided into two\r\ngroups, the one caused by excess of excitement—the sthenic—the other\r\nby a deficiency—the asthenic—each having its appropriate treatment,\r\nthe one by depletion, the other by stimulation. In a certain measure\r\nHahnemann’s theory of homœopathy was a reaction against the prevalent\r\ntheories of the day, and has survived through the century, though in a\r\nmuch modified form. Some of his views were as follows:\r\n\r\n“The only vocation of the physician is to heal; theoretical knowledge\r\nis of no use. In a case of sickness he should only know what is curable\r\nand the remedies. Of the diseases he cannot know anything except the\r\nsymptoms. There are internal changes, but it is impossible to learn\r\nwhat they are; symptoms alone are accessible; with their removal by\r\nremedies the disease is removed. Their effects can be studied in the\r\nhealthy only. They act on the sick by causing a disease similar to that\r\nwhich is to be combated, and which dissolves itself into this similar\r\naffection. The full doses required to cause symptoms in the well are\r\ntoo large to be employed as remedies for the sick. The healing power\r\nof a drug grows in an inverse proportion to its substance. He says,\r\nliterally: ‘Only potencies are homœopathic medicines.’ ‘I recognize\r\nnobody as my follower but him who gives medicine in so small doses\r\nas to preclude the perception of anything medicinal in them by means\r\neither of the senses or of chemistry.’ ‘The pellets may be held near\r\nthe young infant when asleep.’ ‘Gliding the hand over the patient\r\nwill cure him, provided the manipulation is done with firm intention\r\nto render as much good with it as possible, for its power is in\r\nthe benevolent will of the manipulator.’ Such is the homœopathy of\r\nHahnemann, which is no longer recognized in what they call homœopathy\r\nto-day.”—(A. JACOBI.)\r\n\r\nThe awakening came in France. In 1801 Bichat, a young man, published\r\na work on general anatomy, in which he placed the seat of disease,\r\nnot in the organs, but in the tissues or fabrics of which they were\r\ncomposed, which gave an extraordinary impetus to the investigation\r\nof pathological changes. Meanwhile, the study of the appearances of\r\norgans and bodies when diseased (morbid anatomy), which had been\r\nprosecuted with vigor by Morgagni in the eighteenth century, had been\r\ncarried on actively in Great Britain and on the Continent, and the\r\nwork of Broussais stimulated a more accurate investigation of local\r\ndisorders. The discovery by Laennec of the art of auscultation, by\r\nwhich, through changes in the normal sounds within the chest, various\r\ndiseases of the heart and lungs could be recognized, gave an immense\r\nimpetus to clinical research. The art of percussion, discovered by\r\nAvenbrugger in the eighteenth century, and reintroduced by Corvisart,\r\ncontributed not a little to the same. Laennec’s contributions to the\r\nstudy of diseases of the lungs, of the heart, and of the abdominal\r\norgans really laid the foundation of modern clinical medicine. A little\r\nlater Bright published his researches on diseases of the kidneys, from\r\nwhich we date our knowledge of this important subject. One of the most\r\ncomplicated problems of the first half of the century related to the\r\ndifferentiation of the fevers. The eruptive fevers, measles, scarlet\r\nfever, and small-pox, were easily recognized, and the great group of\r\nmalarial fevers was well known; but there remained the large class of\r\ncontinued fevers, which had been a source of worry and dispute for\r\nmany generations. Louis clearly differentiated typhoid fever, and by\r\nthe work of his American pupils, W. W. Gerhard and Alfred Stillé, of\r\nPhiladelphia, and George B. Shattuck, of Boston, typhus and typhoid\r\nfevers were defined as separate and independent affections. Relapsing\r\nfever, yellow fever, dengue, etc., were also distinguished. The work of\r\nGraves and Stokes, of Dublin, of Jenner and Budd, in England, of Drake,\r\nDickson, and Flint, in America, supplemented the labors of the French\r\nphysicians, and by the year 1860 the profession had reached a sure and\r\nsafe position on the question of the clinical aspects of fevers.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguishing feature of the scientific medicine of\r\nthe century has been the phenomenal results which have followed\r\n_experimental investigations_. While this method of research is not\r\nnew, since it was introduced by Galen, perfected by Harvey, and\r\ncarried on by Hunter, it was not until well into the middle of the\r\ncentury that, by the growth of research laboratories, the method\r\nexercised a deep influence on progress. The lines of experimental\r\nresearch have sought to determine the functions of the organs in\r\nhealth, the conditions under which perversion of these functions occur\r\nin diseases, and the possibility of exercising protective and curative\r\ninfluences on the processes of disease.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the physiological laboratories have enlarged in every\r\ndirection our knowledge of the great functions of life—digestion,\r\nassimilation, circulation, respiration, and excretion. Perhaps in no\r\ndepartment have the results been more surprising than in the growth\r\nof our knowledge of the functions of the brain and nerves. Not only\r\nhas experimental science given us clear and accurate data upon the\r\nlocalization of certain functions of the brain and of the paths of\r\nsensatory and of motor impulses, but it has opened an entirely new\r\nfield in the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases of these organs,\r\nin certain directions of a most practical nature, enabling us to resort\r\nto measures of relief undreamed of even thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe study of physiology and pathology within the past half-century\r\nhas done more to emancipate medicine from routine and the thraldom of\r\nauthority than all the work of all the physicians from the days of\r\nHippocrates to Jenner, and we are as yet but on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF SPECIALISM\r\n\r\nThe restriction of the energies of trained students to narrow fields\r\nin science, while not without its faults, has been the most important\r\nsingle factor in the remarkable expansion of our knowledge. Against\r\nthe disadvantages in a loss of breadth and harmony there is the\r\ncompensatory benefit of a greater accuracy in the application of\r\nknowledge in specialism, as is well illustrated in the cultivation of\r\nspecial branches of practice. Diseases of the skin, of the eye, of the\r\near, of the throat, of the teeth, diseases of women and of children,\r\nare now studied and practised by men who devote all their time to one\r\nlimited field of work. While not without minor evils, this custom\r\nhas yielded some of the great triumphs of the profession. Dentistry,\r\nophthalmology, and gynæcology are branches which have been brought\r\nto a state of comparative perfection, and very largely by the labors\r\nof American physicians. In the last-named branch the blessings which\r\nhave been brought to suffering women are incalculable, not only as\r\nregards the minor ailments of life, but in the graver and more critical\r\naccidents to which the sex is liable.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and beneficial reforms of the century has\r\nbeen in the attitude of the profession and the public to the subject of\r\ninsanity, and the gradual formation of a body of men in the profession\r\nwho labor to find out the cause and means of relief of this most\r\ndistressing of all human maladies. The reform movement inaugurated by\r\nTuke in England, by Rush in the United States, by Pinel and Esquirol in\r\nFrance, and by Jacobi and Hasse in Germany, has spread to all civilized\r\ncountries, and has led not only to an amelioration and improvement in\r\nthe care of the insane, but to a scientific study of the subject which\r\nhas already been productive of much good. In this country, while the\r\ntreatment of the insane is careful and humanitarian, the unfortunate\r\naffiliation of insanity with politics is still in many States a serious\r\nhinderance to progress.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to take a glance at the state of medicine in\r\nthis country at the opening of the nineteenth century. There were\r\nonly three schools of medicine, the most important of which were the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and the Harvard. There were only two\r\ngeneral hospitals. The medical education was chiefly in the hands of\r\nthe practitioners, who took students as apprentices for a certain\r\nnumber of years. The well-to-do students and those wishing a better\r\nclass of education went to Edinburgh or London. There were only two or\r\nthree medical journals, and very few books had been published in the\r\ncountry, and the profession was dependent entirely upon translations\r\nfrom the French and upon English works. The only medical libraries\r\nwere in connection with the Pennsylvania Hospital and the New York\r\nHospital. The leading practitioners in the early years were Rush and\r\nPhysick, in Philadelphia; Hossack and Mitchill, in New York; and James\r\nJackson and John Collins Warren, in Boston. There were throughout the\r\ncountry, in smaller places, men of great capabilities and energy, such\r\nas Nathan Smith, the founder of the Medical Schools of Dartmouth and of\r\nYale, and Daniel Drake in Cincinnati. After 1830 a remarkable change\r\ntook place in the profession, owing to the leaven of French science\r\nbrought back from Paris by American students. Between 1840 and 1870\r\nthere was a great increase in the number of medical schools, but the\r\ngeneral standard of education was low—lower, indeed, than had ever\r\nbefore been reached in the medical profession. The private schools\r\nmultiplied rapidly, diplomas were given on short two-year sessions, and\r\nnothing contributed more to the degeneration of the profession than\r\nthis competition and rivalry between ill-equipped medical schools. The\r\nreformation, which started at Harvard shortly after 1870, spread over\r\nthe entire country, and the rapid evolution of the medical school has\r\nbeen one of the most striking phenomena in the history of medicine\r\nin the century. University authorities began to appreciate the fact\r\nthat medicine was a great department of knowledge, to be cultivated\r\nas a science and promoted as an art. Wealthy men felt that in no\r\nbetter way could they contribute to the progress of the race than\r\nby the establishment of laboratories for the study of disease and\r\nhospitals for the care of the sick poor. The benefactions of Johns\r\nHopkins, of Sims, of Vanderbilt, of Pierpont Morgan, of Strathcona, of\r\nMount-Stephen, of Payne, and of Levi C. Lane and others have placed\r\nscientific medicine on a firm basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE\r\n\r\nSanitary science, hygiene, or preventive medicine may claim to be one\r\nof the brightest spots in the history of the nineteenth century. Public\r\nhygiene was cultivated among the Egyptians, and in the Mosaic law it\r\nreached a remarkable organization. The personal hygiene of the Greeks\r\nwas embraced in the saying, “The fair mind in the fair body,” and the\r\nvalue of exercise and training was fully recognized. The Romans, too,\r\nin public and private hygiene, were our superiors in the matter of\r\nwater supply and baths. But modern sanitary science has a much wider\r\nscope and is concerned with the causes of disease quite as much as with\r\nthe conditions under which these diseases prevail. The foundations of\r\nthe science were laid in the last century with Jenner’s discovery of\r\nvaccination. Howard, too, had grasped the association of fever with\r\novercrowding in the jails, while the possibility of the prevention of\r\nscurvy had been shown by Captain Cook and by Sir Gilbert Blaine.\r\n\r\nPreventive medicine was a blundering, incomplete science until\r\nbacteriology opened unheard-of possibilities for the prevention of\r\ndisease. Before discussing some of the victories of preventive medicine\r\nit will be well to take a brief survey of the growth of the following\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE OF BACTERIOLOGY\r\n\r\nFrom the brilliant overthrow by Pasteur, in 1861, and by Koch and Cohn,\r\nin 1876, of the theory of spontaneous generation, we may date its\r\nmodern growth. Wrapped up in this theory of spontaneous generation,\r\nupon which speculation raged centuries before the invention of the\r\nmicroscope, lies the history of bacteriology.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek and Roman philosophers wrestled with the question,\r\nand very interesting views of the relation of germ life to disease\r\nare preserved to us in their manuscripts. With the invention of the\r\nmicroscope we can mark the first positive step towards the goal of\r\nto-day. A Jesuit priest, Kircher, in 1671, was the first to investigate\r\nputrefying meat, milk, and cheese with the crude microscope of his\r\nday, and left us indefinite remarks concerning “very minute living\r\nworms” found therein. Four years after Kircher a Dutch linen merchant,\r\nAntonius von Leeuwenhoek, by improving the lenses of the microscope,\r\nsaw in rain-water, putrefying fluids, intestinal contents, and saliva,\r\nminute, moving, living particles, which he called “animalculæ.” In\r\nmedical circles of his day these observations aroused the keenest\r\ninterest, and the theory that these “animalculæ” might be the cause\r\nof all disease was eagerly discussed. Pleincz, of Vienna, after much\r\nobservation of various fluids, putrefying and otherwise, wrote in\r\n1762 that it was his firm belief that the phenomena of diseases and\r\nthe decomposition of animal fluids were wholly caused by these minute\r\nliving things.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such assertions, from his day on until Pasteur, Koch,\r\nand Cohn finally proved its misconceptions in 1876, the theory of\r\nspontaneous generation held the upper hand in all discussions upon the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus to research as to the causes of disease along the line\r\nof bacterial origin did not entirely cease to be felt, and the names\r\nof Pollender and Davaine are linked together in the first undoubted\r\ndiscovery of micro-organisms in disease, when the cause of anthrax, a\r\ndisease of cattle, was solved in 1863. Following closely upon Davaine’s\r\nresearches, the primary causes of wound infection were worked out, and\r\nto the efforts of the British surgeon Lister are due the great advances\r\nof modern surgery.\r\n\r\nIn rapid succession the presence of bacteria was clearly demonstrated\r\nin relapsing fever, leprosy, and typhoid fever; but far eclipsing all\r\nformer discoveries, on account of the magnitude of the difficulties\r\nencountered and overcome, were the brilliant demonstrations of the\r\ncause of consumption and allied diseases, and that of Asiatic cholera,\r\nby Dr. Robert Koch in 1882 and in 1884 respectively.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward innumerable workers have satisfied the critical\r\nscientific world as to the causes of pneumonia, diphtheria, tetanus,\r\ninfluenza, and bubonic plague, besides many diseases of cattle, horses,\r\nsheep, and other animals and insects.\r\n\r\nHaving glanced hastily at the history of bacteriology, we may next\r\nconsider some facts concerning the germs themselves. What are they? To\r\nthe lay mind the words germ, microbe, bacterium, and bacillus often\r\nconvey confused ideas of invisible, wriggling, worm-like creatures,\r\nenemies of mankind, ever on the watch to gain a stealthy entrance\r\ninto our bodies, where they wreak harm and death. Scientifically\r\nconsidered, however, they are the smallest of living things yet known.\r\nThey are not animals, but are members of the vegetable kingdom, and are\r\npossessed of definite yet varying shapes. They consist of a jelly-like\r\nsubstance called protoplasm, which is covered in and held in place by a\r\nwell-formed membrane of a relatively hard and dense character, exactly\r\nsimilar in composition to the woody fibre of trees.\r\n\r\nAccording to their shape the bacteria are divided into three chief\r\ngroups, called respectively cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. The cocci\r\nare spherical bodies and may exist singly or in pairs, in fours, in\r\nclusters, or in chains. In this group we find the smallest bacteria\r\nknown, many of them not over 1-150,000 of an inch in diameter. The\r\nbacilli are rod-like bodies, varying much in size in different species\r\nand in members of the same species. They are larger than the cocci,\r\nmeasuring in length from 1-25,000 of an inch to 1-4000, and in breadth\r\nfrom 1-125,000 to 1-16,000 of an inch. Many varieties are possessed of\r\norgans of locomotion called flagella.\r\n\r\nThe spirilla resemble the bacilli, except that they are twisted into\r\ncorkscrew shapes, or have gently undulating outlines. Upon an average\r\nthey are much longer than the bacilli, one species being very long,\r\nmeasuring about 1-600 of an inch. As seen in the natural state bacteria\r\nare found to be colorless, but it is by the application of various\r\naniline dyes that they are usually studied. These minute plants\r\nincrease by a simple method of division into two equal parts, or by\r\na more complex process of forming a seed—the so-called spore—which\r\nlater on develops into the adult form. Under favorable conditions they\r\nare able to multiply at an enormous rate; for instance, it has been\r\ncalculated that a bacillus dividing once every hour would at the end\r\nof twenty-four hours have increased to seventeen millions; and if the\r\ndivision continued at the same rate we should find at the end of the\r\nthird day an incalculable number of billions, whose weight would be\r\nnearly seven thousand five hundred tons!\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately for our welfare, nature by various means renders the\r\npossibility of such a happening entirely beyond the slightest chance of\r\nrealization, her greatest barrier being the lack of an adequate food\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe distribution in nature of bacteria is wellnigh universal,\r\noccurring as they do in the air we breathe, the water and milk we\r\ndrink, upon the exposed surfaces of man and animals, and in their\r\nintestinal tracts, and in the soil to a depth of about nine feet. But\r\nit has been noted that at very high altitudes and in glacier ice none\r\nexist, while in the Arctic regions and at sea far from land their\r\nnumbers are very few.\r\n\r\nThe conditions governing their growth involve many complex problems,\r\nbut a few of the chief factors concerned are moisture, air, food,\r\ntemperature, and light. All bacteria must have moisture, else they\r\ndie sooner or later, depending upon the hardness of the species, and\r\nnone can multiply without it. A supply of air is by no means essential\r\nto all germs. To some it is absolutely necessary, and such germs\r\nare called aerobes. To others air is wholly detrimental, and they\r\nconstitute the anaerobes, while to the majority of bacteria air supply\r\nis a matter of indifference, and in consequence they are grouped under\r\nthe term facultative anaerobes.\r\n\r\nThe food supply of many consists of dead animal and vegetable\r\nmaterials, a few require living tissues, while a small number can exist\r\nwholly upon mineral salts, or even the nitrogen of the air. The lowest\r\ntemperature at which some bacteria can multiply is the freezing-point\r\nof water, and the highest 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the average\r\nrange of temperature suitable to the majority lies between 60 and 104\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, 98 2-5 degrees Fahrenheit being the most suitable\r\nfor the growth of disease-producing germs. Light, ordinarily diffused\r\ndaylight, or its absence, is a matter of no moment to most germs,\r\nwhereas direct sunlight is a destroyer of all bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe study of the life histories of these diminutive plants excites the\r\nwonder of those who make observations upon them. It is truly marvellous\r\nto know that these bacteria can accomplish in their short lives of\r\npossibly a few hours or days feats which would baffle the cleverest of\r\nchemists if given years of a lifetime to work upon. They give to the\r\nfarmer the good quality of his crops, to the dairyman superior butter\r\nand cheese; they assist in large measure in freeing our rivers and\r\nlakes from harmful pollutions. Here it should be strongly emphasized\r\nthat those bacteria which cause disease are only of a few species, all\r\nothers contributing to our welfare in countless ways.\r\n\r\nQuite as astonishing is the discovery that within the root-knobs of\r\npease and beans live bacteria which by splitting up mineral salts\r\ncontaining nitrogen, and by absorbing nitrogen from the air, give it\r\nover to the plant so that it is enabled to grow luxuriantly, whereas,\r\nwithout their presence, the tiller of the soil might fertilize the\r\nground in vain. It is quite possible that not alone pease and beans,\r\nbut all grasses and plants and trees depend upon the presence of such\r\ngerms for their very existence, which in turn supply man and animals\r\nwith their means of existence. Hence we see that these nitrifying\r\nbacteria, as they are called, if swept out of existence, would be the\r\ncause of cessation of all life upon the globe. And arguing backward,\r\none prominent authority states it as his belief that the first of all\r\nlife on this earth were those lowly forms of plants which only required\r\nthe nitrogen of air or salts to enable them to multiply.\r\n\r\nLimiting observation now to the sphere of medicine, it will be readily\r\nperceived that the presence of bacterial life in a causative relation\r\nto disease is an object of paramount regard. The following paragraphs\r\nwill briefly treat of the diseases associated with micro-organisms and\r\nthe common modes of infection in each, the chain of events subsequent\r\nto an infection, and the possibilities of protection or cure by means\r\nof substances elaborated in the body of an individual or animal\r\nrecently recovered from an infectious disease:\r\n\r\n_Anthrax._—A disease chiefly of cattle and sheep, occasionally of\r\nman, is caused by the _Bacillus anthracis_, discovered in 1849–50 by\r\nPollender and Davaine. It enters the body through abrasions of the\r\nskin, by inhalation of the spores, or seeds, into the lungs, or by\r\nswallowing infected material.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—This disease is caused by a bacillus known as _Bacillus\r\nleprae_, which was discovered by Hansen in 1879. It is doubtful if it\r\nhas been grown outside the body. It is supposed to enter by abrasions\r\nof the skin, but it is very feebly contagious, notwithstanding popular\r\nideas as to its supposedly highly contagious nature.\r\n\r\n_Tuberculosis._—All forms of this disease, among which is ordinary\r\nconsumption, are caused by a bacillus closely resembling that of\r\nleprosy. It was discovered by Koch in 1880–82, and named _Bacillus\r\ntuberculosis_. The ways of infection are by inhaling the dried sputum\r\nof consumptives, drinking infected cow’s milk, or eating infected meat.\r\n\r\n_Typhoid Fever._—A disease of human beings only. Eberth in 1880\r\ndiscovered the germ causing it and called it _Bacillus typhosus_. It\r\ngains entrance to our bodies chiefly in the milk and water we drink,\r\nwhich comes from infected sources; a rarer method is by inhalation of\r\ninfected air.\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria._—A disease of human beings chiefly. It is caused by a\r\nbacillus which was described in 1883–84 by Klebs and Loeffler, and is\r\nknown as _Bacillus diphtheriae_, or Klebs-Loeffler bacillus. Its mode\r\nof entry is by inhaling infected air, or by drinking or eating infected\r\nmilk or food.\r\n\r\n_Cholera._—This disease is peculiar to human beings. Its native home\r\nis on the banks of the river Ganges in India, where Koch in 1884 was\r\nable to isolate its causative spirillum. Man is infected by drinking\r\ncontaminated water or by contact.\r\n\r\n_Lockjaw, or Tetanus._—Afflicts man, horses, and dogs. The _Bacillus\r\ntetani_ is the most deadly of all known bacteria. It enters the body by\r\nwounds. It was discovered in 1884 by Nicolaier.\r\n\r\n_Influenza, or the Grip._—Caused by one of the smallest-known bacilli;\r\ndiscovered in 1892 by Canon and Pfeiffer. Infection spreads by the\r\nscattering about by air-currents of the dried nasal and bronchial\r\nsecretion of those suffering from the disease, and its portal of entry\r\nis by the nose and bronchial tubes.\r\n\r\n_Pneumonia._—Caused by a coccus which grows in pairs and small chains.\r\nIt enters the body by means of the respiratory tract. It is present in\r\nthe saliva of twenty per cent. of healthy persons. Proved by Frankel in\r\n1886 to be the cause of this disease.\r\n\r\n_Bubonic Plague._—In 1894 Kitasato and Yersin isolated a small\r\nbacillus in a large number of cases and proved it to be the cause. It\r\nenters the body by means of wounds of the skin, and through bites of\r\nfleas from infected rats, which are said to be one of the chief factors\r\nin spreading this dread malady.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—The cause of this disease is still under discussion.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the infectious diseases which we can readily\r\nattribute to the presence of definite micro-organisms in respective\r\ncases. But strange as it may seem, the most typical of all infectious\r\ndiseases, small-pox, scarlet fever, measles, and hydrophobia, have as\r\nyet not yielded up their secrets. This is possibly due to the minute\r\nsize of the micro-organisms concerned, which make it beyond the power\r\nof the best microscope to demonstrate them. In this connection it has\r\nrecently been shown by Roux and Nocard that in the case of the disease\r\nknown as pleuro-pneumonia of cattle the causative agent is so very\r\nsmall as just to be barely visible. Again, it is quite possible that\r\nthese diseases may be caused by living things we know nothing about,\r\nwhich may be quite dissimilar from the bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTION—ITS PROCESSES AND RESULTS\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing list of diseases associated with specific bacteria,\r\nattention has been drawn to the common modes of infection, or, as they\r\nare technically called, “portals of entry,” and it now remains to touch\r\nupon the main factors, processes, and results following upon the entry\r\ninto the body of such disease-producing microbes.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the normal blood has of itself to a\r\nconsiderable extent the power of killing germs which may wander into\r\nit through various channels. Likewise the tissue cells of the body\r\nin general show similar action depending upon the different cell\r\ngroups, state of health, general robustness, and period of life. The\r\ngerm-killing power varies in different individuals, though each may be\r\nquite healthy. Considered as a whole, this power possessed by the body\r\nagainst germs is known as “general resistance.” And when by any means\r\nthis power of resistance is lost or diminished, we run grave risks of\r\nincurring disease.\r\n\r\nGranted a case of infection, let us now trace up briefly what occurs.\r\nBetween the period when the bacteria gain a lodgment and that in which\r\nthe disease assumes a noticeable form, the patient simply feels out of\r\nsorts. It is during this stage that the blood and tissues are deeply\r\nengaged in the attempt to repel the attacks of the invading microbes.\r\n\r\nWith varying speed the germs multiply throughout the body generally,\r\nor may be at first localized, or even, as in lockjaw, remain localized\r\nthroughout the entire disease. Multiplying in the tissues, they\r\ngenerate in increasing amounts their noxious poisons, which soon cause\r\nprofound changes throughout the body; the patient becomes decidedly\r\nill, and shows now the signs of an unmistakable infection.\r\n\r\nDoes the body now give up the fight entirely? No; on the contrary, the\r\nwhite blood-cells, the wandering cells, and the cells of the tissues\r\nmost affected still carry on an unequal fight. From the lymphatic\r\nglands and spleen, armies of white cells rush to the fray and attempt\r\nto eat up and destroy the foe, but possibly in vain; the disease runs\r\nits course, to end either in death or recovery.\r\n\r\nHow, then, in cases of recovery, are the microbes finally overcome?\r\n\r\nThis question involves many complex processes which at present are by\r\nno means thoroughly understood, but we will concern ourselves with the\r\nsimple principles.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously mentioned that once the bacteria get a good\r\nfoothold the body is subjected to the action of generated poisons,\r\nwhich are known as toxins. They give rise to such symptoms as loss of\r\nappetite, headache, fever, pains and aches, and even a state of stupor\r\nor unconsciousness. In addition to the active warfare of the white\r\nblood-cells, groups of cells throughout the body, after recovering from\r\nthe first rude shock of the toxins, begin to tolerate their presence,\r\nthen effect a change in the chemical constitution of the toxins, and\r\nfinally elaborate substances which antagonize the toxins and destroy\r\ntheir action altogether, thus lending aid to the warrior cells, which\r\nat last overcome the invading microbes. Recovery is brought about, and\r\na more or less permanent degree of immunity against the special form of\r\ndisease ensues.\r\n\r\nNow if we could use these antagonizing substances, or, as they are\r\ncalled, antitoxins, upon other men or animals sick with a similar\r\ndisease, would their bodies be at once strengthened to resist and\r\nfinally overcome the disease? Yes, in a certain majority of cases they\r\nwould, and this is exactly what scientific observers have noted,\r\nworked out, and have successfully applied. A new art in the healing of\r\ndisease, which is spoken of broadly as serum-therapy, or medication by\r\ncurative or protective serums, has thus been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe first observers in this new field were Pasteur and Raynaud in\r\nFrance in 1877–78, and Salmon and Smith in this country in 1886.\r\nRaynaud, by injecting serum from a calf which had had an attack of\r\ncow-pox, prevented the appearance of the disease in a calf freshly\r\ninoculated with the virulent material of the disease. Pasteur, by using\r\nfeebly infective germs of fowl cholera, conferred immunity upon healthy\r\nfowls against the disease, and was able to cure those which were ill.\r\nSalmon and Smith injected small and repeated amounts of the elaborated\r\ntoxins or poisons of the bacillus of hog cholera into healthy swine,\r\nand were able to confer immunity upon them.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not until Behring in 1892 announced his discovery of\r\nan antitoxin serum for diphtheria, along with an undisputed proof of\r\nits value in treatment, that the attention of the scientific world\r\nwas finally aroused and stimulated to the appreciation of the great\r\npossibilities of serum-therapy.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, much opposition arose to this new method of\r\ntreatment, not alone from the lay portions of the community, but even\r\nfrom the ranks of the medical profession itself. This opposition was\r\ndue in part to misconceptions of the principles involved in the new\r\ndoctrine, and in part to the falsely philanthropic prejudices of the\r\npseudo-scientific sections of both parties. But by the persevering work\r\nof the enthusiastic believers in serum-therapy, positive conviction has\r\nnow replaced misconception and prejudice in the minds of the majority\r\nof its former opponents.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of statistical evidence, even where all allowance is\r\nmade for doubtful methods of compilation, shows that the aggregate\r\nmortality of diphtheria has been reduced fully fifty per cent. since\r\nthe introduction of antitoxic treatment by Behring in 1892.\r\n\r\nSince the method of preparation of the commercial diphtheria antitoxin\r\nillustrates the general principles involved in the search for the\r\nproduction of curative or protective serums for infectious diseases in\r\ngeneral, a summary of the steps in its manufacture will now be given.\r\n\r\nA race of diphtheria bacilli, which has been found to yield a poison of\r\ngreat virulence in alkaline beef broth, is grown for a week or ten days\r\nin this medium. The toxin is then separated and its virulence exactly\r\ndetermined. It is preserved in sterile receptacles for immediate or\r\nfuture use. The next step is the inoculation of a suitable animal with\r\nthe toxin. Of all animals the horse has been found to meet nearly every\r\nrequirement. Such an animal, in a state of perfect health, receives\r\nan injection of twenty cubic centimetres of toxin, along with ten\r\nor fifteen of standard antitoxin, beneath the skin of the neck or\r\nfore-quarters, upon three separate occasions at intervals of five days.\r\nAfter this it receives increasing doses of toxin, alone, at intervals\r\nof six to eight days, until, at the end of two months, it is able to\r\nstand with little discomfort doses of such strength that if given in\r\nthe first stage these doses would have quickly caused death.\r\n\r\nAt this period the horse is bled to a small extent, and its serum\r\ntested to ascertain if prospects are good for the production by the\r\nanimal of a high grade of antitoxin. If satisfactory progress has been\r\nmade, the injections are continued for another month, when, as a rule,\r\nthe maximal degree of antitoxic power in the serum will have been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThe horse is now bled to the proper extent, the blood being received\r\nin a sterile jar and placed in an ice-box. Here it coagulates, and\r\nthe serum separates from it. When the separation of clot and serum\r\nis complete, the latter is drawn off, taken to the laboratory, and\r\nstandardized. This being finished, an antiseptic fluid is added to\r\npreserve the serum from decomposition. It is then bottled, labelled,\r\nand sent out for use.\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion tetanus antitoxin is prepared; and quite recently\r\nCalmette has produced an antitoxic serum for use in snake bite, by\r\ninjecting horses with minute increasing doses of snake venom. His\r\nexperiments have given some remarkable results, not only in laboratory\r\nwork, but also in cases of actual snake bite occurring in man. Thus\r\nbacteriological scientists, after years of laborious work, in the face\r\nof much criticism and severe denunciation, may confidently announce\r\nthat they have in their possession a magic key to one of nature’s\r\nsecret doors. The lock has been turned. The door stands partly open,\r\nand we are permitted a glimpse of the future possibilities to be\r\nattained in the great fight against disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE MEDICINE\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the diseases which have been remarkably\r\ncontrolled through preventive medicine:\r\n\r\n_Small-pox._—While not a scourge of the first rank, like the plague\r\nor cholera, at the outset of the century variola was one of the\r\nmost prevalent and dreaded of all diseases. Few reached adult life\r\nwithout an attack. To-day, though outbreaks still occur, it is a\r\ndisease thoroughly controlled by vaccination. The protective power\r\nof the inoculated cow-pox is not a fixed and constant quantity.\r\nThe protection may be for life, or it may last only for a year or\r\ntwo. The all-important fact is this: That efficiently vaccinated\r\npersons may be exposed with impunity, and among large bodies of\r\nmen (_e.g._, the German army), in which revaccination is practised,\r\nsmall-pox is unknown. Of one hundred vaccinated persons exposed to\r\nsmall-pox, possibly one might take the disease in a mild form; of one\r\nhundred unvaccinated persons so exposed, one alone might escape—from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty would die. To be efficient, vaccination must be\r\ncarried out systematically, and if all the inhabitants of this country\r\nwere revaccinated at intervals small-pox would disappear (as it has\r\nfrom the German army), and the necessity for vaccination would cease.\r\nThe difficulty arises from the constant presence of an unvaccinated\r\nremnant, by which the disease is kept alive. The Montreal experience in\r\n1885 is an object-lesson never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nFor eight or ten years vaccination had been neglected, particularly\r\namong the French-Canadians. On February 28, 1885, a Pullman car\r\nconductor, who came from Chicago, where the disease had been slightly\r\nprevalent, was admitted into the Hôtel Dieu. Isolation was not carried\r\nout, and on the 1st of April a servant in the hospital died of\r\nsmall-pox. Following her death the authorities of the hospital sent to\r\ntheir homes all patients who presented no symptoms of the disease. Like\r\nfire in dry grass the contagion spread, and within nine months there\r\ndied of small-pox three thousand one hundred and sixty-four persons.\r\nIt ruined the trade of the city for the winter, and cost millions of\r\ndollars. There are no reasonable objections to vaccination, which is\r\na simple process, by which a mild and harmless disease is introduced.\r\nThe use of the animal vaccine does away with the possibility of\r\nintroduction of other disorders, such as syphilis.\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._—Until the middle of the present century this disease\r\nprevailed widely in most of the large cities, particularly in Europe,\r\nand also in jails, ships, hospitals, and camps. It was more widely\r\nspread than typhoid fever and much more fatal. Murchison remarks of\r\nit that a complete history of its ravages would be the history of\r\nEurope during the past three centuries and a half. Not one of the acute\r\ninfections seems to have been more dependent upon filth and unsanitary\r\nconditions. With the gradual introduction of drainage and a good water\r\nsupply, and the relief of overcrowding, the disease has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, and is rarely mentioned now in the bills of mortality,\r\nexcept in a few of the larger and more unsanitary cities. The following\r\nfigures illustrate what has been done in England within sixty years:\r\nIn 1838 in England twelve hundred and twenty-eight persons died of\r\nfever (typhus and typhoid) per million of living. Twenty years later\r\nthe figures were reduced to nine hundred and eighteen; in 1878 to three\r\nhundred and six of typhoid and to thirty-six of typhus fever. In 1892\r\nonly one hundred and thirty-seven died of typhoid fever and only three\r\nof typhus per million living!\r\n\r\n_Typhoid Fever._—While preventive medicine can claim a great victory\r\nin this disease also, it is less brilliant, since the conditions which\r\nfavor its prevalence are not those specially relating to overcrowding\r\nas much as to imperfect water supply and the contamination of certain\r\nessential foods, as milk. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that,\r\nwith a pure water supply and perfect drainage, typhoid fever almost\r\ndisappears from a city. In Vienna, after the introduction of good\r\nwater, the rate of mortality from typhoid fever fell from twelve per\r\nten thousand of the inhabitants to about one. In Munich the fall\r\nwas still more remarkable; from above twenty-nine per ten thousand\r\ninhabitants in 1857 it fell to about one per ten thousand in 1887.\r\nThat typhoid fever in this country is still a very prevalent disease\r\ndepends mainly upon two facts: First, not only is the typhoid bacillus\r\nvery resistant, but it may remain for a long time in the body of\r\na person after recovery from typhoid fever, and such persons, in\r\napparent good health, may be a source of contamination. With many of\r\nthe conditions favoring the persistence and growth of the bacillus\r\noutside the body we are not yet familiar. The experience in the\r\nSpanish-American War illustrates how dangerous is the concentration\r\ntogether of large numbers of individuals. But, second, the essential\r\nfactor in the widespread prevalence of typhoid fever in the United\r\nStates, particularly in country districts, is the absence of anything\r\nlike efficient rural sanitation. Many counties have yet to learn the\r\nalphabet of sanitation. The chief danger results from the impure\r\nwater supplies of the smaller towns, the local house epidemics due to\r\ninfected wells, and the milk outbreaks due to the infection of dairy\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nThe importance of scrupulously guarding the sources of supply was never\r\nbetter illustrated than in the well-known and oft-quoted epidemic in\r\nPlymouth, Pennsylvania. The town, with a population of eight thousand,\r\nwas in part supplied with drinking-water from a reservoir fed by a\r\nmountain-stream. During January, February, and March, in a cottage by\r\nthe side of and at a distance of from sixty to eighty feet from this\r\nstream, a man was ill with typhoid fever. The attendants were in the\r\nhabit at night of throwing out the evacuations on the ground towards\r\nthe stream. During these months the ground was frozen and covered\r\nwith snow. In the latter part of March and early in April there was\r\nconsiderable rainfall and a thaw, in which a large part of the three\r\nmonths’ accumulation of discharges was washed into the brook not sixty\r\nfeet distant. At the very time of this thaw the patient had numerous\r\nand copious discharges. About the 10th of April cases of typhoid fever\r\nbroke out in the town, appearing for a time at the rate of fifty a day.\r\nIn all about twelve hundred were attacked. An immense majority of\r\nthe cases were in the part of the town which received water from the\r\ninfected reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe use of boiled water and of ice made from distilled water, the\r\nsystematic inspection of dairies, the scrupulous supervision of the\r\nsources from which the water is obtained, an efficient system of\r\nsewage removal, and, above all, the most scrupulous care on the part\r\nof physicians and of nurses in the disinfection of the discharges of\r\ntyphoid fever patients—these are the factors necessary to reduce to a\r\nminimum the incidence of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n_Cholera._—One of the great scourges of the present century made\r\ninroads into Europe and America from India, its native home. We have,\r\nhowever, found out the germ, found out the conditions under which it\r\nlives, and it is not likely that it will ever again gain a foothold\r\nin this country or Great Britain. Since the last epidemic, 1873, the\r\ndisease, though brought to this country on several occasions, has\r\nalways been held in check at the port of entry. It is communicated\r\nalmost entirely through infected water, and the virulence of an\r\nepidemic in any city is in direct proportion to the imperfection of\r\nthe water supply. This was shown in a remarkable way in the Hamburg\r\nepidemic of 1892. In Altona, which had a filtration plant, there\r\nwere only five hundred and sixteen cases, many of them refugees from\r\nHamburg. Hamburg, where the unfiltered water of the Elbe was used, had\r\nsome eighteen thousand cases, with nearly eight thousand deaths.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—The cause of this disease is still under discussion.\r\nIt has an interest to us in this country from its continued prevalence\r\nin Cuba, and from the fact that at intervals it makes inroads into\r\nthe Southern States, causing serious commercial loss. The history of\r\nthe disease in the other West India islands, particularly Jamaica,\r\nindicates the steps which must be taken for its prevention. Formerly\r\nyellow fever was as fatal a scourge in them as it is to-day in Cuba. By\r\nan efficient system of sanitation it has been abolished. The same can\r\nbe done (and will be done) in Cuba within a few years. General Wood has\r\nalready pointed out the way in the cleansing of Santiago.\r\n\r\n_The Plague._—One of the most remarkable facts in connection with\r\nmodern epidemics has been the revival of the bubonic plague, the most\r\ndreaded of all the great infections. During the present century the\r\ndisease in Europe has been confined almost exclusively to Turkey and\r\nSouthern Europe. Since 1894, when it appeared at Hong-Kong, it has\r\ngradually spread, and there have been outbreaks of terrible severity\r\nin India. It has extended to certain of the Mediterranean ports, and\r\nduring the past summer it reached Glasgow, where there has been a\r\nsmall outbreak. On this hemisphere there have been small outbreaks in\r\ncertain of the South American ports, cases have been brought to New\r\nYork, and there have been to November 1st twenty-one cases among the\r\nChinese in San Francisco. Judging from the readiness with which it has\r\nbeen checked and limited in Australia, and in particular the facility\r\nwith which the recent outbreak in Glasgow has been stamped out, there\r\nis very little risk that plague will ever assume the proportions which\r\ngave to it its terrible reputation as the “black death” of the Middle\r\nAges. As I have already mentioned, the germ is known, and prophylactic\r\ninoculations have been made on a large scale in India, with a certain\r\nmeasure of success.\r\n\r\n_Tuberculosis._—In all communities the _white plague_, as Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes calls it, takes the first rank as a killing disease. It\r\nhas been estimated that of it one hundred and twenty thousand people\r\ndie yearly in this country. In all mortality bills tuberculosis of\r\nthe lungs, or consumption, heads the list, and when to this is added\r\ntuberculosis of the other organs, the number swells to such an extent\r\nthat this disease equals in fatality all the other acute infective\r\ndiseases combined, if we leave out pneumonia. Less than twenty years\r\nago we knew little or nothing of the cause of the disease. It was\r\nbelieved to be largely hereditary. Koch discovered the germ, and with\r\nthis have come the possibilities of limiting its ravages.\r\n\r\nThe following points with reference to it may be stated: In a few very\r\nrare instances the disease is transmitted from parent to child. In a\r\nlarge proportion of all cases the disease is “caught.” The germs are\r\nwidely distributed through the sputum, which, when dry, becomes dust,\r\nand is blown about in all directions. Tubercle bacilli have been found\r\nin the dust of streets, houses, hospital wards, and much-frequented\r\nplaces. A single individual may discharge from the lungs countless\r\nmyriads of germs in the twenty-four hours. Dr. Nuttall estimated from a\r\npatient in the Johns Hopkins Hospital, who had only moderately advanced\r\nconsumption, that from one and a half to four and a third billions of\r\ngerms were thrown off in the twenty-four hours. The consumptive, as has\r\nbeen well stated, is almost harmless, and only becomes harmful through\r\nbad habits. The germs are contained in the sputum, which, when dry,\r\nis widely scattered in the form of dust, and constitutes the great\r\nmedium for the transmission of the disease. If expectorated into a\r\nhandkerchief, the sputum dries quickly, particularly if it is put into\r\nthe pocket or under the pillow. The beard or mustache of a consumptive\r\nis smeared with the germs. Even in the most careful the hands are apt\r\nto be soiled with the germs, and in those who are dirty and careless\r\nthe furniture and materials which they handle readily become infected.\r\nWhere the dirty habit prevails of spitting on the floor, a room, or the\r\nentire house, may contain numbers of germs. In the majority of all\r\ncases the infection in tuberculosis is by inhalation. This is shown\r\nby the frequency with which the disease is met in the lungs, and the\r\ngreat prevalence of tuberculosis in institutions in which the residents\r\nare restricted in the matter of fresh air and a free, open life. The\r\ndisease prevails specially in cloisters, in jails, and in asylums.\r\nInfection through milk is also possible; it is doubtful whether the\r\ndisease is transmitted through meat. So widespread are the germs that\r\npost-mortem examination has shown that a very large number of persons\r\nshow slight signs of the disease who have never during life presented\r\nany symptoms; in fact, some recent investigations would indicate that a\r\nvery large proportion of all persons at the age of forty have somewhere\r\nin their bodies slight tuberculous lesions. This shows the importance\r\nof the individual predisposition, upon which the older writers laid so\r\nmuch stress, and the importance of maintaining the nutrition at its\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of modern protective medicine is\r\nthe widespread interest that has been aroused in the crusade against\r\ntuberculosis. What has already been accomplished warrants the belief\r\nthat the hopes of even the most enthusiastic may be realized. A\r\npositive decline in the prevalence of the disease has been shown in\r\nmany of the larger cities during the past ten years. In Massachusetts,\r\nwhich has been a hot-bed of tuberculosis for many years, the death-rate\r\nhas fallen from forty-two per ten thousand inhabitants in 1853 to\r\ntwenty-one and eight-tenths per ten thousand inhabitants in 1895. In\r\nthe city of Glasgow, in which the records have been very carefully\r\nkept, there has been an extraordinary fall in the death-rate from\r\ntuberculosis, and the recent statistics of New York City show, too, a\r\nsimilar remarkable diminution.\r\n\r\nIn fighting the disease our chief weapons are: First, education of the\r\npublic, particularly of the poorer classes, who do not fully appreciate\r\nthe chief danger in the disease. Secondly, the compulsory notification\r\nand registration of all cases of tuberculosis. The importance of this\r\nrelates chiefly to the very poor and improvident, from whom, after\r\nall, comes the greatest danger, and who should be under constant\r\nsurveillance in order that these dangers may be reduced to a minimum.\r\nThirdly, the foundation in suitable localities by the city and by the\r\nState of sanatoria for the treatment of early cases of the disease.\r\nFourthly, provision for the chronic, incurable cases in special\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria._—Since the discovery of the germ of this disease\r\nand our knowledge of the conditions of its transmission, and the\r\ndiscovery of the antitoxin, there has been a great reduction in its\r\nprevalence and an equally remarkable reduction in the mortality. The\r\nmore careful isolation of the sick, the thorough disinfection of the\r\nclothing, the rigid scrutiny of the milder cases of throat disorder,\r\na more stringent surveillance in the period of convalescence, and the\r\nroutine examination of the throats of school-children—these are the\r\nessential measures by which the prevalence of the disease has been very\r\nmarkedly diminished. The great danger is in the mild cases, in which\r\nthe disease has perhaps not been suspected, and in which the child may\r\nbe walking about and even going to school. Such patients are often a\r\nsource of widespread infection. The careful attention given by mothers\r\nto the teeth and mouth of children is also an important factor. In\r\nchildren with recurring attacks of tonsillitis, in whom the tonsils\r\nare enlarged, the organs should be removed. Through these measures the\r\nincidence of the disease has been very greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n_Pneumonia._—While there has been a remarkable diminution in the\r\nprevalence of a large number of all the acute infections, one disease\r\nnot only holds its own, but seems even to have increased in its\r\nvirulence. In the mortality bills, pneumonia is an easy second to\r\ntuberculosis. It attacks particularly the intemperate, the feeble,\r\nand the old, though every year a large number of robust, healthy\r\nindividuals succumb. So frequent is pneumonia at advanced periods of\r\nlife that to die of it has been said to be the natural end of old men\r\nin this country. In many ways, too, it is a satisfactory disease, if\r\none may use such an expression. It is not associated with much pain,\r\nexcept at the onset, the battle is brief and short, and a great many\r\nold persons succumb to it easily and peacefully.\r\n\r\nWe know the cause of the disease; we know only too well its symptoms,\r\nbut the enormous fatality (from twenty to twenty-five per cent.) speaks\r\nonly too plainly of the futility of our means of cure, and yet in no\r\ndisease has there been so great a revolution in treatment. The patient\r\nis no longer drenched to death with drugs, or bled to a point where\r\nthe resisting powers of nature are exhausted. We are not without hope,\r\ntoo, that in the future an antidote may be found to the toxins of the\r\ndisease, and of late there have been introduced several measures of\r\ngreat value in supporting the weakness of the heart, a special danger\r\nin the old and debilitated.\r\n\r\n_Hydrophobia._—Rabies, a remarkable, and in certain countries a\r\nwidespread, disease of animals, when transmitted to a man by the bite\r\nof rabid dogs, wolves, etc., is known as hydrophobia. The specific\r\ngerm is unknown, but by a series of brilliant observations Pasteur\r\nshowed (1) that the poison has certain fixed and peculiar properties in\r\nconnection with the nervous system; (2) that susceptible animals could\r\nbe rendered refractory to the disease, or incapable of taking it, by a\r\ncertain method of inoculation; and (3) that an animal unprotected and\r\ninoculated with a dose of the virus sufficient to cause the disease\r\nmay, by the injection of proper anti-rabic treatment, escape. Supported\r\nby these facts, Pasteur began a system of treatment of hydrophobia in\r\nman, and a special institute was founded in Paris for the purpose. When\r\ncarried out promptly the treatment is successful in an immense majority\r\nof all cases, and the mortality in persons bitten by animals proved to\r\nbe rabid, who have subsequently had the anti-rabic treatment, has been\r\nreduced to less than one-half per cent. The disease may be stamped out\r\nin dogs by careful quarantine of suspected animals, and by a thoroughly\r\ncarried out muzzling order.\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—Among the most remarkable of modern discoveries is the\r\ncause of malarial fever, one of the great maladies of the world, and\r\na prime obstacle to the settlement of Europeans in tropical regions.\r\nUntil 1880 the cause was quite obscure. It was known that the disease\r\nprevailed chiefly in marshy districts, in the autumn, and that the\r\ndanger of infection was greatest in the evening and at night, and\r\nthat it was not directly contagious. In 1880 a French army surgeon,\r\nLaveran, discovered in the red blood-corpuscles small bodies which have\r\nproved to be the specific germ of the disease. They are not bacteria,\r\nbut little animal bodies resembling the amœba—tiny little portions\r\nof protoplasm. The parasite in its earliest form is a small, clear,\r\nring-shaped body inside the red blood-corpuscle, upon which it feeds,\r\ngradually increasing in size and forming within itself blackish grains\r\nout of the coloring matter of the corpuscle. When the little parasite\r\nreaches a certain size it begins to divide or multiply, and an enormous\r\nnumber of these breaking up at the same time give off poison in the\r\nblood, which causes the paroxysms of fever. During what is known as\r\nthe chill, in the intermittent fever, for example, one can always find\r\nthese dividing parasites. Several different forms of the parasites\r\nhave been found, corresponding to different varieties of malaria.\r\nParasites of a very similar nature exist abundantly in birds. Ross,\r\nan army surgeon in India, found that the spread of this parasite from\r\nbird to bird was effected through the intervention of the mosquito. The\r\nparasites reach maturity in certain cells of the coats of the stomach\r\nof these insects, and develop into peculiar thread-like bodies, many of\r\nwhich ultimately reach the salivary glands, from which, as the insect\r\nbites, they pass with the secretion of the glands into the wound. From\r\nthis as a basis, numerous observers have worked out the relation of the\r\nmosquito to malaria in the human subject.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the disease is transmitted chiefly by certain varieties\r\nof the mosquito, particularly the _Anopheles_. The ordinary _Culex_,\r\nwhich is present chiefly in the Northern States, does not convey\r\nthe disease. The _Anopheles_ sucks the blood from a person infected\r\nwith malaria, takes in a certain number of parasites, which undergo\r\ndevelopment in the body of the insect, the final outcome of which is\r\nnumerous small, thread-like structures, which are found in numbers in\r\nthe salivary glands. From this point, when the mosquito bites another\r\nindividual, they pass into his blood, infect the system, and in this\r\nway the disease is transmitted. Two very striking experiments may be\r\nmentioned. The Italian observers have repeatedly shown that _Anopheles_\r\nwhich have sucked blood from patients suffering from malaria, when sent\r\nto a non-malarial region, and there allowed to bite perfectly healthy\r\npersons, have transmitted the disease. But a very crucial experiment\r\nwas made a short time ago. Mosquitoes which had bitten malarial\r\npatients in Italy were sent to London and there allowed to bite Mr.\r\nManson, son of Dr. Manson, who really suggested the mosquito theory of\r\nmalaria. This gentleman had not lived out of England, and there is no\r\nacute malaria in London. He had been a perfectly healthy, strong man.\r\nIn a few days following the bites of the infected mosquitoes he had a\r\ntypical attack of malarial fever.\r\n\r\nThe other experiment, though of a different character, is quite as\r\nconvincing. In certain regions about Rome, in the Campania, malaria is\r\nso prevalent that in the autumn almost every one in the district is\r\nattacked, particularly if he is a new-comer. Dr. Sambron and a friend\r\nlived in this district from the 1st of June to the 1st of September,\r\n1900. The test was whether they could live in this exceedingly\r\ndangerous climate for the three months without catching malaria, if\r\nthey used stringent precautions against the bites of mosquitoes. For\r\nthis purpose the hut in which they lived was thoroughly wired, and they\r\nslept with the greatest care under netting. Both of these gentlemen at\r\nthe end of the period had escaped the disease.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these studies cannot be overestimated. They explain\r\nthe relation of malaria to marshy districts, the seasonal incidence of\r\nthe disease, the nocturnal infection, and many other hitherto obscure\r\nproblems. More important still, they point out clearly the way by which\r\nmalaria may be prevented: First, the recognition that any individual\r\nwith malaria is a source of danger in a community, so that he must\r\nbe thoroughly treated with quinine; secondly, the importance of the\r\ndraining of marshy districts and ponds in which mosquitoes breed; and,\r\nthirdly, that even in the most infected regions persons may escape the\r\ndisease by living in thoroughly protected houses, in this way escaping\r\nthe bites of mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n_Venereal Diseases._—These continue to embarrass the social economist\r\nand to perplex and distress the profession. The misery and ill-health\r\nwhich they cause are incalculable, and the pity of it is that the cross\r\nis not always borne by the offender, but innocent women and children\r\nshare the penalties. The gonorrhœal infection, so common, and often so\r\nlittle heeded, is a cause of much disease in parts other than those\r\nfirst affected. Syphilis claims its victims in every rank of life, at\r\nevery age, and in all countries. We now treat it more thoroughly, but\r\nall attempts to check its ravages have been fruitless. Physicians have\r\ntwo important duties: the incessant preaching of continence to young\r\nmen, and scrupulous care, in every case, that the disease may not be\r\na source of infection to others, and that by thorough treatment the\r\npatient may be saved from the serious late nervous manifestations.\r\nWe can also urge that in the interests of public health venereal\r\ndiseases, like other infections, shall be subject to supervision by\r\nthe State. The opposition to measures tending to the restriction of\r\nthese diseases is most natural: on the one hand, from women, who feel\r\nthat it is an aggravation of a shocking injustice and wrong to their\r\nsex; on the other, from those who feel the moral guilt in a legal\r\nrecognition of the evil. It is appalling to contemplate the frightful\r\ntrain of miseries which a single diseased woman may entail, not alone\r\non her associates, but on scores of the innocent—whose bitter cry\r\nshould make the opponents of legislation feel that any measures of\r\nrestriction, any measures of registration, would be preferable to the\r\npresent disgraceful condition, which makes of some Christian cities\r\nopen brothels and allows the purest homes to be invaded by the most\r\nloathsome of all diseases.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—Since the discovery of the germ of this terrible disease\r\nsystematic efforts have been made to improve the state of its victims\r\nand to promote the study of the conditions under which the disease\r\nprevails. The English Leprosy Commission has done good work in calling\r\nattention to the widespread prevalence of the disease in India and\r\nin the East. In this country leprosy has been introduced into San\r\nFrancisco by the Chinese, and into the Northwestern States by the\r\nNorwegians, and there are foci of the disease in the Southern States,\r\nparticularly Louisiana, and in the province of New Brunswick. The\r\nproblem has an additional interest since the annexation of Hawaii\r\nand the Philippine Islands, in both of which places leprosy prevails\r\nextensively. By systematic measures of inspection and the segregation\r\nof affected individuals the disease can readily be held in check. It is\r\nnot likely ever to increase among native Americans, or again gain such\r\na foothold as it had in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n_Puerperal Fever._—Perhaps one of the most striking of all victories\r\nof preventive medicine has been the almost total abolition of so-called\r\nchild-bed fever from the maternity hospitals and from private practice.\r\nIn many institutions the mortality after child-birth was five or six\r\nper cent., indeed sometimes as high as ten per cent., whereas to-day,\r\nowing entirely to proper antiseptic precautions, the mortality has\r\nfallen to three-tenths to four-tenths per cent. The recognition of the\r\ncontagiousness of puerperal fever was the most valuable contribution to\r\nmedical science made by Oliver Wendell Holmes. There had been previous\r\nsuggestions by several writers, but his essay on the “Contagiousness\r\nof Puerperal Fever,” published in 1843, was the first strong, clear,\r\nlogical statement of the case. Semmelweis, a few years later, added\r\nthe weight of a large practical experience to the side of the\r\ncontagiousness, but the full recognition of the causes of the disease\r\nwas not reached until the recent antiseptic views had been put into\r\npractical effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DISPENSATION IN TREATMENT\r\n\r\nThe century has witnessed a revolution in the treatment of disease,\r\nand the growth of a new school of medicine. The old schools—regular\r\nand homœopathic—put their trust in drugs, to give which was the\r\nalpha and the omega of their practice. For every symptom there were\r\na score or more of medicines—vile, nauseous compounds in one case;\r\nbland, harmless dilutions in the other. The new school has a firm faith\r\nin a few good, well-tried drugs, little or none in the great mass of\r\nmedicines still in general use. Imperative drugging—the ordering\r\nof medicine in any and every malady—is no longer regarded as the\r\nchief function of the doctor. Naturally, when the entire conception\r\nof the disease was changed, there came a corresponding change in our\r\ntherapeutics. In no respect is this more strikingly shown than in our\r\npresent treatment of fever—say, of the common typhoid fever. During\r\nthe first quarter of the century the patients were bled, blistered,\r\npurged and vomited, and dosed with mercury, antimony, and other\r\ncompounds to meet special symptoms. During the second quarter, the\r\nsame, with variations in different countries. After 1850 bleeding\r\nbecame less frequent, and the experiments of the Paris and Vienna\r\nschools began to shake the belief in the control of fever by drugs.\r\nDuring the last quarter sensible doctors have reached the conclusion\r\nthat typhoid fever is not a disease to be treated with medicines, but\r\nthat in a large proportion of all cases diet, nursing, and bathing\r\nmeet the indications. There is active, systematic, careful, watchful\r\ntreatment, but not with drugs. The public has not yet been fully\r\neducated to this point, and medicines have sometimes to be ordered for\r\nthe sake of the friends, and it must be confessed that there are still\r\nin the ranks _antiques_ who would insist on a dose of some kind every\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\nThe battle against poly-pharmacy, or the use of a large number of drugs\r\n(of the action of which we know little, yet we put them into bodies of\r\nthe action of which we know less), has not been fought to a finish.\r\nThere have been two contributing factors on the side of progress—the\r\nremarkable growth of the skeptical spirit fostered by Paris, Vienna,\r\nand Boston physicians, and, above all, the valuable lesson of\r\nhomœopathy, the infinitesimals of which certainly could not do harm, and\r\nquite as certainly could not do good; yet nobody has ever claimed that\r\nthe mortality among homœopathic practitioners was greater than among\r\nthose of the regular school. A new school of practitioners has arisen\r\nwhich cares nothing for homœopathy and less for so-called allopathy.\r\nIt seeks to study, rationally and scientifically, the action of drugs,\r\nold and new. It is more concerned that a physician shall know how to\r\napply the few great medicines which all have to use, such as quinine,\r\niron, mercury, iodide of potassium, opium, and digitalis, rather than a\r\nmultiplicity of remedies the action of which is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe growth of scientific pharmacology, by which we now have many\r\nactive principles instead of crude drugs, and the discovery of the art\r\nof making medicines palatable, have been of enormous aid in rational\r\npractice. There is no limit to the possibility of help from the\r\nscientific investigation of the properties and action of drugs. At any\r\nday the new chemistry may give to us remedies of extraordinary potency\r\nand of as much usefulness as cocaine. There is no reason why we should\r\nnot even in the vegetable world find for certain diseases specifics of\r\nvirtue fully equal to that of quinine in the malarial fevers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking characteristics of the modern treatment\r\nof disease is the return to what used to be called the natural\r\nmethods—diet, exercise, bathing, and massage. There probably never\r\nhas been a period in the history of the profession when the value\r\nof _diet_ in the prevention and the cure of disease was more fully\r\nrecognized. Dyspepsia, the besetting malady of this country, is largely\r\ndue to improper diet, imperfectly prepared and too hastily eaten. One\r\nof the great lessons to be learned is that the preservation of health\r\ndepends in great part upon food well cooked and carefully eaten. A\r\ncommon cause of ruined digestion, particularly in young girls, is the\r\neating of sweets between meals and the drinking of the abominations\r\ndispensed in the chemists’ shops in the form of ice-cream sodas, etc.\r\nAnother frequent cause of ruined digestion in business men is the\r\nhurried meal at the lunch-counter. And a third factor, most important\r\nof all, illustrates the old maxim, that more people are killed by over\r\neating and drinking than by the sword. Sensible people have begun to\r\nrealize that alcoholic excesses lead inevitably to impaired health. A\r\nman may take four or five drinks of whiskey a day, or even more, and\r\nthinks perhaps that he transacts his business better with that amount\r\nof stimulant; but it only too frequently happens that early in the\r\nfifth decade, just as business or political success is assured, Bacchus\r\nhands in heavy bills for payment, in the form of serious disease of the\r\narteries or of the liver, or there is a general breakdown. With the\r\nintroduction of light beer there has been not only less intemperance,\r\nbut a reduction in the number of the cases of organic disease of the\r\nheart, liver, and stomach caused by alcohol. While temperance in\r\nthe matter of alcoholic drinks is becoming a characteristic feature\r\nof Americans, intemperance in the quantity of food taken is almost\r\nthe rule. Adults eat far too much, and physicians are beginning to\r\nrecognize that the early degenerations, particularly of the arteries\r\nand of the kidneys, leading to Bright’s disease, which were formerly\r\nattributed to alcohol, are due in large part to too much food.\r\n\r\n_Nursing._—Perhaps in no particular does nineteenth-century practice\r\ndiffer from that of the preceding centuries more than in the greater\r\nattention which is given to the personal comfort of the patient and to\r\nall the accessories comprised in the art of nursing. The physician has\r\nin the trained nurse an assistant who carries out his directions with a\r\nwatchful care, and who is on the lookout for danger-signals, and with\r\naccurate notes enables him to estimate the progress of a critical case\r\nfrom hour to hour. The intelligent, devoted women who have adopted the\r\nprofession of nursing, are not only in their ministrations a public\r\nbenefaction, but they have lightened the anxieties which form so large\r\na part of the load of the busy doctor.\r\n\r\n_Massage and Hydrotherapy_ have taken their places as most important\r\nmeasures of relief in many chronic conditions, and the latter has been\r\nalmost universally adopted as the only safe means of combating the high\r\ntemperatures of the acute fevers.\r\n\r\nWithin the past quarter of a century the value of _exercise_ in the\r\neducation of the young has become recognized. The increase in the means\r\nof taking wholesome out-of-door exercise is remarkable, and should show\r\nin a few years an influence in the reduction of the nervous troubles\r\nin young persons. The prophylactic benefit of systematic exercise,\r\ntaken in moderation by persons of middle age, is very great. Golf and\r\nthe bicycle have in the past few years materially lowered the average\r\nincomes of the doctors in this country as derived from persons under\r\nforty. From the senile contingent—those above this age—the average\r\nincome has for a time been raised by these exercises, as a large\r\nnumber of persons have been injured by taking up sports which may be\r\nvigorously pursued with safety only by those with young arteries.\r\n\r\nOf three departures in the art of healing, brief mention may be made.\r\nThe use of the extracts of certain organs (or of the organs themselves)\r\nin disease is as old as the days of the Romans, but an extraordinary\r\nimpetus has been given to the subject by the discovery of the curative\r\npowers of the extract of the thyroid gland in the diseases known\r\nas cretinism and myxœdema. The brilliancy of the results in these\r\ndiseases has had no parallel in the history of modern medicine, but\r\nit cannot be said that in the use of the extracts of other organs for\r\ndisease the results have fulfilled the sanguine expectations of many.\r\nThere was not, in the first place, the same physiological basis, and\r\npractitioners have used these extracts too indiscriminately and without\r\nsufficient knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I have already mentioned, we possess a sure and certain\r\nhope that for many of the acute infections antitoxins will be found.\r\n\r\nA third noteworthy feature in modern treatment has been a return to\r\npsychical methods of cure, in which _faith in something is suggested_\r\nto the patient. After all, faith is the great lever of life. Without\r\nit, man can do nothing; with it, even with a fragment, as a grain of\r\nmustard-seed, all things are possible to him. Faith in us, faith in\r\nour drugs and methods, is the great stock in trade of the profession.\r\nIn one pan of the balance, put the pharmacopœias of the world, all\r\nthe editions from Dioscorides to the last issue of the United States\r\nDispensatory; heap them on the scales as did Euripides his books in\r\nthe celebrated contest in the “Frogs”; in the other put the simple\r\nfaith with which from the days of the Pharaohs until now the children\r\nof men have swallowed the mixtures these works describe, and the bulky\r\ntomes will kick the beam. It is the _aurum potabile_, the touchstone of\r\nsuccess in medicine. As Galen says, confidence and hope do more good\r\nthan physic—“he cures most in whom most are confident.” That strange\r\ncompound of charlatan and philosopher, Paracelsus, encouraged his\r\npatients “to have a good faith, a strong imagination, and they shall\r\nfind the effects” (Burton). While we often overlook or are ignorant of\r\nour own faith-cures, doctors are just a wee bit too sensitive about\r\nthose performed outside our ranks. They have never had, and cannot\r\nexpect to have, a monopoly in this panacea, which is open to all, free\r\nas the sun, and which may make of every one in certain cases, as was\r\nthe Lacedemon of Homer’s day, “a good physician out of Nature’s grace.”\r\nFaith in the gods or in the saints cures one, faith in little pills\r\nanother, hypnotic suggestion a third, faith in a plain, common doctor\r\na fourth. In all ages the prayer of faith has healed the sick, and\r\nthe mental attitude of the suppliant seems to be of more consequence\r\nthan the powers to which the prayer is addressed. The cures in the\r\ntemples of Æsculapius, the miracles of the saints, the remarkable\r\ncures of those noble men, the Jesuit missionaries, in this country,\r\nthe modern miracles at Lourdes and at St. Anne de Beaupré in Quebec,\r\nand the wonder-workings of the so-called Christian Scientists, are\r\noften genuine, and must be considered in discussing the foundations of\r\ntherapeutics. We physicians use the same power every day. If a poor\r\nlass, paralyzed, apparently, helpless, bed-ridden for years, comes to\r\nme, having worn out in mind, body, and estate a devoted family; if she\r\nin a few weeks or less by faith in me, and faith alone, takes up her\r\nbed and walks, the saints of old could not have done more. St. Anne and\r\nmany others can scarcely to-day do less. We enjoy, I say, no monopoly\r\nin the faith business. The faith with which we work, the faith, indeed,\r\nwhich is available to-day in every-day life, has its limitations. It\r\nwill not raise the dead; it will not put in a new eye in place of a\r\nbad one (as it did to an Iroquois Indian boy for one of the Jesuit\r\nfathers), nor will it cure cancer or pneumonia, or knit a bone; but,\r\nin spite of these nineteenth-century restrictions, such as we find it,\r\nfaith is a most precious commodity, without which we should be very\r\nbadly off.\r\n\r\n_Hypnotism_, introduced by Mesmer in the eighteenth century, has\r\nhad several revivals as a method of treatment during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The first careful study of it was made by Braid, a Manchester\r\nsurgeon, who introduced the terms hypnotism, hypnotic, and nervous\r\nsleep; but at this time no very great measure of success followed\r\nits use in practice, except perhaps in the case of an Anglo-Indian\r\nsurgeon, James Esdaile, who, prior to the introduction of anæsthesia,\r\nhad performed two hundred and sixty-one surgical operations upon\r\npatients in a state of hypnotic unconsciousness. About 1880 the French\r\nphysicians, particularly Charcot and Bernheim, took up the study,\r\nand since that time hypnotism has been extensively practised. It may\r\nbe defined as a subjective psychical condition, what Braid called\r\nnervous sleep, resembling somnambulism, in which, as Shakespeare says,\r\nin the description of Lady Macbeth, the person receives at once the\r\nbenefit of sleep and does the effects or acts of watching or waking.\r\nTherapeutically, the important fact is that the individual’s natural\r\nsusceptibility to suggestion is increased, and this may hold after the\r\ncondition of hypnosis has passed away. The condition of hypnosis is\r\nusually itself induced by suggestion, requesting the subject to close\r\nthe eyes, to think of sleep, and the operator then repeats two or three\r\ntimes sentences suggesting sleep, and suggesting that the limbs are\r\ngetting heavy and that he is feeling drowsy. During this state it has\r\nbeen found that the subjects are very susceptible to suggestion. Too\r\nmuch must not be expected of hypnotism, and the claims which have been\r\nmade for it have been too often grossly exaggerated. It seems, as it\r\nhas been recently well put, that hypnotism “at best permits of making\r\nsuggestions more effective for good or bad than can be done upon one\r\nin his waking state.” It is found to be of very little use in organic\r\ndisease. It has been helpful in some cases of hysteria, in certain\r\nfunctional spasmodic affections of the nervous system, in the vicious\r\nhabits of childhood, and in suggesting to the victims of alcohol and\r\ndrugs that they should get rid of their inordinate desires. It has\r\nbeen used successfully in certain cases for the relief of labor pains,\r\nand in surgical operations; but on the whole, while a valuable agent\r\nin a few cases, it has scarcely fulfilled the expectations of its\r\nadvocates. It is a practice not without serious dangers, and should\r\nnever be performed except in the presence of a third person, and its\r\nindiscriminate practice by ignorant persons should be prevented by law.\r\n\r\nOne mode of faith-healing in modern days, which passes under the\r\nremarkable name of Christian Science, is probably nothing more than\r\nmental suggestion under another name. “The patient is told to be calm,\r\nand is assured that all will go well; that he must try to aid the\r\nhealer by believing that what is told him is true. The healer then,\r\nquietly but firmly, asserts and reiterates that there is no pain, no\r\nsuffering, that it is disappearing, that relief will come, that the\r\npatient is getting well.” This is precisely the method which Bernheim\r\nused to use with such success in his hypnotic patients at Nancy,\r\niterating and reiterating, in a most wearisome way, that the disease\r\nwould disappear and the patient would feel better. As has been pointed\r\nout by a recent writer (Dr. Harry Marshall), the chief basis for the\r\ngrowth of Christian Science is that which underlies every popular\r\nfallacy: “Oliver Wendell Holmes outlined very clearly the factors\r\nconcerned, showing (a) how easily abundant facts can be collected\r\nto prove anything whatsoever; (b) how insufficient ‘exalted wisdom,\r\nimmaculate honesty, and vast general acquirements’ are to prevent an\r\nindividual from having the most primitive ideas upon subjects out\r\nof his line of thought; and, finally, demonstrating ‘the boundless\r\ncredulity and excitability of mankind upon subjects connected with\r\nmedicine.’”\r\n\r\n            WILLIAM OSLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURGERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of the eighteenth century was made notable by one of the most\r\nremarkable and beneficent discoveries which has ever blessed the human\r\nrace, the discovery of the means of preventing small-pox. On May 14,\r\n1796, Dr. Edward Jenner inoculated James Phipps. When we remember that\r\ntwo million persons died in a single year in the Russian Empire from\r\nsmall-pox; that in 1707 in Iceland, out of a population of thirty\r\nthousand, sixty per cent., or eighteen thousand, died; that in Jenner’s\r\ntime “an adult person who had not had small-pox was scarcely met with\r\nor heard of in the United Kingdom, and that owing to his discovery\r\nsmall-pox is now one of the rarest diseases,” the strong words I have\r\nused seem fully justified. But the eighteenth century was not to\r\nwitness the end of progress in medicine. The advances in the nineteenth\r\ncentury have been even more startling and more beneficent. What these\r\nadvances have been in the department of medicine has been related by\r\nProfessor Osler. It is my province to speak only of surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF TEACHING\r\n\r\nThe first advance which should be mentioned is a fundamental\r\none—namely, methods of medical teaching. At the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century there were only three medical schools in the United\r\nStates: the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nestablished in 1765; the Medical Department of Harvard, established\r\nin 1783; and the Medical Department of Dartmouth, established in\r\n1797. The last report of the Commissioner of Education gives a list\r\nof one hundred and fifty-five medical schools now in existence in\r\nthis country, many of them still poorly equipped and struggling for\r\nexistence, but a large number of them standing in the first rank, with\r\nexcellent modern equipment, both in teachers, laboratories, hospitals,\r\nand other facilities. The medical curriculum then extended over\r\nonly two years or less, and consisted of courses of lectures at the\r\nmost by seven professors who, year after year, read the same course\r\nof lectures, without illustrations and with no practical teaching.\r\nThe medical schools, even when connected with universities, were\r\npractically private corporations, the members of which took all the\r\nfees, spent what money they were compelled to spend in the maintenance\r\nof what we now should call the semblance of an education, and divided\r\nthe profits. Until within about twenty years this method prevailed in\r\nall our medical schools. But the last two decades of the century have\r\nseen a remarkable awakening of the medical profession to the need of\r\na broader and more liberal education, and that, as a prerequisite,\r\nthe medical schools should be on the same basis as the department of\r\narts in every well-regulated college. To accomplish this the boards of\r\ntrustees have taken possession of the fees of students, have placed the\r\nfaculties upon salaries, and have used such portion of the incomes of\r\nthe institutions as was needed for a constant and yet rapid development\r\nalong the most liberal lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE HOSPITALS\r\n\r\nThe first step has been the establishment in connection with most\r\nschools of general hospitals in which the various teachers in the\r\ncollege should be the clinical instructors, and where the students\r\nwould have the means not only of hearing theoretically what should be\r\ndone to the sick, but of actually examining the patients under the\r\nsupervision of their instructors, studying the cases so as to become\r\nskilled in reaching a diagnosis and indicating what in their opinion\r\nwas necessary in the way either of hygiene, medicine, or surgical\r\noperation. More than that, in most of the advanced schools to-day the\r\nstudents assist the clinical faculties of the hospitals in the actual\r\nperformance of operations, so that when they graduate they are skilled\r\nto a degree utterly unknown twenty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF LABORATORIES\r\n\r\nAnother step which was equally important, and in some respects even\r\nmore so, has been the establishment of laboratories connected with each\r\nbranch of instruction. A laboratory of anatomy (the dissecting room)\r\nevery medical school has always had, but all the other laboratories are\r\nrecent additions. Among these may be named a laboratory of clinical\r\nmedicine, a laboratory of therapeutics, in which the action of drugs\r\nis studied; a laboratory of chemistry, a laboratory of microscopy, a\r\nlaboratory of pathology for the study of diseased tissues, a laboratory\r\nof embryology for the study of the development of the human body and\r\nof the embryos of animals, a laboratory of hygiene, a laboratory of\r\nbacteriology, a laboratory of pharmacy, a surgical laboratory, in which\r\nall the operations of surgery are done on the cadaver by each student,\r\na laboratory of physiology, and in many colleges private rooms in which\r\nadvanced work may be done for the discovery of new truths.\r\n\r\nIn all these laboratories, instead of simply hearing about the\r\nexperiments and observations, each student is required to handle the\r\ndrugs, the chemicals, the apparatus, to do all the operations, to look\r\nthrough the microscope, etc.; in other words, to do all that which is\r\nnecessary for the proper understanding of the case in hand. In fact,\r\nit may be said that in view of the opportunities and the requirements\r\nof modern hospitals, it is undoubtedly true that a hospital patient,\r\nthe poorest of the poor, often has his case more thoroughly studied and\r\nmore accurately observed than the wealthy patient who is attended at\r\nhis home. On the other hand, however, so many laboratories with their\r\nexpensive apparatus and a large staff of assistants mean an enormous\r\nincrease in the expense of a medical education, for which the student\r\ndoes not pay anything like an equivalent. Hence the need in all of our\r\nbest modern medical schools for endowments, in order that such work may\r\nbe carried on properly, and yet the student not be charged such fees as\r\nto be practically prohibitory, excepting for the rich, or at the least\r\nthe well-to-do. I do not hesitate to say that at the end of the second\r\nyear many a diligent student of to-day is better fitted to practise\r\nmedicine than was the graduate of half a century ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL MATERIAL\r\n\r\nOne of the most important means of the study of medicine, and\r\nespecially of surgery, is a thorough acquaintance with the anatomy of\r\nthe human body. No one would think of placing an engineer in charge\r\nof a complicated piece of machinery, who had never become intimately\r\nacquainted with all the parts of such a machine, so that he could take\r\nit to pieces and put it together again with ease and intelligence.\r\nYet, until comparatively recently, this knowledge of anatomy was\r\nboth required of, and yet at the same time the means of obtaining it\r\nwas forbidden to, the medical student. If he performed an operation\r\nand was guilty of negligence or error, due to his want of anatomical\r\nknowledge, he was liable to a suit for malpractice. Yet his only\r\nmeans of becoming acquainted with the anatomy of the human body was\r\nby stealing the bodies of the dead. In England, up to 1832, this was\r\nequally true. A regular traffic in human bodies existed there as\r\nwell as here, and, by reason of its perils, the cost of bodies for\r\ndissection was very great; but it was only a question of money. In\r\nhis testimony before the Parliamentary Committee, Sir Astley Cooper\r\nmade a shiver run down the backs of the noble lords who listened to\r\nhim when he said that in order to dissect the body of any of them it\r\nwas only necessary for him to pay enough. The large pecuniary profits\r\nof such business, when the supply was very small, led to the horrible\r\natrocities of Burke and Hare in Edinburgh in 1832. They deliberately\r\nmurdered a considerable number of persons, and sold the bodies to the\r\ndissecting rooms in that city. The discovery of their crimes finally\r\nled to the passage of the Anatomy Act, which has been in force in\r\nGreat Britain ever since. Similar violations of graveyards in this\r\ncountry have led to the passage in various States of somewhat similar\r\nlaws, usually giving for dissection the bodies of those who were so\r\npoor in friendship that no one would spend the money necessary for\r\ntheir burial. Even to-day, in a large number of our States, the former\r\nanomalous condition of affairs exists. The increase of anatomical\r\nmaterial which has resulted from the enactment of wise and salutary\r\nlaws for this purpose has given a great impetus to the study of\r\nanatomy, and has produced a far better educated class of physicians\r\nin most parts of the United States within the last few years. The\r\nenlightened sense of the community has perceived that to deny the\r\nmedical schools the means of properly teaching anatomy was a fatal\r\nmistake, and resulted in an ignorance of which the community were\r\nthe victims. As a result, it is possible now, by law, in most States\r\nto obtain a reasonable number of cadavers, not only for the study of\r\nanatomy, but for the performance of all the usual operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nAlong with this there has been throughout this country a marked\r\nmovement in favor of medical libraries. It is to the credit of the\r\ngovernment of the United States that the whole world is debtor to us,\r\nnot only for the foremost medical library in the world, that of the\r\nsurgeon-general of the army in Washington, but also for the magnificent\r\nindex-catalogue, not only of the books, but all the journal articles\r\nin every language in the world. No better investment of money was ever\r\nmade than the establishment of this library, and its allied museum, and\r\nthe publication of the index-catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBRYOLOGY\r\n\r\nAs a result of all these means and methods of study, and as a part of\r\nthe great educational and scientific movement of the century, medical\r\nmen now take a wholly different view of the normal and abnormal\r\nstructures of the human body. The study of embryology has shown us that\r\nmany of the deviations from the normal development of the human body\r\nare easily explained by embryology. One of the most important changes\r\nin our idea, for example, of tumors is due to the fact that the study\r\nof embryology and of the tissues of the embryo have shown us that\r\ndiseased structures, which lack explanation entirely, when compared\r\nwith the adult human tissues, readily find their explanation and fall\r\ninto an unexpected order when compared with the tissues of the embryo.\r\nNot only, however, has the study of embryological tissues thrown a\r\nflood of light on diseased structures, but we have obtained new views\r\nof the relation of man to all creatures, lower in the scale of life.\r\nLargely owing to the doctrine of evolution, we now recognize the fact\r\nthat, so far as his body is concerned, man is kindred to the brutes;\r\nthat his diseases, within certain limitations, are identical with\r\nsimilar diseases of the lower animals; that his anatomy and physiology\r\nare, in essence, the same as the anatomy and physiology of the lower\r\nanimals, even the very lowest, and that many of his diseases can be\r\nbest studied in the lower animals, because upon them we can make exact\r\nexperiments which would be impossible in man. While it is true that\r\neach animal has disorders which are peculiar to itself, and that it is\r\nnot subject to some of the disorders to which man is a victim, and,\r\n_per contra_, that man is a victim to some disorders from which animals\r\ndo not suffer, yet, taking them as a whole, the diseases of man and of\r\nanimals, and the action of remedies on both, are practically identical.\r\nTo this I shall have occasion to refer again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nAmong the laboratories which I mentioned, one of the most important is\r\nthat of pathology and morbid anatomy, or the study of diseased tissues\r\nand organs. The first work on pathology written in this country was\r\nby one of our best-known surgeons, the late Samuel D. Gross, and one\r\nof his most important contributions to surgical progress consisted in\r\nhis persistent advocacy of the need for the study of pathology as a\r\nbasis for all our means of cure. This is evident, if we consider the\r\nillustration I used a moment ago of a steam-engine. Unless he knows\r\nprecisely the defects of such a machine, the influence of fresh or\r\nsalt water on a boiler, the influence of rust, the effect of oils,\r\nentirely apart from the mere mechanism of the engine, an engineer\r\nmight make the most serious mistake, resulting in fatal damage, both to\r\nthe machine and probably to life. So, surgical pathology is the study\r\nof the processes of disease, the alterations in the minute structure\r\nof tissues and organs, without which no surgeon can be fitted for\r\nhis task, much less can he be called an accomplished surgeon. All of\r\nthese laboratories mark the difference between the scientific and the\r\nempirical method. The old student of medicine went from case to case,\r\nheard many a good maxim, and learned many a useful trick; but, after\r\nall, it was only an empirical knowledge which he obtained. It did\r\nnot go to the foundation of things, it was not scientific, as is the\r\ncollegiate instruction of to-day.\r\n\r\nHaving now glanced rapidly at the improvement in medical instruction,\r\nlet me turn next to a few of the principal discoveries which have made\r\nthe surgery of to-day so much superior to the surgery of a hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nANÆSTHESIA\r\n\r\nAfter vaccination, the most important medical event of the century is\r\nthe discovery of anæsthesia. While there were some prior attempts at\r\nanæsthesia, practically it dates from October 16, 1846, when Dr. John\r\nC. Warren, in the Massachusetts General Hospital, first performed a\r\nmajor surgical operation, without inflicting the slightest pain. I\r\ncannot enter into the merits of the various claimants for the credit\r\nof first using an anæsthetic, but ether was then for the first time\r\npublicly administered by Morton, and the very sponge which was then\r\nused is now a precious trophy of the Massachusetts General Hospital.\r\nI may, perhaps, quote from an address which I delivered before the\r\nMedical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, at their\r\ncentennial anniversary, in April, 1899, the following in relation to\r\nanæsthesia:\r\n\r\n    “The news went like wildfire, and anæsthesia was soon introduced\r\n    into every clinic and at almost every operation throughout\r\n    the civilized world. Prior to that time a surgical operation\r\n    was attended with horrors which those who live in these days\r\n    cannot appreciate. He was the best surgeon who could perform any\r\n    operation in the least possible time. The whole object of new\r\n    methods of operating was to shorten the period of frightful agony\r\n    which every patient had to endure. Every second of suffering\r\n    saved was an incalculable boon. To submit to any operation\r\n    required then a heroism and an endurance which is almost\r\n    incomprehensible to us now. All of the more modern, deliberate,\r\n    careful, painstaking operations, involving minute dissection,\r\n    amid nerves and blood-vessels, when life or death depends on the\r\n    accuracy of almost every touch of the knife, were absolutely\r\n    impossible. It was beyond human endurance quietly to submit one’s\r\n    self for an hour, for an hour and a half, for two hours, or even\r\n    longer, to such physical agony.\r\n\r\n    “It is a striking commentary on the immediate results of\r\n    anæsthesia to learn that, in five years before the introduction\r\n    of ether, only one hundred and eighty-four persons were\r\n    willing to submit themselves to such a dreadful ordeal in the\r\n    Massachusetts General Hospital—an average of thirty-seven\r\n    operations per annum, or three per month.... During the last\r\n    year, in the same hospital—a Mecca for every surgeon the world\r\n    over—over thirty-seven hundred operations were performed. It is\r\n    not an uncommon thing at the present day for any one of the more\r\n    active surgeons of this country to do as many as four or five\r\n    hundred operations in a year. I have known as many as nineteen\r\n    operations to be done in the Jefferson Medical College Hospital\r\n    in a single day—equalling six months’ work in Boston before the\r\n    introduction of ether.”\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1847, witnessed the introduction of chloroform by Sir\r\nJames Y. Simpson, of Edinburgh. Until I became acquainted with the\r\nstriking figures just quoted, I had often wondered at the hospital\r\nscene in that most touching story, _Rab and His Friends_, by the late\r\ngifted and well-beloved physician, Dr. John Brown, of Edinburgh.\r\nNowadays students do not rush into the surgical amphitheatre when they\r\nlearn that an operation is to be done, but it is taken as a matter of\r\ncourse, for practically every day many operations are done in most of\r\nour large hospitals. But, at the time when Rab’s mistress was operated\r\nupon, an operation, as has been stated, was a very rare event. Few had\r\nthe fortitude to endure its dreadful pangs. Now, thanks to the blessed\r\nsleep of anæsthesia, sufferers from even the most dreadful disorders\r\ncan have long and difficult operations done, accurate and tedious\r\ndissections made, and yet feel not a twinge of pain.\r\n\r\nBesides general anæsthesia by ether, chloroform, and a few other\r\nagents, there have been introduced several means for producing “local\r\nanæsthesia,” _i.e._, agents which destroy the sensibility of the part\r\nof the body to be operated upon while not producing unconsciousness.\r\nFreezing the part by ice and salt, or by a quickly evaporating spray\r\nof rhigolene or chloride of ethyl, are sometimes used. But cocaine\r\nand a somewhat similar substance, eucaine, have of late been more\r\nextensively used on man, after their harmlessness had been first shown\r\nby experiments on animals. In 1885 Corning, of New York, injected a\r\nsolution of cocaine as near to the spinal cord as was possible, and\r\nproduced insensibility of all the body below the point of injection\r\nby the effect of the cocaine upon the spinal cord. A few years ago\r\nQuincke, of Kiel, in Germany, devised a means of puncturing the spinal\r\ncanal itself in the lumbar region (the lowest part of the small\r\nof the back) for the purpose of drawing off some of the fluid for\r\nexamination. This suggested to Bier, then of Kiel, who was apparently\r\nignorant of Corning’s work, that cocaine could be injected through a\r\nhollow needle inserted into the spinal canal by “lumbar puncture” and\r\nso produce anæsthesia of all the body below this point. This method\r\nwas published by him in 1899, and was soon repeated in America. In\r\nFrance, however, it has been practised more than elsewhere, Tupper,\r\nof Paris, having successfully done over two hundred operations by\r\n“spinal anæsthesia.” All of the body below the diaphragm can thus be\r\ndeprived of sensibility. The method will probably never replace ether\r\nand chloroform, but in many cases is a valuable aid to the surgeon.\r\nBut it has its dangers and its inconveniences. The ideal anæsthetic\r\nis not that which destroys sensibility and yet leaves the patient\r\nperfectly conscious, as spinal anæsthesia does. A patient to whom I\r\nrecently proposed it for certain special reasons rejected it, saying,\r\nwith probable truth, that she could never bear the strain of lying on\r\nthe table perfectly conscious of all that was being done and frightened\r\nby any surgical emergency which might easily arise in such a long,\r\ndifficult, and dangerous operation. The ideal anæsthetic is that\r\nwhich will abolish pain and consciousness without danger to life. The\r\ntwentieth century will undoubtedly see the discovery of this safe and\r\nefficient anæsthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTISEPSIS\r\n\r\nBut the limits of surgical progress were not yet reached. Let me quote\r\nagain from the address before alluded to:\r\n\r\n    “Even the introduction of anæsthesia, however, did not rid\r\n    surgery of all its terrors. The acute pain of the operation was\r\n    abolished, but the after-suffering, as I know only too well,\r\n    in my early surgical days, was something dreadful to see. The\r\n    parched lips of the poor sufferer, tossing uneasily during\r\n    sleepless nights; wounds reeking with pus, and patients dying by\r\n    scores from blood-poisoning, from erysipelas, from tetanus, from\r\n    gangrene, were only too familiar sights in the pre-antiseptic\r\n    days. Then, again, there arose one of these deliverers of the\r\n    human race whose name can never be forgotten and whose fame will\r\n    last so long as time shall endure. Jenner, Warren, and Lister\r\n    are a triumvirate of names of which any profession may well be\r\n    proud. Thank God, they all sprang from virile Anglo-Saxon loins!\r\n    No praise, no reward, no fame is too great for them. That Lord\r\n    Lister still lives to see the triumph of his marvellous services\r\n    to humanity is a joy to all of us. And when the profession arose\r\n    _en masse_, within the last few years, at the International\r\n    Congress of Berlin, and at the meeting of the British Medical\r\n    Association in Montreal, and welcomed him with cheer after cheer,\r\n    it was but a feeble expression of gratitude for benefits which no\r\n    words can express.\r\n\r\n    “Before Lister’s day erysipelas, tetanus, gangrene, and\r\n    blood-poisoning in its various phases were the constant\r\n    attendant of every surgeon. They were dreaded guests at almost\r\n    any operation; and when in rare cases we obtained primary union\r\n    without a drop of pus, without fever, and with but little\r\n    suffering, it was a marvellous achievement. Now it is precisely\r\n    reversed. The surgeon who does not get primary union without\r\n    a drop of pus, with no fever, and with little suffering, asks\r\n    himself—what was the fault in my technic? To open the head, the\r\n    abdomen, or the chest thirty years ago was almost equivalent to\r\n    signing the death-warrant of a patient. The early mortality of\r\n    ovariotomy was about sixty per cent.; two out of three died. Now\r\n    many a surgeon can point to a series of one hundred abdominal\r\n    operations with a fatality of only two or three per cent. When\r\n    Sir Spencer Wells recorded his first one thousand cases of\r\n    ovariotomy it was calculated that after deducting the years which\r\n    the patients who died from the operation would have lived had no\r\n    operation been done the net result of the thousand cases was an\r\n    addition of twenty thousand years to human life. One thousand\r\n    ovariotomies under antiseptic precautions at the present would\r\n    certainly add at least thirty thousand years to human life. Would\r\n    not such a guerdon be enough for any man?\r\n\r\n    “This, too, is a direct result of laborious laboratory\r\n    researches, beginning with the investigations of Liebig and\r\n    Pasteur on fermentation. Lister went still further. Even before\r\n    the discovery of the bacteria of suppuration, of tetanus, and\r\n    of erysipelas he showed us experimentally how, by surgical\r\n    cleanliness, we could avoid all infection and so banish these\r\n    pests from our hospitals and bring life and health to many who\r\n    otherwise would have perished from operations which are now\r\n    perfectly safe.\r\n\r\n    “The mortality of compound fractures in the pre-antiseptic days\r\n    was about sixty per cent. It was one of the most dreaded of\r\n    all accidents. Its mortality now is perhaps not over three per\r\n    cent., and the mortality from sepsis after such a fracture, in\r\n    the hands of well-instructed surgeons, is almost nil. Prior to\r\n    Lister’s day the mortality of major amputations varied from fifty\r\n    to sixty-three per cent. Now it is from ten to twenty per cent.\r\n    And so I might go on with operation after operation and show how\r\n    they have become so safe that one need not dread any, saving\r\n    exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n    “These two modern discoveries, anæsthesia and antisepsis, have\r\n    utterly revolutionized modern surgery. They have made possible\r\n    operations which, by reason of their length and pain and danger,\r\n    were utterly unjustifiable in former days, but are now the daily\r\n    occupation of a busy surgeon. And, far better than this, they\r\n    have enabled us to bring to homes and hearts, which otherwise\r\n    would have been broken up and wrung with sorrow, the comfort of\r\n    life restored to dear ones upon whom depended the happiness and\r\n    support of the families. Translate figures into happy hearts and\r\n    prosperous homes if you can, and then you can tell me what Warren\r\n    and Lister have done for humanity!”\r\n\r\nThe result of these two wonderful discoveries has been to separate us\r\nfrom the surgical past, as by a great gulf.\r\n\r\n    “Great theologians, such as a Calvin or a Jonathan Edwards,\r\n    were they recalled to life, could discourse as learnedly as\r\n    ever of predestination and free will; great preachers, as\r\n    a Beecher or a Spurgeon, could stir our souls and warm our\r\n    hearts as of old; great jurists, as a Justinian or a Marshall,\r\n    could expound the same principles of law which hold good for\r\n    all time; great forensic orators, as a Burke or a Webster,\r\n    could convince us by the same arguments and arouse us by the\r\n    same invectives or the same eloquence that made our fathers\r\n    willing captives to their silver tongues. But to-day, so rapid\r\n    has been our surgical progress, a Velpeau, a Sir William\r\n    Ferguson, or a Pancoast, all of whom have died within the\r\n    last thirty years, could not teach modern surgical principles\r\n    nor perform a modern surgical operation. Even our every-day\r\n    surgical vocabulary—staphylococcus, streptococcus, infection,\r\n    immunity, antisepsis and asepsis, toxin and antitoxin—would be\r\n    unintelligible jargon to him; and our modern operations on the\r\n    brain, the chest, the abdomen, and the pelvis would make him\r\n    wonder whether we had not lost our senses, until, seeing the\r\n    almost uniform and almost painless recoveries, he would thank God\r\n    for the magnificent progress of the last half-century, which had\r\n    vouchsafed such magical, nay, such almost divine, power to the\r\n    modern surgeon.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURGERY OF WAR\r\n\r\nOne of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the antiseptic\r\nmethod has been a remarkable mitigation of the horrors of war. Our\r\nrecent war with Spain has proved, and the present military operations\r\nin the Philippines and of the British in South Africa will still\r\nfurther prove, its advantages. Witness a little book written by\r\nProfessor von Esmarch, of Kiel, Germany, with the apt title, _The Fight\r\nof Humanity Against the Horrors of War_; with an appendix, entitled,\r\n“The Samaritan on the Battle-field.” One of the most valuable means\r\nfor the preservation of human life is carried by every soldier in a\r\nmodern civilized army as a part of his regulation outfit, a “First\r\nAid Package” for the treatment of any wound or injury; and one of the\r\nmost valuable and interesting papers read before the American Surgical\r\nAssociation, at its meeting in Chicago in 1899, was by Professor\r\nSenn on the “First Aid Package.” This first aid package contains an\r\nantiseptic dressing, which can be applied to all but the gravest wounds\r\nfor the purpose of preventing infection, which is the principal danger\r\nto life after accident or injury. The universal testimony of our\r\nsurgeons in Cuba was that by its use most wounds were prevented from\r\nbecoming infected, and, therefore, inflamed, and that the number of\r\noperations was greatly diminished by reason of its use.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn experimental science, two methods of progress are observed; first,\r\nin actual practice certain methods are adopted because they are found\r\nto be the most advantageous and useful, though we cannot explain why\r\nit is so—_i.e._, practice outstrips theory. Again, as a result of\r\nexperimental investigation, certain facts are discovered which explain\r\nwhy the practical methods just alluded to are the best, and this in\r\nturn suggests further improvements in our practice—_i.e._, theory\r\noutstrips practice and enlarges its domain. Thus outstripping theory,\r\nthe practical advance made by Lister was an example of the first. His\r\nstriking results in turn stimulated scientific observers to make new\r\ndiscoveries of the greatest importance, and thus science immensely\r\nimproved and widened our practical methods.\r\n\r\nNo definite year or day can be assigned as the birth-date of Lord\r\nLister’s antiseptic methods, as we can, for instance, for vaccination\r\nor for anæsthesia. We may assume, at least for this country, the\r\nsummer of 1876 as the starting-point. During that year Lord Lister\r\nattended the International Medical Congress held in Philadelphia,\r\nand demonstrated his then methods and convinced a few surgeons of\r\ntheir immense advantages. Even before that date there had been very\r\nmany experiments and observations, especially on the blood. In 1863\r\nDavaine, in France, had discovered little rod-like bodies in the\r\nblood in wool-sorters’ disease, or anthrax, which he named from their\r\nshape “bacteria,” or “little rods.” This name has been adopted for\r\nall forms of germs, though many of them are not rod-like in their\r\nshape. Not until 1881 was the cause of inflammation and suppuration\r\n(the formation of pus or “matter”) discovered. In that year Ogston, of\r\nAberdeen, published experiments which he believed demonstrated the\r\nfact that certain bacteria were the cause of suppuration. Since then\r\nthis has been amply confirmed not only by experiments upon animals,\r\nbut by observation in man. In 1882 Robert Koch, of Berlin, discovered\r\nthe cause of tuberculosis, a little rod-like body, which is named the\r\n“bacillus” of tuberculosis. In 1883 Fehleisen discovered the germ\r\nof erysipelas, and in 1887 Nicolaier and Rosenbaum discovered the\r\nbacillus of tetanus or lockjaw. So recent have been the discoveries\r\nin bacteriology which have led to vast improvements in our methods of\r\ntreatment of wounds and the performance of operations.\r\n\r\nWhile the principles established by Lord Lister have remained\r\nunchanged, the details in the treatment have been greatly simplified\r\nand made more efficient. For the information of the general reader, let\r\nme state a few facts. Bacteria are divided into two principal classes,\r\nin accordance with their form. One, known as “cocci,” from the Greek\r\nword coccus—“berry”—may be likened to billiard-balls. Some of these\r\noccur in bunches, which have been likened to bunches of grapes, and\r\nhence are called, again from a Greek term, “staphylococci.” Others are\r\narranged in chains, like beads, and are called “streptococci.” These\r\nlast are very much more virulent and dangerous than the staphylococci.\r\nBoth of these produce pus or matter, and they are the most widely\r\ndiffused and most common forms found in infected or suppurating\r\nwounds. One form is the cause of erysipelas. A second form, known as\r\n“bacilli,” may be likened to a lead-pencil. Among the various bacilli\r\nthat have been discovered are those of tuberculosis, glanders, tetanus\r\nor lockjaw, etc. I omit many others found in medical disorders, as they\r\ndo not concern this paper. How important these discoveries are may be\r\nseen by the following facts: Tuberculosis, next to that of suppuration,\r\nis, perhaps, the most widely extended infection to which man, as\r\nwell as animals, is liable. We are all familiar with it in the form\r\nof “consumption,” but the non-medical reader is, perhaps, not aware\r\nof the fact that it affects not only the lungs, but also the bowels\r\nin consumption of the bowels; the bones, as is seen by every surgeon\r\nalmost daily, and especially as the cause of the crooked backs seen\r\nin spine diseases; in the joints, as is seen in hip-joint disease,\r\nwhite swelling of the knee, ankle-joint disease, and similar disease\r\nof all the other large joints of the body; in the brain, in tubercular\r\nmeningitis; in the abdominal cavity, in tubercular peritonitis; in\r\nthe skin, in certain forms of ulceration, commonly called lupus; in\r\nthe glands, as in the swollen glands, or “bunches,” in the neck, and\r\nendless other varieties which I need not name.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus of lockjaw is found in great abundance around stables, and\r\nthis explains the fact that hostlers, drivers, cavalrymen, all of whom\r\nhad to do with horses, are especially liable to attacks of lockjaw.\r\nMoreover, certain bacteria thrive best when exposed to the open air.\r\nOther bacteria, and among them the bacilli of lockjaw, thrive best when\r\nthe air is excluded, and this explains the danger of treading on a\r\nrusty nail, which is popularly and rightly known as peculiarly liable\r\nto produce lockjaw. The reason is not because it is a nail, nor because\r\nit is old, nor because it is rusty, but because from the earth in which\r\nit lies it is most apt to be the means of introducing into a punctured\r\nwound the bacilli of lockjaw. Such a wound bleeds but very little, the\r\nblood soon crusts and excludes the air, and if any of the bacilli of\r\nlockjaw have been carried into the body, they find in such a closed\r\nwound, from which the air is excluded, the most favorable conditions\r\nfor growth and infection of the whole body. Knowing these facts from\r\nexperiment, the treatment is clear. Lay open such a wound and disinfect\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThese two forms, the “cocci,” or berry-like bacteria, and the\r\n“bacilli,” or rod-like bacteria, comprise the great majority of\r\ndangerous bacteria.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that there is an enormous number of bacteria\r\nwhich are not dangerous; some of them are entirely harmless even\r\nif introduced into the human body. Others are the bacteria of\r\ndecomposition, or putrefaction, which are known as “saprophytic”\r\nbacteria. All of the harmless ones are known as “non-pathogenic,” that\r\nis, non-producers of disease. Those which produce disease are known\r\nas “pathogenic,” and those which produce suppuration as “pyogenic” or\r\npus-producing bacteria.\r\n\r\nAll of these bacteria are plants, and not, as is very frequently\r\nsupposed, animals of a low form. The danger from their introduction\r\ninto the body can be best appreciated, perhaps, by the statement\r\nof Belfield, who estimated that a single bacterium which weighs,\r\napproximately, only the 1-40,000,000 part of a grain, if given plenty\r\nof food and plenty of “elbow room,” would so rapidly develop that in\r\nthree days it would form a mass weighing 800 tons! It is the old story\r\nof the blacksmith who was to get a penny for the first nail, two for\r\nthe second, four for the third, and so on till a set of shoes would\r\ncost more than Crœsus could pay for.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the bacteria has been determined by experiment to be\r\nproportionate to the dose. A cubic centimetre is a cube two-fifths\r\nof an inch on each side. One-tenth of such a cube of pure culture of\r\none bacterium (_Proteus vulgaris_) contains 225,000,000 bacteria,\r\nand if injected under the skin of a rabbit will produce death.\r\nLess than 18,000,000 will produce no effect whatever. Of one kind\r\nof staphylococcus, if 250,000,000 are introduced under the skin of\r\na rabbit there will be produced a small abscess, but it requires\r\n1,000,000,000 to produce speedy death. On the other hand, of the\r\nbacillus of lockjaw it requires only 1000 to produce death, so virulent\r\nis this germ.\r\n\r\nMoreover, their effect on tissues and persons in different states\r\nvaries very much. Thus, it is found that when a certain number of\r\nbacteria are injected into the cavity of the abdomen of an animal, if\r\nthe animal is healthy and the peritoneum (the thin lining membrane\r\nof the abdomen) is healthy, the animal will recover perfectly well;\r\nbut if the peritoneum be scraped and torn (and it must be remembered\r\nthat the healthy peritoneum is devoid of sensation), that the same\r\ndose which before was harmless will now produce a violent peritonitis\r\nand very likely death. The practical lesson from this experiment upon\r\nanimals is very evident. Every surgeon who opens the abdomen is most\r\ncareful, if possible, not to injure the peritoneum, but manipulates\r\nwith the greatest care lest fatal results follow any serious injury\r\nto that membrane. So, too, if the general health be impaired, it is\r\nfound that an injection from which a healthy animal would recover will\r\nbe followed by fatal consequences if the general health is below par.\r\nAgain, if an animal has a simple fracture of his thigh-bone, and that\r\nis the only injury that he receives, no infection from the exterior\r\nhaving occurred, he will make a good recovery; but if at the same time\r\nhe receives a lacerated wound, it may be even in another part of the\r\nbody, and this wound, not being cared for most scrupulously, becomes\r\ninfected, the infection will fasten on the distant spot of least\r\nresistance, the broken thigh-bone, and will produce a most dangerous\r\nand very frequently fatal form of inflammation.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely point out in this connection, as in fact throughout\r\nthis entire consideration of bacteriology, how important a part in\r\nits development has been played by experiment upon animals. The\r\nexperimental facts just stated are of vital importance in the treatment\r\nof surgical diseases, and evidently could not have been determined\r\nupon mankind. It is not too much to say that had vivisection been\r\nrestricted or prohibited the surgery of to-day would be the barbarous\r\nsurgery of thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nEven granting that an enormous number of the bacteria are harmless,\r\nthe wonder is that with so many foes on every hand we live an ordinary\r\nlifetime. Fortunately, however, in the human body there is not only a\r\nlack of food sufficient and “elbow room” enough for them to work their\r\ndire effects, but there is that which “makes for righteousness” in our\r\nphysical organization as well as in our souls.\r\n\r\nThe moment that bacteria are introduced into the human body a certain\r\nnumber of cells hasten to destroy them. These are called “phagocytes”\r\nor devouring cells, because they eat up the bacteria. Whether the\r\npatient survives or dies depends on whether the bacteria get the upper\r\nhand of the phagocytes or the phagocytes the upper hand of the bacteria.\r\n\r\nThese statements are very easy to make, but the results have only been\r\nobtained by prolonged and laborious investigations in the laboratory\r\nand by experiments upon animals which have demonstrated these facts.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria are recognized by various methods: First, by form. Many\r\nwhich are identical in appearance, however, differ greatly in effects.\r\nA handful of turnip-seed and a handful of rape-seed look very much\r\nalike, but if they are planted the plants differ so greatly that we can\r\nrecognize the difference in the seed by the difference in the crop;\r\nhence the second method of recognizing differences in bacteria is by\r\nplanting them. Different methods have been practised. Some are sown on\r\nthe raw surface of a potato; others on bread paste; others in certain\r\njelly-like materials, such as gelatine or agar-agar. It was soon found\r\nas a result of these experiments that the bacteria flourished best,\r\nsome in one soil, some in another. Again, the crops of mould which come\r\nfrom them differ greatly in color, some being black, some red, some\r\nwhite, some yellow, etc. A third method also is by staining them with\r\nvarious dyes, when it is found that some bacteria will take one stain\r\nbest, others will take another, and so on through the whole list.\r\n\r\nAt first it was thought that these bacteria existed chiefly in the air,\r\nand hence in Lister’s early methods powerful spray-producing apparatus\r\nwere used; but while it is true that they do exist in the air, it is\r\nfound that this is not the principal source of infection. There is no\r\nsubstance (which has not been disinfected) that is not covered with\r\nthe germs of these little plants. They exist in our food and drink;\r\nbut the intestine is, one may say, a natural home in which many exist\r\nwithout harm to the body. For surgical purposes their existence is most\r\nimportant, first, in the earth, where, as I have already shown, the\r\nbacillus of lockjaw is most frequently found. So, too, the bacillus of\r\nwool-sorters’ disease (_Anthrax_) exists in the earth. If an animal\r\ndying of anthrax is buried, worms coming from the carcass up through\r\nthe ground carry the infection, so that other animals grazing over\r\nthis surface will become readily infected. The means by which we can\r\navoid infection from the earth is very evident, viz., every person\r\nwho has been run over by the cars or who has fallen on the ground and\r\nbroken his leg, etc., must have the wound most carefully cleansed from\r\nall dirt. If this is scrupulously done the danger of tetanus or other\r\nsimilar earth-born bacterial disease is almost nothing.\r\n\r\nA still greater danger to every patient, however, is found in the\r\nclothing, in the skin, and all dressings which are applied to wounds.\r\nThe skin is full of bacteria of the most dangerous kind; even the\r\nspotless hands of the bride, in the eyes of the surgeon, are dirty.\r\nNo one can touch a wound with ordinarily clean hands without infecting\r\nit. All clothing, dressings—_e.g._, lint and soft linen rags, and such\r\nlike—are full of bacteria of the most dangerous kind. Perhaps the most\r\ndangerous place is the space under the nails of the surgeon’s hand, for\r\nthe mere mechanical removal of any dirt under the nails by cleansing\r\nthem does not make them clean surgically. The nails must be cut short\r\nand prepared in a way I shall mention directly, or they are full of\r\nperil to any patient into whose wound a non-disinfected finger is\r\nintroduced. Again, another source of infection which thirty years ago\r\nwe never thought of is our instruments. Then instruments were washed\r\nwith soap and water and were made clean to the eye, but they were still\r\ncovered with invisible death-dealing bacteria which hid especially in\r\nthe joints and irregularities of the surface of all instruments.\r\n\r\nAll of these somewhat detailed statements lead up to a consideration\r\nof the difference between the old surgery and the new. Thirty years\r\nago when an operation was to be performed or an accident cared for we\r\nlaid out our instruments which were visibly clean, used them with hands\r\nwhich were as clean as those of any gentleman, and applied soft linen\r\nrags, lint, and other dressings. To-day we know that these apparently\r\nclean instruments, hands, and dressings are covered with bacteria,\r\nwhich produce infection, and, therefore, suppuration, and frequently\r\nrun riot in blood-poisoning, erysipelas, lockjaw, and death.\r\n\r\nHow does a modern surgeon perform an operation? All bacteria can be\r\nkilled by heat. Cold has no effect upon them, but the temperature of\r\nboiling water (212° Fahr.) is sufficient to destroy them all usually\r\nwithin fifteen or twenty minutes; hence, first, instruments are all\r\nboiled; and, secondly, dressings are either steeped in such solutions\r\nas have been found to destroy the bacteria, such as carbolic acid or\r\ncorrosive sublimate, or other preparations, or, still better, are\r\nplaced in sterilizers, that is to say, metal cylinders, which are\r\nthen filled with steam, usually under pressure, so as to obtain a\r\ntemperature of 240° Fahr., and thus make sure of the death of the\r\nbacteria. Unfortunately, our hands cannot be boiled or steamed, but\r\nthe modern surgeon first uses soap and water most vigorously over\r\nhis hands and arms up to the elbow. The nails are cut short and the\r\nscrubbing-brush is especially applied to the nails so as to clean the\r\nfingers at the ends. Then by various means, such as pure alcohol, which\r\nis one of our best disinfectants, or solutions of corrosive sublimate,\r\nand other means too technical to mention, the hands are sterilized.\r\nRubber gloves are frequently used, so as to preclude infection, as they\r\ncan be steamed to 240° Fahr. Removing at least his outer clothing, the\r\nsurgeon puts on a cotton gown which has been steamed and so made free\r\nfrom bacteria. Not a few surgeons also wear sterilized caps, so that\r\nany bacteria in the hair will not be sifted into a wound, and some wear\r\nrespirators of sterile gauze over the mouth and beard for the same\r\nreason. All the dressings have been sterilized by superheated steam.\r\nAll the threads by which blood-vessels are tied have been either boiled\r\nor otherwise sterilized. All the material for sewing up the wounds, and\r\nthe needles with which they are sewn, have been similarly disinfected.\r\nThe skin of the patient is also sterilized, usually the day beforehand,\r\nin the same manner in which the surgeon’s hands have been disinfected,\r\nand are disinfected a second time just at the moment of the operation.\r\nIf the case is one of accident, such as a crushed leg from a\r\ntrolley-car, all of the dirt is most carefully washed away with soap\r\nand water, and the parts are disinfected, not only on the exterior, but\r\nalso by prolonged washing with some cleansing agent in the interior of\r\nthe wound, the patient being under the influence of ether, of course.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen from such a description of a modern operation that no\r\ncase can receive due care in one of our modern homes, even the best.\r\nThe facilities do not exist, and hence surgeons are more and more\r\ndeclining to do operations, whether for accident or disease, in private\r\nhouses, except in a case of absolute necessity, and a happy custom\r\nis growing more and more in favor with the community of having all\r\noperations and all accidents cared for in a well-equipped hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF MODERN SURGERY\r\n\r\nAs the result of our ability to perform operations without pain, thanks\r\nto anæsthesia, and our ability to perform operations without infection,\r\nand, therefore, almost without danger, thanks to antisepsis, the range\r\nof modern surgery has been enormously increased. Unless one has lived\r\nthrough the old surgery and into the new he scarcely can appreciate\r\nthis widening of the field of operative surgery. Thirty years ago, in\r\nconsequence of the great danger of opening the head, the chest, or the\r\nabdomen, or, in fact, of making an incision anywhere about the body,\r\nthe surgeon never dared to interfere until he was obliged to do so.\r\nHence, not only were many modern operations not even thought of, but in\r\nobscure cases we had to wait until time and disease developed symptoms\r\nand physical signs such that we were sure of our diagnosis, and then,\r\nknowing that death would follow if we did not interfere, we ventured\r\nto operate. Now we anticipate such a fatal termination, and in most\r\ncases can avert it. In perhaps no class of cases has the benefit of\r\nthis immunity from infection and danger been shown than in the obscure\r\ndiseases of the brain and the abdomen. To-day, if we are uncertain as\r\nto whether there is serious danger going on which, if unchecked, will\r\nresult in death, we deliberately open the one cavity or the other,\r\nin order to find out the exact state of affairs. Supposing that the\r\nmischief is trifling, or even that there is no mischief, we then know\r\nhow to deal with the symptoms which have been puzzling us. So far as\r\nthe exploratory operation is concerned, the patient recovers from it\r\nin a short time, and, meantime, perhaps has also been cured of the\r\nsymptoms which were before so ill understood. If any serious disease\r\nis found, in the majority of cases we can cope with it successfully.\r\nBefore the days of antisepsis and anæsthesia the field of operation was\r\ngreatly restricted, and practically the removal of tumors, amputations,\r\nand a few other operations were all that were done. Now all the then\r\ninaccessible organs are attacked with an intrepidity born of an\r\nassurance of safety. Recovery usually sets the seal of approval on\r\nthe judgment of the surgeon. Thirty years ago, taking all operations\r\ntogether, fully one-third of our patients died, many of them often from\r\nslight operations which were followed by infection. To-day, including\r\neven the far more grave operations which are now done, the general\r\nmortality will scarcely exceed five per cent., and many surgeons are\r\nable, in a series of several hundred operations, to save ninety-seven\r\nout of every hundred patients!\r\n\r\n\r\nSERUM TREATMENT\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable recent discovery, the result of numerous and careful\r\ninvestigations in the laboratory, is a wholly new means of treatment,\r\nviz., that method which is known as orrhotherapy, or serumtherapy,\r\nor the treatment by injecting certain antitoxins under the skin by\r\na hypodermatic syringe. It would lead me too far to enter into the\r\ntheory upon which these were first used. Suffice it to say that in\r\nthe blood of an animal that has passed through a certain disorder\r\nthe liquid part of the blood contains an antidote or antitoxin. If a\r\ncertain amount of this is injected under the skin of an animal or man\r\nsuffering from the same disorder in its incipient stages, the antitoxin\r\nprevents the development of the disease. The use of this method has\r\nthus far been much more medical than surgical, and its results in\r\ndiphtheria and other medical disorders have been perfectly marvellous.\r\nIn surgery, however, less favorable results have been obtained, but in\r\nall probability in the future we shall be able to do for some of our\r\nsurgical disorders what the physician can do to-day for diphtheria.\r\n[For the results in diphtheria, see Professor Osler’s paper.]\r\n\r\nThere has also been discovered another means which in surgery has\r\nrendered some valuable service. From certain organs, as, for instance,\r\nthe thyroid gland (the gland whose enlargement produces goitre), we can\r\nobtain a very potent extract of great value. In cases of goitre very\r\nnoteworthy results have already been obtained by the administration\r\nof the thyroid extract. A number of other organs in the body of\r\nanimals have been used to combat certain disorders in the human body\r\nwith advantage. The chief development of both of these new forms of\r\nmedication, however, will take place in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION\r\n\r\nAnother direction in which the century has seen enormous progress is\r\nin the introduction of instruments of precision. When I was a student\r\nin the early 60’s, instruction in microscopy was conspicuous only\r\nby its absence from our medical curriculum. Now every student who\r\ngraduates is more or less of an accomplished microscopist, and carries\r\ninto his practice the methods and observations which the microscope\r\nfurnishes. At the same period I remember being greatly interested in a\r\ndiscussion which two of my teachers had as to whether it was possible\r\nto make an application accurately to the vocal chords in the larynx.\r\nNow every tyro in medicine makes such applications to the larynx as a\r\nroutine procedure in cases requiring it, and similar methods have been\r\napplied by the ophthalmoscope to examine the interior of the eye; the\r\nrhinoscope, to examine the interior of the nose; the otoscope, for\r\nexamination of the ear; and other similar instruments for examining all\r\nthe other hollow organs in the body. If I add to these the hypodermatic\r\nsyringe; the aspirator, which may be described as a large hypodermatic\r\nsyringe for suction instead of injection; the clinical thermometer,\r\nwhich was introduced in the late 60’s; the hemostatic forceps, for\r\ncontrolling hemorrhage by seizing the blood-vessels and clamping them\r\ntill we have time to tie them; and other instruments intended to\r\nfacilitate our operative methods, it will be seen at once that the\r\narmamentarium of the modern surgeon is very different from that of his\r\npredecessor at the beginning, or even at the middle, of the century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RÖNTGEN RAY\r\n\r\nOne of those extraordinary discoveries which startle the whole world\r\ncame nearly at the end of the nineteenth century, in the winter of\r\n1895–96. At that time a modest professor in the University of Würzburg\r\nannounced that he could readily see the skeleton inside the body\r\nthrough the flesh! Naturally, the first announcement was received with\r\nalmost absolute incredulity; but very soon his discovery was confirmed\r\nfrom all sides, and it has now taken its place among the recognized\r\nphenomena of science. By means of certain rays, which, being of unknown\r\nnature, were called “X”-rays, after the well-known mathematical X, or\r\nunknown quantity, Professor Röntgen has shown us that not only can the\r\nbones be seen, but that almost every substance in the body can be seen\r\nand reproduced in pictures. The reason for this is because they are\r\nall obstacles to the passage of these X-rays and so produce shadows\r\non a sensitized photographic plate. If the exposure is sufficiently\r\nprolonged the rays penetrate even through the bones and act upon the\r\nphotographic plate, so that no shadow remains. If the rays are allowed\r\nto penetrate for a shorter time the bones show dense shadows, and one\r\ncan get a light shadow of the soft parts. If the exposure is still\r\nshorter, then we can recognize the dense shadow of the bone, the much\r\nless dense shadows of the muscles, and the still lighter shadows of\r\nthe layer of fat immediately under the skin. The heart can be seen\r\nbeating, and its shadow is now a well-recognized feature in skiagraphs\r\nof the chest. At first it was thought impossible to discover anything\r\ninside the bony skull, but there are now on record nearly a score of\r\ninstances in which bullets have been detected within the skull, and\r\nafter trephining have been found and removed exactly at the location\r\nindicated. It is a very common thing now to locate a piece of steel\r\nor other similar foreign bodies within the eyeball by the method of\r\nDr. Sweet, or some similar method, within one or two millimetres (a\r\nmillimetre is one-twenty-fifth of an inch). It is now well recognized\r\nthat even stones in the kidney will throw shadows sufficiently strong\r\nfor them to be recognized, and by noting their level in relation to\r\nthe vertebræ we can tell precisely in what part of the kidney to make\r\nthe incision in order to find and remove them. It has happened to\r\nmyself and many other surgeons in the past to cut down upon a kidney,\r\nbelieving that there was a stone in the kidney, only to find that we\r\nhad been misled by the apparently clear symptoms of such a foreign\r\nbody. In future no such mistake should be made by any surgeon within\r\nreach of a skilful skiagrapher. Unfortunately, gall stones and numerous\r\nother foreign bodies, vegetable substances such as beans, corn, wood,\r\netc., being as transparent to the X-rays as are the soft parts, are not\r\nrevealed by means of this new method of investigation; but cavities\r\nin the lung, abscesses in bone, and similar diseases which produce\r\nthinning of the lung, bone, and other such organs, and so lighten\r\ninstead of deepen the shadows, can now be recognized by means of light\r\nspots in the pictures as well as others by means of a shadow.\r\n\r\nI spoke a moment ago of the need of a “skilful” skiagrapher, for\r\nit must be remembered that there may be the same difference in the\r\npersonal skill, and, therefore, in the reliability of the results in\r\nskiagraphy as there is in photography. A poor photographer will get\r\nvery different results from a skilful one, even if he uses precisely\r\nthe same quality of plates and precisely the same camera. Personal\r\nskill and experience in the skiagrapher is, therefore, one of the most\r\nimportant elements in success. It must be remembered also that the\r\nX-rays in not a few cases may mislead us. I have, personally, fractured\r\na bone on account of deformity, taken an X-ray picture immediately\r\nafter the operation, the picture showing not the slightest evidence\r\nof a fracture, which I absolutely knew existed. Moreover, foreign\r\nbodies found on the outside of the person may mislead us, as, for\r\nexample, the metal part of suspenders, a coin in one’s pocket, and\r\nsuch like. They look in the picture as if they were inside rather than\r\noutside the body, and any article the shape or size of which would not\r\nreveal its nature might easily be mistaken for a foreign body within\r\nthe patient. Therefore, in many cases only an expert can determine\r\nprecisely what the skiagraph means. I especially mention this, because\r\nthere is a tendency at present to utilize skiagraphs in court in\r\norder to convince the jury that such a picture is an evidence of\r\nmalpractice. Such pictures always need an interpreter in order to judge\r\ncorrectly of their meaning. It is precisely as if the jury were asked\r\nto look through a microscope. I have been myself accustomed to use the\r\nmicroscope for thirty years, but there are many instances even yet in\r\nwhich I am obliged to ask a pathologist or bacteriologist what I really\r\nam looking at in the microscope. While one may make a mistake of small\r\nmoment in some cases, yet if a man’s life or liberty or purse is at\r\nthe mercy of a jury which does not know how to interpret a skiagraph,\r\nand, may, therefore, give a verdict which is “precisely wrong,” as\r\nProfessor Lincoln, my old teacher of Latin, used to call many of our\r\ntranslations, it will be a very serious matter and lead to gross\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY AND VILLAGE HOSPITALS\r\n\r\nAnother great improvement in our means of caring for our surgical\r\npatients is the establishment of hospitals all over the land. These,\r\nhappily, are not limited to our great cities, but in every country town\r\nand not a few large villages small but well-equipped and well-managed\r\nhospitals have been established which have done incalculable good. It\r\nis not too much to say that every city or town establishing such a\r\nhospital is repaid a hundredfold.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINED NURSES\r\n\r\nThe trained nurse has fortunately come to stay. In fact, our antiseptic\r\nmethods as above described have made the trained nurse indispensable.\r\nThe old nurse, who, by many clumsy experiments on her patients,\r\nhad obtained a certain rule-of-thumb knowledge of the care of the\r\nsick, can no longer assist in a surgical operation or properly care\r\nfor any surgical patient. The modern nurse must of necessity be a\r\nwell-educated, well-trained woman, knowing thoroughly modern antiseptic\r\nmethods, and on the alert to observe every symptom of improvement and\r\nevery signal of danger.\r\n\r\nWithout a well-trained nurse it is impossible at the present day\r\nproperly to care for any serious surgical case, and I gladly bear\r\nwitness to the intelligence, fidelity, and skill of scores of nurses\r\nwho have assisted me, and without whom I should have felt as one blade\r\nof a scissors without its fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n_Amputations and Compound Fractures._—Having now traced the different\r\nmodes of thought which have aided surgical progress in the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the improved means of investigation, let us turn finally to\r\nthe progress in individual operations. As to amputations and compound\r\nfractures, I have already indicated the immense improvements which have\r\nfollowed the introduction of anæsthesia, and especially of antisepsis,\r\nwhich have brought the mortality of amputations down from fifty or\r\nsixty per cent. to ten or fifteen per cent., and in compound fractures,\r\nonce so dreaded, since the mortality was not infrequently as high as\r\ntwo out of three, to a relatively insignificant danger.\r\n\r\n_Tumors._—In no department, perhaps, has the introduction of\r\nantisepsis, and the use of catgut and silk ligatures after the\r\nantiseptic method, brought about a greater improvement than in\r\noperations for tumors. The startling reluctance of Sir Astley Cooper\r\nto operate on King George IV. for so simple and small a tumor as a\r\nwen, lest erysipelas might follow and even destroy his life, is in\r\nmarked contrast with the success and therefore the boldness of modern\r\nsurgeons. Tumors in all parts of the body, whether they be external or\r\ninternal, whether they involve the wall of the chest or are inside the\r\nabdomen, are now removed with almost perfect safety. Anæsthesia has\r\nmade it possible to dissect out tumors in so dangerous a region as the\r\nneck, where the surgeon is confronted with adhesions to the jugular\r\nvein, the carotid artery, and the nerves of the neck and of the arm,\r\nwith the greatest impunity. Such an operation not uncommonly lasts from\r\nthree-quarters of an hour to an hour and a half, and involves often\r\nthe removal of two or three inches of the jugular vein and many of the\r\nlarge nerves, the removal of which a few years ago would have been\r\ndeemed an impossibility.\r\n\r\n_Goitre._—One of the most striking instances of progress is operations\r\non goitre. Writing in 1876, the late Professor Samuel D. Gross noted it\r\nas something remarkable that Dr. Green, of Portland, Maine, had removed\r\nseven goitres with two deaths, and the late Dr. Maury, of Philadelphia,\r\nhad extirpated two goitres with one death. In marked contrast to this\r\nProfessor Kocher, of Berne, in 1895, reported one thousand cases, of\r\nwhich eight hundred and seventy were non-cancerous, and he lost of\r\nthese last but eleven cases, or a little over one per cent. In 1898 he\r\nreported six hundred additional cases, with only one death in the five\r\nhundred and fifty-six non-cancerous cases, or a mortality of only 0.1\r\nper cent. It will be seen, therefore, that an operation which a few\r\nyears ago was excessively fatal has become almost, one might say, a\r\nperfectly safe operation.\r\n\r\n_Surgery of the Bones._—Operations on bones, apart from amputations,\r\nshow also a similar improvement. In cases of deformity following\r\nfracture we now do not hesitate to cut down upon the bone and\r\nrefracture it or remove the deformed portion, join the ends together,\r\ndress the part in plaster of Paris to secure fixation, and have the\r\npatient recover with little or no fever and no suppuration. Above the\r\nelbow a large nerve runs in a furrow in the arm bone, and in case of\r\nfracture this is liable to be torn and a portion of it destroyed. The\r\nresult of it is paralysis of all the muscles on the back of the forearm\r\nfrom the elbow down and consequent inability to extend either wrist or\r\nfingers, making the hand almost useless. In a number of cases the nerve\r\nhas been sought for and found, but the ends have been too far apart\r\nfor successful union and sewing them together. In such cases we do not\r\nhesitate now, in order to bring the two ends of the nerve together,\r\nto remove one or two inches of the arm bone, wire the shortened\r\nbone, sew the now approximated ends of the nerve together, put the\r\narm in plaster, and as soon as the wound is healed, with appropriate\r\nlater treatment to the muscles we can obtain in a reasonable number\r\nof cases a perfect, or almost perfect, union of the nerves with a\r\nre-establishment of the usefulness of the hand.\r\n\r\nIn very many cases the bones are deformed as a result of rickets, and\r\nin some cases in consequence of hip-joint disease. In such cases the\r\nleg is crooked or flexed, and cannot be used for walking. Such cases\r\nof stiff joints and crooked legs are now operated on, one might say,\r\nwholesale. At the International Medical Congress, held in Copenhagen in\r\n1884, Professor Macewen, of Glasgow, reported 1800 operations on 1267\r\nlimbs in 704 patients, in which he had sawn or chiselled through the\r\nbones so as to fracture them, placed them in a straight position, and\r\nafter a few weeks the bone has become consolidated and the leg or arm\r\nmade straight. Every one of these operations was successful, excepting\r\nfive cases, and even these deaths were not due to the operation, but\r\nto some other disorder, such as an unexpected attack of pneumonia,\r\ndiphtheria, or scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n_Surgery of the Head and Brain._—In the surgery of the head we find\r\none of the most remarkable illustrations of the modern progress of\r\nsurgery. Fractures of the skull have been the most dangerous and fatal\r\nof accidents until within a short time. Of course, many of them must\r\nnecessarily, even now, be fatal, from the widespread injury to the\r\nbones and the brain. But our modern methods, by which we can disinfect\r\nthe cavities of the ear, the nose, and the mouth, with which these\r\nfractures often communicate, and through these avenues become infected,\r\nare so successful that such cases, instead of being looked upon as\r\nhopeless, are in a majority of instances followed by recovery. Even\r\ngun-shot wounds, in which the ball may remain inside the cavity of the\r\nhead, are successfully dealt with, unless the injury produced by the\r\nball has been necessarily fatal from the start. Fluhrer, of New York,\r\nhas reported a very remarkable case of gun-shot wound, in which the\r\nball entered at the forehead, traversed the entire brain, was deflected\r\nat the back of the skull, and then pursued its course farther downward\r\nin the brain. By trephining the skull at the back he found the ball,\r\npassed a rubber drainage tube through the entire brain from front to\r\nback, and had the satisfaction of seeing the patient recover.\r\n\r\nUntil 1884 it was excessively difficult to locate with any degree\r\nof accuracy a tumor within the brain, but in that year Dr. Bennett,\r\nof London, for the first time accurately located a tumor within the\r\nskull without there being the slightest evidence on the exterior of\r\nits existence, much less of its location. Mr. Godlee (surgeons in\r\nEngland are not called “Dr.,” but “Mr.”) trephined the skull at the\r\npoint indicated, found the tumor, and removed it. True, this patient\r\ndied, but the possibility of accurately locating a tumor of the\r\nbrain, reaching it and removing it, was now demonstrated, which is\r\nfar more important to humanity at large than whether this individual\r\npatient survived or not. Since then there have been a very large\r\nnumber of tumors successfully removed. The latest statistics are those\r\nof Von Bergmann, of Berlin, in 1898. He collected 273 operations for\r\nbrain tumors, of which 169 (61.9 per cent.) recovered, and 104 (38.1\r\nper cent.) died. This is by far the best percentage of results so\r\nfar reported, but there is reason to believe that with the constant\r\nimprovement in our ability to locate such tumors and in our methods of\r\nremoving them, the mortality rate will be still further lessened.\r\n\r\nEven more successful than the surgery of brain tumors has been the\r\nsurgery of abscess of the brain. I have no available statistics of\r\nthe exact numbers, but it is certain that several hundred have been\r\noperated on, and with even better success than in the case of brain\r\ntumors. The most frequent cause for such abscesses is old and neglected\r\ndisease of the ear. No child suffering from a “running from the ear,”\r\nwhich is especially apt to follow scarlet fever and other similar\r\ndisorders, should be allowed to pass from under the most skilled\r\ntreatment until a cure is effected. This is the commonest cause of\r\nabscess of the brain. The inflammation in the ear, which begins in the\r\nsoft lining of the cavities of the ear, finally extends to the bone,\r\nand after years of intermittent discharge, will suddenly develop an\r\nabscess of the brain, which, if not relieved, will certainly be fatal.\r\nPrompt surgical interference alone can save life, and, happily, though\r\nwe cannot promise recovery in all, a very large percentage of success\r\nis assured.\r\n\r\nIn epilepsy, as a result of injuries of the head, in a moderate number\r\nof cases, we can obtain a cure of the disease by operation, but in the\r\ngreat majority of cases, and, one may say, practically in all of the\r\ncases in which the epilepsy originates “of itself,” that is to say,\r\nwithout any known cause, it is useless to operate, certainly at least\r\nafter the epileptic habit has been formed. Possibly were operation done\r\nat the very beginning we might obtain better results than experience\r\nthus far has shown us is possible.\r\n\r\nVery many cases of idiocy are constantly brought to surgeons in\r\nthe hope that something can be done for these lamentable children.\r\nUnfortunately, at present surgery holds out but little hope in such\r\ncases. In a few exceptional instances it may be best to operate, but a\r\nprudent surgeon will decline to do any operation in the vast majority\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\n_Surgery of the Chest and Heart._—The chest is the region of the\r\nbody which has shown the least progress of all, and yet even here\r\nthe progress is very marked. When, as a result of pleurisy, fluid\r\naccumulates on one side of the chest, even displacing the heart, we\r\nnow do not hesitate to remove an inch or two of one or more ribs and\r\nthoroughly drain the cavity, with not only a reasonable, but in a\r\nmajority of cases, one may almost say, a certain, prospect of cure.\r\nWe have also entered upon the road which will lead us in time to a\r\nsecure surgery of the lung itself. A few cases of abscess, of serious\r\ngun-shot wound, attended by otherwise fatal hemorrhage, and even of\r\ntubercular cavities in the lungs have been successfully dealt with, but\r\nthe twentieth century will see, I have no doubt, brilliant results in\r\nthoracic surgery.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking injuries of the chest has recently assumed a\r\nnew importance, viz., wounds of the heart itself. In several instances\r\nan opening has been made in the bony and muscular walls of the chest,\r\nand a wound of the heart itself has been sewed up. The number is as\r\nyet small, but there have been several recoveries, which lead us to\r\nbelieve that here, too, the limits of surgery have by no means been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n_Surgery of the Abdomen._—Of the abdomen and the pelvis a very\r\ndifferent story can be told. These cavities might almost be called the\r\nplayground of the surgeon, and the remarkable results which have been\r\nobtained warrant us in believing that even greater results are in store\r\nfor us in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of this article I spoke of the advantages of\r\nthe study of the pathological anatomy or the diseased condition of\r\nindividual organs. Perhaps no better illustration of the value of\r\nthis can be given than in the studies of appendicitis. This operation\r\nhas been one of the contributions to the surgery of the world in\r\nwhich America has been foremost. While there were one or two earlier\r\npapers, Willard Parker, of New York, in 1867, first made the profession\r\nlisten to him when he urged that abscesses appearing above the right\r\ngroin should be operated on and the patient’s life saved. But it was\r\nnot until Fitz, of Boston, in 1888, published his paper, in which\r\nhe pointed out, as a result of a study of a series of post-mortem\r\nexaminations of persons dying from such an abscess above the right\r\ngroin, that the appendix was the seat of the trouble, that this so\r\nfrequent disease was rightly understood and rightly treated.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the facts gathered in his paper, the treatment was\r\nperfectly clear, not only that we ought to operate in cases of abscess,\r\nbut that in the case of patients suffering from two or more attacks,\r\nand often from even one attack of appendicitis, the appendix should be\r\nremoved to prevent such abscess.\r\n\r\nThe mortality in cases in which such an abscess has formed is, perhaps,\r\nquite twenty or twenty-five per cent., whereas, if patients are\r\noperated on “in the interval,” that is to say, between attacks, when\r\nthe abdominal cavity is free from pus, the mortality is scarcely more\r\nthan two or three per cent., and may be even less than that.\r\n\r\nSurgeons are often asked whether appendicitis is not a fad, and whether\r\nour grandfathers ever had appendicitis, etc. As a matter of fact, in\r\nmy early professional days, appendicitis was well known. It was called\r\n“localized peritonitis” or localized “abscess,” but while the disease\r\nwas very frequent, its relation to the appendix was not recognized\r\nuntil from his study of its pathology an American pointed it out. Even\r\nnow European surgeons, with a few exceptions, are not alive to the need\r\nfor operation in such cases.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the great prevalence of grippe during the\r\nlast few years has increased the number of cases of appendicitis,\r\nboth of them being catarrhal conditions of the lining membrane of the\r\nsame continuous tract of the lungs, the mouth, the stomach, and the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fatal accidents that can befall a patient is to have\r\nan ulcer of the stomach perforate so that the contents of the stomach\r\nescape into the general abdominal cavity. Until 1885 no one ventured\r\nto operate in such a case. In an inaugural dissertation by Tinker, of\r\nPhiladelphia, two hundred and thirty-two cases of such perforating\r\nulcers of the stomach were reported, of which one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three recovered, a mortality of 48.81 per cent. In not a few of\r\nthem, if prompt instead of late surgical help had been invoked, a very\r\ndifferent result would have been reported. If no operation had been\r\ndone, the mortality would have been one hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nIn cancer of the stomach itself we are able, as a rule, to make a\r\npositive diagnosis only when a perceptible tumor is found. By that\r\ntime so many adhesions have formed, and the infection has involved the\r\nneighboring glands to such an extent, that it is impossible to remove\r\nthe tumor, but the statistics even here are not without encouragement,\r\nat least for comfort if not for life. In many cases the tumor has\r\nbeen removed and the stomach and intestine joined together by various\r\ndevices, and the mortality, which is necessarily great, has been\r\nreduced by Czerny to twelve per cent. and by Carle to seven per cent.\r\nEven the entire stomach has been removed in several cases, and recovery\r\nhas followed in about one-half. Most of these patients, however, have\r\ndied from a return of the disease.\r\n\r\nWhen, as a result of swallowing caustic lye or other similar\r\nsubstances, the gullet (the œsophagus) becomes contracted to such an\r\nextent that no food can be swallowed, we now establish an opening into\r\nthe stomach through which a tube is inserted at meal-time, and the\r\npatient has his breakfast, dinner, and supper poured into his stomach\r\nthrough the tube. If the stricture of the œsophagus is from malignant\r\ndisease, of course this only prolongs life by preventing a horrible\r\ndeath by starvation, but in cases in which it is non-malignant life\r\nis indefinitely prolonged. The mortality of such an operation is very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nBy a freak of nature or by disease the stomach sometimes is narrowed\r\nin the middle, forming what is called an “hour-glass stomach.” In such\r\na case we open the abdomen, make an opening into the two parts of the\r\nstomach and unite the two so that we re-establish the single cavity\r\nof the stomach. The mortality of the operation is very slight, eight\r\nper cent. Again, sometimes the stomach becomes unduly dilated, thus\r\ninterfering seriously with its function. A number of surgeons in such\r\ncases have simply folded over the wall of the stomach upon itself and\r\nhave sewed the two layers together, taking a plait or “tuck” in the\r\nstomach wall, and have restored it to its normal capacity and function.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important advances has been made in the treatment\r\nof gall stones. The bile in the gall bladder is in a state of\r\nquiescence, which is favorable to a deposit of crystals from the bile.\r\nThese crystals become agglutinated together into larger or smaller\r\nsolid masses called gall stones. Sometimes the number of these is\r\nvery small, from one to four or five; sometimes they accumulate in\r\nenormous numbers, several hundreds having been reported in a number of\r\ninstances. When they are small they can escape through the duct of the\r\ngall bladder into the bowel and create no disturbance, but when they\r\nare large, so that they cannot make their escape, they not uncommonly\r\nare causes not only of serious discomfort and prolonged ill-health, but\r\noften prove fatal. Nowadays one of the safest operations of surgery\r\nis to open the abdomen and the gall bladder and remove this menace\r\nto life, and the great majority of such patients recover without any\r\nuntoward symptoms. Even large abscesses of the liver, and, what is\r\nstill more extraordinary, large tumors of the liver, are now removed\r\nsuccessfully. A year ago all of the reported cases of tumor of the\r\nliver were collected which had been operated from 1888 to 1898,\r\nseventy-six in all. The termination in two cases was unknown, but\r\nof the other seventy-four, sixty-three recovered and eleven died, a\r\nmortality of only 14.9 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe surgery of the intestines by itself is a subject which could well\r\noccupy the entire space allowed to this article. I can only, in a very\r\nsuperficial way, outline what has been done. Hernia or rupture is a\r\ncondition in which through an opening in the abdominal wall a loop of\r\nthe bowel escapes. If it can be replaced and kept within the abdomen\r\nby a suitable truss this was the best we could do till within the\r\nlast ten or fifteen years. The safety and the painlessness of modern\r\nsurgery which have resulted from the introduction of anæsthesia and\r\nantisepsis are such that now no person suffering from such a hernia,\r\nunless for some special personal reason, should be allowed to rely upon\r\na truss, which is always a more or less treacherous means of retaining\r\nthe hernia. We operate on all such cases now with impunity. Coley has\r\nrecently reported a series of six hundred and thirty-nine cases, all of\r\nwhich recovered with the exception of one patient. Even in children,\r\nif a truss worn for a reasonable time, a year or so, does not cure the\r\nrupture, operation affords an admirable prospect of cure.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then a band forms inside the abdomen, stretching like\r\na string across the cavity. If a loop of bowel slips under such a\r\nband, it can be easily understood that total arrest of the intestinal\r\ncontents ensues, a condition incompatible with life. There are other\r\ncauses for such “intestinal obstruction,” which are too technical to\r\nbe described in detail, but this may be taken as a type of all. It is\r\nimpossible, of course, to tell before opening the abdomen precisely\r\nthe cause of the obstruction, but the fact is quickly determined in\r\nmost cases. If we open the abdomen promptly, we can cut such a band or\r\nremove the other causes of obstruction in the majority of cases, and\r\nif the operation has not been too long delayed, the prospect of entire\r\nrecovery is good. The mortality which has followed such operations has\r\nbeen considerable, and by that I mean, say, over twenty per cent.,\r\nbut a very large number of the fatal cases have been lost because the\r\noperation has been delayed. In fact, it may be stated very positively\r\nthat the mere opening of the abdomen to find out precisely the nature\r\nof any disease or injury is attended with but little danger. If further\r\nsurgical interference is required, the danger will be increased\r\nproportionately to the extent and gravity of such interference.\r\nBut “exploratory operations,” as we call them, are now undertaken\r\nconstantly with almost uniform success.\r\n\r\nEven in cancer of the bowel, we can prolong life, if we cannot save\r\nit. Cancer of the bowel sooner or later produces “obstruction” and\r\nso destroys life, but in such cases we can either make a permanent\r\nopening in the bowel above the cancer, and so relieve the constant pain\r\nand distress which is caused by the obstruction, or, in a great many\r\ncases, we make an opening in the bowel above the cancer, and another\r\nbelow it, and, by uniting the two openings, if I may so express it,\r\n“side-track” the contents of the bowel. If the cancer has no adhesions\r\nand the patient’s condition allows of it, we can cut out the entire\r\nportion of the bowel containing the cancer, unite the two ends, and\r\nthus re-establish the continuity of the intestinal canal. As much as\r\neight feet, nearly one-third of the entire length of the bowel, have\r\nbeen removed by Shepherd, of Montreal, and yet the patient recovered\r\nand lived a healthy life.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in gun-shot wounds, stab wounds, etc., involving the\r\nintestine, the modern surgeon does not simply stand by with folded\r\nhands and give opium and morphine to make the patient’s last few hours\r\nor days relatively comfortable, but he opens the abdomen, finds the\r\nvarious perforations, closes them, and recovery has followed even in\r\ncases in which as many as seventeen wounds of the intestine have been\r\nproduced by a gun-shot wound.\r\n\r\nThe kidney, until thirty years ago, was deemed almost beyond our\r\nreach, but now entire volumes have been written on the surgery of the\r\nkidney, and it is, one might say, a frequent occurrence to see the\r\nkidney exposed, sewed fast if it is loose, opened to remove a stone in\r\nits interior, drained if there be an abscess, or, if it be hopelessly\r\ndiseased, it is removed in its entirety. The other kidney, if not\r\ndiseased, becomes equal to the work of both.\r\n\r\nOf the pelvic organs, it would not be becoming to speak in detail,\r\nbut one operation I can scarcely omit: namely, ovariotomy. One of my\r\nold teachers was Washington L. Atlee, who, with his brother, was among\r\nthe first ovariotomists in this country who placed the operation on\r\na firm foundation. I heard a very distinguished physician in 1862,\r\nin a lecture to his medical class, denounce such men as “murderers”;\r\nbut to-day how differently does the entire profession look upon the\r\noperation! Instead of condemning the surgeon because he did remove such\r\na tumor, the profession would condemn him because he did not remove it.\r\nThe operation had its rise in America. Ephraim McDowell, of Kentucky,\r\nin 1809, first did the operation which now reflects so much credit upon\r\nmodern surgery. The mortality of the Atlees was about one in three.\r\nNow, owing to the immense improvement introduced by the antiseptic\r\nmethods, the deaths, in competent hands, are not over five per cent.,\r\nor even three per cent.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this article compel me to stop with the story very\r\nimperfectly told, but yet, perhaps, it has been sufficient in detail\r\nto show somewhat of the astonishing progress of surgery within the\r\ncentury, but especially within the last quarter of the century.\r\n\r\nAbout two decades ago one of the foremost surgeons of London, Mr.\r\nErichsen, said, in a public address, that “surgery had reached its\r\nlimits.” How short was his vision is shown by the fact that surgery\r\nat that time was just at the beginning of its most brilliant modern\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWe have reached, in many respects, apparently, the limits of our\r\nsuccess, but just as anæsthesia and antisepsis and the Röntgen rays\r\nhave opened new fields wholly unsuspected until they were proclaimed,\r\nso I have no doubt that the twentieth century will see means and\r\nmethods devised which will put to shame the surgery of to-day as much\r\nas the surgery of to-day puts to shame that of thirty years ago,\r\nand still more of a century ago. The methods by which this will be\r\nattained will be by the more thorough and systematic study of disease\r\nand injury, so as to better our means of diagnosis, and so prepare\r\nus for immediate surgical interference, instead of delaying it, as\r\nwe now do in many cases, for want of certain knowledge; by the use\r\nof new chemical and pharmaceutical means to perfect our antisepsis\r\nand possibly to introduce other methods of treatment; but, above\r\nall, we shall obtain progress by the exact experimental methods of\r\nthe laboratory. We can never make progress except by trying new\r\nmethods. New methods must be tried either on man or on animals, and\r\nas the former is not allowable, the only way remaining to us is to\r\ntest all new methods, drugs, and applications first upon animals.\r\nHe who restricts, and, still more, he who would abolish our present\r\nexperiments upon animals, is, in my opinion, the worst foe to the human\r\nrace, and to animals, as well, for they, as well as human beings,\r\nobtain the benefit derived from the method. He may prate of his\r\nhumanity, but he is the most cruel man alive.\r\n\r\n            W. W. KEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great importance which electricity has attained in many departments\r\nof human activity is so constantly evident that we have difficulty\r\nin realizing how short is the time which has been occupied in its\r\ndevelopment. The latter half of the nineteenth century must ever remain\r\nmemorable, not only for the great advances in nearly all the useful\r\narts, but for the peculiarly rapid electric progress, and the profound\r\neffect which it has had upon the lives and business of the people.\r\nIn the preceding century we find no evidences of the application\r\nof electricity to any useful purpose. Few of the more important\r\nprinciples of the science were then known. Franklin’s invention of\r\nthe lightning-rod was not intended to utilize electric force, but\r\nto guard life and property from the perils of the thunder-storm.\r\nThe numerous instructive experiments in frictional electricity, the\r\nfirst-known form of electric manifestation except lightning, made clear\r\ncertain principles, such as conduction and insulation, and served to\r\ndistinguish the two opposite electric conditions known as positive\r\nand negative. Franklin’s kite experiment confirmed the long-suspected\r\nidentity of lightning and electric sparks. It was not, however, until\r\nthe discovery by Alexander Volta, in 1799, of his pile, or battery,\r\nthat electricity could take its place as an agent of practical value.\r\nVolta, when he made this great discovery, was following the work of\r\nGalvani, begun in 1786. But Galvani in his experiments mistook the\r\neffect for the cause, and so missed making the unique demonstration\r\nthat two different metals immersed in a solution could set up an\r\nelectric current. Volta, a professor in the University of Pavia and\r\na foreign member of the Royal Society of England, communicated his\r\ndiscovery to the president of the society in March, 1800, and brought\r\nto the notice of the world the first means for obtaining a steady flow\r\nof electricity. Before this event electric energy had been known to the\r\nexperimenter in pretty effects of attraction and repulsion of light\r\nobjects, in fitful flashes of insignificant power, or, as it appeared\r\nin nature, in the fearful bursts of energy during a thunder-storm,\r\nuncontrolled and erratic. The analogous and closely related phenomena\r\nof magnetism had already found an important application in the\r\nnavigator’s compass.\r\n\r\nThe simplest facts of electro-magnetism, upon which much of the later\r\nelectrical developments depend, remained entirely unknown until near\r\nthe close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Magnetism\r\nitself, as exemplified in loadstone or in magnetized iron or steel, had\r\nlong before been consistently studied by Dr. Gilbert, of Colchester,\r\nEngland, and in 1600 his great work, _De Magnete_, was published. It\r\nis a first example, and an excellent one, too, of the application\r\nof the inductive method, so fruitful in after-years. The restraints\r\nwhich a superstitious age had imposed upon nature study were gradually\r\nremoved, and at the beginning of the century just past occasional\r\ndecided encouragement began to be given to physical research. It was\r\nthis condition which put into the hands of Humphry Davy, of the Royal\r\nInstitution, in London, at the opening of the century, a voltaic\r\nbattery of some 250 pairs of plates. With this a remarkably fruitful\r\nera of electric discovery began. In 1802 Davy first showed the electric\r\narc or “arch” on a small scale between pieces of carbon. He also\r\nlaid the foundation for future electro-chemical work by decomposing\r\nby the battery current potash and soda, and thus isolating the alkali\r\nmetals, potassium and sodium, for the first time. This was in 1807,\r\nand the result was not only to greatly advance the youthful science of\r\nchemistry, but to attract the attention of the world to a new power\r\nin the hands of the scientific worker, electric current. A fund was\r\nsoon subscribed by “a few zealous cultivators and patrons of science,”\r\ninterested in the discovery of Davy, and he had at his service in 1801\r\nno less than 2000 cells of voltaic battery. With the intense currents\r\nobtained from it he again demonstrated the wonderful and brilliant\r\nphenomenon of the electric arc, by first closing the circuit of the\r\nbattery through terminals of hardwood charcoal and then separating\r\nthem for a short distance. A magnificent arch of flame was maintained\r\nbetween the separated ends, and the light from the charcoal pieces\r\nwas of dazzling splendor. Thus was born into the world the electric\r\narc light, of which there are now many hundreds of thousands burning\r\nnightly in our own country alone.\r\n\r\nDavy probably never imagined that his brilliant experiment would soon\r\nplay so important a part in the future lighting of the world. He may\r\nnever have regarded it as of any practical value. In fact, many years\r\nelapsed before any further attempt was made to utilize the light of\r\nthe electric arc. The reason for this is not difficult to discover.\r\nThe batteries in existence were crude and gave only their full power\r\nfor a very short time after the circuit was closed. They were subject\r\nto the very serious defect of rapid polarization, whereby the activity\r\nwas at once reduced. A long period elapsed before this defect was\r\nremoved. Davy in his experiments had also noted the very intense heat\r\nof the electric arc, and found that but few substances escaped fusion\r\nor volatilization when placed in the heated stream between the carbon\r\nelectrodes. Here again he was pioneer in very important and quite\r\nrecent electric work, employing the electric furnace, which has already\r\ngiven rise to several new and valuable industries.\r\n\r\nThe conduction of electricity along wires naturally led to efforts to\r\nemploy it in signalling. As early as 1774 attempts were made by Le\r\nSage, of Geneva, to apply frictional electricity to telegraphy. His\r\nwork was followed before the close of the century by other similar\r\nproposals. Volta’s discovery soon gave a renewed impetus to these\r\nefforts. It was easy enough to stop and start a current in a line of\r\nwire connecting two points, but something more than that was requisite.\r\nA good receiver, or means for recognizing the presence or absence of\r\ncurrent in the wire or circuit, did not exist. The art had to wait for\r\nthe discovery of the effects of electric current upon magnets and the\r\nproduction of magnetism by such currents. Curiously, even in 1802 the\r\nfact that a wire conveying a current would deflect a compass needle was\r\nobserved by Romagnosi, of Trente, but it was afterwards forgotten, and\r\nnot until 1819 was any real advance made.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Oersted, of Copenhagen, showed that a magnet tends to\r\nset itself at right angles to the wire conveying current and that the\r\ndirection of turning depends on the direction of the current. The study\r\nof the magnetic effects of electric currents by Arago, Ampère, and the\r\nproduction of the electro-magnet by Sturgeon, together with the very\r\nvaluable work of Henry and others, made possible the completion of the\r\nelectric telegraph. This was done by Morse and Vail in America, and\r\nalmost simultaneously by workers abroad, but, before Morse had entered\r\nthe field, Professor Joseph Henry had exemplified by experiments\r\nthe working of electric signalling by electro-magnets over a short\r\nline. It was Henry, in fact, who first made a practically useful\r\nelectro-magnet of soft iron. The history of the electric telegraph\r\nteaches us that to no single individual is the invention due. The Morse\r\nsystem had been demonstrated in 1837, but not until 1844 was the first\r\ntelegraph line built. It connected Baltimore and Washington, and the\r\nfunds for defraying its cost were only obtained from Congress after a\r\nsevere struggle. This can easily be understood, for electricity had not\r\nup to that time ever been shown to have any practical usefulness. The\r\nsuccess of the Morse telegraph was soon followed by the establishment\r\nof telegraph lines as a means of communication between all the large\r\ncities and populous districts. Scarcely ten years elapsed before the\r\npossibility of a transatlantic telegraph was mooted. The cable laid\r\nin 1858 was a failure. A few words passed, and then the cable broke\r\ndown completely. This was found to be due to defects in construction.\r\nA renewed effort to lay a cable was made in 1866, but disappointment\r\nagain followed: the cable broke in mid-ocean and the work again ceased.\r\nThe great task was successfully accomplished in the following year, and\r\nthe pluck and pertinacity of those who were staking their capital, if\r\nnot their reputations for business sagacity, were amply rewarded. Even\r\nthe lost cable of 1866 was found, spliced to a new cable, and completed\r\nsoon after as a second working line. The delicate instruments for the\r\nworking of these long cables were due to the genius of Sir William\r\nThomson, now Lord Kelvin, whose other instruments for electrical\r\nmeasurement have for years been a great factor in securing precision\r\nboth in scientific and practical testing. The number of cables joining\r\nthe Eastern and Western hemispheres has been increased from time to\r\ntime, and the opening of a new cable is now an ordinary occurrence,\r\ncalling for little or no especial note.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the electric telegraph was followed by the\r\ninvention of various signalling systems, the most important being\r\nthe fire-alarm telegraph, as suggested by Channing and worked out\r\nby Farmer. We now, also, have automatic clock systems, in which a\r\nmaster clock controls or gives movement to the hands of distant clock\r\ndials by electric currents sent out over the connecting or circuit\r\nwires. Automatic electric signals are made when fire breaks out in a\r\nbuilding, and alarms are similarly rung when a burglar breaks in. Not\r\nonly do we have telegraphs which print words and characters, as in the\r\nstock “ticker,” but in the form known as the telautograph, invented\r\nby Dr. Elisha Gray, the sender writes his message, which writing is\r\nat the same time being reproduced at the receiving end of the line.\r\nEven pictures for drawings are “wired” by special instruments. The\r\ndesirability of making one wire connecting two points do a large amount\r\nof work, and thus avoiding the addition of new lines, has led to two\r\nremarkable developments of telegraphy. In the duplex, quadruplex, and\r\nmultiplex systems several messages may at the same time be traversing\r\na single wire line without interference one with the other. In the\r\nrapid automatic systems the working capacity of the line is increased\r\nby special automatic transmitting machines and rapid recorders, and the\r\nelectric impulses in the line itself follow each other with great speed.\r\n\r\nImprovement in this field has by no means ceased, and new systems for\r\nrapid transmission are yet being worked out. The object is to enlarge\r\nthe carrying capacity of existing lines connecting large centres of\r\npopulation. The names of Wheatstone, Stearns, Edison, and Delaney are\r\nprominent in connection with this work. For use in telegraphy the\r\noriginally crude forms of voltaic battery, such as Davy used, were\r\nreplaced by the more perfect types such as the constant battery of\r\nDaniell, the nitric-acid battery of Grove, dating from 1836, and the\r\ncarbon battery of Bunsen, first brought out in 1842. Such was the power\r\nof the Grove and Bunsen batteries that attention was again called\r\nto the electric arc and to the possibility of its use for electric\r\nillumination. Accordingly, we find that suggestions were soon made for\r\nelectric-arc lamps, to be operated by these more powerful and constant\r\nsources of electric current. The first example of a working type of\r\nan arc lamp was that brought to notice by W. E. Staite, in 1847, and\r\nhis description of the lamp and the conditions under which it could be\r\nworked is a remarkably exact and full statement, considering the time\r\nof its appearance. Staite even anticipated the most recent phase of\r\ndevelopment in arc lighting, namely, the enclosure of the light in a\r\npartially air-tight globe, to prevent too rapid waste of the carbons\r\nby combustion in the air. In a public address at Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nin 1847, he advocated the use of the arc, so enclosed, in mines,\r\nas obviating the danger of fire. But it was a long time before the\r\nelectric arc acquired any importance as a practical illuminant. There\r\nwas, indeed, no hope of its success so long as the current had to be\r\nobtained from batteries consuming chemicals and zinc. The expense was\r\ntoo great, and the batteries soon became exhausted. In spite of this\r\nfact, occasional exhibitions of arc lighting were made, notably in\r\n1856, by Lacassagne and Thiers, in the streets of Paris.\r\n\r\nFor this service they had invented an arc lamp involving what is known\r\nas the differential principle, afterwards applied so extensively to\r\narc lamps. The length of the arc or the distance between the carbons\r\nof the lamp was controlled with great nicety, and the light thus\r\nrendered very steady. Even as late as 1875 batteries were occasionally\r\nused to work single electric arc lamps for public exhibitions, or for\r\ndemonstration purposes in the scientific departments of schools.\r\nThe discovery of the means of efficiently generating electricity\r\nfrom mechanical power constitutes, however, the key-note of all the\r\nwonderful electrical work of the closing years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It made electrical energy available at low cost. Michael\r\nFaraday, a most worthy successor of Davy at the Royal Institution, in\r\nstudying the relations between electric currents and magnets, made the\r\nexceedingly important observation that a wire, if moved in the field of\r\na magnet, would yield a current of electricity. Simple as the discovery\r\nwas, its effect has been stupendous. Following his science for its own\r\nsake, he unwittingly opened up possibilities of the greatest practical\r\nmoment. The fundamental principle of the future dynamo electric machine\r\nwas discovered by him. This was in 1831. Faraday’s investigations\r\nwere so complete and his deductions so masterly, that little was\r\nleft to be done by others. Electro-magnetism was supplemented by\r\nmagneto-electricity. Both the electric motor and the dynamo generator\r\nwere now potentially present with us. Faraday contented himself with\r\npointing the way, leaving the technical engineer to follow. In one of\r\nFaraday’s experiments a copper disk mounted on an axis passing through\r\nits centre was revolved between the poles of a large steel magnet. A\r\nwire touched the periphery of the disk at a selected position with\r\nrespect to the magnet, and another was in connection with the axis.\r\nThese wires were united through a galvanometer or instrument for\r\ndetecting electric current. A current was noted as present in the\r\ncircuit so long as the disk was turned. Here, then, was the embryo\r\ndynamo. The century closed with single dynamo machines of over 5000\r\nhorse-power capacity, and with single power stations in which the total\r\nelectric generation by such machines is 75,000 to 100,000 horse-power.\r\nSo perfect is the modern dynamo that out of 1000 horse-power expended\r\nin driving it, 950 or more may be delivered to the electric line as\r\nelectric energy. The electric motor, now so common, is a machine like\r\nthe dynamo, in which the principle of action is simply reversed;\r\nelectric energy delivered from the lines becomes again mechanical\r\nmotion or power.\r\n\r\nSoon after Faraday’s discoveries in magneto-electricity attempts\r\nwere made to construct generators of electricity from power. But the\r\nmachines were small, crude, and imperfect, and the results necessarily\r\nmeagre.\r\n\r\nPixii, in Paris, one year after Faraday’s discovery was announced, made\r\na machine which embodied in its construction a simple commutator for\r\ngiving the currents a single direction of flow. This is the prototype\r\nof the commutators now found on what are called continuous-current\r\ndynamos. After Pixii followed Saxton, Clarke, Wheatstone and Cooke,\r\nEstohrer, and others, but not until 1854 was any very notable\r\nimprovement made or suggested. In that year Soren Hjorth, of\r\nCopenhagen, described in a patent specification the principle of\r\ncausing the electric currents generated to traverse coils of wire so\r\ndisposed as to reinforce the magnetic field of the machine itself.\r\nA year subsequently the same idea was again more clearly set out by\r\nHjorth. This is the principle of the modern self-exciting dynamo,\r\nthe field magnets of which, very weak at the start, are built up or\r\nstrengthened by the currents from the armature or revolving part of the\r\nmachine in which power is consumed to produce electricity.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Dr. Werner Siemens, of Berlin, well known as a great pioneer in\r\nthe electric arts, brought out the Siemens armature, an innovation more\r\nvaluable than any other made up to that time. This was subsequently\r\nused in the powerful machines of Wilde and Ladd. It still survives in\r\nmagneto call-bell apparatus for such work as telephone signalling,\r\nin exploders for mines and blasting, and in the simpler types of\r\nelectroplating dynamos.\r\n\r\nThe decade between 1860 and 1870 opened a new era in the construction\r\nand working of dynamo machines and motors. It is notable for two\r\nadvances of very great value and importance. Dr. Paccinotti, of\r\nFlorence, in 1860, described a machine by which true continuous\r\ncurrents resembling battery currents could be obtained. Up to that\r\ntime machines gave either rapidly alternating or fluctuating currents,\r\nnot steady currents in one direction. The Paccinotti construction, in\r\nmodified forms, is now almost universally employed in dynamo machines,\r\nand even where the form is now quite different the Paccinotti type has\r\nbeen at least the forerunner, and has undergone modifications to suit\r\nspecial ends in view. Briefly, Paccinotti made his armature of a ring\r\nof iron with iron projections between which the coils of insulated\r\nwire were wound. Although full descriptions of Paccinotti’s ring\r\narmature and commutator were given out in 1864, his work attracted but\r\nlittle attention until Gramme, in Paris, about 1870, brought out the\r\nrelatively perfect Gramme machine. In the mean time the other great\r\ndevelopment of the decade took place.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hjorth had, as stated before, put forward the idea that a\r\ndynamo generator might itself furnish currents for magnetizing its own\r\nmagnets, this valuable suggestion was not apparently worked out until\r\n1866, when a machine was constructed for Sir Charles Wheatstone. This\r\nappears to have been the first self-exciting machine in existence.\r\nWheatstone read a paper before the Royal Society in February, 1867, “On\r\nthe Augmentation of the Power of a Magnet by the Reaction thereon of\r\nCurrents Induced by the Magnet Itself.” This action later became known\r\nas the reaction principle in dynamo machines.\r\n\r\nAs often happens, the idea occurred to other workers in science almost\r\nsimultaneously, and Dr. Werner Siemens also read a paper in Berlin\r\nabout a month earlier than that of Wheatstone, clearly describing\r\nthe reaction principle. Furthermore, a patent specification had\r\nbeen filed in the British Patent Office by S. A. Varley, December\r\n24, 1866, clearly showing the same principle of action, and he was,\r\ntherefore, the first to put the matter on record. The time was ripe\r\nfor the appearance of machines closely resembling the types now in\r\nsuch extended use. Gramme, in 1870, adopting a modified form of the\r\nPaccinotti ring and commutator, and employing the reaction principle,\r\nfirst succeeded in producing a highly efficient, compact, and durable\r\ncontinuous-current dynamo. The Gramme machine was immediately\r\nrecognized as a great technical triumph. It was in a sense the\r\nculmination of many years of development, beginning with the early\r\nattempts immediately following Faraday’s discovery, already referred\r\nto. Gramme constructed his revolving armature of a soft iron wire ring,\r\nupon which ring a series of small coils of insulated wire were wound\r\nin successive radial planes. These coils were all connected with a\r\ncontinuous wire and from the junctions of the coils one with another\r\nconnections were taken to a range of copper bars insulated from each\r\nother, constituting the commutator. In 1872 Von Hefner Alteneck, in\r\nBerlin, modified the ring winding of Gramme and produced the “drum\r\nwinding,” which avoided the necessity for threading wire through the\r\ncentre of the iron ring as in the Gramme construction. The several\r\ncoils of the drum were still connected, as in Gramme’s machine, to the\r\nsuccessive strips of the commutator.\r\n\r\nIn modern dynamos and motors the armature, usually constructed of\r\nsheet-iron punchings, is a ring with projections as in Paccinotti’s\r\nmachine, and the coils of wire are in most cases wound separately and\r\nthen placed in the spaces between the projections, constituting in fact\r\na form of drum winding. In the early 70’s a few Gramme ring and Siemens\r\ndrum machines had been applied to the running of arc lights, one\r\nmachine for each light. There were also some Gramme machines in use for\r\nelectroplating.\r\n\r\nAt the Centennial Exhibition, held at Philadelphia in 1876, but two\r\nexhibits of electric-lighting apparatus were to be found. Of these\r\none was the Gramme and the other the Wallace-Farmer exhibit. The\r\nWallace-Farmer dynamo machine is a type now obsolete. It was not a good\r\ndesign, but the Wallace exhibit contained other examples reflecting\r\ngreat credit on this American pioneer in dynamo work. Some of these\r\nmachines were very similar in construction to later forms which went\r\ninto very extensive use. The large search-lights occasionally used in\r\nnight illumination during the exhibitions were operated by the current\r\nfrom Wallace-Farmer machines. The Gramme exhibit was a remarkable\r\nexhibit for its time. Though not extensive, it was most instructive.\r\nThere were found in it a dynamo running an arc lamp; a large machine\r\nfor electrolytic work, such as electroplating or electrotyping, and,\r\nmost novel and interesting of all, one Gramme machine driven by power\r\nwas connected to another by a pair of wires and the second run as a\r\nmotor. This in turn drove a centrifugal-pump, and raised water which\r\nflowed in a small fall or cataract. A year or two previously the Gramme\r\nmachine had been accidentally found to be as excellent an electric\r\nmotor as it was a generating dynamo. The crude motors of Jacobi,\r\nFroment, Davenport, Page, Vergnes, Gaume, and many others, were thus\r\nrendered obsolete at a stroke. The first public demonstration of the\r\nworking of one Gramme machine by another was made by Fontaine at the\r\nVienna Exhibition of 1873.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a foreshadowing of the great electric-power\r\ntransmission plants of to-day; the suggestion of the electric station\r\nfurnishing power as well as light, and, to a less degree, the promise\r\nof future railways using electric power. Replace the centrifugal pump\r\nof this modest exhibit by a turbine wheel, reverse the flow of water so\r\nas to cause it to drive the electric motor so that the machine becomes\r\na dynamo, and, in like manner, make of the dynamo a motor, and we\r\nexemplify in a simple way recent great enterprises using water-power\r\nfor the generation of current to be transmitted over lines to distant\r\nelectric motors or lights.\r\n\r\nThe Centennial Exhibition also marks the beginning—the very birth,\r\nit may be said—of an electric invention destined to become, before\r\nthe close of the century, a most potent factor in human affairs. The\r\nspeaking telephone of Alexander Graham Bell was there exhibited for the\r\nfirst time to the savants, among whom was the distinguished electrician\r\nand scientist Sir William Thomson. For the first time in the history of\r\nthe world a structure of copper wire and iron spoke to a listening ear.\r\nNay, more, it both listened to the voice of the speaker and repeated\r\nthe voice at a far-distant point. The instruments were, moreover, the\r\nacme of simplicity. Within a year many a boy had constructed a pair of\r\ntelephones at an expenditure for material of only a few pennies. In\r\nits first form the transmitting telephone was the counterpart of the\r\nreceiver, and they were reversible in function. The transmitter was in\r\nreality a minute dynamo driven by the aërial voice waves; the receiver,\r\na vibratory motor worked by the vibratory currents from the transmitter\r\nand reproducing the aërial motions. This arrangement, most beautiful\r\nin theory, was only suited for use on short lines, and was soon\r\nafterwards replaced by various forms of carbon microphone transmitter,\r\nto the production of which many inventors had turned their attention,\r\nnotably Edison, Hughes, Blake, and Hunnings. In modern transmitters\r\nthe voice wave does not furnish the power to generate the telephone\r\ncurrent, but only controls the flow of an already existing current from\r\na battery. In this way the effects obtainable may be made sufficiently\r\npowerful for transmission to listeners 1500 miles away.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to dwell here upon the enormous saving of time secured\r\nby the telephone and the profound effect its introduction has had upon\r\nbusiness and social life. The situation is too palpable. Nevertheless,\r\nfew users of this wonderful invention realize how much thought and\r\nskill have been employed in working out the details of exchange\r\nswitchboards, of signalling devices, of underground cables and overhead\r\nwires, and of the speaking instruments themselves. Few of those who\r\ntalk between Boston and Chicago know that in doing so they have for\r\nthe exclusive use of their voices a total of over 1,000,000 pounds of\r\ncopper wire in the single line. There probably now exist in the United\r\nStates alone between 75,000 and 100,000 miles of hard-drawn copper wire\r\nfor long-distance telephone service, and over 150,000 miles of wire in\r\nunderground conduits. There are upward of three-quarters of a million\r\ntelephones in the United States, and, including both overhead and\r\nunderground lines, a total of more than half a million miles of wire.\r\nApproximately one thousand million conversations are annually conveyed.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of sub-oceanic telephoning is frequently discussed, but\r\nthe problem thus far is not solved. It involves grave difficulties, and\r\nwe may hope that its solution is to be one of the advances which will\r\nmark the twentieth century’s progress.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the telephone in 1876 seemed to stimulate invention in\r\nthe electric field to a remarkable degree. Its immediate commercial\r\nsuccess probably acted also to inspire confidence in other proposed\r\nelectric enterprises. Greater attention than ever before began to\r\nbe given to the problem of electric lighting. An electric arc lamp,\r\nprobably the only one in regular use, had been installed at Dungeness\r\nLight-house in 1862, after a long set of trials and tests. It was fed\r\nby a Holmes magneto-electric machine of the old type, very large and\r\ncumbrous for the work. Numerous changes and improvements had before\r\n1878 been made in arc lamps by Serrin, Duboscq, and many others.\r\nBut the display of electric light during the Paris Exposition of\r\n1878 was the first memorable use of the electric light on a large\r\nscale. The splendid illumination of the Avenue de l’Opéra was a grand\r\nobject-lesson. The source of light was the “electric candle” of Paul\r\nJablochkoff, a Russian engineer. It was a strikingly original and\r\nsimple arc lamp. Instead of placing the two carbons point to point,\r\nas had been done in nearly all previous lamps, he placed them side by\r\nside, with a strip of baked kaolin between them. The candle so formed\r\nwas supported in a suitable holder, whereby, at the lower end, the\r\ntwo parallel carbons were connected with the circuit terminals. By a\r\nsuitable device the arc was started at the top and burned down. The\r\nelectric candle seemed to solve the problem of allowing complicated\r\nmechanism for feeding the carbons to be discarded; but it survived\r\nonly a short time. Owing to unforeseen difficulties it was gradually\r\nabandoned, after having served a great purpose in directing the\r\nattention of the world to the possibilities of the electric arc in\r\nlighting.\r\n\r\nInventors in America were not idle. By the close of 1878, Brush, of\r\nCleveland, had brought out his series system of arc lights, including\r\nspecial dynamos, lamps, etc., and by the middle of 1879 had in\r\noperation machines each capable of maintaining sixteen arc lamps\r\non one wire. This was, indeed, a great achievement for that time.\r\nWeston, of Newark, had also in operation circuits of arc lamps, and the\r\nThomson-Houston system had just started in commercial work with eight\r\narc lamps in series from a single dynamo. Maxim and Fuller, in New\r\nYork, were working arc lamps from their machines, and capital was being\r\nrapidly invested in new enterprises for electric lighting. Some of the\r\ngreat electric manufacturing concerns of to-day had their beginning\r\nat that time. Central lighting stations began to be established in\r\ncities, and the use of arc lights in street illumination and in stores\r\ngrew rapidly. More perfect forms of arc lamps were invented, better\r\ngenerating dynamos and regulating apparatus brought out. Factories\r\nfor arc-light carbon making were built. The first special electrical\r\nexhibition was held in Paris in 1881. In the early 80’s, also, the\r\nbusiness of arc lighting had become firmly established, and soon the\r\nbulk of the work was done under two of the leading systems. These were\r\nafterwards brought together under one control, thus securing in the\r\napparatus manufactured a combination of the good features of both.\r\nUntil about 1892 nearly all the arc lamps in use were worked under the\r\nseries system, in which the lights are connected one after another on a\r\ncircuit and traversed by the same current. This current has a standard\r\nvalue, or is a constant current. Sometimes as many as a hundred lamps\r\nwere on one wire. As the mains for the supply of incandescent lamps\r\nat constant pressure, or potential, were extended, attention was more\r\nstrongly turned to the possibility of working arc lights therefrom.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years of the close of the century this placing of arc\r\nlamps in branches from the same mains which supply incandescent lamps\r\nbecame common, and the enclosure of the arc in a partially air-tight\r\nglobe, a procedure advocated by Staite, in 1847, was revived by\r\nHoward, Marks, and others for saving carbons and attention to the lamp.\r\nThe enclosed arc lamp was also found to be especially adapted to use in\r\nbranches of the incandescent lamp circuits, which had in cities become\r\ngreatly extended. The increasing employment of alternating currents\r\nin the distribution of electric energy has led also to the use of\r\nalternating current arc lamps, and special current-regulating apparatus\r\nis now being applied on a large scale to extended circuits of these\r\nlamps. It can be seen from these facts that the art is still rapidly\r\nprogressing and the field ever widening. A little over twenty years\r\nago practically no arc lamps were used. At the close of the century,\r\nthey were numbered by hundreds of thousands. The annual consumption of\r\ncarbons in this country has reached two hundred millions.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the beginning of the commercial work of arc\r\nlighting, Edison, in a successful effort to provide a small electric\r\nlamp for general distribution in place of gas, brought to public notice\r\nhis carbon filament incandescent lamp.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of progress had previously been made by various\r\nworkers in attempting to reduce the volume of light in each lamp and\r\nincrease the number of lights for a given power expended. Forms of\r\nincandescent arc lamps, or semi-incandescent lamps, were tried on a\r\nconsiderable scale abroad, but none have survived. So, also, many\r\nattempts to produce a lamp giving light by pure incandescence of solid\r\nconductors proved for the most part abortive. Edison himself worked\r\nfor nearly two years on a lamp based upon the old idea of incandescent\r\nplatinum strips or wires, but without success. The announcement of\r\nthis lamp caused a heavy drop in gas shares, long before the problem\r\nwas really solved by a masterly stroke in his carbon filament lamp.\r\nCuriously, the nearest approach to the carbon filament lamp had been\r\nmade in 1845, by Starr, an American, who described in a British patent\r\nspecification a lamp in which electric current passed through a thin\r\nstrip of carbon kept it heated while surrounded by a glass bulb in\r\nwhich a vacuum was maintained. Starr had exhibited his lamps to\r\nFaraday, in England, and was preparing to construct dynamos to furnish\r\nelectric current for them in place of batteries, but sudden death put\r\nan end to his labors. The specification describing his lamp is perhaps\r\nthe earliest description of an incandescent lamp of any promise, and\r\nthe subsequently recorded ideas of inventors up to the work of Edison\r\nseem now to be almost in the nature of retrograde movements. None of\r\nthem were successful commercially. Starr, who was only twenty-five\r\nyears of age, is reported to have died of overwork and worry in his\r\nefforts to perfect his invention. His ideas were evidently far in\r\nadvance of his time.\r\n\r\nThe Edison lamp differed from those which preceded it in the extremely\r\nsmall section of the carbon strip rendered hot by the current, and in\r\nthe perfection of the vacuum in which it was mounted. The filament\r\nwas first made of carbonized paper, and afterwards of bamboo carbon.\r\nThe modern incandescent lamp has for years past been provided with a\r\nfilament made by a chemical process. The carbon formed is exceedingly\r\nhomogeneous and of uniform electric resistance. Edison first exhibited\r\nhis lamp in his laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey, in December,\r\n1879; but before it could be properly utilized an enormous amount of\r\nwork had to be done. His task was not merely the improvement of an art\r\nalready existing; it was the creation of a new art. Special dynamo\r\nmachines had to be invented and constructed for working the lamps;\r\nswitches were needed for connecting and disconnecting lamps and groups\r\nof lamps; meters for measuring the consumption of electric energy were\r\nwanted; safety fuses and cut-offs had to be provided; electroliers or\r\nfixtures to support the lamp were required; and, lastly, a complete\r\nsystem of underground mains with appurtenances was a requisite for city\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nEven the steam-engines for driving the dynamos had to be remodelled\r\nand improved for electric work, and ten years of electric lighting\r\ndevelopment did more towards the refinement and perfection of\r\nsteam-engines than fifty years preceding. Steadiness of lights meant\r\nthe preservation of steady speed in the driving machinery. The Pearl\r\nStreet station in New York City was the first installation for the\r\nsupply of current for incandescent lighting in a city district. The\r\nconstant pressure dynamos were gradually improved and enlarged. The\r\ndetails of all parts of the system were made more perfect, and in the\r\nhands of Edison and others the incandescent lamps, originally of high\r\ncost, were much cheapened and the quality of the production was greatly\r\nimproved. Lamps originally cost one dollar each. The best lamps that\r\nare made can be had at present for about one-fifth that price. Millions\r\nof incandescent lamps are annually manufactured. Great lighting\r\nstations furnish the current for the working of these lamps, some\r\nstations containing machinery aggregating many thousands of horse-power\r\ncapacity. Not only do these stations furnish electric energy for the\r\nworking of arc lamps and incandescent lamps, but, in addition, for\r\ninnumerable motors ranging in size from the small desk fan of one-tenth\r\nhorse-power up to those of hundreds of horse-power. The larger sizes\r\nreplace steam or hydraulic power for elevators, and many are used in\r\nshops and factories for driving machinery such as printing-presses,\r\nmachinery tools, and the like.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that it was well known that a good dynamo when\r\nreversed could be made a source of power, few electric motors were\r\nin use until a considerable time after the establishment of the first\r\nlighting stations. Even in 1884, at the Philadelphia Electrical\r\nExhibition, only a few electric motors were shown. Not until 1886 or\r\nthereafter did the “motor load” of an electric station begin to be a\r\nfactor in its business success. The motors supplied are an advantageous\r\nadjunct, inasmuch as they provide a day load, increasing the output\r\nof the station at a time when the lighting load is small and when the\r\nmachinery in consequence would, without them, have remained idle. The\r\ngrowth of the application of electric motors in the closing years of\r\nthe century has been phenomenal, even leaving out of consideration\r\ntheir use in electric railways.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago an electric motor was a curiosity; fifty years ago\r\ncrude examples run by batteries were only to be occasionally found in\r\ncabinets of scientific apparatus. Machinery Hall, at the Centennial\r\nExhibition of 1876, typified the mill of the past, never again to be\r\nreproduced, with its huge engine and lines of heavy shafting and belts\r\nconveying power to the different tools or machines in operation. The\r\nmodern mill or factory has its engines and dynamos located wherever\r\nconvenient, its electric lines and numerous motors connected thereto,\r\nand each of them either driving comparatively short lines of shafting\r\nor attached to drive single pieces of machinery. The wilderness of\r\nbelts and pulleys which used to characterize a factory is gradually\r\nbeing cleared away, and electric distribution of power substituted.\r\nMoreover, the lighting of the modern mill or factory is done from the\r\nsame electric plant which distributes power.\r\n\r\nThe electric motor has already partly revolutionized the distribution\r\nof power for stationary machinery, but as applied to railways in place\r\nof animal power the revolution is complete. The period which has\r\nelapsed since the first introduction of electric railways is barely a\r\ndozen years. It is true that a few tentative experiments in electric\r\ntraction were made some time in advance of 1888, notably by Siemens,\r\nin Berlin, in 1879 and 1880, by Stephen D. Field, by T. A. Edison, at\r\nMenlo Park, by J. C. Henry, by Charles A. Van Depoele, and others. If\r\nwe look farther back we find efforts such as that of Farmer, in 1847,\r\nto propel railway cars by electric motors driven by currents from\r\nbatteries carried on the cars. These efforts were, of course, doomed to\r\nfailure, for economical reasons. Electric energy from primary batteries\r\nwas too costly, and if it had been cheaper, the types of electric motor\r\nused yielded so small a return of power for the electric energy spent\r\nin driving them that commercial success was out of the question. These\r\nearly efforts were, however, instructive, and may now be regarded\r\nas highly suggestive of later work. Traction by the use of storage\r\nbatteries carried on an electric car has been tried repeatedly, but\r\nappears not to be able to compete with systems of direct supply from\r\nelectric lines. The plan survives, however, in the electric automobile,\r\nmany of which have been put into service within a year or two. The\r\nelectric automobile is not well fitted for country touring; it is\r\nbest adapted to cities, where facilities for charging and caring for\r\nthe batteries can be had. Moreover, the electric carriage is of all\r\nautomobile carriages the most easily controlled, most ready; it emits\r\nno smell or hot gases and is nearly noiseless.\r\n\r\nAbout 1850, Hall, a well-known instrument maker of Boston, catalogued\r\na small toy electric locomotive dragging a car upon rails which were\r\ninsulated and connected with a stationary battery of two Grove cells.\r\nThis arrangement was sold as a piece of scientific apparatus, and\r\nappears to be the first example of an electrically driven vehicle\r\nconnected by rolling contacts to an immovable energy source. Other\r\nearly experimenters, such as Siemens, Field, and Daft, subsequently\r\nto Hall, used in actual railway work the supply by insulated tracks.\r\nThis was supplanted later by overhead insulated wires or by the\r\ninsulated third rail. Siemens & Halske, of Berlin, used a special\r\nform of overhead supply in 1881, and during the electrical exhibition\r\nin Paris in that year, a street tramway line was run by them. Later,\r\nEdison experimented with a third-rail-supply line at Menlo Park; and\r\nat Portrush, in Ireland, an actual railway was put in operation by\r\nSiemens & Halske, using the third-rail system. This was about 1883. The\r\npower of the Portrush railway was that of a water-wheel driving the\r\ngenerating dynamo.\r\n\r\nThe modern overhead trolley, or under-running trolley, as it is called,\r\nseems to have been first invented by Van Depoele, and used by him\r\nin practical electric railway work about 1886 and thereafter. The\r\nuniversality of this invention for overhead supply marks the device\r\nas a really important advance in the art of electric traction. Van\r\nDepoele was also a pioneer in the use of an underground conduit, which\r\nhe employed successfully in Toronto in 1884. The names of Edward M.\r\nBentley and Walter H. Knight stand out prominently in connection with\r\nthe first use of an underground conduit, tried under their plans in\r\nAugust, 1884, at Cleveland, on the tracks of the horse-railway company.\r\n\r\nWe have barely outlined the history of the electric-motor railway up to\r\nthe beginning of a period of wonderful development, resulting in the\r\nalmost complete replacement by electric traction of horse traction or\r\ntramway lines, all within an interval of scarcely more than ten years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1888 may be said to mark the beginning of this work, and in\r\nthat year the Sprague Company, with Frank J. Sprague at its head,\r\nput into operation the electric line at Richmond, Virginia, using\r\nthe under-running trolley. Mr. Sprague had been associated with\r\nEdison in early traction work, and was well known in connection with\r\nelectric-motor work in general. The Richmond line was the first large\r\nundertaking. It had about thirteen miles of track, numerous curves,\r\nand grades of from three to ten per cent. The enterprise was one of\r\ngreat hardihood, and but for ample financial backing and determination\r\nto spare no effort or expenditure conducive to success, must certainly\r\nhave failed. The motors were too small for the work, and there had not\r\nbeen found any proper substitute for the metal commutator brushes on\r\nthe motors—a source of endless trouble and of an enormous expense for\r\nrepairs. Nevertheless, the Richmond installation, kept in operation as\r\nit was in spite of all difficulties, served as an object-lesson, and\r\nhad the effect of convincing Mr. Henry M. Whitney and the directors\r\nof the West End Street Railway, of Boston, of the feasibility of\r\nequipping the entire railway system of Boston electrically. Meanwhile\r\nthe merging of the Van Depoele and Bentley-Knight interests into the\r\nThomson-Houston Electric Light Company brought a new factor into the\r\nfield, the Sprague interests being likewise merged with the Edison\r\nGeneral Electric Company.\r\n\r\nThe West End Company, with two hundred miles of track in and around\r\nBoston, began to equip its lines in 1888 with the Thomson-Houston\r\nplant. The success of this great undertaking left no doubt of the\r\nfuture of electric traction. The difficulties which had seriously\r\nthreatened future success were gradually removed.\r\n\r\nThe electric railway progress was so great in the United States that\r\nabout January 1, 1891, there were more than two hundred and forty lines\r\nin operation. About thirty thousand horses and mules were replaced by\r\nelectric power in the single year of 1891. In 1892 the Thomson-Houston\r\ninterests and those of the Edison General Electric Company were merged\r\nin the General Electric Company, an event of unusual importance, as\r\nit brought together the two great competitors in electric traction at\r\nthat date. Other electric manufacturers, chief among which was the\r\nWestinghouse Company, also entered the field and became prominent\r\nfactors in railway extension. In a few years horse traction in the\r\nUnited States on tramway lines virtually disappeared. Many cable lines\r\nwere converted to electric lines, and projects such as the Boston\r\nSubway began to be planned. Not the least of the advantages of electric\r\ntraction is the higher speed attainable with safety. The comfort and\r\ncleanliness of the cars, lighted brilliantly at night, and heated in\r\nwinter by the same source of energy which is used to propel them, are\r\nimportant factors.\r\n\r\nAll these things, together with the great extension of the lines into\r\nsuburban and country districts, and the interconnection of the lines\r\nof one district with those of another, cannot fail to have a decidedly\r\nbeneficial effect upon the life, habits, and health of the people.\r\nWhile the United States and Canada have been and still are the theatre\r\nof the enormous advance in electric traction, as in other electric\r\nwork, many electric car lines have in recent years been established in\r\nGreat Britain and on the continent of Europe. Countries like Japan,\r\nAustralia, South Africa, and South America have also in operation many\r\nelectric trolley lines, and the work is rapidly extending. Most of\r\nthis work, even in Europe, has been carried out either by importation\r\nof equipment from America, or by apparatus manufactured there, but\r\nfollowing American practice closely. The bulk of the work has been done\r\nwith the overhead wire and under-running trolley, but there are notable\r\ninstances of the use of electric conductors in underground slotted\r\nconduits, chief of which are the great systems of street railway in New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago the application of motor-cars in trains upon the elevated\r\nrailway followed directly upon the practical demonstration at the\r\nWorld’s Fair of the capabilities of third-rail electric traction on the\r\nIntramural Elevated Railway, and the system is rapidly extending so as\r\nto include all elevated city roads. A few years will doubtless see the\r\ngreat change accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe motor-car, or car propelled by its own motors, has also been\r\nintroduced upon standard steam roads to a limited extent as a\r\nsupplement to steam traction. The earliest of these installations are\r\nthe one at Nantasket, Massachusetts, and that between Hartford and\r\nNew Britain, in Connecticut. A number of special high-speed lines,\r\nusing similar plans, have gone into operation in recent years. The\r\nproblem of constructing electric motors of sufficient robustness for\r\nheavy work and controlling them effectively was not an easy one, and\r\nthe difficulties were increased greatly because of the placing of\r\nthe motors under the car body, exposed to wet, to dust and dirt of\r\nroad. The advantage of the motor-car, or motor-car train, is that the\r\ntraction or hold upon the track increases with the increase of the\r\nweight or load carried. It is thus able to be accelerated rapidly\r\nafter a stop, and also climb steep grades without slipping its wheels.\r\nNevertheless, there are circumstances which favor the employment of a\r\nlocomotive at the head of a train, as in steam practice. This is the\r\ncase in lines where a train of coal or ore cars is drawn by electric\r\nmining locomotives. Many such plants are in operation, and, at the same\r\ntime the electric power is used to drive fans for ventilating, pumps\r\nfor drainage, electric hoists, etc., besides being used for lighting\r\nthe mines. The trains in the tunnels of the Metropolitan Underground\r\nRailway of London have for many years been operated by steam\r\nlocomotives with the inevitable escape of steam, foul, suffocating\r\ngases, and more or less soot.\r\n\r\nA number of years ago the tunnel of the City and South London Railway\r\nwas put into successful operation with electric locomotives drawing the\r\ntrains of cars, and the nuisance caused by steam avoided. This work\r\nrecalls the early efforts of Field, of Daft, and Bentley and Knight\r\nin providing an electric locomotive for replacing the steam plant of\r\nthe elevated roads in New York City. Well-conceived as many of these\r\nplans were, electric traction had not reached a sufficient development,\r\nand the efforts were abandoned after several more or less successful\r\ntrials. It is now seen that the motor-car train may advantageously\r\nreplace the locomotive-drawn train in such instances as these elevated\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nThe three largest and most powerful electric locomotives ever put\r\ninto service are those which are employed to take trains through the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad tunnel at Baltimore. They have been in\r\nservice about seven or eight years, and are fully equal in power to\r\nthe large steam locomotives used on steam roads. Frequently trains of\r\ncars, including the steam locomotive itself, are drawn through the\r\ntunnel by these huge electric engines, the fires on the steam machines\r\nbeing for the time checked so as to prevent fouling the air of the\r\ntunnel. There was opened, in London, in 1900, a new railway called the\r\nCentral Underground, equipped with twenty-six electric locomotives for\r\ndrawing its trains. The electric and power equipment, which embodied in\r\nitself the latest results of American practice, was also manufactured\r\nin America to suit the needs of the road. Other similar railways are\r\nin contemplation in London and in other cities of Europe. As on the\r\nelevated roads in New York City, the replacement of underground steam\r\ntraction, where it exists, by electric traction is evidently only a\r\nquestion of a few years.\r\n\r\nAn electric railway may exemplify a power-transmission system in which\r\npower is delivered to moving vehicles. But the distances so covered are\r\nnot generally more than a few miles from the generating station. Where,\r\nhowever, abundant water-power exists, as at Niagara, or where fuel is\r\nvery expensive and power is to be had only at great distances from\r\nthe place at which it is to be used, electricity furnishes the most\r\neffective means for transmission and distribution. Between the years\r\n1880 and 1890 the device called alternating current transformer was\r\ndeveloped to a considerable degree of perfection. It is, in reality, a\r\nmodified induction coil, consisting of copper wire and iron, whereby a\r\ncurrent sent through one of its coils will induce similar currents in\r\nthe other coils of apparatus. It has the great advantage of having no\r\nmoving parts. Faraday, in 1831, discovered the fundamental principle\r\nof the modern transformer. Not only, however, will the current in\r\none coil of the apparatus generate by induction a new current in an\r\nentirely separate coil or circuit, but by suitably proportioning the\r\nwindings we may exchange, as it were, a large low-pressure current for\r\na small but high-pressure current, or _vice versa_. This exchange may\r\nbe made with a very small percentage of loss of energy. These valuable\r\nproperties of the transformer have rendered it of supreme importance\r\nin recent electrical extension. The first use made of it, in 1885–86,\r\nwas to transform a high-pressure current into one of low pressure in\r\nelectric lighting, enabling a small wire to be used to convey electric\r\nenergy at high pressure, and without much loss, to a long distance\r\nfrom the station. This energy at high pressure reaches the transformer\r\nplaced within or close to the building to be lighted. A low-pressure\r\nsafe current is conveyed from the transformer to the wires connected to\r\nthe lamps. In this way a current of two thousand volts, an unsafe and\r\nunsuitable pressure for incandescent lighting, is exchanged for one\r\nof about one hundred volts, which is quite safe. In this way, also,\r\nthe supply station is enabled to reach a customer too far away to be\r\nsupplied directly with current at one hundred volts, without enormous\r\nexpense for copper conductors.\r\n\r\nThe alternating current transformer not only greatly extended the\r\nradius of supply from a single station, but also enabled the station\r\nto be conveniently located where water and coal could be had without\r\ndifficulty. It also permitted the distant water-powers to become\r\nsources of electric energy for lighting, power, or for other service.\r\nFor example, a water-power located at a distance of fifty to one\r\nhundred miles or more from a city, or from a large manufacturing centre\r\nwhere cost of fuel is high, may be utilized as follows: A power-station\r\nwill be located upon the site of the water-power, and the dynamos\r\ntherein will generate electricity at, say, two thousand volts pressure.\r\nBy means of step-up transformers this will be exchanged for a current\r\nof thirty thousand volts for transmission over a line of copper or\r\naluminum wire to the distant consumption area. Here there will be a set\r\nof step-down transformers which will exchange the thirty-thousand-volt\r\nline current for one of so low a pressure as to be safe for local\r\ndistribution to lamps, to motors, etc., either stationary or upon a\r\nrailway. The same transmission plant may simultaneously supply energy\r\nfor lighting, for power, for heat, and for charging storage batteries.\r\nIt may, therefore, be employed both day and night.\r\n\r\nThese long-distance power transmission plants are generally spoken of\r\nas “two-phase,” “three-phase,” or “polyphase” systems. Before 1890\r\nno such plants existed. A large number of such installations are now\r\nworking over distances of a few miles up to one hundred miles. They\r\ndiffer from what are known as single-phase alternating systems in\r\nemploying, instead of a single alternating current, two, three, or\r\nmore, which are sent over separate lines, and in which the electric\r\nimpulses are not simultaneous, but follow each other in regular\r\nsuccession, overlapping each other’s dead points, so to speak. Early\r\nsuggestions of such a plan, about 1880, and thereafter, by Bailey,\r\nDeprez, and others, bore no fruit, and not until Tesla’s announcement\r\nof his polyphase system, in 1888, was much attention given to the\r\nsubject. A widespread interest in Tesla’s work was invoked, but several\r\nyears elapsed before engineering difficulties were overcome. This work\r\nwas done mainly by the technical staffs of the large manufacturing\r\ncompanies, and it was necessary to be done before any notable power\r\ntransmissions on the polyphase system could be established. After 1892\r\nthe growth became very rapid.\r\n\r\nThe falls of Niagara early attracted the attention of engineers to\r\nthe possibility of utilizing at least a fraction of the power. It\r\nwas seen that several hundred thousand horse-power might be drawn\r\nfrom it without materially affecting the fall, itself equivalent to\r\nseveral millions of horse-power. A gigantic power-station has lately\r\nbeen established at Niagara, taking water from a distance above the\r\nfalls and delivering it below the falls through a long tunnel which\r\nforms the tail race. Ten water-wheels, located in an immense wheel-pit\r\nabout two hundred feet deep, each wheel of a capacity of five thousand\r\nhorse-power, drive large vertical shafts, at the upper end of which\r\nare located the large two-phase dynamos, each of five thousand\r\nhorse-power. The electric energy from these machines is in part raised\r\nin pressure by huge transformers for transmission to distant points,\r\nsuch as the city of Buffalo, and a large portion is delivered to the\r\nnumerous manufacturing plants located at moderate distances from the\r\npower-station. Besides the supply of energy for lighting, and for\r\nmotors, including railways, other recent uses of electricity to which\r\nwe have not yet alluded are splendidly exemplified at Niagara. Davy’s\r\nbrilliant discovery of the alkali metals, sodium and potassium, at\r\nthe opening of the century, showed the great chemical energy of the\r\nelectric current. Its actions were afterwards carefully studied,\r\nnotably by the illustrious Faraday, whose discoveries in connection\r\nwith magnetism and magneto-electricity have been briefly described.\r\nThe electric current was found to act as a most potent chemical force,\r\ndecomposing and recomposing many chemical compounds, dissolving and\r\ndepositing metals. Hence, early in the century arose the art of\r\nelectroplating of metals, such as electro-gilding, silver-plating,\r\nnickel-plating, and copper deposition as in electrotyping. These arts\r\nare now practised on a very large scale, and naturally have affected\r\nthe whole course of manufacturing methods during the century. Moreover,\r\nsince the introduction of dynamo current, electrolysis has come to\r\nbe employed in huge plants, not only for separating metals from each\r\nother, as in refining them, but in addition for separating them from\r\ntheir ores, for the manufacture of chemical compounds before unknown,\r\nand for the cheap production of numerous substances of use in the\r\nvarious arts on a large scale. Vast quantities of copper are refined,\r\nand silver and gold often obtained from residues in sufficient amount\r\nto pay well for the process.\r\n\r\nAt Niagara also are works for the production of the metal aluminum from\r\nits ores. Similar works exist at other places here and abroad where\r\npower is cheap. This metal, which competes in price with brass, bulk\r\nfor bulk, was only obtainable before its electric reduction at $25 to\r\n$30 per pound. The metal sodium is also extracted from soda. A large\r\nplant at Niagara also uses the electric current for the manufacture of\r\nchlorine for bleach, and caustic soda, both from common salt. Chlorate\r\nof potassium is also made at Niagara by electrolysis. The field of\r\nelectro-chemistry is, indeed, full of great future possibilities. Large\r\nfurnaces heated by electricity, a single one of which will consume more\r\nthan a thousand horse-power, exist at Niagara. In these furnaces is\r\nmanufactured from coke and sand, by the Acheson process, an abrasive\r\nmaterial called carborundum, which is almost as hard as diamond, but\r\nquite low in cost. It is made into slabs and into wheels for grinding\r\nhard substances. The electric furnace furnishes also the means for\r\nproducing artificial plumbago, or graphite, almost perfectly pure, the\r\nraw material being coke powder.\r\n\r\nA large amount of power from Niagara is also consumed for the\r\nproduction in special electric arc furnaces of carbide of calcium\r\nfrom coke and lime. This is the source of acetylene gas, the new\r\nilluminant, which is generated when water is brought into contact\r\nwith the carbide. The high temperature of the electric furnace thus\r\nrenders possible chemical actions which under ordinary furnace heat\r\nwould not take place. Henri Moissan, a French scientist, well known\r\nfor his brilliant researches in electric furnace work, has even shown\r\nthat real diamonds can be made under special conditions in the electric\r\nfurnace. He has, in fact, probably practised in a small way what has\r\noccurred on a grand scale in nature, resulting in diamond fields such\r\nas those at Kimberley. One problem less is thus left to be solved. The\r\nelectro-chemical and kindred arts are practised not alone at Niagara,\r\nbut at many other places where power is cheap. Extensive plants have\r\ngrown up, mostly within the five years before the close of the century.\r\nAll of the great developments in this field have come about within the\r\nlast decade.\r\n\r\nThe use of electricity for heating is not confined to electric\r\nfurnaces, in which the exceedingly high temperature obtainable is the\r\nfactor giving rise to success. While it is not likely that electricity\r\nwill soon be used for general heating, special instances, such as the\r\nwarming of electric cars in winter by electric heaters, the operation\r\nof cooking appliances by electric current, the heating of sad-irons and\r\nthe like, give evidence of the possibilities should there ever be found\r\nmeans for the generation of electric energy from fuel with such high\r\nefficiency as eighty per cent. or more. Present methods give, under\r\nmost favorable conditions, barely ten per cent., ninety per cent. of\r\nthe energy value of the fuel being unavoidably wasted.\r\n\r\nAnother application of the heating power of electric currents is\r\nfound in the Thomson electric welding process, the development of\r\nwhich has practically taken place in the past ten years. In this\r\nprocess an exceedingly large current, at very low electric pressure,\r\ntraverses a joint between two pieces of metal to be united. It heats\r\nthe joint to fusion or softening; the pieces are pushed together and\r\nwelded. Here the heat is generated in the solid metal, for at no time\r\nduring the operation are the pieces separated. The current is usually\r\nobtained from a welding transformer, an example of an extreme type\r\nof step-down transformer. Current at several hundred volts passed\r\ninto the primary winding is exchanged for an enormous current at only\r\ntwo or three volts in the welding circuit in which the work is done.\r\nThe present uses of this electric welding process are numerous and\r\nvaried. Pieces of most of the metals and alloys, before regarded as\r\nunweldable, are capable of being joined not only to pieces of the same\r\nmetal, but also to different metals. Electric welding is applied on\r\nthe large scale, making joints in wires or rods, for welding wagon and\r\ncarriage wheel tires, for making barrel-hoops and bands for pails,\r\nfor axles of vehicles, and for carriage framing. It has given rise to\r\nspecial manufactures, such as electrically welded steel pipe or tube,\r\nwire fencing, etc. It is used for welding together the joints of\r\nsteel car-rails, for welding teeth in saws, for making many parts of\r\nbicycles, and in tool making. An instance of its peculiar adaptability\r\nto unusual conditions is the welding of the iron bands embedded within\r\nthe body of a rubber vehicle tire for holding the tire in place. For\r\nthis purpose the electric weld has been found almost essential.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of electric development concerns the storage of\r\nelectricity. The storage battery is based upon principles discovered by\r\nGaston Planté, and applied, since 1881, by Brush, by Faure, and others.\r\nSome of the larger lighting stations employ as reservoirs of electric\r\nenergy large batteries charged by surplus dynamo current. This is\r\nafterwards drawn upon when the consumer’s load is heavy, as during the\r\nevening. The storage battery is, however, a heavy, cumbrous apparatus,\r\nof limited life, easily destroyed unless guarded with skill. If a\r\nform not possessing these faults be ever found, the field of possible\r\napplication is almost limitless.\r\n\r\nThe above by no means complete account of the progress in electric\r\napplications during the century just closed should properly be\r\nsupplemented by an account of the accompanying great advances regarded\r\nfrom the purely scientific aspect. It is, however, only possible to\r\nmake a brief reference thereto within the limits of this article. The\r\nscientific study of electricity and the application of mathematical\r\nmethods in its treatment has kept busy a host of workers and drawn\r\nupon the resources of the ablest minds the age has produced. Gauss,\r\nWeber, Ampère, Faraday, Maxwell, Helmholtz, are no longer with us.\r\nOf the early founders of the science we have yet such men as Lord\r\nKelvin, formerly Sir William Thomson, Mascart, and others, still\r\nzealous in scientific work. Following them are a large number, notable\r\nfor valuable contributions to the progress of electrical science,\r\nin discoveries, in research, and in mathematical treatment of the\r\nvarious problems presented. Modern magnetism took form in the hands\r\nof Rowland, Hopkinson, Ewing, and many other able workers. Maxwell’s\r\nelectro-magnetic theory of light is confirmed by the brilliant\r\nresearches of the late Dr. Hertz, too early lost to science. Hertz\r\nproved that all luminous phenomena are in essence electrical.\r\nThe wireless telegraphy of to-day is a direct outcome of Hertz’s\r\nexperiments on electric waves. It is but little more than ten years\r\nsince Hertz announced his results to the world. His work, supplemented\r\nby that of Branly, Lodge, Marconi, and others, made wireless telegraphy\r\na possibility.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful X-ray, and the rich scientific harvest which has followed\r\nthe discovery by Röntgen of invisible radiation from a vacuum tube, was\r\npreceded by much investigation of the effects of electric discharges in\r\nvacuum tubes, and Hittorf, followed by Crookes, had given special study\r\nto these effects in very high or nearly perfect vacua. Crookes, though\r\nespecially enriching science by his work, missed the peculiar X-ray,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, must have been emitted from many of his vacuum\r\ntubes, not only in his hands, but in those of subsequent students. It\r\nwas as late as 1896 that Röntgen announced his discovery. Since that\r\ntime several other sources of invisible radiation have been discovered,\r\nmore or less similar in effect to the radiations from a vacuum tube,\r\nbut emitted, singular as the fact is, from rare substances extracted\r\nfrom certain minerals. Leaving out of consideration the great value\r\nof the X-ray to physicians and surgeons, its effect in stimulating\r\nscientific inquiry has almost been incalculable. The renewed study of\r\neffects of electric discharge in vacuum tubes has already, in the work\r\nof such investigators as Lenard, J. J. Thomson, and others, apparently\r\ncarried the subdivision of matter far beyond the time-honored chemical\r\natom, and has gone far towards showing the essential unity of all the\r\nchemical elements. It is as unlikely that the mystery of the material\r\nuniverse will ever be completely solved as it is that we can gain an\r\nadequate conception of infinite space or time. But we can at least\r\nextend the range of our mental vision of the processes of nature as we\r\ndo our real vision into space depths by the telescope and spectroscope.\r\nThere can now be no question that electric conditions and actions are\r\nmore fundamental than many hitherto so regarded.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century closed with many important problems in\r\nelectrical science unsolved. What great or far-reaching discoveries are\r\nyet in store, who can tell? What valuable practical developments are\r\nto come, who can predict? The electrical progress has been great—very\r\ngreat—but after all only a part of that grander advance in so many\r\nother fields. The hands of man are strengthened by the control of\r\nmighty forces. His electric lines traverse the mountain passes as well\r\nas the plains. His electric railway scales the Jungfrau. But he still\r\nspends his best effort, and has always done so, in the construction and\r\nequipment of his engines of destruction, and now exhausts the mines\r\nof the world of valuable metals, for ships of war, whose ultimate\r\ngoal is the bottom of the sea. In this also electricity is made to\r\nplay an increasingly important part. It trains the guns, loads them,\r\nfires them. It works the signals and the search-lights. It ventilates\r\nthe ship, blows the fires, and lights the dark spaces. Perhaps all\r\nthis is necessary now, and, if so, well. But if a fraction of the\r\nvast expenditure entailed were turned to the encouragement of advance\r\nin the arts and employments of peace in the twentieth century, can\r\nit be doubted that, at the close, the nineteenth century might come\r\nto be regarded, in spite of its achievements, as a rather wasteful,\r\nsemi-barbarous transition period?\r\n\r\n            ELIHU THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo, turning his telescope towards Jupiter,\r\nwas the first to see the beautiful system of that planet in which the\r\nuniverse is epitomized. He had already studied the variegated surface\r\nof the moon, and he had seen the spots upon the sun. A little later,\r\nin spite of the feeble power of his instrument, he had discovered\r\nthat the sun rotates upon an axis, and something of the wonderful\r\nnature of the planet Saturn had been revealed to him. The overwhelming\r\nevidence thus afforded of the truth of the hypothesis of Copernicus\r\nmade him its chief exponent. The time had come for man to know, as\r\nhe had never known or even dreamed before, his true relation to the\r\nuniverse of which he was so insignificant a part. In a single year\r\nnearly all of these capital discoveries were made. It was truly an\r\nera of intellectual expansion; never before and never since has man’s\r\nintellectual horizon enlarged with such enormous rapidity. One needs\r\nlittle imagination to share with this ardent philosopher the enthusiasm\r\nof the moment when, because some, fearing the evidence of their senses,\r\nrefused to look through the slender tube, he wrote to Kepler: “Oh, my\r\ndear Kepler, how I wish we could have one hearty laugh together!...\r\nWhy are you not here? What shouts of laughter we should have at this\r\nglorious folly!”\r\n\r\nGalileo died in 1642, and in the same year Newton was born. When\r\ntwenty-four years old he “began to think of gravity extending to the\r\norb of the moon,” and before the end of the century he had discovered\r\nand established the great law of universal gravitation. Thus, at the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, the foundations of modern physics were\r\nin place. During the eighteenth century they were much built upon, but\r\nit was the nineteenth that witnessed not only the greatest advance in\r\ndetail, but the most important generalizations made since the time of\r\nGalileo and Newton.\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring to present to the intelligent but perhaps unscientific\r\nreader a brief review of the accomplishments of that “wonderful\r\ncentury” in the domain of physics, one must not attempt more than an\r\noutline of greater events, and it will be convenient to arrange them\r\nunder the several principal subdivisions of the science, according to\r\nthe usually accepted classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT\r\n\r\nAlthough more than one philosopher of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies suggested the identity of heat and molecular motion, the\r\nimpression made was not lasting, and up to very near the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century the _caloric_ theory was accepted almost\r\nwithout dispute. This theory implied that heat was a subtle fluid,\r\ndefinite quantities of which were added to or subtracted from material\r\nsubstances when they became hot or cold. As carefully conducted\r\nexperiments seemed to show that a body weighed no more or no less when\r\nhot than when cold, it was necessary to attribute to this fluid called\r\ncaloric the mysterious property of imponderability, that is, unlike all\r\nforms of ordinary matter, it possessed no weight. To avoid calling it\r\nmatter, it was by many classed with light, electricity, and magnetism,\r\nas one of the _imponderable agents_. Various other properties were\r\nattributed to caloric, necessary to the reasonable explanation of a\r\nsteadily increasing array of experimental facts. It was declared to be\r\nelastic, its particles being mutually self-repellent. It was thought\r\nto attract ordinary matter, and an ingenious theory of caloric was\r\nconstructed, modelled upon Newton’s famous but erroneous corpuscular\r\ntheory of light. During the latter part of the eighteenth century\r\nJoseph Black, professor in the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh,\r\ndeveloped his theory of _latent heat_, which, although founded upon a\r\nfalse notion of the nature of heat, was a most important contribution\r\nto science. The downfall of the caloric theory must be largely credited\r\nto the work of a famous American who published the results of his\r\nexperiments just at the close of the eighteenth century. Benjamin\r\nThompson, generally known as Count Rumford, was born in the town of\r\nWoburn, Massachusetts, in 1753. His inclination towards physical\r\nexperimentation was strong in his early youth, and he received much\r\ninstruction and inspiration from the lectures of Professor John\r\nWinthrop, of Harvard College, some of which he was enabled to attend\r\nunder trying conditions. Having received special official consideration\r\nby appointment to office under one of the colonial governors, he was\r\naccused at the breaking out of the Revolutionary War of a leaning\r\ntowards Toryism, and was thus prevented from making his career among\r\nhis own people. At the age of twenty-two years he fled to England,\r\nreturning to America only for a brief period in command of a British\r\nregiment. In England he soon became eminent as an experimental\r\nphilosopher, and in 1778 became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He\r\nafterwards entered the service of the Elector of Bavaria, by whom\r\nhe was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1799 he returned\r\nto London and founded the “Royal Institution,” which was destined\r\nduring the next hundred years to surpass all other foundations in the\r\nrichness and importance of its contributions to physical science. It\r\nwas while at Munich that Rumford made his famous experiments on the\r\nnature of heat, to which he had been led by observing the great amount\r\nof heat generated in the boring of cannon. Finding that he was able\r\nto make a considerable quantity of water actually boil by the heat\r\ngenerated by a blunt boring tool, he concluded that the supply of heat\r\nfrom such a source was practically inexhaustible and that it could be\r\ngenerated continuously if only the motion of the tool under friction\r\nwas kept up. He declared that anything which could thus be produced\r\nwithout limitation by an insulated body or system of bodies could not\r\npossibly be a material substance, and that under the circumstances of\r\nthe experiment, the only thing that was or could be thus continuously\r\ncommunicated was _motion_.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford’s conclusions were not for a long time accepted. Davy,\r\nthe brilliant professor and eloquent lecturer at the newly established\r\nRoyal Institution, espoused the mechanical theory of heat and made\r\nthe striking experiment of melting two pieces of ice by rubbing them\r\ntogether remote from any source of heat. His contemporary, Thomas\r\nYoung, who overturned Newton’s corpuscular theory of light and showed\r\nthat it was a wave phenomenon, also advocated Rumford’s notion of the\r\nnature of heat, but even among physicists of high rank it had made\r\nlittle headway as late as the middle of the nineteenth century. In\r\nthe eighth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, published in 1856,\r\nthe immediate predecessor of the current issue, heat is defined as “a\r\nmaterial agent of a peculiar nature, highly attenuated.” And this, in\r\nspite of the fact that previous to that date the mechanical theory had\r\nbeen completely proved by the labors of Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz, and\r\nWilliam Thomson (Lord Kelvin). By these men a solid foundation for the\r\ntheory had been found in a great physical law of such importance that\r\nit is justly considered to be the most far-reaching generalization in\r\nnatural philosophy since the time of Newton. Some account of this law\r\nand its discovery will be given later in this paper.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important of the century’s contributions to our\r\nknowledge of heat must be included the work of Fourier, as embodied\r\nin his _Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur_, published in 1822. Joseph\r\nFourier was born in 1768, and died in 1830. He belonged to that\r\nsplendid group of philosophers of which the French nation may always\r\nbe proud, whose work constitutes a large part of the lustre of\r\nintellectual France during her most brilliant period, the later years\r\nof the eighteenth and the earlier years of the nineteenth century. His\r\ncontemporaries included such men as Laplace, Arago, Lagrange, Fresnel,\r\nand Carnot. Fourier wrote especially of the movement of heat in solids,\r\nand as his thesis depended in no way on the nature of heat it will\r\nalways be regarded as a classic. His assumption that conductivity was\r\nindependent of temperature was shortly proved to be erroneous, but\r\nhis general argument and conclusions were not greatly affected by\r\nthis discovery. His work is one of the most beautiful examples yet\r\nproduced of the application of mathematics to physical research, and\r\nmathematical and physical science were equally enriched by it. In\r\nits broader aspects his law of conduction includes the transfer of\r\nelectricity in good conductors, and is the real basis of Ohm’s law.\r\n\r\nOne of the most skillful and successful experimenters in heat was also\r\na Frenchman, Henri Victor Regnault (1810–78). He greatly improved the\r\nconstruction and use of the thermometer, and was the first to discover\r\nthat the indications of an air thermometer and one of mercury did not\r\nexactly agree, because they did not expand in the same degree for\r\nequal increases of temperature. His most important work was on the\r\nexpansion of gases, vapor pressure, specific heat of water, etc., and\r\nfor careful, patient measuring he had a positive genius. Until he\r\nproved the contrary it had been assumed that all gases had the same\r\ncoefficient of expansion, and Boyle’s law that the volume of a gas was\r\ninversely proportional to its pressure had not been questioned. His\r\ntables of the elastic force of steam have been of immense practical\r\nvalue, but his studies of the expansion of gases are of greater\r\ninterest because they have pointed the way to one of the most important\r\naccomplishments of the century, the liquefaction of all known gases.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years of this century it was the custom to consider\r\nvapors and gases as quite distinct forms of matter. Vapors always\r\ncame, by evaporation, from liquids, and could always be “condensed” or\r\nreduced to the liquid form without difficulty, but it was not thought\r\npossible to liquefy the so-called “permanent” gases. The first man to\r\nattack the problem systematically was Michael Faraday, who, before\r\nthe end of the first third of the century, had liquefied several\r\ngases, mostly by producing them by chemical reactions under pressure.\r\nSeveral of the more easily reducible gases or vapors, such as ammonia,\r\nsulphurous acid, and probably chlorine, had been previously liquefied\r\nby cold, but a quarter of a century elapsed after Faraday’s researches\r\nbefore the true relation of the liquid and gaseous states of matter\r\nwas understood, and it was found that both increase of pressure and\r\nlowering of temperature were, in general, essential to the liquefaction\r\nof a gas. It was Thomas Andrews, of Belfast, who first showed, in a\r\npaper published in 1863, that there was a continuity in the liquid\r\nand gaseous states of matter, that for each substance there was a\r\ncritical temperature at which it became a homogeneous fluid, neither a\r\nliquid nor a gas: that above this temperature great pressure would not\r\nliquefy, while below it the substance might exist as partly liquid and\r\npartly gas. He pointed out the fact that for the so-called permanent\r\ngases this critical temperature must be exceedingly low, and if such\r\ntemperature could be reached liquefaction would follow.\r\n\r\nSubsequent progress in the liquefaction of gases came about by\r\nfollowing this suggestion. Very low temperatures were produced by\r\nsubjecting the gas to great reduction in volume by pressure, removing\r\nthe heat of compression by conduction and radiation, and then by sudden\r\nexpansion its temperature was greatly lowered. As early as 1877 two\r\nFrenchmen, Pictet and Cailletet, had succeeded in liquefying oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and air. During the past twenty years great\r\nimprovements have been made in the methods of accomplishing these\r\ntransformations, so that to-day it is easy to produce considerable\r\nquantities of all of the principal gases in a liquid form, and by\r\ncarrying the reduction in temperature still further portions of the\r\nliquid may be changed to the solid state. The most important work along\r\nthis line has been done by Wroblewski and Olszewski, of the University\r\nof Cracow, and Professor Dewar, of the Royal Institution in London.\r\nTemperatures as low as about two hundred and fifty degrees C. below\r\nthe freezing-point of water have been produced, the “absolute zero”\r\nbeing only two hundred and seventy-three degrees C. below that point.\r\nThese experiments promise to throw much light on the nature of matter,\r\nand they are especially interesting as revealing its extraordinary\r\nproperties at extremely low temperatures. Among the most curious and\r\nsuggestive is the fact that the electrical resistance of pure metals\r\ndiminishes at a rate which indicates that at the absolute zero it would\r\nvanish, and these metals would become perfect conductors of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of heat, or “thermo-dynamics,” was an important field of\r\nresearch in the early part of the century, on account of its practical\r\napplication to the improvement of the steam-engine. The science was\r\ncreated by Carnot, who, in spite of the fact that his views regarding\r\nthe nature of heat were erroneous, discovered some of the most\r\ninteresting relations among the quantities involved, and discussed\r\ntheir applications to the heat engines with great skill. Subsequent\r\ncontributors to the theory and practice of thermo-dynamics were\r\nClausius, Rankine, Lord Kelvin, and Professor Tait.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical theory of heat naturally led up to what has already been\r\nreferred to as the most important generalization in physical science\r\nsince the time of Newton, the doctrine of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nThis principle puts physics in its relation to energy where chemistry\r\nhas long been in its relation to matter. If matter were not\r\nconservative, if it could be created or destroyed at will, chemistry\r\nwould be an impossible science. Physics is put upon a solid foundation\r\nby the assumption of a like conservatism in energy; it can neither be\r\ncreated nor destroyed, although it may appear in many different forms\r\nwhich are, in general, mutually interconvertible.\r\n\r\nMany men have contributed to the establishment of this great principle,\r\nbut it was actually discovered and proved by the labors of three or\r\nfour. Although it was practically all done before the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, its general popular recognition did not come\r\nuntil a quarter of a century later. The doctrine was first distinctly\r\nformulated by Robert Mayer, a German physician, who published in 1842 a\r\nsuggestive paper on “The Forces of Inorganic Nature,” which, however,\r\nattracted little or no attention. Mayer had not approached the problem\r\nfrom an experimental stand-point, but at about the same time it was\r\nattacked most successfully from this side by a young Englishman,\r\nJames Prescott Joule, son of a wealthy brewer of Manchester, England.\r\nJoule made the first really accurate determination of the mechanical\r\nequivalent of a given quantity of heat, a physical constant which\r\nRumford had tried to measure, reaching only a rough approximation.\r\nSubstantially Joule’s result was that the heat energy necessary to\r\nraise the temperature of any given mass of water one degree Fahr. is\r\nthe equivalent of the mechanical energy required to lift that mass\r\nthrough a height of seven hundred and seventy-two feet against the\r\nforce of the earth’s attraction; and, conversely, if a mass of water\r\nbe allowed to fall through a distance of seven hundred and seventy-two\r\nfeet under the action of gravity, and at the end of its motion be\r\ninstantly arrested, the heat generated will suffice to raise its\r\ntemperature one degree Fahr. Of such vast importance is this numerical\r\ncoefficient that it has been called the golden number of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Since Joule’s time it has been redetermined by several\r\nphysicists, notably by Professor Rowland, of Baltimore, the general\r\nconclusion being that Joule’s number was somewhat, but not greatly, too\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe first clear and full exposition of the doctrine of the conservation\r\nof energy was given by Joule in a popular lecture in Manchester in\r\n1847, but it attracted little attention until a few months later, when\r\nthe author presented his theory at a meeting of the British Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science. Even among scientific men it would\r\nhave passed without comment or consideration had it not been for the\r\npresence of another young Englishman, then as little known as Joule\r\nhimself, who began a series of remarks, appreciative and critical,\r\nwhich resulted in making Joule’s paper the sensation of the meeting.\r\nThis was William Thomson, who had been, only a year before, at the age\r\nof twenty-two years, appointed professor of natural philosophy at the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, now known as Lord Kelvin, the most versatile,\r\nbrilliant, and profound student of physical science which the century\r\nhas produced. From that day to the death of Joule (1889) these two men\r\nwere closely associated in the demonstration and exploitation of a\r\ngreat principle of which they were at first almost the sole exponents\r\namong English-speaking people.\r\n\r\nBy an interesting coincidence, in the same year in which Joule\r\nannounced the result of his experiments, the Physical Society of\r\nBerlin listened to a paper almost identical with Joule’s in character\r\nand conclusions, but prepared quite independently, by a young German\r\nphysician, Herman von Helmholtz, destined to rank at the time of his\r\ndeath, in 1893, as one of the very first mathematicians of the age,\r\ndoubtless the first physiologist of his time, and as a physicist with\r\nwhom not more than one other of the nineteenth century may be compared.\r\nHelmholtz’s paper was rejected by the editor of the leading scientific\r\njournal of Germany, but his work was so important that he must\r\nalways share with Joule and Kelvin in the glory of this epoch-making\r\ngeneralization.\r\n\r\nEven a brief sketch of the history of the doctrine of the conservation\r\nof energy would be incomplete if mention were not made of the work\r\nof Tyndall. Although by original research he contributed in no small\r\ndegree to the demonstration of the theory, it is mainly through his\r\nwonderful skill in popular presentation of the principles of physical\r\nscience that he becomes related to the great movement of the middle of\r\nthe century. His masterful exposition of the new theory in a course\r\nof lectures at the Royal Institution, given in 1862 and published in\r\n1863 under the title _Heat as a Mode of Motion_, was the means of\r\nmaking the intelligent public acquainted with its beauty and profound\r\nsignificance, and the history of science affords no more admirable\r\nexample of the possibilities and wisdom of popular scientific\r\nwriting than this book. As for the principle of the conservation of\r\nenergy itself it is not too much to say that during the last half\r\nof the century it has been the guiding and controlling spirit of\r\nall scientific discovery or of invention through the application of\r\nscientific principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT\r\n\r\nThe revival and final establishment of the undulatory or wave theory of\r\nlight is one of the glories of the nineteenth century, and the credit\r\nfor it is due to Thomas Young, an Englishman, and Fresnel, a Frenchman.\r\nNewton had conceived, espoused, and, owing to the great authority\r\nof his name, almost fixed upon the learned world the corpuscular or\r\nemission theory, which assumes that all luminous bodies emit streams of\r\nminute corpuscles, which are reflected, refracted, and produce vision.\r\nMany ordinary optical phenomena were explained by this hypothesis\r\nonly with great difficulty, and some were quite unexplainable. The\r\ntransmission of a disturbance or vibratory motion by means of waves, as\r\nin the case of sound, was a well-recognized principle, and Young and\r\nFresnel applied it most successfully to the phenomena of light. Wave\r\nmotion, in a general way, is only possible in a sensibly continuous\r\nmedium, such as water, air, etc., and the theory that light was a\r\nvibratory disturbance transmitted by means of waves necessitated the\r\nassumption of the existence of such a medium throughout all space in\r\nwhich light travelled. What is known as the ethereal medium, at first\r\na purely imaginary substance, but whose real existence is practically\r\nestablished, satisfies this demand, and the hypothesis that light is\r\ntransmitted by waves in such a medium, originating in a vibratory\r\ndisturbance at the source, has been of inestimable value to physical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe work of Thomas Young was done in the very first years of the\r\nnineteenth century. He was for two years professor of Natural\r\nPhilosophy in the Royal Institution just founded by Count Rumford, and\r\nhe was the first to fill that chair. In 1801, in a paper presented to\r\nthe Royal Society, he argued in favor of the undulatory theory, showing\r\nhow the interference of waves would explain the color of thin plates.\r\nHis papers were not, for several years, received favorably, and they\r\nwere severely criticised by Lord Brougham. Augustus Fresnel followed\r\nYoung, but quite independently, about ten years later, and by him the\r\nundulatory theory received elaborate experimental and mathematical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time another Frenchman had made a capital discovery in\r\noptics, which seemed at first to be quite incompatible with the wave\r\ntheory. This was the discovery of what is known as _polarization of\r\nlight_ by Malus, a French engineer, who hit upon it while investigating\r\ndouble refraction of crystals, for a study of which the French\r\nInstitute had offered a prize in 1808. Malus found that when light fell\r\nupon a surface of glass at a certain angle a portion of the reflected\r\nlight appeared to have acquired entirely new properties in regard to\r\nfurther reflection, and the same was true of that part of the beam\r\nwhich was transmitted through the glass. The light thus affected was\r\nincapable of further reflection under certain conditions, and as the\r\nbeam seemed to behave differently according to how it was presented\r\nto the reflecting surface, the term polarization was applied to the\r\nphenomenon. It was found that the two rays into which a single beam\r\nof light was split by a doubly refracting crystal (a phenomenon which\r\nhad long been known) were affected in this way, and that light was\r\npolarized by refraction as well as by reflection. Malus was a believer\r\nin the corpuscular theory of light, but it was shortly proved, first\r\nby Thomas Young, that the phenomenon of polarization was not only\r\nnot opposed to the wave theory, but that that theory furnished a\r\nrational explanation of it. This explanation, in brief, assumes that\r\nordinary light is a wave produced by a vibratory motion confined to\r\nno particular plane, the direction of vibration being at right angles\r\nto the direction of the wave, and in any, or, in rapid succession, in\r\n_all_ azimuths. When light is polarized the vibratory motion in the\r\nether is restricted to one particular form, a line if plane polarized,\r\na circle or an ellipse if circularly or elliptically polarized. This\r\nsimple hypothesis has been found quite adequate, and through its\r\napplication to the various phenomena of polarization, together with\r\nthe application of Young’s theory of the interference of waves to\r\nthe production of color, the undulatory theory of light was firmly\r\nestablished before the middle of the century. There were many noted\r\nphilosophers, however, who stood out long against it, notably Brewster,\r\nthe most famous English student of optics of the early part of the\r\ncentury, who declared that his “chief objection to the undulatory\r\ntheory was that he could not think the Creator guilty of so clumsy a\r\ncontrivance as the filling of space with ether in order to produce\r\nlight.” In studying the nature of light it became very important to\r\nknow how fast a light wave travelled. A tolerably good measure of the\r\nvelocity of light had been made long before by means of the eclipses of\r\nJupiter’s moons and by observations upon the positions of the stars as\r\ninfluenced by the motion of the earth in its orbit. It was found to be\r\napproximately one hundred and eighty thousand miles per second, a speed\r\nso great that it seemed impossible that it should ever be measured by\r\nusing only terrestrial distances.\r\n\r\nThis extremely difficult problem has been solved, however, in a most\r\nsatisfactory manner by nineteenth-century physicists. Everybody\r\nknows that in a uniform motion velocity is equal to space or distance\r\ndivided by time. If, then, the time occupied in passing through a\r\ngiven distance can be measured, the velocity is at once known. As the\r\nvelocity of light is very large, unless the distance is enormously\r\ngreat, the time will be extremely small, and if moderate distances\r\nare to be used the problem is to measure very small intervals of time\r\nvery accurately. Light will travel one mile in about the one hundred\r\nand eighty-sixth thousandth part of a second, and if by using a mile\r\nas the distance the velocity of light is to be determined within\r\none per cent., it is necessary to be able to detect differences of\r\ntime as small as about one twenty-millionth of a second. This has\r\nbeen made possible by the use of two distinct methods. Foucault, on\r\nthe suggestion of Arago, used a rapidly revolving mirror, a method\r\nintroduced by Wheatstone, the English electrician, who used it in\r\nfinding the duration of an electric spark. The essential principle is\r\nthat a mirror may be made to revolve so rapidly that it will change its\r\nposition by a measurable angle, while light which has been reflected\r\nfrom it passes to a somewhat distant fixed mirror and returns to the\r\nmoving reflector. In the other method a toothed wheel is revolved so\r\nrapidly that a beam of light passing between two consecutive teeth to\r\na distant fixed mirror is cut off on its return to the wheel by the\r\ntooth, which has moved forward while the light has made its journey.\r\nThis method was first used by Fizeau. In either method, if the speed\r\nof rotation is known, the time is readily found. In point of time,\r\nFizeau was the first to attack the problem, which he did about 1849.\r\nFoucault was perhaps a year later in getting results, but his method\r\nis generally considered the best. Both methods have been used by other\r\nexperimenters, and very important improvements in Foucault’s method\r\nwere made in the United States by Michelson about 1878. Michelson’s\r\nmethod increased enormously the precision of the measurements, and\r\nit has been applied by him and by Newcomb, not only for the better\r\ndetermination of the velocity of light in air, but for the solution\r\nof many other related problems of first importance. Michelson’s final\r\ndetermination of the absolute velocity of light (in the ether) is\r\neverywhere accepted as authoritative.\r\n\r\nAnother discovery in optics entirely accomplished during the nineteenth\r\ncentury and of the very first importance is generally known as\r\n“Spectrum Analysis.” This discovery has not yet ceased to excite\r\nadmiration and even amazement, and especially among those who best\r\nunderstand it. By its use hitherto unknown substances have become\r\nknown; to the physicist it is an instrument of research of the greatest\r\npower, and perhaps more than anything else it promises to throw light\r\non the ultimate nature of matter; to the astronomer it has revealed\r\nthe composition, physical condition, and even the motions of the most\r\ndistant heavenly bodies, all of which the philosophy of a hundred years\r\nago would have pronounced absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of spectrum analysis was in 1802, when an Englishman, Dr.\r\nWollaston, observed dark lines interrupting the solar spectrum when\r\nproduced by a good prism upon which the sunlight fell after passing\r\nthrough a narrow slit. About ten years later, Fraunhofer, at Munich, a\r\nskilful worker in glass and a keen observer, discovered in the spectrum\r\nof light from a lamp two yellow bands, now known as the sodium, or\r\n“D” lines. Combining the three essential elements of the modern\r\nspectroscope, the slit, the prism, and the observing telescope, he saw\r\nin the spectrum of sunlight “an almost countless number of dark lines.”\r\nHe was the first to use a grating for the production of the spectrum,\r\nusing at first fine wire gratings and afterwards ruling fine lines\r\nupon glass, and with these he made the first accurate measures of the\r\nlength of light waves. He did not, however, comprehend the full import\r\nof the problem which he thus brought to the attention of physicists.\r\nAbout twenty years later Sir John Herschell studied the bright line\r\nspectra of different substances and found that they might be used to\r\ndetect the presence of minute quantities of a substance whose spectrum\r\nwas known. Wheatstone studied the spectrum of the electric arc passing\r\nbetween metals, and in 1874 Dr. J. W. Draper published a very important\r\npaper on the spectra of solids with increasing temperature. Although\r\nquite in the dark as to the real nature of the phenomena with which\r\nthey were dealing, these observers paved the way for the splendid work\r\nof the two Germans, Kirchoff and Bunsen, who, about 1860, found the key\r\nto this wonderful problem and made the science of spectrum analysis\r\nsubstantially what it is to-day. Its fundamental principles may be\r\nconsidered as few and comparatively simple.\r\n\r\nWaves of light and radiant heat originate in ether disturbances\r\nproduced by molecular vibration, and have impressed upon them all of\r\nthe important qualities of that vibration. Molecules of different\r\nsubstances differ in their modes of vibration, each producing a wave\r\npeculiar to and characteristic of itself. A useful analogy may be found\r\nin the fact that when one listens to the music of an orchestra without\r\nseeing it it is easy to recognize the tones that come from each of\r\nthe several instruments, the characteristic vibrations of each being\r\nimpressed upon the waves in air which carry the sound to the ear. So\r\ndelicate and so sure is this impression of vibration peculiarities that\r\nit is even possible to know the maker of a violin, for instance, by a\r\ncharacteristic _timbre_ which must have its physical expression in the\r\nsound wave. The ear, more perfect than the eye, analyzes the resultant\r\ndisturbance into its component parts so that each element may be\r\nattributed to its proper source. Unaided, the eye cannot do this with\r\nlight, but the spectroscope separates the various modes of vibration\r\nwhich make up the confused whole, so that varieties of molecular\r\nactivity are recognizable. The speed at which a source of sound is\r\napproaching or receding from the ear can be ascertained by noting the\r\nrise or fall in pitch due to the crowding together or stretching out\r\nof the sound waves, and in the same way the motion of a luminous body\r\nis known from the increase or decrease of the refrangibility of the\r\nelements of its spectrum.\r\n\r\nIndeed, had nineteenth-century science accomplished nothing else than\r\nthe discovery of spectrum analysis, it would have marked the beginning\r\nof a new epoch. By this device man is put in communication with every\r\nconsiderable body in the universe, including even the invisible. The\r\n“goings on” of Sirius and Algol, of Orion and the Pleiads are reported\r\nto him across enormous stretches of millions of millions of miles of\r\nspace, empty save of the ethereal medium itself, by this most wonderful\r\n“wireless telegraphy.” And it is by the vibratory motion of the\r\ninvisibly small that all of this is revealed; the infinitely little has\r\nenabled us to conquer the inconceivably big.\r\n\r\nMany important contributions to the theory and practice of spectrum\r\nanalysis have been made since the time of Kirchoff and Bunsen, only\r\ntwo or three of which can be referred to here. Instrumental methods by\r\nwhich spectra are produced and examined have been greatly perfected,\r\nand this is especially true of what is known as the “diffraction\r\ngrating” first used by Fraunhofer. A quarter of a century ago\r\nRutherford, of New York, constructed a ruling engine by means of which\r\ngratings on glass and spectrum metal were ruled with a precision\r\ngreatly exceeding what had before been possible. A few years later\r\nRowland, of Baltimore, made a notable advance in the construction of\r\na screw far more perfect than any before made, producing gratings of\r\na fineness and regularity of spacing far ahead of any others, and\r\nespecially by the capital discovery of the concave grating, by means\r\nof which the most beautiful results have been obtained. Very recently\r\nMichelson, of Chicago, has invented the echelon spectroscope, which,\r\nalthough greatly restricted in range, exceeds all others in power of\r\nanalysis of spectral lines. In his hands this instrument has been most\r\neffective in the study of the influence of a strong magnetic field\r\nupon the character of the spectrum from light produced therein, a most\r\ninteresting phenomenon first observed by Zeeman and one which promises\r\nto reveal much concerning the relation of molecular activity to light\r\nand to magnetic force.\r\n\r\nThe development of spectrum analysis was necessarily accompanied by a\r\nrecognition of the identity of radiant heat and light. The study of\r\nradiant heat, which was carried on during the earlier years of the\r\ncentury by Leslie, and later by Melloni and Tyndall, by what might be\r\ncalled thermal methods, has been industriously pursued during the last\r\ntwo decades by processes similar to those adopted for visual radiation.\r\nThe most notable contribution to this work is the invention of the\r\n_bolometer_, by Langley, who, at Allegheny, and later at Washington,\r\nhas made exhaustive studies of solar radiation in invisible regions\r\nof the spectrum, especially among the waves of greater length than\r\nthose of red light, where he has found absorption lines and bands\r\nsimilar in character to those observed in the visible spectrum. He has\r\nalso studied the absorption of the earth’s atmosphere, the relation\r\nof energy to visual effect, and many other interesting problems, the\r\nsolution of which was made possible by the use of the bolometer.\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of the invention by Michelson of an\r\ninterference comparator, by means of which linear measurements by\r\noptical methods can be accomplished with a degree of accuracy hitherto\r\nunheard of. With this instrument Michelson has determined the length of\r\nthe international prototype metre in terms of the wave length of the\r\nlight of a particular spectral line, thus furnishing for the first time\r\na satisfactory _natural_ unit of length.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important contribution to the theory of light made\r\nduring the last half of the century is that of Maxwell, who, in 1873,\r\nannounced the proposition that electro-magnetic phenomena and light\r\nphenomena have their origin in the same medium, and that they are\r\nidentical in nature. This far-reaching conclusion has been generally\r\naccepted and formed the basis of much of the most important work in\r\nphysical research in process of elaboration as the century closed. To\r\nsome of this reference will presently be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\r\n\r\nIn no other department of physical science have such remarkable\r\ndevelopments occurred during the past century as in electricity and\r\nmagnetism, for in no other department have the practical applications\r\nof scientific discovery been so numerous and so far reaching in their\r\neffect upon social conditions. In a brief review of the contributions\r\nof the nineteenth century to the evolution of the telegraph, telephone,\r\ntrolley-car, electric lighting, and other means of utilizing\r\nelectricity, it will be possible to consider only a very few of the\r\nfundamental discoveries upon which the enormous and rather complex\r\nsuperstructure of to-day rests. Happily these are few in number, and\r\ntheir presentation is all the more important because of the fact that\r\nin the popular mind they are not accorded that significance to which\r\nthey are entitled, if, indeed, they are remembered at all.\r\n\r\nThe first great step in advance of the electricity of Franklin and his\r\ncontemporaries (and his predecessors for two thousand years) was taken\r\nvery near the end of the eighteenth century, but it must be regarded\r\nas the beginning of nineteenth-century electricity. Two Italian\r\nphilosophers, Galvani and Volta, contributed to the invention of what\r\nis known as the galvanic or voltaic battery, the output of which was\r\nnot at first distinctly recognized as the electricity of the older\r\nschools. By this beautiful discovery electricity was for the first time\r\nenslaved to man, who was now able to generate and control it at times\r\nand in such quantities as he desired. Although the voltaic battery is\r\nnow nearly obsolete as a source of electricity, its invention must\r\nalways be regarded as one of the three epoch-making events in the\r\nhistory of the science during the past one hundred and twenty years.\r\nFor three-quarters of a century it was practically the only source of\r\nelectricity, and during this time and by its use nearly all of the\r\nmost important discoveries were made. Even in the first decade of the\r\ncentury many brilliant results were reached. Among the most notable\r\nwere the researches of Sir Humphry Davy, who, by the use of the most\r\npowerful battery then constructed, resolved the hitherto unyielding\r\nalkalies, discovering sodium and potassium, and at the same time\r\nexhibited in his lectures in the Royal Institution in London the first\r\nelectric arc light, the ancestor of the millions that now turn night\r\ninto day.\r\n\r\nThe cost of generating electricity by means of a voltaic battery is\r\nrelatively very great, and this fact stood in the way of the early\r\ndevelopment of its applications, although their feasibility was\r\nperfectly well understood. Without any other important invention or\r\ndiscovery than that of the voltaic battery much would have been\r\npossible, including both electric lighting and the electric telegraph.\r\nIndeed, electric telegraphy had long been a _possibility_, even before\r\nthe time of Galvani and Volta, but its actual construction and use was\r\nalmost necessarily postponed until a second capital discovery came to\r\nremove most of the difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis was the discovery of a relation between electricity and magnetism,\r\nthe existence of which had long been suspected and earnestly sought.\r\nA Danish professor, Hans Christian Oersted, was fortunate in hitting\r\nupon an experiment which demonstrated this relation and opened up an\r\nentirely new field of investigation and invention. What Oersted found\r\nwas that when a conductor, as a copper wire, carrying an electric\r\ncurrent, was brought near a freely suspended magnet, like a compass\r\nneedle, the latter would take up a definite position with reference\r\nto the current. Thus an electric current moved a magnet, acted like a\r\nmagnet in producing a “magnetic field.” The subject was quickly taken\r\nup by almost every physicist in Europe and America. Arago found that\r\niron filings would cling to a wire through which a current was passing,\r\nand he was able to magnetize steel needles by means of the current.\r\nAmpère, another French physicist, studied Oersted’s wonderful discovery\r\nboth experimentally and mathematically, and in an incredibly short time\r\nso developed it as to deserve the title of creator of the science of\r\nelectro-dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe first to make what is known as an electro-magnet was an Englishman\r\nnamed Sturgeon, who used a bar of soft iron bent in a horseshoe form\r\n(as had long been common in making permanent steel magnets), and,\r\nafter varnishing the iron for insulation, a single coil of copper\r\nwire was wrapped about it, through which the current from a battery\r\nwas passed. There were thus two ways of producing visible motion by\r\nmeans of an electric current: that of Oersted’s simple experiment,\r\nin which a suspended magnetic needle was deflected by a current, and\r\nthat made possible by the production, at will, of an electro-magnet.\r\nThe application of both of these ideas to the construction of an\r\nelectric telegraph was quickly attempted, and two different systems of\r\ntelegraphy grew out of them. One, depending on Oersted’s experiment,\r\nwas developed in England first and afterwards in Europe; the other,\r\nthat involving the use of signals produced by an electric magnet, was\r\ndeveloped in America, and was generally known as the American method.\r\nIt has long ago superseded the first method in actual practice. Its\r\npossibility depended on perfecting the electro-magnet and especially\r\non an understanding of the principles on which that perfecting\r\ndepended. For the complete and satisfactory solution of this problem\r\nwe are indebted to the most famous student of electricity America has\r\nproduced during the century, Joseph Henry. In 1829, while a teacher in\r\nthe academy at Albany, New York, Henry exhibited an electro-magnet of\r\nenormously greater power than any before made, involving all of the\r\nessential features of the magnet of to-day. The wire was insulated\r\nby silk wrapping, and many coils were placed upon the iron core, the\r\nintensity of magnetization being thus multiplied. Henry studied, also,\r\nthe best form and arrangement of the battery under varying conditions\r\nof the conductor. An electro-magnetic telegraph had been declared\r\nimpossible in 1825, by Barlow, an Englishman, who pointed out the\r\napparently fatal fact that the resistance offered to the current was\r\nproportional to the length of the conducting wire and that the strength\r\nof the current would be thus so much reduced for even short distances\r\nas to become too feeble to be detected. Henry showed that what is known\r\nas an “intensity battery” would overcome this difficulty, discovering\r\nexperimentally and independently the beautifully simple law showing\r\nthe relation of current to electro-motive force which Ohm had announced\r\nin 1827. He also invented the principle of the relay, by which the\r\naction of a very feeble current controls the operation of a more\r\npowerful local system. It will thus be seen that the essential features\r\nof the so-called American system of telegraphy are to be credited to\r\nHenry, who had a working line in his laboratory as early as 1832.\r\n\r\nMorse made use of the scientific discoveries and inventions of Henry,\r\nand by his indefatigable labors and persistent faith the commercial\r\nvalue of the enterprise was really established. In the mean time\r\nconsiderable progress was made in Europe. Baron Schilling, a Russian\r\nCouncillor of State, devised and exhibited a needle telegraph. The\r\ntwo illustrious German physicists, Gauss and Weber, established a\r\nsuccessfully working line two or three miles long in 1833, and this\r\nsystem was commercially developed by Steinheil in 1837. In England, Sir\r\nCharles Wheatstone made many important contributions, although using\r\nthe needle system, which was afterwards abandoned. Before the middle of\r\nthe century the commercial success of the electro-magnetic telegraph\r\nwas assured, and in the matter of the transmission of messages distance\r\nwas practically annihilated.\r\n\r\nOersted, Arago, Ampère, Sturgeon, and Henry had made it possible to\r\nconvert electricity into mechanical energy. Motors of various types\r\nhad been invented, and the possibility of using the new source of\r\npower for running machinery, cars, boats, etc., was fully recognized.\r\nSeveral attempts had been made to do these things, but the great\r\ncost of producing the current by means of a battery stood in the way\r\nof success. Another epoch-making discovery was necessary, namely, a\r\nmethod of reversing the process and converting mechanical energy\r\ninto electricity. This was supplied by the genius of Michael Faraday,\r\nwho had succeeded Davy in the Royal Institution at London. In 1831\r\nFaraday discovered _induction_, the key to the modern development of\r\nelectricity. He showed that while Oersted had proved that a current of\r\nelectricity would generate a magnetic field and set a magnet in motion,\r\nthis process was reversible. A magnet set in motion in a magnetic\r\nfield by a steam-engine or any other source of power would produce,\r\nin a conductor properly arranged, a current of electricity, and thus\r\nthe dynamo came into existence. In this brilliant investigation he was\r\nalmost anticipated by Henry, who was working at Albany along the same\r\nlines, but under much less favorable conditions. Indeed, in several of\r\nthe most important points, the American actually did anticipate the\r\nEnglishman. Nearly half a century elapsed before this most important\r\ndiscovery was sufficiently developed to become commercially valuable,\r\nand it is impossible in this place to trace the steps by which, during\r\nthe last quarter of a century, the production and utilization of\r\nelectricity as existing to-day was accomplished, as a result of which\r\nthe century closed, as one might say, in a blaze of light; and it is\r\nunnecessary, because most people have witnessed the spread of the fire\r\nwhich Faraday and Henry kindled.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s discovery of induction furnished the basis of that marvellous\r\nimprovement upon the telegraph by which actual speech is transmitted\r\nover hundreds and even thousands of miles. In connection with the\r\ninvention of the telephone the names of Philip Reiss, Graham Bell,\r\nElisha Gray, and Dolbear will always be mentioned, each of whom,\r\ndoubtless independently, hit upon a way of accomplishing the result\r\nwith more or less success. To Bell, however, belongs the honor of\r\nhaving first practically solved the problem and of devising a system\r\nwhich, with numerous modifications and improvements, has come into\r\nextensive use in all parts of the world. No other application of\r\nelectricity has come into such universal use, and none has contributed\r\nmore to the comfort of life.\r\n\r\nWhile it is doubtless true that since Faraday’s time no discovery\r\ncomparable with his in real importance has been made, the past\r\ntwenty-five years have not lacked in results of scientific research,\r\nsome of which may, in the not distant future, eclipse even that in the\r\nvalue of their practical applications. Among these must be ranked Clerk\r\nMaxwell’s theory of electric waves and its beautiful verification in\r\n1888 by the young German physicist, Hertz. This brilliant student of\r\nelectricity succeeded in actually producing, detecting, and controlling\r\nthese waves, and out of this discovery has come the “wireless\r\ntelegraphy” which has been so rapidly developed within the last few\r\nyears. Many other discoveries in electricity of great scientific\r\ninterest and practical promise have been recorded in the closing years\r\nof the century, but the necessary limits of this article forbid their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNo account of the progress of physical science during the nineteenth\r\ncentury would be even approximately complete without mention of other\r\ninvestigations of profound significance. For instance, the study of\r\nthe phenomena of sound has yielded results of great scientific and\r\nsome practical value. The application of the theory of interference\r\nby Thomas Young; the publication of Helmholtz’s great work, the\r\n_Tonempfindungen_, in which his theory of harmony was first fully\r\npresented; the publication of Lord Rayleigh’s treatise; the invention\r\nand construction by König of acoustic apparatus, the best example\r\nyet furnished of scientific handicraft; all of these mark important\r\nadvances, not only in acoustics but in general physics as well. The\r\nphonautograph of Scott and König, by which a graphic record of the\r\nvibrations of the vocal chords was made possible, was ingeniously\r\nconverted by Edison into a speech recording and reproducing machine,\r\nthe phonograph, by which the most marvellous results are accomplished\r\nin the simplest possible manner.\r\n\r\nThe century is also to be credited with the discovery and development\r\nof the art of photography, which, although not of the first importance,\r\nhas contributed much to the pleasure of life, and as an aid to\r\nscientific investigation has become quite indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe wonderfully beautiful experiments of Sir William Crookes, on the\r\npassage of an electric discharge through a high vacuum, and other\r\nphenomena connected with what has been called “radiant matter,” begun\r\nabout a quarter of a century ago and continued by him and others up to\r\nthe present time, laid the foundation for the brilliant work of Röntgen\r\nin the discovery and study of the so-called “X”-rays, the real nature\r\nof which is not yet understood. Their further investigation by J. J.\r\nThomson, Becquerel, and others, seems to have revealed new forms and\r\nphases of radiation, a fuller knowledge of which is likely to throw\r\nmuch light on obscure problems relating to the nature of matter.\r\n\r\nConcerning the “Nature of Matter,” the ablest physicists of the century\r\nhave thought and written much, and doubtless our present knowledge\r\nof the subject is much more nearly the truth than that of a hundred\r\nyears ago. The molecular theory of gases has met with such complete\r\nexperimental verification, and is so in accord with all observed\r\nphenomena, that it must be accepted as essentially correct. As to\r\nthe ultimate nature of what is called matter, as distinguished from\r\nthe ethereal medium, what is known as the “vortex theory of atoms”\r\nhas received the most consideration. This theory was developed by\r\nLord Kelvin out of Helmholtz’s mathematical demonstration of the\r\nindestructibility of a vortex ring when once formed in a medium\r\npossessing the properties which are generally attributed to the ether.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable as well as the most promising fact relating\r\nto physical science at the close of the nineteenth century is the\r\ngreat and rapidly increasing number of well-organized and splendidly\r\nequipped laboratories in which original research is systematically\r\nplanned and carried out. When one reflects that for the most part\r\nduring the century just ended the advance of science was more or less\r\nof the nature of a guerrilla warfare against ignorance, it seems safe\r\nto predict for that just beginning victories more glorious than any yet\r\nwon.\r\n\r\n            T. C. MENDENHALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful how far, even if as civilians we get over our natural\r\ndislike of talking of military change as “progress,” there has been any\r\nconsiderable advance in the larger aspects of military science within\r\nthe century. The genius of Bonaparte, working upon the foundations laid\r\nby Frederick the Great, established a century ago principles which are\r\nessentially applicable to the military matters of the present day; and\r\nalthough the scientific developments of artillery and musketry have\r\naffected the dispositions of battle-fields, the essential principles of\r\nthe art of preparation for war and of strategy stand where they stood\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nScharnhorst was the Prussian officer who began to reduce the\r\nNapoleonic military system to rules applicable to the use of German\r\narmies. Under Bonaparte the whole management of the army was too\r\noften concentrated in the hands of the man of genius, and the actual\r\nmethod of Napoleon had the defect that, failing the man of genius\r\nat the head of the army, it broke down. The main change made by the\r\nGermans, who followed Scharnhorst, in the course of the century has\r\nbeen to codify the Napoleonic system so that it was possible to more\r\ngenerally decentralize in practice without impairing its essence. They\r\nhave also established a division of its supply department (under a\r\nMinister of War) from the “brain of the army,” as Mr. Spenser Wilkinson\r\nhas well called it, which manages the preparation for the strategy\r\nof war and the strategy itself. These so-called Prussian principles\r\nof decentralization and “initiative” are, however, not new and not\r\nPrussian, and may be discovered in the conversations of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. The French in 1870 had forgotten his teaching, and the\r\nGermans had retained it. It is, nevertheless, the case that the number\r\nof men placed in the field by the military powers having increased,\r\nthe intelligent initiative of corps commanders and even of generals\r\ncommanding divisions has become the more essential. It is impossible\r\nthat the great general staff can give orders in advance which will\r\ncover the responsibility of all the inferior generals, and brains\r\nhave to be added in all ranks to obedience. The commander-in-chief in\r\nthe field cannot with advantage drown himself in details, and he can\r\nonly provide in his orders an outline sketch which his subordinates\r\nin various parts of the field of operations have to fill in. The\r\n“initiative of subordinates” is but the natural division of labor.\r\n\r\nIf I, a civilian student of military politics, rather than a military\r\nexpert, have been called upon to write upon the military progress of\r\nthe century, it must be because of a desire to bring largely into the\r\naccount the changes in military organization which on the continent\r\nof Europe have made it permanently national, and which in the United\r\nStates made it temporarily national during the Civil War, and would\r\nmake it so again in the event of any fresh struggle on a great scale in\r\nwhich the North American continent might become involved.\r\n\r\nAlthough the “armed nation” has replaced in France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Roumania, and Bulgaria the smaller\r\nprofessional armies of the eighteenth century, the popular belief that\r\nthe numerical strength of field armies has enormously increased is not\r\nso completely well founded as at first sight might be supposed. It is\r\ntrue that each nation can put into the entire field of warfare larger\r\nnumbers than that nation could put into the field a century ago.\r\nBut it is still not beyond the bounds of possibility that in certain\r\ncases small armies may produce results as remarkable as those which\r\nattended British operations in the Peninsula in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century, and, on the other hand, although there will, upon\r\nthe whole, in future continental wars, be larger armies in the field,\r\nno one general is likely personally to handle or to place upon a field\r\nof battle a larger army than that with which Napoleon traversed Europe\r\nbefore he invaded Russia.\r\n\r\nThe principles of pure military science as set forth in books have\r\nnot been greatly changed during the nineteenth century. The Prussian\r\nClausewitz only explained for us the doctrines of Bonaparte; and the\r\nlatest writers—such as the Frenchmen Derrécagaix and Lewal—only\r\ncontinue Clausewitz. The theory of the armed nation has received\r\nextension, but, after all, the Prussian system in its essentials\r\ndates from Jena, and the steps by which it has produced the admirable\r\nexisting armies of France, Austria, and Roumania have been but slow.\r\n\r\nThe United States stand apart. Their resources are so fabulously great\r\nthat they and they alone are able to wait for war before making war\r\npreparations. No power will attack the United States. All powers will\r\nsubmit to many things and yield many strong points rather than fight\r\nthe United States. The only territorial neighbors of the republic\r\nare not only not in a position to enter into military rivalry with\r\nher on the American continent, but are not advancing their military\r\nestablishments with the growth of their or of her population. They are\r\nof themselves not only unable to attack, but equally unable in the long\r\nrun effectively to resist her.\r\n\r\nThe whole question, then, unfortunately for us Europeans, is a\r\nEuropean question, and I need make but little reference to happier\r\nlands across the greater seas.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the United Kingdom stands absolutely apart. The existence of\r\nthe British Empire depends less upon our armies than on our fleets.\r\nIndia is garrisoned by a small but costly army, sufficient for present\r\nneeds, but insufficient to meet their probable growth. The home army,\r\nkept mainly in England and Ireland (and in Ireland now only because\r\nlife is cheap in Ireland and the country healthy and well fitted for\r\nthe drill and discipline of troops), has been chiefly a nursery for the\r\nwhite army in India, and will be for that in South Africa and in India.\r\nThe expeditions which the country is obliged to send from time to time\r\nacross the seas have but a domestic interest, and are unimportant when\r\nviewed from a world-wide military stand-point. In the event of war the\r\nattention of the country would be concentrated upon her fleets, with a\r\nview to retain that command of the sea without which her old-fashioned\r\narmy would be useless.\r\n\r\nBelgium has an old-fashioned army of another type. A small force of\r\nconscripts is “drawn” and the men are allowed to find substitutes for\r\nmoney. But Belgium and the other smaller Powers, except Switzerland,\r\nRoumania, and Bulgaria, may be neglected in our survey. Switzerland has\r\ndeveloped an excellent army of a special local type, a cheap but highly\r\nefficient militia, the most interesting point about which is that,\r\nwhile field artillery is supposed to be difficult of creation and only\r\nto be obtained upon a costly and regular system, Switzerland produces\r\nan excellent field artillery upon a militia footing. The garrison\r\nartillery militia of Great Britain have longer training than the field\r\nartillery of the Swiss Federation, but the results of the training\r\nare very different. Similarly, while cavalry is supposed to be in the\r\nsame position as artillery in these matters, Hungary produces a good\r\ncavalry upon a militia system. It is, however, to the native army in\r\nIndia that we have to turn if we want to see what long service cavalry\r\nin past centuries used to be, for in these days of shorter service\r\ncavalry at least has suffered a decline, and, so far from cavalry, on\r\nthe whole, presenting us with a picture of military progress in the\r\ncentury, the cavalry of the present day is not to be compared with the\r\ncavalry of the past. Roumania and Bulgaria, although small countries,\r\nhave remarkable armies of the most modern type, of great strength\r\nwhen considered proportionately to their populations; but these need\r\nnot come under our examination, because substantially they are on the\r\nPrussian plan.\r\n\r\nRussia differs from Germany, France, and Austria in having an immense\r\npeace army. Her peace army is indeed as large as that of the whole\r\nof the Triple Alliance, and the enormous distances of Russia and the\r\ndifficulties of mobilization and concentration force her into the\r\nretention and development of a system which is now peculiar to herself.\r\nThe armies of Russia resemble more closely (although on a far larger\r\nscale) the old armies of the time before the changes which followed\r\n1866 than the French, German, and Austrian armies of to-day. Italy is\r\ndecreasing her army, and has been driven by her financial straits to\r\ncompletely spoil a system which was never good except on paper. It is\r\ndoubtful whether now in a sudden war the Italians could put into the\r\nfield any thoroughly good troops, except their Alpine battalions, which\r\nare equal to those of the French. The Austrian system does not differ\r\nsufficiently from those of Germany and of France to be worthy special\r\nnote, although it may be said in passing that the Austrian army is now\r\nconsidered by competent observers to be excellent. We may take as our\r\ntype of the armies of to-day those of Germany and of France. These\r\narmies are also normal as regards their cost. Great Britain having no\r\nconscription, and being in the habit of paying dearly for all services,\r\nis extravagant in her military expenditure for the results obtained.\r\nSwitzerland and Russia, with their different systems, and for different\r\nreasons, obtain their armies very cheaply; and if we wish to know the\r\ncost of the modern military system it is to Germany and to France that\r\nwe should turn.\r\n\r\nThose who would study the French or German army for themselves will\r\nfind a large literature on the subject. The principles which govern\r\nthe establishment of an armed nation upon the modern Prussian scale,\r\nimproved after the experiences of 1866 and again after those of 1870,\r\nare explained in the work of Von der Goltz, _The Nation in Arms_. Those\r\nwho would follow these principles into their detailed application, and\r\nsee how the armies are divided between, and nourished and supplied from\r\nthe military districts of one of the great countries, will find the\r\nfacts set forth in such publications as the illustrated _Annual of the\r\nFrench Army_, published each year by Plon, Nourrit, et Cie., or in the\r\nofficial handbooks published by the Librairie Militaire Baudoin.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Bonaparte and even in the time of the Second Empire in\r\nFrance army corps were of varying strength, and there was no certain\r\nknowledge on the part of administrators less admirable than the first\r\nNapoleon himself of the exact numbers of men who could be placed in\r\nthe field. In 1870 Louis Napoleon was wholly misinformed as to his\r\nown strength and as to that of his opponents, which were, however,\r\naccurately known to Von Moltke. In these days such confusions and\r\ndifficulties are impossible. The army corps of the great military\r\npowers are of equal strength and would be equally reinforced in the\r\nextraordinarily rapid mobilization which would immediately precede and\r\nimmediately follow a declaration of war. The chief changes in the\r\ncentury have been a greater exactitude in these respects, a general\r\nincrease of numbers (especially a great increase in the strength of\r\nfield artillery), and in these last years a grouping of the army corps\r\ninto armies, which exist in Germany, France, and Russia even in time of\r\npeace, with all their generals and staffs named ready for war. In each\r\nof the great military countries the army is guided by the counsel of a\r\ngeneral staff. Around the chief of the staff and the Minister of War\r\nare the “generals of armies,” and in France a potential generalissimo\r\n(who on the outbreak of war would often be superseded by another\r\ngeneral in the actual command). In the case of Germany the command\r\nwould now be exercised by the young Emperor. In the case of France it\r\nwould be exercised by the generalissimo, with the chief of the staff\r\nas his “Berthier” or major-general. Enormously important duties in the\r\ncase of armies so unwieldy as the entire forces of the first line and\r\nof the second line in Germany or France and of the first line in Russia\r\nwould be exercised by the “generals of armies.” These generals in time\r\nof peace are called “inspectors of armies” in France, Germany, and\r\nAustria, and they inspect groups of army corps which would be united\r\nin war to form the armies which these generals would actually command.\r\nThese generals also form the council of war or principal promotion\r\nboard and committee of advice for the generalissimo and chief of the\r\nstaff. In Germany and in Austria-Hungary the German Emperor and the\r\nEmperor-King respectively are virtual general inspectors-in-chief of\r\nthe whole army, but in France and in Russia there is less unity of\r\ncommand. The Minister of War in Russia, in Germany, and in France is\r\nintended to be at the head of the supplies of the army in time of war,\r\ndirecting the administration from the capital, and not taking his place\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian system, as far as the men are concerned, was adopted\r\nafter the disasters of Prussia early in the century, in order to pass\r\ngreat numbers of men through the ranks without attracting attention by\r\nkeeping up a large peace army. The system is now maintained by Germany,\r\nAustria, and France for a different reason. Such powers desire to\r\nhave an enormous force for war, but, for budgetary reasons, to keep\r\nwith the flag in time of peace the smallest force which is consistent\r\nwith training the men sufficiently to enable them upon mobilization\r\nto be brought back to their regiments as real soldiers. It is these\r\nconsiderations which have induced the younger and more thoughtful of\r\nthe Prussian generals to force on Germany a reduction of the period\r\nof infantry service to two years. The army in time of peace becomes\r\na mere training-school for war, and the service is made as short as\r\npossible, given the necessity of turning out a man who for some years\r\nwill continue to have the traditions of a soldier. It is a question\r\nwhether something has not been sacrificed, in France, at all events,\r\nto uniformity. A longer period of training is undoubtedly necessary\r\nto make an efficient cavalry soldier than is necessary to make an\r\nefficient infantry private; and a man who has served about two and a\r\nhalf years only in a cavalry regiment cannot in the majority of cases\r\nbe brought back into the cavalry after he has returned to civil life.\r\nCavalry, in the modern armies, is likely to be a diminishing force as\r\nwar goes on. The armies will enter upon war with a number of infantry\r\nwhich can be kept up, the losses of war being supplied by reserve men\r\nas good as the men of the first line; but each army will enter upon\r\nwar with a force of cavalry which will be rapidly destroyed if it is\r\nmuch used, and which will not be replaced in the same manner. The\r\nreserve cavalry of which the French press boasts is a paper force,\r\nand the pretended mobilization of two of its regiments a farce. The\r\nFrench would take the field with the cavalry of the first line only,\r\nseventy-nine regiments of five hundred horses (all over six years old),\r\nor less than half the eighty-four thousand cavalry with which Napoleon\r\nmarched in 1812. The same thing might possibly be said of artillery as\r\nis said of cavalry but for the fact that Switzerland tells a different\r\nstory as to the possibility of rapidly training artillerymen with a\r\nconsiderable measure of success. The French improvised artillery of the\r\nlatter part of the war of 1870 were also a creditable force, while it\r\nwas discovered to be impossible to create a cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the reserves in France, Germany, and Austria is\r\ntested by the calling out of large portions of them every year for\r\ntraining, and they are found, as far as the infantry go, thoroughly\r\ncompetent for the work of war. The difficulties as regards cavalry are\r\nso obvious that it is becoming more and more recognized by Germany\r\nand by France that the cavalry will have to take the field as they\r\nstand in peace, and that their reserve men will have to be kept back\r\nwith a view to the selection among them of those who are fit to serve\r\nas cavalry, and the relegation of the greater number to the train\r\nand other services where ability to ride and manage horses is more\r\nnecessary than the smartness of a good cavalryman. France and Germany\r\nnominally look forward to the creation of two kinds of armies in time\r\nof war, one of the first line to take the field at once, and the other\r\nto guard the communications and garrison and support the fortresses,\r\nbut in fact it is the intention of these powers to divide their armies\r\ninto three—a field army of the first line, a field army of the second\r\nline, out of which fresh army corps will at once be created on the\r\noutbreak of war, and, thirdly, a territorial army for communications\r\nand for fortress purposes and as a last reserve. It is a portion of the\r\nFrench and German system that each army corps of the first line—and\r\nthe same would be the case in war with the second line corps—has its\r\nseparate organization of ammunition train and baggage train, and draws\r\nas largely as possible its supplies from its own territorial district.\r\n\r\nThe peace strength of the great modern armies is for France and Germany\r\nabout five hundred thousand men each, and the war strength between four\r\nmillion and five million men each. The peace strength of Russia is now\r\nover nine hundred thousand men. Of the war armies the training is not\r\nuniformly complete, but there are in Germany, France, Austria, and\r\nRoumania sufficient reserves of clothing and rifles to equip the war\r\narmies of those powers for the field.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the system of a modern army is very much less than that\r\nof the old-fashioned armies. The United Kingdom spent till lately\r\n(including loan money) about eighteen million pounds sterling upon\r\nher army, India rarely less than fourteen million pounds sterling and\r\nan average of fifteen million pounds, and the British Empire, outside\r\nthe United Kingdom and India, two million pounds, or an average of\r\nthirty-five million pounds sterling in all upon land forces. The\r\nexpenditure of the United Kingdom upon land forces has been permanently\r\nincreased to an enormous extent by the South African war and cannot now\r\nbe estimated. The expenditure of France and Germany upon land forces is\r\ngreatly less; and of Russia, large as is her peace army, less again.\r\nBut France and Germany in the event of war can immediately each of them\r\nplace millions of armed men in the field in proper army formation and\r\nwith adequate command, whereas the United Kingdom can place a doubtful\r\nthree corps in the field in India with great difficulty, and, in the\r\ntrue sense of the word, no organized force at all at home without\r\nan incredible amount of reorganization and waste of time after the\r\ndeclaration of war. It is contended by the authorities responsible\r\nfor the British army that two army corps could be placed in the field\r\nat home, and elaborate paper arrangements exist for this purpose; but\r\nthe facts are as I state them, and not as they are professed to be.\r\nIt is pretended that three corps of regulars were despatched to South\r\nAfrica. But the cavalry and artillery were, in fact, created by lavish\r\nexpenditure a long time after the war had begun and after disasters\r\ncaused by their non-existence.\r\n\r\nCentralized as is the administrative system of France and Germany\r\nin everything except war, the necessities of modern warfare have\r\nforced upon the governments of those countries a large amount of\r\ndecentralization as concerns military matters, and the less efficient\r\nmilitary machines of the United Kingdom and of Russia are far more\r\ncentralized than are the more efficient machines of Germany and of\r\nFrance. The army corps districts have in the latter countries so much\r\nautonomy as to recall to the political student the federal organization\r\nof the United States rather than the government of a highly centralized\r\nmodern power. As soon, however, as war breaks out, the military states\r\nof time of peace would be grouped, and the four or five groups known\r\nas “armies,” also, of course, theoretically, brought together under\r\nthe directing eye of the generalissimo. In the case, at all events, of\r\nGermany, unity of direction is perfectly combined with decentralization\r\nand individual initiative.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which a modern army on the anticipation of war prepares\r\nitself for the field is extraordinarily rapid in point of time as\r\ncompared with the mode found necessary in the time of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte; and it is this rapidity of mobilization and concentration\r\nwhich strikes the observer as the greatest change or progress of the\r\ncentury in connection with armies. But it is a mere consequence of\r\nrailroads and telegraphs, and is only the application to military\r\npurposes of those increased facilities of locomotion which have\r\nplayed so great a part in the progress of the century. Mobilization\r\nis, of course, the union at points fixed beforehand of the men of the\r\nreserves who bring the army up to its war footing, and the clothing and\r\nequipment of these men, and the distribution to the mobilized regiments\r\nof their full materials of war. The cavalry and horse artillery kept\r\nupon the frontier are now in a condition of permanent readiness in\r\nthe principal military countries, as they would be used to cover the\r\nmobilization of the remainder of the army. The moment mobilization is\r\naccomplished concentration takes place—on the frontier in the case of\r\nthe principal powers. Near the line of concentration are forts, which\r\nplay a greater part in the French scheme of defence than they do in\r\nthe German. The French in the days of their weakness after 1870 both\r\nconstructed a line of intrenched camps and built a kind of wall of\r\nChina along the most exposed portion of their eastern frontier; whereas\r\nthe Germans are prepared to rely upon their field armies, supported by\r\na few immense fortresses, such as those (on their western frontier) of\r\nMetz and Strasburg. The French keep in front of their fortresses at\r\nNancy a strong division, which is virtually always on a war footing,\r\nand both in France and Germany the frontier corps are at a higher peace\r\nstrength than those of the interior, and are meant to take the field\r\nat once so as to help the cavalry and horse artillery to protect the\r\nmobilization and concentration of the remainder, and, if possible, to\r\ndisturb the mobilization and concentration of the foe. Those who would\r\nstudy modern armies for themselves should visit Nancy and Metz, but\r\nshould not neglect the Swiss annual manœuvres.\r\n\r\nThe work of the recruit of Germany and of France, during his two years’\r\nor nearly three years’ training as the case may be, is as hard as any\r\nhuman work; and the populations of the continental countries submit,\r\nnot on the whole unwillingly, from patriotic motives, to a slavery\r\nof which the more fortunate inhabitants of the United Kingdom and of\r\nthe United States have no conception. The British or the Belgian paid\r\nrecruit would mutiny if forced to work as works the virtually unpaid\r\nand ill-fed recruit of Russia, Germany, Austria, and France. The\r\nenormous loss to many industries which is caused by the withdrawal of\r\nthe men at the age of twenty, just when they are most apt to become\r\nskilled workmen, is in the opinion of some Germans compensated for by\r\nthe habit of discipline and the moral tone of stiffness and endurance\r\nwhich is communicated to the soldier for the rest of his life. This is\r\nperhaps more true of the German character than it is of the inhabitants\r\nof the other countries; and in France, at least, the soldier training\r\nof the entire population is a heavy drawback to industrial and\r\nto intellectual life. There are, however, as will be seen in the\r\nconcluding passage of this article, other considerations to be taken\r\ninto account, some of which tell the other way.\r\n\r\nThe one successful exception to the prevailing military system of the\r\nday is to be found in Switzerland, which has a very cheap army of the\r\nmilitia type, but one which is, nevertheless, pronounced efficient by\r\nthe best judges. The mobilization of Switzerland in 1870 was more rapid\r\nthan that of either Germany or France, and, great as are the strides\r\nthat both France and Germany have made in rapidity of organization\r\nand as regards numbers since 1870, the Swiss also have reorganized\r\ntheir mobilization system since that time, and are still able, at a\r\nmuch less proportional cost, to place in the field at least as large a\r\nproportional force as Germany, and this force believed to be efficient,\r\nalthough not largely provided with cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change in the battle-fields of the future, as compared\r\nwith those of a few years ago, will be found in the development and\r\nincreased strength of the artillery. A modern army, when it takes up a\r\nposition, has miles of front almost entirely occupied with guns, and\r\nthe guns have to fire over the infantry, because there is no room for\r\nsuch numbers of guns to be used in any other way. The attacking side\r\n(if both, indeed, in one form or another, do not attempt attack) will\r\nbe chiefly occupied in obtaining positions on which to place its guns,\r\nand the repeating-rifle itself, deadly as is its fire, cannot contend\r\nat ranges over a thousand yards, unless the riflemen are heavily\r\nintrenched, with the improved shrapnel fire of modern guns. The early\r\nengagements of a war will, indeed, be engagements of cavalry massed\r\nupon the frontier on the second day of mobilization, so rapid will the\r\nopening of war in the future be. This cavalry will be accompanied by\r\nhorse artillery and followed by light infantry, constantly practised in\r\nrapid marching in time of peace, or by mounted infantry. But the great\r\nbattle-fields of the later weeks will be battle-fields, above all, of\r\nartillery. The numbers engaged will be so great that the heaviest of\r\nall the responsibilities of the generals will be the feeding of their\r\ntroops during the battles prolonged during several days, which will\r\nprobably occur, and it is doubtful how far the old generals (often\r\ngrown unwieldy in time of peace) will be able to stand the daily\r\nand nightly strain of war. Jomini has said that when both sides are\r\nequally strong in numbers, in courage, and in many other elements of\r\nforce, the great tragedy of Borodino is the typical battle. Lewal\r\nhas pointed out that in the battles of the future such equality must\r\nbe expected: “The battle will begin on the outbreak of war in the\r\noperations of the frontier regiments. The great masses as they come\r\nto the field will pour into a fight already raging. The battle will\r\nbe immense and prolonged.” Promotion will probably be rapid among the\r\ngenerals, owing to incompetence and retirement, and certainly among\r\nother officers owing to their exposure in these days of smokeless\r\npowder, when good shots can pick off officers in a manner unknown in\r\nwars which have hitherto occurred. Whether it will be possible to get\r\narmies to advance under heavy fire after the officers have been killed\r\nis doubtful, when we remember that modern armies consist of the whole\r\npopulation, cowards and brave men alike, and that regimental cohesion\r\nis weakened by the sudden infusion of an overwhelming proportion of\r\nreserve men at the last moment. On the other hand, in the German army\r\nthe reserve men will be fewer in the first line than in the French, and\r\nthe regimental system more available in the field, while on the French\r\nside the greater military aptitude of the French race may perhaps be\r\ncounted upon to remedy the comparative defect. The Prussians make up\r\nfor the inferior military aptitude of the German people by patriotism,\r\ndiscipline, and the conferring of honor and of civil employment, in\r\nafter life, on all who do their duty in war. They also provide more\r\neffectively than do the French against incapacity in high place. Above\r\nall, however, we should attach importance to the wisdom of successive\r\nKings of Prussia in treating the Prussian army as an almost sacred\r\ninstitution, and in constantly working in time of peace to make it and\r\nkeep it a perfect instrument of war.\r\n\r\nThe weakest point, relatively speaking, in the French organization,\r\nand the strongest point, relatively speaking, in the German, is the\r\nofficering of the second and third line. The one-year-volunteer system\r\ngives the Germans excellent “territorial” officers, while the French\r\nhave been forced virtually to abolish it as impossible of successful\r\napplication in a country so jealous of privilege as is modern France.\r\nThe territorial infantry regiments of France would be excellent for\r\nthe defence of fortresses, but would for field purposes be inferior\r\nto that part of the Prussian landwehr which would remain over after\r\nthe completion of the reserve corps. The reserve cavalry regiments of\r\nFrance have been created in order to provide promotion and sinecure\r\nappointments, and would not produce a cavalry fit for true cavalry\r\nservice in the field. It would carry us beyond the proper limits of\r\nthis article to explain how it is that the French could create a field\r\nartillery of the second line in time of war which would probably be\r\nsuperior to that of Germany. This forms a set-off against some other\r\ninferiority of the French.\r\n\r\nThe newest point in the development of modern armies is the recent\r\nseparation in the German army of the cavalry intended for patrol duties\r\nfrom the cavalry intended for fighting in the field. We have had to\r\nface the same problem in South Africa, but this condition of our war\r\nwas peculiar.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the history of warfare is the history of the\r\nstruggle among weapons, and that each change in tactics and even in\r\nstrategy has come from scientific change affecting weapons. In the\r\ncentury we have seen the change from the smooth-bore to the rifle\r\nand from the ordinary to the repeating rifle. We have seen the\r\nmodifications of artillery, which are beginning to give an application\r\nof the quick-firing principle to field artillery, and the use of high\r\nexplosive shells, likely to affect by their explosion even those who\r\nare near the bursting shell and who are not struck by its fragments.\r\nSmokeless powder has altered the look of battles and has reduced their\r\nnoise. It provides excuse for the incompetent. It would be easy,\r\nhowever, to exaggerate the importance of these changes as regards\r\ntactics, and still more with regard to strategy, while with tactics we\r\nare not here concerned. The great continental military nations have\r\nhitherto not allowed themselves to be much affected by the changes in\r\nthe weapons, and many of the modern fads which are adopted in small\r\narmies are condemned by the leaders of these great forces. The British\r\nmachine guns, for example, like British mounted infantry, are generally\r\nregarded on the continent as a fancy of our own. All nations have their\r\nmilitary fads, except, perhaps, the severely practical Germans. Russia\r\nhas its dragoon organization, from which it is receding; America has\r\nher dynamite gun; the French have their submarine torpedo-boats. Our\r\nmachine guns are not thought much more of by most Prussians than the\r\nsteam-gun of 1844, ridiculed by Dickens in _Martin Chuzzlewit_. If\r\ngreat change was to have been made in the art of war by modern weapons,\r\none would have thought that the first things to disappear would be all\r\nvestige of protective armor and the use of cavalry in the field. Yet\r\nprotective armor has been recently restored to as large a proportion\r\nof many armies as used it in the wars of the beginning of the century,\r\nand the use of cavalry in the field is defended as still possible by\r\nall the highest authorities on the continent. My own opinion on such\r\nmatters is that of a layman and should be worthless, but it agrees with\r\nthat of several distinguished military writers. I confess that I doubt\r\nwhether in future wars between good armies, such as those of France and\r\nGermany, it will be possible to employ cavalry on the field of battle,\r\nand I go so far as to think that the direct offensive, still believed\r\nin by the Prussians, will be found to have become too costly to be\r\npossible. Our South African experience is not, however, regarded by\r\ncontinental authorities as conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe author of _Ironclads in Action_, Mr. Wilson, who has made a very\r\nthorough study of the future of naval war, has pointed out with great\r\nforce the most striking difficulties of war in the future as caused by\r\nthe enormous concentration of forces in a particular tract of country.\r\nThe result of that concentration must be great difficulties about\r\nsupply, prolonged battles of an indecisive kind leading to exposure,\r\nabsence of sleep, and to conditions which would form the severest\r\nstrain for professional men of war, while those who will now be subject\r\nto them will be the ordinary population, not very specially warriors,\r\nexcept so far as patriotism may in some cases make up as regards\r\ncourage and endurance for absence of military tradition. The vast\r\nnumber of wounded will be exposed for longer periods than was the case\r\nin many of the earlier wars; but when we remember Leipsic, and Dresden,\r\nand the retreat from Moscow, it is again easy to see that the change\r\nis rather in the direction of generalization of conditions, which\r\nwere formerly exceptional, than a change to conditions wholly without\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nI have all through this article written of Germany and France as the\r\nmodern military countries to be taken as a standard in all comparisons.\r\nThe French have imitated the Germans very closely since the war of\r\n1870. But, although imitation is generally feeble, it must always be\r\nborne in mind that the French people have greater military aptitude\r\nthan the German, and that unless beaten at the beginning of a war they\r\nare always in the highest degree formidable. The perfection of system\r\nis to be found in Germany, and the peculiarities of the German system\r\nare the combination of enlightened patriotism in all its individuality\r\nwith iron discipline. The system is so strong that unless well managed\r\nit would crush out individual responsibility; but the system itself\r\nencourages this individual responsibility all down the gradations of\r\nthe army to the humblest non-commissioned officer and even to the\r\ndetached private. The universality of promotion by a certain high\r\nstandard of merit and the absence of jobbery are more thoroughly\r\nobtained in Germany than in any other army, and Lord Wolseley’s\r\ncriticisms on the 1898 manœuvres of our own army, criticisms renewed in\r\n1900, in which he told us that no one had done well in the field, and\r\nthat this proved that no one could have done his duty during the past\r\nyear, would be impossible in Germany, and must have shocked military\r\nopinion throughout that country.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to assume that the enormous military establishments\r\nof the continent of Europe are an almost unmixed evil. But this may\r\nperhaps be disputed on two grounds. In some cases, such as that of\r\nItaly, the army acts as a kind of rough national university in which\r\nthe varied life of districts often discordant is fused into a patriotic\r\nwhole, dialects are forgotten, and a common language learned. In\r\nthe case of France the new military system is a powerful engine of\r\ndemocracy. There is a French prince (not of the blood) serving at\r\nthis moment in a squad of which the corporal is a young peasant from\r\nthe same department. A few years ago I found the Duc de Luynes, who\r\nis also Duc de Chaulnes and Duc de Chevreuse, the owner of Dampierre,\r\nthe personal friend of kings, serving, by his own wish, for, as the\r\neldest son of a widow, he was exempt, as a private of dragoons, and\r\nrespectfully saluting young officers, some of whom were his own\r\ntenants. The modern military system of the continent, in the case of\r\nFrance and Germany at least, may also, I think, be shown to have told\r\nin favor of peace. It is possible for us to occasionally demand a war\r\nwith the greater freedom, because we do not as a rule know what war\r\nmeans. Those of us who have seen something of it with our own eyes are\r\na very small minority. But every inhabitant of France and Germany has\r\nthe reality of war brought home to him with the knowledge that those\r\nof his own kin would have to furnish their tribute of “cannon flesh”\r\n(as the French and Germans call it) at the outbreak of any war; and the\r\ninfluence of the whole of the women of both countries is powerfully\r\nexerted in consequence upon the side of peace.\r\n\r\n            CHARLES W. DILKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL SHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the conditions of naval warfare the century now closed has seen a\r\nrevolution unparalleled in the rapidity of the transition and equalled\r\nin degree only by the changes which followed the general introduction\r\nof cannon and the abandonment of oars in favor of sails for the\r\npropulsion of ships of war. The latter step was consequent, ultimately,\r\nupon the discovery of the New World and of the sea-passage to India by\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. The voyage to those distant regions was too long\r\nand the remoteness from ports of refuge too great for rowing galleys, a\r\nclass of vessels whose construction unfitted them for developing great\r\nsize and for contending with heavy weather. The change of motive power\r\nmade possible and entailed a different disposition of the fighting\r\npower, the main battery weight of ships being transferred from the bows\r\nand sterns—end-on fire—to the broadsides. The combination of these\r\ntwo new factors caused ships and fleets necessarily to be fought in a\r\ndifferent manner from formerly—entailed, to use the technical word,\r\nnew tactics.\r\n\r\nThe innovations thus briefly mentioned, though equally radical, were\r\nmuch more gradual in their progress than those witnessed by our\r\ngeneration. The latter have occurred not merely within the lifetime but\r\nwithin the memory of many who are still among us. They are embraced,\r\neasily and entirely, within the reign of Queen Victoria. It has been\r\nsaid, plausibly, that if a naval officer who died half a century ago\r\ncould revisit the earth he would find himself more at home in the ships\r\nof Elizabeth than in those of her present successor. No such sudden\r\nand sharp contrast troubled the seamen of the earlier era. It is true\r\nand interesting to note that the battle of Lepanto in 1573, although a\r\nfew vessels of broadside type therein exercised a decisive influence,\r\nwas fought chiefly by galleys, while in the contest with the Spanish\r\nArmada in the English Channel fifteen years later sailing ships played\r\nthe leading part; but while the fact gives a valuable assistance to\r\nprecision of memory by fixing an approximate date when the one type was\r\ndefinitely supplanted by the other, it remains that the turning-point\r\nthus indicated was reached long after cannon and sails first were\r\nused afloat, and that another century elapsed before the galley was\r\ndefinitively abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF THE TRANSITION\r\n\r\nA few dates will illustrate the swiftness of our recent\r\ntransformations. In 1838, when the French navy reduced San Juan de\r\nUlloa, the principal defence of Vera Cruz, and in 1840, in the British\r\nattack upon Acre, the fighting power was wholly in sailing ships\r\nsuch as had fought at Trafalgar thirty-five years before. Two small\r\npaddle steamers towed the French frigate into position, while the\r\nfour British vessels of the same type contributed only a desultory\r\naddition to the broadsides of seven sailing ships of the line, which\r\ncompelled the surrender of the fortress. The first screw ship of the\r\nline in the British navy was launched in 1852; the last sailing ship\r\nof that class went out of commission in 1860. All alike, the ships of\r\nVera Cruz and of Acre, and their short-reigning successors, the steam\r\nfrigates and ships of the line, are now as much things of the past,\r\nin sails, in engines, and in guns, as are the galleys of Lepanto and\r\nthe ships of the Armada. By 1870 it had been recognized everywhere\r\nthat a type of vessel corresponding in essential features with the\r\npresent armored battle-ships had displaced all competitors. The span\r\nof a single generation had seen the transition of the ships of Drake\r\nand Nelson to those of our own day. The career of Farragut was run in\r\nthe intermediate period. His success for the most part was achieved and\r\nhis renown won with vessels substantially of the older type, but with\r\nauxiliary steam-power.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to remark that this seemingly abrupt transition\r\nis but one incident in the startling progress made during the century\r\nin all the arts of peace as of war. Like the others, it is due to an\r\nintellectual activity, greater probably than that of our predecessors,\r\nand directed since the peace of 1815 less upon external political\r\ninterests than upon scientific investigation, and upon the application\r\nof the results to the improvement of processes of every kind. The\r\nchanges in conception and in development of the instruments of naval\r\nwarfare result from the increased power of dealing with refractory\r\nmaterial which has been acquired by scientific and practical men in\r\nthe laboratory and the workshop. Thus viewed, though so rapid in\r\nrealization as to amount to a revolution, not only is the change\r\nseen to be the outcome of a long, though silent preparation, but it\r\nis brought also into its due relation to the general movement of the\r\nage, and found to share its special characteristics. Our ancestors of\r\nthe eighteenth century had their own problems, noble and absorbing,\r\nbut chiefly political in character. While new worlds were being\r\ngathered into the embrace of European civilization, the leading powers\r\nstruggling among themselves for pre-eminence in the work, and while\r\nthe harvest was ripening for the French Revolution, science crept\r\nforward, but slowly and silently, the pre-occupation of the few, not\r\nthe interest of the many.\r\n\r\nThe object of the present article is to describe the type of war vessel\r\nprevalent universally among civilized nations when the nineteenth\r\ncentury opened, and to trace historically the sequence of ideas and of\r\nfacts which have resulted in the type whose general acceptance is seen\r\nnow in the practice of the chief naval states.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILING SHIPS AND BROADSIDE BATTERIES\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century began, the ships that contended for the\r\ncontrol of the sea were, and for two centuries had been, sailing\r\nships with broadside batteries: the guns, that is, were distributed\r\nalong both sides from the bow to the stern on one, two, three, or\r\nfour decks. From the largest down, all were of this type until the\r\nvery smallest class was reached. In the latter, which could scarcely\r\nbe considered fighting ships, the gun power was at times concentrated\r\ninto a single piece, which swept from side to side round the horizon,\r\nthus anticipating partially the modern turreted ironclad with its\r\nconcentrated revolving battery.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of guns in broadside involved anomalies and\r\ninconveniences which seem most singular when first noted. A ship in\r\nchase of another, for instance, had no guns which threw straight ahead.\r\nIf it were wished to fire, in order to cripple the fleeing enemy,\r\nit was necessary to deflect from the course; and in order to bring\r\nmost of the guns on one side into play the vessel had to swing round\r\nnearly at right angles to the direction of pursuit. This, of course,\r\nlost both time and ground. Broadside fire—the distribution of guns\r\nin broadside—rests, however, upon an unchangeable condition, which\r\ncontrols now as it did a century ago. Ships then were from three to\r\nfour times as long as they were broad; the proportion now is, length\r\nfrom four to six times the breadth—or beam, as it is technically\r\ncalled. Therefore, except in small vessels, where the concentration\r\nof the whole weight that can be carried in battery gave but one piece\r\neffective against a probable target, a full development of fire\r\nrequired the utilization of the long side of the ship rather than of\r\nits short cross-section. This is precisely analogous to the necessity\r\nthat an army has of deploying into line, from any order of march, in\r\norder to develop its full musketry fire. The mechanical attainment of\r\nthe last century did not permit the construction of single guns that\r\nwould contain the weight of the whole battery of a big ship: but even\r\nhad it, guns are not wanted bigger than will penetrate their target\r\nmost effectively. When an ounce of lead will kill a man it is useless\r\nto fire a pound. The limit of penetration once reached, it is numbers,\r\nnot size, that tell: and numbers could be had only by utilizing\r\nthe broadside. This condition remains operative now; but as modern\r\nbattle-ships present two or more kinds of target—the heavy armored\r\nand that which is light armored, or unprotected—the application of\r\nthe principle in practice becomes more complicated. Batteries now are\r\nnecessarily less homogeneous than they once were, because targets vary\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISAPPEARANCE OF BOW FIRE\r\n\r\nThe adoption of broadside batteries followed, therefore, necessarily\r\nupon increase of size and consequent length, but not upon that only. It\r\nis instructive to observe that the sailing fighting ship was derived,\r\nin part, at least, from the galley, and its resemblance in form to the\r\nlatter is traceable for at least a century after the general disuse\r\nof the oar. As the galley, however, was small, it could concentrate\r\nits fire advantageously in one or two pieces, for which small number\r\nthe cross-section offered a sufficient line of emplacement: and as,\r\nwhen it could move at all, it could move in any direction, there was a\r\nfurther advantage in being able to fire in the direction of its motion.\r\nHence, bow fire prevailed in galleys to the end, although the great\r\ngalleasses of Lepanto and the Armada had accepted broadside batteries\r\nin great part, and whenever the galley type has recurred, as on Lake\r\nChamplain during our Revolutionary War, bow fire has predominated. The\r\nsailing ship, on the contrary, was limited as to the direction in which\r\nshe could move. Taking her as the centre of a circle, she could not\r\nsteer directly for much more than half the points on the circumference.\r\nBow fire consequently was much less beneficial to her, and, further,\r\nit was found that, for reasons not necessary to particularize, her\r\nsailing, steering, and manœuvring were greatly benefited by the\r\nleverage of sails carried on the bowsprit and its booms, projecting\r\nforward of the bow, where they interfered decisively with right-ahead\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, bow fire disappeared and broadside fire\r\nprevailed; but the fundamental one to be remembered is the greater\r\ndevelopment of fire conferred by greater length. All ships—except\r\nthe very small ones known as schooners, cutters, and gunboats—were\r\nbroadside vessels, moved by canvas which was carried commonly on two\r\nor three masts; but into the particulars of the sails it is presumed\r\nreaders will not care to enter. Being thus homogeneous in general\r\ncharacteristics, the ships of this era were divided commonly into\r\nthree principal classes, each of which had subdivisions; but it was\r\nrecognized then, as it is now in theory though too little in practice,\r\nthat such multiplication of species is harmful, and our forerunners, by\r\na process of gradual elimination, had settled down upon certain clearly\r\ndefined medium types.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the three principal classes of fighting ships were\r\ncalled sloops-of-war, or corvettes. These had sometimes two masts,\r\nsometimes three; but the particular feature that differentiated them\r\nwas that they had but one row of guns in broadside, on an uncovered\r\ndeck. The offices discharged by this class of vessel were various, but\r\nin the apprehension of the writer they may be considered rightly as\r\nbeing above all the protectors or destroyers of commerce in transit.\r\nAll ships of war, of course, contributed to this end; but the direct\r\npreying upon commerce, upon merchant ships, whose resisting power\r\nwas small, was done most economically by small vessels of relatively\r\nsmall power. Having a given amount of tonnage to devote to commerce\r\ndestroying, many small vessels are more effective than a few big\r\nones of unnecessary force. Such being the nature of the attack, the\r\nresistance must be similar in kind. That is, a flock of merchant\r\nships being liable to attack by many small adversaries, several\r\nsmall protectors would be more efficient than one or two large ones.\r\nSloops-of-war served also as despatch vessels and lookouts of a fleet,\r\nbut were less well adapted to this service than the frigate was.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIGATE AND HER GUNS\r\n\r\nThis latter celebrated and favorite class of ship stood next in order\r\nof power above the corvette, with which it might also be said to\r\nhave blended; for although in the frigate class there were two, or\r\nat the most three, rates that predominated vastly in numbers over\r\nall the rest, yet the name covered many differing degrees of force.\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the frigate was that it carried one\r\ncomplete row of guns upon a covered deck—upon a deck, that is, which\r\nhad another deck over it. On this upper or spar deck there were also\r\nguns—more or fewer—but lighter in weight than those on the covered\r\ndeck, usually styled the main deck. The two principal classes of\r\nfrigates at the beginning of this century were the thirty-two-gun\r\nand the thirty-eight-gun. That is, they carried nominally sixteen or\r\nnineteen guns on each side; but the enumeration is misleading, except\r\nas a matter of comparison, for guns of some classes were not counted.\r\nShips generally had a few more cannon than their rate implied. The\r\nUnited States thirty-two-gun frigate _Essex_, for example, carried at\r\nfirst twenty-six long twelves on the main deck, with sixteen carronades\r\nand two chase guns on the spar deck. Above these two classes came the\r\nforty-four-gun frigate, a very powerful rate, which was favored by\r\nthe United States navy and received a development of strength then\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\nBeing such as here described, the frigate was essentially, though not\r\nexclusively, the appendage of a fleet of line-of-battle ships. Wars are\r\ndecided not by commerce destroying nor by raids, however vexatious, but\r\nby fleets and armies, by great organized masses—that is, by crushing,\r\nnot by harassment. But ships of the line, to perform their function,\r\nmust keep together, both when cruising and when on the field of battle,\r\nin order to put forth their strength in combination. The innumerable\r\ndetached services that must be discharged for every great organized\r\nforce need for a fleet to be done by vessels of inferior strength,\r\nyet so strong that they cannot be intercepted or driven off lightly\r\nby every whipper-snapper of an armed ship that comes along. Moreover,\r\na fact not always realized, speed—speed to hasten on a mission, to\r\novertake a foe, or to escape pursuit—depends upon size, masts that\r\ncan carry sail and hold way amid heavy seas. Hence the frigate, not\r\nthe lighter sloop, was indicated for the momentous duties upon which\r\ndepended the intelligence and the communications of the fleet. Such\r\nleading considerations are needed to be stated and to be kept in mind,\r\nfor they affected the warfare of the last decade of the century quite\r\nas really as they did that of the first, and a paper would indeed be\r\nincomplete which confined itself to indicating points of difference\r\nof progress, so-called, and failed to recognize those essential and\r\npermanent conditions which time will never remove. Frigates and sloops\r\nhave disappeared in name and form, in motive power and in armament.\r\nTheir essential functions remain, and will remain while war lasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE FRIGATE\r\n\r\nThe truth of this statement will be evident from a brief mention of\r\nthe duties frigates actually used to perform. While attending the\r\nfleet, not merely a part of it, the frigates were thrown out far\r\nin advance and on each side, as cavalry on land scours the country\r\ntowards or through which the army advances. The distance to which\r\nthey would be thus detached would sometimes amount to one hundred or\r\ntwo hundred miles, and the absence to days, rejoining being assured\r\nby the assignment of a rendezvous, or by an adequate knowledge of the\r\nadmiral’s intended movements. It will be recognized that when thus\r\nalone frigates might meet equal or superior forces, to resist or to\r\nescape from which both strength and speed were needed. An extreme and\r\nparticular case of such service was the watching of an enemy’s port\r\nby one or more frigates, when they had to keep close to the entrance,\r\nalthough a fleet might be within. Again, frigates were placed in\r\ncertain central positions, rendezvous known only to the superior\r\nofficers, where they cruised steadily, having information as to the\r\nwhereabouts of the fleet, or instructions for expected vessels. They\r\nwere there centres of intelligence, round which the movements of the\r\nwhole body revolved.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleet was actually in touch with a hostile fleet, in pursuit,\r\nor when expecting battle, the frigates were placed between their own\r\nforce and the enemy; nearer, however, to the latter, as the essential\r\npoint was to keep knowledge of his whereabouts and probable intentions.\r\nSuch a position was at times extremely exposed. The frigates had to\r\navoid equally capture and being driven and shaken off; they must keep\r\nclose, yet not be caught. When engagement ensued they passed through to\r\nthe off side of their own fleet, where they were dispersed at intervals\r\nabreast the main line, like the file closers of a military line ashore.\r\nHere they fulfilled one special purpose, besides others. As the fleet\r\nfought with broadsides only, its ships were ranged one ahead of the\r\nother. Consequently signals made on the masts of the admiral could not\r\nbe seen always by those ahead or astern of him; but the frigates in the\r\nother line made the same signals, “repeated,” as it was said, where\r\nthey could be read more certainly. But frigates did also more hazardous\r\nwork. They went to crippled ships of the line and towed them into other\r\npositions, into or out of fire, and at times the admiral summoned a\r\nfrigate alongside to carry a message to some part of the battle. “I\r\nnoticed,” says Marryatt, in one of his novels, “the look of pride on\r\nthe faces of our officers when it appeared that the loss on board our\r\nfrigate was greater than that of some of the ships in the line.”\r\n\r\nFor such offices it is evident there were wanted a strength and a\r\nweight which the corvette did not have. A corvette would make poor\r\nwork of towing a heavy ship, and could not carry as surely the\r\nsail needed to maintain a position. At the same time it should be\r\nobserved that excess of size above the requirements stated should\r\nbe exceptional. In the opinion of the writer the forty-four-gun\r\nfrigate in her day possessed a fighting force and a weight of body\r\nin excess of that required by the ordinary functions of her nominal\r\nclass. For exceptional reasons, a few of the type were permissible\r\nin a large navy. On the other hand, it may be inferred from the long\r\nexperience of the British navy, and the resultant practice, that ships\r\nof twenty-eight, twenty-four, and twenty guns, though often styled\r\nfrigates, were not found satisfactory as such. In the distribution of\r\ntonnage between size and numbers, a mean must be found; and it must be\r\nadded that a just mean is a very different thing from a compromise.\r\nThese considerations also apply to present-day problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SHIPS OF THE LINE\r\n\r\nIn the fleet-ship, likewise the ship of the line, as the opening\r\ncentury styled the class of vessel known in the closing days as the\r\nbattle-ship, our predecessors had reached a mean conclusion. The\r\nline-of-battle ship, or the ship of the line, as more usually called,\r\ndiffered from the frigate generically, in that it had two or more\r\ncovered decks. There were one or two cases of ships with four decks,\r\nbut, as a rule, three were the extreme; and ships of the line were\r\nroughly classed as two or three deckers. Under these heads two-deckers\r\ncarried in their two centuries of history from fifty to eighty-four\r\nguns; three-deckers from ninety to one hundred and twenty. The increase\r\nin number of guns, resulting, as it did, from increase of size, was not\r\nthe sole gain of ships of the line. The bigger ships got, the heavier\r\nwere their timbers, the thicker their planking, the more impenetrable,\r\ntherefore, their sides. There was a gain, in short, of defensive as\r\nwell as offensive strength, analogous to the protection given by armor.\r\n“As the enemy’s ships were big,” wrote a renowned British admiral,\r\n“they took a great deal of drubbing.”\r\n\r\nBetween the great extremes of strength indicated by fifty and one\r\nhundred and twenty guns—whose existence at one and the same time\r\nwas the evidence of blind historical development, rather than of\r\nintelligent relative processes—the navy of a century ago had settled\r\nupon a mean, to appreciate which the main idea and purport of the ship\r\nof the line must be grasped. The essential function of the ship “of the\r\nline” was, as the name implies, to act in combination with other ships\r\nin a line of battle. To do this was needed not only fighting power,\r\nbut manœuvring ability—speed and handiness—and in order that these\r\nqualities might approach homogeneousness throughout the fleet, and so\r\npromote action in concert, the acceptance of a mean type was essential.\r\nTo carry three decks of guns, a ship had to expose above water a side\r\ndisproportionately high relatively to her length, her depth, and her\r\nhold upon the water. She consequently drifted rapidly when her side was\r\nturned to the wind; while, if her length was increased, and so her hold\r\non the water, she needed more time and room to tack and to wear—that\r\nis, to turn around. Ships of this class also were generally—though not\r\nnecessarily—slow.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE SEVENTY-FOURS\r\n\r\nThe two-decked ship was superior in speed and in handiness, and for\r\nthat reason, even when acting singly, she could put forth such power\r\nas she possessed more quickly and more certainly. But these qualities\r\nwere most conspicuously valuable when ship had to act with ship. The\r\ngreat secret of military success, concerted action in masses, was in\r\nthe hands of the two-decked ship, because in her were united to the\r\nhighest point individual power and facility for combined action. And\r\nthis was true not only of two-deckers in general, but of the particular\r\nspecies known as the seventy-four-gun ship. Ships below that rate\r\nlacked individual fighting power. Ships above it, the eighty and\r\neighty-four, lost manœuvring power because of their greater length and\r\nweight. Under the conditions of sail a fleet of seventy-fours could get\r\nout the whole power of the force more surely and more rapidly than the\r\nequivalent number of guns in ships of any other kind. Thus offensive\r\npower dictated its survival. To our own day it reads the lesson that\r\noffensive power, the _sine quâ non_ of a military organization, lies\r\nnot merely in the greatest strength of the single ships, but in\r\nthe uniformity of their action and rapidity of their movements, as\r\nconducive to the quick putting forth of the strength of the whole body\r\nat once and in mutual support.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked naturally, why, then, were there any ships bigger\r\nor smaller than this favored type? For smaller, the answer is that\r\nshort ships of lighter draught are best suited for shoal or intricate\r\nnavigation. The shoals of Holland forbade heavy ships to the Dutch\r\nnavy, materially reducing its fighting strength. Before France entered\r\nour Revolutionary struggle the British sent only sixty-fours to\r\noperate upon our comparatively shallow coasts and bars. As regards\r\nbigger ships, they were useful exceptionally, as were forty-four-gun\r\nfrigates, and for the following reason: Every line of battle has three\r\nparticularly dangerous points—the centre, because there the line,\r\nif pierced, divides into the two smaller fragments; and the flanks,\r\nor ends, because the extremities are supported less easily by the\r\nrest of the force than the centre is, one extremity being farther\r\nfrom the other than the centre is from either. Such local weakness\r\ncould not be remedied by the use of two ships, for, if the line were\r\nproperly closed, one of them could fire at the enemy only through or\r\nover the other. The sole way of giving the strength there required\r\nwas by concentrating it into individual ships, either by putting on\r\nthe additional battery, which gives a three-decker, or by making the\r\nseventy-four heavier, resulting in an eighty-gun ship on two decks.\r\nThese stronger vessels were, therefore, stationed in the centre or on\r\nthe flanks of a line of battle. The particular functions, the _raison\r\nd’être_, of the three leading classes of ships of war—the sloop, the\r\nfrigate, and the ship of the line—have now been stated. It remains to\r\ngive an account of the chief features of the armament carried on their\r\nbroadsides, as described.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTERIES SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century began, batteries of ships were composed\r\nof two principal classes of guns: the long gun and the short gun, or\r\ncarronade. The difference between these lay in the way the weight of\r\nmetal allowed for each was utilized. The long gun, as its name implies,\r\nwas comparatively long and thick, and threw a small ball with a heavy\r\ncharge of powder. The ball, therefore, flew swiftly, and had a long\r\nrange. A carronade of the same weight was short and comparatively thin,\r\ncould use only a small charge of powder, lest it burst, and threw a\r\nlarge ball. Its shot, therefore, moved slowly and had short range.\r\nFired at a target—a ship’s side—within range of both guns, the shot\r\nfrom the long gun penetrated quickly, the wood had not time to splinter\r\nbadly, and a clean hole was the result. The carronade’s shot, on the\r\ncontrary, being both larger and slower, penetrated with difficulty,\r\nall the surrounding wood felt the strain and broke up into splinters,\r\nleaving a large jagged hole, if the shot got through. These effects\r\nwere called respectively piercing and smashing, and are reproduced,\r\nin measure, upon targets representing the side of a modern ironclad.\r\nThey have been likened familiarly to the effect of a pistol-ball and\r\nof a stone upon a window pane: the one goes through clean, the other\r\ncrashes.\r\n\r\nThe smashing of the carronades, when fully realized, was worse than\r\npenetration, and was greatly dreaded; but, on the other hand, a ship\r\nwhich feared them in an opponent might keep out of their range. This\r\nexpedient was so effective that carronades, which did great damage\r\nuntil their tactics were understood, gradually fell into disfavor.\r\nNevertheless, they remained in use till after the peace of 1815. In\r\n1814 the battery of the U. S. S. _Essex_ was chiefly carronades, and\r\ntheir inadequate range was a large factor in her defeat.\r\n\r\nAt the period in question guns of all sorts fired only non-explosive\r\nprojectiles, solid or hollow shot. The destructive shell of the present\r\nday was used only by pieces called mortars, in vertical firing, which\r\nwill be spoken of farther on. Such were not mounted on the ships of\r\nthe fleet generally, nor used against shipping, except when packed in\r\na small harbor. They did not enter into naval warfare proper. The ram\r\nand the torpedo of present warfare were unknown. On the other hand,\r\nthere was practised a form of fighting which is thought now to have\r\ndisappeared forever, namely, boarding and fighting hand-to-hand on the\r\ndeck. Even then, however, boarding did not decide the main issue of a\r\nsea-fight, except occasionally in very small vessels. The deck of a\r\nlarge and fresh ship was not to be reached easily. Boarding was like\r\nthe cavalry charge that routs a wavering line; the ship had been beaten\r\nat the guns before it occurred.\r\n\r\nThe real fighting was done by the long guns and carronades disposed\r\nin the broadsides. Besides rapidity and precision of fire, always\r\ninvaluable, the two opponents sought advantage of position by\r\nmanœuvring. They closed, or they kept apart, according to their\r\nunderstanding of the other’s weight and kind of battery. Each tried,\r\nwhen possible, to lie across the bow or the stern of the enemy, for\r\nthen his guns ranged from end to end of the hostile ship, while the\r\nlatter’s broadside could not reply. Failing this extreme advantage\r\nof position, the effort was made so to place one’s self that the\r\nopponent’s guns could not bear—for they swept only a few degrees\r\nbefore and abaft the broadside—while your own could. If this also\r\nwas impossible, the contestants lay side to side at a greater or less\r\ndistance, and the affair became an artillery duel.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AND FRENCH STYLES OF FIGHTING\r\n\r\nBesides these recognized advantages of position, there was also a\r\nquestion upon what part of the enemy the fire should be directed. In\r\nthis there were two principal schools of tactics, one of which aimed at\r\nthe hull, to break down the fire of the hostile ship and destroy her\r\nfighting men, while the other sought, by pointing higher, to cut away\r\nthe sails, rigging, and masts, rendering the foe helpless. The latter,\r\nin general, was the policy of the French; the former, and, it may be\r\naffirmed, the more surely successful, was the practice of the British.\r\nThe two schools find their counterpart in the tactical considerations\r\nwhich now affect the question of rapid-fire and of heavy guns, each\r\nof which has its appropriate target, covering in the latter case the\r\nmotive power, in the former the personnel.\r\n\r\nThese three leading classes of vessels, with their functions,\r\narmaments, and tactics of the single ship, as described, performed in\r\ntheir day and during the great maritime contests of two centuries all\r\nthe duties that at any time can be required of a maritime fighting\r\norganization. By them the control of the sea in the largest sense was\r\ndisputed and was determined; by them commerce was attacked, and by them\r\nit was protected. They themselves have passed away, but the military\r\nfactors remain the same. The mastery of the sea and the control of its\r\ncommerce—of which blockade is but a special case—are now and must\r\nremain always the chief ends of maritime war. The ends continuing the\r\nsame, the grand disposition of navies—their strategy—reposes upon the\r\nsame principles that it ever did. Similarly, while the changes in the\r\ncharacteristics of ships will cause the individual vessel to be fought\r\nin manners different from its predecessors, the handling of masses\r\nof ships in battle—fleet tactics—must proceed on the same general\r\nprinciples as of old. The centre and the two extremities of all orders\r\nare always the points of danger; concentration upon one or two of the\r\nthree, however effected, must be always the principle of action. These\r\nthings, which cannot vary, form, therefore, no part of a paper which\r\ndeals with changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY HAD THEIR BREAK-DOWNS THEN, TOO\r\n\r\nThere should be added for the general public the caution that the\r\ndifficulties, the imperfections, and the frequent halting state of\r\nships-of-war in commission for sea service at the present day are no\r\nnew things. To the naval historian familiar with the correspondence of\r\nthe past they are the inevitable attendants of all government action,\r\nwherein the most economical methods are always dominated, historically,\r\nby considerations of expediency which are political in character. The\r\nnecessity of keeping the public in good-humor, and of not laying open\r\npoints upon which opposition can enlarge, induces apparent economies,\r\nwhich sacrifice not only economy, but the best results. This is a\r\ngreat evil, as yet apparently inseparable from public enterprises as\r\ndistinguished from private ones. If any one supposes that the ships\r\nwith which Great Britain overthrew Napoleon, and with which Nelson\r\nand his contemporaries won their as yet unparalleled victories, were\r\nalways or generally in good material condition, he is greatly mistaken.\r\nWhat is different in our day, apparently, is a tendency in ships to\r\nrely for their repairs and material efficiency more upon dock-yards\r\nand workshops than upon their own resources, a disposition also to be\r\nunduly discouraged by imperfections in the motive enginery. War will\r\ncorrect this or war will fail. In maintaining efficiency while keeping\r\nthe sea, quite as much as in fighting skill, lay the supreme excellence\r\nof officers like Nelson and Jervis. Men now ought to appreciate better\r\nthan they do what difficulties of this sort seamen underwent a hundred\r\nyears ago and how they refused to yield to them. “The difference\r\nbetween myself and the French marshals,” the Duke of Wellington is\r\nreported to have said, “was as when a man starts on a journey with a\r\nnew harness. What if something gives way, as in war something is sure\r\nto go wrong? Shall you stop or go back for a workman? Not so; hitch up\r\nthe break with a bit of rope, or whatever comes handy, and go on. That\r\nis what I did.”\r\n\r\nThe succession of cause and effect which has produced the present\r\nship-of-war will be traced in rapid outline, in order to leave as much\r\nroom as may be for the description of the essential feature of the ship\r\nherself as she now exists.\r\n\r\nTwo chief factors concur to a ship-of-war—motive power and fighting\r\npower. The displacement of sails by engines, and the progressive\r\ndevelopment of the latter, are features of the general progress of the\r\ncentury. The engines of a ship-of-war are differentiated from those of\r\nmerchant ships chiefly by the necessity of protection. This affects\r\ntheir design, which must be subordinated to the requirement of being as\r\nfar as possible below the water-line. The further great protection now\r\nafforded is incident rather to the use and development of armor as a\r\npart of the fighting power.\r\n\r\nFighting power divides into offensive and defensive. Armor now\r\nrepresents the latter. The fighting ship in every age is the product\r\nof the race between the two, and in the nineteenth century this was\r\nunprecedented in the ground covered and in the rapidity of the pace,\r\ndue to the increased power of dealing with materials, already alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTEST OF ARMOR AND PROJECTILE\r\n\r\nThe modern contest began with the introduction of horizontal shell\r\nfire in the third decade of the century. This term must be explained.\r\nIt has been said that all ships’ guns up to 1815 threw non-explosive\r\nprojectiles. In practice this is true; although Nelson alludes to\r\ncertain shell supplied to him for trial, which he was unwilling to\r\nuse because he wished not to burn his prizes, but to take them alive.\r\nA shell is a hollow projectile filled with powder, the idea of which\r\nis that upon reaching the enemy it will burst into several pieces,\r\neach capable of killing a man, and the flame not impossibly setting\r\nwoodwork on fire. It was necessary that the powder within should not\r\nexplode from the combustion of the cartridge of the gun, for if it\r\ndid its force, combined with the latter, might burst the gun; yet the\r\nprocess that should result in bursting must begin at that moment or\r\nelse it would not take place at all. This difficulty was met by a short\r\ncolumn of hard, compressed powder called the fuse, which extended from\r\nthe outside to the inside of the shell. The outer end was inflamed\r\nby the charge of the gun, but from its density it burned slowly, so\r\nthat the charge of the shell was not enkindled for five, ten, or more\r\nseconds. This expedient was in use over a century ago; but owing to\r\nimperfections of manufacture, no certainty was attained that the fuse\r\nmight not be driven in or broken by the force of the discharge, or the\r\nshell itself be cracked and so explode prematurely. Shell, therefore,\r\nwere fired with very light charges; and, to obtain sufficient range—go\r\nfar enough—they were used in very short, very thick guns, called\r\nbombs or mortars, to which great elevation was given. Such firing,\r\nbecause the shell flew high in the air, was called vertical firing,\r\nin contradistinction to the fire of the long gun or carronade, called\r\nhorizontal fire because their projectiles rose little above the level.\r\n\r\nThe destructiveness of shell from ordinary guns was so obvious,\r\nespecially for forts to use against wooden ships, that the difficulties\r\nwere gradually overcome, and horizontal shell fire was introduced soon\r\nafter the cessation of wars allowed men time for thought and change.\r\nBut although the idea was accepted and the fact realized, practice\r\nchanged slowly, as it tends to do in the absence of emergency. In the\r\nattack on Vera Cruz, in 1848, Farragut was present, and was greatly\r\nimpressed, as with a novelty, by the effect of what he called the\r\n“shell shot,” a hybrid term which aptly expresses the transition state\r\nof men’s minds at the time. I remember an officer who entered the\r\nnavy in 1840 telling me the respectful awe and distrust with which\r\nhis superiors then regarded the new weapon, a very few of which for\r\neach gun were supplied tentatively. Ten years more, however, saw a\r\ngreat change, and in 1853 the attack of the Russian squadron of wooden\r\nsailing-ships upon the Turkish vessels in the Bay of Sinope gave an\r\nobject-lesson that aroused the naval world to what wooden ships must\r\nexpect from horizontal shell fire. In a few minutes three out of seven\r\nTurkish frigates were in flames; while of nine sailing-ships and two\r\nsteamers only one of the latter escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL SHELL FIRE\r\n\r\nThe Crimean War followed quickly, and in 1854 the wooden steamships of\r\nthe line of the allies, vessels identical in fighting characteristics\r\nwith those of Trafalgar, attempted to silence masonry works at\r\nSebastopol. Though the disaster was not so great, the lesson of Sinope\r\nwas reaffirmed. Louis Napoleon, a thoughtful man though scarcely a man\r\nof action, had foreseen the difficulty, and had already directed the\r\nconstruction of five floating batteries which were to carry armor.\r\nBefore the war ended these vessels attacked the forts at Kinburn, which\r\nthey compelled to surrender, losing, themselves, no men except by\r\nshells that entered the gun ports. Their armor was not pierced.\r\n\r\nHorizontal shell fire had called for iron armor, and the two, as\r\nopposing factors, were now established in the recognition of men. The\r\ncontest between the two sums up the progression and the fluctuations\r\nof military ideas which have resulted in the battle-ship of to-day,\r\nwhich, as the fleet-ship, remains the dominant factor in naval warfare,\r\nnot only in actual fact but in present probability. From the first\r\nfeeble beginnings at Kinburn to the present time, although the strife\r\nhas waxed greatly in degree, it remains unchanged in principle and in\r\nkind. To exclude the shell, because, starting as one projectile, it\r\nbecame many after penetration, in what does it differ from excluding\r\nthe rapid-fire gun, whose projectiles are many from the first, and\r\npenetrate singly?\r\n\r\nThere occurred, however, one singular development, an aberration from\r\nthe normal line of advance, the chief manifestation of which, from\r\nlocal and temporary conditions, was in our own country. This was the\r\ntransient predominance of the monitor type and idea; the iron-clad\r\nvessel, with very few very heavy guns, mounted in one or two circular\r\nrevolving turrets, protected by very heavy armor. The monitor type\r\nembodied two ideas. The first was the extreme of defensive power, owing\r\nto the smallness of the target and the thickness of its armor—the\r\nhull of the vessel rising but little above the water—the turret was\r\nsubstantially the only target. The second was an extreme compression\r\nof offensive power, the turret containing two of the heaviest guns of\r\nthe day, consequently guns of the heaviest penetration, which could\r\nfire, not in one direction, nor in several, but in all directions as\r\nthe turret revolved, and which were practically the sole armament\r\nof the ship. The defensive power of the monitor was absolute up to\r\nthe extreme resisting endurance of its armor. Its offensive power\r\nmust be considered relatively to the target to which its guns were\r\nto be opposed. If much in excess of that target’s resistance, there\r\nwas waste of power. Actually in our Civil War monitors were opposed\r\nto fortifications, except in one or two instances when they had to\r\ncontend with the imperfect structures which the Confederates could put\r\nafloat. The target, therefore, was not in excess of their gun power.\r\nMoreover, being for coast warfare, the monitor then was necessarily of\r\nsmall draught and small tonnage. Her battery weight, therefore, must\r\nbe small, and consequently lent itself to concentration into two guns,\r\njust as the battery weight of a schooner a century since found its best\r\ndisposition in one long traversing gun.\r\n\r\nThis was the infancy period of the iron-clad ship. The race between\r\nguns and armor was barely begun, and manufacturing processes still\r\nwere crude. As these improved, with astounding rapidity, the\r\nsuccessful production of rifled cannon of ever-increasing dimensions\r\nand penetrative force imposed an increased armor protection, which at\r\nthe first was obtained chiefly by an increase of thickness, _i.e._,\r\nof weight. As guns and armor got heavier, ships had to be bigger to\r\ncarry them, and, if bigger, of course longer. But the monitor idea,\r\nadmirably suited to small ships, had now fast hold of men’s minds—in\r\nEngland especially, for the United States lapsed into naval somnolence\r\nafter the war—and it was carried irreflectively into vessels of huge\r\ndimensions whose hulls rose much above the water. Weight for weight,\r\nthe power of the gun outstripped the resistance of armor, and it soon\r\nbecame evident that even in a large ship perfect protection could be\r\ngiven only to a part of the structure. Passing over intermediate steps,\r\nthe extreme and final development of the monitor idea was reached in\r\nthe _Inflexible_, planned in 1876 by the British Admiralty, built in\r\nthe following years, and still in service. This vessel was of eleven\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty tons displacement. She was three\r\nhundred and twenty feet long, and of that length only the central one\r\nhundred and ten feet had protection, but that was by armor two feet\r\nthick, while armored partitions extended from each end of this side\r\nbelt across the vessel, forming a box one hundred and ten feet long by\r\nseventy-four broad. Within this box were two turrets, each with sixteen\r\ninches of armor, and carrying two guns which threw a shell of a ton\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE MONITOR\r\n\r\nThe first monitor has been called an epoch-making ship, for she began\r\nan era. The _Inflexible_ was also epoch-making, for she closed the era\r\nof the monitor pure and simple. Upon a development of three hundred\r\nand twenty feet of length she carried only four guns, of which it is\r\nnot too much to say that their power was very far in excess of almost\r\nall targets that could be opposed to them. If, indeed, her possible\r\nopponents could have carried such an armor as her own all over their\r\nexposed surface, her guns would have been no heavier than needed,\r\nand the fewness must be accepted; but this was not the case. Like\r\nherself, ships of twelve thousand tons must have a penetrable target\r\nfar exceeding in surface the almost impregnable box she presented.\r\nThe unreasonableness of the result struck men at once, though of\r\ncourse she had advocates. As an exception, such a ship might pass;\r\nas a type, never. It was pointed out that guns of very small power\r\ncould pierce the exposed ends about the water-line, and that, as water\r\nentered by numerous holes, she would not only sink lower, but for\r\nconstructional reasons, not necessary here to give, she would lose\r\nstability rapidly—become liable to overset. If under such conditions\r\nshe attempted to turn round, the inclination vessels take in so doing\r\nwould be enough alone to cause her to capsize. Her defenders did not\r\ndeny this; but they said that the likelihood of her exposed ends being\r\nso riddled was too slight to justify alarm.\r\n\r\nUnder artillery conditions, then, this reply was plausible, though\r\nit soon ceased to be so. Even then, however, it was true that a ship\r\nwith only four guns that fired very slowly, and with such an exposed\r\nsurface, was liable to serious injury from a nimble antagonist firing\r\nmany guns rapidly. The defensive weakness of the _Inflexible_ is\r\napparent; her offensive power, great as in the aggregate it was, was\r\nmuch impaired by lack of proper development, by undue compression\r\ninto very few guns, the larger part of whose effect was wasted,\r\nexcept in the rare instances when they struck a target not often to\r\nbe encountered. But this was not the only deduction from her strength\r\nthrough the excess of concentration. Very large guns fire very slowly,\r\nyet they are as subject to inaccuracy from the motion of the ship as\r\nis the smallest piece. Where the target is missed, it is immaterial\r\nwhether the shot weighs a ton or a pound; and a gun that fires ten\r\ntimes to another’s once has ten times the chance of hitting. It is\r\nevident, therefore, taking the _Inflexible_ as she was, that a ship\r\nof the same weight and length with ten guns in broadside—twenty\r\naltogether—and with similar armor over her engines only, would have\r\nat the least a fair chance against the _Inflexible_, and would be much\r\nmore efficient against vessels with average armor. Each of her ten guns\r\nfiring once a minute, while the _Inflexible’s_ cannon required five\r\nminutes for discharge, would give over ten shots to one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISM OF THE _INFLEXIBLE_\r\n\r\nWhile the _Inflexible_ was building there was born the idea whose\r\npresent maturity enforces the abandonment of the pure monitor, except\r\nfor vessels comparatively small and for special purposes. Machine guns,\r\nthe Gatling, and the mitrailleuse were already known, and the principle\r\nwas being applied to throw projectiles of a pound weight and over,\r\nwhich were automatically loaded and fired, requiring only to be aimed.\r\nUpon these followed the rapid-fire gun, of weight greatly exceeding\r\ntheirs, the principle of which may be said to be that it is loaded\r\nby hand, but with ammunition so prepared and mechanism for loading\r\nso simple and expeditious as to permit a rate of firing heretofore\r\nunparalleled. The highest extension of this principle is reached in the\r\nfive-inch gun, up to which size the cartridge and the projectile make a\r\nsingle package called fixed ammunition, which is placed by one motion.\r\nTogether they weigh ninety-five pounds, about as much as an average\r\nman can handle in a seaway, the projectile itself weighing fifty\r\npounds. There are, it is true, six-inch rapid-fire guns, but in them\r\nthe cartridge and shell are placed separately, and it is questionable\r\nwhether such increase of effect, through greater weight, as they give\r\nis not gained at a loss of due rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe _Inflexible_ exemplified in an extreme form the elements of\r\noffensive and defensive strength and weakness. Four guns of enormous\r\ncalibre and no other battery, except pieces so light as to be useless\r\nagainst the thinnest armor, an impenetrable wall, covering a very\r\nlimited area, and the remainder of the hull exposed, to be cut to\r\npieces by a battery of numerous light cannon. When to the latter the\r\nrapid-fire idea was successfully applied, multiplying their efficiency\r\nthree or fourfold, her position, as an example to be followed, became\r\nuntenable. The monitor idea, which refused to utilize the broadside for\r\ndeveloping fire, and aimed chiefly at minimizing the target, evidently\r\nneeded qualification after a certain moderate limit of size was passed;\r\nand that limit of size was when the entire weight of battery the ship\r\ncould carry sufficed only for two, or, at the most, four guns of power\r\ngreat enough to pierce heavy armor. Strictly, in the opinion of the\r\nwriter, the monitor type should not prevail beyond the size that can\r\nbear only one turret.\r\n\r\nIn the strife of guns with armor, therefore, increase of power in\r\nguns, outstripping continually the increase of resistance in armor,\r\ncalled for bigger ships to bear the increased armor weight, till the\r\nlatter could not possibly be placed all over the ship’s body. Hence the\r\nexposed target, upon which plays the smaller battery of rapid-fire guns.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend fundamentally the subsequent development, we must recur\r\nto the rudimentary idea that a ship of war possesses two chief factors,\r\nmotive force and fighting force, the latter being composed of guns\r\nmainly and of men. Corresponding to these two chief powers there were\r\nof old, and there are still, two vulnerable elements, two targets, upon\r\none or the other of which hostile effort logically and practically\r\nmust be directed. A century ago the French, aiming at sails and spars,\r\nsought the destruction of the motive force; the British directed their\r\nfire upon the guns and men. In strict analogy now, the heavy guns seek\r\nthe motive power, over which the heaviest armor is concentrated; the\r\nrapid-fire guns, searching the other portions of the ship, aim at the\r\nguns and men there stationed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE-SHIPS OF THIS DAY\r\n\r\nThe logical outcome of these leading ideas is realized in the present\r\nbattle-ships as follows: There are two turrets, protected by armor,\r\nthe thickest that can be given them, considering the other weights\r\nthe ship has to carry, and of the highest resisting quality that\r\nprocesses of manufacture can develop. Armor of similar character and\r\nweight protects the sides about the engines. In each turret are guns\r\nwhose power corresponds to the armor which protects them. Their proper\r\naim—not, of course, always reached—is the heavy armored part of\r\nthe enemy, chiefly the engines, the motive power. When they strike\r\noutside of this target, as often must happen, there is excess of blow,\r\nand consequent waste. The turrets are separated, fore and aft, by a\r\ndistance as great as possible, to minimize the danger of a single shot\r\nor any other local incident disabling both. The fact that the ends\r\nof ships, being comparatively sharp, are less waterborne and cannot\r\nsupport extreme weights, chiefly limits this severance of the turrets.\r\nBetween the two, and occasionally before or abaft them, is distributed\r\nthe broadside rapid fire of the ship, which in its development is in\r\ncontradistinction to the compressed fire of the monitor. This fire is\r\nrapid because the guns are many and because individually they can fire\r\nfast. Thus, the turret gun, twelve or thirteen inch in bore, fires once\r\nin five minutes; the five-inch rapid-fire gun thrice in one minute. The\r\nrapid-fire battery aims outside of the heaviest armor. When it strikes\r\nthat, unless it chance to enter a gun port, its effect is lost; but as\r\nmuch the greater part of the ship is penetrable by it, the chance of\r\nwasting power is less than in the case of the heavier guns. As most of\r\na ship’s company are outside the protection of the heaviest armor, the\r\nrapid-fire gun aims, as did the British in the old line-of-battle ship,\r\nat the personnel of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe reader will comprehend that in the application of these leading\r\nideas there is considerable variety in detail. The two turrets may be\r\nlooked upon at present as the least variable factor; and in disposing\r\narmor all practice agrees that the turrets and engines receive the\r\ngreatest protection. But how to distribute the total available\r\nweight of armor gives rise to varieties of practice which find\r\ntheir reflection in similar variety in the sizes and numbers of the\r\nrapid-fire guns, to whose penetrative force there is a corresponding\r\nthickness of armor. For example, two battle-ships now building for the\r\nUnited States navy have four thirteen-inch guns in turrets, and in\r\nbroadside fourteen five-inch, twenty six-pounder, and six one-pounder\r\nrapid-fire guns; between the two classes they have four eight-inch\r\nguns, also mounted in smaller turrets, superimposed on the main\r\nturrets. A ship since designed will have the same thirteen-inch gun\r\nfire, but in place of the eight-inch and five-inch will have fourteen\r\nsix-inch rapid-fire guns. An expert officer, discussing these, says:\r\n“In the former the weight of fire per minute is two thousand and fifty\r\npounds on the broadside and five hundred ahead or astern, while with\r\nthe latter plan it is only one thousand seven hundred and fifty on the\r\nbroadside and five hundred ahead and astern. But the main objection\r\nto the second plan is that the volume of effective fire is enormously\r\ndiminished by the omission of eight-inch guns. The larger area covered\r\nwith their armor is fairly safe from the six-inch gun at fighting\r\nranges, whereas the eight-inch projectile at any range, and at even a\r\nconsiderable angle of incidence, will penetrate it.” In the judgment\r\nof the present writer the weight of this argument depends upon what is\r\nbehind the armor the eight-inch only will penetrate. If battery and\r\nmen, it is strong, if not decisive; if motive power only, not.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY’S TEACHING AND THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper has been not to present an accumulation of\r\ndetails, but to elucidate the principles upon which the details rest.\r\nThe latter, when correct, are but the application of principles to\r\npractice. Subject to the imperfections attendant on all human work,\r\nthe writer is persuaded that the greatest errors in practice—and\r\nespecially the lack of homogeneousness which characterizes the\r\npresent battle-ships—arise chiefly from the failure to refer back\r\nto principles. Until war has given us the abundant experience which\r\nled our predecessors to the broadside seventy-four as the rule, with\r\noccasional exceptions, we must depend upon reasoning alone for the\r\nsolution of our problems; and the reasoner keeps within the limits of\r\nsafety only by constant reference to fundamental facts.\r\n\r\nThe one experience of war which ships really contemporary have had\r\nwas in the battle of the Yalu. Its teachings lose some value from the\r\nfact that the well-drilled Japanese used their weapons to advantage,\r\nwhile the Chinese were ill trained; still, some fair inferences can\r\nbe made. The Japanese had a great many rapid-fire guns, with few\r\nvery heavy ones, and their vessels were not battle-ships properly\r\nso-called. The Chinese, besides other vessels, had two battle-ships\r\nwith heavy armor and heavy guns. Victory remained with the Japanese.\r\nIn the opinion of the writer two probable conclusions can be reached:\r\nThat rapid-fire guns in due proportion to the entire battery will beat\r\ndown a ship dependent mainly upon turret guns; that is, between two\r\nships whose batteries are alike the issue of the contest will depend\r\nupon the one or the other gaining first a predominance of rapid fire.\r\nThat done, the turret guns of the predominant ship will give the final\r\nblows to the engines and turrets of the other, whose own turret guns\r\ncannot be used with the necessary deliberation under the preponderant\r\nstorm of projectiles now turned upon them. The other conclusion, even\r\nmore certain than the first, is that rapid-fire guns alone, while\r\nthey may determine an action, cannot make it decisive. Despite the\r\nwell-established superiority of the Japanese rapid fire in that action,\r\nthe Chinese battle-ships, though overborne, were not taken. Their\r\nheaviest armor being unpierced, the engines and turret guns remained\r\neffective, and they withdrew unmolested.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE-SHIPS THAT ARE TOO LARGE\r\n\r\nThe battle-ship constituted as described remains for the present the\r\nfighting ship upon which the issues of war will depend. The type is\r\naccepted by all the leading naval states, though with considerable\r\nvariations in size. As regards the latter feature, the writer believes\r\nthat the enormous tonnage recently given is excessive, and that the\r\nreasons which support it, too numerous and various to be enumerated at\r\nlength, have the following fundamental fault: they look too much to the\r\ndevelopment of the individual ship and too little to the fact that the\r\nprime requisite of the battle-ship is facility for co-operating with\r\nother ships of its own type—facility in manœuvring together, facility\r\nin massing, facility also in subdividing when occasion demands. It\r\nmay be remarked, too, that the increase of size has gone much more to\r\nincrease of defensive power than of offensive—a result so contrary to\r\nthe universal teachings of war as of itself to suggest pausing.\r\n\r\nDoes the present hold out any probabilities of important changes in the\r\nnear future, of revolutionary changes? No. For twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears now we have been expecting from the ram and from the torpedo\r\nresults which would displace the gun from its supremacy of centuries.\r\nThose results, however, are not yet visible. No one disputes the\r\ntremendous effects of the ram and of the torpedo when successfully\r\nused; but I believe I am correct in saying that the great preponderance\r\nof professional opinion does not attribute to them a certainty, or an\r\napproach to certainty, impairing the predominance of the gun. This\r\nis not the conclusion of mere conservation in a profession naturally\r\nconservative. The fluctuations of professional opinion have been\r\nsufficiently marked and the matter sufficiently argued to dispose of\r\nthat contention. Nor is this supremacy of the gun probably a transient\r\nmatter, liable to pass away with improvements greater than those of\r\nthe last quarter of a century. The advantage of the gun depends upon\r\nconditions probably permanent—upon its greater range, its greater\r\naccuracy, its greater rapidity. The individual effect of each shot may\r\nbe less than that of a torpedo or of a ram thrust; but, as was said in\r\ncomparing very heavy guns with rapid fire, the probability of many hits\r\nprevails over the possibilities of one great blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUN AND THE TORPEDO\r\n\r\nIn none of these features is either of the other weapons likely to\r\novertake the gun. The torpedo relies mainly upon stealth, the ram\r\nmainly upon a happy chance for effective use. Both stealth and chance\r\nhave their place in war; stratagem and readiness, each in place,\r\nmay contribute much. But the decisive issues of war depend upon the\r\nhandling of masses with celerity and precision, according to certain\r\ngeneral principles of recognized universality. Afloat, such massed\r\nforce, to be wielded accurately and rapidly, must consist of units not\r\ntoo numerous because of their smallness—as torpedo craft would be—nor\r\ntoo unwieldy because of their size. We may not be able to determine\r\nyet, in advance of prolonged experience of war, just what the happy\r\nmean may be corresponding in principle to the old seventy-four, but\r\nwe may be reasonably sure that it will be somewhere in the ranks of\r\nthe present battle-ships; and that in the range, accuracy and rapidity\r\nof their gun-fire—especially when acting in fleets—will be found a\r\nprotection which the small vessels that rely upon the torpedo or ram\r\nalone will not be able to overcome, though they may in rare instances\r\nelude.\r\n\r\nConcerning the frigates and sloops of our predecessors, their place\r\nis now taken, and their duties will be done, by the classes of\r\nvessel known generically as cruisers, protected or unprotected. The\r\nprotection, the defensive element of strength, has reference mainly to\r\nthe engines, to the motive power. The battery, the offensive factor,\r\ntends upon the whole to revert more and more to the development of\r\nfire, to utilizing the length of the vessel by multiplying the number\r\nof guns and diminishing their individual size; and the tendency is\r\nincreased by the fact that, as such ships are expected to fight only\r\nvessels of their own kind, their probable target is penetrable by light\r\nguns. Speed is the great element in the efficiency of cruisers, and\r\nwhatever the speed in smooth water, a great advantage inures to larger\r\nships in heavy winds and seas. As for “armored” cruisers, of which\r\nthere are many, they belong rather to the class of battle-ships than\r\nof cruisers. Whatever the advantages of the particular ships, the name\r\nsuggests a regrettable confusion of purpose, and, in practice, a still\r\nmore regrettable departure from homogeneity.\r\n\r\n            A. T. MAHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Time and space,” a noble philosopher has observed, “are but\r\nhallucinations.” It may be so, and from the point of view of the\r\nmetaphysician ours may have been merely a “so-called nineteenth\r\ncentury.” Certain it is that to judge literature in blocks of centuries\r\nis to make a convenient but illogical cross-division. The early, and\r\nperhaps the most important, literary influences of the century were in\r\nexistence long before 1801. Thus, if we look at whatever is now called\r\n_fin de siècle_, at violent antagonism to tradition and convention, at\r\ndiscontent of every sort with everything—with rank, wealth, morality,\r\nlaw, marriage, the family—we find that this passion was as noisy\r\nand self-complacent a hundred years ago as it is to-day. The French\r\nRevolution was the lurid playground of “New Women,” full of what they\r\nsupposed to be new ideas. The German drama of 1780–1800, now best\r\nremembered by the parody called “The Rovers,” in the _Anti-Jacobin_,\r\nwas replete with the humorless paradoxes and strained situations of\r\nIbsen. The shortest way to an understanding of the antiquity of our\r\n“new ideas” is, in fact, a study of the Poetry of the _Anti-Jacobin_.\r\n\r\nRomance, again, as far as romance depends for her effects on desperate\r\ndeeds, on the rhetoric of noble brigands, on the phantasms of the\r\nsheeted dead shivering down dark passages among skeletons, on clanking\r\nchains, and on distressed damsels, was as much alive in the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century as at any age of literary history. Goethe,\r\nSchiller, Bürger, Mrs. Radcliffe, all following in the Gothic wake of\r\nhonest Horace Walpole and his _Castle of Otranto_, were preparing the\r\nground for Scott and Dumas. Once more the old “popular” elements so\r\nnecessary to literature (which, like Antæus, regains vigor on touching\r\nmother-earth) had been wholly absent from the poetry and prose of\r\nthe last reigning Stuart and of the first two Hanoverian kings of\r\nEngland. But, about 1770–1780, literature had returned to its archaic\r\npopular sources. Percy had made _volks-lieder_ fashionable, Fergusson\r\nand Burns had revived the rustic muse of Scotland, and Macpherson\r\nhad given mankind a draught, though an adulterated draught, from the\r\ncup of the sorceries of the Celtic enchantress. In opposition to the\r\nurban self-restraint and contented complacency of the Augustan age,\r\nRousseau had preached the pleasures of virtue, sentiment, and of a\r\n“blessed state of Nature”; young Werther had gotten him a stool to be\r\nsad upon, like Master Stephen: weeping was the mode. Rousseau, as Mr.\r\nPater once observed in conversation, was “the grandmother of us all,”\r\nand as tearful as Mrs. Gummidge in _David Copperfield_. Meanwhile the\r\n“emancipation” born of science had set in; people thought they knew\r\nall about everything; the elder Darwin could explain the universe\r\nwithout a God, quite as easily as any modern Darwinian, if not so\r\nelaborately. He may not have been always correct in his theories and\r\nfacts, still, there they were, and they were “emancipating.” Yet,\r\nfar from being laughed out of court by the gratifying progress of\r\nscience, a more mystical religion and a life more austere had come in\r\nfrom the preaching of Wesley, who was practically the parent of our\r\nneo-Catholicism in its varying forms. The “Oxford Movement,” with all\r\nthe strange after-symptoms which it has left behind it, is directly\r\ndescended from Wesley. Thus romance, sentiment, freedom and variety\r\nin poetic form, philanthropy, revolt against the past, return to and\r\nreverence for the past, scientific doubt, weariness of life, love\r\nof nature, wistful belief, relapse on the forms of the Church, and\r\neverything else which stamps the literature of the nineteenth century\r\nwere alive and active in the last half of the eighteenth century. The\r\nyear 1801 made no sudden break. The nineteenth century merely went on\r\nevolving the principles, revolutionary or reactionary, of the last half\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThus Crabbe, the precursor of whoever, Englishman, American, Frenchman,\r\nor Slav, has written of the sombre tragedies of the poor, was born in\r\n1754. Blake, whose perfectly un-Augustan rhapsodies and mystic lyrics\r\nwere made fashionable about 1870, was born in 1757, out of due time,\r\nfor his best side is Elizabethan in quality. Burns, born in 1759, is\r\nas much at home in the nineteenth century as Tolstoï, while Godwin\r\ncould not be more “advanced,” or Mary Wollstonecraft more of “a New\r\nWoman,” if the former belonged to our “Forward Liberals” and the latter\r\nperorated at congresses of her sex. The first twenty-five years of Miss\r\nAusten belong to the eighteenth century; yet, except for a certain\r\n“old-fashioned” primness of style, she is the first, and, beyond all\r\ndoubt, the greatest of all nineteenth-century “realistic” novelists\r\nof domestic life. For, though a “realist,” she is a humorist, and the\r\ncombination is almost unexampled. Your common realist is a gloomy\r\nthing, with no more sense of the comic than M. Zola.\r\n\r\nOf the new poets, revolutionary in metre and matter, Wordsworth,\r\nScott, Coleridge, and Southey were born in 1770–1774; they were mature\r\nbefore the nineteenth century dawned. His northern home, among the\r\nhills and lakes, fitted Wordsworth to be the austere and mystical poet\r\nof nature and of man in relation to nature. Born a poet, his genius\r\nwas determined by his environment, while his ardent sympathy with the\r\nRevolution at once turned his attention to the unregarded poor, and\r\ninspired his not wholly successful attempt to shake off the trammels\r\nof Augustan “poetic diction,” the survival of the Latinism of Boileau\r\nand Pope. Later, of course, Wordsworth became the Tory, the patriot,\r\nthe Churchman, and the Stamp Collector. But his poetical creed he never\r\nconsciously changed, though he often lapsed from it unconsciously. If\r\nScott was to be a poet at all he was fated to be influenced by the New\r\nWorld, not in its emancipated ideas, but in its wistful return to the\r\nOld World of reivers, spearmen, claymores, goblin, ghost, and fairy.\r\nThe Border ballads lulled his cradle and were the joy of his childhood\r\nand manhood. All tradition murmured to him her charms of Border and\r\nHighland legend; every ruined abbey and castle had its tale for him; to\r\nEttrick and Yarrow he needed not to say, like Lady John Scott, “Have\r\nyou no message for me?” He never had a touch of the Augustan horror\r\nof mountain and torrent, never a touch of the Augustan contempt of\r\n“Barbarism.” Walpole’s _Castle of Otranto_ and Mrs. Radcliffe’s novels\r\nof terror went to the molding of his genius, as the novels of Miss\r\nEdgeworth (born 1767) suggested fiction about the lives and manners of\r\nhis own people. In his return to the past he came, like Lamb, on the\r\nElizabethan drama, and, unlike Lamb, on the unpublished documents of\r\nthe Tudor age, the age of desperate resistance to England. But Scott\r\nwould never have been exactly the poet that he was if he had not heard\r\n“Christabel” recited. “Christabel,” the entirely original utterance\r\nof a genius which, at first, was a child of the enlightenment of the\r\neighteenth century. The early ideas of Coleridge were the ideas of\r\nRousseau and of Bernardin de Saint Pierre, who was, like Coleridge,\r\nbut more energetically, a seeker for an ideal land where pantisocracy\r\nmight flourish and a clown might be the poet’s “brother.”\r\n\r\nIn poetry, in poetic form, Coleridge was the real and daring innovator,\r\ninspired by the eighteenth century reaction against convention, and\r\nplayed on like an æolian harp by every wind of his mystic spirit. His\r\nreaction was too violent even for Lamb; his originality too extreme\r\neven for Wordsworth. In him, of all our later poets, the “unconscious\r\nself” was the strongest and the most free, and of all our poets he had\r\nthe hardest battle with the dull Augustan survival in such critics as\r\nJeffrey. To them all the ripened fruit of the blossoming time of the\r\nlate eighteenth century, the poetry of Scott and of Wordsworth, was but\r\ndimly intelligible, but Coleridge was the most unintelligible of all.\r\nFrom the Germany of the late eighteenth century came one of Scott’s\r\nsprings of poetic action; from the _Lenore_ of Bürger (a popular ballad\r\nrewritten) and from the _Götz von Berlichingen_ of Goethe. These were\r\nthe days when Scott longed to possess a skull and cross-bones, and\r\nin a love-letter dilated on his choice of a sepulchre. But what came\r\nto Coleridge from Germany was the late eighteenth century’s reaction\r\nagainst the truly “common-sense” ideas of Hume, the philosophy of Kant,\r\nSchelling, and Fichte. In this field, too, he was unintelligible (and\r\nno wonder), but he was but adapting the ideas of 1770–1800, and the\r\nneo-Hegelians of Oxford are doing the same thing. A reaction against\r\nthe materialism of common-sense was inevitable; Mesmer, Swedenborg, and\r\nKant began what survives in the hands of the Master of Balliol and of\r\nProfessor William James.\r\n\r\nIn a more recent generation Byron prolonged the Wertherism of Werther,\r\nByron being thus a grandson of Rousseau, while he borrowed his form,\r\nand borrowed it very ill, from what Scott borrowed of Coleridge. The\r\ngenius of Byron is not contested by the sane, but except in satire it\r\nseldom found clear and adequate, because it sought hurried, heedless,\r\nand tumultuous, expression. Scott had a better ear and was not so\r\nreckless an _improvisatore_. Poems that can endure are not written\r\nlike Byron’s, in the brief leisure of fashionable industry. We admire\r\nthe native impetus of Byron, his gift of satire, his sensitiveness\r\nto elemental force in nature and in man, but we cannot understand\r\nthe furore which was so much the child of his title, his beauty,\r\nhis recklessness, and his studiously cultivated air of mystery. Mr.\r\nLenville, as reported by Mr. Folair, said that Nicholas Nickleby was\r\n“a regular stick of an actor, and it’s only the mystery about him that\r\nhas caused him to go down with the people here, though Lenville says\r\nhe don’t believe there’s anything at all in it.” A later age must\r\npartly adopt the same theory of Byron’s original and unparalleled\r\nsuccess in Europe as well as in England. He was mysterious Manfred,\r\nhe was Childe Harold, he was the Corsair; a hero of Mrs. Radcliffe’s,\r\nwith an Oriental air and a gloomy secret and a heart burning with\r\nindignation against the unworthy species of men. What had Byron done?\r\nEven Goethe was curious, believing wild anecdotes; now we really do not\r\ncare what Byron did, recognizing in him, his genius, and his pose, not\r\nso much the “Satanic,” as the result of hysteria and madness in his\r\nrace. Satanism, from of old, has been mainly hysteria. The element of\r\npersonal _reclame_ in Byron has faded, and with it fades his reputation\r\nas an earth-shaking poet. Attempts to revive that fame in our day,\r\nattempts to bring us back to “the noble poet,” are respectable,\r\nbeing based on loyalty to the taste of our great-grandfathers and\r\ngrandmothers in all civilized countries. But the efforts are futile.\r\n“Byron,” says Mr. Saintsbury, “seems to me a poet distinctly of the\r\nsecond class, and not even of the best kind of second, inasmuch as\r\nhis greatness is chiefly derived from a sort of parody, a sort of\r\nimitation of the qualities of the first. His verse is to the greatest\r\npoetry what melodrama is to tragedy, what plaster is to marble, what\r\npinchbeck is to gold.” Such, however unpopular they may be, are my own\r\ncandid sentiments, for though from childhood I could and did read all\r\nour great poets with pleasure, it was not with the kind of pleasure\r\nwhich Byron in his satire and his declamation could occasionally give\r\nme. He is monotonous, he is rhetorical, his versification is often\r\nincredibly bad, and he is more obscure, mainly by dint of hurry, bad\r\nprinting, and bad grammar, than Mr. Browning. Thus Byron leaves us\r\nimpressed as with a vast, even volcanic, yet dandified force, untrained\r\nand often misdirected. Either by nature, or in reaction, he professed\r\nsympathy with the Augustan school of Queen Anne’s reign, and sided with\r\nPope in the long quarrel as to whether Pope is a poet.\r\n\r\nEven the modern opponents of Byron must recognize in him qualities\r\nwhich won the admiration and affection of Scott and Shelley. In Shelley\r\nwe had a true child of the revolution, the _Aufklarung_, and the later\r\neighteenth century. His boyhood trifled with chemical science (probably\r\nnot then popular with the human boy); his adolescence was given to\r\nconverting school-girls into “dear little atheists.” His social ideas,\r\nlike those of some advanced moderns, aimed at the absolute destruction\r\nof the family; and the moral of _Laon and Cythna_ went far behind the\r\nmorals of the most backward savages, who make incest a capital offence.\r\nShelley, a boy all his life, was more boyishly devoted to destruction\r\nthan even the newest writers on the relations of the sexes. In “making\r\nall things new” both he and they are, in fact, relapsing on a condition\r\nof society which, if it ever existed, is so old that it may be called\r\n“pre-human,” and is contrary to nature, as far as we can study human\r\nnature in the least developed of tribes. His ideas conducted Shelley\r\nto the tragedy and farce of his career: his desertion of one young\r\nwife, followed by her suicide, and his marriage with another, in entire\r\nopposition to his own opinions. In literature he began at school\r\nwith a devout following of Mrs. Radcliffe; while, in _Queen Mab_ and\r\n_Alastor_, vigorous but vague and misty _Childe Harold_, wandering in\r\nNo Man’s Land, he first displayed his originality in poetical form.\r\nHis personal character being noble and generous in the highest degree,\r\nhis sympathy with the poor and the oppressed being a true passion,\r\nShelley’s errors arose from the fixed idea that almost every human\r\nordinance must, being old, be necessarily bad. He would recognize that\r\nthere is, after all, something right in the sixth commandment, but\r\ndid not draw the inference that a gleam of reason might also be found\r\nin most of the rest of the Decalogue. The state of society then, as\r\nalways, provoked revolt, but the state of society was grievous, not\r\nbecause its moral laws were bad, but because its laws were not obeyed.\r\nShelley had no turn for narrative, and, in such poems as _The Revolt\r\nof Islam_, it is the splendid meteoric genius, the unexcelled music\r\nthat captivate. In lyrics he was probably the most original force since\r\nthe Elizabethan age: his verse is a singing and soaring flame. In\r\n_Adonis_ his righteous indignation carries him forward like an angel\r\nwith a sword of fire; and _The Witch of Atlas_ is a triumph in a new\r\n“fairy way of writing.” His is the Muse of clouds and stars, of sea and\r\ntempest, of all the aspects, and, in appearance, most capricious forces\r\nof the world, yet his is also the Muse of flowers and peaceful woods,\r\nof dejection and of delight. What the born rebel, Milton, might have\r\nbeen without the foundation and trammels of Puritanism, that Shelley\r\nwas, though his wild and tender lyric note was even more exquisite than\r\nMilton’s. Neither was, in the full sense, human, for both were without\r\nhumor, as may be seen in their humorous pieces.\r\n\r\nKeats, but three years younger than Shelley (1795), was more a true\r\nchild of the nineteenth century. His social ideas, though of course\r\nliberal, were more in abeyance; he was more exclusively an artist; and\r\nhis art was more controlled by the revived Elizabethanism of Leigh Hunt\r\n(1784). That singular man, who had so much taste, and so much of it\r\nbad; so intense a theory of social benevolence, and so keen a belief\r\nthat it was more blessed to receive than to give, “owed little” (in the\r\nway of literature) “to any but the old masters, and many contemporaries\r\nowed not a little to him.” Few owed more, for good and bad, than\r\nKeats. Virgil he had found out for himself, and had translated when a\r\nschoolboy. Spenser, too, he found for himself, and Greece he discovered\r\nafresh in Lemprière’s _Dictionary_ and in Chapman’s _Homer_. But this\r\nsuperficial euphuism and elaborate verbal quaintness he partly derived\r\nat second hand from Leigh Hunt.\r\n\r\nThat something in Leigh Hunt which suggested Harold Skimpole to\r\nDickens, and his violent conception of _The Cockney School_ to\r\nLockhart, was not hidden from Keats, and inspired him with some bitter\r\nwords. It was what he derived from Hunt that gave occasion to Keats’s\r\nassailants, who were more of political than of literary partisans.\r\nLockhart, or Wilson, or both, with the _Quarterly_ reviewer, in\r\nattacking _Endymion_ were attacking, they thought, a member of an\r\naffected, effeminate, and radical coterie. Keats himself, maturing\r\nwith the suddenness of genius, looked on _Endymion_ as thoroughly\r\nimmature. But killed, or even discouraged, by his critics he was\r\nnot, and on a page of a copy of _Lamia_ where his publishers spoke\r\nof his discouragment he wrote “This is a lie.” (The copy is in the\r\npossession of Canon Ainger.) Keats, like Burns, whom he so intensely\r\nadmired and so unerringly judged as a man and a poet, was his own\r\nbest critic. Despite his boyish lusciousness of taste, and the\r\nfever of letters written when dying, there was no manlier or more\r\nchivalrous soul in England than that of the poet of the odes to the\r\nnightingale and to autumn. Keats at his best attained sheer perfection\r\nof language, of emotion, and of thought. As he advised Shelley to be,\r\nhe was not content with less than filling all the rifts with pure\r\ngold. “Untaught,” like the minstrel of Odysseus, he combined a Greek\r\nclarity and largeness of manner with that romance which Greece does not\r\nlack, but which he possessed in a degree more conspicuous, at least\r\nto readers who are not Greeks. Though he has not been and cannot be\r\nimitated, he has supplied to Tennyson and the best moderns a standard\r\nand an ideal. That the Shakespearian copiousness of humanity and humor\r\nand dramatic genius would ever have been his nothing indicates, but\r\nwhat writer of the nineteenth century, except Scott, has possessed\r\na large share of these qualities? In poetry, not one, and it was in\r\nprose that Scott wore his fragment of the cloak of Shakespeare. For the\r\ncentury has not produced, in England or America, a great dramatic poet.\r\nIt is to fiction, to Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Stevenson, Meredith,\r\nHawthorne, George Eliot, that we must look for the humor and humanity\r\nand passion which, earlier, found their vehicle in the drama.\r\n\r\nOurs is a reading rather than a seeing century, though this does not\r\nexplain the reason which made the great novelists incapable of writing\r\nfor the stage. Of the other poets of the early century, Campbell,\r\nRogers, Moore, Landor, Hogg, and the ladies, Mrs. Hemans, and L. E. L.,\r\nand Beddoes, space does not permit us to treat. Landor’s audience\r\nhas not increased; Rogers has none; Campbell is best remembered for\r\nwar songs which I fear are overrated; Hogg, despite some exquisite\r\npassages in _Kilmeny_, and some admirable songs, suffers from his\r\ncountrymen’s exclusive devotion to Robbie Burns. When Scott turned to\r\nfiction (1814) the current of popular taste at once changed into that\r\nchannel. Byron had still his vogue; Keats, Shelley, and Coleridge then\r\nsang only to the few initiated; Wordsworth was past his prime; and\r\nwith the general public nothing was really popular but fiction, and\r\nthat fiction was Scott’s. Miss Austen is probably much more widely\r\nappreciated to-day than when she died, little noted by the world, in\r\n1817. A criticism of Scott’s novels, which first made fiction supreme\r\nand far above poetry in the estimation of “the reading public,” cannot\r\nbe attempted in this place. The best estimate of Scott, if far from\r\nmost favorable, is his own, in the introduction to _The Fortunes of\r\nNigel_. His faults of prolixity, haste, indifference to delicacy of\r\nstyle, and even to grammar; his “big bow-wow” vein (as he calls it);\r\nthe stilted theatrical language of his Catherine Glovers and Helen\r\nMacgregors—all these defects, with his hasty denouéments (as of\r\nShakespeare and Molière), are patent, are confessed, and probably deter\r\nmany readers from making profit of his humor, his rich knowledge of and\r\nsympathy with all human nature, his infrequent but exquisite touches of\r\npassion, his tragedy and comedy. None the less, Scott is the main stock\r\nof the fiction of the century. Men may now have more minute knowledge,\r\nthough so wide a knowledge has none; may have more wit, if less humor;\r\nmay eagerly hunt for all that Scott loathed and avoided in our animal\r\nnature; may, indeed must, practise a more careful style, but all the\r\nnovelists are, willy-nilly, children of Scott and Miss Austen. Dickens,\r\nindeed, owed more to Smollett (one of Scott’s chief favorites),\r\nThackeray owed more to Fielding, the “Kailyard School” owed more to\r\nGalt (1779—1839). But Scott is “the father of the rest,” above all,\r\nof Dumas; and Miss Austen is the mother. Lord Lytton and Mr. Disraeli\r\nhad, especially at first, a tinge of Byronism, later developing on\r\ntheir own lines: Mr. Disraeli’s political; Lord Lytton’s multifarious,\r\nincluding the line of modern mysticism, now often worked. Scott lived\r\nto be interested in Lytton, and might have seen (though probably he did\r\nnot see them) the little-noted beginnings of Browning and Tennyson,\r\nabout 1830.\r\n\r\nWhat he did see, and admire, was the performance of Cooper, with whom\r\nactual and living American fiction may perhaps be said to take its\r\nrise. In England, Cooper was regarded as the Scott of America; and it\r\nis to be regretted that Lockhart did not excise a splenetic personal\r\nreference to Cooper in Sir Walter’s _Journal_. He was old, tired, and\r\nfatigued with the pressure of society in Paris when he wrote. Cooper\r\nhad the genius to appropriate the unworked fields of American patriotic\r\nseafaring life, and of the manners of the Red Man; he is “Cooper of the\r\nwood and wave.” Eagerly were his works read by boys, when Thackeray was\r\na boy, and when I was a boy. Never shall his readers forget the “Long\r\nCarabine,” to whom Thackeray was devoted, and Uncas, and Chingachgook.\r\n\r\n    “Still we love the Delaware,\r\n    And still we hate the Mingos.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless Cooper’s Indians are not “realistically” treated, though\r\nthere is infinitely more of truth in his dignified hunters and warriors\r\nthan people conversant only with the Red Man of to-day are ready to\r\nbelieve. But Cooper, probably, does not live with the immortality of\r\nhis first renowned successor, Hawthorne, who, for secure perfection of\r\nform, is to modern fiction what Keats is to modern poetry. Like Scott,\r\nHawthorne is the unforced fruit of his ancestry and the society into\r\nwhich he was born—a Puritan, not a Cavalier artist, with a background\r\nof austere faith and of old superstition, differentiated from that of\r\nthe Covenanters by the shadow of deep forests and of struggles with\r\nthe Indians and the wild things of the woods. These had passed into\r\nmellow memories, as, for Scott, had passed the age of witches, fairies,\r\nreivers, and claymores. Entirely, in the _Scarlet Letter_, as by way\r\nof hereditary influence in the _House of Seven Gables_, Hawthorne\r\nreproduced what was old, making it poetically enduring. _His Mosses\r\nfrom an Old Manse_, and other brief tales set the fashion, except by\r\nPoe, long unfollowed, of the _conte_. Neither author has been excelled\r\nin his own portion of this field. Hawthorne’s haunted consciences,\r\nPoe’s treasure tale, his detective stories, and his tales of terror\r\nremain unequalled, though so profusely imitated. This epoch, say from\r\n1830 to 1855, was a kind of classical interspace in the literature of\r\nthe century. France, preoccupied by war in the first thirty years of\r\nthe age, now awoke to her own famous romantic era, with Hugo, Dumas,\r\nMusset, Gautier, George Sand, Sainte-Beuve, Mérimée—names of the\r\nhighest. Germany, to the non-Teutonic world, is, in poetry, represented\r\nby Heine, and, in science, philosophy, philology, and history by a\r\ngalaxy of innovators ingenious and industrious. America saw Hawthorne,\r\nPoe, Lowell, Holmes, Whittier, Ticknor, Prescott, Motley, Longfellow,\r\nBryant, Emerson, in their prime; while England had Carlyle, Tennyson,\r\nNewman, Browning, the Brontës, Kingsley, Thackeray, Dickens, and\r\nRuskin, all recognized and flourishing.\r\n\r\nWe look around and see, as Mr. Stevenson says in a letter, that “the\r\nsuns have set,” while we are scarcely conscious of new dawns. Who can\r\nexplain, by circumstances of social evolution and historical event,\r\nthe rising and the setting of such constellations of genius? It is\r\nnot enough to speak of the democratic demand, naturally indifferent\r\nto style, for never was style the object of such anxious research,\r\nexcept in other ages of euphuism. Encouragement is even overabundant;\r\n“masterpieces” are announced every week, and forgotten every year. It\r\nmay be the prejudice of hoary eld, but I must confess that our new\r\nliterature does not seem to me to show such promise of permanence as\r\nthe literature of 1830–1860 gave, and, so far, has fulfilled. Has\r\nfulfilled in spite of our sneers at the “early Victorian,” which\r\nwas not socialistic, or evolutionist and Darwin-ridden, and was\r\n“respectable,” and did avert its eyes from all that most people in\r\nreal life don’t care to stare at. This “prudery” was no new thing. The\r\nGreeks, in except some late decadents and in the old comedy, have a\r\n“prudish” literature. The Latin classics are not in the taste of M.\r\nZola. The age of Chaucer, the age of Elizabeth, were grossly frank,\r\nthat of the Restoration was frankly lewd, but we have sought out\r\nmany inventions over which Sedley and Rochester would not have cared\r\nto linger. Their grossness was gay; ours is morbidly squalid. Such\r\nthings are absent from the work of Hawthorne and Holmes, Longfellow,\r\nDickens, Thackeray, and the rest. Such things we now treat of, greatly\r\ndaring, and somehow our elders appear apt to outlaugh and outlive us as\r\nhumorists, novelists, and poets. It is strange.\r\n\r\nInto the merits of that remarkable middle age of the century we cannot\r\nenter in much detail. Tennyson holds unimperilled the throne of the\r\npoet of the time. That his thought is not especially penetrating,\r\nwhether he deals with the intricacies of human character, or with the\r\nproblems of the universe, may be readily admitted. But I am unaware\r\nthat any poet has yet “got the absolute into a corner,” or solved\r\nthe problems of the universe. Tennyson, more than people suppose,\r\nwas, personally, a mystic, with his own mystic experiences; and his\r\nphilosophy was influenced by them. He “followed the Gleam.” Neither\r\nin the _Idylls of the King_ nor in plays, was dramatic rendering\r\nof character his forte. His forte was charm, and music, and the\r\ninterpretation of nature. In these he is the equal of the Mantuan, is\r\nthe Virgil of the modern world, “golden branch among the shadows.”\r\nMoreover, he has infinite variety: from _Mariana_ to _Fatima_ and\r\n_Rizpah_; from the _Lotos-Eaters_, which “adds a new charm” after the\r\n_Faërie Queene_, to the _Northern Farmer_, from _Ulysses_ to _Crossing\r\nthe Bar_. The early _Morte d’Arthur_ is of unsurpassed nobility and\r\nmagic; the last poem, _Crossing the Bar_, is no less pre-eminent in\r\nthese qualities. Tennyson, in short, had genius; new, as all genius\r\nis new, and no occasional defects of taste or temper can impair the\r\nsplendor and richness of his gift to the world, nor the immortality of\r\nhis fame.\r\n\r\nHis contemporary, Browning, had the misfortune to attract, by his\r\nfaults, the people who wish to believe themselves clever, because\r\nthey labor at appreciating passages which the poet had made obscure.\r\nDarkness is not depth, nor is obscurity a merit. From his letters it\r\nis plain that Mr. Browning had not the gift of lucid expression; from\r\nhis poems it is manifest that he had not, in a high degree, the gift of\r\nverbal music and of charms. His gift of the grotesque, very real and\r\noriginal, was also his snare. In _Christmas Eve_ and _Easter Day_, with\r\n_Men and Women_, we have the true essence of Browning at his best; we\r\nhave his dramatic lyrics, with their amazing abundance of character and\r\nvariety of measure. After the first fascinating volume _The Ring and\r\nthe Book_ became monotonous. One song in _Paracelsus_, to myself, seems\r\nworth all the dissection of character in the blank verse. There are\r\nmany who find a kind of spiritual help in such pieces as _Prospice_.\r\nThere are thousands who find in _Men and Women_ a sort of intellectual\r\nenjoyment (or entertainment) which they can derive from no other poet\r\nwho ever lived. An energy, life, and sympathy, breaking forth in\r\nfresh, unheard-of ways; vocal in strange, piercing, untried measures:\r\nthese are the imperishable qualities of Browning. Look at his rendering\r\nof the Agamemnon: such is his version of life. The poetry of Æschylus\r\nis not there: “_carmina desunt_”; but there is a new, odd, unexpected\r\nrendering of the tragedy. So poignant and broken, sad, glad, grotesque,\r\nand pitiful, was Browning’s rendering of life. He was “ever a fighter”:\r\nno poet is more exempt from whining and despair. Destiny linked him\r\nwith Mrs. Browning, whose genius, sincere and original, is apt to be\r\nobscured by palpable faults of manner, emotion, and even rhyme, on\r\nwhich it is superfluous to dwell. Her merits, and some of her defects,\r\nmade Mrs. Browning the most popular of women poets in England, except,\r\nperhaps, Miss Ingelow. Both, in the crowd of accomplished versifiers,\r\nappear as true poets, though both, no doubt, fail to reach the place of\r\nMiss Christina Rossetti, who never can be popular.\r\n\r\nThe matter of popularity is full of puzzles and paradoxes. Tennyson\r\nwas popular, yet great because he is popular. There was a moment when\r\npopularity without permanence might have been expected for Longfellow.\r\nThe excellence of his moral intentions was then more obvious than the\r\npoetry. Such early pieces as _Excelsior_ and _The Psalm of Life_ yield\r\nodd results on analysis. But not much better can be said for the _Queen\r\nof the May_, and for parts of _The Miller’s Daughter_. In these is a\r\nmarvellous dexterity in sinking. But sink, and remain sunk, was as\r\nlittle characteristic of Longfellow as of Tennyson. He was a true poet,\r\nin his lyrics, even in his translations, as well as in _Evangeline_,\r\nand that excellent experiment _Hiawatha_, where the measure of the\r\nFinnish popular poems is applied to the not dissimilar legends of\r\nanother woodland race. But Longfellow lacked that undefinable quality\r\nof the rare, the strange, the hitherto unheard yet delightful note\r\nwhich now and again is heard in the verse of Edgar Poe. He was an\r\nIshmaelite in literature, his hand against every man’s hand, and\r\nhence seems to be less admired where he was personally known than in\r\nFrance and England. It is not the famous _Raven_, but such pieces\r\nas _To Helen_, _the Sleeper_, and at most a dozen others which give\r\nPoe his high place in the judgment of his admirers. Not his ideas,\r\nbut the beauty of his haunting lines, confers on him the laurel. Of\r\nBryant, as a rule, and of Whittier almost always, the reverse is the\r\ntruth. The acceptability of their ideas, the refined simplicity, not\r\nthe natural magic, of their form, are their claims to renown. Except\r\nin a few places, as in such as his _Commemoration Ode_, Mr. Lowell\r\nis better remembered for the wit and vigor of his Biglow poems than\r\nfor his serious verse, at least in England; while Emerson’s prose has\r\nprecedence here over his poetry. The wisdom of the East and West,\r\nblended with his happy, courageous temper, made Emerson a corrective\r\nCarlyle, while Thoreau is the complement of Emerson.\r\n\r\nConcerning the great Victorian novelists, Thackeray and Dickens,\r\nso much is daily written that remark is superfluous. A master of\r\nobservation of all that had rarely been observed, a generous heart,\r\nan original and abundant humorist, the greatest source of mirth\r\nin our century, Dickens appears to wear less well than his rival.\r\nThe unapproached merits of Thackeray’s style must preserve him in\r\nliterature; his pathos is rare and unforced; his form of humor is as\r\npermanent as that of Fielding, and as successfully matched by his\r\nphrasing. Even his verse, mirthful or melancholy, does not fade, and\r\nhas its own place on the borderland of poetry. George Eliot’s fame,\r\ntoo, must revive the success of her earlier and more humorous novels,\r\nbefore she became too fond of the Spencerian philosophy, and took\r\nherself too seriously, a natural result of adulation. Charlotte\r\nBrontë, in the same way, has been, as it were, rediscovered amid\r\na chorus of fresh applauses, and with perhaps rather too curious\r\ninvestigations. In America, after Hawthorne, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes\r\nand Mrs. Beecher Stowe were the novelists most generally admired in\r\nEngland, when Thackeray and Dickens were verging to their decline. It\r\nis, indeed, to be regretted that Dr. Holmes did not write more fiction\r\nwhen in his prime. His excellent and original _Elsie Venner_, and\r\n_Guardian Angel_, with their humorous pictures of real life and their\r\nthread of phantasy, half mystical, half scientific, border (as often\r\nin the _Poet_ and _Professor at the Breakfast Table_) on the ground of\r\n“psychical research.” Dr. Holmes was not merely, in verse and prose,\r\nan exquisite wit, but a man of rare knowledge, a man of science, and a\r\nsturdy defender of the purity of the language. Mrs. Beecher Stowe, on\r\nthe other hand, took the world by storm with a vivid tract in the form\r\nof fiction; a book now not easy to criticise, but which can still move\r\nto laughter and tears. It is my “insular ignorance” which prevents me\r\nfrom appreciating other American fictions of that age, before the days\r\nof writers still happily living and working: Mark Twain, Bret Harte,\r\nW. D. Howells, Henry James, and scores of others, who, being here\r\nto speak for themselves, shall not be commented upon in this place.\r\nWith Mr. Howells, as a critic, I have tried to break lances, while\r\nready to admit one of his main contentions, that the art of Scott,\r\nThackeray, Dickens, and others of our fathers would have profited much\r\nby being a finer art, by condensation, by omission, by avoidance of the\r\nsuperfluous. But that our modern fiction is a greater art, that romance\r\nand story-telling and adventure are obsolete, or ought to be obsolete,\r\nthat I can never admit while human nature is human nature. Mankind\r\nwill never be content, in fiction, with tales of the psychology of\r\nthe ordinary person; ordinary as we are, we desire to be, like Homer’s\r\nHeracles, conversant with great adventures. Mr. Howells perhaps may\r\nthink Aristotle a Greek snob when he maintains that tragedy must find\r\nits theme in the sorrows of the god-descended kings. Are not the griefs\r\nof the poor or of the middle classes as poignant? They are; but they\r\ndo not involve such heights and depths of fortune, raising or wrecking\r\nwhole states, as do the woes “of Thebes, or Atreus’s line.” The fall\r\nof Prince Charles from an hour even of shadowy royalty, from the\r\nleadership of an army, from the wondering admiration of Europe and the\r\napplause of Voltaire into the subject and dependent sot is an example\r\nof modern historical tragedy; in its elevation and its decline more apt\r\nto move “pity and terror” than the circumstance that a journalist has\r\ntaken to drink.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of America, so in that of England, I cannot enter into\r\nthe merits of living novelists in so wide a task as the brief review of\r\na century. Mr. Meredith, as a veteran of the 60’s, has shown, perhaps,\r\nfully what is the nature of his achievement; he shines as a creator\r\nof character (the highest praise) and as a writer with a thoroughly\r\noriginal view of the world, as a poet and as a wit. That his manner is\r\nentirely fortunate, and not rather tinged with wilful eccentricities\r\nlike those of Browning and Carlyle, can scarcely be disputed. An\r\naccomplished young novelist has admitted to me that his manner is\r\n“catching,” and that he has to struggle against half-conscious efforts\r\nat imitation. Others do not struggle; and most grow older before they\r\nare able to write like themselves, with their own voices. Even Mr.\r\nStevenson was caught now and then, his own voice being original indeed,\r\nbut yet full of memories of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nand even of the Cameronian writers. To my mind Mr. Stevenson was the\r\ngreatest, or, at least, the most enjoyable, of our novelists since\r\nGeorge Eliot, excelling in matter and form, though probably always\r\nprevented by thwarting circumstances from doing himself complete\r\njustice. He practically revived in England the novel historical, now so\r\nabundantly practised, and practised with spirit, by Mr. Stanley Weyman,\r\nMr. Anthony Hope, Dr. Conan Doyle, Mr. A. E. W. Mason, and a regiment\r\nof followers. The novel scientific, as in the hands of Mr. Wells, and\r\nthe novel of adventure, “beyond the bounds of known romanticism,” as in\r\nMr. Rider Haggard’s works, with the detective novel and the Oriental\r\nand imperialistic romances of Mr. Kipling, prove that man will not be\r\nsatisfied with domestic realism alone. I never thought he would! Mr.\r\nKipling’s astonishing powers of vision, his habit of ruthlessly cutting\r\nthe superfluous, and his amazing command of technicalities, help to\r\naccount for his world-wide fame. But the greatest of these is vision,\r\nnot an acquired result of thought, but a gift of Heaven. The age has\r\nalso produced a wealth of novels with a purpose. Would that the authors\r\ncould be induced to state their purposes squarely, in undecorative\r\ntreatises! But I confess that the treatises would not be read. The\r\nspecialism of modern science has also invaded fiction, and some authors\r\nfind a county or a parish wide enough for the work of a lifetime. The\r\ndistrict has its dialect, and who can reprove it when spoken by the\r\ncreatures of Mr. Barrie and Mr. Crockett? This kind of fiction is the\r\nresult of our desire to learn (through novels) about the lives of\r\nall sorts and conditions of men. _Enfin_, the whole scope of mortal\r\nexistence is now the _farrage libelli_ of the novelists who range from\r\nprehistoric man to Bethnal Green; from Thrums to Central Africa. There\r\nis not the same eagerness to read history, which James II. regarded as\r\n“more instructive, and quite as amusing.” My heart is here with King\r\nJames, and I confess to gaining more entertainment from Carlyle’s\r\n_Frederick the Great_ than from most novels.\r\n\r\nThe earlier historians, from Scott to Carlyle, Macaulay and Froude,\r\nplaced the human interest in the front rank. They conceived that\r\nhistory had to do with human beings of passions, caprices, moods,\r\nloves, and hates, dwelling in a world of interesting costumes, arms,\r\narchitecture, ideas, and beliefs. Thus Carlyle, with much research,\r\ncreated his Cromwell or his Frederick, as Scott created his Queen\r\nMary, his Louis XI., his James VI., or his Cromwell in _Woodstock_,\r\nwho is not too remote from Carlyle’s. For these reasons Scott, Froude,\r\nCarlyle, and Macaulay really are “amusing” as well as instructive\r\nhistorians. When institutions and constitutions had to be described\r\nthey were placed in separate compartments, as in the works of Hallam\r\nand Bishop Stubbs. Historians studied manuscripts, of course, but it\r\nwas not held that only the unprinted was the valuable, that a new\r\nsurvey of known matter was absolutely valueless.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the century we have history which is not “as interesting\r\nas a novel” (like that of Prescott, Motley, Froude, and Macaulay), but\r\nvery far from gay. Novelty of research is, quite justly, insisted upon\r\n(though research is as old as Hemingburgh, and was much advanced by\r\nGibbon, Carter, Rymer, Walpole, Tytler, and so on) till, by a natural\r\nerror, every scrap won from a wilderness of charters is valued beyond\r\nits deserts. The human interest is frowned upon; movements of forces,\r\npolitical and social, are treated in preference to personal character\r\nand adventure. Meticulous accuracy is insisted upon, till nervous\r\nstudents are actually afraid to publish. Even Mommsen, greatest of\r\noriginal students, is regarded as frivolous, even Curtius as “popular”\r\nby the modern school. It is natural to man to run into these excesses\r\nof reaction. Froude is not often accurate, Macaulay has prejudices,\r\neven Mr. Freeman was not sound about Knights’ Fees and about a certain\r\npalisade. Now the public does not care about Knights’ Fees or about\r\nthe Manor, much; nor even about the obscure early history of civic\r\ninstitutions. In fact, even references to authorities frighten away\r\npart of the public, whose timidity I do not applaud. The results of our\r\nfrivolity and of the portentous gravity of some modern historians is\r\nthat, since Mr. Green, scarcely any writer of history is read except\r\nfor examinations. As long as historians declare (often with perfect\r\ntruth) that their own works are not literature, but something far more\r\nawful and solemn, namely science, history must be unpopular. But we are\r\nonly waiting for a man of genius as accurate as the most meticulous,\r\nand as interesting as the agreeably irresponsible Froude. Of science\r\nI am not to treat, so I am dispensed from remarks on our scientific\r\nmodern historians. It is certain that in collecting and printing and\r\ncalendaring documents the age in all countries has shown praiseworthy\r\nindustry, while Mr. Parkman in America, like our mid-century\r\nhistorians, was not too scientific to be readable.\r\n\r\nOf theology, except when recommended by the art of a Newman or\r\na Jowett, nothing is here to be said; though I could cheerfully\r\nsay a good deal, especially about Biblical criticism. But that is\r\nscience, though scarcely the sort of science which has been defined\r\nas “organized common-sense.” The poetry of the late century in\r\nEngland boasts the names of Rossetti, William Morris, Matthew Arnold,\r\nand Mr. Swinburne. It is tinged, in the former with mediævalism\r\nderived from the Italians and Chaucer; while in Mr. Swinburne every\r\nconceivable literary influence, from the Greeks to Baudelaire, from\r\nthe Elizabethans to Victor Hugo, makes itself abundantly conspicuous.\r\nThese poets, younger than Matthew Arnold, are not much influenced by\r\nWordsworth, though by Shelley Mr. Swinburne was influenced. On the\r\nother hand, Mr. Arnold was a modern, academic, heterodox Wordsworth,\r\nand often a truly delightful poet.\r\n\r\nHe stood much aloof from the contemporary literature of his day, and\r\nhis letters prove that he was no fervent admirer even of Tennyson\r\nor Browning. His own poetry has been to many, as to myself, full of\r\ndelightful passages, whether he wrote of the Oxford country-side, or\r\nof Wordsworth’s hills, of “the shorn and parcelled Oxus,” or of the\r\nmoaning sea that Sophocles long ago heard as he heard it on Dover\r\nbeach. He was our greatest modern elegiac poet; a master of the Dirge.\r\nOf the living, again, no criticism can be offered; we only note the\r\nnames, and real if very various merits, of Mr. Robert Bridges, Mr.\r\nWatson, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Dobson, Mr. Benson, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Henley,\r\nMr. Gosse, Mr. Stephen Philips, Mrs. Marriott Watson, Mrs. Maynell,\r\nMr. Kipling, “a nest of singing birds.” It would be impertinent, and\r\nindeed perilous, to “draw invidious distinctions,” as the undergraduate\r\nsaid about the major and minor prophets: nor is it for this century to\r\nsift the poetic sheep from the goats, who, in an age that reads little\r\npoetry, are greatly guilty of much verse.\r\n\r\nThe unassuming and decried art of criticism remains. Essays are of no\r\none age; there are similar excellences in every good essayist since\r\nMontaigne. We have no Hazlitt, Lamb, or Leigh Hunt, but we had Mr.\r\nStephenson and Mr. Pater, so unlike in all but conscious interest in\r\nstyle, and reminiscence of the best models. Indeed, essay writing is\r\nalmost an unpractised art, as the public “has no use for it,” any more\r\nthan for the letter H on the Sandwich boards. A fairly bad novelist\r\ncan live; to an appallingly bad novelist the workhouse unfolds its\r\nawful valves. In literary criticism Mr. Arnold stood alone in his\r\nage, and Mr. Arnold’s literary income, it is known, surprised, when\r\nstated, the Commissioners of Income Tax: not by its affluence. Of\r\nliving critics it would be in the highest degree dangerous to say a\r\nword, though many words, both of praise and dispraise, might be said\r\nof a person of reckless character. That (with obvious exceptions) most\r\ncritics are men intimately familiar with what is best, from Homer\r\nto Mr. Stephen Philips, few students would venture to aver. That we\r\n(for am I not the least of all critics, and not worthy to be called\r\na critic?) are entirely devoid of ignorance, personal bias, likes,\r\ndislikes, prejudices, pet aversions, indolence, we are not so blindly\r\nconceited as to maintain. We have been taught by many centuries of\r\ncreative geniuses, from Theocritus to the latest protesting popular\r\nnovelists, to know our proper place, and we take refuge in “confession\r\nand avoidance.” The new century will not know our names when we pass\r\nwhere Dennis and where Cibber are, unless Mr. Robert Buchanan writes a\r\nnew _Dunciad_.\r\n\r\nThe century, even if we are in full decadence (of which we are not\r\nthe best judges), has been glorious in literature, and holds its own\r\nwell with any in modern history. English itself has passed from the\r\noccasionally stilted Augustan survival, through the novelties of\r\nMacaulay, De Quincey, and Carlyle, and the early decorated of Mr.\r\nRuskin, into slipshod slang in one extreme, and euphuism in the other.\r\nBut the main stream keeps its course, and English may be written with\r\nperfect purity, and with new fluency and variety, by the men for whom\r\nthe task is reserved by fate. But what does the century bequeath by way\r\nof intellectual motive? Little but the more or less transformed forces\r\nof the eighteenth century. There is science, but science, happily, is\r\nbeginning to be aware that she is not really omniscient. Conceivably\r\nher foot is on the border of a new region, often surmised, never\r\nexplored, full of light on the problems of spirit and matter. Hence,\r\nindeed, might come a new force in letters. Again, the social ideas of\r\n1750–1800 may take practical shapes of incalculable momentousness, but\r\nthese would not for long be favorable to literature. Or, less probably,\r\nthe return on the past may assume practical shape, though this element\r\nof the later eighteenth century may seem, as far as letters go, to be\r\nexhausted. In brief, as I began by saying, the division of literary\r\nperiods by measures of time is a cross-division. This peculiarity the\r\nlast hundred years possess: that literature now blossoms on a far\r\nwider field. English-speaking America had, indeed, a literature long\r\nbefore the War of Independence; but it was not a literature for every\r\nreader of to-day. Now, and for long, the States have taken their own\r\npart in history, fiction, poetry, and all other branches of letters.\r\nGermany came back into world literature again just at the ending of the\r\neighteenth century, after unregarded ages of neglect. Russia and the\r\nScandinavian North awoke about the same time, and daily widen their\r\ninfluence, as does Belgium in the sunshine of Maeterlinck. France, of\r\ncourse, has in all time been in the foremost rank; while to balance\r\nAmerica, Russia, and the North, Italy and Spain have scarcely held\r\nthe place which through so many centuries was their own. Such changes\r\nin national literatures resemble the political waxings and wanings\r\nof national fortunes. The English-speaking peoples may have their\r\neclipse; perhaps it is heralded by a modern comparative deficiency in\r\nhumor which, if England and America cease to laugh, will die out of a\r\nprofoundly solemn world.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing remarks little has been said about the literature\r\nof the century except among English-speaking peoples. Not being a\r\nMezzofanti, I am not personally acquainted with the literature of all\r\nlanguages, and it is a vain thing to speak of books at second hand.\r\nIt was not the nineteenth but the eighteenth century that saw Germany\r\nre-enter the field of pure literature, as distinguished from that of\r\nscholarship and science. Since the end of the Middle Ages, with their\r\npoets, German writers had mainly been devoted to theology and classical\r\ncriticism. Latin was the language of the learned. Many ascertainable\r\ncauses, in the middle and end of the eighteenth century, and doubtless\r\nmany causes which cannot be ascertained, awoke again the Teutonic\r\ngenius. The victories of Frederick the Great gave Germans patriotism\r\nand confidence in their own tongue.\r\n\r\nThe philosophic and social works which preluded to the French\r\nRevolution stirred the German mind and required popular expression.\r\nThus Kant wrote in his own native speech in reaction against the\r\nsceptical philosophy of David Hume, and Kant became the father of\r\nthe long array of German metaphysicians from Hegel and Fichte to\r\nSchopenhauer and Hartmann. Their philosophy “cannot be briefly stated,\r\nespecially in French,” as one of them said, but its general effect\r\nhas been rather to counteract materialism by making it pretty plain\r\nthat human nature is not so simple and easily to be explained as the\r\nScottish philosophers were apt to suppose. In England, Coleridge gave\r\nan Anglican heart to the new German philosophy, which also influenced\r\nHamilton, and still affects the philosophical teaching of Oxford.\r\n“It is nonsense, but is it _the right sort_ of nonsense?” asked the\r\nlate Professor Sidgwick (a Cambridge man) when struggling with the\r\nexamination papers of a Hegelian undergraduate.\r\n\r\nMore important as literature were the double influences of return on\r\nthe mediæval past and of inspiration by the new political and social\r\nideas which gave the impulse to the genius of Goethe, Schiller,\r\nBürger, and others. Goethe began as the child of Rousseau, but as a\r\nchild who had read Kant, and drunk deep of the romance of the Middle\r\nAges. Doubtless his is the greatest name of modern Germany, both as\r\na student of life, of nature, of history, and of thought. He was the\r\nspiritual parent of Scott, with his _Götz von Berlichingen_, and,\r\nwith Richter, of Carlyle. Through himself and his English or Scottish\r\ndisciples, Goethe has been the most fertile source of change in the\r\nliterature of the nineteenth century. In extreme old age, curious\r\nto say, he gave the first impulse to the study of early religion as\r\ndisplayed in the obscure rites and beliefs of the Australian natives:\r\na theme remote enough from his effect on the poetry of Matthew Arnold.\r\nProbably the two parts of his _Faust_ and his _Roman Lyrics_ are the\r\nmost popular, and, as literature, the most permanent parts of his work,\r\nwith _Werther_, _Wilhelm Meister_, and _Elective Affinities_, in prose.\r\nSchiller, beginning with the boyish romanticism of _The Robbers_,\r\nbecame a kind of classic in his later dramas. Lessing and Winckelmann\r\nwere the most sound and fertile influences in criticism. _The Laocoon_\r\nremains indispensable. The patriotic lyrists resurrected the national\r\nspirit of the Teutonic race, and Heine, Hebrew by race and half French\r\nin character, combined the characteristics of Lucian, Burns, and\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\nWolf, writing in Latin (and I believe that his work on Homer has never\r\nattained a third edition, and has never been translated into English),\r\nbecame the parent, for good or evil, of what is called the Higher\r\nCriticism, Lachmann introducing the painfully conjectural tendencies\r\nof that intellectual exercise. Its application to scriptural texts is\r\nnotorious, but not precisely as part of literature. Like other European\r\ncountries, the Germany of the close of the century is not remarkable\r\nfor resplendent genius in poetry or fiction, though novels abound. The\r\nscientific, historical, and scholarly literature is of vast profusion.\r\nIn thoroughness and tireless patience, Germany is the teacher of the\r\nworld, while in curious contrast to her practical genius is the love\r\nof some of her scholars for baseless conjecture. The “insularity”\r\nwith which the English are charged is a matter of reproach by French\r\nscholars against Germany. Some sets of ideas, long familiar in America,\r\nEngland, and the Latin nations, are only now beginning to reach German\r\nclassical scholars.\r\n\r\nTo write an account of the changes in French literature during the\r\ncentury is impossible within moderate space. The revolutionary and\r\nNapoleonic wars were unfavorable to the literary art, and the head\r\nof so great a poet as André Chénier fell under the guillotine. Till\r\nabout 1825–1830 the Restoration was accompanied by literature in the\r\nold classic style of Boileau and of the Augustan age, only enlivened\r\nby the romantic if somewhat affected style of that great rhetorician,\r\nChâteaubriand. The year 1830 is the sacred year of French romanticism,\r\ndrawing its ideals partly from the German romantic movement, partly\r\nfrom Scott and Shakespeare, read, of course, only in translations.\r\nEverything was now to be mediæval, Spanish, and passionate: the drama\r\nwas to be emancipated from Aristotle, also read in translations. As\r\nfar as classicism went the young adventurers had no more Greek than\r\nShakespeare or Scott. But they had the colossal and Titanic genius\r\nof Hugo, exquisitely sweet, rapid, strange, and versatile in lyric:\r\npotent, if inflated, in the drama and the novel. They had the charming\r\nhumor and exquisite taste of Théophile Gautier; the feverish passion\r\nand mastery in verse of Alfred de Musset; the delicate, dreamy, and\r\nwandering spirit of Gérard de Nerval; and the manly, courageous,\r\nhumorous, and unwearied vigor, in drama and in fiction, of Alexandre\r\nDumas.\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, an extraordinary generation, by far the greatest\r\nsince that of Corneille, Racine, and Molière. Many others might be\r\nnamed: the reserved force and incisive irony of Mérimée; the learned\r\nand genial criticism of Sainte-Beuve; the inexhaustible talent of\r\nGeorge Sand, and the mighty Balzac, the maker and founder of the modern\r\nwork of introspection. Probably, of all these writers, Dumas and Balzac\r\nhave exercised most influence on later fiction in England and America.\r\nFlaubert continued, with painful elaboration, the traditions of Balzac;\r\nfrom Flaubert, and round him, grew up Daudet and M. Zola, and the\r\nGoncourts. Poetry, after Lamartine, dwindled into the prettinesses of\r\nthe Parnasse and the eccentricities, too obviously intentional, of\r\nBaudelaire, Verlaine, and the Symbolistes. Literary art, at the end\r\nof the century, became too self-conscious, too fond of argument about\r\nideals and methods, the tattle of the studio. Great men have not thus\r\ndissipated their energy; they have done what they could do; they have\r\nnot talked about how they did it. What English literature was borrowed\r\nfrom France, at this time, is more in the nature of words than work.\r\nCriticism has been a _chimaera bombinans in vacuo_, chattering about\r\nrealism, naturalism, symbolism, the use of documents, and so forth.\r\nThe defects, rather than the merits, of France have been imitated; a\r\nsqualid pessimism is easily affected.\r\n\r\nThe closing century has seen Russia awake, as the close of the\r\neighteenth century beheld the literary revival of Germany. Russian\r\npoetry has only reached the learned among us: the novels of\r\nTurguenieff, Dustoiefsky, and Tolstoï are read in translation, with\r\ncuriosity, antipathy, enthusiasm, and an absence of that emotion. It\r\nis very long since Terentianus Maurus remarked that the fortunes of\r\na book depended on the taste of the reader. Often he is favorably\r\nimpressed, not by the actual merit of the story as a story or as a work\r\nof literary art, but by its appeal to his private sentiments, as of\r\nsocialism, pessimism, toryism, or whatever they may be. Possibly the\r\nvehement admirers of some Russian writers have been thus misguided.\r\nIn any case, no qualified critic thinks that his opinion of works\r\nwhich he cannot read in the original language is of any value. For\r\nthis reason I need not offend or please the reader by offering any\r\nuninstructed sentiments about the great Scandinavian dramatist, Dr.\r\nIbsen; or concerning the work of Signor d’Annunzio, or the plays of\r\nM. Maeterlinck. To pronounce each of these gentlemen a Shakespeare\r\nor Æschylus is not unusual in cultivated circles; it remains for the\r\nnew century to ratify or quash the verdict. In the mean time, have\r\nthe approving critics taken the precaution of reading Æschylus and\r\nShakespeare?\r\n\r\n            ANDREW LANG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material prosperity of the last century is due to the co-operation\r\nof three classes of men: the man of science, who lives only for truth\r\nand the discovery of nature’s laws; the inventor, eager to apply these\r\ndiscoveries to money-making machines and processes, and the engineer,\r\ntrained in mathematical investigation and in knowledge of the physical\r\nconditions which govern his profession, which is the mechanical\r\napplication of the laws of nature.\r\n\r\nEngineering is sometimes divided into civil, military, and naval\r\nengineering. The term civil engineering, which will be here described,\r\nis often used by writers as covering structural engineering only, but\r\nit has a much wider meaning.\r\n\r\nThe logical classification is: statical engineering, including that of\r\nall fixed bodies, and dynamical, covering the movement of all bodies by\r\nthe development and application of power.\r\n\r\nStatical engineering can be again subdivided into structural\r\nengineering, or that of railways, highways, bridges, foundations,\r\ntunnels, buildings, etc.; also, into hydraulic engineering, which\r\ngoverns the application of water to canals, river improvements,\r\nharbors, the supply of water to towns and for irrigation, disposal of\r\nsewage, etc.\r\n\r\nDynamical engineering can be divided into mechanical engineering,\r\nwhich covers the construction of all prime motors, the transmission of\r\npower, and the use of machines and machine tools. Closely allied is\r\nelectrical engineering, the art of the transformation and transmission\r\nof energy for traction, lighting, telegraphy, telephoning, operating\r\nmachinery, and many other uses, such as its electrolytic application to\r\nores and metals.\r\n\r\nThen we have the combined application of statical, mechanical, and\r\nelectrical engineering to what is now called industrial engineering,\r\nor the production of articles useful to man. This may be divided into\r\nagricultural, mining, metallurgical, and chemical engineering.\r\n\r\nSurely this is a vast field, and can only be hastily described in the\r\nsketch which we are about to give.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest of all. We have not been able to surpass the works\r\nof the past in grandeur or durability. The pyramids of Egypt still\r\nstand, and will stand for thousands of years. Roman bridges, aqueducts,\r\nand sewers still perform their duties. Joseph’s canal still irrigates\r\nLower Egypt. The great wall of China, running for fifteen hundred miles\r\nover mountains and plains, contains one hundred and fifty millions of\r\ncubic yards of materials and is the greatest of artificial works. No\r\nmodern building compares in grandeur with St. Peter’s, and the mediæval\r\ncathedrals shame our puny imitations.\r\n\r\nThese mighty works were built to show the piety of the Church or to\r\ngratify the pride of kings. Time and money were of no account. All\r\nthis has now been changed. Capital controls, and the question of time,\r\nmoney, and usefulness rules everything. Hence come scientific design\r\nand labor-saving machinery.\r\n\r\nThe engineer of our modern works first calculates the stresses on\r\nall their parts, and proportions them accordingly, so that there is\r\nno waste of material. Hand labor has given place to steam machinery.\r\nAll parts are interchangeable, so that they can be made and fitted\r\ntogether in the least possible time, as is seen every day in the\r\nconstruction of a steel-framed office building. Our workmen receive\r\nmuch higher wages than in the past, while time and cost have been\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe greatest engineering work of the nineteenth century was the\r\ndevelopment of the railway system which has changed the face of the\r\nworld. Beginning in 1829 with the locomotive of George Stephenson, it\r\nhas extended with such strides that, after seventy years, there are\r\n466,000 miles of railways in the world, of which 190,000 miles are in\r\nthe United States. Their cost is estimated at forty thousand millions\r\nof dollars, of which ten thousand millions belong to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which railways are built in the United States and\r\nCanada contrasts strongly with what has been done in other countries.\r\nMuch has been written of the energy of Russia in building 3000 miles of\r\nSiberian railway in five or six years. In the United States an average\r\nof 6147 miles was completed every year during ten successive years,\r\nand in 1887 there were built 12,982 miles. The physical difficulties\r\novercome in Siberia are no greater than have been overcome here.\r\n\r\nThis rapid construction is due to several causes, the most potent of\r\nwhich has been the need of extending railways over great distances\r\nwith little money. Hence they were built economically, and at first\r\nin not as solid a manner as those of Europe. Steeper gradients,\r\nsharper curves, and lighter rails were used. This rendered necessary\r\na different kind of rolling-stock suitable to such construction. The\r\nswivelling-truck and equalizing-beam enabled our engines to run safely\r\non tracks where the rigid European engines would soon have been in the\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nOur cars were made longer, and by the use of longitudinal framing much\r\nstronger. A great economy came from the use of annealed cast-iron\r\nwheels, with hardened tires, all in one piece, instead of being\r\nbuilt up of spokes, hubs, and tires in separate parts. These wheels\r\nnow seldom break, and cost much less than European wheels. As there\r\nare some eleven million car-wheels in use in the United States the\r\nresulting economy is great.\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen that longer cars would carry a greater proportion of\r\npaying load, and the more cars that one engine could draw in a train,\r\nthe less would be the cost. It was not until the invention by Bessemer\r\nin 1864 of a steel of quality and cost that made it available for rails\r\nthat much heavier cars and locomotives could be used. Then came a rapid\r\nincrease. As soon as Bessemer rails were made in this country, the cost\r\nfell from $175 per ton to $50, and now to $26.\r\n\r\nBefore that time a wooden car weighed sixteen tons, and could carry a\r\npaying load of fifteen tons. The thirty-ton engines of those days could\r\nnot draw on a level over thirty cars weighing 900 tons.\r\n\r\nThe pressed steel car of to-day weighs no more than the wooden car,\r\nbut carries a paying load of fifty tons. The heaviest engines have now\r\ndrawn on a level fifty steel cars, weighing 3750 tons. In the one case\r\nthe paying load of an engine was 450 tons; now it is 2500 tons.\r\n\r\nSteep grades soon developed a better brake system, and these heavier\r\ntrains have led to the invention of the automatic brake worked from\r\nthe engine, and also automatic couplers, saving time and many lives.\r\nThe capacity of our railways has been greatly increased by the use of\r\nelectric block-signals.\r\n\r\nThe perfecting of both the railway and its rolling-stock has led to\r\nremarkable results.\r\n\r\nWe have no accurate statistics of the early operation of American\r\nrailways. In 1867 Poor’s Manual estimated their total freight tonnage\r\nat 75,000,000 and the total freight receipts at $400,000,000. This was\r\nan average rate per ton of $5.33.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Poor gives the total freight tonnage at 975,789,941 tons, and\r\nthe freight receipts at $922,436,314, or an average rate per ton of\r\nninety-five cents. Had the rates of 1867 prevailed, the additional\r\nyearly cost to the public would have been $4,275,000,000, or sufficient\r\nto replace the whole railway system in two and a half years.\r\n\r\nThis is an illustration only, but a very striking one. Everybody knows\r\nthat such high rates of freight as those of 1867 would have checked\r\ntraffic. This much can surely be said: the reduction in cost of\r\noperating our railways, and the consequent fall in freight rates, have\r\nbeen potent factors in enabling the United States to send abroad last\r\nyear $1,456,000,000 worth of exports and flood the world with our food\r\nand manufactured products.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE BUILDING\r\n\r\nIn early days the building of a bridge was a matter of great\r\nceremony, and it was consecrated to protect it from evil spirits. Its\r\nconstruction was controlled by priests, as the title of the Pope of\r\nRome, “Pontifex Maximus,” indicates.\r\n\r\nRailways changed all this. Instead of the picturesque stone bridge,\r\nwhose long line of low arches harmonized with the landscape, there came\r\nthe straight girder or high truss, ugly indeed, but quickly built, and\r\ncosting much less.\r\n\r\nBridge construction has made greater progress in the United States than\r\nabroad. The heavy trains that we have described called for stronger\r\nbridges. The large American rolling-stock is not used in England, and\r\nbut little on the continent of Europe, as the width of tunnels and\r\nother obstacles will not allow of it. It is said that there is an\r\naverage of one bridge for every three miles of railway in the United\r\nStates, making 63,000 bridges, most of which have been replaced by new\r\nand stronger ones during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThis demand has brought into existence many bridge-building companies,\r\nsome of whom make the whole bridge, from the ore to the finished\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of railways, highway bridges in America were made\r\nof wood, and called trusses. Few of them existed before railways.\r\nThe large rivers and estuaries were crossed in horse-boats, a trip\r\nmore dangerous than an Atlantic voyage now is. A few smaller rivers\r\nhad wooden truss bridges. Although originally invented by Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, in the sixteenth century, they were reinvented by American\r\ncarpenters. Some of Burr’s bridges are still standing after more\r\nthan one hundred years’ use. This shows what wood can do when not\r\noverstrained and protected from weather and fire.\r\n\r\nThe coming of railways required a stronger type of bridge to carry\r\nconcentrated loads, and the Howe truss, with vertical iron rods, was\r\ninvented, capable of 150-foot spans.\r\n\r\nAbout 1868 iron bridges began to take the place of wooden bridges.\r\nDie-forged eyebars and pin connections allowed of longer panels and\r\nlonger spans. One of the first long-span bridges was a single-track\r\nrailway bridge of 400-foot span over the Ohio at Cincinnati, which was\r\nconsidered to be a great achievement in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe Kinzua viaduct, 310 feet high and over half a mile long, belongs to\r\nthis era. It is the type of the numerous high viaducts now so common.\r\n\r\nAbout 1885 a new material was given to engineers, having greater\r\nstrength and tenacity than iron, and commercially available from its\r\nlow cost. This is basic steel. After many experiments, the proper\r\nproportions of carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, and manganese were\r\nascertained, and uniformity resulted. The open-hearth process is now\r\ngenerally used. This new chemical metal, for such it is, is fifty per\r\ncent. stronger than iron, and can be tied in a knot when cold.\r\n\r\nThe effect of improved devices and the use of steel is shown by the\r\nweights of the 400-foot Ohio River iron bridge, built in 1870, and a\r\nbridge at the same place, built in 1886.\r\n\r\nThe bridge of 1870 was of iron, had panels twelve feet long, and its\r\nheight was forty-five feet, and span 400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe bridge of 1886 was of steel, had panels thirty feet long, and its\r\nheight was eighty feet. Its span was 550 feet. The weights of the two\r\nwere nearly alike.\r\n\r\nThe cantilever design, which is a revival of a very ancient type,\r\ncame into use. The great Forth Bridge, in Scotland, 1600-foot span,\r\nis of this style, as are the 500-foot spans at Poughkeepsie, and now\r\na new one is being designed to cross the St. Lawrence near Quebec, of\r\n1800-foot span.\r\n\r\nThis is probably near the economic limit of cantilever construction,\r\nbut the suspension bridge can be extended much farther, as it carries\r\nno dead weight of compression members.\r\n\r\nThe Niagara Suspension Bridge, of 810-foot span, built by Roebling, in\r\n1852, and the Brooklyn Bridge, of 1600 feet, built by Roebling and his\r\nson, twenty years after, marked a wonderful advance in bridge design.\r\n\r\nThirty years later, when a new bridge of 1600 feet was wanted to\r\ncross another part of the East River at New York, the same lines of\r\nconstruction were followed, and they will be followed in the 2700-foot\r\nspan, designed to cross the North River some time in the present\r\ncentury. The only radical advance is the use of a better steel than\r\ncould be had in earlier days.\r\n\r\nSteel-arched bridges are now scientifically designed. Such are the new\r\nNiagara Bridge, of 840-foot span, and the Alexandra Bridge at Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see how little is said about these beautiful bridges,\r\nwhich the public takes as a matter of course. If they had been built\r\nfifty years ago, their engineers would have received the same praise\r\nas Robert Stephenson or Roebling, and justly so, as they would have\r\nbeen men of exceptional genius. When these bridges were built, in 1898,\r\nthe path had been made so clear by mathematical investigation and the\r\ncommand of a better steel, that the task seemed easy.\r\n\r\nThat which marks more clearly than anything else the great advance\r\nin American bridge building, during the last forty years, is the\r\nreconstruction of the famous Victoria Bridge, over the St. Lawrence,\r\nabove Montreal. This bridge was designed by Robert Stephenson, and the\r\nstone piers are a monument to his engineering skill. For forty winters\r\nthey have resisted the great fields of ice borne by a rapid current.\r\nTheir dimensions were so liberal that the new bridge was put upon them,\r\nalthough four times as wide as the old one.\r\n\r\nThe superstructure was originally made of plate-iron tubes, reinforced\r\nby tees and angles, similar to Stephenson’s Menai Straits Bridge. There\r\nare twenty-two spans of 240 feet each, and a central one of 330 feet.\r\nPerhaps these tubes were the best that could be had at the time, but\r\nthey had outlived their usefulness. Their interiors had become greatly\r\ncorroded by the confined gases from the engines and the drippings from\r\nthe chemicals used in cold-storage cars. Their height was insufficient\r\nfor modern large cars, and the confined smoke made them so dark that\r\nthe number of trains was greatly limited.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to build a new bridge of open-work construction and of\r\nopen-hearth steel. This was done, and the comparison is as follows:\r\nOld bridge, sixteen feet wide, single track, live load of one ton per\r\nfoot; new bridge, sixty-seven feet wide, two railway tracks and two\r\ncarriage-ways, live load five tons per foot.\r\n\r\nThe old iron tubes weighed 10,000 tons, cost $2,713,000, and took two\r\nseasons to erect. The new truss bridge weighs 22,000 tons, has cost\r\nbetween $1,300,000 and $1,400,000, and the time of construction was one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDuring his experience the writer has seen the rolling-load of bridges\r\nincrease from 2000 to 4000 pounds per lineal foot of track, with an\r\nextra allowance for concentrated loads.\r\n\r\nThe modern high office building is an interesting example of the\r\nevolution of a high-viaduct pier. Such a pier of the required\r\ndimensions, strengthened by more columns strong enough to carry many\r\nfloors, is the skeleton frame. Enclose the sides with brick, stone, or\r\nterra-cotta, add windows, and doors, and elevators, and it is complete.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the stability of these high buildings, the effect of\r\nwind pressures had been studied in this country in the designs of the\r\nKinzua, Pecos, and other high viaducts.\r\n\r\nAll this had been thoroughly worked out and known to our engineers\r\nbefore the fall of the Tay Bridge in Scotland. That disastrous event\r\nled to very careful experiments on wind pressures by Sir Benjamin\r\nBaker, the very eminent engineer of the Forth Bridge. His experiments\r\nshowed that a wind gauge of 300 square feet area showed a maximum\r\npressure of thirty-five pounds per square foot, while a small one of\r\none foot and a half square area registered gusts of forty-one pounds\r\nper square foot.\r\n\r\nThe modern elevated railway of cities is simply a very long railway\r\nviaduct. Some idea may be gained of the life of a modern riveted-iron\r\nstructure from the experience of the Manhattan Elevated Railway of New\r\nYork. These roads were built in 1878–79 to carry uniform loads of 1600\r\npounds per lineal foot, except Second Avenue, which was made to carry\r\n2000. The stresses were below 10,000 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nThese viaducts have carried in twenty-two years over 25,000,000 trains,\r\nweighing over 3,000,000,000 tons, at a maximum speed of twenty-five\r\nmiles an hour, and are still in good order.\r\n\r\nBridge engineers of the present day are free from the difficulties\r\nwhich confronted the early designers of iron bridges. The mathematics\r\nof bridge design was understood in 1870, but the proportioning of\r\ndetails had to be worked out individually. Every new span was a new\r\nproblem. Now the engineer tells his draughtsman to design a span of a\r\ngiven length, height, and width, and to carry such a load. By the light\r\nof experience he does this at once.\r\n\r\nConnections have become standardized so that the duplication of parts\r\ncan be carried to its fullest extent.\r\n\r\nMachine tools are used to make every part of a bridge, and power\r\nriveters to fasten them together. Great accuracy can now be had, and\r\nthe sizes of parts have increased in a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nWe have now great bridge companies, which are so completely equipped\r\nwith appliances for both shop drawings and construction that the old\r\njoke becomes almost true that they can make bridges and sell them by\r\nthe mile.\r\n\r\nAll improvements of design are now public property. All that the bridge\r\ncompanies do is done in the fierce light of competition. Mistakes mean\r\nruin, and the fittest only survives.\r\n\r\nHaving such powerful aids, the American bridge engineer of to-day has\r\nadvantages over his predecessors and over his European brethren, where\r\nthe American system has not yet been adopted.\r\n\r\nThe American system gives the greatest possible rapidity of erection of\r\nthe bridge on its piers. A span of 518 feet, weighing 1000 tons, was\r\nerected at Cairo on the Mississippi in six days. The parts were not\r\nassembled until they were put upon the false works. European engineers\r\nhave sometimes ordered a bridge to be riveted together complete in the\r\nmaker’s yard, and then taken apart.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of American work in such bridges as the Atbara in South\r\nAfrica, the Gokteik viaduct in Burmah, 320 feet high, and others, was\r\ndue to low cost, quick delivery and erection, as well as excellence of\r\nmaterial and construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nBridges must have foundations for their piers. Up to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century engineers knew no better way of making them than\r\nby laying bare the bed of the river by a pumped-out cofferdam, or by\r\ndriving piles into the sand, as Julius Cæsar did. About the middle of\r\nthe century, M. Triger, a French engineer, conceived the first plan of\r\na pneumatic foundation, which led to the present system of compressing\r\nair by pumping it into an inverted box, called a caisson, with air\r\nlocks on top to enable men and materials to go in and out. After the\r\nsoft materials were removed, and the caisson sunk by its own weight to\r\nthe proper depth, it was filled with concrete. The limit of depth is\r\nthat in which men can work in compressed air without injury, and this\r\nis not much over one hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the Brooklyn and St. Louis bridges were put down in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the Poughkeepsie bridge over the Hudson in\r\n1887–88, it became necessary to go down 135 feet below tide-level\r\nbefore hard bottom was reached. Another process was invented to take\r\nthe place of compressed air. Timber caissons were built, having double\r\nsides, and the spaces between them filled with stone to give weight.\r\nTheir tops were left open and the American single-bucket dredge was\r\nused. This bucket was lowered and lifted by a very long wire rope\r\nworked by the engine, and with it the soft material was removed. By\r\nmoving this bucket to different parts of the caisson its sinking was\r\nperfectly controlled, and the caisson finally placed in its exact\r\nposition, and perfectly vertical. The internal space was then filled\r\nwith concrete laid under water by the same bucket, and levelled by\r\ndivers when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile this work was going on, the government of New South Wales, in\r\nAustralia, called for both designs and tenders for a bridge over an\r\nestuary of the sea called Hawkesbury. The conditions were the same as\r\nat Poughkeepsie, except that the soft mud reached to a depth of 160\r\nfeet below tide-level.\r\n\r\nThe designs of the engineers of the Poughkeepsie bridge were accepted,\r\nand the same method of sinking open caissons (in this case made of\r\niron) was carried out with perfect success.\r\n\r\nThe erection of this bridge involved another difficult problem. The mud\r\nwas too soft and deep for piles and staging, and the cantilever system\r\nin this site would have increased the cost.\r\n\r\nA staging was built on a large pontoon at the shore, and the span\r\nerected upon it. The whole was then towed out to the bridge site at\r\nhigh tide. As the tide fell, the pontoon was lowered and the steel\r\ngirder was placed gently on its piers. The whole operation was\r\ncompleted within six hours. The other five spans were placed in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nThe same system was followed afterwards by the engineer of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway in placing the spans of a bridge over the St. Lawrence,\r\nin a very rapid current. It is now used in replacing old spans by new\r\nones, as it interrupts traffic for the least possible time.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problems presented at Hawkesbury gave the second\r\nintroduction of American engineers to bridge building outside of\r\nAmerica. The first was in 1786, when an American carpenter or\r\nshipwright built a bridge over Charles River at Boston, 1470 feet long\r\nby forty-six feet wide. This bridge was of wood supported on piles. His\r\nwork gained for him such renown that he was called to Ireland and built\r\na similar bridge at Belfast.\r\n\r\nTunnelling by compressed air is a horizontal application of\r\ncompressed-air foundations. The earth is supported by an iron tube,\r\nwhich is added to in rings, which are pushed forward by hydraulic jacks.\r\n\r\nA tunnel is now being made under an arm of the sea between Boston and\r\nEast Boston, some 1400 feet long and sixty-five feet below tide. The\r\ninterior lining of iron tubing is not used. The tunnel is built of\r\nconcrete, reinforced by steel rods. This will effect a considerable\r\neconomy. Success in modern engineering means doing a thing in the most\r\neconomical way consistent with safety.\r\n\r\nThe Saint Clair tunnel, which carries the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada\r\nunder the outlet of Lake Huron, is a successful example of such work.\r\nHad the North River tunnel, at New York, been designed on equally\r\nscientific principles, it would probably have been finished, which now\r\nseems problematical.\r\n\r\nThe construction of rapid-transit railways in cities is another branch\r\nof engineering, covering structural, mechanical, and electrical\r\nengineering. Some of these railways are elevated, and are merely\r\nrailway viaducts, but the favorite type now is that of subways. There\r\nare two kinds, those near the surface, like the District railways of\r\nLondon, the subways in Paris, Berlin, and Boston, and that now building\r\nin New York. The South London and Central London, and other London\r\nprojects, are tubes sunk fifty to eighty feet below the surface and\r\nrequiring elevators for access. These are made on a plan devised by\r\nGreathead, and consist of cast-iron tubes pushed forward by hydraulic\r\nrams, and having the space outside of the tube filled with liquid\r\ncement pumped into place.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Boston subway was difficult on account of the\r\nsmall width of the streets, their great traffic, and the necessity of\r\nunderpinning the foundations of buildings. All of this was successfully\r\ndone without disturbing the traffic for a single day, and reflects\r\ngreat credit on the engineer. Owing to the great width of New York\r\nstreets, the problem is simpler in that respect, but requires skill in\r\ndesign and organization to complete the work in a short time. Although\r\nmany times as long as the Boston subway, it will be built in nearly the\r\nsame time. The design, where in earth, may be compared to that of a\r\nsteel office building twenty miles long, laid flat on one of its sides.\r\nThe reduplication of parts saves time and labor, and is the key to the\r\nanticipated rapid progress. Near the surface this subway is built in\r\nopen excavation, and tunnelling is confined to rock.\r\n\r\nThe construction of power-houses for developing energy from coal and\r\nfrom falling water requires much structural besides electrical and\r\nmechanical engineering ability. The Niagara power-house is intended to\r\ndevelop 100,000 horse-power; that at the Sault Ste. Marie as much; that\r\non the St. Lawrence, at Massena, 70,000 horse-power. These are huge\r\nworks, requiring tunnels, rock-cut chambers, and masonry and concrete\r\nin walls and dams. They cover large extents of territory.\r\n\r\nThe contrast in size of the coal-using power-houses is interesting.\r\nThe new power-house now building by the Manhattan Elevated Railway,\r\nin New York, develops in the small space of 200 by 400 feet 100,000\r\nhorse-power, or as much power as that utilized at Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful materials which modern engineers now make use\r\nof is concrete, which can be put into confined spaces and laid under\r\nwater. It costs less than masonry, while as strong. This is the revival\r\nof the use of a material used by the Romans. The writer was once\r\nallowed to climb a ladder and look at the construction of a dome of the\r\nPantheon, at Rome. He found it a monolithic mass of concrete, and hence\r\nwithout thrust. It is a better piece of engineering construction than\r\nthe dome of St. Peter’s, built fifteen hundred years later. The dome of\r\nColumbia College Library, in New York, is built of concrete.\r\n\r\nConcrete is a mixture of broken stone or gravel, sand, and Portland\r\ncement. Its virtue depends upon the uniform good quality of the cement.\r\nThe use of the rotary kiln, which exposes all the contained material to\r\na uniform and constant intense heat, has revolutionized the manufacture\r\nof Portland cement. The engineer can now depend upon its uniformity of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWheels, axles, bridges, and rails have all been strengthened to carry\r\ntheir increased loads; but, strange to say, the splices which hold in\r\nplace the ends of the rails, and which are really short-span bridges,\r\nare now the weakest part of a railway. The angle-bar splice has but\r\none-third of the strength of the rail, and its strength cannot be\r\nincreased, owing to its want of depth. Joints go down under every\r\npassing wheel, and the ends of the rails wear out long before the rest.\r\n\r\nThis is not an insignificant detail. It has been estimated by the\r\nofficers of one of the trunk lines that a splice of proper design\r\nand strength would save yearly enough in track labor (most of which\r\nis expended in tamping up low joints) to buy all the new rails and\r\nfastenings required in some time. It would save much more than that\r\nin the wear of rolling-stock. A perfect joint would be an economic\r\ndevice next in value to the Bessemer steel rail. Here is a place for\r\nscientific and practical skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nThis is one of the oldest branches of engineering, and was developed\r\nbefore the last century. The irrigation works of Asia, Africa, Spain,\r\nItaly, the Roman aqueducts, and the canals of Europe, are examples.\r\nHydraulic works cannot be constructed in ignorance of the laws which\r\ngovern the flow of water. The action of water is relentless, as ruined\r\ncanals, obstructed rivers, and washed-out dams testify.\r\n\r\nThe principal additions of the nineteenth century to hydraulic\r\nengineering are the collection of larger statistics of the flow of\r\nwater in pipes and channels, of rainfall, run-off, and available\r\nsupply. It is now known that the germs of disease can be retained by\r\nordinary sand filters, and it is now an established fact that pure\r\ndrinking water and proper drainage are a sure preventive of typhoid and\r\nsimilar fevers. Very foul water can be made potable. Experiments show\r\nthat the water of the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia, which contains\r\n400,000 germs in the space of less than a cubic inch, was so much\r\npurified by filtering that only sixty remained. This is a discovery\r\nof sanitary science, but the application of it is through structural\r\nengineering, which designs and executes the filter beds with great\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe removal of sewage, after having been done by the Etruscans\r\nbefore the foundation of Rome, became a lost art during the dirty\r\nDark Ages, when filth and piety were deemed to be connected in some\r\nmysterious way. It was reserved for good John Wesley to point out that\r\n“Cleanliness is next to godliness.” Now sewage works are as common as\r\nthose for water supply. Some of them have been of great size and cost.\r\nSuch are the drainage works of London, Paris, Berlin, Boston, Chicago,\r\nand New Orleans. A very difficult work was the drainage of the City of\r\nMexico, which is in a valley surrounded by mountains, and elevated only\r\nfour to five feet above a lake having no outlet. Attempts to drain the\r\nlake had been made in vain for six hundred years. It has lately been\r\naccomplished by a tunnel six miles long through the mountains, and a\r\ncanal of over thirty miles, the whole work costing some $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of Chicago by locks and canal into the Illinois River has\r\ncost some $35,000,000, and is well worth its cost.\r\n\r\nScientific research has been applied to the designing of high masonry\r\nand concrete dams, and we know now that no well-designed dam on a good\r\nfoundation should fail. The dams now building across the Nile by order\r\nof the British government will create the largest artificial lakes\r\nin the world. The water thus stored will be of inestimable value in\r\nirrigating the crops of Lower Egypt. Their cost, although great, will\r\nnot exceed the sums spent by the lavish Khedive Ismail on useless\r\npalaces, now falling to decay.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal is one of the largest hydraulic works of the last\r\ncentury, and is a notable instance of the displacement of hand labor\r\nby the use of machinery. Ismail began by impressing a large part of\r\nthe peasant population of Egypt, just as Rameses had done over 3000\r\nyears before. These unfortunate people were set to dig the sand with\r\nrude hoes, and carry it away in baskets on their heads. They died\r\nby thousands for want of water and proper food. At last the French\r\nengineers persuaded the Khedive to let them introduce steam dredging\r\nmachinery. A light railway was laid to supply provisions, and a small\r\nditch dug to bring pure water. The number of men employed fell to\r\none-fourth. Machinery did the rest. But for this the canal would never\r\nhave been finished.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal now uses the best modern machinery, and the Nicaragua\r\nCanal, if built, will apply still better methods, developed on the\r\nChicago drainage canal, where material was handled at a less cost than\r\nhas ever been done before.\r\n\r\nRussia is better supplied with internal waterways than any other\r\ncountry. Her rivers rise near each other, and have long been connected\r\nby canals. It is stated that she has over 60,000 miles of internal\r\nnavigation, and is now preparing the construction of canals to connect\r\nthe Caspian with the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal was one of very small cost, but its influence has been\r\nsurpassed by none. The “winning of the West” was hastened many years\r\nby the construction of this work in the first quarter of the century.\r\nTwo horses were just able to draw a ton of goods at the speed of two\r\nmiles an hour over the wretched roads of those days. When the canal\r\nwas made these two horses could draw a boat carrying 150 tons four\r\nmiles an hour. Mud, or, in other words, friction, is the great enemy\r\nof civilization, and canals were the first things to diminish it, and\r\nafter that railways.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal was made by engineers, but it had to make its own\r\nengineers first, as there were none available in this country at that\r\ntime. These self-taught men, some of them land surveyors and others\r\nlawyers, showed themselves the equals of the Englishmen Brindley and\r\nSmeaton, when they located a water route through the wilderness, having\r\na uniform descent from Lake Erie to the Hudson, and which would have\r\nbeen so built if there had been enough money.\r\n\r\nThe question now is whether to enlarge the capacity of this canal by\r\nenlarging its prism and locks, or to increase speed and move more boats\r\nin a season by electrical appliances. The last method seems more in\r\nline with those of the present day.\r\n\r\nThere should be a waterway from the Hudson to Lake Erie large enough\r\nfor vessels able to navigate the lakes and the ocean. A draft of\r\ntwenty-one feet can be had at a cost estimated at $200,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe deepening of the Chicago drainage canal to the Mississippi River,\r\nand the deepening of the Mississippi itself to the Gulf of Mexico, is a\r\nlogical sequence of the first project. The Nicaragua Canal would then\r\nform one part of a great line of navigation, by which the products\r\nof the interior of the continent could reach either the Atlantic or\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe cost would be small compared with the resulting benefits, and some\r\nday this navigation will be built by the government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe deepening of the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River from six\r\nto thirty feet by James B. Eads was a great engineering achievement. It\r\nwas the first application of the jetty system on a large scale. This is\r\nmerely confining the flow of a river, and thus increasing its velocity\r\nso that it secures a deeper channel for itself.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of harbors follows closely the increased size of ocean\r\nand lake vessels. The approach to New York harbor is now being deepened\r\nto forty feet, a thing impossible to be done without the largest\r\napplication of steam machinery in a suction dredge boat.\r\n\r\nThe great increase of urban population, due to steam and electric\r\nrailways, has made works of water supply and drainage necessary\r\neverywhere. Some of these are on a very grand scale. An illustration of\r\nthis is the Croton Aqueduct of New York as it now is, and as it will be\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThis work was thought by its designers to be on a scale large enough\r\nto last for all time. It is now less than sixty years old, and the\r\npopulation of New York will soon be too large to be supplied by it.\r\n\r\nIt is able to supply 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 gallons daily, and its\r\ncost, when the Cornell dam and Jerome Park reservoir are finished, will\r\nbe a little over $92,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is now suggested to store water in the Adirondack Mountains, 203\r\nmiles away, by dams built at the outlet of ten or twelve lakes.\r\nThis will equalize the flow of the Hudson River so as to give\r\n3,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,000 gallons daily. It is then proposed to\r\npump 1,000,000,000 gallons daily from the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie,\r\nsixty miles away, to a height sufficient to supply the city by gravity\r\nthrough an aqueduct. This water would be filtered at Poughkeepsie, and\r\nwe now know that all impurities can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf this scheme is carried out, the total supply will be about\r\n1,300,000,000 gallons daily, or enough for a population of from\r\n12,000,000 to 13,000,000 persons. By putting in more pumps,\r\nfilter-beds, and conduits, this supply can be increased forty per\r\ncent., or to 1,800,000,000 gallons daily. This water would fill every\r\nday a lake one mile square by ten feet deep. This is a fair example\r\nof the scale of the engineering works of the nineteenth and twentieth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nBy the application of modern labor-saving machinery, the cost of this\r\nwork can be so far controlled that the cost to the city of New York per\r\n1,000,000 gallons would be no greater than that of the present Croton\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nAll works of hydraulic engineers depend on water. But what will happen\r\nif the water all dries up? India, China, Spain, Turkey, and Syria have\r\nsuffered from droughts, caused clearly by the destruction of their\r\nforests. The demand for paper to print books and newspapers upon, and\r\nfor other purposes, is fast converting our forests into pulp. We cannot\r\neven say, “After us the deluge,” for it will seldom rain in those evil\r\ndays. When the rains do come, the sponge-like vegetation of the forests\r\nbeing gone, the streams will be torrents at one time of the year and\r\ndried up during the rest, as we now see in the arid regions of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nThis is employed in all dynamical engineering. It covers the designs\r\nof prime motors of all sorts, steam, gas, and gasoline reciprocating\r\nengines; also steam and water turbines, wind-mills, and wave-motors.\r\n\r\nIt comprises all means of transmitting power, as by shafting, ropes,\r\npneumatic pressure, and compressed air, all of which seem likely to be\r\nsuperseded by electricity.\r\n\r\nIt covers the construction of machine tools and machinery of all kinds.\r\nIt enters into all the processes of structural, hydraulic, electrical,\r\nand industrial engineering. The special improvements are: The almost\r\nuniversal use of rotary motion, and of the reduplication of parts.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine is a machine of reciprocating, converted into rotary,\r\nmotion by the crank. The progress of mechanical engineering during the\r\nnineteenth century is measured by the improvements of the steam-engine,\r\nprincipally in the direction of saving fuel, by the invention of\r\ninternal combustion or gas-engines, the application of electrical\r\ntransmission, and, latest, the practical development of steam turbines\r\nby Parsons, Westinghouse, Delaval, Curtis, and others. In these a jet\r\nof steam impinges upon buckets set upon the circumference of a wheel.\r\nIt was clearly indicated by the Italian engineer Bronca, in 1629,\r\nbut he was too early. The time was not ripe, and there were then no\r\nmachine tools giving the perfection of workmanship required.\r\n\r\nTheir advantages are that their motion is rotary and not reciprocal.\r\nThey can develop speed of from 5000 to 30,000 revolutions per minute,\r\nwhile the highest ever attained by a reciprocating engine is not over\r\n1000. Their thermodynamic losses are less, hence they consume less\r\nsteam and less fuel.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting fact that the basic invention upon which not\r\nonly steam turbines and electric dynamos, but, indeed, all other parts\r\nof mechanical engineering, depend, is of such remote antiquity that we\r\nknow nothing of its origin. This is the wheel which Gladstone said was\r\nthe greatest of man’s mechanical inventions, as there is nothing in\r\nnature to suggest it.\r\n\r\nDuplication of parts has lowered the cost of all products. Clothing is\r\none of these. The parts of ready-made garments and shoes are now cut\r\ninto shape in numbers at a time, by sharp-edged templates, and then\r\nfastened together by sewing-machines.\r\n\r\nMechanical engineering is a good example of the survival of the\r\nfittest. Millions of dollars are expended on machinery, when suddenly\r\na new discovery or invention casts them all into the scrap heap, to be\r\nreplaced by those of greater earning capacity.\r\n\r\nPrime motors derive their energy either from coal or other combinations\r\nof carbon, such as petroleum, or from gravity. This may come from\r\nfalling water, and the old-fashioned water-wheels of the eighteenth\r\ncentury were superseded in the nineteenth by turbines, first invented\r\nin France and since greatly perfected. These are used in the electrical\r\ntransmission of water-power at Niagara of 5000 horse-power, and form a\r\nvery important part of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe other gravity motors are wind-mills and wave-motors. Wind-mills are\r\nan old invention, but have been greatly improved in the United States\r\nby the use of the self-reefing wheel. The great plains of the West are\r\nsubject to sudden, violent gales of wind, and unless the wheel was\r\nautomatically self-reefing it would often be destroyed. Little has been\r\nwritten about these wheels, but their use is very widely extended, and\r\nthey perform a most useful function in industrial engineering.\r\n\r\nThere have been vast numbers of patents taken out for wave-motors. One\r\nwas invented in Chili, South America, which furnished a constant power\r\nfor four months, and was utilized in sawing planks. The action of waves\r\nis more constant on the Pacific coast of America than elsewhere, and\r\nsome auxiliary power, such as a gasoline engine, which can be quickly\r\nstarted and stopped, must be provided for use during calm days. The\r\nprime cost of such a machine need not exceed that of a steam plant,\r\nand the cost of operating is much less than that of any fuel-burning\r\nengine. The saving of coal is a very important problem. In a wider\r\nsense, we may say that the saving of all the great stores which nature\r\nhas laid up for us during the past, and which have remained almost\r\nuntouched until the nineteenth century, is _the_ great problem of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nPetroleum and natural gas may disappear. The ores of gold, silver, and\r\nplatinum will not last forever. Trees will grow, and iron ores seem\r\nto be practically inexhaustible. Chemistry has added a new metal in\r\naluminum, which replaces copper for many purposes. One of the greatest\r\nproblems of the twentieth century is to discover some chemical process\r\nfor treating iron, by which oxidation will not take place.\r\n\r\nCoal, next to grain, is the most important of nature’s gifts; it can\r\nbe exhausted, or the cost of mining it become so great that it cannot\r\nbe obtained in the countries where it is most needed; water, wind, and\r\nwave power may take its place to a limited extent, and greater use may\r\nbe made of the waste gases coming from blast or smelter furnaces, but\r\nas nearly all energy comes from coal, its use must be economized, and\r\nthe greatest economy will come from pulverizing coal and using it in\r\nthe shape of a fine powder. Inventions have been made trying to deliver\r\nthis powder into the fire-box as fast as made, for it is as explosive\r\nas gunpowder, and as dangerous to store or handle. If this can be done,\r\nthere will be a saving of coal due to perfect and smokeless combustion,\r\nas the admission of air can be entirely regulated, the same blast\r\nwhich throws in the powder furnishing oxygen. Some investigators have\r\nestimated that the saving of coal will be as great as twenty per cent.\r\nThis means 100,000,000 tons of coal annually.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal will then be as smokeless as anthracite, and can\r\nbe burned in locomotives. Cities will be free from the nuisance of\r\nwasted coal, which we call soot. This process will be the best kind\r\nof mechanical stoking, and will prevent the necessity of opening the\r\ndoors of fire-boxes. The boiler-rooms of steamships will no longer be\r\n“floating hells,” and the firing of large locomotives will become easy.\r\n\r\nAnother problem of mechanical engineering is to determine whether it\r\nwill be found more economical to transform the energy of coal, at the\r\nmines, into electric current and send it by wire to cities and other\r\nplaces where it is wanted, or to carry the coal by rail and water, as\r\nwe now do, to such places, and convert it there by the steam or gas\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nIn favor of the first method it can be said that hills of refuse coal\r\nnow representing locked-up capital can be burned, and the cost of\r\ntransportation and handling be saved. Electric energy can now transport\r\npower in high voltage economically between coal-mines and most large\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nThe second method has the advantage of not depending on one single\r\nsource of supply, that may break down, but in having the energy stored\r\nin coal-pockets near by the place of use, where it can be applied to\r\nseparate units of power with no fear of failure.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that a combination of the two systems will produce\r\nthe best results. Where power can be sent electrically from the mines\r\nfor less cost than the coal can be transported, that method will be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nTo prevent stoppage of works, the separate motors and a store of coal,\r\nto be used in cases of emergency, will still be needed, just as has\r\nbeen described as necessary to the commercial success of wave-motors.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nAny attempt by the writer of this article to trace the progress of\r\nelectricity would be but a vain repetition, after the admirable manner\r\nin which the subject has been treated in a former paper of this series\r\nby Professor Elihu Thomson.\r\n\r\nWe can only once more emphasize the fact that it is by the union of\r\nfour separate classes of minds—scientific discoverers, inventors,\r\nengineers, and capitalists—that this vast new industry has been\r\ncreated, which gives direct employment to thousands, and, as Bacon said\r\n300 years ago, has “endowed the human race with new powers.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALLURGY AND MINING\r\n\r\nAll the processes of metallurgy and mining employ statical, hydraulic,\r\nmechanical, and electrical engineering. Coal, without railways and\r\ncanals, would be of little use, unless electrical engineering came to\r\nits aid.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated by the late Lord Armstrong that of the 450,000,000 to\r\n500,000,000 tons of coal annually produced in the world, one-third is\r\nused for steam production, one-third in metallurgical processes, and\r\none-third for domestic consumption. This last item seems large. It is\r\nthe most important manufacturing industry in the world, as may be seen\r\nby comparing the coalless condition of the eighteenth century with the\r\ncoal-using condition of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nNext in importance comes the production of iron and steel. Steel, on\r\naccount of its great cost and brittleness, was only used for tools and\r\nspecial purposes until past the middle of the last century. This has\r\nbeen all changed by the invention of his steel by Bessemer in 1864,\r\nand open-hearth steel in the furnace of Siemens, perfected some twenty\r\nyears since by Gilchrist & Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe United States have taken the lead in steel manufacture. In 1873\r\nGreat Britain made three times as much steel as the United States. Now\r\nthe United States makes twice as much as Great Britain, or forty per\r\ncent. of all the steel made in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie has explained the reason why, in epigrammatic phrase:\r\n“Three pounds of steel billets can be sold for two cents.”\r\n\r\nThis stimulates rail and water traffic and other industries, as he\r\ntells us one pound of steel requires two pounds of ore, one and\r\none-third pounds of coal, and one-third of a pound of limestone.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the States bordering on the lakes\r\nhave created a traffic of 25,000,000 tons yearly through the Sault\r\nSte. Marie Canal, while the Suez, which supplies the wants of half the\r\npopulation of the world, has only 7,000,000, or less than the tonnage\r\nof the little Harlem River at New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nThis leads us to our last topic, for which too little room has been\r\nleft. Industrial engineering covers statical, hydraulic, mechanical,\r\nand electrical engineering, and adds a new branch which we may call\r\nchemical engineering. This is pre-eminently a child of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and is the conversion of one thing into another by a knowledge\r\nof their chemical constituents.\r\n\r\nWhen Dalton first applied mathematics to chemistry and made it\r\nquantitative, he gave the key which led to the discoveries of\r\nCavendish, Gay-Lussac, Berzelius, Liebig, and others. This new\r\nknowledge was not locked up, but at once given to the world, and made\r\nuse of. Its first application on a large scale was made by Napoleon in\r\nencouraging the manufacture of sugar from beets.\r\n\r\nThe new products were generally made from what were called “waste\r\nmaterial.” We now have the manufacture of soda, bleaching powders,\r\naniline dyes, and other products of the distillation of coal, also\r\ncoal-oil from petroleum (known fifty or sixty years ago only as a horse\r\nmedicine), acetylene gas, celluloid, rubber goods in all their numerous\r\nvarieties, high explosives, cement, artificial manures, artificial ice,\r\nbeet-sugar, and even beer may now be included.\r\n\r\nThrough many ages, the alchemists, groping in the dark, and in\r\nignorance of nature’s laws, wasted their time in trying to find what\r\nthey called the philosopher’s stone, which they hoped would transform\r\nthe baser metals into gold.\r\n\r\nIf such a thing could be found it would be a curse, as it would take\r\naway one of the most useful instruments we have—a fixed standard of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn a little over one hundred years, those working by the light of\r\nscience have found the true philosopher’s stone in modern chemistry.\r\nThe value of only a part of these new products exceeds the nominal\r\nvalue of all the gold in the world.\r\n\r\nThe value of our mechanical and chemical products is great, but it is\r\nsurpassed by that of food products. If these did not keep pace with\r\nthe increase of population, the theories of Malthus would be true—but\r\nhe never saw a modern reaper.\r\n\r\nThe steam-plough was invented in England some fifty years since, but\r\nthe great use of agricultural machinery dates from our Civil War, when\r\nso many men were taken from agriculture. It became necessary to fill\r\ntheir places with machinery. Without tracing the steps which have led\r\nto it, we may say that the common type is what is called “the binder,”\r\nand is a machine drawn chiefly by animals, and in some cases by a field\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nIt cuts, rakes, and binds sheaves of grain at one operation. Sometimes\r\nthreshing and winnowing machines are combined with it, and the grain is\r\ndelivered into bags ready for the market.\r\n\r\nDifferent machines are used for cutting and binding corn, and\r\nfor mowing and raking hay, but the most important of all is the\r\ngrain-binder. The extent of their use may be known from the fact that\r\n75,000 tons of twine are used by these machines annually.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are in the United States 1,500,000 of\r\nthese machines, but as the harvest is earlier in the South, there are\r\nprobably not over 1,000,000 in use at one time. As each machine takes\r\nthe place of sixteen men, this means that 16,000,000 men are released\r\nfrom farming for other pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe “man with the hoe” has disappeared from the real world, and is only\r\nto be found in the dreams of poets.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to assume that a large part of these 16,000,000 men have\r\ngone into manufacturing, the operating of railways, and other pursuits.\r\nThe use of agricultural machinery, therefore, is one explanation of why\r\nthe United States produces eight-tenths of the world’s cotton and corn,\r\none-quarter of its wheat, one-third of its meat and iron, two-fifths of\r\nits steel, and one-third of its coal, and a large part of the world’s\r\nmanufactured goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting question, why was this great development\r\nof material prosperity delayed so late? Why did it wait until the\r\nnineteenth century, and then all at once increase with such rapid\r\nstrides?\r\n\r\nIt was not until modern times that the reign of law was greatly\r\nextended, and men were insured the product of their labors.\r\n\r\nThen came the union of scientists, inventors, and engineers.\r\n\r\nSo long as these three classes worked separately but little was done.\r\nThere was an antagonism between them. Ancient writers went so far as\r\nto say that the invention of the arch and of the potter’s wheel were\r\nbeneath the dignity of a philosopher.\r\n\r\nOne of the first great men to take a different view was Francis Bacon.\r\nMacaulay, in his famous essay, quotes him as saying: “Philosophy is the\r\nrelief of man’s estate, and the endowment of the human race with new\r\npowers; increasing their pleasures and mitigating their sufferings.”\r\nThese noble words seem to anticipate the famous definition of civil\r\nengineering, embodied by Telford in the charter of the British\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers: “Engineering is the art of controlling\r\nthe great powers of nature for the use and convenience of man.”\r\n\r\nThe seed sown by Bacon was long in producing fruit. Until the laws of\r\nnature were better known, there could be no practical application of\r\nthem. Towards the end of the eighteenth century a great intellectual\r\nrevival took place. In literature appeared Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant,\r\nHume, and Goethe. In pure science there came Laplace, Cavendish,\r\nLavoisier, Linnæus, Berzelius, Priestley, Count Rumford, James Watt,\r\nand Dr. Franklin. The last three were among the earliest to bring\r\nabout a union of pure and applied science. Franklin immediately applied\r\nhis discovery that frictional electricity and lightning were the same\r\nto the protection of buildings by lightning-rods. Count Rumford (whose\r\nexperiments on the conversion of power into heat led to the discovery\r\nof the conservatism of energy) spent a long life in contriving useful\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\nJames Watt, one of the few men who have united in themselves knowledge\r\nof abstract science, great inventive faculties, and rare mechanical\r\nskill, changed the steam-engine from a worthless rattletrap into\r\nthe most useful machine ever invented by man. To do this he first\r\ndiscovered the science of thermodynamics, then invented the necessary\r\nappliances, and finally constructed them with his own hands. He was a\r\nvery exceptional man. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there\r\nwere few engineers who had received any scientific education. Most of\r\nthem worked by their constructive instincts, like beavers, or from\r\nexperience only. It took a lifetime to educate such an engineer, and\r\nfew became eminent until they were old men.\r\n\r\nNow there is in the profession a great army of young men, most of them\r\ngraduates of technical schools, good mathematicians, and well versed\r\nin the art of experimenting. The experiments of undergraduates on\r\ncements, concrete, the flow of water, the impact of metals, and the\r\nsteam-engine, have added much to the general stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the present causes of progress is that all discoveries are\r\npublished at once in technical journals and in the daily press. The\r\npublication of descriptive indexes of all scientific and engineering\r\narticles as fast as they appear is another modern contrivance.\r\n\r\nFormerly scientific discoveries were concealed by cryptograms, printed\r\nin a dead language, and hidden in the archives of learned societies.\r\nEven so late as 1821 Oersted published his discovery of the uniformity\r\nof electricity and magnetism in Latin.\r\n\r\nEngineering works could have been designed and useful inventions\r\nmade, but they could not have been carried out without combination.\r\nCorporate organization collects the small savings of many into great\r\nsums through savings-banks, life insurance companies, etc., and uses\r\nthis concentrated capital to construct the vast works of our days.\r\nThis could not continue unless fair dividends were paid. Everything\r\nnow has to be designed so as to pay. Time, labor, and material must\r\nbe saved, and he ranks highest who can best do this. Invention has\r\nbeen encouraged by liberal patent laws, which secure to the inventor\r\nproperty in his ideas at a moderate cost.\r\n\r\nCombination, organization, and scientific discovery, inventive ability,\r\nand engineering skill are now united.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that we have gathered together all the inventions of\r\nthe nineteenth century and called them works of engineering. This\r\nis not so. Engineering covers much more than invention. It includes\r\nall works of sufficient size and intricacy to require men trained in\r\nthe knowledge of the physical conditions which govern the mechanical\r\napplication of the laws of nature. First comes scientific discovery,\r\nthen invention, and lastly engineering. Faraday and Henry discovered\r\nthe electrical laws which led to the invention of the dynamo, which\r\nwas perfected by many minds. Engineering built such works as those at\r\nNiagara Falls to make it useful.\r\n\r\nAn ignorant man may invent a safety-pin, but he cannot build the\r\nBrooklyn Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe engineer-in-chief commands an army of experts, as without\r\nspecialization little can be done. His is the comprehensive design, for\r\nwhich he alone is responsible.\r\n\r\nSuch is the evolution of engineering, which began as a craft and has\r\nended as a profession.\r\n\r\nIn past times, civilization depended upon military engineering.\r\nWarriors at first used only the weapons of the hand. Then came military\r\nengineering, applied both to attack and defence, and culminating in the\r\ninvention of gunpowder. The civilization of to-day depends greatly upon\r\ncivil engineering, as we have tried to show. It has changed the face\r\nof the world and brought all men nearer together. It has improved the\r\ncondition of man by sanitary appliances and lowering the cost of food.\r\nIt has shown that through machinery the workman is better educated,\r\nand his wages are increased, while the profits of capital increase\r\nalso. It has made representative government possible over vast areas of\r\nterritory, and is democratizing the world.\r\n\r\nThoughtful persons have asked, will this new civilization last, or will\r\nit go the way of its predecessors? Surely the answer is: all depends\r\non good government, on the stability of law, order, and justice,\r\nprotecting the rights of all classes. It will continue to grow with the\r\ngrowth of good government, prosper with its prosperity, and perish with\r\nits decay.\r\n\r\n            THOMAS C. CLARKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHOLICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no unnatural curiosity that tempts us to recollect ourselves\r\nat the end of a century and consider the gains and losses of three\r\ngenerations, our inheritance from the past, our own administration of\r\nthe same, and the prospects of our descendants. Religion can only gain\r\nfrom such a survey, for she is a world teacher on so large a scale that\r\nall ordinary human methods of comparison and summary are too dwarfed\r\nand insufficient for her. Her message is to all humanity; hence only\r\nthe most universal criteria are rightly applicable to her. It seems\r\nto me that that is especially true of the oldest historical form of\r\nChristianity, which is Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church has had a message for all humanity in every age ever\r\nsince Saint Clement penned his famous epistle to the Corinthians, or\r\nSaint Victor caused the Christian world to meet in special councils for\r\nthe solution of a universal difficulty. It is no mere coincidence that,\r\nat the opening of the last century of this mystical and wonderful cycle\r\nof two thousand years, the Bishop of Rome should again address the\r\nworld in tones whose moderation and sympathy recall the temper and the\r\narguments of Saint Clement, his far-away predecessor and disciple of\r\nSaint Peter.\r\n\r\nThe year 1800 was a very disheartening one for Catholicism. It still\r\nstood erect and hopeful, but in the midst of a political and social\r\nwreckage, the result of a century of scepticism and destructive\r\ncriticism that acted at last as sparks for an ungovernable popular\r\nfrenzy, during which the old order appeared to pass away forever\r\nand a new one was inaugurated with every manifestation of joy. The\r\ntree of political liberty was everywhere planted, and the peoples of\r\nEurope promised themselves a life of unalloyed comfort for all future\r\ntime. Catholicism was the religion of the majority of these people,\r\nand was cunningly obliged to bear the brunt of all their complaints,\r\njustified and unjustifiable; although the authorities of Catholicism\r\nhad long protested against many of the gravest abuses of the period,\r\nsustained in formal defiance of the principles and institutions of the\r\nCatholic religion. The new Cæsar threatened to be more terrible to the\r\nindependence of religion than any ancient one, and the revenues and\r\nestablishments by which Catholicism had kept up its public standing\r\nand earned the esteem and gratitude of the people were swept away or\r\n_quasi_ ruined.\r\n\r\nAll the acquired charges and duties of the past were left to the\r\nCatholic religion; yet the means to carry them on were taken away,\r\nsometimes by open violence, sometimes by insidious measures, but always\r\nby gross injustice. The final incidence of this injustice was on the\r\ncommon people, since the Church was, after all, only the administrator\r\nof very much that she was thus dispossessed of.\r\n\r\nWith this overturning of all the conditions of Catholic life came\r\nnew problems, new trials, and a period of indefinite, uncertain\r\ncircumstances that were finally set at rest only at the Congress of\r\nVienna in 1815, by which an end was put to the political changes that\r\nbegan with the Revolution of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe _modus vivendi_ then reached, and soon consecrated by a series of\r\nconcordats, has remained substantially the basis of the dealings of\r\nCatholicism with the governments of the Old World. Only one formal\r\nand permanent violation of this legal situation has taken place, the\r\nviolent and unjust dispossession of the Holy See by the government of\r\nthe House of Savoy, in flagrant violation of every title that could\r\nbe invoked by a legitimate civil power. Elsewhere Catholicism has\r\nundergone much suffering, both in the states of the Old World and in\r\nthe republics of South America. But, the above vital conflict apart,\r\nthe old century closed with no very acute or intolerable condition of\r\nthings, although there is much that does not reply to our ideas of\r\nfairness and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VATICAN COUNCIL\r\n\r\nThe chief event of the century, from the point of view of Roman\r\nCatholicism, is undoubtedly the holding of the Vatican Council. Since\r\nthe Council of Trent the bishops of the Catholic world had not met in\r\ncommon under the guidance of the Bishop of Rome. The gravest interests\r\nof religion seemed at stake after more than a century of public\r\ninfidelity and the overthrow of all former safeguards of faith. The\r\ncharacter of doctrinal authority and its visible tangible possessor\r\nwere declared by the dogma of Papal infallibility. The genuine\r\nrelations of reason and revelation were set forth in unmistakable\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe troubles that followed the close of the Council in some parts of\r\nEurope were neither serious nor long-lived, since its teachings were in\r\nkeeping with the general sense of Catholicism. It promoted, notably,\r\nmutual respect and concord among the bishops and gave to the multitudes\r\nof Catholics in the Old and New Worlds a new sign of the unity and\r\ninternal vigor of the Church. The scenes of the Council are indelibly\r\nfixed in my memory, for I was the youngest and humblest of the six\r\nhundred and sixty-seven bishops who composed it.\r\n\r\nA General Council is the very highest act of the life of the Church,\r\nsince it presents within a small compass, and at once, all the\r\nmovements that have been developing in the course of centuries,\r\nand offers to all the faithful and to all outside the Church\r\nstraightforward answers to all the great ecclesiastical problems that\r\ncome up for settlement. Had the Vatican Council been finished it would\r\nhave taken up the grave subject of ecclesiastical discipline. That is\r\nreserved for the reopening of the Council at some future date.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSIONS OF CATHOLICISM\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent on the Catholic Church to spread the teachings of Jesus\r\nChrist, and this by His own divine command: “Going, therefore, teach\r\nall nations.”\r\n\r\nIn this last century she has not been unfaithful, any more than in\r\nothers. No portion of the vineyard has been neglected; the martyr’s\r\nblood has watered some parts more abundantly, but in all the missionary\r\nhas toiled without ceasing, has spent himself. In the Far East Catholic\r\nmissions have been carried on in India, China, Thibet, Tonkin. In\r\nevery part of Africa, northern, central, and southern, the priests and\r\nnuns of the Catholic Church have preceded the explorer or followed the\r\ntrader and the miner with the blessings of religion. In the still pagan\r\nparts of North and South America her missionaries are found all through\r\nthe century. They have kept up their vigils in the Holy Land, and in\r\ngeneral have made a notable progress.\r\n\r\nThe inventions of the age have been beneficial by opening up new lands\r\nand by making transit easy and rapid, thus recalling some of the\r\nconditions which conduced to the original spread of the religion of\r\nJesus. A multitude of noble souls have devoted all to the enlightenment\r\nof the barbarian and pagan world. And while I disparage no land, and\r\ndo not undervalue the good intentions and efforts of those outside our\r\npale, I cannot pass over in silence the French nation, which has given\r\nmore abundantly than any, perhaps more abundantly than all others, of\r\npriests, sisters, and funds for the essential duty of Catholicism.\r\nThe work of the Propagation of the Faith and the Seminary of Foreign\r\nMissions at Paris deserve a special souvenir as often as Catholic\r\nmissions are mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPES OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nSix Popes ruled the Church in the nineteenth century: Pius VII., Leo\r\nXII., Pius VIII., Gregory XVI., Pius IX., and the present venerable\r\npontiff, Leo XIII. In the person of Pius VII. they have known what\r\nmartyrdom was like, also the shame and humiliation of being subject\r\nto a civil power absolute in its character and prone to unwarrantable\r\ninterference with the ecclesiastical power, even to contempt of its\r\nmost ancient and venerable rights. In Gregory XVI. and Pius IX.\r\nthey learned the purposes and the power of those who in Europe have\r\nsucceeded to the men of the French Revolution. In Leo XIII. their line,\r\nthe oldest line of rulers on the earth, can boast of a most enlightened\r\nmind and a very sympathetic heart. Long time a bishop of an important\r\nsee before he was made Pope, he has been at the level of every task\r\nimposed upon the Papacy.\r\n\r\nIn a particular manner he has been the patron of ecclesiastical\r\nstudies, by his scholarly encyclicals on philosophy, Scripture,\r\nhistory, and other branches of learning. A noble specimen of this\r\nactivity is his late letter to the bishops of France on the studies\r\nof the clergy. His spirit is the Christian spirit of reconciliation\r\nand concord, yet without sacrifice of the immemorial rights and the\r\nsolemn obligations of the Apostolic See. He may not live to see the\r\nrestoration of his independence, and the reparation of the wrong\r\ninflicted upon the Holy See, but he can maintain a protest that will\r\nforever invalidate among Catholics the claim of the actual government\r\nand keep open the Roman question until it is rightly settled.\r\n\r\nCatholics cannot forget that the Pope for the time being is, according\r\nto Catholic doctrine, the successor of Saint Peter in all his rights\r\nand privileges as the visible head of the Church, appointed by Jesus\r\nHimself. Hence, among other duties, he has to safeguard the approved\r\ntraditions and the general legislation of the past, to protect the\r\nstatus of the Church as given over to him, and to hand it down\r\nundiminished to his own successor. Precisely because he is the head\r\nof the Church he may not licitly alter its organic and regular life,\r\nor arbitrarily abandon the almost sacrosanct ways along which his\r\npredecessors have moved, or give up lightly the institutions in which\r\nreligion has gradually found a setting for itself.\r\n\r\nI venture to say that this element of fixity in the attitude of\r\nthe Apostolic See will be more appreciated in another age, more\r\nconstructive and architectonic than the past, less querulous and\r\ndestructive, even if less daring and brilliant. Forever to pull down\r\nand scatter, and never to build up and perfect, cannot be the final\r\npurpose of human society. It is perhaps worth remarking that the\r\naverage reign of the Popes was much longer in the nineteenth century\r\nthan in any other, being over sixteen years, and that two successive\r\nreigns, those of Pius IX. and Leo XIII., represent fifty-four\r\ncontinuous years of Church government at Rome, a phenomenon not\r\nwitnessed since the foundation of that Church by Saint Peter and Saint\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY\r\n\r\nDuring this century the Holy Father has been able to restore the\r\nCatholic hierarchy in England, Scotland, Holland, and to create it\r\nanew in India. This means the orderly management of the works and\r\nthe purposes of the Catholic religion, since the episcopate is the\r\ndivinely instituted organ for its spread and its administration. In\r\nmany lands a numerous episcopate has sprung up. In our own beloved\r\ncountry it has grown almost at the rate of one see for every year\r\nof the century. The apostolic activity of the episcopate has been\r\nusually beyond reproach. The care of souls, the creation of parishes,\r\nbuilding of churches, convents, schools, and charitable institutions\r\nhas gone on in every diocese of the Catholic world. Some bishops have\r\ndistinguished themselves by their sanctity of life and their love for\r\nthe poor; others by their learning and their skill in their writing\r\nworks of utility for the faithful; others by their holy martyrdoms,\r\nboth in pagan and Christian lands; others by devotion to great works of\r\ncommon charity and utility—nearly all by their exemplary lives and the\r\nconscientious performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nNo nation has a monopoly of this outpouring of the highest sacerdotal\r\ndevotion; and no nation or people, as far as I can learn, has been\r\nwithout a steady succession of remarkable bishops, men who would have\r\ndone honor to any age of Christian history. I believe that it is the\r\nconstant and edifying service of the episcopal body which is chiefly\r\nresponsible for the improvement in learning, morality, and laborious\r\nenlightened zeal on the part of the clergy, diocesan and monastic,\r\nwhich it seems just to claim for the nineteenth century. In some\r\nlands the episcopal office is freer than in others, and its beneficent\r\nactivity is more immediate and visible. In all the bishops have kept\r\nthe bond of unity, often at no inconsiderable sacrifice of personal\r\ncomfort. Neither schism nor heresy of any formal and noteworthy nature\r\nhas been connected with the episcopal office. It would ill become me\r\nto discriminate where the merits are so equal. I may, however, be\r\npermitted to rejoice with my countrymen at the end of the century that\r\nthe life and the teachings of a Carroll, a Cheverus, a Bruté a Neumann,\r\na Dubois, have not been without salutary effect, and have set a shining\r\nmark for the imitation of all coming generations. Particularly have\r\nsuch men inculcated habitual courtesy and charity in dealing with all\r\nthose who did not share the faith of Catholics. They were fresh from\r\nthe storms of foreign religious hatred and infidel intolerance, and\r\nknew by personal experience the benefit of mutual good understanding\r\nand personal respect.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, particularly, the Catholic episcopate has been\r\nvery active in providing for the most fundamental spiritual needs\r\nof their flocks—churches for religious services, priests for the\r\nadministration of sacraments, schools for the preservation of the\r\nrevealed Christian faith, orphanages for the little waifs and castaways\r\nof society. Whether short or long, the periods of government of these\r\nChurch rulers have never been idle nor marked by self-indulgence.\r\nAlmost every one has left some monument of faith as a contribution\r\nto the general good of Catholicism. I would neither exaggerate nor\r\nboast, yet it occurs to me, after many years of service, travel, and\r\nobservation, that few ages of Christianity can show a more laborious\r\nand elevated episcopate than the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe recruiting of the diocesan clergy has been the gravest duty of\r\nthis episcopate, for religion lives by and for men. It can get along\r\nwithout wealth or monuments, but not without intelligent teachers of\r\nits tenets and faithful observers of its precepts. In keeping with\r\nthe decrees of the Council of Trent diocesan seminaries have been\r\nopened where it was possible, and elsewhere provincial institutions\r\nof a similar character. Both flourish in the United States, and grow\r\nmore numerous with every decade. The older clergy, long drawn from\r\nthe venerable schools of Europe, have left a sweet odor among us,\r\nthe purest odor of self-sacrificing lives, of devotion to poor and\r\nscattered flocks, of patient, uncomplaining contentment with the\r\ncircumstances of poverty and humility. There is no diocese in the\r\nUnited States where there cannot be heard tales of the hardships and\r\nbrave lives of the ecclesiastics who laid the foundations of religion.\r\nWe remember them always, and hold their names in benediction. The\r\nyounger generation of our clergy enjoys advantages denied to their\r\npredecessors; but we consider that they owe it to those predecessors if\r\nthey have a degree of leisure to perfect the culture of their minds,\r\nand a faithful Catholic people to ask for the benefits which must\r\naccrue from greater learning, if it be solid and well directed.\r\n\r\nYet I cannot admit that our older clergy were deficient in the learning\r\nof the schools. The names of England and Corcoran are at once on our\r\nlips, not to speak of a long array of others almost equally entitled\r\nto distinguished mention. If the external conditions of the diocesan\r\nclergy have improved, their relations to the Church authority have\r\nbeen safeguarded with even greater earnestness and efficiency. The\r\ndispositions of synods, provincial councils, and the three plenary\r\ncouncils of Baltimore have, we are happy to say, had little to do with\r\nquestions of doctrine. They have all been held for the improvement\r\nof discipline and notably for the welfare of the clergy. In the same\r\ndirection, also, have tended the numerous decisions and instructions\r\nfrom the Roman congregations, whose wisdom has never been invoked\r\nby us in vain, and whose sympathy for our conditions we gratefully\r\nacknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONGREGATION OF THE PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nAny account of the good influence of the Holy See on our ecclesiastical\r\nconditions would be unjust and incomplete if the Congregation of the\r\nPropaganda Fide were omitted. To it we owe an unceasing surveillance,\r\nfull of prudence and intelligence. From its offices have come to the\r\nbishops regularly counsel, warning, encouragement, co-operation. It\r\nhas been eminently just and fair, also fearless in the application of\r\nthe principles, the spirit, and the letter of canonical discipline.\r\nIts action is a calm and grave one, marked by reticence and patience\r\nand that composure which belongs to the highest judicial decisions.\r\nBut the Catholic Church in the United States and in Canada owes it an\r\nundisputed debt of gratitude. The most learned cardinals of the century\r\nand the best ecclesiastical talent have co-operated in the creation of\r\nits legislation, which need not fear the criticism of any learned and\r\nhonest judicial body of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS ORDERS AND COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nIn the religious orders and communities the Catholic Church possesses a\r\nvery ancient auxiliary force that has rendered incalculable help during\r\nthe century. By their numbers, their strong inherited traditions, their\r\ncentral government, their willing obedience, and their other resources\r\nthey have come everywhere to the aid of the bishops and the diocesan\r\nclergy. Often they bore alone and for a long time, and at great\r\nsacrifices, the whole burden of religion. Their praise is rightly\r\non all sides, and their works speak for them, when their modesty and\r\nhumility forbid them to praise themselves. The missions of Catholicism\r\nin this century, as in others, have largely fallen to them. They stood\r\nin the breach for the cause of education when the churches were too\r\npoor and few to open colleges. They have given countless missions and\r\nretreats, and in general have not spared themselves when called upon\r\nfor works of general utility. They and their works are of the essence\r\nof Catholicism, and they ought rightly to flourish in any land where\r\nthey are free to live according to the precepts and the spirit of their\r\nfounders, who are often canonized saints of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nI shall not be saying too much when I assert that among the invaluable\r\nservices rendered to the Church by Catholic women of all conditions of\r\nlife—no unique thing in the history of Catholicism—those rendered\r\nby the women of religious communities are of the first rank of merit.\r\nPrimary Catholic education, in the United States, at least, would have\r\nbeen almost impossible without their devotion. It is owing to them that\r\nthe orphans have been collected and cared for, the sick housed and\r\nsheltered, the poor and helpless and aged, the crippled and the blind,\r\nlooked after regularly and lovingly. They surely walk in the footsteps\r\nof Jesus, doing good wherever they go. The perennial note of sanctity\r\nin the Catholic Church shines especially in them. Content with food and\r\nclothing and shelter, they devote their lives, often in the very flower\r\nof youth and health and beauty, to the weak and needful members of\r\nChristian society. He must needs be a Divine Master who can so steadily\r\ncharm into His service the purest and the most affectionate of hearts,\r\nand cause them to put aside deliberately for love of Him even the most\r\njustifiable of human attachments. This argument for Christianity is\r\nnot new; it was urged by Saint Justin the Martyr on the libertine world\r\nof the Antonines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITY OF CHRISTENDOM\r\n\r\nThroughout this century the Roman Church has desired and sought by all\r\npractical means the restoration of the former unity of Christendom.\r\nEach succeeding Pope has appealed to the ancient but separated Churches\r\nof the Orient, reminding them of the past oneness and the need of union\r\nwith that see which all their records proclaim the rock and centre of\r\nunity. Similarly, appeals have been issued to the divided Christian\r\ncommunities of the West, as when Pius IX. wrote to the members of\r\nthe Protestant world before the Vatican Council, and when Leo XIII.\r\nlately addressed his famous encyclical on the Unity of the Church to\r\nall men of good will within the Anglican pale. Such efforts may seem\r\nperfunctory; but they have in our eyes a deep meaning. They proclaim\r\nthe doctrine of unity that is clearer than the noonday sun from the\r\nteachings of Jesus; they make a first step in the direction of its\r\nrestoration; they keep alive the spirit of charity in many hearts, and\r\nthey stir up countless prayers for the consummation of an end that\r\nfew believing Christians any longer consider unnecessary. Already\r\nthe canker-worms of doubt and indifference are gnawing at those last\r\nfoundations of the old inherited Christian religious beliefs that still\r\nworked beneficently outside the pale of Catholic unity, but are now\r\ndisappearing from the public consciousness because, too often, they\r\nare no longer elements of private conviction. In the realm of faith,\r\nas in that of nature, there is an after-glow, when the central sun has\r\nspent its force; but in both that glow is the herald of coldness and\r\ndarkness. To those who no longer allow in their hearts any Christian\r\nbelief, Catholicism has strongly appealed in the nineteenth century\r\nby its teachings on the right use of reason in matters of faith, the\r\nclaims of religion on the mind and the heart of man, the benefits of\r\nChristianity, and its superiority over all other forms of religion—in\r\na word, by the constant exposé of all the motives of credibility\r\nwhich could affect a sane and right mind that had divested itself of\r\nprejudice and passion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSIONS TO CATHOLICISM\r\n\r\nNot the least remarkable share of the history of Catholicism is seen in\r\nthe stream of conversions that began in the very stress of the French\r\nRevolution and has not ceased to flow since then. From every land of\r\nthe Old and New Worlds hundreds of thousands have returned of their\r\nown volition to the ancient fold wherein we firmly believe is kept the\r\nsacred deposit of saving truth. They have come to us from the pulpits\r\nof opposing religions and from the workshops of an unbelieving science.\r\nEvery condition of life, and both sexes, have sent us numerous souls.\r\nVery many of these conversions have been unsolicited and unexpected.\r\nSome of them meant an accession of wealth or social prestige or\r\nhigh rank. Others brought with them the beloved tribute of uncommon\r\nintelligence, experience of life and men, acquired erudition, the\r\nhighest gifts of style and oratory. Very many have come from the middle\r\nwalks of life, and signified no more than a great weariness of pursuing\r\nshadows for the reality of divine truth, and the excessive goodness of\r\nthe Holy Spirit of God which bloweth where it listeth. Of this army of\r\nconverts some have been drawn by the conviction that the Bible alone,\r\nwithout an interpreter and a witness divinely guaranteed, could not\r\nsuffice as a rule of faith. Others have been moved by the incarnation\r\nin the Church of the spirit and functions of authority without which\r\nno society can exist. Still others have come back to the Mother of all\r\nchurches, through a deep heart-weariness at the endless dilapidation\r\nof divine truth outside the Roman Church. Some have sought and found\r\nthrough the study of history the open door to the truth. Others again\r\nthrough the study of art and its functions in the Christian Church. In\r\nwhatever way they returned to the unity of the original sheepfold, they\r\nare an eloquent witness to the innate vigor and the immortal charm of\r\nthe Christian truth as preserved in Catholicism. For they have come in\r\nunconditionally. Their return has worked beneficially, not only for\r\nthemselves, but for those of the Catholic faith, whom it has consoled\r\nand encouraged for their steadfastness, while the non-Catholic world\r\ncannot but feel that that religion is worthy of respect, even of study,\r\nwhich can forever draw so many men and women out of the ranks of its\r\nadversaries, even at the sacrifice of many things which are usually\r\nheld dear by society.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS WITH CIVIL AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nBeing a genuine and world-wide religion, Catholicism could not but come\r\ninto contact with the powers in which rests the social authority.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the fundamental relations of both have been settled by\r\ndocuments of a _quasi_ constitutional character known as concordats.\r\nThey are binding on both parties, yet in more than one case the supreme\r\nauthority of Catholicism has had reason to complain of their violation\r\neither in letter or in spirit.\r\n\r\nImportant points like the freedom of episcopal elections, the\r\nmanagement of ecclesiastical revenues, the freedom of access to and\r\ncommunication with the Holy See, have been tampered with or openly\r\nabolished. In a general way Catholics are far from being content\r\nwith the actual administration of these _quasi_ treaties between\r\nthe civil and the ecclesiastical powers in the Old World and in\r\nSouth America—yet they respect them and desire to live up to their\r\nrequirements. It is to be hoped that in the new century there will\r\nbe less suspicion of the truly beneficent intentions of the Church,\r\nand less hampering of the common organs of her existence and work.\r\nIn a century filled with revolutions as no other the Catholic Church\r\nhas comported herself with dignity and equity, and managed to find\r\nthe correct _via media_ in this great tangle of opposing and mutually\r\ndestructive forms and theories of government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIn our own beloved country we have every reason to be thankful that\r\nthe liberty to worship God according to the dictates of conscience\r\nis guaranteed by the Constitution, and has entered deeply into the\r\nconvictions of our fellow-citizens. The Catholic Church, by her own\r\nconstitution, is deeply sympathetic with our national life and all\r\nthat it stands for. She has thrived in the atmosphere of liberty,\r\nand seeks only the protection of the common law, that equal justice\r\nwhich is dealt out to all. She is the oldest historical and continuous\r\ngovernment on the earth, and it is no small index of the value of our\r\ninstitutions and their durability that they make provision for the life\r\nand the work of so vast and so aged a society. It would also seem to\r\nshow that, through a long course of centuries, Catholicism held as its\r\nown genuine political teachings only such as were finally compatible\r\nwith the most perfect and universal citizenship known to history.\r\n\r\nWhen this nation was forming, the first Catholic bishop in the United\r\nStates, and my first predecessor in the see of Baltimore, John\r\nCarroll, accepted and performed satisfactorily the gravest public duty\r\nof a citizen, an embassy to another people for the benefit of his own\r\ncountry. Thereby he left to us all an example and a teaching that we\r\nshall ever cherish, the example of self-sacrifice as the prime duty of\r\nevery citizen, and the teaching that patriotism is a holy conviction\r\nto which no Catholic, priest or layman, can hold himself foreign or\r\napathetic.\r\n\r\nA Catholic layman of the same distinguished family, Charles Carroll\r\nof Carrollton, threw in his lot with the patriots from the beginning,\r\nand by word and deed served the cause of American liberty, while he\r\nlived to see it flourish and inform more and more the minds and hearts\r\nof the first generation of American citizens. In future centuries, as\r\nin this, his name will be held in honor and benediction as a signer\r\nof the Declaration of Independence. His Catholic belief and conduct\r\nwill forever be a potent encouragement to the children of his own\r\nfaith. He was the first layman to contribute notably to the cause of\r\nCatholic education, and the native formation of the priesthood, by the\r\nestablishment of a college for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\nWe have done our best in these ten decades to provide the best\r\neducation for our people and our priests. Intimately convinced that\r\ngeneral education without religion is destined to be an evil rather\r\nthan a blessing, we have created all over the United States a system of\r\nprimary education in parochial schools that has cost us and yet costs\r\nus the gravest sacrifices and entails the heaviest solicitudes. Yet we\r\nfeel that we are serving the cause of God and country by indoctrinating\r\nour Catholic youth with persuasions of the existence of God and His\r\nholy attributes, of the true nature of vice and virtue, of conscience\r\nand sin, of the spiritual and the temporal, of the proper purposes\r\nof life, of punishment and reward in an immortal life. We believe\r\nthat Christianity is better than paganism; also that Christianity\r\nis something simple, positive, historical, that can and ought to be\r\ntaught from the cradle to the grave, good for all conditions, for both\r\nsexes, and for every situation in life this side of the common grave.\r\nBelieving this, we have shaped our conduct accordingly, and trust to\r\nGod for the issue. In such matters it imports more to be right in\r\nprinciple than to be successful. Our secondary system of education\r\nhas gone on from the founding of the Republic. Colleges for boys and\r\nacademies for girls have risen up in every State and Territory, have\r\nbeen supported by the faithful people, and are doing an incalculable\r\ngood. As our means increase and other advantages offer, we hope\r\nto improve them; Catholicism is no stagnant pool, but a field for\r\nevery good private initiative that respects right and truth. In the\r\nCatholic University of America, founded in the last decade of the\r\ncentury by Pope Leo XIII. and the Catholic hierarchy, after due and\r\nlengthy deliberation, and made possible by the magnificent generosity\r\nof a Catholic woman, we have centred our hopes of a system of higher\r\neducation that shall embody the best traditions of our ancient Church\r\nand the approved gains of our own times. American Catholics have not\r\ndisposed in the past of great wealth, inherited or earned; hence all\r\nthese works mean an incredible devotion and intensity of good will and\r\nsustained sacrifices. Wherever the Catholic Church has been strong and\r\nsuccessful, schools of every kind flourish. I need only recall the\r\nfact that the idea, the constitution, the functions, the influences of\r\na university were unknown in the world until she created the type in\r\nthe Middle Ages, and gave over to mankind a new factor in civil and\r\nreligious life—the power of organized learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThrough the whole century one line of thought and action has been\r\ngradually disengaging itself from all others and dominating them.\r\nThat is the social movement, or the tendency towards a more evenly\r\njust and natural conception of all the relations that arise from the\r\ncommon dwelling of mankind in organized society. It has long taken the\r\nform of institutions and plans for the betterment of the conditions\r\nof the people, of woman, of all who suffer or think they suffer from\r\nthe actual organization of society. If there is something Utopian in\r\ncertain plans or hopes, there is too much that is justifiable at the\r\nroot of other attempts to reorganize our social conditions. Not to\r\nspeak of the undesirable inheritances of the past, the new conditions\r\ncreated for the common man by the spread of industrialism and\r\ncommercialism have often been painful in the extreme, and have aroused\r\nboth violent protests and deep sympathy. By the help of God we have\r\nabolished the reproach of slavery in every civilized land, but we hear\r\nfrom the laboring multitudes a vague cry that they are already in the\r\nthroes of a return to that accursed institution.\r\n\r\nHere the doctrines of Catholicism are eminently in accord with the\r\nright conception of human nature, the functions of authority and mutual\r\nhelp or charity, the duty to live, and the right to all the necessary\r\nmeans for that end. She is sympathetic, historically and naturally, to\r\nthe toiling masses, who, after all, form everywhere the bulk of her\r\nadherents, and have been always the most docile and affectionate of her\r\nmembers. It is she who created in the world the practical working idea\r\nof a common humanity, the basis of all genuine social improvement. The\r\ntrials of Catholicism have come more often from the luxury and the\r\nsin of those in high places than from the disaffection of its great\r\nmasses. As this movement has gathered force, and passed from theories\r\ninto the domain of action, the Catholic Church, through her head, has\r\nfollowed it with attention and respect. The whole pontificate of Leo\r\nXIII. is remarkable for acts and documents which have passed into the\r\nhistory of social endeavor in the nineteenth century. His personal\r\ncharities, large and enlightened, are as nothing in comparison with\r\nthe far-reaching acts like the refusal to condemn the association of\r\nthe Knights of Labor. His encyclical on the Condition of Workingmen\r\nrecalls the only possible lines of a final concord between labor and\r\ncapital—the spirit and teachings of Jesus Christ, the best Friend our\r\ncommon humanity ever had. In the same way, his latest encyclical on\r\nJesus Christ, with which the religious history of the century closes,\r\nemphasizes the true basis for the restoration of peace and harmony\r\nand justice between the poor and the rich, between the producers of\r\ncapital and the capital that stimulates and regulates production. We\r\nmay be confident that the papacy of the future will not show less\r\nenlightenment and sympathy in its attempts to solve these delicate and\r\ngrave problems with the least injustice and the greatest charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTS AND SHADOWS\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to deny or to palliate the many shadows that fall\r\nacross the history of Catholicism in the century that has elapsed. I\r\nscarcely need refer to the weaknesses and errors of her individual\r\nchildren: such acts she repudiates, and when she can chastises\r\nremedially. But the Church has not recovered that vast inherited\r\nmoral power over the public life which it enjoyed before the French\r\nRevolution. In many ways the consequences of atheism, materialism, and\r\neven of deism, have been deduced into manners and institutions, to\r\nthe detriment of the ancient Christian morality. The sterner Christian\r\nvirtue of previous centuries, founded on the Christian revelation,\r\nhas been forced out of the public life of whole peoples. Expediency,\r\nopportunism, moral cowardice have often triumphed over the plain right\r\nand the fair truth. The principle has been established that God is on\r\nthe side of the great battalions, is ever with the strong men of blood\r\nand iron. Ancient and venerable sovereignties have been hypocritically\r\ndispossessed. Small nationalities have been erased from the world’s\r\npolitical map, and the history of the near past almost justifies the\r\nrumors of impending steps in the same direction. With the increase of\r\ngreatness in states comes an increase of warlike perils, not only from\r\ncommercial rivalry, but from that root of ambition and domination which\r\ngrows in every heart, unless checked and subdued in time, and which\r\nin the past has been too often the source of violent injustice on the\r\ngreatest scale.\r\n\r\nThese deeds and principles we believe to be a necessary result of\r\nnaturalism, of the exclusion of the supernatural and revealed elements\r\nof Christianity from our public life, and not only these, but others\r\nof a graver character, that must one day follow from their logical and\r\nunchecked evolution. Divorce, a cause of ruin in every land, grows\r\nwith rapidity in many civilized nations, so much so that not only\r\nCatholicism, its inveterate enemy, is shocked, but Christian men of\r\nevery persuasion believe that some public and authoritative steps ought\r\nto be taken to prevent the pollution of the family life, that fixed and\r\nnatural source of public morality. Religion has been officially thrust\r\nout of the systems of education, in every grade, and the young mind\r\ntaught that it is quite a private and unimportant thing. Thus, under\r\nthe plea of indifference, many States have practically made themselves\r\nthe champions of that agnosticism which is the arch-enemy not only of\r\nreligion, but also of patriotism from time immemorial connected with\r\nreligion. The average man soon ceases to make great sacrifices, above\r\nall to die for the public good, when he is satisfied that there is no\r\nother life, or that it is not worth while living for the uncertainties\r\nof approval and reward by an eternal God, who is just and true and holy.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR ENCOURAGEMENT\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Catholic man or woman knows that there are great\r\nspiritual forces at work in the world, however unhappily its public\r\nlife may be developing from the view-point of Christian morality. There\r\nare innumerable lives guided by the principles of Christian virtue,\r\nsome of them even culminating in the highest sanctity. Though not\r\nall such are known to men, yet not a few become public examples and\r\nincitements to virtue. Even outside of the Catholic faith there are\r\nnot a few who regulate their lives by the natural virtues and also by\r\ninherited Christian virtues that work sometimes unconsciously, but\r\nwhose practice can only be pleasing to our common Father. Sweet Charity\r\nis yet a queen in Christian lands; her services and utility are too\r\ngreat to permit her dethronement. Great misfortunes of any kind still\r\ntouch the hearts of men that are Christian yet when their minds have\r\nbecome clouded by indifference to, or dislike of, the supernatural\r\nverities. Luxury and wealth, greater perhaps than the world has yet\r\nseen, are still conscious of duties to the common weal. Educational\r\ninstitutions of every character and philanthropical enterprises of\r\nevery variety have flourished on the means thus provided. But from our\r\npoint of view it is better that all such phenomena, to be lasting,\r\nshould have their root and origin in Christian purposes and belief. It\r\nis yet true, as it was of old on the hill-sides of Judæa: “Except the\r\nLord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. Except the Lord\r\nkeepeth the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.” (Psalm 126.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF CATHOLICISM\r\n\r\nWe entertain no doubt that the organization which has weathered the\r\nstorms and stress of so many centuries will continue to do so in the\r\nfuture. The Catholic Church has the promises of her Divine Founder\r\nthat the gates of hell shall not prevail against her. How could she\r\ndoubt of her future? It does not seem likely that any vicissitudes can\r\narise which have not their counterpart or analogy in the past, so old\r\nis she on this earth, and so many are the forms of government and the\r\nkinds of human culture with which she has lived. We are confident that\r\nshe will be equal to all the emergencies of the future, for while the\r\nChurch is always identical with and present to herself in a conscious\r\nway, her children and her agents may grow in experience and wisdom,\r\nas they undoubtedly do, and may bring both of these factors to bear\r\nupon the future problems of our common humanity. Of one thing we may\r\nfeel certain: she will never cease to desire and to work for that\r\nefficacious unity of all Christendom, which is the permanent wish of\r\nits Holy Founder, and for which her bishops and priests have never\r\nceased to pray in those opening words of the Roman Canon of the Mass\r\nthat we repeat daily: “Therefore, O Most Clement Father, we suppliantly\r\npray to Thee through Jesus Christ Our Lord... especially for Thy Holy\r\nCatholic Church, which mayst Thou vouchsafe to pacify, keep, unite, and\r\ngovern throughout the world.”\r\n\r\n            JAMES, CARD. GIBBONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTESTANTISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motives which have acted upon religion in the nineteenth century,\r\neither by way of directly enhancing its power or by restricting its\r\ninfluence, are these: (1) Humanitarianism; (2) The Historical Spirit;\r\n(3) Science; (4) Nationalism. Although the course of religious history\r\nhas varied somewhat in different countries as well as in the different\r\nChurches, yet it is possible to form an approximate picture of the\r\nresultant of these forces which will reveal the progress of the Kingdom\r\nof God in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe first of these motives—humanitarianism—has powerfully influenced\r\nthe Christian world by asserting the rights of man, liberty, equality\r\nand the spirit of fraternity, the sense of human brotherhood. The germs\r\nof the humanitarian movement may be traced in the eighteenth century,\r\nas in the teaching of Lessing and Herder and Rousseau; in religious\r\nmovements like the Great Awakening in the United States, the revival\r\nin England under Wesley and Whitefield, in tentative efforts for the\r\nabolition of slavery (Hopkins and Clarkson), and prison reform (John\r\nHoward). But the nineteenth century has been distinguished above all\r\nthe other Christian centuries in the results achieved by the sentiment\r\nof humanity. It has led to the abolition of slavery under English rule,\r\nin the United States, and in Russia; to many reform movements of every\r\nkind and degree, wherever there existed actual or latent tyranny,\r\nwhich robbed humanity of its inherent privileges.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian sentiment is Christian in its origin, derived\r\nprimarily from the conviction of the incarnation of God in Christ.\r\nChrist appears in history as the leader of humanity in the struggle for\r\nfreedom. Slowly but surely ever since His advent, the world of man has\r\nbeen moving forward to the attainment of the ideal of humanity revealed\r\nin Him. “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\r\nAnd if the Son of God shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”\r\nThe progress towards freedom inspired by Him who taught the fatherhood\r\nof God and the brotherhood of men has been accomplished in the face\r\nof great hinderances and long reverses, overcoming obstacles which\r\nwould have been insuperable without Christian faith. In the nineteenth\r\ncentury the movement towards human freedom seems almost to have reached\r\nits culmination. Within the sphere of religion the progress is most\r\nmanifest in the spread of Christian missions, which stand out in any\r\nreview of the century as one of its most extraordinary achievements.\r\nIt might be justly designated as a missionary age. So intense and\r\npersistent has been its devotion to the gospel of Christ as essential\r\nfor man that when the century closed it might be truly said that the\r\nround world had been girdled with Christian missions, whose results\r\nare more significant for civilization, as well as for religion, than\r\nany statistics can reveal. The missionary has been the pioneer, it is\r\nbecoming increasingly evident, of momentous changes yet to appear.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of humanity has operated as a motive in the study of\r\nhuman history, giving to historical inquiry a new interest and impetus.\r\nNo age has been so fruitful in the results of historical research,\r\nwith conclusions of vital importance for every department of life,\r\nbut chiefly this, that an independent place has been vindicated for\r\nhumanity, as having a life of its own distinct from and above the\r\nnatural order of the physical world. The study of man as he appears\r\nin history has tended to strengthen faith in the essential truths of\r\nreligion, opening up as it has done the deeper knowledge of the nature\r\nof man to which the religion of Christ appeals; for the modern method\r\nof studying history, as compared with earlier methods, consists in\r\nseeking for those inward subjective moods of the human soul which\r\nlie beneath creeds or institutions, and not solely in the accurate\r\ndescription of the objective fact. The facts of human life call for\r\ninterpretation, and for this the historian must search. Thus has been\r\nborn what is almost a new department of inquiry—the philosophy of\r\nhistory (Hegel and many others). Differ as do these attempts at a\r\nphilosophy of history, they yet possess one ruling idea—the conviction\r\nof a development in the life of humanity when viewed as a whole. The\r\nidea of development controlled the higher intellectual life of the\r\nfirst half of the century. It was applied with important results to the\r\nstudy of ecclesiastical history, by Schleiermacher, Neander, Gieseler,\r\nBaur, Rothe, Bunsen, and many others, by the Roman Catholic Möhler,\r\nin his _Symbolik_, and by John Henry Newman, in however one-sided and\r\nimperfect manner. The doctrine of development found its classic formula\r\nin the lines of Tennyson:\r\n\r\n    “Yet, I doubt not through the ages\r\n      One increasing purpose runs,\r\n    And the thoughts of men are widened\r\n      With the process of the suns.”\r\n\r\nThe influence of the doctrine of development has been felt in the\r\nstudy of Scripture, leading to a recognition of progressiveness in\r\nthe divine revelation, whose record has been preserved in the Old and\r\nNew Testaments (Mozley, _Ruling Ideas in the Early Ages_). By means\r\nof this truth have been overcome, till they now seem unworthy, the\r\nobjections to the Old Testament on the ground that it gave sanction\r\nto cruelty, deceit, or an imperfect morality. But the inference has\r\nalso followed that the revelation of God to humanity must be searched\r\nfor in the sacred records, and even by the light of close critical\r\nscrutiny, if the divine utterance is to be distinguished from crude\r\nmisapprehensions or misapplications. Forms of literary expression,\r\ncurrent usages, the historical environment of the time—for these\r\nallowance must be made as their influence is recognized. The science\r\nof biblical criticism has gained from the study of general history a\r\nlarger knowledge of the nature of man, which, in turn, has made the\r\nstudy of the Bible more profound and thorough, because more real and\r\nhuman than were the biblical studies of the eighteenth century. The\r\nprimary question which it has been found necessary to ask in regard to\r\nany doctrine or institution is not whether it is true—for the canons\r\nof truth may vary with the relative position of the inquirer; but,\r\nrather, what does it mean? When the meaning of the record is seen, the\r\nquestion of its truth has answered itself.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these studies, even of what is called the “higher\r\ncriticism,” has not lessened the authority of the Bible or changed\r\nthe character of Christianity as “a religion of the book”; but their\r\ntendency has been to vindicate the unique and essential place of the\r\nBible in literature as containing the veritable record of a divine\r\nrevelation. Some things, indeed, have been changed: the order in which\r\nthe books of the Bible were written is not the order in which they\r\nstand; some of them are of composite authorship, whose various parts\r\nwere written at different times; the traditional chronology, known as\r\nUssher’s (1656), has been abandoned, nor is there anything in the Bible\r\nwhich places it in opposition to the teachings of geology relative\r\nto the length of time during which man has occupied the earth; the\r\nhistorical order of priest and prophet has been reversed, so that the\r\nvoice of prophecy comes before the decline into ritual (Wellhausen\r\nand others). Popular misapprehensions tend to vanish in the light of\r\na true insight and interpretation, such as that the first chapter of\r\nGenesis was intended to be an infallible record of the divine order in\r\nthe creation of the world. That a similar account of the creation is\r\nfound in Babylonian literature only shows that the Bible writer was\r\nillustrating by the best scientific knowledge of the time the vastly\r\nhigher spiritual truth with which the Bible opens, that the creation is\r\nthe work of God, thus leading man to the worship of God and away from\r\nthe lower worships of sun and moon and all the hosts of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical conceptions as to the mode of inspiration and revelation\r\ntend to give way before a larger and truer conception of the process\r\nby which the revelation is made—that God speaks to man actually and\r\nauthoritatively through the experience of the events of life. Thus\r\nrevelation becomes a living process, and all later history may become\r\na commentary on sacred history, renewing and confirming the primal\r\nutterance of God to the soul of man. Much, it is true, yet remains\r\nto be done in bridging the gulf between the learned and scientific\r\ninterpretation of the sacred record and the popular apprehension,\r\nwhich, formed in the uncritical moments of youth, often persists to\r\nmature years and constitutes a source of confusion and weakness. A\r\nsimilar situation was seen in the Middle Ages in the wide breach which\r\nexisted between the scholastic theologians and the popular mind.\r\n\r\nA new department has been added to religious inquiry in Comparative\r\nReligion, which aims at an impartial investigation and free from\r\nprejudice, and is also moved by the sentiment of a common humanity\r\nto respect all utterances of religious feeling in the soul of man.\r\nHow widely the nineteenth century has advanced in this respect is\r\nseen by recalling a statement of Dr. Johnson: “There are two objects\r\nof curiosity—the Christian world and the Mohammedan world. All the\r\nrest may be considered as barbarous.” One of the most representative\r\nmonuments of religious scholarship in the last century is Professor\r\nMax Müller’s _Sacred Books of the East_. Some inquirers in this\r\nunfamiliar department have worked under the impression that these\r\nancient religions were equal in value to the Christian revelation;\r\nothers even have thought them to be in some respects superior. And,\r\nin general, the first effect of the discovery that there was truth in\r\nother religions had a tendency to weaken the claim of Christianity to\r\nbe the absolute religion. But as the results of the study have been\r\nplaced in their normal perspective, it becomes evident that they only\r\nconfirm the words of St. Paul, that God has at no time left Himself\r\nwithout witnesses in the world. Revelation also is seen to have been a\r\nuniversal process; and profound spiritual motives are to be discerned\r\nbeneath the diverse manifestations of the religious instincts. Yet, on\r\nthe whole, the preponderating judgment leads to the conclusion that\r\nChristianity contains the larger, even the absolute, truth; that while\r\nit confirms some features in these religions as true, it condemns\r\nothers as false; that Christianity also has for one of its essential\r\ncharacteristics an assimilative power, which not only enables, but\r\nforces, it to appropriate as its own any aspects of truth contained\r\nin other religions, which have not hitherto been illustrated in the\r\nhistory of the Christian Church. Nor is the familiar test applied to\r\nreligions wholly indefensible which judges them by their historical\r\nfruits or associations. In accordance with this test, Confucianism is\r\nrepresented by China, Hinduism by India, Buddhism by Ceylon and Siam,\r\nMohammedanism by Turkey, Christianity by Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the humanitarian sentiment may be further traced in\r\nsoftening the asperities of some forms of traditional theology, as, for\r\nexample, the Calvinistic doctrine of election with its alternatives\r\nof reprobation or preterition. These certainly have not been the\r\nfavorite doctrines which have commended themselves to the spirit of the\r\nage. The effort has been made to bring the doctrine of the atonement\r\nwithin the limits of human experience. It has been found impossible\r\nto present the doctrine of endless punishment after the manner of an\r\nearlier age. Many causes have combined to deepen the sense of mystery\r\nin which is enveloped the destiny of man, and there has been begotten\r\nin consequence an unwillingness to dogmatize where in earlier times\r\nsuch a reluctance was not felt. In this connection may be mentioned\r\ntwo religious bodies, which took their rise about the beginning of the\r\ncentury—Universalism, proclaiming ultimate salvation for all men; and\r\nUnitarianism, asserting the dignity of man and his divine endowment.\r\nBut in all the Churches alike has the same humanizing force been felt,\r\nleading to efforts in theological reconstruction in order to make\r\nit apparent that the primary truths of Christianity are not merely\r\narbitrary principles or arrangements unrelated to life and to the needs\r\nof the soul, but that in their essential quality there is conformity\r\nwith the larger reason of humanity, with that feeling for the inherent\r\nworth of things out of which reason proceeds, and with which its\r\nconclusions must conform.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThus far the humanitarian sentiment has been regarded in its\r\ncombination with Christian faith, and as giving new force and\r\ndistinction to Christian life and thought. But, on the other hand, it\r\nmust now be noted that the same force working apart from the Church,\r\nand often in opposition to it, has been a limitation to Christian\r\nprogress. In the French Revolution humanitarianism was associated with\r\na negative, destructive tendency, which overthrew the Church, disowned\r\nGod and immortality, and set up in the place of deity a so-called\r\nGoddess of Reason. This negative tendency has continued to exist and\r\nhas found influential manifestation. It has attempted the deification\r\nof humanity, as though the human race were worthy in itself of being\r\nan object of worship. It has exalted man at the expense of God,\r\nconceiving of humanity as alone immortal, as competent to steer its own\r\ncourse without supernatural direction. It has weakened the sense of\r\nnationality, has injured and endangered family life, has taken away the\r\nhighest sanctions from morality, and has reduced religion from being a\r\nrevelation from God to a purely subjective process in the soul of man,\r\nworthy of respect, but without authority. It has created an abnormal\r\nsensitiveness in many directions. It has swayed socialistic movements\r\naiming at the rights of man and seeking to achieve universal happiness,\r\nbut with an antagonism sometimes latent, sometimes expressed, to God\r\nand Christ and the Christian Church. The prejudice remains which\r\nhad its birth in the French Revolution, that religion is a creation\r\nof priests for their own selfish ends, and the Church an agency for\r\nrobbing humanity of its rights, liberty, equality, and fraternity.\r\n\r\nPrinciples and convictions like these found utterance in the philosophy\r\nof Comte (1789–1857), who called himself the “founder of the religion\r\nof humanity,” and who proposed the scheme of a humanitarian Church,\r\nlimited by no national boundaries, whose only deity was man, whose\r\nritual found a place only for great men who had been the benefactors\r\nof the race. Theology and metaphysics were discarded as outgrown\r\nmethods of explaining the phenomena of the universe, and in the place\r\nthey vacated stood the so-called “Positive philosophy” which rejected\r\nall supernatural influence. The Church of humanity had, indeed, no\r\nhistory and was a failure from its birth. But the combination, first\r\nseen in Comte, of humanitarianism with the methods and principles of\r\nnatural science, has been the most formidable opponent against which\r\nChristianity was ever called to struggle. It has been represented in\r\nEngland by John Stuart Mill and by Herbert Spencer and many others. To\r\nthe influential writings of this school of thinkers is due in great\r\nmeasure the widespread, deep-seated scepticism since the middle of\r\nthe century. To the same cause, by way of reaction, are owing the\r\nspiritualistic movement, the so-called “Christian Science” and other\r\nkindred tendencies towards a crude supernaturalism.\r\n\r\nThose who entered the controversy in behalf of Christianity and against\r\nthe adherents of the Positive philosophy suffered at first for the\r\nlack of any adequate philosophical method on which to rest in the\r\neffort to overcome this stupendous alliance between a humanitarianism\r\nworking for the improvement of social conditions in combination with\r\nnatural science, whose postulates involved the denial of the miracle,\r\nand indeed of all supernatural agency (agnosticism). It seemed for a\r\ntime as though the philosophy of Hegel would serve the purpose of a\r\nstronghold to which Christian warriors might resort while in the stress\r\nof a conflict which involved not only the readjustment of Christian\r\ndoctrines to their new environment, but also the maintenance of the\r\nidea of God, of the kingdom of God in this world and of a future life\r\nfor the immortal soul. In Germany systems of theology were worked\r\nout on the basis of Hegelian principles, which, as interpreted by\r\northodox theologians, stood for a principle of surpassing value if\r\nit could be maintained—that the life of humanity, while dependent in\r\nthe present order on physical conditions, was yet above the life in\r\nexternal nature with which the natural sciences deal; that the very\r\ndefinition of humanity implies the power of rising to the knowledge of\r\nGod. Nature has no knowledge or consciousness of God, or intimation\r\nof immortality. It is in bondage to natural law and without freedom.\r\nThe life of humanity must not be studied from the point of view of\r\nnatural science, but is seen in the records of human history. The\r\ninfluence of Hegel deepened the interest in historical inquiry at a\r\nmoment when the absorption in the natural sciences threatened to gain\r\nthe ascendency. But the Hegelian philosophy, for reasons which it is\r\nnot possible here to render, failed to accomplish the service expected\r\nfrom it. It may be that the failure was temporary only, and because\r\nit was not fully understood. There arose a school of thinkers—the\r\nHegelian left wing—who, while retaining their interest in history,\r\nyet fell under the influence of the presuppositions of the natural\r\nsciences. Thus Strauss, in his _Leben Jesu_, conceived of the person of\r\nChrist as a casual product of the human imagination, while Feuerbach,\r\nin his _Essence of Christianity_, reached the conclusion that religion\r\nbegins and ends in a subjective process in the soul. Thus, instead of\r\novercoming the Positive philosophy, German thought gravitated to the\r\nsame result, with this difference perhaps, that it assumed the form\r\nof pantheism rather than of atheism. In the Tübingen school, led by\r\nF. C. Baur, whose contributions to the study of Church history are yet\r\nof high value, there was reserve about the miracle, if not its tacit\r\ndenial, and a conception of the Christian Church as a product of human\r\norigin rather than the purpose of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut the effect of Strauss was beneficial in that it sent inquirers\r\nback to the study of the person of Christ and of His age. Never before\r\nwas attention so concentrated upon the life of Jesus, as illustrated in\r\na large number of biographical works, too large to be enumerated here.\r\nAs a result of these studies, the conviction grows that while there\r\nis a local aspect of the person of Christ, so that He reflected the\r\npeculiar opinions and living interests of His age, and availed Himself\r\nof current beliefs, yet He was also infinitely above His time. What He\r\nwas and did and said in Palestine nineteen hundred years ago must be\r\nsupplemented by what He has been to the world in subsequent ages, or\r\nwhat He is and is doing in the present age.\r\n\r\nWhile Christian thinkers were struggling with the problems raised by\r\nthe Positive philosophy, the natural sciences were commanding in an\r\nincreasing degree the world’s attention, until Darwin made his great\r\ndiscovery of a law of evolution, when it seemed as though natural\r\nscience had become the arbiter and final tribunal before whose\r\njudgments the world must bow. Then there followed the sharp, even\r\nbitter conflict between science and theology, when scientific men whose\r\nlives had been spent in devotion to the study of natural phenomena\r\nwere tempted to write expositions of religious history in order to\r\nshow the fallaciousness of the religious attitude, and theologians,\r\naccustomed only to the postulates of the spiritual sphere, ventured\r\ninto the domain of science to put a spiritual interpretation on its\r\nconclusions and discoveries. It was a confusing and painful moment\r\nwhen a subtle scepticism pervaded the Churches and haunted even the\r\nminds of Christian believers. Now that the smoke of the battle has\r\ncleared away, while many tragedies are disclosed, it does not appear\r\nthat the Churches have been weakened by the strife or have yielded any\r\nessential truth or conviction. The belief in God, and in his creation\r\nand government of the world, the incarnation of God in Christ, the\r\nmiracle for which Christ stands, and pre-eminently the miracle of His\r\nresurrection—in a word, the supernatural interpretation of life,\r\nremains unshaken. It is unjust to charge, as has sometimes been done,\r\ndishonesty and a spirit of evasion against those who, while the fierce\r\nbattle was in progress, kept silence, unable to defend by cogent\r\nargument what yet they cherished still as true.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the century there came efforts at the\r\nreconstruction of theology in order to a better adjustment of the\r\nincrease of knowledge regarding the nature of God and His relation\r\nto the world. The doctrine of God as immanent in the world, and not\r\nonly transcendent or above and apart from it, has proved valuable in\r\nreconciling many of the discoveries of history and of natural science\r\nwith the Christian faith. Efforts have also been made to simplify\r\ntheology by the reduction of the large and complex, even conflicting,\r\nmass of Christian tenets and beliefs, given in history or represented\r\nin various Christian sects, to a few simple principles in which all\r\nmust agree, resting for their confirmation not on metaphysics, but on\r\nthe genuine Christian instincts as revealed in the New Testament. There\r\nhas been attained also a better philosophical method for meeting the\r\ndifficulties and perplexities of the age.\r\n\r\nBut these attempts at the better interpretation of revealed religion,\r\nand the formation of more consistent theological systems, have found\r\na temporary rival in efforts to create, first of all, a better system\r\nof “natural theology,” as it may be called, which shall take account\r\nof the doctrine of evolution and other discoveries of natural science\r\nsince Paley’s time and the day of the Bridgewater Treatises. Those\r\nwho aim at a reconciliation of religion with science treat the idea\r\nof evolution as a mediating principle by which the conflict between\r\nscience and religion may be overcome. This effort is the more\r\nsignificant, in view of the popular interest in evolution—a word\r\nwhich has become almost the watchword of the age. From this point of\r\nview the invasion of religious territory by scientific men (Huxley,\r\nTyndale, Haeckel, and others), and the counter-invasion of scientific\r\nterritory by philosophers and theologians, give promise of some mutual\r\nunderstanding in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt remains now to turn to another most potent motive which has\r\naffected the fortunes of religion in the nineteenth century. It may\r\nbe called Nationalism, meaning by the term that higher conception of\r\nthe life of the state or nation, slowly but most effectively asserting\r\nitself throughout the nineteenth century, never apart from religious\r\nconvictions, always indeed in their support and furtherance. In\r\nillustration of this point, we turn again to the French Revolution,\r\nas giving the momentum, both directly and by way of reaction, to\r\nthe conception of the sacredness of the state, as an ultimate fact\r\nin God’s government of the world. In that fearful outburst of the\r\nFrench people, their long pent-up indignation was vented no less\r\nagainst the state than against the Church—the one a device of kings\r\nand lawgivers for holding mankind in subjection, as the other was a\r\nscheme for the same end by a designing priesthood. The humanitarian\r\nsentiment received in consequence at this impressive moment a direction\r\nof antipathy to nationality as an evil to be overcome, or at least\r\nto be kept in subjection to some higher principle, if the rights of\r\nman were to be secured. Something even of this negative mood entered\r\ninto the formation of the American Constitution, where there is to\r\nbe noted a singular omission of any reference to Deity as the author\r\nand preserver of the national life. On the continent of Europe there\r\nwas the phenomenon of Napoleon building on the ruins of the French\r\nRevolution, while yet preserving the destructive motives which inspired\r\nit. Napoleon revived the dream of empire, in whose expansive embrace\r\nthe nations of Europe were to be subordinated, if not suppressed\r\naltogether. He proposed to reconstruct the map of Europe, as though\r\nnationalities and crowns were purely human artificial arrangements to\r\nbe disposed of at his sovereign pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the French nation, its demonstrated inability to do\r\nthe proper work of a state, as well as the fact that the career of a\r\nNapoleon was possible, indicates inherent weakness in all the nations\r\nof Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century. They existed\r\neither in repose, and even stagnation, after the long turmoil of the\r\nage of the Protestant Reformation, averse to change, distrustful of\r\nenthusiasm, or were content to strive for purely selfish aims. In\r\naccordance with the principle that the people existed for the state,\r\nrulers followed their personal whims, indifferent to moral sanctions,\r\nheedless of the growing evils calling aloud for redress. Such in\r\nparticular was the condition in France. It was better in England, but\r\neven there the same tendency existed, manifested in the unnecessary\r\nalienation of the American colonies. However this may be, there has\r\nbeen a reaction against nationality during the nineteenth century.\r\nThe nations have been forced to struggle against this opposition,\r\nand through the struggle they have attained their rebirth, their\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nThe subject is connected with the fortunes of religion in many ways.\r\nThe indifference to nationality, the distrust of the nation as\r\nincompetent for the exigencies of life, the placing of an abstract\r\nhumanity as an ideal above nationality, so that to labor directly for\r\nthe interests of humanity apart from the well-being of the nation,\r\nand even in its defiance, became the motive of reformers—these\r\ncharacteristics, when seen in the religious sphere, have led to a\r\nreaction against the various forms of Protestantism, and especially as\r\nrepresented in the state Churches. The Roman Catholic Church, which in\r\nall its history has subordinated national distinctions to the higher\r\ninterests of a common Christendom, had fallen into inefficiency in\r\nthe eighteenth century, and was no longer reckoned a force worthy of\r\nconsideration, either by religious thinkers or by statesmen. But in the\r\nfirst third of the nineteenth century there came a change, when the\r\nRoman Church arose from its lethargy to meet the demand imposed upon\r\nit by the timid fears of statesmen and ecclesiastics, as the safeguard\r\nof religion and morality, where national Churches or particular\r\nChurches were thought to have failed. The Napoleonic aspiration after\r\nuniversal empire and the frantic effort to realize it by rearranging\r\nor suppressing nationalities has its counterpart in the religious\r\nworld in the effort to restore a Christian empire with the Papacy at\r\nits head, as in the Middle Ages. The effect of this ambition may be\r\nseen in Germany and other countries, but is most clearly manifest in\r\nEngland, where the Oxford Movement (1833) appears as an unnational, if\r\nnot anti-national, uprising in behalf of some imperfectly conceived\r\ncosmopolitan Church designated as “Catholicity.” The date of the\r\n“Movement,” as Newman fixed it, was Keble’s sermon on the “Apostacy of\r\nthe National Church.” This same feeling, that national existence is\r\ninferior in importance to humanitarian reforms or to the expression of\r\nreligion in some other shape than in any particular or national Church,\r\nhas been shown in the break with the Established Church in Scotland, or\r\nin the difficulties experienced in Germany in consolidating the forms\r\nof Protestantism in a strong state Church, or in the aspirations after\r\nsome universal form of religion to be accomplished by a parliament of\r\nreligions. Beneath these various schemes there is the common principle\r\nthat humanity is a worthier object of devotion than the state, and\r\nconstitutes a higher ideal in whose cause to labor. This conviction, it\r\nmay be added, has been strengthened vastly by the extraordinary way in\r\nwhich, during the nineteenth century, the whole world has been brought\r\ntogether by the material forces of steam and electricity.\r\n\r\nThat there is here a great truth no one can deny, but the point to\r\nbe noticed now is that nationality has been at a disadvantage in the\r\ncompetition with humanity. Out of the necessities of the situation\r\nthere has been born the spirit of a deeper inquiry into the place and\r\nsignificance of the nation as the indispensable medium by which the\r\nhighest result can be secured for the world at large. Thus we have\r\nthe studies in this direction of German students, Hegel and Stahl,\r\nTrendelenburg and Bluntschli, Maurice in England, and in America\r\nMulford in his book _The Nation_, all of them combating the motive of\r\nComte and setting forth the essential, even the eternal, significance\r\nof nationality. The ancient doctrine is still preserved that the people\r\nexist for the state, but it is justified on the ground that the state\r\nalso exists for the people, for the freedom of the individual man, so\r\nthat through the state the rights of man are better subserved and more\r\nsecurely guaranteed than by an exclusive one-sided devotion to the\r\ncause of an abstract humanity.\r\n\r\nAs the nineteenth century drew to its close, it became increasingly\r\napparent that the nations had emerged from the depression in which\r\nthey were found when the century opened. America may be said to\r\nhave attained the consciousness of nationality in its highest form\r\nin consequence of the Civil War, and to have entered from that time\r\nupon a new career. In that awful conflict, whose origin dates back to\r\nthe rise of the anti-slavery movement, may be discerned the issue of\r\nthe century—humanitarianism, on the one hand, contending for the\r\nrights of man, careless, if need be, for the national unity if only\r\na great reform could be secured; and on the other hand, the nation,\r\nslowly realizing that slavery was a force hostile to national unity\r\nand integrity, and on this ground demanding its suppression. The two\r\nattitudes in this instance appear organically related, while yet\r\nthey spring from distinct and separate motives. In 1870 Germany and\r\nItaly took their places in the family of nations. Nor should there be\r\nomission to mention Greece, which, after its subsidence for hundreds of\r\nyears, again attained its national independence.\r\n\r\nIt has become further apparent that it is to the Protestant nations,\r\nAmerica, England, and Germany, that the leading place must be conceded,\r\ntogether with the determination of the world’s fortunes. And to\r\nthese must be added Russia, which is also outside the pale of Latin\r\nChristianity. Those nations remaining in alliance with the Papacy are,\r\nfor the present at least, in an inferior position.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant assertion of the spiritual significance of nationality\r\nin the latter part of the nineteenth century has made it further\r\napparent that the forces working for religion, and especially for\r\nits Protestant forms, were stronger than the forces in opposition.\r\nThe nation enters the arena of the controversy as a spiritual force,\r\nassuming as a first principle the existence of God and His supernatural\r\ngovernment of the world. Never was this truth more impressively\r\nillustrated than in the experience of Lincoln, who, when he became\r\nPresident of the United States in the supreme crisis of its history,\r\nceased to be indifferent to religion and passed into a devout belief\r\nin the mysterious control of the destiny of the nation by a sovereign,\r\nomnipotent hand. As the indifference to nationality was among the\r\ncauses of religious doubt and of the weakness in the Churches in the\r\nmiddle of the century, so the triumphant assertion of nationality has\r\ncontributed to turn the tide towards theistic belief and the Christian\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nTo give a full exposition of the inner relationship of the nation to\r\nreligion and the Churches is not possible here, but some remarks may be\r\noffered which will tend to illustrate their organic connection.\r\n\r\n(1) In any large historical survey the nation appears as guided by\r\nreligious leaders. Religion is seen to have flourished in proportion\r\nas the nation is conscious of its strength and destiny. When the\r\nRoman Empire broke down the nationalities and merged them in a large\r\ncomposite unity, it broke down also religious faiths, and its own\r\nreligion as well, till scepticism was the result and a consequent\r\nimmorality. All attempts to build up religion on the basis of empire,\r\nas distinct from nationality, ended in failure.\r\n\r\n(2) The Christian religion tended from the first to break up the empire\r\nand to restore nationality. Ultimately it became manifest that the\r\ncause which undermined the Roman Empire and accomplished its downfall\r\nwas the Christian Church. In its Eastern half the empire was resolved\r\ninto nationalities. In the West a Church, Latin Christendom, rose upon\r\nits ruins, but within this Latin Christendom the spirit of nationality\r\nbegan at once to work, forcing its way against the opposition of\r\nthe Papacy, till, in the age of the Protestant Reformation, when\r\nnationality was felt as a conscious motive, it sundered Latin\r\nChristendom into fragments.\r\n\r\n(3) The Old Testament in its form as a whole is simply the history of\r\na nation from its birth through all its fortunes. Never did religion\r\nrise to a diviner and fuller expression than under the realization of\r\nthe conviction that God was protecting the nation and determining its\r\ncareer. The Hebrew prophets were primarily statesmen, devoted to the\r\nnationality, as the incarnation of the divine will, in whose fortunes\r\nwere revealed the divine purpose. Any nation which has not the similar\r\nconviction that it is the chosen people of God, and called to some\r\nimportant task, cannot maintain its independence and integrity, and has\r\nno future. This conviction to-day inspires the leading nations of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n(4) The nation mediates between humanitarianism and individualism. In\r\nserving its own ends and seeking to accomplish its mission, it works\r\nfor the good of all, and also for the freedom of the individual man.\r\nThe tendency of humanitarianism as a motive apart from the higher life\r\nof the state, or apart from its impersonation in Christ as its head and\r\nleader, is to weaken individualism and to defeat the very end it wishes\r\nto subserve, the achievement of the rights of man. Humanity as a whole\r\nlacks the visible, tangible embodiment of the nation. It has not yet\r\nthe consciousness of itself nor of its unity. It cannot respond to the\r\nneeds it awakens. It does not, as a whole, realize its relationship to\r\nGod, nor is it placed in such a position as to make it feel the need\r\nof God. It is in danger of becoming an abstraction in so far as it\r\nexists without relationships. But the nation is close at hand, near,\r\nand felt as a moral personality or being, seeking ideal ends which are\r\nalso within the bounds of possibility. Humanity as a whole undertakes\r\nno enterprises which make it tremble as it comes to unknown, trackless\r\nseas. But when the nation comes to great crises, where human wisdom\r\nis powerless to direct its course, it falls back instinctively and by\r\nnecessity upon the belief in the guidance of God. Thus the nation as a\r\nwhole appears in a higher form of personality than individual men can\r\nachieve, even the greatest men, and so prepares the way for the belief\r\nin the still higher, the invisible, infinite personality of God.\r\n\r\n(5) The nation as a moral personality and depending upon God becomes\r\nthe safeguard of morals. If there has been a decline in morality in the\r\nnineteenth century, as some maintain, shown in the general weakening\r\nof moral sanctions, or by the increase of divorce and indifference to\r\nthe sacredness of family life, it must be attributed in some measure\r\nto the indifference to nationality from the time that political\r\nliberalism resting on an abstract humanitarianism, or in combination\r\nwith a scientific naturalism, gained the ascendency. So far as this\r\ntendency has in any degree invaded the Christian Church it has been\r\npowerless to effect a change for the better. The great men whom\r\nhumanity is directed to worship do not constitute a moral standard,\r\nnor can scientific postulates be made a basis for moral culture; for\r\nnature is at least unmoral, if not, as some assert, immoral, and it is\r\nonly as acted upon by man that nature gives response to the increasing\r\npurpose of the world. Religious truths—the personality of God, His\r\ncreation and government of the world, immortality, and the freedom\r\nof the will—these are shattered, we are told, “by the great eternal\r\niron laws of the universe,” or “are in hopeless contradiction with the\r\nmost solid truths of empirical science.” And so, it must be added,\r\nare the sanctions of ethics and moral law. It is when we turn to the\r\nstate, to the moral personality of the nation, that we encounter other\r\nlaws and living forces which restore what an empirical science or a\r\ntranscendental humanitarianism has broken down. Here the supreme test\r\nis spiritual—the well-being of the nationality. The state must build\r\nupon the family as its corner-stone; it must enforce those moral laws\r\nwhich the history of nations, as well as human experience in its best\r\nestate, reveal to be the inmost expression of the normal life of man.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a new century may seem like an artificial division\r\nof time, but the self-consciousness with which the nineteenth century\r\nclosed, the efforts at introversive estimates of its place in history\r\nand of the work it had accomplished, indicate something more than a\r\nconventional barrier to be passed. Prophecies in regard to the new\r\nage may be futile, for God reserves to Himself the knowledge of the\r\nfuture. But it is much if we can to any extent read the meaning of the\r\npast and detect the sources of its strength and weakness. And for the\r\nrest, Christian faith and hope are inextinguishable, looking forward to\r\nthe fulfilment of the Christian ideal—that higher unity where Christ\r\nappears as the embodiment of humanity and the voice of its yearning for\r\na perfect brotherhood; where the nation also acknowledges Him as its\r\noverlord, so that, in the words of Christian prophecy, the kingdoms of\r\nthis world shall become the kingdom of our God and of His Christ. In\r\nthat ideal conception, the _dominium_ belongs to the state, and the\r\n_ministerium_ to the Christian Church.\r\n\r\n            ALEXANDER V. G. ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AND JUDAISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening years of the nineteenth century found the Jew blinded\r\nby the light of a new sun, the rays of which were beating upon the\r\nGhetto and were forcing him to take off, one by one, the many garments\r\nwith which he had clothed himself during the hostile Middle Ages. For\r\nthe Jew these Middle Ages did not end with the Reformation and the\r\nRenaissance; but only disappeared in the transformation brought about\r\ngradually by the French Revolution. The beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury sees him putting on some of these garments again, and trying\r\nto save his own warmth from being lost in the coldness of the outside\r\nworld. During this period the Jew has passed through more upheavals\r\nthan many nations have during three or four times the number of years.\r\nWhat outward struggles has he not been called upon to experience;\r\nthrough what alternating seasons of joy and sorrow has he not passed!\r\nWhat changes even within his own body has he not sustained! The modern\r\nEuropean and American world has had a hard fight to find its way into\r\nits present changed condition; but much harder by far was the task\r\nlaid upon the Jew; and, whether he has succeeded or not, he has made\r\nan honest fight. Evidences of the struggle abound on every hand, and\r\nthe road is strewn with many a dead hope and many a lost opportunity.\r\nThe Jew was bound more firmly to ancient traditions; and so interwoven\r\nwere these ancient traditions with his whole being that the new life\r\ninto which he came had of necessity to be blended with the old. The\r\ntale of the Jew of the nineteenth century is a record of his endeavor\r\nto do justice to the two demands which were made upon him: the one from\r\nthe outside world—to fit himself to take his place worthily and do\r\nhis work side by side with the other citizens of the state in which he\r\nlived; the other from within his own ranks—to harmonize his religious\r\nbelief with his new point of view and to adapt his religious exercises\r\nto modern social conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the Jews in the various European countries for civil\r\nrights and for equality before the law was long drawn out, and was\r\nmarked by varying fortunes dependent upon the political conditions of\r\nthese countries. More than seventy years of the century had passed\r\nbefore this struggle had been fought out. Though it is true that a\r\nbeginning was made in Germany and Austria (1750 and 1781), to France\r\nbelongs the honor of having been the first to really do away with\r\nthe mass of anti-Jewish legislation which the centuries preceding\r\nhad piled up. On the 27th of September, 1791, the National Assembly\r\nat one stroke removed all the disabilities under which the Jews\r\nhad been living—distinctive dress, special Jew’s oath, Jew’s tax,\r\nforced residence in certain localities, etc. From France, and under\r\nthe influence which that country then exercised, the emancipation of\r\nthe Jews spread to Belgium and Holland, and to some of the states\r\nof Germany; but the rest of Europe was not yet ready for this\r\nemancipation. The reaction which marks the period between 1814 and\r\n1848 made itself felt upon the Jews, restoring, in many places, the\r\ndisabilities under which they had formerly lived. The “Judengassen”\r\nbecame once more inhabited, and the principles of freedom and\r\nliberty for all members of the state seemed to have been wellnigh\r\nforgotten. The Revolution of 1830 stayed the downward course in some\r\nof the German states; but it was not until 1848 that the second great\r\nperiod in Jewish emancipation came about. In the breaking down of old\r\ninstitutions it was natural that the exceptional laws against the Jews\r\nshould go also. The German Parliament of 1848, at Frankfort, forcefully\r\nproclaimed the doctrine of religious liberty; and of this parliament\r\na Jew, Gabriel Riesser, was vice-president. But it was not until the\r\nformation of the German Empire, in 1871, that the emancipation of the\r\nJews, which had gradually made its way in the various states, was\r\ncarried through for the whole of that empire. In 1867, a decree was\r\nissued in Austria by virtue of which all citizens were declared equal\r\nbefore the law, and in 1870 the walls of the Ghetto fell in Rome. In\r\n1874, Jews were admitted to the rank of citizens in Switzerland. In\r\n1878, the Congress of Berlin, the leading spirit of which (Disraeli)\r\nwas of the Jewish race, demanded equal rights for the Jews living in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula. These rights were accorded by the various states\r\nthere, with the exception of Roumania; which, in spite of the treaty\r\nand in spite of the promises made at the time, still continues to\r\nrefuse to allow the Jews living within its borders to become citizens\r\nor to treat them as an integral part of the population. In Turkey the\r\nlaws which put certain restrictions upon non-Mohammedan citizens were\r\nsensibly changed in 1839; so that the Jews living in the dominions of\r\nthe Sultan suffer from no exceptional legislation.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Jewish emancipation in England suffered no such sudden\r\nchanges as it did on the continent. It proceeded by regular stages\r\nthrough the abrogation of the Act of Test in 1828, the admission\r\nof Jews as citizens of London in 1830, as sheriffs in 1835, as\r\nmagistrates in 1845, and in 1858 as members of Parliament by the\r\nremoval of the words “upon the faith of a Christian” in the oath taken\r\nby the members. There can be no doubt that the emancipation in England,\r\nthough long drawn out and fiercely contested, was more effective than\r\nanywhere else, owing to the fact that it was progressive in character\r\nand based upon the idea of rights demanded and not upon that of favors\r\ngranted. Nothing was asked of the Jews in England other than that they\r\nbe good citizens of the state; while the whole continental legislation\r\nregarding them, from the time of Napoleon on, had on the part of the\r\nlegislators only one object in view—to break up the cohesion of\r\nthe Jews as a body and to pave the way for their disappearance as a\r\ndistinctive group. The idea that emancipation was a favor and not a\r\nright brought it about that the Jews themselves aided in their own\r\ndisintegration. They believed that it was their duty to show themselves\r\nmore patriotic than were the other citizens of the state in which they\r\nlived, as they were receiving greater favors. And so, even though Jews\r\nhave sat in the parliaments of various continental states, they have\r\nwith few exceptions steadfastly refused to acknowledge themselves to\r\nbe in any way representatives of their brethren, and in some cases\r\n(notably in France) during the last few years have either remained\r\nsupinely indifferent when Jewish questions were before their several\r\nparliaments, or have even aided those whose agitation was directed\r\nagainst their fellow-Jews. In England, on the contrary, the Jewish\r\nmembers of Parliament have never forgotten that, in addition to\r\ntheir interests as citizens of England, they have a duty to perform\r\nto the Jews, whom they also represent, and they have therefore been\r\nable, while giving their best services to the state, to be also\r\nuseful to their co-religionists. It may be due to this cause that the\r\nemancipation of Jews on the continent has in no way been able to stem\r\nthe recrudescence of anti-Semitism; while it has undoubtedly done this\r\nin England. The opposite effect is most clearly seen in Algiers, where\r\nthe wholesale emancipation of the Jews in 1870, through the efforts\r\nof Crémieux, that bold champion of his people, has in a large measure\r\ncontributed to make the riots possible which have in late years been\r\nwitnessed in that French colony. Neither the population of Algeria nor\r\nthe Jews there were at that time ready for such a measure; it did not\r\ntherefore come as the result of a development among the people, but as\r\nsomething imposed upon them by the government.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Roumania, Russia is practically the only country which\r\nhas refused to enter the European concert, and which by means of laws\r\nand ordinances represents still the dark period of the Middle Ages.\r\nIt has turned the provinces on its western borders into a tremendous\r\nGhetto, and driven the Jews to exile by making life within that pale\r\npractically impossible. Even Portugal in 1821, and Spain in 1868 (the\r\ntwo countries from which the Jews had been banished for a great number\r\nof years), opened their doors to them once more; though few Jews have\r\nventured to return to the Peninsula, despite the fact that in 1886 a\r\ncommittee was formed in Madrid for the promotion of Jewish immigration\r\ninto Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WANDERING JEW\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew is not the Jew of legend, but the Jewish people\r\nof history. The dislocation of large Jewish bodies, which was\r\ncharacteristic of the Middle Ages, has been kept up during the\r\nnineteenth century; and this dislocation has, as in former times,\r\nprofoundly modified Judaism in the various countries. From the\r\nfifteenth century on to the nineteenth, hostile legislation on the\r\npart of Western Europe had been continually driving the Jews to\r\nthe East. The expulsion from Spain and Portugal, at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, forced several hundred thousand into Turkey; while\r\nthe hardships which they had to suffer in the smaller German states\r\nand in Austria caused large numbers to seek a refuge in Poland and\r\nRussia. The tide commenced to turn westward about the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century, though bands of Jews from Poland had been\r\ndriven into Germany, Italy, and Holland in the terrible years of the\r\nChmelnicki persecutions (1648–1651). The readmission of Jews into\r\nEngland, the relative kindness of Frederick William of Prussia and of\r\nFrederick the Great, aided a certain slow but continuous infiltration\r\nfrom Poland, so that at the end of the eighteenth or the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century these Polish Jews were to be found in all\r\nparts of Germany, Holland, and England. This slow migration back again\r\nto Western Europe took on, however, much larger proportions in the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century; but before this could happen a\r\nstrong movement still farther westward had already taken place. Jews\r\nwere among the earliest settlers on the American continent. They were\r\nin nearly every case of Spanish or Portuguese descent, having come\r\nfrom Holland and England to the possessions which these powers held on\r\nthe new continent. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when the\r\ntide of immigration from Germany was at its height, a large number of\r\nJews from the southern states and the Rhine region found their way to\r\nthese shores. The Russian atrocities of 1882 and the following years\r\ncaused a greater shifting of the Jewish population westward than can be\r\nparalleled at any previous time. It has been estimated that between the\r\nyears 1882 and 1900 fully one million Russian Jews left their homes\r\nin the pale of settlement, finding new dwelling-places in England,\r\nGermany, and France. The largest number (probably half a million) came\r\nto the United States and Canada. Untoward economic conditions existing\r\nin Galicia, and the frequent outbreaks of anti-Semitism there, forced\r\nout during the 90’s a large number of Galician Jews; and in 1899 and\r\n1900 the hostility of the Roumanian government has made it impossible\r\nfor thousands of Jews to remain in a country in which most of them had\r\nbeen born; and, under circumstances the like of which has hardly ever\r\nbefore been seen, bands of the Roumanian Jews have been wandering over\r\nEurope, seeking the means by which to come to the American continent\r\nin order there to establish themselves anew. There are between ten and\r\neleven million Jews to-day in the world: of these, about nine million\r\nlive in Europe; one million in the United States and Canada; three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand in Africa; three hundred and fifty thousand\r\nin Asia; and sixteen thousand in Australasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nAll these changed circumstances variously modified the organization\r\nof the Jewish communities. Napoleon’s attempt in 1807, as the result\r\nof the Sanhedrin which he had convened in Paris, to found this\r\norganization upon a modern basis, dividing the Jews of France into\r\ncertain consistories and arrondissements, had an effect not only upon\r\nFrance, but also upon those countries which for a time were under his\r\ninfluence (Holland, Belgium, etc.), and even upon many of the German\r\nstates. In 1808 such consistories were established in Westphalia and\r\nCassel; in 1809, an Oberrath was created in Baden; and in 1828 and 1831\r\nan Oberkirchenbehoerde in Würtemberg. It was due also to Napoleon that\r\nin France and Germany the Jews were obliged to adopt family names,\r\nthey having, in most cases, still retained the Oriental custom of\r\nsimply adding to their own prænomen that of their father. Prussia was\r\nthe only one of the German states which was not so affected. There the\r\nstate exercises a supervisory influence, compelling all the Jews to be\r\nmembers of the Jewish community, but in no way further regulating the\r\ncommunal life. When the Reform tendencies commenced to make themselves\r\nfelt in the larger Jewish communities, the Orthodox members safeguarded\r\ntheir own interests by making use of the law passed in 1873, mainly\r\nthrough the efforts of the Jew Lasker, which enabled the people to\r\ndeclare themselves “confessionslos” and form their own synagogues,\r\nthus nearing in a measure the system followed in English-speaking\r\ncountries. In England and America no such organization was effected,\r\nas the state does not there take cognizance of the religious belief of\r\nthe people. In both these countries attempts have been made by the Jews\r\nthemselves to organize under one head upon a purely religious basis,\r\nbut without much success. In France there is a Chief Rabbi of the\r\nJews who is recognized by the state as their rabbi and head. But the\r\nChief Rabbi of the Jews in the British Empire, though he is nominally\r\nthe head of the Jews in the kingdom, has no actual position as such,\r\nand is even not recognized by certain schools of Jews themselves. The\r\nSefardim, or descendants of Spanish and Portuguese Jews, have always\r\nkept themselves distinct, and have their own Chief Rabbi, or Haham. In\r\nthe year 1840, the more liberal-minded element among the London Jews\r\ncut themselves loose from the United Synagogue and formed a Reform\r\nparty, their example being followed in Manchester and Bradford. Neither\r\nthey nor the recent immigrants from Russia, who have formed their own\r\n“Federation of Synagogues” recognize the authority of the Chief Rabbi.\r\nThis more congregational system has been carried to its utmost limits\r\nin the United States, where each congregation is a law unto itself and\r\nabsolutely rejects any interference on the part of any larger body.\r\nFrom time to time a desire has been manifested to supersede this purely\r\ncongregational system by some form of union. The late Dr. Isaac M.\r\nWise, of Cincinnati, had at various times attempted to bring the Jews\r\nof the United States together with an authoritative synod at their\r\nhead. Out of this and other attempts have come the Central Conference\r\nof American Rabbis and The Union of American Congregations (founded\r\nin 1873), which now comprises about ninety-one congregations. These\r\norganizations, however, do not by any means represent either all of\r\nthe Jewish ministers or all of the Jewish congregations, and the Union\r\nitself is merely a deliberative body having no power to do anything in\r\nthe internal affairs of one of its constituent synagogues. Since the\r\nunion of American Jewish congregations comprises only such as stand\r\nupon a Reform platform, a union of Orthodox congregations was formed in\r\nNew York two or three years ago, and it is hoped that this organization\r\nwill do much towards binding together the very many congregations of\r\nthose who adhere strictly to traditional Judaism.\r\n\r\nBut the organization of Jews as a church has not been found sufficient.\r\nSpread over so large a portion of the earth and coming under such\r\nvarying influences, it was inevitable that the theological differences\r\nwhich already existed should grow apace, and a great cleavage be made\r\nbetween the Orthodox and the Reform wing of the synagogue. It was early\r\nfelt that some more secular bond must be found which should unite the\r\nJews of various persuasions for common and concerted action. The first\r\nattempt in this direction was nobly made by Narcisse Leven, Eugene\r\nEmanuel, Charles Netter, and a few others, in founding (1880) the\r\n“Alliance Israélite Universelle” in Paris, whose object it was to aid\r\nin removing Jewish disabilities wherever they might exist, and to raise\r\nthe spiritual condition of their coreligionists in Northern Africa,\r\nEastern Europe, and Western Asia by the founding of schools. From these\r\nsmall beginnings the Alliance has grown to be an important factor in\r\nthe conservation of Jewish interests. Faithful to its programme, it has\r\nestablished a large number of elementary and technical schools, and\r\nhas intervened actively in Algeria, Morocco, the Turkish Empire, and\r\nPersia whenever Jews or Jewish interests were in any way threatened.\r\nIts attempt, however, to represent the whole Jewish people has not\r\nbeen successful; for the reason that it has been allied too closely\r\nwith French national interests; and side by side with the “Alliance\r\nFrançaise” it has been an active propagandist of the French language\r\nand of French culture in the East. This one-sidedness of its work is\r\nbest seen in the fact that by its side similar organizations have\r\nbeen created in other countries, “The Board of Delegates of American\r\nIsraelites” in the United States, “The Anglo-Jewish Association” in\r\nEngland, “The Israeli-tisch Alliance” in Austria, and the “Deutsche\r\nGemeindebund” in Germany. At one time it was hoped that the B’nai\r\nB’rith, established in this country in 1843, by Isidor Busch,\r\nJulius Bien, and others, would form such a union of Jews, where the\r\ntheological differences would be eliminated. But though this order,\r\nwhich has 315 lodges in, the United States and Canada, has established\r\nitself in such countries as Germany, Roumania, Austria, Algeria,\r\nBulgaria, and Egypt, and despite the good work it has so far done, the\r\nmere fact that it is a secret organization prevents it from standing\r\nforth as the representative of international Jewry. Where, then, and\r\nin what manner is such a body to be found?\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe economic condition of the Jews in the large Eastern European\r\nGhettos is, naturally, extremely bad. Huddled together, either in\r\ncertain districts of large towns or in villages where they form the\r\ngreater part of the population, they are compelled to live off and\r\non each other. Crowded into certain walks of life by anti-Jewish\r\nlegislation or anti-Jewish sentiment, few of them can gain more than\r\nsufficient to keep body and soul together. In Galicia it has been\r\nestimated that five thousand Jews perish every year from typhus-fever.\r\nThe Jewish wax-miners in Boryslav, to take but one instance, were\r\nforced out of the mines and reduced to utter starvation, for no other\r\nreason but because they were Jews. The failure of the harvests in\r\nSouthern Russia during the last few years has reduced the wage-earners\r\nin that part of the country to the position of dependants upon the\r\ncharity of others; but the Jews who live there in such large numbers do\r\nnot even benefit from the assistance sent by the government. Similar\r\nconditions prevail almost continually in the rest of the Russian pale\r\nand in Roumania. The standard of life has naturally been lowered among\r\nthese people and their general _morale_ has not come out of the trial\r\nunscathed.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that the violent dislocation of hundreds of\r\nthousands of people, such as has taken place among the Jews during\r\nthe last quarter of the nineteenth century, has naturally disturbed\r\nexisting economic conditions, not only among the Jews themselves,\r\nbut also among those into whose midst they came. These outcasts from\r\nEastern Europe did not come to virgin soil as did the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nbut to cities and towns which were already filled with a proletariat\r\nengaged in the eager fight for life. The Jews of Berlin, Paris, London,\r\nand New York, had their hands full with the proper care of the needy\r\nones already in their midst.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the Jews as a people are rich. The\r\nproletariat among them is proportionately much larger than it is among\r\nother people; and thus it came about that the Jewish quarters in all\r\nthe large cities were already well filled when they were (almost at a\r\nmoment’s notice) called upon to receive double or triple the number\r\nthey already held. The actual number of the Jewish poor was thereby\r\ngreatly increased; for many a family that had been wealthy or in easy\r\ncircumstances in Russia, Galicia, or Roumania, had been reduced to want\r\nand been compelled to take its place among those who needed the help\r\nof their brethren. This help was freely and cheerfully given all the\r\nworld over. Great sacrifices were made by the richer Jews to meet the\r\npressing needs of the hour, and, with no help from the outside world,\r\nexcepting the London Mansion House Fund in 1882, the thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of immigrants were cared for. The Jewish charitable\r\norganizations, the development of which has been during the latter\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century the brightest spot in Jewish communal\r\nlife, rose to the demands of the occasion, and the more than princely\r\nmunificence of Baron and Baroness Maurice de Hirsch, in regard to the\r\nRussian Jews, may justly be looked upon with pride.\r\n\r\nNew Ghettos, however, were formed in nearly all the cities to which\r\nthese immigrants came; and this name for the habitat of the poorer\r\nJews became again familiar, aided by the popularity which some modern\r\nnovelists had given to it. In the Middle Ages and down to our own\r\ntime the Jews had been forced by the state to live apart in such\r\nGhettos; sometimes for their own protection, sometimes to preserve\r\nthe outside world from contact with them. The modern Ghetto is a\r\nvoluntary gathering of the Jews for the purpose of mutual help and\r\nfrom a feeling of reciprocal obligations. To the outside observer it\r\npresents an unsightly appearance; it is the abode of poor people, and\r\nits population is usually strange in dress, manners, and speech. The\r\nsweating system (which in one form or another is to be found in all\r\nthese Ghettos) has been a dreadful incentive towards grinding the face\r\nof the poor; and the results of too great a hoarding are often quite\r\napparent; so that the general morality of the Jews in these Ghettos\r\nhas suffered in consequence. A people ignorant of the language of\r\ntheir new home are a prey to the evil-intended, who make use of their\r\nignorance for their own commercial and political advancement. This has\r\nbeen notably seen in the city of New York, where a lax city government\r\nhas permitted the vampires of society to fasten their fangs upon the\r\nGhetto and to produce conditions which call for the active interference\r\nof all those forces which seek to stamp out crime and vice. But, on\r\nthe other hand, to one who is acquainted with the inner life of the\r\nGhetto the virtues which have hitherto characterized the Jews—industry\r\nand sobriety—are still to be found there; much more frequently than\r\nin those parts where the richer classes congregate, and whose wealth\r\nenables them to withdraw their doings from the public gaze. Its members\r\nare as industrious as bees in a hive; and though extremely litigatious,\r\ndrunkenness is unknown and actual crime is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nIn order to correct the abuses of the Ghetto, two things are absolutely\r\nnecessary—the increase of the actual number of Jews there must be\r\nstopped, and the crowding into certain distinct fields of work must\r\nbe brought to an end. A determined effort has already been made to\r\nforce the new immigrants into less crowded parts of the land to which\r\nthey come. In this country this is being done by the United Hebrew\r\nCharities, and notably by the B’nai B’rith. A distinct clannish feeling\r\nhas, however, to be overcome, and a fear of venturing into an unknown\r\ncountry where the immigrant will be surrounded by people who do not\r\nunderstand his peculiar social and religious customs.\r\n\r\nThat the Jew has taken by preference to certain branches of trade\r\nand work is due to the fact that anti-Jewish legislation has for\r\ncenturies closed many walks of life to him, and the guild organization\r\nexcluded him rigorously from many spheres of activity. Then, too,\r\nhis richly developed home life has induced a certain distaste for\r\noccupations which take the wage-earner out of his home and away from\r\nhis family. That, however, these inherited instincts can easily\r\nbe overcome is clearly seen whenever the occasion offers. Even in\r\nAmsterdam, where three-fourths of the diamond industry is in the\r\nhands of Jews, there are to be found Jewish cobblers, cigar-makers,\r\nplumbers, carpet-weavers, mattress-makers, watch-makers, etc. In\r\nthe East End of London there are, it is true, ten thousand Jews who\r\nare engaged in the clothes-making trades, but the rest of the forty\r\nthousand Jewish wage-earners of this quarter are scattered over all\r\npossible branches of work—masonry, metal-working, textile industries,\r\nfurniture-making, cap-making, and the like. The same is true of New\r\nYork, where, although the number of Jews employed in the tailoring\r\nindustries is disproportionately large, the following list of Hebrew\r\nunions shows how far afield the Jewish workman has gone: Cap-Makers,\r\nCap-Blockers, Shirt-Makers, Mattress-Makers, Purse-Makers, Liberty\r\nMusical Union, Jewish Chorus Union, Jewellers’ Union, Tin-Smithers’\r\nUnion, Bill-Posters, Waiters’ Alliance, Architectural Ironworkers,\r\nHebrew Typographical Union, Tobacco Cutters, Paper-Makers, Bookbinders.\r\nThe same is relatively true of all other countries where Jews live in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular misconception that the Jew has an innate distaste for\r\nagriculture. His continued commercial life, forced upon him for many\r\ncenturies, has, it is true, disaccustomed the Jew to the life of a\r\ntiller of the soil. But the Jewish state was largely an agricultural\r\none; the legislation of the Bible and the later Law Books was clearly\r\nintended for an agricultural people; and Jews have never shown an\r\nunwillingness to return again to the soil. In Southern Russia there are\r\nto-day 225 Jewish colonies with a population of 100,000. In Palestine\r\nthere are now more than twenty colonies with a population of more\r\nthan 5000, and similar agricultural colonies have been established\r\nat various times in the United States, Canada, and the Argentine\r\nRepublic. In many cases, it is true, these colonies have not yet\r\nbecome self-supporting, but this has been due in a large measure to\r\nmaladministration and to the peculiar conditions under which the\r\ncolonies were founded.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that a goodly part of the Jewish proletariat\r\nbelongs to the Socialist party. The whole Biblical system is in itself\r\nnot without a Socialist tinge; and the two great founders of the modern\r\nsystem, Lasalle and Marx, were Jews. It is no wonder that in Russia\r\nmany of the leading anarchists were of the Jewish race, for the Jew\r\nsuffered there from the evils which Nihilism was intended to correct\r\nten times more than did his fellow-Russian. But the Jew is by nature\r\npeace-loving; and under more favorable circumstances, and with the\r\nopportunity of a greater development of his faculties, Socialism in his\r\nmidst has no very active life; the Jew very soon becoming an ardent\r\npartisan of the existing state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThe facility with which the Jews attach themselves to changed\r\ncircumstances stands out characteristically through their whole\r\nhistory. It might, indeed, be said with some show of truth that this\r\npliability is the weak side in the Jewish character. The readiness of\r\nthe Jew to be almost anything and not simply his own self has been one\r\nof the factors producing a certain ill will against him. Disraeli was\r\nthe most jingo of all imperialists in England; Lasker, the most ardent\r\nadvocate of the newly constituted German Empire. This pliability is the\r\nresult of the wandering life he has led and the various civilizations\r\nof which he has been a part. He had to find his way into Hellenism\r\nin Alexandria, into Moorish culture in Spain, into Slavism in Russia\r\nand Poland. When the first wave of the modern spirit commenced to\r\nbreak from France eastward over the whole of Europe, it reached the\r\nJew also. While in France the new spirit was largely political, in\r\nGermany it was more spiritual. In its political form as well as in\r\nits spiritual form it reacted not only upon the political condition\r\nof the Jew, but especially upon his mental attitude. The new spirit\r\nwas intensely modern, intensely cosmopolitan, intensely Occidental,\r\nand intensely inductive. The Jew had preserved to a great degree his\r\ndeductive, Oriental, particularistic, and ancient mode of thought and\r\naspect of life. The two forces were bound to meet. As a great oak is\r\nmet by the storm, so was Israel set upon by the fury of this terrible\r\nonslaught. It is of interest to see in what manner he emerged from this\r\nstorm—whether he has been able to bend to its fury, to lose perhaps\r\nsome of his leaves and even some of his branches, but to change only\r\nin such a way as to be able to stand upright again when the storm is\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThis great clash of ideas has produced what is known as the Reform\r\nmovement. It had its origin in Germany under the spiritual influences\r\nof the regeneration of German letters produced by such men as Goethe,\r\nSchiller, Herder, Lessing, and Mendelssohn. It was aided in a large\r\nmeasure by the fact that the government in Germany, although distinctly\r\nopposed to anything which militates against the established order of\r\nthings, mixes itself very seldom in the internal affairs of the Jewish\r\ncommunities. This Reform movement has colored the religious development\r\nof Judaism during the three-quarters of the century which is past. The\r\nheat of the controversy is now wellnigh spent. Many of those who stood\r\nin the front ranks have passed away, so that a more just estimate of\r\nits value can be reached. It was a period of tremendous upheavals, of\r\ngreat physical as well as mental pain. Many a congregation was split\r\nin twain, many a family disrupted. At one time it looked as if two\r\ndistinct bodies of Jews would emerge from the struggle, and the union\r\nof Israel be destroyed forever. A common enemy—anti-Semitism—joined\r\nthe two forces together for a common defence; and the danger of such a\r\nsplit is now fairly a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the eighteenth century found the Jews of Middle\r\nEurope at the lowest intellectual and social point they had up till\r\nthen reached. The effect of the long Jewish Middle Ages was plainly\r\nvisible. Few great minds lit up the darkness, and an intellectual\r\ntorpor seems to have spread its pall over everything. A passive\r\nuniformity of practice prevailed in all the communities, whether\r\nSefardic (Spanish and Portuguese) or Ashkenazic (German and Polish); a\r\nuniformity, because actual intellectual life had been made to run in\r\none single groove. The Talmud had been the great saving of Judaism in\r\nthe past. In the intellectual exercise which its study necessitated,\r\nthe mind of the Jew had been given a field in which it could rove at\r\nwill. Living apart from the rest of the world, with a wide jurisdiction\r\nover his own affairs, Talmudic law in its latest development was still\r\nthe law supreme for the Jew. The Jewish Ghetto had everywhere the\r\nsame aspect; the language in common use was, in all the Ashkenazic\r\ncommunities, the Judæo-German in one of its various forms. A certain\r\nseverity in evaluating those things which were part of the outside\r\nworld made itself felt. There was ample time and ample occasion for the\r\npractice of all those forms and ceremonies with which the Judaism of\r\nthe Middle Ages had willingly and gladly fenced in the law. There had\r\nbeen little occasion for the practice of the beautiful arts or for the\r\ncultivation of letters. Life in the Ghetto was not necessarily gloomy,\r\nbut it was solemn. The law was not felt as a burden, but it required\r\nthe whole individual attention of those who bound themselves by it,\r\nfrom early morn till late at night, from the cradle to the grave. There\r\nwas no place for things that come from outside, because there was no\r\ntime to devote to them.\r\n\r\nBut the new European spirit in its French political form was knocking\r\nhard at the gates of the Ghetto. Little by little it made its way\r\nhere and there, into all sorts of nooks and corners. It was bound in\r\ntime to be heard by some of those living behind these gates. The name\r\nof Moses Mendelssohn is indissolubly connected with the history of\r\nGerman Judaism during the latter part of the eighteenth century. It\r\nwas due to him that a vehicle was found which the new spirit could\r\nuse. Himself a strictly observant Jew, he felt the pulse of the new\r\nera. The friend of Lessing and of Nicolai, he entered fully into the\r\nrevival which was then making itself felt. Through his translation of\r\nthe Pentateuch (1778, etc.) into High-German, he prepared the way for\r\nthe further introduction of German writings to the Jewish masses. This\r\nwas bound to bring with it a larger culture and a greater freedom of\r\nthought. Many of his friends, such as Wessely, Hertz-Homberg, and David\r\nFriedlander, stood by his side in this work. With the introduction\r\nof the German language and German literature, better and more modern\r\nschools were needed in which secular education should go hand in hand\r\nwith the former one-sided religious training. David Friedlander was the\r\nfirst to found a school in the modern sense of the term; and he was\r\nfollowed by Jacobson in 1801, at Seesen, Westphalia, and at Cassel,\r\nand by Johlson, at Frankfort, in 1814. Between the years 1783 and 1807\r\nsuch modern Jewish schools arose in Germany, Austria, Denmark, France,\r\nand even in Poland. Literature was cultivated, and the first Jewish\r\njournal (though still in Hebrew) was published in Königsberg, 1783\r\n(_Hameassef_—the Collector). The _Gesellschaft der Freunde_, founded\r\nin Berlin in 1792, was distinctly intended for the spread of this\r\nmodern culture; yet Mendelssohn’s own position was quite an untenable\r\none. He was a thoroughly Orthodox Jew in practice, but his mental\r\nattitude was that of a modern German. He was and he was not a reformer.\r\nHe held that it mattered little what philosophical position a Jew held,\r\nthe Jew must observe all the ceremonies connected with the faith; these\r\nwere binding upon him by the mere fact of his having been born into the\r\nCovenant. It is therefore no wonder that his translation was put under\r\nthe bann in Hamburg, Altona, Fuerth, Posen, etc. His friend Friedlander\r\nwished to make of the synagogue a sort of Ethical Culture Society;\r\nand Jacobson’s preaching in Berlin contained very little of what was\r\ndistinctly Jewish. The salons of Berlin, Königsberg, and Vienna,\r\nwhich were presided over by brilliant women, who were more or less\r\nimmediate disciples of Mendelssohn, nurtured the cosmopolitan spirit\r\nwhich was bound to be destructive of practical Judaism. That this fruit\r\non the Tree of Knowledge ripened too quickly is seen from the fact\r\nthat all the descendants of Mendelssohn, Friedlander, and others, led\r\nastray by this cosmopolitan spirit and the philosophic presentation of\r\nChristianity by Schleiermacher, have all become devoted members of the\r\nLutheran Church and have been completely lost to Judaism.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that these new influences should influence also the\r\ntraining of the modern rabbis. Secular education had been introduced\r\ninto primary schools, and in some places—as, for instance, Lombardy,\r\nin 1820—the government demanded a certain amount of secular knowledge\r\nfrom the candidates for rabbinical positions. The Jew also desired that\r\nhis leaders should have the same training as he gave his children, that\r\nthey should be educated in the same atmosphere in which he himself\r\nhad grown up. The old rabbinical seminaries, or Yeshibot, in which\r\nthe instruction was entirely on Talmudic lines, had already run their\r\ncourse; the study had been found insufficient by the pupils themselves,\r\nand the schools of Frankfort, Fuerth, Metz, Hamburg, and Halberstadt\r\nhad all been closed for want of students. The need of a modern seminary\r\nwas felt quite early during the century; and in 1809, a Lehrer-Seminar\r\nwas founded in Cassel. The earliest regular seminary for the training\r\nof rabbis, however, was founded in Padua in 1829. In Germany attempts\r\nhad been made in the year 1840, but these attempts were unsuccessful.\r\nThe first modern seminary was not founded in Germany until the year\r\n1854 (Breslau). Then followed Berlin, in 1872; Cincinnati, in 1873;\r\nBudapest, in 1876. Similar institutions exist now in London, Paris, and\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nIn the first convulsions of the Mendelssohn period the way was paved\r\nfor the second period of the Reform movement which covers the first\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century. The real issues touched the central\r\npoint of Jewish life, the synagogue. It is interesting to note that\r\nduring this period the chief questions were not so much theological as\r\næsthetic. The æsthetic side of life could not be largely cultivated in\r\nthe Ghetto; and the form of the service had greatly degenerated. In the\r\ncourse of centuries, so many additional prayers and songs and hymns had\r\nbeen added that the ritual was largely overburdened, and often tended\r\nrather to stifle than bring out the religious sense they were intended\r\nto conserve. Contact with the outside world created and fostered this\r\næsthetic sense, and the influences of the writings of such men as\r\nLessing and Mendelssohn was largely in this direction. As this æsthetic\r\nsense made its way into the homes, so also did it carve out its way\r\ninto the synagogue. Demands were heard for a shorter service; for the\r\norgan to accompany the chanting of the reader; for the German language\r\nin some of the prayers and for the German sermon. Each point was\r\nbitterly contested; for the Orthodox wing had before it the wholesale\r\napostasy of the Salon Jews. In order to introduce the vernacular into\r\nthe service and into the sermon, private synagogues were opened by\r\nsmall coteries in Cassel (1809), Seesen (1810), Dessau (1812), and\r\nBerlin (1815). In Southern Germany the use of the vernacular was\r\nintroduced between the years 1817 and 1818, also in Hungary through\r\nthe influence of Abraham Chorin. In some countries the government gave\r\nits active aid. In Vienna, in 1820, German was made obligatory, and\r\nas early as 1814 Danish in Copenhagen. The greatest changes, however,\r\nwere made in the Hamburg temple (under Kley and Salomon, 1818), where\r\nnot only the service was made more æsthetic and the German language\r\nintroduced, but certain prayers referring to the Messianic time were\r\neither omitted or altered. No wonder, then, that the Orthodox rabbis\r\nin Germany, with the support of the rabbis in various other countries,\r\nprotested against such a course. The government even looked askance\r\nat these Reform proceedings, and in 1817 and 1823 ordered a number of\r\nthese private synagogues to be closed. A further cause for displeasure\r\nwas the introduction in 1814 of the confirmation of children in German,\r\nto replace or supplement the old Barmitzvah, a clear imitation of the\r\nceremony in the Protestant Church of Germany. Despite opposition,\r\nhowever, the confirmation found its way into Berlin, Hamburg,\r\nFrankfort, Cassel, Copenhagen, etc.\r\n\r\nThis æsthetic revolution in the synagogue could not, however, long\r\nremain the only outward sign of the new life. The great weakness of\r\nthe Reform movement has been that it has lacked a philosophic basis;\r\nand, as in its first beginnings, with the exception of Hamburg, it took\r\nlittle note of the changed point of view from which those who fought\r\nfor reform looked at the old theological ideas. Æsthetic reform was the\r\nwork largely of individual persons and individual congregations. No\r\nattempt had been made either to formulate the philosophic basis upon\r\nwhich the reform stood, or to provide a body which should regulate the\r\nform which the new order of things was to take on. Two attempts were\r\nmade to remedy these evils, both closely related one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe first was crystallized in what is now known as the “Science of\r\nJudaism”; by which is meant the untrammelled, scientific investigation\r\nof the past history of the Jews. The want of this was severely felt\r\njust in those centres where reform had taken up its abode; and those\r\nwho assisted at its birth did so with the avowed purpose of getting\r\nat the real kernel of Judaism by such investigation, and of freeing\r\nthat kernel from the accretions of ages. They saw also that some means\r\nhad to be found by which the result of these researches could be\r\nbrought before the people. The Mendelssohn period had also felt this;\r\nbut its organ had been written in Hebrew, and could not, therefore,\r\nappeal to those who wished for the intellectual advancement of the\r\nJews upon modern lines. The Society for Culture and the Science of\r\nJudaism in Berlin (founded 1819) started a journal, with L. Zunz as\r\neditor. Though it only lived during the years 1822 and 1823, it was the\r\nforerunner and the model for many of its kind that followed after. In\r\n1835 appeared Geiger’s _Scientific Journal for Jewish Theology_, and in\r\n1837 a regular weekly was established by L. Philippson, the _Allgemeine\r\nZeitung des Judenthums_. Around these and other journals which quickly\r\nsprang up there gathered a coterie of historians, philologists, and\r\nstudents of literature which in the fifty years between 1830 and 1880\r\nhas built up a science which has extended its investigations into every\r\ncorner of Jewish life in the past, and has followed to their sources\r\nthe various lines of development which have appeared from time to\r\ntime. A full estimate of what has been done will be apparent only when\r\nthe great Jewish Encyclopædia will be ready which is now in course of\r\npublication in New York. Zunz, Geiger, Krochmal, Rapoport, Frankel,\r\nLöw, Steinschneider, Graetz, Luzzatto, and Reggio are only a few of\r\nthe names of those who gave up their lives to this work. Most of the\r\nearly labor of these men was not dry-as-dust investigation pure and\r\nsimple, but was intended to have a bearing upon the actual life, upon\r\nthe burning questions which were then agitating Jewish thought. This\r\nis clearly seen in the journal of which Zunz was editor, and in his\r\n_Gottesdienstliche Vortraege_, the basis of nearly all the work done\r\nafter him, but which was evidently written to give the history of\r\npreaching in the synagogue in order to justify the shortening of the\r\nritual and the introduction of the German sermon.\r\n\r\nThe second attempt was to found or create some central body which\r\nwould remove the purely personal element out of the Reform movement.\r\nIn 1837 Geiger had called his friends to a conference at Wiesbaden\r\nfor the purpose of formulating what they considered to be the essence\r\nof Judaism. In 1844 a second such rabbinical conference was held\r\nin Brunswick, largely at the suggestion of L. Philippson. Similar\r\nconferences were held at Frankfort in 1845, and at Breslau in 1846;\r\nfor in the mean time the Reform Genossenschaft had been created at\r\nBerlin, which went beyond all previous attempts and demanded some\r\npositive statement of the theological position which it and its friends\r\noccupied. The Frankfort assembly not proving satisfactory, the Berlin\r\nsociety went ahead to establish its own synagogue; added a Sunday\r\nservice (which in a short while became the only service), and under\r\nthe guidance of S. Holdheim definitely broke with traditional Judaism,\r\nremoving nearly all the Hebrew from its service, abbreviating the\r\nprayer-book still further, and diminishing the number of observances.\r\nIn Europe this Reform synagogue in Berlin has gone to the furthest\r\nextreme; and though it has in a measure kept its members within the\r\npale of Judaism, it has neither been a great power nor has it found\r\nimitators. The hope was generally expressed that a more general synod\r\nwould be held, to which the previous conferences were looked upon as\r\nsimply preparatory. The year 1848, however, put a stop to all normal\r\ndevelopment; and it was only after a number of years that the question\r\nwas again taken up. In 1869 a synod was, indeed, held at Leipsic,\r\nattended by eighty-one members; and in 1871 at Augsburg, attended\r\nby fifty-two, both under the presidency of Prof. M. Lazarus. These\r\nsynods dealt, in a spirit of moderate reform, with questions relating\r\nto the ritual, synagogue observance, the admission of proselytes,\r\netc. The general stand there taken would to-day be looked upon as\r\nconservative; dogmatic questions were hardly touched upon excepting\r\nso far as they recognized the principle of development in Judaism\r\nboth as a religious belief and as a form of religious exercise. It\r\nwas fondly hoped that these synods would become a court, which would\r\ndefine and regulate whatever questions might arise. But it was not\r\nto be. The synod represented only a part of the Jewish world even in\r\nGermany. Not only did the large body of the Orthodox stand aside, but\r\neven the so-called Conservatives left the conferences, as they could\r\nnot agree with some of the resolutions accepted there. In addition to\r\nthis, the Franco-Prussian war diverted the attention of all German\r\ncitizens; and ten years later the anti-Semitic movement succeeded in\r\ndriving the Jew back into himself. Jewish religious life in Germany\r\nhas therefore remained stationary since that time, the Orthodox and\r\nConservative parties being largely in the ascendant, leaving to another\r\nland—America—the task of carrying further the work which it had\r\ncommenced. Yet, in spite of this arrested development, the Reform\r\nmovement has had a great influence also upon Orthodox Jews in Germany.\r\nIt produced the so-called historical school, which has the Breslau\r\nTheological Seminary for its centre; and it called forth by way of\r\nopposition the neo-orthodoxy of S. R. Hirsch, of Frankfort, which seeks\r\nrather to understand the depths of the law than simply to follow it in\r\ncompliant obedience.\r\n\r\nThe æsthetic movement of the earlier period has also left its traces,\r\nand especially in the Conservative congregation has succeeded in\r\nintroducing a service more in consonance with our modern ideas of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, under the influence of the movement in Germany, the attempt\r\nwas made to introduce a certain reform in the service of some of the\r\nLondon synagogues. The measure demanded was exceedingly small—the\r\nshortening of a few prayers and the omission of others, which were not\r\nsupposed to be in consonance with present ideas. The Orthodox party\r\ndid not, however, see its way to grant these requests; and, when the\r\nReformers protested, established their own synagogue, and issued their\r\nown prayer-book, they were immediately placed under the bann both by\r\nthe Sefardim and the Ashkenazim. This congregation has not been of\r\nmuch importance, and since its inception has made no further changes.\r\nCompared with the Reform in America, the English movement would still\r\nbe classed as thoroughly conservative.\r\n\r\nIt was in the United States that the Reform movement developed its full\r\ncapacity and bore its most perfect fruit. In a new land, which was\r\nuntrammelled by traditions of the past, and where the congregational\r\nsystem became the basis of Jewish communal life, the ideas which the\r\nGerman Reformers had sown had a most fruitful ground in which to grow.\r\nIt cannot be said that the Reform movement here was actually started\r\nby the Germans, for already, in 1825, one of the congregations in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, made up almost entirely of Sefardic Jews,\r\nhad developed “The Reformed Society of Israelites”; and the formation\r\nof the society seems to have been due, not only to the demand for\r\nan æsthetic service, but to an attempt to formulate a creed which\r\nshould omit all reference to the coming of the Messiah, the return to\r\nPalestine, and the bodily resurrection. This attempt at formulating\r\na Theistic Church, however, was unsuccessful; and it was not until\r\nthe advent from Germany in the 50’s and 60’s of rabbis who had been\r\ninfluenced by the movement in Germany that reform commenced to make\r\nitself felt here. Merzbacher in New York, Isaac M. Wise in Albany and\r\nCincinnati, S. Hirsch in Philadelphia, David Einhorn in Baltimore,\r\nare only a few of the names of those who fought in the thick of\r\nthe fight. About the year 1843 the first real Reform congregations\r\nwere established, the Temple Emanu-el in New York and Har Sinai in\r\nBaltimore. It cannot be my purpose here to trace the history of the\r\nmovement in this country; suffice it to say that the untrammelled\r\nfreedom which existed here very soon played havoc with most of the\r\ninstitutions of the Jewish religion. Each congregation and each\r\nminister being a law to itself, shortened the service, excised prayers,\r\nand did away with observances as it thought best. Not that the leaders\r\ndid not try, from time to time, to regulate the measure of reform to\r\nbe introduced, and to evolve a platform upon which the movement should\r\nstand. Rabbinical conferences were held for that purpose in Cleveland\r\n(1856), Philadelphia (1869), Cincinnati (1871), and Pittsburg (1885).\r\nWhile in the earlier conferences the attempt was made to find some\r\nauthoritative statement upon which all parties could agree, in the\r\nsubsequent ones the attempt was given up. They became more and more\r\nmeeting-places simply for the advanced Reform wing of the Jewish\r\nChurch. The position of this wing of the Reformed synagogue may best\r\nbe seen in the declaration of principles which was published by the\r\nPittsburg conference. It declared that Judaism presents the highest\r\nconception of the God idea; that the Bible contains the record of the\r\nconsecration of the Jewish people; that it is a potent instrument\r\nof religious and moral instruction; that it reveals, however, the\r\nprimitive ideas of its own age; that its moral laws only are binding;\r\nand that all ceremonies therein ordained which are not adapted to\r\nthe views and habits of modern civilization are to be rejected; that\r\nall Mosaic and rabbinical laws regulating diet, priestly functions\r\nand dress, are foreign to our present mental state; that the Jews\r\nare no longer a nation, and therefore do not expect a return to\r\nPalestine; that Judaism is a progressive religion, always striving to\r\nbe in accord with the postulates of reason; that the belief in bodily\r\nresurrection, in the existence of a hell and a paradise, are to be\r\nrejected; and that it is the duty of Jews to participate in the great\r\ntask of modern times to solve on the basis of justice and righteousness\r\nthe problems presented by the transitions and evils of the present\r\norganization of society. Such a platform as this could not fail to\r\narouse intense opposition on the part of the Orthodox Jews, and to\r\nlose for the conference even some of its more conservative adherents.\r\nAs in Charleston, in 1825, a platform of Theism was here postulated,\r\nwhich was bereft of all distinctively Jewish characteristics, and which\r\npractically meant a breaking away from historic Judaism. This position\r\nof the advanced Reformers is also manifested in the stand which they\r\nhave taken in regard to the necessity of the Abrahamic covenant. At a\r\nmeeting of the Central Conference of American (Reformed) Rabbis, held\r\nat Baltimore in 1881, a resolution was passed to the effect that no\r\ninitiatory rite or ceremony was necessary in the case of one desiring\r\nto enter the Covenant of Israel, and that such a one had merely to\r\ndeclare his or her intention to worship the one sole and eternal God,\r\nto be conscientiously governed in life by God’s laws, and to adhere to\r\nthe sacred cause and mission of Israel as marked out in Holy Writ.\r\n\r\nThe service in Reform synagogues in the United States has kept pace\r\nwith this development of doctrine, or rather with this sloughing-off of\r\nso much that is distinctively Jewish. The observance of the second-day\r\nfestivals has been entirely abolished, as well as the separation of\r\nthe sexes and the covering of the head in prayer. The ritual has\r\nbeen gradually shortened, the ancient language of prayer (Hebrew)\r\nhas been pushed further and further into the background, so that in\r\nsome congregations the service is altogether English; and in a few\r\ncongregations an additional service on Sunday, intended for those who\r\ncannot attend upon the regular Sabbath-day, has been introduced. Only\r\none congregation, Sinai in Chicago, has followed the old Berlin Reform\r\nsynagogue and has entirely abolished the service on Friday night and\r\nSaturday morning. But whatever criticism one might like to offer on\r\nthe Reform movement in the United States, it deserves great praise\r\nfor the serious attempt it has made to understand its own position\r\nand to square its observance with that position. It has also been\r\nmost active in its modern institutional development. It has certainly\r\nbeautified and spiritualized the synagogue service; it has founded a\r\nUnion of American Hebrew Congregations, and a seminary (Hebrew Union\r\nCollege in Cincinnati). It has published a Union Prayer-book and a\r\nUnion Hymn-book, and has given great care to the development of the\r\nConfirmation and the bettering of the Sunday-school. It has tried to\r\nmake the synagogue a centre for the religious and spiritual development\r\nof its members; and it cannot be denied that the very large mass of\r\neducated Jews in this country, in so far as they have any affiliation\r\nwith the synagogue, belong to the Reform wing. But at the same time,\r\nit must not be forgotten that there is a very large body of Orthodox\r\nand Conservative Jews, whose number has been greatly increased during\r\nthe last twenty years through the influx of Russian, Galician, and\r\nRoumanian Jews. It would be outside of my province were I to attempt\r\nto criticise either the work or the results of Reform Judaism in\r\nthis country. But it is a question in the minds even of some of the\r\nleading Reformers themselves how far success has been attained in\r\ndeveloping the religious sentiment of their people in the direction of\r\na pure Theism uncolored by any Jewish, or, as they call it, Oriental\r\nobservances. They themselves confess that the Sunday-service movement\r\nhas not developed as they had hoped it would, and a number of them\r\nfeel that in weakening the hold which specific Jewish observances have\r\nalways had on the Jewish people, they are doing away with one of the\r\nmost powerful incentives to the rekindling of the religious flame among\r\nthe Reformed Jews.\r\n\r\nReform Judaism without some centrifugal force is bound to continue\r\non the road it has once taken. The logical outcome of the principles\r\nformulated at the Pittsburg conference is a gradual development into an\r\nethical Theism without any distinctive Jewish coloring. The leader of\r\nadvanced Reform Judaism in this country has recently said that Judaism\r\nmust be recast along the lines of a universal ethical religion; that\r\nthen all distinctive Jewish elements of the synagogue symbolism will\r\npass away, and that such a denationalized Jewish temple will seek a\r\ncloser alliance with Unitarianism and Theism, and with them, perhaps\r\nin a few decades, will form a new Church and a new religion for united\r\nhumanity. That such a tendency is inherent in Reform Judaism is seen\r\nalso in the formation of the Society of Ethical Culture in New York.\r\nThe leader of this movement is the son of a former prominent rabbi of\r\nthe leading Reform congregation in this country. In seeking to bring\r\nout the underlying ethical principles of Judaism, he has gone entirely\r\noutside the pale of the ancient faith; and the movement would not\r\nconcern us here were it not that nearly all the members (at least of\r\nthe parent society in New York) are Jews, whose evident desire it is\r\nnot to be recognized as such, at least so far as religious ceremonies\r\nand social affiliations are concerned. The society does not even\r\nbear the name Jewish, but with a certain leaning towards liberal\r\nChristianity tries to find a basis for the morality and ethics of\r\nthe old synagogue outside the sphere of supernatural religion. While\r\nthe Ethical Culture Society has been quite a power in certain lines\r\nof charitable and educational work, it may reasonably be questioned\r\nwhether it has any future as a form of Church organization. The inborn\r\nlonging of man for some hold upon things which are supernatural will\r\nlead many of its members to seek satisfaction elsewhere. That they will\r\nseek it in the Jewish synagogue is hardly probable, seeing how the\r\nracial and other ties have been broken or at least greatly loosened.\r\nThey or their children will glide rather into some form of the dominant\r\nChurch, possibly, in the swinging of the pendulum, into some orthodox\r\nform of that Church. I cannot help quoting the words of an intelligent\r\noutside observer of the Jewish question, the Right Hon. James Bryce,\r\nM. P.: “If Judaism becomes merely Theism, there will be little to\r\ndistinguish its professors from the persons, now pretty numerous, who,\r\nwhile Christian in name, sit loose to Christian doctrine. The children\r\nof Jewish theists will be almost as apt as the children of other\r\ntheists to be caught up by the movement which carries the sons and\r\ndaughters of evangelical Anglicans and of Nonconformists towards, or\r\nall the way to, the Church of Rome.”\r\n\r\nWhere, then, is this centrifugal force to be found, which will\r\nhold together the various elements in Israel, no matter what their\r\ntheological opinions may be?\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-SEMITISM\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to answer this question, a word must be said in\r\nregard to the anti-Semitic movement, the recrudescence of which has\r\nso profoundly affected the Jewish people during the last twenty years\r\nof the nineteenth century. A word only, because the facts are of too\r\nrecent date to need a detailed statement here. The great master-mind,\r\nZunz, writing in Germany in 1832, believed that persecution for\r\nreligious belief could not withstand the onslaughts of the new era.\r\nTheodore Reinach, some fifty years later, asserted that anti-Semitism\r\nwas impossible in France. How sadly has a _démenti_ been given to the\r\nhopes thus expressed, especially in these two countries!\r\n\r\nI pass over the outbreaks against the Jews during the early years of\r\nthe nineteenth century, even the Damascus blood-accusation in 1840,\r\nand the forcible baptism of little Edgar Mortara in 1858; they were\r\nbelieved to belong to the old order of things, with which the new,\r\nat least in that direction, had nothing in common. I confine myself\r\nsimply to the modern form of anti-Judaism, which has been dignified\r\nwith the name of anti-Semitism. It is hard for a Jew to speak of these\r\nthings with composure or with the judicial mind of a mere chronicler\r\nof events. Neither emancipation from without nor Reform from within\r\nhas been able to stay the hand of the destroyer of Israel’s peace.\r\nIt has been contended that in most countries the Jews were not ready\r\nto be emancipated; that in some the non-Jewish population was not\r\nsufficiently advanced to make emancipation effective. The first may\r\nbe true in regard to the Algerian Jews; the second, in regard to\r\nthose in Roumania; but it is not true of the other nations on the\r\nEuropean continent. Starting in Germany, perhaps as a political move\r\non the part of Bismarck, it spread into Russia, Galicia, Austria,\r\nRoumania, and France. In most of these countries it not only found\r\nexpression in the exclusion of the Jews from all social intercourse\r\nwith their fellows, but in Russia produced the riots of 1881 and 1882;\r\nin Austria and Bohemia the turbulent scene in the Reichstag, and even\r\nthe pillaging of Jewish houses and Jewish synagogues; in Roumania\r\nit received the active support of the government and reduced the\r\nJews there to practical penury; while in France it showed itself in\r\naccusations against the Jews which for barbarity could match any that\r\nwere brought against them in the Middle Ages. The charges against the\r\nJews are varied in their character. In Germany they have been blamed\r\nfor exploiting the agricultural class and for serving the interests\r\nof the Liberal party, forgetting that Leo and Stahl, the founders of\r\nthe Orthodox party in Prussia, were themselves Jews, and that Disraeli\r\nin England was born of the same race. The most foolish accusations\r\non almost every conceivable subject have been lodged against them by\r\nsuch men as Ahlwart, Stöcker, Lueger, and Drumont; and in late years\r\nthe old and foolish charge that the Jews use the blood of Christian\r\nchildren in the making of Passover bread has been revived, in order to\r\ninfuriate the populace; despite the fact that popes, ecclesiastics,\r\nand hosts of Christian professors have declared the accusation to be\r\npurely imaginary and malignant. The false charge that a Jewish officer\r\nin France had betrayed secrets of his government was sufficient to\r\nunloosen the most savage attacks upon the Jews which the modern world\r\nhas seen.\r\n\r\nThe fact which stands out in the whole agitation is not that the\r\ncharges have been made, in most cases by men who sought in some way\r\nor other to fish in troubled waters, but that these charges find\r\na ready echo and a ready response among the people at large. It\r\nemphasizes so clearly that the Jews are a defenceless people, with\r\nno means of effectually warding off attacks; and though in Germany\r\nand Austria societies of Christians have been formed for the purpose\r\nof combating anti-Semitism, there is no power which can effectually\r\nenter the lists in their behalf. This was notably seen in the great\r\nLondon demonstration of 1882, when the petition signed by the foremost\r\nmembers of Church and state never even reached the Czar, to whom it was\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nAmong the few bright spots on the world’s chart are those countries\r\ninhabited by the Anglo-Saxon race. Anti-Semitism is unknown in England\r\n(though the attempt has been made to fix the blame for the Boer war on\r\nthe Jews); and the institutions of the United States have up till now\r\nprevented the entrance here of the disease, though in the mild form of\r\nsocial anti-Semitism which debars Jewish children from private schools\r\nand Jewish people from clubs and summer hotels, it has insinuated\r\nitself into some of the Eastern cities, notably into New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nZIONISM\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that next to the Reform movement the profoundest\r\nmodification of the forces within Judaism has come about during the\r\nlast years of the century through the rise and progress of the Zionist\r\nmovement. It has been said by some that Zionism is the expression of\r\nJewish pessimism, by others that it is the highest form of Jewish\r\noptimism. I venture to say that it is both. The emancipation of the\r\nJews has not been able to do away with anti-Semitism; history has\r\nrepeated itself time and time again. When the Jews of a country were\r\nfew in number and of little influence, they led a tolerably secure\r\nexistence; but as soon as their number increased and their influence\r\ncommenced to be felt, anti-Semitism was the effective weapon in the\r\nhands of their opponents. In so far, then, as Zionism takes account\r\nof this fact, it is pessimistic; for conditions in the future will\r\nhardly differ from those in the past. It sees the Wandering Jew of\r\nhistory continuing still his dreary march through the ages, never at\r\nrest and never able to effect a quiet and even development of his own\r\nforces. It explains this phenomenon from the fact that Israel has in\r\nall the changed circumstances striven to maintain its racial identity,\r\nand as this racial identity has a religious side as well, that the\r\ntwo combined may well be called a separate national existence; that a\r\npeople holding tenaciously to this separate existence, but having no\r\nhome of its own, must become, when occasion demands, the scape-goat\r\nand the play-ball of other forces. It recognizes anti-Semitism as\r\ncontinually existent, and in so far the opponents of Zionism may\r\nbe right in saying that its rise is the result of the anti-Jewish\r\nmovement. It is the Jewish answer from the Jewish point of view. On\r\nthe other hand, Zionism is optimistic in believing that real help for\r\nthe Jews can only come from within their own body; and that the Jewish\r\nquestion will only be solved when the Jews return to that point in\r\ntheir history whence they set out on their wanderings, and again found\r\na permanent home to which all the persecuted can flee and from which a\r\nlight will go forth to every nook and corner of Jewry. It does not hope\r\nthat all Jews will return to Palestine, but it believes that only in a\r\nnational centre can the centrifugal force be found which will hold the\r\nJews together in the various countries of their sojourn.\r\n\r\nWhen Theodore Herzl, a _littérateur_ in Vienna, published in 1897 his\r\npamphlet on the Jewish state, he little imagined that it would call\r\nforth an echo in every country in which the Jews were scattered. He\r\nwas not the first to attempt this solution of the problem. Far-seeing\r\nRussian Jews before him had, many years previous to that, propounded\r\nthis method of dealing with the question, and it had been practically\r\nthe assumption upon which the Judaism of the past had been built up.\r\nReform Judaism, in relinquishing the hope of a return, and in cutting\r\nout from the prayer-book all mention of Palestine and the restoration,\r\nbroke one of the strongest links which bound the Judaism of to-day with\r\nthat of the past, and cast aside a great ideal, the realization of\r\nwhich had been a light to the feet of the Jews since the destruction of\r\nthe Temple. The idea of a “Mission” has taken its place, the preaching\r\nof a pure Monotheism.\r\n\r\nThe Zionist congresses (which have now been held during four successive\r\nyears) have found the platform, so often sought for in vain during the\r\nnineteenth century, upon which all Jews, regardless of theological\r\nopinions and of economic theories, can stand. They represent the old\r\nunity of Israel; for Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and even the\r\npurely racial Jew are to be found there as well as in the Zionist\r\nsocieties which have grown up in every Jewish community, whether in\r\nEurope or in Africa, in North or in South America, even in the distant\r\nPhilippines. The Orthodox Jew must be, by his very profession, a\r\nZionist; but he often doubts whether the plan as formulated by Dr.\r\nHerzl is feasible, and holds himself aloof, waiting for the realization\r\nof his hopes at the hands of others, or for some supernatural sign of\r\ndivine assistance. The very fact that the Jewish opponents of Zionism\r\n(and they are the only opponents it has) come from various parts of the\r\nJewish camp is in itself a proof of the above statement. The Orthodox\r\ncomplain that some of the leaders of the movement are not sufficiently\r\nJewish; the Reform, that some are too Jewish. That this opposition\r\nis exceedingly strong cannot be denied. The demand made that the Jew\r\nshould assert himself first and foremost as a Jew has been distasteful\r\nto many who were soaring in the mystic hazes of Universalism, or who\r\nhad hoped to get out of Judaism as it were by the back door, without\r\nbeing seen by the world at large.\r\n\r\nBut even in those circles which do not formally affiliate with\r\nZionism, or who at times even oppose it, there has of late years been a\r\nvery strong revival of Jewish feeling and a movement towards a stronger\r\nexpression of that feeling. Germany is honeycombed with societies for\r\nthe study of Jewish literature; the Hebrew language has been revived,\r\nnotably in Russia, not only as a form of literary expression, but also\r\nas a vehicle of social intercourse; France has its Society of Jewish\r\nStudies; America and England have their Jewish Historical Societies,\r\nand their Jewish Chautauqua movements; Jewish national societies have\r\nsprung up among the students of German and Austrian universities—all\r\ninfluences—tending in this one direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY\r\n\r\nAs we look ahead into the century which is now opening and cast our eye\r\nover the forces which the Jews will bring into its life, we can easily\r\nsee that these forces tend in various directions.\r\n\r\nWe have first the Orthodox wing of the Jewish Church, which stands\r\nupon the broad basis of what the past has evolved. It holds firmly\r\nto the inspiration of the biblical word and the divine character\r\nof its interpretation as handed down in the oral law; it tries to\r\nregulate its life by Talmudic ordinances as evolved in the latest\r\nlaw books, and is unwilling to make any but æsthetic concessions to\r\nchanged circumstances, believing that we must adhere strictly to all\r\nthe time-honored ceremonies of the synagogue. At its side stand the\r\nConservatives, who are willing to make some concession to present\r\ndemands, but believe that these concessions should be most sparingly\r\nand grudgingly made, and who theologically, at least in theory,\r\noccupy the same position as do the Orthodox. It is safe to say that\r\nthe greater number of Jews in the Western European states belong to\r\nthis wing of the synagogue. Between the Conservatives and the Ethical\r\nCulturists stands the Reform party, more numerous in the United States\r\nthan anywhere else, whose position it is hard to define and in whose\r\nmidst there are various shades of opinion and of practice. All the\r\nReformers have openly or tacitly broken with Talmudic Judaism—the\r\nmore conservative among them seem to believe that a new Judaism can be\r\nbuilt up upon the Bible, only without its traditional interpretation;\r\nwhile the advanced body do not even look upon the Bible as binding,\r\nbut merely as a starting-point for a further development. They do not\r\nconsider the Bible as inspired in the old accepted sense of the term;\r\nthey welcome biblical criticism as an aid to the understanding of the\r\nearly history of their people; they do not believe in the special\r\nelection of Israel, and have a well-defined abhorrence of anything\r\nlike a creed. They are practically Theists with a Jewish racial\r\ncoloring. Nor do they believe in the coming of a personal Messiah;\r\nrather, in the advent of a Messianic time in which righteousness and\r\ngood-will shall prevail and all the earth acknowledge the one God.\r\nTo bring about this time is, according to them, the Mission of the\r\nJew—a phrase very current in these latter days, the fulfilling of\r\nwhich has been made the pretext for dejudaizing Judaism, so as to\r\nmake it acceptable to non-Jews. Mr. Oswald John Simon, of London, has\r\neven gone further. He believes that if the Reform party is earnest in\r\nits pretensions, it ought—as it did once before in its history—to\r\nbecome an active missionary power. A few years ago he attempted to\r\nfound a Jewish Theistic Church, which should in no way be colored by\r\nJewish ceremonial. The movement was, of course, a failure. The original\r\nattempt, some nineteen hundred years ago, led to the founding of the\r\nChristian Church, and Jews themselves have suffered too much from\r\nmissionaries of other faiths to take to this work with pleasure.\r\nBut, in addition to these, there is also a large body of Jews whose\r\nconnection with the synagogue is purely nominal, and who know of it\r\nonly when they need the services of its sanction or the respectability\r\nof its connections. The hold which the Jewish Church has upon them is\r\nsmall indeed, and many of them hope, in the twentieth century, to doff\r\ntheir Jewish gaberdine. The open or concealed pressure of anti-Semitism\r\n(particularly on the continent of Europe) which makes it impossible for\r\nthe Jew as such to attain to social distinction or political position\r\nwill drive most of these into the arms of the dominant Church of the\r\ncountry in which they live. In a remarkable article published in the\r\n_Deutsche Jahrbücher_ of October, 1900, a writer who uses the _nom\r\nde plume_ of Benedictus Levita openly urges those of his fellow-Jews\r\nwho have become estranged from the synagogue to have their children\r\nbaptized, in order that they may not suffer as their parents have,\r\nbut may become really believing Christians, since their affiliation\r\nwith the Christian Church has become necessary in the modern Christian\r\nstate. Another German Jew at about the same time advises his brethren\r\nto declare themselves “Confessionslos,” so as to become lost, not in\r\nChristianity, but in “Deutschtum.” A similar request was made to the\r\nJews of Roumania, in 1900, by the historian Xenopol of Bucharest. There\r\nis little fear that this advice of wholesale apostasy will find many\r\nadherents, notwithstanding the fact that an unusually large number\r\nof conversions have taken place in Germany and Austria, due wholly\r\nto pressure from without rather than to conviction from within. The\r\ndefection even of comparatively large numbers can, however, hardly\r\naffect the Jewish cause as a whole; for these numbers living on the\r\nperiphery, or even beyond it, have been of little service to the Jewish\r\ncause; and all through the ages Jews have made just such contributions\r\nas these to the general society in which they lived.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Zionism is a strong protest against these\r\nweaklings, and that the coming century will witness the Jews divided\r\ninto two camps not necessarily hostile to each other, the Zionists and\r\nthe Non-Zionists—those who plead for a conservation of the old energy\r\nand the old ideals, and those who look forward to the disintegration of\r\nJudaism and its gradual passing away into other forces. That Judaism\r\ncan only conserve its force if that force is attached to a racial\r\nand national basis is seen clearly in the fact that just those Jews\r\nin Germany who have been most loudly clamorous against the Zionists\r\npropose to have now what they call a German “Judentag,” which can\r\ncertainly mean nothing unless it become Zionist in its tendency.\r\n\r\nConfident in this hope, we of the House of Israel look calmly into\r\nthe future. The message of the prophet of old is full of meaning for\r\nus: “Thus saith the Lord God: behold I, even I, will both search my\r\nsheep and seek them out, as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the\r\nday that he is among his flock which is scattered, and I will deliver\r\nthem out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy\r\nand dark day.” We can echo the sentiments expressed by a Christian\r\nZionist, George Eliot, many years ago: “Revive the organic centre;\r\nlet the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its\r\nreligion be an outward reality. Looking towards a land and a polity,\r\nour dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity\r\nof a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East\r\nand the West—which will plant the wisdom and skill of our race so\r\nthat it may be, as of old, a medium of transmission and understanding.\r\nLet that come to pass, and the living warmth will spread to the\r\nweak extremities of Israel, and superstition will vanish, not in the\r\nlawlessness of the renegade, but in the illumination of great facts\r\nwhich widen feeling and make all knowledge alive as the young offspring\r\nof beloved memories.”\r\n\r\n            RICHARD J. H. GOTTHEIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE-THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of religion during the past century may be described as the\r\nsequel of that dissolution of the mediæval faith which commenced at the\r\nReformation. The vast process of disintegration proceeds by degrees, is\r\nvaried by reactionary effort, and gives birth to new theories in its\r\ncourse. In our day the completion of the process and a new departure\r\nseem to be at hand. A sharp line cannot be drawn at the beginning of\r\nthe last century, the leaders of religious thought in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries having been to a great extent the leaders, and\r\ntheir works the text-books, of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nAt the Reformation Protestantism threw off the yoke of Pope and priest,\r\npriestly control over conscience through the confessional, priestly\r\nabsolution for sin, and belief in the magical power of the priest as\r\nconsecrator of the Host, besides the worship of the Virgin and the\r\nsaints, purgatory, relics, pilgrimages, and other incidents of the\r\nmediæval system. Ostensibly, Protestantism was founded on freedom of\r\nconscience and the right of private judgment. In reality, it retained\r\nChurch authority over conscience in the shape of dogmatic creeds and\r\nordination tests. It besides enforced belief in the plenary inspiration\r\nof the Bible, by which the exercise of private judgment was narrowly\r\nconfined. Not for some time did it even renounce persecution. In grimly\r\nCalvinistic Scotland a boy was hanged for impugning the doctrine of the\r\nTrinity at the end of the seventeenth century. The Anglican Church,\r\nsuspended by the will of the Tudor sovereigns between Catholicism and\r\nProtestantism, oscillated from side to side, producing by one of its\r\noscillations the great civil war. It burned heretics in the reign of\r\nJames I. All the Protestant Churches except the Baptists, who at first\r\nwere objects of persecution, fell under the dominion of the state,\r\nwhich repaid them for their submission and support by endowments,\r\ntemporal privileges, and persecution of dissent.\r\n\r\nThough Protestantism produced a multitude of sects, especially in\r\nEngland at the time of the Commonwealth, hardly any of them were\r\nfree-thinking or sceptical; those of any importance, at all events,\r\nwere in some sense dogmatic and were anchored to the inspiration of the\r\nBible. Nor is it easy to convict Hobbes, bugbear of the orthodox as he\r\nwas, of scepticism or even of heterodoxy. The expression of heterodox\r\nopinions, indeed, would have been a violation of his own principle,\r\nwhich makes religion absolutely an affair of the state, to be regulated\r\nby a despotic government, and confines liberty to the recesses of\r\nthought. It is true that in making religion a political institution,\r\nvariable at a despot’s will, he covertly denied that it was divine.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration religious thought and controversy slept. The\r\nnation was weary of those subjects. The liberty for which men then\r\nstruggled was political, though with political liberty was bound up\r\nreligious toleration, which achieved a partial triumph under William\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Rome, to meet the storm, reorganized herself at the\r\nCouncil of Trent on lines practically traced for her by the Jesuit. A\r\ncomparison of Suarez with Thomas Aquinas shows the change which took\r\nplace in spirit as plainly as a comparison of the Jesuit’s meretricious\r\nfane with the Gothic churches shows the change in religious taste.\r\nPapal autocracy was strengthened at the expense of the episcopate,\r\nand furnished at once with a guard and a propagandist machinery\r\nof extraordinary power in the Order of Loyola. That the plenary\r\ninspiration of the Bible in the Vulgate version, and including the\r\nApocrypha, should be reaffirmed was a secondary matter, inasmuch as the\r\nChurch of Rome holds that it is not she who derives her credentials\r\nfrom Scripture, but Scripture which depends for the attestation of\r\nits authority upon her. She now allied herself more closely than\r\nbefore with the Catholic kings, with Philip II., and afterwards with\r\nLouis XIV., who paid her for her support of political absolutism\r\nby sanguinary persecution of heretics. She hereby parted with her\r\nHildebrandic supremacy over the powers of the world, though she did\r\nnot, like the Anglican Church, recognize the divine right of kings.\r\nThe liberal and peace-making movements which had been set on foot, or\r\nwere afterwards set on foot, within her pale, such as the Oratory of\r\nDivine Love, which held justification by faith and wished to compromise\r\nwith the Protestants, were effectually put down. Jansenism, when it\r\nappeared, with its half-Calvinistic theory of Grace, shared the same\r\nfate. Gallicanism afterwards, having nationality to back it, was more\r\nsuccessful. But it brought no freedom of conscience; it was merely a\r\nrepartition of the despotic power over conscience between the King and\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, and for the most part in Italy, Rome, by the aid of\r\nthe Jesuit and the Inquisition, completely succeeded in killing\r\nfree-thought. In France, where there was no Inquisition, her triumph\r\nwas not so complete. She succeeded only in driving scepticism into\r\ndisguise and subterfuge. The Commonwealth of Holland did France and the\r\nworld in general the immense service of affording a printing house for\r\nfree-thought which was on the confines of France, but beyond the reach\r\nof the French government. Descartes, without directly assailing the\r\nfaith of the Church, planted in her face the standard of thorough-going\r\nreason and entitled himself to a place in the Index. Growing sensuality\r\nand love of pleasure brought with them laxity of belief and impatience\r\nof priestly control. The authority of the clergy was impaired by\r\ntheir scandalous wealth and vice, which at the same time enhanced the\r\nodium of their persecuting tyranny. At last came Voltaire, Diderot,\r\nthe _Encyclopædia_, and Rousseau. With literary cleverness unmatched\r\nand an incomparable genius for subtle attack, combined with a winning\r\nphilanthropy, Voltaire converted and drew into the work of demolition,\r\nto them suicidal, the thrones of Louis XV., or rather of the Pompadour,\r\nof Catherine, and Frederick. The influence extended even to Spain,\r\nwhere Aranda, and to Portugal, where Pombal reigned. The Pope was\r\nconstrained to dissolve the Order of Jesus. As Voltaire demolished in\r\nthe name of Reason, Rousseau demolished in the name of Nature, taking\r\nan artificial society by storm. Helvétius went to the length of extreme\r\nmaterialism; but Voltaire, the master-spirit of the movement, remained\r\na theist, and Rousseau was even for compulsory theism as the foundation\r\nof the state. The Revolution also, when it came, though violently and\r\nprofanely anti-Christian, was in the main theist, and in the midst\r\nof the Terror held its Feast of the Supreme Being, with Robespierre\r\nfor high priest. Atheism, in the persons of Chaumette and Anacharsis\r\nClootz, went to the guillotine.\r\n\r\nOne hardly knows what to say about the _Last Will and Testament_\r\nof Jean Meslier, the priest who after thirty years’ service as a\r\ncountry curé bequeathed to his parishioners a profession of atheism.\r\nThe work appears to have passed through the hands of Voltaire. It\r\nurges the arguments against natural theology in a very forcible as\r\nwell as thorough-going way. But it seems, when it appeared, to have\r\nmade little impression and can be mentioned historically only as an\r\nindication of the masked ferment of the time.\r\n\r\nEngland had a series of deists, Toland, Tindal, Collins, Chubb,\r\nand the rest, not men of much mark, though seekers of truth after\r\ntheir measure and in their day. The ecclesiastical polity of England\r\nwas comparatively mild, and there was nothing to provoke indignant\r\nresistance to clerical tyranny like that which was provoked by the\r\ncases of Calas and LaBarre. Shaftesbury, a deist of a higher stamp,\r\nwas, with his “moral taste,” a philosopher for men of taste, and could\r\nlittle stir the common world. In defence of orthodoxy came forth\r\nBishop Butler, with a work which will be memorable forever as a model\r\nof earnest and solemn inquiry into the deepest questions, though\r\nits fundamental assumption is unwarrantable, since we should expect\r\nthe difficulties of natural theology not to be reproduced but to be\r\ndispelled by revelation. Butler’s tone in discussion was an effective\r\nrebuke to those who had treated Christianity with levity as an obsolete\r\ninterference with the pleasures of the world. His profound analysis of\r\nthe moral nature of man in like manner rebuked the shallow and cynical\r\ntheories which resolved everything into self-love; though here again\r\nhis assumption of the authority of conscience as a divinely implanted\r\nmonitor has by modern investigation been disallowed. Butler, however,\r\nwith all his piety and his orthodox conclusions, must essentially be\r\nreckoned among rationalists. He frankly admits that the use of our\r\nreason is the only means we have of arriving at truth, never appealing\r\nfrom it to Church authority. He who recognizes reason as supreme must\r\nbe deemed rationalist, let his own reason lead him or mislead him as it\r\nmay. This is the vital line of cleavage which runs through the whole\r\nreligious history and divides the religious world at the present day.\r\n\r\nButler had a popular shield-bearer in Paley, an extremely acute and\r\neffective though not profound writer. Paley’s supposed proof of the\r\nexistence of an intelligent Creator from the design visible in creation\r\ntold greatly at the time and long continued to tell; though we now\r\nsee that the universe, unlike the watch, presents terrible proofs of\r\nundesign as well as apparent proofs of design; not to mention that in\r\nthe case of the universe, though adaptation is visible, the aim is not\r\nrevealed. Paley’s _Horae Paulinae_, however, is about the only piece of\r\nhistorical apologetics which has in any degree survived the destructive\r\ninfluence of modern criticism.\r\n\r\nWarburton hardly calls for mention. In his _Divine Legation_ he is\r\nright enough in saying that Moses did not teach the immortality of the\r\nsoul; but the notion that the Mosaic dispensation must have had divine\r\nsupport because it could afford to dispense with that doctrine would\r\nnow only provoke a smile.\r\n\r\nAmong literary apologists we can scarcely reckon Johnson. Yet he was a\r\nliving defence, intellectual as well as moral, of his religion. That\r\nhe speculated, we cannot doubt, and we know that he was not satisfied\r\nwith the proofs of the immortality of the soul; but he suppressed\r\ndoubt in himself and frowned it down in others. He was well justified\r\nin treating with contempt the posthumous works of Bolingbroke, which\r\nhave not the slightest force or value beyond their literary form.\r\nBolingbroke’s scepticism, however, had a certain effect if it inspired\r\nPope’s _Universal Prayer_.\r\n\r\nIn Hume, on the other hand, we have the mightiest of all sceptics in\r\nthe literal sense of the term, inasmuch as he was purely a doubter\r\nand seems hardly to have felt the desire of arriving at any positive\r\nresult. He who has given rise to so much controversy was himself\r\nuncontroversial. His writings, considered as the vehicle of his\r\nopinions, are the perfection of literary art. Over common minds the\r\nteacher who merely suspends judgment, seeming not to be in quest of\r\npositive truth, can never have much influence; but Hume had great\r\ninfluence over cultivated men of the world. His argument against the\r\ncredibility of miracles, though it became as standard on one side\r\nas Paley’s apologue of the watch upon the other, will hardly bear\r\nexamination. Assuming the existence of God and His care for man as His\r\nwork, which Hume does not openly deny, there is no presumption against\r\nHis revelation of Himself in the only conceivable way, which is by\r\nan interruption of the general course of things; there is rather a\r\npresumption that He would so reveal Himself. Nor can it be maintained\r\nthat no degree of evidence, say that of a multitude of scientific\r\nmen, after providing all possible safeguards against deception, would\r\nsatisfy us of the fact.\r\n\r\nGibbon’s great work is instinct with the tendency of men of the world\r\nin the generation of Voltaire, Horace Walpole, and Hume. Its spirit\r\nis identical with that of Hume’s philosophy and history. It is of\r\nfirst-rate importance in the religious controversy as having opened\r\nthe trenches historically against revealed religion in undertaking to\r\naccount for the success of Christianity by natural causes. But its\r\ncynical treatment of that which, on any hypothesis, was the prevailing\r\nand formative force is unphilosophical and detracts largely from the\r\nvalue of the work. He who could imagine that man had been happiest in\r\nthe Roman Empire under the Antonines was an apt partisan of Lord North.\r\nGibbon no doubt imagined himself a rich patrician of his golden era.\r\nWould he have liked to be a Roman slave? Conyers Middleton in his _Free\r\nInquiry_ into the ecclesiastical miracles glanced at the credibility of\r\nthe Gospel miracles and had thus partly paved the way for Gibbon.\r\n\r\nAmong the disintegrating forces may be counted Unitarianism, which was\r\ngrowing among thinkers, and probably before very long became the mask\r\nfor profounder scepticism in Protestant Europe as it did afterwards in\r\nNew England. We find it in England on the eve of the French Revolution,\r\ncombined with science in Priestley and with mathematics and philosophy\r\nin Price.\r\n\r\nAmong the apologetic and defensive forces may be numbered the\r\npractical vindication of Christianity by a certain revival of piety\r\nin the Anglican Church which produced Wilberforce, Cowper, and the\r\nEvangelicals, and still more by the religious crusade of John Wesley.\r\nWesley’s achievements, however, were among the poor and illiterate, and\r\nwere consequently demonstrations of the power of Christianity rather\r\nthan of its truth. His Church had the advantage of being born, not like\r\nother Protestant Churches in doctrinal controversy, but in evangelical\r\nreaction against the impiety and vice of the age. It was, however,\r\nnot undogmatic; besides what might be called the dogma of sudden\r\nconversion, it implicitly accepted not only the literal inspiration\r\nof Scripture, but the bulk of the Anglican Articles, to which was\r\nafterwards added, as an ordination test, general agreement with the\r\nmore important of Wesley’s sermons.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution brought on a strong reaction against the\r\nfree-thought which had been hideously travestied in the blasphemous\r\nfollies, and sullied by the crimes, of the Jacobins. In England the\r\nTory mob, with true instinct, sacked the library and laboratory of\r\nPriestley. Coleridge, who, like other young men of intellect, had\r\nhailed the revolutionary dawn, shared the reaction, and combining\r\nin a curious way German metaphysic with English orthodoxy and\r\nEstablishmentarianism, produced a religious system which perhaps\r\nentitles him to high place among English theologians in the proper\r\nsense of that term, as denoting a philosophic inquirer into the nature\r\nof the Deity and the relations between the Deity and man; though, as\r\nhis guiding light was philosophy, not authority or tradition, he may\r\nin that respect be numbered among the promoters of free-thought and\r\nof the results to which it was ultimately to lead. Such free-thinking\r\nas there was naturally took a turn answering in violence to the\r\nrepression. Tom Paine assailed orthodoxy, not with freedom only, but\r\nwith enmity the most virulent. Though far from an attractive, he is\r\nby no means an unimportant figure. His criticisms of the credibility\r\nand morality of Scripture, unlearned and coarse as they were, went,\r\nnot over the heads of the people like the high-flying and metaphysical\r\nspeculations, but straight to their understandings and their hearts.\r\nIt was difficult for apologetic fencers to parry such home thrusts.\r\nThe same sort of effect has been produced by the irreverent frankness\r\nof Ingersoll in our own day. Shelley rushed from the religion of Eldon\r\ninto what he took for Satanism; though his Satan is really the power of\r\ngood, while the God of Eldon, as viewed by him, is the Devil.\r\n\r\nWrecked, body and soul, by the Thirty Years’ war, and afterwards\r\nstifled under a group of petty despotisms, Germany was for a time lost\r\nto intellectual progress. Her churches and their clergy, the Lutheran\r\nclergy at least, were in a very low condition. When her intellect began\r\nto work again, it was in a recluse and highly speculative way, the\r\nnatural consequence of its exclusion from politics and other fields of\r\naction, together with the complete severance of the academical element\r\nfrom the people. Hence, from Leibnitz and Lessing onward, there was a\r\ntrain of metaphysical philosophies, each of them professing to find\r\nin our consciousness a key to the mystery of Being and an account of\r\nGod, of His counsels, and of the relation between Him and man. In\r\nderision of such speculations it was said that to the French belonged\r\nthe land, to the English the sea, to the Germans the air. Essentially\r\nincapable of verification, these theories went on shifting in\r\nnebulous succession and, with the exception of that of Kant, may now\r\nbe said to have vanished, leaving scarce a rack behind. Even of the\r\ngreat Hegel little remains. Leibnitz, with his “best of all possible\r\nworlds,” hardly survived _Candide_. Still, we must speak with respect\r\nand gratitude of these efforts of minds, powerful in their way and\r\ndevoted to truth, to solve for us the great mystery. Speculation so\r\nfree could not fail to promote general freedom of thought, and the\r\ntreatment by these thinkers of the popular and established religion was\r\nas philosophic as possible, though, with the exception of Feuerbach,\r\nthey were theists. By Lessing much was done for the recognition of all\r\nreligions and the promotion of universal toleration.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, came direct criticism of the Bible, the way to\r\nwhich, long before, had been lighted by Spinoza. It assumed a strange\r\nform in the work of Paulus, who applied to the Gospel miracles a\r\nsolvent something like that which Euhemerus had applied to the Pagan\r\nPantheon, reducing them to natural occurrences turned into miracles by\r\na devout imagination. The miraculous fish with the coin in its mouth\r\nwas a fish which would sell for the coin. The miraculous feeding of the\r\nfive thousand was brought within the compass of belief by supposing\r\nthat they were not fasting, but had only gone without a regular meal.\r\nChrist’s walking on the water was his holding out a hand from the shore\r\nto Peter who had leaped into the water to ascertain whether it was\r\nreally Christ that was walking on the shore.\r\n\r\nFar more serious, and a startling blow to orthodoxy, was the _Life\r\nof Jesus_, by Strauss, who undertook to explain the Gospels on the\r\nmythical theory, showing that the reputed incidents of the life of\r\nJesus and his miracles were mythical fulfilments of Old Testament\r\nprophecies and aspirations. From this, his first theory, Strauss\r\nafterwards partly receded, and in his second _Life of Jesus_,\r\nafter a critical examination of the authorities, he comes to the\r\nconclusion that “few great men have existed of whose history we have\r\nso unsatisfactory a knowledge as that we have of Jesus.” The figure\r\nof Socrates, he thinks, though four hundred years older, is beyond\r\nall comparison more distinct. The momentous step, however, had been\r\ntaken. Jesus had become the subject of a biography founded on critical\r\nexamination of the materials, and Strauss is right in saying, as he\r\ndoes in his second _Life_, that when the biography was seriously taken\r\nup the doom of the theological conception was sealed. Lives of Christ,\r\nincluding even the most popular of them, however they may pretend and\r\nstruggle to be orthodox, are really, as Strauss says, destructive of\r\nthe theological conception, while they do not help to confirm our\r\nloyalty to historical truth. Ferdinand Christian Baur and his Tübingen\r\nschool applied historical criticism to the early Christian Church,\r\nshowing the conflict in it of the Pauline with the Petrine tendency,\r\nand bringing it altogether, as well as its source, within the pale of\r\nhuman history. Historical criticism of the Gospels was furthered by\r\nthe progress of historical criticism in general, shown by such a work\r\nas Niebuhr’s _History of Rome_. Wolf’s treatment of the Homeric poems\r\nhad already marked the birth of a critical spirit, which was aided\r\nby historical and archæological discoveries of all kinds, as well as\r\nby the growing influence of science on the methods of religious and\r\nanthropological speculation.\r\n\r\nThere was an evangelical reaction against rationalism in Germany with\r\na train of controversialists and commentators reputed as orthodox. Yet\r\neven in these, more or less of a rationalist undertone is perceived.\r\nThere is a tendency more or less apparent to minimize the supernatural,\r\nto throw the miracles into the background, and dwell rather on the\r\nspiritual significance of Christ’s character and words. This is very\r\nconspicuous in Neander, the head of the line. An orthodox English\r\ndivine such as Mr. Rose might well, after a survey of German theology,\r\nmake a rather mournful report.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, ever the land of free speculation, criticism advanced\r\nwithout fear, and at last by the pen of Kuenen arraigns the\r\nauthenticity, antiquity, and authority of the historical books of\r\nthe Old Testament to an extent totally subversive of their character\r\nas records of a primeval history, much more as organs of a divine\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nGerman philosophy had mingled with English theology through Coleridge.\r\nGerman criticism of the Bible did not lag much behind. Milman’s\r\n_History of the Jews_, dealing with the subject in the spirit of an\r\nordinary history, treating patriarchs as Arab sheiks and minimizing\r\nmiracles, gave a serious shock to orthodox sentiment in England. Even\r\nwhat was deemed orthodox in Germany appeared rationalistic to the\r\nAnglican divines. To the evangelicals especially, whose leader was\r\nSimeon, and who occupied many of the fashionable pulpits, anything like\r\ncritical treatment of the sacred history seemed impiety. Yet they,\r\nwith their inward persuasion of conversion and spiritual union with\r\nthe Saviour, as well as the Quaker with his inner light, or the Roman\r\nCatholic with his implicit faith in the Church, were really beyond the\r\ncritic’s reach.\r\n\r\nA long line of British leaders of thought and controversialists\r\nsucceeds. Rationalist and heterodox in different degrees were Thomas\r\nArnold, Frederick Maurice, Stanley, Jowett, the writers of _Essays\r\nand Reviews_, and Robertson, of Brighton. Decidedly sceptical were\r\nMatthew Arnold, Carlyle, and James Anthony Froude. Reaction on the\r\nHigh Church side found leaders in Pusey, Newman, and Hurrell Froude.\r\nThe evangelical pulpit combated at once rationalism and High Church.\r\nThe state Church was awakened from its long torpor, and under\r\nthe inspiration of its High Church party strove to reanimate its\r\nConvocation.\r\n\r\nFrederick Maurice impressed more by his character than by his writings,\r\nwhich were fatally obscure. He was rationalist enough to be deprived\r\nof his professorship in an Anglican college. At the same time he could\r\npersuade himself that subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles was no\r\nbondage but a security for free thought. To his yoke-fellow, Kingsley,\r\nis to be traced “muscular Christianity,” a rather suspicious adaptation\r\nof the Sermon on the Mount to our times. But the pair exercised more\r\ninfluence as social missionaries, striving, in conjunction with Thomas\r\nHughes, to give the labor movement a religious turn, than as religious\r\nphilosophers or critics.\r\n\r\nThomas Arnold, the head-master of Rugby, was a man of noble character,\r\npowerful mind, and intense earnestness of purpose. He was a firm\r\nbeliever in Christianity as a revealed religion. But he held a\r\nmost liberal view of the Church. He would have admitted to it all\r\nthe sects of dissenters and have identified it as far as possible\r\nwith the nation. His theory of the identity of the Church with the\r\nnation probably came to him from his passionate study of the ancient\r\ncommonwealths. He forgot that the philosophers of Greece, though they\r\nmight sacrifice a cock to Æsculapius, were really outside the state\r\nreligion, and that the state religion made the chief of them drink\r\nhemlock. Prince of educators as he was, he sometimes laid too heavy\r\na strain on his pupils, and prematurely developed their speculative\r\ntendencies. In the case of Clough especially, mental health and vigor\r\nseem to have been impaired by premature development.\r\n\r\nWith Thomas Arnold may be coupled his friend Whately, who, though, as\r\nPrimate of the state Church of Ireland, he held the most equivocal of\r\nprelacies, was, by reason of his strong understanding, his fearless\r\ncharacter, and his shrewd wit, essentially an iconoclast and a rebuker\r\nof ecclesiastical pretensions, as well as a vigorous promoter of\r\neducation. His keen sayings flew abroad, but his personal influence was\r\ngreater than his influence as a divine. His _Historic Doubts_ was an\r\napologetic _jeu d’esprit_ which told greatly in its day.\r\n\r\nBishop Connop Thirlwall was a man of first-rate power. At Cambridge\r\nhe had set out as a rationalist, translating German theology of a\r\nheterodox cast and Niebuhr’s _History of Rome_. But his intellect was\r\ncurbed by a bishopric, and though he delivered liberal charges and\r\npersonally exerted a liberal influence, he was lost to the direct\r\nservice of reason.\r\n\r\nArthur Stanley was Arnold’s best boy, his most devoted adherent, and\r\nhis model biographer. He embraced Arnold’s theory of the Church as\r\ncoextensive with the nation and carried his theory of the supremacy\r\nof the state so far as to feel a certain sympathy with “Bluidie\r\nMackenzie” as the defender of a state Church against the independence\r\nof the Covenanters of Scotland. His name was for a time a terror to\r\nall the orthodox, High Church or Low. Yet there was little that was\r\nterrible about him. The sweetness of his character was remarkable. His\r\nliberality of religious sentiment was boundless. But he had little of\r\nthe logical or critical faculty, and showed scarcely the desire, still\r\nless the ability, to make his way to definite truth. His passion was\r\nhistory, and the historical picturesque was his forte. In a haze of\r\nthis to the last he floated, coming to no determinate conclusion. His\r\nbest works, apart from biography, are not his commentaries or sermons,\r\nbut his lectures on the history of the Russian Church and his _Sinai\r\nand Palestine_; although we cannot help smiling when, in his _Sinai and\r\nPalestine_, we see him hunting with passionate interest and implicit\r\nfaith for the imaginary scenes of mythical events.\r\n\r\nStanley’s yoke-fellow, Jowett, was a man of a different cast of mind\r\nand of higher calibre, as all the world now knows. But in him also,\r\nthough from different causes, there was the same want of inclination\r\nto grasp or capacity for grasping definite truth. These two men were\r\neminently typical of an age of religious dissolution, when people felt\r\nthe ground of faith giving way under their feet and were striving,\r\nby some sort of compromise, to save themselves from falling into the\r\nabyss. That Jowett had drifted very far away, not only from orthodoxy,\r\nbut from his belief in Christianity as a miraculous revelation,\r\nand even from belief in our knowledge of the historical character\r\nof Christ, the posthumous publication of his letters has plainly\r\nshown. How he could have reconciled it to his conscience to remain a\r\nclergyman, to hold the clerical headship of an Anglican college, to\r\nperform the service and administer the sacrament, it is not easy to\r\nsee. We can only say that the position was found tenable by one of the\r\nmost upright and disinterested of mankind. Jowett’s defence probably\r\nwas and is the defence of others, and the indication of spreading\r\ndoubt. Clergymen are educated men and can hardly be proof against that\r\nwhich is carrying conviction to other minds.\r\n\r\nRobertson, of Brighton, as an eloquent preacher and spiritual leader,\r\nrather on the rationalist side, is not to be forgotten. In his sermons\r\nthere is an evident tendency to liberalize Christianity and to present\r\nit ethically as a religion of purity and love rather than as a\r\nmiraculous revelation which did not escape the keen scent of alarmed\r\northodoxy and exposed the preacher to some social persecution.\r\n\r\nBy this time a strong current in an opposite direction had begun to\r\nflow. The religious movement was closely connected with the political\r\nmovement, especially where there was a state Church. Alarmed by the\r\nprogress of liberalism, which had carried the Parliamentary Reform\r\nbill and threatened to withdraw from the Church of England the\r\nsupport of the state, some of the clergy began to look about for a\r\nnew foundation of their authority, and thought that they found it in\r\napostolical succession and the sacerdotal theory of the sacraments.\r\nThe leaders of the movement were Pusey, professor of Hebrew at Oxford;\r\nHenry Newman, a Fellow of Oriel College; and, in its opening, Hurrell\r\nFroude, in whose _Life of Becket_ its spirit and aims are plainly\r\nrevealed. It took practically the shape of an attempt to return to\r\nthe priestly Middle Ages. Oxford, with its mediæval colleges, the\r\nFellows of which were then clerical and celibate, formed the natural\r\nscene of such an attempt. Pusey, who, by his academical rank, gave his\r\nname to the movement, was a man of monastic character and mind, with\r\na piety intense but austere and gloomy enough almost to cling to such\r\na doctrine as the irremissibility of post-baptismal sin. Henry Newman\r\nwas a man of genius, a writer with a most charming and persuasive\r\nstyle, great personal fascination, and extraordinary subtlety of mind.\r\nWhat he lacked was the love of truth; system, not truth, was his\r\naspiration; and as a reasoner he was extremely sophistical, however\r\nhonest he might be as a man. In this respect he presented a singular\r\ncontrast to his brother, Francis Newman, in whom the love of truth was\r\nthe ruling passion, intense and uncompromising, while he was totally\r\ndevoid of the gifts of imagination with which Henry was endowed.\r\nHenry Newman’s attempt to revive mediæval doctrines presently landed\r\nhim, with his immediate following, in the mediæval Church. Pusey was\r\nillogical enough to refuse the leap. He was also believed to be rather\r\nstrongly attached to the leadership and spiritual directorship which,\r\nas a magnate of the Church of England, he enjoyed. He went so near to\r\nthe brink as, in his _Irenicon_, to avow that nothing separated him\r\nfrom Rome but the unmeasured autocracy of the Pope and the excessive\r\nworship of the Virgin, both of them mere questions of degree. Manning\r\nin time followed: an aspiring hierarch who would probably have stayed\r\nin the Church of England if they had made him a bishop. Passing into\r\nthe Church of Rome, he became a Cardinal, an active intriguer of the\r\nVatican, and an extreme Ultramontane, outvying Newman, who, when the\r\nconvert’s first ecstasy was over, might be said to be converted rather\r\nthan changed.\r\n\r\nThe mediævalizing movement owed much to the fascinations of mediæval\r\nart. The Gothic churches and cathedrals and the Gothic ruins of abbeys\r\nhave been very powerful conservators and propagators of the faith of\r\ntheir builders. It is curious that this talisman should have been\r\nrenounced by the Church of Rome in favor of the heathen style, of which\r\nSt. Peter’s is the paragon, magnificent but, in a religious sense,\r\nunimpressive.\r\n\r\nBy the progress of Tractarianism British Protestantism was alarmed and\r\nincensed. The Oxford Convocation was the scene of a pitched battle\r\nbrought on by a bold deliverance of Ward, a disciple of Newman, more\r\nlogical and daring than his master, who exultingly proclaimed that\r\nEnglish clergymen were embracing “the whole cycle of Roman doctrine.”\r\nWard, after a struggle which was a sort of Armageddon of High and Low\r\nChurch, was condemned and deprived of his degree. Newman’s conversion\r\nspeedily followed. The rationalists, such as Stanley and Jowett, voted\r\non liberal grounds against the condemnation of Ward.\r\n\r\nA storm from the other quarter was raised by _Essays and Reviews_, a\r\ncollection of seven essays written by clergymen of the rationalistic\r\nschool, having for its object the liberalizing of inquiry in the\r\nChurch. The manifesto at the time created an immense sensation,\r\nthough in the present advanced state of doctrinal disintegration it\r\nwould almost pass unnoticed. One of the essays, the most innocent,\r\nit is true, which nevertheless committed the author to the general\r\nobject of the combination, was written by the present Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and caused the High Church clergy to protest against his\r\nappointment as a bishop. The glove thus thrown down was taken up by\r\nthe High Churchmen. The writers were arraigned for heresy before the\r\nPrivy Council, and, as Carlyle said, you had a bench of old British\r\njudges, “like Roman augurs, debating with iron gravity questions of\r\nprevenient grace, supervenient moonshine, and the color of the bishop’s\r\nnightmare if that happened to turn up.” Before the same tribunal was\r\narraigned Colenso, a missionary bishop of South Africa and an eminent\r\nmathematician, whose arithmetical instincts had led him to examine the\r\nnumerical statements of the Pentateuch, with highly heretical results.\r\nBoth the essayists and Bishop Colenso escaped conviction. The Committee\r\nof Privy Council, if it was judicial, was also political, and it was\r\nresolved, if possible, to avert a rupture in the state Church. Veteran\r\nlawyers had little difficulty in finding grounds for acquittal when\r\nthey did not choose to convict. The language of the impugned writings\r\nwas seldom so precise as to defy the power of interpretation. “Either\r\nthe passage means what I say, or it has no meaning,” thundered the\r\ncounsel for the prosecution. “Is it not possible, Mr. Blank, that the\r\npassage may have no meaning?” was the reply of the judge. The Rev. Mr.\r\nVoysey, however, succeeded in obtaining the honor of a conviction.\r\nTendered a week to retract, he thanked the court for the opportunity\r\nthey had given him of rejecting the offer of repurchasing his once\r\ncherished position in the Established Church by proclaiming himself a\r\nhypocrite.\r\n\r\nHampden, Regius Professor of Theology at Oxford, formed another object\r\nof High Church attack. He had been condemned by the university\r\non account of doctrines alleged to be anti-Trinitarian, and his\r\nappointment by a Whig ministry to a bishopric caused a renewal of the\r\nonslaught, which, however, only served by its failure to emphasize\r\nthe fact that the Church of England was in complete subjection to\r\nthe state. In this, as in the general commotion, prominently figured\r\nWilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, son of the great evangelical and\r\nphilanthropist, a man gifted, dexterous, and versatile, who would have\r\nmade a first-rate advocate or politician, balancing himself with one\r\nfoot on his hereditary Evangelicism, the other on High Churchmanship,\r\nto which, in his heart, as a hierarch, he inclined. A character so\r\nambiguous could make little impression, however great his abilities\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nJames Anthony Froude had been a follower and fellow-worker of Newman.\r\nBut on Newman’s secession he not only hung back, but violently recoiled\r\nand produced a highly sceptical work, _The Nemesis of Faith_, which\r\nentailed his resignation of a clerical fellowship in an Oxford college.\r\nThen he exemplified the strange variations of the age by coming out as\r\nan historian in the colors of Carlyle.\r\n\r\nCarlyle himself is not to be left out of sight in an account of the\r\nprogress of religious thought; for his Scotch Calvinism, transmuted\r\ninto hero worship, has taken a strong hold, if not on the distinct\r\nconvictions, on the sentiment and temper of the nation. If he has\r\nadministered wholesome rebuke to the self-complacency of democracy with\r\nits ballot-box, he has also set up a worship of force and kindled a\r\nspirit of violence totally subversive of the Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold, with his silver shafts, was rather a connoisseur in\r\nall lines than a serious philosopher or theologian; but he also,\r\nwith his conversion of God into the “not ourselves which makes for\r\nrighteousness,” did something in his light but insinuating and\r\ncharming way to forward disintegration.\r\n\r\nBut in 1874–77 appeared _Supernatural Religion_, a searching and\r\nuncompromising inquiry into the historical evidences of supernatural\r\nChristianity. The book, though attacked on secondary points with\r\nperhaps superior learning by Bishop Lightfoot, Bishop Westcott,\r\nand others, cannot be said to have met with any general answer.\r\nSupplemented in some respects by Dr. Martineau’s _Seat of Authority in\r\nReligion_ and other works on the same side, it sets forth the sceptic’s\r\ncase against the supernatural.\r\n\r\nMiracles, says criticism, belong to an age of ignorance. With the dawn\r\nof knowledge they diminish. In its meridian light they disappear. The\r\nJews were eminently addicted to belief in miracles. There was Satanic\r\nmiracle as well as divine; nor can any distinction be drawn as a matter\r\nof evidence between the two. As little can any distinction be drawn in\r\npoint of evidence between the Gospel miracles and the ecclesiastical\r\nmiracles, which nevertheless Protestants reject. The miracles of one\r\nsort, the demoniac, are bound up with the Jewish belief in possession\r\nby personal devils, from which all efforts to disentangle them so as\r\nto resolve them into cures of lunacy by moral influence are vain. The\r\nfour Gospels and the Acts, which comprise the historic evidences, are\r\nall anonymous, all of uncertain authorship. The first three Gospels\r\nare evident incrustations upon an older document which is lost and\r\nabout which nothing is known. In not one of the five cases can the\r\nexistence of the book be traced to the time of the events or a time\r\nso near the events as to preclude the growth of fable in a highly\r\nsuperstitious and totally uncritical age. The presentation of Christ’s\r\ncharacter and teaching in the fourth Gospel, which is Alexandrian, is\r\nfar from identical with the presentation in the first three Gospels,\r\nwhich are Jewish. There are irreconcilable discrepancies between the\r\nGospels as to matters of fact, notably in regard to the genealogy of\r\nChrist, the length of his mission, the Last Supper, the day of the\r\nCrucifixion, the details of the Resurrection and the Ascension. Such\r\nmiracles as the miraculous darkness, the earthquake, the rending of\r\nthe veil of the Temple, the opening of the tombs and the apparition\r\nof the dead in the streets of Jerusalem, being totally unconfirmed by\r\nhistory or by any recorded effect, stagger belief. Such testimony as\r\nSt. Paul bears to the Resurrection is second hand, is that of a convert\r\nin the ecstasy of conversion, and is manifestly uncritical. His own\r\nenthusiasm is intelligible on merely human grounds. We may be sure that\r\nhad God become incarnate to save man, absolutely conclusive proof of\r\nthat fact would have been vouchsafed. But the proof is not sufficient\r\nto establish anything not otherwise perfectly credible, far less to\r\nestablish the miraculous Birth, the Resurrection, and the Incarnation.\r\nSuch in broad outline is the case of Rationalism against Supernatural\r\nReligion presented by the work just mentioned and its allies. The\r\neffects are visible even in High Church writings. In the writings of\r\nliberals, of course, they are still more visible. Jowett had come to\r\nthe conclusion that our sources of knowledge about Christ had been\r\nreduced to a single document, no longer in existence, which formed the\r\nbasis of the first three Gospels.\r\n\r\nThe desire to minimize the supernatural and throw it into the\r\nbackground, bringing the personal character of Christ and his ethical\r\nteaching into the foreground, is now manifest in English, as it has\r\nlong been in German, divines. It is conspicuous in the very popular\r\nand colorably orthodox works of Dr. Farrar. In his _Life of Lives_\r\nthe supernatural has little place. There is an evident tendency\r\nthroughout to disentangle from it the character and moral teaching.\r\nResponsibility for belief in the Godhead of Christ seems to rest on\r\nthe Nicene Council. In the _Life of Christ_ we see reduced to a natural\r\noccurrence the miracle of Gadara, where the devils cast out of the\r\nmen enter into the herd of swine. It is needless to say that with the\r\nmiraculous element of these occurrences their value as evidence for the\r\nsupernatural disappears.\r\n\r\nScotland generally remained fast bound by her Westminster Confession.\r\nThere had been a period of liberalism marked by the appearance of\r\n“Jupiter” Carlyle; Robertson, the historian; Dugald Stewart, and\r\nother philosophers and men of mind. But the Church of Scotland being\r\ndemocratic, its faith was in the keeping of the people, who were\r\nimpervious to criticism and naturally opposed to innovation. At last,\r\nhowever, the thaw came, hastened perhaps by the collision between\r\nthe state Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The Westminster\r\nConfession, it seems, has now been tacitly laid aside, and Scotch\r\ntheology has had its Robertson Smith, whose critical views on the Old\r\nTestament earned him removal from his professorial chair.\r\n\r\nAnother book which in its day startled the world and awakened all\r\nthe echoes of orthodox alarm was Buckle’s _History of Civilization_,\r\nin which the characters of nations and the progress of humanity were\r\ntraced to physical influences, excluding the moral and by implication\r\nthe theistic element. Its thesis was supported by an overwhelming\r\ndisplay of learning. Though not expressly, it was in its tenor hostile\r\nto religious belief. Of Buckle’s work less is now heard, but it had an\r\ninfluence in its day, perhaps more in America than in its native land.\r\nAmericans, it seems, were captured both by the boldness of the theory\r\nand by the imposing display of erudition.\r\n\r\nIn the line of learned and dispassionate research France has produced\r\nRenan, whose _Life of Jesus_ especially made a vast impression on\r\nEurope, and still probably exercises an influence by virtue not only\r\nof the boldness of the speculation and the intense interest of the\r\nsubject, but of the extreme beauty of the style. The work, however, is\r\none in which imagination acts strongly on history. It lacks critical\r\nbasis; not that the author fails fully to set out his authorities, but\r\nthat in his narrative he fails to discriminate among them. One incident\r\nis treated as real, another as mythical, to suit the requirements of\r\npoetical conception, without reason assigned for the distinction. There\r\nseems no reason, for example, why the miracle of the raising of Lazarus\r\nshould be treated as historical, though in the sense of imposture or\r\nillusion, while other miracles are treated as totally unhistoric. Nor\r\nis the portrait free from a French and slightly sensuous cast. From the\r\nwhole body of Renan’s histories of Israel, of Christ, and of the early\r\nChurch the supernatural is entirely excluded.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church has not suffered from criticism—historical,\r\nliterary, or scientific—in the same way as the Protestant Churches,\r\nthat is, internally, because it depends not so much on intellectual\r\nconviction as on ecclesiastical organization, and rests comparatively\r\nlittle on the authority of the Bible. Its priesthood has not been\r\naffected like the clergy of the Church of England or the ministries of\r\nthe Protestant Churches. But it has everywhere been losing the educated\r\nclasses, or retained a part of them, not so much from conviction—still\r\nless from speculative conviction—as because its alliance is congenial\r\nto political and social reaction. Its inability to come to terms\r\nwith science has been shown by the recent case of St. George Mivart,\r\nand scientific eminence among Roman Catholics is rare. In Italy, the\r\ncentre of the system, while the poorer classes still flock to the\r\nliquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples or the exudation\r\nof the bones of St. Andrew at Amalfi, still climb the Holy Staircase on\r\ntheir knees or make pilgrimages to the House of Loretto, the general\r\ntone of intelligence is described as sceptical, though aristocratic\r\nfamilies, more especially those of Papal creation, adhere to the Papacy\r\non political and social rather than on religious grounds. Near to the\r\nshrine of Ignatius Loyola stands the statue of Giordano Bruno, on the\r\nspot of his martyrdom by fire, “dedicated to him by the age which he\r\nforesaw.” Attempts have been made to liberalize the Church of Rome\r\nand enable it to float with the current of the day, but they have\r\nfailed. Pio Nono for a time put himself at the head of the popular and\r\nliberal movement in Italy. But he soon found, as Carlyle said, that\r\nit was an alarming undertaking. Lamennais’s attempt at liberalization\r\nended, after a long intellectual agony, in his own secession. The\r\ncombined attempt of Lacordaire to liberalize ecclesiastically, and of\r\nMontalembert to liberalize politically, had a scarcely less melancholy\r\nresult; both of them died under the shadow of Papal displeasure or\r\nof that of the Jesuit party, by which the Papacy was controlled.\r\nThe defiantly reactionary spirit of Ultramontanism de Maistre has\r\nprevailed. The Jesuit has ruled at the Vatican. Under his guidance the\r\nPapacy has proclaimed the infallibility of the Pope and the Immaculate\r\nConception of the Virgin, thus breaking completely and finally with\r\nreason and with all who, like the “Old Catholics” in Germany, remained\r\nin some degree within that pale. It has gained in its own despite in\r\nrespectability and influence by deprivation of its temporal power,\r\nagainst which the Prisoner of the Vatican still hopelessly protests.\r\n\r\nIn France the national religion, abolished and persecuted by the\r\nJacobins, was restored for a political purpose by Napoleon. The new\r\nCharlemagne was requited with the degradation of the Pope, who came to\r\nParis to crown him on the morrow of the murder of the Duc d’Enghien\r\nand broke the best traditions of the Holy See by failing to veto the\r\ndivorce from Josephine. Identified with political reaction under the\r\nrestored Bourbons, the Church nearly suffered wreck in the revolution\r\nby which they were overthrown. She remained the object of intense\r\nand persecuting hatred to the revolutionary and republican party.\r\nPlaintively, when the Orleans monarchy fell, she chanted _Domine salvum\r\nfac populum_. Joyously, when the Empire succeeded, she chanted _Domine\r\nsalvum fac Imperatorem_. But the Empire in its turn fell. The Church\r\nhas continued to ally herself with political reaction and aristocratic\r\nhostility to the Republic, though she has latterly been receiving hints\r\nfrom the Vatican that the Republic is strong, that the monarchical\r\nand imperial pretenders both are weak. The consequence is a violence\r\nof hostility on the part of the Radicals and Socialists which assails\r\nnot only monastic fraternities, but educational institutions and\r\neven charitable institutions in clerical hands, and has produced an\r\ninfidel literature carrying blasphemy to the height almost of frenzy\r\nand culminating in a comic _Life of Christ_. The official world of\r\nFrance is almost formally infidel, and a religious expression would be\r\nvery injurious to a politician. On the other hand, the Church braves\r\nand exasperates public reason with apparitions of the Virgin and the\r\nmiracles of Lourdes. Over most of the women, the priest still holds\r\nsway. Of the men, not many are seen in churches. The general attitude\r\nof the educated towards religion seems to be not so much that of\r\nhostility as that of total indifference, a state of estrangement more\r\nhopeless than hostility itself.\r\n\r\nThere is in France a Protestant Church, of which Guizot was an\r\neminent member, and which in his time was renewing its life. But\r\nthere was a schism in it between an evangelical party and a party\r\nwhich was entirely rationalist, Guizot belonging to the first, his\r\nson-in-law to the second; and rationalism seems to have prevailed.\r\nWith the Protestant party of France was allied an evangelical party\r\nin Switzerland, of which Vinet was the most eloquent divine. But in\r\nVinet, as in liberal divines generally, we find an inclination to rest\r\non the spiritual rather than on the supernatural. In the city of Calvin\r\ngenerally opinions appear to reign more opposed to the religion of\r\nCalvin than those for which he burned Servetus.\r\n\r\nBut of the disintegrating forces criticism—the Higher Criticism as\r\nit is the fashion to call it—has by no means been the only one.\r\nAnother, and perhaps in recent times the more powerful, has been\r\nscience, from which Voltaire and the earlier sceptics received little\r\nor no assistance in their attacks; for they were unable to meet even\r\nthe supposed testimony of fossils to the Flood. It is curious that\r\nthe bearing of the Newtonian astronomy on the Biblical cosmography\r\nshould not have been before perceived; most curious that it should\r\nhave escaped Newton himself. His system plainly contravened the idea\r\nwhich made the earth the centre of the universe, with heaven above\r\nand hell below it, and by which the cosmography alike of the Old and\r\nthe New Testament is pervaded. Yet the Star of Bethlehem remained\r\nlittle disturbed as an article of faith. The first destructive blow\r\nfrom the region of science was perhaps dealt by geology, which showed\r\nthat the earth had been gradually formed, not suddenly created, that\r\nits antiquity immeasurably transcended the orthodox chronology, and\r\nthat death had come into the world long before man. Geologists, scared\r\nby the echoes of their own teaching, were fain to shelter themselves\r\nunder allegorical interpretations of Genesis totally foreign to the\r\nintentions of the writer; making out the “days” of Creation to be æons,\r\na version which, even if accepted, would not have accounted for the\r\nentrance of death into the world before the creation of man. Those\r\nwho attended the lectures of Buckland and other geologists of that\r\ngeneration well recollect the shifts to which science had recourse in\r\nits efforts to avoid collision with the cosmogony supposed to have\r\nbeen dictated by the Creator to the reputed author of the Pentateuch.\r\nThat the narrative of Genesis could hold its ground so long against\r\nscience was due at once to its dignity, which earned for it the praise\r\nof Longinus, and to its approximation to scientific truth in describing\r\nthe universe as the work of a single mind. These characteristics\r\nhave even in the day of geology and Darwin raised up for it such an\r\napologist as Mr. Gladstone, whose defence, however, amounts to this,\r\nthat the Creator, in giving an account of his own work to Moses, came\r\nremarkably near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe grand catastrophe, however, was the discovery of Darwin. This\r\nassailed the belief that man was a distinct creation, apart from all\r\nother animals, with an immortal soul specially breathed into him by\r\nthe author of his being. It showed that he had been developed by a\r\nnatural process out of lower forms of life. It showed that instead of\r\na fall of man there had been a gradual rise, thus cutting away the\r\nground of the Redemption and the Incarnation, the fundamental doctrines\r\nof the orthodox creed. For the hypothesis of creation generally was\r\nsubstituted that of evolution by some unknown but natural force.\r\n\r\nNot only to revealed or supernatural but to natural religion a heavy\r\nblow was dealt by the disclosure of wasted æons and abortive species\r\nwhich seem to preclude the idea of an intelligent and omnipotent\r\ndesigner.\r\n\r\nThe chief interpreters of science in its bearing on religion were,\r\nin England, Tyndall and Huxley. Tyndall always declared himself a\r\nmaterialist, though no one could less deserve the name if it implied\r\nanything like grossness or disregard of the higher sentiments. He\r\nstartled the world by his declaration that matter contained the\r\npotentiality of all life, an assertion which, though it has been found\r\ndifficult to prove experimentally, there can be less difficulty in\r\naccepting, since we see life in rudimentary forms and in different\r\nstages of development. Huxley wielded a trenchant pen and was an\r\nuncompromising servant of truth. A bitter controversy between him and\r\nOwen arose out of Owen’s tendency to compromise. He came at one time\r\nto the extreme conclusion that man was an automaton, which would have\r\nsettled all religious and moral questions out of hand; but in this\r\nhe seemed afterwards to feel that he had gone too far. An automaton\r\nautomatically reflecting on its automatic character is a being which\r\nseems to defy conception. The connection of action with motive, of\r\nmotive with character and circumstance, is what nobody doubts; but the\r\nprecise nature of the connection, as it is not subject, like a physical\r\nconnection, to our inspection, defies scrutiny, and our consciousness,\r\nwhich is our only informant, tells us that our agency in some qualified\r\nsense is free.\r\n\r\nMaterialists or physicists such as Tyndall and Huxley, or their\r\ncounterparts on the Continent, would console us for the loss of\r\nreligion by substituting the majesty of law. But the idea of law\r\nimplies a law-giver or an intelligent and authoritative imponent of\r\nsome kind. There is no majesty in a mere sequence, even the most\r\ninvariable and on the largest scale, the existence of which alone\r\nphysical science can prove.\r\n\r\nThe all-embracing philosophy of Mr. Herbert Spencer excludes not only\r\nthe supernatural but theism in its ordinary form. Yet theism in a\r\nsubtle form may be thought to lurk in it. “By continually seeking,”\r\nhe says, “to know, and being continually thrown back with a deepened\r\nconviction of the impossibility of knowing, we may keep alive the\r\nconsciousness that it is alike our highest wisdom and our highest duty\r\nto regard that through which all things exist as the Unknowable.” In\r\nthis and subsequent passages he evidently looks upon the Unknowable as\r\nan object of reverence, otherwise it would hardly be our highest duty\r\nto regard it as that through which all things exist, or to maintain any\r\nparticular attitude towards it. But Unknowableness in itself excites\r\nno reverence, even though it be supposed infinite and eternal. Nothing\r\nexcites our reverence but a person, or at least a Moral Being. There\r\nlingers in Mr. Spencer’s mind the belief that the present limit of our\r\nknowledge is the veil of the Deity.\r\n\r\nHad the Darwinian discoveries been known to Schopenhauer they would\r\nhave conspired with the earlier discoveries of science and with his\r\npitiless survey of the human lot to confirm him in the belief that this\r\nwas the worst of all possible worlds. Amid the general distraction\r\neven pessimism has found adherents, and a European version of Buddhism\r\npromising final relief from the miseries of conscious existence has\r\nbeen accepted as an anodyne by troubled minds.\r\n\r\nPositivism, the work of Comte, totally discards belief in God and\r\ntreats theism in all its forms as merely a mode of contemplating\r\nphenomena and a step in the course of human progress. Yet the\r\nPositivist feels the need of a religion, and for the worship of God he\r\nsubstitutes the worship of Humanity. Humanity is an abstraction and\r\nan imperfect abstraction, the course of the human race having not yet\r\nbeen run. It cannot hear prayer or respond in any way to adoration. The\r\nadherents of Comte’s religion, therefore, are few, though those of his\r\nphilosophy are more numerous, and the religious Comtists appear to be\r\nrather enthusiasts of Humanity than worshippers of the abstraction.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous though equivocal place among the defenders of revealed\r\nreligion in England was held by Mansel, professor of moral and\r\nmetaphysical philosophy at Oxford and afterwards dean of St. Paul’s.\r\nAttempting in his Bampton lectures to make philosophy fall on its own\r\nsword, he fell on his own sword in the attempt. He maintained that God,\r\nbeing absolute, could not be apprehended by the finite intelligence\r\nof man, and that the finite morality of man was not the same as the\r\nabsolute morality of God. Hence the passages of the Bible which seemed\r\nto conflict with human morality really transcended it and were moral\r\nmiracles. In this Mansel was reviving the theory of Archbishop King\r\nand Bishop Browne, who had maintained that our knowledge of God was\r\nnot actual, but merely analogous. The inference was promptly drawn by\r\nMansel’s opponents that what could not be apprehended could not be\r\nmatter of belief, and that he had therefore cut away the possibility\r\nof belief in God. They even contended that he was too anti-theistic,\r\nsince he did away with all possibility of reverence for the Unknown. To\r\ndeny the identity of human with divine morality and assert that what\r\nwas immoral with man was moral with God was to sever the moral relation\r\nbetween God and man, and, in effect, to destroy morality altogether.\r\nWe could conceive of only one morality, and acts ascribed to God which\r\nviolated that morality must be to us immoral. “If,” said John Stuart\r\nMill in the fervor of ethical protest, “an Almighty Being tells me that\r\nI shall call that righteous which is wicked or go to hell, to hell I\r\nwill go.”\r\n\r\nTo meet the inroads of science on Biblical cosmogony and cosmography\r\nrecourse was had to allegorical interpretation. But allegorical\r\ninterpretation cannot be forced upon a writer when it manifestly is not\r\nin his mind. The writer or writers of Genesis undeniably intended his\r\nor their statements to be taken literally. They meant that the earth\r\nwas really created in six days, as the Fourth Commandment assumes; that\r\nthe formation of Eve out of a rib of Adam, the temptation of Eve by the\r\nserpent, and all the actions of the anthropomorphic God, who walks in\r\nthe garden at evening and makes garments for Adam and Eve, were actual\r\nevents. To foist upon them allegorical interpretation is to falsify\r\ntheir testimony. Besides, instead of having the facts of the creation\r\nrevealed to us we are left to interpret allegory at a venture.\r\n\r\nRecourse has been had to the theory of partial inspiration, admitting\r\nhistorical and even moral errors in Scripture, but setting them down\r\nto the human element in the composition, which has to be recognized\r\nwithout prejudice to that element which remains divine. Such a\r\ncollaboration of infallibility with fallibility, both historical and\r\nmoral, is a desperate hypothesis, especially when the object was to\r\nreveal vital truths to man. Nor could man distinguish the human element\r\nfrom the divine without being himself inspired and thus above the\r\nneed of revelation. A condescension of the divine to the primitive\r\nshortcomings and aberrations of humanity is a solution surely opposed\r\nto any conceivable purpose of revelation.\r\n\r\nAnother line of defence has been the hypothesis, which may be called\r\nquasi-inspiration, reducing the inspiration of the Scriptures to a\r\nsupreme degree of the same sort of inspiration which we recognize in\r\na great poet or a great author of any kind. This is mere playing with\r\nthe term “inspiration,” and little better than an equivoque. It may be,\r\nand we hope it is, true that the Author of our being manifests Himself\r\nin whatever is morally grand and elevating. But this belief is very\r\ndifferent from a belief in the special inspiration of the Bible.\r\n\r\nEvolution, again, which at first was repelled as atheistic, is now\r\nadopted by some as the key to revelation and the solution of all\r\ndifficulties connected with it. This would make God in His revelation\r\nof Himself to man, without apparent motive, subject Himself to a\r\nphysical or quasi-physical law, the knowledge of which has been\r\nwithheld from man till the present time. An imperfect revelation of\r\nthe divine character, one for example which should exhibit the justice\r\nof God without His mercy, would be a deception of man instead of a\r\nrevelation. Besides, evolution repels finality, and we could have no\r\nassurance that the manifestation of the divine nature in Christ and the\r\nGospel would be final.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say how manifestly all these theories have their\r\norigin in controversial necessity, how totally alien they are to the\r\nview taken hitherto by the Christian Churches of the Scriptures, and\r\nhow unlikely it is that God, in revealing Himself to man for the\r\npurpose of human salvation, should have chosen a method such as would\r\nentail inevitable misconstruction for many centuries and postpone the\r\ntrue interpretation of His character and dealings to an age of human\r\ncriticism and science.\r\n\r\nThe ethics of Christianity have hitherto comparatively escaped\r\nsystematic criticism and are still generally and officially professed.\r\nAn appeal to the principles of the Sermon on the Mount continues to\r\ncommand formal respect. But Christ’s view of this world as evil and\r\nhis renunciation of it for the Kingdom of God have been practically\r\nlaid aside by all but specially religious men. Christ’s moral code\r\nwas, in its direct bearing, only personal or social, politics and\r\ncommerce not having come within the view of the teacher of Galilee.\r\nIn regard to public and international concerns, the abjuration of his\r\nprinciples is most striking. In that sphere Christian meekness, mercy,\r\nand self-sacrifice are being openly superseded by maxims drawn from\r\nthe Darwinian Struggle for Existence and by avowals of the right of\r\nthe strong. Even professed ministers of Christ have been pandering\r\nto Imperialism and the lust of war. In truth, by a strange turn of\r\nevents, Christian ethics, in questions between nation and nation and in\r\nquestions concerning humanity at large, have been passing out of the\r\nhands of the orthodox teachers of supernatural Christianity into those\r\nof men who recognize only the human character and ethical teachings of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nProfessor Seeley in his earlier days had made a great impression\r\nwith his _Ecce Homo_, an attempt to bring the character of Christ\r\nnearer to the heart of humanity. The work was decidedly pietist; yet\r\na rationalizing tendency was scented in it by the Evangelicals, whose\r\nleader, Lord Shaftesbury, denounced it. Its author promised a theology.\r\nBut when, after years of reflection and subjection to the influences\r\nof a moving time, the theology came, under the title of _Natural\r\nReligion_, it was a total disappointment. Religion was reduced by it\r\nto enthusiasm, not exclusively Christian or even theistic, but of any\r\nkind, such as enthusiastic love of country or of art.\r\n\r\nMinds of the finer cast have preserved the religious spirit, while\r\nthey have thrown off the shackles of creed and even regarded the whole\r\nreligious question as matter of doubt and suspense.\r\n\r\n    “There lives more faith in honest doubt,\r\n    Believe me, than in half the creeds.”\r\n\r\nThis is the pervading spirit of Tennyson’s poems, and of such a work\r\nas Amiel’s diary, but it must manifestly be confined to a circle of\r\nminds such as those of Tennyson and Amiel. Agnosticism is the condition\r\ninto which a large number of educated minds have been more or less\r\nconsciously passing or drifting. But while in some of them a religious\r\nspirit still prevails and the hope is cherished of a new religious\r\ndawn, others seem to have finally settled in the conviction that\r\ntheological inquiry is hopeless and that our knowledge must forever be\r\nbounded by that which our senses and science tell us about the laws or\r\nforces of our own world.\r\n\r\nReluctance to give up belief in the unseen world and perhaps still\r\nmore unwillingness to think that the loved ones who are lost by death\r\nare lost forever have given birth to Spiritualism. It will hardly be\r\nthought necessary to comment on an illusion which has been so often\r\nand so decisively exposed. Its very name is belied when the spirits\r\nhave to materialize before they can make their existence known or hold\r\nconverse with those who evoke them. The alleged communications from the\r\nspirit world through such a medium as Planchette have been trivial,\r\nalmost fatuous. It is now forgotten that the movement began with\r\ntable-turning, as though spirits had a special affinity for tables.\r\n\r\nAmong the anti-theistic, or at least the anti-ecclesiastical,\r\ninfluences and the solvents of our religious system may be reckoned the\r\nfoundation of systems of morality independent of the divine sanction.\r\nPaley’s definition of virtue is “the doing good to mankind in obedience\r\nto the will of God and for the sake of everlasting happiness.” This is\r\nthe theistic view. Opposed to it is the Utilitarian system, generally\r\nconnected with Bentham’s name, which finds the sole and sufficient\r\nmotive and reward of virtue in the promotion of our well-being here.\r\nSo long as a system aims at perfection and beauty of character which\r\ntranscend temporal happiness there is in the philosophy a theistic\r\nelement, patent or latent. But of perfection and beauty of character\r\nthe Utilitarian philosophy in its thorough-going form takes no account.\r\n\r\nThe weakening of religious belief as a social influence on the\r\nconservative side is very marked and excites the fears of statesmen,\r\nsome of whom, even if they are Protestants, are inclined to look with\r\ncomplacency on the Papacy as a bulwark against social revolution. The\r\ndrudge rested in dull contentment with his lot while he could believe\r\nthat hereafter the parts of Dives and Lazarus would be reversed and\r\nfull amends would be made to him for his privations in this life. This\r\nhope having vanished, he is resolved, if he can, to have a share of\r\nthe good things of the present world. That this sentiment helps to set\r\nseething the caldron of socialistic and communistic agitation, all who\r\nare familiar with labor literature must be aware. It would probably be\r\nfound that anarchism and atheism generally went together.\r\n\r\nAs the natural consequence of the loosened hold of religion over\r\nthe nations, there has been a general tendency in Europe towards\r\ndisestablishment. In Italy, the seat of the Papacy, disestablishment\r\nis complete. In Spain, while Catholicism is still recognized as the\r\nexclusive religion of the nation, the immense revenues of the clergy\r\nhave been secularized, monasteries have been dissolved, and religion\r\nhas been almost reduced to a department of the state. In France the\r\nprocess has gone still further than in Spain, and religion may almost\r\nbe said to be not only a department, but a despised department, of the\r\nstate. In Ireland the state Church has been disestablished. A bill\r\nhas been brought in for the disestablishment of the Church in Wales,\r\nand in England disestablishment seems to be approaching, its advent\r\nbeing hastened by the collision of ritualism with the anti-Roman and\r\nanti-sacerdotal spirit of the nation. Popular education has everywhere\r\nbeen largely secularized, and that process is still going on.\r\nSunday-schools or other secondary influences can scarcely countervail\r\nthe general banishment of religion from the training of the child.\r\n\r\nReligion passed from old to New England in the form of a refugee\r\nProtestantism of the most intensely Biblical and the most austere kind.\r\nIt had, notably in Connecticut, a code of moral and social law which,\r\nif fully carried into effect, must have fearfully darkened life. It\r\nproduced in Jonathan Edwards the philosopher of Calvinism, from the\r\nmeshes of whose predestinarian logic it has been found difficult to\r\nescape, though all such reasonings are practically rebutted by our\r\nindefeasible consciousness of freedom of choice and of responsibility\r\nas attendant thereon. New England Puritanism was intolerant, even\r\npersecuting; but the religious founder and prophet of Rhode Island\r\nproclaimed the principles of perfect toleration and of the entire\r\nseparation of the Church from the state. The ice of New England\r\nPuritanism was gradually thawed by commerce, non-Puritan immigration\r\nfrom the old country, and social influences, as much as by the force of\r\nintellectual emancipation; though in founding universities and schools\r\nit had in fact prepared for its own ultimate subversion. Unitarianism\r\nwas a half-way house through which Massachusetts passed into\r\nthorough-going liberalism such as we find in Emerson, Thoreau, and the\r\ncircle of Brook Farm; and afterwards into the iconoclasm of Ingersoll.\r\nThe only Protestant Church of much importance to which the New World\r\nhas given birth is the Universalist, a natural offspring of democratic\r\nhumanity revolting against the belief in eternal fire. Enthusiasm\r\nunilluminated may still hold its camp-meetings and sing “Rock of Ages”\r\nin the grove under the stars.\r\n\r\nThe main support of orthodox Protestantism in the United States now\r\nis an off-shoot from the old country. It is Methodism, which, by the\r\nperfection of its organization, combining strong ministerial authority\r\nwith a democratic participation of all members in the active service of\r\nthe Church, has so far not only held its own but enlarged its borders\r\nand increased its power; its power, perhaps, rather than its spiritual\r\ninfluence, for the time comes when the fire of enthusiasm grows cold\r\nand class meetings lose their fervor. The membership is mostly drawn\r\nfrom a class little exposed to the disturbing influences of criticism\r\nor science; nor has the education of the ministers hitherto been\r\ngenerally such as to bring them into contact with the arguments of the\r\nsceptic.\r\n\r\nThe character and intensity of the movement in Europe have been greatly\r\ninfluenced by the existence of state Churches and the degrees of\r\nobnoxious privilege which the state Churches severally have possessed.\r\nWhere the yoke of the establishment was heavy, as in France under\r\nthe Bourbons, free-thought has been lashed into fury; where, as in\r\nEngland, the ecclesiastical polity has been comparatively mild, it\r\nhas taken the gentler form of evangelical dissent. In the United\r\nStates at the beginning of the last century there were faint relics of\r\nstate Churches, Churches, that is, recognized and protected, though\r\nnot endowed, by the state. But there has been little to irritate\r\nscepticism or provoke it to violence of any kind, and the transition\r\nhas accordingly been tranquil. Speculation, however, has now arrived\r\nat a point at which its results in the minds of the more inquiring\r\nclergy come into collision with the dogmatic creeds of their Churches\r\nand their ordination tests. Especially does awakened conscience rebel\r\nagainst the ironclad Calvinism of the Westminster Confession. Hence\r\nattempts, hitherto baffled, to revise the creeds; hence heresy trials,\r\nscandalous and ineffective.\r\n\r\nWho can undertake to say how far religion now influences the inner\r\nlife of the American people? Outwardly life in the United States, in\r\nthe Eastern States at least, is still religious. Churches are well\r\nmaintained, congregations are full, offertories are liberal. It is\r\nstill respectable to be a church-goer. Anglicanism, partly from its\r\nconnection with the English hierarchy, is fashionable among the wealthy\r\nin cities. We note, however, that in all pulpits there is a tendency\r\nto glide from the spiritual into the social, if not into the material;\r\nto edge away from the pessimistic view of the present world with which\r\nthe Gospels are instinct; to attend less exclusively to our future, and\r\nmore to our present state. Social reunions, picnics, and side-shows are\r\ngrowing in importance as parts of the Church system. Jonathan Edwards,\r\nif he could now come among his people, would hardly find himself at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church had come out to America in evil companionship with\r\nSpanish conquest. Together with the Spanish colonies she decayed, and\r\nher history during the past century in South America appears to have\r\nbeen that of a miserable decline which could add nothing to religious\r\nthought or history. Mexican liberalism, under the presidency of Juarez,\r\ncast off allegiance to her, and a priest dared not show himself in\r\nthe dress of his order on the street. In French Canada the Catholic\r\nChurch has reigned over a simple peasantry, her own from the beginning,\r\nthoroughly submissive to the priesthood, willing to give freely of its\r\nlittle store for the building of churches which tower over the hamlet,\r\nand sufficiently firm in its faith to throng to the fane of St. Anne\r\nBeaupré for miracles of healing. She has kept the _habitant_ ignorant\r\nand unprogressive, but made him, after her rule, moral, insisting on\r\nearly marriage, on remarriage, controlling his habits and amusements\r\nwith an almost Puritan strictness. Probably French Canada has been as\r\ngood and as happy as anything the Catholic Church had to show. The\r\npriesthood was of the Gallican school. It lived on good terms with\r\nthe state, though in French Canada the state was a conqueror. From\r\nfear of New England Puritanism it had kept its people loyal to Great\r\nBritain during the Revolutionary war. From fear of French atheism it\r\nkept its people loyal to Great Britain during the war with France.\r\nIt sang _Te Deum_ for Trafalgar. So things were till the other day.\r\nBut then came the Jesuit. He got back, from the subserviency of the\r\nCanadian politicians, the lands which he had lost after the conquest\r\nand the suppression of his Order. He supplanted the Gallicans, captured\r\nthe hierarchy and prevailed over the great Sulpician Monastery in\r\na struggle for the pastorate of Montreal. Other influences have of\r\nlate been working for change in a direction neither Gallican nor\r\nJesuit. Railroads have broken into the rural seclusion which favored\r\nthe ascendency of the priest. Popular education has made some way.\r\nNewspapers have increased in number and are more read. The peasant\r\nhas been growing restive under the burden of tithe and _fabrique_.\r\nMany of the _habitants_ go into the Northern States of the Union for\r\nwork, and return to their own country bringing with them republican\r\nideas. Americans who have been shunning continental union from dread of\r\nFrench-Canadian popery may lay aside their fears.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical moment for the Catholic Church when she undertook to\r\nextend her domain to the American Republic. She had there to encounter\r\na genius radically opposed to her own. The remnant of Catholic Maryland\r\ncould do little to help her on her landing. But she came in force with\r\nthe flood of Irish, and afterwards of South German, emigration. How\r\nfar she has been successful in holding these her lieges would be a\r\nquestion difficult to decide, as it would involve a rather impalpable\r\ndistinction between formal membership and zealous attachment. That she\r\nloses the zealous attachment of a great part of them in two or three\r\ngenerations, and that of the South Germans more quickly than that\r\nof the Irish, is what you are commonly told. Conversions of native\r\nAmericans flying from the distractions of controversy to the repose\r\nof unity under authority there have been, but the number probably has\r\nnot been large. In America, as in England, Ritualism has served Roman\r\nCatholicism as a tender. The critical question was how the religion of\r\nthe Middle Ages could succeed in making itself at home under the roof\r\nof a democratic republic, the animating spirit of which was freedom,\r\nintellectual and spiritual as well as political, while the wit of\r\nits people was proverbially keen and their nationality was jealous as\r\nwell as strong. The Papacy may call itself universal; in reality, it\r\nis Italian. During its sojourn in the French dominions the Popes were\r\nFrench; otherwise they have been Italians, native or domiciled, with\r\nthe single exception of the Flemish Adrian VI., thrust into the chair\r\nof St. Peter by his pupil, Charles V., and by the Italians treated with\r\ncontumely as an alien intruder. The great majority of the Cardinals\r\nalways has been and still is Italian. National susceptibilities,\r\ntherefore, were pretty sure to be aroused. In meeting the difficulties\r\nof her new situation Rome has shown a certain measure of pliability.\r\nShe has not thrust the intolerance and obscurantism of the encyclical\r\nin the face of the disciples of Jefferson. She has paid all due homage\r\nto republican institutions, alien though they are to her own spirit,\r\nas her uniform action in European politics hitherto has proved. She\r\nhas made little show of relics. She has abstained from miracles. The\r\nadoration of Mary and the saints, though of course fully maintained,\r\nappears to be less prominent. Compared with the mediæval cathedral and\r\nits multiplicity of side chapels, altars, and images, the cathedral\r\nat New York strikes one as the temple of a somewhat rationalized\r\nversion. Against Puritan intolerance of Popery, if any remnant of it\r\nremained, the Catholic vote has been a sufficient safeguard. To part\r\nof the American people, especially to wealthy New York, the purple of\r\nthe cardinalate and the pomp of Catholic worship have of late been by\r\nno means uncongenial. Yet between the spirit of American nationality,\r\neven in the most devout Catholic, and that of the Jesuit or the native\r\nliegeman of Rome, there cannot fail to be an opposition more or less\r\nacute, though it may be hidden as far as possible under a decent veil.\r\nThis was seen in the case of Father Hecker, who had begun his career as\r\na Socialist at Brook Farm, and, as a convert to Catholicism, founded\r\na missionary order, the keynote of which was that “man’s life in the\r\nnatural and secular order of things is marching towards freedom and\r\npersonal independence.” This he described as a radical change, and a\r\nradical change it undoubtedly was from the sentiments and the system\r\nof Loyola. Condemnation by Rome could not fail to follow. Education\r\nhas evidently been the scene of a subterranean conflict between the\r\nJesuit and the more liberal, or, what is much the same thing, the\r\nmore American section. The American and liberal head of a college\r\nhas been deposed, under decorous pretences, it is true, but still\r\ndeposed. Envoys have come out from Rome to arbitrate and compose.\r\nSome of the Catholic prelates, it appears, are very willing to show\r\ntheir liberality by co-operating in charitable work with the clergy\r\nof Protestant churches; others decline that association. One prelate,\r\nat all events, is an active politician and a conspicuous worshipper\r\nof the flag. Others strictly confine themselves to the ecclesiastical\r\nsphere. The laity in general seem to take little account of these\r\nvariations, regarding them rather as personal peculiarities than as\r\ndivisions of the Church. In the American or any other branch of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church freedom of inquiry and advance in thought are of\r\ncourse impossible. Nothing is possible but immobility, or reaction such\r\nas that of the Syllabus. Dr. Brownson, like Hecker, a convert, showed\r\nafter his conversion something of the spirit of free inquiry belonging\r\nto his former state, though rather in the line of philosophy than in\r\nthat of theology, properly speaking. But if he ever departed from\r\northodoxy he returned to it and made a perfectly edifying end.\r\n\r\nIn our survey of the religious world we are apt to leave out of sight\r\na fourth part or more of Christendom. When the Anglican Bishops some\r\nyears ago were challenged to say whether they were or were not in\r\ncommunion with the Eastern Church, that is with the Church of Russia,\r\ntheir answer was in effect that the Eastern Church was so remote that\r\nthey could not tell. The Russian Church has been and is, in truth,\r\nremote from the life, the progress, the thought, and the controversies\r\nof the other members of Christendom. It has passed through no crisis,\r\nundergone no change analogous either to the Reformation or to the Roman\r\nCatholic reaction. Such conflicts or controversies as it has had have\r\nbeen ceremonial, not doctrinal or spiritual. Its great reformer, if\r\nhe can be so called, Nicon, was a thorough-going ceremonialist and\r\ninitiated no doctrinal innovation. The movement of its non-conformists,\r\nthe Starovers, is not a counterpart of that of Protestant\r\nnon-conformists, but a ritualistic reaction. It differs theologically\r\nfrom the Roman Catholic and the Anglican churches on the article in\r\nthe Creed respecting the procession of the Holy Ghost. But its more\r\npractical grounds of difference probably are its abhorrence of images\r\nand of instrumental music and its practice of baptism by immersion.\r\nIt is more sacramental than the Roman Catholic Church, administering\r\nthe Eucharist as well as baptism to infants. While it abhors images,\r\nit adores pictures, provided they are archaic and not works of art,\r\nhaving an instinctive perception of the tendency of art to open the\r\ndoor for humanity. But it is less sacerdotal, compulsory marriage of\r\nthe clergy, instead of celibacy, being its rule. Monastic it is, but\r\nits monachism is of the Eastern and eremitic type, not like the active\r\nmonachism of the Franciscan, the Dominican, or the Jesuit. The Russian\r\nChurch is intensely national, a character stamped upon it by the long\r\nstruggle for independence against the Mohammedan Tartars. The head of\r\nthe nation is the head of the Church. The Czar is Pope, as the Emperor\r\npractically was of that Byzantine Church of which the Russian Church\r\nis the daughter. He presides over the ecclesiastical councils. The\r\nabolition of the Patriarchate removed the last rival of his power.\r\nPeter the Great, when asked to restore the office, exclaimed, “I am\r\nyour Patriarch,” flung down his hunting knife on the table, and said,\r\n“There is your Patriarch.”\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made both by Gallicans and Anglicans to negotiate a\r\nunion with the Eastern Church as a counterpoise to the Papacy. But they\r\nhave been baffled by the intense nationality and antiquated ritualism\r\nrather than by the difference about an article in the Athanasian Creed.\r\nThe upshot has been the intellectual immobility of the Russian Church,\r\nwhose compartment in the theological history of the last century is a\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nSuch is the position in which at the close of the last century\r\nChristendom seems to have stood. Outside the pale of reason—of\r\nreason; we do not say of truth—were the Roman Catholic and Eastern\r\nChurches; the Roman Catholic Church resting on tradition, sacerdotal\r\nauthority, and belief in present miracles; the Eastern Church supported\r\nby tradition, sacerdotal authority, nationality, and the power of\r\nthe Czar. Scepticism had not eaten into a Church, preserved, like\r\nthat of Russia, by its isolation and intellectual torpor; though\r\nsome wild sects had been generated, and Nihilism, threatening with\r\ndestruction the Church as well as the state, had appeared on the scene.\r\nInto the Roman Catholic Church scepticism had eaten deeply, and had\r\ndetached from her, or was rapidly detaching, the intellect of educated\r\nnations, while she seemed resolutely to bid defiance to reason by her\r\nSyllabus, her declaration of Papal infallibility, her proclamation of\r\nthe Immaculate Conception of Mary. Outside the pale of traditional\r\nauthority and amenable to reason stood the Protestant Churches,\r\nurgently pressed by a question as to the sufficiency of the evidences\r\nof supernatural Christianity, above all, of its vital and fundamental\r\ndoctrines: the Fall of Man, the Incarnation, and the Resurrection.\r\nThe Anglican Church, a fabric of policy compounded of Catholicism\r\nwithout a Pope and Biblical Protestantism, was in the throes of a\r\nstruggle between those two elements, largely antiquarian and of little\r\nimportance compared with the vital question as to the evidences of\r\nrevelation and the divinity of Christ.\r\n\r\nIn the Protestant churches generally æstheticism had prevailed. Even\r\nthe most austere of them had introduced Church art, flowers, and\r\ntasteful music; a tendency which, with the increased craving for\r\nrhetorical novelty in the pulpit, seemed to show that the simple Word\r\nof God and the glad tidings of salvation were losing their power and\r\nthat human attractions were needed to bring congregations together.\r\n\r\nThe last proposal had been that dogma, including the belief in the\r\ndivinity of Christ, having become untenable should be abandoned, and\r\nthat there should be formed a Christian Church with a ritual and\r\nsacraments, but without the Christian creed, though still looking up\r\nto Christ as its founder and teacher; an organization which, having no\r\ndefinite object and being held together only by individual fancy, would\r\nnot be likely to last long.\r\n\r\nThe task now imposed on the liegemen of reason seems to be that of\r\nreviewing reverently, but freely and impartially, the evidences both\r\nof supernatural Christianity and of theism, frankly rejecting what\r\nis untenable, and if possible laying new and sounder foundations in\r\nits place. To estimate the gravity of the crisis we have only to\r\nconsider to how great an extent our civilization has hitherto rested\r\non religion. It may be found that after all our being is an insoluble\r\nmystery. If it is, we can only acquiesce and make the best of our\r\npresent habitation; but who can say what the advance of knowledge may\r\nbring forth? Effort seems to be the law of our nature, and if continued\r\nit may lead to heights beyond our present ken. In any event, unless\r\nour inmost nature lies to us, to cling to the untenable is worse than\r\nuseless; there can be no salvation for us but in truth.\r\n\r\n  GOLDWIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\r\n\r\nRedundant chapter titles have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe name “Van ’t Hoff” always was misprinted as “Van’t Hoff” in the\r\noriginal book. That misprint has been retained here.\r\n\r\nPage 40 of the Chemistry chapter uses Dalton’s symbols for the four\r\natoms in five molecules: a circle with horizontal lines (hl), a circle\r\nwith vertical lines (vl), a circle with a dot in its center (cd), and a\r\nhollow circle (hc). If your text viewer cannot display those symbols,\r\nthe five molecules, in sequence, are: hl-cd, cd-vl-cd, vl-hc, hc-vl-hc,\r\nand cd-hc.\r\n\r\nOther pages in the Chemistry chapter contain diagrams of molecular\r\nstructures. Those diagrams only display properly when a fixed-width\r\nfont is used.\r\n\r\nSubscripts in the Chemistry chapter are shown full-height, e.g., H2O.\r\n\r\nText sometimes expresses fractions with a dash instead of a slash. That\r\nnotation has been retained here.\r\n\r\nPage 46: The original book used “Zu” as the symbol for zinc.\r\n\r\nPage 122: “entirely changed by” was printed as “charged”; changed here.\r\n\r\nPage 139: “barometric” was printed as “barometic”; changed here.",
