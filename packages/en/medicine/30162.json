Advertised with extravagant claims, their use soon spread to\r\nthe American Colonies._\r\n\r\n_To the busy settler, with little time and small means, these\r\nready-made and comparatively inexpensive \"remedies\" appealed as a\r\nsolution to problems of medical and pharmaceutical aid. Their\r\npopularity brought forth a host of American imitations and made an\r\nimpression not soon forgotten or discarded._\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHORS: _George B. Griffenhagen, formerly curator of medical\r\nsciences in the Smithsonian Institution's U.S. National Museum, is now\r\nDirector of Communications for the American Pharmaceutical Association.\r\nJames Harvey Young is professor of history at Emory University. Some of\r\nthe material cited in the paper was found by him while he held a\r\nfellowship from the Fund for the Advancement of Education, in 1954-55,\r\nand grants-in-aid from the Social Science Research Council and Emory\r\nUniversity, in 1956-57._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1824 there issued from the press in Philadelphia a 12-page pamphlet\r\nbearing the title, _Formulae for the preparation of eight patent\r\nmedicines, adopted by the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy_. The\r\nCollege was the first professional pharmaceutical organization\r\nestablished in America, having been founded in 1821, and this small\r\npublication was its first venture of any general importance. Viewed\r\nfrom the perspective of the mid-20th century, it may seem strange if\r\nnot shocking that the maiden effort of such a college should be\r\npublicizing formulas for nostrums. Adding to the novelty is the fact\r\nthat all eight of these patent medicines, with which the Philadelphians\r\nconcerned themselves half a century after American independence, were\r\nof English origin.\r\n\r\nHooper's Female Pills, Anderson's Scots Pills, Bateman's Pectoral\r\nDrops, Godfrey's Cordial, Dalby's Carminative, Turlington's Balsam of\r\nLife, Steer's Opodeldoc, British Oil--in this order do the names appear\r\nin the Philadelphia pamphlet--all were products of British therapeutic\r\ningenuity. Across the Atlantic Ocean and on American soil these eight\r\nand other old English patent medicines, as of the year when the 12-page\r\npamphlet was printed, had both a past and a future.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of English Patent Medicines\r\n\r\nWhen the Philadelphia pharmacists began their study, the eight English\r\npatent medicines were from half a century to two centuries old.[1] The\r\nmost ancient was Anderson's Scots Pills, a product of the 1630's, and\r\nthe most recent was probably Dalby's Carminative, which appeared upon\r\nthe scene in the 1780's. Some aspects of the origin and development of\r\nthese and similar English proprietaries have been treated, but a more\r\nthorough search of the sources and a more integrated and interpretive\r\nrecounting of the story would be a worthy undertaking. Here merely an\r\nintroduction can be given to the cast of characters prior to their\r\nentrances upon the American stage.\r\n\r\n      [1] Unless otherwise indicated, the early English history of\r\n      these patent medicines has been obtained from the following\r\n      sources: \"Proprietaries of other days,\" _Chemist and Druggist_,\r\n      June 25, 1927, vol. 106, pp. 831-840; C. J. S. Thompson, _The\r\n      mystery and art of the apothecary_, London, 1929; C. J. S.\r\n      Thompson, _Quacks of old London_, London, 1928; and A. C.\r\n      Wootton, _Chronicles of pharmacy_, London, 1910, 2 vols.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of Anderson's Scots Pills was fittingly enough a Scot\r\nnamed Patrick Anderson, who claimed to be physician to King Charles I.\r\nIn one of his books, published in 1635, Anderson extolled in Latin the\r\nmerits of the Grana Angelica, a pill the formula for which he said he\r\nhad learned in Venice. Before he died, Anderson imparted the secret to\r\nhis daughter Katherine, and in 1686 she in turn conveyed the secret to\r\nan Edinburgh physician named Thomas Weir. The next year Weir persuaded\r\nJames II to grant him letters patent for the pills. Whether he did\r\nthis to protect himself against competition that already had begun,\r\nor whether the patenting gave a cue to those always ready to cut\r\nthemselves in on a good thing, cannot be said for sure. The last years\r\nof the 17th century, at any rate, saw the commencement of a spirited\r\nrivalry among various makers of Anderson's Scots Pills that was long to\r\ncontinue. One of them was Mrs. Isabella Inglish, an enterprising woman\r\nwho sealed her pill boxes in black wax bearing a lion rampant, three\r\nmallets argent, and the bust of Dr. Anderson. Another was a man named\r\nGray who sealed his boxes in red wax with his coat of arms and a motto\r\nstrangely chosen for a medicine, \"Remember you must die.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--THE PHILADELPHIA COLLEGE OF PHARMACY in 1824\r\nset forth in this pamphlet formulas for eight old English patent\r\nmedicines. (_Courtesy, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science,\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania._)]\r\n\r\nCompetition already had begun when Godfrey's Cordial appeared in the\r\nrecord in a London newspaper advertisement during December 1721. John\r\nFisher of Hertfordshire, \"Physician and Chymist,\" claimed to have\r\ngotten the true formula from its originator, the late Dr. Thomas\r\nGodfrey of the same county. But there is an alternate explanation.\r\nPerhaps the Cordial had its origin in the apothecary shop established\r\nabout 1660 by Ambroise (Hanckowitz) Godfrey in Southampton Street,\r\nLondon.[2] According to a handbill issued during the late 17th century,\r\nAmbroise Godfrey prepared \"Good Cordials as Royal English Drops.\"\r\n\r\n      [2] \"How the patent medicine industry came into its own,\"\r\n      _American Druggist_, October 1933, vol. 88, pp. 84-87, 232, 234,\r\n      236, 238.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--ANTHONY DAFFY EXTOLLED THE VIRTUES OF HIS\r\nELIXIR SALUTIS in this pamphlet, published in London in 1673.\r\n(_Courtesy, British Museum._)]\r\n\r\nWith respect to his rivals, the 18th-century Hertfordshire vendor of\r\nthe Cordial warned in the _Weekly Journal_ (London), December 23, 1721:\r\n\"I do advise all Persons, for their own Safety, not to meddle with the\r\nsaid Cordial prepared by illiterate and ignorant Persons, as Bakers,\r\nMalsters, [sic] and Goldsmiths, that shall pretend to make it, it being\r\nbeyond their reach; so that by their Covetousness and Pretensions, many\r\nMen, Women, and especially Infants, may fall as Victims, whose Slain\r\nmay exceed Herod's Cruelty....\"\r\n\r\nIn 1726 King George I granted a patent for the making and selling of\r\nDr. Bateman's Pectoral Drops. The patent was given not to a doctor, but\r\nto a business man named Benjamin Okell. In the words of the patent,[3]\r\nOkell is lauded for having \"found out and brought to Perfection, a new\r\nChymicall Preparacion and Medicine..., working chiefly by Moderate\r\nSweat and Urine, exceeding all other Medicines yet found out for the\r\nRheumatism, which is highly useful under the Afflictions of the Stone,\r\nGravell, Pains, Agues, and Hysterias....\" What the chemicals\r\nconstituting his remedy were, the patentee did not vouchsafe to reveal.\r\n\r\n      [3] Benjamin Okell, \"Pectoral drops for rheumatism, gravel,\r\n      etc.,\" British patent 483, March 31, 1726.\r\n\r\nThe practice of patenting had begun in royal prerogative. Long\r\naccustomed to granting monopoly privileges for the development of new\r\nindustries, the discovery of new lands, and the enrichment of court\r\nfavorites, various monarchs in 17th-century Europe had given letters\r\npatent to proprietors of medical remedies which had gained popular\r\nacclaim. In France and the German States, this practice continued well\r\nthrough the 18th century. In England, where representative government\r\nhad progressed at the expense of the personal prerogative of the\r\nsovereign, Parliament passed a law in 1624 aimed at curbing arbitrary\r\nactions like those of James I and Charles I. The statute declared all\r\nmonopolies void except those extended to the first inventor of a new\r\nprocess of manufacture. To such pioneers the king could grant his\r\nletters patent bestowing monopoly privileges for a period of 14 years.\r\nThat the machinery set up by this law did not completely curb the\r\nindependence of English sovereigns in the medical realm is indicated by\r\nthe favor extended Dr. Weir, who successfully sought from James II a\r\nprivileged position for Anderson's Scots Pills. This kingly grant is\r\nnot included in the regular list, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688\r\nbrought an end to such an exercise of royal power without consent of\r\nParliament. A list of patents in the medical field later published by\r\nthe Commissioners of Patents[4] includes only six issued during the\r\n17th century, four for baths and devices, one for an improved method of\r\npreparing alum, and one for making epsom salts. The first patent for a\r\ncompound medicine was granted in 1711, and only two other proprietors\r\npreceded Benjamin Okell in seeking this particular legal form of\r\nprotection and promotion.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1721, Bateman's Pectoral Drops were being regularly\r\nadvertised in the _London Mercury_. The advertisements announced: \"Dr.\r\nBateman's Pectoral DROPS published at the Request of several Persons of\r\nDistinction from both Universities....\" The Drops, priced at \"1 s. a\r\nBottle,\" were \"Sold Wholesale and Retail at the Printing-house and\r\nPicture Warehouse in Bow Churchyard,\" and likewise \"in most Cities and\r\ncelebrated Towns in Great Britain.\" \"Each Bottle Seal'd with the Boar's\r\nHead.\" So stated the advertisement, which itself contained a crude cut\r\nof this Boar's Head seal.[5] Elsewhere in this issue of the _Mercury_,\r\nwe learn that John Cluer, printer, was the proprietor of the Bow\r\nChurchyard Warehouse. This same John Cluer, along with William Dicey\r\nand Robert Raikes, were named in the 1726 patent as \"the Persons\r\nconcerned with the said Inventor,\" Benjamin Okell, who, with him,\r\nshould \"enjoy the sole Benefit of the said Medicine.\" It was this\r\npartnership which was to find the field of nostrum promotion especially\r\ncongenial and which was to play an important transatlantic role. Soon\r\nafter securing their patent, the proprietors undertook to inform their\r\ncountrymen about the remedy by issuing _A short treatise of the virtues\r\nof Dr. Bateman's Pectoral Drops_.[6]\r\n\r\n      [4] British Patent Office, _Patents for inventions: abridgements\r\n      of specifications relating to medicine, surgery, and dentistry,\r\n      1620-1866_, London, 1872.\r\n\r\n      [5] _London Mercury_, London, August 19-26, 1721.\r\n\r\n      [6] _A short treatise of the virtues of Dr. Bateman's Pectoral\r\n      Drops_, New York, 1731. A 36-page pamphlet preserved in the\r\n      Library of the New York Academy of Medicine. This is an American\r\n      reprint of an English original, date unknown.\r\n\r\nIt was the 18th century, and the essay was in fashion. The proprietors\r\nprepared a didactic introduction to their treatise, phrased in long and\r\nflowery sentences, in which modesty was not the governing tone. The\r\narguments ran like this: that the \"Universal Good of Mankind\" should be\r\nthe aim of \"every private member\"; that nothing is so conducive to this\r\ngeneral welfare as \"HEALTH\"; that no hazards to health are more direful\r\nthan diseases such as \"the Gout; the Rheumatism; the Stone; the\r\nJaundice,\" etc., etc.; that countless men and women have succumbed to\r\nsuch afflictions either because they received no treatment or suffered\r\nwrong treatment at \"the Hands of the Learned\"; that no medicine is so\r\nsure a cure as that inexpensive remedy discovered as a result of great\r\n\"Piety, Learning and Industry\" by one \"inspir'd with the Love of his\r\nCountry, and the Good of Mankind,\" to wit. \"Dr. BATEMAN'S Pectoral\r\nDrops.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed seven chapters treating the multitude of illnesses for\r\nwhich the Drops were a specific. Finally, the pamphlet cited \"some few,\r\nout of the many thousands of Certificates of Cures effected by these\r\nDROPS....\" Even so early was the testimonial deemed a powerful\r\npersuader.\r\n\r\nNo more could Okell, Cluer, Dicey, and Raikes escape competition than\r\ncould the proprietors of other successful nostrums. In 1755 they went\r\nto court and won a suit for the infringement of their patent, but the\r\ndamages amounted to only a shilling. Even after the patent expired, the\r\ntide of publicity flowed on.[7]\r\n\r\n      [7] A broadside, issued in London, _ca._ 1750, advertising \"Dr.\r\n      Bateman's Drops,\" is preserved in the Warshaw Collection of\r\n      Business Americana, New York. Later reprints of this same\r\n      broadside are preserved in the private collection of Samuel Aker,\r\n      Albany, New York, and in the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nCompetition was also lively in the 1740's among some half a dozen\r\nproprietors marketing a form of crude petroleum under the name of\r\nBritish Oil. Early in the decade Michael and Thomas Betton were granted\r\na patent for \"An Oyl extracted from a Flinty Rock for the Cure of\r\nRheumatick and Scorbutick and other Cases.\" The source of the oil,\r\naccording to their specifications, was rock lying just above the coal\r\nin mines, and this rock was pulverized and heated in a furnace to\r\nextract all the precious healing oil.[8] This Betton patent aroused one\r\nof their rivals, Edmund Darby & Co. of Coalbrook-Dale in Shropshire.\r\nDarby asserted that it was presumptuous of the Bettons to call their\r\nBritish oyl a new invention.[9] For over a century Darby and his\r\npredecessors had been marketing this self-same product, and it had\r\nproved to be \"the one and only unrivall'd and most efficacious Remedy\r\never yet discovered, against the whole force of Diseases and Accidents\r\nthat await Mankind....\" For the Bettons to appropriate the process and\r\npatent it--and even to claim in their advertising cures which really\r\nhad been wrought by the Darby product--was scandalous. Worse than that,\r\nsaid Darby, it was illegal, for in 1693 William III had granted a\r\npatent to \"Martin Eele and two others at his Nomination for making the\r\nsame Sort of Oyl from the same Sort of Materials.\" Evidence to\r\nsubstantiate his belief in the Betton perfidy was presented by Darby to\r\nGeorge II, who had the matter duly investigated.[10] Being persuaded\r\nthat Darby was right, the king and his councillors, in 1745, vacated\r\nthe Betton patent. This victory seems not to have boomed the Darby\r\ninterests, and this defeat seems not to have ruined the Bettons. During\r\nthe succeeding century, the Betton patent was published and republished\r\nin advertising, just as if it had never fallen afoul the law. From\r\ntheir battles with the Oil from Coalbrook-Dale and other British Oils\r\nmarketed by other proprietors, the Bettons emerged triumphant. In the\r\nyears to come, patent or no, the Bettons British Oil was to dominate\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n      [8] Michael and Thomas Betton, \"Oil for the cure of rheumatic and\r\n      scorbutic affections,\" British patent 587, August 14, 1742.\r\n\r\n      [9] Edmund Darby & Co., _Directions for taking inwardly and using\r\n      outwardly the company's true genuine and original British Oil;\r\n      prepared by Edmund Darby & Co. at Coalbrook-Dale, Shropshire_,\r\n      ca. 1745. An 8-page pamphlet preserved in the Library of the\r\n      College of Physicians, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n      [10] _London Gazette_, London, March 1, 1745.\r\n\r\nThe year after the Bettons had secured their patent, another was\r\ngranted to John Hooper of Reading for the manufacture of \"Female Pills\"\r\nbearing his name.[11] Hooper was an apothecary, a man-midwife, and a\r\nshrewd fellow. This was the period in which the British Government was\r\nincreasing its efforts to require the patentee to furnish precise\r\nspecifications with his application.[12] When Hooper was called upon to\r\ntell what was in his pills and how they were made, he replied by\r\nasserting that they were composed \"Of the best purging stomatick and\r\nanti-hysterick ingredients,\" which were formed into pills the size of a\r\nsmall pea. This satisfied the royal agents and Hooper went on about his\r\nbusiness. In an advertisement of the same year, he was able to cite as\r\na witness to his patent the name of the Archbishop of Canterbury.[13]\r\n\r\n      [11] John Hooper, \"Pills,\" British patent 592, July 21, 1743.\r\n\r\n      [12] E. Burke Inlow, _The patent grant_, Baltimore, 1950, p. 33.\r\n\r\n      [13] _Daily Advertiser_, London, September 23, 1743.\r\n\r\nMuch less taciturn than Hooper about the composition of his nostrum was\r\nRobert Turlington, who secured a patent in 1744 for \"A specifick\r\nbalsam, called the balsam of life.\"[14] The Balsam contained no less\r\nthan 27 ingredients, and in his patent specifications Turlington\r\nasserted that it would cure kidney and bladder stones, cholic, and\r\ninward weakness. He shortly issued a 46-page pamphlet in which he\r\ngreatly expanded the list.[15] In this appeal to 18th-century\r\nsensibilities, Turlington asserted that the \"Author of Nature\" has\r\nprovided \"a Remedy for every Malady.\" To find them, \"Men of Learning\r\nand Genius\" have \"ransack'd\" the \"Animal, Mineral and Vegetable World.\"\r\nHis own search had led Turlington to the Balsam, \"a perfect Friend to\r\nNature, which it strengthens and corroborates when weak and declining,\r\nvivifies and enlivens the Spirits, mixes with the Juices and Fluids of\r\nthe Body and gently infuses its kindly Influence into those Parts that\r\nare most in Disorder.\"\r\n\r\n      [14] Robert Turlington, \"A Specifick balsam, called the balsam of\r\n      life,\" British patent 596, January 18, 1744.\r\n\r\n      [15] Robert Turlington, _Turlington's Balsam of Life_, ca. 1747.\r\n      A 46-page pamphlet preserved in the Folger Shakespeare Library,\r\n      Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--LABEL FOR STOUGHTON'S ELIXIR as manufactured\r\nby Dr. Jos. Frye of Salem, Massachusetts. (_Courtesy, Essex Institute,\r\nSalem, Massachusetts._)]\r\n\r\nTestimonials from those who had felt the kindly influence took up most\r\nof the space in Turlington's pamphlet. In these grateful\r\nacknowledgments to the potency of the patent medicine, the list of\r\nillnesses cured stretched far beyond the handful named in the patent\r\nspecifications. Just as for Bateman's Pectoral Drops and the Darby\r\nbrand of British Oil, workers of many occupations solemnly swore that\r\nthey had received benefit. Most of them were humble people--a porter, a\r\ncarpenter, the wife of a gardener, a blanket-weaver, a gunner's mate, a\r\nbutcher, a hostler, a bodice-maker. Some bore a status of greater\r\ndistinction: there were a \"Mathematical Instrument-Maker\" and the\r\ndoorkeeper of the East India Company. All were jubilant at their\r\nrestored good health.\r\n\r\nThe Balsam's well-nigh sovereign power could not protect it from one\r\nailment of the times, competition. Various preparations of similar\r\ncomposition, like Friar's Balsam, already were on the market, but\r\nbefore long even the Turlington name was trespassed upon, and the\r\ninventor's niece was forced to advertise that she alone had the true\r\nformula and that any person who took a dose of the spurious imitations\r\nbeing offered did so at great hazard to his life.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century after the patenting of the Balsam, there\r\nappeared for sale to British ailing a remedy called Dr. Steer's\r\nCelebrated Opodeldoc. Dr. Steer is a shadowy rider of a vigorous\r\nsteed, for although the doctor has left but a faint personal impact\r\nupon the historical record, Opodeldoc has pranced through medical\r\nhistory since the time of Paracelsus. This 16th-century continental\r\nchemist-physician, who introduced many mineral remedies into the\r\nmateria medica, had coined the word \"opodeldoc\" to apply to various\r\nmedical plasters. In the two ensuing centuries the meaning had\r\nchanged, and the _Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis_ of 1722 employed the\r\nterm to designate soap liniment. It is presumed that Dr. Steer\r\nappropriated the Edinburgh formula, added ammonia, and marketed his\r\nproprietary version. In 1780, a London paper carried an advertisement\r\nlisting the difficulties for which the Opodeldoc was a \"speedy and\r\ncertain cure.\" These included bruises, sprains, burns, cuts,\r\nchillblains, and headaches. Furthermore, the remedy had been \"found\r\nof infinite Use in hot Climates for the Bite of venomous\r\nInsects.\"[16] Dr. Steer seems not to have secured a patent for his\r\nslightly modified version of an official preparation. He died in\r\n1781, but Opodeldoc, indeed Steer's Opodeldoc, went marching on.[17]\r\n\r\n      [16] _Daily Advertiser_, London, February 18, 1780.\r\n\r\n      [17] Broadsides, _ca._ 1810-1822, advertising \"Steer's Chemical\r\n      Opodeldoc, for bruises, sprains, rheumatism, etc., etc.,\" are\r\n      preserved in the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester,\r\n      Massachusetts; the Library of the New York Academy of Medicine;\r\n      and the Warshaw Collection of Business Americana, New York.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Dr. Steer began advertising, newspaper\r\npromotion was launched in behalf of another remedy, called Dalby's\r\nCarminative. The inventor, J. Dalby, was a London apothecary, and his\r\nunpatented concoction was designed to cure \"Disorders of the Bowels.\"\r\nOne early advertisement[18] added details: \"This Medicine, which is\r\nfounded on just Medical Principles, has been long established as a most\r\nsafe and effectual Remedy, generally affording immediate Relief in the\r\nWind, Cholocks [_sic_], Convulsions, Purgings, and all those fatal\r\nDisorders in the Bowels of Infants, which carry off so great a number\r\nunder the age of 2 years. It is also equally efficacious in gouty Pains\r\nin the Intestines, in Fluxes, and in the cholicky Complaints of grown\r\nPersons, so usual at this Season of the Year.\" Dalby, like Steer,\r\nfailed long to survive the appearance of his medicine on the market.\r\n\r\n      [18] _Daily Advertiser_, London, January 4, 1781.\r\n\r\nSuch were the origins of the eight remedies which the Philadelphia\r\npharmacists were to take account of in 1824. Besides these eight, two\r\nother patent medicines, both elixirs, were destined for roles of such\r\nspecial interest that a brief look at their English background is\r\nwarranted.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Daffy's Elixir, was the invention of a clergyman, Rev.\r\nThomas Daffy soon after 1650. Daffy had his troubles during that\r\ntroubled century, losing a pastorate because he offended a powerful\r\nCountess. When the rector first sought to minister unto men's bodies as\r\nwell as to their souls is not known. According to a pamphlet issued in\r\n1673, after the Rev. Daffy had passed from the scene, the formula had\r\nbeen \"found out by the Providence of the Almighty.\" By this time a\r\nLondon kinsman of the inventor, named Anthony Daffy, was vending the\r\nremedy. The full name of the medicine, according to the pamphlet's\r\ntitle, was \"Elixir Salutis: The Choice Drink of Health, or\r\nHealth-Bringing Drink,\" and among the ailments for which it was\r\neffective were gout, the stone, colic, \"ptissick,\" scurvy, dropsy,\r\nrickets, consumption, and \"languishing and melancholly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Elixir Salutis proved immensely popular. It was too much to expect\r\nthat Anthony should hold the field uncontested; in the 1673 pamphlet\r\none false fabricator was called by name, and in 1680 Anthony advertised\r\nto warn against \"diverse Persons\" who were not only counterfeiting the\r\nmedicine but spreading the malicious rumor that Anthony was dead. Early\r\nin the new century, Catherine, the daughter of the original Rev. Daffy,\r\ninsisted that she as well as her cousin Anthony had received the\r\nvaluable formula. But it was Anthony's line that was to prove the more\r\npersistent. In 1743, one Susannah Daffy advertised the \"Original and\r\nFamous Elixir,\" asserting that she had a brother Anthony who also knew\r\nthe secret.[19] This Anthony died in 1750 and willed the formula to his\r\nniece. But there were others outside the family who long had been\r\nmaking and selling the medicine. For example, the Bow Churchyard\r\nWarehouse advertised Daffy's Elixir in the _London Mercury_ during\r\n1721. Without hiding the fact that others were also compounding this\r\n\"safe and pleasant Cordial ... well-known throughout England, where it\r\nhas been in great Use these 50 Years,\" the advertisement concluded:\r\n\"Those who make tryalof That sold at this [Bow Churchyard] Warehouse\r\nwill never buy anywhere else.\"[20]\r\n\r\n      [19] _Ibid._, September 7, 1743.\r\n\r\n      [20] _London Mercury_, London, August 19-26, 1721.\r\n\r\nAlthough once lauded by a physician to King Charles II, Daffy's Elixir\r\nwas never patented. The Elixir invented by Richard Stoughton was, in\r\n1712, the second compound medicine to be granted a patent in\r\nEngland.[21] Stoughton was an apothecary who had a shop at the Sign of\r\nthe Unicorn in Southwark, Surrey. It was evidently competition, the\r\nconstant bane of the medicine proprietor's life, that drove him to seek\r\ngovernmental protection. In his specifications he asserted that he had\r\nbeen making his medical mixture for over twenty years. Stoughton was\r\nless precise about his formula; indeed, he gave none, but was generous\r\nin indicating the remedy's name: \"Stoughton's Elixir Magnum Stomachii,\r\nor the Great Cordial Elixir, otherwise called the Stomatick Tincture or\r\nBitter Drops.\" In a handbill, the apothecary did tip his hand to the\r\nextent of asserting that his Elixir contained 22 ingredients, but added\r\nthat nobody but himself knew what they were. The dosage was generous,\r\n50 to 60 drops \"in a glass of Spring water, Beer, Ale, Mum, Canary,\r\nWhite wine, with or without sugar, and a dram of brandy as often as you\r\nplease.\" This, it was said, would cure any stomach ailment\r\nwhatever.[22]\r\n\r\n      [21] Richard Stoughton, \"Restorative cordial and medicine,\"\r\n      British patent 390, 1712.\r\n\r\n      [22] From a broadside, _ca._ 1750, advertising \"Dr. Stoughton's\r\n      Elixir Magnum Stomachum,\" preserved in the American Antiquarian\r\n      Society, Worcester, Mass.\r\n\r\nThe inventor died in 1726, and his passing precipitated a perfect fury\r\nof competitive advertising. As in the case of Daffy's, there was a\r\nfamily feud. A son of Stoughton and the widow of another son argued\r\nvituperously in print, each claiming sole possession of Richard's\r\ncomplicated secret, and each terming the other a scoundrel. The\r\ndaughter-in-law accused the son of financial chicanery, and the son\r\ncondemned the daughter-in-law for having run through two husbands and\r\nfor desperately wanting a third. In the midst of this running battle, a\r\nthird party entered the lists as maker of the Elixir. She was no\r\nStoughton--though a widow--and her quaint claim for the public's\r\nconsideration lay in this, that her late husband had infringed\r\nStoughton's patent until restrained by the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThese ten medicines--Stoughton's and Daffy's Elixirs and the eight\r\nwhich the Philadelphia pharmacists were later to select--were by no\r\nmeans the only packaged remedies available to the 18th-century\r\nEnglishman who resorted to self-dosage for his ills. Between 1711, when\r\nthe first patent was granted for a compound medicine, and 1776, some 75\r\nitems were patented in the medical field.[23] And, along with Godfrey's\r\nCordial and Daffy's Elixir, there were scores of other remedies for\r\nwhich no patents had been given. A list of nostrums published in _The\r\nGentleman's Magazine_ in 1748 totaled 202, and it was admittedly\r\nincomplete.[24] The proprietor with a patent might do his utmost to\r\nkeep this badge of governmental sanction before the public, but the\r\ndistinction was not great enough in such a crowded field to make things\r\nclear. The casual buyer could not keep track of which electuary had\r\nbeen granted a patent and which lozenge had not. They were all bottles\r\nand boxes upon the shelf. In use they served the same purpose. One term\r\narose in common speech to apply to both, and it was \"patent medicine.\"\r\n\r\n      [23] British Patent Office, _op. cit._ (see footnote 4).\r\n\r\n      [24] Poplicola, \"Pharmacopoeia empirica or the list of nostrums\r\n      and empirics,\" _The Gentleman's Magazine_, 1748, vol. 18, pp.\r\n      346-350.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Patent Medicines Come to America\r\n\r\nWhen the first English packaged medicine, patented or unpatented, came\r\nto the New World, cannot be told. Some 17th-century prospective\r\ncolonist, setting forth to face the hazards of life in Jamestown or\r\nBaltimore or Boston, must have packed a box of Anderson's Scots Pills\r\nor a bottle of Daffy's Elixir to bring along, but no record to\r\nsubstantiate such an incident has been encountered. It would seem that\r\nthe use of English packaged remedies in America was most infrequent\r\nbefore 1700. Samuel Lee, answering questions posed from England in 1690\r\nabout the status of medicine and pharmacy in Massachusetts, mentions no\r\npatent medicines.[25] Neither does the 1698 account book of the Salem\r\napothecary, Bartholomew Brown.[26]\r\n\r\n      [25] George L. Kittredge, \"Letters to Samuel Lee and Samuel\r\n      Sewall relating to New England and the Indians,\" _Colonial\r\n      Society of Massachusetts, Transactions_, 1913, vol. 14, pp.\r\n      142-186.\r\n\r\n      [26] Bartholomew Brown, Apothecary day book, Salem [1698];\r\n      manuscript original preserved in the Library of the Essex\r\n      Institute, Salem, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--PATRICK ANDERSON, M.D., from a box of\r\nAnderson's Scots Pills. From Wootton's _Chronicles of pharmacy_,\r\nLondon, 1910. (_Smithsonian photo 44286-C._)]\r\n\r\nIn the _Boston News-Letter_ for October 4, 1708, Nicholas Boone, at the\r\nSign of the Bible, near the corner, of School-House-Lane, advertised\r\nfor sale: \"DAFFY'S Elixir Salutis, very good, at four shillings and\r\nsixpence _per_ half pint Bottle.\" This may well be the first printed\r\nreference in America to an English patent medicine, and it certainly is\r\nthe first newspaper advertisement for a nostrum. Preceding the\r\n_News-Letter_ in colonial America, there had been only one paper, the\r\n_Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_.[27] This journal had\r\nlasted but a single issue. Then its printer had returned to England,\r\nwhere he took up the career of a patent medicine promoter, vending \"the\r\nonly Angelical Pills against all Vapours, Hysterick Fits.\" The\r\n_News-Letter_ had begun with the issue of April 27, 1704, about 4 years\r\nbefore Boone's advertisement for Daffy's remedy made its appearance,\r\nbut during that time, only one advertisement for anything at all in the\r\nmedical field had appeared, and that was for a home-remedy book, _The\r\nEnglish physician_, by Nicholas Culpeper, Doctor of Physick.[28] This\r\nvolume was also for sale at Boone's shop.\r\n\r\n      [27] Frank L. Mott, _American journalism_, New York, 1941, pp.\r\n      9-10.\r\n\r\n      [28] _Boston News-Letter_, Boston, February 9, 1708.\r\n\r\nPatent-medicine advertising in the _News-Letter_ prior to 1750 was\r\ninfrequent. Apothecary Zabdiel Boylston, who a decade later was to earn\r\na role of esteem in medical history by introducing the inoculation for\r\nsmallpox, announced in 1711 that he would sell \"the true Lockyers\r\nPills.\"[29] This was an unpatented remedy first concocted half a\r\ncentury earlier by a \"licensed physitian\" in London. The next year\r\nBoylston repeated this appeal,[30] and in the same advertisement listed\r\nother wares of the same type. He had two varieties, Golden and Plain,\r\nof the Spirit of Scurvy-Grass; he had \"The Bitter Stomach Drops,\" worm\r\npotions for children; and a wonderful multipurpose nostrum, \"the Royal\r\nHoney Water, an Excellent Perfume, good against Deafness, and to Make\r\nHair grow....\" The antecedents of this regal liquid are unknown.\r\nBoylston also announced for sale \"The Best [Daffy's] Elixir Salutis in\r\nBottles, or by the Ounce.\" This is a provocative listing. It may mean\r\nmerely that the apothecary would break a bottle to sell a dose of the\r\nElixir, which was often the custom. But it also may suggest that\r\nBoylston was making the Elixir himself, or was having it prepared by a\r\njourneyman. This latter interpretation would place Boylston well at the\r\nhead of a long parade of American imitators of the old English patent\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n      [29] _Ibid._, March 12, 1711.\r\n\r\n      [30] _Ibid._, March 24, 1712.\r\n\r\nOther such shipments of the packaged English remedies may have come to\r\nNew England on the latest ships from London during the next several\r\ndecades, but they got scant play in the advertising columns of the\r\nsmall 4-page _Boston News-Letter_. Another reference to \"Doctor Anthony\r\nDaffey's Original Elixer Salutis\" occurs in 1720.[31] Ten years later,\r\nStoughton's Drops were announced for sale \"by Public Vendue,\" along\r\nwith feather beds, looking glasses, and leather breeches.[32] Nearly a\r\ndecade more was to pass before Bateman's Pectoral Drops showed up in\r\nthe midst of another general list, including cheese, and shoes, and\r\nstays.[33] Not until 1748 did an advertisement appear in which several\r\nof the old English nostrums rubbed shoulders with each other.[34] Then\r\nSilvester Gardiner, at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, asserted\r\nthat \"by appointment of the Patentee\" he was enabled to sell \"Genuine\r\nBritish Oyl, _Bateman's_ Pectoral Drops, and _Hooper's_ Female Pills,\r\nand the True _Lockyer's_ Pills.\"\r\n\r\n      [31] _Ibid._, November 14, 1720.\r\n\r\n      [32] _Ibid._, March 12, 1730.\r\n\r\n      [33] _Ibid._, January 4, 1739.\r\n\r\n      [34] _Ibid._, November 14, 1748.\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly a century old, Anderson's Scots Pills were not cited\r\nfor sale in the pages of the _Boston News-Letter_ until August 23,\r\n1750, two months after the much more recent Turlington's Balsam of Life\r\nfirst put in its appearance.[35] During the same year, the British\r\nconfusion over British Oil was reflected in America. Boden's and\r\nDarby's variety preceded the Betton brand into the _News-Letter_ pages\r\nby a fortnight.[36] It was the latter, however, which was to win the\r\nday in Boston, for almost all subsequent advertising specified the\r\nBetton Oil. Godfrey's Cordial was first mentioned in 1761.[37] Thus, of\r\nthe ten old English patent medicines which are the focus of the present\r\nstudy, eight had been advertised in the _Boston News-Letter_. The other\r\ntwo, Steer's Opodeldoc and Dalby's Carminative, did not reach the\r\nmarket before this colonial journal fell prey to the heightening\r\ntensions of early 1776.\r\n\r\n      [35] _Ibid._, June 7, 1750.\r\n\r\n      [36] _Ibid._, May 24, 1750.\r\n\r\n      [37] _Ibid._, December 31, 1761.\r\n\r\nBy the 1750's, the names of several old English nostrums were appearing\r\nfairly frequently in the advertising of colonial apothecaries, not only\r\nin Boston but in other colonial towns. In Williamsburg, for example, a\r\nsteady increase occurs in the number of references and the length of\r\nthe lists of the English patent medicines advertised in the _Virginia\r\nGazette_ from their first mention into the early 1760's.[38] This\r\njournal--which later had competing issues by different editors--was\r\nlaunched in 1736, and the next year George Gilmer advised customers\r\nthat, in addition to \"all manner of Chymical and Galenical Medicines,\"\r\nhe could furnish, at his old shop near the Governor's, \"Bateman's\r\nDrops, Squires Elixir, Anderson's Pills.\"[39] The other remedies\r\nappeared in due time, Stoughton's and Daffy's Elixirs in 1745,\r\nTurlington's Balsam in 1746, Godfrey's Cordial in 1751, Hooper's Pills\r\nin 1752, and Betton's British Oil in 1770.\r\n\r\n      [38] Lester J. Cappon and Stella F. Duff, _Virginia Gazette\r\n      index, 1736-1780_, Williamsburg, 1950, 2 vols.\r\n\r\n      [39] _Virginia Gazette_, Williamsburg, May 27, 1737.\r\n\r\nA spot check of newspapers in Philadelphia and New York reveals a\r\npattern quite similar. Residents of the middle colonies, like those to\r\nthe north and the south, could buy the basic English brands, and it was\r\nduring the 1750's that the notices of freshly-arrived supplies ceased\r\nto be rare in advertising columns and became a frequent occurrence.\r\nThomas Preston, for example, announced to residents of Philadelphia in\r\n1768 that he had just received a supply of Anderson's, Hooper's,\r\nBateman's, Betton's, Daffy's, Stoughton's, Turlington's, and Godfrey's\r\nremedies.[40] Not only were these medicines for sale at apothecary\r\nshops, but they were sold by postmasters, goldsmiths, grocers, hair\r\ndressers, tailors, printers, booksellers, cork cutters, the post-rider\r\nbetween Philadelphia and Williamsburg, and by many colonial American\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\n      [40] _Pennsylvania Gazette_, Philadelphia, December 1, 1768.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for comment that American newspaper advertising of the\r\nEnglish packaged medicines was singularly drab. In the mother country,\r\nthe proprietors or their heirs were faced with vigorous competition. It\r\nbehooved them to sharpen up their adjectives and reach for their\r\nvitriol. In America the apothecary or merchant had no proprietary\r\ninterest in any of the different brands of the imported medicines which\r\nwere sold. Moreover, there was probably no great surplus of supply over\r\ndemand in America as in Britain, so the task of selling the stock on\r\nhand was less difficult and required less vigorous promotion. Also,\r\nadvertising space in the few American weeklies was more at a premium\r\nthan in the more frequent and numerous English journals. With rare\r\nexceptions, therefore, the old English patent medicines were merely\r\nmentioned by name in American advertising. Seldom did one receive the\r\nindividual attention accorded by Samuel Emlen to Godfrey's Cordial in\r\nBenjamin Franklin's _Pennsylvania Gazette_ for June 26, 1732. The ad\r\nran like this:\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Godfrey's General Cordial. So universally approved of for the\r\n    Cholick, and all Manners cf Pains in the Bowels, Fluxes, Fevers,\r\n    Small-Pox, Measles, Rheumatism, Coughs, Colds, and Restlessness in\r\n    Men, Women, and Children; and particularly for several Ailments\r\n    incident to Child-bearing Women, and Relief of young Children in\r\n    breeding their Teeth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--PAMPHLET, DATED 1731, ON BEHALF OF BATEMAN'S\r\nPECTORAL DROPS. It was published by John Peter Zenger in New York.\r\nOriginal preserved in the New York Academy of Medicine Library.\r\n(_Smithsonian photo 44286-D._)]\r\n\r\nEmlen's venturesomeness may have lain in the fact that he was not only\r\na retailer, but also an agent for the British manufacturer, for he\r\ncited the names of those who sold Godfrey's Cordial in nearby towns.\r\nEven at that, this appeal, consisting merely of a list of illnesses,\r\nlacked the cleverness of contemporary English nostrum advertising. In\r\nthe whole span of the _Boston News-Letter_, beginning in 1704, it was\r\nnot until 1763 that a bookstore pulled out the stops with half a column\r\nof lively prose in behalf of Dr. Hill's four unpatented nostrums.[41]\r\nIt seems a safe assumption that not only the medicines but the verbiage\r\nwere imported from London, where Dr. Hill had been at work endeavoring\r\nto restore a Greek secret which \"converts a Glass of Water into the\r\nNature and Quality of Asses Milk, with the Balsamick Addition....\"\r\n\r\n      [41] _Boston News-Letter_, Boston, November 24, 1763.\r\n\r\nThe infrequency of extended fanciful promotion in behalf of the old\r\nEnglish nostrums in American newspaper advertising may have been\r\ncompensated for to some degree in broadside and pamphlet. A critic of\r\nthe medical scene in New York in the early 1750's asserted that\r\nphysicians used patent medicines which they learned about from \"London\r\nquack bills.\" This doctor complained, these were often their only\r\nreading matter.[42] Such a judgment may be too severe. Certainly it is\r\ndifficult to validate today. Such pamphlets and broadsides do appear in\r\nAmerican archival collections. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania\r\ncontains a 2-page Turlington broadside,[43] while the Folger\r\nShakespeare Library in Washington has an earlier 46-page Turlington\r\npamphlet with testimonials reaching out toward America.[44] One such\r\ncertificate came from \"a sailor before the mast, on board the ship\r\nBritannia in the New York trade,\" and another cited a woman living in\r\nPhiladelphia who gave thanks for the cure of her dropsy.\r\n\r\n      [42] James J. Walsh, _History of the Medical Society of the State\r\n      of New York_, New York, 1907.\r\n\r\n      [43] Robert Turlington, \"Turlington's Balsam of Life,\" 1755-1757.\r\n      A later reprint of this same circular is preserved in the Warshaw\r\n      Collection of Business Americana.\r\n\r\n      [44] _Turlington's Balsam of Life_ (see footnote 15).\r\n\r\nA broadside in the Warshaw Collection touting Bateman's Drops noted\r\nthat \"extraordinary demands have been made for Maryland, New-York,\r\nJamaica, etc. where their virtues have been truely experienced with the\r\ngreatest satisfaction.\"[45] That such promotional items are extremely\r\nrare does not mean they were not abundant in the mid-18th century, for\r\nthis type of printed matter, then as now, was likely to be looked at\r\nand thrown away. A certain amount of nostrum literature was undoubtedly\r\nimported from Britain. For example, in 1753 apothecary James Carter of\r\nWilliamsburg ordered from England \"3 Quire Stoughton's Directions\"\r\nalong with \"1/2 Groce Stoughton Vials.\"[46] These broadsides or\r\ncirculars served a twofold purpose. Not only did they promote the\r\nmedicine, but they actually served as the labels for the bottles. Early\r\npackages of these patent medicines which have been discovered indicate\r\nthat paper labels were seldom applied to the glass bottles; instead,\r\nthe bottle was tightly wrapped and sealed in one of these broadsides.\r\n\r\n      [45] \"Dr. Bateman's Drops\" (see footnote 7).\r\n\r\n      [46] James Carter, Apothecary account book, Williamsburg\r\n      [1752-1773]. Manuscript original preserved at Colonial\r\n      Williamsburg, Virginia.\r\n\r\nAmerican imprints seeking to promote the English patent medicines were\r\ncertainly rare. The most significant example may be found in the\r\nLibrary of the New York Academy of Medicine.[47] In 1731 James Wallace,\r\na New York merchant, became American agent for the sale of Dr.\r\nBateman's Pectoral Drops. To help him with his new venture, Wallace\r\ntook a copy of the London promotional pamphlet to a New York printer to\r\nbe reproduced. The printer was John Peter Zenger, not yet an editor and\r\nthree years away from the events which were to link his name\r\ninextricably with the concept of the freedom of the press. This 1731\r\npamphlet may well have been the earliest work on any medical theme to\r\nbe printed in New York.[48]\r\n\r\n      [47] _A short treatise of the virtues of Dr. Bateman's Pectoral\r\n      Drops_ (see footnote 6).\r\n\r\n      [48] Gertrude L. Annan, \"Printing and medicine,\" _Bulletin of the\r\n      Medical Library Association_, March 1940, vol. 28, p. 155.\r\n\r\nNow and then a physician might frown on his fellows for reading such\r\nliterature and prescribing such remedies, but he was in a minority.\r\nColonial doctors, by and large, had no qualms about employing the\r\npackaged medicines. It was a doctor who first advertised Anderson's\r\nPills and Bateman's Drops in Williamsburg;[49] it was another,\r\nmigrating from England to the Virginia frontier, who founded a town and\r\ndosed those who came to dwell therein with Bateman's Drops,\r\nTurlington's Balsam, and other patent medicines.[50]\r\n\r\n      [49] Wyndham B. Blanton, _Medicine in Virginia in the eighteenth\r\n      century_, Richmond, Virginia, 1931, pp. 33-34.\r\n\r\n      [50] Maurice Bear Gordon, _Aesculapius comes to the colonies_,\r\n      Ventnor, New Jersey, 1949, p. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplex Formulas and Distinctive Packages\r\n\r\nIndeed, the status of medical knowledge, medical need, and medical\r\nethics in the 18th century permitted patent medicines to fit quite\r\ncomfortably into the environment. As to what actually caused diseases,\r\nman knew little more than had the ancient Greeks. There were many\r\ntheories, however, and the speculations of the learned often sound as\r\nquaint in retrospect as do the cocky assertions of the quack bills.\r\nPamphlet warfare among physicians about their conflicting theories\r\nachieved an acrimony not surpassed by the competing advertisers of\r\nStoughton's Elixir. The aristocratic practitioners of England, the\r\nLondon College of Physicians, refused to expand their ranks even at a\r\ntime when there were in the city more than 1,300 serious cases of\r\nillness a day to every member of the College. The masses had to\r\nlook elsewhere, and turned to apothecaries, surgeons, quacks, and\r\nself-treatment.[51] The lines were drawn even less sharply in colonial\r\nAmerica, and there was no group to resemble the London College in\r\nprestige and authority. Medical laissez-faire prevailed. \"Practitioners\r\nare laureated gratis with a title feather of Doctor,\" wrote a New\r\nEnglander in 1690. \"Potecaries, surgeons & midwifes are dignified\r\nacc[ording] to successe.\"[52] Such an atmosphere gave free rein to\r\nself-dosage, either with an herbal mixture found in the pages of a\r\nhome-remedy book or with Daffy's Elixir.\r\n\r\n      [51] Fielding H. Garrison, _An introduction to the history of\r\n      medicine_, Philadelphia, 1924, pp. 405-408; and Richard H.\r\n      Shryock. _The development of modern medicine_, New York, 1947,\r\n      pp. 51-54.\r\n\r\n      [52] Kittredge, _op. cit._ (footnote 25).\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, drugs were still prescribed that dated back to the\r\ndawn of medicine. There were Theriac or Mithridatum, Hiera Picra (or\r\nHoly Bitters), and Terra Sigillata. Newer botanicals from the Orient\r\nand the New World, as well as the \"chymicals\" reputedly introduced by\r\nParacelsus, found their way into these ancient formulas. Since the\r\nprecise action of individual drugs in relation to given ailments was\r\nbut hazily known, there was a tendency to blanket assorted\r\npossibilities by mixing numerous ingredients into the same formula. The\r\nformularies of the Middle Ages encouraged this so-called\r\n\"polypharmacy.\" For example the _Antidotarium Nicolai_, written about\r\nA.D. 1100 at Salerno, described 38 ingredients in Confectio Adrianum,\r\n35 ingredients in Confectio Atanasia, and 48 ingredients in Confectio\r\nEsdra. Theriac or Mithridatum grew in complexity until by the 16th\r\ncentury it had some 60 different ingredients.\r\n\r\nIt was in this tradition of complex mixtures that most of the patent\r\nmedicines may be placed. Richard Stoughton claimed 22 ingredients for\r\nhis Elixir, and Robert Turlington, in his patent specification, named\r\n27. Although other proprietors had shorter lists or were silent on the\r\nnumber of ingredients, a major part of their secrecy really lay in\r\nhaving complicated formulas. Even though rivals might detect the major\r\nactive ingredients, the original proprietor could claim that only he\r\nknew all the elements in their proper proportions and the secret of\r\ntheir blending.\r\n\r\nNot only in complexity did the patent medicines resemble regular\r\npharmaceutical compounds of the 18th century. In the nature of their\r\ncomposition they were blood brothers of preparations in the various\r\npharmacopoeias and formularies. Indeed, there was much borrowing in\r\nboth directions. An official formula of one year might blossom out the\r\nnext in a fancy bottle bearing a proprietor's name. At the same time,\r\nthe essential recipe of a patent medicine, deprived of its original\r\ncognomen and given a Latin name indicative of its composition or\r\ntherapeutic nature, might suddenly appear in one of the official\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nFor example, the formula for Daffy's Elixir was adopted by the\r\n_Pharmacopoeia Londinensis_ in 1721 under the title of \"Elixir Salutis\"\r\nand later by the _Pharmacopoeia Edinburghensis_ as \"Tinctura sennae\r\ncomposita\" (Compound Senna Tincture). Similarly the essential formula\r\nfor Stoughton's Elixir was adopted by the _Pharmacopoeia\r\nEdinburghensis_ as early as 1762 under the name of \"Elixir Stomachium,\"\r\nand later as \"Compound Tincture of Gentian\" (as in the _Pharmacopoeia\r\nof the Massachusetts Medical Society_ of 1808). Only two years after\r\nTurlington obtained his \"Balsam of Life\" patent, the _Pharmacopoeia\r\nLondinensis_ introduced a recipe under the title of \"Balsamum\r\nTraumaticum\" which eventually became Compound Tincture of Benzoin, with\r\nthe synonym Turlington's Balsam. On the other hand, none of these early\r\nEnglish patent medicines, including Stoughton's Elixir and Turlington's\r\nBalsam, offered anything new, except possibly new combinations or new\r\nproportions of ingredients already widely employed in medicine.\r\nFormulas similar in composition to those patented or marketed as \"new\r\ninventions\" can in every case be found in such 17th-century\r\npharmacopoeias as William Salmon's _Pharmacopoeia Londinensis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--BOTTLES OF BATEMAN'S PECTORAL DROPS, 19th\r\ncentury (left) and early 20th century (right), from the Samuel Aker,\r\nDavid and George Kass collection, Albany, New York. (_Smithsonian photo\r\n44287-A._)]\r\n\r\nWhatever similarities existed between the canons of regular pharmacy\r\nand the composition of patent medicines, there was a decided difference\r\nin the methods of marketing. Although patent medicines were often\r\nprescription items, they did not have to be. The way they looked on a\r\nshelf made them so easily recognizable that even the most loutish\r\nilliterate could tell one from another. As the nostrum proprietor did\r\nso much to pioneer in advertising psychology, so he also blazed a trail\r\nwith respect to distinctive packaging. The popularity of the old\r\nEnglish remedies, year in and year out, owed much to the fact that\r\nthough the ingredients inside might vary (unbeknownst to the customer),\r\nthe shape of the bottle did not. This was the reason proprietors raised\r\nsuch a hue and cry about counterfeiters. The secret of a formula might,\r\nif only to a degree, be retained, but simulation of bottle design and\r\nprinted wrapper was easily accomplished, and to the average customer\r\nthese externals were the medicine.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental fact was to be recognized by the committee of\r\nPhiladelphia pharmacists in 1824. \"We are aware\" the committeemen\r\nreported, \"that long custom has so strongly associated the idea of the\r\ngenuineness of the Patent medicines, with particular shapes of the\r\nvials that contain them, and with certain printed labels, as to render\r\nan alteration in them an affair of difficulty. Many who use these\r\npreparations would not purchase British Oil that was put up in a\r\nconical vial, nor Turlington's Balsam in a cylindrical one. The stamp\r\nof the excise, the king's royal patent, the seal and coat of arms which\r\nare to prevent counterfeits, the solemn caution against quacks and\r\nimposters, and the certified lists of incredible cures, [all these were\r\nprinted on the bottle wrappers] have not even now lost their\r\ninfluence.\" Nor were they for years to come.\r\n\r\nThus after 1754 the Turlington Balsam bottle was pear-shaped, with\r\nsloping shoulders, and molded into the glass in crude raised capitals\r\nwere the proprietor's name and his claim of THE KINGS ROYAL PATENT.[53]\r\nTurlington during his life had made one modification. He explained it\r\nin a broadside, saying that \"to prevent the Villainy of some Persons\r\nwho buying up my empty Bottles, have basely and wickedly put therein a\r\nvile spurious Counterfeit-Sort,\" he had changed the bottle shape. The\r\ndate molded into the glass on his supply of new genuine bottles was\r\nJanuary 26, 1754.[54] This was, perhaps, a very fine point of\r\ndifference from the perspective of the average customer, and in any\r\ncase the bottle was hidden under its paper wrapper.\r\n\r\n      [53] \"From past times an original bottle of Turlington's Balsam,\"\r\n      _Chemist and Druggist_, September 23, 1905, vol. 67, p. 525;\r\n      Stewart Schackne, \"Bottles,\" _American Druggist_, October 1933,\r\n      vol. 88, pp. 78-81, 186-188, 190, 194; Frederick Fairchild\r\n      Sherman, \"Some early bottles,\" _Antiques_, vol. 3, pp. 122-123;\r\n      and Stephen Van Rensselaer, _Early American bottles and flasks_,\r\n      Peterborough, New Hampshire, 1926.\r\n\r\n      [54] Waldo R.

At least one brand of Daffy's Elixir was packaged in a\r\nglobular bottle, according to a picture in a 1743 advertisement.[58]\r\nSpeculation regarding the size and shape of the Stoughton bottle\r\nvaries.[59] At least one Stoughton bottle was described as \"Round\r\namber.

On the lid of the box containing\r\nHooper's Pills was stamped this inscription: DR. JOHN HOOPER'S FEMALE\r\nPILLS: BY THE KING'S PATENT 21 JULY 1743 NO. 592. So far no example or\r\nillustration of Anderson's Scots Pills has been found. At least one\r\nproducer, it will be remembered (page 157), sealed the box in black wax\r\nbearing a lion rampant, three mallets argent, and the bust of Dr.\r\nAnderson.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource of Supply Severed\r\n\r\nOn September 29, 1774, John Boyd's \"medicinal store\" in Baltimore\r\nfollowed the time-honored custom of advertising in the _Maryland\r\nGazette_ a fresh supply of medicines newly at hand from England. To\r\nthis intelligence was added a warning. Since nonimportation agreements\r\nby colonial merchants were imminent, which bade fair to make goods hard\r\nto get, customers would be wise to make their purchases before the\r\nsupply became exhausted. Boyd's prediction was sound. The Boston Tea\r\nParty of the previous December had evoked from Parliament a handful of\r\nrepressive measures, the Intolerable Acts, and at the time of Boyd's\r\nadvertisement, the first Continental Congress in session was soon to\r\ndeclare that all imports from Great Britain should be halted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--BOTTLES OF BRITISH OIL, 19th and early 20th\r\ncentury, from the Samuel Aker, David and George Kass collection,\r\nAlbany, New York. (_Smithsonian photo 44201-B._)]\r\n\r\nThis Baltimore scare advertising may well have been heeded by Boyd's\r\ncustomers, for trade with the mother country had been interrupted\r\nbefore; in the wake of the Townshend Acts in 1767, when Parliament had\r\nplaced import duties on various products, including tea, American\r\nmerchants in various cities had entered into nonimportation agreements.\r\nCertainly, there was a decided decrease in the Boston advertising of\r\npatent medicines received from London. With respect to imports of any\r\nkind, it became necessary to explain, and one merchant noted that his\r\ngoods were \"the Remains of a Consignment receiv'd before the\r\nNon-Importation Agreement took place.\"[61] When Parliament yielded to\r\nthe financial pressure and abolished all the taxes but the one on tea,\r\nnonimportation collapsed. This fact is reflected in an advertisement\r\nlisting nearly a score of patent medicines, including the remedies of\r\nTurlington, Bateman, the Bettons, Anderson, Hooper, Godfrey, Daffy, and\r\nStoughton, as \"Just come to Hand and Warranted Genuine\" on Captain\r\nDane's ship, \"directly from the Original Warehouse kept by DICEY and\r\nOKELL in Bow Street, London.\"[62]\r\n\r\n      [61] _Massachusetts Gazette_, Boston, December 21, 1769.\r\n\r\n      [62] _Ibid._, April 25, 1771.\r\n\r\nThe days of such ample importations, however, were doomed, as commerce\r\nfell prey to the growing revolutionary agitation. The last medical\r\nadvertisement in the _Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly\r\nNews-Letter_, before its demise the following February, appeared five\r\nmonths after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[63] The apothecary\r\nat the Sign of the Unicorn was frank about the situation. He had\r\nimported fresh drugs and medicines every fall and spring up to the\r\npreceding June. He still had some on hand. Doctors and others should be\r\nadvised.\r\n\r\n      [63] _Ibid._, September 7, 1775.\r\n\r\nImplicit in the advertisement is the suggestion that the securing of\r\nnew supplies under the circumstances would be highly uncertain. That\r\npre-war stocks did hold out, sometimes well into the war years may be\r\ndeduced from a Williamsburg apothecary's advertisement.[64] W. Carter\r\ntook the occasion of the ending of a partnership with his brother to\r\npublish a sort of inventory. Along with the \"syrup and ointment pots,\r\nall neatly painted and lettered,\" the crabs eyes and claws, the Spanish\r\nflies, he listed a dozen patent medicines, including the remedies of\r\nAnderson, Bateman, and Daffy.\r\n\r\n      [64] _Virginia Gazette_ (edited by Dixon and Nicholson),\r\n      Williamsburg, June 12, 1779.\r\n\r\nEven the British blockade failed to prevent patent medicines from being\r\nshipped from wholesaler to retailer. In the account book of a Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, apothecary,[65] the following entry appears:\r\n\r\n    4 cases Containing\r\n        1 Dozn Bottles Godfreys Cordial             4/\r\n        5 Dozn   Do    Smaller Turling Bals        18/\r\n        8 Dozn Bettons British Oil                  8/\r\n        6-1/2 Dozn Hoopers Female Pills            10/\r\n        4 Dozn nd 8 Boxs And.

(_Smithsonian\r\nphoto 44287-C._)]\r\n\r\nThe sloop was undoubtedly one of the small coastal type ships employed\r\nby the colonists, and the British blockade required such ominous\r\nprecautions as \"unmarked cases\" and \"ship'd by Night.\"\r\n\r\nSuch random assortments of prewar importations could hardly have met\r\nthe American demand for the old English patent medicines created by a\r\nhalf century of use. Doubtless many embattled farmers had to confront\r\ntheir ailments without the accustomed English-made remedies. However,\r\nas early as the 1750's, at least two of the English patent medicines,\r\nDaffy's and Stoughton's Elixirs, were being compounded in the\r\ncolonies and packaged in empty bottles shipped from England.\r\nApothecary Carter of Williamsburg ordered sizable quantities of empty\r\n\"Stoughton Vials\" from 1752 through 1770, and occasionally ordered\r\nempty Daffy's bottles.[66] In 1774 apothecary Waldo of Salem noted\r\nthe receipt from England of \"1 Groce Stoughton Phials\" and \"1 Groce\r\nDaffy's Do.\"[67] Joseph Stansbury, who sold china and glass in\r\nPhiladelphia, advertised \"Daffy's Elixir Bottles\" a week after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.[68] Stoughton's and Daffy's Elixirs,\r\ntherefore, were being compounded by the American apothecaries during\r\nthe Revolutionary War. Formulas for both preparations were official\r\nin the London and Edinburgh pharmacopoeias, as well as in unofficial\r\nformularies like Quincy's _Pharmacopoeias officinalis extemporanea_\r\nof 1765. All these publications were used widely by American\r\nphysicians and apothecaries.\r\n\r\n      [66] Carter, _op. cit._ (footnote 46).\r\n\r\n      [67] Waldo, _op. cit._ (footnote 65).\r\n\r\n      [68] _Pennsylvania Gazette_, Philadelphia, July 11, 1776.\r\n\r\nIt is not known how extensively, during the struggle for independence,\r\nthis custom was adopted for English patent medicines other than Daffy's\r\nand Stoughton's. However, imitation of English patent medicines in\r\nAmerica was to increase, and it contributed to the chaos that beset the\r\nnostrum field when the war was over and the original articles from\r\nEngland were once more available. And they were bought. An\r\nadvertisement at a time when the fighting was over and peace\r\nnegotiations were still under way indicated that the Baltimore post\r\noffice had half a dozen of the familiar English remedies for sale.[69]\r\nTwo years later a New York store turned to tortured rhyme to convey the\r\nsame message:[70]\r\n\r\n    Medicines approv'd by royal charter,\r\n    James, Godfry, Anderson, Court-plaster,\r\n    With Keyser's, Hooper's Lockyer's Pills,\r\n    And Honey Balsam Doctor Hill's;\r\n    Bateman and Daffy, Jesuits drops,\r\n    And all the Tinctures of the shops,\r\n    As Stoughton, Turlington and Grenough,\r\n    Pure British Oil and Haerlem Ditto....\r\n\r\n      [69] _Maryland Journal and Baltimore Gazette_, Baltimore, October\r\n      29, 1782.\r\n\r\n      [70] _New York Packet and the American Advertiser_, New York,\r\n      October 11, 1784.\r\n\r\nLater in the decade, the Salem apothecary, Jonathon Waldo, made a list\r\nof \"An assortment [of patent medicines] Usually Called For.\" The\r\nimported brand of Turlington's Balsam, Waldo stated, was \"very dear\" at\r\n36 shillings a dozen, adding that his \"own\" was worth but 15 shillings\r\nfor the same quantity. The English original of another nostrum, Essence\r\nof Peppermint, he listed at 18 shillings a dozen, his own at a mere\r\n10/6.[71] Despite the price differential, importations continued. A\r\nBeverly, Massachusetts, druggist, Robert Rantoul, in 1799 ordered from\r\nLondon filled boxes and bottles of Anderson's Pills, Bateman's Drops,\r\nSteer's Opodeldoc, and Turlington's Balsam, along with the empty vials\r\nin which to put British Oil and Essence of Peppermint.[72] For decades\r\nthereafter the catalogs of wholesale drug firms continued to specify\r\ntwo grades of various patent medicines for sale, termed \"English\" and\r\n\"American,\" \"true\" and \"common,\" or \"genuine\" and \"imitation.\"[73] This\r\nhad not been the case in patent medicine listings of 18th-century\r\ncatalogs.[74]\r\n\r\n      [71] Waldo, _op. cit._ (footnote 65).\r\n\r\n      [72] Robert Rantoul, Apothecary daybooks, 3 vols., Beverly,\r\n      Massachusetts [1796-1812].

It\r\nwill be remembered that 60 years earlier William Dicey, John Cluer, and\r\nRobert Raikes were the group of entrepreneurs who had aided Benjamin\r\nOkell in patenting the pectoral drops bearing Bateman's name. Then and\r\nthroughout the century, this concern continued to operate a warehouse\r\nin the Bow Churchyard, Cheapside, London. In 1721, it was known as the\r\n\"Printing-house and Picture Warehouse\" of John Cluer, printer,[75] but\r\nby 1790, it was simply the \"Medicinal Warehouse\" of Bow Churchyard,\r\nCheapside. This address lay in the center of the London area whence\r\ncame nearly all of the British goods exported to America.[76] It had\r\nbeen the location of many merchants who had migrated to New England in\r\nthe 17th century, and these newcomers had done business with their\r\nerstwhile associates who did not leave home. Thus were started trade\r\nchannels which continued to run. The Bow Churchyard Warehouse may have\r\nbeen the major exporter of English patent medicines to colonial\r\nAmerica, although others of importance were located in the same London\r\nregion, in particular Robert Turlington of Lombard Street and Francis\r\nNewbery of St. Paul's Churchyard. The significance of the fact that\r\nthere were key suppliers of patent medicines for the American market\r\nlies in the selection process which resulted. Out of the several\r\nhundred patent medicines which 18th-century Britain had available,\r\nAmericans dosed themselves with that score or more which the major\r\nexporters shipped to colonial ports.\r\n\r\n      [75] _London Mercury_, London, August 19-26, 1721.\r\n\r\n      [76] Bernard Bailyn, _The New England merchants in the\r\n      seventeenth century_, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1955, pp. 35-36.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Bow Churchyard Warehouse firm have Bateman's Drops. It\r\nwill be remembered that in 1721 they advertised that they were\r\npreparing Daffy's Elixir. In 1743, they and Newbery were made exclusive\r\nvendors of Hooper's Pills.[77] By 1750, the firm was also marketing\r\nBritish Oil, Anderson's Pills, and Stoughton's Elixir.[78] Turlington\r\nin 1755 was selling not only his Balsam of Life, but was also vending\r\nDaffy's Elixir, Godfrey's Cordial, and Stoughton's Elixir.[79] After\r\nthe tension of the Townshend Acts, it was the Bow Churchyard Warehouse\r\nwhich supplied a Boston apothecary with a large supply of nostrums,\r\nincluding all the eight patent medicines then in existence of the ten\r\nwith which this discussion is primarily concerned.[80] On November 29,\r\n1770, the _Virginia Gazette_ (edited by Purdie and Dixon) reported a\r\nshipment, including Bateman's, Hooper's, Betton's, Anderson's, and\r\nGodfrey's remedies, just received \"from Dr. Bateman's original\r\nwholesale warehouse in London\" (the Bow Churchyard Warehouse). When\r\nDalby's Carminative and Steer's Opodeldoc came on the market in the\r\n1780's, it was Francis Newbery who had them for sale. Both the Newbery\r\nand Dicey (Bow Churchyard Warehouse) firms continued to operate in the\r\npost-Revolutionary years. Thus, it was no accident but rather vigorous\r\ncommercial promotion over the decades, that resulted in the most\r\npopular items on the Dicey and Newbery lists appearing in the\r\nPhiladelphia College of Pharmacy pamphlet published in 1824. And\r\nalthough the same old firms continued to export the same old medicines\r\nto the new United States, the back of the business was broken. The\r\nimitation spurred by wartime necessity became the post-war pattern.\r\n\r\n      [77] _Daily Advertiser_, London, September 23, 1743.\r\n\r\n      [78] \"Dr. Bateman's Drops\" (see footnote 7).\r\n\r\n      [79] Turlington, _op. cit._ (footnote 15).\r\n\r\n      [80] _Massachusetts Gazette_, Boston, December 21, 1769.\r\n\r\nThe key recipes were to be found in formula books. Beginning in the\r\n1790's, even American editions of John Wesley's _Primitive physic_\r\nincluded formulas for Daffy's, Turlington's, and Stoughton's remedies\r\nwhich the founder of Methodism had introduced into English editions of\r\nthis guidebook to health shortly before his death.[81]\r\n\r\n      [81] John Wesley, _Primitive physic_, 21st ed., London, 1785;\r\n      _ibid._, 22nd ed., London, 1788; _ibid._, 16th Amer. ed.,\r\n      Trenton, 1788; _ibid._, 22nd Amer. ed., Philadelphia, 1791;\r\n      George Dock, \"The 'primitive physic' of Rev. John Wesley,\"\r\n      _Journal of the American Medical Association_, February 20, 1915,\r\n      vol. 64, pp. 629-638.\r\n\r\nThe homemade versions, as Jonathon Waldo had recorded (see p. 171),\r\nwere about half as costly. The state of affairs at the turn of the new\r\ncentury is illustrated in the surviving business papers of the Beverly\r\ndruggist, Robert Rantoul. In 1799 he had imported the British Oil and\r\nEssence of Peppermint bottles. In 1802 he reordered the latter,\r\nspecifying that they should not have molded in the glass the words \"by\r\nthe Kings Patent.\" Rantoul wrote a formula for this nostrum in his\r\nformula book, and from it he filled 66 bottles in December 1801 and 202\r\nbottles in June 1803. About the same time he began making and bottling\r\nTurlington's Balsam, ordering bottles of two sizes from London. His\r\nformula book contains these entries: \"Jany 4th, 1804 filled 54 small\r\nturlingtons with 37 oz. Balsam,\" and \"Jany 20th, 1804 filled 144 small\r\nturlingtons with 90-1/4 oz. Balsam and 9 Large Bottles with 8-1/4\r\noz.\"[82]\r\n\r\n      [82] Rantoul, _op. cit._ (footnote 72).\r\n\r\nTwo decades later the imitation of the English proprietaries was even\r\nbigger business. In 1821 William A. Brewer became apprenticed to a\r\ndruggist in Boston. A number of the old English brands, he recalled,\r\nwere still imported and sold at the time. But his apprenticeship years\r\nwere heavily encumbered with duties involving the American versions.\r\n\"Many, very many, days were spent,\" Brewer remembered, \"in compounding\r\nthese imitations, cleaning the vials, fitting, corking, labelling,\r\nstamping with fac-similes of the English Government stamp, and in\r\nwrapping them, with ... little regard to the originator's rights, or\r\nthat of their heirs....\" The British nostrums chiefly imitated in this\r\nBoston shop were Steer's, Bateman's, Godfrey's, Dalby's, Betton's, and\r\nStoughton's. The last was a major seller. The store loft was mostly\r\nfilled with orange peel and gentian, and the laboratory had \"a heavy\r\noaken press, fastened to the wall with iron clamps and bolts, which was\r\nused in pressing out 'Stoughton's Bitters,' of which we usually\r\nprepared a hogshead full at one time.\" A large quantity was needed. In\r\nthose days, Brewer asserted, \"almost everybody indulged in Stoughton's\r\nelixir as morning bitters.\" [83]\r\n\r\n      [83] William A. Brewer, \"Reminiscences of an old pharmacist.\"\r\n      _Pharmaceutical Record_, August 1, 1884, vol. 4, p. 326.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--GODFREY'S CORDIAL, early 20th century\r\nbottles manufactured in the U.S.A. (_U.S. National Museum cat. Nos.\r\nM-6989, and M-6990; Smithsonian photo 44287 B._)]\r\n\r\nOther drugstores certainly followed the practice of Brewer's employer,\r\nin cleaning up and refilling bottles that had previously been drained\r\nof their old English medicines. The chief source of bottles to hold the\r\nAmerican imitations, however, was the same as that to which Waldo and\r\nRantoul had turned, English glass factories. It was not so easy for\r\nAmericans to fabricate the vials as it was for them to compound the\r\nmixtures to fill them. In the years before the War of 1812, the British\r\nglass industry maintained a virtual monopoly of the specially-shaped\r\nbottles for Bateman's, Turlington's, and the other British remedies.\r\nWhen in the 1820's the first titan of made-in-America nostrums, Thomas\r\nW. Dyott of Philadelphia, appeared upon the scene, this venturesome\r\nentrepreneur decided to make bottles not only for his own assorted\r\nremedies but also for the popular English brands. In time he succeeded\r\nin improving the quality of American bottle glass and in drastically\r\nreducing prices. The standard cost for most of the old English vials\r\nunder the British monopoly had been $5.50 a gross.

For example, in 1835\r\nthe Free Will Glass Manufactory was making \"Godfrey's Cordial,\"\r\n\"Turlington's Balsam,\" and \"Opodeldoc Bitters bottles.\"[85] An 1848\r\nbroadside entitled \"The Glassblowers' List of Prices of Druggist's\r\nWare,\" a broadside preserved at the Smithsonian Institution, includes\r\nlistings for Turlington's Balsam, Godfrey's Cordial, Dalby's and Small\r\nand Large Opodeldoc bottles, among many other American patent medicine\r\nbottles.\r\n\r\n      [85] Van Rensscalar, _op. cit._, (footnote 53), p. 151.\r\n\r\nIn the daybook of the Beverly, Massachusetts, apothecary,[86] were\r\ninscribed for Turlington's Balsam, three separate formulas, each\r\nmarkedly different from the others. A Philadelphia medical journal in\r\n1811 contained a complaint that Americans were using calomel in the\r\npreparation of Anderson's Scots Pills, and that this practice was a\r\ndeviation both from the original formula and from the different but\r\nstill all-vegetable formula by which the pills were being made in\r\nEngland.[87] Various books were published revealing the \"true\"\r\nformulas, in conflicting versions.[88]\r\n\r\n      [86] Rantoul, _op. cit._ (footnote 72).\r\n\r\n      [87] _Philadelphia Medical Museum_, new ser., vol. 1, p. 130,\r\n      1811.\r\n\r\n      [88] _Formulae selectae; or a collection of prescriptions of\r\n      eminent physicians, and the most celebrated patent medicines_,\r\n      New York, 1818; John Ayrton Paris, _Pharmacologia; or the history\r\n      of medicinal substances, with a view to establish the art of\r\n      prescribing and of composing extemporaneous formulae upon fixed\r\n      and scientific principles_, New York, 1822.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia College of Pharmacy Formulary\r\n\r\nAs the years went by and therapeutic laissez-faire continued to\r\noperate, conditions worsened. By the early 1820's, the old English\r\npatent medicines, whether of dwindling British vintage or of burgeoning\r\nAmerican manufacture, were as familiar as laudanum or castor oil.\r\n\r\nWith the demand so extensive and the state of production so chaotic,\r\nthe officials of the new Philadelphia College of Pharmacy were\r\npersuaded that remedial action was mandatory. In May 1822, the Board of\r\nTrustees resolved to appoint a 5-man committee \"to select from such\r\nprescriptions for the preparation of Patent Medicines ..., as may be\r\nsubmitted to them by the members of the College, those which in their\r\nopinion, may be deemed most appropriate for the different\r\ncompositions.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee chose for study \"eight of the Patent Medicines most in\r\nuse,\" and sought to ascertain what ingredients these ancient remedies\r\nought by right to contain. Turning to the original formulas, where\r\nthese were given in English patent specifications, the pharmacists soon\r\nbecame convinced that the information provided by the original\r\nproprietors served \"only to mislead.\"\r\n\r\nIf the patent specifications were perhaps intentionally confusing, the\r\ncommittee inquired, how could the original formulas really be known?\r\nThis quest seemed so fruitless that it was not pursued. Instead the\r\npharmacists turned to American experience in making the English\r\nmedicines. From many members of the College, and from other pharmacists\r\nas well, recipes were secured. The result was shocking. Although almost\r\nevery one came bolstered with the assertion that it was true and\r\ngenuine, the formulas differed so markedly one from the other, the\r\ncommittee reported, as to make \"the task of reformation a very\r\ndifficult one.\" Indeed, in some cases, when two recipes bearing the\r\nsame old English name were compared, they were found to contain not one\r\ningredient in common. In other cases, the proportions of some basic\r\ningredient would vary widely. All the formulas collected for Bateman's\r\nPectoral Drops, for instance, contained opium, but the amount of opium\r\nto liquid ingredients in one formula submitted was 1 to 14, while in\r\nanother it was 1 to 1,000.\r\n\r\nSetting forth boldly to strip these English nostrums of \"their\r\nextravagant pretensions,\" the committee sought to devise formulas for\r\ntheir composition as simple and inexpensive as possible while yet\r\nretaining the \"chief compatible virtues\" ascribed to them on the\r\ntraditional wrappers.\r\n\r\nHooper's Female Pills had been from the beginning a cathartic and\r\nemmenagogue. However, only aloes was common to all the recipes\r\nsubmitted to the committee. This botanical, which still finds a place\r\nin laxative products today, was retained by the committee as the\r\ncathartic base, and to it were added \"the Extract of Hellebore, the\r\nSulphate of Iron and the Myrrh as the best emmenagogues.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson's Scots Pills had been a \"mild\" purgative throughout its long\r\ncareer, varying in composition \"according to the judgement or fancy of\r\nthe preparer.\" Paris, an English physician, had earlier reported that\r\nthese pills consisted of aloes and jalap; the committee decided on\r\naloes, with small amounts of colocynth and gamboge, as the purgatives\r\nof choice.\r\n\r\nOf Bateman's Pectoral Drops more divergent versions existed than of any\r\nof the others. The committee settled on a formula of opium and camphor,\r\nnot unlike paragoric in composition, with catachu, anise flavoring, and\r\ncoloring added. Godfrey's Cordial also featured opium in widely varying\r\namounts. The committee chose a formula which would provide a grain of\r\nopium per ounce, to which was added sassafras \"as the carminative which\r\nhas become one of the chief features of the medicine.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish apothecary Dalby had introduced his \"Carminative\" for \"all\r\nthose fatal Disorders in the Bowels of Infants.\" The committee decided\r\nthat a grain of opium to the ounce, together with magnesia and three\r\nvolatile oils, were essential \"for this mild carminative and laxative\r\n... for children.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of the complex formula described by Robert Turlington for his\r\nBalsam of Life, the committee settled on the official formula of\r\nCompound Tincture of Benzoin, with balsam of peru, myrrh, and angelica\r\nroot added, to produce \"an elegant and rich balsamic tincture.\" On the\r\nother hand, the committee adopted \"with slight variations, the\r\nLinimentum Saponis of the old London Dispensatory\" to which they, like\r\nSteers, added only ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe committee found two distinct types of British Oil on the market.\r\nOne employed oil of turpentine as its basic ingredient, while the other\r\nutilized flaxseed oil. The committee decided that both oils, along with\r\nseveral others in lesser quantities, were necessary to produce a\r\nmedicine \"as exhibited in the directions\" sold with British Oil. \"Oil\r\nof Bricks\" which apparently was the essential ingredient of the Betton\r\nBritish Oil, was described by the committee as \"a nauseous and\r\nunskilful preparation, which has long since been banished from the\r\nPharmacopoeias.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Philadelphia pharmacists devised eight new standardized\r\nformulas, aimed at retaining the therapeutic goals of the original\r\npatent medicines, while brought abreast of current pharmaceutical\r\nknowledge. Recognizing that the labeling had long contained\r\n\"extravagant pretensions and false assertions,\" the committee\r\nrecommended that the wrappers be modified to present only truthful\r\nclaims. If the College trustees should adopt the changes suggested, the\r\ncommittee concluded optimistically, then \"the reputation of the College\r\npreparations would soon become widely spread, and we ... should reap\r\nthe benefit of the examination which has now been made, in an increased\r\npublic confidence in the Institution and its members; the influence of\r\nwhich would be felt in extending the drug business of our city.\"[89]\r\n\r\n      [89] Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, _Formulae for the\r\n      preparation of eight patent medicines, adopted by the\r\n      Philadelphia College of Pharmacy_, May 4, 1824; Joseph W.\r\n      England, ed., _The first century of the Philadelphia College of\r\n      Pharmacy_, 1821-1921, Philadelphia, 1922.\r\n\r\nThe trustees felt this counsel to be wise, and ordered 250 copies of\r\nthe 12-page pamphlet to be printed. So popular did this first major\r\nundertaking of the Philadelphia College prove that in 1833 the formulas\r\nwere reprinted in the pages of the journal published by the\r\nCollege.[90] Again the demand was high, few numbers of the publication\r\nwere \"more sought after,\" and in 1839 the formulas were printed once\r\nagain, this time with slight revisions.[91]\r\n\r\n      [90] \"Patent medicines,\" _Journal of the Philadelphia College of\r\n      Pharmacy_, April 1833, vol. 5, pp. 20-31.\r\n\r\n      [91] C. Ellis, \"Patent medicines,\" _American Journal of\r\n      Pharmacy_, April 1839, new ser., vol. 5, pp. 67-74.\r\n\r\nThus had the old English patent medicines reached a new point in their\r\nAmerican odyssey. They had first crossed the Atlantic to serve the\r\nfinancial interests of the men who promoted them. During the Revolution\r\nthey had lost their British identity while retaining their British\r\nnames. The Philadelphia pharmacists, while adopting them and reforming\r\ntheir character, did not seek to monopolize them, as had the original\r\nproprietors. They now could work for every man.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Patent Medicines Go West\r\n\r\nThe double reprinting of the formulas was one token of the continuing\r\nrole in American therapy of the old English patent medicines. There\r\nwere others. In 1829 with the establishment of a school of pharmacy in\r\nNew York City, the Philadelphia formulas were accepted as standard. The\r\nnew labels devised by the Philadelphians with their more modest claims\r\nof efficacy had a good sale.[92] It was doubtless the Philadelphia\r\nrecipes which went into the Bateman and Turlington and Godfrey vials\r\nwith which a new druggist should be equipped \"at the outset of\r\nbusiness,\" according to a book of practical counsel.[93] To local\r\nmerchants who lacked the knowledge or time to do it themselves,\r\ndrummers and peddlers vended the medicines already bottled. \"Doctor\"\r\nWilliam Euen of Philadelphia issued a pamphlet in 1840 to introduce his\r\nson to \"Physicians and Country Merchants.\" His primary concern was\r\ndispensing nostrums bearing his own label, but his son was also\r\nprepared to take orders for the old English patent medicines.[94]\r\nManufacturers and wholesalers of much better repute were prepared to\r\nsell bottles for the same brands, empty or filled.\r\n\r\n      [92] England, _op. cit._ (footnote 89), pp. 73, 103.\r\n\r\n      [93] Carpenter, _op. cit._ (footnote 73).\r\n\r\n      [94] William Euen, _A short exposÃ© on quackery ... or,\r\n      introduction of his son to physicians and country merchants_,\r\n      Philadelphia, 1840.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--ENGLISH AND AMERICAN BRANDS OF HOOPER'S\r\nFEMALE PILLS, an assortment of packages of from the Samuel Aker, David\r\nand George Kass collection, Albany, New York.

John Uri Lloyd of Cincinnati\r\nrecalled having compounded Godfrey's Cordial and Bateman's Drops,\r\nusually making ten gallons in a single batch.[96] Out in Wisconsin,\r\nanother druggist was buying Godfrey's Cordial bottles at a dollar for\r\nhalf a gross, sticking printed directions on them that cost twelve\r\ncents for the same quantity, and selling the medicine at four ounces\r\nfor a quarter.[97] He also sold British Oil and Opodeldoc, the same old\r\nEnglish names dispensed by a druggist in another Wisconsin town, who in\r\naddition kept Bateman's Oil in stock at thirteen cents the bottle.[98]\r\nGodfrey's was listed in the 1860 inventory of an Illinois general store\r\nat six cents a bottle.[99]\r\n\r\n      [95] James Winchell Forbes, \"The memoirs of an American\r\n      pharmacist,\" _Midland Druggist and Pharmaceutical Review_, 1911,\r\n      vol. 45, pp. 388-395.\r\n\r\n      [96] John Uri Lloyd, \"Eclectic fads,\" _Eclectic Medical Journal_,\r\n      October 1921, vol. 81, p. 2.\r\n\r\n      [97] Cody & Johnson Drug Co., Apothecary daybooks, Watertown,\r\n      Wisconsin [1851-1872].

Indeed, the old English\r\npatent medicines had long since moved westward with fur trader and\r\nsettler. As early as 1783, a trader in western Canada, shot by a rival,\r\ncalled for Turlington's Balsam to stop the bleeding. Alas, in this\r\ncase, the remedy failed to work.[100] In 1800 that inveterate Methodist\r\ntraveler, Bishop Francis Asbury, resorted to Stoughton's Elixir when\r\nafflicted with an intestinal complaint.[101] In 1808, some two months\r\nafter the first newspaper began publishing west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, a local store advised readers in the vicinity of St. Louis that\r\n\"a large supply of patent medicines\" had just been received, among them\r\nGodfrey's Cordial, British Oil, Turlington's Balsam, and Steer's\r\n\"Ofodeldo [sic].\"[102]\r\n\r\n      [100] Harold A. Innis, _Peter Pond, fur trader and adventurer_,\r\n      Toronto, 1930.\r\n\r\n      [101] Peter Oliver, \"Notes on science, medicine and public health\r\n      in the United States in the year 1800,\" _Bulletin of the History\r\n      of Medicine_. 1944, vol. 16, p. 129.\r\n\r\n      [102] Isaac Lionberger, \"Advertisements in the Missouri Gazette,\r\n      1808-1811,\" _Missouri Historical Society Collections_, 1928-1931,\r\n      vol. 6, p. 21.\r\n\r\nTurlington's product played a particular role in the Indian trade, thus\r\ndemonstrating that the red man has not been limited in nostrum history\r\nto providing medical secrets for the white man to exploit. Proof of\r\nthis has been demonstrated by archaeologists working under the auspices\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution in both North and South Dakota. Two\r\npear-shaped bottles with Turlington's name and patent claims embossed\r\nin the glass were excavated by a Smithsonian Institution River Basin\r\nSurveys expedition in 1952, on the site of an old trading post known as\r\nFort Atkinson or Fort Bethold II, situated some 16 miles southeast of\r\nthe present Elbowoods, North Dakota. In 1954 the North Dakota\r\nHistorical Society found a third bottle nearby. These posts, operated\r\nfrom the mid-1850's to the mid-1880's, served the Hidatsa and Mandan\r\nIndians who dwelt in a town named Like-a-Fishhook Village. The medicine\r\nbottles were made of cast glass, light green in color, probably of\r\nAmerican manufacture. More interesting is the bottle from South Dakota.\r\nIt was excavated in 1923 near Mobridge at a site which was the\r\nprincipal village of the Arikara Indians from about 1800 to 1833, a\r\ntown visited by Lewis and Clark as they ascended the Missouri River in\r\n1804. This bottle, made of English lead glass and therefore an imported\r\narticle, was unearthed from a grave in the Indian burying ground.\r\nThroughout history the claims made in behalf of patent medicines have\r\nbeen extreme. This Turlington bottle, however, affords one of the few\r\ncases on record wherein such a medicine has been felt to possess a\r\npostmortem utility.[103]\r\n\r\n      [103] Wedel and Griffenhagen, _op. cit._ (footnote 54).\r\n\r\nFur traders were still using old English patent medicines at\r\nmid-century. Four dozen bottles of Turlington's Balsam were included in\r\nan \"Inventory of Stock the property of Pierre Chouteau, Jr. and Co.\r\nU[pper], M[issouri]. On hand at Fort Benton 4th May 1851....\"[104] In\r\nthe very same year, out in the new State of California, one of the\r\nearly San Francisco papers listed Stoughton's Bitters as among the\r\nmerchandise for sale at a general store.[105]\r\n\r\n      [104] A. McDonnell, _Contributions to the Historical Society of\r\n      Montana_, 1941, vol. 10, pp. 202, 217.\r\n\r\n      [105] _California Daily Courier_, San Francisco, April 25, 1851.\r\n\r\nNewspaper advertising of the English proprietaries--even the mere\r\nlisting so common during the late colonial years--became very rare\r\nafter the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy pamphlet was issued.\r\nApothecary George J. Fischer of Frederick, Maryland, might mention\r\nseven of the old familiar names in 1837,[106] and another druggist in\r\nthe same city might present a shorter list in 1844,[107] but such\r\nadvertising was largely gratuitous. Since the English patent medicines\r\nhad become every druggist's property, people who felt the need of such\r\ndosage would expect every druggist to have them in stock. There was no\r\nmore need to advertise them than there was to advertise laudanum or\r\nleeches or castor oil. Even the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1837\r\ntook judicial cognizance of the fact that the old English patent\r\nmedicine names had acquired a generic meaning descriptive of a general\r\nclass of medicines, names which everyone was free to use and no one\r\ncould monopolize.[108]\r\n\r\n      [106] _Political Examiner_, Frederick, Maryland, April 19, 1837.\r\n\r\n      [107] _Frederick Examiner_, Frederick, Maryland, January 31,\r\n      1844.\r\n\r\n      [108] _Massachusetts Supreme Court_, Thomson vs. Winchester, 19\r\n      Pick (Mass.), p. 214, March 1837.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, and as advertising did not keep the names of the\r\nold English medicines before the eyes of customers, it is a safe\r\nassumption that their use declined. Losing their original proprietary\r\nstatus, they were playing a different role. New American proprietaries\r\nhad stolen the appeal and usurped the function which Bateman's Drops\r\nand Turlington's Balsam had possessed in 18th-century London and Boston\r\nand Williamsburg. As part of the cultural nationalism that had\r\naccompanied the Revolution, American brands of nostrums had come upon\r\nthe scene, promoted with all the vigor and cleverness once bestowed in\r\nEnglish but not in colonial American advertising upon Dalby's\r\nCarminative and others of its kind. While these English names retreated\r\nfrom American advertising during the 19th century, vast blocks of space\r\nin the ever-larger newspapers were devoted to extolling the merits of\r\nDyott's Patent Itch Ointment, Swaim's Panacea, and Brandreth's Pills.\r\nMore and more Americans were learning how to read, as free public\r\neducation spread. Persuaded by the frightening symptoms and the\r\nglorious promises, citizens with a bent toward self-dosage flocked to\r\nbuy the American brands. Druggists and general stores stocked them and\r\nmade fine profits.[109] While bottles of British Oil sold two for a\r\nquarter in 1885 Wisconsin, one bottle of Jayne's Expectorant retailed\r\nfor a dollar.[110] It is no wonder that, although the old English names\r\ncontinue to appear in the mid-19th-century and later druggists'\r\ncatalogs and price currents,[111] they are muscled aside by the\r\nmultitude of brash American nostrums. Many of the late 19th century\r\nlistings continued to follow the procedure set early in the century of\r\nspecifying two grades of the various patent medicines, _i.e._,\r\n\"English\" and \"American,\" \"genuine\" and \"imitation,\" \"U.S.\" and\r\n\"stamped.\" American manufactories specializing in pharmaceutical\r\nglassware continued to offer the various English patent medicine\r\nbottles until the close of the century.[112]\r\n\r\n      [109] James Harvey Young, \"Patent medicines: the early\r\n      post-frontier phase,\" _Journal of the Illinois State Historical\r\n      Society_, Autumn 1953, vol. 46, pp. 254-264.\r\n\r\n      [110] Cody and Johnson Drug Co., _op. cit._ (footnote 97).\r\n\r\n      [111] Van Schaack, Stevenson & Reid, _Annual prices current_,\r\n      Chicago, 1875; Morrison, Plummer & Co., _Price current of drugs,\r\n      chemicals, oils, glassware, patent medicines, druggists sundries\r\n      ..._, Chicago, 1880.\r\n\r\n      [112] Hagerty Bros. & Co., _Catalogue of Druggists' glassware,\r\n      sundries, fancy goods, etc._, New York, 1879; Whitall, Tatum &\r\n      Co., _Annual price list_, Millville, New Jersey, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--OPODELDOC BOTTLE from the collection of Mrs.\r\nLeo F.

(_Smithsonian photo 44201-E._)]\r\n\r\nIn a thesaurus published in 1899, Godfrey's, Bateman's, Turlington's,\r\nand other of the old English patent remedies were termed \"extinct\r\npatents.\"[113] The adjective referred to the status of the patent, not\r\nthe condition of the medicines. If less prominent than in the olden\r\ndays, the medicines were still alive. The first edition of the\r\n_National Formulary_, published in 1888, had cited the old English\r\nnames as synonyms for official preparations in four cases, Dalby's,\r\nBateman's, Godfrey's and Turlington's.\r\n\r\n      [113] Emil Hiss, _Thesaurus of proprietary preparations and\r\n      pharmaceutical specialties_, Chicago, 1899, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--OPODELDOC BOTTLE as illustrated in the 1879\r\nCatalog of Hagerty Bros., New York City, New York.]\r\n\r\nThus as the present century opened, the old English patent medicines\r\nwere still being sold. City druggists were dispensing them over their\r\ncounters, and the peddler's wagon carried them to remote rural\r\nregions.[114] But the medical scene was changing rapidly. Improvements\r\nin medical science, stemming in part from the establishment of the germ\r\ntheory of disease, were providing a better yardstick against which to\r\nmeasure the therapeutic efficiency of proprietary remedies. Medical\r\nethics were likewise advancing, and the occasional critic among the\r\nranks of physicians was being joined by scores of his fellow\r\npractitioners in lambasting the brazen effrontery of the hundreds of\r\nAmerican cure-alls which advertised from newspaper and roadside sign.\r\nJournalists joined doctors in condemning nostrums. Samuel Hopkins Adams\r\nin particular, writing \"The Great American Fraud\" series for _Collier's\r\nWeekly_, frightened and aroused the American public with his exposure\r\nof cheap whiskey posing as consumption cures and soothing syrups filled\r\nwith opium. Then came a revolution in public policy. After a long and\r\nfrustrating legislative prelude, Congress in June of 1906 passed, and\r\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt signed, the first Pure Food and Drugs Act.\r\nThe law contained clauses aimed at curtailing the worst features of the\r\npatent medicine evil.\r\n\r\n      [114] Robert B. Nixon, Jr., _Corner druggist_, New York, 1941,\r\n      p. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Patent Medicines In The 20th Century\r\n\r\nAlthough the old English patent medicines had not been the target at\r\nwhich disturbed physicians and \"muck-raking\" journalists had taken aim,\r\nthese ancient remedies were governed by provisions of the new law. In\r\nNovember 1906 the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nin charge of administering the new federal statute, received a letter\r\nfrom a wholesale druggist in Evansville, Indiana. One of his stocks in\r\ntrade, the druggist wrote, was a remedy called Godfrey's Cordial. He\r\nrealized that the Pure Food and Drugs Act had something to do with the\r\nlabeling of medicines containing opium, as Godfrey's did, and he wanted\r\nto know from the Bureau just what was required of him.[115] Many\r\nmanufacturing druggists and producers of medicine were equally anxious\r\nto learn how the law would affect them. The editors of a trade paper,\r\nthe _American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record_, issued warnings and\r\ngave advice. It was still the custom, they noted, to wrap bottles of\r\nancient patent medicines, like Godfrey's Cordial and Turlington's\r\nBalsam, in facsimiles of the original circulars, on which were printed\r\nextravagant claims and fabulous certificates of cures that dated back\r\nsome two hundred years. The new law was not going to permit the\r\ncontinuation of such 18th-century practices. Statements on the label\r\n\"false or misleading in any particular\" were banned.[116]\r\n\r\n      [115] Letter from Charles Leich & Co. to Harvey Washington Wiley,\r\n      Bureau of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture, November 2, 1906.\r\n      Manuscript original in Record Group 97, National Archives,\r\n      Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n      [116] _American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record_, 1906, vol.\r\n      49, pp. 343-344.\r\n\r\nA few manufacturers, as the years went by, fell afoul of this and other\r\nprovisions of the law. In 1918 a Reading, Pennsylvania, firm entered a\r\nplea of guilty and received a fifty dollar fine for putting on the\r\nmarket an adulterated and misbranded version of Dr. Bateman's Pectoral\r\nDrops.[117] The law required that all medicines sold under a name\r\nrecognized in the _United States pharmacopoeia_ or the _National\r\nformulary_, and Bateman's was included in the latter, must not differ\r\nfrom the standard of strength, quality, or purity as established by\r\nthese volumes. Yet the Bateman Drops produced in Reading, the\r\ngovernment charged, fell short. They contained only 27.8 percent of the\r\nalcohol and less than a tenth of the morphine that they should have\r\nhad. While short on active ingredients, the Drops were long on claims.\r\nThe wrapper boasted that the medicine was \"effective as a remedy for\r\nall fluxes, spitting of blood, agues, measles, colds, coughs, and to\r\nput off the most violent fever; as a treatment, remedy, and cure for\r\nstone and gravel in the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, shortness of\r\nbreath, straightness of the breast; and to rekindle the most natural\r\nheat in the bodies by which they restore the languishing to perfect\r\nhealth.\" Okell and Dicey had scarcely promised more. By 20th-century\r\nstandards, the government asserted, these claims were false and\r\nfraudulent.\r\n\r\n      [117] Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Chemistry, Notices of\r\n      Judgment under the Food and Drugs Act, Notice of Judgment 6222,\r\n      United States vs. Pabst Pure Extract Co., 1919.\r\n\r\nOther manufacturers sold Bateman's Drops without running afoul of the\r\nlaw. In 1925, ninety-nine years after the Philadelphia College of\r\nPharmacy pamphlet was printed, one North Carolina firm was persuaded\r\nthat it still was relevant to tell potential customers, in a handbill,\r\nthat its Drops were being made in strict conformity with the College\r\nformula.[118] For Compound Tincture of Opium and Gambir Compound,\r\nhowever, most manufacturers chose to follow the _National formulary_\r\nspecifications, which remained official until 1936.\r\n\r\n      [118] Original handbill, distributed by Standard Drug Co.,\r\n      Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 1925, preserved in the files of\r\n      the Bureau of Investigation, American Medical Association,\r\n      Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nAnother old English patent medicine against which the Department of\r\nAgriculture was forced to take action was Hooper's Female Pills.\r\nBetween 1919 and 1923, government agents seized a great many shipments\r\nof this ancient remedy in versions put out by three Philadelphia\r\nconcerns.[119] Some of the packages bore red seals, others green seals,\r\nand still others black, but the labeling of all claimed them to be \"a\r\nsafe and sovereign remedy in female complaints.\" This theme was\r\nexpanded in considerable detail and there was an 18th-century ring to\r\nthe promise that the pills would work a sure cure \"in all\r\nhypochondriac, hysterick or vapourish disorders.\" No pill made\r\nessentially of aloes and ferrous sulphate, said the government experts,\r\ncould do these things. Nor did the manufacturers, in court, seek to say\r\notherwise. Whether the seals were green or red, whether the packages\r\nwere seized in Washington or Worcester, the result was the same. No\r\nparty appeared in court to claim the pills, and they were condemned and\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n      [119] Multiple seizures were made of products shipped by the\r\n      Horace B. Taylor Co., Fore & Co., and the American Synthetic Co.\r\n      The quotations are from Notice of Judgment 8868; see also 8881,\r\n      8914, 8936, 8956, 8974, 9134, 9147, 9203, 9510, 9586, 9785,\r\n      10203, 10204, 10629, 11519, 11669.\r\n\r\nIn one of the last actions under the 1906 law, a case concluded in\r\n1940, after the first federal statute had been superseded by a more\r\nrigorous one enacted in 1938, two of the old English patent medicines\r\nencountered trouble.[120] They were British Oil and Dalby's\r\nCarminative, as prepared by the South Carolina branch of a large\r\npharmaceutical manufacturing concern.\r\n\r\n      [120] Federal Security Agency, Food and Drug Administration,\r\n      Notice of Judgment 31134, United States vs. McKesson and Robbins,\r\n      Inc., Murray Division, 1942.\r\n\r\nAccording to the label, the British Oil was made in conformity with the\r\nPhiladelphia College of Pharmacy formula given in an outdated edition\r\nof the _United States dispensatory_. But instead of containing a proper\r\namount of linseed oil, if indeed it contained any, the medicine was\r\nmade with cottonseed oil, an ingredient not mentioned in the\r\nDispensatory. Therefore, the government charged, the Oil was\r\nadulterated, under that provision of the law requiring a medicine to\r\nmaintain the strength and purity of any standard it professed to\r\nfollow. More than that, the labeling contravened the law since it\r\nrepresented the remedy as an effective treatment for various swellings,\r\ninflammations, fresh wounds, earaches, shortnesses of breath, and\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\nDalby's Carminative was merely misbranded, but that was bad enough. Its\r\nlabel suggested that it be used especially \"For Infants Afflicted With\r\nWind, Watery Gripes, Fluxes and Other Disorders of the Stomach and\r\nBowels,\" although it would aid adults as well. The impression that this\r\nremedy was capable of curing such afflictions, the government charged,\r\nwas false and fraudulent. Moreover, since the Carminative contained\r\nopium, it was not a safe medicine when given according to the dosage\r\ndirections in a circular accompanying the bottle. For these and several\r\nother violations of the law, the defending company, which did not\r\ncontest the case, was fined a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 19th century, occasional criticism of the old English\r\npatent medicines had been made in the lay press. One novel[121]\r\ndescribes a physician who comments on the use of Dalby's Carminative\r\nfor babies: \"Don't, for pity's sake, vitiate and torment your poor\r\nlittle angel's stomach, so new to the atrocities of this world, with\r\ndrugs. These mixers of baby medicines ought to be fed nothing but their\r\nown nostrums. That would put a stop to their inventions of the\r\nadversary.\"\r\n\r\n      [121] John William De Forest, _Miss Ravenel's conversion from\r\n      secession to loyalty_, New York, 1867.\r\n\r\nOpium had been lauded in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the old\r\nEnglish proprietaries began, as a superior cordial which could moderate\r\nmost illnesses and even cure some. \"Medicine would be a one-armed man\r\nif it did not possess this remedy.\" So had stated the noted English\r\nphysician, Thomas Sydenham.[122] But the 20th century had grown to fear\r\nthis powerful narcotic, especially in remedies for children. This point\r\nof view, illustrated in the governmental action concerning Dalby's\r\nCarminative, was also reflected in medical comment about Godfrey's\r\nCordial. During 1912, a Missouri physician described the death of a\r\nbaby who had been given this medicine for a week.[123] The symptoms\r\nwere those of opium poisoning. Deploring the naming of this \"dangerous\r\nmixture\" a \"cordial,\" since the average person thought of a cordial as\r\nbeneficial, the doctor hoped that the formula might be omitted from the\r\nnext edition of the _National formulary_. This did not happen, for the\r\nrecipe hung on until 1926. The Harrison Narcotic Act, enacted in 1914\r\nas a Federal measure to restrict the distribution of narcotics,[124]\r\nfailed to restrict the sale of many opium-bearing compounds like\r\nGodfrey's Cordial. In 1931, a Tennessee resident complained to the\r\nmedical journal _Hygeia_ that this medication was \"sold in general\r\nstores and drug stores here without prescription and is given to\r\nbabies.\" To this, the journal replied that the situation was \"little\r\nshort of criminal.\"[125] The charge leveled against his competitors by\r\none of the first producers of Godfrey's Cordial two centuries earlier\r\n(see page 158) may well have proved a prophecy broad enough to cover\r\nthe whole history of this potent nostrum. \"... Many Men, Women, and\r\nespecially Infants,\" he said, \"may fall as Victims, whose Slain may\r\nexceed Herod's Cruelty....\"\r\n\r\n      [122] Charles H.

According to Turlington, the\r\nbottle was adopted in 1754 \"to prevent the villainy of some persons\r\nwho, buying up my empty bottles, have basely and wickedly put therein a\r\nvile spurious counterfeit sort.\"]\r\n\r\nFor those who persist in using the formulas of the early English patent\r\nmedicines, recipes are still available. Turlington's Balsam remains\r\nas an unofficial synonym of U.S.P. Compound Tincture of Benzoin.\r\nConcerning its efficacy, the _United States dispensatory_[126] states:\r\n\"The tincture is occasionally employed internally as a stimulating\r\nexpectorant in chronic bronchitis. More frequently it is used as an\r\ninhalent ... It has also been recommended in chronic dysentery ... but\r\nis of doubtful utility.\"\r\n\r\n      [126] _The dispensatory of the United States of America_, 25th\r\n      ed., Philadelphia, 1955, p. 158.\r\n\r\nA formula for Godfrey's Cordial, under the title of Mixture of Opium\r\nand Sassafras, is still carried in the _Pharmaceutical recipe\r\nbook_.[127] _Remington's practice of pharmacy_[128] retains a formula\r\nfor Dalby's Carminative under the former _National formulary_ title of\r\nCarminative Mixture.\r\n\r\n      [127] _The Pharmaceutical recipe book_, 2nd ed., American\r\n      Pharmaceutical Association, 1936, p. 121.\r\n\r\n      [128] Eric W. Martin and E. Fullerton Cook, editors, _Remington's\r\n      practice of pharmacy_, 11th ed., Easton, Pennsylvania, 1956, p.\r\n      286.\r\n\r\nIn the nation of their origin, the continuing interest in the ancient\r\nproprietaries seems somewhat more lively than in America. The 1953\r\nedition of _Pharmaceutical formulas_, published by the London journal\r\n_The Chemist and Druggist_, includes formulas for eight of the ten old\r\npatent medicines described in this study. This compendium, indeed,\r\nlists not one, but three different recipes for British Oil, and the\r\nformulas by which Dalby's Carminative may be compounded run on to a\r\ntotal of eight. Two lineal descendents of 18th-century firms which took\r\nthe lead in exporting to America still manufacture remedies made so\r\nlong ago by their predecessors. May, Roberts & Co., Ltd., of London,\r\nsuccessors to the Newbery interests, continues to market Hooper's\r\nFemale Pills, whereas W. Sutton & Co. (Druggists' Sundries), London,\r\nLtd., of Enfield, in Middlesex, successors to Dicey & Co. at Bow\r\nChurchyard, currently sells Bateman's Pectoral Drops.[129]\r\n\r\n      [129] Letter from Owen H. Waller, editor of _The Chemist and\r\n      Druggist_, to George Griffenhagen, January 15, 1957.\r\n\r\nIn America, however, the impact of the old English patent medicines has\r\nbeen largely absorbed and forgotten. During the past twenty years a\r\nrevolution in medical therapy has taken place. Most of the drugs in use\r\ntoday were unknown a quarter of a century ago. Some of the newer drugs\r\ncan really perform certain of the healing miracles claimed by their\r\npretentious proprietors for the old English patent medicines.\r\n\r\nA more recent import from Britain, penicillin, may prove to have an\r\neven longer life on these shores than did Turlington's Balsam or\r\nBateman's Drops. Still, two hundred years is a long time. Despite the\r\nfact that these early English patent medicines are nearly forgotten by\r\nthe public today, their American career is none the less worth tracing.\r\nIt reflects aspects not only of medical and pharmaceutical history, but\r\nof colonial dependence, cultural nationalism, industrial development,\r\nand popular psychology. It reveals how desperate man has been when\r\nfaced with the terrors of disease, how he has purchased the packaged\r\npromises offered by the sincere but deluded as well as by the\r\ncharlatan. It shows how science and law have combined to offer man some\r\nsafeguards against deception in his pursuit of health.\r\n\r\nThe time seems ripe to write the epitaph of the old English patent\r\nmedicines in America. That they are now a chapter of history is a token\r\nof medical progress for mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--TURLINGTON'S BALSAM OF LIFE BOTTLE (all four\r\nsides) found in an Indian grave at Mobridge, South Dakota; now\r\npreserved in the U.S. National Museum.
