Over 40 per cent of married women suffer\r\nfrom it in one or another of its degrees or forms. And their suffering,\r\nemotionally and physically, is very real indeed.\r\n\r\nThose who are most closely related to the frigid woman--husband and\r\nchildren--suffer too. This is so because frigidity is an expression\r\nof neurosis, a disturbance of the unconscious life of the individual\r\ndestructive to personal relationships. No matter how much she may\r\nconsciously wish to, the frigid woman cannot protect her loved ones\r\nfrom the effects of her problem. Thus frigidity constitutes a major\r\ndanger to the stability of marriage and to the health and happiness of\r\nevery member of the individual family.\r\n\r\nDespite its extent and seriousness, women who suffer from frigidity\r\ngenerally know very little about their problem. They do not know\r\nits nature or its causes nor how or where to find help for it. No\r\nadequate book for the lay reader, nor any popular magazine article\r\nthat indicates a real way out, has yet been written on this enormously\r\nimportant subject. The problem has been surrounded by silence, and\r\nthis has engendered ignorance, misinformation, and has fostered\r\nfeelings of helplessness and hopelessness in the suffering individual.\r\n\r\nI have written this book to break this unhealthy silence, to bring to\r\nthe individual woman what science knows about frigidity, to show her\r\nthat, no matter how much she may have despaired, her problem can almost\r\ncertainly be resolved.\r\n\r\n                                                   MARIE ROBINSON, M.D.\r\n  _November 1, 1958_\r\n  _New York, N.Y._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Preface                                                              7\r\n\r\n  1 PARADISE LOST                                                     13\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I\r\n                          _The Normal Woman_\r\n\r\n  2 THE NORMAL ORGASM                                                 29\r\n\r\n  3 THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE                                            41\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II\r\n                     _The Psychology of Frigidity_\r\n\r\n  4 WHAT IS FRIGIDITY?                                                59\r\n\r\n  5 THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN                                     70\r\n\r\n  6 WHY WOMEN CAN BECOME FRIGID                                       83\r\n\r\n  7 ANATOMY AND DESTINY                                               96\r\n\r\n  8 THE GROWTH OF LOVE                                               106\r\n\r\n  9 DANGERS ON THE ROAD TO WOMANHOOD                                 120\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION III\r\n                  _The Fear of Love--Case Histories_\r\n\r\n  10 TOTAL AND PARTIAL FRIGIDITY                                     131\r\n\r\n  11 THE MASCULINE WOMAN                                             147\r\n\r\n  12 PSYCHIC FRIGIDITY                                               159\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION IV\r\n                       _The Bridge to Womanhood_\r\n\r\n  13 THE POWER OF LOVE                                               177\r\n\r\n  14 STEPS TO FREEDOM                                                182\r\n\r\n  15 THE MALE SEX: A NEW HORIZON                                     197\r\n\r\n  16 THE NATURE OF SURRENDER                                         209\r\n\r\n  17 SEXUAL SURRENDER                                                216\r\n\r\n  18 THE ROLE OF THE MALE                                            233\r\n\r\n  19 THE LORE OF LOVE                                                246\r\n\r\n  ADDENDA I                                                          259\r\n\r\n  ADDENDA II                                                         262\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE POWER OF SEXUAL SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Chapter 1_\r\n\r\n                             PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\nHappiness between men and women has never had such a radiant outlook\r\nas it has in this decade. Perhaps for the first time in the history of\r\nman the two sexes find themselves in a position to explore together the\r\ninfinitely varied and rich potentialities of real love.\r\n\r\nI am not being a blind optimist in making such a statement. In\r\nmy profession as a psychiatrist I see enough of daily misery and\r\ndestructive misunderstanding between men and women to keep a healthy\r\nskepticism very much alive in my mind about all human relationships,\r\nparticularly those that depend for their continued existence, at least\r\nin part, on sexual love.\r\n\r\nI can make such a statement about the potentialities of modern love\r\nfor one reason--that women today have, beyond the shadow of any doubt,\r\nachieved complete equality with men. Above all, this equality can be\r\nobserved as fully operative in the realm of love, sexual love. In the\r\npast thirty-odd years, and particularly in the last ten, the taboos,\r\nignorance, and misunderstanding which had obscured our visions for\r\ncenturies and prevented any real knowledge of feminine sexuality have\r\nbeen washed away.\r\n\r\nWe have been through a sexual revolution of major proportions. In\r\nthe course of that revolution we have learned, through science, not\r\nhearsay, the real facts. We know now that woman has the same need for\r\npassion, the same capacity for sexual response that man has. We know\r\nthat, down to the last detail, she is the equal and fitting companion\r\nfor all his possible raptures, can know with her entire body and mind\r\nand can share in vivid companionship the delighted storms of sexual\r\nlove that in the recent past were considered to be exclusively his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nFew, however, realize how recent and how revolutionary this view of\r\nwomankind actually is. The image of Victorian woman, that sexually\r\nfrozen, emotionally withdrawn vestal virgin, has faded quickly from\r\nour minds. It is important, for many reasons, to recall her, however,\r\nif only briefly. She dominated our whole view of womankind up to the\r\nbeginning of the 1920’s. By taking a quick look at her we can see how\r\nfar we have come in so short a time. And we can see why the prospect\r\nfor love has, in our time, brightened so considerably.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing attitude toward woman and her sexuality throughout the\r\nnineteenth century and up to the end of World War I was that sex,\r\nas we understand it today, did not exist for her. This belief was\r\nheld by virtually everybody, and it is nowhere more clearly stated\r\nthan by the medical authorities of that era. Thus Acton, a leading\r\nmedical specialist in the functions of reproduction, whose views\r\nwere widely influential, wrote: “The majority of women (happily for\r\nsociety) are not very much troubled with sexual feeling of any kind.”\r\nHe also stated that people who believed differently were making “a\r\nvile aspersion” against women. Two other doctors of the time agreed\r\ncompletely (and presumably after checking their facts). Fehling held\r\nthat any appearance of sexual feeling in a young girl in love was\r\n“pathological.” And Windschied stated that if a female showed any\r\ninnate or spontaneous sexual attributes “there is abnormality.”\r\n\r\nThese men were not crackpots. They were reputable and distinguished.\r\nThis was the “scientific” view of the matter, and it was shared\r\nby most people, men and women alike. It throws into clear relief\r\nthe potentialities of the present. Woman’s new and revolutionary\r\nself-awareness, her knowledge gained in the past thirty-odd years that\r\nwithout guilt or inhibition she may function in an atmosphere of total\r\nequality with men and eager acceptance by them, makes the past seem\r\nlike a nightmare. It is as though man and woman had emerged from a\r\nlong, long journey through a dreary jungle full of fear and shame to\r\nthe verge of a paradisal valley where they actually may live, as in the\r\nfairy tales, happily ever after.\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the tragic flaw in this picture. For, though the\r\npossibilities lie before them, millions of women find they must stay on\r\nthe verge of, never enter, the paradisal valley. They find themselves,\r\nin an age where true womanhood is highly valued, sexually frigid.\r\n\r\nWhat does sexual frigidity mean? I shall explain the matter in greater\r\ndetail later, of course, but I can give a preliminary, working\r\ndefinition now. Sexual frigidity is the inability to enjoy physical\r\nlove to the limits of its potentiality. The frigid woman is, to a\r\ngreater or lesser degree, blocked in her sensual capacities. Generally\r\nshe cannot experience orgasm. If she has one at all it is weak and\r\nunsatisfying. Many frigid women, however, not only do not have any\r\norgasm but may also lack the capacity to feel even the beginnings of\r\nsexual excitement. To some the sexual act is painful.\r\n\r\nThe frigid woman has learned to fear physical love, to run from it, and\r\nthis fear has profound repercussions on her relationships with men. The\r\nreasons for her fear are hidden from her, are locked in her unconscious\r\nmind. Consciously she may wish, above all things, to achieve real\r\ncloseness with her husband, to give and receive the greatest of all\r\nmutual joys between man and woman, sexual gratification. But she\r\nhas not the capacity to receive this joy. It is beyond her will and\r\ncontrol. It is as if she had a million dollars and could not spend a\r\ncent of it; as if she were surrounded by the finest foods and must\r\nstarve. The very fact of the new equality she has won makes her problem\r\neven more humiliating, bitterer, more frustrating.\r\n\r\nIn my fifteen years as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I have treated\r\nmany, many women who have come to me in despair because of their\r\npartial or total inability to enjoy the sexual part of their marriage\r\nand because of the repercussions from this inability. I and hundreds\r\nof other psychiatrists have been fortunate in helping many of them to\r\novercome their difficulties. We have found that before a woman can be\r\nexpected to take full responsibility for reaching true sexual maturity\r\nshe must really know all about herself, her sex and her problem. Then\r\nand only then has she the material in hand to start growing up, in all\r\npleasure, to her full feminine stature.\r\n\r\nIf a woman is willing to work in all seriousness with a psychiatrist\r\nthere is little question that she can be helped to overcome her sexual\r\ndifficulty. The information she receives, the insights she obtains into\r\nthe conditions which have kept her from experiencing real love can\r\nsweep away her ignorance, her misunderstandings, her irrational fears.\r\n\r\nHer experience with the psychiatrist may help her husband, too, for\r\nwith his wife’s consent the therapist will often see him for periodic\r\ndiscussions. These talks help him to understand her problem, to see\r\ndeeply into the nature of his wife and therefore of all womankind.\r\nThis knowledge allows the husband to be of direct help in effecting\r\nhis wife’s release from the immobilizing grip of her frigidity. It\r\nhelps him to be patient where he might have been irritable, tender when\r\nhe might have been importunate; it keeps him from the major error of\r\nbelieving that he is to blame for her underlying condition and thus\r\ncomplicating the relationship by becoming defensive, as one unjustly\r\naccused would become--indeed, _should_.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises as to whether the kind of information a woman\r\nand her husband may receive during her therapy can also be helpful in\r\nbook form.\r\n\r\nI have given much thought to this question and have had many\r\nconsultations with my psychiatric colleagues about it. We have come to\r\nthe positive conclusion that a book on this subject can be of direct\r\nbenefit to all women suffering from sexual frigidity.\r\n\r\nI will go even further and say that the facts about frigidity that I\r\npresent here--its origins, its causes, and its cures--_must_ be known\r\nby every woman with a sexual problem if she wishes to be cured.\r\n\r\nFrigidity is always rooted in incomplete knowledge gained in childhood\r\nand adolescence. We are not, as I have pointed out, far from the\r\nVictorian age. Any woman of thirty or more had, in all probability,\r\nparents who were reared in the traditions of Victorianism, which denied\r\nthe sexuality of woman, connived with every available force to deny it,\r\nrepress it, stop it at its source. These efforts were extraordinarily\r\nsuccessful. And, too, any woman now in her twenties probably had\r\nparents who were deeply affected by the equally mindless and vicious\r\nprotest against Victorianism which characterized this country from,\r\nroughly, 1920 to 1930--the period we now call the Roaring Twenties or\r\nthe Jazz Age.\r\n\r\nThis era, too, was full of destructive misinformation about sex and\r\nlove. A program of sexual promiscuity for women was openly advocated\r\nand found far too many adherents in the younger generation after World\r\nWar I. The moral climate created in the Jazz Age was alien to the very\r\nnature of truly feminine love. It led to serious sexual conflicts in\r\nmillions of individuals, and these conflicts were duly visited on their\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nThis book then, I firmly believe, can help the individual to undo the\r\nearly harm caused by improper upbringing. I have tried to design it\r\nin such a manner that a woman who reads it completely may achieve a\r\ndeep understanding of frigidity, an understanding that can lead to a\r\nprofound inner change, a complete reversal of those attitudes that are\r\nalways at the root of frigidity.\r\n\r\nI have designed it, too, to be read by the husband of the woman who\r\nsuffers from frigidity. It goes without saying that the success of his\r\nmarriage is dependent on the resolution of her problem. He can help\r\ngreatly to ensure this resolution by fully informing himself of the\r\nnature of the problem and by discovering the most helpful role he can\r\nplay during her recovery.\r\n\r\nBut the problem of frigidity does not concern only the married. Thus I\r\nhave also aimed this book at those young people who are about to enter\r\ntheir first love experience. We have found that this first experience\r\ncan be of vast importance for the further emotional growth of the\r\nindividual and of the relationship upon which she has embarked. Young\r\nwomen who find they have problems in the sexual sphere may be spared\r\nyears of misery if they are given a real understanding of the matter in\r\nthe beginning. Many of my patients, had they been given an insight into\r\nthe nature of their difficulties at the start, might have avoided the\r\ninevitable and innumerable poor choices and often disastrous decisions\r\nwhich are so characteristic of the woman suffering from a sexual\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nSince I have designed this book to answer the needs of a specific\r\naudience I should like to ask you to read it through and not skip\r\naround trying to find the material that seems to apply directly to\r\nyou or to someone close to you. For, if you follow me as I go, you\r\nwill see that frigidity is not a single, simple, local symptom. It is\r\na complicated and profound problem involving many factors and having\r\nprofound consequences. One _can_ grasp the nature of this problem,\r\nunderstand it, and cure it. To do so, however, you must have very\r\nspecific and complete knowledge of it in all its complexity. It may\r\ntake all your powers to master this complexity. To do so, however, will\r\nbe more than merely worth while. It can be the first great step toward\r\nreal love, upon whose threshold you have tarried already far too long.\r\n\r\nBefore we advance into the subject itself, I should like to dispose of\r\na few widely held and thoroughly incorrect notions about frigidity. I\r\ndo this to clear away some of the underbrush which can impede those of\r\nyou who are seriously seeking a resolution of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us look at this problem of a woman’s sexual\r\n“responsibility,” as it has been recently called. Much has been written\r\nabout it and much of what I have read is pure nonsense, based on a\r\nsort of mechanical conception of what love is and of what the act of\r\nlove means. I fear that such books encourage women who have deeply\r\nrooted sexual difficulties to approach the problem from the wrong\r\ndirection and before they properly understand the real nature of\r\ntheir difficulties. Such an approach leads them to attempt abortive\r\n“solutions” which can only further discourage and disillusion them.\r\nThe basic error here is in trying to make the individual woman\r\n“responsible” without giving her any real information about her\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that no woman who suffers from frigidity consciously\r\ndesires to. Nor can she be, for a single second, held accountable for\r\nthe fact that the problem developed. The word “blame” cannot by any\r\nstretch of the imagination be used in connection with her problem. I\r\nstrongly urge you to let that point sink deeply into your heart and\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHow could it possibly be that you had any responsibility in the matter?\r\nThis problem always develops in childhood or even infancy. It is partly\r\na product of early family and historical influences over which you had\r\nnot the slightest control, and it is partly a matter of the biological\r\nheritage of all women everywhere. And you certainly can’t be held\r\nresponsible for that.\r\n\r\nHere is the attitude I have found most helpful to take toward this\r\nmatter of sexual responsibility: You are not responsible for having\r\ndeveloped a difficulty; you are not responsible for the existence of\r\nyour frigidity any more than the stutterer is responsible for his\r\nstutter. However, once you realize it is a problem, that it is having\r\nrepercussions on you and those dear to you, you are responsible for\r\nfinding out everything you can about the problem and then, on the basis\r\nof this information, taking whatever action is necessary.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned another important misconception about\r\nfrigidity and should like to go into it a bit further now. I have\r\nsaid that it is highly unlikely that the husband of a frigid woman is\r\nresponsible for her frigidity problem. I can’t emphasize that enough.\r\nOf course if he is impotent, was when his wife married him and has\r\ncontinued to be, she might have a case. But true sexual impotency in\r\nthe male is quite rare. Even, however, if he were truly impotent, the\r\nfact remains that this particular woman did marry him--we have found\r\nthat when a woman marries an inadequate man she has done so because\r\nshe, all unknown to herself, was deeply afraid of true male virility.\r\n\r\nIn saying the husband is rarely if ever to blame for a frigidity\r\nproblem I am running counter to a vast body of information that has\r\nbeen published; in the 1930’s in particular, book after book appeared,\r\neach showing conclusively that a happily married sexual life depended\r\non the male’s skill in arousing the woman. In such books the husband\r\nwas instructed to manipulate or caress her for X minutes in Y number of\r\nerotic zones. By then, presumably, she would have reached such a state\r\nof excitement that true sexual satisfaction could not possibly fail\r\nher. Any failure of a woman to respond adequately in the marital bed\r\nwas always supposed to be due to faulty technique on the husband’s part.\r\n\r\nThis is simply not true. Caressing or manipulating the genitalia or\r\nsecondary erotic zones of certain types of frigid women would only\r\nresult in exacerbated nerves or in a condition of inwardly screaming\r\nprotest. In other types, caressing might give temporary satisfaction\r\nbut in the long run could really be harmful from the psychological\r\nstandpoint, deepen or encourage immature methods of gratification.\r\n\r\nIn short, while a husband, through tenderness and understanding,\r\nmay help a woman face the true nature of her problem, he is never\r\nresponsible for the _existence_ of her frigidity and cannot, through\r\nany mechanical means, get her over it.\r\n\r\nI might add that neither can any man other than her husband.\r\n\r\nAnother misconception about frigidity: Women who suffer from a greater\r\nor lesser degree of frigidity often come to believe that there is\r\nsomething wrong with them glandularly. Through a misunderstanding of\r\nsomething they’ve read or heard, they get the idea that somewhere,\r\nsomehow, there is a drug that will cure them. A gynecologist I know\r\ntells me that he has at least three women a week ask him to give\r\nthem hormones to step up their sexual responses. On the basis of his\r\nstatement I have checked with several other gynecologists and also with\r\nfive obstetricians. They all tell me that the request for hormonal\r\ninjections from women is a daily constant.\r\n\r\nLet me say here that frigidity is rarely a problem of glandular\r\nmalfunction. Much work has now been done in this area and, unless your\r\ncase is relatively unusual, you may rest assured that your problem is\r\nbasically a personal and psychological one.\r\n\r\nHow can I be so certain of that last statement? Because real frigidity\r\nreacts to psychological treatment; it can generally be cured in a\r\npsychiatrist’s office without the use of any drugs whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf you reply: “Well, perhaps the mind has caused a glandular shutdown\r\nin women with a frigidity problem,” we would answer: “Even if that\r\nwere true the mind would still be the ‘cause,’ and a real cure can be\r\neffected only by getting at the cause.”\r\n\r\nA far more serious misunderstanding of the nature of true feminine\r\nsexuality and of the nature of frigidity is shown by the following\r\ncase, told to me by a psychiatric colleague.\r\n\r\nA pretty young woman came to him stating that she had been unable to\r\nhave sexual satisfaction in intercourse. She had told her physician\r\nof her problem two years previously. He had examined her and told her\r\nthat her clitoris was too far from her vagina. He informed her that\r\nthis biological fact made it impossible for her husband to contact the\r\nclitoris with his penis during intercourse and that this was causing\r\nher frigidity. The physician advised an operation which would bring the\r\nclitoris and the vagina closer together, thus allowing the penis to\r\ncontact the clitoris during intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe woman, in all good faith and with a laudable desire to be a\r\ngood wife, had gone through with this grotesque surgical procedure.\r\nAfter the operation, when she was able to have intercourse again,\r\nit had apparently worked. For two months she had had orgasms during\r\nintercourse. Then slowly but surely her ability to respond disappeared.\r\nWithin three months she had become totally frigid.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more mistaken than such an approach to the solution\r\nof a sexual problem in a woman. In the first place, surgery performed\r\non the genitalia of a woman who is already sexually disturbed can\r\ncause profound shock to her psychologically, deepen her disturbance\r\nimmeasurably--such was the case with this woman, my colleague told me.\r\nSecond, the fact that the clitoris and not the vagina is responsive\r\nis a form of frigidity in itself. Even if this maddeningly ridiculous\r\noperation had worked in the manner the physician had hoped, it would\r\nonly have perpetuated a situation that was in itself, psychologically\r\nspeaking, pathological.\r\n\r\nThe psychiatrist did not have an easy time with this patient. The\r\ntraumatic experience caused by the operation and its failure had\r\ntaken a toll, and it took several months for her to recover from the\r\npsychological effects. But she was a determined young woman.\r\n\r\nWhen she became convinced that the solution of her problem lay in\r\ndiscovering the hidden misunderstandings about sexuality that had\r\noccurred earlier in her life, she set about this task with a will. In\r\na relatively short time, through insight and understanding, by getting\r\nthe entire picture of frigidity and its meaning, she began to undo the\r\nGordian knot that even the surgeon’s keen knife could not cut. At the\r\nroot of her problem lay a totally hidden fear of pregnancy which she\r\nwas able to face and dispense with. Today she has two children and,\r\naccording to my colleague, is not only sexually normal but very happy\r\nin her marriage.\r\n\r\nLet me make myself absolutely clear, even at the risk of repeating\r\nmyself. Frigidity is in the vast majority of cases, essentially a\r\npsychological problem. The _only_ way it can be approached with any\r\nhope of resolving it is through the mind, by understanding it. Anybody\r\nwho tells you differently is, to put it plainly and simply, wrong. And,\r\nif you have a real frigidity problem and try to ascribe other than\r\npsychological reasons for it (such as that your husband is the cause\r\nof it), you are doing your cause (that of getting over the problem) a\r\ngrave disservice.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the problem of frigidity is a psychological one\r\nI am not overstating the case; I am, to simplify matters, rather\r\nunderstating it. The greatest contribution of psychiatry in the past\r\nsixty years has been the discovery of the central importance of\r\nsexuality in the development of the individual.\r\n\r\nDr. Therese Benedek in her classic work, _Psychosexual Functions in\r\nWomen_, states the whole matter succinctly when she says: “ … The\r\nsexual drive … is the axis around which the organization of the\r\npersonality takes place.”\r\n\r\nWhen all goes well in the development of the young girl, both her\r\npersonality and her sexual passions will flower, she will achieve\r\na beautiful and integrated maturity. But if, as so often happens,\r\nthwarting or blighting experiences take place, the development of her\r\npersonality and her sexuality will be frozen at their sources, and\r\nmaturity will remain a never-never land whose very existence she will\r\ncome to doubt.\r\n\r\nIf she wishes to resume her growth she must be fearless, she must find\r\nout and face the events that blocked her growth, the misunderstandings\r\nand ignorance that prevent her from reaping the rewards of true\r\nwomanhood. She must insist, deep within herself, on achieving that\r\ntrue and passional relatedness with her man for which there is neither\r\nsimulacrum nor substitute in woman’s journey through life.\r\n\r\nThe bridge to emotional and sexual maturity is built of many\r\nfacts--hard, scientific facts. Master these facts, gain information on\r\nthis subject, and you can pass from a land of bitter deprivation to the\r\nrichness that is your due, your heritage. It is waiting for you on the\r\nother side of your fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I\r\n\r\n                          _The Normal Woman_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Chapter 2_\r\n\r\n                           THE NORMAL ORGASM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing I am going to do on this, so to speak, journey with you\r\nis to give you a view of your destination. I am going to describe an\r\norgasm to you. I am going to describe it in detail.\r\n\r\nWe occasionally do this in psychiatry when dealing with a frigidity\r\nproblem, and sometimes it has astonishing results. I have seen women\r\nwho, after hearing for the first time a complete description from an\r\nauthoritative and objective person of what to expect of themselves in\r\nthe act of love, almost immediately win through to the sensual goal\r\nthey had been deprived of.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a patient of mine, who over a period of months had\r\nworked through a rather severe frigidity problem, detailed to her\r\nyounger sister the wonderful sexual experience she was now able to\r\nhave. The younger sister had been married only two months and had not\r\nonce reached sexual climax. She had seriously contemplated consulting\r\na psychiatrist about her “problem.” The very night her older sister\r\ndescribed true orgasm to her she was able to achieve her own first\r\ncomplete satisfaction with her husband.\r\n\r\nHowever, my chief motive in approaching the subject of frigidity\r\nby describing the normal orgasm is not to try to bring about a\r\nsudden or miraculous cure. In cases where such a sudden release of\r\nmature sexuality is achieved and thaw comes like a sudden spring,\r\nthe frigidity problem is generally, even though it may appear to be\r\ndeep-seated, a superficial one, lightly rooted in the personality.\r\n\r\nThe real reason I start with the orgasm is that a picture of the normal\r\nis an absolute necessity if you are to understand deviations from it\r\nwith any real clarity. It is a truism that in order to understand\r\nillness in the body it is first necessary to understand health. Every\r\ndoctor knows this and so do his teachers, for in medical school he\r\nfirst learns, through classes in anatomy and physiology, the structure\r\nand functions of the healthy body.\r\n\r\nI think you will understand frigidity more thoroughly if we pursue the\r\nsame technique here, first describing the genital anatomy of woman and\r\nfrom there proceeding to a description of the normal orgasm, what it\r\nis, where it is located, its function in the healthy man and woman, and\r\nother pertinent material.\r\n\r\nDespite the wide dissemination of sexual information in our time, many\r\nwomen often show an astonishing ignorance of their own genital region\r\nand of the character and meaning of sexual response, including orgasm.\r\nI have had patients who did not know that they possessed a clitoris,\r\nothers who made no distinction between their urethra and their vagina;\r\nsome have not known of the existence of the uterus as a separate organ,\r\nand some, in confusion about their uniquely feminine secretions, have\r\nbelieved that women can have a seminal ejaculation as men do. Perhaps\r\nmost of the readers of this book will have no such misinformation, but\r\nnevertheless I feel it is wise to review the simple facts pertaining to\r\nthe feminine genitalia.\r\n\r\nBefore making a detailed description of woman’s sexual apparatus, I\r\nshould like to make a preliminary observation which can help you to\r\nunderstand the sexual nature of woman. It is this: that while women\r\nare capable of having true sexual gratification in the same sense and\r\nwith the same intensity as men, they have one important difference\r\nin their responses. The man, when he is aroused, feels the sexual\r\ndesire directly in his genitals. A woman’s first sexual sensations\r\nare not usually genital but are felt over her entire body, on her\r\nskin surfaces, everywhere; _this_ is followed by sexual excitation\r\nin her genitals, and this is an important fact for both men and\r\nwomen to understand. Ignorance of this fact has given rise to many\r\nmisunderstandings between the sexes, for of course it makes the\r\nwoman somewhat slower in reaching the moment when she is ready for\r\nintercourse than the man is. It _must_ be taken into consideration by\r\nboth parties to an act of love.\r\n\r\nA woman’s genital apparatus is both internal and external. The external\r\ngenitalia are called the vulva when they are referred to all together.\r\nThe most obvious part of the vulva is the part we called the major (or\r\nsometimes outer) lips, which enfold the rest of the genitalia. If these\r\nlips are parted we see two smaller lips; these are called the minor\r\nlips and have a very high degree of sexual responsiveness. Even in\r\nbooks for laymen the Latin words are often used for these two organs:\r\n_labia majoris_ and _labia minoris_, which mean, simply enough, the\r\nmajor lips and the minor lips.\r\n\r\nThe labia majoris also contain within their folds the rest of the\r\nexternal genital structure of woman. Here we find the clitoris, the\r\nvestibule, and the urethra, or opening to the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe clitoris is by far the most important and most widely misunderstood\r\npart of the external genitalia. It lies immediately above the top fold\r\nof the labia minoris and is a little piece of tissue slightly less\r\nthick than a pencil. This organ is enormously important to the whole\r\npsychological and sexual development of the individual woman. It is\r\noften called the “homologue of the male penis,” and this simply means\r\nthat in the embryo the cells which form the penis in the male are the\r\nsame cells which form the clitoris in the female. Thus the two organs\r\nhave the same cellular derivation.\r\n\r\nThe clitoris, like the male penis, is made up of erectile tissue, and\r\nwhen a woman is sexually excited it becomes erect in the same manner\r\nthat the penis does. It also has a head and a foreskin covering it,\r\nand the head of the clitoris, at least in children and adolescents,\r\nis generally extremely sensitive to stimulation. In the fully mature\r\nfemale this sensitivity often diminishes, giving way to the vagina as\r\nthe primary source of the greatest sexual pleasure. However, many women\r\nwho become fully mature sexually maintain much of the original sexual\r\nresponsiveness of the clitoris.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the external genitalia is contained within the\r\nvestibule. This is the entrance proper to the vagina and is very\r\nsusceptible to sexual excitation. The vestibule lies between the minor\r\nlips and is directly beneath the clitoris. It contains the hymen, the\r\nurethral opening, and the openings of the glands of Bartholin.\r\n\r\nThe hymen is generally referred to as the maidenhead. It is a thin\r\nmembrane which partly covers the entrance to the vagina. There is no\r\ndirect sexual sensation on the hymen, and sometimes pain is experienced\r\nwhen it is perforated, usually during the first intercourse, although\r\nthe hymen can be broken by an accident in childhood, through the\r\ninsertion of surgical instruments, etc. Because of the pain associated\r\nwith its perforation and the stories that a young girl often hears\r\nabout this pain, it can be a source of much anxiety to her and\r\ncondition her attitude toward sex in general.\r\n\r\nThe glands of Bartholin are of great importance to the act of love.\r\nThese glands discharge a thin colorless mucus in sexual excitation,\r\nand this lubricates the vaginal opening and canal during intercourse.\r\nThe amount of secretion varies greatly with each individual. Sexual\r\nfrigidity often affects these glands adversely, causing the secretions\r\nto be inadequate or nonexistent. However, the amount of secretion will\r\nalso vary rather dramatically at times in the individual who has no\r\nbasic sexual blocking, and therefore the glands of Bartholin cannot be\r\ntaken as a final criterion of sexual adequacy or inadequacy.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the most important part of a woman’s anatomical\r\nsexual equipment: the vagina. This is a passageway of some three to\r\nthree and a half inches which extends from the vestibule on the outside\r\nof the cervix, which is the bottom end of the uterus. The vagina is,\r\nof course, the canal which accepts the penis, and it may interest you\r\nto know that in Latin the word literally means “a sheath for a sword.”\r\nThe sexual act in its purest form expresses the essential passivity\r\nassociated with women and the aggressiveness of the male, the actor and\r\nthe acted upon. The Romans understood this basic difference at least\r\nlinguistically.\r\n\r\nIt may have surprised you to learn of the relatively short length of\r\nthe vagina. The tissue of its walls are extremely elastic, however, and\r\nnot only can it contain a penis of virtually any thickness or length,\r\nbut it can stretch enough to allow the newborn infant to pass through\r\nit. The penis presses against the cervical end of the uterus, which may\r\nbe forced upward until the penis gains full entrance. Contact with the\r\nsoft tissue of the cervix is a source of great pleasure for the male,\r\nand the pressure can be an equal pleasure for the woman.\r\n\r\nThe vaginal walls are lined with a soft skin, not unlike mucous\r\nmembrane, but it does not secrete as mucous tissue will. A secretion\r\nis, however, released from the cervix, and this also helps to lubricate\r\nthe vaginal canal during intercourse.\r\n\r\nI have said that the vagina is the most important part of a woman’s\r\nsexual equipment. This is so because it is within the vagina that the\r\norgasm of the truly mature woman takes place. Upon it and within it she\r\nreceives the greatest sensual pleasure that it is possible for a woman\r\nto experience.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the subject of orgasm. I think you will\r\nunderstand it more fully if I describe it in the context of the sexual\r\nexperience as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe sexual instinct in both men and women is marvelously complex. When\r\nit is unencumbered by neurosis it gives color, shape, brightness,\r\ncharm, vividness, and direction to the entire personality, and the\r\nmechanisms by which it operates encompass both body and mind.\r\n\r\nDesire can be set off in a woman either in response to a touch or by\r\nsome act, sight, or thought which she has been exposed to. One of the\r\nchief things to which a woman responds is a cumulative tenderness\r\nexpressed in words or in acts.\r\n\r\nWhatever the stimulus, however, the brain receives the signal and,\r\nthrough the nervous system, sends out preparatory reactions throughout\r\nthe body. The response of men to stimuli perceived by the brain as\r\nsexual is amazingly fast; some men arrive at full sexual preparedness\r\nfor intercourse within three seconds--that is, their penis becomes\r\nfully erect and ready to enter the vagina within that time. Women\r\nreact, on the whole, somewhat more slowly, though full preparation for\r\nintercourse, under the best of conditions, is often only a matter of a\r\nfew more seconds than the man’s.\r\n\r\nAs the sexual excitement increases, tremendous changes go on throughout\r\nthe body, changes that might frighten you if they occurred under other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe pulse rate goes up astonishingly. There are records of its reaching\r\n150 and more as the individual approaches and then reaches the sexual\r\nclimax. Such pulse rates generally occur, in health, only in athletes\r\nwho are performing prodigious tasks of speed or endurance.\r\n\r\nThe blood pressure, too, goes up precipitately. In a matter of a few\r\nseconds it can rise well over 100 points. Breathing also becomes much\r\ndeeper and swifter. With the approach of orgasm the breathing becomes\r\ninterrupted; inspiration comes in forced gasps and expiration occurs\r\nwith a heavy collapse of the lungs. It is as though the sexually\r\nexcited person had been in a race.\r\n\r\nAs the sexual act continues there is a general shortage of oxygen\r\nthroughout the body, which accounts for the unusual breathing. This\r\ngives rise to a tortured expression on the face, as if the person\r\nwere undergoing severe pain. This fact has been observed by Kinsey in\r\nhis famous study of female sexuality, and I quote here an interesting\r\nparagraph on the phenomenon:\r\n\r\n“ … Prostitutes who attempt to deceive (jive) their patrons, or\r\nunresponsive wives who similarly attempt to make their husbands believe\r\nthat they are enjoying coitus, fall into an error because they assume\r\nthat an erotically aroused person should look happy and pleased and\r\nshould smile and become increasingly alert as he or she approaches the\r\nculmination of the act. On the contrary, an individual who is really\r\nresponding is as incapable of looking happy as the individual who is\r\nbeing tortured.”\r\n\r\nWithin seconds after sexual arousal the blood supply in the veins and\r\narteries lying close to the skin increases, causing the body to become\r\nflushed and the temperature to rise slightly. Certain areas of the body\r\nare engorged with this blood, become swollen and erect, notably the\r\npenis of the man, which swells, often to twice its size. In women, this\r\nalso happens to the clitoris, which becomes firm, and to the nipples\r\nof both sexes. The firmness of these organs increases as the sexual\r\nclimax approaches.\r\n\r\nMuscles throughout the body begin to tense at the onset of sexual\r\nexcitement, and this tension increases as the excitement grows.\r\nCertain glands and tissues also increase their secretions as the\r\nsexual act commences and moves closer to completion. The salivary\r\nglands and the nasal mucosa flow freely, and it is this latter fact\r\nwhich causes, in conjunction with the engorgement of the surface blood\r\nvessels, the characteristic nasal stuffiness so many people notice\r\nafter intercourse. In some women the secretions of the glands of\r\nBartholin and the mucus from the cervix of the uterus become amazingly\r\ncopious as sexual excitement rises, and particularly during orgasm\r\nitself. This profuse flow may have given rise to the widely held and\r\nentirely mistaken idea I have mentioned--that in orgasm women have an\r\nejaculation similar to the male’s. There is no such ejaculation--nor\r\nindeed any female organ that could make one possible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most amazing aspects of sexual intercourse is the fact\r\nthat all five senses become extremely dulled as the act increases in\r\nintensity. The ability to feel hot and cold, to feel pain, or to hear\r\nsounds becomes almost nonexistent. The eyes take on a characteristic\r\ntrance-like stare, and vision becomes constricted. The entire mind and\r\nbody are concentrated fully on the mounting sexual feeling and exclude\r\nall else. In orgasm itself the anesthesia of the senses is almost\r\ntotal. Indeed many people experience a temporary loss of consciousness\r\nfor a matter of seconds. Some, according to Kinsey’s findings, remain\r\nunconscious for two or more minutes.\r\n\r\nThis last fact brings us to our examination of the experience of orgasm\r\nitself. If you are to understand frigidity in women it is of tremendous\r\nimportance to grasp the nature of orgasm and what it means physically\r\nand psychologically. The importance of such understanding is due, of\r\ncourse, to the fact that orgasm, of the type described here, is the\r\nvery thing the frigid woman is unable to have. In fact, its absence\r\nfrom her experience is the usual definition of frigidity. Certain\r\nkinds of frigid women may experience one, two, or all of the physical\r\nand psychological reactions described above, which normally would\r\nterminate with orgasm. But the final experience eludes them; at the\r\nvital juncture the body, despite an agonizing need to come to a climax,\r\nrefuses to respond; it draws back, goes dead.\r\n\r\nOrgasm is the physiological response which brings sexual intercourse\r\nto its natural and beautiful termination. It is preceded by a very\r\ndramatic increase in all of the phenomena noted above. In the moment\r\njust preceding orgasm, muscular tension suddenly rises to the point\r\nwhere, if the sexual instinct were not in operation, it would become\r\nphysically unendurable. The pelvic motions of the man and the movement\r\nof the penis back and forth within the vagina increase in speed and\r\nin intensity of thrust. The woman’s pelvic movements also increase,\r\nand her whole body attempts with every move to heighten the exquisite\r\nsensations she is experiencing within her vagina. According to many\r\nwomen with whom I have discussed this experience, the greatest pleasure\r\nis caused by the sensation of fullness within the vagina and the\r\npressure and friction upon its posterior surface.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of greatest muscular tension all sensations seem to take\r\none further rise upward. The woman tenses beyond the point where, it\r\nseems, it would be possible to maintain such tension for a moment\r\nlonger. And indeed it is not possible, and now her whole body suddenly\r\nplunges into a series of muscular spasms. These spasms take place\r\nwithin the vagina itself, shaking the body with waves of pleasure. They\r\nare felt simultaneously throughout the body: in the torso, face, arms,\r\nand legs--down to the very soles of the feet.\r\n\r\nThese spasms, which shake the entire body and converge upon the vagina,\r\nrepresent and define true orgasm. At this moment the woman’s head is\r\nthrown back and her pelvis tips upward in an attempt to obtain as\r\nmuch penetration from the penis as is possible. The spasms continue\r\nfor several seconds in most women, though the time varies with every\r\nindividual, and in some women they may continue though with decreasing\r\nintensity, for a minute or even more.\r\n\r\nMany women can repeat this performance two or more times before\r\ntheir partner has his orgasm. The pathway, neurologically and\r\npsychologically, has been set for orgasm and, if her partner continues\r\nshe can respond. I have had women report that the last orgasm is\r\nsometimes more intense and satisfying than the first.\r\n\r\nIf the woman is satisfied by her orgasmic experience she will discharge\r\nthe neurological and muscular tension developed in the sexual build-up.\r\nWhen satisfaction has been achieved, her strenuous movements cease\r\nand within a short period blood pressure, pulse, glandular secretion,\r\nmuscular tension, and all the other gross physical changes which\r\ncharacterize sexual excitement return to normal, or even to subnormal,\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThere have been detailed studies made of the physical reactions of both\r\nmen and women during intercourse. I think it is important to realize\r\nthat in almost every detail, including orgasm, these reactions and the\r\nsubjective experience of pleasure parallel each other in the sexes. The\r\nmajor differences are that the woman is slightly slower to respond at\r\nthe outset than the man, and the orgasm of the man is characterized by\r\nthe ejaculation of sperm into the vagina.\r\n\r\nFull sexual satisfaction is followed by a state of utter calm. The\r\nbody feels absolutely quiescent. Psychologically the person feels\r\ncompletely satisfied, at peace with the world and all things in it. The\r\nwoman in particular feels extremely loving toward the partner who has\r\ngiven her so much joy, such a transport of ecstasy. Often she wishes to\r\nhold him close for a while, to linger tenderly in the now subdued glow\r\nof their passion.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from this description, orgasm is a tremendous\r\nexperience. There is no physiological or psychological experience that\r\nparallels its sweeping intensity or its excruciating pleasure. It is\r\nunique.\r\n\r\nThere are many who take a mystical view of this ecstatic coupling of\r\nman and woman in love. They think of it as a symbol of a lost unity\r\nbetween the sexes that strives to reassert itself in the act of love.\r\nOthers see in it a foretaste of heaven, the carnal representation of\r\nendless spiritual delights for mankind. Many who are able to experience\r\norgasm in intercourse find it difficult not to ascribe some purposive\r\nintent on the part of the Creator; the experience is that profound.\r\n\r\nThe individual perceives orgasm as a reward equal to none. It puts the\r\nsacrifices and compromises necessary to an enduring marriage into their\r\nproper perspectives, makes the constant giving done by the woman seem\r\nnot only worth while but highly desirable. It is the strongest link in\r\nthe unbreakable bond between two who love.\r\n\r\nDo you recall Tennessee Williams’ play _A Streetcar Named Desire_?\r\nIn one of its most famous passages the frigid (and promiscuous)\r\nolder woman attempts to break up the marriage of her younger sister,\r\nappealing to a spurious pride of class, pointing out that the younger\r\nwoman has married beneath her, married a beer-drinking, poker-playing\r\ncommon day laborer. The younger woman is almost convinced that she\r\nshould act on the false values of her sister. After all, these values\r\nhad been inculcated in both women by the same parents and they went\r\ndeep. The young girl’s husband saves her, however; he simply reminds\r\nher of the pinwheels she sees, of the high music of the bells she\r\nhears when they embrace in love. It is enough. She returns to him\r\nwithout a word. The bond of their wonderful sexual life is unbreakable,\r\nfar stronger than the powerful and subtle assault the envious and\r\ndestructive sister can make upon the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe ability to have a full orgasm is, in most cases, the hallmark\r\nof the psychologically mature woman. It is the sign that she has\r\nsuccessfully weathered the storms of childhood and youth and come,\r\nunscathed, into full womanhood, with all that it implies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Chapter 3_\r\n\r\n                        THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat _is_ the mature woman? Who is she? What are her characteristics?\r\nHer personality? Her role in life?\r\n\r\nIt is of vital importance to an understanding of the frigid woman to\r\nanswer these questions, for again, only by understanding what health\r\nis, can we truly grasp the meaning of any departure from it.\r\n\r\nThere have been great arguments about what the word “normal” means.\r\nMillions of words have been written about it. I fear that most of them\r\nhave only clouded the issue. Odd definitions of normalcy have led\r\nmillions of women down very odd and unhappy paths. You will recall, for\r\nexample, that Victorianism elevated frigidity to the position of the\r\nnorm for all womankind--with disastrous results.\r\n\r\nAt the start of my practice I encountered another strange and tragic\r\nview of the normal that has had a powerful influence on American women.\r\nThis view, which we will encounter in more detail when the feminist\r\nmovement is discussed later, still has wide repercussions and is\r\nintimately bound with the subject of frigidity and divorce.\r\n\r\nIn my introduction to it a lovely woman of forty came to consult\r\nme. She was deeply disturbed and could hardly speak, she wept so.\r\nSomehow I felt at once that there was a deep rage behind those\r\ntears. I recognized her name when she was able to get it out; she\r\nwas a successful lawyer whose name many would still recognize in all\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nIn her thirty-ninth year she had fallen in love for the first time with\r\na fine man, another successful lawyer. Her dormant sexuality and true\r\nfemininity had been awakened completely in her since their marriage\r\na year before, and they both now wanted children badly. However, a\r\nphysical examination had indicated (as unhappily it so often seems to\r\ndo for women who postpone their first pregnancy for too long), that she\r\nwould have to have a hysterectomy, for she had developed a tumor in the\r\nwall of her uterus.\r\n\r\nShe felt cruelly deprived, and I saw her for several sessions. During\r\nthese periods she told me of her background. Her father had died\r\nwhen she was an infant and her mother had been a militant leader of\r\nthe movement for women’s “rights.” The whole emphasis in her early\r\nupbringing had been on achievement in the male world, and in the male\r\nsense of the word. She had been taught to be competitive with men, to\r\nlook upon them as basically inimical to women. Women were portrayed as\r\nan exploited and badly put upon minority class. Marriage, childbearing,\r\nand love were traps that placed one in the hands of the enemy, man,\r\nwhose chief desire was to enslave woman. Her mother had profoundly\r\ninculcated in her the belief that women were to work in the market\r\nplace at all cost, to be aggressive, to take love (à la Russe) where\r\nthey found it, and to be tied down by nothing, no one; no more, as her\r\nmother put it, than a man is.\r\n\r\nSuch a definition of the normal had, of course, made her fearful of\r\na real or deep or enduring relationship with a man. For years she\r\nsedulously avoided men entirely. Gradually, through her grown-up\r\nexperiences, she learned of other values, but by the time the right\r\nman came along it was too late to have children.\r\n\r\nI was right that her tears had been tears of rage. They were directed\r\nat her mother’s authoritarian but totally mistaken view of the feminine\r\nrole in life and were, to my mind, justified. When she had sufficiently\r\nvented her righteous anger, but not until then, we were able to move on\r\nto more practical matters. Her marriage was a happy one, and finally\r\nshe adopted two children. With some of her values revised she made a\r\nwonderful mother for them. I visited this family only recently, and\r\nit seems to be one of the happiest and healthiest, psychologically\r\nspeaking, I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nMost women who have been reared with such ideas of what is normal\r\nare not so fortunate, however. They cling to their defensive and\r\nself-destructive values to the end, which is often bitter.\r\n\r\nAnd there are, still, passionately convinced and often eloquent\r\npurveyors of these ideas. After reading the brilliant best seller,\r\n_The Second Sex_, by Simone de Beauvoir, the French authoress, I was\r\nsaddened to see such clarity and brilliance in the service of such a\r\nmistaken cause. Her tacit conclusions seem to be that woman’s historic\r\nrole of wife and mother are degrading to our sex, have kept woman from\r\nher true destiny. As she describes what that true destiny is, however,\r\nher clarity departs, and the role and function of this woman of the\r\nfuture become more than merely vague. Their foggy contours remind me of\r\nthe glamorous-sounding but totally evanescent and mist-enshrouded goals\r\nthat many of the frigid and lonely women I treat have when they first\r\ncome for help.\r\n\r\nThere is _no_ vagueness about the goals, functions, and needs of the\r\nnormal woman. Science in recent years has thrown a bright light on\r\nher, and that is why we can be certain of many fundamental details\r\nabout her. She is a mature, fully functioning woman, a woman who\r\nhas realized the better part of her potentialities, who knows how to\r\nachieve and handle love and happiness, who has won through to a fully\r\nsatisfying mental and sexual life.\r\n\r\nI very frequently draw a word portrait of such a woman for patients\r\nwho come to consult me about their sexual problem. It often makes them\r\nangry, and they deeply resent some of the characteristics of this\r\nidealized woman. They call her all sorts of names: “a victim of the\r\nmale,” “an impossible ideal.” One eloquent younger woman called her “a\r\nfaceless tramp,” and I have heard older women, brought up under a more\r\ninhibited code than exists now, call her “a shameless hussy.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet despite the hostility that my portrait is often greeted with\r\nthere is soon other evidence in my troubled listeners that they have\r\nbeen touched deeply by the idea that such a picture of womanhood might\r\nconceivably be a possibility for them. “Do you really think I could\r\never get to be anything like that?” The yearning question, phrased in\r\nany number of wistful ways, will inevitably come, despite the obvious\r\nhostility, the bristling defenses, the fact that the speaker is scared\r\nblue of sex and motherhood and all they mean.\r\n\r\nYou see, women want to find themselves, desperately want to. And in\r\nthis portrait they get a hint, often the first they have ever had, of\r\nwhat to aim for, of the real potential inside themselves.\r\n\r\nI call this subject of my sketch “idealized,” and she is. But I want to\r\nemphasize that she is not a personal idle daydream of my own, based on\r\nairy nothingness; very much the contrary. Her characteristics are based\r\non exact and thoroughly checked psychological and biological facts,\r\nfacts upon which the leading scientists in this field are in general\r\nagreement. And she is a composite based on observations of women I\r\nhave known, and not always clinically. If you stop to think as you read\r\nabout her, you may realize that you have known such women too.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is she like? First of all to give us a frame for our\r\nportrait so that we can see what we _do_ know more clearly, let me\r\nstate what we cannot know about her; what, in fact, is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWe don’t know what she looks like. She may be tall or short,\r\nred-haired, blond, or brunette. She may have large breasts and round\r\nhips and sloping shoulders, or she may be small-breasted (or even\r\nflat-chested), have wide shoulders and narrow hips. She may have a\r\ncareer or not have a career, be more intelligent and better educated\r\nthan her husband or less intelligent and less well educated. She may\r\nhave children or be unable to have children. She may be rich or poor,\r\ncome from the “400” or from the slums. She may be a bit shy or quite at\r\nease socially. She may be athletic or totally unathletic. These things\r\nwe don’t know about her and, for our purposes, they do not matter.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things we do know.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, she is very much “at home” in the world. Deep\r\ninside herself she feels profoundly secure, safe, both with herself and\r\nwith her husband. She is very, very glad to be a woman, with all the\r\nduties, responsibilities, and joys it entails. She can’t imagine what\r\nit would be like to be a man and has no interest in imagining it as a\r\npossible role for herself. She feels that the very existence of her\r\nhusband makes the world safe for her.\r\n\r\nThis feeling may seem unrealistic, in view of the very clear\r\ninsecurities in the world today. As you will discover, however, it is\r\nbased on a far deeper understanding of reality, on a far deeper reality\r\nthan the one reflected in the alarums published in the daily newspaper.\r\n\r\nThis sense of reality almost invariably leads her to select a husband\r\nwho is good for her, often near perfect, in fact. He might not be\r\nperfect for another woman, nor perfect in any ultimate sense, but he\r\nis near perfect for _her_. He loves her and intends to go on loving\r\nher. He may be a carpenter or an architect, a lawyer, a dock hand, or a\r\npoet, but he, with her, is passionate and loyal, a good companion and\r\na good father for her children. She has an infallible sense about this\r\nmatter, and though she may have had an adolescent or college crush on a\r\nno-gooder, she simply never will marry him.\r\n\r\nOf course marrying a good husband adds to her sense of “at-homeness”\r\nin the world. Related to this feeling in her, to her sense of\r\nsecurity, seeming almost to spring from it, indeed, is a profound\r\ndelight in giving to those she loves. Psychiatrists, who consider this\r\ncharacteristic the hallmark, the _sine qua non_, of the truly feminine\r\ncharacter, have a name for it: they call it “essential feminine\r\naltruism.”\r\n\r\nAs you will see, it too has its roots in woman’s biology, is, on its\r\ndeepest level, a need in her that must have expression. The finest\r\nflower of this altruism blossoms in her joy in giving _the very best\r\nof herself_ to her husband and to her children. She never resents this\r\nneed in herself to give; she never interprets its manifestations as\r\na burden to her, an imposition on her. It pervades her nature as the\r\ncolor green pervades the countryside in the spring, and she is proud of\r\nit and delights in it.\r\n\r\nIt is this altruism, this givingness, that motivates her to keep her\r\nequilibrium, to hold onto her _joie de vivre_ despite whatever may\r\nbefall. It stands her in marvelous stead for all the demands that life\r\nis going to make on her--and they will be considerable. When a woman\r\ndoes not have this instinctually based altruism available to her, or\r\nwhen she denies that it is a desirable trait, life’s continuous small\r\nmisfortunes leave her in a glowering rage, helpless and beside herself\r\nwith self-pity.\r\n\r\nAnother fact about her which you may be surprised to learn is that\r\nshe is deeply religious--though not officially or even consciously.\r\nIn fact, if her husband’s background has been antagonistic to formal\r\nreligion and he is still reflecting his background, she may pay lip\r\nservice to his agnosticism or even atheism. But that doesn’t mean a\r\nthing. Just beneath the surface is an absolutely firm belief in the\r\nexistence of a Creator and in some form of heaven. She’s not so clear\r\nabout hell.\r\n\r\nShe also believes firmly in the fact that marriage is a sacrament,\r\nbinding forever. Given the slightest encouragement or support, she\r\nwill formalize these beliefs, join a church or develop a kind of\r\npersonal pantheism. Why? Biologically speaking, she is the carrier\r\nof immortality, of the generations of man. This gives her a close\r\naffinity to and appreciation of the awesome and creative mysteries of\r\nthe universe: moonrise, tidal flow, the growth, death, and rebirth of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nSexually she almost always reaches a climax during the act of love.\r\nSometimes she reaches two or, if she and her husband are feeling\r\nparticularly lusty, even three. But the number of times is unimportant,\r\ndespite the Kinsey report.\r\n\r\nWhat _is_ important is the _kind_ of orgasm she has. It is of the kind\r\ndescribed in the previous chapter, of course; the kind that starts deep\r\nwithin her vagina and extends to all parts of her body. She doesn’t\r\ntalk about it very often, but when she does it is always poetically.\r\nI have heard one woman refer to it as “a sensation of such beauty\r\nand intensity that I can hardly think of it without weeping”; of it\r\nanother said, “It’s like a mounting symphony, rising in tremendous and\r\nirresistible rhythms till your whole being feels as though it has been\r\nswept away.” One woman, less lyrical but still exact, said, “It’s like\r\ngoing over Niagara Falls in a barrel.” Nobody can ever _quite_ evoke\r\nthe exact sensations in words, but, as one woman told me, “Nobody who\r\nhas ever had it will doubt whether her experience is the real thing.”\r\n\r\nWhat else characterizes her sexually? Well, she’s not very modest, I’m\r\nafraid. In fact, she’s quite a show-off and likes sexual compliments\r\nfrom her husband, dressed or undressed, verbal or otherwise. Her\r\nnineteenth-century sister would have been vastly shocked by her whole\r\nattitude in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nShe’s not sexually shy at all. She wouldn’t demur a moment at\r\ninitiating love with her husband, though she will immediately change\r\nher amorous direction if she finds he is too tired or is preoccupied,\r\nwithout feeling the least bit rejected. Don’t forget that, for one\r\nthing, just under the surface (and sometimes on it) she considers her\r\nmarriage a heaven-made arrangement that is going to last forever, and\r\nshe need not look upon any one experience as too important in itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another very important point. I have indicated that\r\nsexually she takes her cue from her husband. What does she know, do you\r\nsuppose--know deeply and instinctively--that makes her do this, while\r\nother women refuse to?\r\n\r\nShe knows this: that it is the man who, from the purely physical\r\nviewpoint, has to be ready before sexual intercourse can take place.\r\nNo matter how many books have been written that ignore the fact, it\r\nis nevertheless true that, if the man does not have an erection,\r\nlove-making cannot take place.\r\n\r\nJust think about it for a moment. A woman _can_ make love at any time;\r\na man only when he is ready. There may be psychologically preferential\r\ncircumstances for a woman, but there is no physical prerequisite.\r\n\r\nThat is why (by virtue of that deeper sense of reality we spoke of)\r\nwhen her husband is ready to make love our lady is nearly always\r\nwilling, barring sickness or certain difficulties that may come up\r\nduring pregnancy. And that is why she is always willing to forgo\r\nlove-making if he is not ready. Her deep altruism makes her extremely\r\nsensitive to his moods, and she will not find it in herself to treat\r\nhim as if he were a robot, become angry or feel rejected when, if the\r\nbutton is pushed, he doesn’t respond.\r\n\r\nOn this same point: she knows how much store men put on their potency,\r\nhow vulnerable they can become if they are made to feel inadequate to\r\nthe needs of a wife. She would die a thousand deaths rather than have\r\nher husband gain any such inference from her actions. It’s her altruism\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHer eternal acquiescence, her ever-readiness, never lets her in for a\r\npainful sexual experience, however. She knows that ninety-nine times\r\nout of one hundred even negative sexual feelings in herself will soon\r\nturn to eagerness, and eagerness to desire. And even if that once in\r\na hundred times occurs, she will still get a profound satisfaction\r\nfrom the pleasure she is able to give her husband, the very obvious\r\npleasure. Once more that deep altruism.\r\n\r\nBut she not only takes the lead from him about _whether_ they are\r\ngoing to make love--the _kind_ of love they are going to make is also\r\nusually his decision and, in pure delight, she follows him completely.\r\nIf he feels purely lusty, soon she does too; does he feel gentle and\r\ntender, then she picks up that mood. Experimental? Let’s, by all means,\r\nexperiment. Passive? She’ll be active. It takes her little time to find\r\nout that a geisha has the tremendous disadvantage of believing that\r\ntechniques are more important than love and the love of following one’s\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nDespite her very pronounced wantonness with her husband, however, she\r\nhas no promiscuous urges whatsoever. She is realistic about other men\r\nand finds them attractive or unattractive, as the case may be. But she\r\nneither desires them nor has any fantasies of a sexual nature about\r\nthem. One woman put it this way to me: “I like other men if they’re\r\nattractive,” she said. “Their attractiveness does honor to the sex my\r\nhusband belongs to.”\r\n\r\nNor is she ever tempted to indulge in self-masturbation, at least not\r\nafter one or two tasteless and pointless experiments she may make\r\nduring her first absence from her husband. To her, sexuality is devoid\r\nof any meaning whatsoever if there is not mutuality, if it is not\r\nshared.\r\n\r\nLest you think that our paragon’s altruism could end up by making her a\r\nmartyr, a person without any real regard for herself, I must hasten to\r\nnip that idea in the bud. In her quiet way she is quite self-centered.\r\nIn the first place, she’s contented with all aspects of her body, all\r\nthe details of a female anatomy that gives her so much pleasure. If in\r\nher cultural background there were influences which tended to inculcate\r\ndisgust with certain natural functions, she finds herself rejecting\r\nthem. For example, I have had several patients who, during the course\r\nof their therapy and as they found a new maturity developing in them,\r\nfind themselves ruminating on the word “curse” as it is used to\r\ndescribe the menstrual flow. Reflection almost always makes them drop\r\nthe word from their vocabulary entirely. In the end they are far more\r\nlikely to call it a blessing.\r\n\r\nThis self-love, her pride in and love of her body, is reflected in\r\nher outward appearance. She likes to be as clean as a cat and as neat\r\nas a pin. She enjoys dressing well. She is very aware of the things\r\nthat bring out her special attractiveness. She also knows how to make\r\nherself up to the very best advantage. But she does not spend hours\r\ndaily on her toilet in front of the mirror. She is far too confident\r\nof herself, has too much self-love, to feel that such a production is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHere’s the way I’d put it. She accepts and is pleased with the way she\r\nis and the way, as time passes, she is going to be. This is true of her\r\nmental capacities as well as of her physical attributes, but we can see\r\nit most clearly in her attitude toward her physical self. As I said at\r\nthe beginning, we don’t know whether she has small breasts or large\r\nbreasts, rounded hips or narrow hips. We only know that, whatever she’s\r\ngot, she enjoys.\r\n\r\nYou see, she knows perfectly well that it is passion and response which\r\nspin the plot of love and not, ever, fetish or fashion. She really\r\nfeels sorry for women who worry about what they haven’t got or the\r\neffect of growing older. If she were small-breasted she would never\r\ndisguise that fact, and you can be certain that her husband, at least\r\nafter the relationship had got under way and he’d had a chance to\r\nexperience her pleasures, would soon drop any adolescent predilections\r\nhe had imagined he possessed.\r\n\r\nThe husband of one such woman said to me: “When I was in college I had\r\na conviction that really beautiful women had to be redheads. I can’t\r\nimagine now _what_ made me believe such a thing.” I know his wife well;\r\nshe’s a brunette, and you and I might not be the least bit impressed by\r\nher looks. But he knows better; he knows her real beauty. And, I happen\r\nto know, so does she.\r\n\r\nThe confidence and pleasure our fair lady has in her person and in her\r\nother attributes (her self-love) have one very odd quality. And it is\r\nan all-important one. This self-love is _detachable_.\r\n\r\nWith a flick of her psyche she can project practically all of it onto\r\nher children, take as much joy from their beauty, achievements, and\r\npleasures as she ever got from her own. She detaches it, too, on behalf\r\nof her husband, often will exaggerate his good qualities and minimize\r\nany weakness he might have, as long as the weakness is not a danger to\r\nfamily and home.\r\n\r\nHer detachable self-love and her need to give unrestrainedly are\r\ntwo chief components of the maternal instinct. To put it mildly, as\r\nperhaps you have noticed, she is pervaded with this instinct. To her\r\nthe fulfillment of it is the most central and all-important function\r\nof her life. It colors and deepens and enriches her sexual life with\r\nher husband. Her unconscious fantasy with every intercourse is that\r\nhe might make her with child, and her psychological and biological\r\ngratitude to him for this richest of all potential gifts is boundless.\r\nHer fantasies about becoming pregnant may excite her directly.\r\n\r\nI have paid particular attention to this connection between the sexual\r\ninstinct and the maternal instinct in many patients of mine who have\r\ncome to therapy because they were afraid of childbirth. When they have\r\nbeen able to rid themselves of such fears they are almost always struck\r\nby the new dimension that is added to their sexual life. The things\r\nthey say about it are often poetic or even mystical.\r\n\r\nOne woman, who because of childhood experiences had been scared\r\nto death of bearing a child and whose fear was causing a partial\r\nfrigidity, said to me of her new sexual experience: “I was living in\r\none room of a whole mansion, and now I have the whole mansion for my\r\nown.” Another woman, who had believed her love life complete despite\r\nher deep fear of pregnancy, said of the change in her feelings during\r\nlove-making: “Oh, it was fun before, but now the idea that I might\r\nbecome pregnant makes me feel at one with the whole universe. It’s\r\nstrange. There are almost no words to express it.”\r\n\r\nOur ideal woman carries this characteristic feeling of a deep\r\nidentification with nature, with all things that grow and bud and\r\nblossom, through her pregnancy and long thereafter. Childbirth had no\r\nreal terrors for her; she sails through it proudly, like a clipper made\r\nespecially for such weather.\r\n\r\nAnd she usually wants to nurse her child at her breast. She does, too,\r\nunless a breast abscess or some other unforeseen difficulty arises.\r\nAnd, though I have no statistics to prove it, I would bet that her milk\r\nis both plentiful and good.\r\n\r\nI know that today there is a tremendous emphasis on the importance\r\nof careers for women, but I am afraid that our mature woman cannot\r\nget terribly excited about the subject. I don’t mean that she’s\r\nantagonistic to this whole modern movement. She may be a career woman\r\nherself, a nurse, a doctor, a lawyer, a fashion designer, whatever. But\r\nnow, happily married and with children in the offing or already here,\r\nshe can’t feel that its of central importance. If it’s necessary for\r\nthe family welfare she will keep her job, but any drive she had after\r\nhigh school or college to go far in it is sacrificed, if necessary, to\r\nher love-making and homemaking instincts.\r\n\r\nShe is not the least bit jealous of her husband’s work. As I pointed\r\nout earlier, she may be smarter than her husband or may basically\r\nhave a much higher intelligence quotient, or she may be far more\r\nthoroughly educated than he is. Or she may be highly talented in some\r\nart form--writing, music, painting, sculpture. You will never, however,\r\nhear her complain that she gave up a career for her family, or angrily\r\nenvy the daily adventures of her man in the market place. Her joy and\r\nsatisfaction in the fulfillment of her own biological destiny make all\r\nother personal achievements pale for her, any other considerable use\r\nfor her energies almost a waste.\r\n\r\nAs she grows older and her family grows up and the children learn to\r\nstand on their own feet and use their own wings, she may return to\r\nwork. However, even then, interest in her now-grown children and their\r\nchildren will be far greater than any she can summon up for her job.\r\n\r\nAs you might expect, our paragon ages very gracefully. Those sure\r\ninstincts which led her to successful love in marriage and to success\r\nin rearing her children stand her in good stead now. She still loves\r\nto give, and she perceives the right time to give her children up,\r\nto let them stand on their own, learn the difficult uses of freedom.\r\nAdmittedly this is a great sacrifice for a mother, but she is deeply\r\npleased to make it. And in doing so without fuss or feathers, she wins\r\nher children’s regard and love forever.\r\n\r\nI am very pleased to say that the menopause brings no diminution in her\r\nability to enjoy her husband sexually. Contrary to what many people\r\nstill think, her orgasm does not decrease in intensity or in kind.\r\nIncreasing age and the absence of children in the home now bring her\r\nand her husband closer together again and, great companions, they\r\ndevelop a whole series of shared pleasures consistent with their years.\r\n\r\nAs she goes down into the other side of her middle years, she is not\r\ntroubled with regrets for things left undone. She has a deep sense\r\nof fulfillment, of life lived rightly. And, whether she has become\r\nconsciously religious or not, she is still, basically, a believer in\r\nimmortality, for she has served it with her whole being. She looks on\r\ndeath totally unafraid, wondering perhaps what the Creator who has made\r\nher life such a marvel is like on an even closer view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the idealized picture of the truly feminine woman. While\r\ngranting that the plane of maturity she has achieved is rather too\r\nexalted for most women to attain, I have given her to you for some very\r\nconcrete reasons.\r\n\r\nWith merely this ideal to follow, I have seen many women reap immediate\r\nrewards some time before they were able to come to grips with their\r\nfrigidity per se. The characteristics and neurotic goals that accompany\r\nfrigidity often cause obvious domestic frictions that can be greatly\r\nreduced when the woman begins to see new horizons for herself--that\r\nshe need not be blaming others. Her grateful husband will reward her\r\nat once for her change, with renewed affection and tenderness, a new\r\nsolicitude, a new caring.\r\n\r\nOur idealized portrait can help you, too, to grasp more thoroughly the\r\nrest of this book. We have found, in psychiatry, that when a goal has\r\nbeen clearly defined half the battle has been won. As we come now to\r\nthe chapters on frigidity, its history, its whys and wherefores, kinds\r\nand causes and cures, you will have before you a picture of what the\r\npotentialities of women are, a landmark to show you how far our sex can\r\nstray from real femininity, a guide to keep you from confusion, from\r\never subscribing again to false and destructive ideas of what it is\r\nthat constitutes real womanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II\r\n\r\n                     _The Psychology of Frigidity_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Chapter 4_\r\n\r\n                          WHAT IS FRIGIDITY?\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen the real potential of woman, how she can flower\r\nand blossom in the climate of love, what she can be like when she\r\nembraces her true destiny, we may turn to an examination of frigidity\r\nwith some perspective. This section will deal with what frigidity is,\r\nspecifically, and why it can and does occur in women, blighting their\r\ncapacities, stunting their personality, chilling and killing their\r\nability to love at the heart’s deep core. When a woman gets a clear\r\npicture of such matters, and _only_ when she does, can she find her way\r\nback to the highroad of real womanhood.\r\n\r\nIf we take the word “frigidity” in its most general sense it means, as\r\nI have already stated, an inability to enjoy sexual love to its fullest\r\npotentiality. This means, purely and simply, the inability to have\r\nan orgasm of the type described in Chapter 2. But the matter is more\r\ncomplicated than that, for there are degrees of frigidity, and I think\r\nit is very important to understand what this means.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I can make this idea clearest by first describing the symptoms\r\nof a woman who came to see me several months ago. She was an example of\r\ntotal sexual frigidity.\r\n\r\nIn our first interview she described herself as having absolutely no\r\nsexual reactions whatsoever. She did not respond to her husband’s\r\ncaresses in any way at all. Neither her clitoris, vagina, nor labia was\r\ncapable of the slightest sexual response. She received no stimulation\r\nfrom kissing or physical closeness. Her breasts and all secondary\r\nerotic regions were, from the standpoint of sensual response, dead. Her\r\nvaginal passage never became lubricated before or during intercourse.\r\nThe act of love was very painful for her. An examination by a competent\r\ngynecologist showed no physical condition which would explain her pain.\r\nHer external genitalia were all fully developed. Her reproductive\r\norgans--the vaginal tract, cervix, uterus, tubes, and ovaries--also\r\nwere normally developed and showed no pathology.\r\n\r\nThis woman’s sexual unresponsiveness was entirely psychological, and on\r\na scale showing the degrees of frigidity she would represent absolute\r\nzero. (This is no longer true of her, incidentally; she has made\r\nprogress in therapy in a relatively short time, considering the extent\r\nof her difficulty, and her final prognosis promises to be excellent.)\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of this frigidity scale is the woman who trembles\r\non the verge of sexual maturity but cannot quite step over the line.\r\nIn the act of love she has all the responses which I have described\r\nas taking place in normal sexual intercourse, but she cannot come to\r\norgasm, or at least orgasm happens quite rarely--say once in ten or\r\ntwenty times--and it is generally a mild and unsatisfactory one. You\r\nwill be interested to know that her sexual problem is a relatively\r\neasy one to resolve. This is the kind of frigidity that may disappear\r\nentirely after the birth of a child. I have seen it dispelled, too,\r\nby a single conversation with a wise counselor or with just time and\r\na minimum of insightful understanding which she can obtain by taking\r\nthought or learning more about the nature of her problem and dispelling\r\ncertain misunderstandings she has had about the nature of sex,\r\nmarriage, men, and love.\r\n\r\nIn between these two types there are all degrees of sexual frigidity.\r\nThe severity of a woman’s problem, or the lack of it, can be calculated\r\nin terms of the degree of response she has to her husband’s caresses\r\nand the frequency with which she achieves satisfaction in intercourse.\r\nAlso important in estimating the degree of the problem is the orgasm\r\nitself. This is purely a subjective matter and can of course be judged\r\nonly by the individual. If the orgasm is weak and chronically leaves\r\none with a dissatisfied feeling, a certain degree of frigidity is\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _degrees_ of frigidity there is a _type_ of\r\nfrigidity that it is very important to understand. We call a woman\r\nsuffering from this form of frigidity a “clitoridal” or “masculine”\r\ntype. To make her problem clear to you I shall have to describe her\r\ntypical sexual reaction.\r\n\r\nThis woman’s responses to sexual stimulation are usually quite\r\npassionate. In the foreplay preceding sexual intercourse and even in\r\nthe first part of intercourse her reactions parallel the normal to a\r\ngreater or lesser extent. This type of woman, however, can always be\r\nidentified by the kind of orgasm she has.\r\n\r\nThis orgasm takes place on her clitoris exclusively. She does not\r\nfeel the orgasm in her vagina, nor do the sexual sensations spread\r\nvery strongly to the other parts of her body. The sensual experience\r\nis primarily localized at climax, and though, owing to her lack of\r\nexperience with the mature form of orgasm, she may defend her orgasm as\r\nperfectly normal and adequate, it is not. Therapy has helped many women\r\nwith this constricted reaction to sexual intercourse and, once they\r\nhave experienced the profound pleasure of the true orgasm, they will\r\nadmit quite freely their former deprivation.\r\n\r\nThe clitoridal woman seeks to obtain her typical orgasm in two ways. In\r\nintercourse she will sometimes strive to bring her clitoris into direct\r\ncontact with the penis, thus obtaining the stimulation necessary for\r\nher to achieve climax. Most women, however, are not able to gratify\r\nthemselves in this way. Intercourse seems to deaden their sexual\r\nfeelings, even their clitoral feelings. It is as though the male penis\r\nin the vagina represented a dangerous and hostile presence. Such women\r\nare only able to come to their clitoridal climax either by masturbating\r\nthemselves or having their husbands do so before or after intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe clitoridal woman--that is, the woman who experiences orgasm on her\r\nclitoris alone--is very definitely suffering from a form of frigidity.\r\nIndeed this form of frigidity is extremely widespread, and we will\r\ndevote much space to it later, tracing the origin of the difficulty and\r\nthe indications for treatment.\r\n\r\nSince we have a name for the clitoridal type of sexual frigidity, let\r\nus, for the sake of clarity, also give a name to the form of frigidity\r\nfirst described, that which is characterized by a subnormal degree of\r\nsensation in the entire genital area and weak and infrequent orgasm.\r\nThis form of frigidity is called sexual anesthesia in textbooks, and I\r\nwill use that phrase here when I refer to it. The word “anesthesia,” as\r\nyou probably know, simply means the absence, or relative absence, of\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nNow that we have named names I should like to say that I wish the\r\nproblem of frigidity were as uncomplicated as this description makes\r\nit sound. If it were we’d simply have the problem of a large number\r\nof women who weren’t getting all the pleasure out of life that is\r\npossible. But there is far more to it than that.\r\n\r\nThe sad fact is that frigidity usually has a profound psychological\r\nrepercussion on the individual. Her inadequacy is rooted in her\r\nchildhood or adolescence, in early fears and misunderstandings, in\r\nevents largely forgotten now. Around these early experiences, as\r\ncrystals around a string, have clustered a whole series of personality\r\ntraits that make life very hard for her and, much too often, unbearable\r\nfor those nearest and dearest to her--her husband and her children.\r\n\r\nTo put it most directly, frigidity is generally a product of neurosis.\r\nAnd, most importantly, the frigid woman’s neurotic behavior is in\r\ndirect proportion to the degree of her frigidity. I have found it to be\r\ntrue that, the more frigid a woman is, the more neurotic her behavior\r\nbecomes, the more inimical to her own good and to the good of her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIt is these psychological repercussions that make the problem of\r\nfrigidity a serious one for the individual and society. The frigid\r\nwoman’s often grossly neurotic psychological traits are raising havoc\r\nwith our marital institution in the form of unhappiness, divorce, and\r\nmaladjustment in her children.\r\n\r\nWomen will usually face the fact that they are sexually frigid;\r\ngenerally they have to; the knowledge is forced upon them. But they\r\nwill rarely face the fact that they have personality difficulties that\r\nare directly related to their obvious sexual difficulty.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an illustration.\r\n\r\nLast year a very intelligent woman came to see me. She was an associate\r\nprofessor of history at a leading university and, according to her,\r\nher only complaint was that she could not have an orgasm during\r\nintercourse. She was unusually frank in describing the sexual aspect\r\nof her problem in her first interview, and when she had finished the\r\ndescription of her reactions and lack of them she had described a\r\nwoman with a rather severe sexual anesthesia. She had neither clitoral\r\nnor vaginal sensation and could claim only some vaguely pleasant\r\nsensations on her labia. She had nothing approximating an orgasm.\r\n\r\nActually she was a very fine woman, but she was totally confused about\r\nthis area of her life. “If I could only break through this silly little\r\nblock,” she told me, “our marriage would be ideal.” I could get no\r\nfurther real facts from her. She insisted that she and her husband had\r\n“a whole community of shared interests” and two “wonderfully normal”\r\nchildren. I asked to see her husband.\r\n\r\nI got the real story from him. He was, he told me, quite worried about\r\nhis wife and about their marriage and had been for a long time.\r\n\r\nShe had always, he said, been an extremely competitive woman, but since\r\nhis promotion from associate professor to full professor four years\r\nbefore, this characteristic had become almost unendurable. “I hardly\r\ndare to open my mouth any more,” he told me, “because I know she’s\r\ngoing to contradict me.” Quarrels had become extremely frequent, and\r\ntheir oldest child was definitely showing neurotic signs. I inquired\r\nabout her reactions during her pregnancies, and he told me that she\r\nhad been constantly ill physically and, while she would not admit it,\r\nhad clearly been deeply frightened of the whole experience. Indeed,\r\nafter the birth of the second child she had become severely depressed\r\nfor over two months. He told me that yes, indeed, they had _had_ a\r\ncommunity of interests for the first couple of years of their marriage\r\nbut that her competitiveness with him had become so pronounced that any\r\nmutuality, from his standpoint, was now almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAny psychiatrist knowledgeable in such matters could have guessed\r\nfrom the woman’s description of her sexual problem pretty much what I\r\nlearned about her from her husband. For, as I have pointed out, the\r\nkind and degree of frigidity a woman may confess to are also an open\r\nstatement of the kind and degree of personality distortion she is\r\nsubject to.\r\n\r\nAs one might guess, this patient was not easy to treat. She had\r\ndeveloped a powerful tendency to handle her fears by denying their\r\nexistence. When she was finally able to see through this self-deceiving\r\ntrait, however, she came to grips with her problem. She was able to\r\nsee that she had been in a ten-year competition with her husband\r\ninstead of a marriage. When she realized this she was able to control\r\nher competitive actions, and the immediate rewards she received in\r\nthe form of renewed affection and companionship from her grateful\r\nhusband motivated her to find out more and more about herself. At\r\nlength this intelligent but dreadfully insecure person became, through\r\nunderstanding and insight, a real woman able to give and take in every\r\naspect of the love relationship.\r\n\r\nFrigidity causes a personality distortion. I wish to impress this on\r\nyou deeply. It means that the person has a misunderstanding of reality,\r\ndenies it, blames others for her own miseries and failures.\r\n\r\nOne woman who had been cured of a severe frigidity problem phrased\r\nit this way: “I was looking at life and people through a distorting\r\nglass. No wonder I made such poor decisions.” She was right, too. Her\r\nproblem had first driven her to promiscuity, then to marriage with an\r\nalcoholic. I was very glad, when she first came for treatment, that she\r\nhad not yet had any children. With her deeply seated, sexually based\r\npersonality problem she might have ruined them. I am even gladder that,\r\nremarried to a fine man, she has two children now.\r\n\r\nIn a later section we shall examine in great detail these personality\r\nproblems that accompany frigidity. There are, however, more immediate\r\nsymptoms which I should like to go into here.\r\n\r\nYou will recall in the description of sexual intercourse leading to\r\norgasm how thoroughly the body becomes mobilized: heartbeat, pulse, and\r\nblood pressure rise precipitately, tissues become engorged with blood,\r\nglands secrete freely, muscular tension mounts to a pitch which would\r\nbe unendurable if the sexual instinct were not demanding expression.\r\nComplete satisfaction brings an end to all these processes, and the\r\nenergy discharged through normal channels and in a normal manner leaves\r\nthe person in a condition of relaxation and with a sense of well-being.\r\n\r\nWhen orgasm does _not_ take place, when there is no release of the\r\nintensely mobilized energy, there are immediate repercussions, both\r\nphysical and psychological, on the individual.\r\n\r\nPsychologically the woman who has been brought to such a pitch\r\nexperiences a feeling of acute frustration which, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, turns to anger at herself and at her partner. If the\r\nanger is unconscious, she may have physiological symptoms--headache,\r\nnausea, throat constrictions, heart palpitations, or difficulty with\r\nbreathing. She may also weep uncontrollably, vomit, or have tremors\r\nthroughout her body.\r\n\r\nThis unconscious anger at her frustration may also cause her to quarrel\r\nwith her husband or to take out her rage on the children.\r\n\r\nI should like to emphasize that she usually does not see any connection\r\nbetween these symptoms and her frustrated sexual experiences. When her\r\nanger at her frustration does become conscious, she usually blames her\r\nhusband for her lack of satisfaction. As I have pointed out, he is\r\nrarely to blame.\r\n\r\nPurely physical symptoms not connected with repressed anger may also\r\nfollow upon sexual excitement which has not been released through\r\norgasm. These are somatic and can probably be traced to undischarged\r\nneuromuscular and glandular energy. Such symptoms include low back\r\npain, general restlessness, and very often acute insomnia. Several of\r\nmy patients have complained of severe vaginal pains which have lasted\r\nseveral hours. Gynecologists report that abdominal cramps, probably\r\nemanating from contractions of the uterus, are frequent.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from this recital of symptoms and my preliminary\r\ndescriptions of personality disorders, women may pay a very high price\r\nfor their frigidity. If the condition were relatively rare, we could\r\ntake some comfort from _that_ fact at least.\r\n\r\nBut frigidity is not rare; it is one of the commonest and most serious\r\nchronic ailments that beset society today. Conservative estimates\r\nindicate that 40 per cent of all American women suffer from some degree\r\nor kind of sexual frigidity. No other public health or social problem\r\nof our time even approaches this magnitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now told you about the degrees and psychological consequences of\r\nfrigidity and described one basic type. There are, however, two other\r\ntypes of frigidity which, because they have certain confusing elements\r\nin them, I have reserved until now to explain. Psychologically and\r\nsexually both of these types seem to run counter to the generalities I\r\nhave made about frigidity so far.\r\n\r\nThe first type, though we consider her definitely frigid in the wide\r\nsense of the word, is able to have full and complete orgasm practically\r\nevery time she has intercourse. This is really quite an astonishing\r\nfact, considering the usual close connection between personality and\r\nsexuality. Actually one could not distinguish in any way the sexual\r\nreaction of this type from that of the perfectly normal woman described\r\nin Chapter 3.\r\n\r\nHowever, this kind of woman is totally unable to build a relationship\r\nwith any man. For that reason she generally becomes, in the end,\r\nsexually promiscuous. Somehow and somewhere along the line a wedge\r\nhas been driven between her sexuality and her ability to relate\r\npsychologically in a love relationship. Her sexuality has come to\r\napparent maturity while her character has remained infantile. We call\r\nthis psychic frigidity.\r\n\r\nThis type of woman is not, however, to be confused with the nymphomanic\r\nwoman, who, in my experience, is generally seriously mentally disturbed\r\nand for that reason is not included in this book. The woman with\r\npsychic frigidity usually has sexual affairs with one man at a time;\r\nher neurosis is usually based on sexual seduction in early childhood.\r\n\r\nThe second type is nearly the exact opposite of the psychic type of\r\nfrigidity. I call her the all-mother type. She is a distinct anomaly.\r\nIn the first place, she is definitely classifiable as sexually frigid;\r\nthe degree of her erotic reaction is zero. She is totally anesthetic\r\nsexually.\r\n\r\nPsychologically speaking, however, she exhibits almost the perfect\r\npicture of normalcy. She is happily married, is a very giving and\r\naltruistic person, and is totally loyal and devoted to her husband. She\r\nis, above all, a wonderful mother, willing and able to give the very\r\nbest of herself to her children. Her husband is generally happy with\r\nhis marriage. We suspect, although there is not sufficient data on this\r\nto say it with certainty, that the mate of the all-mother type has a\r\nrather low-pitched sexual nature and also a rather low storehouse of\r\nnormal male vanity, albeit he is a good provider and a steady type. It\r\nis probable that the woman divined his characteristics unconsciously\r\nwhen she first fell in love with him.\r\n\r\nThere is generally little reason why the all-mother type of woman\r\nshould seek to change herself in any way. I must emphasize the fact\r\nagain and again that the reason frigidity presents a problem that\r\nmust be solved is that it has harmful repercussions on the woman\r\nand on those close to her. It causes acute misery to her, causes\r\npersonality damage to the children, and tends to destroy her marriage.\r\nThe all-mother type of frigidity does none of these things, and I see\r\nno reason, if the woman doesn’t, why she must contemplate changing\r\nherself. However, the matter can be a subtle one, for this type of\r\nwoman can, without any awareness of the fact, tend to be overprotective\r\nof her children or tend to have a hard time letting them go from the\r\nnest when that period in their growth has arrived. She should be most\r\ncareful, weigh this matter thoroughly, before she decides in any final\r\nsense whether her problem may or may not be having untoward effects of\r\na concealed nature.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the basic facts about the nature of frigidity.\r\nLet us now consider their implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 5_\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one contrasts the normal woman with the frigid woman, certain\r\nquestions come to mind at once. Why, for example, _do_ certain women\r\nbecome frigid? Have millions of women always been this way, or is it a\r\nproblem of our times only? Why, if _not_ being frigid is so pleasant,\r\ndo some women hold onto this problem though they know they can get help\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions in part or in whole, you will first have to\r\nknow a little history. For, though every case of frigidity represents\r\na psychological problem in the individual, we have found that,\r\nsociologically speaking, frigidity is rooted in certain destructive\r\nevents that have occurred to woman in the past two hundred years. If\r\nyou grasp them you will begin to get a picture of the over-all problem\r\nthat has beset woman, of how she lost her direction, her sense of self,\r\nand what she must do to find them again.\r\n\r\nThe history I am going to tell you about is the history of a war, a\r\nbitter and destructive war. It is often called “The War between Men and\r\nWomen.” For far too many women and men too--it is still going on.\r\n\r\nIt began toward the end of the eighteenth century, and the apparently\r\ninnocent event that started it all was the invention of the steam\r\nengine by Watt--the great invention that ushered in the modern age. It\r\nseems hard to believe now that this almost outdated means of creating\r\npower could have been so important, but it was. It launched the\r\nso-called Industrial Revolution, which was to change the whole fabric\r\nof society, our ways of doing things and making things, our living\r\nquarters and our living standards, our morals, religion, art; name it\r\nand you will find that the Industrial Revolution has turned it upside\r\ndown and inside out.\r\n\r\nMost of all, and most tragically, it changed the home. It would be more\r\naccurate, if somewhat bleaker, to say that it destroyed the home, at\r\nleast as home was known up to that time.\r\n\r\nBut let me tell you what home was like before the Industrial\r\nRevolution, for when you see that you will begin to discern the\r\noutlines of the great tragedy that happened to woman when the\r\nold-fashioned family home ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nIn that era our society was almost entirely rural and agricultural.\r\nIn other words, most homes were farms. There were cities and some\r\nindustry, of course, but where industries existed they were almost\r\nentirely home industries run by individual families.\r\n\r\nHome, then, was, almost without exception, the center of all life,\r\neconomic, social, and educational. Everything was produced at home;\r\nall food was grown; suits and dresses and underclothing were made from\r\ncloth woven on the premises. There were simply no stores in which to\r\nbuy anything. The leather for shoes was taken from the hides of animals\r\none had reared oneself, and the shoes were made at home, the leather\r\ntanned, the shoes fashioned. A man made his own tools, was his own\r\nblacksmith, carpenter, architect. He built his own house, too, and kept\r\nit in repair.\r\n\r\nWoman’s place in this early family home was indisputably at the very\r\ncenter, an equal partner with her husband in all the manifold duties,\r\nresponsibilities, joys, hopes, and fears of the entire household. Her\r\nwork was heavy and constant; she cooked the food her husband had grown,\r\nwove the cloth, fashioned and made the clothes for the entire family.\r\nShe cleaned and she swept, washed, and ironed from morning till night.\r\n\r\nChildren, as soon as they were old enough, lightened her labors. She\r\nwas responsible for their education (public schools had never been\r\nheard of), which was not just a matter of teaching them the three R’s\r\nbut of inculcating in them all that she knew of the multitude of arts,\r\ncrafts, and techniques it took to run such a home.\r\n\r\nHer reward for all this was the fact that she was needed, loved, held\r\nin the highest esteem by her husband and her whole family. If she\r\nfailed in her duties or if she died, it would be not merely a sad or\r\ninconvenient event for the family. It would be a disaster, for the\r\nactivities of the distaff side, although different from those of the\r\nmale, were of equal importance.\r\n\r\nThere were of course no social scientists to ask her probing questions\r\nabout her sex life, and we can only know about her indirectly and by\r\npiecing odd patches of information together wherever we may find them.\r\nFrom what we can gather, even the concept of frigidity in marriage\r\nwas unknown to her; love, home, work were a unified and profoundly\r\nsatisfying experience on all levels. As a woman she was profoundly\r\nneeded, and as a woman reared to respond to this need she had no single\r\noccasion to question her worth or her abilities.\r\n\r\nAnd then one by one, slowly but surely, her responsibilities and her\r\nduties were removed from her; her close and equal working relationship\r\nwith her husband was destroyed; her importance to her children was\r\ndiminished sadly.\r\n\r\nThe new machines made possible by Watt’s harnessing of steam power\r\nbegan to take over, to displace all those things that had been done\r\nby hand. Transportation, via the new Iron Horse, developed, and trade\r\nbetween sections that were once remote from one another was made\r\npossible. A man could make more money than he had ever dreamed of if he\r\ncould supply a need of some group or community.\r\n\r\nAnd so industry in the sense that we know it today started with a rush.\r\nThe principle of steam power was applied to the manufacture of goods\r\nwith tremendous success. Factories sprang up, and they needed men to\r\nrun them. Now husbands who but recently had worked at home, hand in\r\nhand and side by side with their wives, labored outside the home,\r\ndeveloped lives that were independent to some extent of the home’s\r\nactivities and concerns.\r\n\r\nThe supply of manufactured goods from the factories began to render the\r\nhomemaking skills and handicrafts of women unnecessary. As time wore\r\non and new ideas developed to meet the new conditions created by the\r\nmachine, the education of the children passed from the home to a new\r\ninstitution, the public school.\r\n\r\nIt happened slowly, very slowly, over generations, in fact, and the\r\nfull results of the Industrial Revolution were not felt until this\r\ncentury. At first, so gradual was the process that only a few women,\r\nscattered here and there, felt the impact of the change. But as time\r\npassed and the process extended, more and more families were drawn into\r\nthe vortex of industrialization, and at length it had changed the lives\r\nof every individual in the land.\r\n\r\nVery slowly, too, but everywhere, women woke as if from a centuries-old\r\ndream of peace and happiness to find themselves dispossessed. Gone\r\nwas their central place in the family home, gone their economic\r\nimportance, gone their close working partnership with their mate, their\r\nfunctions of teacher and moral guide to the children. The child himself\r\nwas gone, to school, as the husband had gone to the mill or factory.\r\n\r\nYes, she was dispossessed, dispossessed of all those things that for\r\ncenturies had defined her womanhood for her, that had supported her\r\nego, given her the certain knowledge that being a woman, however hard,\r\nwas a wondrous and most desirable thing. She felt her womanhood itself\r\ndevalued, the things it represented unwanted.\r\n\r\nAnd then she reacted. She reacted violently and with rage at this\r\ndepreciation of her feminine attributes, of her skills, of her\r\nfunctions. Unhappily this reaction was precisely the wrong one, the one\r\nfrom which no solution of a happy kind for her could be attained.\r\n\r\nHere’s what she did. Looking about, she thought she spied a villain\r\nin the piece. Who was it? None other than her partner through the\r\ncenturies, man. It was he who had deserted her, who was responsible\r\nfor her loss of self-respect as a woman, a mother, an equal socially\r\nand mentally and morally. He despised women. Very well, she would show\r\nhim. She would simply stop being a woman. She would enter the lists\r\nand compete with him on his own level. To hell with being a woman. She\r\nwould be a man.\r\n\r\nYou don’t believe it? It seems too farfetched? Woman as a sex would\r\nnever have made such a decision?\r\n\r\nWell, let’s look a little more closely at some of the facts.\r\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned the feminist movement. Now it is time to look at\r\nit in more detail. It was launched by Mary Wollstonecraft in 1792,\r\nless than thirty years after the invention of the steam engine that\r\nushered in the Industrial Revolution, and it’s power and influence were\r\nand still are enormous. It has been the self-appointed spokesman for\r\nwomankind for over one hundred fifty years, and its program of reforms\r\nhas been almost entirely realized in every detail.\r\n\r\nWhat did this movement want to achieve? Let me quote to you what\r\ntwo profound students of feminism, Ferdinand Lundberg and Marynia\r\nF. Farnham, had to say about it in their book _Modern Women, The\r\nLost Sex_: “Far from being a movement,” they wrote, “for the greater\r\nself-realization of women, as it professed to be, feminism was the\r\nvery negation of femaleness. Although hostile to men and hostile to\r\nchildren, it was at bottom most hostile to women. It bade women commit\r\nsuicide as women and attempt to live as men … Psychologically,\r\nfeminism had a single objective: the achievement of maleness by the\r\nfemale, or the nearest possible approach to it. In so far as it was\r\nattained, it spelled only vast individual suffering for men as well as\r\nwomen, and much public disorder.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the program of the feminists? Actually Mary Wollstonecraft\r\nhad enunciated it in its entirety in her book, _A Vindication of the\r\nRights of Women_, and the movement never deviated from her original\r\ndemands. She had stated that men and women were, in all fundamental\r\ncharacteristics, identical, and that therefore women should receive the\r\nsame education as men, be governed by the same moral standards, do the\r\nsame work, and have identical political rights and duties. Women were\r\nto be treated exactly as men in every detail of living, and the same\r\ndemands were to be made on them.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of this program was enormous. Nineteenth-century woman\r\nfelt: “Ah, if we could only achieve _this_, then we would be happy\r\nonce again.” The fact--and it’s a dreadfully simple one--is that now,\r\nindeed, the entire program has been realized and modern woman, having\r\nreaped the benefits of it in full, is more confused, perhaps even\r\nunhappier, than ever.\r\n\r\nPlease do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that woman’s lot was\r\nnot difficult, often impossible, in the nineteenth century. Nor am\r\nI saying that all of the goals set by the feminists were neurotic\r\nand wrong-headed. The movement indeed helped to overcome some of\r\nthe gravest dislocations in social and economic life caused by the\r\nupheavals that followed in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\nI _am_ saying this: that in so far as the feminist movement pitted\r\nitself against the male, and at the same time advised woman to\r\nmasculinize herself or divest herself of her feminine nature, it was\r\ndreadfully neurotic, and we have been reaping the whirlwind this\r\nmovement started ever since.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the feminist was directed against herself.\r\n\r\nWe know, for example, that to fulfill herself biologically--that is, to\r\ngive birth to children--a woman must have security, the protection of\r\nthe male, a permanent abode. Marriage has been society’s answer to this\r\nfeminine need from time immemorial. But the feminists pitted themselves\r\nagainst the institution of marriage. Woman, they held, had the right,\r\neven as men did, to be promiscuous sexually, to live with whom she\r\npleased, for as long or as short a time as she pleased. If she wished\r\nto get married she should be able to do so, but she should also have\r\nthe privilege of terminating this marriage when she wished to, when she\r\ntired of it.\r\n\r\nWe know, too, that maternal love for children, particularly love of\r\nher own children, is one of the major traits of womankind, as typical\r\nof her as her female anatomy. We know that only the very sickest\r\nwomen, mentally, will desert or neglect their children. Maternality\r\nis so deeply rooted in the biology of the female sex that its fierce\r\nprotectiveness can be observed in many animals.\r\n\r\nMaternality is a trap, said the feminists in effect, a bill of goods\r\nsold to women by men in order to keep them enslaved. Children should\r\nnot be allowed in any way to interfere with the new freedom of women.\r\nWork, advised the feminists, right up to the last day of pregnancy.\r\nThen, mothers, get back to work as soon as possible. Put your child in\r\nthe hands of some trained child handler or handlers. Public nurseries\r\nwere advocated, pre-kindergarten groups were advocated; anything that\r\n“freed” the mother was advocated.\r\n\r\nFreed the mother for what? you may well ask. To work in offices and\r\nfactories as the men did, of course. To substitute boss for husband, to\r\nshare the “privilege” of being hired or fired; to be, in short, men.\r\n\r\nIf space allowed I could continue with a long and circumstantial list\r\nof masculine goals which the feminists advocated. And I could give an\r\nequally long list of goals which ignored or denied the existence of\r\nfeminine characteristics in womankind. Very few of the early feminists\r\nactually lived in the manner they prescribed. But it was as clear as\r\ncrystal that they ardently desired to.\r\n\r\nBut here is the important thing to remember: The feminist credo\r\nthoroughly discredited truly feminine needs and characteristics\r\nand substituted male goals for female goals. There weren’t so many\r\nfeminists in actual numbers, but those there were, were incredibly\r\nvocal, and in the end their ideals and beliefs became the ideals and\r\nbeliefs of millions of women.\r\n\r\nBut the feminist front was not the only front in this war between\r\nmen and women; it was only the loudest and most militant. Unnoted,\r\nhidden, unknown even to the women themselves, the war against feminine\r\nsexuality, against the flowering of true womanhood, was being waged\r\nin every home in the land. The chaste and prim-lipped heroine of this\r\nfront was Victorian woman, whom we already have had a look at. Let’s\r\ntake another quick one.\r\n\r\nHer reaction to the loss of her position in the highly creative family\r\nhome which had preceded the Industrial Revolution was just as violent\r\nas that of the feminist. But it was thoroughly unconscious. She had\r\nbeen rejected, her place taken from her, her sexual and maternal\r\nfunctions devalued. Very well. She had a perfectly good technique for\r\ndealing with the situation.\r\n\r\nShe simply denied the very existence of female sexuality. Sex,\r\naccording to her, was exclusively a male characteristic; woman had none\r\nof it in her nature. Although this was a form of psychological revenge\r\non the “rejecting” male, she was amazingly successful in convincing men\r\nin general, even the scientists of the day, that frigidity was indeed a\r\nbasic attribute of the female.\r\n\r\nVictorian woman was, of course, unconscious of her motives in affirming\r\nthat she was biologically frigid. She entirely believed it herself,\r\nand there is much evidence to indicate that the individual woman was\r\ngenerally deeply shocked if she discovered she was not as unresponsive\r\nas she had been taught she was or wished to be. She kept any such\r\nreactions a very dark secret indeed.\r\n\r\nFrigidity as an article of female faith died with the Victorian\r\nwoman--a happy and mercifully early death during World War I. But the\r\ninfluence of Victorianism is still very much with us in our unconscious\r\nattitude toward sex and love.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the heritage of woman today: On the one hand, from\r\nVictorian woman, a profound belief that she is and should be\r\nnon-sexual, frigid, by natural law. On the other hand, from the\r\nfeminists, that man is woman’s natural enemy, that she should drop her\r\nfemininity altogether, oppose man, supersede him, become him.\r\n\r\nPlease stop for a moment now to think what effect either of these two\r\nattitudes must have had on the marital life of a woman who held one\r\nof them. Her hostility to her husband and all the misery such hatred\r\nimplies, we take for granted. But it was the effect on the children\r\nthat was decisive.\r\n\r\nI have treated, as I have told you, several women who had been raised\r\nby Victorian or feminist mothers. The attitudes inculcated into these\r\npatients in their childhood would make one’s hair stand on end. Or\r\nit should. This is what they learned at their mother’s knee: Shame\r\nabout their bodies; shame about menstruation, and disgust with it,\r\nhatred of it, for it is a hallmark of womanhood; fear of pregnancy\r\nand childbirth; punishment for early and natural sexual feelings and\r\nexperimentation; destruction and depreciation of the father as an ideal\r\nimage for the child to love or to emulate. In general, women learned\r\nearly and well to loathe their womanhood in all of its important\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\nCan you begin to see why most psychiatrists passionately agree with\r\nDr. Marynia Farnham when she writes: “The most precise expression of\r\nunhappiness is neurosis. The bases for most of this unhappiness … are\r\nlaid in the childhood home. The principal instrument of their creation\r\nare women”.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps have noticed that I have coupled our feminist with\r\nour Victorian woman, and you may object that they really shouldn’t be\r\nspoken of in the same breath. The feminists were, after all, for more\r\nand more sexual freedom; Victorian woman was anti-sexual. I feel that\r\nthat is only superficially true. They were both, in their unconscious\r\nlives, against feminine sexuality. It is not possible for woman to\r\nbe masculine sexually; to advocate that for her is exactly equal to\r\ndemanding that she be frigid.\r\n\r\nOf course feminism, as a conscious attitude toward sexuality,\r\nultimately triumphed over Victorianism. Sexual freedom and all the\r\nother equal rights with men demanded for women by the feminists after\r\nWorld War I became the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThe flapper of the 1920’s represented the unintended flower of the\r\nfeminist philosophy of life, its definition of what constituted\r\nwomanhood. As we know, the flapper was a caricature of woman, a cheap\r\nand shoddy imitation of the opposite sex, a second-class man. Happily,\r\nshe did not survive as a conscious national ideal, but the philosophy\r\nthat created her _did_ survive. The depreciation of the goals of\r\nfemininity, biological and psychological, became part and parcel of\r\nthe education of millions of American girls. Homemaking, childbearing\r\nand rearing, cooking, the virtues of patience, lovingness, givingness\r\nin marriage have been systematically devalued. The life of male\r\nachievement has been substituted for the life of female achievement.\r\n\r\nThe feminist-Victorian antagonism toward men has survived too. It\r\nhas been handed down from mother to daughter in an unbroken line for\r\nso many years now that, to millions of women, hostility toward the\r\nopposite sex seems almost a natural law. Though many a modern woman may\r\npay lip service to the ideal of a passionate and productive marriage to\r\na man, underneath she deeply resents her role, conceives of the male as\r\nfundamentally hostile to her, as an exploiter of her. She wishes in her\r\ndeepest heart, and often without the slightest awareness of the fact,\r\nto supplant him, to exchange roles with him. She learned this attitude\r\nat her mother’s knee or imbibed it with her formula. Little that she\r\nlearns elsewhere counteracts it with any great effectiveness.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, if this is the historical direction women have taken,\r\nthe individual woman who wishes to become a real woman must change\r\nthis direction. This she can do only by taking thought, long thought.\r\nFor among the women around her she will not necessarily find too much\r\nsupport for her wish to be entirely feminine.\r\n\r\nFor one hundred fifty years now women have blamed their problems on the\r\noutside world. They have used the very real difficulties created by\r\nrevolutionary social changes to avoid the task of looking within for\r\nthe real problem and the real solution. They have indulged in an orgy\r\nof finger-pointing and self-pity.\r\n\r\nIf the results had been different; if this attitude had brought them\r\nhappiness and fulfillment, if feminism and Victorianism had made\r\nthem good mothers and joyful wives, or even pleased them with their\r\nnew place in industry, the game might have been worth the candle.\r\nBut it hasn’t been. The game has brought frigidity and restlessness\r\nand a soaring divorce rate, neurosis, homosexuality, juvenile\r\ndelinquency--all that results when the woman in _any_ society deserts\r\nher true function.\r\n\r\nLast year a woman came to see me at the request of a lawyer she had\r\nconsulted. She was on the verge of divorce, she told me. And then, her\r\nface distorted with rage, she said of her husband: “He will have to\r\ncome crawling to me on his hands and knees before I will even think of\r\nforgiving him.”\r\n\r\nI questioned her and soon elicited the fact that she had been totally\r\nfrigid from the first time she had had intercourse with her husband.\r\nYet consciously she felt blameless in the difficulties that had arisen,\r\nself-righteous, indignant that her husband should find her anything\r\nbut eminently desirable after five years of joyless love-making. With\r\nsuch an attitude, of course, she could never have made the slightest\r\nheadway against her underlying problem, so, as I sometimes do, I\r\ntold her in detail the history I have told you in this chapter. She\r\nlistened, at first with hostility and then with the growing shock of\r\nself-recognition. Just by listening she developed a genuine concern\r\nfor the very first time about her whole attitude. She left that session\r\nwith an avowed intent to look more deeply and more thoroughly into\r\nthe whole matter and to reshape her values. There was no more talk of\r\ndivorce from her; just hard work on her real problem, and success,\r\nfinally, in dislodging the cause of it.\r\n\r\nSeeing one’s own responsibility in a situation is often difficult.\r\nHowever, in this problem of frigidity, not to take the blame is even\r\nmore difficult. It means--and has meant for millions--that one almost\r\nliterally commits sexual suicide, embraces emotional isolationism as\r\nthe proper condition for womankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nWHY WOMEN CAN BECOME FRIGID\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time ago a young husband sat in my office. His wife had come to\r\nme for help for a frigidity problem, and after the first session he\r\nhad asked her if he might see me. I take that to be a good omen for a\r\nrelationship, generally, and I was not disappointed when I met him. He\r\ntold me very quickly that he did not care how long it might take for\r\nhis wife to get over her difficulty. “I’d stay with her even if she\r\ndidn’t,” he said in a low voice. “I don’t love her problem, but I love\r\nher and I want you to know that I didn’t marry her for better only but\r\nfor worse as well.”\r\n\r\nNo matter how much a psychiatrist hears about love, its difficulties\r\nand its triumphs, a statement like that always moves one, makes one\r\nfeel that tasks and difficulties have been somehow lightened. In short,\r\nI liked him, and this moved me to ask him about himself. “That’s what I\r\ncame to tell you about,” he said. “There’s something I thought just may\r\nbe of some help.”\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted to tell me was the amazing similarity between his\r\nbackground and his wife’s, and as he talked on I could see some of\r\nthe reasons for his broad sympathy with her problem. They were both\r\nchildren of farm people and had been reared in the strictest of Puritan\r\ndisciplines. They were both the oldest children, and each had had two\r\nbrothers and a sister. Their mothers had hated and feared sexuality\r\nand had communicated quite freely to the children their feeling that\r\nit was dirty and wicked. The fathers had been punitive on the one hand\r\nand withdrawn on the other. This young man had broken away from home\r\nas early as possible and so had his wife. They had come to the city,\r\ngotten jobs in the same business, and here they had met.\r\n\r\nI will take leave of our young husband now because the above facts\r\nillustrate the question I want you to ask yourself. However, in case\r\nsome of my warmth toward him has come over to you, I can tell you that\r\nhis marriage had a most happy outcome. His wife, motivated strongly,\r\nI am sure, by the sense of security his love gave her, was able to\r\nresolve her frigidity and the other neurotic problems which invariably\r\naccompany it.\r\n\r\nBut to the question: With almost identical backgrounds, why had the\r\nwife developed a rather severe frigidity problem and the husband\r\nremained perfectly normal sexually?\r\n\r\nIf you wish to extend that question you may ask yourself: Why is\r\nfrigidity so widespread among women and sexual impotency so rare among\r\nmen? We saw that under the adverse conditions caused by the Industrial\r\nRevolution women could, by the millions, abandon sexual gratification,\r\nconvince the world and themselves that, biologically speaking, they\r\nwere asexual beings. There was never the faintest suspicion that man,\r\non the other hand, would or could abandon his sexual nature, no matter\r\nhow difficult the going became. Men might develop neuroses, they might\r\neven take odd sexual directions, develop perversions, if their parents\r\nwere sufficiently neurotic. But abandon sexual gratification en masse,\r\nthey could not.\r\n\r\nI think we now understand the answer to this problem, and I think\r\nit will be helpful for you to learn what we know about it. You\r\nwill be able to see why the problem of frigidity is so basically\r\n_psychological_ in nature, for one thing, and therefore why, when a\r\nwoman’s chief complaint is frigidity, we feel that if she really means\r\nbusiness she can get over it.\r\n\r\nThere are three major reasons why frigidity can develop in women. I am\r\ngoing to treat two of them here and reserve one of them for the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sexual Drive in Women_\r\n\r\nA lovely actress I was treating for a rather severe frigidity problem\r\ncame for her regular hour one day and paused on the threshold of my\r\noffice. She appeared different--her face was softer, her motions\r\nslower--she was elated, and I felt at once that she had experienced the\r\nfirst reward for the hard work she had put upon her problem.\r\n\r\nI was right and shall never forget her method of telling it. She had\r\non a lovely pink cape; its flowing lines and delicate color seemed to\r\nexpress the very essence of the feminine. As she stood smiling at me\r\nshe unbuttoned the cape and with a beautiful gesture threw it on the\r\nfloor between us. “Thus we can cast it away,” she said. Then, stooping,\r\nshe picked it up. “And _thus_,” she said, “we can put it on again,”\r\nand with a flourish she put it back on her shoulders. That hour was a\r\ncelebration of her new-found capacity.\r\n\r\nHer histrionic gesture, expressive of so much happiness in her, was\r\nnot only graceful but was deeply symbolic of woman’s sexual nature. To\r\nsee why this is so, let us first turn our attention to the biological\r\nmeaning of the sexual drive.\r\n\r\nYou perhaps know that every animal is motivated by a profound\r\ninstinctual need to preserve his species. His nature has developed\r\nthose characteristics that ensure the ongoingness of his kind,\r\nlemmings excepted, perhaps. We know that characteristics that _do_\r\nensure the species are, so to speak, more deeply rooted in the biology\r\nof a given animal than characteristics that are not absolutely\r\nnecessary to the preservation of a species.\r\n\r\nNow, in the human animal and in many other species, sexual intercourse\r\nis the basic method by which the species is continued. In this\r\nelemental instinctual activity the male deposits his sperm in the\r\nreceptive female, who then, within her body, nurtures and protects it\r\nuntil it is ready for birth.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the important point: In order to deposit his sperm, the male\r\n_must have an orgasm_. If he did not, the sperm could not be deposited\r\ninside the female. Thus the male orgasm is absolutely necessary to the\r\ncontinuation of the species. If the male had ever lost his ability to\r\nhave an orgasm the species would have disappeared from the face of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not a biological _necessity_ for woman to have an orgasm\r\nto fulfill her sexual role. It is only necessary for her to receive the\r\nsperm. The mere reception of it, no matter how unresponsive she may be\r\nto the ardors of the male, fully discharges her duty to the species of\r\nmankind. Maternity, not orgasm, is her biological duty. She can be as\r\nfrigid as the polar cap and it will not necessarily affect her ability\r\nto have children in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\nCan you see the implications? One of my colleagues summed up the\r\ndifference in this way: “To express it in a purely biological sense,\r\nthe male orgasm is a necessity. The female orgasm is a luxury.” This\r\n“necessary” aspect of the male orgasm explains why men, no matter how\r\ndeeply disturbing their childhood experiences may be, rarely lose their\r\nability to have an orgasm and why women so frequently do.\r\n\r\nPlease do not misunderstand me, however. I am _not_ saying that the\r\norgasm a woman has, when she is able to achieve it, is any less\r\nintense than a man’s. Nor am I saying that it is not necessary to her\r\npsychological well-being, to her maturity, to be able to achieve it.\r\n\r\nI _am_ saying that a woman’s ability to have an orgasm is far more\r\nsubject to outside influences than a man’s ability. It is in many ways\r\nmore subject to the psychological experiences, the mental and moral\r\ntraumas of growing up. Compare the female orgasm to a shallowly rooted\r\ntree which the wind may blow down more easily than its deeply rooted\r\nbrother, it is still a tree, however, and if it can be sheltered and\r\nprotected from storms that are too severe it can flower as beautifully\r\nas any other.\r\n\r\nThe fact that frigidity is so psychological, so subject to the mind,\r\ngives it almost a “willful” character. It is often as if a woman had\r\n“chosen” to be frigid in a very real sense. I don’t mean consciously\r\nchosen to be, generally speaking. It’s an unconscious choice. But\r\nthe fact that it has that element of choosing in it often makes it a\r\npoignant condition indeed.\r\n\r\nI know one case where the “choice” was, in part at least, conscious,\r\nand I am going to tell it briefly to emphasize my point, the fact that\r\nfrigidity has a very high element of the mental as opposed to the\r\nbiological.\r\n\r\nYears ago, on a vacation with my husband, I met an older woman with\r\nwhom, until her death, I had a very close and highly valued friendship.\r\nShe was a wonderful woman. She was a doctor, but this had not prevented\r\nher from having five children of her own, two of whom have since become\r\nquite famous.\r\n\r\nOne day, after our friendship had deepened and we had begun to exchange\r\nconfidences, she told me the following story. She had been deeply in\r\nlove with her husband but had been totally frigid. This had not seemed\r\nstrange at the time; she had been married in 1904, and the traditions\r\nof Victorianism were still very much adhered to. However, after the\r\nbirth of her third child she began to experience some feelings of\r\npleasure during intercourse, and these gradually increased. At this\r\npoint she had her fourth child, and intercourse was interrupted for\r\ntwo or three months. When it was resumed her feelings of pleasure had\r\nincreased enormously and on the second time she had a profound orgasm.\r\n\r\nBut she was not, like my actress, delighted with the new horizons the\r\nexperience opened up for her. She was very consciously frightened and\r\nvery consciously ashamed. All her background and training had been\r\nagainst it. She consciously decided never to let the experience repeat\r\nitself. She was entirely successful in her resolution, she told me.\r\nUnlike my actress, she threw off the lovely pink cloak of her feminine\r\npotentiality and never donned it again. Her husband had died after the\r\nbirth of their last child, and it was not until a few years afterward,\r\nwith the new information science had developed on the subject, that she\r\nrealized the tragedy of her decision.\r\n\r\nIt’s a poignant story, but I have not told it for that reason. I have\r\ntold it because it illustrates very clearly how subject to the mind, to\r\noutside cultural and moral influences, feminine sexuality can be. If a\r\ngrown woman can choose to destroy her mature and flowering sexuality\r\nat the height of its strength, just think of the fragility of this\r\nsexuality in the bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fear of Motherhood_\r\n\r\nOn the whole, women will face anything to achieve motherhood. Recently\r\na woman of thirty-five came to my office. She had called me twice to\r\nmake appointments and twice broken them at the last moment. When this\r\nhappens a psychiatrist will generally assume that the patient has\r\nbecome frightened of her decision to face up to whatever problem is\r\ntroubling her and has gone into a last-minute flight. I had assumed\r\nthat about this patient and had expected, if I ever did see her, to\r\nencounter a reticent, scared, perhaps terrified person.\r\n\r\nInstead the person who sat opposite me was a very pretty woman of\r\nthirty-five, well dressed, clear-eyed, and straightforward. She came\r\nright to the point.\r\n\r\n“I’m here because I’m terrified of having children,” she told me. “I\r\nmust find out what’s at the root of my fear.”\r\n\r\n“Was your fear the reason you canceled the two appointments?” I asked\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” she answered quickly, “the children were ill. We’ve had flu\r\nfor a month. First one came down and then another.”\r\n\r\n“Children?” I asked in puzzlement. “What children?”\r\n\r\n“Mine, of course,” she said.\r\n\r\n“How many do you have?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Four,” she said, “but John and I want six and I thought … ” She\r\npaused; then, catching my smile, she looked down at the floor for a\r\nmoment and back at me, and then we both burst into laughter.\r\n\r\nShe did have a fear of childbirth, however, dating from certain\r\ntraumatic experiences in her childhood, and we were able to resolve it.\r\nIt was a marked fear, but the important point is that even with it she\r\nhad gone right on and had four children.\r\n\r\nThe maternal instinct is as deep and as ineradicable in women as the\r\ninstinct to plant the seed of his species is in man. They both subserve\r\nthe same ends, the continuation of the race, and even if a woman’s\r\nchildhood is sown with neurotic fears by unhappy parents--yes, even\r\nneurotic fears of childbirth--her desire to have children of her own\r\nwill, in by far the majority of cases, survive relatively intact.\r\n\r\nThank heavens this is so. For the bearing and rearing of children are\r\nthe beautiful destiny toward which a woman’s whole body and personality\r\npoint from earliest childhood on. If this profound goal cannot be\r\nachieved, the result is far too often a shriveling of the personality\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\nThank heavens this is so, too, for the good of the race. I thought one\r\nof my colleagues expressed the whole thing very neatly in a paper given\r\nto a private psychiatric group recently. “If the feminists had been\r\nable to injure the maternal instinct of nineteenth-century woman to the\r\nsame degree that they injured her sexual instinct, the Western world\r\nwould by now be well on its way to being depopulated.”\r\n\r\nNo, the maternal instinct cannot be fundamentally affected by adverse\r\ncircumstances. However, the proper handling of information about the\r\nmaternal instinct by a mother is very important to the proper sexual\r\ndevelopment of her daughter. Misunderstandings about maternity and what\r\nit means can scare a young child badly--so badly, in fact, that fear of\r\nit can be a direct cause of later frigidity.\r\n\r\nHere’s why the maternal instinct can cause trouble to a young girl’s\r\ndeveloping sexuality. Most women know this, even if they have never\r\nphrased it in this manner.\r\n\r\nTo gratify the maternal instinct a woman has to put her very life right\r\non the line. In a real sense she has to be willing to say, and to keep\r\non saying: “I am willing and ready to die for the sake of or the safety\r\nof my child.”\r\n\r\nI’m not only speaking of the now very slim chance that she might die in\r\nchildbirth, though I should like to point out that until very recently\r\nthat possibility had to be faced by every mother-to-be. And the\r\nenormously high mortality rate in childbirth throughout history and in\r\nevery civilization shows very clearly that women _were_ willing to face\r\ndeath to have their child. They have not changed.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean more directly, however, is the fact that the maternal\r\ninstinct demands of the woman in every situation an ever-readiness to\r\nput her child before herself, before her safety, before her personal\r\nneeds, before everything.\r\n\r\nJust yesterday I read of a woman who had saved two of her children\r\nfrom their burning home. The place had gone up like tinder and she had\r\nsnatched them up, one seven and one ten, and, holding them under her\r\narms, brought them to safety down a flaming stairway. She had thought\r\nher twelve-year-old had gotten out by himself but then discovered that\r\nhe had not. She started back at once, without a moment’s hesitation, to\r\nrescue him, but the building was now on the point of collapse and she\r\nwas restrained by several firemen. However, so powerful was her drive\r\nto save her child that she broke away from their grasp and entered the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nShe found him, too, on the kitchen floor, overcome by smoke, and\r\nsomehow got him to the front hall and out. She was badly burned, though\r\nshe will live. But the child was all right; the child was all right!\r\n_That_ was all that mattered.\r\n\r\nAnd it is all that matters to every mother, unless, of course, she is\r\ndreadfully ill mentally--psychotic, in fact.\r\n\r\nJust think of it; this aspect of the maternal instinct is more powerful\r\nthan the instinct for self-preservation, which is known to be one of\r\nthe basic instincts of all life. It supersedes self-preservation,\r\nannuls it; there are no reservations about it. It will never whisper:\r\n“You’ve done all you can; three powerful men are holding you down and\r\nyou can’t get to him anyway.” It will fight powerfully and to the very\r\nend for the mother’s right her indomitable need, to save her child.\r\n\r\nOf course most mothers never have to face physically dangerous\r\nsituations for their children. In most lives the way this aspect of the\r\nmother instinct expresses itself is in everyday sacrifices. Mothers\r\ngive up (and, in the healthy woman, with pleasure, by preference) their\r\ntime, intellectual pursuits, careers, first to have the child and then\r\nto see him safely to maturity. Everything else a woman could call her\r\nown becomes secondary to this impulse in the maternal woman. As you saw\r\nin the normal woman, there are checks and balances within the female\r\npersonality which prevent her from making a psychological martyr of\r\nherself to the point where she would be a _detriment_ to her children,\r\nbut at this time I should like to make a different point.\r\n\r\nI have said that the maternal instinct is more powerful than the\r\ninstinct for self-preservation. I ask you to imagine for a moment how\r\neasily this characteristic of women could frighten a young girl if the\r\nexperience of pregnancy or the role of the mother is presented to her\r\nin an improper way. She will react with acute anxiety, fear, rather\r\nthan with joyful anticipation. This anxiety will color in dark hues\r\nthough will not overwhelm her desire and determination to have babies.\r\nIt _will_ tend to take all the pleasure out of her sex life, however;\r\nit _will_ tend strongly to make her frigid. And it will tend to make\r\nher a less effective mother, even a very poor one indeed.\r\n\r\nThe biological role of woman is motherhood. If a woman cannot dare to\r\naccept this aspect of her destiny, she will be deeply defeated in her\r\nlife. From any standpoint one wishes to look at the maternal role, it\r\nis a great and beautiful one, embodying in it and giving expression to\r\nqualities that are universally admired and cultivated: nobility, the\r\nsacrifice of self, fortitude, love that passeth understanding.\r\n\r\nThe depreciation of motherhood in any sense whatsoever in the mind\r\nof a young girl is a crime against her if one is in a position to\r\nbe influential with her. To fill her with fears, misunderstandings,\r\nresentments of and reservations about her historic role is to cut\r\nher off from full flowering as a woman. The ability of woman to have\r\nan orgasm, her deepest form of relatedness to man, is planted rather\r\nlightly in biological soil, as we saw in the first section of this\r\nchapter. This ability is tightly interwoven with her psychological\r\nexperiences at every stage of her development, and the quickest and\r\nmost effective way to force her into frigidity is to teach her to be\r\nfrightened of the maternal aspects of her personality.\r\n\r\nWe saw how well womankind functioned before the Industrial Revolution\r\nas an equal partner with her husband in the family home. Her\r\nexperiences were fully satisfying to her body and mind because her role\r\nwas recognized at its true value; she was needed, rewarded, depended\r\nupon, universally admired. When she lost her role and, in agony,\r\nmistakenly turned to feminism to find a new definition of self, or to\r\nVictorianism, she found only ashes, a depreciation of all those things\r\nthat made her a woman; she found, and adopted, values that turned her\r\nagainst her feminine self, her maternal self, her passionate self.\r\nScorn for true femininity was what she found and, tragically, she took\r\nthis attitude for her own.\r\n\r\nIf woman is to find true happiness once again, she must return to her\r\nreal and joyful self. She must relearn that surrender to her biological\r\ndestiny is not a trap, not a condition of slavery to her uterus, of\r\nexploitation by man and nature, but rather a wonderful and privileged\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI should like to give the contents of a letter that came into my hands\r\nrecently. I consider it a beautiful letter. It describes in a very\r\nsimple way the reactions of a woman who had been caught in a maze of\r\nmisunderstanding and fear but who had found her way out, had learned\r\nthe power and joy she could receive by surrendering to her true destiny.\r\n\r\nThis letter was written by a young woman who had just become pregnant.\r\nSix months before, sick with anguish at her joyless marriage, unable\r\nto enjoy any aspect of her sexual relationship because of a constant\r\nand acute fear of becoming pregnant, she had consulted the pastor of\r\nher church, having heard that her church had psychiatric services. The\r\npastor had gained her admission to a group-therapy project run by a\r\npsychologist. The group was made up of women who had encountered some\r\ndifficulty in their lives with their husbands and children.\r\n\r\nThe patient had attended the group for four months and then had had\r\nto leave, for her husband’s job had been transferred to another part\r\nof the state. The letter, sent to members of the group, arrived three\r\nmonths after her departure. I have received special permission from\r\nthis ex-patient to reproduce this letter on the understanding that the\r\nnames originally mentioned in it be changed.\r\n\r\n  _Dear, dear Friends_:\r\n\r\n I will leave out all the details of our move here except to say that\r\n we are all settled down and in our wonderful new home. Anyway, I can’t\r\n wait to tell you that I am going to have a baby. It is a constant\r\n astonishment to me, for it is so different from my expectations. It\r\n all happened so easily. I don’t quite know how, but my fears and\r\n worries have left completely. I didn’t know life could be like this. I\r\n must be a new person. If the doctor hadn’t told me to stay relatively\r\n quiet I would be dancing in the streets. Sam says I sound like a\r\n honeymooner, but he’s really delighted. To think what I have deprived\r\n both of us of because of a lot of nonsense!\r\n\r\n The strangest thing is that I can’t remember the things I used to talk\r\n about in the group. I wonder if this happens to everybody. I keep\r\n asking myself: What was so painful? What was it that made me always\r\n angry with Sam? And I’ve found a new deep love for my mother. I am not\r\n angry with her, only sorry that she had to miss so much. You probably\r\n won’t remember, but when I asked my mother how she had felt when she\r\n was pregnant she had said quite sharply to me: “Put such thoughts out\r\n of your mind. You’re young, so enjoy yourself. You’ll know all about\r\n it soon enough, too soon.” The reply seemed so ominous and foreboding\r\n to me. Plus the fact that she was constantly complaining about all\r\n things female. I guess I had picked up her attitude in toto without\r\n realizing it, until I aired the effects on me for the first time with\r\n all of you.\r\n\r\n I tell you this so that you will know the fears _do_ go when you are\r\n able to get them out and see them for what they are. I love you all,\r\n and I am deeply grateful to you, and I shall never, never forget the\r\n help my talk with all of you has given me.\r\n\r\n  _With love and deep gratitude_,\r\n  MARGARET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND DESTINY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen two important reasons why women can, in the course of\r\ngrowing up, be deflected from true sexual maturity. Let us now look at\r\na third, and equally important, reason.\r\n\r\nI have already described the so-called clitoridal woman to you, but now\r\nI must tell you more about the implications of her problem. You will\r\nremember that in the female genitalia both the clitoris and the vagina\r\nare capable of experiencing orgasm. This fact is of decisive importance\r\nto the problem of frigidity in women.\r\n\r\nWhy? It means, in effect, _that women have two distinct sexual\r\norgans, both capable of bringing her release from sexual tension_.\r\nIn the unconscious sense many women can “choose” one type of sexual\r\nsatisfaction in preference to another. This ability to choose often\r\nspells disaster, for one of these methods of gratification represents\r\nimmaturity and is allied to neurosis.\r\n\r\nA man has only one organ: his penis. He has been given no anatomical\r\nalternative. If, as happens in relatively rare cases, upsetting early\r\nexperiences cause him to block off his sexual feelings, he simply\r\nbecomes impotent. He will experience this impotency as a tremendous and\r\ntragic deprivation and will be powerfully motivated to overcome it.\r\nThose who have witnessed the sufferings of a man with such a problem\r\nwill know just how powerful his drive back to health is.\r\n\r\nThe mature female’s orgasm takes place within the vagina; the fact that\r\na woman can experience this kind of orgasm generally marks her as a\r\nfully developed woman in all aspects of her personality.\r\n\r\nThe clitoral orgasm takes place on the clitoris only. It excludes\r\nthe vagina from sensual participation and it is often independent of\r\nthe male penis. This kind of orgasm is possible at an early stage in\r\nfemale development. If, in growing up, the young girl becomes for any\r\nnumber of reasons frightened of mature vaginal sexuality, she can\r\nblock that pathway and keep it blocked permanently without consciously\r\nexperiencing any strong feelings of being deprived. She can do this\r\nbecause she is already having, as far as she knows, an amply satisfying\r\nexperience through her clitoral orgasm. Since she has never experienced\r\ntrue sexual awakening, she doesn’t know what she is missing,\r\nconsequently she doesn’t miss it.\r\n\r\nYou can see then that the woman who is able to have only a clitoral\r\norgasm has no very strong motive for moving on to the next stage of\r\nsexual development. Her developing sexuality is channeled off into a\r\nsensual cul-de-sac and there, unless valiant and very conscious steps\r\nare taken, it tends to remain. As the early years of development move\r\non into adolescence and further, the direction of her sexuality will\r\nnot change, for she feels no reason to change it. Indeed the channel\r\ngrows deeper, the earlier method of sexual response more ingrained. In\r\nthe end she can respond in no other way.\r\n\r\nSince such a woman is not advancing sexually she tends, too, to remain\r\nstatic emotionally. If her psychological fears of real womanhood are\r\nnot resolved, she now begins to build up defenses of her childish\r\nemotional needs and of her childish methods of sexual gratification.\r\nBy the time she is ready, in terms of her age, for marriage, she may\r\nvery well have a full-blown neurosis that militates gravely against the\r\nsuccess of any close relationship.\r\n\r\nThis then, is how, biology can represent destiny, with a helping hand\r\nfrom psychology. In a very real sense this dual potentiality of woman’s\r\nanatomy contains the seeds of sexual and hence personal tragedy.\r\n\r\nRemember that the woman whose orgasm is confined to the clitoris is\r\ndefinitely frigid. Statistics on the prevalence of this kind of sexual\r\nproblem are not available, but most psychiatrists and psychoanalysts\r\nagree that it is very widespread, may even be the dominant form of\r\nfrigidity in our society.\r\n\r\nUnhappily many women who suffer from this form of frigidity have\r\nnot been helped in the past several years by widely published and\r\nthoroughly erroneous views concerning sexual behavior in the human\r\nfemale. The Kinsey report, above all, has erred in this respect. It\r\nmakes no differentiation between vaginal and clitoral orgasm. Indeed\r\nits authors passionately defend the view that all orgasm is clitoral.\r\nHow trained observers could come to this conclusion, it is difficult to\r\nsay. The great observers in the field of human sexuality in the past\r\nfifty years have been in the field of psychiatry. They have been and\r\nare unanimous in their observation on the difference between clitoral\r\nand vaginal orgasm and its importance to personality development and to\r\nneurosis. The fact that the Kinsey report ignores this important and\r\nwell-established fact about the female sex and, even worse, defends the\r\nopposite viewpoint simply invalidates, from psychiatry’s viewpoint,\r\nmany of its basic findings about orgasm.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing, however, is that the Kinsey report is often used to\r\nbolster the neurotically defensive attitude of women who are able\r\nto achieve only clitoral orgasm. They can say to themselves that\r\ntheir method of gratification is perfectly normal; do they not have\r\na tremendous body of “scientific” data to support their view? And\r\nsomehow or other women with this difficulty do get hold of the Kinsey\r\n“results.” I myself have had several women suffering from the kind of\r\nproblem I have just described quote Kinsey to me at some length in\r\ndefense of their method of gratification. And, having checked with\r\nseveral of my colleagues, I find that they all report many similar\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate. Women who suffer from any other form of frigidity\r\nare frequently motivated to face up to their problem by feelings of\r\nsexual frustration. Sooner or later, driven by natural hungers, they\r\nwill take steps to throw off the yoke of their difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe woman who is able to have a clitoral orgasm, however, has no such\r\nstrong motivation. She can ruin her life and never be the wiser, never\r\nrealize the reason why.\r\n\r\nI strongly advise, therefore, that such women be more than usually wary\r\nabout their tendency to be complacent, more than usually insistent\r\nabout finding a way out of their dilemma; above all, they must\r\nrecognize their life situation _as_ a dilemma, a serious one that can\r\nfar too easily be rationalized.\r\n\r\nAt this point, then, I wish to emphasize once more the role of woman’s\r\nresponsibility in this matter of sexual response. There is often a\r\nstronger-than-usual underlying irrational fear in clitoridal women\r\nwhich makes them hesitate, even when they have admitted their problem,\r\nto face up to it in any effective way. I wish therefore to reiterate\r\nthe point that nobody who suffers from this problem should feel shame\r\nor blame for it. You did not choose in any conscious sense to remain\r\non this earlier and less “dangerous” plane of sexual development. Your\r\nbody made the choice, if you will, but you had nothing to say about\r\nthat. The strange dual sexuality of woman is at the base of the matter.\r\nIt all happened because you misunderstood or misinterpreted certain\r\nearly experiences. Or a grown-up responsible for your very early\r\ntraining was ignorant or misinformed.\r\n\r\nBut now it will be the better part of wisdom and valor for you to face\r\nup to the fact that your method of gratification is an expression of\r\nimmaturity, even if that immaturity was forced upon you when you were\r\ntoo young to know the difference. Don’t subside into feelings of guilt\r\nand inferiority about the problem. Remember that you are not alone.\r\nThere are probably millions of women who have the same problem. You can\r\nbe one who achieves the joys that lie just beyond this. They are real\r\nand solid joys, and they contain none of the terrors you had thought\r\nthey contained. Not one.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I have found helpful in motivating a woman with a\r\nclitoridal problem is to face her with its effect on her husband. Women\r\nwith this fixation have a curious inability to see these effects or to\r\nface up to them realistically. I have found that even when such women\r\nknow that their form of gratification is infantile and expressive of\r\nneurosis they insist that their husbands not only do not mind the\r\nmanual manipulation necessary to bring them to climax but actually\r\nprefer this method of sexual contact to intercourse.\r\n\r\nSuch has never been the case in my years of clinical experience.\r\nHusbands mind very much indeed.\r\n\r\nHere, very recently, is what one husband, whose wife has been able to\r\nmove on from her clitoral fixation, told me: “I feel like a man again.\r\nNo matter what anybody says, your wife’s response is the most important\r\nthing, and it’s got to be a response _in_ intercourse. If she doesn’t\r\nrespond that way, you gradually lose faith in yourself and then you\r\nlose interest in making love.”\r\n\r\nAnother man, whose wife has just come to me and who has never been\r\nable to have an orgasm except clitorally, recently said: “I may sound\r\nunsympathetic and petty, but if I felt there was no end in sight to\r\nthis kid stuff, I mean this form of having to stroke endlessly, I think\r\nI’d give up on the sex part. It’s lost all its fun.”\r\n\r\nHe’ll get his fun back, for his wife, knowing a lot more than she did\r\nwhen she started, is very intent on helping herself. And the husband is\r\n_not_ unsympathetic or petty in his complaints. He is simply human, and\r\nthere’s a limit to human endurance.\r\n\r\nThe wife’s denial that the husband is bothered by a clitoridal problem,\r\nI have found, is based on a deeper fear--the fear that the marriage is\r\nbeing endangered by her problem. Both of the women mentioned above (and\r\nmany others I have treated) finally admitted that they had come for\r\nhelp because of their fear that their marriage was headed for trouble,\r\nthat their husbands were close to leaving them. The fact is, though,\r\nthat many men seem to have a very high tolerance for this problem in\r\ntheir wives. I have yet to find any man who has broken up his marriage\r\nfor that reason. Indeed both the men I have quoted above had reassured\r\nme that they could and would go on taking their frustrations. They just\r\nstrongly preferred not to.\r\n\r\nNo, the danger is not from the husband. Real men rarely leave women\r\nfor that reason. The danger is from the woman herself. She it is who,\r\nbecause of her immaturity, will do the rejecting rather than face her\r\nproblem. The real danger is that she will force the man away from her\r\nwithout even realizing that she has done so.\r\n\r\nYou begin to see, then, that the chief characteristic of women with\r\nthis type of problem is evasiveness, hiding from the facts. It is as\r\nif they feared what they would find out if they faced up to things. I\r\ncan only tell them that they are not going to find out a thing that is\r\nreally frightening, not a thing that they cannot handle.\r\n\r\nAnd I should like to put the mind of all such women to rest on one\r\nparticular point I cannot count the number of times that women with\r\na clitoridal problem have asked me whether I believed that, just\r\nunder the surface, they had a homosexual problem or at least strong\r\nhomosexual inclinations. The answer is invariably no.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example of one such typical case. Not long ago a\r\nyoung nurse came to see me. She was extremely upset and wept copiously\r\nbefore she could bring herself to tell me her problem. She had been\r\nmarried for about a year and had found that she could not have an\r\norgasm during intercourse. It was necessary for her husband to\r\nmanipulate her clitoris for a rather extended period of time before\r\nshe could come to a climax. After she told me this she remained silent\r\nfor a long time. Then she burst out with it. “Doctor, I think I’m\r\nhomosexual.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, I had this dream, and I was hugging the head nurse in the\r\nhospital and I felt very warm and good inside.”\r\n\r\n“Any other damning evidence?” I asked.\r\n\r\nNow she really blushed. She hung her head, and one could hardly keep\r\nfrom going over and patting her head and saying there, there. “Yes,”\r\nshe said. “When I was twelve. With this other girl. We used to, used\r\nto … ” Words failed her.\r\n\r\n“Play with each other sexually?” I asked as gently as possible.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, wide-eyed and said, “Yes,” nodding tragically.\r\n\r\nShe had had no repetition of the experience since she had really grown\r\nup, and I was able to set her mind completely at rest on that matter.\r\nShe was not at all homosexual. That symptom is a very severe one, of\r\ncourse, and not always amenable to treatment. It always implies that\r\nthe woman prefers women to men; she falls in love with objects of the\r\nsame sex. She has no conscious interest in men sexually.\r\n\r\nOur little nurse’s “homosexual” dream simply meant that she was having\r\na disturbing time with her husband sexually and wanted a “mother image”\r\nto protect her from her difficulties, help her through them. She got\r\none in me, of course, and her need for such a mother was probably why\r\nshe selected a woman psychiatrist in the first place.\r\n\r\nHer early sexual play with another little girl is perfectly normal. Not\r\nall children indulge in this kind of play, but many do, and unless it\r\ncontinues into adolescence it is generally harmless.\r\n\r\nThe reasons behind this delusion of homosexuality are complex. They\r\nlie in an early confusion of the clitoris with the male penis, as I\r\nwill illustrate later. But you may be certain of one thing--you are\r\nnot going to discover that your problem is based on homosexuality as\r\nit appears in the difficulty called “lesbianism.” To hold onto such\r\nmistaken conceptions is to frighten oneself with self-told ghost\r\nstories after the fashion of young children.\r\n\r\nI wish here to cover just one more attribute of the woman whose sexual\r\nfeelings have become fixed on her clitoris, one which, if she is\r\nforewarned, she will and should be suspicious of. It is the tendency to\r\nlook for solutions for her problem in directions where no solutions lie.\r\n\r\nI have treated women who have tried everything under the sun in their\r\nsearch for an easy resolution of their clitoridal problem--drugs,\r\nsurgery, even yoga. One of the most widely used evasions can be found\r\n(and how often it is!) in the many popular manuals written, ostensibly,\r\nto tell one how to achieve a happy marriage. Such books, for the most\r\npart published in all good faith, almost invariably counsel married\r\npartners to diversify their sexual positions during intercourse. Many\r\nof these books contain illustrations to drive their lesson home.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with this advice in and of itself. Anybody\r\nwith a modicum of experience knows that variety is one of the finest\r\nspices of love. The books generally, if not always, neglect to say,\r\nhowever, that such variety is only relevant to a sex life in which the\r\npartners have no deep-seated sexual problem to start with. By omitting\r\nthat piece of information these books give the strong tacit impression\r\nthat variety of sexual position will solve an already well-established\r\nsexual difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe desperate woman will seize upon these implications as upon a\r\npanacea for her ills. I must state here that all of the innumerable\r\npositions of love described in the Hindu Kamasutra (from which so\r\nmany of our marriage manuals, incidentally, derive much of their\r\ninformation) will not undo a clitoral fixation. A woman is asking for\r\njust one more emotional defeat if she insists that a solution lies in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the three things that make frigidity possible in\r\nwomen. I will repeat them briefly so that you’ll remember them later.\r\n\r\nThe first is the fact that the female orgasm is not a biological\r\nnecessity in woman as it is in man. The race can and does go on if\r\nwomen fail to have full sexual satisfaction. This strongly suggests why\r\nthe female orgasm is so susceptible to psychological influences of an\r\nadverse kind.\r\n\r\nThe second is the fact that motherhood calls for tremendous\r\npsychological and sometimes physical sacrifices; it means that a\r\nwoman has to reverse the natural law of self-preservation and put her\r\nchildren’s welfare ahead of her own. This is deeply frightening to\r\nsome women and, unless they are properly educated, can cause them to\r\nfear their feminine sexual impulses to the point where they are unable\r\nto enjoy love-making.\r\n\r\nThe third reason is that women have, in effect, two organs of\r\ngratification, the clitoris and the vagina. Clitoral orgasm is\r\nimmature, evades true feminine sexuality, and is considered a form\r\nof frigidity. However, millions of women find this earlier method of\r\ngratification so satisfying that they are not motivated to move up to\r\nthe mature level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn medical school one of our courses included the study of the\r\npsychological stages of development man goes through from infancy to\r\nmaturity. It also included the various pitfalls people encounter during\r\nthese stages, the biological and psychological experiences that can\r\nprevent them from reaching psychological maturity.\r\n\r\nDuring one class in which we reviewed the psychological hazards\r\nof adolescence a very intelligent student raised his hand and was\r\nrecognized by the professor. “How does anybody _ever_ really grow up?”\r\nthis student asked.\r\n\r\nThe class laughed, of course. But the professor, after the laughter\r\nhad died down, took the question quite seriously and complimented the\r\nstudent for his acuity. He then proceeded to address us for a half\r\nhour on the indomitable and surging drive of the human body and mind\r\ntoward health and pleasure, a drive that will often overcome seemingly\r\ninsurmountable obstacles, that will pause for a while at times,\r\napparently defeated, only to revive its original energy and resume its\r\nmove toward the goal of health and maturity.\r\n\r\nWe see this drive daily in people who come for psychiatric help, and\r\nwe know that it is the single most important element in psychological\r\nhealing. As soon as the difficulty which was holding the person back\r\nhas been resolved, his whole mind and body tend once again to resume\r\nits move toward health and happiness. It is well to keep this factor in\r\nmind as we explore here the stages of development women go through on\r\ntheir way to grown-uphood.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the grown-up, truly feminine woman in operation. You\r\nwill remember that she is a delighted and delightful partner in that\r\nclosest and most perfect expression of love, the sexual act. You will\r\nrecall that a great part of her personality is organized around her\r\nmaternal instinct and that the chief characteristic of that instinct is\r\na pleasure in giving, an unappeasable altruism that always puts husband\r\nand child before self, even to the point of risking her own life and\r\nwelfare. Her central activities revolve around her nest building and\r\nchild rearing. Her personality is characterized by a deep intuitiveness\r\nabout others. She is inward and passive, her energies devoted to that\r\ndeepest of all needs, the procreation of the race of man through her\r\nown body. Her husband, by contrast, is aggressive, occupied basically\r\nwith his struggles in the outside world. Her stage, the focus of her\r\ncentral interest, is the home and its preservation and its happiness.\r\n\r\nHow did she get this way? Or, in the case of women who fail to achieve\r\na truly feminine personality, what actually happens, how do they get\r\n_that_ way?\r\n\r\nTo be able to answer these questions, one must first understand the\r\nstages of development that women, all women, go through in the process\r\nof growing up. These phases of development have been under the closest\r\nscientific scrutiny for several decades. The realization of their\r\nimportance for psychological health and illness has been one of the\r\nmajor achievements of modern psychiatry. They have been thoroughly\r\nexplored, and if we do not yet know all there is to know about the\r\nsubject, we still know a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe material I am about to go into is fact, scientific fact, not\r\nopinion. If the information here seems new or strange or even\r\nirritating to you, do not be surprised or upset. It is new and strange\r\nto most people and at first it may not seem applicable to you. But if\r\nyou will stay with it, use it to understand the case histories which I\r\nwill discuss afterward, you will gradually see why understanding these\r\nphases is so necessary and helpful to the individual who has not yet\r\nbeen able to achieve her full femininity. As you have been told many\r\ntimes, all psychological problems are rooted in infancy, childhood,\r\nor in adolescence. To uproot these problems, we must return to those\r\nstages of development with new tools, new ideas, a new master plan.\r\n\r\nThere are two over-all stages of biological and psychological\r\ndevelopment that every individual must go through. The first stage\r\nlasts from birth to about ten years of age. In turn this stage is\r\ndivided into two phases; the first, the phase we call infancy, lasts\r\nroughly for the first five years of life. The second phase we call the\r\nlatency period and occupies the second five years of life.\r\n\r\nThe first five years of growth, the infantile period, is of enormous\r\nimportance for later development. In this phase the whole personality\r\ntakes the shape and develops the characteristics that will distinguish\r\nit from that time on.\r\n\r\nAt this point I have to note a certain scientific fact that may\r\nsurprise or disconcert you. I ask you to withhold any prejudices of a\r\npersonal or moral kind you may have about this fact, for they will only\r\nobscure the entire issue and make it difficult for you to understand\r\none of the most important contributions science has made to the\r\nunderstanding of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe decisive fact, then, about the infantile period is that the little\r\ncreature is very heavily endowed with strong sexual feelings. The\r\nstudents of this subject are in absolute agreement on this point. There\r\nis no longer the slightest inkling of a doubt about it. All scientific\r\nmethods of checking the fact have been employed. These range from\r\ndirect observation of children to the recovery of childhood memories\r\nthrough hypnosis or while subjects have been under the influence of\r\nhypnotic drugs, direct reports from children, and several other sources.\r\n\r\nThis sexual drive is centered on the genitals from the outset, and it\r\ncan be seen very clearly in children who masturbate. Such masturbation\r\nis a perfectly normal activity in boys and girls during this entire\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe important point about this masturbation is the fact that the little\r\ngirl masturbates by the manipulation of her clitoris. She has no\r\nawareness of her vagina as a sensual area.\r\n\r\nThe sexual feelings of infancy increase in intensity after the second\r\nor third year. Now masturbation may increase. In a very real sense the\r\nstrong sensual feelings experienced at this age set the mold for the\r\nlater sexual development of the child.\r\n\r\nFor the first three years the little girl is deeply and primarily\r\nattached to her mother. In the sense that infants “realize” things, the\r\nlittle girl knows that her mother is the source of all her security.\r\nThese feelings have a very clear sensual nature. The little girl loves\r\nto be close to the mother, to be stroked by her, to have her mother\r\nclean her genitalia, etc. She associates her masturbation with the\r\npleasant sensations she receives, psychologically and physically, from\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nAround three years of age the little girl becomes aware of her\r\ngrowing attachment to her father. His tenderness toward her and his\r\nplay with her stimulate her whole being, and her sensuality becomes\r\nincreasingly attached to him. At first she is not aware of the conflict\r\nin this attachment, but as her little mind becomes a bit more aware\r\nof reality she senses, however vaguely and incompletely, the fact\r\nthat her increasingly sensual response to her father has put her into\r\ncompetition with her mother; another woman has a prior claim on her\r\nfirst man! At this point she begins to develop hostile feelings toward\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing seems too fantastic! A little child competing with her\r\nmother for her father’s love? Impossible!\r\n\r\nBut let me give you a very clear example of a typical dream my women\r\npatients have. This is the dream of a frigid woman who had had several\r\nconsultations with me and in one of them, the day before the dream,\r\nsuddenly remembered that at the age of five she had been absolutely\r\nconvinced that her father would marry her when she grew up. She had\r\nburied that memory in her mind, only to resurrect it in therapy.\r\n\r\nHer dream, then, was that she was lying in a crib. A tall thin\r\nman with glasses and a thin mustache was lying on a bed nearby. A\r\nstout, florid-faced woman lay next to him. Suddenly this woman had a\r\nconvulsive seizure and, after a few moments of writhing, became still.\r\nThe man then looked at her and smiled as if pleased. “She’s dead,”\r\nhe said. Then he rose from the bed, went to the crib, and picked\r\nmy patient up. “We will have four,” he said to her, and she felt\r\nimmeasurably excited and pleased.\r\n\r\nMy patient woke in a great state of anxiety. In our session she told\r\nme that her father had been tall, thin, and sometimes wore glasses to\r\nread in bed. And her mother was stout and very high-colored. My patient\r\nthen suddenly recalled that in the childhood fantasy of marriage to her\r\nfather she had decided that she would have four children with him. Her\r\nlogic was this: her mother had had three children; she would go her\r\nmother one better!\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how often we psychiatrists get, directly from our\r\npatients, information as clearly confirmatory as this of the existence\r\nof an early triangle between mother, father, and child. It causes a\r\nconflict in the child, of course, and this early conflict in the little\r\ngirl takes place in a very subtle manner, so subtle, indeed, that its\r\nvery existence escaped the conscious notice of mankind from the dawn\r\nof history until the end of the nineteenth century. Just before the\r\nturn of the twentieth century Sigmund Freud, then an obscure Viennese\r\npsychiatrist, while using hypnosis on patients suffering from powerful\r\nfeelings of repressed guilt, noted that these feelings were always\r\nconnected with very early sexual conflicts. He was astonished to\r\ndiscover that these sexual conflicts dated back to early childhood,\r\nand in case after case he was able to demonstrate not only that\r\nchildren possessed strong sensual feelings but that these feelings\r\nbecame attached first to the mother and then to the father, causing a\r\nconflict in the childish mind which had to be resolved. He called this\r\nthe Oedipal situation. If it was not resolved, the child developed\r\nirrational feelings of guilt which could and did impede normal sexual\r\nand psychological growth.\r\n\r\nI described this early source of conflict to a woman patient of mine\r\nrecently in much the same way that I have described it here. After\r\npondering for a moment she asked a question that goes to the heart of\r\nthe matter. “If this early situation causes a conflict in the child\r\nwhich can lead to a neurosis later, why did nature design things that\r\nway? I thought nature set things up to foster growth, not to hinder it.”\r\n\r\nThe observation and question were fine ones and raised points that\r\nare generally ignored. Nature _did_ design this early sexual conflict\r\nfor a very special reason. She did it to foster the growth of the\r\nlittle girl, to push her on to the next step in the development of her\r\nfemininity, to move her a little farther along the path to her ultimate\r\nrole of wife and mother.\r\n\r\nLet me explain this a bit further. For the first few years, by the very\r\nnature of family life, as we have seen, all the little girl’s feelings\r\nare focused on her mother. She is the center, the fountain of life\r\nitself; the little one looks to her for food, security on all levels,\r\nand “love.” This love soon becomes tinged with a very strong erotic\r\nfeeling connected with the little one’s growing sensuality, which, as\r\nwe have seen, is centered on her clitoris.\r\n\r\nNow, it is necessary for humans to love and to have erotic feelings\r\ncentered on others. But clearly, if this early love situation did not\r\nchange at some point, the little girl would grow up to have women as\r\nher erotic centers of interest. Nature intends no such end result.\r\nShe intends these erotic feelings to become ultimately very much\r\nman-centered. Thus she makes the role of the father in the child’s\r\ndevelopment all-important. He becomes the first bridge from the\r\ninfantile erotic and dependent relationship with the mother to mature\r\nrelationships with members of the opposite sex. There are, of course,\r\nseveral other bridges that the growing girl will have to traverse on\r\nher journey to maturity, but this first one is of central importance.\r\nUltimately, of course, she will have to give up her father, too, as the\r\ncenter of erotic interest, but he will remain in her unconscious life\r\nas the model of all that she wants from the male in her life.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, at the end of this early phase of development the first\r\nbig step in the preparation of the little girl for her ultimate destiny\r\nas wife and mother. But since we know that she is nowhere near ready\r\nfor such functions we might wonder how nature ends this early period\r\nand enters the second important period of growth.\r\n\r\nThe end of the first stage and the beginning of the second (which,\r\nyou will recall, will last to about ten years of age) begins with a\r\nremarkable psychological event: the early infantile sexuality goes\r\ncompletely underground. The little girl “forgets” that she ever went\r\nthrough such sensual experiences, that there was anything the least bit\r\nerotic in her former attachments. Her masturbation stops, under normal\r\ncircumstances, and she enters into approximately a five-year period of\r\ntotal non-sexuality.\r\n\r\nHowever, you must understand that when I use the word “forget” I do\r\nnot mean it literally. In psychiatry we use the word “repression” to\r\ndescribe this kind of forgetting. It means the ability of the human\r\nmind to push anything it does not wish to recall out of awareness, into\r\na part of the mind called the unconscious. When we repress something,\r\na memory or experience, we do not remember that it ever happened with\r\nour conscious mind. However, it remains quite intact in our unconscious\r\nmind and can and does exert an influence upon us that we are not aware\r\nof. Too, it can be revived in the conscious mind by later experiences,\r\nor, even if it does not revive, later experiences can be very much\r\ninfluenced by the “forgotten” memory.\r\n\r\nThe new stage into which the young girl now enters is called the\r\n“latency period,” because the sexual feelings of the earlier period\r\nhave become repressed, or latent.\r\n\r\nThe latency period is chiefly characterized by an attempt on the\r\npart of the little girl to understand and master her environment.\r\nIt is marked by a tremendous growth physically and mentally. She is\r\ninterested in everything, in everything that gives her a chance to\r\nadvance herself physically: rope-jumping, doll-playing, ball-playing,\r\nswimming, climbing, running; there is sometimes very little that she\r\ndoes, feels, or thinks in this period that distinguishes her in any\r\nvery important manner from a little boy of the same age. She may be a\r\nbit more obedient, a bit better about doing her homework than a boy,\r\nbut not dramatically so.\r\n\r\nWe may ask, then, what nature’s intention in bringing on this latency\r\nperiod might be? Let me put it this way. Nature, plainly and simply,\r\nwishes to give the child a chance to grow a little mentally, to\r\nlearn to master her body and mind, to integrate the earlier phase of\r\ndevelopment, to learn to form personal relationships so that when\r\nshe comes to the next great step in development, the phase marked by\r\nmenstruation and female maturation, she will be ready. Think what would\r\nhappen if the little girl were plunged from the stresses and strains of\r\ninfantile sexuality directly into full sexual readiness. Her body might\r\nbe ready, but psychologically she would have no understanding of her\r\nenvironment, no idea of personal relationships, no sense of her self\r\nor of her abilities. She would have, as the actress Elizabeth Taylor\r\nnoted of herself and her reaction to a too-early plunge into grown-up\r\nexperiences, “a child’s mind in a woman’s body.” Nature _intends_ no\r\nsuch dilemma for women. She has a step-by-step plan which leads the\r\nwoman, if parents co-operate, safely to the haven of physical _and_\r\npsychological maturity.\r\n\r\nThe latency period is also marked by a very close relationship to\r\nthe parents, particularly to the father. However, there are now no\r\nconscious sexual feelings attached to him. She admires and values her\r\nfather above all other things and wants his admiration and very high\r\nregard too. Most fathers instinctively give their little daughters a\r\ngreat deal of love and reassurance during this phase, and the child\r\nbasks in it as a flower in the sun. She strives to do the things\r\nthat will please him, make him notice her, make him love her. His\r\nresponses are studied assiduously, and it is in this way that she\r\nreceives her first real experience with the all-important feminine need\r\nto “please her man.” The feelings of joy she gets from his pleasure\r\nin her accomplishments, physical and mental, are the precursors of\r\nthe rewards she will later prize so highly when bestowed on her by a\r\nloving husband. As you might suspect, this period is very important\r\nto her development into full womanhood with its varied psychological\r\ngive-and-take. If the father seriously fails in his role during this\r\nperiod he can do irreparable harm to the growing girl.\r\n\r\nThe mother’s role, of course, continues to be important too. The little\r\ngirl has repressed her guilt feelings toward her mother, along with all\r\nof her directly sensual feelings, and during the latency period Mother\r\nemerges as a model to imitate. In effect the little girl says something\r\nlike this to herself: “She, after all, got the man I prize most highly\r\nin the whole world. Therefore, she must have something very desirable.\r\nTherefore, I’ll imitate it.” She proceeds to do just that.\r\n\r\nOf course I do not mean that this is _all_ there is to her feelings\r\nabout her mother; she loves her mother deeply and abidingly and without\r\nher would feel, and indeed would be bereft. Her imitation of her mother\r\nis a tribute to those feelings too. However, I may remind you that I am\r\nselecting those aspects of the child’s relationships that bear directly\r\non her later sexual maturity.\r\n\r\nThe next stage of development starts approximately at the age of ten\r\nand ends with the complete maturation, psychological and biological,\r\nof the individual woman. It is often divided into two phases; the\r\nfirst phase, which lasts until thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen, we call\r\npuberty; the second, by that much-misunderstood word “adolescence.”\r\n\r\nPuberty is ushered in by great glandular changes in the child. The\r\nyoung body begins to take on the semblance of womanhood. Breasts\r\nbegin to grow; pubic hair starts. Gradually the uterus, or womb,\r\nstirs, begins to expand, readies itself to hold the child which will\r\nultimately grow there. In the midst of this preparatory growth\r\nmenstruation, the cyclical ebb and flow of fecund woman, starts in\r\nearnest. In a few months the child stands just within the portal of\r\nphysical maturity.\r\n\r\nThe little girl now again (for the first time since infancy) begins\r\nto experience rather strong sexual feelings, and she reacts to them\r\nwith some anxiety. She may start once more to masturbate clitorally,\r\nalthough this time the act is accompanied by guilt feelings and with\r\napprehension. As I have pointed out, these feelings of apprehension can\r\nbe thought of as fully justified. Her sexuality is going to lead to\r\nmotherhood, and this in turn means that she is going to have to face\r\nthe dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, the biological need of putting\r\nher child’s welfare ahead of her own. In effect, as we have seen, she\r\nis going to suspend the law of self-preservation as it applies to her\r\nown person.\r\n\r\nThe little girl knows this; she knows it with her body and mind, for\r\neven the most prudishly reared child cannot be prevented from finding\r\nout the facts of life. If her parents have not told her she will soon\r\nfind out all there is to know from her girl friends.\r\n\r\nI have said that the new changes in her cause her apprehension. They\r\nalso cause her feelings of joy, excitement, and intense curiosity.\r\nThroughout her entire puberty she will run between these two states of\r\nmind, anxiety on the one hand and feelings of pleasure on the other. At\r\ntimes she will look back in envy at the blissful latency period when\r\nshe was not bothered by these powerful indications of her biological\r\ndestiny, which lies immediately ahead. She will hate her developing\r\nbreasts, her menstrual period, the hair growing under her arms and\r\naround her genitalia. At other moments she will be rapturous about\r\nthese very same changes.\r\n\r\nAt this point she withdraws from her parents to a large extent.\r\nNature, as we saw in the latency period, must not only prepare her\r\nbiologically for womanhood but must ready her psychologically too. If\r\nthe little girl were to maintain the total dependency on her parents\r\nthat she has had up to this point in her growth, she would not be able\r\nto develop the fullness of personality, the strength and individuality\r\nnecessary for successful wifehood and motherhood.\r\n\r\nBut she is not a woman yet by any means. Do not get that impression,\r\nfor there are vital steps ahead which she must take first. The attempt\r\nsome girls make to embrace true sexuality and feminine functioning\r\naround the age of fourteen or fifteen is generally disastrous. In\r\nnormal development she will flutter between strong feelings of\r\ndependency on her parents and rebellion against them, or rather\r\nrebellion against her intense desire to be a little girl with them\r\nagain. The success of this phase of her growth is marked by achieving\r\nthe feeling that she has the “potentiality,” _not_ the actuality, of\r\nfreedom from her parents.\r\n\r\nAt some point during this period she will become dramatically attached\r\nto a girl friend. This fact is so unalterable in normal development\r\nthat the whole period of puberty is often referred to as “the chum\r\nstage” of development. She uses this friend to buttress her feelings of\r\nseparateness, of independence from the parents. The two share secrets\r\ntogether constantly, pool their information on all matters pertaining\r\nto sex, boys, women, childbirth. The friendship is a liberal education\r\nfor both and should be encouraged for the most part. The girl friend\r\nis sometimes older by a year or two or three, and the younger one’s\r\nworship of her is clearly a substitute for her feelings toward her own\r\nmother. If the older girl is not too precocious sexually, nothing but\r\ngood can come from this relationship.\r\n\r\nVery gradually puberty merges into adolescence. This is the last stage\r\nbefore maturity. I call this whole period the “daydream stage.” It\r\nis a period of almost literal waking dreams on the part of the young\r\nlady. She is still held lightly by the long preparatory sleep of\r\nchildhood and early youth, but she is ready to wake. Her head is filled\r\nwith tremendous plans for herself. These plans usually have a highly\r\nmaternal and altruistic character about them; she will become a great\r\ndoctor and serve suffering humanity in darkest Africa, or she will\r\nbecome a lawyer and defend the poor free of charge, or she will become\r\na nurse and, under fire that would daunt a lesser creature, she will\r\ntend the wounded among our boys at the front. She has scores of great\r\nloves with boys or men whom she considers wonderful--all in her head.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of her now nearly mature maternal and sexual impulses\r\nthrough such dreams is clear. But they serve another function which is\r\nperhaps a bit more obscure. She is not quite ready for real love yet.\r\nShe has still half a foot in childhood, is still reluctant to give\r\nherself wholly to the realities of grown-uphood. She needs to hang upon\r\nthe tree, so to speak, for a few more years, to ripen a bit. The great\r\nroles she plays in her daydreams are, in most cases, not achievable.\r\nThey allow her, by the very impossibility of their fruition, to have\r\nher cake and eat it too.\r\n\r\nYes, the dream of young love is a long and lovely one, and it readies\r\nthe dreamer for real love. Woman will always be a romantic dreamer,\r\na weaver of inner reveries, of tapestries of thought that give her\r\nwhole personality its richness and flavor. In love, as in life, man is\r\na doer, an aggressive achiever. Woman is the passive one; she is the\r\ndreamer who values the man’s achievements, who creates the need for his\r\nachievement and gives color and glory to it through her appreciation of\r\nit. The dreams of adolescence ready her for this role with her man.\r\n\r\nAdolescence is a gradual preparation for true sexuality and love. In it\r\nthe young girl conquers her impulse to masturbate, though in certain\r\nrather “free” communities there may be a great deal of petting with\r\nthe opposite sex. If the girl’s development is normal and she puts the\r\nnormally high value on herself that is characteristic of this period,\r\nshe will not have sexual intercourse until she actually falls in love\r\nseriously. Also, nature gives her an almost unerring instinct for the\r\n“right” man, one who will cherish her and their children.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know that it is the man who ultimately wakens the\r\nsleeping beauty sexually. Until she is ready for intercourse and all\r\nthat it implies in the way of a relationship, she is conscious of no\r\nparticularly urgent vaginal sensations of a sexual nature. The man\r\nawakens these for the first time in the act of love.\r\n\r\nWith her first intercourse, she finds a whole continent of sensations\r\nwhose existence she had only heard about second-hand. While her\r\nclitoral sensations may still be quite pleasurable in the period of\r\nforeplay, her whole body now, in excitement, soon learns to yearn for\r\nthe penetration of her lover’s penis, the unspeakable delight of the\r\nnow vaginally centered sensations he can give her. She has little or no\r\nblock to these sensations; there may be a period of adjustment for a\r\nfew weeks or months until they become totally unfettered from childhood\r\ninhibitions and fears, but the months will be short. Now true orgasm\r\nis hers at virtually every sexual encounter with her husband, and in\r\nmutual delight their relationship will prosper and deepen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nDANGERS ON THE ROAD TO WOMANHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we have seen the stages the normal woman goes through on her way\r\nto true sexual and psychological maturity, the step-by-step process of\r\nher growth. But we must, of course, ask what might happen to impede\r\nthis growth, what pitfalls lie along the way into which she may stumble\r\n(or be pushed), causing her to develop symptoms of frigidity and the\r\npersonality difficulties that always accompany this frigidity.\r\n\r\nI should like to list these pitfalls in the same manner that I showed\r\nthe normal and unimpeded growth of a woman: by taking the stages of\r\ndevelopment in the order of their appearance. If you are able to see\r\nthe specific dangers along the path to grown-uphood, you may avoid\r\nrepeating them with your own child and may learn much about the origins\r\nof your own problem, particularly as I show their application in the\r\nspecific case histories that follow this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the first or infantile stage of development the greatest danger to\r\nthe child comes from ignorance on the part of the parents. In the past,\r\nparents did not know that the newborn babe has sensual feelings that\r\nbecome quite specific by the time he or she is three years of age and\r\ncontinue that way until he is about six. I am afraid many parents still\r\ndo not know this fact, either have not heard of it or do not believe it\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nSuch a lack of knowledge is often accompanied by a moral horror of\r\nmasturbation or, at the very least, of strong feelings of moral\r\ndisapproval. This often leads the parent, especially the mother, to\r\nrestrain the child from such sensual activity. Many parents slap the\r\ninfant’s hands, some systematically remove the child’s hands when they\r\nsee her playing with herself. Others, when the child learns to speak,\r\nwill reprove her for her activities, often spank her if the activity\r\npersists.\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude could not be more mistaken and can have a disastrous\r\neffect on the child. The infant is tremendously responsive to\r\neven the subtlest disapproval on the part of the parents. In this\r\nall-important area she will react violently to punishment and even\r\nto verbal warnings. Often she will not only attempt to prevent her\r\nown masturbatory activity but will try to repress the whole of her\r\nsexual nature in an effort to keep her mother’s love. She may be quite\r\nsuccessful in doing this, kill all her natural impulses in the bud.\r\nFirst experiences, as we know, are of great importance in development,\r\nand this early inhibition of her sexual nature can, and often does,\r\nlay the groundwork for sexual frigidity and a generally inhibited and\r\ncircumscribed personality.\r\n\r\nAnother danger in this period can come from an exorbitant amount of\r\novert love from the father. This is very difficult for certain men to\r\nunderstand fully. They argue, and quite cogently, that the young need\r\na great deal of love, demonstrative love. That is indeed so, but it\r\nmust also be remembered that children at this age are extremely erotic.\r\nThey can be overstimulated sensually if the father does not bestow his\r\nloving caresses in judicious amounts, and the result can be a strong\r\nfixation of erotic feelings on the father, with a consequent overload\r\nof guilt feelings. These guilt feelings can lead to total frigidity\r\nin later life, and indeed may be the leading cause of this symptom,\r\nas we shall presently see. I am not saying that a father should not\r\ncaress and dandle his little daughter; that would be against nature. He\r\nshould, however, dole out his physical expressions of love in amounts\r\nthat are not too stimulating to the child.\r\n\r\nAnother pitfall the child can encounter at this stage is quite the\r\nopposite in nature. It is, luckily, met with infrequently, but it does\r\nhappen and it can have an important effect on the child’s development.\r\nI am speaking of seduction by an older child or an adult. It is not\r\nunknown for nursemaids or even older brothers and sisters to stroke\r\nthe young child’s genitals. German and Austrian maids used to do it as\r\na matter of course, stroking the little boy’s testicles and penis or\r\nthe little girl’s vulva to put the child to sleep. However, this is\r\nabsolutely harmful to the child, causing an overexcitation that can\r\nhave a permanent effect on her sexuality. Masturbation is normal for\r\nthis age, and in this form of narcissistic sexual activity the child\r\nis able to control the amount of sexual excitation she receives. Under\r\nnormal circumstances she will not exceed this amount. However, stimuli\r\nfrom the outside are _not_ self-regulating, and the child’s ego is not\r\nsufficiently mature to handle this overexcitation.\r\n\r\nThe result of a seduction on the child at this age can be disastrous.\r\nIt can lead to any of the major forms or degrees of frigidity. In my\r\nexperience, however, it most frequently seems to lead to the form known\r\nas “psychic frigidity.”\r\n\r\nI might add that the same general effect can be caused by certain\r\nlocal irritations of the little girl’s genitalia. These can be easily\r\nrecognized. The itching and soreness of such irritations may cause the\r\nchild to scratch or stroke her genitals excessively, and this too may\r\noccasion an overexcitation which the little ego is not yet ready to\r\nhandle. Or it may cause the child to associate pleasurable sensations\r\nwith painful sensations, and this association can cause difficulties\r\nof a psychological nature later. Only real ignorance on the part of\r\nthe parent could allow such easily remedied conditions to persist to\r\nthe point where they might do harm to the child. On the other hand, I\r\ndo not wish to alarm parents unnecessarily or to cause any mother to\r\nbecome obsessively concerned about the frequent irritations children\r\nmay get in the genital area. To cause any real harm to the child\r\npsychologically, such irritations must be chronic and unattended to for\r\na long period. The usual short-term irritation has no known permanent\r\neffect on the child’s development psychologically.\r\n\r\nThe last major danger of this early period which I shall mention stems\r\nfrom any deep-seated emotional problem of the mother. If because of\r\nproblems created in _her_ childhood the mother either neglects or\r\noverprotects the child to a great extent or over a long period of time,\r\nthere can be serious harm done to the development of the little one.\r\nOverprotection can destroy the self-reliance of the child, keep her\r\nfrom passing into the rewarding and growth-provoking relationship with\r\nher father which moves her into the next natural step in development.\r\nNeglect, on the other hand, can thrust her into too close an\r\nassociation with the father and have equally dire results.\r\n\r\nFailure of the relationship with her father is the chief danger the\r\nlittle girl faces during her latency period, which, as you may recall,\r\nshe encounters from six to ten years of age. She has transferred many\r\nof the feelings of love and dependency, which a few years before she\r\nhad felt for her mother, to this new idol. Forever after he will be the\r\nmodel male in her life, though she will seek her ideal in other men.\r\nFor the present she worships him, and his approval means more to her\r\nthan anything else in the world.\r\n\r\nIf the father is a disapproving and critical man and directs such\r\nattitudes toward his daughter, she may develop strong feelings of\r\ninferiority. These can lead her to feel that men are virtually\r\nimpossible to please, and she can thus become fearful of them, feeling\r\nthat if a man finds out her true nature he will disapprove of it. No\r\nreality or later acceptance by a man will overcome this irrational\r\nconviction unless, when she is grown, a woman with such a self-attitude\r\nexamines herself deeply and eradicates this mistaken conception of the\r\nmale. Her feelings of inferiority extend to her sexual drive, which she\r\nis apt to repress, as if it were discreditable, like the rest of her\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nSome fathers, of course, have a closer identification with their sons\r\nthan with their daughters. Men who are not aware of this tendency can\r\nwreak great havoc with a daughter’s personality at this stage of her\r\ngrowth. Since she adores her father and wishes to become what he will\r\nadmire, she will quickly detect her father’s preference for the male.\r\nThis often causes her to attempt to cultivate male characteristics and\r\nmale pursuits and to depreciate totally all those typically feminine\r\ngoals which one day she must achieve if she is to be a true woman.\r\n\r\nThe latency period, as we saw, is a non-sexual time for both boys\r\nand girls. Aside from their anatomical structure, there is little\r\ndifference between boys and girls at this juncture: their glands\r\nfunction in roughly the same way; none of the typical characteristics\r\nwhich will differentiate them later have yet appeared. They are both\r\ninterested in mastering the world about them and the world inside\r\nthem; they are both roughly equal as far as their innate store of\r\naggressiveness is concerned. Indeed, many scientists call this whole\r\nperiod the bisexual period of development.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons a father who implants male goals into his daughter’s\r\npsyche at this point finds a ready audience. Psychoanalysis shows us\r\nthat the little girl very often can develop fantasies of an extremely\r\nodd kind at this juncture. In some children, for example, the idea that\r\nthey can somehow magically grow a penis and turn into a boy is too\r\noften quite conscious. But even if such ideas do not become conscious,\r\nthe yearning of the little girl to become a boy to win her father’s\r\nesteem can remain as part of the total equipment of her unconscious\r\nmind. Later, although hidden and disguised, this wish can be at the\r\nroot of much of her sexual problems with men, causing her to be\r\nneurotically competitive with them and to reject her own female role as\r\nunworthy.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the girl in puberty and in adolescence had a formidable\r\ntask to achieve. She must learn to accept and to love the “dangerous”\r\nrole of the woman--she must, in effect, be willing to reverse the\r\nnatural law of self-preservation and put childbirth and the welfare of\r\nthe child ahead of her own needs and safety.\r\n\r\nIf she is not encouraged to believe that the feminine role is a worthy\r\none, if she is taught that the male role is superior, then she will be\r\nhighly motivated to reject her femininity and, almost literally, try to\r\nbe a boy. It is frequently exactly this that occurs when a woman’s fear\r\nand rejection of femininity result in an inability to respond vaginally\r\nin sexual intercourse. In a curious and of course unconscious manner\r\nshe may hold onto the sensual responses of her clitoris as if she had\r\na small penis, but feel unable to allow the sensual feelings to be\r\nexperienced within the vagina.\r\n\r\nThe young girl may be influenced to reject her feminine role by the\r\nmother as well as by the father. If the mother herself has a strong\r\nresentment of her own femininity and, like so many women, has been\r\nreared to feel that the role of wife and mother is a degraded and\r\nworthless one, she can pass this attitude on to her daughter without\r\nspeaking a word. The child sees it in her mother’s reactions to her\r\nfather in everyday life, hears it in her complaints, and sometimes\r\nfeels it in the resigned and hopeless attitude with which she may face\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nWhen I emphasize this early “masculine” direction which a little girl’s\r\nvalues may be given, I do not wish to confuse the reader. There is\r\na “tomboy” stage through which many girls pass. This is a perfectly\r\nnatural phase in her development and has nothing to do with the problem\r\nunless the child holds onto her tomboyism until well after twelve\r\nyears of age. This natural emulation of little boys is really quite a\r\nfeminine gesture on the little girl’s part--she is trying to learn more\r\nabout what that wonderful opposite sex does and thinks and feels. In\r\nthis way she enters into her first friendly relationships with males\r\nother than her father.\r\n\r\nRemember that we called puberty “the chum stage.” The young girl takes\r\nto herself a bosom companion of the same sex with whom she shares\r\nher “secrets.” One of the chief dangers to arise during this part of\r\nthe growing-up process comes from this relationship, which is, of\r\ncourse, a normal one under optimum circumstances. However, if the chum\r\nselected turns out to be precocious as far as sexual experiment with\r\nthe opposite sex is concerned, the friendship can lead to harmful\r\nexperiences for the more innocent member of the duo.\r\n\r\nA girl entering puberty is often attracted to a girl a year or two\r\nolder than she is and will idealize this new friend, feeling that any\r\naction she performs is entirely fine and defensible. Neither of these\r\nchildren is, of course, ready for any truly heterosexual experience,\r\nbut the younger one may imitate the older one and attempt to follow\r\nthrough in a sexual relationship with a boy or older man. Without\r\nmentioning the possible disaster of pregnancy at this early juncture, I\r\nshould like to emphasize that sexual intercourse at this age, without\r\nthe preparatory stage of adolescence having intervened, can cause a\r\npermanent aversion for the experience. It can produce a trauma of such\r\nseverity that the young person may withdraw from the opposite sex\r\nentirely and remain withdrawn. Or it may encourage her to believe that\r\nshe has attained her majority and cause her to act out this joyless and\r\npremature experience over and over with many different members of the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that a girl is not ready for love-making until\r\nshe falls in love with a specific individual. For this to happen in\r\na meaningful manner, she must first pass through the daydream stage\r\nof adolescence. Boys do not go through this phase and, indeed, do not\r\nhave to. They are ready for intercourse at a much younger age than\r\ngirls are. Girls have much to risk in love, even if we confine our\r\nobservations to the purely biological aspects of the experience of\r\nsexual intercourse. Psychologically they must, so to speak, be sure\r\nthat it is indeed Prince Charming who leans over them. Until it is,\r\nthey must dream and sleep, for if it is a rude stranger he can shatter\r\nthe dream forever, thus rob the young girl of any chance of ever\r\nbringing her dream to fulfillment in reality.\r\n\r\nAnother danger of both puberty and adolescence is that the parents\r\nwill be overly strict, interpreting the move of the young one toward\r\nindependence as a danger to her. I have seen many cases of young girls\r\nwho might have stayed within the home until their adolescence was\r\nsafely over had it not been for the rather prurient and thick-skinned\r\nassumption of a mother or father, or both, that their early dating must\r\ninevitably be immoral. This assumption on the part of a parent can\r\nactivate a very hostile reaction on the part of a young girl. It is as\r\nif the parent were saying to her, “You will never be independent of us,\r\nnever have a life of your own. Why don’t you give up trying?” The fact\r\nthat the parents do not intend their watchfulness to imply this at\r\nall is not relevant. That’s the way the young one too often interprets\r\nit, and in a gesture of defiance she may do something that will really\r\ninjure her.\r\n\r\nEqually seriously affected, if not more so, is the young girl who\r\n_feels_ extremely rebellious but who submits to overzealous parental\r\nauthority out of fear. I have seen several girls with this problem.\r\nWhat generally happens is that they have pulled back, because of\r\nundue parental influences, from indulging the personality-enrichening\r\ndreams of adolescence. This causes them to remain on the threshold of\r\nwomanhood, lost in an emotional dependency which belongs to an earlier\r\nphase of development. By and large, the problems of such girls when\r\nthey come to womanhood tend to be more severe than those of the girls\r\nwho rebelled.\r\n\r\nIn making these observations on parental strictness I am in no way\r\nadvocating a laissez-faire attitude. Every young girl needs to feel\r\nthe force of the parents’ moral feelings; they give her guidance and a\r\nfeeling of security. She will, however, generally react more normally\r\nand healthfully if the moral attitudes are expressed and interpreted\r\nrather than laid down as ukases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the stages of development that lead to maturity in\r\nwoman and the pitfalls she may encounter on the way. With this final\r\ninformation in hand we are at last ready to look at frigidity itself.\r\nThe next section, therefore, will treat of the frigid woman herself,\r\nand I will show you, with specific cases, how the kinds and degrees\r\nof frigidity develop and what concrete problems they bring in their\r\ntrain. With such models in mind we will then be prepared to examine the\r\nconstructive steps which individuals who suffer from this problem must\r\ntake to win their freedom, to cross the bridge to womanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\n_The Fear of Love — Case Histories_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 10_\r\n\r\nTOTAL AND PARTIAL FRIGIDITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have discussed the various types of frigidity in a former\r\nchapter, I think it will be helpful now to go into the matter in\r\ngreater detail. I am going to illustrate the major types of frigidity\r\nwith case histories. In this way you can get a living picture of each\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nI think the case method of presentation is particularly helpful to a\r\nfull grasp of frigidity. Those who are caught up in the problem usually\r\nlose their objectivity about themselves, are unable to see with any\r\nreal clarity just how their actions and reactions are neurotic and just\r\nhow they are affecting those about them. The true story of another\r\nwoman who has suffered from the same affliction mirrors the problem\r\nfaithfully, allows one to achieve a clear view of herself, perhaps for\r\nthe first time. For the fact is that each kind of frigidity has its own\r\nvery distinctive characteristics and its own unique causes.\r\n\r\nBut as you read these cases I think you will be struck by the very\r\nspecial differences in each kind of frigidity, which will allow you\r\nto see your own image--to diagnose yourself, so to speak. You will\r\nsee, too, that there are certain characteristics common to all the\r\nfrigidities. Knowledge of both these facts, as you will discover, is\r\nimportant to the cure of the frigid woman.\r\n\r\nIn giving these stories I cannot, of course, include examples of all\r\nthe pitfalls that are encountered from childhood to adulthood. That\r\nwould require much more space than I have here. I will attempt, rather,\r\nto select cases of frigidity caused by experiences most common to our\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe first case, then, is one of total frigidity. This kind, as you may\r\nrecall from our earlier description of it, is one of the most severe\r\nforms of sexual disorder in women and is widely prevalent. Without\r\nfurther ado I give you the case of a woman we shall call Patricia Agnew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Patricia Agnew came to my office for her first interview, she had\r\nnot come, consciously, to consult me for a frigidity problem or to\r\ndiscuss the results of such a problem on her marriage. She came because\r\nshe was having, in her words, “another nervous breakdown.”\r\n\r\nShe was not a very good-looking woman, though she had nice teeth\r\nand large blue eyes. It was her figure that was striking. In direct\r\ncontrast to her inner attitude, her figure was round and voluptuous,\r\nalmost the American ideal of what is considered “sexy.” Her lips were\r\nfull and sensual, but she held them tightly together, which gave her a\r\ncensorious, critical, old-maidish look. She was thirty-six years old.\r\n\r\nHer “nervous breakdowns” (she persisted in using the expression,\r\nthough it was clearly inapplicable in her case), she told me, were\r\nrecurrent. She had had them for three successive years. Each of them\r\nhad started with a very marked increase in inner tension. She would\r\nfeel growingly unable to cope with the manifold social and familial\r\ndemands of her life; a great sense of inadequacy would set in gradually\r\nand she would become listless and depressed. Finally the slightest\r\ntask would seem too much and she would now start to have day-long bouts\r\nof weeping. During such periods she suffered from chronic insomnia, and\r\nwhen she was able to snatch a few hours of sleep she would often have\r\nrepetitive, nightmarish dreams in which she was pursued by criminals.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of our talks Patricia would become extremely guarded\r\nwhenever I attempted to open any discussion of a personal nature. She\r\nhad come for help with the express conviction that I, the doctor,\r\nshould find a quick and easy solution to her periods of acute anxiety:\r\ndrugs, a sea voyage, anything that did not entail looking inward,\r\ntaking responsibility for her condition. This evasiveness, this desire\r\nto find easy solutions, is characteristic of all forms of frigidity\r\nin women, but it is sometimes extremely pronounced in the type of\r\nfrigidity this patient suffered from.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Patricia developed confidence and trust in me, the real\r\nfacts gradually emerged. She had been married for ten years and had\r\ntwo children, six and eight. Her husband was socially prominent,\r\nfinancially successful, and (as I saw for myself later, when I had\r\na few discussions with him) strikingly handsome, a slender, tall,\r\ndark-haired man with a gentle and charming manner.\r\n\r\nDuring her entire marriage this patient had never had, she finally told\r\nme, “one solid hour of happiness.” From the very beginning she had\r\nquarreled with her husband, and the domestic strife, at least on her\r\npart, had become truly bitter after the birth of their first son. She\r\nhad felt that her husband was becoming increasingly cruel, selfish,\r\ndemanding, and insensitive to her needs. She had believed that he was\r\ntrying to impose his will on her in any and all situations and that it\r\nwas an absolute necessity to struggle against this domination. “I felt\r\nas if he would shatter my integrity if I didn’t put up a fight,” she\r\ntold me. “It was as though he wished to have me as a slave, nothing\r\nless; it was either he or I.”\r\n\r\nThe quarrels were generally over the most trifling matters, and though\r\nher husband almost invariably tried to make up within a few hours,\r\nshe would rebuff him, and consequently bitter feelings would often\r\nendure for a week or more at a time. These battles of will, or power\r\nstruggles, would terminate only, it became evident, when she had felt\r\nthat he had been sufficiently punished for his transgressions, though\r\nshe confessed that by the time she was ready to forgive him she had\r\noften forgotten what the original quarrel had been all about.\r\n\r\nShe felt, too (still felt and always had), that her husband was\r\nextremely critical of her and that he never really gave her full\r\napproval for anything. She believed that he did not like the way she\r\ndressed, the way she conducted herself socially, or the way she managed\r\nthe children. When I asked her just how he expressed his disapproval of\r\nher, to give me an example, she could not think of anything specific\r\nand concluded lamely: “Well, he usually praises me to my face, but I\r\ncan tell by his expression that he doesn’t mean it.”\r\n\r\nLater, in the areas she had specifically mentioned, I checked with\r\nher husband on his attitudes. He told me that he had felt at the\r\nbeginning and still felt that his wife dressed beautifully and that\r\nshe was absolutely perfect at any kind of social function. “She has a\r\nreally remarkable gift for conversation of any kind with practically\r\nany person,” he said. On the other hand, he had sometimes felt that\r\nshe tended to be too permissive with the children and that she worried\r\nabout them excessively. However, he had learned early that he could not\r\nhelp her in this matter and only prayed that the children would have\r\nno adverse effects from her tendency to pamper them. I should like to\r\nreport that, as she recovered, Patricia gradually became aware of the\r\nfact that this “critical” attitude she had ascribed to her husband was\r\nalmost entirely a product of her personal problem.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful conviction she possessed was that her husband did not\r\nreally love her. She felt that he was mainly interested in exploiting\r\nher, both for his “selfish” sexual needs and to advance his business.\r\nAt the beginning of their marriage her husband had entered his father’s\r\nengineering firm and at once had been faced with the necessity of\r\ndoing a great deal of entertaining. His wife, he soon found out, was\r\nan excellent hostess and he came to depend on her gracious parties\r\nmightily. His dependency on her collaboration she at once took for\r\nexploitation and even extended that to mean: “He doesn’t love me; he\r\nmerely finds me a convenience. Any other presentable woman would suit\r\nhim as well.” There was another twist to this irrational conviction,\r\nthough it was more hidden and did not emerge until quite late in the\r\ntreatment. Her feelings might be expressed in these words: “He didn’t\r\nsucceed on his own; I made him what he is, even if I never get the\r\ncredit for it.” Imagine, with an underlying feeling of this kind, how\r\nmuch chance for survival any tender feelings toward her husband might\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nAs the sessions continued and Mrs. Agnew gained more and more\r\nconfidence, she began to feel freer about discussing her sexual life.\r\nShe at length confessed that she had never experienced any sexual\r\npleasure in her entire life, neither before nor after her marriage.\r\nAt no point, could she recall, had she ever masturbated or attempted\r\nto do so, even in early childhood. Kissing or being stroked gave her\r\nno sensations whatsoever. From the beginning, intercourse had been\r\ndistasteful and often painful, though sometimes she took a slight\r\nsatisfaction from the obvious pleasure her husband obtained from orgasm.\r\n\r\nThe actual sexual life of this couple had been at a virtual standstill\r\nfor nearly eight years. Intercourse occurred, at most, at three-month\r\nintervals. It was never spontaneous. The husband was required to make\r\nan appointment for a “date” several days before actual intercourse. His\r\nwife would acquiesce to such a tryst only after she had refused him\r\nseveral times and had accumulated a great deal of guilt for so doing.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment she made the appointment she would become anxious,\r\nand this would increase to the point where she was filled with\r\nactual dread. Often she would be forced to break the appointment and\r\npostpone it. As the time for the intercourse approached she would also\r\nexperience feelings of rage, repeat to herself over and over, “Why\r\n_must_ I, why _must_ I?” In preparing for the act itself (putting her\r\ndiaphragm in, inserting the jelly), she would linger for as much as an\r\nhour while her husband waited. She often found that her vaginal muscles\r\ncontracted to such a degree that the insertion of the diaphragm was\r\npainful and difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\nWith her misery increasing momently, she went, after these\r\npreparations, to the marital bed as one might to the executioner. Her\r\nhusband’s looks repelled her now; his nakedness seemed disgusting and\r\noffensive. She saw him as “skinny, white, and ugly, with an enormous\r\npenis. It was as if he were nothing but a big disgusting sexual organ.”\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that she could feel no tenderness or warmth--she\r\ncould not even simulate it. She remained totally passive throughout\r\nthe entire act, which her husband, in response to her rejection (as\r\nshe later, in happier times, learned), hurried through as quickly as\r\npossible. It is interesting to note that, despite her own inability to\r\nrespond, one of her bitterest complaints about her husband was that\r\nhis love-making was mechanical, hasty, and that he never showed any\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nIt had never occurred to her, of course, that he might be reacting\r\nto her clear aversion to the whole process. Indeed, she saw no\r\njustification for his shamefaced approach to her until she was well\r\non the road to sexual health. It is usual in such cases for the\r\nwife to blame the husband for her failures, no matter how glaringly\r\nunreasonable and untrue her accusation may be.\r\n\r\nAfter intercourse she was always depressed. She felt “dirty and used.”\r\nHer husband’s semen appeared to her to be disgusting. “All I wanted was\r\nto get to sleep fast and to forget the whole episode until the next\r\nordeal became necessary,” she said.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is difficult to understand how a marriage\r\ncould exist at all. However, such marriages do exist in great numbers,\r\nand by far the majority of them do not end up in the divorce courts,\r\nas one might expect. Despite the bitter complainings, the struggle for\r\npower, the fear of love, and the dread of sex on the wife’s part, I\r\nhave found that there is usually a well-hidden but genuine bond of love\r\nbetween the couple. The husband seems originally to have seen in his\r\nnow quarrelsome partner a part that can be truly loving, truly warm. It\r\nmay show dimly and only in the interstices of the relationship, but it\r\nkeeps hope alive in him that she will come into her true self one day;\r\nhe warms himself as best he can, meanwhile, at her meager fires.\r\n\r\nBut now that we have seen a picture of the totally frigid woman let us\r\nexamine the causes for it. I have stated that every kind of frigidity\r\nhas its special cause. What was the cause in Patricia Agnew’s case?\r\n\r\nTo understand the origins of her problem, we will have to explore her\r\nearliest history, particularly her relationship to her mother and\r\nfather. She was an only child, and her father was clearly the dominant\r\nfigure in the household. He was an extremely successful and lovable\r\nman. He abounded in all the virtues, was infinitely patient and loving\r\nwith his little daughter. She told me that from her earliest times\r\nshe considered him, physically speaking, “an enormously beautiful\r\nman,” and in describing him she lingered lovingly over the details of\r\nhis appearance--his “sculptured head,” “wonderful deep kindly eyes,”\r\n“marvelously athletic figure.” A psychiatrist, of course, would pay\r\nvery close attention to such an ecstatic description, coming as it did\r\nfrom such an otherwise withdrawn person.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast she had considered her mother “mousy” and, while she\r\nhad liked her in a general sense, she had never consciously had any\r\nvery strong positive feelings about her.\r\n\r\nPatricia clearly had been a “daddy’s girl.” There is nothing wrong, of\r\ncourse, with this under normal circumstances; had she grown up to be\r\nsexually free and had she been able to transfer her early love feelings\r\nfrom her father to other men, this early attachment to the father would\r\nhave been merely a phase in normal development.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to depict the stages by which Patricia and I\r\narrived at a clear understanding of the early problem that had caused\r\nher later frigidity. It will be enough to state the events themselves.\r\n\r\nYou will recall the fact that in the first five years of life the\r\nchild is a very sensual little being. Patricia had been no exception\r\nin the beginning; she had transferred these feelings, in the normal\r\ncourse of events, to her father. However, this powerful and charming\r\nman whose personality dominated the household, overshadowing his wife\r\ncompletely, had been far too responsive (unwittingly, of course) to\r\nthe little girl’s erotic feelings. He dandled her and played with her\r\nendlessly, surrounded her with a stimulating warmth, psychologically\r\nand physically; he showered kisses and hugs, compliments and candy\r\nupon her; he gave her anything and everything to express his devotion\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe consequence? The very strength of his love, its varied and\r\naggressive forms, its unrelenting intensity, had a negative effect on\r\nthe child. To put it most simply, his love overstimulated her budding\r\nsexuality. This powerful man’s love overwhelmed her. Her small ego\r\ncould not handle such powerful feelings; they frightened her. In order\r\nto cope with such feelings, therefore, she had had to repress them\r\npowerfully, deny their existence.\r\n\r\nChildren can do this, as you will remember from our discussion of the\r\nlatency period of childhood. It is at the onset of this period, which\r\noccurs at about six years of age, that infantile sexuality is pushed\r\nunder ground, to remain dormant until puberty. Patricia, under the\r\ninfluence of her prematurely strong sexual response to her father, had\r\nbeen forced to enter her latency period, we were able to determine, at\r\nthe far too early age of four.\r\n\r\nWith sex out of the way, she was now able to indulge her worship of her\r\nfather in complete “innocence.” He was a man who believed passionately\r\nin success, and his ebullience, love of life, and high intelligence had\r\nwon him a great deal of it. His young daughter felt now that to win his\r\nlove she must achieve and achieve, endlessly. From the first grade of\r\nschool through her last year at college, therefore, she bent all her\r\nefforts to excelling mentally. But her father was also a perfectionist;\r\nhe expected top honors from himself and jeered at anything less in\r\nhimself. Thoughtlessly he made the same demands on his daughter. Since\r\nshe did not have his qualifications she was not always able to come up\r\nto his standards in every field of endeavor; few _could_ have equaled\r\nhis demands. When she did not achieve such top honors she felt that she\r\nwas not worthy of her father’s love and indeed that he did not love\r\nher. He did nothing to correct this feeling.\r\n\r\nIf you will recall our normal stages of development for the growing\r\nchild, you will easily see that when marriage time came around Patricia\r\nAgnew had not touched first, second, or third base. She had appeared to\r\nbe growing normally, excelling in schoolwork, playing the role of the\r\ndutiful daughter, going out on dates. But in the emotional and sexual\r\nspheres she had been arrested at a very early stage.\r\n\r\nSo severe had been her repression of her childhood sexuality that\r\nwhen the glandular changes which usher in puberty occurred she failed\r\nto have the resurgence of sexual feeling and the development of\r\npsychological characteristics normal for that period. For that reason\r\nshe omitted her adolescent phase of development, too, the period of\r\nyoung love’s long and lovely dream which prepares the girl for the\r\nactivities of love sexually and psychologically. How could she have\r\nhad such a dream? It depends on the development of a true and normal\r\nsexuality. The door had been locked on her sexuality in infancy and the\r\nkey thrown away.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, too, she was an infant. The need to excel, to master\r\none’s environment is of course normal for the latency period. Nature\r\nhas arranged this period, sagely put sex out of the way for a few years\r\nso that the ego may have a chance to grow, to prepare itself for the\r\nsexual storms and stresses of puberty and adolescence.\r\n\r\nHowever, since in a very real sense she could not pass through puberty\r\nand adolescence, she had remained psychologically in the latency\r\nperiod, the non-sexual, competitive, father-worshiping childhood period.\r\n\r\nPatricia really had two distinct attitudes toward her husband. The\r\nfirst was expressed in her quarrelsomeness, her belief that he was\r\nselfish, unattractive, and unlovable. This attitude was based on the\r\nfact that, very literally, her heart still belonged to Daddy. With\r\nher exaggerated childhood feelings toward her father, every other man\r\nsuffered by comparison, seemed unworthy of her love. Her husband was an\r\ninterloper who came between her and her ideal. Therefore, his normal\r\nneed for her to love him, to be a good wife to him, seemed hateful to\r\nher, filled her with rage. Sex under such circumstances was a virtual\r\nrape of Lucrece, with the husband playing the role of the dark and\r\nfrightening rapist, the father representing her true love, for whom she\r\nmust preserve her innocence and purity.\r\n\r\nAnother deeper and more hidden attitude was the exact opposite of this,\r\nindeed contradictory to it. In this aspect of her mind her husband\r\nstood for her father. Thus sexual feelings toward such a person must\r\nbe entirely taboo; she must repress them as she had in her earliest\r\nyears and she must keep them repressed. Too, she must excel in all\r\nthe things her father wanted her to excel in. To her husband she must\r\nprimarily excel in her wifely functions, and this was the essential\r\ntrap. For because she very consciously knew she was not and under the\r\ncircumstances could not be even a passable wife, she was constantly\r\ninundated by feelings of inadequacy and inferiority.\r\n\r\nYou can see then what a complete trap Patricia was in. Actually, unless\r\nshe had been strongly motivated to seek help, she would never have\r\nfound an exit from her difficulties. Her periodic “breakdowns” were\r\na simple and direct expression of the hopelessness of her situation.\r\nIt was as if she were saying: “I am truly a helpless child; I can do\r\nnothing grown-up. I must be taken care of as a child is.”\r\n\r\nShe did recover her lost sexuality and her lost capacity for happiness,\r\nand in a later chapter we shall see how the Patricia Agnews of this\r\nlife can achieve such an outcome. But before we leave her I should like\r\nto make one further observation of a general kind: Consider how totally\r\nbeyond any help she would have been if her irrational opposition\r\nto her husband, to sex, and to real love between the sexes had been\r\nbolstered up, made to seem quite justifiable by a philosophy of life\r\nbased on the feminist school of thought. From such a standpoint every\r\none of her difficulties would have been considered perfectly normal!\r\n\r\nPatricia, of course, represents frigidity in its most extreme form,\r\nthe type in which there is almost a total lack of sexual feeling.\r\nTo clarify this subject, recall our frigidity scale. On this scale\r\ntotal frigidity would needle around zero. A woman at the opposite\r\nend of this scale would experience a great deal of sexual excitement\r\nbefore and during intercourse but would be unable to have orgasm, or\r\nher orgasm would be so weak and unsatisfying that it would leave her\r\nvery consciously unsatisfied. (Normalcy, of course, is a more or less\r\nabsolute state and could not be described in terms of degrees.) We rate\r\nher near or at 100 on the frigidity scale, meaning she is close to\r\nnormalcy. In between these two extremes there is every possible degree\r\nof sexual blocking.\r\n\r\nWomen who suffer from some degree of frigidity (rather than from a type\r\nof frigidity, such as our “masculine type”) have personality problems\r\nsimilar to Patricia’s. These problems become milder as they go up the\r\nscale toward normalcy. The underlying structure of their problem is\r\nalso similar to Patricia’s--it is based on a too strong and too early\r\nattachment to their fathers. This early attachment has survived into\r\nadulthood and, depending largely on its original strength, causes\r\na greater or lesser degree of sexual and interpersonal problems in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nBut as we go up the scale toward greater sexual responsiveness the\r\ndifference in degree seems almost to become a difference in kind.\r\nFrom roughly the middle of the scale upward, the essential sexual\r\nproblem has little to do with withdrawnness or unbridled or unrelenting\r\nhostility toward one’s mate, or a feeling of being exploited sexually.\r\nIt is far more closely connected with direct sexual frustration, with a\r\nkind of Tantalus-like feeling that one is terribly close to one’s goal\r\nbut cannot quite achieve it.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what I mean. I shall call this patient Joan. She\r\nwas twenty-eight years old when she came to me, a pretty woman with an\r\nupturned nose, a generally insouciant manner, and a pleased-with-life\r\nsmile. She had been married two years, she told me, and came directly\r\nto her problem. During intercourse she would become tremendously\r\nexcited most of the time. It took little to stimulate her, and as the\r\nintercourse continued she would maintain her high level of excitement.\r\nBut on most occasions, no matter how long the love-making continued,\r\nshe would reach no climax at all. She was left with a frustrated,\r\nalmost frantic feeling.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, occasional exceptions to this rule. In about\r\none out of ten times Joan would achieve a climax of sorts during\r\nlove-making. But it was weak and inconclusive and not by any means\r\ndeeply satisfying to her, as it should have been and as she felt it\r\ncould be. Here, however, is the most important point. Whenever she did\r\nexperience this climax she almost invariably woke the next morning\r\nwith severe back pains which lasted for two or three days and were\r\nclearly psychosomatic. And she would feel irritable and anxious. It was\r\n_only_ on such days that she experienced personal difficulties with her\r\nhusband. She would find herself arguing with him about trifles, being\r\ngenerally cross-grained and countersuggestible.\r\n\r\n“I should think,” she said to me in puzzlement, “that it would be just\r\nthe other way around; that I would be difficult with him when I didn’t\r\ncome to any climax and pleased and hopeful when I did, even if it\r\nwasn’t the perfect orgasm.”\r\n\r\nBut Joan was being merely logical in this assumption. The mind is not\r\nnecessarily run by such rational considerations. When she was able to\r\ncomprehend the reasons behind the apparent anomaly of her backaches and\r\nher anxiety reactions, she was close to being cured.\r\n\r\nJoan’s problem was a truly mild one. Her relationship with her husband\r\nwas basically as sound as a dollar; she thought him attractive\r\nphysically and respected him. She enjoyed their social life together\r\nand never felt exploited or put upon when he had to entertain his\r\nbusiness associates. Indeed, she had a great deal of fun playing the\r\nrole of hostess to them. There was no area where one could find real\r\ndifficulty between Joan and her husband except in their sexual life.\r\n\r\nThis problem washed out very quickly, for it was lightly held in\r\nthe soil of Joan’s personality. And yet in exploring it we found it\r\nhad exactly the same structure as Patricia Agnew’s problem: a basic\r\noverattachment to her father that had occurred in early childhood\r\nand had not been resolved. The difference was that the attachment\r\non Joan’s part had been a much milder one than Patricia’s had been,\r\nand therefore, while it did have a lingering aftereffect, it did not\r\nencompass Joan’s entire personality and was therefore far easier to\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\nThere were two things that made Joan’s relationship with her father\r\nless destructive than Patricia’s had been. First, Joan’s father was\r\nnot _so_ overpoweringly loving and attentive to the little girl during\r\nthe first six years of her growth. Second, Joan’s mother had a very\r\ndistinctive and strong personality of her own, and Joan had had a good\r\nrelationship with her all during her formative years. This neutralized\r\nto a certain extent the overstimulating effect of her father. It had\r\nallowed her to identify with her own sex in a healthy manner, to give\r\nher the feeling that it was a fine thing to be a sweetheart, wife, and\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nJoan’s frigidity problem was helped in a few sessions. One day she came\r\nto me and was very upset. Her last intercourse had been successful and\r\nhad culminated in the strongest orgasm she had had up to this time. But\r\nas usual, the next day had been an anxious one and she had had a severe\r\nbackache.\r\n\r\nAs she talked about it she suddenly said: “I had the most amazing\r\ndream; I’ve just recalled it.” She had been on a swing in a playground,\r\nshe told me, and her father had been pushing her. “I flew higher and\r\nhigher,” she said. “It was like flying. The sensations were delicious.\r\nI hoped he would never stop. Then suddenly I looked around and he had\r\nturned into some kind of criminal or something. He seized me and I\r\nscreamed, but somehow I knew nobody could hear me. I then suddenly\r\nremembered something a girl friend had actually told me in college when\r\na group of us were discussing rape. She had said that a woman might be\r\nkilled if she resisted. And she said that if it ever happened to her\r\nshe would just relax and try to enjoy it. I recalled this now, and the\r\ncriminal in my dream did rape me and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I came to\r\na terrific climax, a kind I’ve never had in real life.”\r\n\r\nShe had awakened at this point but then went back to sleep and had\r\nthe following nightmare. “Women policemen were pursuing me for having\r\ncommitted some crime,” she said. “They’d almost catch me, but I’d get\r\naway. Finally one of them did catch me, but when I looked in her face\r\nshe was smiling at me tenderly and she said: ‘Don’t worry; it’s not so\r\nterrible after all.’”\r\n\r\nKnowing what you know already, it should not be too hard to see what\r\nJoan’s dream means. The swinging, with her father doing the pushing,\r\nrepresented her very early sexual feelings toward her father. When\r\nthese became too direct she disguised them by turning her father into\r\nthe criminal rapist. Actually _she_ was the one who felt like the\r\ncriminal, and this is borne out by the fact that in the following\r\ndream she was pursued by the police. It is significant that they were\r\npolicewomen, for the little girl feels very strong guilt toward her\r\nmother because of the forbidden and taboo sex feelings toward her\r\nfather. The forgiving attitude of the policewoman represented both her\r\ngood relationship with her mother and her inner readiness to get over\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nThere could scarcely be a better illustration of the whole theory of\r\nmodern psychoanalysis than this. To Joan, at least, it was eminently\r\nclear. Her terror, expressed by her dream of the pursuing policewomen,\r\ndisappeared before that session was over, and she stood ready to move\r\ninto a mature and satisfying sexuality with her husband. With her\r\nconscious mind she now knew that she had been frightened of complete\r\nsexual love because, in the highest reaches of passion, her feelings\r\nfor her husband unconsciously reminded her of the “dangerous” feelings\r\nshe bad once felt for her father; thus she dared not indulge them to\r\nthe utmost. Understanding the irrational basis of her fears allowed her\r\nto dispense with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 11_\r\n\r\nTHE MASCULINE WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was a strikingly handsome woman. I looked at her as she sat\r\nopposite me in my office and I remember being struck by the extreme\r\nfemininity of her appearance: the glossy, clean softness of her brown\r\nhair, the peaches-and-cream texture of her complexion, the care she had\r\ngiven her toilette and her clothes. Everything was perfect. I recall I\r\nthought then: “Perhaps a little too perfect. It’s almost as if she is\r\ndressing for a role.”\r\n\r\nFirst impressions are not always correct, but in this case mine were.\r\nMy new patient, whom I shall call Toni (her real nickname was also\r\nbased on a boy’s name) was suffering from the form of frigidity that\r\nis often called the “masculinity complex.” She was, in short, the\r\n“clitoridal woman,” whose general characteristics we looked at briefly\r\nbefore. Her case is so typical and illustrates so many aspects of this\r\nvery widespread type of frigidity that I have selected it to tell here.\r\n\r\nIn my first sessions with her I could see that Toni’s clear thinking\r\nand logical mind, her emotionless, almost masculine forthrightness in\r\nexpressing herself belied her softly feminine appearance. Her way of\r\ndressing was an unconscious attempt to hide from the world, and from\r\nherself, her real problem.\r\n\r\nShe was thirty years old, had been married for seven years, and had a\r\nfive-year-old son. For the past two years she had had severe migraine\r\nheadaches, sometimes as often as three times a week. These headaches\r\nhad started at about the same time that serious marriage difficulties\r\nhad developed between herself and her husband. The problem, she stated\r\nhonestly, had originated with her. Rather quickly she seemed to have\r\nlost all respect for her husband. Looking at him one day, she said, she\r\nsuddenly saw that he had no ambition of any kind and was “insufferably\r\nsmug and complacent.” He had not the slightest desire to better his\r\nlot, she realized, but was content to putter around in his cellar\r\nworkshop with “inane and useless projects” or to spend his evenings\r\n“glued to the television set” or playing poker with a few “useless men.”\r\n\r\nThis passivity on the part of her husband had inexplicably enraged her.\r\n“I realized in that moment that we could rot, socially and financially,\r\nif it were up to him,” she told me bitterly. “I can’t stand such\r\npointlessness in a man.”\r\n\r\nI now asked her what their social life together had been like, and she\r\ntold me that it had been very active until two years before. “Most of\r\nour friends were my friends originally. His friends just seemed to fall\r\naway in the first year of our marriage. They weren’t very interesting\r\nanyhow, and I was just as glad. But after I began to lose interest in\r\nmy husband, to lose my respect for him, I began to withdraw socially\r\nmyself. My husband didn’t seem to care about that either. He doesn’t\r\nseem to care about anything.”\r\n\r\nFurther inquiry elicited the fact that Toni was extremely successful\r\nin the business world. She had been through a leading woman’s college\r\nand had been the president of her class and very prominent in\r\nextracurricular activities. “I was a really Big Woman On Campus,”\r\nshe said nostalgically. She had then gone to graduate school, taking\r\nher degree at Columbia University in business administration, and on\r\ngraduation had entered the buying department of one of the largest\r\nmerchandising corporations in America.\r\n\r\nWithin five years Toni had become the top buyer of women’s clothes for\r\nthe entire corporation. In actuality this was one of the top positions\r\nof this kind in the United States, for the merchandising corporation\r\nwas gigantic. Her present salary exceeded twenty-five thousand dollars\r\na year.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised to learn, at this point, that this was exactly\r\nthree times the salary her husband made as a junior member of a law\r\nfirm that specialized in corporation law.\r\n\r\nI now asked Toni if she did not get a great deal of pleasure from her\r\nsuccess in the business world. She told me that before she was married\r\nand for about two years afterward she had indeed felt a great deal of\r\npride in her success. Her husband, too, had shared her pleasure in her\r\nachievements. After the baby had come, however, he had seemed gradually\r\nto lose interest in her work. And gradually, too, she had developed a\r\ngrowing sense of guilt about her activities in the business world. She\r\nhad the constant feeling that she was neglecting her child. Sometimes\r\nshe would call the nurse at home five or six times a day to find out if\r\nthe baby was all right. “Two months ago,” she told me, “I went in to\r\nsee my boss. I told him I wanted to leave or to cut down to a part-time\r\njob. He was terribly upset and at once offered me a large increase and\r\ngave me a big talk on how important I was and how much they needed me.\r\nOne part of me was flattered enormously, but after I left him I felt\r\ndepressed. I felt as though I were failing my child terribly, but I\r\nfelt trapped by the amount of money I had been offered. I also felt\r\nthat if I should really give it all up I would quickly become bored at\r\njust staying home.”\r\n\r\nEverything Toni had said up to this point fitted the classical picture\r\nof the clitoridal woman. Almost invariably they marry a passive and\r\nrather dependent (though often very attractive and charming) man and\r\nfinally become bitterly critical of his dependency and lack of drive,\r\nthus upsetting the equilibrium of the marriage. In their mind’s eye\r\nthey wish for a more aggressive male who would dominate them, but\r\nthis is pure fantasy, for they would not be able to stand real male\r\nassertiveness and, indeed, take it very poorly when their passive male\r\ndoes assert himself. Such women, too, are often very successful in the\r\nworld of masculine achievement. And if they have children they develop\r\ngreat guilt about neglecting them.\r\n\r\nOne further characteristic that Toni had was a tremendous anxiety\r\nabout childbirth. Her pregnancy had been characterized by a very deep\r\ndepression; she had suffered physically for the entire nine months and,\r\nwhen the time for delivery arrived, had felt “absolutely certain that I\r\nwas going to die.”\r\n\r\nKnowing all this, a psychiatrist could almost guess the nature of\r\nToni’s sexual life. It did not come out in our interviews for some\r\ntime, and I did not press for the details. However, when the facts did\r\nemerge at length they portrayed the particular type of sexual response\r\nwhich characterizes the clitoridal woman and has caused endless and\r\nill-informed speculation in various quarters. The fact that this\r\nform of frigidity is so widespread in our society has actually given\r\nrise to a group which believes that the clitoridal woman’s form of\r\nsexual gratification is perfectly normal. This group is vociferous and\r\nmuch-published and, in my opinion at least, can do incalculable harm if\r\nits conclusions should reach wide acceptance.\r\n\r\nToni was what we call “clitorally centered,” though she did have some\r\ngeneral reactions to kissing and other forms of foreplay. For example,\r\nshe enjoyed having her back rubbed and she received a rather minor\r\npleasure if her husband manipulated her labia. But she definitely\r\npreferred that the foreplay be confined to her clitoris. If her husband\r\nstroked her labia for more than a few seconds, the sensations became\r\nrather uncomfortable and she would ask him to stop.\r\n\r\nOrgasm was almost invariably confined to the clitoris. During such\r\norgasm, though her vagina sometimes became lubricated, she felt no\r\npleasurable sensations there at all. At the point of orgasm she could\r\nfeel no vaginal contractions nor any desire to have her husband thrust\r\nhis penis ever deeper or more rapidly inside her, as is characteristic\r\nof the normal orgasm in women.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, she generally preferred to be masturbated manually\r\nrather than to have sexual intercourse. Often, to avoid intercourse,\r\nshe would masturbate her husband. Or, when they did have sexual\r\nintercourse, her husband would generally masturbate Toni afterward.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was occasionally able to have a clitoral orgasm during\r\nintercourse. This always was achieved when she took the position on top\r\nand her husband was on the bottom. She was very circumstantial in her\r\nexplanation of why she could achieve orgasm in this position, pointing\r\nout to me at some length that her clitoris could come into more direct\r\ncontact with his penis in this position. There may be some truth in\r\nthis fact, but what was of more interest to me was the extent to which\r\nshe went to make her point clear. I have often found that women with\r\nthis type of problem are, in the beginning at any rate, very anxious to\r\navoid any suggestion that they may be enjoying the position because in\r\nour society it is the traditional male position in intercourse.\r\n\r\nJust as she took the lead in financial and social matters in the family\r\nso did Toni take the lead in sexual matters. It was she who almost\r\ninvariably initiated every intercourse. She explained this fact to me\r\nby saying that her husband was very insensitive to her sensual moods.\r\n“He just doesn’t seem to pick up any cues that I throw out,” she said,\r\n“so I have to go after him when I feel passionate.” Please note that\r\nthis, too, is a reversal of the usual pattern in sexual love between\r\nmen and women in our society; the woman will sometimes initiate sex,\r\nbut it is usually the man who does so.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, too, to note that although the personal relationship\r\nbetween Toni and her husband had deteriorated badly in the two years\r\nbefore she came to me there had been no diminution in the amount of\r\nsex they had. Since Toni was the initiator of sex, the one who, so to\r\nspeak, set the sexual pace of the relationship, it would indicate that\r\nshe had split off her sexual feelings from other emotions. Unlike most\r\nwomen, she could have sex with a person toward whom, at least during\r\nthis period, she felt no conscious feelings of love.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I possibly could, without upsetting her, I began to focus my\r\ndiscussions with Toni on the period two years before, when she began to\r\ndevelop feelings of anger toward her husband.\r\n\r\nAt first our discussions yielded nothing, though I had emphasized\r\nto Toni the importance of reconstructing all the details of life at\r\nthat juncture as minutely as possible. At length she brought up the\r\nimportant factor. Two days before the sudden onset of her intensely\r\ncritical feelings toward her husband she had, for the first time in her\r\nlife, pleasurable vaginal sensations during intercourse.\r\n\r\nShe had felt very warmly toward her husband that night; an unaccustomed\r\ntenderness had filled her whole being before the love-making. They\r\nhad had no preliminary love play of the usual manual kind, starting\r\nintercourse almost at once. The vaginal sensations had begun halfway\r\nthrough the intercourse and had been maintained right up to the point\r\nof orgasm, when her clitoral sensations once more took over. She\r\nrecalled that afterward she had been surprised and quite pleased but\r\nhad soon “forgotten” the whole experience.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that Toni’s anger at her husband and her\r\nmigraines started right after this sexual experience. And there could\r\nbe no doubt that they were intimately related experiences. Though her\r\npersonality structure and the psychological events which caused her\r\nkind of frigidity were different from Patricia’s and from Joan’s, they\r\nwere alike in one regard. All three had the deepest and most abiding\r\nfear of real vaginal sensation and ultimately, of course, of vaginal\r\norgasm.\r\n\r\nThis fear is a profound one in the clitoridal or masculine woman. Toni,\r\nrather than admit to herself how frightened she was of this vaginal\r\nexperience, chose unconsciously to ruin her personal relationship with\r\nher husband, to denigrate all those characteristics which she had\r\nformerly loved in him--his charm, his ability to relax, his quiet and\r\nwarm understanding, his refusal to be driven by circumstances, and\r\nhis insistence on enjoying the small, warm, everyday events of life.\r\nTo protect herself from knowing the real nature of her problem, she\r\nhad to blame him for her difficulties. She even had to make up the\r\ndifficulties, for though he was a rather passive man he was also a very\r\nattractive and loving one.\r\n\r\nThe vagina is the very center of femininity, of female love, as we have\r\nseen. If the individual fears this love, she learns unconsciously to\r\nblock vaginal sensations. If, however, at any point in her life she is\r\nbeguiled into feeling sensation there, she will have a severe anxiety\r\nreaction, flee from the experience in any way she can. And this brings\r\nus to the psychological structure of this kind of problem.\r\n\r\nThe clitoridal woman develops, very early, an underlying denial that\r\nshe is indeed feminine or that she has any use for the things of\r\nwomanhood. She learns to feel that womanhood is dangerous, a slavish\r\nand humiliating role. Only men are powerful and secure; and thus she\r\nidentifies herself with the male exclusively.\r\n\r\nIf you will recall that, sexual anatomy aside, there is little to\r\ndistinguish boys from girls either psychologically or glandularly in\r\nthe first ten years of existence, you will get some indication that\r\nthe desire to be a boy need not seem so impossible of fulfillment to a\r\nlittle girl. And even if we take her sexual anatomy into consideration,\r\nthe idea does not seem farfetched to her. She does have a clitoris,\r\nwhich, in her wishful psychology, she can consider a penis, or at least\r\nthe beginnings of one. Though it is small it is, in medical parlance,\r\n“the homologue of the penis.” It can become erect; it has a head; it\r\nhas a prepuce. Girls who are going to pursue (albeit unconsciously)\r\ntheir daydreams of becoming male, eschewing femininity, pay a great\r\ndeal of very minute attention to these similarities.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case with Toni. Typically for such cases, her father had\r\nrejected her. During the stage of development when a young daughter\r\nneeds a sufficient quota of her father’s love and tenderness to give\r\nher an experience of the rewards of womanhood, a substrate of feminine\r\nsecurity, he simply ignored her. He was, by all accounts, a very cold\r\nman, engrossed in his business and quite indifferent to both his wife\r\nand daughter. The concept that men rejected women, were actively\r\nhostile to them, was very much deepened in Toni by the fact that her\r\nfather behaved in exactly an opposite manner to her brother, who was\r\nthree years younger. This young fellow received, by all accounts, the\r\nlion’s share of her father’s small store of attention and devotion.\r\n\r\nReports from a patient, while they have a certain reliability, cannot\r\nalways be depended on completely. In Toni’s case I was fortunate to be\r\nable to check the veracity of her story. She had maintained a close\r\nrelationship with her brother after they had grown up and, on Toni’s\r\ninsistence, I saw him. If anything, Toni had understated the degree\r\nof her father’s withdrawn relationship to her and her mother. Even\r\nat that, the damage to Toni’s ability to love might not have been\r\ndecisive had her mother been a warm and feminine woman. But here, too,\r\ncircumstances militated against the little girl. Her mother (perhaps as\r\na reaction against her husband’s personality but more likely because\r\nshe, too, was essentially a masculinized woman) refused to stay home\r\nwith the children after her son had achieved the age of three. She had\r\nopened a dress shop with a friend in the business section of Toni’s\r\nhome town which had been very successful, demanding all her time. It\r\nwas a rare evening when Toni’s mother got home for dinner. Between the\r\nages of seven and fourteen the girl saw her mother little more than an\r\nhour a day on weekdays and half a day on Sundays.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to see then that Toni’s young world had little in it\r\nthat supported feminine values. It was clear to her that only male\r\nactivities, achievement in terms of male goals, could bring security.\r\nEven her mother seemed to subscribe to this, for hadn’t she gone back\r\ninto the world of male activity as soon as she could manage it? Indeed,\r\njudging the matter by her father’s relationship to her brother, she\r\nvery early reached the literal conclusion that in order to achieve love\r\na woman really had to be a man.\r\n\r\nIf we were to examine the purely sexual side of Toni’s unconscious\r\nidentification with the male sex, we would only have to examine\r\nthe dreams she brought to our sessions. At the beginning she would\r\nfrequently have dreams in which she was dressed as a man or in which\r\nshe was excelling in male sports. I have recorded one incredible dream,\r\nreally quite a funny one in a sense were it not so basically pathetic,\r\nin which she played quarterback for Harvard in the annual Yale-Harvard\r\nfootball game. In my notes taken at the time I wrote that she made four\r\ntouchdowns!\r\n\r\nIn her conscious mind Toni could not recall whether in her childhood\r\nshe actually believed she might turn into a boy. More disturbed women\r\nthan she often do remember such conscious fantasies in girlhood.\r\nHowever, on a deeper level there is little doubt that Toni treasured\r\nthe possibility of such a metamorphosis. As time wore on, of course,\r\nreality and her own good intelligence modified and disguised her wish.\r\nShe repressed the desire to be a boy in a physically external way,\r\nby growing a literal penis. And she substituted for this concrete\r\nidea fantasies of achievement in, to her, the male sense. In high\r\nschool and college she threw herself into a world of intellectual and\r\nextracurricular activity and made an astonishing, almost legendary,\r\nrecord for herself. In the college she attended she became not only\r\nthe president of her class but the editor of the school newspaper and\r\npresident of the college’s century-old literary society.\r\n\r\nSexually Toni did not abandon clitoral masturbation in adolescence as,\r\nunder normal circumstances, a girl would, or at least would attempt\r\nto. She clung to this early form of sexual release with almost grim\r\ndetermination, masturbating daily at least once. This continuation of\r\nclitoral masturbation long after the time when it is normally given up\r\nwas, of course, the sexual sequel to her early rejection of all that\r\nwas feminine.\r\n\r\nAt this point one might be willing to grant that Toni had sufficient\r\nreason to embrace masculine values but wonder just why she should\r\ndevelop such a strong rejection of her feminine side, such a fear of\r\nit. The question becomes more urgent when we learn that Toni’s sex\r\ninstruction was handled in an apparently intelligent manner by her\r\nmother. Sex, menstruation, pregnancy, and other related matters were\r\nexplained to her calmly and clearly and at just the right times to\r\nsatisfy her normal curiosity.\r\n\r\nShe had no shocking experience, nobody seduced her; nothing whatsoever\r\nthat was visibly untoward had happened to her.\r\n\r\nMany girls can be turned against sexuality by experiences that are\r\ndirectly traumatic. Such experiences, however, are not an absolute\r\nprerequisite for later difficulties. If you will recall our earlier\r\ndiscussion, you will remember that to embrace the feminine role a woman\r\nmust be willing in the deepest biological and psychological sense to\r\nsuspend the natural law of self-preservation. She must be willing to\r\nsacrifice her time, her being, her other goals--her very life--to give\r\nbirth to her children and to see them safely to maturity.\r\n\r\nIf in her formative years the young girl is not properly prepared for\r\nthis role, if womanhood is not treated as desirable, honorable, and\r\nlovable, she will automatically turn against it. The game, to the\r\nyoung mind, will seem far too risky for the candle. As the years pass,\r\nnothing disproves this contention and the original childlike fears,\r\nunmodified by reality, remain intact or even increase.\r\n\r\nIn other words, to the improperly prepared child, facing the reality\r\nof being a woman is in itself traumatic. Such was the case with Toni.\r\nShe was convinced that real love, full of giving and willing sacrifice,\r\nrepresented death. It is no wonder then that two years before she saw\r\nme, when she had come to the verge of experiencing something like true\r\nsexual pleasure with her husband, she turned against it in a panic,\r\nbarred it from her consciousness, attempted to render unlovable the man\r\nwho had dared to rouse such dangerous feelings in her.\r\n\r\nIn telling of Toni’s story I have selected a rather pure type of\r\nclitoridal woman, but I should like to make clear that not all cases\r\nshow such an obvious masculinization. Nor am I making the point that\r\nthe woman who succeeds in the market place is necessarily dominated by\r\nmasculine motives. A woman can be a stay-at-home, apparently performing\r\nall her duties as a wife and mother, and still be suffering from the\r\nsame kind of basic problem that confronted Toni. Perhaps we can put it\r\nthis way: many women of this kind have never learned to imitate men as\r\nsuccessfully as Toni did.\r\n\r\nHelene Deutsch has said, “ … the masculinity complex is characterized\r\nby the predominance of active and aggressive tendencies that lead\r\nto conflict with the woman’s environment and above all with the\r\nremaining feminine inner world … in its most primitive manifestation,\r\nmasculinity appears as the direct enemy of feminine tendencies,\r\ndisturbing their function.”\r\n\r\nToni certainly fitted this description. However, she like many other\r\nwomen with this kind of problem, was finally able to overcome her fear\r\nand envy of the male and to embrace her feminine nature without fear or\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC FRIGIDITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of sexual promiscuity in women suffering from frigidity\r\nis a common one. Speaking in very general terms, it can be said to\r\nemanate from a desire to be sexually awakened. Women who seek a\r\nsolution of this type feel that the next man will somehow break through\r\nthe barrier that separates them from true sexual satisfaction, true\r\nrelatedness, restore them to their erotic birthright. They are doomed\r\nto disappointment, of course, for an exterior solution of any permanent\r\nkind to this interior problem does not exist.\r\n\r\nThere is one form of promiscuity, however, that does not fit this\r\nabove description. Basically it is not a search for the beloved but\r\nrather a deep, characterological tendency, closely allied to a curious\r\nand seemingly contradictory form of frigidity. The kind of woman\r\nwho suffers from this disorder we have already characterized as the\r\npsychically frigid type. We have described this type as one which, if\r\nsexual reactions alone determined our definition, might be considered\r\nperfectly normal. The psychically frigid woman responds readily to\r\nsexual foreplay, and her orgasm is usually deep and satisfying. Examine\r\nher reactions as closely as we may, we can at first find no single\r\naspect of them that would indicate a problem that could be classified\r\nas sexual frigidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the woman does have an obviously serious problem. She seems\r\nto be unable to form a close relationship that will endure. She is\r\napparently devoted to an inner ideal of transiency in love. Sometimes\r\nshe is not conscious of the fact that transiency in love is so\r\nimportant to her, but everything about her amorous career indicates\r\nthis is so. She may select as partners married men or men who are\r\nchronically hostile to women and who always end up by rejecting them.\r\nOr she may do the rejecting herself. She is usually faithful to her\r\npartner of the moment and indeed sometimes pays lip service to the hope\r\nthat this time the love affair will last. But just below the surface\r\nof her awareness she has no such wish. If the relationship shows any\r\nindication of moving toward permanency, she will create a reason for\r\nterminating it. And this is where her sexual problem shows: if she\r\ncould not terminate it she would inevitably become sexually frigid with\r\nher partner.\r\n\r\nOne might wonder why I include this type here, since her problem\r\nis not one of physical frigidity as we ordinarily think of it--a\r\nprimary blocking of sexual feeling, an inability to experience vaginal\r\norgasm. I do so because in every case of this kind that I have treated\r\nthere has been a profound sexual involvement. Early and destructive\r\nsexual experiences (usually some form of seduction) have led to a\r\npsychological inability to relate emotionally to another.\r\n\r\nIn the cases discussed up to now, we have seen that a too early\r\nexperience can lead to a permanent repression of a child’s entire\r\nsexual nature. Overstimulation leads to anxiety; anxiety leads to a\r\nruthless repression of sensuality by the little individual. Basically\r\nthe sexual experience has been felt as dangerous and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIn our psychically frigid type we see, on the sexual level, just the\r\nopposite kind of conscious reaction. A too early stimulation causes\r\na pleasurable sensual reaction, and the memory of this is held onto\r\npassionately. The deep guilt that is generated in the little girl,\r\nhowever, causes a displaced psychological reaction of great intensity.\r\n\r\nTo understand this personality structure more fully, let us look at a\r\ntypical case.\r\n\r\nMolly M. was a passionate bohemian in every sense of the word. When\r\nshe first came to my office she was dressed in the height of what was\r\nthen bohemian high fashion: dancing slippers, a dirndl-effect skirt and\r\nblouse, and long cotton stockings. She wore her hair in a pony tail\r\nand had no makeup on whatsoever. She lived in Greenwich Village in a\r\nfive-flight walk-up cold-water flat. She was then twenty-seven years\r\nold and had been living in the same place since her graduation from\r\ncollege at twenty-two. She had a decent job but preferred to stay in\r\nthis exotic tenement.\r\n\r\nMolly had come to me because, as she stated it, she was scared. In\r\nthe past two years she had become pregnant twice and had had two\r\nabortions. The last one, which had occurred three months before, had\r\nbeen performed under the most sordid circumstances; in the basement\r\nof a tenement by a midwife with filthy hands. Performed without\r\nanesthetic, it had been terribly painful and resulted in a serious\r\nuterine infection which required hospitalization. In the hospital the\r\ngynecologist had warned Molly that if she had not already ruined her\r\nchances to have children she might very well do so the next time.\r\nDespite her resolution at that time to change her ways, she had\r\nrecently picked up with a penniless art student who obviously had no\r\nreal feelings for Molly and, I suspected, no real ability to care\r\nfor any other person. It was clear that this relationship was going\r\nnowhere, just as the rest had.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at Molly’s story.\r\n\r\nMolly’s mature sexual life had started at the age of thirteen! She had\r\nhad an affair with a high school senior in her home town--she described\r\nit as a “back-seat” affair--and it had lasted for a year. From the\r\nbeginning and even under the unfavorable circumstances that love-making\r\nin an automobile must certainly create, Molly had had a total sexual\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nSince that time she had had upward of forty sexual affairs. None of\r\nthem had lasted for more than a year and some only one or two weeks.\r\nAll of them had been with men who were ineligible for marriage either\r\nbecause they were already married or because they were not emotionally\r\ncapable of marrying.\r\n\r\nMolly, though she had certain superficial pretensions to being an\r\nintellectual, was not one by any means. But she was an intelligent\r\ngirl. She had a position as a researcher on a weekly trade paper, and\r\nher work had put her in line to become head of the research department.\r\nHer job represented the “respectable” side of her life. However,\r\ndespite some uneasiness of brief duration in college, she had never\r\nseriously questioned the “rightness” of her sexual conduct. Each time\r\nshe had had an affair she believed that she was in love and she never\r\nhad more than one affair at a time. When the current love was over she\r\nalways experienced feelings of relief.\r\n\r\nIf Molly had come from an environment where a free attitude toward\r\nsexuality had prevailed, her actions might not have seemed so\r\ninexplicable. But her home environment could not have been more\r\nconventional. She had come from a small New England city near Boston.\r\nHer father was the president of the leading bank in that city and\r\nhad been active in church and civic affairs. Her mother, too, had\r\nbeen a church leader and a member of the school board. Her parents’\r\nmarriage had obviously been a good one; the domestic life was serene;\r\nthey rarely quarreled; their civic duties were most often shared\r\nenterprises. And they genuinely loved their three children. There were\r\ntwo girls older than Molly, and they had led most conventional lives.\r\nThey had married after college and each had had two children.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had caused Molly’s rebellion against her environment? And\r\nwhat was at the root of her inability to form a relationship? What was\r\nthe cause of her psychic frigidity?\r\n\r\nA psychiatrist familiar with this kind of case considers the\r\npossibility of an early seduction of some kind. It had indeed occurred.\r\n\r\nMolly was unwilling to discuss it at first. And this was followed by\r\nan unwillingness to ascribe any particular significance to the event.\r\nShe believed it was an isolated occurrence that had had no particular\r\nor permanent effect on her. Actually, as the matter unfolded, it became\r\nclear that this event was the very nucleus of her later difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt had happened when she was six. Three houses down from her there\r\nhad lived a man in his early sixties. I shall call him Mr. Brown. He\r\nwas a well-to-do person whose wife had died some years before and who\r\nnow lived alone. He was very friendly, she remembered, with everyone,\r\nand often her father, out for an evening stroll, would drop in on him\r\nand spend an hour or two chatting on Mr. Brown’s screened-in veranda.\r\nOccasionally he would come to Molly’s house for dinner. She found out\r\nlater that he was a director in her father’s bank. He was certainly,\r\nas far as her parents or any other grownups were concerned, above all\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nSometimes Molly would play jump-rope or hopscotch outside of Mr.\r\nBrown’s house. One day he invited her in and gave her a piece of cake\r\nand ten cents. She was delighted, and often thereafter he would have\r\nher in, always giving her something sweet to eat. He was pleasant\r\nand gentle and she loved him. She did not remember the first time it\r\nhappened, but soon sitting on his lap became an integral part of her\r\nnow frequent visits. He would tell her a story and ruffle her hair,\r\ntouch her arms or hands. Gradually his touching extended to her legs\r\nand thighs. She liked the sensations and, being so young, she could not\r\nconceive of his doing anything that would be wrong.\r\n\r\nHer visits now became almost daily occurrences, and then one day\r\nhe touched her vagina. She could recall the whole event with great\r\nclarity. She remembered that his hand shook and that he looked very\r\npale. Her sensations were exquisite and she involuntarily closed her\r\nthighs, pressing his hand against her vagina. At this point the whole\r\n“affair” became enormously exciting to her. For a period of almost a\r\nmonth she visited him as often as she could.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Mr. Brown did not confine his caresses\r\nto the little girl’s clitoris. At length he actually penetrated her\r\nhymen with his finger. She remembered this because it was painful, but\r\nshe also recalled that the sensations of pleasure outweighed the pain.\r\nThereafter he would masturbate her vaginally whenever they met in his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThis seduction lasted for some time, when one day while she was sitting\r\non his lap he took his penis out and rubbed it against her. She was\r\nso initiated to the pleasures of sexuality by this time that the act\r\ndid not seem strange to her, nor did the sight and size of a grown\r\nman’s penis cause her the alarm it would normally occasion in a child.\r\nHer vagina was of course too small to admit more than a very partial\r\nentrance, but (and this she remembers clearly) though he did not thrust\r\nin any way, the little girl herself pressed her body toward him despite\r\nthe pain it caused.\r\n\r\nThis occasion ended this bizarre and shocking experience. Apparently\r\nMr. Brown was tardily overwhelmed by feelings of guilt or by a fear of\r\ngetting caught, for he was not home when she next called for a visit\r\nand he did not return for over two years. By that time she had put the\r\nmatter out of her conscious mind, or at least held the memory very much\r\nin abeyance.\r\n\r\nThis seduction was not difficult for Molly to recall, however, but she\r\nfound it hard to recapture other feelings which had been associated\r\nwith the experience, primarily the feeling of guilt.\r\n\r\nNow let us take the matter step by step. Why, in the first place, did\r\nMolly react with excitement rather than shock to this whole experience?\r\nThere are two reasons. In the first place, the seduction was done by a\r\nperson who was loved by the child. He was a friend of the family, no\r\nless acceptable or trustworthy to the little girl than her own father\r\nand mother.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, Molly had not yet passed completely through the\r\nstage of infantile sexuality into the latency period, when normally sex\r\ngoes underground until puberty. She was still able to be excited by\r\nsensual experiences. A year or two later she might not have accepted\r\nthe situation, probably would have reacted to it with shock or horror;\r\nit might have contributed to a different kind of frigidity, perhaps the\r\nanesthesia of total frigidity.\r\n\r\nIt was clear, however, that she had felt guilty about her reactions.\r\nShe had not communicated the experience to her parents--a clear\r\nindication of guilt feelings. And later she had separated the seduction\r\nand its sensual pleasures from her conscious mind, made no connection\r\nbetween it and her later unconventional behavior. If she had not\r\nexperienced guilt she would have had to make no such separation.\r\n\r\nWhile Molly had no further sexual experiences in her latency period,\r\nshe began to behave differently from the other girls in her group\r\nvery early. At twelve she began to pet with a boy next door and was\r\ncertain that she would have had intercourse with him had he not been so\r\nfrightened of her advances. At thirteen she would sneak out at night\r\nto meet one of several older boys, and on one of these occasions she\r\nhad sexual intercourse. She went around with this boy for about a year.\r\nHe then graduated from high school and went away to college, and Molly\r\npromptly started another sexual relationship with another senior in\r\nhigh school.\r\n\r\nSexual affairs from then on followed one after the other through high\r\nschool and college. The only concession Molly made to conventional\r\nmorality was the afore-mentioned fact that she did not allow the\r\naffairs to overlap.\r\n\r\nAs she entered her teens another aspect of Molly’s behavior became\r\napparent. More and more she sought out individuals markedly different\r\nfrom those on her own social level. By fifteen she had become\r\ndistinctly “wild,” coming in late at night and refusing to obey her\r\nparents in any way. She would not go out with any of the high school\r\nor college boys she met. She had made friends with a group of girls\r\non a lower economic level whose social life consisted largely of\r\npicking up men at dances. In this way Molly met several men who played\r\nin bands and who were, of course, not what her family could possibly\r\nhave approved of. She did not care in the least; she felt she told me,\r\n“unutterably bored” with her family, felt “they were sunk in their way\r\nof life,” led absolutely “joyless and pointless existences.”\r\n\r\nDespite all this, Molly maintained her scholastic record at a high\r\nlevel and was admitted to college--another sign of the division within\r\nher personality. In college her unremitting affairs persisted, as did\r\nher selection of friends outside of her own social sphere. At one\r\npoint she had an affair with a Negro labor organizer, at another with\r\nan Italian dock hand, at still another with the father of a college\r\nclassmate. It is not surprising, then, that as soon as she finished\r\ncollege (and here, too, she maintained her good scholastic record) she\r\ngravitated toward Greenwich Village and immediately launched into a\r\nbohemian social and sexual existence. She experienced no conscious\r\nregrets or qualms of conscience as, year in, year out, she continued in\r\nthis mode of living, a mode so different from that of her parents. She\r\nwas sustained by her pride in what she called her “healthy animality”\r\nand was fond of stating that most people led lives of great frustration\r\nand “of quiet desperation.”\r\n\r\nHer animosity toward her parents did not diminish when she grew up, and\r\nat the time she came to see me she had not visited them for two years.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of Molly’s early seduction, as you can see, _were_\r\ngrave. However, the psychological structure she had developed to cope\r\nwith this seduction is not a hard one to understand.\r\n\r\nHuman beings are largely guided by the pleasure principle, and this is\r\nmost clearly evinced in childhood. Molly had received a great deal of\r\npleasure from her early sexual experience, but she had also experienced\r\na great deal of guilt about it. When Mr. Brown departed she had\r\nentered her latency period. But when puberty, with its reassertion of\r\nsexuality, set in, the original sexual experience had set a mold for\r\nMolly’s personality. She enjoyed and sought sex to an abnormal degree\r\nfor her tender years.\r\n\r\nIn her unconscious life, however, she felt guilty for these feelings.\r\nBecause of her precocious sensuality her problem then was to get rid of\r\nher guilt feelings so that she could indulge her sexuality. This meant,\r\nin effect, getting rid of her parents for, in childhood, guilt of this\r\nkind is always associated with parental prohibition. She did this by\r\ndenying that her parents had any importance to her, by repressing all\r\nwarm feelings toward them, by constructing a set of values in which\r\nthey were, to use her words again, “stupid,” “loveless squares,”\r\n“without a drop of sensuality.”\r\n\r\nAs Molly and I continued our examination of her life and feelings it\r\nbecame apparent that the erection of this defensive mechanism had cost\r\na great deal indeed, even in terms of those pleasures to which she was\r\ndevoted. In order to be enjoyed, sex had to partake of the nature of\r\nthe original seduction; it had to be a forbidden and guilty act; it\r\nhad to be with a person who was, in her mind, anathema to her parents.\r\nAnd, primarily, it could not move over into a permanent and abiding\r\nrelationship, for if it did it could no longer be considered forbidden\r\nand guilty.\r\n\r\nThis meant, of course, that love could never lead to marriage or to\r\nchildren and to the joys these bring. For if a man was respectable,\r\n“meant well by her,” loved her, in her unconscious life she would\r\nimmediately associate him with her parents and their approval, and this\r\nwould kill all sexual feeling in her. She would be frigid with him.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, deep anxiety underneath Molly’s rebellion against\r\na permanent relationship. During the course of our work together and\r\nafter she had begun to see the implications of her problem, she began\r\nto try to associate with men who were more eligible for a decent\r\nrelationship. A dream she had during the course of her first attempt at\r\nsuch a relationship (with a young doctor she had met) shows the problem\r\nquite clearly.\r\n\r\nIn this dream she is sitting in the back seat of a car, kissing a\r\nyoung man in an intern’s uniform. She is very excited as they kiss and\r\ndecides that she will have intercourse with him. At this point the\r\nyoung intern says, “Please marry me.” No sooner are the words out of\r\nhis mouth than she begins to feel terrified, as though something awful\r\nis going to happen. She begins to tremble and wants to get out of the\r\ncar and run, but she is so frightened that she cannot move. Suddenly\r\nshe sees the face of a man outside the car. He is dressed in evening\r\nclothes and has a large dollar sign on his hat. He points a gun at them\r\nand says very clearly, “Both of you must die.” At that point she woke\r\nup in an absolute panic which lasted for over an hour.\r\n\r\nThe intern in the dream stands, of course, for the young doctor she\r\nknows. The man with the dollar sign on his hat stands for her banker\r\nfather. Sex is all right, and she wishes for it as long as it is\r\nfurtive and hidden. The moment it becomes respectable (“Please marry\r\nme”) the hidden and guilty act will be made known and her father will\r\npunish her in the most horrible way possible.\r\n\r\nShe had, as you can see, never resolved her early guilt feelings about\r\nthe childhood seduction. Her whole life had been built around this\r\nearly experience.\r\n\r\nMolly’s relationship with the young doctor did not prosper, but in the\r\ncourse of our work she finally did meet and marry a very fine man.\r\nOn the basis of insights she had had, she had decided to postpone\r\nintercourse with him until after the marriage. When the love-making\r\nbegan she at first responded sexually, but in a matter of a few weeks\r\nshe became quite frigid.\r\n\r\nThis reaction of course represented, as in the case of the intern, her\r\nlifelong fear. However, since she had faced up to her psychological\r\nfrigidity, had stopped running away into pointless and meaningless\r\nrelationships, the resolution of this problem was merely a matter of\r\ntime, of “working through” the guilt feelings she had never dared to\r\nface before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe form of psychic frigidity represented by Molly’s case has always,\r\nin my experience, been caused by a childhood seduction. The seduction\r\nusually takes place between the fourth and seventh year, and the child\r\nreacts to the experience with strong sensual pleasure accompanied by\r\nguilt. This guilt is handled by a withdrawal from the parents and from\r\nvalues they represent. And sensual pleasure becomes an end in itself,\r\ndissociated from friendly perduring relations with another person.\r\nIt must be furtive, indulged in with unlikely persons; acute anxiety\r\ndevelops if there is any danger that it will lead to marriage.\r\n\r\nThe seduction need not be as complete or as direct as Molly’s. I\r\nhave had a case in which a single sight of grownups having sexual\r\nintercourse has had the effect of a seduction on a child. In such a\r\ncase the pleasure reaction becomes associated with the early erotic\r\nfeelings toward the father. The suggestion in the child’s mind is that\r\nher “evil” wishes can be granted if she will displace them onto another\r\nperson. In later years this becomes the model for sexual behavior;\r\nsexual desire in the woman is too closely associated with the father\r\nimage, so the love object sought must be as different from the father\r\nimage as possible.\r\n\r\nSometimes “liberal” parents seduce their children quite unwittingly.\r\nNot too long ago it became the practice among certain “liberated”\r\nor intellectual families to indulge in a species of nudism within\r\nthe home. This practice was based on a misunderstanding of certain\r\ncontributions of modern psychology, mainly the concept of inhibition.\r\nThe parents wished to prevent their children from being inhibited or\r\nprudish about the human body. Such parents made no difficulty about\r\nparading around nude in front of sons and daughters of any age.\r\n\r\nParents who believe in this manner have rather elaborate rationales\r\nand present them convincingly. If certain of my patients are an\r\nindication, however, I can testify that many children do not have the\r\n“healthy” reaction to nudism in the home that the parents had expected.\r\nTo a six-year-old girl the sight of a naked father can be far too\r\nstimulating an experience for her to handle. She will react either with\r\nshock or excitement or both. The same is true of boys who are permitted\r\nto view their mothers in the nude.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that erotic fixation on parents constitutes a stage in the\r\ngrowth process. Whatever it may be in other societies, primitive or\r\notherwise, nudity in our society is associated with lustful feelings.\r\nFamily nudism, I firmly believe, tends to fixate children on parents\r\npermanently by causing unnecessary stimulation and hence strong guilt\r\nfeelings. The result can be similar to a direct seduction of the child.\r\n\r\nPsychic frigidity is often confused with a temporal emotional condition\r\nwe call situational frigidity. A woman suffering from situational\r\nfrigidity has no basic sexual problem. Her responses have always been\r\nnormal and her orgasm is both frequent and satisfying. However, some\r\nsevere reality problem has arisen in her life which has caused a\r\ntemporary eclipse of her sexual responsiveness.\r\n\r\nOn occasion a woman may become quite disturbed by this fact. Let me\r\ngive an example.\r\n\r\nAnne S. was thirty-five. She had had a happy marriage for ten years.\r\nIn the first seven years of her marriage she had had two children,\r\nboth girls. She had had no more fears of pregnancy and motherhood than\r\nshe had had of sex. Her upbringing had been, from the psychiatric\r\nstandpoint, exemplary. In every determinable way she was an excellent\r\nsweetheart, mother, and wife.\r\n\r\nSix months before she came to see me she had given birth to her third\r\nchild, a boy. In a very short time it became clear that the child was\r\nmongoloid. After several weeks of indecision she had finally yielded\r\nto the pressure of the doctor and her husband and the child had been\r\ncommitted to an institution. At the time she came to me she had just\r\nlearned that its congenital defects would be fatal within two or three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne had resumed her sexual relationship with her husband after\r\nthe birth of this child she had been completely unresponsive and\r\nactively disliked the whole act. This had upset her. She had thought\r\nthis would pass in a week or two, but it had not. The fear that she\r\nmay have lost her capacity to love or at least to love her husband had\r\nbrought her to a psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nAnne could not have been more mistaken about the significance of her\r\nunresponsiveness. She had underestimated the depth of the blow the\r\nbirth of such a child can have on a mother. Grief and other profound\r\nemotions incapacitate the ability to love; one’s entire confidence in\r\noneself is shaken. It is perfectly normal under such circumstances to\r\nwithdraw emotionally. In fact, it is even desirable. Wounded feelings\r\nmust heal, and immobilizing oneself emotionally is good therapeutic\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nTime is the only anodyne for this kind of normal emotional pull-back.\r\nIn this case Anne’s child died within two months, as had been\r\npredicted. Her so-called situational frigidity lasted for three months\r\nafter that and then disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nSince the sexuality of women, as we have seen, is so “psychological” in\r\nits nature, these temporary situational frigidities are probably quite\r\nprevalent, though there are no final statistics on them. They can be\r\ncaused by a wide variety of circumstances and can last for a week or\r\ntwo to several months, depending on the severity of the circumstance. I\r\nhave seen this type of temporary frigidity brought on by such disparate\r\ncauses as the death of a loved parent, the illness of a child (even\r\na relatively slight illness), a husband’s economic worries, and a\r\ndifficult birth, to name but a few.\r\n\r\nOne very scrupulous wife, who took great pride in her ability to drive\r\na car, even had a sexual blocking for a few nights when she was given\r\nher first traffic ticket. She had parked too long on the wrong side of\r\nthe street, and the officer who gave her the ticket had also given her\r\na stern talking-to.\r\n\r\nAll one really has to know about situational frigidity is that it\r\nisn’t serious and that it’s well within the normal range of woman’s\r\ndelicately balanced sexual nature and will most certainly pass. The\r\nonly therapy one needs is patience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese cases represent, then, the major forms of frigidity. My intent\r\nin presenting them has been threefold. In the first place, it is\r\nimportant to understand what type of frigidity you have. Second, it\r\ncan be helpful to see the individual characteristics of each kind\r\nof frigidity. Third, it is necessary to understand that all of the\r\nfrigidities have certain basic characteristics in common (with the\r\nexception of situational frigidity), for this latter fact will allow us\r\nto approach each individual type with one basic form of solution.\r\n\r\nWith this final information in mind we are now ready to turn our\r\nattention to the means by which frigidity can be resolved.\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\n_The Bridge to Womanhood_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 13_\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have come now to the last and most important part of our journey\r\ntogether, to the point where we can examine the means by which real\r\nlove can be achieved. Let us start by examining what real love is, its\r\nrole in life and its component parts.\r\n\r\nBecause of their problems in loving, many people arrive at a point\r\nwhere they turn against love itself. Having lost their hope of\r\nachieving love, they quite humanly tend to depreciate it, try to\r\nminimize its importance. One of the commonest statements I hear from\r\nfrigid patients in the first interview goes something like this: “Well,\r\nit really doesn’t matter, I suppose; there aren’t very many happy\r\nmarriages anyway. And I suppose there are more important things than\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nLet us correct any tendency of this kind right here and now.\r\n\r\nUsing the word in its widest sense, I would say that the ability to\r\nlove is the single most important characteristic that man has. It is\r\nthe faculty upon which all the great actions, hopes, and aspirations of\r\nthe world are founded. Without it there could be no brotherhood among\r\nmen, and therefore the very concept of civilization as we understand it\r\nwould be unknown, even unthinkable. Men would be essentially isolated\r\nindividuals whose personal drives, needs, and appetites would be the\r\nonly realities to them. Aloneness, a terrible loneliness (those who\r\ncannot love will know what I mean), would be mankind’s lot.\r\n\r\nLove means, in its very deepest sense, union; union between\r\nindividuals, between women and women, men and men, men and women. It\r\nis the most basic and profound urge we have, and its power for good is\r\nillimitable.\r\n\r\nIn love we make the good of our partner (whether he is our child, our\r\nneighbor, or our sweetheart) as important to us as our own good. In\r\nthe union of love we are able to experience the essential oneness of\r\nman and nature, to know that the universe is indeed our home and all\r\nmen within it members of our family. In this way man learns through\r\nlove that he is not alone, not condemned to the pain and anxiety he\r\nexperiences when he has nobody with whom he can share his mind, his\r\nheart, his body.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this happy unity is most clearly seen in the love\r\nbetween men and women. The act of sexual love is a direct expression of\r\nit. Two individuals once unknown to each other, until recently total\r\nstrangers, now nevertheless literally merge together physically, know\r\neach other in the closest of physical embraces. They were miraculously\r\nmade for this purpose, constructed for this union. The man leaves\r\nsomething of himself within the woman, his sperm. And a part of the\r\nwoman joins this, merges with it. They have indeed become one flesh.\r\n\r\nAnd this merging, in addition to the joy and comfort it brings to each\r\nto join with the other as one, can become a creative act. From the\r\nunion a child may be created. Thus we see that the profound result of\r\nthe union which always characterizes love is productivity, creation.\r\n\r\nIf this physical coupling were all there was, it would be miraculous\r\nstill, though an experience shared by other than human forms of life.\r\nBut man, as distinct from animals, has mind. And minds, as well as\r\nbodies, have the capacity to merge too, the need to, the profound joy\r\nin so doing. It is when body and mind of a man and woman merge, become\r\na unity, that we see the highest expression of what we term love.\r\n\r\nWhen two people are able to join as one in love, there are certain very\r\ndefinite things that happen to them, as far as each individual mind is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, each is able to come far closer to his or her own\r\npotentialities. The merging that takes place in psychological love is\r\nessentially creative (just as its physical counterpart is), and so each\r\nlover is able to come closer and closer to his true self. All who have\r\never loved know of this inward blossoming, this fecundation by the love\r\nof the other. In work, in play, in all the inner and outer activities\r\nof life, the individual becomes far more vital and more productive than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of love: to each, as I have said, the love\r\npartner becomes as important as oneself, and from this it follows that\r\nthe good of the loved one is all important to the other. Thus all\r\nthings that help the other, cause him to be joyful, secure, freely\r\nand completely himself, become a chief concern of the other. This\r\nfact is why real love never leads to domination or to a struggle for\r\npower between two people. Through the mersion of love the uniqueness\r\nand individuality of the other person becomes precious, and hence all\r\neffort is made to guard the special qualities of the beloved. In love\r\nwe never encounter a man trampling on his wife’s rights and needs or a\r\nwoman competing with her husband. The value of the other as he is and\r\nas he can grow to be becomes the highest value in life.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high value she places upon her loved one a woman makes\r\nthe understanding of him one of her most important activities. And this\r\nunderstanding furthers love, which in turn furthers understanding,\r\nso that the process is a very dynamic one. By gaining a knowledge\r\nof her loved one she is able ultimately to go to the very root of\r\nhis personality, thus making an even deeper merging of her with him\r\npossible. Such understanding implies, of course, a great sensitivity\r\nto all of his reactions. And it makes her, too, inquire urgently (and\r\ncreatively) into herself, so that no blocks to their deep psychological\r\ncommunion can develop.\r\n\r\nThese are, then, some of the results of real love. I have listed them\r\nas a rebuttal of and a reminder to any who have, through repeated\r\ndefeat, become discouraged in their struggles to love and have tended\r\ntherefore to minimize love’s importance. There is nothing in life that\r\nis so important as love. In fact, as one of my patients once said,\r\nlooking back on the period when she was unable to love, “Without love\r\nthere is nothing in life.”\r\n\r\nOne cannot win the battle to love if one minimizes it. The frigid\r\nwoman, above all, must realize this and never give up her struggle.\r\nIndeed, a complete awareness of how important love is can be in itself\r\na big step along the way to achieving the ability to love and to be\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nNow if we summarize what has just been said about love, what do we\r\nfind is its essential characteristic? This: the ability to see the\r\nother person _as he is_ and to esteem him above everything else for his\r\nindividual quality, indeed to love him (and so want to merge with him)\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we were to summarize all the case histories of\r\nthe various forms of frigidity I have given and all the other pertinent\r\nfacts I have adduced about frigidity, we would find just the opposite\r\nfact. The frigid woman, of whatever variety she may be, _never sees the\r\nman she wants to love as he is_. His individual and essential quality\r\nis entirely unknown to her and unknowable by her. He is a series of\r\nprojections from her past. He is a composite of the fears, the errors,\r\nthe misunderstandings of her infancy and childhood. The real union of\r\nlove is therefore impossible with this quasi monster she has conjured\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThus we can see that the major task of the frigid woman is to rid\r\nherself of these projections she makes upon mankind in general and upon\r\nher own man in particular. She must see through them and divest herself\r\nof them, come to see men in their true role vis-à-vis woman and her\r\nhusband in all his uniqueness and with all his potentiality.\r\n\r\nThat is step one.\r\n\r\nWhen she has done this there is another step she must take. If one\r\nthinks of the description of love I have given, one realizes that it\r\nimplies a very great security within oneself, an acceptance of one’s\r\nown uniqueness and essential femininity. But the frigid woman fears and\r\nrejects femininity, as we have seen, feeling it to be a dangerous trap.\r\nShe must learn to alter this basic and negative attitude entirely. She\r\nmust see how childish and false, how utterly self-depriving this view\r\nof womanhood is and give it up.\r\n\r\nThus we see that in frigidity the two main doors to psychological and\r\nsexual union--to love, in short--have been closed and locked.\r\n\r\nIf these two doors can be opened again, the frigid woman will have\r\nresolved her problem.\r\n\r\nJust these two doors? Is this not an oversimplification? To these two\r\nquestions I can give unequivocal answers: yes to the first and no to\r\nthe second. These are the two roots of the problem. Attack them head\r\non, resolve them, and the major part of the task has been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 14_\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution of an emotional problem is a process, a process with a\r\nbeginning, a middle, and an end. To put this process in motion and to\r\nmaintain it in motion, two distinct approaches are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to grasp the problem _objectively_, to understand its\r\nnature, its implications, to learn all the _outside_ facts about it one\r\ncan grasp with one’s intellect.\r\n\r\nWe have now taken this first step, an all-important one for most\r\npeople. If you have read thus far, you have learned a great many\r\nobjective facts about frigidity.\r\n\r\nYou have learned what it is and the toll it exacts; you have seen why\r\nwomen are subject to it and how it originates in the individual and\r\nthe different forms it may take. You have seen, too, how woman has\r\nattempted to masculinize her personality, how she has tried to eschew\r\nsex entirely; and you have seen why these unhappy attempts _can_\r\nbe successful, why they are inherent biological and psychological\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThis kind of objective understanding is of great importance. It frees\r\none from prejudice and prevents one from seeking false solutions\r\n(which abound); it brings one face to face with the real nature of the\r\ndilemma of frigidity, its essentially psychological structure, and it\r\nuncovers the hidden area where personal responsibility lies.\r\n\r\nWithout this kind of objective intellectual understanding the\r\nindividual woman could not come to direct grips with frigidity, for she\r\nwould not know its nature. This type of knowledge, then, has carried us\r\nto the very edge of the bridge to true womanhood.\r\n\r\nIn order to cross it, however, the individual woman must do more than\r\nmerely understand in an objective manner.\r\n\r\nThe second and all-important step in the resolution of the problem\r\nof frigidity requires a _subjective_ approach, an inquiry by the\r\nindividual woman into the attitudes and emotions that are preventing\r\nher from achieving maturity. The kind of knowledge one gains in this\r\nway we call insight. If one can get true insight into the attitudes and\r\nfeelings upon which one’s own frigidity is based, the problem can be\r\ncompletely resolved.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this may seem like a big order and insight a frightening\r\nword. Every woman knows how complex her emotions are, how difficult to\r\nunderstand, how multi-faceted every human being is.\r\n\r\nBut I wish to tell you now, at the outset, that the whole approach can\r\nbe kept very simple. Frigidity is like a log jam on a narrow stream.\r\nIf two or three logs jam together, forming a barrier, all the other\r\nlogs will jam up behind them, forming a complicated maze that stretches\r\nbackward sometimes for miles. To release the jam, however, all one has\r\nto do is to free the first two or three logs, and then the others will\r\nresume their unimpeded journey.\r\n\r\nThe emotional log jam we call frigidity is held in place by two\r\nbasically neurotic attitudes. The first is an attitude toward men;\r\nthe second is an attitude toward real womanhood. We have seen these\r\nattitudes in every form of frigidity and have seen how they function.\r\nIf the individual woman can come to grips with these two attitudes in\r\nherself, if she can dislodge them, the free flow of her personality\r\ntoward health and maturity will resume once again. Insight can dislodge\r\nthese hindering attitudes and keep them dislodged.\r\n\r\nLet us start, then, and see how insight into these attitudes can be\r\nachieved by the frigid woman.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you must do is a very practical one. You must give\r\nyourself, at least at the beginning, a certain amount of time alone,\r\nabsolutely alone, each day. It might be for ten minutes or for a half\r\nhour or an hour, but you must be alone and you must seek this time\r\nregularly. It is most helpful if you can select a time when your mind\r\nis relatively free of worries and duties.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do to achieve insight at these junctures? You start, on the\r\nsimplest level possible, to let yourself _really feel_ your negative\r\nemotions about your husband or sweetheart. Your only aim at this point\r\nis to let these negative feelings come to the surface, to seek them\r\nout, experience them _to the full_.\r\n\r\nPick out some small but recurrent irritation or annoyance he causes\r\nyou; the more trifling, the better. Fix on it, then dare to allow your\r\nemotions and thoughts about it to hold sway.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a single example from the case history of a frigid\r\npatient. Every day this woman’s husband, on rising, dressed in the\r\nbathroom. He invariably left his razor on the sink and his pajamas in\r\nan untidy heap in a corner. This had irritated her and she had spoken\r\nabout it to him several times; he would reform for a few days but then\r\nwould invariably fall back into his old habits.\r\n\r\nThis bit of information about their married life had been presented\r\nquite casually in the course of my first discussion with this patient.\r\nAt that time she spoke of this peccadillo of her husband’s as a minor\r\nannoyance. A bit later, when she had returned to the subject for the\r\nthird time, each time expressing annoyance, I encouraged her to dwell\r\non it, to let herself feel the full measure of her emotions about it. I\r\ntold her that I suspected there was a good deal more in her _feelings_\r\nabout this apparently trifling matter than she suspected, and that I\r\nthought this because she had brought it up so many times.\r\n\r\nAt first she protested that the matter was too small to pay attention\r\nto; that there were more important things to consider. But with\r\nencouragement she gradually allowed herself to pursue her true\r\nfeelings. Underneath her commonplace protest was, as I had thought, an\r\nemotional cave-of-the-four-winds.\r\n\r\nHer husband’s “sloppy actions,” it turned out, did not merely “annoy”\r\nher; they “enraged” her. In her words, they signified his desire “to\r\nhumiliate me”; “he thinks I have nothing to do but pick up after him,\r\nto wait on him hand and foot.” Her anger became more and more explosive\r\nas she reflected on the matter, and it led very quickly and directly\r\nto her underlying attitude toward men as a whole. Men wanted to do\r\nnothing more or less than to enslave women, to exploit them. They\r\nconsidered themselves a race apart, superior to women. All they wanted\r\nfrom a woman was sex, or anything else they could get out of them. And\r\nthey were powerful, and thus dangerous; if a woman really showed her\r\nhostility they would use their physical strength against her. And so\r\nit went, on and on, the stored-up rage and the hostile and frightened\r\nattitudes that lay just beneath the surface and constituted the very\r\nbricks and mortar of her frigidity.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this technique for getting at one’s feelings it is best\r\nalways to select, as in the example quoted, one or more of the petty\r\nannoyances in everyday life. Does your husband’s behavior in company\r\nembarrass you? Has he an annoying habit? (Bathroom habits of a mate\r\nare very fruitful sources for this kind of self-investigation.) Is he\r\nuntidy? Does his taste in clothes irritate you? Does he ignore the\r\nchildren or pay too much attention to them, ignoring you? You will\r\nknow what has become the provocative agent in your life; select it and\r\nexplore the feelings underneath it to their limit.\r\n\r\nAs you let your feeling come to the surface, please note how quickly\r\nyou move from contemplation of your husband’s annoying characteristic\r\nto very broad generalities about men. In the case above the woman moved\r\nalmost at once from annoyance, to rage, to ascribing a hidden motive to\r\nall men--a desire to enslave women, to exploit them.\r\n\r\nIt was the generalities she made which (in the end) revealed to her\r\nwith great clarity that her underlying attitude created a spiritual\r\nclimate in which real love and therefore a productive marriage were\r\nvirtually impossible. How can one love, in any real sense, a person one\r\nregards, basically, as a tyrant?\r\n\r\nTaking this highly emotional inventory cannot be a swift affair. In the\r\nbeginning, for the first several sessions with herself, a frigid woman\r\nmay find that no very strong feelings or passionate generalizations\r\nwill come up. But if she perseveres she will inevitably get to an area\r\nwhere the feelings are intense and negative indeed. We have found that\r\nsuch feelings always exist in frigidity. If they did not, there would\r\nbe no frigidity.\r\n\r\nThe frigid woman has hidden the intensity of such feelings from her\r\nconscious mind for two reasons. To know these reasons can help you,\r\nmake you somewhat braver in your attempt to surface the feelings.\r\n\r\nThe first reason these emotions have remained hidden is their very\r\nintensity. They were, in the beginning, felt to be overwhelming; it was\r\nas if they proceeded from a bottomless well of feeling. And so, through\r\nthe years, one has learned to hide them, even from oneself, to fix them\r\non trifles in order to minimize them--to deny that, indeed, they exist\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nOnly by letting them up into the awareness can one experience the\r\nfact that their intensity is _not_ overwhelming and that the emotion\r\none experiences has very definite limits; it does not proceed from a\r\nbottomless well.\r\n\r\nI recall one woman who, in approaching this problem, would not let\r\nherself weep over a strong underlying feeling of rejection by men that\r\nshe had partially uncovered in herself. “If I start crying I feel I’ll\r\nnever stop,” she told me. She was not being histrionic either; that’s\r\nthe way she really felt. When she did let herself cry, however, the\r\nstorm lasted for a mere thirty minutes or so--and then it was done with\r\nfor good. She was terribly relieved to find that the emotion which,\r\nwhen unexpressed, seemed so boundless had very concrete limits. From\r\nthat point on she was much more at home with all of her emotions, not\r\nnearly so frightened of them.\r\n\r\nThe second reason a woman fears to let her feelings about her husband\r\n(and men in general) come to the surface is that she believes that the\r\nthings she feels are literally true. They exist in her unconscious or\r\npartly conscious mind as profound convictions. She holds them at bay\r\nbecause she does not wish to face just how completely a part of her\r\nmind believes that her highly irrational feelings are based on reality.\r\n\r\nIt will help, however, to know that, no matter how convinced a part\r\nof you is that your negative feelings represent reality, such is not\r\nthe case. Your investigation is not going to prove that your hidden\r\nfears are valid; it is going to prove that they are invalid. These\r\ndeep and hidden convictions are shaped early in a woman’s life,\r\nprimarily by her relationships with her parents and secondarily through\r\nher relationships with her brothers and sisters. They are basically\r\nirrational feelings, erected as defenses against childhood and girlhood\r\nfears and misunderstandings. They have no real basis in fact; they do\r\nnot pertain to the male _as he is_.\r\n\r\nIt is of very great importance to know this when you begin to uncover\r\nyour most secret convictions. No matter how real these negative\r\nattitudes appear to be, remember that they are _only_ feelings, not\r\nreality. As long as you keep that fact in the forefront of your\r\nmind you will increasingly dare to let these feelings up into your\r\nawareness, into your conscious mind.\r\n\r\nI counsel women to be remorseless with themselves in this search for\r\nany negative feelings they might possess toward their husband and\r\ntoward all men. Do not stop when you have seen one or two details that\r\nindicate an amount of feeling you had not clearly known you possessed.\r\nPress onward and inward fearlessly until you have exposed every last\r\nhostile and irrational emotion and attitude you have.\r\n\r\nOne woman who came to me had worked very hard for five sessions on her\r\nnegative feelings toward men. We had started our mutual investigation\r\nwhen she confessed that any slight irritability on her husband’s part\r\ncaused her to feel extremely anxious, often resulted in actual nausea.\r\n\r\nWe pursued the matter and soon found a great store of antagonism toward\r\nmen hidden just beneath the surface of an apparently gentle person.\r\nShe had, we discovered, the common, classical conviction that men wish\r\nto exploit women, to bend them to their wills. She soon realized she\r\nhad been interpreting many everyday happenings in the light of this\r\nbelief. Her husband, an editor, sometimes had to work at home in the\r\nevening and had asked her to keep the television set low until he was\r\nfinished. Though she knew his homework was exacting, she took this\r\nto be a characteristic infringement of her “rights” and had a great\r\ndeal of stored-up rage about it. She also had hidden rage at such\r\ncommonplace duties as bringing his clothes to the cleaner, entertaining\r\nhis business friends, cleaning his “filthy” study, etc.\r\n\r\nWe explored them all, one by one. Neither of us, however, felt that we\r\nhad come to the end of the matter. There was something that eluded us.\r\nShe as well as I felt certain of that. We persisted, therefore, and the\r\nhidden feeling at last showed itself. Returning to her first complaint,\r\nI asked her if she had ever been physically struck by her husband.\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied, “but I often _feel_ that he is going to strike me.”\r\n\r\nKnowing her husband to be a kind person, I pursued the matter, and it\r\nsoon developed that she had a very strong unconscious conviction that\r\nmen in general had no compunction whatever about using their superior\r\nphysical strength against women to obtain what they wanted. In other\r\nwords, she not only felt that men were basically hostile to women but\r\nthat they were potentially extremely violent.\r\n\r\nThis was a bizarre conviction, and my patient soon realized its\r\nirrational nature. Her picture of men was based on early memories of\r\na truly sadistic father; he had frequently struck her mother. When\r\nshe realized the pervasive importance of this only slightly repressed\r\nphysical fear of men she was able to resume a psychological growth that\r\nhad been severely impeded from the earliest age.\r\n\r\nBut the point I wish to emphasize is that she had to persist in her\r\nsearch for hidden attitudes. If she had assumed that she had gotten\r\nto the heart of her difficulty by uncovering the first few negative\r\nfeelings, her self-investigation could not have succeeded. Please\r\nmark the fact that she did not _feel_ she had come to the end of her\r\nemotional inventory until she had actually done so. If one is honest\r\nwith oneself one can sense, feel, when important attitudes still lie\r\nhidden within.\r\n\r\nIf you persist in your daily sessions with yourself, however, the time\r\nwill come when you will feel that you have exposed to your own view all\r\nof your angry feelings and your negative attitudes toward men, come to\r\nthe very lees of the feelings left over from childhood. You have now\r\nmade a major step toward recovery. The biggest log in the jam has been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nWhy does this necessarily follow?\r\n\r\nOne of the major contributions of modern psychiatry has been the\r\nestablishment of the fact that attitudes and feelings have the power\r\nto do lasting harm only when they are hidden from one’s awareness, or\r\nhalf hidden from it. The frigid woman’s troubling vestiges of youthful\r\nerror, once they have been made conscious, automatically lose the\r\ngreater part of their power to do harm. When they become known to the\r\nconscious mind they are then exposed to judgment, reason, and further\r\ninformation. They are seen, by one’s intelligence, to be fragile\r\nballoons of easily exploded ignorance. When this happens, the natural\r\nmovement of the personality toward health, blocked for years by hidden\r\nfears, rages, defenses, false attitudes, is resumed.\r\n\r\nA woman who can achieve this is now _prepared_ to understand her\r\nhusband _as he is_--and all other men _as man is_. If you will recall,\r\nthat particular ability, to comprehend and care about the uniqueness of\r\none’s mate, is a chief prerequisite for love.\r\n\r\nIf the frigid woman did not explore her irrational feelings in the\r\nmanner I have described, any objective information about men, learned\r\nfrom whatever source, would be useless. Her _hidden_ feelings about\r\nmen would still dominate. Now, however, with the hidden feelings up\r\nand out, she is ready to hear more about men as they really are, to\r\ncontrast the reality to her projection upon it. We shall take that\r\nlatter step in the next chapter, but before we do there is another,\r\nfurther insight into one’s feeling, which it will be very helpful to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\nWomen who suffer from frigidity often have, in addition to negative\r\nfeelings toward the male sex, another very marked characteristic.\r\nThey are subject to powerful _fantasies_ which militate against the\r\nrecovery of their lost sexuality and their psychological maturation.\r\nIt is extremely important that these fantasies be ruthlessly explored\r\nand exploded. If they are not, they serve the unhappy function of\r\npreserving the unhealthy conviction that one deserves a far better fate\r\nthan that of being a beloved wife and mother.\r\n\r\nSuch fantasies are often half hidden from view, just as are one’s\r\nnegative feelings about men. They are daydreams left over from\r\nadolescence or earlier. Their destructive power derives from the\r\nfact that the daydreamer either still believes that the dreams are\r\nrealizable or that she could have achieved them if her husband and\r\nfamily had not prevented her from doing so.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing how powerful and persistent these fantasies can be. They\r\ngenerally spring from an early desire to become an actress, a dancer,\r\nor a concert artist. However, they may also express wishes to become\r\na doctor, lawyer, athlete, diplomat, or whatever. Their impossible,\r\nWalter-Mittyish character is blithely ignored by the daydreamer. I\r\nhave had frigid women of forty and even fifty who still, just beneath\r\nthe logical, sound surface of their minds, still believed that someday\r\n(tomorrow perhaps, next year certainly) they would go to acting school\r\nand soon obtain leading roles in a Broadway drama, or resume their\r\npiano lessons and become famous concert artists.\r\n\r\nSuch fantasies derive their power from the fact that the daydreamer\r\nfeels unable to deal with reality. Since a woman who is frigid _is_\r\ndealing with her real-life situation in an inadequate manner, it is\r\nnot strange that she should hold onto such fantasies with passion.\r\nThey protect her from her feelings of inferiority. What matter, says\r\nher unconscious mind, if you are unable to love, what matter if your\r\nhusband exploits you, attempts to enslave you. Tomorrow--someday, at\r\nany rate--you will show them all that you are beautiful, glamorous, a\r\ngreat performer, or doctor, or lawyer, or Indian chief.\r\n\r\nThe frigid woman should approach such fantasies in the same manner as\r\nshe approaches her negative feelings toward the male sex. First she\r\nshould let the fantasy have full play. She should allow herself to\r\nimagine herself as impresario, doctor, whatever fantastic dream her\r\nunconscious has fixed on. Let the daydream roll on and on. Note its\r\nmagnitude, its grandiose quality, its glitter and its glamor.\r\n\r\nWhen all the details of the fantasy have been experienced, allow\r\nyourself to imagine what life would be like for you if you were _never_\r\nable to realize any single aspect of this daydream. If you feel\r\ndepressed by such a prospect, if the contemplation of life without\r\nthe possibility of realizing such a dream of glory seems empty, you\r\nhave had an important experience. You have taken your fantasy’s full\r\nmeasure. You now can get some idea of what an important part it plays\r\nin your emotional life.\r\n\r\nDo not be afraid of the depression, the feeling of emptiness that\r\nwill come with your first conscious attempts to free yourself of your\r\nfantasy. It can be the beginning of a far richer emotional life than\r\nany which depends on an unrealizable daydream. Therefore, persist for\r\na few days in imagining what life will be like if you do not ever\r\nrealize your daydream. Please notice that your depression does not go\r\nbeyond a certain depth and that it is not incapacitating; also note\r\nthat your feeling of deprivation is not unendurable.\r\n\r\nI am not using auto-suggestion in these last remarks. A persistent\r\ndaydream has certain characteristics in common with a drug or alcohol\r\nhabituation. The daydreamer has, over a long period of time, learned to\r\nhandle reality in terms of her drug--her deep-seated daydream. Without\r\nrealizing it she has come to feel that, without this psychological\r\nnarcotic, life would be impossible. She must, in a very real sense,\r\nwean herself from it, gradually realize that life without it is not\r\nnearly so dreary, so difficult, as she had imagined it would be.\r\n\r\nThe next step in this process is to explode the daydream entirely. This\r\ncan be done with a few pinpricks of cold logic. Most people, realizing\r\nthat such daydreams, formed in the heat of youth, have no function in\r\nreality, have long ago given them up in favor of living as passionately\r\nas possible in the present. The frigid woman, however, having a reason\r\nfor keeping them alive, has never scrutinized them in the cold light of\r\nrationality.\r\n\r\nI know of one woman who, at the age of thirty-eight, with three\r\nchildren under fifteen years of age, still felt she could become a\r\ndancer. As she looked more closely at this conviction she became\r\nincreasingly surprised at how seriously she really took this fantasy.\r\nAt length, when she felt really ready to face sacrificing her lifelong\r\nfantasy, she wrote a list of facts and questions. I present them here.\r\n\r\n 1. To become a dancer I would have to study the dance for a minimum\r\n of five years; during that time I would have to practice dancing for\r\n about eight hours a day. Could I take this discipline?\r\n\r\n 2. If my mind were able to take such discipline would my body be able\r\n to stand up under such arduous work?\r\n\r\n 3. If I were able to arrange it would I be willing to give up my daily\r\n contact and relationship with my three children?\r\n\r\n 4. If I overcame every obstacle and became a well-known dancer,\r\n achieving my wildest dream of success, I would have to go on tour for\r\n at least eight months of the year; this would mean separation from my\r\n husband and children during that time. Do I want this? Even if I do,\r\n could I take it emotionally?\r\n\r\nThe answers to these questions were obviously passionate noes. And\r\nthe result of such a common-sensical examination of her long-standing\r\nfantasy was, at long length, freedom from it.\r\n\r\nIt will not take much logical thought to dispose of your daydreams,\r\nthus clearing the way to a life in the passionate present rather than\r\nin a mythical future. Ask yourself the kinds of questions indicated\r\nabove and give yourself honest answers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn giving the case histories of women suffering from the various forms\r\nand degrees of frigidity, I have described to some extent the early\r\norigins of their problems. I should now like to raise the question of\r\njust how much knowledge of one’s early, often buried, experiences one\r\nmust uncover to achieve feminine maturity.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the majority of women suffering from frigidity do _not_\r\nhave to go into the matter of their childhood experiences to any extent\r\nat all. The evidence that their childhood experiences were traumatic to\r\nsome degree is contained in the fact that they do have problems in the\r\npresent. It is always the immediate problem about which people develop\r\ntheir deepest and strongest emotions. The technique of “feeling” one’s\r\nway through one’s problem is, as I have said, the method that really\r\nworks with frigidity; it is one’s present emotions, therefore, that\r\nconstitute the major material of one’s self-examination.\r\n\r\nActually understanding present feelings and attitudes reveals the past,\r\nfor it was in the past that these attitudes were established; they have\r\nchanged very little since their inception.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did I go into the detailed childhood development of\r\nfrigidity in my case histories? For the same reason that I gave all\r\nthe other objective facts about frigidity before we approached this\r\nsection. The more conscious knowledge one has of the entire problem\r\nof frigidity, the more one dares to face up to the responsibility for\r\none’s own problem--and the more one is _able_ to face up to it also.\r\nFor knowledge can free one of the ignorance and superstition upon which\r\nresistance to achieving psychic maturity is based.\r\n\r\nI am not, on the other hand, holding that there is any fundamental\r\nobjection to a scrutiny of early experiences or to helpful speculation\r\nabout them. Sometimes, as in the case of an early seduction, or a\r\nrape that is remembered, early experiences can throw a therapeutic\r\nsidelight on one’s present feelings. However, the myriad details that\r\ngo into the formation of everyone’s personality while growing up can be\r\nconfusing if one tries to understand them all without the help of an\r\nexpert guide; and it is not requisite for recovery to understand them\r\nall. So if self-examination of one’s early experiences does not seem to\r\nbe immediately helpful, I would abandon it entirely; I would confine\r\nmyself to a “feeling through” of my problem in the present, undoing the\r\nharm the childhood attitudes are still causing in the here and now.\r\n\r\nThe steps for achieving insight into one’s negative emotions which I\r\nrecommend here are the most difficult steps one has to take on the road\r\nto maturity. If you can take them, the hardest part will be over. The\r\nremaining part of the process of recovery occurs rather naturally, is a\r\nmatter of acquiring more information, allowing new feelings to grow and\r\nexpand inside oneself, accepting guidance past a few possible pitfalls.\r\nYou will see what I mean as we continue in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 15_\r\n\r\nTHE MALE SEX: A NEW HORIZON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe self-exploration described in the last chapter results in the\r\nsurfacing of hidden feelings, attitudes, and fantasies. Getting them\r\nup and out, exposing them to the bright light of reason and judgment,\r\nclears the psychological atmosphere almost miraculously.\r\n\r\nThe next most helpful step to take, I have found, is a re-evaluation of\r\nthe male sex. The woman who suffers from frigidity has, by definition,\r\nvery little knowledge of what men are really like. Since her attitudes\r\ntoward men were formed in her distant past and have altered little\r\nthrough the years, she has a child’s-eye view of men. To her, as\r\nparents to a child, men are powers, not people. Projecting her own\r\nchildhood fears and hopes and needs upon them, she has been calling\r\nthat reality and acting accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis next step, the conscious revaluation of men, can be achieved by\r\nlearning what the male sex is really like--how it differs from the\r\nfemale sex, what makes men think, act, and feel the way they do in\r\neveryday life--and by contrasting this knowledge with the negative\r\nattitudes and feelings she has now brought to the surface of her mind.\r\nIn this way she will soon learn to understand her husband _as he is_,\r\nand thus achieve the ability to love him in all of his uniqueness and\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nThe central characteristic of the male, and the one that most clearly\r\ndifferentiates him from the female, is his aggressiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual sphere this shows itself most clearly in the fact that\r\nthe man takes, for the most part, the initiative in wooing. He it is\r\nwho is the pursuer, the girl the pursued; he it is who proposes and he\r\nit is who initiates sex.\r\n\r\nAn analogy to this fundamentally aggressive activity of the male in\r\nrelationship to the female is seen, in a primordial biological form, by\r\nthe function of his sperm. As you may know, the individual spermatozoon\r\nis an individual cell which is propelled by a microscopic tail.\r\nAfter the deposit of spermatozoa in the vagina, the individual sperm\r\n_actively_ seeks out and joins the ova, which has been _passively_\r\nwaiting for it. This physiological metaphor, according to certain\r\nleading theoreticians, well expresses the fundamentally aggressive\r\nnature of man in relationship to woman, psychologically as well as\r\nsexually.\r\n\r\nThe male’s aggressiveness is, in general, directed to mastery of the\r\noutside world. It shows in him from his earliest years. The sports that\r\nhe selects have to do with physical aggression almost exclusively (of\r\ncourse some girls also like certain aggressive sports at an early age,\r\nbut most give them up in puberty). He likes the sports in which he has\r\nto run hard, to charge, to tackle, throw, and hit. In his adolescence\r\nhe will spend years in mastering skills that concern such aggressive\r\nactivity. A component of this aggressive desire for mastery is his\r\ncompetitiveness with other boys. He wishes to be as good or better than\r\nthey are, to make his mastery known to the outside world.\r\n\r\nIn the mental sphere, too, this basic aggressiveness is clearly\r\ndisplayed. His chief passion is in mastering the outward environment\r\nthat surrounds him, in, to use a phrase from football, “throwing\r\nit for a loss.” This desire leads him to become a scientist to\r\ncontrol-through-knowing some aspect of the world or even of the\r\nuniverse. Or it leads him to become a businessman, wresting a living\r\nfrom the competitive market place. Or it may lead him to become a\r\nphilosopher, aggressively probing the “why” of the world. Whatever role\r\nhe plays in life, he must use his aggression to master the environment\r\nhe selects as his province.\r\n\r\nBecause of this basic thrusting aggression which largely defines his\r\nrole in life, a boy is generally given a larger amount of freedom than\r\na girl is. One reason for this is that the male role in life will\r\ndemand a great deal of self-reliance in the individual, and this has\r\nbeen recognized by society. Men need the protection of the childhood\r\nhome for a much less protracted period than women do.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to men, women have a much smaller store of aggression\r\ndirected toward the outside world. Their activity is largely directed\r\ninward. Psychologically speaking, woman is, in a very real sense,\r\nconditioned by her final biological function. At the very center of\r\nher nature she is preparing herself for motherhood, and this fact\r\ndetermines the main direction of her psychic energy. Her childhood\r\ninterests show this clearly. She plays with dolls, she plays house,\r\nloves to be around Mother, fantasies marriage, is enormously curious\r\nabout all of her internal functions. She has, of course, a certain\r\nstore of interest and aggression which she _can_ direct outward, but\r\nthis characteristic becomes very secondary to her when inward or\r\noutward circumstances do not force her to use it.\r\n\r\nIntellectually woman is also basically inward. Her most potent faculty\r\nis her great intuition, her almost magical ability to understand\r\nanother person by consulting her own inward nature. This is contrasted\r\nto man’s objective “intellectual” type of understanding.\r\n\r\nIn describing the essential characterological structure of the male\r\nand contrasting it with the female I am describing absolute types,\r\nnot people as they are. In actuality most men have a certain store\r\nof passivity, of inwardness; and normal women have a certain amount\r\nof aggression. However, the normal male will be preponderantly\r\noutgoing and aggressive; the normal female’s psychic energies will be\r\npreponderantly directed inward.\r\n\r\nAs a direct or indirect result of man’s aggression and his commitment\r\nto the outside world, in maturity he develops certain behavioristic\r\npatterns that are diametrically opposite to female characteristics.\r\nInevitably the frigid woman will use his attributes to show that her\r\nman has no interest in her, or is weak, or is withdrawn, or is cruel\r\nand wishes to exploit her. Having no objectivity about men, she will\r\nfind in his differences from her further cause for estrangement, fear,\r\nand hostility.\r\n\r\nLet me give some instances of these behavioristic differences in\r\neveryday life.\r\n\r\nTo the woman, the bearer of children and the nest-maker, the home and\r\neverything in it are all-important. She invests her home with a great\r\ndeal of pride. She loves clean sinks, clean windows, clean floors. She\r\nwants things in her nest to be neat and orderly; she has made them that\r\nway and she wants them to stay that way.\r\n\r\nIt will be very easy for her to misunderstand the fact that her husband\r\nhas invested a major portion of his pride elsewhere: in his work, in\r\nhis achievements in the outside world. The cleanliness and neatness of\r\nhis home he takes for granted. He may even be, by his wife’s standards,\r\nseemingly antagonistic to neatness, actually sloppy, throwing his\r\nclothes around, leaving the sink cluttered, forgetting to use the ash\r\ntray, and what not. These things, of course, are not in themselves\r\npleasant traits, but the frigid woman will generalize about them, use\r\nthem to indicate her man’s essential indifference to her.\r\n\r\nHe may also not notice a new rug or even a new chair in the house. He\r\nmay have very small patience with any household duties he is forced to\r\nundertake: replacing a broken step or even a burned-out bulb. These\r\nattitudes can be quite confusing to a woman, and if she has any motive\r\nto do so she can easily interpret this kind of male behavior as further\r\nevidence of her husband’s indifference to her and to the family. It is\r\nnot; when it occurs it is just male. It may be helpful to her to try\r\nto imagine how long her interest in the details of his business life\r\nactually hold her attention. The house is her business, and it is not\r\nsurprising that he behaves the way he does in it, nor is it indicative\r\nof any lack of love in him.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of man that can be easily misinterpreted is the fact\r\nthat the male tends to be more sociable, likes to seek out and find a\r\nvigorous and sometimes quite varied social life. This, too, is part of\r\nhis aggressive nature. A woman, though she may be quite gregarious,\r\nis generally more content to sit at home, and her immediate circle of\r\nfriends is enough for her. The frigid woman may try to make much of\r\nher husband’s aggressive sociability. She is not enough for him; he is\r\nrestless and dissatisfied, etc.\r\n\r\nThe vigor and aggressiveness of a man during the course of a social\r\nevening are also often misunderstood by women. He may on occasions\r\nbe quiet, but he sometimes wants to do a great deal of the talking,\r\nmay even, in his enthusiasm, raise his voice in a conversation. His\r\ncompetitiveness may even embroil him in an actual argument, perhaps\r\na violent one. The woman likes things to run smoothly, to be utterly\r\nfriendly and tranquil. Her husband’s normal social aggressiveness can\r\nappear to be rude and crude to her. It can frighten her. Afterward she\r\nmay confront him with it, accusing him of strutting, of showing off,\r\nof cock-of-the-walk behavior. She is merely confronting him with his\r\nmaleness again.\r\n\r\nA very odd difference between men and women is the difference in their\r\nreactions to pain and fatigue. Women have a very high threshold for\r\nboth, and most men have a relatively low one. If a woman gets a burn on\r\nher hand she can stick it in butter or in cold water and go on making\r\nthe dinner. A man with the same burn could be completely incapacitated\r\nfor a while--and awfully angry at himself besides. The same is true\r\nof all sorts of minor aches and illnesses that occur in the normal\r\ncourse of events. Because of this difference in pain thresholds, men\r\ntend to pamper themselves or want to be pampered when they have head\r\ncolds, headaches, sore throats, or other minor illnesses that a woman\r\nmight ignore. The frigid woman, of course, finds this difference a\r\nrich mine to work. She can and does use it to taunt her husband with\r\nhis “weakness,” again showing her essential ignorance of and lack of\r\nsympathy with the male nature.\r\n\r\nOf course sex itself remains one of the most fruitful sources for\r\nresentment and misunderstanding in the frigid woman. Here male\r\naggression can be most clearly seen. The man is stimulated easily by\r\nthings that would not excite his woman in the least. He is susceptible\r\nerotically to all sorts of sights, sounds, and odors. His wife\r\nundressing may excite him; her perfume may excite him; he may become\r\naroused if she is looking wan or looking bright-eyed. The frigid woman,\r\nnot comprehending male reactions or their plural causes, generally\r\nfeels that his lust is unselective and impersonal. She takes his ardor\r\nas an affront for that reason.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual act the aggressive thrusting of the penis offends\r\ntoo. As passion increases during the act, the strength of the thrust\r\nincreases, sometimes becomes quite a formidable series of pushes (one\r\nof the slang expressions men use for intercourse is “a bang”). This\r\nsometimes violent thrusting is a perfectly normal aspect of male\r\nsexuality and to the normal woman is of course highly desirable. Frigid\r\nwomen are frightened of it, experience it as an invasion of their\r\nintegrity, an act of hostility against them.\r\n\r\nNothing could be farther from the fact. In his aggressive movements a\r\nman is showing his love in his particular way, his passionate need to\r\nlose his isolation, to rid himself of it, to join with his beloved. To\r\nmisunderstand this is to misunderstand all.\r\n\r\nDoubtlessly we could make a longer list of the characteristic things\r\nmen do and feel that anger or are misunderstood by women with a\r\nfrigidity problem. If you have started the form of self-inquiry I have\r\nadvocated you have made your own list and have felt strong negative\r\nemotions about many of the items on it.\r\n\r\nBut the point I wish to emphasize now is that the majority of these\r\nnegative emotions is caused directly or indirectly by man’s underlying\r\nand most distinguishing characteristic--his aggression. It is this\r\ntrait that most clearly defines him, and it is this trait that is at\r\nthe root of the frigid woman’s anger, fear of, and feeling of rejection\r\nby men.\r\n\r\nShe is antagonistic to this aggression because she does not understand\r\nit. Since she cannot understand or accept her own role, her feminine\r\nnature, she feels that male aggression is opposed to her and she takes\r\nevery opportunity to prove to herself that this is so. His strength,\r\nhis ability to master the outside environment make her feel personally\r\nnullified, a drab, a slavey. She endlessly contrasts his essential\r\nquality of aggression with woman’s essential traits, to her detriment.\r\n\r\nNow if men _were_ out to enslave them, women would be very justified\r\nin fearing, hating, envying man’s central strength, his aggressiveness.\r\nBut is he?\r\n\r\nA re-examination of this single point can put the whole basic attitude\r\nof the frigid woman (once she has allowed herself to feel the negative\r\npower of her emotions) back into proper perspective, to correct her\r\nfundamental distortion of view. We can do this by looking at the single\r\nmost important thing men do with their aggression in our society.\r\n\r\n“All men have nightmares.”\r\n\r\nI heard a fellow psychiatrist say those words during an impromptu\r\ndiscussion of male psychology recently, and the phrase struck me as\r\ndramatically true. For the majority of men, when they come of age and\r\nmarry, take on an enormous burden which they may not lay down with any\r\nconscience this side of the grave. Quietly and without histrionics\r\nthey put aside, in the name of love, most of their vaunted freedom\r\nand contract to take upon their shoulders full social and economic\r\nresponsibility for their wives and children.\r\n\r\nAs a woman, consider for a moment how you would feel if your child\r\nshould be deprived of the good things of life: proper housing,\r\nclothing, education. Consider how you would feel if he should go\r\nhungry. Perhaps such ideas have occurred to you and have given you\r\na bad turn momentarily. But they are passing thoughts; a woman does\r\nnot give them much credence; they are not her direct responsibility;\r\ncertainly she does not worry about them for long.\r\n\r\nBut such thoughts, conscious or unconscious, are her husband’s daily\r\nfare. He knows, and he takes the carking thought to work with him each\r\nmorning (and every morning) and to bed with him at night, that upon the\r\nsuccess or failure of his efforts rest the happiness, health, indeed\r\nthe very lives of his wife and children. In the ultimate sense he alone\r\nmust take the full responsibility for them.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is possible to exaggerate how seriously men take\r\nthis responsibility; how much they worry about it. Women, unless they\r\nare very close to their men, rarely know how heavily the burden weighs\r\nsometimes, for men talk about it but little. They do not want their\r\nloved ones to worry.\r\n\r\nMen have been shouldering the entire responsibility for their family\r\ngroup since earliest times. I often think, however, when I see the\r\nstresses and strains of today’s market place, that civilized man\r\nhas much harder going, psychologically speaking, than his primitive\r\nforefathers.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the competition creates a terrible strain on the\r\nindividual male. This competition is not only for preferment and\r\nadvancement. It is often for his very job itself. Every man knows that\r\nif he falters, lets up his ceaseless drive, he can and will be easily\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nNo level of employment is really free of this endless pressure. The\r\nexecutive must meet and exceed his last year’s quota or the quota of\r\nhis competitors. Those under him must see that he does it, and he\r\nscrutinizes their performances most severely and therefore constantly.\r\n\r\nProfessional men--doctors, lawyers, professors--are under no less\r\npressure for the most part. If the lawyer is self-employed he must\r\nconstantly seek new clients; if he works for an organization he must\r\nexert himself endlessly to avoid being superseded by ambitious peers\r\nor by pushing young particles just out of law school and filled with\r\nthe raw energy of youth. A score of unhappy contingencies can ruin\r\nor seriously threaten a doctor’s practice, not the least of which is\r\na possible breakdown in his ability to practice. A teacher must work\r\nlong hours on publishable projects outside of his arduous teaching\r\nassignments if he is to advance or even hold his ground.\r\n\r\nThere is no field of endeavor that a man may enter where he can count\r\non complete economic safety; competition, the need for unremitting\r\nyear-in, year-out performance, is his life lot. Over all this he\r\nknows, too, stands a separate specter upon which he can exert only the\r\nremotest control. It is the joblessness which may be caused by the\r\ncyclical depressions and recessions that characterize our economy.\r\n\r\nIt is true; all men have nightmares.\r\n\r\nFew if any women could take the kind of daily strain and worry men\r\ncommit themselves to when they sign the marriage contract. And no woman\r\nin her right mind would want to take it. It is true that many women go\r\ninto the market place, but most of them are waiting only for the day\r\nthat they marry, or they are already married. Those who stay of their\r\nown free will are few and far between, and in my experience some have\r\nproven to be difficult people in their family relationships, though\r\nsome of them are talented. Women are designed for duties different from\r\nthose of the market place, another kind of stress entirely, and lose or\r\ntend to lose their essential womanliness if they stay by choice.\r\n\r\nAs women look at man’s characteristic of aggressiveness in terms of\r\nthe tremendous duties, daily struggles, and awful responsibilities men\r\nmust and do assume, they can begin to call up in themselves a different\r\nemotion from anger or envy. They can begin to see how altogether worthy\r\nof their highest admiration man is. Not just some abstract man, either;\r\nthe man they love, the man they have married, the man upon whom they\r\nhave been heaping their criticism, their jealousy and rage.\r\n\r\nFar from seeking to enslave our sex, to exploit us through his strength\r\nand his aggression, man has put these two great and basic attributes\r\nentirely at our service. It is (and always has been) this fact that\r\nmakes it safe for us to be women, to bear his children with a sense of\r\nsecurity, to rear them, knowing that he is there, always and forever,\r\nearning our bread, watching over us ceaselessly, keeping his terrible\r\nanxieties about us and our safety to himself so that we will not worry\r\nas he does.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that boys are generally given their freedom a lot earlier\r\nthan girls. And it is also true that the quality of aggression in the\r\nmale makes him the wooer and the woman the wooed. I have yet to hear a\r\nwoman suffering from a frigidity problem who did not deeply resent both\r\nof these facts.\r\n\r\nBut now, looking at the end to which male aggression is directed when\r\nit matures, can any woman honestly hold onto such resentment? When she\r\nrealizes that society instinctively grants him more and earlier freedom\r\nso that he may develop the great self-reliance necessary to take on the\r\nresponsibilities of a family, she cannot validly hold this view any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nNor can she hold onto her resentment of the fact that it is generally\r\nthe male who initiates the sexual act. For it is the same male\r\naggression which protects her, allows her to be wife and mother, that\r\nmakes him the wooer and she the wooed. Again, knowing how easily women\r\nare distracted from sexual feeling by trivial upsets, by the small\r\nthings that occur during the day, imagine what would happen if women\r\nhad to take the male’s anxieties and yet be responsible for initiating\r\nsex at night. Should such a reversal of roles ever happen to mankind,\r\nthe world would soon be depopulated. Women must learn to thank God\r\ndaily for the enormous energy and drive of their men.\r\n\r\nIn terms of this lifelong commitment of man to the service of his wife\r\nand family, let us take another look at the things in his conduct\r\nwhich irritate women, or at least irritate women with a frigidity\r\nproblem, for now they begin to be understandable. Minor irritabilities,\r\ncock-of-the-walk behavior, slackness, sloppiness, whatever--these\r\nare either the outlets or the results of the accumulated tensions\r\nof a man’s day. He will not tell you of the humiliations or defeats\r\nor worries of his day in any direct manner usually. As his wife, you\r\nmust understand that these are the only remonstrances against his\r\nhard and anxious struggle that he will permit himself. If you see his\r\nbehavior in this light it will be difficult to harbor any deep-seated\r\nresentment against him; one can only wish to comfort him, to help in\r\nany conceivable way to make his burden less onerous, his worries less\r\nsharp, his nightmares less frequent.\r\n\r\nThe espousal of this view of the male, the accurate one, can be another\r\ngreat forward step toward femininity. Seeing her man’s aggression in\r\nits true light, aimed first and foremost at procuring her safety,\r\nhappiness, and security, she can now dare to take down, one by one, the\r\nprecarious defenses she has maintained against him from the beginning\r\nof their relationship. She sees that her husband’s wonderful aggression\r\nactually defines her true role, makes it ever clearer and more\r\ndesirable to her.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how her altered attitude can ultimately affect her and\r\nwhat she can do to hasten and further the process of change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 16_\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the frigid woman, using the methods described in this section,\r\nhas divested herself of the destructive fears and false convictions\r\nthat have been left over from her childhood; and when, in all honesty,\r\nshe is able to view her husband with new eyes, knowing him to be the\r\nhard-beset but loving human being he is rather than an abstract power\r\nshe had conjured up in his image--when these things are achieved, a\r\nprofound change begins to take place within her.\r\n\r\nThis change is not a direct product of her conscious will. Forces which\r\nhave the character of a tide suddenly freed of long-standing barricades\r\nnow begin to move irresistibly within her. She feels a new potentiality\r\ninside, intimations of an emotional richness she had not dared dream of.\r\n\r\nWhen such a process is loosed within a woman, we say that she is ready\r\nto surrender; that, indeed, surrender has already started within her.\r\nWhat does this mean?\r\n\r\nIt means, in the broadest sense, that at long last she is prepared to\r\nbecome a woman. It means that she is ready, indeed anxious, to yield to\r\nher biological and psychological destiny. She has ceased to fear her\r\nreal role, mentally, spiritually, and physically; ceased to resist it\r\nand ceased to resent it. Now she is ready to glory in it. She is ready\r\nto love.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman is ready for this final step she no longer needs any\r\nurging, any coaxing or coaching. Since this ultimate surrender to\r\nher true nature is so natural to a woman, she is often not entirely\r\nconscious of its varied manifestations. It is slow, cellular, tidal,\r\ncertainly unsubject to the conscious will.\r\n\r\nThough change is now largely going on outside one’s awareness, I should\r\nlike to emphasize, however, that this phase is very much a part of\r\nthe _process_ that was initiated with the first two steps--of airing\r\none’s emotions and fantasies and of revaluating one’s husband. We have\r\nfound that, for a woman whose whole mind and body are, for the first\r\ntime, taking the path nature intended, it is wise to be as conscious\r\nas possible of the process that is going on within her. Many of the\r\nfeelings are new and powerful and run counter to much of what she has\r\nexperienced and believed in before. New convictions, new insights, new\r\nprospects open up before her. This novel proliferation may be confusing\r\nor even frightening. Therefore, the more she understands the nature\r\nof her brave new inner world, the more thoroughly and swiftly can she\r\nclaim it for her own.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I should like to urge that those who are trying the\r\ntechniques advocated here continue with the regular daily sessions I\r\nmentioned at the beginning. At this point much of the mental activity\r\nin such sessions with oneself will be a simple matter of _watching_--of\r\nwatching the process unfold in oneself, even of celebrating these\r\nadvances of the unconscious.\r\n\r\nIn this role of constant observer, however, the conscious mind can\r\nalso be ready for more aggressive activity. Any tendencies of the old\r\npattern to reassert itself, for angers, fears, fantasies to come out\r\nin new guises, can thus be noted and dispensed with before any real\r\ndamage can be done. Such pullbacks are not only possible but usual, and\r\nit is well not to abandon the sessions with oneself until they have\r\ndisappeared entirely--or as entirely as they’re going to.\r\n\r\nThe process of inner growth that follows when a woman is ready to\r\nsurrender to her real nature, we have found, traces a rather clear\r\npattern. Some of the new feelings overlap, but mostly they emerge in\r\na given order, each unfolding separately but related to the other as\r\npetals to a bud. Let us take them in the usual order of their coming.\r\n\r\nAs the woman who has suffered from frigidity explodes her groundless\r\nfears one by one and explores a new attitude toward men, toward love,\r\ntoward motherhood, feels a new esteem for her husband--as all these\r\nthings happen, her lifelong _restlessness_ begins to depart. For\r\nthe first time she realizes just _how_ restless she has been, how\r\nunsatisfied; she feels how precariously balanced her life, inwardly and\r\noutwardly, has always felt. Now something deep within her relaxes, lets\r\ndown. When this happens she is beginning to experience the essential\r\nattribute of all that is truly feminine, spiritual tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of this tranquillity, or even the arrival of intimations of\r\nit results from the fact that she is really allowing herself to trust\r\nher husband in a very deep sense. It means that she finally realizes\r\nthat she no longer has to fear or to oppose his strength, but that\r\nshe can now rely on it to protect her, to give her the secure climate\r\nnecessary for the full flowering of her femininity.\r\n\r\nFeminine tranquillity of spirit is a grace and a beauty of the first\r\norder. It is the psychological cornerstone of the happy family. Based\r\non an abiding faith in the goodness and loyalty of her husband, it\r\nemanates from a woman who has found herself and pervades those about\r\nher, giving them unity and strength. The children of such a mother are\r\nstrong against the neurotic restlessness of these difficult times. The\r\nhusband of a wife who has achieved such tranquillity returns from his\r\nwork to his home as to an oasis, redoubles his loving efforts to make\r\nher ever more secure.\r\n\r\nBecause she can trust no man, the frigid woman’s approach to the\r\ntasks of life has a difficult, painful, frenetic quality. She feels\r\nresponsible for everything; guiltily responsible. Details and trivia\r\noverwhelm her. She has no unity and has to fight herself, her\r\nresentment, her self-rejection to get the simplest things done--her\r\nhousehold work, planning the dinner, carrying and fetching the\r\nchildren. Everything _looms_.\r\n\r\nWith the development of the new quality of tranquillity those details\r\nof life that once seemed so difficult become simple. And because they\r\nare feminine tasks, household work, planning or getting dinners,\r\nkeeping the children busy or in line--whatever life demands--soon lose\r\ntheir irksome and irritating quality and become easy, even joyful.\r\n\r\nAs tranquillity moves over to serenity, becomes more and more a part\r\nof her psychic character, a woman begins to realize what a miraculous\r\nand wonderful thing womanhood is. Most frequently this realization is\r\nushered in by a sudden awareness of the miracle that her body is able\r\nto perform: the miracle of childbirth.\r\n\r\nIn her frightened heart the frigid woman has always detested and feared\r\nher capacity to become pregnant. To her this faculty has seemed onerous\r\nand burdensome, a curse. In pregnancy she feels trapped, sick at heart\r\nand in body during it, increasingly frightened of delivery as the day\r\nof confinement approaches. She views all this as woman’s burden; men,\r\nthose enviable creatures, are free of such a frightening duty. Indeed,\r\nhas she not heard that men use pregnancy as a technique of keeping\r\nwomen subject to them! Thus she frets and rages and trembles, rejecting\r\nher destiny.\r\n\r\nBut with her new evaluation of her husband, the deepening of her sense\r\nof security, and the growth of her tranquillity, all this childish\r\nfrightened protest against the miracle of motherhood washes away. Now\r\nthe scales really fall from her eyes and she feels the full meaning and\r\nmajesty of what it means to be a woman.\r\n\r\nWhat a privilege it is, she realizes, to be the carrier of the\r\nrace, the agent of its immortality. What fate could be richer, more\r\nbeautiful, more filled with wonder and with awe.\r\n\r\nI am not exaggerating the importance of this realization. Pride in it,\r\njoy in it are the very most central characteristics of the feminine\r\nwoman. To me its highest expression is in the Madonna paintings which\r\nthe great Renaissance artists took, over and over again, as a major\r\nsubject. The Alba Madonna by Raphael catches the essential quality of\r\nfemininity, expresses it for all to see--and to revere.\r\n\r\nNow, with this realization, the last vestiges of her envy of the male\r\nand of his role in life disappear. How, she may wonder, with this\r\nmarvelous capability of hers, inimitable by man, could she ever have\r\ndepreciated the role of woman, wanted what men have?\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, or closely following on it, a woman begins to feel\r\nher full power, the power that comes to her for her surrender to her\r\ndestiny. She now realizes that, far from being in a weak position in\r\nrelationship to man, her position is so strong that she must be careful\r\nnot to exploit it. One of the deepest and strongest psychological needs\r\nof man is his poignant desire for immortality through his children.\r\nShe could deny him this, or she could make his life miserable while\r\ngranting him it. Or she can make it the most beautiful and meaningful\r\nthing in her life and in his.\r\n\r\nWhat this new realization means to a woman was stated very beautifully\r\nin a letter I received from a former patient. We had been able to\r\nwork only two weeks on her problem, for she came from a different\r\nsection of the country and could spend only that amount of time in New\r\nYork City. We worked quickly, and she had been able to surface the\r\nhostilities to and misapprehensions about men that had plagued her\r\ngrown-up life. I had been able also to give her a thumbnail sketch of\r\nthe problems and changes she might encounter within herself in the\r\nfuture--much as I have described them here. Within six months I had a\r\nletter from her. It described the step-by-step process I have depicted:\r\nthe change in her feelings toward her husband, the incredibly swift\r\ngrowth within her of the new and wonderful serenity. And then she had\r\ncome to the point where she realized with her whole emotional being the\r\nmiraculous nature of the female body and the feeling of power and glory\r\nthat it gave her.\r\n\r\n But [she wrote] this feeling of power was quickly followed by an\r\n intense feeling of humility. I thought of how I held within me, within\r\n my body, the power to bring him the greatest of joys; or to deprive\r\n him of it. And then I realized the terrible thing it would be to ever\r\n misuse this power. And now I felt really for the first time, despite\r\n my former lip service to the idea, the reason why marriage must be\r\n considered sacramental. The relationship between husband and wife\r\n which results in the unsolvable mystery of birth goes far beyond\r\n human understanding. To participate in this mystery really requires\r\n a consecration by both. Any lesser attitude toward it is like the\r\n laughter of mockery in a holy place.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of acceptance of her central role, changes now come\r\nrapidly to a woman. As she feels the unity of need and goal between\r\nher husband and herself, any remaining contentiousness leaves her. In\r\nthe marriage, consensus now becomes her aim. She is no longer afraid\r\nof losing an argument, fearful that she will be forced to do something\r\nthat is repugnant or humiliating to her, for she realizes that to her\r\nhusband her welfare is the dearest of all things. And, conversely, his\r\nhappiness and peace of mind become her first desire.\r\n\r\nAnd now she has tapped in on the greatest psychological joy of\r\nwoman--her capacity to give. If you remember, in an earlier chapter we\r\ncalled this “essential female altruism,” a characteristic rooted in\r\nevery woman’s biological nature. Women who are really secure within\r\nthemselves and in their roles have an inexhaustible store of this\r\naltruism. Frigid women fear this basic characteristic, feeling as they\r\ndo that men will exploit and abuse their desire to give.\r\n\r\nAs she reaps the rewards of her new capacity to give of herself\r\nunstintingly and fearlessly to her husband and her children, the very\r\nappearance of a woman often begins to change. Drawn expressions relax,\r\nanxious forehead wrinkles disappear, thin-lipped mouths soften. Indeed,\r\nher whole body rounds and softens, taking on the look associated with a\r\ntender and giving femininity.\r\n\r\nPhysical difficulties often disappear. I have known women who had been\r\nplagued with intense pre-menstrual and menstrual pains all their lives\r\nto lose such symptoms in a matter of weeks. I have known women whose\r\nirregular periods have become regularized. And I have also known women\r\nwith one or two desperately difficult pregnancies behind them who,\r\nbecoming pregnant again, went through the entire nine months not only\r\nwithout discomfort but with a highly accelerated feeling of pleasure\r\nand well-being.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the results, or some of them, that a woman who is\r\nwilling to give up the things of childhood and yield to her true self\r\nmay expect. The return on such an investment of self is enormous. It is\r\npaid in the coinage of love returned for love given; love from one’s\r\nhusband and children, love from friends, new and old, attracted by the\r\nendless largesse of the woman who has surrendered all to find all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 17_\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ability to achieve normal orgasm can be called the physical\r\ncounterpart of psychological surrender. In most cases of true frigidity\r\nit follows on a woman’s surrender of her rebellious and infantile\r\nattitudes as the day the night. It is the sign that she has given up\r\nthe last vestige of resistance to her nature and has embraced womanhood\r\nwith soul _and_ body.\r\n\r\nThe achievement of orgasm, usually, is the _last_ step in the process\r\nof growing up. If one reviews in one’s mind the actual orgastic\r\nexperience it is not difficult to see why this is so.\r\n\r\nFor a woman orgasm requires a trust in one’s partner that is absolute.\r\nRecall for a moment that the physical experience is often so profound\r\nthat it entails the loss of consciousness for a period of time. As\r\nwe know, in sexual intercourse, as in life, man is the actor, woman\r\nthe passive one, the receiver, the acted upon. Giving oneself up\r\nin this passive manner to another human being, making oneself his\r\nwilling partner to such seismic physical experiences, means one must\r\nhave complete faith in the other person. In the sexual embrace any\r\ntrace of buried hostility, fear of one’s role, will show clearly and\r\nunmistakably.\r\n\r\nBut there is even more to the psychic state necessary for orgasm than\r\nfaith in one’s partner and readiness to surrender. There must be a\r\nsensual eagerness to surrender, in the woman’s orgasm _the excitement\r\ncomes from the act of surrender_. There is a tremendous surging\r\nphysical ecstasy in the yielding itself, in the feeling of being the\r\npassive instrument of another person, of being stretched out supinely\r\nbeneath him, taken up will-lessly by his passion as leaves are swept up\r\nbefore a wind.\r\n\r\nThere can, it is clear, be no crossed fingers about such yielding, no\r\nreservations in such surrender. As one thinks of it one can certainly\r\nfeel why, of all the steps in the process of yielding, of surrendering,\r\nthe orgasm should be last. To those who are moving toward it the\r\nexperience often remains for a time elusive because its very totality,\r\nits uncompromising demand that the whole being be swept up in the\r\nexperience, remains somewhat frightening.\r\n\r\nOrgasm, as I have said, is the physical aspect of surrendering.\r\nHowever, while there are similarities between the physical and the\r\npsychological experience, there is also an important difference between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that orgasm cannot be sought entirely rationally. It\r\nwill arrive when it will arrive, as the end process of a total change\r\nin a frigid woman’s deepest psychological attitudes. It cannot be\r\nsought separately or as an end in itself. Indeed, to seek it directly,\r\nto wait upon it, to try to force it are the surest possible ways of\r\npostponing its arrival.\r\n\r\nThe idea that orgasm can be forced is typical of the thinking of a\r\nfrigid woman. We have seen that, because she is basically frightened,\r\nbasically mistrusts her husband’s love of her and her own femininity,\r\nshe has to feel that she is “in control” all the time. The trouble with\r\nthat standpoint is that in real orgasm a woman must be out of control;\r\nmust willfully, delightedly desire to be entirely so.\r\n\r\nThe delusion that the orgasm can or should be sought as an end in\r\nitself and not as the result of a deep inner change of the kind\r\ndiscussed in the preceding chapters of this section has been fostered\r\nby many of the books which have dealt with the problem of frigidity\r\nor with the role or responsibility of woman in marriage. One recent\r\nbook counseled the conscious contraction of certain muscles during\r\nintercourse, holding that this would heighten sexual pleasure. Other\r\nbooks emphasize the importance of position during intercourse. Their\r\ntacit or stated contention is that orgastic potency can be achieved by\r\nmechanical means.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that concentrating on one’s sensations during\r\nintercourse, wondering if one is feeling the “right” feeling, can\r\ndestroy real sexual passion more completely than any technique I can\r\nthink of. We know this from scores of patients. Such a clinical and\r\nobjective attitude toward local sexual sensations merely reflects\r\nthe frigid woman’s need to be in control of a situation and her fear\r\nof surrendering herself to her man. She can get little more from\r\nthis obsessive scrutiny of her sexual reactions than an even more\r\nfrustrating experience than usual.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, an attitude one can take toward orgasm before one\r\nhas achieved it? Yes, there is, and we have found it a helpful and\r\nproductive one. This attitude may be summarized in this fashion: If one\r\nhas truly pursued the goal of self-surrender, uprooting and exposing\r\nattitudes left over from childhood and youth, the ability to achieve\r\norgasm must inevitably arrive. Until that time, and particularly during\r\nintercourse, _one must put the matter out of one’s mind entirely_.\r\n\r\nThe growth of a woman’s ability to have orgasm is a natural growth. It\r\nhas been impeded by her psychic attitudes; it resumes its development\r\nwhen these attitudes change. It is as natural a move as the move\r\nfrom winter to spring. Gradually she finds herself allowing her new\r\ntenderness and concern for her husband to become a part of the meaning\r\nof her sexual embrace. She sees and feels the pleasure her sexual\r\nthawing brings him, and this process becomes circular, his increased\r\npleasure giving her more pleasure. And with his pleasure in mind she\r\nnow seeks out more and more those things that please him, and her\r\nexploration leads inevitably to the discovery that what pleases him\r\nmost, outside of his own sensations, is her pleasure. This mutual\r\nspiraling of feeling ultimately climaxes in her unconscious decision\r\nto give him the greatest psychological pleasure of all, her total\r\nsurrender to the delights he can bring her.\r\n\r\nFor many women the ability to surrender physically comes rather\r\nswiftly; to others it is a very gradual process, as though the\r\nunconscious mind needed to build up a reserve of reassurances before it\r\nfelt perfectly secure. In either case, but particularly in the latter,\r\nthey can be forewarned of one important thing: sexual thaw will not\r\nproceed uninterruptedly; there is no straight line from frigidity to\r\ntrue womanhood. I should like to explain this more fully.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the sexual embrace, a woman allows herself to experience more\r\npleasure as her physical sensations increase, a part of her unconscious\r\nmind very frequently takes alarm and causes her to draw back from any\r\nfurther immediate advance.\r\n\r\nIf you stop to ponder this point you will find it readily\r\nunderstandable in terms of our former discussions. The experiences\r\nand relationships upon which frigidity is based took place a long\r\ntime ago, often in very early childhood. They occasioned fear in the\r\nchild, fear of sexuality, of surrender to one’s sensual impulses, or\r\npowerful guilt. Now, as one starts to move toward a resumption of one’s\r\nsensuality, it is almost certain that these irrational, buried fears\r\nwill try to reassert themselves.\r\n\r\nIn most cases it is not necessary to uncover the childhood incidents\r\nupon which these fears were based. If one will insist on pursuing\r\nthe techniques for inner change I have described here, these fears\r\nwill finally become inoperative in the sexual area. It is, however,\r\nnecessary to know that you _are_ experiencing such fears. Generally\r\nspeaking, they do not show themselves directly. A woman will not say to\r\nherself: “That new sensual experience I had last night is causing me\r\nalarm.”\r\n\r\nThe fear separates itself from the sensual experience and expresses\r\nitself indirectly. The woman may find herself once again becoming\r\nquarrelsome, critical of her husband; old feelings of deprivation or of\r\ninferiority may reassert themselves with apparently new vigor. And the\r\nnew sensual capacity may retire once more from view. The reason: the\r\nold defenses are protecting one against the new femininity.\r\n\r\nSuch anxiety reactions, I wish to make clear, should not give any\r\nreal cause for concern. Indeed, one does not have to analyze them or\r\nto investigate them. One merely has to be _aware_ that they _are_ the\r\nresult of the new advance in sensuality, the new ability to surrender\r\noneself a bit more completely than formerly. Advance of this kind is\r\nnever lost in any final sense.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example of a typical reaction to such an advance.\r\nThe patient was of the type I call the clitoridal woman. Her orgasm had\r\nbeen exclusively clitoral. Together we had covered the ground that I\r\nhave presented in this section. She had been able to air her feelings\r\nabout men and about woman’s lot; she had corrected her view of men and,\r\nin a very real way, had begun to view her husband with the eyes of a\r\nloving woman. Then one day she came to me in great excitement. It was\r\nunmistakable, she told me; during last night’s love-making she had\r\nfelt, for the first time in her life, distinctly pleasurable vaginal\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\nBut in the next session her attitude was entirely different. She had\r\nhad a quarrel with her husband over some trivial matter, and she\r\nforthwith launched into the kind of tirade against men I had not heard\r\nfrom her for several sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter letting her air her feelings, I pointed out to her the possible\r\nconnection between her new sensual experience and her regression to\r\nher old defenses. She was incredulous and remained so until, a week\r\nlater, the episode repeated itself in its entirety: vaginal sensations\r\nand delight, followed quickly by a quarrel and ill feelings toward her\r\nhusband. Forewarned, she was now on guard for such negative reactions,\r\nand when they did appear, knowing their significance, she was able to\r\nhandle them, prevent herself from actually acting out her irrational\r\nfeelings by quarreling with her husband.\r\n\r\nIn making the above point I do not wish to be misunderstood or\r\nthought to be contradicting myself. I am not advising women to fixate\r\nobsessively on their new sexual sensations. However, noticing such new\r\nexperiences will be unavoidable, and I am simply saying that it is\r\nhelpful to know that they may be followed by minor neurotic regressions.\r\n\r\nThe above observations now lead me to a closely related matter which I\r\nconsider to be of central importance.\r\n\r\nIn the move toward womanhood there comes a juncture in most cases\r\nwhich can be called “the danger point.” When a woman is working with\r\na therapist on her problem, the danger when she reaches this point is\r\nminimized by the fact that her therapist is aware of the problem and\r\ncan usually help her to handle it when it arises. If a woman is working\r\non her problem by herself, however, she should be strongly forewarned\r\nof her potential reaction.\r\n\r\nThis danger point generally comes when a woman who has suffered from\r\nfrigidity has at last allowed herself to experience orgasm for the\r\nfirst time. Her immediate reaction is one of tremendous relief. But\r\nthis is almost always followed by the same kind of regression I have\r\ndescribed above; only this time the pull-back from her own advance and\r\nfrom her husband is far more powerful. We have seen in some of the case\r\nhistories in the last section just how dangerous this period can be to\r\nthe entire relationship. Indeed, the wife may at this point precipitate\r\na crisis of such severity that the marriage itself is endangered.\r\n\r\nThe form the difficulty takes is always individual; it is usually an\r\nexaggerated version of the particular woman’s most typical neurotic\r\ncharacteristic. If she is argumentative, she is apt to start a fight\r\nof proportions heretofore undreamed of. If her tendency is to become\r\ndepressed, her melancholy can become very, very profound indeed. If\r\nshe is critical and carping, she can make Craig’s wife appear to be a\r\nnormal, healthy woman.\r\n\r\nI am not exaggerating. It is not impossible that many divorces are\r\ncaused by wives who, by the natural reassurance that marriage to a\r\ntender husband often brings, have moved close to their true natures\r\nall unwittingly. They achieve orgasm; and then, without the benefit of\r\nany insight, the intense anxiety reaction sets in, causing a powerful\r\ndesire to flee from the frightening situation.\r\n\r\nThe pull-back, of course, is caused by an exacerbation of early fears\r\nbrought on by the orgasmic experience. But again I must emphasize\r\nthat the chief danger during this period of reaction lies in the fact\r\nthat the woman sees no connection between her emotional upset and\r\nthe successful sexual experience she has just achieved. Why should\r\nshe see such a connection? Orgasm is what she has been consciously\r\nwaiting for, has it not? It would only be surprising if she did see a\r\nconnection between the two experiences.\r\n\r\nHer emotional outburst represents, at this point, an inner panic.\r\nConsider this: in the course of growing up it took her years to\r\nconstruct a defensive system against a feminine sensuality which she\r\nhad learned was dangerous or wicked. Though this defensive system (her\r\nfrigidity, her psychological rejection of men, etc.) had deprived\r\nher of much, it had at least allowed her to feel secure in some deep\r\nmanner; she has maintained her defenses in order to hold onto her\r\nfeeling of unconscious security.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with orgasm, she feels all these defenses swept away in a\r\nmoment. She feels exposed, guilty, naked to her imaginary enemy,\r\ntempted to surrender to him completely. In her panic she forgets the\r\nadvance she has been making, the revaluation of her attitude toward\r\nmen, children, womanhood.\r\n\r\nShe cannot admit the irrational nature of her unconscious fear, even to\r\nherself, so she represses it and creates an exterior diversion. Real\r\ntrouble is always an excellent defense against insight.\r\n\r\nIn the case histories I have given of frigid women you will recall\r\nthat the discovery of true feminine sexuality within her often brought\r\na woman to therapy. In a sense the therapist, at the beginning,\r\nrepresents a safe harbor, a protection against the woman’s frightening\r\nfemininity. Coming for help is, in part, a kind of flight in itself; a\r\nsearch for a place to hide.\r\n\r\nWhen women do not understand the nature of their actions in such cases,\r\nthe flight can take a potentially harmful direction. I have known some\r\nwho “fall in love” with another man at this juncture. Others feel\r\nthat they have really discovered just how incompatible their husbands\r\nare and think seriously of divorce. Still others develop somatic\r\ndifficulties, sometimes serious ones. I know two women who had had\r\ntuberculosis during adolescence and who both broke down again during\r\nthis “danger point.” In both cases their disease had been considered\r\ntotally arrested.\r\n\r\nI realize, of course, that such reactions sound alarming to a reader.\r\nHowever, my intention in stating the facts here is not to frighten\r\nbut to forewarn. There is nothing in _reality_ to be alarmed about.\r\nFeelings are not reality. But a woman must be certain that she does not\r\nact upon her feelings. The only danger is that she might.\r\n\r\nBut, I am often asked, how can one cope with such fears, fears so deep\r\none does not even dare to let them into the conscious mind? The answer\r\nis that, generally speaking, you do not have to cope with them in any\r\nactive way. They will pass. All you have to do is to sit tight, so to\r\nspeak. The unconscious will in fairly short order (a week, a month)\r\ncalm down.\r\n\r\nReality, a good reality, can prove to the infantile unconscious that it\r\nhas nothing to fear. When one has quieted again, resumed the straight\r\nline of progress one had been pursuing, orgasm will occur again.\r\nThis time the reaction of alarm is generally far less. By the third\r\nand fourth times it has become virtually nonexistent. The neurotic,\r\ndefensive portion of one’s mind has then been permanently disarmed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll frigidities are basically related. We could prescribe no general\r\napproach that would be helpful if this were not so. However, I have\r\nfound that there are specific measures that can be of great value if\r\napplied to the individual kinds of frigidity. Indeed, if these measures\r\nare omitted, the return to full feminine maturity can be slowed down\r\ndramatically or even stopped, at least on the sexual level.\r\n\r\nI must warn once again, however, that one should be careful to put\r\nno reliance on these techniques if they are not combined with the\r\n“feeling through” and revaluative processes I have described. With\r\nthis in mind, then, let us examine these measures that can be taken by\r\nindividual types.\r\n\r\nFirst let us look at the _masculine type_. As we have seen both in our\r\nabstract description and in our case-history approach to this type, the\r\nonly method of gratification possible for this woman is clitoral. She\r\nachieves climax through self-masturbation or through masturbation by\r\nher husband. She has few if any vaginal sensations during intercourse,\r\nand her orgasmic reactions are confined entirely to the clitoris. This\r\nis so even if she is able to establish contact between her clitoris\r\nand her husband’s penis in intercourse. In most cases vaginal entrance\r\nof the penis is a matter of indifference to such women; to some it is\r\nactively disliked.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how women establish this erotic primacy of the clitoris.\r\nBecause of early fears connected with becoming women they have firmly\r\nrejected the vagina. They have held onto infantile and pubertal\r\nmasturbation long past the point when it is normal for a girl to give\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nNow, with a new evaluation of the meaning of feminine sexuality, with\r\na new tenderness and warmth toward their husbands available to them,\r\nthe time at length comes when it is possible for them to switch from\r\nclitoral sensations to vaginal. However, the pathways for satisfaction\r\nhave been set up for many years, the “habit” of clitoral climax has\r\nbeen deeply established. What should they do?\r\n\r\nWe have found that, if the clitoridal woman wishes to achieve a more\r\nmature form of sexual satisfaction she may be aided in reaching her\r\ngoal if she can give up the form of gratification she now employs. This\r\nform of gratification still symbolizes an attachment to the earlier\r\nform of sexuality. For that reason, of course, it is a defense against\r\nthe type of sexuality that stands for psychic maturity. The simple\r\ndecision to abandon the less mature form of gratification often\r\nsignifies a deep decision within a woman: the decision to take the\r\nfinal step toward womanhood.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many women experience the abandonment of clitoral\r\ngratification as a keen deprivation and deeply resent it. In such cases\r\nthe resentment signifies that they have not sufficiently “felt through”\r\ntheir childhood defenses against femininity.\r\n\r\nObviously there are only two possible steps to take: one can continue\r\nthe practice of masturbation or one can examine the resentment that\r\nis caused by giving it up. If a woman decides on the first step,\r\nprogress toward the goal of vaginal orgasm may be slowed down or halted\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIf, however, one decides to examine the resentment more closely, using\r\nthe “feeling through” technique I have described, the bases upon\r\nwhich the resentment rests may be discovered and disposed of, just\r\nas resentments against men and against motherhood were disposed of.\r\nIndeed, many of the same feelings, though now more specifically related\r\nto sexuality, often come out.\r\n\r\nLet me give an example. A patient with a clitoridal fixation had worked\r\nthrough many of her negative feelings toward her husband; she had seen\r\nthat these feelings had been based on an irrational envy and fear of\r\nmen and a depreciation of women. Her progress, however, seemed to halt\r\ncompletely when she attempted to give up clitoral masturbation.\r\n\r\nAll of her early feelings toward men returned, only now they referred\r\nto the act of intercourse. Men were the lucky ones; they were on top.\r\nJust as in life. Woman’s classical sexual position in our civilization\r\n(on the bottom) was “degrading and humiliating.” It represented her\r\nposition vis-à-vis men in life. As in life, men were the ones for whom\r\nirresponsible enjoyment was designed; no wonder they could enjoy sex so\r\nmuch; and they couldn’t get pregnant; they didn’t have to menstruate,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nShe aired these irrational feelings quite completely and saw them for\r\nwhat they were. She saw that they were a recapitulation, in sexual\r\nterms, of the negative feelings she had expressed earlier toward\r\nmen. She realized, too, that her feeling that it was humiliating and\r\ndegrading to be “on the bottom” really showed her deep distress, fear\r\nof, and underlying depression about what she took to be woman’s role in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe patient was rather surprised to see these irrational feelings\r\nreappearing. However, because of her earlier work on her psychological\r\ndefenses, it was not too difficult for her to dispose of these negative\r\nattitudes toward the sexual act and to integrate her positive feelings\r\nabout womanhood with woman’s sexual role. At that point she was not far\r\nfrom achieving vaginal orgasm. Within a month or so she had achieved it.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman consciously abandons clitoral gratification in favor of\r\nher search for a deeper and more abiding joy, the switch from clitoris\r\nto vagina usually takes place gradually. I have known cases in which it\r\nhas happened rather quickly, but it is more frequently a matter of two,\r\nthree, or even more months.\r\n\r\nOne further word on this type: the clitoridal woman may discover that\r\nshe cannot take the final step to vaginal primacy alone. She may need\r\ndirect and expert counsel. This should in no way discourage her. The\r\nproblem is a deep-seated one, but it almost certainly can be resolved.\r\nIf after a few months of trying to handle the problem alone one finds\r\nout that too little progress is being achieved, I strongly urge that\r\noutside help be sought (see Addenda I, page 260, for methods of\r\nobtaining the correct kind of aid).\r\n\r\nI have heard the therapy for _total frigidity_ described as “a problem\r\nin rerearing.” Recalling the case history of Patricia Agnew, one can\r\neasily see why this phrase is so apt. The causes of this kind of\r\nfrigidity go back to infancy. Punishment for infantile masturbation\r\nand/or an overly strong early fixation on the male parent causes the\r\nchild to repress her sexual feeling entirely. She does not go through,\r\nin any complete way, the normal stages of psycho-sexual development; a\r\npart of her, the sensual and sexual part, remains frozen in the bud.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, psychotherapy is frequently indicated when the frigidity\r\nis of this total type. The sexual aspect of the problem is sometimes\r\ntoo deeply seated for the individual to handle alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, I know of several women who, when therapy was not possible,\r\nwere able to make great strides toward truly feminine values and\r\nbehavior by adopting the procedures described in this section. Though\r\nsome of them were not able to achieve orgasm, the psychological change\r\nthey were able to effect in their personalities added greatly to their\r\ngeneral happiness and security in marriage. A few even were able to\r\nachieve orgasm.\r\n\r\nFor women with this form and degree of frigidity who wish to or must\r\nattempt to approach their problem without outside aid, I should like to\r\npoint out that if general sexual development is resumed it will tend\r\nto recapitulate the stages of psycho-sexual growth we have described.\r\nThus we find that when such women, through insight, are once again\r\nable to experience sensual feeling they sometimes go through a period\r\nof self-masturbation. Recall that this stage had been omitted in their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nI should like to emphasize that, in terms of the final resolution of\r\nher sexual frigidity, this masturbation is perfectly normal for this\r\nkind of woman--just as it is contraindicated for the masculine or\r\nclitoridal woman. The totally frigid woman is making up for phases\r\nof development she had missed in growing up. Guilt feelings about\r\nmasturbation in such cases are harmful, and the ego of the individual\r\ncan be put in the service of overcoming such emotions. For those who\r\nhave moral feelings against masturbation it is sometimes helpful\r\nto realize that modern scientific findings indicate that societal\r\nprohibitions against it were partly based on insufficient and incorrect\r\ninformation. It was believed for centuries that pubertal or infantile\r\nmasturbation was harmful physically and mentally. It has now been\r\nclearly demonstrated, however, that the only harm of any kind that can\r\ncome from masturbation is the psychological harm that is caused by\r\nguilt feelings connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, in attempting to establish her lost sexuality,\r\nthe totally frigid woman may be helped by encouraging, any\r\nsensuality, however meager, she may discover in herself, whether it\r\nis psychological or physical. The sensuous feelings engendered by\r\nsun-bathing, of the press of the earth under one when lying down in a\r\nfield or under a tree, the soft beauty of the moon on a hazy night, the\r\nwarmth and coziness of a fireplace as the rain beats upon the roof--if\r\nshe will allow her body and mind to enjoy these kinds of things, they\r\ncan help to awaken her dormant sensuality, can help her to move back\r\nfrom her dusty sensationless condition toward a reappreciation of the\r\nglory of the senses.\r\n\r\nSome women may discover (if they can consciously dispense with their\r\ninhibitions or with a hindering sense of propriety) that they are\r\nable to experience sensual feelings of a moderately keen nature in\r\nareas which are secondarily erotic. During our work together one woman\r\nsuddenly discovered that she enjoyed having her back stroked by her\r\nhusband. Another discovered that though she could not enjoy kissing\r\nher husband if she was in bed with him she could if she remained\r\nfully clothed in the living room. A third was able to respond quite\r\nstrongly to clitoral stroking if she had a drink of liquor with her\r\nhusband beforehand. In each case the sensual capacities described in\r\nthese women preceded their work with me. But it was only when they\r\nrealized that they possessed unexplored potentialities and that these\r\ncould be used to enrichen their sensual lives, to move them closer to\r\nthe ultimate experience of love, did they dare to take their first\r\ntentative steps toward maturity.\r\n\r\nAs we have observed, _partial frigidity_ includes those degrees of\r\nfrigidity that lie between total frigidity and normalcy. This includes\r\nsuch a large range of sexual reaction (or the lack of it) that it would\r\nnot be possible to describe specific measures that would be helpful in\r\nall cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who find they are closer to total frigidity on this\r\nscale than to normalcy often discover that the general techniques just\r\ndescribed are helpful. Many of these, if they persevere, will find that\r\nthey will ultimately achieve orgasm without requiring psychotherapy.\r\nOthers, after determining the distance they can go on their own, may\r\nwish to seek outside help.\r\n\r\nFor those who lie closer to normal feminine sexual reactions it is\r\nusually sufficient to persist in the techniques for self-discovery and\r\nself-realization described earlier in this section.\r\n\r\nAs we saw when we examined _psychic frigidity_, it seemed to be the\r\nexception that proved the rule. Women of this type are able to have\r\norgasms that are apparently normal. But they cannot form a relationship\r\nwith any man that will endure. They frequently select ineligible men as\r\npartners or, if by chance the man happens to become eligible, they will\r\nthen flee the relationship. If they cannot flee it they become sexually\r\nfrigid.\r\n\r\nWe have found that women with this type of frigidity can help\r\nthemselves by denying themselves the easy gratification to which they\r\nare accustomed. Their facile sensuality is a red herring used to\r\ndisguise their real fears from themselves. They can come to grips\r\nwith these fears only when they allow themselves to enter a close\r\npsychological relationship with an eligible member of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have called the steps by which a woman moves from frigidity to\r\nemotional and sexual maturity a “process.” Once really started, it\r\ntends, almost by inertia, to complete itself, needing only a kind of\r\nminimal guidance from one’s intelligence and a few specific facts.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity, then, let us review what the steps in this\r\nprocess are.\r\n\r\nIt is launched by the surfacing of negative emotions and fantasies from\r\nwhich the frigid woman has been hiding. These emotions and fantasies\r\nreflect an underlying attitude toward the opposite sex which is based\r\non early childhood fears and misunderstandings and which is seriously\r\naffecting one’s ability to love. As the emotions are exposed to full\r\nview they lose their power for harm, for it is only when they are\r\npartially or totally hidden from oneself that their primitive force\r\nis dangerous. When they are exposed to the light of intelligence and\r\njudgment, their power over one can at first be greatly reduced and\r\nfinally can be disposed of entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen all or most of one’s negative daydreams and emotions have been\r\nexposed, step two can be taken. This is a revaluation of the male in\r\nterms of his real nature and real goals. We saw that his real nature\r\nis basically aggressive, and one of his chief aims in life is to put\r\nthis aggression to work for his wife and family. Viewed from this\r\nstandpoint, man’s differences from woman are seen in their true light.\r\nThe frigid woman, from this revaluation, learns that she can now let\r\ndown her defenses, knowing that her husband, far from being hostile or\r\nwishing to enslave or exploit her, is her loving ally. She sees that\r\nhis once-feared aggression is the very thing that makes it really safe\r\nfor her to be a woman.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization, on a deep level of her personality, the next\r\nstep follows naturally. She first achieves a tranquillity and then a\r\nserenity she had not known before. This is followed by an acceptance of\r\nand a surrender to her real role--that of a loving and wise wife who\r\nglories in her womanly functions and in her man’s love.\r\n\r\nThe last step was seen to be the achievement of orgasm as a natural\r\nsequel to her psychological maturation. This part of the process we\r\nsaw was attended by a resurgence of early anxiety when orgasm finally\r\noccurred. This anxiety caused a desire to flee from the newly acquired\r\nability to love. However, the only danger at this juncture was seen to\r\nbe the possibility that the anxious woman might act upon her fears.\r\nForewarned of this reaction, she is forearmed, and by seeking further\r\ninsights and waiting out the anxiety she will find that it will\r\ngradually subside completely.\r\n\r\nThese general steps, then, outline the process that can lead to\r\nrecovery. I can add little to them. I have seen this method work for\r\nmany women and I know of no other that will.\r\n\r\nPatience and faith are the prime requisites for emotional maturation.\r\nNobody can name the time it will take for any given individual to cross\r\nthe bridge to womanhood. But that most women can cross it, there can be\r\nno doubt. Those who have gone before make that point ultimately clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 18_\r\n\r\nTHE ROLE OF THE MALE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a woman decides to cross the bridge from frigidity to mature\r\nfemininity her husband’s attitudes, feelings, and reactions can be\r\nall-important.\r\n\r\nI said earlier that we have found that the man is rarely responsible\r\nfor his wife’s frigidity; that it developed long before he met\r\nher. However, he must understand that, when she begins to assume\r\nresponsibility for her difficulty, responsibilities of a new kind are\r\nthrust on him too. In the beginning at least, and contrary to what he\r\nmight expect of himself, he may not like these responsibilities at all.\r\nHe may find that he has a very negative attitude toward his wife’s\r\nattempt to mature, that indeed he does not want her to.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary for a man to understand the elements that make\r\nhis role appear to him to be very difficult during such a period. In\r\na sense, if the project is to succeed, he must be as aware of his\r\nreactions as his wife is of hers.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the main elements of his reactions?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the husband of a frigid woman generally has a\r\ngreat store of repressed resentment toward his wife. This is quite\r\nunderstandable, of course. He has been the chief recipient of her very\r\nstrong negative feelings toward life, people, love, and sex.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the frigid woman has a strong tendency to blame others\r\nfor her difficulties. Her husband, doubtlessly, has received his full\r\nquota of such irrational blame from her. He has also been the main\r\nvictim of all the other neurotic components of frigidity--the envy and\r\nmistrust she has of the entire male sex, the endless complaints she\r\ndirects against her household duties, her general inability to handle\r\neven the trivia of every woman’s everyday life with any grace or ease.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her quarreling and complaints he has had to accept a\r\ntremendous amount of emotional frustration. Frigidity does not permit\r\nmuch honest or real interpersonal warmth, and the male has had to do\r\nwithout a normal amount of affection. His sexual frustration, too, is\r\ngreat. We saw in the case of the clitoridal woman just how laborious\r\nand boring the act of love can become to the man. It is not necessary\r\nto labor the point of how cumulatively bleak sexual intercourse with an\r\nunresponding partner can become.\r\n\r\nAll this (and more) that a man has gone through with a frigid wife\r\nmust have a very definite effect on him. He builds up attitudes and\r\ndevelops defenses which allow him to preserve his equilibrium within\r\nthe framework of his marriage as it is.\r\n\r\nSome of these defenses are psychological, some external.\r\n\r\nThe chief psychological defense he uses is a general withdrawal; he\r\npulls back from “caring” about the unhappy circumstances of his married\r\nlife. He may cease to react, either to his wife’s attacks on him or\r\nto her general complaints. He may cease, too, to care very much about\r\nthe failure of their sexual life. His withdrawal from the problem\r\nmay be marked by actual sexual impotence with his wife. Or he may,\r\nin response to his wife’s rejection of sex, take a purely mechanical\r\nattitude toward intercourse, getting it over with as quickly as\r\npossible, taking it like a hurried but necessary meal.\r\n\r\nHis external defenses against his home life may be a withdrawal from\r\nit. He may reorganize his social life around a men’s social or athletic\r\nclub, spending a great deal of time with “the boys.” He may take to\r\ndrinking at bars in the evening, forming a circle of cronies whom he\r\nlikes to be with. He may do any of a number of things that take him out\r\nof his home in the evening and give him substitute pleasures.\r\n\r\nNow of course there is nothing the least bit reprehensible about\r\nthe erection of such defenses if one’s marriage and home life are\r\nunsatisfactory. Indeed, such defenses may keep a marriage together by\r\nallowing the man to get some compensatory pleasures out of life.\r\n\r\nOne husband said just this in so many words to me recently. “If I\r\nhadn’t taken a firm stand within myself,” he told me, “the marriage\r\nwould have broken up long ago. I simply decided that, if things were\r\nto work out at all, I just had to pull back from her and not take what\r\nshe said to me seriously. If I went on believing half of the attacks\r\nshe made on me I couldn’t have lived with myself. And since sex was\r\nno fun, what was there left between us? I’ve made up a social life of\r\nsorts outside of the family for myself. At least I get a little fun out\r\nof life, and since I’m not around mainly I’m not boring her so much and\r\nshe’s not boring me so much.”\r\n\r\nBut the danger is that such defenses and such compensatory activities\r\nwill be held onto even if the marriage has been given a chance to turn\r\nfrom a meaningless one into a deeply meaningful and joyful one. A\r\nhusband who wishes to help his wife in her struggle to become a woman,\r\nwho wishes to make a marriage where only the semblance of one now\r\nexists, must now examine his attitudes with great honesty, courage, and\r\nthoroughness.\r\n\r\nThe way ahead of him at the beginning will not be by any means clear\r\nor easygoing. The initial progress of his wife as she undertakes to\r\nchange is often barely perceptible. Why should he have any hope that\r\nanything new, exciting, or beautiful could develop from such tentative\r\nstarts? And what motive can he develop to turn back, emotionally and\r\nsexually, to a woman who has so often and so thoroughly rejected and\r\nfrustrated him? A very strong part of him feels that he has worked\r\nout a precarious inner and outer equilibrium which at least keeps\r\nthis semblance of marriage from falling apart entirely. He generally\r\nactively resents the demand on him to alter his attitude, to see his\r\nwife through the inner odyssey on which she now wishes to embark.\r\n\r\nWe have found that at such a juncture a husband is often helped to\r\nalter his defensive attitude by seriously reflecting on the picture of\r\nmarriage and love he had when he first fell in love with his wife. He\r\nshould then compare that image of a relationship with the custom-staled\r\nand defeated feelings he has now, compare his first hopes of creatively\r\nshared lives with the empty realities of the present, the time-wasting,\r\nessentially loveless activities he now engages in.\r\n\r\nMemories and thoughts of this kind can make him angry, the way a _man_\r\ncan get angry, healthfully and aggressively; not at his wife, who now\r\nwants to make up for all that has been lost, but at himself for his\r\npassive acceptance and easy adjustment to a defeated life, a life that\r\nhas become a resigned and pointless existence. Such anger is good\r\nbecause it can clear his inner atmosphere; it can start him back with\r\nrenewed resolution on the road to his real desires. For no man who\r\nfeels worthy of his manhood ever really accepts a half existence in\r\nlove of the kind I have just depicted.\r\n\r\nWe have found, too, that such husbands can remotivate themselves if\r\nthey will contemplate the potentialities of womanhood toward which\r\ntheir wives now consciously aspire. I have tried throughout this\r\nbook to show, in some of their variety, the magnificent and exciting\r\nqualities that characterize true womanhood. I have shown how giving\r\nwomen can be in their love, how supportive, how filled with deep warmth\r\nand understanding. And I have tried to show how, in sex itself, there\r\nis no responsiveness that can compare even remotely with that of a\r\nloved and emotionally secure woman. If at this critical point in his\r\nmarriage a man can clarify what he really wants and then develop the\r\npatience to wait for it, he will be most thoroughly rewarded.\r\n\r\nPatience is _very_ important. He will need all of it he can muster\r\nfor a time and, at certain points, he may have to remind himself\r\nhard of the rewards at the end of the journey. He can, we find, be\r\ngreatly helped by having as thorough a knowledge as possible of the\r\npsychological problems his wife will encounter in her hegira to\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nI have shown that the path to feminine maturity is not a straight one.\r\nThe traveler will often become frightened of the very progress she is\r\nmaking and for a short time will tend to pull back into her former\r\nneurotic defenses. At such a point the husband must be very clear that\r\nshe has not pulled back for good.\r\n\r\nThe critical period, as we have seen, in a woman’s forward march,\r\nthe thing that is apt to make her pull back most strongly and with\r\nmost anxiety, is her first encounter with real orgasm. However, the\r\nhusband must realize once more that this regression is temporary, too,\r\neven though it lasts for several weeks or, in some cases, longer. The\r\nsolicitude of her husband at this point and the reassurance she gets\r\nfrom the knowledge of his love can be the main factors in her final\r\nvictory over her difficulty.\r\n\r\nMany psychiatrists make it a practice to discuss with husbands,\r\nwhenever it is feasible, the importance of their role in the complete\r\nrecovery of their wives. It is a very rare man who, after such\r\ndiscussions, cannot or will not mobilize his resources to aid his wife\r\nand to see her through her hard struggle. And I know of no woman who\r\nhas won a victory over her frigidity who has ignored the fact that her\r\nhusband’s help was decisive.\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing his defensive attitude toward his wife (or\r\nperhaps searching for and recapturing his earlier feelings toward\r\nher), in what other ways can a husband be helpful to his wife as she\r\nstruggles toward maturity?\r\n\r\nI would say that the primary virtue he should cultivate in himself is\r\nsensitivity, particularly sensitivity to any advances or changes in her\r\nmanner of relating to him, to their children, or to friends in their\r\nimmediate circle. She is trying to rid herself of a lifelong mistrust\r\nof men and fear of them. She is trying to dare to be soft, warm, and\r\ngiving. Every recognition she gets for her efforts will be like manna\r\nto her. In many ways she is like a frightened child, and only total\r\nacceptance can give her enough courage to advance further.\r\n\r\nLet me give a simple example of what I mean: The relationship between\r\na woman patient of mine and her husband had, in the course of their\r\nfive-year marriage, deteriorated sadly. In their courtship days\r\nthey had been in the habit of giving each other gifts, frequent and\r\npersonally meaningful gifts. But now, even on birthdays, they bought\r\npresents “for the home” rather than for each other.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of our work the wife, one cold winter day, on the\r\nspur of a tender moment, bought her husband a very bright yellow scarf\r\nand presented it to him that night. I learned later from him that his\r\nfirst impulse on receiving the gift was to laugh. He dressed most\r\nconservatively, and the garish scarf was very much out of keeping with\r\nhis tastes.\r\n\r\nHe did not laugh, however, realizing that the gift was an expression of\r\nsomething new in his wife, that it showed a new concern for him and an\r\nattempt to begin to show it. Instead he kissed her tenderly and wore\r\nthe scarf to his office the next day. When he came home that night he\r\npresented her with a lovely platinum watch of a make he had once heard\r\nher admire. “She looked down for a moment,” he told me, “as though she\r\nwere confused, and then she looked up at me and put her arms around\r\nme and wept a very long time.” Those tears, of course, were the sure\r\nbeginning of a deep thaw. His sensitivity to his wife’s need at this\r\npoint in her life had been a decisive element, and her progress from\r\nthat point on was greatly accelerated.\r\n\r\nIn counseling husbands to be sensitively attentive to their wives’\r\nneeds during this period of change I must warn against one thing.\r\nInsincerity or artificiality will not work at all, indeed could\r\nactually be harmful. Women are deeply intuitive and can detect any\r\nhypocritical attempt to manipulate them. It is not wise to try to\r\nexpress love if you do not feel it. A man who cannot experience real\r\nfeeling toward his wife should put his main effort into self-inquiry.\r\nHe may discover that the anger and hurt that have built up in him\r\nduring the unhappy years that are past are too great to handle alone\r\nand he may wish to discuss these intransigent feelings with a counselor\r\nor psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nI know of one man who, paying lip service to the idea of helping his\r\nwife, put in a weekly order at the local florist shop for flowers. When\r\nin the next three months she had received “enough,” as she put it, “for\r\nan elaborate funeral,” she begged him to stop sending them.\r\n\r\nAnother man, having ignored any social life with his wife for\r\nyears, was told that she should get away from her household duties\r\noccasionally. He suddenly insisted, therefore, on dragging her on a\r\nround of night clubs and theater parties that would have exhausted\r\nElsa Maxwell. His wife was essentially rather shy and withdrawn and of\r\ncourse resented this enforced and artificial approach to her real needs.\r\n\r\nWomen rightly consider these kinds of gestures a mockery, an expression\r\nof a latent hostility toward them rather than as an expression of love.\r\nOf course women love luxury, going out, gifts--but only when they\r\nexpress a sensitive awareness on the part of the giver. A rule of thumb\r\nthat works is to do what one feels but to refrain firmly from doing\r\nwhat one doesn’t feel. Somebody once said that the proper mixture for\r\nthe real lover is 80 per cent male aggression and 20 per cent feminine\r\nsensitivity. The formula has much to recommend it.\r\n\r\nOne important thing that husbands and wives must learn to do is to\r\nshare their deeper thoughts, problems, and feelings with one another.\r\nOver the years the general withdrawal of both partners has made\r\ncommunication of any kind most superficial, and hope of any important\r\ncontact through conversation has been abandoned almost entirely. When\r\nthe wife has finally told her husband of her determination to attack\r\nher problem frontally, the couple now have a new opportunity for\r\nestablishing deep lines of communication. If the husband can seize on\r\nthis new chance, divest himself of his lonely and habitual reticence,\r\nhe can help his wife and their entire relationship immeasurably.\r\n\r\nEverything may be discussed in such conversations, although one should\r\navoid any recrimination or “confessions” that would hurt the other.\r\nConversation about one’s emotional or reality difficulties, about one’s\r\nloneliness, plans, successes, fears, and hopes, are deeply moving to a\r\nwoman. If a man can learn to share his real inner life with his wife it\r\nwill help her to realize once more the importance of the woman’s role,\r\nmake her know that she has her husband’s confidence in those things\r\nthat are of real importance to him.\r\n\r\nAs I have pointed out, frigid women have little knowledge of what\r\nmen are really like. Basically they see men as “powers,” without\r\nworries or fears. When they learn from their husbands’ own lips their\r\nreal feelings, these women are very greatly aided in changing their\r\nunderlying attitudes.\r\n\r\nOne woman told me that her whole marriage-long conception of her\r\nhusband had been completely altered by one emotional confession from\r\nhim. She had told him that she had finally realized her frigidity had\r\nbeen the cause of the problem between them and that she had determined\r\nto attempt to change herself. He listened quietly as she talked and was\r\nsilent for a moment when she finished. Then he said in a low voice:\r\n“I have been terribly lonely without you.” This honest communication\r\nreached past all her neurotic defenses, informed her simply and\r\ndirectly how important her decision was to him, how human and needful\r\nthe husband she had feared and rejected really was.\r\n\r\nIt is in such real, such personal exchanges with his wife that a man\r\nmost often begins to reap the rewards his wife’s decision to change\r\nwill bring him. As he expresses himself more and her security in him\r\ndeepens, he begins to encounter the depths of tranquillity that have\r\nalways lain beneath her defensive exterior; he begins to feel her great\r\ncapacity to give him something that he has missed, missed terribly--a\r\ncompanionship, support, and love that ask for nothing but to be needed.\r\nIn this way a new and profound mutuality develops and, cleared of the\r\nfears that have impeded it, the real marriage between these two people\r\ncan begin to flourish.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual aspect of the marriage, as in its psychological aspect,\r\nsensitivity is also the key word for the husband who wishes to help his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nIn every case of frigidity that I have encountered the sexual life\r\nbetween husband and wife has, through the years, become an extremely\r\nself-conscious one. The wife generally is acutely aware of every\r\ngenital sensation that she has or every sensation that she does not\r\nhave. Her chronic sense of failure is at the root of this hawk-like\r\nattention to her reactions. Often this self-concern has been encouraged\r\nby reading books that emphasize the mechanical aspects of sexual love,\r\ngiving her false hopes that somehow she is going to be able to solve\r\nher orgastic problem if she can only get in the right position, make\r\nthe right movement, contract the right muscles at the right time, or\r\nteach her husband the right techniques.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is impossible for a husband not to react to\r\nhis wife’s hyper-narcissism. He tends then to put his awareness of her\r\nexperience ahead of his own enjoyment. This is one of the prime reasons\r\nwhy the sex act for both of them has become anxious and dull.\r\n\r\nIn sex one’s body can feel only its own raptures. Even the exquisite\r\nsensation of giving the partner pleasure is psychological and, by\r\ndefinition, important only when it heightens one’s pleasure, not when\r\nit decreases it.\r\n\r\nIt is very important, therefore, for the husband to drop his\r\nself-consciousness about his wife’s pleasures or lack of them during\r\nintercourse. In fact, both must start with a clean slate on this score,\r\ntake the healthy natural view that sexual sensation is a self-centered,\r\neven selfish, matter basically. Overconcern for the other can rob it of\r\nits lusty spontaneity entirely.\r\n\r\nThis may strike a man as a new conception. In most books on married\r\nsexuality the mutuality of the act is the point emphasized; such books\r\nalways speak glowingly of the pleasure one experiences in the other’s\r\nreactions. When frigidity is present this “mutuality” can become a\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nA woman suffering from frigidity will be very relieved if her husband\r\nwill make a gentle but blanket announcement to her that she is to drop\r\nher entire concern with orgasm until it happens. I have pointed out\r\nbefore that this indeed must be her working attitude before she has her\r\nfirst orgasmic experience. For a husband to affirm that this attitude\r\nis also his can be a great reassurance to her. She will then allow\r\nherself to really enjoy his “selfish” ecstasy without neurotically\r\nfixing on her own localized sensations. Indulging the deeply feminine\r\nrole of _giving_ pleasure can be more exciting to her than any other\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nNow a word about foreplay--in my opinion one of the most grossly\r\nmisunderstood words in the language. Many men, and women too, take it\r\nto mean solely a duty-bound interval in which a man tries to arouse\r\na woman by physically caressing and kissing her. This mechanistic\r\ninterpretation is based on the oft-quoted statement that women are\r\nslower to respond sexually than men and that it is the man’s duty to\r\narouse her.\r\n\r\nI think it is absolutely necessary for this particular conception\r\nof foreplay to be expanded considerably where women who have had\r\na sexual difficulty are concerned. As we have seen over and over\r\nagain, frigidity in women is caused by psychological problems of a\r\nvery specific kind. Any exclusively mechanical approach to these\r\ndifficulties is foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nHusbands of women with a frigidity problem are well advised to consider\r\nforeplay primarily a psychological rather than a physical matter.\r\n\r\nIf you will recall the stages of development the growing girl goes\r\nthrough, you will remember that they culminate in adolescence. During\r\nthat stage a long romantic dream prepares the girl for real love. This\r\ndream of romance never leaves a woman. Foreplay is most successful when\r\nit arouses these dormant romantic feelings. Woman is truly an incurable\r\nromantic.\r\n\r\nBut what does romance really mean to her? And how can the romantic\r\nfeeling be conjured up?\r\n\r\nRomantic feelings are aroused in a woman when she feels that her\r\nhusband’s entire emotion is fixed on her tenderly and lovingly. She\r\nfeels romantic when all the other goals and needs and duties of life\r\nare for the time being relinquished. In such a situation she dares to\r\nrelax, to loaf and invite her soul, to concentrate on her deep belief\r\nthat love is centrally important, the thing that gives life its meaning\r\nand its beauty. Every woman, at the heart’s deep core, wishes to give\r\nall for love.\r\n\r\nSuch a mood of romance cannot, of course, be bumped up suddenly, nor\r\ncan it be created by a man who feels cynical or abashed by it. To woo a\r\nwoman successfully, a man must believe in her dream of love and become\r\na passionate sharer in it.\r\n\r\nCertain things that remove a couple for a while from the highly\r\ngoal-centered activities of daily life help to create this romantic\r\nmood. A housewife will respond to a luxurious evening out; putting on\r\nan evening gown can separate her from her housekeeping, penny-pinching\r\nview of herself, and the sight of her husband in a tuxedo can fill\r\nher romantic cup to the brim. A few champagnes and dancing to a good\r\norchestra, and the magic is complete.\r\n\r\nPicnics together, too, can engender a deeply romantic feeling in a\r\nwife. But of course the children should not be along. And the whole\r\nthing should be carried off with a little style. Wine, a good one, is\r\na must, and the man should know beforehand of a fine and very private\r\nspot for the picnic.\r\n\r\nI have known several women who have broken through the barriers of\r\nsexual frigidity during ocean cruises. These seem to represent the\r\nromantic circumstance par excellence, and a husband who can afford them\r\nshould add them to his loving calculations.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, husbands and wives should arrange their lives to get\r\nsome vacation time alone together. With even the best intentions the\r\nduties and responsibilities of life close in on one, tend to take some\r\nof the bloom off the rose. A week, a month if possible, alone together\r\ncan help to re-establish vitality and meaning in a marriage.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a man has stayed with a woman despite her frigidity\r\nand the problems it causes is a testament to the abiding love he has\r\nfor her. If he will forget his old despair now that his wife has\r\ntaken responsibility in the relationship, call on his real manhood\r\nto reassert itself in helping her to her goal, his rewards can be as\r\nbounteous as femininity can bestow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 19_\r\n\r\nTHE LORE OF LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book, as you have noted, I have taken a firm stand against\r\nany mechanical approach to love or love-making. This represents the\r\npsychiatric view of love and is based on the premise that frigidity is\r\npsychological in nature and that the resolution of it must be therefore\r\na psychological one.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical approach is based on the premise that love-making is an\r\nart or even a science that can be learned, as the piano or chemistry\r\ncan be learned. From the psychiatric view the so-called art of love is\r\ninstinctual. The perfectly free person, if one can be imagined, would,\r\nif he loved and were loved in return, soon become a sophisticated\r\npractitioner of this art with the barest of preparation.\r\n\r\nI recall an anecdote that illustrates this point. It was told to me\r\nby a sociologist who was conducting a survey of married couples in an\r\neffort to find the correlation between premarital advice and sexual\r\nhappiness. While questioning one healthy couple whose marriage was\r\nobviously happy, he asked the husband:\r\n\r\n“And did your parents give you any advice?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Which parent?”\r\n\r\n“My father.”\r\n\r\n“Did he give you a thorough briefing?”\r\n\r\nPause. “Yes, it was brief.” Pause. “And it was thorough.”\r\n\r\n“What did he tell you?”\r\n\r\n“You want his words?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘Everything goes.’”\r\n\r\nHowever, such free spirits as this one are relatively rare in our\r\nsociety. Usually more instruction is needed. Taboos against sexuality\r\nhave characterized Western civilization. The art of love, therefore,\r\nseems to me to be largely the art of getting over societally induced\r\nignorance, superstition, and inhibition.\r\n\r\nHere’s how I view the matter. When through the methods employed in this\r\nsection or through therapy one has at length achieved psychological\r\nmaturity and therefore vaginal orgasm is no longer blocked, an\r\nexamination of some of the technical information about love-making can\r\nbe helpful. Before that point, such lore tends to lead to an inhibiting\r\nself-consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed by students of the matter that spontaneity in\r\nsexual relations must never be lost. Married life tends to impose a\r\nrather rigid pattern in all areas of living. Such routinization is a\r\nnecessity if the world’s work is to get done. For most people, for\r\nexample, it becomes necessary to breakfast every day at the same time,\r\nin the same place, and in the same manner. If one allows this to happen\r\nto sexuality one is imprisoning the unicorn, exposing love-making to a\r\nloss of its magic.\r\n\r\nVariety is the spice that married love often needs, and it takes no\r\ngreat effort to be various in love-making. It takes only a sense of\r\nits importance and the knowledge of a few minimal facts.\r\n\r\nOne method of preserving spontaneity is to prevent love-making from\r\nalways occurring at the same time. Evenings in most homes tend to\r\nfollow a pattern. Supper must be cooked, dishes must be done, children\r\nmust be put to bed. And then there’s television or guests. I have had\r\nmany men and women defend the proposition that, since love-making tends\r\nto make them sleepy when it is finished, the last moments of the day\r\nare by necessity the time for love.\r\n\r\nBut this is making convenience a necessity. And love is too beautiful,\r\ntoo centrally important to be domesticated so. If it can laugh at\r\nlocksmiths, it can also, once every week or two, laugh behind locked\r\nbedroom doors. Children have homework to do or a television program\r\nto watch, and anyhow, it is good for them to realize that Mother and\r\nFather spend some time alone and love to.\r\n\r\nDishes can wait occasionally, too, at least in the name of love. And\r\na television program is rarely so good or demanding that a delicious\r\nsleepiness won’t improve it.\r\n\r\nDesire often arises unbidden and for no apparently rational reason. Men\r\nare more subject to outside stimuli than women and are perhaps more\r\nuninhibited, so the inception of love-making at unroutine times may\r\nmost frequently originate with them. But women, too, when they feel the\r\nurge should realize that they can initiate a passionate interlude and\r\nshould not prevent themselves from doing so. It is proper and good that\r\na woman should do this. And her husband will love it.\r\n\r\nI am assuming that the partners in such delightfully off-hour trysts\r\nare sensitive to each other’s responses. What every man and woman must\r\nrealize is that it is perfectly all right to say no if one is fatigued\r\nor preoccupied. But the nay-saying must be gentle, and if it is so and\r\nthe partner who makes the advance is hurt, he or she must examine the\r\nrejected feeling, take full responsibility for it, and dispose of it.\r\nHolding onto such feelings causes one to fear making advances, and\r\nthis will deprive the relationship of one of the best techniques for\r\nmaintaining spontaneity. It is insensitive and unloving to force a\r\npartner by sulking or other forms of psychological blackmail to satisfy\r\na need. It is far easier for the ardent one to wait; the time will come\r\nsoon enough; the fact that you have announced your desire has a delayed\r\nreaction on your loved one.\r\n\r\nWaking in the middle of the night, many men find themselves prepared\r\nfor love-making, the penis firmly erect. And many women love to be\r\nawakened from their sleep to find themselves mistily, dreamily in the\r\nembrace of love; the body on waking is often very sensual.\r\n\r\nChanges on the time for love can be rung in a variety of ways, and it\r\nis advisable to see that they are. Not too much effort is necessary;\r\nthe hour at the end of the day when one is preparing for sleep will\r\nstill remain the basic time for intercourse. It will need but an\r\noccasional switch in time to keep this customary trysting hour from\r\nlosing its quality of ever-renewed excitement.\r\n\r\nAnother and perhaps even more basic technique for preserving the\r\nspontaneity of sex is that of varying the position used during\r\nintercourse. In most relationships one preferred position generally\r\nevolves. If this position is always adopted, the feeling of a\r\nmonotonous repetitiveness can enter the love situation, and this must\r\nbe guarded against.\r\n\r\nThis fact has been recognized from earliest times, and efforts to\r\ncombat it have given rise through the centuries to a vast number of\r\nbooks on the subject. Hindu, Greek, Roman, and Persian literature\r\nrecord hundreds of sexual positions and animadversions, and if one\r\nhas a library of erotica available and is sufficiently curious these\r\npositions may be studied. However, such a proliferation of detail can\r\nbecome exhausting and even morbid and absurd--though perhaps gaily\r\nabsurd. Most of the modern books which dispense direct sexual advice\r\nobtain their material from these ancient sources.\r\n\r\nThere are only five basic positions which have real relevance to most\r\ncouples. I am going to describe them so that when you encounter them or\r\nwish yourself to change from your usual position you will not feel that\r\nthey are strange, awkward, or so exotic as to cause you feelings of\r\nshyness, embarrassment, or guilt.\r\n\r\nThe first position, of course, is the ventro-ventral (or face to face)\r\nposition, with the man on top and the woman on the bottom with her\r\nknees up. Not even the most puritanically reared person will demur at\r\nthis position, for it is the classical sexual position used in our\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIt is, if used properly, perhaps the best position for sexual union. It\r\nallows for deep penetration of the vagina by the penis, and because it\r\nleaves the pelvic regions of both partners free, it allows for variety\r\nin sexual movement, though the man has more freedom of movement in this\r\nposition than the woman.\r\n\r\nThere’s an old but apt joke about this position. A young chorus girl\r\nasks an older one what her definition of a gentleman is. The older one\r\npromptly replies: “One who leans on his elbows.” Men should remember\r\nthat this fact can be pertinent. The full weight of the heavy man can\r\nbe quite tiring even to a very passionate woman.\r\n\r\nA pleasant variant of this position can be achieved if a pillow is\r\nplaced under the buttocks of the woman before intercourse. If it is\r\nplaced a little toward the small of the back, those women who receive\r\npreliminary pleasure from friction between the clitoris and the penis\r\nwill find the contact easier to effect. If it is placed a bit forward\r\nit will be very exciting to those who get a great deal of sensation\r\nfrom pressure of the penis against the posterior walls of the vagina.\r\n\r\nGenerally in this classical position the woman simply spreads her\r\nlegs and raises them (lying with the legs straight down makes vaginal\r\nentrance difficult for the male). Those who enjoy stimulation of the\r\nposterior vaginal wall may lock their legs around their partner’s hips.\r\nThose who in the initial stages of intercourse are most aroused by\r\nclitoral stimulation may close their legs; in this position the man is\r\nhalf kneeling, straddling his partner’s hips. This latter position is\r\nnot too comfortable for the man if it is maintained for long. A less\r\narduous position for the man is achieved if he straddles one of his\r\npartner’s legs and enters the vagina at a slightly oblique angle. This\r\nallows the woman to close the leg that is free, which gives maximum\r\ncontact of all portions of the vulva with the penis.\r\n\r\nThe next major position reverses the top-bottom roles. The woman, in\r\nthis variant, is on the top, the man on the bottom.\r\n\r\nMany couples feel inhibited about this position. The man will often\r\nfeel “feminized,” the woman “masculinized.” Such relativistic concepts\r\nof what is male and what is female could actually have any application\r\nonly if this were the chief position in which a couple had intercourse.\r\nAnd even this fact could be altered by circumstance; for example, the\r\nwoman might be physically very small and the man very large and heavy.\r\n\r\nThis position is adopted either as a spontaneous change for variety’s\r\nsake or because the woman may be feeling far more energetic than the\r\nman at the moment; the partner on top, of course, does the major\r\nportion of the moving. Psychologically this position can represent an\r\nexpression of tenderness on the woman’s part. If her husband feels\r\nsensual but fatigued, she can give him pleasure without making it\r\nnecessary for him to develop the usual amount of male aggressiveness.\r\nSuch a passive role can be exciting to a man on occasion, and he should\r\nallow himself to indulge it.\r\n\r\nIn this position the woman may straddle her husband’s hips; this\r\noccasions very deep penetration, and may be particularly pleasurable\r\nbecause since she is in charge she may feel freer to exert more than\r\nthe usual pressure of the penis against the cervix. In this position,\r\ntoo, she may lie on top of her husband, her legs supported by his,\r\nor she may lie between his legs. In these two latter positions the\r\nclitoris can be brought into very close contact with the penis, and\r\nthis is of course very pleasant for women who become aroused in this\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative for love-making is the face to face and sideways\r\nposition. In this position, since the woman is generally the lighter of\r\nthe two, one of her legs is placed over the man’s hips; this allows him\r\nto insert his penis at a slightly oblique angle. Pillows for head and\r\nshoulder are generally necessary if this position is maintained for the\r\nentire intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe next position is the dorso-ventral position, in which the\r\nman’s penis enters the woman’s vagina from the back. If the entire\r\nintercourse is performed while lying sideways, this is perhaps the most\r\n“restful” of all positions. For obvious reasons it is sometimes the\r\npreferred form for intercourse during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThis position is often extremely exciting to a man. I do not know\r\nexactly why this is so, though it has been suggested that the\r\nposition suggests the “animality” of pure lust. And this idea could\r\nbe stimulated by the fact that the position is the familiar one that\r\nanimals take. Or perhaps the fact that the partners are not face to\r\nface may remove some of the personal factor from the sexual embrace,\r\ngiving it a more primordial and impersonal character. This may be the\r\nreason men may find it more enjoyable than women, their sexual natures\r\nbeing, as we have seen, somewhat more deeply rooted in their biology\r\nthan the woman’s sexual nature. I must emphasize, however, that these\r\nideas are merely speculative.\r\n\r\nThe dorso-ventral position can also be assumed with the woman kneeling,\r\nor standing up and bending over, supporting herself against a chair\r\nor wall with her hands. It can be achieved less athletically if the\r\nman sits on a chair and his partner sits on his lap, although this\r\nobviously allows for less movement by both.\r\n\r\nThe last general position I shall describe here is the standing\r\nposition. It is a particularly arduous position for the male; he\r\ngenerally must bend his knees slightly to enter and must hold onto his\r\npartner’s buttocks to maintain entrance.\r\n\r\nI think these are the major sexual positions which it is relevant to\r\nknow and to adopt when the mood is upon one. Most of the “hundreds” of\r\nothers described in the literature of antiquity are subtle variations\r\nof these and have no particular application to the love-making a\r\nmodern couple might engage in. Indeed, I think it is apparent that any\r\nexcessive preoccupation with such nuances could indicate a morbidity,\r\nmay be a confession that the person, far from having achieved sexual\r\nmaturity, is in some profound way impotent.\r\n\r\nThere is one further point I should like to make about these positions.\r\nWhile men can usually have an orgasm in any position, many women, if\r\nnot most, achieve it most completely and satisfyingly in one favorite\r\nposition. This is perfectly consonant with full psychological and\r\nsexual maturity, and one should in no wise feel the slightest bit\r\napologetic about it. It is absolutely advisable to make this fact known\r\nto one’s partner in love. He will, of course, if you are both feeling\r\npositionally experimental, return to the position you prefer when you\r\nare ready to have your climax.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA psychiatrist is asked a wide variety of questions about sexuality\r\nby his patients. Here are some of the more frequent areas about which\r\nindividuals seem to wish further information:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _Frequency of intercourse_\r\n\r\nThere are no rules whatever about this, though suggestions about what\r\nis “normal” have been made from earliest times. Mohammed the Prophet\r\nstated that once a week was best; Martin Luther found that twice a week\r\n“does harm neither to her nor to me.”\r\n\r\nIn these days of sociological studies there have of course been endless\r\nattempts to find the statistical norm for frequency of intercourse.\r\nThe Margaret Sanger Research Bureau in 1933 released figures showing\r\nthat, of ten thousand cases investigated, sexual intercourse occurred\r\nfrom one to three times per week--4 per cent had intercourse one or\r\nmore times daily. Kinsey found that frequency depended greatly on the\r\nage of the husband; men between twenty-one and twenty-five showed an\r\nintercourse rate of just over three times per week; those between\r\nthirty-one and thirty-five showed a frequency rate of a little more\r\nthan twice a week; those aged forty-one to forty-five had intercourse\r\non an average of one and one half times a week; and men over fifty-six\r\naveraged less than once a week.\r\n\r\nThese studies, of course, always show wide variations in individual\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion frequency of intercourse is entirely an individual\r\nmatter. The only criterion of any importance is that both partners feel\r\ncompletely satisfied with the amount of intercourse they are having.\r\nIf one of the partners is dissatisfied, the subject should be open for\r\ndiscussion in a very frank manner. No cause for feelings of rejection\r\nby a partner should be allowed to develop in silence.\r\n\r\nThere will always be periods in which, because of exterior\r\ncircumstances (pregnancy, business worries, sickness, etc.), the rate\r\nof intercourse in any marriage may slow down or stop for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) _Variations in woman’s sexual desire_\r\n\r\nThere are such variations, as far as most of the research undertaken\r\nso far can determine. Katherine Davis, in a study of one thousand\r\nmarried women, and studies by Marie Stokes, Therese Benedek, and others\r\nindicate that the desire of women vary during the menstrual cycle.\r\nAccording to Hannah and Abraham Stone, who have made a study of a\r\nlarge number of women, “Most … state that their erotic impulses are\r\nincreased either a few days before the onset of the menstrual flow or,\r\nmore usually, right after menstruation, although the latter rise may be\r\npartly due to the abstinence which is generally maintained during the\r\nmenstrual week.” Stokes reported also a second rise of sexual desire at\r\nsome point in the middle of the menstrual month. There are apparently\r\nindividual differences in the cycle of desire, and a woman can best\r\ndetermine for herself her own particular rhythm.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be learned about this matter. The relationship between\r\nhormonal secretion and female sexuality and “femininity” has been most\r\nrecently studied by Therese Benedek in her book _Psychosexual Functions\r\nin Women_. This is a technical book, but anyone interested in this\r\naspect of the subject will find the material fascinating.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be determined, there is no corresponding cycle of desire\r\nin the male.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) _Length of intercourse_\r\n\r\nThis is entirely an individual matter. It varies with each couple and\r\noften with each intercourse. Indeed, this variability in time can add\r\nto the spontaneity factor in intercourse.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be only one basic rule governing the length of time; to\r\nsee that the other partner achieves orgasm if it is desired. This often\r\nmeans that the husband must postpone his climax until the wife achieves\r\nhers. Most men are able to learn to control the moment at which they\r\nreach orgasm and therefore can wait until their wives are ready.\r\n\r\nOrgasm in unison is widely held to be the most desirable form of\r\nclimax. However, I have had many people of both sexes report that they\r\npreferred to reach climax immediately before or immediately after their\r\npartners. Some say that they are distracted by the other’s movements\r\nat this juncture. Others say that they profoundly enjoy the partner’s\r\nexcitement and that they prefer to have a modicum of ego left to\r\nexperience it more completely.\r\n\r\nSome women have two or more orgasms to their husband’s one. By far the\r\nmajority of men have only one orgasm per intercourse. If on occasion\r\na man has his ejaculation before the woman achieves her climax, she\r\nwill often continue her movements until she is satisfied. However,\r\nthe glans penis (head of the penis) of many men becomes extremely\r\nsensitive immediately after orgasm, and in that case the woman may have\r\nto postpone her satisfaction until the next time. If she continues her\r\nmovements it may cause her husband to have unpleasant sensations, even\r\nthough he may still have an erection and thus appear to be able to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) _Limits to love-making_\r\n\r\nI am often asked the question whether any sexual practice between\r\nhusband and wife could be considered “unhealthy” or “wrong.” In my\r\nopinion, certain practices could be considered so, though I know I am\r\nat variance with certain sexologists. A long discussion of the matter,\r\nhowever, would take us into psychological and even perhaps moral realms\r\nwhich I do not feel are pertinent to this book. As a rule of thumb,\r\nI would say that any practice that does not culminate in intercourse\r\ntends to be regressive and infantile if it becomes a chief method of\r\nsexual expression. Also, insistence on any practice that cannot be\r\nshared pleasurably by the partner is likewise regressive.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “polymorphus perverse” pleasures are aspects of foreplay\r\nand not ends in themselves. The primacy of the oral, anal, onanistic,\r\nor sado-masochistic forms of sexuality is a hallmark of the immature\r\npersonality. Another unmistakable sign of such immaturity (or even of\r\ndownright psychic illness) is the insistence on _any_ form of sexuality\r\nnot heartily endorsed by one’s partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) _Contraception_\r\n\r\nTo use or not to use contraceptives is a personal matter that every\r\nindividual must settle for himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the responsibility for contraception is up to the woman, she\r\nshould always be prepared for intercourse whenever it is even remotely\r\npossible. There is nothing so deadening to sexual excitement as the\r\nwoman who comes to love unprepared and must interrupt the process to\r\nput her diaphragm on. If this is a repetitive situation in marital\r\nlife it is almost a certain sign that the woman has not yet accepted\r\nher feminine role. The tacit assumption when you obtain a diaphragm is\r\nthat you are accepting the responsibility for contraception. There is\r\nrarely any need, other than a negative one on the woman’s part, for\r\nthis to interfere or to impinge on sexual intercourse in any manner.\r\nThe husband is quite correct who interprets chronic remissiveness of\r\nthis sort as an unsolved problem of his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ADDENDA I\r\n\r\n\r\nMany women will find that with the methods prescribed here their\r\nfrigidity can be conquered. Some, however, will find that though they\r\ncan be helped by using these techniques they cannot achieve their goal\r\nwithout outside help. Throughout the book I have tried to indicate the\r\nkind of person and the kind of problem that may require additional\r\ntherapeutic aid, and I have tried to indicate that a person who needs\r\nsuch outside help should feel no sense of shame about that fact nor\r\nhesitancy about seeking it. Indeed, one of my chief reasons for writing\r\nthis book has been to open vistas hitherto unknown to many women. If\r\nreading it has but started you on the road to mature femininity, its\r\nchief function has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nHow does one decide whether outside aid is indicated?\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb that will cover all cases. Some may decide\r\nthat they would prefer to start and finish their work on this problem\r\nwith a trained therapist. Others may start alone but find that\r\nself-exploration, the surfacing of painful emotions and attitudes and\r\nfantasies, is too difficult and confusing and decide to seek expert\r\nguidance. Still others may find that though they can go a long\r\ndistance alone the final goal will elude them if they do not consult\r\nwith a trained worker in the field.\r\n\r\nIf and when one does decide that outside help is necessary, one\r\nshould know how to find qualified people in this field. The following\r\ninformation, then, is proffered to aid you in that respect.\r\n\r\nYour family physician can be most helpful. If he has the time he may\r\nbe able to counsel you directly, act as a guide to those insights that\r\nwill help you to achieve your goal. More than likely, however, you will\r\nfind that his schedule is far too heavy to permit him to do this, no\r\nmatter how much he would wish to do so. In that case he will refer you\r\nto another person who is qualified to give such help or to a proper\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you cannot obtain a referral from your own physician,\r\nit is important to know to whom you may turn for help in your community.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of specialists who are trained to give you\r\nproper counseling for your problem. These are psychiatrists, clinical\r\npsychologists, and social workers.\r\n\r\nThe hospital in your community can usually give you the name of a\r\nperson in one of these specialties whom you could consult privately.\r\nSuch hospitals may also have outpatient counseling clinics, and these\r\nare staffed by competent psychotherapists. If your hospital does not\r\nmaintain such a service it will nevertheless know where you can obtain\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nOne of the resources you have open to you may be one of the so-called\r\n“family agencies.” You can have confidence in such agencies. They are\r\ndevoted to the task of resolving any and all types of family problems\r\nand are frequently staffed by social workers with excellent training in\r\nmarriage counseling.\r\n\r\nMany American communities are relatively rich in counseling resources,\r\nbut there are also many where psychological help is difficult to\r\nobtain. If your doctor or your local hospital cannot help you, it may\r\nbe necessary for you to journey to the nearest large city to obtain\r\naid. If you wish to obtain the names of the qualified psychiatrists\r\nnearest your residence you may write to the American Psychiatric\r\nAssociation, 1270 Sixth Avenue, New York, N.Y., and they will furnish\r\nyou with the required information. Be certain that in your letter you\r\nspecify the urban center nearest you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ADDENDA II\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no book that covers the problem of psychological frigidity in\r\nwomen as such.
