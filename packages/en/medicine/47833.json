The _generatio de\r\nnovo_ of a really new species of disease “is (says Dr. Mason Good[2])\r\nperhaps as much a phenomenon as a really new species of plant or of\r\nanimal.” Dr. Good’s remark is probably too sweeping in its principle;\r\nfor, if necessary, it might be easy to show that, if the particular\r\ndiseases of particular animal species are liable to alteration at all,\r\nthey must necessarily alter more frequently than those animal species\r\nthemselves. In pursuing such an inquiry, the pathologist labours under\r\ncomparative disadvantages. The physiologist can, by the aid of\r\ngeological research, prove that the individual species of plants and\r\nanimals inhabiting this and other regions of the earth, have again and\r\nagain been changed. The pathologist has no such demonstrative data to\r\nshow that, in the course of time, the forms and species of morbid action\r\nhave undergone great mutations, like the forms and species of normal\r\nlife. But still we have strong grounds for believing that, in regard to\r\nour own individual species alone, the diseases to which mankind are\r\nsubject have already undergone, in some respects, marked changes within\r\nthe historic era of medicine. Since the first medical observations that\r\nare now extant on disease were made and recorded in Greece, various new\r\nspecies of human maladies have, there can be little doubt, made their\r\noriginal appearance. I need only allude to small-pox, measles, and\r\nhooping-cough. Again, some diseases which prevailed formerly, seem to\r\nhave now entirely disappeared from among the human race—as, for\r\nexample, the Lycanthropia of the Sacred Writings, and of Oribasius,\r\nAetius, Marcellus, and various old medical authors.[3] Other maladies,\r\nas that most anomalous affection, the English sweating-sickness of the\r\nfifteenth century, have only once, and that for a very short period,\r\nbeen permitted to commit their ravages upon mankind. And lastly, we have\r\nstill another and more extensive class, including maladies that have\r\nchanged their geographical stations to such an extent, as to have made\r\ninroads upon whole districts and regions of the world, where they were\r\nformerly unknown, leaving now untouched the localities which, in older\r\ntimes, suffered most severely from their visitations.\r\n\r\nAmong this last tribe of diseases no one presents a more curious subject\r\nof inquiry than the European leprosy, or tubercular elephantiasis of the\r\nmiddle ages. This malady is now almost entirely, if not entirely,\r\nunknown as a native endemic disease on any part of the Continent of\r\nEurope; and yet from the tenth to the sixteenth century it prevailed in\r\nnearly every district of it. Laws were enacted by Princes and Courts to\r\narrest its diffusion;—the Pope issued bulls with regard to the\r\necclesiastical separation and rights of the infected;[4]—a particular\r\norder of Knighthood was instituted to watch over the sick;—and leper\r\nhospitals or lazar-houses were everywhere instituted to receive the\r\nvictims of the disease. The number of these houses has certainly been\r\noften erroneously stated, in consequence, as far as I have been able to\r\ntrace it, of a strange mistake committed by Ducange, in quoting from\r\nMatthew Paris a passage in which that historian contrasts the respective\r\npossessions belonging in the thirteenth century to the Hospitalarii,\r\nKnights Hospitallers, or Knights of St. John, as they were termed, and\r\nthe Knights Templars. The 19,000 lazar-houses in Christendom, as\r\ninterpreted by Ducange, mark in Matthew Paris’ work merely the number of\r\nmanors or commanderies of the Hospitalarii, and have no reference\r\nwhatever to leprosy or lazar-houses.[5] But still that an immense number\r\nof leper-houses existed on the Continent at the period mentioned, is\r\nabundantly shown in many of the historical documents of that age. Louis\r\nVIII. promulgated a code of laws in 1226, for the regulation of the\r\nFrench leper hospitals; and these hospitals were at that date computed\r\nto amount, in the then limited kingdom of France, to not less than 2000\r\nin number—(_deux mille leproseries_).[6] They afterwards, as is alleged\r\nby Velley,[7] even increased in number, so much so that there was\r\nscarcely a town or burgh in the country that was not provided with a\r\nleper hospital. In his history of the reign of Philip II. Mezeray uses\r\nthe same language in regard to the prevalence of leprosy and leprous\r\npatients in France during the twelfth century.[8] Muratori gives a\r\nnearly similar account of the extent of the disease during the middle\r\nages in Italy;[9] and the inhabitants of the kingdoms of Northern\r\nEurope, equally became its unfortunate victims.[10]\r\n\r\nI have no desire, however, to enter at present into the extensive\r\nhistory of the leprosy of the middle ages, as seen in the different\r\nquarters of Europe. My object is a much more limited and a much more\r\nhumble one. I wish only to adduce various evidence to show that the\r\ndisease extended to this the most western verge of Europe, and at one\r\ntime prevailed to a considerable extent in our own kingdom of Scotland,\r\nwhich, at the period alluded to, was one of the most remote and\r\nthinly-populated principalities in Christendom. I shall have frequent\r\noccasion, at the same time, to illustrate my remarks by references to\r\nthe disease as it existed contemporaneously in England.[11]\r\n\r\nIn following out the object adverted to, I shall commence by an\r\nenumeration of such leper hospitals as I have detected any notices of in\r\nold Scottish records. The knowledge of the mere existence of most of\r\nthese hospitals has been obtained more by the accidental preservation of\r\ncharters of casual grants to them than by any historical or traditional\r\nnotice of the institutions themselves. The information, therefore, which\r\nI have to offer in regard to most of them is exceedingly slight. The\r\nfollowing meagre notes regarding the two first Lazar or Leper-houses,\r\nSpitals, Spetels, or Spitles,[12] which I shall mention, show the truth\r\nof this remark.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTTISH LEPER HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\n_Aldcambus, Berwickshire._—A Leper Hospital existed at Aldcambus, in\r\nthe parish of Cockburnspath, Berwickshire, as far back as the reign of\r\nWilliam the Lion.\r\n\r\nIn the Chartulary of the Priory of Coldingham is preserved a charter by\r\nwhich that monarch confirms a grant of half a carrucate of land to this\r\nhospital. I shall give a transcript of the charter, which has hitherto\r\nremained unpublished. I do so that it may serve as a fair specimen of\r\nthe various similar charter documents to which I shall have occasion to\r\nallude in the course of the following remarks. It is entitled\r\n“Confirmatio donationis Hospitali de Aldcambus facta:”—“Willelmus Dei\r\ngratia Rex Scottorum omnibus probis hominibus totius terre sue Clericis\r\net laicis salutem. Sciant presentes et futuri me concessisse, et hac\r\ncartâ meâ confirmasse donationem illam, quam David de Quicheswde fecit\r\nHospitali de Aldcambus et Leprosis ibi manentibus, de illa dimidia\r\ncarucata terræ in Aldcambus quam Radulfus Pelliparius tenuit: tenendam\r\nin liberam et puram et perpetuam eleemosinam, cum omnibus libertatibus\r\net aisiamentis ad predictam terram juste pertinentibus, ita liberé et\r\nquieté sicut carta predicti Davidis testatur: Salvo servicio meo.\r\nTestibus Willelmo de Bosch. Cancellario meo, Waltero Cuming, Davide de\r\nHastings. Appud Jeddewrith, xvi. die Maij.”[13]\r\n\r\n_Aldnestun in Lauderdale._—At Aldneston another leper-house existed.\r\nIt was under the control of the Abbey of Melrose. In the Melrose\r\nChartulary there is preserved a charter headed “Carta Leprosorum de\r\nMoricestun.” In this charter, Walter Fitzallan, Steward of Scotland,\r\ngranted to this hospital of Auldnestun and its inmates (Hospitali de\r\nAuldnestun et infirmis fratribus ibidem residentibus), a carrucate and a\r\nhalf of land in the village of Auldnestun; another carrucate and a half,\r\nwhich Dame Emma of Ednaham held (tenuit per suas rectas divisas), with\r\nthe common pasturage and easement (asiamento) of the forests of\r\nBirkenside and Ligarrdewude (Legerwood), and a right to grind at his\r\nmill without paying multure.[14]\r\n\r\n_Kingcase, Ayrshire._—At Kilcais or Kingcase, on a bleak muir in the\r\nparish of Prestwick, and about two miles from the town of Ayr, stood,\r\nfor several centuries, an hospital for Lepers. The general tradition of\r\nthe surrounding country avers that this hospital was founded by King\r\nRobert the Bruce. In the article on Ayr, recently published by the Rev.\r\nDr. Auld and Mr. Cuthill, in the New Statistical Account of\r\nScotland,[15] the foundation charter of Robert Bruce is said to have\r\nbeen purchased by the Magistrates of that town in 1786. I am obligingly\r\nassured, however, by Mr. Murdoch of Ayr, that no such document is known\r\nto exist among the archives of that town. It is probable that the\r\nhospital existed before the time of Bruce. In a charter to the monastery\r\nof Dalmulin, contained in the Chartulary of Paisley Abbey,[16] and of\r\nthe date of the reign of William I. of Scotland, among other lands and\r\nlocalities in Kyle and the immediate neighbourhood of Kingcase, the term\r\nSpetel-Crag occurs. Now the term Spetel was a prefix applied, both in\r\nScotland and England, to all hospital lands and possessions, and to\r\nthese alone; and history records no other hospital whatever in Kyle,\r\nfrom which this appellation of Spetel Craigs could be derived. But\r\nwhether Bruce was the original founder, or, what is more probable, a\r\nliberal endower of the hospital, we know this at least of the history of\r\nthe Kingcase Leper Hospital, that it possessed at one time pretty\r\nextensive lands and property in the parish of Dundonald, and in Kyle\r\nStewart.[17]\r\n\r\nThese, like many other hospital grants, came after a time to be\r\nperverted from their original objects of charity, and applied to the\r\naggrandisement of particular individuals. Thus the family of Wallace of\r\nNewton obtained from James II. a feu-charter of the Kingcase estate of\r\nSpittalshiels, for the annual payment of eight merks Scots, and sixteen\r\nthrave of straw. In reference to this, the land of Spittalshiels has yet\r\n(observes Sir Walter Scott, in a note to his _Lord of the Isles_[18]) to\r\ngive, if required, a quantity of straw for the lepers’ beds of Kingcase,\r\nand so much to thatch their houses. Along with Spittalshiels the\r\nWallaces acquired the office of Hereditary Keeper or Governor of the\r\nHospital itself, and of the other lands pertaining to it. In the family\r\nof the Wallaces of Craigy this right of patronage and presentation to\r\nKingcase was long held, with all the remaining endowments of the\r\nhospital. These privileges were exposed at a judicial sale of the estate\r\nof Craigy, and purchased, 1784, by the burgh of Ayr, for £300. The\r\nmagistrates, from this right, exact feu-duties from the lands formerly\r\nbelonging to Kingcase, to the annual extent of sixty-four bolls oatmeal,\r\nand eight merks Scots money. This revenue has been made over to the\r\npoor’s house of Ayr. In virtue of it the magistrates have the privilege\r\nof presenting a certain number of inmates to this latter\r\ninstitution.[19]\r\n\r\nNo records remain as to the original extent of the Kilcais Hospital. The\r\nnumber of lepers supported was, during the latter years of the\r\ninstitution, limited to eight. Before the hospital revenues and lands\r\nwere despoiled the number might have been greater. The only remnants of\r\nthe buildings which are now left consist of the massive side-wall of a\r\nhouse 36 feet long and 17 wide. This is generally alleged to be the\r\nruins of the chapel merely of the hospital; and under this view it is\r\ncertainly calculated to give us a high opinion of the ancient extent and\r\nendowments of the institution. Sir Robert Gordon, in a description of\r\nKyle, published in 1654, in Bleau’s _Atlas_, states that the persons\r\nadmitted to the charity were then lodged in huts (_tuguria_) in the\r\nvicinity of the chapel.[20]\r\n\r\n_Glasgow._—In 1350, in the reign of David II., the Lady of Lochow,\r\ndaughter of Robert Duke of Albany, erected a leper hospital at the\r\nGorbals of Glasgow, near the old Bridge.[21] She endowed this hospital\r\nwith some lands and houses in the city. The magistrates of Glasgow seem\r\nto have exercised the privilege both of searching for lepers among the\r\ninhabitants, and of consigning them to this hospital. From the Burgh\r\nRecords, presented some time ago by Mr. Smith to the Maitland Club, it\r\nappears that in 1573 the magistrates ordained four persons, named as\r\nlepers, “to be viseit (inspected), and gif they be fund so, to be\r\nsecludit of the town to the Hospital at the Brigend.”[22] A similar\r\nedict was issued in regard to two other individuals in 1575,[23] and in\r\n1581 eight more seem to have been dealt with in the same manner.[24] The\r\nBishops of Glasgow appear also to have had a right to present patients\r\nto the hospital. In 1464, Andrew Muirhead, who then held the bishoprick,\r\navailed himself of the privilege by presenting one patient.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th August 1589, a report was given in to the magistrates of\r\nGlasgow, stating that six lepers were at that time in the house.[25] As\r\nlate as 1664, the ground-rents of this hospital were uplifted by the\r\nwater-bailie, an official who, according to an entry in the city records\r\nof Glasgow, was in the custom of giving in annually the number of lepers\r\nin the hospital at the Brigend. This hospital, like that of Kingcase,\r\nwas dedicated to the Gallovidian Saint, St. Ninian.\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh._—A leper hospital formerly existed at Greenside, which was\r\nthen a suburb, and not, as now, a constituent part of the city of\r\nEdinburgh. The history of the hospital and its laws are preserved in the\r\nTown-Council records. In 1584 the city Magistrates issued orders for\r\nfinding a commodious place for a leper-house.[26] In 1589, they passed\r\nan Act for building such an institution at Greenside, and apparently\r\nwith money granted to them for that purpose, by John Robertson, a\r\nmerchant in Edinburgh, and others, in pursuance of some previous\r\nvow.[27] On the 23d November 1591, five leper inhabitants of the city\r\nwere consigned to this hospital.[28] Two of the wives of the lepers\r\nvoluntarily shut themselves up in the hospital along with their diseased\r\nhusbands. I shall afterwards recur to the strict laws which the inmates\r\nwere bound to observe. In a charter of rights given to the city in 1636\r\nby Charles I. there are enumerated among the other grants which he\r\nconfirms to them, “the lands of old called the Greenside, with the\r\nleper-house and yard situate on the same, arable lands, banks, and\r\nmarishes thereof, for the present occupied by the lepers of the said\r\nhouse.”[29] The hospital, however, does not appear to have been of long\r\nduration. In 1652, the magistrates ordered that the roof of the\r\nleper-house be taken off, and its wood, slates, etc. used to repair the\r\ntown milns and other public buildings;[30] and in 1657, a similar\r\nappropriation was made of the stones contained in the walls of the\r\nleper-house, and in the fence around its yard or garden.[31]\r\n\r\n_Aberdeen._—In an old manuscript _Description of bothe Touns of\r\nAberdeen_, by James Gordon, as quoted in the entertaining _Book of Bon\r\nAccord_, the following notice of a leper hospital at Aberdeen\r\noccurs:[32] “Such as go out at the Gallowgate port towards Old Aberdeen,\r\nhaff way almost, may see the place where of old stood the lepers’\r\nhospital, called the seick-house, hard by the way syde. To which there\r\nwas a chappell adjoyned, dedicated to St. Anna, quhome the Papists\r\naccount patronesse of the lepers. The citizens licencit one Mr.\r\nAlexander Galloway, the person of Kinkell, for to build that chappell\r\nanno 1519. Now both these buildings are gone, and scarcely is the name\r\nknowne to many.” “On the 18th August 1574, the Regent Morton, and the\r\nLords of the Privy-Council commanded the Magistrates of Aberdeen to\r\nuptake fra James Leslie, present possessioure of the croft and myre\r\npertening to the Lipperfolk, the yeirle dewtie tharof off the five\r\nyeiris bypast; and thairvith, and sic vthir collectioune as may be\r\nhade, to caus the said house be theikkit (thatched, roofed) and reparit\r\nfor the resett of the said Lipperfolk in tym cuming: and to caus roup\r\nthe said croft and myre, to quha vill giff maist yeirle dewtie tharfor\r\nfra thre yeir to thre yeir: And to caus the haill proffeit to be\r\nemployit vpon the upolding of the said hous, and sustentation of the\r\nLiperfolks that salbe tharin.”[33]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eighteenth century the hospital and grounds were\r\nsold under the direction of the magistrates, and the money received\r\nappropriated to the establishment of a fund for a proposed lunatic\r\nasylum. The leper croft now belongs to King’s College.[34]\r\n\r\n_Rothfan, Elgin._—A leper-house seems to have existed from an early\r\nperiod at Rothfan, near Elgin. John Byseth made a gift to this hospital\r\nat Rothfan of the Church of Kyltalargyn, for the avowed purpose of\r\nmaintaining seven lepers, a servant and chaplain. The donor retained to\r\nhimself and his successors the privilege of preserving the number\r\ncomplete, by filling up the vacancies. On his request and presentation,\r\nWilliam, prior of the hospital, was admitted to the church in 1226.[35]\r\n\r\nThe precise date of Byseth’s charters is not preserved, but they seem to\r\nhave been drawn out during the reign of Alexander II. or III. From their\r\nphraseology the hospital evidently was in existence previous to that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe lands pertaining to this hospital are still known under the name of\r\nthe Leper Lands,[36] though the institution itself has been long\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n_Shetland._—Lastly, we have records of several small and temporary\r\nlazar-houses in Shetland. Thus, long ago, Brand (the honest missionary,\r\nas Hibbert terms him) states that in that country the “scurvy sometimes\r\ndegenerates into leprosy, and is discerned by hairs falling from the\r\neyebrows, the nose falling in, etc., which” (he adds), “when the people\r\ncome to know, they separate and set them apart for fear of infection,\r\nbuilding huts or little houses for them in the field. I saw the ruines\r\nof one of these houses about half-a-mile from Lerwick, where a woman was\r\nfor some years kept for this reason. These scorbutick persons are more\r\nordinarily in Dunrossness and Delton, and more rare in other\r\nplaces.”[37]\r\n\r\n“Formerly” (says Dr. Edmondston, another and more recent author on the\r\nShetlands), “when leprosy was very prevalent, the unfortunate\r\nindividuals who were seized with it were removed to small huts erected\r\nfor the purpose, and there received a scanty allowance of provisions\r\ndaily, until the disease put a period to their miserable existence.”[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF HOSPITALS, AND EXTENT OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish lazar-houses that I have thus enumerated, though few in\r\nnumber, are still sufficient to show that the disease for which they\r\nwere instituted was generally diffused over the extent of the kingdom.\r\nThus, we have found the establishments in question spread from\r\nBerwickshire to Shetland, and from Aberdeen to Ayr. More research than I\r\nhave been able to bestow upon the matter would no doubt bring to light\r\nnotices of various additional hospitals. In some Scottish towns names\r\nand notices still exist sufficient to lead to the probability of\r\nlazar-houses having formerly existed in them, though that evidence is in\r\nother respects altogether incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of Edinburgh a leper station probably\r\nexisted at a date greatly earlier than that of the Greenside Hospital.\r\nIn his _Caledonia_,[39] the late excellent antiquary and philologist,\r\nGeorge Chalmers, expresses his belief in the opinion suggested by the\r\nRev. Mr. White, that the name of the village of Liberton (two miles\r\nsouth of Edinburgh) is merely a corruption of Liper town,—liper being\r\nthe old Scotch term for leprosy; and, as is well known, the letters _p_\r\nand _b_ being constantly interchanged for one another in the composition\r\nand transmutation of words. This idea is certainly in no small degree\r\ncountenanced by the circumstance that the lands of Upper Liberton\r\n(Libertune) in some old writs are described under the name of “terrarum\r\nde Spittle town” (Hospital town.)[40]\r\n\r\nBesides, the “Oily or Balm Well of St. Catherine’s at Liberton,” had\r\nbeen long held in high estimation in curing cutaneous diseases, and\r\nstill maintained great repute as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. In his brief but interesting _Cosmography and Description of\r\nAlbion_, Boece, Canon of Aberdeen, at the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, states that the oil of this well “valet contra varias cutis\r\nscabricies.”—_Historiæ Scotorum_ (1526), p. xi.[41]\r\n\r\nJ. Monipennie alleges that its oil or “fatness is of a sudain operation\r\nto heal all salt scabs and humors that trouble the outward skin of\r\nman.”[42] Dr. Hare makes mention of it to the same purpose.[43] After\r\nthe institution of the monastery of St. Catherine of Sienna (_Scotticé_,\r\nSheens) on the Burrow Moor, at a short distance south of the city walls\r\nof Edinburgh, the Dominican nuns belonging to it made, in honour of St.\r\nCatherine, an annual solemn procession to the chapel and balm well of\r\nLiberton.[44]\r\n\r\nThis “oily or balm well” of Liberton was sufficient to excite the\r\nadmiration and engage the protective care of the credulous King James\r\nVI. In a curious monograph[45] on the virtues of the well, published at\r\nEdinburgh in 1664, the author, “Mathew Mackaile, Chirurgo-Medicine.”\r\nindulges himself (p. 117) in the following historical eulogium and\r\nanathema in regard to it:—\r\n\r\n“His Majesty King James the Sixth, the first monarch of Great Britain,\r\nof blessed memory, had such a great estimation of this rare well, that\r\nwhen he returned from England to visit this his ancient kingdom of\r\nScotland in anno 1617, he went in person to see it, and ordered that it\r\nshould be built with stones from the bottom to the top, and that a door\r\nand a pair of stairs should be made for it, that men might have the more\r\neasie access unto its bottom for getting of the oyl. This royal command\r\nbeing obeyed, the well was adorned and preserved, until the year 1650,\r\nwhen that execrable regicide and usurper, Oliver Cromwell, with his\r\nrebellious and sacrilegious accomplices, did invade this kingdom, and\r\nnot only deface such rare and ancient monuments of Nature’s handwork,\r\nbut also the synagogues of the God of nature.”\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to insist further upon such problematical evidence\r\nin regard to the probable extent and prevalence of the disease in\r\nScotland. A proof of this, of a much stronger character, is afforded by\r\nthe simple fact that, as late as the reign of James I. the victims of\r\nthe disease were made the subject of a direct and special legislative\r\nenactment in the Scottish Parliament held at Perth in the year 1427. I\r\nshall quote one short clause from this act “anent Lipper Folke”[46] (as\r\nit is termed), to illustrate both the apparent prevalence of the malady\r\nat that time, and this circumstance, that the burghs of the kingdom are\r\nthen spoken of as possessing, or obliged to possess, lazar-houses of\r\ntheir own. The second clause is to the following effect: “Item, that na\r\nLipper Folke sit to thig (beg) neither in kirk nor kirkzaird, nor other\r\nplace within the burrowes, but at their own hospital, and at the port of\r\nthe towne and other places outwith the burrowes.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form any approach as to the number affected in this\r\ncountry. The hospitals that I have enumerated do not seem calculated to\r\ncontain many patients. As we have already seen, that of Ayr contained at\r\nleast eight patients; Rothfan, seven; five were admitted into the\r\nGreenside hospital at its first opening in 1591; and in a report of the\r\nGlasgow hospital, submitted to the magistrates in 1589, six lepers were\r\nreported as then belonging to that institution. These data are entirely\r\ninadequate to draw any conclusion from, and the more so, that here, as\r\nin England, the disease was probably more extensively spread during the\r\neleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries than afterwards; and it is\r\nexactly at that remote period that all our Scottish records are most\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nIn these early times the very words employed to designate the disease\r\nshow its extent and severity. Somner, Lye, and Bosworth, in their\r\nseveral Dictionaries of the old Anglo-Saxon language, all quote the\r\nremarkable expression, “_seo mycle adl_,” “the mickle ail” or great\r\ndisease, as signifying “elephantiasis” or “leprosie;” and it is worthy\r\nof observation, in reference to the same point, that the delightful old\r\nFrench chronicler, Sir John Froissart, who visited Scotland in the time\r\nof Robert II., applies, as we shall afterwards see, the analogous term\r\nof “la grosse maladie” to one noted case of leprosy in this country.\r\nSome further idea may be formed of the frequency of the disease, at\r\nleast in the border counties of Scotland, when I state that, before the\r\nyear 1200, there existed various hospitals for the exclusive reception\r\nof lepers in the immediately adjoining English counties of\r\nNorthumberland, Cumberland, and Durham. Three alone of these hospitals\r\ncontained as many as ninety-one lepers in all—viz. the hospital of\r\nSherburne, near Durham,[47] contained sixty-five; St. Nicholas,\r\nCarlisle,[48] contained thirteen; and Bolton, in Northumberland,\r\nfounded, as its charter[49] bears, by Robert de Roos, “pro salute animae\r\nmeae et omnium antecessorum et successorum meorum,” was endowed for\r\nother thirteen.\r\n\r\nI may here take the opportunity of stating that the labours of different\r\nEnglish antiquaries, and more particularly the investigations of Leland,\r\nDugdale, and Tanner, into the Monastic History of England, tend to show\r\nthat at an early period many leper-houses were scattered over England\r\nand Wales. In searching through the works of these authors, and more\r\nparticularly through the late splendid edition of the _Monasticon\r\nAnglicanum_, with the numerous additions of Caley, Ellis, and Bandinel,\r\nI have found references to between eighty and ninety English\r\nlazar-houses.[50]\r\n\r\nIn the second and third volumes of the _Monasticon Anglicanum_ (1st\r\nedition) above ninety[51] charters or other notices of English hospitals\r\nare published, and of these twenty-one at least were hospitals for the\r\nreception of lepers. Bloomefield[52] mentions eighteen leper-houses in\r\nNorfolk alone; and Taylor,[53] in his _Index Monasticus_, enumerates\r\ntwenty in that single county. Six of these were placed in Norwich or its\r\nimmediate vicinity, and five at Lynne Regis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTS, CHARACTER, AND GOVERNMENT OF THE LEPER HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nThe leper hospitals, both in Scotland and elsewhere, were intended\r\nmerely as receptacles to seclude the infected, not as houses in which a\r\ncure of them was to be attempted. They were charitable and hygienic\r\nrather than medical institutions.\r\n\r\nAt the present day tubercular leprosy is still regarded as a disease\r\nwhich sets at defiance all the powers of the medical art. Our ancestors\r\nhad so firm a belief in the same doctrine, that, in the case of one of\r\nthe unfortunate wretches who was tried in Edinburgh in 1597 for\r\nwitchcraft, amongst the gravest of the accusations brought against the\r\npanel was this, that she (Christian Livingstone) “affirmit that she culd\r\nhaill (cure) leprosie, quhilk (the libel adds) the maist expert men in\r\nmedicine are not abil to do.” Some of the means of cure she had employed\r\nhave never, I am afraid, been allowed a place in any of our\r\npharmacopœias. I may allude, therefore, as a specimen to one of them\r\namongst others—viz. (and I quote the words of the libel) “she took a\r\nreid cock, slew it, baked a bannock (cake) with the blude of it, and gaf\r\n(gave) the samyn to the Leper to eat.”[54]\r\n\r\nI leave it to the dogmatism of the pharmacologists to decide whether\r\nmore potent virtues should be ascribed to this recipe of Christian\r\nLivingstone’s or to that deliberately offered with the same purport by\r\nour celebrated countryman Michael Scott. “It ought to be known” (says\r\nthe great Fifeshire philosopher) “that the blood of dogs and of infants\r\ntwo years old or under, when diffused through a bath of heated water,\r\ndispels the Leprosy without a doubt” (_absque dubio liberat\r\nLepram_).[55]\r\n\r\nThe miraculous properties of the relics of saints were in some instances\r\nstrongly relied upon as an article of the Materia Medica, fit among\r\nother things to cure this incurable malady. Fosbroke[56] mentions a\r\nfountain near Moissac, described by Peyrat (abbot of that place, in the\r\nfourteenth century), the waters of which were so medicated by the\r\nrelics of a saint contained in the neighbouring abbey that the crowds of\r\nlepers who resorted to it bathed and were immediately cured. But the\r\nvalued fountain was not sufficiently powerful to avert the disease being\r\ncommunicated to the monks, or to save them even when once they were\r\ncontaminated; and at last, according to the confessions of the abbot, it\r\nwas shut up in consequence of some of the order dying of the very malady\r\nwhich their famed waters could infallibly remove.\r\n\r\nIn the sequel, when considering the causes of the disease, and the\r\nregulations of medical police, adopted in regard to the infected, I\r\nshall have occasion to speak at length of the strict rules to which the\r\ninmates of most of the leper-hospitals were subjected—not for the sake\r\nof medical treatment, but with the purpose only of preventing the\r\ndissemination of the malady.\r\n\r\nBesides being places for the isolation of the infected, the\r\nleper-hospitals of Scotland and England were often, like the\r\ncorresponding institutions of the continent of Europe, founded and\r\nendowed as religious establishments; and, as such, they were generally\r\nsubmitted to the sway of some neighbouring abbey or monastery.\r\nSemler[57] quotes, indeed, a Papal bull, appointing every leper-house to\r\nbe provided with its own churchyard,[58] chapel, and ecclesiastics—(cum\r\ncimiterio ecclesiam construere, et proprio gaudere presbyterio)—an\r\norder against the latter part of which the poverty of many of the\r\nhospitals in Great Britain formed a very secure guarantee. The Greenside\r\nHospital in Edinburgh, being founded at a very late period, partook,\r\nperhaps, less of the character of a religious establishment than most\r\nothers in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe rules established for the domestic and religious duties of the\r\ninmates belonging to it, by the commissioners appointed by the\r\nmagistrates of the city, were few and simple, viz.—\r\n\r\n“That the said persons, and ilk ane (every one) of thame leif (live)\r\nquetlie, and gif (give) na sclander, be banning, sweyring, flyting,\r\nskalding, filthie speaking, or vitious leving, or any oyder way, under\r\nthe paynes to be enjoynit by the counsall.\r\n\r\n“That thair be appoyntit ane ordinair reider to reid the prayeris evrie\r\nSabboth to the said lepperis, and ane commodious place appoyntit to the\r\nsaid reider for that effect.”[59]\r\n\r\nOver some of our Scotch lazar-houses, chaplains, and religious officers\r\nwith the high-church title of priors, were placed.\r\n\r\nThe prior of Rothfan Hospital was, at the intercession of the founder of\r\nthe house, admitted to the church. There was one chaplain under him.\r\n\r\nIn the records of the burgh of Prestwick there is an incidental entry,\r\nshowing that there was a prior placed over the Kingcase Hospital near\r\nAyr in 1507, for “George Yong, Prior of Kingiscase, accusyt Thome Greif\r\nof four barrels of beyr, and the said Thomas grantyt 24 shillings, but\r\ndenyit ye beer.”[60] We have already seen that there were chapels\r\nannexed to the Kingcase and Aberdeen Hospitals. Our history of the other\r\nlazar-houses in Scotland is so imperfect as not to enable us to state\r\nwhether they were equally well provided; but certainly many of the\r\nricher leper and other hospitals in England had, as appears from their\r\nbetter preserved records, free chapels attached to them, with resident\r\nregular or secular canons. In the Sherburne Leper Hospital, near Durham,\r\nthere were, besides the prior, four priests and four attendant\r\nclerks.[61] The hospital of St. Giles, Norwich, was provided with a\r\nmaster or prior, and an establishment of eight regular canons acting as\r\nchaplains, two clerks, seven choristers, and two sisters; while the only\r\npermanent residents to whose wants they were required to minister were\r\neight poor bed-ridden subjects![62]\r\n\r\nBoth the ecclesiastical officers of the leper hospitals, and the leprous\r\ninmates themselves, were in general strictly enjoined, by the foundation\r\ncharters and regulations of their institutions, to observe strict\r\nreligious formulæ, and especially to offer up prayers for the souls of\r\nthe founder and his family. That the duties connected with this last\r\noffice were in some instances by no means slight, will be sufficiently\r\napparent by the following extract from the laws of the leper hospital at\r\nIlleford, in Essex, which I translate from the regulations established\r\nfor the house in 1346 by Baldok, Bishop of London:—[63]\r\n\r\n“We also command that the Lepers omit not attendance at their church, to\r\nhear divine service, unless prevented by grievous bodily infirmity; they\r\nare to preserve silence there, and hear matins and mass throughout, if\r\nthey are able; and whilst there, to be intent on prayer and devotion, as\r\nfar as their infirmity permits them. We desire also and command that, as\r\nit was ordained of old in the said hospital, every leprous brother\r\nshall, every day, say for the morning duty a Pater noster and Ave Maria,\r\nthirteen times; and for the other hours of the day respectively, namely,\r\nthe first, third, sixth hour of the vespers, and again at the hour of\r\nthe concluding service, a Pater noster and Ave Maria seven times; and\r\nbesides the aforesaid prayers, each leprous brother shall say a Pater\r\nand Ave thirty times every day for the founders of the hospital and the\r\nbishop of the place, and all his benefactors, and all other true\r\nbelievers, living or dead; and on the day on which any one of their\r\nnumber departs from this life, let each leprous brother say in addition,\r\nfifty Paters and Aves, three times, for the soul of the departed, and\r\nthe souls of all deceased believers. But if any one shall openly\r\n(_manifeste_) transgress the said rules, or any one of them, for each\r\ntransgression let him receive a condign punishment according to the\r\namount of the offence, from the Master of the said hospital, who is\r\notherwise called the Prior. But if a leprous brother secretly\r\n(_occultè_) fails in the performance of these articles, let him consult\r\nthe priest of the said hospital in the Penitential Court.”\r\n\r\nIn several of the hospitals the passions of the inmates were endeavoured\r\nto be restrained by the laws laid down by their Superior. Thus the\r\narticles of the leper-house of St. Julian, at St. Albans, contain the\r\nfollowing significant regulations of Abbot Michael _de accessu\r\nMulierum_. “And since by the access of women scandal and evils of no\r\nslight nature arise, we above all things forbid that any woman enter the\r\nhospital of the brothers, with the exception of the common laundress of\r\nthe house, who must be of mature age and discreet manner of life (maturæ\r\naetatis et bonae conversationis), so that no suspicion can attach to\r\nher. And she must not presume to enter the house at suspicious times,\r\nbut at the proper hours, so that her entrance and exit may be seen by\r\nall. But if a mother or sister, or any other honest matron, come there\r\nfor the purpose of visiting the infirm, she may have access to the one\r\nwith whom she wishes to speak, and this may be done by the permission of\r\nthe Custos; without which they are not to enter, whatever may be their\r\nrank. But women of light fame and evil reputation are by no means to\r\nenter the houses.”[64]\r\n\r\nThe Custos, Master, Dean or Prior, and in some houses the Prioress,[65]\r\nseems in general to have had full control over the leprous inmates of\r\nthe hospital. Thus, in the laws which have been transmitted to us of the\r\nSherburne Hospital, it is laid down that members were to be punished for\r\ndisobedience or idleness, at the discretion of the prior, by corporal\r\ncorrection with the birch, “_modo scholarium_.” Offenders who refused to\r\nsubmit to this chastisement had their diet reduced to bread and water,\r\nand after the third offence were liable to be ejected.[66]\r\n\r\nMatthew Paris has left us a copy of the vow which the lepers of the\r\nhospital of St. Julian, at St. Albans, were obliged to take before\r\nadmission. I append a translation of it as a document highly\r\nillustrative of this part of our subject:—\r\n\r\n“I, brother B, promise and, taking my bodily oath by touching the most\r\nsacred Gospel, affirm, before God and all his saints in this church,\r\nwhich is constructed in honour of St. Julian the confessor, in the\r\npresence of Dominus R. the Archdeacon, that all the days of my life I\r\nwill be subservient and obedient to the commands of the Lord Abbot of\r\nSt. Albans for the time being, and to his archdeacon; resisting them in\r\nnothing, unless such things should be commanded as would militate\r\nagainst the Divine pleasure. I will never commit theft, nor bring a\r\nfalse accusation against any one of the brethren, nor infringe the vow\r\nof chastity, nor fail in my duty by appropriating anything or leaving\r\nanything by will to others, unless by a dispensation granted by the\r\nbrothers. I will make it my study wholly to avoid all kind of usury, as\r\na monstrous thing, and hateful to God.[67] I will not be aiding and\r\nabetting, in word or thought, directly or indirectly, in any plan by\r\nwhich any one shall be appointed custos or master of the Lepers of St.\r\nJulian, except the person appointed by the Lord Abbot of St. Albans. I\r\nwill be content, without strife or complaint, with the food and drink,\r\nand other things given and allowed me by the master, according to the\r\nusage and custom of the house. I will not transgress the bounds\r\nprescribed to me, without the special license of my superiors, and with\r\ntheir consent and will; and if I prove an offender against any article\r\nnamed above, it is my wish that the Lord Abbot or his substitute may\r\npunish me according to the nature and amount of the offence, as shall\r\nseem best to him, and even to cast me forth an apostate from the\r\ncongregation of the brethren, without hope of remission, except through\r\nthe special grace of the Lord Abbot.”[68]\r\n\r\nI have only very briefly to advert to one other subject, before closing\r\nthese remarks on the government of the English leper hospitals. I have\r\nalready alluded to a special order of knighthood having been established\r\nat an early period for the care and superintendence of lepers.\r\nBelloy[69] carries back the origin of this order in Palestine to a very\r\nearly period in the history of the Christian church. We know as a matter\r\nof greater historical certainty that the knights of St. Lazarus\r\nseparated from the general order of Knights Hospitallers about the end\r\nof the eleventh or commencement of the twelfth century.[70]\r\n\r\nFrom the locality of their original establishment, and from their\r\ncentral preceptory being near Jerusalem, they were at first generally\r\ndesignated Knights of St. Lazarus, or of St. Lazarus and St. Mary of\r\nJerusalem. Latterly they were conjoined by different European Princes\r\nwith the Military Orders of Notre-Dame, Mount Carmel, and St.\r\nMaurice.[71]\r\n\r\nSaint Louis brought twelve of the Knights of St. Lazarus into France,\r\nand entrusted them with the superintendence of the Ladreries or leper\r\nhospitals of his kingdom.[72] The first notice of their having acquired\r\na footing in Great Britain is in the time of King Stephen. During the\r\nreign of that sovereign their head establishment in England at Burton\r\nLazars, Leicestershire, was built by (as Nicols[73] states) a general\r\ncollection throughout the kingdom, but chiefly by the assistance of\r\nRobert de Mowbray. Here they gradually acquired considerable wealth and\r\npossessions.[74] I find that the Hospitals of Tilton, of the Holy\r\nInnocents at Lincoln, of St. Giles, London, the Preceptory of Choseley\r\nin Norfolk, and perhaps various others, were betimes annexed to Burton\r\nLazars as cells containing “fratres leprosos de Sancto Lazaro de\r\nJerusalem.” Nicols has printed not less than thirty-five charters\r\nrelating to the House of Burton Lazars. Its privileges and possessions\r\nwere confirmed by Henry II., King John, and Henry VI. It was at last\r\ndissolved by Henry VIII.[75] The only settlement of the Knights of St.\r\nLazarus in Scotland that I have been able to find, was in the town of\r\nLinlithgow, and the notice of it is very imperfect and unsatisfactory.\r\nIt is contained in a document of the reign of Alexander II., and\r\npreserved in the Chartulary of Newbottle, in which reference is\r\nexpressly made to land held “de Fratribus de Sancto Lazaro” at\r\nLinlithgow.[76] That the Lazarites had an establishment or\r\nestablishments in Scotland as well as in the sister kingdom, appears\r\nborne out by a fact recorded by Helyot,[77] that in 1342, John Halliday,\r\na Scotsman, was appointed Governor of the Knights of St. Lazarus both in\r\nEngland and Scotland, by the Grand Master of Boigny in France, who was\r\nat that period the reputed head of the order. Indeed Pennecuik, on the\r\nauthority of Maimbourg (_Histoire des Croisades_), asserts that the\r\n“Knights of St. Lazarus were numerous everywhere, but especially in\r\nScotland and France.”[78]\r\n\r\nThe first and original object of the Knights of St. Lazarus seems to\r\nhave been the care probably of the sick generally, but in a special\r\nmanner of those affected with leprosy.[79] They received lepers into\r\ntheir order, superintended the inmates of the lazar-houses, and, till\r\nthe standing rule to the contrary was allowed to be changed by Pope\r\nInnocent IV., they were obliged to elect a leper to be their Grand\r\nMaster;[80] “eatenus consuetudine observatâ ut Miles leprosus domûs\r\nSancti Lazari Hierosolymitani in ejus Magistrum assumeretur.”[81]\r\n\r\nToussaint de S. Luc, in his History, Ceremonials, etc., of the Order of\r\nSt. Lazarus, after it was united in 1608 by Henry IV. of France to those\r\nof Notre-Dame and Mount Carmel, states that the candidates for this\r\nunited knighthood were obliged, upon the Holy Evangelists, to swear\r\n_inter alia_, “to exercise charity and works of mercy towards the poor,\r\nand particularly lepers” (_et particulièrement les lepreux_.)[82]\r\n\r\nWhat extent and what kind of sway, if any, the Lazarite Knights of\r\nEngland and Scotland were ever allowed to exert over the lepers of the\r\nkingdom generally, or over the inmates of these leper cells and\r\nhospitals that more especially belonged to them, I have not been able to\r\nascertain from any of the British historical records of the middle ages\r\nthat I have had an opportunity of consulting. It is, however, only too\r\nprobable that the Lazarites, like most of the other early orders of\r\nknights, were induced by pride and avarice to turn from their original\r\nobjects of love and charity to others,—to views of power and\r\naggrandisement for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF ENDOWMENT OF THE HOSPITALS, DIET, ETC.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scottish leper-houses were very poorly or not at all\r\nendowed. Their principal subsistence seems to have been derived from\r\ncasual alms. Each of the doomed inmates of the hospitals was, like the\r\nleper-struck heroine of the old Scottish poet, Henryson, by\r\n\r\n  ... cauld and hounger sair\r\n  Compellit to be ane rank beggair.[83]\r\n\r\nThe inmates of the Greenside or Edinburgh lazar-house were allowed four\r\nshillings Scotch (about fourpence sterling) per week, and for the\r\nremainder of their subsistence they were, according to the original\r\nrules of the institution, obliged to beg at the gate of their\r\nhospital.[84] The leper-house at Aberdeen was supported from the public\r\nfunds of the town; but in 1591 James VI. granted a charter to “Robert\r\nAbell and remanent of the pure (poor) leprous personis and thair\r\nsuccessors” in the hospital, to draw one peat of custom from every load\r\nof them brought to the markets of Aberdeen, in consequence (as the words\r\nof the original charter bear) “of the smallness of the rent appointit\r\nfor the leprous personis in the Hospitall being unable to sustene thame\r\nin meet and fyre, quhairthrow they leif verie miserablie.”[85]\r\n\r\nOther Scottish lazar-houses, however, were comparatively wealthy. Thus,\r\nI have already mentioned that the Kingcase Hospital, near Ayr, had some\r\nlarge and extensive landed properties attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe inmates of most of the smaller English leper-houses seem also to\r\nhave principally depended for their subsistence upon the precarious\r\ncontributions of the charitable. One of the lepers of the hospital at\r\nBeccles was, by a royal grant, empowered to beg for his leprous\r\nbrothers.[86] Several of the larger English hospitals, however, were\r\nwell endowed, and the food, clothing, etc., of the inmates amply\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nIn some instances these endowments consisted of the accumulations of\r\nlarge and voluntary charities; in others they were made up of rich\r\ngrants, left for the avowed purpose of founding chantries for the\r\nspiritual peace and pardon of the donor and his family; and in other\r\ncases, again, they were originally obtained as direct propitiations to\r\nthe church for misconduct and crime. Indulgences[87] of forty days’\r\npardon seem to have been occasionally granted by the bishops and other\r\necclesiastical dignitaries to all the benefactors of the hospitals.\r\n\r\nA bull of Pope Alexander III., which has been already referred to,\r\ngranted all leper hospital possessions an exemption from the payment of\r\ntithes.[88] The canon was not universally adhered to in England, for, in\r\nthe account which Archbishop Parker drew up in 1562 of the hospitals in\r\nthe diocese of Canterbury, while Herbaldone and Bobbing leper-houses are\r\nreported as “not charged with the taxes of the tenths,” it is declared\r\nof the leper hospital of St. Laurence, Canterbury, that “the same is\r\ntaxed and payeth the perpetual tenth.”[89]\r\n\r\nFrom the _Valor Ecclesiasticus_, taken in the time of Henry VIII., it\r\nappears that whilst forty-eight hospitals, leper-houses, and\r\nlazar-houses in the diocese of Norwich and county of Norfolk possessed\r\nonly a revenue of about £158 in all,[90] the rentals, on the other hand,\r\nof certain individual hospitals were comparatively great for that\r\nperiod. Thus, the revenues of Herbaldone[91] Hospital, Kent, and St.\r\nJames’, London,[92] were each rated at £100; of Sherburne above\r\n£140;[93] of Maiden Bradley at near £200;[94] and those of the\r\nestablishment and “veri fair hospital” (as Leland terms it),[95] of\r\nBurton Lazars were valued above £260.[96] In some of these richer\r\ninstitutions the inmates were, as I have just remarked, well provided\r\nfor. As illustrative of this, I may quote the diet-table, etc., of one\r\nor two of the wealthier leper hospitals. Thus, among the rules published\r\nin the Additamenta to Matthew Paris, as established about the middle of\r\nthe fourteenth century by the Abbot Michaele for the leper-house of St.\r\nJulian, near St. Albans, we find the following regulations laid down\r\nwith regard to the commons of the leprous brothers (de distributionibus\r\nfratrum leprosorum):—[97]\r\n\r\n“Let every leprous brother receive from the property of the hospital,\r\nfor his living and all necessaries, whatever he has been accustomed to\r\nreceive by the custom observed of old in the said hospital, namely,\r\nevery week seven loaves, of which five shall be white and two brown,\r\nmade from the grain as thrashed from the ear; also, every seventh week,\r\nfourteen gallons of beer, or eight-pence (octo denarios) for the same.\r\nLet him have, in addition to this, on the feasts of all the saints, on\r\nthe feast of Saint Julian, the purification of the Blessed Mary, the\r\nAnnunciation, the Trinity, Saint Albans, Saint John the Baptist, the\r\nAssumption of the Blessed Mary, and the Nativity of the same, for each\r\nfeast, one loaf, one jar of beer, or a penny for the same, and one\r\nobolus, which is called the charity of the aforesaid hospital; also, let\r\nevery leprous brother receive, at the feast of Christmas, forty gallons\r\nof good beer, or forty pence for the same. Also, let each receive on the\r\nsaid feast his share of two quarters of pure and clean corn, which is\r\ncalled the great charity. Also, at the feast of St. Martin, each leper\r\nshall have one pig from the common stall, and that there may be a fair\r\ndivision of the pigs amongst the brothers, according to the custom\r\nobserved of old, we desire that the pigs, according to the number of\r\nthe lepers, may be brought forward in their presence, if it can\r\nconveniently be done, otherwise in another place fit for the purpose,\r\nand there each, according to the priority of entering the hospital,\r\nshall choose one pig (otherwise a sum of money to be distributed equal\r\nto the value of the pigs). Also, each leper shall receive on the feast\r\nof Saint Valentine, for the whole of the ensuing year, one quarter of\r\noats. Also, about the feast of St. John Baptist, two bushels of salt, or\r\nthe current price. Also, at the feast of St. Julian, and at the feast of\r\nSt. Alban, one penny for the accustomed pittance. Also, at Easter one\r\npenny, which is called by them ‘Flavvonespeni.’ Also, on Ascension-Day,\r\none obolus for buying potherbs. Also, on each Wednesday in Lent, bolted\r\ncorn of the weight of one of their loaves. Also, on the feast of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist, four shillings for clothes. Also, at Christmas, let\r\nthere be distributed in equal portions among the leprous brothers,\r\nfourteen shillings for their fuel through the year, as has been ordained\r\nof old for the sake of peace and concord. Also, since, by the bounty of\r\nour Lord the King, thirty shillings and fivepence have been assigned for\r\never for the use of the lepers, which sum the Viscount of Hertford has\r\nto pay them annually at the feasts of Easter and Michaelmas, we command\r\nthat the said 30s. and 5d. be equally divided among them in the usual\r\nmanner; and we desire the brothers to be contented with the aforesaid\r\ndistributions, which have been accustomed to be made amongst the leprous\r\nbrothers of old: But the residue of the property of the said hospital we\r\norder and decree to be applied to the support of the Master and Priests\r\nof the said Hospital.”\r\n\r\nThe dress of the lepers is laid down in regulations equally precise.\r\n“The brothers are to have a tunic and upper tunic of russet, with a hood\r\ncut from the same, so that the sleeves of the tunic be closed as far as\r\nthe hand, but not laced with knots or thread after the secular fashion.\r\nThey are to wear the upper tunic closed down to the ankles, and a close\r\ncape of black cloth, of the same length with the hood, as they have been\r\naccustomed of old.” A particular form of shoe was also ordered, and if\r\nthe order was disobeyed, the culprit was “condemned to walk daily\r\nbarefooted until the Master, considering his humility, said to\r\nhim—enough.”—P. 168.\r\n\r\nThe diet-roll of the large hospital at Sherburne is still more complex\r\nthan that of St. Julian’s. I extract the heads of it, and of some other\r\nparticulars with regard to the internal economy of the house, from\r\nSurtees’ elaborate work, in which copies of the original documents are\r\ngiven at full length.\r\n\r\nThe daily allowance of the lepers of Sherburne was a loaf weighing five\r\nmarks, and a gallon of ale to each; and betwixt every two, one mess or\r\ncommons of flesh three days in the week, and of fish, cheese, or butter,\r\non the remaining four; on high festival, a double mess; and, in\r\nparticular, on the feast of St. Cuthbert, in Lent, fresh salmon\r\n(_salmones recentes_), if it could be had; if not, other fresh fish; and\r\non Michaelmas day four messed on one goose. With fresh fish, flesh, or\r\neggs, a measure of salt was delivered. When fresh fish could not be had,\r\nred herrings (_allecia rubea_) were served three to a single mess; (and\r\nit was specially enjoined that they, or aught that was served up, was\r\nnot to be putrid, nor corrupt, nor from animals that had died of\r\ndisease)[98]; or cheese and butter by weight; or three eggs. During\r\nLent each had a razer (_rasarium_) of wheat to make furmenty\r\n(_simulam_), and two razers of beans to boil; sometimes greens or\r\nonions; and every day, except Sunday, the seventh part of a razer of\r\nbean meal, but on Sunday a measure and a half of pulse to make gruel.\r\nRed herrings were prohibited from Pentecost to Michaelmas, and at the\r\nlatter each received two razers of apples. The lepers had a common\r\nkitchen, and a common cook, fuel, and utensils for cooking, etc.—viz. a\r\nlead, two brazen pots, a table, a large wooden vessel for washing or\r\nmaking wine, a laver, two ale vats, and two bathing vats.\r\n\r\nThe sick had fire and candle, and all necessaries, until they either\r\nconvalesced or died; and one of the chaplains was assigned to hear the\r\nconfessions of the sick, to read the gospel to them on Sundays and\r\nholidays, and to read the burial-service for the dead. The old woman who\r\nattended on the sick had every week three wheaten loaves, and one mess\r\nof flesh or fish; and when a brother or sister was buried, the\r\ngrave-digger had his meat and drink. Each leper had a yearly allowance\r\nfor his clothing of three yards of woollen cloth, white or russet, six\r\nyards of linen, and six of canvass, and the tailor had his meat and\r\ndrink the day on which he came to cut out their clothes. Four fires were\r\nallowed for the whole community. From Michaelmas to All Saints they had\r\ntwo baskets of peat on double mess days, and four baskets daily from All\r\nSaints to Easter. On Christmas eve they had four yule logs, each a\r\ncart-load (“unusquisque erit unius quadrigatae”), with four trusses of\r\nstraw; four trusses of straw on All Saints eve and Easter eve; and four\r\nbundles of rushes on the eves of Pentecost, St. John Baptist, and St.\r\nMary Magdalene; and on the anniversary of Martin de Sancta Cruce, every\r\nleper received five shillings and fivepence in money.\r\n\r\nThe good food, lodging, and raiment provided by the rich endowments of\r\nSherburne were not without some alloy. The rules of the house were\r\nstrict, and the religious duties enforced upon the inmates were of an\r\naustere character. “All the leprous brethren, whose health permitted,\r\nwere every day expected to attend matins, nones, vespers, and complines.\r\nThe bed-rid sick were enjoined to raise themselves, and say matins in\r\ntheir bed; and for those who were still weaker, let them rest in peace,\r\n_et quod dicere possint dicant_.” During Lent and Advent all the\r\nbrethren were required to receive corporal discipline three days in the\r\nweek, and the sisters, in like manner, _donec omnes vapulent_. And all\r\nthese, and other laws, Bishop Kellaw “did by his charter confirm and\r\norder ever thereafter ‘_inviolabiter observari_.’”[99]\r\n\r\nOn the Continent the lazar hospitals partook of the same differences in\r\nregard to poverty and wealth as we have traced in Britain. In France,\r\nsome of them, however, had become so very amply endowed by the\r\ncommencement of the fourteenth century that they at last excited the\r\navarice of Philip V., who subjected many of their inmates to the\r\nflames.[100] “They were burned alive” (_on les bruloit tout vifs_), says\r\nthe historian Mezeray, “in order that the fire might purify at one and\r\nthe same time the infection of the body and that of the soul.”[101] The\r\nostensible cause for this act of fiendish barbarity was the absurd\r\nallegation, that (as the original ordonnance of Philip bears[102]) the\r\nlepers of France and other parts had been bribed to commit “the\r\ndetestable sin and horrible crime” (detestabile flagitium et crimen\r\nhorrendum) of poisoning the wells, waters, etc., used by the Christians.\r\nThe real cause, there is little doubt, was a desire, through this flimsy\r\nexcuse, to rob the richer hospitals of their funds and possessions; and\r\nthis appears only too strongly in the anxiety displayed in the special\r\nwording of Philip’s original edict, that all the goods of the lepers be\r\nlodged and held for himself, (ordinavimus, _inter alia_, quod omnia bona\r\neorum ad manum nostrum ponerentur et tenerentur.)[103] The persecution\r\nof them was again temporarily renewed in 1388, under Charles VI. of\r\nFrance.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\nDATES OF THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF LEPROSY IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written regarding the date of the first appearance of\r\nLeprosy in western Europe.\r\n\r\nBy Astruc,[105] Bach,[106] and others, it has been averred that the\r\nleprosy of the middle ages was introduced from the East by those who\r\nreturned from the crusades. Some of our own historians, as Fuller[107]\r\nand Heron,[108] allege that by this means it first reached Great\r\nBritain. It is quite possible, allowing the disease for the sake of\r\nargument to be contagious, that through the increased international\r\nintercourse of that period, it may have been propagated more rapidly and\r\nwidely than would otherwise have occurred; but there are ample reasons\r\nand proofs for believing that it existed on the continent of Europe, and\r\neven as far westward as England, before the crusade fanaticism had drawn\r\nany converts from this country.\r\n\r\nThe first relay of Englishmen engaged in the crusade left in 1096, and\r\nreturned two years afterwards. Several English leper-houses were founded\r\nbefore that period.\r\n\r\nLanfranc, Bishop of Canterbury, and the ecclesiastical favourite of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, died, according to the evidence of the Saxon\r\nChronicle in 1089,[109] seven years previous to the first crusade.\r\nDuring his lifetime he founded two hospitals near Canterbury, one a\r\nhouse built of stone (lapideum domum decentem et amplum) for patients\r\naffected with various descriptions of diseases (variis infirmitatum\r\nqualitatibus), and the second an hospital constructed of houses of wood,\r\nand specially set aside for lepers (ligneas domos ad opus\r\nleprosorum.)[110] Somner states that this latter institution still\r\nexists at Canterbury as a charitable establishment.[111] Other English\r\nlazar-houses were probably of as early a date, or at least earlier than\r\nthe first emigration for the crusades. Brigges alleges that the\r\nleper-house of St. Leonards in Northampton, was founded in William I.’s\r\nreign,[112] or before 1087; and one at Chatham was, according to Tanner,\r\nin existence before the termination of the short reign of his son,\r\nWilliam Rufus.[113]\r\n\r\nBut more than a century even previous to the date of which we speak,\r\nleprosy had been made a subject of legislation in Great Britain. In a\r\nparliament held by Pepin, King of France in 757 at Campiegne, it was\r\nenacted that leprosy in a husband or wife be regarded as a cause of\r\nseparation, and that the sound party might again remarry.[114] Lobineau,\r\nin his history of Brittany,[115] tells us as one of the effects of this\r\nlaw of divorce, that among the higher ranks of the city of Dol, there\r\nwere a number (_quantité_) of husbands who had as many as three wives\r\nliving at the same time. Now among the earliest extant code of laws\r\nenacted in any part of Britain, those, namely, of the celebrated Welsh\r\nKing, Hoel Dha, who died about the year 950,[116] there is a canon to\r\nthe same effect as that referred to, viz. that a married female was\r\nentitled to separation, and the restitution of her goods, provided her\r\nhusband was affected with leprosy.[117] There is, however, as we shall\r\nafterwards see, great reason to believe that the word leprosy was then\r\nused as a generic term, including under it many different varieties of\r\ncutaneous affections.\r\n\r\nI can offer nothing precise in regard to the exact period of the first\r\nintroduction of Leprosy into Scotland. If, as I have already shown to be\r\nhighly probable, the term Liberton is merely a conversion from leper\r\ntown, it would render it likely that the disease was an early visitant\r\nof this country; for we know that Liberton is mentioned in various old\r\ncharters of the reign of David I., who died in 1153.[118] In the\r\nFoundation Charter of Holyrood (1128) the mill and chapel “de\r\nLibertune”[119] are mentioned, and in the chartulary of Kelso, “William,\r\nparsona de Liberton,” signs as witness to some charters dated during the\r\nlatter half of the twelfth century.[120] At a later date there figures\r\nrepeatedly, in the ancient and well-known verses of Blind Harry, as an\r\noccasional companion of Wallace—\r\n\r\n  “Thomas Gray, parsone off Libertone,”\r\n\r\na member of the church militant, who in more than one instance seems to\r\nhave thrown aside his bell and book for the purpose of sharing in the\r\nbrave struggles and hardy adventures of the Scottish patriot.\r\n\r\nBut I can adduce much more solid proof than this unstable philological\r\nbasis affords, for stating that, as far back at least as the latter half\r\nof the twelfth century, the disease was not only known in Scotland, but\r\nthat hospitals were by that time actually erected for the seclusion of\r\nthe victims of it. The hospital of Auldnestun, in Lauderdale, had, as I\r\nhave already stated, three carrucates of land granted to it, as appears\r\nfrom the Melrose Chartulary, by Walter, the son of Alan. The date of\r\nthis grant, as of most others in the old chartularies, is not preserved,\r\nbut it is a fixed and well-ascertained fact in Scottish history that the\r\ndonor of it, the first of the illustrious, and afterwards royal line of\r\nStewarts, died himself as a Cluniac monk in Melrose Abbey in the year\r\n1177.[121]\r\n\r\nWilliam the Lion, who died in 1214, confirmed, as we have seen, a grant\r\nto the leper-house of Aldcambus; and the hospital of Rothfan, near\r\nElgin, was evidently established during, if not prior to, the reign of\r\nhis son and successor, Alexander II. In the chapter of gifts to this\r\nRothfan hospital, by John Byseth, Alexander is spoken of as the reigning\r\nprince, the preamble to the grant declaring that the endowment was\r\nbestowed “for the love of charity, for the soul of King William, and for\r\nthe salvation of my noble lord King Alexander” (pro salute domini mei\r\nAlexandri nobilis Regis).[122] Alexander II. died in 1249, so that by\r\nthis time the disease was certainly spread to the more northern parts of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll Scottish records of these earlier times are almost, as I have\r\nalready observed, so entirely lost, that it now seems impossible to\r\nascertain whether any leper-houses existed in this kingdom at a date\r\nantecedent to those to which I have thus alluded. That this was the\r\ncase, however, is not improbable.\r\n\r\nBefore the first notice of the earliest Scotch leper-house that I have\r\nbeen able to trace—viz. that of Auldnestun, about 1170, similar\r\nestablishments were abundant in England. The charters of many of them\r\nappear to have been either granted or confirmed in the reign of Henry\r\nI., who died in 1154, and was a contemporary of the Scotch Kings, Edgar,\r\nAlexander I., and David I.; and it is not unworthy of remark that two,\r\nif not more, lazar-houses were founded in England by natives of Scotland\r\nprior to the date of the earliest Scotch leper-house that I have been\r\nable to discover. For Malcolm IV. founded and endowed one in his\r\nprincipality of Huntingdon in 1165;[123] and sixty years earlier, or in\r\n1101,[124] Matilda, the “gode Queene Maud” of Henry I., and daughter of\r\nMalcolm III. of Scotland, established the hospital of St. Giles,\r\nBishopsgate, for forty lepers, a chaplain, clerk, and messengers.\r\n\r\nBut at whatever respective periods the disease first appeared in England\r\nand Scotland, there are strong reasons for believing that it continued\r\nto prevail in the latter kingdom long after it had ceased, or almost\r\nentirely ceased, in the former. In the preface to the statutes of the\r\nleper-house of St. Albans, drawn up about 1350, and already referred to\r\nas published in the supplement to Matthew Paris’ history,[125] it is\r\nstated that the number of lepers that presented themselves for admission\r\nhad diminished so much by that time, that their expense of maintenance\r\nwas below the revenue of the institution; “in general,” it is added,\r\n“there are now not above three, sometimes only two, and occasionally\r\nonly one.” In exactly the same year (1350) that this report was drawn up\r\nfor St. Albans, was it thought necessary to institute the leper-house at\r\nGlasgow; and nearly one hundred years later, or in 1427, the Scottish\r\nParliament deemed it proper to legislate on the subject of lepers.\r\n\r\nThe hospital of St. Mary Magdalene, at Ripon, was established in 1139\r\nfor the relief of all the lepers in that district. In the time of Henry\r\nVIII, it contained only two priests and five poor people to pray for all\r\n“Christen sowlez.”[126]\r\n\r\nAt Illeford, in Essex, an hospital was instituted in the reign of Henry\r\nII. or Richard I. for thirteen lepers. In one of the reports of the\r\ncommissioners for suppressing colleges, hospitals, etc., in the time of\r\nEdward VI., it is observed, in regard to the state of this Illeford\r\nHospital, that though founded “to find 13 pore men beying Lepers, 2\r\npryests, and one clerke—thereof there is at this day but one pryest and\r\n2 pore men.”[127]\r\n\r\nBy the same commission most other lazar-houses were reported as having\r\nno leprous patients, and yet only a few years previously was the\r\nleper-house of Aberdeen built, and forty or fifty years afterwards (in\r\n1591) the Edinburgh hospital at Greenside was established. We have\r\nseveral later notices of the disease among us. In the Aberdeen\r\nKirk-Session Register, vol. i., it is stated that, on the 13th May 1604,\r\nthe kirk-session ordained “Helene Smythe, ane puir woman infectit with\r\nleprosie, to be put in the hospitall appoyntit for keeping and haulding\r\nof lipper-folkis betwixt the townis; and the keyis of the said hospitall\r\nto be deliverit to her.”[128]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1693 we have some records of the lepers of Kingcase. On the\r\n11th March of that year a complaint was lodged by the procurator-fiscal\r\n“anent the intruding of the lepers of Kingcase upon the priviledges only\r\npropper to the burgess and freemen (of Prestwick) by there resorting to\r\nthe shoar, and taking up certain timber and other wrack, and casting\r\ngreater quantities of peats and turf off the common and moss, &c.,\r\nwhich, being seriously pondered by the magistrates, &c., they ordained\r\nthat none of the said lepers of Kingcase do so under the penalty of ane\r\nhundredth pund, _toties quoties_, to be paid by ilk ane (each one) of\r\nthem in caise of failyie (failure).”[129]\r\n\r\nThe disease appears to have continued in the northern islands of\r\nScotland long after it had disappeared from the mainland, and, indeed,\r\nall other parts of Great Britain. In Shetland it has been known for\r\ncenturies. I have already made a quotation from Brand to show that it\r\nwas at Lerwick as late as the latter part of the seventeenth century. In\r\nsome districts of Shetland it continued still later. Apparently most of\r\nthose there affected either belonged to or were sent to the Island of\r\nPapa. I have in my possession a MS. extract from the Session-books of\r\nWalls, showing the expenses incurred in keeping the lepers at Papa from\r\n1736 to 1740. Four of them appear to have died during these years, and\r\ntwo of the entries are for the “tobacco”[130] used at their funerals.\r\nIn 1742 there is a long entry in the Session Records of Walls, earnestly\r\nenjoining a day of public thanksgiving for the supposed total\r\ndeliverance of the country from the effects of the leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe disease, however, was not eradicated entirely. Mr. Jack, the\r\nresident clergyman, who wrote the account of the parish of Northmaven\r\nfor the Statistical Account of Scotland, published in 1798, seems to\r\nhave seen what he terms several miserable cases of the disease, and\r\nadds, that in many instances there is reason to suspect a hereditary\r\ntaint.[131] Dr. Thomson urged his pupil, Dr. Edmondston of Lerwick, to\r\ntrace out the history of the disease in the north, and that gentleman\r\nhas made the following observations upon it in his work on the Zetland\r\nIsles:—\r\n\r\n“Elephantiasis, known by the name of leprosy, was very frequent in\r\nZetland about sixty years ago, but its occurrence since that time has\r\nonly been occasional, and at present scarcely an instance of it is to be\r\nmet with. A native of Zetland, a few years ago, was received into the\r\nhospital of Edinburgh, labouring under true elephantiasis. I have seen\r\nobscure degrees of it in Zetland, where the face was bloated, the skin\r\nscaly and rough, and the voice slightly hoarse; but they did not\r\nterminate fatally, nor was the affection apparently communicated to\r\nothers. The last instance I saw of it was in the person of a boy. His\r\nfriends could assign no cause for its appearance, and said that it had\r\ncome on spontaneously, and proceeded gradually. The disease had been\r\nstationary for some time before it fell under my observation.”[132]\r\n\r\nAs so far confirmatory of the disease having thus longer remained in\r\nShetland than in the more southern parts of these kingdoms, I may here\r\nmention that in the middle ages it was very common,[133] and has since\r\nlong continued to linger in the neighbouring Faroe Islands, and in\r\nIceland. It appears, from Debes’[134] evidence, that true tubercular\r\nleprosy, as we shall see in the sequel, continued to prevail in the\r\nFaroe Islands (the nearest land north of Shetland) in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. Still later—viz. in 1768, Petersen[135] found 280\r\nlepers in the hospitals in Iceland. Olafsen,[136] Troil,[137]\r\nHolland,[138] and Henderson,[139] have each, from personal observation,\r\ndescribed the disease as existing in that island; and the French\r\nGovernment expedition in 1836, under Gaimard,[140] have, in the\r\nbeautiful work they are at present publishing, already given several\r\nexcellent coloured sketches of natives affected with tubercular leprosy.\r\nThe disease, according to various authors, still prevails in the\r\nnorthern kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. I am not by any means\r\nsufficiently intimate with the literature of the Scandinavian radesyge,\r\nto venture to offer any decided opinion with regard to its nosological\r\nnature, and its alleged relation to the leprosy of the middle ages. As\r\nfar, however, as I am acquainted with the subject, it appears to me that\r\nunder the name of radesyge, two, if not more distinct species of disease\r\nwere, by Holst and the other authors who first wrote upon it, confounded\r\nand described together. One of these, the radesyge properly so called,\r\nis probably nearly allied to, if not identical with the sibbens of\r\nScotland. Another of the supposed varieties of the disease, the\r\nspedalskhed or spetälska, seems on the other hand to be a different\r\nnosological species, hereditary, non-contagious, chronic, incurable, and\r\nidentical in many, if not in all its characters, with true tubercular\r\nleprosy. The spetälska seems confined to particular and more limited\r\nlocalities in the north than the radesyge; and when we look to the\r\ndescriptions of it as seen at Ostrobothnia by Udmann,[141] or as given\r\nby Hünefeld,[142] in regard to the disease at Bergen, we certainly find\r\nthese descriptions very exactly answering to the definitions of\r\ntubercular or Arabian leprosy given by our best nosologists and\r\npathologists, and which I shall have occasion afterwards to discuss at\r\nsome length. Besides, radesyge is a disease which is believed by many to\r\nhave made its first appearance in Sweden and Norway during the last\r\ncentury, while the spetälska was known at a greatly earlier date. The\r\npresent hospital for it at Bergen was, as Hünefeld[143] informs us,\r\nfounded as early as the year 1268.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part I will take an opportunity of considering at length\r\nthe nosological nature of the leprosy of the middle ages, particularly\r\nas it was seen prevailing in Great Britain. I will inquire into the\r\nrank, age, etc., of those attacked, and point out some of the causes\r\nwhich have been considered as connected with the dissemination of the\r\ndisease; and lastly, I will endeavour to bring together some of the\r\nstrange regulations of medical police that were adopted in England and\r\nScotland with regard to the infected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE NOSOLOGICAL NATURE OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding Part we have shown the extent to which leprosy\r\nprevailed during the middle ages in Great Britain; the number of\r\nhospitals that were instituted for the reception and seclusion of the\r\ninfected; the government and regulations of these hospitals; and the\r\ndates of the commencement and disappearance of the disease in the\r\nkingdoms of England and Scotland. Before proceeding farther, we\r\npropose,—in this Second Part,—to pause and discuss the strictly\r\nmedical question of the specific nosological nature of the malady, whose\r\nhistory we have thus far considered.\r\n\r\nI have already taken occasion to speak of the leprosy of the middle\r\nages, as identical with the species of cutaneous disorder, which has\r\nbeen variously denominated the tubercular leprosy, (_Lepra\r\ntuberculosa_); the leprosy of the Arabians (_Lepra Arabum_); and the\r\nelephantiasis of the Greeks (_Elephantiasis Græcorum_). The particular\r\nform of chronic cutaneous disease, to which these different appellations\r\nhave been severally applied, is an affection very distinctly marked in\r\nits more leading symptoms and course. Before, however, attempting to\r\nprove that the European and British leprosy of former times was\r\nspecifically identical with the malady in question, it will expedite our\r\ninvestigation of the question if, in the first instance, we obtain a\r\nprecise and perfect picture of the tubercular or Arabian leprosy itself.\r\nBy adopting this plan, we shall have placed before us a standard, as it\r\nwere, by which we can judge of and test those more or less imperfect\r\ndescriptions of the leprosy of the middle ages, which we may in the\r\nsequel have occasion to quote and animadvert upon. And in order to\r\nobtain such a standard of comparison as we have now in view, and that\r\nwithout any possibility of prejudging the subject, I shall cite the\r\ndescription of this species of disease from Dr. Bateman of London, and\r\nDr. Schedel of Paris;—from the first, because the characters which he\r\nhas given of this and other cutaneous affections are generally and\r\njustly looked upon by British pathologists as the most clear and\r\ndistinct that can anywhere be referred to;—and from the last, because\r\nhis account of tubercular leprosy is, I believe, the latest that has\r\nissued from the medical press, and the author has already, by a former\r\nwork,[144] distinguished himself by the excellence of his descriptions,\r\nand the precision of his diagnosis of cutaneous diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN DESCRIPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS OF TUBERCULAR LEPROSY.\r\n\r\n“The elephantiasis,” says Dr. Bateman[145] “(as described by the\r\nGreeks), is principally characterised by the appearance of shining\r\ntubercles, of different sizes, of a dusky red or livid colour, on the\r\nface, ears, and extremities; together with a thickened and rugose state\r\nof the skin, a diminution or total loss of its sensibility, and a\r\nfalling off of all the hair, except that of the scalp.\r\n\r\n“The disease is described as very slow in its progress, sometimes\r\ncontinuing for several years, without materially deranging the functions\r\nof the patient. During this continuance, however, great deformity is\r\ngradually produced. The alæ of the nose become swelled and scabrous, and\r\nthe nostrils dilate; the lips are tumid; the external ears, particularly\r\nthe lobes, are enlarged and thickened, and beset with tubercles; the\r\nskin of the forehead and cheeks grows thick and tumid, and forms large\r\nand prominent rugæ, especially over the eyes; the hair of the eyebrows,\r\nthe beard, the pubes, axillæ, etc., falls off; the voice becomes hoarse\r\nand obscure; and the sensibility of the parts affected is obtuse, or\r\ntotally abolished, so that pinching or puncturing them gives no\r\nuneasiness. This disfiguration of the countenance suggested the idea of\r\nthe features of a satyr or a wild beast; whence the disease was by some\r\ncalled _Satyriasis_, and by others _Leontiasis_.\r\n\r\n“As the malady proceeds, the tubercles begin to crack, and at length to\r\nulcerate: Ulcerations also appear in the throat, and in the nose, which\r\nsometimes destroy the palate, and the cartilaginous septum; the nose\r\nfalls, and the breath is intolerably offensive. The thickened and\r\ntuberculated skin of the extremities becomes divided by fissures, and\r\nulcerates, or is corroded under dry sordid scabs, so that the fingers\r\nand toes gangrene, and separate, joint after joint.”\r\n\r\nThe description of the course and symptoms of the disease, as given by\r\nSchedel, is more minute and detailed.\r\n\r\n“_Lepra tuberculosa_, or Greek elephantiasis, is” (he observes),[146]\r\n“characterised by the eruption of fawn-coloured or yellowish-brown\r\ntubercles, various in size, irregular in shape, somewhat shining, and\r\nsoft and smooth to the touch. These tubercles are preceded by\r\nerythematous patches, in which the sensibility of the skin is\r\ndiminished: slightly elevated at their outset, they become afterwards\r\nmore projecting, whilst the sensibility of the parts is usually quite\r\nlost, although they are sometimes painful when touched. They more\r\nfrequently occur upon the face, the nose, the ears, the lips, etc.; and\r\nbeing accompanied with a thickened and rugose state of the skin, they\r\ncause a most hideous distortion of the features, and frightful\r\ndeformity.\r\n\r\n“The evolution of the leprous tubercles is usually preceded by that of\r\nslight erythematous patches of a tawny red hue in whites, and blacker\r\nthan the surrounding integuments in negroes. These patches are worthy of\r\nattention, since they announce the dreadful disease which is about to\r\nappear. When they are of some duration, the skin in these points already\r\nbegins to lose its sensibility. Sooner or later, in some cases quickly\r\nin others very slowly, small soft, livid red tumours appear, varying in\r\nsize from that of a pea to that of a walnut, or even larger. When these\r\ntubercles come out, the erythematous patches, on which the sensibility\r\nof the integument had become lessened, sometimes become painful; so much\r\nso, that we have heard patients declare that the pain produced by the\r\nhandling of the small tumours at this period was similar to that felt\r\nwhen the cubital nerve receives a blow at the elbow. When they appear\r\non the face, they are generally accompanied by a puffy swelling of the\r\nsurrounding parts.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes only small surfaces are attacked. We have seen the nose and\r\nears alone affected, and much swollen and enlarged. When the disease\r\noccurs on the lower extremities only, it is found on the inferior part\r\nof the thigh, and around the ankles.\r\n\r\n“After remaining stationary for a longer or shorter time, the disorder\r\nincreases: instead of a few tubercles to be met with here and there, the\r\nwhole face is covered with large dusky red lumps, separated by deep\r\nfurrows; the features are horribly distorted; the alæ of the nose are\r\nthickened and swollen; the nostrils dilated; the eyebrows tuberculated\r\nand overhanging; the lips enormously thickened; the skin of the forehead\r\nand cheeks is thick, uneven, and tumid; the chin much increased in size,\r\nand the whole of the affected surfaces appear as if smeared with oil,\r\nand of a dusky livid red; the external ears, especially the lobes, are\r\nmuch enlarged and thickened, and beset with tubercles; the eyebrows and\r\neyelashes and beard fall off; the sense of smell becomes impaired or\r\ntotally lost; that of touch is often strangely affected; the voice grows\r\nhusky, and is frequently lost; the eyesight is greatly weakened; the\r\nunfortunate patient is dejected; and the muscular powers depressed in a\r\nsingular manner. With regard to the _libido inexplicabilis_, so much\r\nspoken of, our observations do not coincide with those of Dr. Adams, who\r\nmentions actual wasting of the generative organs. In the cases which\r\nhave come under our notice we have witnessed quite the reverse, and yet\r\nseveral were young men in whom the disease was not too far advanced.\r\n\r\n“At a still later period the symptoms are even more dreadful; the\r\ntubercles become the seat of ulceration, and sores of an unhealthy\r\ncharacter succeed, and discharge an ichorous fluid, which, on\r\nconcreting, form dark adherent scabs of various extent and thickness;\r\nthese incrustations are sometimes followed by cicatrices, but this is\r\nunfortunately a rare occurrence. On the extremities the thick and\r\ntuberculated skin becomes divided by fissures, and ulcerates or is\r\ncorroded under the dry scabs, so that the fingers and toes mortify and\r\nseparate, joint after joint, the miserable patient surviving these\r\nhorrid mutilations. Those individuals whom we have seen perish from this\r\ndisease were carried off by enteritis; large ulcerations were found in\r\nthe ilium, cæcum, and colon, excepting in one case, in which death was\r\ncaused by tubercular phthisis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn studying the phenomena of this, as of any other disease, it will\r\nsimplify our recollection of its more leading and more constant\r\ncharacters, if we have the principal symptoms of it embodied in a\r\nconcise nosological definition, instead of being spread through a long\r\nand detailed description. Two of our last and best British nosologists\r\ngive the following definition of tubercular leprosy or Greek\r\nelephantiasis (for I use these terms here and elsewhere as words\r\nperfectly synonymous).\r\n\r\n“Elephantiasis” (says Dr. Cullen), “is a contagious disease, with (1)\r\nthe face deformed with tubercles; (2) the skin thick, wrinkled, rough,\r\nunctuous, and divested of hair; (3) loss of feeling in the extreme\r\njoints; and (4) the voice is hoarse and nasal.”[147]\r\n\r\nIn defining the genus elephantiasis, Dr. Good selects the second and\r\nthird characters of Cullen as the most distinctive, and adds to these\r\ntwo others—viz. “(1) eyes fierce and staring; (2) perspiration highly\r\noffensive.” In defining the first species of this genus (or the Greek\r\nelephantiasis of other authors), he introduces as its three\r\npathognomonic symptoms, the first and fourth characters of Cullen and a\r\npart of the second.[148]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nLeprosy, such as it is portrayed in the descriptions and definitions\r\nwhich we have quoted from Bateman, Schedel, Cullen, and Good (and I\r\nmight have cited any of our modern medical writers to the same effect),\r\nhas had at different times, and by different authors, a great variety of\r\nappellations applied to it. In order to understand the nosological\r\nnature of the disease, as it formerly prevailed in Europe, it is\r\nrequisite to state a few uninteresting but indispensable facts, in\r\nregard to the changes which have occurred in its nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIn the medical writings of Aretæus, Aetius, and the later school of\r\nGreek physicians, the disease is described under the title of\r\nelephantiasis, for (says Aretæus) “it is disgusting to the sight, and\r\nterrible in all respects (_est visu fœdus et in omnibus terribilis_),\r\nlike the beast of the same name.”[149] The Arabian medical authors\r\napplied the corresponding term of “_Das Fil_,” “elephant disease,” or\r\nelephantiasis, to an affection entirely different, and one apparently\r\nunknown to the Greek physicians, namely, the tumid, Barbadoes, or Cochin\r\nleg of modern pathologists. At the same time the Arabian authorities\r\ndescribed the disease, known to the Greeks under the name of\r\nelephantiasis, by the Arabic terms “_Judam_,” or “_Juzam_” and\r\n“_Aljuzam_.”[150] The confusion thus apt to arise from describing two\r\ndifferent diseases under a corresponding name was greatly increased by\r\nthe errors committed by the Latin translators of Avicenna, Rhazes, and\r\nother Arabic authors. These translators rendered the _Das fil_ or\r\nElephant disease of the Arabic original, by the words elephanta and\r\nelephantiasis; and having thus, first, by an improper adaptation,\r\nappropriated the use of the latter Greek term to a disease very\r\ndifferent in its specific characters from the elephantiasis of the\r\nGreeks themselves, they subsequently added to the intricacies of the\r\nsubject by translating the Arabic “Juzam” (the disease that was in\r\nreality identical with the elephantiasis of the Greeks) by the term\r\nlepra—a term which the Greek physicians had generally applied to\r\ndifferent forms of scaly eruption, but never to any form of tubercular\r\ndisease.[151]\r\n\r\nBy these unfortunate mistakes medical men were betrayed into great\r\nconfusion in the use of these several terms. An identity in names did\r\nnot signify an identity in objects. The tumid leg, _das fil_, or\r\nelephantiasis of the Arabians, is a disease perfectly different from the\r\ntuberculous face affection or elephantiasis of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nAgain, the term lepra, as used by the Greek physicians themselves,\r\nsignifies morbid changes in the skin, marked by the presence of scales,\r\nand which changes in the skin have no relation whatever to either the\r\nArabian or Greek elephantiasis; but the same term lepra, as used by the\r\nArabic translators, was applied to designate the latter of these two\r\naffections, viz. the Arabic “Juzam,” or elephantiasis of the Greeks.\r\nHence, the _elephantiasis of the Greeks_ and the _lepra of the\r\nArabians_, or more properly of the Arabian translators, are expressions\r\naltogether synonymous, as being employed to designate the same\r\nindividual disease; and it is of the first importance to hold this fact\r\nin view in studying the histories of the European leprosy, which have\r\nbeen left us by our own and by other medical authors of the middle\r\nages.[152] For we must further recollect that the knowledge of the Greek\r\ntongue was almost entirely lost during the dark ages, and that nearly\r\nall learning being then confined to the Moors and Arabs, the scholastic\r\nlanguage was principally the Arabic. Thus it happened, that when the\r\nlove of literature and the pursuit of science began to revive about the\r\ntwelfth century, the medical as well as the philosophical writings of\r\nthe ancient Greeks were read and studied by the inhabitants of Western\r\nEurope through the medium of Arabic translations of them, or in Latin\r\nversions made from these translations.[153] The designations of\r\nindividual diseases were known to the learned student, and to the\r\nmedical practitioner and author of the times in question, by the names\r\nonly under which they were described in these versions. The\r\n_elephantiasis_ of the Greeks, or corresponding _juzam_ of the Arabians,\r\nwas rendered by the term _lepra_ in almost every Latin translation from\r\nthe Arabian or Saracenic school; and hence it is that we find this term\r\nlepra used by the medical and other authors of the succeeding period, as\r\nthe common appellative for the individual disease to which the two\r\nformer designations were originally applied. In many medical works of\r\nthe middle ages the single name “_lepra_”[154] is employed; in the\r\nwritings of others, and more particularly of later authors, it has the\r\ndistinctive designation (_Lepra Arabum_) added to it,[155] in order to\r\ndiscriminate it from the _Lepra Græcorum_ or scaly eruptions, to which\r\nthat term was primarily applied by the Greeks. In still more modern\r\ntimes, and with the same view, the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, Juzam, or\r\nLepra of the Arabians, or rather of the Arabian translators, has been\r\nvery frequently termed (as I believe was first proposed by Vidal)[156]\r\ntuberculous leprosy (_Lepra tuberculosa_), in order to distinguish it\r\nfrom the other very different disease, the scaly leprosy of the Greeks\r\n(_Lepra vulgaris_, _Lepra squamosa_, etc.) But, whatever may be the\r\ndifference in the nomenclature of different authors, we are to hold this\r\nin recollection, that the various terms of the elephantiasis of the\r\nGreeks (_Elephantiasis Græcorum_), the juzam or leprosy of the Arabian\r\ntranslators (_Lepra Arabum_), the tuberculous leprosy of modern European\r\nauthors (_Lepra tuberculosa_, _Lepra nodosa_), and the simple leprosy\r\n(_Lepra_) of most authors of the middle ages,[157]—all signify that\r\nsame specific and individual disease, whose distinctive characters we\r\nhave already traced from Bateman and Schedel, and from Cullen and Good.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER OF THE LEPROSY WHICH PREVAILED DURING THE MIDDLE\r\nAGES.\r\n\r\nHaving premised the preceding tedious but necessary digression upon the\r\nnomenclature of leprosy, we now proceed to consider the question whether\r\nthe particular form of disease that prevailed on the Continent and in\r\nGreat Britain during the middle ages, and for the victims of which so\r\nmany hospitals were built, and so many laws enacted, answered or not, in\r\nits nosological characters, to the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, _Lepra\r\nArabum_ or Arabian leprosy, such as we have found that malady depicted\r\nin the standards already referred to, and such as it is known to prevail\r\nat the present day in different localities in the new and old world,\r\nthat I shall afterwards take occasion to specify. We begin our inquiry\r\ninto the nature of the disease, by considering the characters of the\r\nleprosy as it was seen prevailing, almost epidemically, in the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Upon the Continent of Europe._—To obtain a solution of this part of\r\nour problem, let us turn to the works of the medical authors of these\r\nearly times, and endeavour to ascertain from them the nature of the\r\ndisease which they denominated leprosy.\r\n\r\nVarious minute descriptions of leprosy (lepra) have been left us in the\r\nwritings of different European physicians and surgeons of the middle\r\nages, who had an opportunity of studying the disease in different\r\nkingdoms upon the Continent during the period of its actual prevalence.\r\nAmongst others we may especially refer to the accounts of it, written\r\nduring the thirteenth century, by the monk Theodoric,[158] afterwards a\r\ndistinguished surgeon of Bologna; by the celebrated Lanfranc, who was\r\nfirst a practitioner in Milan,[159] and subsequently in Paris; and by\r\nProfessor Arnold Bachuone,[160] of Barcelona, reputed in his day the\r\ngreatest physician in Spain. Valescus de Taranta,[161] a physician of\r\nMontpellier; Bernhard Gordon,[162] Professor of Medicine in the same\r\ncity; the famous French Surgeon, Guy de Chauliac;[163]—Vitalis de\r\nFurno,[164] Cardinal of Albany; and Petrus de Argelata,[165] a\r\npractitioner of Bologna, have each left us descriptions of leprosy drawn\r\nup during the fourteenth century; and during the two succeeding\r\ncenturies, we have more or less accurate accounts of the disease given\r\nby Professors Montagnana[166] of Padua and Matthew Ferrari de Gradi[167]\r\nof Pavia, by Ambrose Paré,[168] Joannes Fernelius,[169] Palmarius,[170]\r\nHildanus[171] and various others.[172]\r\n\r\nEach of the several authors just now named has described, with greater\r\nor less precision, the symptoms of the prevailing leprosy, or chronic\r\nincurable cutaneous disease, for the reception and seclusion of the\r\nvictims of which the numerous lazar-houses in Europe were established.\r\nThe details which they all individually give of the leading characters\r\nof the malady[173] are in their essential points altogether similar; and\r\nthe symptoms which they describe it as presenting are exactly those\r\nwhich distinguish Greek elephantiasis. The disease is portrayed with\r\nbrevity and precision by some of them. Others enter into a detail of its\r\nphenomena, greatly more minute than the descriptions I have quoted from\r\nBateman and Schedel; and several give a history of the marks to be\r\nderived from the blood, urine, extremities, eyes, face, voice, etc., in\r\na manner so very elaborate and minute, as might surprise us at the\r\npresent day, did we not recollect the immense importance that depended\r\nin these times upon a just and faithful distinction of the disease,\r\nwhen, in a suspected case, a fellow-being might,—by the absence of the\r\nmore characteristic signs—be saved, or—by their presence—be\r\ncondemned, for the remainder of life, to all the horrors of a\r\nlazar-house. A few, as Guy de Chauliac, Argelata, etc., in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and in still later times, Gregory\r\nHorst, Forrestus, etc., add a most minute and detailed account of the\r\nvarious symptoms which the physician ought to look for in examining a\r\nsuspected person, and point out the exact mode in which he ought to\r\nproceed with this examination before venturing to consign a suspected\r\nperson to the seclusion of a leper hospital, and thus for ever doom him\r\nto be a despised “child of St. Lazarus.”\r\n\r\nIn an essay such as the present, it would be out of place to attempt to\r\nshow, by the exact words of each of the authors to whom I have just now\r\nalluded, the truth of the proposition that the lepra in their writings,\r\nand consequently the lepra of Europe in their times, was strictly\r\nidentical with the elephantiasis of the Greeks, and that the leper\r\nhospitals were specially intended for those affected with this disease.\r\nAs examples, however, of the whole, I may cite the observations of two\r\nof the authors whom I have named; and I shall select for this purpose\r\nGordon and Guy de Chauliac, principally from their two names standing\r\nhigher in medical history than most of the others that I have\r\nenumerated—from their living at a time when the disease was most\r\nprevalent,—and from their descriptions of the malady itself being on\r\nthe whole more than usually concise and methodic.\r\n\r\nBernhard Gordon was, at the commencement of the fourteenth century, one\r\nof the first, if not the first Professor of Medicine in the\r\nnewly-established school of Montpellier. “He has left us,” says Dr.\r\nFreind,[174] “a large volume called _Lilium Medicinae_ (for in that\r\naffected age everything writ in Physick, was either a Lily or a Rose), a\r\nbook mightily celebrated in those times.” This volume is generally\r\nstated to have been written about the year 1305[175] or 1309.[176] From\r\nthe very long chapter which is devoted in this work to the consideration\r\nof leprosy, I shall translate the account which the author gives of his\r\nthreefold stages or classes of symptoms of the disease—viz. the occult,\r\nthe infallible, and the last or terminating signs.\r\n\r\n1. “The occult premonitory signs (_signa occulta in principio_) of\r\nleprosy are (he states) a reddish colour of the face, verging to\r\nduskiness; the expiration begins to be changed; the voice grows raucous,\r\nthe hairs become thinned and weaker, and the perspiration and breath\r\nincline to fœtidity; the mind is melancholic with frightful dreams\r\nand nightmare; in some cases scabs, pustules, and eruptions, break out\r\nover the whole body; the disposition of the body begins to become\r\nloathsome, but still, while the form and figure (_forma et figura_) are\r\nnot corrupted, the patient is not to be adjudged for separation, but is\r\nto be most strictly watched (_nondum est judicandus ad separationem, sed\r\nest fortissime comminandus_.)\r\n\r\n2. “The infallible signs (_signa infallibilia_) are enlargement of the\r\neyebrows, with loss of their hair; rotundity of the eyes; swelling of\r\nthe nostrils externally, and contraction of them within; voice nasal;\r\ncolour of the face glossy (_lucidus_), verging to a darkish hue; aspect\r\nof the face terrible, with a fixed look, and with acumination and\r\ncontraction of the pulps of the ears. And there are many other signs, as\r\npustules and excrescences, atrophy of the muscles, and particularly of\r\nthose between the thumb and forefinger; insensibility of the\r\nextremities; fissures and infections of the skin; the blood, when drawn\r\nand washed, containing black, earthy, rough, sandy matters, and other\r\nmarks which authors prominently mention, but for me, those suffice which\r\nare to be found in the face. The above are those evident and manifest\r\nsigns, which, when they do appear, the patient ought to be separated\r\nfrom the people (_quibus apparentibus patiens est a populo\r\nsequestrandus_), or, in other words, secluded in a leper-house.\r\n\r\n3. “The signs of the last stage, and breaking-up (_naufragium_) of the\r\ndisease are, corrosion and falling-in of the cartilage forming the\r\nseptum of the nose; fissure and division (_scissura_) of the feet and\r\nhands; enlargement of the lips, and a disposition to glandular swelling;\r\ndyspnœa and difficulty of breathing; the voice hoarse and barking;\r\nthe aspect of the face frightful, and of a dark colour; and the pulse\r\nsmall and imperceptible.”[177]\r\n\r\nAfter giving the above accurate description of the leprosy, Gordon, in a\r\nsubsequent page,[178] earnestly states, “No one ought to be adjudged as\r\na leper unless there manifestly appear a corruption of the figure\r\n(_corruptio figurae_), or that state which is indicated by his _signa\r\ninfallibilia_. And I repeat to you this (he adds), as often as I have\r\noccasion to mention the _corruptio figurae_, because, as it appears to\r\nme, lepers are at the present day very injudiciously adjudged. Whoever,\r\ntherefore, has ears, let him attend to this, if he will.”\r\n\r\nThe other medical author whom I particularised for quotation, Guy de\r\nChauliac, practised first at Lyons, and afterwards at Avignon. He was\r\none of the most celebrated surgeons in the fourteenth century,[179] and\r\nwas successively medical attendant upon Popes Clement VI. and Urban\r\nV.[180] From the notice which he gives of the Black Death Pestilence of\r\n1363, it would seem that he was then stationed at Avignon, and engaged\r\nin the Composition of his “Inventarium sive Collectorium Partis\r\nChirurgicalis Medicinae.” In the long disquisition on lepra, contained\r\nin the 6th treatise of this work,[181] De Chauliac, after stating the\r\nusual subdivision of the disease into four varieties or species\r\n(Elephantia, Leonina, Tyria, Alopecia), goes on to describe the common\r\nsigns of all the varieties of leprosy, (signa communia _Omnium_\r\nspecierum Lepræ). The signs or symptoms indicating the actual presence\r\nof the disease are, he says, some unequivocal, others equivocal (_quædam\r\nunivoca, quædam equivoca_). Among the former set (_signa univoca_) he\r\nranges the six following symptoms:—“(1.) rotundity of the ears and\r\neyes; (2.) thickening and tuberosity of the eyebrows, with falling off\r\nof their hair; (3.) dilatation and disfiguration of the nostrils\r\nexternally, with stricture of them within, and fœtidity of the lips;\r\n(4.) voice raucous and nasal; (5.) fœtidity of the breath, and of the\r\nwhole person; (6.) fixed and horrible satyr-like aspect.”\r\n\r\nI question if any of our modern nosologists, or any recent writers on\r\ncutaneous diseases, have proposed a more correct definition, or accurate\r\nand concise diagnosis of the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_ than is presented\r\nin the above enumeration of its pathognomonic symptoms by the old French\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\nDe Chauliac adds a list of sixteen signs of leprosy, which, from their\r\nnot being constant, he terms equivocal (_equivoca_). Among these he\r\ngives tuberosity and hardness of the flesh, particularly of the joints\r\nand extremities; insensibility and feeling of torpor in the limbs;\r\nfalling off of the hairs; tubercles (_grana_) under the tongue and\r\npalpebræ, and behind the ears; an unctuous condition of the skin, as\r\nseen when water is thrown upon it; with symptoms from the blood, urine,\r\netc. “By these unequivocal and equivocal signs, lepers (says he) are\r\nexamined; but (he judiciously goes on to observe), in the examination\r\nand judgment of lepers there must be much circumspection, because the\r\ninjury is very great, whether we thus submit to confinement those that\r\nought not to be confined, or allow lepers (_leprosos_) to mix with the\r\npeople, seeing the disease is contagious and infectious. Therefore ought\r\nthe physician repeatedly to examine the affected, and consider and\r\nre-consider those signs which are unequivocal, and those that are\r\nequivocal, and let him not venture to judge by one sign, but by a\r\nconcourse of many, and particularly of those that are unequivocal.”\r\n\r\nDe Chauliac subsequently details at great length the precise mode in\r\nwhich the physician ought to conduct the examination of every suspected\r\ncase of leprosy referred to him. The patient is, first of all, as we\r\nshall afterwards see, recommended to be consoled upon his unfortunate\r\nlot, and sworn in to tell the truth in answer to all the interrogatories\r\nput to him. In immediately afterwards proceeding to the examination\r\nitself, De Chauliac orders inquiries to be instituted into the\r\npredisposition, hereditary or otherwise, of the suspected individual; if\r\nhe were exposed by intercourse with the infected; if his mind were clear\r\nand tranquil; if he feels punctures in the flesh, etc. He then\r\nrecommends the pulse to be examined, and some blood drawn, and treated\r\nin such a manner by inspection and straining, as to ascertain its\r\ncolour, its sediment, the quality of its coagulum, etc. After this he\r\nrecommends the countenance to be considered, and the patient dismissed\r\nfor the day, with an order to bring a specimen of his urine with him on\r\nthe following morning. “In the meantime,” he adds, “let the physician\r\ncogitate upon what he has seen, and what he may yet see in the case.\r\n\r\n“On the morrow, when the suspected person returns to the physician, let\r\nthe latter, in the first place, examine the urine, and consider if it\r\nshows any sign of disposition towards leprosy. All this being done, let\r\nhim next again consider the face, and ascertain in regard to the\r\neyebrows if they have lost their hair, and if they are swollen and\r\ntuberose; if the eyes themselves are round, particularly towards the\r\ninternal angles, and if the whites of them are of a darkish hue; in\r\nregard to the nose, if it be deformed, enlarged, and internally\r\nulcerated; in regard to the eyes, if they are rounded and shortened; in\r\nregard to the voice, if it is raucous and nasal; in regard to the lips\r\nand tongue, if they are ulcerated and tuberculated; if the breathing be\r\ndifficult and fœtid; and if the features be changed and frightful.\r\nAnd let the examiner consider these things deeply, because the signs\r\nfrom the face are more certain than the others. Afterwards make the\r\nperson strip himself naked (_ipsum expoliare_), and examine concerning\r\nthe colour of the whole body, if it is darkish and morphous; concerning\r\nthe substance of the flesh, if it is hard and irregular, and tuberose,\r\nparticularly about the joints and extremities; if it is scabrous,\r\npruriginous, or serpiginous and ulcerous; if its corion is rough, like\r\nthe skin of the goose; and if the muscles are consumed; if there is a\r\nfeeling of sleeping in the limbs; if he feels perfectly when pricked\r\nalong the back of the leg, and is certain in respect to the spot and\r\nkind of instrument. Then pour water upon his body, and see if it is\r\nunctuous, and if salt adheres to it when it is thrown upon its surface.\r\nLastly, let the physician return again to the consideration of the face\r\nand countenance, and with that dismiss the person.\r\n\r\n“Let all the ascertained signs (cautiously, adds our author) be pondered\r\nover, and let the physician deliberate naturally concerning these signs,\r\nboth individually and in concourse. If he should find that the suspected\r\nperson has, along with a disposition to leprosy, some of the slighter\r\nequivocal signs of the disease, the individual is to be watched at his\r\nown house, and secretly, that he may be placed upon a good regimen, and\r\nhave the advice of medical men, otherwise he will truly become leprous.\r\nIf, however, he presents many equivocal with a few of the unequivocal\r\nsigns, he is vulgarly termed _cassatus_ (marked, denounced); and such\r\nindividuals must be narrowly watched, in order that they take a proper\r\nregimen, and have the good advice of physicians; and in order that they\r\nconfine themselves within their own houses and mansions. Let them not\r\nfreely mix with the people, because they are sinking into leprosy. If,\r\nagain, they are found with many, both of the unequivocal and equivocal\r\nsigns, they must be separated with kind and consoling words from the\r\npeople, and committed to the leper hospitals (_in Malanteria ducendi_).\r\nBut if they are sound they must be set free (_absolvendi_), and sent\r\nwith a medical certificate to the Rector.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would, I believe, be considered altogether a work of supererogation\r\nto append to the preceding details by Gordon and Guy de Chauliac any\r\nformal remarks in the way of comparing the _Lepra_ of the fourteenth\r\ncentury with the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_ of Bateman, Schedel, or any of\r\nour modern standards, and thus insisting further upon the perfect and\r\nentire identity of the individual disease passing under these two\r\ndifferent designations. The accounts given of the malady by the two\r\nancient and the two modern writers just named, undoubtedly agree as\r\nexactly as we ever find the accounts of one and the same disease by four\r\ndifferent authors do; and, as I have already said, the same remark might\r\nbe extended to the relative early descriptions of the lepra, as left by\r\nnumerous other authors in these times, and the recent descriptions of\r\nthe _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, as drawn up from personal observation in\r\ndifferent parts of the world by Kinnis, Ainslie, Heineken, Casan,\r\nCazenave, and the other modern writers that I shall afterwards have\r\noccasion to refer to when speaking of the present geographical\r\n_habitats_ of the disease.\r\n\r\nBut indeed the intrinsic evidence which is afforded by the extracts that\r\nI have given from Gordon and De Chauliac, and by the other similar\r\ndescriptions to which I have referred in the works of the medical\r\nauthors of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, renders it\r\nunnecessary to add here any further comment to prove the double\r\nproposition, _first_, that the leprosy of the middle ages, as the\r\ndisease prevailed upon the continent of Europe, was identical with the\r\n_Elephantiasis Græcorum_; and, _secondly_, that it was for the victims\r\nof this specific malady that the numerous leper hospitals were\r\nestablished, they alone being the individuals who were intended to be\r\n(in the language of Gordon and De Chauliac) adjudged, separated from\r\nthe people, and consigned to the lazar-houses (“_judicati_”—“_a populo\r\nsequestrandi_”—“_in Malanteria ducendi_”).\r\n\r\nSo far with regard to leprosy, as seen and described by the early\r\ncontinental authors. Let us now return to the nature of the disease as\r\nit prevailed in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Nature of the Leprosy in England._—Reasoning analogically, it may\r\ncertainly, with the greatest probability, be presumed that the incurable\r\ndisease which is known in the lazar-house charters and older histories\r\nof this country, under the same name as on the continent,—which\r\nprevailed here during the same periods as on the continent,—and for\r\nwhich the same systems of medical seclusion and police were\r\nadopted,—was entirely the same disease as that described by and known\r\nto the continental medical authors of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nTo some minds, such considerations may in themselves be sufficient to\r\nfix the identity of the disease, as it prevailed on the continent, and\r\nas it prevailed in our own country; and certainly they tend very\r\nstrongly to show that if, as I have attempted to prove, the epidemic\r\nleprosy of continental Europe was the tubercular or Arabian leprosy, the\r\nleprosy of England and Scotland was of the same specific nature. But I\r\nbelieve I can adduce still more direct and satisfactory evidence to\r\nestablish this important point.\r\n\r\nThe first valuable medical work by an English author that has been\r\ntransmitted to us is the _Compendium Medicinae_ of Gilbert.[182]\r\nThis author is generally supposed to have lived about 1270, in the reign\r\nof Henry III. or Edward I.[183] Bale places him even much earlier.[184]\r\n\r\nGilbert has a chapter headed “De Lepra.” In this chapter he describes\r\nvery minutely the four usual modifications of lepra (the Elephantia,\r\nLeonina, Tyria, and Alopecia), varieties which, he himself observes, are\r\nrarely found pure and simple, but generally mixed together\r\n(_compositas_).[185] To quote in proof of this his long and very\r\ndetailed account of the disease would occupy much space and only lead to\r\nrepetition. That the description, however, which Gilbert has drawn of\r\nthe leprosy of the middle ages is one of the most just and accurate\r\npenned during these times, has been often and freely admitted by\r\nSauvages, Sprengel, and other competent judges. Further, that the lepra\r\nas described by Gilbert, and as understood by him and his contemporaries\r\nin England, meant the elephantiasis of the Greeks, is evident (without\r\ngoing into particulars) from the simple fact, that the sagacious\r\nSauvages refers to and quotes this chapter of Gilbert’s on lepra as one\r\nof the best descriptions extant of Greek elephantiasis.[186]\r\n\r\nIn an official report given in to the Royal Society of Medicine of Paris\r\nin 1782, upon the Greek elephantiasis, the reporters, MM. Chamseru and\r\nCoquereau, specially allude to Gilbert’s description as the most clear\r\nexposition of it to which they could refer.[187] Again, in an analysis\r\nof the works of this early English author, the learned Professor\r\nSprengel observes, “Gilbert sometimes relates, though very rarely,\r\nobservations which are proper to himself, and which deserve to be\r\nquoted. In this number I include particularly those concerning leprosy.\r\nWe may almost look upon them as the first exact description which has\r\nbeen given of that malady by the Christian physicians of the west. The\r\nspots which foretell it, and the signs of its first invasion, are at\r\nleast described by him in a manner agreeable to nature,” etc.[188]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the direct and positive evidence of an English\r\nphysician of the thirteenth century, that the term lepra was then used\r\nin this country specially to designate the varieties of Greek\r\nelephantiasis; and I might adduce (if it were at all necessary), to\r\ndemonstrate exactly the same circumstance, the chapter which John of\r\nGaddesden, Professor of Medicine in Merton College, Oxford,[189] and\r\nCourt physician to Edward II., has devoted to lepra or elephantiasis in\r\nhis famous _Rosa Anglica_, a work written towards the commencement of\r\nthe succeeding or fourteenth century.[190] In this “Opus luculentum et\r\neruditum” (as at least Leland terms it),[191] the author describes at\r\nconsiderable length the nature, causes, and premonitory signs, etc., of\r\nlepra and its varieties, and enters minutely into the pathognomonic\r\nsigns (signa demonstrativa infallibilia) of the disease, as respectively\r\ntaken from the face, from the extremities, from the blood, and from the\r\nhumours of the body. A quotation from his signs of leprosy, as taken\r\nfrom the face, will at once show that by that term (lepra) he meant the\r\nGreek elephantiasis. I shall give the passage in his own words. “A\r\n_Facie_, rotundatio oculorum, contractio palpebrarum, lacrimositas multa\r\net aquositas oculorum, depiliatio superciliorum et grossities eorum;\r\ndilatatio narium exterius et constrictio interius, et coartatio\r\nanhelitus, quasi si cum naribus loqueretur. Et color faciei lividus\r\nvergens ad fuscedinem mortificatam. Terribilis aspectus faciei cum fixo\r\nintuitu. Contractio et palpebrarum et aurium. Infectio cutis maculosa.\r\nTuberositas et pustulae in facie et nodositas. Ista omnia et major pars\r\nsunt infallibilia signa lepræ actualis.”[192] In a subsequent part of\r\nhis chapter on Lepra, John of Gaddesden strongly states, that “no one is\r\nto be adjudged a leper, and separated from intercourse of mankind (_ab\r\nhominum conversatione separandus_), until the figure and form of the\r\nface is actually changed. Hence cancer (gangrene?) in the feet, or foul\r\nscabbing, must not be considered as arguing the presence of leprosy, nor\r\nnodosities, unless they appear on the face and with the aforesaid\r\nconditions.”[193]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Bartholomey Glanville, an English author of the latter\r\npart of the fourteenth century,[194] may be adduced in support of the\r\nsame view. In his work “De Proprietatibus Rerum” he describes persons\r\naffected with leprosy (lepra) as having “redde Whelkes and Pymples in\r\nthe Face, out of whome oftenne runne Blood and Matter: in such the Noses\r\nswellen, and ben (become) grete, the vertue of Smellynge faylyth, and\r\nthe Brethe stynkyth ryght fowle.” When, he further observes, the disease\r\nis so advanced that the infected are “unclene, spotyd, glemy, and\r\nquyttery (ichorous), the Nosethrilles ben stopyl, the Wasen of the Voys\r\nis rough, and the Voys is horse, and the Heere [hair] falls.”[195]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preceding direct medical evidence, it may not be\r\nconsidered irrelevant to the present question to remark that, in most of\r\nthe lazar-house charters and notices in England and Scotland that I have\r\nhad access to, the inmates of these institutions are described by the\r\nadjective _leprosus_, or by some application of the corresponding noun\r\n_lepra_, as “lepra percussi,” “infecti lepra.” I have, however, met with\r\none very striking exception to this general rule, and I allude to it\r\nhere as confirmatory of what I have stated with regard to the nature of\r\nthe disease for which these leper hospitals were instituted in our own\r\ncountry. The leper hospital of Sherburne was, as I have already had\r\noccasion to mention, endowed for sixty patients, and was hence one of\r\nthe largest in England. It was founded in 1181 by Hugh Pudsey, “the\r\njollie Bishope of Durham.” In a MS. History of the Durham Cathedral and\r\nDiocese, in the Bodleian Library,[196] the inmates of the Sherburne\r\nHospital, instead of being termed _Leprosi_, are directly designated\r\n_Elephantuosi_. In speaking of the acts of Bishop Pudsey, the MS.\r\nstates, amongst other things, that he constructed the hospital of\r\nSherburne, and planted in it lepers collected from all parts of the\r\nbishoprick. (_Elefantuosos_, in Episcopatu suo circumquaque collectos,\r\nibidem instituit.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE LEPROSY OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto said nothing to show that the disease in Scotland was of\r\nthe nature of Greek elephantiasis. During the earlier ages at which it\r\nprevailed in this country, medicine was little cultivated, and we have\r\nno professional work of any kind left us by the Scottish physicians of\r\nthat period, from which to derive any evidence on this subject.[197]\r\n\r\nAmidst this dearth, however, of medical writings during the middle ages\r\nin Scotland, it gives me pleasure to refer to a passage in one of our\r\nearliest Scotch poets, affording proof that the leprosy of this country\r\nwas, as on the continent, truly the Greek elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to the lovers of early Scotch literature that Henryson,\r\na schoolmaster of Dunfermline, who wrote before the year 1500, composed,\r\namong other things, _The Testament of Cresseid_ as a sequel to the\r\n_Troilus and Cresseid_ of his immediate predecessor Chaucer.[198]\r\nIndulging, like his English prototype, in the wildest forms of\r\nanachronism, the Scottish poet confessedly subjects, in almost every\r\nparticular, the ancient and foreign characters of the piece to the\r\nmanners, incidents, and institutions of his own times, and of his own\r\ncountry. In this spirit he afflicts, at last, the fickle and unfortunate\r\nCresseid with leprosy, as perhaps the most appalling of dooms to which\r\nhe could consign her. The poet afterwards sends her “unto yone hospitall\r\nat the tounis’ end.” The particular symptoms which he makes Saturn\r\ninvoke upon Cresseid, to transform her into a leper, are exactly the\r\nmost marked symptoms of Greek elephantiasis:\r\n\r\n  Thy cristall ene (eyes) minglit with blude I mak,[199]\r\n  Thy voice sa cleir unpleasand, hoir, and hace,\r\n  Thy lustie lyre (fair skin) ouirspread with spottis blak,\r\n  And lumpis haw (livid[200]) appeirand in thy face;\r\n  Quhair thow cummis, ilk (each) man sall fle the place;\r\n  Thus sall thow go begging fra hous to hous,\r\n  With cop and clapper like ane Lazarous.\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable passage, those more striking symptoms, the\r\nswellings, lumps, or livid tubercles on the face, the morbid alteration\r\nof the voice and skin, and that turgid and injected appearance of the\r\neye, which Dr. Good has given as one of his characteristic symptoms of\r\nthe _genus_ elephantiasis, are all tersely, yet accurately described.\r\nIndeed, if Sauvages, Swediaur, Cullen, or any of our great nosologists\r\nof the last or present century, had been poets, I greatly doubt\r\nwhether, with all their medical knowledge to boot, they could, in four\r\nfettered lines of rhyme, have described the Greek elephantiasis more\r\nfaithfully and briefly than we have it described in the four first lines\r\nthat I have just quoted from the Dunfermline schoolmaster of the\r\nfifteenth century. Henryson’s account of a leper may not be so\r\npoetically beautiful, but it is pathologically much more true than that\r\nwhich the American poet, Willis, has recently given of the disease in\r\nhis well-known poem of _Helon_. We shall afterwards find that “the cop\r\nand clapper,” alluded to in Henryson’s two last lines, were badges\r\ncommonly carried by the inmates of the leper hospitals of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn passages subsequent to that which I have quoted, Henryson reiterates\r\nsome of the more prominent symptoms. Thus, the hapless Cresseid\r\nafterwards describes what is elsewhere termed “her uglye lipper face,\r\nthe whilk before was quhite (white) as lilie flour,” as “deformed in the\r\nfigour;” and again also she describes and laments the characteristic\r\nmorbid change in the voice:\r\n\r\n “My cleir voice and my courtlie carrolling\r\n  Is rawk (rank) as roke, full hideous, hoir, and hace.”\r\n\r\nBut I have still further and stronger proof to adduce that the leprosy\r\nof the Scotch was the tubercular lepra or Greek elephantiasis. It has\r\nbeen already stated that the disease continued to prevail in the\r\nShetlands, apparently long after it had left all the more southern parts\r\nof the British Islands. We have found Brand stating in 1700,[201] the\r\ndisease to be “discovered (I quote his own words) by hairs falling from\r\nthe eyebrows, the nose falling in,” etc. I have shown also that in some\r\ndistricts of Shetland the disease continued to a later date, and that,\r\ndown to 1742, the infected were kept in the island of Papa, or, as it is\r\nsometimes written, Papastour. Through Mr. Charles Duncan, who has kindly\r\nexerted himself in Shetland to procure me information on the present\r\nsubject, I have been favoured with the sight of an old but important\r\ndocument relative to the lepers of Papa, and the symptoms under which\r\nthey laboured. The document in question was, as Mr. Duncan informs me,\r\ndrawn up for Sir John Pringle, by the Rev. Andrew Fisken, minister of\r\nDelting, Walls, and Sandness. The old copy I refer to belongs to the\r\nRev. James Barclay (son of the late Dr. Barclay of Lerwick), and I\r\npublish its contents with his permission. The minute description which\r\nit gives of the symptoms in the lepers of Shetland can leave no doubt as\r\nto the disease under which they suffered being the true tubercular\r\nleprosy, or _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, and the value of the evidence\r\nwhich it affords on this point is only increased by the fact, that the\r\nwriter did not himself belong to the medical profession. The importance\r\nof the document must plead as an excuse for its length. The copy which\r\nis quoted below, is marked on the back, in an old handwriting, “Case of\r\nthe Lepers in Papa, as drawn up by Mr. Andrew Fisken, about the year\r\n1736 or 1737.” It proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n“There are in the Island of Papastour in Zetland five women who labour\r\nunder a disease that, generally in this place, gets the name of\r\nLeprosie, though others alledge it deserves rather to be called a\r\nscurvy. The disease has the following appearances, viz.—\r\n\r\n“The persons affected at first find an unusual itching in their skin,\r\nwith small, knotty, hard lumps to be felt under the cuticle; their whole\r\nbody appears plumper than ordinary, and their eyes are observed to be\r\nclearer coloured, with a look more piercing than formerly. Their face\r\nand legs are full of small lumps or hard tumours, which in a little\r\nsuppurate and throw out a black, thin, ichorous matter, and gradually\r\nencrease, especially in the face, till they turn confluent. It is also\r\nobserved that where these lumps do not appear, the skin feels hard and\r\ncallous, like a piece of unwrought leather, and the cuticle smoother\r\nthan ordinary, and unctuous or greasy, which appears from pouring water\r\ninto the palms of their hands, where it will separate into small\r\nglobules, such as appear when water is poured out of a greasy vessel.\r\nThe extraordinary plumpness, or rather swelling of the body, observed in\r\nthe beginning of this disease, does, in a few months, disappear, and\r\nthey turn very lean and weak, only their face always, and sometimes also\r\ntheir legs, continue swelled. A great many little lumps like small hard\r\nseeds are then to be felt everywhere under their skin, which gradually\r\nincrease till they break out externally, throwing out a fœtid thin\r\nichor, which ceases to run in a little time, and a hard scab covers the\r\npart, which sometimes dries, and falling off, leaves the skin entire; at\r\nother times breaks out again, and runs as before. The hair falls off\r\nfrom their eyebrows, and they have their throats much inflamed,\r\nespecially the uvula, which is gradually (and after some years\r\ncontinuing under the disease) entirely destroyed. Their voice is so\r\nweakened that they cannot speak louder than one whispering. They have\r\nfrequent flushes of heat in their skin, which is succeeded by an\r\nuniversal chilliness, and they are not at that instant able to suffer\r\nthe cold air without a very acute soreness in their skin. As the disease\r\nencreases, it appears still the more frightful and loathsome; their face\r\nfull of large and deep ulcers, resembles somewhat a lump of rotten cork;\r\ntheir gums and teeth are quite rotten, and in the night-time they are\r\nmuch troubled with deep-seated pains in their bodies, and have in the\r\nday-time frequent stitches and pains in all parts of their body, with a\r\ngeneral weight and inactivity of their limbs. The women also cease to\r\nhave their menstrua upon their being seized with this distemper. Their\r\nappetite and digestion is as good as ordinary; their stools regular;\r\nnothing extraordinary to be observed in their urine. They sleep pretty\r\nwell, but seldom or never sweat any.\r\n\r\n“This disease is found by experiment to be very infectious, and seems\r\nalso to run in blood, most people that have taken it without infection\r\nfrom another having been related to three families in the isle. It\r\naffects any age or sex, and it is observed that young persons bear it\r\nlonger than those of a more advanced age, some having lived ten years\r\nunder it, others only two, some four, some six, etc., but none ever\r\nrecover after the symptoms above-written do appear. The persons that\r\nfall into this direful case are, as soon as it is observed, obliged to\r\nretire to a solitary little hut, built on purpose for them, at a\r\ndistance from all houses, and are not allowed any converse with their\r\nhusbands, wives, or nearest relations, but have their necessaries of\r\nlife furnished them by a contribution from all the inhabitants of the\r\nisle, and brought to their hut, which they take in when the person who\r\nbrought it has retired to the windward of their house at some distance.\r\n\r\n“There has never been any cure of this disease attempted here, save that\r\na few years ago a young woman in a neighbouring parish had some bolusses\r\nof mercury given her in order to a salivation; but some dangerous\r\nsymptoms appearing, the administrator thought fit to proceed no further,\r\nand the patient continues still alive in the same case she was before\r\ntaking the mercury.”\r\n\r\nIn the voluminous MS. Medical Notes, bequeathed by Sir John Pringle to\r\nthe College of Physicians of Edinburgh,[202] I find a copy of the above\r\naccount of the Papa lepers. Sir Andrew Mitchell of Westshore seems to\r\nhave transmitted the account to him without giving any notice of the\r\nwriter of it. It is entered in Sir John’s notes under the date of 1759;\r\nbut it was without doubt drawn up many years previously. I have already\r\nalluded to an entry in the Session Records of Walls, regarding the\r\ndisappearance of leprosy from that parish and district in 1742. The\r\nentry seems to have been made at a sitting of the session “at\r\nNorth-house in Papastour;” and its expressions[203] show that at the\r\ndate of it (17th March 1742) there were no lepers in Papa. From the MS.\r\nextracts furnished to me by Mr. Rannie, session-clerk, it appears that\r\nthere is only mention of one other instance afterwards in the\r\nSession-books of the parish, viz. in December 1772 and 1776. The female\r\nwho was the subject of it, and whose case is represented in the records\r\nas “singularly clamant,” was ordered to be provided, at the expense of\r\nthe session, “with back and bed clothes, a house fit for her to lodge\r\nin, and maintenance to be brought to her daily at the house.” Mr. Rannie\r\nfurther states, “I have been informed by old persons that she lived but\r\na short time after she was put into the house built for her in the\r\ncommon, at a distance from other houses.” He adds, “It has been reported\r\nto me that in Papa, about the year 1778, a leprous woman was put out and\r\ndied in the fields before a house could be built; and that about the\r\nsame time there were leprous persons in the district of Watness, and\r\nthat the son and daughter of a man Henry Sinclair were infected and sent\r\nto the hospital at Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\nAt a still later date a case of Shetland leprosy was detected in the\r\nEdinburgh Infirmary. In 1798, a male patient from Shetland was for some\r\ntime in the hospital wards, under the care of various physicians. As the\r\nform of disease under which he laboured was considered as very\r\nanomalous, Dr. Thomson was requested by Dr. Hamilton to visit the\r\npatient, and detected the case to be one of Greek elephantiasis. I am\r\nkindly permitted to extract the following notes of the case from Dr.\r\nThomson’s manuscripts:—\r\n\r\n“His face was studded all over with small subcutaneous tubercles. The\r\nskin over these tubercles was of a reddish colour, intermixed with\r\nblotches, like those which occur in the _pityriasis versicolor_. The\r\nhair of the eyebrows and eyelids had fallen off, and the skin of the\r\nface, as well as of most of the rest of the body, seemed as if smeared\r\nwith oil. His voice was weak and hoarse, so that he seemed to speak as\r\nin a whisper. On inspecting the fauces, they appeared in some places raw\r\nand excoriated, and in others rough and puckered. A slight ulceration\r\nwas perceptible on the _septum narium_, and the nose seemed a little\r\ndepressed. In various parts of the body, particularly on the arms,\r\nthighs, and legs, besides the small subcutaneous tubercles, other larger\r\nones were to be perceived by feeling for them. These larger bumps or\r\ntubercles, which were not perceptible to the eye, and which did not\r\noccasion any discoloration of the skin, were without pain, and had a\r\nstriking resemblance to the tubercles occurring in the flesh of those\r\naffected with scurvy.”\r\n\r\nThe patient, John Berns, was 28 years of age. On making inquiry, it was\r\nfound (as I am informed by Dr. Thomson) that some of his ancestors had\r\nbeen affected with the same disease.\r\n\r\nAn accurate drawing of the morbid appearances presented by Berns’ face\r\nwas made at the time by Mr. Syme, now Professor of Drawing in the Dollar\r\nAcademy. A copy of this drawing, with a history of the patient’s\r\nailments, was forwarded to the late Dr. Willan; and I have Dr. Thomson’s\r\nauthority for stating that Dr. Willan at once declared it also as his\r\nopinion, that Berns’ case was a genuine instance of the tuberculous\r\nleprosy or _Elephantiasis Græcorum_; a disease of which, as he informed\r\nDr. Thomson, he had only seen one example in a patient shown him by Dr.\r\nBaillie.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment recapitulate the preceding evidence, with regard to\r\nthe nosological nature of the English and Scottish leprosy:—_First_,\r\nvarious authors who personally witnessed the leprosy of the middle ages\r\nupon the Continent of Europe, in describing it, have described a disease\r\nhaving all the most characteristic symptoms of Greek elephantiasis.\r\n_Secondly_, in England a cutaneous disease prevailed at the same period,\r\nbearing the same name,—presenting the same chronic incurable\r\ncharacter,—having its victims subjected to the same civil laws and\r\nrestrictions,—marked (as we know from Gilbert, Gaddesden, and\r\nGlanville’s observations and writings) by the same train of nosological\r\nsymptoms—and hence identical in nature with the continental disease and\r\nwith the elephantiasis of the Greeks. _Thirdly_, in Scotland we find a\r\nmalady having the same similarity in its general date,—in its name,—in\r\nits course,—and in the civil regulations enforced regarding it, with\r\nits symptoms, as they are accidentally described by Henryson in the\r\nsixteenth century, identical with those of Greek elephantiasis.\r\n_Fourthly_, in a part of the country where the disease has continued to\r\nprevail down to a later period, the infected, as described by\r\neye-witnesses in the earlier part of the last century, presented the\r\nmost unequivocal signs of the affection alluded to. And, _lastly_, we\r\nhave as high medical evidence as could be adduced in regard to cutaneous\r\naffections (the evidence, namely, of Drs. Willan and Thomson), for\r\nasserting that the malady was seen in the members of a Shetland family\r\nin which it had been hereditarily transmitted,—and hence, in one of the\r\nlast, if not the very last Scotch leper, was decidedly marked by the\r\ntrue and genuine characteristics of the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPROSY IN THE NORTHERN COUNTRIES LYING NEAREST TO SHETLAND.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion I alluded to the existence of true tubercular\r\nleprosy in the neighbouring Faroe Isles, in Iceland, and the nearest\r\ncoast of Norway, as corroborative of the disease which has long existed\r\nin the Shetlands being of the same nosological nature. I might now, if\r\nadditional proof were necessary, reverse the order of the evidence which\r\nI have just brought forward, and proceed to show at length that the\r\ndisease which long existed, and still does remain, in Bergen and\r\nIceland, and for which leper hospitals also are still maintained in\r\nthese localities, is, in reality, the tubercular leprosy or Greek\r\nelephantiasis; and, from this point, argue back, that the disease which\r\nformerly prevailed in Shetland,—and, if in Shetland, in Scotland\r\ngenerally,—was of the same nosological nature. On this head, however, I\r\nshall content myself with offering a very few observations in proof of\r\nthe specific character of the malady in the districts lying most\r\ncontiguous to Shetland, and leave without further comment the inference\r\ndeducible from such evidence.\r\n\r\n_In the Faroe Isles._—These islands form the nearest land north of the\r\nShetlands. The great cutaneous disease which formerly infected the\r\ninhabitants of Faroe had all the characters of tubercular leprosy. In\r\nproof of this, I may appeal to the description of the malady, given in\r\nthe seventeenth century by Debes, who was Provost of the churches in\r\nthese islands, and wrote an account, which was much esteemed at the\r\ntime, of the country and its inhabitants. He observes, “As for the\r\nLeprosye itself, I would not omit, for the reader’s sake, to mention\r\nsomething of its nature. Physicians write that there are three sorts of\r\nLeprosies; namely, Tyria, from the serpent Tyrus. In this leprosy, the\r\npatient’s skin is soft, and sometimes falleth off in shells, and they\r\nhave many spots and white wartes thereon. The second is called Alopecia,\r\nby reason the hairs fall off as those of a fox; he that is infected with\r\nthis leprosy hath a red face, and his beard and eyebrows fall off. The\r\nthird sort is called Elephantiasis, from the elephant, to whom they\r\nbecome like in their skin; the body and face of him that is infected\r\nwith this disease is full of knobs. The Leprosie wherewith they are\r\ntroubled in this country is usually Elephantiasis, for the face and\r\nlimbs of almost all the infected are full of blue knobs, that break out\r\nsometimes as boyls, whereby they look very deformed in the face, being\r\nbesides all hoarse, and speaking through their noses.”[204]\r\n\r\n_Iceland._—That the leprosy of Iceland (the next land north of the\r\nFaroe Isles) is of the nature of the _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, is a\r\npoint which might be proved by any of the descriptions of it by\r\nPetersen, Troil, Henderson, and Holland. Dr. Holland’s account is more\r\nconcise than the others. He states—\r\n\r\n\r\n“The leprosy of the Icelanders (_Likthra_, _Holdsveike_, or\r\n_Spitelska_), exhibits in many instances all the essential characters of\r\nthe genuine elephantiasis or _Lepra Arabum_; and is a disease of the\r\nmost formidable and distressing kind. Indolent tumours of the face and\r\nlimbs are, generally, among the first symptoms of the complaint,\r\nattended by swellings of the salivary, inguinal, and axillary glands.\r\nThe nostrils, ears, and lips are progressively affected with swelling\r\ndeformity. The skin over the whole, or different parts of the body,\r\nbecomes thick and hard; sometimes exhibiting a shining or unctuous\r\nsurface, sometimes one rough and scabrous, which at a more advanced\r\nperiod of the disease displays numerous cracks or fissures. The senses\r\nare usually much enfeebled; and anæsthesia of the extremities generally\r\noccurs. The voice assumes a peculiar hoarseness and nasal tone,\r\nfrequently with swelling of the tonsils, but without any hindrance of\r\ndeglutition until the disease has made great progress in the habits of\r\nthe patient: the breath and perspired matter are extremely fetid; and\r\nthe hairs and nails frequently fall off. The tumours in different parts\r\nof the body gradually pass into malignant ulcers, which discharge an\r\nacrid unhealthy matter; in this state the patient often lingers during a\r\nlong time; or where the disease has a more speedy termination, all the\r\nsymptoms are rapidly aggravated, and he is carried off in a state of\r\nextreme debility and wretchedness.”[205]\r\n\r\nThe lepers in Iceland are received into four different hospitals, which\r\nhave been long established for that purpose.[206]\r\n\r\n_Norway._—Returning again to Shetland as a starting point, we find that\r\nthe part of the continent of Europe which lies nearest to Shetland, and\r\nthat in nearly a direct line westward, is the district of Bergen in\r\nNorway. The distance between Shetland and the seaport of Bergen does not\r\nexceed thirty geographical degrees. In the first part of the present\r\nessay I offered some reasons for believing that the spedalskhed\r\nprevalent in Bergen was a disease different, on the one hand, from the\r\nradesyge of other parts of Norway, and probably identical on the other\r\nhand with the Greek elephantiasis or tubercular leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of those authors who had observed the disease at Bergen\r\nseemed to justify this view. In 1751 Pontoppidan, the Bishop of Bergen,\r\ncites the account and words which we have above quoted from Debes in\r\nreference to the Faroe Isles, as exactly applying to the disease in the\r\ndistrict of Bergen. When it at last (he states) breaks out in ugly boils\r\non the face, they are generally sent to hospitals erected for that\r\npurpose, of which there is one at Bergen and another at Molde in\r\nRomsdalen.[207] The excellent account of the disease in the Bergen\r\nhospital, which was drawn up a few years ago by the preacher Wellhaven,\r\nshows the malady to correspond in every important particular with the\r\nGreek elephantiasis;[208] and the long and more strictly medical\r\ndescription of the Bergen disease given in 1786 by Buchner,[209]\r\nappeared to be altogether confirmatory of the same opinion. I have\r\nlately become acquainted with a proof to the same effect, of such a\r\nstrong character as to render it supererogatory to adduce the detailed\r\ndescriptions of Buchner or Wellhaven in evidence. The Norwegian\r\nGovernment has recently (and with an anxiety towards the promotion of\r\nmedical science that reflects little honour on the other richer courts\r\nof Europe) commissioned some of its more distinguished physicians to\r\ninstitute a complete inquiry into the nature of the endemic cutaneous\r\ndiseases both of Norway and of other localities. Since the former part\r\nof the present paper was printed, Dr. Fäye of Christiania has, as one of\r\nthese commissioners, visited this country with the purpose of examining\r\ninto the nature of the Scottish sibbens, etc.; and I have learned from\r\nhim with pleasure that the physician sent to Bergen to examine the\r\nspedalskhed, is prepared, after a careful study of the disease there, to\r\nreport it as tubercular leprosy, and hence a species of malady perfectly\r\ndistinct from the more general Scandinavian radesyge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe date of the first appearance of leprosy in the Faroe Isles and in\r\nIceland seems to remain undetermined.[210] In both localities it\r\nappears to have prevailed severely in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies.[211] In all probability, however, it was introduced long\r\nprevious to these dates. At all events, it appeared much earlier in\r\nBergen, for, as I have already stated in the first part, one of the\r\nleper hospitals in that city was founded as early as the year 1268.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, as far as I know, of the period of its first\r\nappearance in Shetland. It had reached, however, as far as the north of\r\nScotland early in the thirteenth century; for, as we have already shown,\r\nthe leper hospital of Elgin was in existence in the year 1226,[212] or\r\nmore than forty years, at least, previously to the institution of\r\nsimilar receptacles for the diseased in Bergen.\r\n\r\n\r\nERRORS IN ADJUDGING INDIVIDUALS TO THE LEPER HOSPITALS—CAUTIONS\r\nINCULCATED BY THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\nWhile arguing, as I have done in the preceding paragraphs, to show that\r\nthe epidemic leprosy for which so many lazar-houses were formerly\r\nfounded in Europe and in Great Britain was the Greek elephantiasis, I\r\nby no means wish to insist that patients affected with that disease\r\nalone were admitted into these receptacles. There is only too great\r\nprobability for the belief that persons who had the misfortune to be\r\naffected with any foul and inveterate cutaneous malady were isolated and\r\nshut up along with those actually labouring under true leprosy. After\r\nsyphilis appeared, towards the commencement of the sixteenth century,\r\nwith some analogous symptoms, and when the elephantiasis itself was\r\nalready disappearing from most localities, we know for certain that a\r\nlarge proportion of the inmates of the continental lazar-houses\r\nconsisted of cases of secondary venereal and other severe\r\nskin-affections. Dr. Bateman[213] adduces the strongest possible\r\nevidence in proof of this from the direct and personal observations made\r\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the leper hospital at Ulm\r\nby Horst, at Alcmaer by Forrestus, and by Reedlin at Vienna. Similar\r\nerrors were in all probability only too common even when the\r\nelephantiasis was more common and better known, and mistakes in the\r\nselection of the proper inmates of the hospitals would constantly occur\r\nin these times, from the kind of persons to whom the responsible and\r\nimportant task of selecting the infected was entrusted. The Act that we\r\nhave already quoted of the Perth Parliament “anent lipper-folk” defines\r\nthose who were charged in Scotland with the duty of searching out the\r\naffected. In the third clause it is statute “That the Bishoppes,\r\nOfficialles and Deanes, inquyre diligentlie in their visitation of ilk\r\n(each) Paroch Kirk, gif ony be smitted (affected) with Lipper, and gif\r\nony sik (such) be foundin, that they be delivered to the king gif they\r\nbe Seculares, and gif they be Clerkes, to their Bishoppes, and that the\r\nBurgesses gar (oblige them to) keepe this statute under the paine\r\nconteined in the statute of Beggers [namely, gif they have broken it\r\n(the statute of beggars) they sall be in fourtie shillings to the King];\r\nand quhat leprous that keepis not this statute, that he be banished for\r\never off that Burgh, quhair he disobeyis, and in likewise to\r\nLandwart.”[214]\r\n\r\nIn extenuation of the above edict, we must recollect that, at the period\r\nat which it was enacted (in 1427), the ecclesiastics to whom in this\r\ncountry it entrusted the selection of lepers were in reality the only\r\nexisting physicians of the general community, and some of them seem to\r\nhave devoted themselves as much to the practice of medicine as to the\r\nstudy of theology. But, even to a strictly non-medical observer, the\r\ndiagnosis would, in the latter stages, be less free from doubt than\r\nmight be at first supposed. For when once the tubercular leprosy became\r\nin any case completely developed in all its distinctive deformity, and\r\nwith its full concourse of marked and peculiar external characters, as\r\nfalling off of the hairs of the eyebrows, swelling and thickening of\r\nthese parts, tubercles of the face, hoarseness of the voice, etc., there\r\nwere few or no diseases for which it could be readily mistaken, provided\r\nany proper degree of care was observed. In the earlier stages and less\r\nmarked cases of the disease, errors in the adjudgment of cases, in all\r\nprobability, often occurred, and affections that had no relation to\r\nelephantiasis, except in their obstinacy and locality, were, we cannot\r\ndoubt, frequently mistaken for true instances of tubercular leprosy.\r\n\r\nSuch errors, it has been often averred, would be almost as apt to happen\r\nin the hands of the truly medical, as of the non-medical examiners, in\r\nconsequence of the knowledge and distinction of cutaneous diseases being\r\nexceedingly imperfect at these early periods of medical history. And it\r\nis certainly true that, in the writings of the older Arabian,\r\nContinental, and English physicians, we find almost all the different\r\nspecies of chronic cutaneous disease mixed up and described together\r\nunder a few general heads and designations, as Lentigo, Impetigo,\r\nMorphea, Albaras, Gutta Rosea, etc. Indeed, the proper discrimination and\r\ndiagnosis of different cutaneous affections was little known and studied\r\nuntil the end of the last century. At the same time, however, it must be\r\nrecollected that the tubercular lepra, or Greek elephantiasis, certainly\r\nforms a striking exception to this general observation. For, in the\r\nmedical writings of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and early part of the\r\nfifteenth century, the leprosy is almost uniformly described with a care\r\nand a minuteness that strangely contrasts with the superficial manner\r\nin which the whole remainder of chronic cutaneous diseases are either\r\npassed over or confounded together.\r\n\r\nI would willingly appeal, in support of this last allegation, to the\r\ndifferent chapters on lepra, as compared with those on the other\r\ncutaneous diseases, in the works of the Arabian physicians, and of those\r\nEuropean medical authors of the middle ages whose writings I have\r\nalready referred to. Indeed, the accounts and diagnosis of tubercular\r\nlepra, as given by Rhazes, Theodoric, Lanfranc, Arnold de Villeneuve,\r\nGilbert, etc., might well stand as models of medical description even at\r\nthe present day. And if, in France, the strong and earnest injunctions\r\nof Bernhard Gordon were in any degree respected, that no person be\r\nadjudged as requiring separation for leprosy until the second stage\r\n(according to his division of the disease) had supervened, and the\r\n_signa infallibilia_ of the malady had already shown themselves in the\r\nusual marks traceable in the _corruptio figurae et formae_ of the\r\nsuspected individual, cases of unjust condemnation to the lazar-houses\r\nwould be much less common than might be otherwise imagined. We have\r\nalready seen that in England, in the fourteenth century, John of\r\nGaddesden inculcated the same salutary rules and precautions, and\r\ninsisted that no one be separated from the general community as a leper,\r\nunless already “_figura et forma faciei corrumpantur_.”\r\n\r\nCertainly, on some occasions, the examination to which the patient was\r\nsubjected, in order to ascertain if he were truly a leper or not, seems\r\nto have been of the most searching and scrutinising nature. I have\r\nalready alluded to the strict rules of examination that have been\r\npreserved for us in the works of different authors, and quoted the\r\nmethod recommended by Guy de Chauliac to be followed by physicians\r\nbefore they remitted suspected patients with medical certificates to the\r\nmagistrates (_cum literis medicorum ad rectores_). In the _Examen\r\nLeprosorum_, published by Gesner, and which appears to have been drawn\r\nup as an official formula, if I may so term it, for examining into\r\nsuspected cases, the details are most elaborate and searching. There are\r\nbetween fifty and sixty signs of the disease which the examiner is\r\nrequested to look for. Twelve of these signs are taken from the general\r\nstate of the body; seven or eight of them from the hands and feet; six\r\nfrom the blood; five from the face; six from the mouth; eight from the\r\neyes and eyebrows, etc. etc. The document commences by stating, “that it\r\nis the duty of the physician to be versed in, and attentive to, the\r\nsigns of the disease, and to ponder often (_revolvere multoties_) upon\r\nthem. He should put his trust (it adds) not in one sign, but in many,\r\nand he should see what signs are proper (_propria_) to the leprosy, and\r\nwhat are equivocal.” Before making the examination, the document states\r\nthat (as is also recommended by Guy de Chauliac[215] and others), the\r\nphysician should, in the first instance, give some words of\r\nencouragement and consolation to the patient, and show that this disease\r\nis the salvation of his soul, and that Christ has not despised such,\r\nalthough the world may shun them (_quod haec aegritudo salus est animae,\r\net tales Christus non despexit, licet mundus eos fugiat_). Further,\r\nin order to have more certainty in the examination, it is added that the\r\npatient should be made, in the first place, to take oath to tell the\r\ntruth on those points on which he is interrogated. We have already found\r\nDe Chauliac recommending the examining physician to take the same\r\nprecaution, “faciat eos _jurare_ veritatem dicere de interrogendis” (p.\r\n310).\r\n\r\nA decree, issued in the year 1314, by Milo, Bishop of Orleans, shows\r\nthat it was occasionally necessary to guard the examinators against\r\nbeing imposed on in other more serious ways, than by direct\r\nprevarications or misstatements on the part of the suspected individuals\r\nwho are subjected to their scrutiny. “Whereas it happens that in the\r\nexamination of lepers mistakes as to identity, and deceptions, are\r\ncaused by the interposition of other persons, we enact and command that\r\nwhenever any person is suspected of the infection of leprosy, he be sent\r\nat his own charge if he have effects, but if not, that two responsible\r\nmen of the parish having been sworn (_jurati_) before the priest and the\r\nofficers of the church (_gajariis ecclesiae_), be sent at the expense of\r\nthe parish with the suspected person to obtain the examination; they\r\nshall conduct the said suspected person to the said examination, and\r\ncause him to be faithfully examined, and bring certificates to us, that\r\nit may not be possible that, for the future, collusion should take place\r\nin the aforesaid matters.”[216]\r\n\r\nI have not hitherto been able to find any evidence showing to whom the\r\nexamination and seclusion of lepers was, in olden times, entrusted in\r\nEngland; or to trace out in that kingdom any special laws relative to\r\nthis subject. There exist, however, upon record, in reference to one\r\nEnglish case in the fifteenth century, some details that are\r\nparticularly interesting in regard to the present point of our inquiry.\r\nThe details in question have been preserved in Rymer’s _Fœdera_. The\r\ncase to which they refer appears to have been brought under the\r\ncognisance of the Crown by the neighbours of the suspected female, in\r\nconsequence of her being alleged to be affected with leprosy, and yet\r\nrefusing to seclude herself, as was the usual custom, from intercourse\r\nwith society in consequence of it. The reigning monarch, Edward IV.,\r\nissued, in 1468, a Chancery warrant for the proper medical examination\r\nof this supposed case of the disease. The royal warrant, and the medical\r\ncertificate which it called forth, have both been preserved by Rymer. I\r\nappend a translation of these curious documents, as illustrative both of\r\nthe general dread then still entertained of the malady, and of the\r\nminute care which, in this country, was occasionally taken, in order\r\nthat a just and accurate judgment might be arrived at in cases of doubt\r\nand difficulty. The documents are entered by Rymer under the title of\r\n“Medicorum Regis, super morbo Lepræ, Certificatio.” They proceed as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“To the most Excellent and most Serene Prince and Lord in Christ,\r\nEdward, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of\r\nIreland, We, William Hatteclyff, Roger Marshall, and Dominus de Serego,\r\nDoctors of Arts and Medicine, your physicians, and sworn to watch over\r\nthe health of your Person, send due Reverence with humility and\r\nworship:—\r\n\r\n“Whereas a Petition was made to You in Your Court of Chancery, with\r\nregard to removing _Johanna Nightingale_, of Brentwoode, in the County\r\nof Essex, from general intercourse with mankind (_a communi hominum\r\nconsortio_), because it was presumed by some of her neighbours that she\r\nwas infected by the foul contact of Leprosy, and was, in fact, herself a\r\nLeper: Upon which Your writ was then prepared, and afterwards directed\r\nto the Sheriff of the said county, in these words:—\r\n\r\n“Edward, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of\r\nIreland, to the Sheriff of Essex, Greeting: Whereas We have heard that\r\n_Johanna Nightingale_ is a leper, and is commonly holding intercourse\r\nwith the people of the aforesaid county, and mixes with them both in\r\npublic and private places, and refuses to retire to a solitary place, as\r\nis customary and befitting her (_et se ad locum solitarium, prout moris\r\nest, et ad ipsam pertineret, transferre recusat_), to the grievous\r\ninjury and, on account of the contagion of the aforesaid disease, the\r\nmanifest perils of the aforesaid inhabitants: We, willing to guard\r\nagainst such dangers, as far as in us lies, and as is just and customary\r\nin such cases, Do charge You, that having taken with You certain\r\ndiscreet and loyal men of the county of the aforesaid _Johanna_, in\r\norder to obtain a better knowledge of this disease, You go to the\r\naforesaid _Johanna_, and cause her to be diligently viewed and examined\r\nin the presence of the aforesaid men. And if You find her to be leprous,\r\nas was reported of her, then that You cause her to be removed, in as\r\ndecent a manner as possible, from all intercourse with other persons,\r\nand have her betake herself immediately (_indilatè_) to a secluded\r\nplace, as is the custom, lest by common intercourse of this kind injury\r\nor danger should in any wise happen to the aforesaid inhabitants.\r\nWitness my hand, at Westminster, this day of July, in the eighth year\r\nof Our reign.”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore The Reverend Father in God, Robert, by the Grace of God, Lord\r\nBishop of Bath and Wells, Your Chancellor of England, consulted us on\r\nthis subject, and determined to bring the same Johanna to us, with the\r\nintention that, according to what we have learned from our knowledge of\r\nMedicine, we should give information to Your Highness in Your Chancery,\r\nwhether the said Johanna be in fact a Leper or not. We, therefore,\r\nwishing to obey Your Highness, in order that the truth on this subject\r\nmight be made most plain and clear, have proceeded after this manner.\r\nFirst, we examined her person, and as the older and most learned medical\r\nauthors have directed in these cases, we touched and handled her (_ipsam\r\ntradavimus et palpavimus_), and made mature, diligent, and proper\r\ninvestigation, whether the symptoms, indicative of this disease, were in\r\nher or not; and after an examination and consideration of each of the\r\npoints, which appeared necessary to be examined and considered, in order\r\nto arrive at a true knowledge of this doubtful matter, We found that the\r\nwoman neither had been nor was a Leper, nor ought, on that account, to\r\nbe separated from ordinary intercourse with mankind.\r\n\r\n“We are taught by Medical Science that the disease of Leprosy is known\r\nby many signs, also that each species of the disease, of which there are\r\nfour, viz. Alopecia, Tiria, Leonina, and Elephantia, should be known and\r\ncharacterised by particular signs, and each should be specifically\r\ndistinguished from the rest. Therefore, in the case of the woman brought\r\nbefore us, on going through upwards of twenty-five of the more marked\r\n(_famosiora_) signs of general leprosy (_Leprae in communi_), we do not\r\nfind that she can be proved to be leprous, by them or a sufficient\r\nnumber of them. And this would suffice, generally, to free her from the\r\nsuspicion of leprosy, since it is not possible for any to labour under\r\nthe disease, in whom the greater part of these signs are not found. But,\r\nin order to give our opinion on the individual species, going through\r\nupwards of forty distinctive signs of the different varieties of\r\nleprosy, we do not find that this woman is to be marked as suffering\r\nunder any of the four kinds, but is utterly free and untainted, as we\r\nhave signified by word of mouth to Your Highness in Your said Chancery,\r\nand we are prepared to declare the same more fully to Your Highness by\r\nscientific process (_per processum scientificum_), if, and wherever, it\r\nshall be necessary.\r\n\r\n“In testimony whereof, we, the said William Hatticlyff, Roger Marshall,\r\nand Dominus de Serego, have signed our name with our proper hands, and\r\nalternately affixed our seals.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the preceding document, which is one of the earliest, if not the very\r\nearliest, English medical certificate which either historical or medical\r\nrecords have preserved, it is added in the form of a note, “Et\r\nmemorandum quod praedicti Willielmus Hatteclyff, Rogerus Marchall, et\r\nDominus de Serego venerunt in Cancellarium apud Westmonasterium, septimo\r\ndie Novembris, anno praesenti (1468), et recognoverunt scriptum\r\npraedictum, et omnia contenta in eodem, forma praedicta.”[217]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE ETIOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude the present hurried sketch of the British leprosy of the\r\nmiddle ages, it now only remains for me to consider, in relation to the\r\netiology or causation of the disease, the rank, age, sex, etc., of those\r\nthat were attacked by it; the effects of its hereditary transmission;\r\nand the question of its propagation by contagion. In connection with\r\nthis last subject, I shall attempt to bring together under one view the\r\nstringent regulations and usages that were adopted by our ancestors,\r\nwith a view of preventing the diffusion of the disease by means of\r\ncommunication between the infected and the healthy; and at the same time\r\nconsider the light in which the despised lepers were regarded both by\r\nthe civil and ecclesiastical law.\r\n\r\n\r\nRANK OF THE PERSONS ATTACKED BY LEPROSY.\r\n\r\nIn this country the leprosy of the middle ages seems to have had its\r\nlargest share of victims in the lower classes of society—amongst the\r\n“villeyns” or bondsmen of these times, and the poorer peasantry and\r\nburgesses, who, when shut up in the hospitals, were obliged either to\r\ndepend upon the funds of these institutions, or to beg for their\r\nsupport. The exact trade and calling of the individuals admitted into\r\nthe Scottish and English hospitals can only be very imperfectly gathered\r\nfrom one or two casual notices.[218]\r\n\r\nAmong the patients of Kingcase leper hospital, in Ayrshire, I have only\r\nfound one whose rank I can trace. In the burgh of Prestwick[219] records\r\nfor 1478-9, Anne Kerd is formally accused before the magistrates of the\r\nburgh of visiting Kingcase, and further “hir seik soun, att is lepper,\r\nrepairis daili in her house [in Prestwick].” This Anne Kerd, having “a\r\nsick son that is leprous” seems from the old _Liber Communitatis_, etc.,\r\n_de Prestwick_ of 1470 to have had assigned her a very small fragment of\r\nthe burgh lands only, viz. “a porciunkle of commoun lande quilk acht\r\nafter hir lyve to John Haveris airis (which belonged after her life\r\n[death] to John Haveris’ heirs).”[220]\r\n\r\nAmongst the citizens of Glasgow who were at different times in the\r\nlatter part of the sixteenth century ordered by the magistrates to be\r\nvisited, under the suspicion of labouring under leprosy, most are\r\nrecorded by their mere Christian name and surname; but two or three are\r\nentered in the burgh records in such terms as to show their occupation\r\nand probable rank, as “Robert ——, fleschor,” in 1573; “Mr. James ——,\r\nfleschor,” “Patrick Bogle, maltman,” and “Andro Lawson, merchand,” in\r\n1581.[221] One of these individuals is reported by the Water Bailies as\r\nconfined in the Glasgow leper hospital at the Brigend[222] in 1589,\r\nalong with five other lepers. The whole list is interesting for our\r\npresent purpose, as showing the trade and calling of the infected\r\ninmates, viz. “Andro Lawson, _merchand_; Stevin Gilmor, _cordener_;\r\nRobert Bogill, sone to Patrick Bogle; Patrick Birstall, _tailzeour_;\r\nJohne Thomsoun, sone to Johne Thomsoune, _tailzeour_; Daniel\r\nCunninghame, _tinclar_.”\r\n\r\nI am not aware of the existence of any similar complete list of the\r\ninmates of other British leper hospitals, to which I could refer with\r\nthe view of ascertaining the occupation and rank of those that occupied\r\nthem. We have scattered records, however, to show that men of riches\r\noccasionally became the victims of the disease, and passed their\r\nsubsequent term of life in the leper hospitals. Thus, Jenkins, in\r\nspeaking of the St. Mary Magdalene lazar-house at Exeter, states,\r\n“Richard Orange, Esq., a gentleman of noble parentage, and mayor of this\r\ncity (Exeter) in 1454, being infected with the leprosy, notwithstanding\r\nhis great wealth, submitted himself to a residence in this hospital,\r\nwhere he lived many years, and finished his days, and was buried in the\r\nchancel of the chapel. His grave, with a mutilated inscription, is still\r\nextant.”[223]\r\n\r\nSome of the leper hospitals were specially endowed for persons above the\r\nlower ranks, who happened to become affected with the disease. In 1491,\r\nRobert Pigot gave by will to the leper hospital of Walsingham, in the\r\narchdeaconry of Norwich, a house in or near that town for the use of two\r\nleprous persons “of good families.”[224]\r\n\r\nThe malady was found among the clergy as well as among the laity, and\r\nsome of the English leper hospitals were specially founded for the\r\nreception of leprous monks alone—as the hospital of St. Lawrence, near\r\nCanterbury, and, according to Tanner,[225] that of St. Bartholomew, at\r\nChatham. From one of the edicts issued by Henry II. during the height\r\nof his quarrel with Archbishop Becket, it would appear that the\r\ndignitaries of the church occasionally did, or at least might, employ\r\nlepers in the high character of nuncios, for, in order to prevent Becket\r\nfrom putting the kingdom of England under an ecclesiastical interdict,\r\nHenry took all precautions that no official letters to that effect\r\nshould be conveyed into Britain; and to secure this object the more\r\nsurely, he enacted, that, if any individual did carry thither letters of\r\ninterdict from the Pope or Archbishop, he should be punished “by the\r\namputation of his feet if a regular; by the loss of his eyes and by\r\ncastration, if a secular clergyman; he should be hanged if he were a\r\nlayman; and burned if he were a leper” (_si Leprosus, comburatur_).[226]\r\n\r\nIn the extant account of the British leper hospitals, there are still\r\npreserved some instances in which these institutions were founded by the\r\nwealthy and noble after they had themselves become the victims of the\r\nmalady. The leper hospital of Mayden Bradley, in Wiltshire, was founded\r\nby a female member of the rich family of the Bysets[227]—Camden alleges\r\nby a daughter of Manasser Byset, sewer to King Henry II., after she had\r\nherself become a leper. “This hospital,” says Leland, “was builded by\r\none of the three heirs general of the Bisets, who, being a lazar, gave\r\nher part of the town of Kidderminster _in pios usus_.”[228]\r\n\r\nIf the earlier biographical notices that we possess regarding the\r\nnobility of Great Britain were as minute on their private as on their\r\nmartial and political lives, we might probably have to record many more\r\nnotices in regard to their bodily maladies of an import similar to the\r\nfollowing:—The youngest son of Robert Blanchmains, Earl of Leicester,\r\nwas himself a leper, and in the reign of Richard II. founded a leper\r\nhospital, dedicated to St. Leonard, on the north part of the town of\r\nLeicester.[229]\r\n\r\nThe royal families of England and Scotland did not always remain exempt\r\nfrom the suspicion, at least, and accusation of leprosy, if not from the\r\nactual attack of the disease.\r\n\r\nHenry III. courted Margaret, Princess of Scotland, and the sister of\r\nMalcolm IV. The royal lady preferred the brave Hubert de Burgh, the\r\nminister of the English king. Hubert’s enemies afterwards alleged to\r\nKing Henry, that he (Hubert) had dissuaded the Scottish princess from\r\naccepting the hand of the English monarch, by telling her “that Henry\r\nwas a squint-eyed fool, a lewd man, a _leper_, deceitful, perjured, more\r\nfaint-hearted than a woman, and utterly unfit for the company of any\r\nfair and noble lady.”—(Articles of Impeachment, as given by\r\nSpeed.)[230]\r\n\r\nIn reference to this unfounded accusation, I may state that Ryland\r\nmentions it as a local tradition that the leper-house of Waterford in\r\nIreland was founded by King John (the father of Henry III.) in\r\nconsequence of his son’s being affected at Lismore with an eruption that\r\nwas supposed to be leprosy.[231] But even supposing the tradition\r\ncorrect, it could scarcely have been Henry the eldest legitimate son of\r\nJohn, since, at the date of his father’s expedition into Ireland, 1209\r\nand 1210, Henry was a child of only five or six years of age, and in all\r\nprobability did not accompany his royal sire.\r\n\r\nDifferent historians have alleged that Henry IV. was affected with\r\nleprosy in the latter part of his life. The immediate cause of his death\r\nseems to have been epilepsy, terminating, after a time, in an apoplectic\r\nattack; and some authors aver strongly that this was his only disease.\r\nThus, in his Chronicles of England,[232] the celebrated old printer,\r\nGrafton, upholds that Henry was carried off by “a sore and sudaine\r\ndisease called an apoplexie.” Hall, an author somewhat anterior in date,\r\nstoutly maintains this same view, for the king’s disease, as he\r\nobserves, “was no lepry striken by the hand of God, as folish friers\r\nbefore declared, for then he neither would for shame nor for debility\r\nenterprize (as he did), so greate a journey as into Jewrie (Jerusalem),\r\nin his own persone, but he was taken with a sore apoplexye.”[233]\r\n\r\nHollinshed,[234] quoting implicitly this account from “Maister Hall,”\r\ngravely adds, and he “had none other greefe nor maladie.” The dogmatic\r\nauthority of Hall on this, as on other points, is not to be over much\r\nrelied upon.\r\n\r\nWe have little doubt that Dr. Lingard[235] had some sufficient evidence\r\nfrom the records of the times, for stating that Henry had at least “the\r\nmost loathsome eruptions on his face.” Rapin[236] and Turner,[237] in\r\ntheir histories of England, both refer to Mezeray as their authority for\r\naverring that these eruptions consisted of leprosy. I find that\r\nDuchesne[238] also describes Henry as weighed down with a severe and\r\ngrievous affection of leprosy; and Maydestone[239] alleges that it was\r\nthis last disease, and solemnly considers it as a punishment inflicted\r\non the king for his cruel treatment of Archbishop Scrope. Iohn Hardynge,\r\nwhose authority is the more valuable from his being himself a\r\ncontemporary of Henry IV., and a follower of his son, Henry V.,\r\ndescribes in his rhyming Chronicles of English History the face of the\r\nking as disfigured by leprosy. As a portion of the last personal\r\nconfessions of the monarch, Hardynge puts into his mouth the following\r\npenitent lamentations regarding the changes which the ravages of the\r\ndisease had wrought upon his frame and face:—\r\n\r\n “This wormes mete, this carryon full vnquert,\r\n  That some tyme thought in worlde it had ne pere;\r\n  This face so foule that _Leprous_ doth apere,\r\n  That here afore I have had such a pride\r\n  To purtraye oft in many place full wyde,” etc.[240]\r\n\r\nThese observations are certainly by no means sufficient either decidedly\r\nto confirm or controvert the opinion that Henry IV. was affected with\r\nleprosy; but they serve at least to show that, at the time at which he\r\nlived, rank of the highest kind was not considered as any adequate\r\nbarrier against an attack of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn none of these alleged cases of leprosy in the royal family of England\r\nis the proof of the actual existence of the disease at all indubitable\r\nand complete. The evidence is more certain and satisfactory in regard to\r\nthe occurrence of the malady, in its genuine form, in other scions of\r\nthe House of Anjou than those who ascended the throne of England. I\r\nallude especially to the case of Baldwin IV., King of Jerusalem, a\r\ndirect descendant, like the royal Plantagenets of England, from Fulk,\r\nCount of Anjou and Touraine. All historians seem to agree in stating\r\nBaldwin IV. to have laboured for some years under elephantiasis, and to\r\nhave ultimately resigned his sceptre in consequence of disability from\r\nthat disease. He was, says Fuller, when speaking of him under the year\r\n1174, “enclined to the leprosie called elephantiasis.”[241] By the year\r\n1183, “the leprosie had arrested him prisoner and kept him at home.\r\nLong” (adds the same historian) “had the king’s spirit endured this\r\ninfirmity, swallowing many a bitter pang with a smiling face, and going\r\nupright with patient shoulders under the weight of his disease. It made\r\nhim put all his might to it, because when he yielded to his sicknesse,\r\nhe must leave off the managing of the State; and he was loth to put off\r\nhis royal robes before he went to bed, a crown being too good a\r\ncompanion for one to part with willinglie. But at last he was made to\r\nstoop, and retired himself to a private life.”[242]\r\n\r\nThe disease, as has been above observed, did not spare the royal family\r\nof Scotland. At least two cases of leprosy are alleged to have occurred\r\namong the members of it. The first and earliest of these, however, is\r\nmuch more a matter of fable than of fact, and the story, as told us by\r\nHector Boece and Dempster, is, in all probability, due rather to their\r\nlove of historical romance than their knowledge of historical records.\r\nFiacre, the subject of it, still holds a place as a saint in the\r\nCatholic calendars of France and Germany. Among the long list of\r\noaths[243] which Rabelais, in his Pantagruel, long ago put into the\r\nmouth of the garrulous Panurge, one is an imprecation “par l’espine de\r\nSaint Fiacre.” This Saint Fiacre or St. Fithulk (as he was sometimes\r\ntermed) was the reputed son of Eugenius IV. King of Scotland. Preferring\r\na cloister to a court, he is said to have retired into France, and to\r\nhave led the life of a religious solitary in a cell granted to him by\r\nPharo, Bishop of Meaux. After his father was dead and his brother\r\ndeposed, the Scottish nobles sent a deputation to Fiacre with an offer\r\nof the throne of his ancestors. But “quhen (to state the result in\r\nBoece’s words) thir ambassatouris was brocht to his presence, he apperit\r\nto thair sicht sa ful of _lipper_, that he was repute be thaim the maist\r\nhorribill creature in erd” (on earth).[244] Spottiswood fixes the era\r\nof his death in the year 665.[245]\r\n\r\nThe case of King Robert the Bruce is a more recent and a more\r\nauthenticated instance of leprosy in the royal family of Scotland. All\r\nauthorities agree in stating that the Bruce suffered under a “lang\r\nseknes,” as Wyntoun[246] expresses it. Froissart, who visited the\r\nScottish Court in the reign of his grandson Robert II., describes, in\r\nmore than one passage, the Bruce as having been afflicted with and died\r\nof “_la grosse maladie_,” “sore greved with ye great sickenes”[247] as\r\nLord Berners has translated it.[248] In their editions of Froissart’s\r\nworks, Sauvage,[249] Buchon,[250] and Johnes,[251] severally comment\r\nupon “la grosse maladie” of Froissart, as signifying the leprosy. I have\r\nalready adverted to this expression as being quite synonymous in words\r\nand meaning with the Saxon term for the disease. Further, that Bruce was\r\nreally affected with and died of leprosy, seems to be borne out by the\r\nevidence of the older historians. Hemingford, a contemporary of Bruce’s,\r\ndescribes him as “lepra percussus;”[252] and Walsingham uses the same\r\nlanguage both in his _Chronica_[253] and in his _Ypodigma\r\nNeustriæ_;[254] Boece speaks of Bruce as dying of leprosy (ex lepra fato\r\nconcessit);[255] and Buchanan gives to his disease the more unequivocal\r\nname of elephantiasis (“nam in elephantiam incederat”).[256] Leland, in\r\nthe translation which he has given in the first volume of his\r\n_Collectanea_ from the famous _Scalacronica_, speaks of ambassadors\r\nbeing sent from England to “Murrefe (Moray), the guardiane of Scotlande\r\nin the nonage of King Davy, whos fader dyed of the Lepre;”[257] “_qui\r\nmort estoit de lepre_,” in the words of the original works.[258] In the\r\nold and valuable _Chronicle of Lanercost_, which has only been for the\r\nfirst time printed within the last two years, the disease and death of\r\nthe Bruce are mentioned in terms equally precise. In speaking (p. 254)\r\nof Randolph and Douglas entering England in 1326, the Chronicle states\r\nthat the Scottish army was not led by Bruce in person, because “factus\r\nerat Leprosus.”[259] His death is thus announced in a subsequent page\r\n(264) of these old and probably contemporary records, under the year\r\n1329, “mortuus est Dominus Robertus Brus, Rex Scotiæ, leprosus.”\r\n\r\nI shall close these remarks by alluding to one other reputed case of\r\nleprosy in a descendant of the royal families of Scotland. The\r\ncelebrated Constance, Duchess of Britanny, who was allied to the royal\r\nfamilies both of England and Scotland (being a granddaughter of Malcolm\r\nIII. of Scotland, and the English Princess Margaret Atheling, and at the\r\nsame time a descendant of a natural daughter of Henry I.), is generally\r\nalleged by historians to have suffered and died from leprosy.[260]\r\nWilliam of Nangris (as Lobineau observes) “has shown that she died of\r\nleprosy (_de la lepre_), a disease with which females were occasionally\r\nattacked in these times.” Lobineau places the date of the decease of\r\nConstance in the year 1201.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEX OF THE LEPERS.\r\n\r\nThe modern history of tubercular leprosy would seem to show that the\r\ndisease attacks the male in a larger proportion than the female sex.\r\nFrom the table which Dr. Adams collected and published of patients\r\nadmitted into the leper-house of Funchal, Madeira,[261] from 1702 to\r\n1803, it appears that during that period 526 infected males were\r\nadmitted into the hospital, while the corresponding list of infected\r\nfemales amounts only to 373. The enumeration of the lepers in the\r\nGlasgow leper hospital in 1589,[262] and those entered into the\r\nGreenside hospital of Edinburgh in 1591 (the only two old lists of\r\npatients of such institutions in Britain that I am acquainted with),\r\nshow the diseased inmates of these two establishments to have been all\r\nmales. A large proportion of the English lazar-houses seem, from the\r\nlanguage of their charters, to have been endowed entirely for males\r\n(_fratres leprosi_), but, at the same time, we have abundant evidence in\r\nthe same documents that females often suffered from the disease.[263]\r\nSome of the lazar-houses were founded and endowed for admitting infected\r\ninmates of both sexes (_fratres et sorores leprosæ_). Thus Tanner states\r\nthat the old lazar-house of St. Nicolas, York, contained both male and\r\nfemale lepers.[264] Mackarell and Bridges both mention the same fact\r\nwith regard to the hospitals of St. Nicolas at Lynne Regis,[265] and of\r\nSt. Leonard at Northampton;[266] and the inmates of the leper-house of\r\nSt. Giles, Shrewsbury, bore, according to Owen and Blakeway,[267] the\r\nstyle of the prior, brethren and sisters of St. Giles. A few of the\r\nEnglish hospitals were indeed entirely devoted to the reception of\r\nleprous females. Thus the hospital of Mayden Bradley was founded in the\r\ntime of Henry II. for those of the female sex only (_pro mulieribus\r\nleprosis_); and the hospital of St. James, Westminster (which, says\r\nBishop Tanner, stood on or near the place now occupied by the palace of\r\nthe same name), was destined, as the renewed charter of Henry III.\r\nbears, for fourteen leprous girls (_quatuordecim Leprosis\r\npuellis_).[268]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF THOSE ATTACKED—DURATION OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThere are no documents (as far as I am aware) which directly throw any\r\nlight on the age of the inmates of the leper hospitals. The expression,\r\nhowever, of _puellæ_, which I have just quoted as applied to the inmates\r\nof St. James’ Hospital, shows the youth not less than the sex of the\r\ninmates of that institution, and so far demonstrates that the disease\r\nthen, as it does now, sometimes attacked its victims very early in life.\r\nBaldwin IV. of Jerusalem, (whose case I have already referred to) was\r\naffected with the disease while still a minor, and surrendered his crown\r\nat the age of 23, in consequence of the ravages which the disease had by\r\nthat time made upon his constitution. “He died young,” says Fuller, “at\r\nfive-and-twenty years of age—a king happie in this, that he died before\r\nthe death of his kingdome.”[269]\r\n\r\nKing Robert the Bruce, another, as we have already seen, of the royal\r\nvictims of the malady, died at the age of 55.[270] But it is difficult\r\nto fix the precise date of the first attack of the disease in the case\r\nof the Scottish king, and hence difficult to deduce the exact duration\r\nof the malady in this particular instance. His faithful biographer,\r\nBarbour, describes him as “tuk with sic a sicknes” before the battle of\r\nInverury in 1307, “that he mycht nothyr rid na ga”[271]—(that he might\r\nneither ride nor walk). Kerr, in his _History of the Life and Reign of\r\nthe Bruce_, seems to hint that this was the commencement of the disease\r\nwhich ultimately carried him off;[272] and indeed Barbour, in a\r\nsubsequent part of his poem, describes his fatal malady as\r\n“beguth”—(begun)\r\n\r\n              throuch his cald lying\r\n  Quhen in his gret myscheiff wes he.—P. 407.\r\n\r\nBut if the affection commenced in so acute a form at that date, it must\r\nhave lasted for the long period of twenty-two years, as his death did\r\nnot take place till 1329. If the disease under which the king suffered\r\nso severely in 1307 had been leprosy, it would not in all probability\r\nhave left his activity and individual prowess for so long a date\r\nunimpaired. The battle-axe which, on the evening before the battle of\r\nBannockburn, cleft at a single blow the helmet and skull of Henry de\r\nBohun, could scarcely have been wielded by the arm of one whose body had\r\nfor some years previously been the seat of a mortal disease. Some facts,\r\nhowever, would seem to show that the malady had assumed a marked and\r\nsevere form a considerable time before the Bruce’s death. I have already\r\nshown, from the _Chronicle of Lanercost_, that three years before his\r\ndemise the Bruce was already so incapacitated by the inroads of the\r\nleprosy that he was unable to undertake the command of the army in their\r\ndescent upon the northern counties of England.[273] The same reason\r\nrendered him, as we are informed by Barbour, unable to attend the\r\npeaceful nuptial feast of his son at Berwick in 1328. It may not be\r\nconsidered uninteresting to add, as a part both of the history of the\r\nman and of the disease under which he was labouring, that during these\r\nthree last years of his life, and whilst “the sicknes” affected his body\r\n“so fellely” (to use Barbour’s words), “and him trawaillat sa that he\r\nconsidered death certen,” his naturally energetic mind was still active\r\nand vigorous. The accounts of his chamberlain, preserved in the Register\r\nHouse of Edinburgh,[274] show that, during the very last year of his\r\nlife, he was busied in making experiments on ship-building and\r\nnavigation in his retirement at Cardross Castle, near the banks of the\r\nClyde, in Dumbartonshire. Within a month before his death, he indited\r\nfrom this place a letter (the original of which still exists among the\r\nold archives of Melrose Abbey, preserved in the General Register House,\r\nEdinburgh[275]), desiring his heart to be buried within the precincts of\r\nthat monastery,—a wish which he changed, a short time before he\r\nexpired, into the well-known commission to his favourite follower and\r\nfriend, “ye gentle knighte of Douglas,” viz. “I woll yat, as soone as I\r\nam trespassed oute of this worlde, ye take my harte oute of my body, and\r\nembaume it, and present it to the Holy Sepulchre at Jeruslem, saying my\r\nbodie can nat come.”[276]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF THE LEPROSY.\r\n\r\nFew facts in the history of tubercular leprosy seem to be more\r\nuniversally admitted by all writers on the disease, both ancient and\r\nmodern, than the transmission of the predisposition to it from parents\r\nto offspring. The Greek and Arabian physicians considered it as a malady\r\nin which all the fluids of the body were equally diseased (corrumpens\r\npariter omnes humores corporis). “Fit itaque (adds Haly Abbas, the\r\nwell-known Arabian author of the tenth century, in his chapter “De\r\nElephantia”), cum humoribus spermatis corruptio, cum et humores et\r\nsperma ex sanguine fiant, in tantum, ut in generatione passio haec\r\ntranseat in filios.” (Theoric, lib. viii. cap. 15.) Avicenna and the\r\nlater Arabian authors, with Theodoric, Lanfranc, and other European\r\nwriters of the middle ages, express a similar belief in the hereditary\r\ntransmission of the disease; and in the same spirit, our countryman\r\nGilbert, writing, as we have already seen, in the thirteenth century,\r\nobserves, “Lepra est interdum morbus primus, sicut ex spermatibus primis\r\nmatris et patris Leprosis. Sanguis enim corruptus interius, qui est\r\nnutrimentum foetus, corrumpit foetum.”[277]\r\n\r\nAmid the scattered fragments relative to the former history of leprosy\r\nin this country, it can scarcely be expected that we should have\r\npreserved for us any individual data bearing directly upon the\r\ntransmission of the disease from father to son. I have met, however,\r\nwith one notice, which, though imperfect, it may not be considered\r\nuninteresting to quote in regard to the present question. In the Burgh\r\nRecords of Glasgow for 1581, Patrick Bogle is ordered to be inspected\r\nfor leprosy;[278] and eight years afterwards (1589) “Robert Bogill,\r\n_sone_ to Patrick Bogle,” is reported as an inmate of the leper-house\r\nbelonging to the city.[279]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to adduce the opinions of modern authors in support of\r\nthe occasional hereditary transmission of leprosy, as all observers who\r\nhave described the disease from their own observations, and that in the\r\nmost different and distant parts of the world, seem uniformly agreed\r\nupon this point. Dr. Heineken, in his account of the inmates of the\r\nleper hospital at Funchal, Madeira, in 1825,[280] states that in three\r\nof the cases no hereditary taint was known; the aunt of a fourth (p. 21)\r\nwas a lazar; the uncle and two brothers of a fifth (p. 18) laboured\r\nunder the same disease; the mother, brother, and son of a sixth (p. 19),\r\nwere lepers, and all of them affected before himself; and in a seventh\r\ncase (a female aged 35) her father, mother, three sisters, and two\r\nbrothers, had already all died of elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nAmong the seven cases of elephantiasis seen by Dr. Kinnis in the\r\nMauritius,[281] three were Mozambique slaves, and could give no\r\nsatisfactory account of their parentage. Of the remaining four—the\r\nfirst could give no history of her father and mother, but had brothers\r\nand sisters in perfect health: the ancestors of the second patient had\r\nnot been affected with leprosy, but her husband had laboured under it\r\nfor two years before death: the third case was a daughter of these\r\nparents, and one of her brothers had died of elephantiasis: the fourth\r\npatient appeared to have inherited the predisposition from the family of\r\nhis maternal grandmother, who was never attacked herself, but who lost\r\ntwo sisters and three nieces by the disease.\r\n\r\nThese and other similar data show that the predisposition to leprosy,\r\nlike the predisposition to other hereditary diseases, may occasionally\r\nshow itself only in one or two individual members of a family; and may\r\nsometimes lie dormant for one or two generations, to reappear in a\r\nsubsequent one. “God and Nature,” says the reverend author of a\r\ndescription of the Faroe Isles, formerly quoted, “deals wonderfully with\r\nsuch people (lepers) in their marriages, for amongst the children, they\r\nbeget some clean and some unclean. It has also been taken notice of that\r\ntwo living together in marriage, though the one be found infected, they\r\nlive together as before, as long as one doth but murmur of it, till the\r\nmagistrate doth separate them, and yet the sound remaineth uninfected;\r\nwhereas another is often taken with the disease by a very little\r\nconversation.... What is this? but that God confirms the truth of his\r\nword, taking pleasure in them that live in a just wedlock, and wander in\r\nlawful ways, putting their hopes in him, that neither fire nor water,\r\ncontagious disease, nor dangerous pestilence shall hurt them.”[282]\r\n\r\nIn some of the few districts of Europe in which cases of the disease\r\nhave continued to linger down to a late period, the malady seems to be\r\ntransmitted through an old hereditary taint in particular families,\r\nrather than generated by existing external circumstances acting on the\r\nbodies of those who now become its victims. The tubercular leprosy\r\nexists still, or at least existed lately, in the districts of Martigues\r\nand Vitrolles[283] in the south of France. The cases, though very few,\r\nhave still been well marked. M. Vidal, who, towards the end of last\r\ncentury, described several instances of the disease which he saw at\r\nMartigues, states that, with one problematical exception, the malady was\r\nin every case hereditary.[284] “May we not,” he adds, “conclude from\r\nthis, that if the local causes which are generally assigned for leprosy\r\nbe true, they have not, at least in our country, sufficient power to\r\noriginate the disease (la faire naître), but generally only to develope\r\nand perpetuate it in the descendants of ancient lepers?”[285] The same\r\nfamily predisposition probably perpetuated the malady for some\r\ngenerations in the few cases that occurred in Shetland, in the latter\r\npart of the last century. The case of the Shetlander Berns, as\r\nmentioned in a preceding Part, was an instance in which the disease was\r\napparently the result of hereditary transmission from his ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe predisposition from hereditary constitution to leprosy, and some\r\nother diseases, was well known to our forefathers; and, if we place\r\ncredit in the account of the “auld manneris” of the Scotch antecedently\r\nto the reign of Malcolm Canmore, as “compilit be the nobil clerke,\r\nMaister Hector Boëce, Channon of Aberdene,” they were accustomed to\r\npractise hygienic measures that were assuredly more summary than humane,\r\nin order to arrest the diffusion of disease by such channels. For, to\r\nquote the words of Boëce:—“He that was trublit with the falling evil\r\n(epilepsy), or fallin daft or wod (insane), or having sic infirmitie as\r\nsuccedis be _heritage_ fra the fader to the son, was geldit\r\n(_castratus_), that his infekit blude suld spreid na forthir. The women\r\nthat was fallin _Lipper_, or had any other infection of blude, was\r\nbanist fra the cumpany of men, and gif scho consavit barne under sic\r\ninfirmitie, baith scho and hir barne war buryit quik (if she conceived a\r\nchild under such infirmity, both she and her child were buried\r\nalive”).[286]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EXCITING CAUSES OF LEPROSY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the causes of diseases has, probably more than any\r\nother department of medicine, been marked by belief without evidence,\r\nand assertion without facts. The history of the opinions which have at\r\ndifferent times been so freely offered and adopted with regard to the\r\nproduction of leprosy, and the numerous explanations which have been\r\nproposed with respect to the causes of its almost epidemic prevalence in\r\nEurope in the middle ages, and its nearly complete suspension in the\r\nsame region of the world at the present day, might easily, if time and\r\nspace permitted, be made to form a chapter highly illustrative of the\r\nabove general remark. The frequency of the disease in former times has\r\nbeen confidently ascribed by different authors[287] to peculiarities in\r\nthe diet, dress, personal and domestic habits, etc., of our forefathers.\r\nAnd certainly their mode of life was in many respects specially\r\ncalculated to generate derangements and eruptions of the skin. The good\r\nold Saxon practice of bathing[288] appears to have become forgotten\r\nafter the date of the Norman conquest; and in the subsequent history of\r\nthese early times we might trace various indirect and direct causes of\r\ncutaneous disease, in the close hovels and unventilated dwellings of the\r\nperiod;[289] in the habits of personal uncleanness;[290] in the rough\r\nstraw bedding then generally[291] in use, and which “hard lodging”\r\nHollinshed describes as still used by the servants in his day, “with\r\nseldome (he adds) anie sheete vnder their bodies to keepe them from the\r\npricking straws that run oft through the canvas, and rase their hardened\r\nhides;”[292] and probably also in the articles of diet[293] on which the\r\ngeneral community were obliged to subsist in times before the\r\nimprovement of agriculture, and the introduction of that “schamefull\r\nintemperance” (as old Boece[294] fanatically terms it), “when na fische\r\nin the see, nor foule in the aire, nor beast in the wod may have rest,\r\nbut are socht heir and thair to satisfy the hungry appetit.” For the\r\ninvestigation of this and other allied questions in the history of the\r\nproduction of our older epidemic and endemic diseases, the works of\r\nHollinshed, Strutt, Henry, Chalmers, Macpherson, and others, contain a\r\ngreat and available mass of materials. But, in consequence of the\r\nunforeseen extent to which our present remarks have already lengthened\r\nout, we are forced to abstain from entering into this topic, and\r\ndiscussing the notes which we have collected in regard to it. At the\r\nsame time, however, we may pause to observe that we believe it would be\r\nno easy matter to point out the exact differences in those physical\r\nconditions of the inhabitants of this country in former and in modern\r\ntimes, which may have led to the prevalence of the disease amongst our\r\nancestors, and to its disappearance amongst us. If poverty in diet, or\r\npersonal wants, and filth, and wretchedness in their deepest degrees,\r\ncould generate the malady, there are certainly still numerous spots in\r\ncontinental Europe, and even in our own land, where, unfortunately, all\r\nthese elements of disease are in our own day in full and active\r\noperation, without any such specific result following; the alleged\r\ncauses are present without the alleged effects.\r\n\r\nIn order to attain anything like satisfactory results of the supposed\r\nphysical causes of leprosy in Great Britain in former times, the whole\r\nquestion would require to be thoroughly investigated in connection with\r\ntwo others, viz., the allied physical circumstances,—_firstly_, of the\r\ninhabitants of those countries in which the disease in the same way\r\nformerly raged; and, _secondly_, of those districts of the world in\r\nwhich it is still prevalent. It is only by following such a line of\r\ninquiry that we could hope, if at all, to separate mere matters of\r\nopinion from matters of fact, and at last to obtain, by a kind of\r\nreasoning by exclusion, the exact physical condition or conditions of a\r\npeople that are capable of originating or of spreading this particular\r\nspecies of disease. The difficulty of the problem may be easily\r\nappreciated by glancing for a moment at the diversified _geographical\r\nlocalities_ and circumstances under which the tubercular leprosy is\r\nknown at the present day to appear. In modern times it has been found\r\nexisting, to a more or less limited extent, in places the most distant\r\nand the most dissimilar in regard to temperature, climate, situation,\r\nsoil, etc., as in Sumatra,[295] under the equator, and in parts of\r\nIceland almost within the verge of the Arctic Circle;[296] in the\r\ntemperate regions of both hemispheres, as (in the southern) at Hamel en\r\nAarde[297] in the Cape district, and (in the northern) at Madeira[298]\r\nand Morocco;[299] in the dry and arid plains of Arabia,[300] and in the\r\nwet and malarious districts of Batavia[301] and Surinam;[302] along the\r\nshores of Guiana,[303] and Sierra Leone,[304] and in the interior of\r\nAfrica,[305] Hindostan,[306] Asia Minor,[307] and Asiatic Russia;[308]\r\non the sea-coast, as at Carthagena,[309] and thousands of feet above\r\nthe level of the ocean, as on the table-land of Mexico;[310] on some of\r\nthe islands in the Indian,[311] Chinese,[312] Caribbean,[313] and\r\nMediterranean[314] seas, and on the continents of Asia, Africa, and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGION AS A CAUSE OF LEPROSY.\r\n\r\nMost modern pathologists seem inclined to call in question the\r\ncontagious nature of tubercular leprosy, as it at present exists in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nCullen, Darwin, and Good are almost the only English physicians of later\r\ntimes that have admitted the contagious character of the disease, and\r\nthat not from personal observation. The evidence bearing against the\r\ndoctrine of this mode of its diffusion is principally of a simply\r\nnegative kind. In some of the districts in which the malady is endemic,\r\nthe sick are seen to maintain a free intercourse with the healthy,\r\nwithout the disease being frequently or at all communicated to the\r\nlatter; the nurses of the lazar hospitals are alleged to remain\r\nuninfected; lepers often continue long in the midst of their families\r\nwithout spreading the scourge to any of the other members; and\r\noccasionally a husband and wife are seen living in wedlock for years,\r\none of them deeply affected by the disease, and the other remaining\r\nperfectly sound. Instances, exceptional to these general remarks, are\r\ncertainly occasionally observed, as in a case quoted in a previous page\r\nfrom Dr. Kinnis, of a wife becoming infected subsequently to both her\r\nhusband and daughter suffering from an attack of the malady. In such\r\ncases as this, however, we must recollect that the repetition of the\r\ndisease in two or more members of the same family may merely depend upon\r\nthe same external or general morbific agencies, acting upon the\r\nconstitution of all the sufferers.\r\n\r\nAt least, whenever, from circumstances, this source of fallacy is\r\navoided, the evidence of the contagion of leprosy seems to become more\r\nand more defective. Thus, when the disease happens to be imported in the\r\nperson of an infected individual from a district in which it is endemic,\r\nto one in which it is unknown, the malady seems to have no tendency\r\nwhatever at the present day to spread to any of the inhabitants of the\r\nnew and healthy locality. Persons labouring under tubercular leprosy are\r\noccasionally, for example, sent from southern stations to England and\r\nFrance. In such not unfrequent cases the malady has never, I believe,\r\nbeen known to be communicated, in one single instance, from the infected\r\nperson to those resident inhabitants of the new district, among whom he\r\nwas living in free and daily intercourse.[315]\r\n\r\nDid the leprosy extend and prevail over Europe in the middle ages as\r\nindependently of propagation by contagion as the perpetuation of the\r\ndisease seems to be in most localities at the present day?\r\n\r\nIf we deferred to the mere opinion of the older medical and historical\r\nauthors, the contagious character of the disease at that era would\r\nappear to be undoubted. These authors express an unanimous opinion on\r\nits contagious propagation; and it is not till we come down to the\r\nprofessional writers of the seventeenth century, as Fernelius[316] and\r\nForestus,[317] that we find this doctrine ventured to be called in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, however, left us by the older authorities and physicians\r\non this point, is an evidence of opinion rather than of facts. They have\r\nbequeathed to us merely their own dogmatic inferences, without\r\nvouchsafing to state any of the individual data upon which their general\r\ndeductions were founded. As far, however, as we may judge by a few loose\r\nfragments which we may still gather up from amid the imperfect and\r\nscattered records of the disease, the European leprosy, if it were\r\ncontagious, when epidemic in the middle ages, was at least less so than\r\nthe combined medical and popular belief of those times would seem to\r\nrepresent it. In the Edinburgh hospital in 1590, two of the lepers’\r\nwives lived uninfected with their husbands; and a few of the English\r\nleper hospitals, as those of Ripon, St. Magdalene, Exeter, and St.\r\nBartholomew, near Oxford, were endowed for the purpose of serving as\r\nretreats at one and the same time both for the merely poor and the truly\r\nleprous.\r\n\r\nIndividuals stricken with leprosy were sometimes looked upon by the\r\nsuperstitious spirit of the age as persons directly smitten by the hand\r\nof God; and we find in history traces of rich and noble, and even of\r\nroyal devotees, endeavouring to expiate their sins and propitiate the\r\ngood will of Heaven, by occasionally devoting themselves, and that with\r\nperfect impunity, to such duties to the sick as offered the most certain\r\nmeans of calling down the disease upon their own bodies, provided it had\r\nbeen at all so contagious as was generally supposed. Saint Louis (Louis\r\nIX.) of France visited the leper hospitals every third month, personally\r\nrendered the most abject services to their inmates, fed them, and bathed\r\ntheir sores with his own hands.[318] Henry III. of England is reported\r\nto have annually, on Shrove Tuesday, engaged in the same duties.[319]\r\nRobert II., the son of Hugh Capet, enacted the devotee in the same\r\nmanner, imprinting kisses with his lips on the hands of the lepers (_ore\r\nproprio figens leprosorum manibus oscula, in omnibus Deum\r\ncollaudabat_).[320] The old English historian, Matthew Paris, relates,\r\nin his usual quaint and gossiping style, an anecdote illustrative of a\r\nsimilar degree of charitable penance and defiance of contagion being\r\npractised by the Scottish Princess Matilda, the queen of Henry I. of\r\nEngland. Speaking of some transactions in the year 1105, he observes—\r\n\r\n“At the same time David (King of Scotland), the brother of Matilda,\r\nQueen of the English, came to England to visit his sister, and when, on\r\na certain evening, he came by her invitation to her chamber, he found\r\nthe house filled with lepers (_domum invenit Leprosis plenam_), and the\r\nQueen standing in the midst, having laid aside her cloak, she with both\r\nhands girded herself with a towel, and water being placed in readiness,\r\nshe began to wash their feet, and wipe them with the towel, and\r\nembracing them with both hands, kissed them with the utmost devotion.\r\nUpon which her brother addressed her thus; ‘What is this which you are\r\ndoing, my Lady? in truth if the King knew this, he would never deign to\r\nkiss with his lips your mouth, contaminated by the pollution of the\r\nlepers’ feet!’ and she, smiling, replied, ‘Who knows not that the feet\r\nof an Eternal King are to be preferred to the lips of an earthly king?\r\nBehold it was for this that I invited you, dearest brother—that you\r\nmight learn by my example to perform similar actions. Do, I beseech you,\r\nthat which you see me doing.’ And when her brother had made answer that\r\nhe would by no means do such things, as she persevered in her employment\r\nDavid with a smile withdrew.”[321]\r\n\r\nIn quoting, against the alleged strong contagion of the olden leprosy,\r\nthe preceding instances of complete exposure to the infection of the\r\ndisease, and yet, at the same time, of complete escape from it in some\r\nwell-known historical personages, let it not be inferred that the\r\nvictims of the malady were usually looked upon by the general community\r\nwith feelings of devotion and pious commiseration. On the contrary, the\r\nsubjects of this “_foedissimus omnium morborum_” were, as a body,\r\nregarded alike by the church and by the people as objects of disgust.\r\nThe Council of Ancyrus decreed that lepers were only to be allowed to\r\nworship amongst the Hyemantes, or those public penitents who, on account\r\nof the enormity and turpitude of some of their sins, were obliged to\r\nstand in the open air, and not even allowed to come under the porch of\r\nthe church.[322] The Council of Worms granted to lepers a liberty of\r\nreceiving the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, but not with\r\nthose in perfect health.[323] Guido de Monte Rocher, in his _Manual for\r\nCurates_, states, that to some lepers the sacrament cannot be given,\r\nbecause “non possunt corpus Dominicum sic recipere et tractare in ore\r\nsuo, quin rejicerent ipsum, sic multi, quibus reciderunt labia et dentes\r\net sunt totaliter corrosi usque ad guttur.”[324]\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the laws of the hospital of St. Julian’s, drawn up by\r\nAbbot Michael, asserts, that “amongst all infirmities the disease of\r\nleprosy may be considered the most loathsome, and those who are smitten\r\nwith it ought at all times, and in all places, and as well in their\r\nconduct as in their dress, to bear themselves as more to be despised and\r\nas more humble than all other men.” The canons of the Church of\r\nScotland, as drawn up in the thirteenth century, deal with the\r\nunfortunate lepers more humanely than most other ecclesiastical\r\njudicatories; for after recommending them to be admonished to respect\r\nthe churches of their districts, it is added that, if they cannot be\r\ninduced to do so, let no coercion be employed, seeing that affliction\r\nshould not be accumulated upon the afflicted, but rather their miseries\r\ncommiserated (_cum afflictis addi non debeat afflictio, sed ipsorum,\r\nmiseriis sit potius miserandum_.)[325] But the contempt displayed\r\ntowards them seems to have been almost proverbial as late as the age of\r\nElizabeth. Thus Shakespeare makes Margaret of Anjou exclaim to the\r\nafflicted and suspicious Henry VI., after the murder of his uncle, the\r\nDuke of Gloucester,\r\n\r\n  Why dost thou turn away and hide thy face?\r\n  I am no loathsome leper, look on me.[326]\r\n\r\nMaundrell, one of our early English travellers in Palestine, alludes to\r\nsome cases of leprosy in terms portraying simply but strongly the\r\nfearful effects and character of the disease. After speaking of some\r\ncases of leprosy that he met with in his journey, he states (to quote\r\nhis own words), “At Sichem, near Naplous, there were not less than ten\r\nlepers,—the same number that was cleansed by our Saviour not far from\r\nthe same place, that came a-begging to us at one time. Their manner is\r\nto come with small buckets in their hands to receive the alms of the\r\ncharitable, their touch being still held infectious, or at least\r\nunclean. Their whole distemper was so noisome that it might (he adds)\r\nwell pass for the utmost corruption of the human body on this side the\r\ngrave.”[327]\r\n\r\nVarious authors have alleged that the institution of leper hospitals,\r\nand laws for the separation and seclusion of the infected, were formed\r\nmore from imitation of the Levitical institutions regarding the leprosy\r\nthan from direct observation and proofs of the contagious character of\r\nthe disease. The avoidance, however, and separation of the sick, have\r\nbeen recommended and followed by authors and by communities over whom\r\nthe Levitical laws could have exercised no influence, direct or\r\nindirect, and to whom, indeed, these laws were in all probability\r\ntotally unknown.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the horrors and course of elephantiasis or tubercular\r\nleprosy, the old Roman physician, Aretæus, adds, “seeing the infected\r\nwith this disease are such, who would not fly them? (_aufugiat_), or who\r\nwould not turn aside from a leper, even although he were a son, or a\r\nfather, or a brother, since there is fear lest the disease should be\r\ncommunicated? (_quum metus est ne morbus communicaretur_). Hence,\r\nmany have banished those that were dearest to them into solitudes and\r\nmountains.”[328]\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the laws and customs of the Jews in all probability never\r\nreached, or at least certainly never influenced, the opinions of the\r\ninhabitants of Tonquin—a kingdom which was formerly a part, and long a\r\ntributary, of China, and where the general religion is the idolatry of\r\nFo and of Lanzo, with sects of the literati or followers of\r\nConfucius;[329] yet in that country those infected with leprosy are\r\ntreated on the same principles of separation from the general community\r\nas we find applied to them in other and distant districts. “In Tonquin,\r\nleprosy is so common,” says Richard in his history of that country,\r\n“that there are pieces of land assigned where those attacked by it must\r\nreside. They are shut out from society; and it is even lawful to kill\r\nthem if they enter cities or towns.”[330] In a country like Tonquin, it\r\nis difficult to conceive how laws and usages of this kind could have\r\noriginated in anything except a belief in the contagious nature of the\r\ndisease, as derived from the observation of its mode of diffusion. At\r\nall events, the old institutions and customs of the different kingdoms\r\nof Europe, in regard to lepers, seem all to have been originally founded\r\non such a belief in the possibility of the contagious communication of\r\nthis dreadful and dreaded disease from the sick to the healthy. These\r\ninstitutions and customs I propose now to sketch very briefly, and that\r\nprincipally as they bear upon the usages formerly observed towards\r\nlepers in England and Scotland. I shall consider them as they refer\r\nto—1. The separation of the infected from the general intercourse of\r\nsociety; 2. The laws prohibiting their entrance into towns; and 3. The\r\nrestrictions under which they were placed as inmates of the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF LEPERS FROM THE GENERAL AND HEALTHY COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\nAfter all that I have already had occasion to state relative to the\r\nobjects of the leper hospitals, and the selection of the infected, it is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add that in Great Britain, as upon the\r\nContinent,[331] lepers were obliged, either by law or usage, to seclude\r\nthemselves from society when once the disease was discovered upon their\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe chancery warrant of Edward IV., quoted in the Second Part of these\r\npapers, speaks of the retirement of a leper from society as a matter of\r\ncustom and duty, and empowers the sheriff of the county to remove the\r\nsuspected person to a secluded place, as is the usage (_prout moris\r\nest_), provided the actual existence of the disease was made out.[332]\r\n\r\nThere exist in the old records of Scotland both local and general\r\nenactments enforcing the retirement and seclusion of lepers. The\r\nScottish “Burrow Lawes” (_Leges Burgorum_) are generally allowed to have\r\nbeen drawn up as early as the twelfth century.[333] They are a code\r\nintended apparently for the government of the four first royal burghs of\r\nScotland, viz. Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling. Their\r\nsixty-fourth chapter contains some regulations regarding “lippermen.”\r\nThe first of these regulations provides in the following terms for the\r\nlodgment in hospital and sustenance of the “lippermen” of the\r\nburghs:[334]—\r\n\r\n“Gif ony man dwelland or borne in the King’s Burgh is striken with\r\nleprosie, and hes substance and geir of his awin to sustaine and cleath\r\nhimselfe, he sall be put in the hospitall of that burgh quhere he\r\ndwells. And gif he hes na thing to liue upon, the burgesses of that\r\nburgh sall make ane collection amongst them, for meat and claith to him;\r\nand that collection sall be the summe of twentie shillinges.”[335]\r\n\r\nThe canons of the Church of Scotland, as drawn up or authorised by the\r\nprovincial ecclesiastical councils held at Perth in the years 1242 and\r\n1269, speak of those attacked by leprosy in this country, as being\r\n“separated from society in accordance with general custom (_de\r\nconsuetudine generali a communione hominum separantur_) and retired to\r\nsecluded situations.”[336]\r\n\r\nI have already, in Part II., quoted a clause from the acts of the Perth\r\nParliament of 1427, empowering and enforcing the dignitaries and\r\nofficers of the church to search diligently in their parish visitations\r\nfor any persons affected with leprosy, and to commit them to the keeping\r\nof either the civil or ecclesiastical authorities, according as they\r\nhappened to be “Clerkes” or “Seculars.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPROHIBITIONS AGAINST THE INFECTED ENTERING TOWNS.\r\n\r\nLepers were compelled, by other reasons than mere custom or common law,\r\nto retire from society. They were of necessity driven to seek the asylum\r\nof the lazar hospitals, in consequence of the statutes, both of the\r\ngeneral country and of local communities, prohibiting any citizen from\r\nretaining a person labouring under leprosy in his house, and preventing\r\nthe infected from entering within the gates of the towns and\r\nvillages.[337]\r\n\r\nThe old Scottish Burrow Lawes have stringent clauses upon this head,\r\nfor they hold that “na man should presume, or be so bauld as to harberie\r\nor ludge ane lipperman within the burgh, under ane full amerciament.”\r\nAnd further, “lippermen sall not enter within the towne, bot in passing\r\nthrow it, and sall not gang fra dure to dure, but sall sit at the ports\r\nof the burgh, and sall seek almes fra them that passes in and comes\r\nfurth.”[338]\r\n\r\nBy the later general act of the Perth Parliament, the unfortunate beings\r\naffected with the disease were again prohibited from entering towns\r\nexcept for the purpose of purchasing victuals, and this they were only\r\nallowed to do on three days of the week, the act strictly providing\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n“_Item_, Na lipper folke, nouther man nor woman, enter nor cum in ane\r\nBurgh of the Realme but thrise in the oulk (week) that is to saie,\r\nMondaie, Wednesdaie, and Fridaie, fra ten hours to twa after noone; and\r\nquhair faires and mercattis fallis on thay dayis, that they leave their\r\nentrie in the Burrowes, and gang on the morne to get their living.”[339]\r\n\r\nVarious towns and local judicatories in the country seem to have at\r\ndifferent times passed laws enforcing more strictly the observance of\r\nexclusion of the infected from their own limits and districts. Some of\r\nthese local enactments have been preserved; and I shall quote such as I\r\nhave been able to discover, with a view to show the general fear\r\nformerly entertained of the contagion of the disease, and the measures\r\nthat were adopted to prevent its communication.\r\n\r\nThus, in the statutes of the Society of Merchants or Guildry of\r\nBerwick-upon-Tweed, said to have been drawn up by the mayor and others\r\nin “the Zeare of God 1283-84,” it is strictly provided that “Na lipper\r\nman sall enter within the portes of our burgh; and gif any by chance\r\nenters within them, he sall be incontinent put forth be the sergant of\r\nthe burgh. And gif any lipper man uses commonlie contrair this our\r\ndischarge, to come within our burgh, his claithes wherewith he is cled\r\nsall be taken from him and sall be brunt, and he being naked sall be\r\nejected furth of the burgh. Because it is provyded be the common\r\ncouncill, that some gude man sall gather almes to them, that they may be\r\nsustained in ane place competent for them without the burgh. And this is\r\nto be understand of lipper folk, indwellers within the burgh, and not of\r\nthem quha dwells without the burgh.”[340]\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller burghs and villages of these early times had their\r\nindividual rules and statutes upon the same point. The burgh of\r\nPrestwick, Ayrshire, which contains at present, and probably never\r\ncontained more than about 1000 inhabitants, is situated about\r\nhalf-a-mile north of the leper hospital of Kingcase. The old official\r\nrecords and statutes of this small burgh, to which reference has\r\nrepeatedly been made in the preceding pages, have lately been printed\r\nfrom the original MS. by Mr. Smith of Swinridgemuir. The earliest burgh\r\nrecord that has thus been preserved is a collection of the laws of the\r\nburgh, “Statuta Burgi de Prestwick maide by the haile consent of the\r\ncommunity of the same at the Cross of the same burgh, and to be keepit\r\nand rafit unremittable and unrevocable.” The date of this collection, or\r\nprobably re-collection of the burgh laws, is 1470. The fourth of the\r\nstatutes fixed upon “for the common profit of the said burgh in time\r\ncoming for everlasting memorans” is to the following effect:—\r\n\r\n“It is statut yat na man inhabitant ye said burghe or weman commoun or\r\nintromet with ye sic folk (commune or intromit with the sick people) of\r\nKingcase, vnder ye pain of exiling ye said burghe when thai ar ourtane\r\n(overtaken) be ane enquest yairupon, mair plainli yan ony oyder\r\npersounis or persoun duelland in all ye land about.”—P. 15.\r\n\r\nIn the minuted records of the burgh, different cases occur of persons\r\naccused in accordance with this statute. Thus, on December 1, 1477, Anne\r\nKerd and Andro Sauer are accused of repairing to Kingcase.[341] On the\r\n26th April of the second following year, 1479, it was alleged with\r\nregard to the said Andro Sauer, that he “repairis till Kingcase daily\r\nand nigtly and his wif and his bairnis.”[342] This Anne Kerd seems to\r\nhave had the property of a burgess. At last, in November 1481, the same\r\nrebellious Prestwickian, “Andro Sauer, is fund in daili reparand to\r\nKingcase, and yis the xxti court yerein, and is abill till infect ye\r\nhale toune; and weris ye seik folkis clathis and bonnettis.”[343] After\r\nthis date no more mention is made in the records of Andro, who\r\nrepeatedly figures in them previously, for other more serious deeds than\r\nthat of repairing to Kingcase. I find, however, that others of his name,\r\nand probably of his kindred, fall into the same error for which he\r\nhimself appears to have been banished. Thus, in 1496, Anne Sauer, Marion\r\nMyllar, Ellane Browne, and Anne Duncane, “are ilkane severale in\r\namerciamentis for the selling of ale and intromettin of the folkis of\r\nKingcase again the statutis of the towne.”\r\n\r\nFew or none of the very early records and laws of the magistrates of\r\nEdinburgh have been preserved, but amidst some lately recovered, of a\r\ndate as late as 1530, we find the following statute anent the “Leper\r\nFolke,”—“It is statut and ordanit be the Provost, Baillies, and\r\nCounsell of this burghe that na manner of Lipper persone, man nor woman,\r\nfra this tyme furth, cum amangis uther cleine personis, nor be nocht\r\nfund in the kirk, fische merket, nor flesche merket, nor na other merket\r\nwithin this burghe, under the pane of burnyng of their cheik and\r\nbannasing off the toune.”[344]\r\n\r\nSome of the old edicts and regulations made in regard to the diseased in\r\nLondon have been preserved for us by Stow. According to the record of\r\nEdward III., that king sent, in 1346, “a commandment under his Great\r\nSeal, to the mayor and sheriffs of London, willing them to make\r\nproclamation in every ward of the city and suburbs, that all leprous\r\npersons within the said city and suburbs should avoid within fifteen\r\ndays, and that no man suffer any such leprous person to abide within his\r\nhouse, upon pain to forfeit his said house, and to incur the king’s\r\nfurther displeasure. And that they should cause the said lepers to be\r\nremoved into some out places of the Fields, from the haunt and company\r\nof all sound people.”[345] From some of the city records it further\r\nappears that the magistrates ordered “That the lepers walk not about the\r\nstreets, nor tarry there; that the keepers of the gates swear that they\r\nwill not permit lepers to enter into the city.” “There was at one time,”\r\nadds Stow, “a brief for removing them from the city and suburbs. At\r\nanother time there was an edict for levying a hundred shillings out of a\r\ntenement of the lepers, and delivering it to their officers for\r\nsustaining them.”[346]\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTRICTIONS PLACED UPON THE INMATES OF THE LEPER HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nThe chance of contagion was provided against by other means besides the\r\nmere separation of the infected from the community, and their banishment\r\nto the lazar hospitals. In many instances the regulations and statutes\r\nto which the lepers were subjected, as inmates of these hospitals, were\r\nstrongly restrictive, and framed with a view of preventing them from\r\nspreading the disease to others by any dangerous degree of personal\r\ncommunication with the healthy. The occasional severity of the\r\nrestrictions to which, with this view, the leper inhabitants of the\r\nhospitals were subjected, affords us a curious example both of the great\r\ndread in which the disease was held, and of the extent and stringency of\r\nthe measures of medical police which the local judicatories of this\r\ncountry had in these times both the power and the will to exercise.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the Greenside Hospital, Edinburgh, present in themselves a\r\nstriking proof of this, and the occupants of the hospital were bound to\r\nobserve these rules under the penalty of death. “That this,” observes\r\nArnott, “might not be deemed an empty threatening, a gallows was erected\r\nat the gavel of the hospital for the immediate execution of\r\noffenders.”[347]\r\n\r\nThe persons placed in the Greenside Hospital in 1591 were five male\r\nlepers with two of their wives—viz. (to quote the record) “Robert\r\nMardow, James Garvie, Johnn MacRere, James Wricht, and Johnn\r\nWilderspune, lepperis, togidder with Isobel Barcar, spous to the said\r\nRobert Mardow, and Janet Galt, spous to the said James Garvie.” Among\r\nother regulations enacted in regard to them, it was specially ordained,\r\n“That nane of the said personis Lepperis, or their wyffes, depart or\r\nresort fra the said hospitall to na oyder pairt, or place, bot sit still\r\nthairat, and remayne thairin nicht and day, halyday and wark-day; and\r\nthat they resave na oyder maner of personis, oyder man or woman, within\r\nthe said place, bot sic as sall be placit with thame thairin, at command\r\nof the said Counsall and Session; and that they keip the dure of the\r\nsaid hospitall fast and clois, fra the dounpassing of the sone to the\r\nrysing thairoff, under the payne of hanging.”\r\n\r\n“That the said Jonet Galt only cum to the markatts for buying sic\r\nviveris as is necessary to the saids personis, and presume to gang to na\r\noyder pairt nor place in her cuming and returning to and frae the said\r\nmarkatts, under the payne aforesaid. Quhilk and other injunctions being\r\nred to the personis foresaids, they agreit thairto, and promisit to obey\r\nand underly the samyn, under the paynes therabove written. And\r\nthairfore, for the better obedience thairof, and for terrefying the said\r\nlepperis to transgress the samyn, the said commissioners has thocht\r\nmeitt and expedient that there be ane _gibbet_ sett up at the gavell of\r\nthe said hospital; and that the forme and order thairof be insert baith\r\nin the buiks of Counsall and Sessioun of this burgh, _ad perpetuam rei\r\nmemoriam_.”[348]\r\n\r\nThe tenor of the regulations of the British leper hospitals was probably\r\nin few or no other cases so extremely stringent as in the establishment\r\nat Greenside. At least, if we may judge by the records of most of those\r\nhospitals, the rules of which have been accidentally preserved, the\r\nrestrictions placed upon the inmates were confessedly great, but\r\ncertainly by no means so severe either in their degree or in the\r\npunishment applied to them, as in those which we have just cited.\r\nBesides, in most institutions, the prior, master, or warden of the\r\nhospital, exercised a discretionary power in relation to the degree of\r\nseclusion of the lepers of their establishment.\r\n\r\nThus, among the rules of the leper hospital of St. Magdalene, Exeter, it\r\nwas provided that “no brother or sister shall go or pass out of the\r\nhouse beyond the bridge, without the gate of the said hospital, without\r\nthe license of the Warden or his deputy, upon pain to be put into the\r\nstocks, and to have but bread and water for one day.”[349]\r\n\r\nAgain, among the many rules enacted by the Abbot Michaele for the\r\nregulation of the hospital of St. Julian, in the neighbourhood of St.\r\nAlbans, I may select the following as characteristic illustrations of\r\nthe point which we are now considering:—\r\n\r\n“Let no one presume to transgress the bounds fixed of old, (_metas ab\r\nantiquo statutas_), of which one is placed in the south, another in the\r\nnorth, as they still remain in view, except the custor of granges and\r\ngranaries, to whom the charge is committed to the master.\r\n\r\n“Let no brother venture to enter the bake-house or brew-house in any\r\nmanner, with the exception of the brother to whom the charge is\r\nassigned, who, when he enters, may not approach the bread and beer, in\r\ntouching or handling them in any way; since it is not meet that men of\r\nsuch infirmity should handle those things which are appointed for the\r\ncommon use of men.\r\n\r\n“Let no one of the brothers attempt to go beyond the bounds of the\r\nhospital, namely, in the direction of the king’s road, without his close\r\ncape, in going to church or returning, nor stand or walk about in the\r\nsaid street before or after service (nor, indeed, at any hour of the day\r\nbefore or after dinner); but when divine service is finished, let them\r\nenter their hospitals with all haste, unless any one wishes to remain in\r\nthe church, that he may have leisure for prayer and meditation. In like\r\nmanner, we command that there be no standing in the corridor, which\r\nextends in length before the houses of the brothers in the direction of\r\nthe king’s road; and that no brother hold conversation there (_teneat\r\nibi parliamentum_) with another; but if any brother wish to hold\r\ncolloquy with another, let one go to the other in order, as he may wish,\r\nthrough the said corridor, without standing by the way, unless some\r\nstranger chance to meet him, with whom he may briefly speak and pass on.\r\nBut if an honest man and true come there, for the purpose of visiting an\r\ninfirm brother, let him have access to him, that they may mutually\r\ndiscourse on that which is meet.”[350]\r\n\r\nIn considering under a previous head the extent of endowment of the\r\nBritish leper hospitals, we have seen that the inmates of many of the\r\npoorer institutions depended more or less entirely for their means of\r\nsubsistence upon the casual alms which they were able to beg from the\r\ncharitable. In a few favoured cases the lepers were specially authorised\r\nto pursue this occupation beyond the district of the hospital. A charter\r\nwas given by King John to the lepers of St. Lawrence’s Hospital,\r\nBristol, granting them great privileges of this kind. Some of the\r\npassages in this charter are curious, as illustrative of the present\r\npoint. I append a translation of a part of it from the copy of the\r\noriginal document as published by Dugdale:—\r\n\r\n“John, by the grace of God, King of England, etc., to the Archbishops,\r\netc., greeting, know ye that we, for the love of God, have granted, and\r\nby this charter have confirmed to the lepers near Bristol, a croft\r\nbeyond the gate of Lacford, on the road to Bath, to dwell there, as the\r\ncharter which we gave them while we were Count Moreton reasonably\r\nproves; know ye also that we have received these lepers into our\r\nprotection, and therefore desire and command that ye befriend and\r\nprotect them (_quod eos manu teneatis et protegatis_), and cause no\r\nimpediment to them, wherever they shall be asking alms in our lands, as\r\nour letters-patent which we granted unto them when Count Moreton\r\nrationally testifies,” etc.[351]\r\n\r\nGrants and liberties, such as the above, were certainly, however, rare.\r\nIn general the lepers were restricted as to the districts and places in\r\nwhich they presented themselves to seek for alms. We have already seen\r\nthe Burrow Lawes ordering that they “sall not gang fra dure to dure, but\r\nsall sit at the ports of the burgh, and seek alms fra them that passes\r\nin and furth;” and the Scottish Parliament of 1427 enacted that they\r\nshould not be allowed to sit and beg “neither in kirk nor in\r\nkirk-yairdis,[352] nor other places within the burrowes, but at their\r\nowne hospital, and at the part of the town and other places outwith the\r\nburrowes.” But even in exercising this vocation in these stated places,\r\nthe unfortunate petitioners seem to have been everywhere obliged to use\r\ncertain precautions, with the view of prohibiting them from diffusing\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, and in various other parts of Europe, they were obliged,\r\nfor this purpose, to use a “clapper” or rattle, in order that the noise\r\ncreated by it might warn the healthy of the presence of an infected\r\nfellow-mortal, whilst, at the same time, they carried a “cop” or\r\nreceiving dish, into which the charitable might drop their alms.[353]\r\nMuratori tells us that in Italy the lepers made their presence known at\r\na great distance (_longe positos_) by the noise of a certain piece of\r\nwood. Marmotrecti describes more minutely the instrument as composed of\r\nwood, and formed of two or three tablets of it, which the leper struck\r\ntogether when seeking bread (_quas concutit leprosus quaerendo\r\npanem_).[354]\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated old Scoto-Saxon poem of Sir Tristrem, composed\r\nprobably about the middle of the thirteenth century,[355] and valuable\r\n(to use the words of an acute critic)[356] “for its pictures of ancient\r\nmanners” and the customs “of Scotland in the days of Alexander III.,”\r\nthe hero of the romance is, at one stage of his adventures in Cornwall,\r\nrepresented as assuming for disguise and concealment the appearance of a\r\nleper or mesel.[357] In this character the poet provides him with the\r\nusual cop and clapper (stanza 80, p. 181).\r\n\r\n  Ganhardin gan fare,\r\n    Into Bretaine away;\r\n  And Tristrem duelled thare,\r\n    To wite what men wald say;\r\n  Coppe and Claper he bare,\r\n    Til the fiften day,\r\n  As he a mesel ware:\r\n    Under walles he lay,\r\n              To lithe.\r\n\r\nWe have already, in the Second Part of the present paper, seen\r\nHenryson, in the sixteenth century, describing his leper heroine as\r\narrayed\r\n\r\n  With cop and clapper like ane Lazarous.\r\n\r\nAnd from the advice proffered by the other lepers to the weeping\r\nCresseid after she is actually removed to the lazar-house, the\r\nimportance and frequent use of the clapper is sufficiently shown—\r\n\r\n  I counsall thee mak vertew of ane neid,\r\n  To leir to clap thy clapper to and fro,\r\n  And leir efter the law of lipper leid.[358]\r\n\r\nInto some towns the lepers seem to have been allowed the liberty of\r\nentry, provided they used their clappers, to advertise the passing\r\ninhabitants of their presence, and thus allowed them to shun the\r\nsupposed danger of their contact. The magistrates of Glasgow made the\r\ncarrying of clappers one of the conditions on which they admitted the\r\noccasional entrance of the inmates of the Brigend hospital into their\r\ncity, one of their edicts for October 1610 running thus:—“It is statut\r\nand ordanit that the Lipper of the hospital sall gang (walk) only on the\r\ncalsie (street) syde near the gutter, and sall haif clapperis and ane\r\nclaith upoun their mouth and face, and sall stand afar of quhill they\r\nresaif almous, or answer under the payne of banischeing them from the\r\ntoun and hospital.”\r\n\r\nOne of the statutes of the Greenside hospital, Edinburgh, was to the\r\neffect—\r\n\r\n“That nane of the lepperis cry or ask for alms, utherways then be thair\r\nclapper; and that every ane of thame, his day about, sitt at the dore of\r\nthe said hospitall to that effect, the rest allwayes remaining within\r\nthe samyn, and that thay distribute equallie amongs thame quhatsoever\r\nmoney they purches be thair said begging, and gif the just declaration\r\nthairof to the visitour appoynted everie Setterday, under sic payne as\r\nthe counsill shall injoyne unto thame.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPERS REGARDED AS DEAD PERSONS BY THE CIVIL LAW.\r\n\r\nAccording to the tenor of various old civil codes and local enactments,\r\nwhen a person became affected with leprosy he was looked upon as legally\r\nand politically dead, and lost the privileges belonging to his right of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nBy the law of England lepers were classed with idiots, madmen, outlaws,\r\netc., as incapable of being heirs; and a leper removed by a writ _de\r\nleproso amovendo_ could not be a guardian in socage.[359]\r\n\r\nRotharis, king of Lombardy, as early as the eleventh century, decreed\r\nthat when any one became affected with leprosy, and the fact was known\r\nto the judge or people, so that the leper was expelled from society and\r\ndwelt in seclusion, he had no power to alienate his effects or dispose\r\nof them to any one (_non sit illi licentia res suas alienare aut\r\nthingare cuilibet personæ_). For, it is added, from the very day on\r\nwhich he is expelled from his home, he is to be regarded as dead\r\n(_tanquam mortuus habetur_).[360] The same was the law of Normandy,\r\naccording to Dufresne[361] and Delamarré;[362] and Lobineau, in his\r\nhistory of Brittany,[363] speaks of it being formerly in accordance with\r\nthe rituals of various churches.\r\n\r\nThe leper was not looked upon in the eye of the law alone as defunct,\r\nfor the Church also took the same view, and performed the solemn\r\nceremonials of the burial of the dead over him on the day on which he\r\nwas separated from his fellow-creatures and consigned to a lazar-house.\r\nHe was from that moment regarded as a man dead amongst the living, and\r\nlegally buried, though still breathing and alive. The ritual of the\r\nFrench church retained till a late period the various forms and\r\nceremonies to which the leper was subjected on this day of his living\r\nfuneral. Ogée[364] and Pluquet[365] have both described them.\r\n\r\nA priest robed with surplice and stole went with the cross to the house\r\nof the doomed leper. The minister of the church began the necessary\r\nceremonies by exhorting him to suffer, with a patient and penitent\r\nspirit, the incurable plague with which God had stricken him. He then\r\nsprinkled the unfortunate leper with holy water, and afterwards\r\nconducted him to the church, the usual burial verses being sung during\r\ntheir march thither. In the church the ordinary habiliments of the leper\r\nwere removed; he was clothed in a funeral pall; and while placed before\r\nthe altar between two trestles, the _Libera_ was sung, and the mass for\r\nthe dead celebrated over him. After this service he was again sprinkled\r\nwith holy water, and led from the church to the house or hospital\r\ndestined for his future abode. A pair of clappers, a barell, a stick,\r\ncowl, and dress, etc. etc., were given to him. Before leaving the leper,\r\nthe priest solemnly interdicted him from appearing in public without his\r\nleper’s garb—from entering inns, churches, mills, and bake-houses—from\r\ntouching children, or giving them ought he had touched—from washing his\r\nhands or anything pertaining to him in the common fountains and\r\nstreams—from touching in the markets the goods he wished to buy with\r\nanything except his stick—from eating or drinking with any others than\r\nlepers;—and he specially forbade him from walking in narrow paths, or\r\nfrom answering those who spoke to him in the roads and streets, unless\r\nin a whisper, that they might not be annoyed with his pestilent breath\r\nand with the infectious odour which exhaled from his body;—and last of\r\nall, before taking his departure, and leaving the leper for ever to the\r\nseclusion of the lazar-house, the official of the church terminated the\r\nceremony of his separation from his living fellow-creatures by throwing\r\nupon the body of the poor outcast a shovelful of earth, in imitation of\r\nthe closure of the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF LEPER HOSPITALS IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nIn Part I. I enumerated specially the different Scottish leper hospitals\r\nwith which I was acquainted, and referred in general terms to the number\r\nof similar institutions that had existed in England. Under the idea that\r\na connected view of all the British leper hospitals might prove\r\ninteresting, I have drawn out the following alphabetical list of such of\r\nthem as have come to my knowledge in the course of the preceding\r\ninquiries. To the locality of each hospital and its special designation,\r\nor rather dedication, I have added the dates, as nearly as they could be\r\nascertained, either of its original foundation, or of the first notice\r\nof it to be found in historical records. Among the unarranged mass of\r\nmaterials contained in the _Notitia Monastica_, and in the _Monasticon\r\nAnglicanum_, (to which works I am principally indebted for the notes of\r\nthe English leper houses), references exist to many old hospitals, the\r\nindividual objects of which are now utterly forgotten and unknown. If\r\nsufficient records of them had been preserved we would probably have\r\nbeen enabled to increase to a much greater extent the subjoined list of\r\ninstitutions for lepers, as many of them, there is little doubt, were\r\nset aside (like those we now enumerate) for the reception of the victims\r\nof that disease, whose olden history, in as far as relates to this\r\ncountry, we have so hastily and imperfectly attempted to trace.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF LEPER HOSPITALS FORMERLY EXISTING IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+\r\n  |

GLASGOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James Simpson’s Paper, Part I. p. 10.—“In 1350, in the reign of\r\nDavid II., the Lady of Lochow, daughter of Robert, Duke of Albany,\r\nerected a leper hospital at the Gorbals of Glasgow, near the old\r\nbridge.—(Gibson’s _Hist. of Glasg._ p. 52; Cleland’s _Glasg._ vol. i.\r\np. 68.)”\r\n\r\nThere is some mistake here. If the leper hospital was founded by the\r\nLady of Lochow, daughter of the Duke of Albany, it must have been a\r\nhundred years after 1350. The dukedom of Albany was not created until\r\n1378, and the first daughter of that house who married a Knight of\r\nLochow was Marjory, the wife of Sir Duncan Campbell, who died in 1453.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record notice of the hospital which I have observed is in\r\n1494, when William Steward, prebendary of Killern and rector of\r\nGlassfurd, endowed a chaplain to serve in the chapel of St. Ninian,\r\nwhich he had lately built, “_ad Hospitale Leprosorum degentium prope\r\nPontem Glasguensem_.” He provided that yearly, on the anniversary of his\r\ndeath, twenty-four poor scholars should assemble in the chapel of the\r\nhospital to perform certain services, for which one penny was to be paid\r\nto each of them, along with one shilling to the lepers—“et leprosis non\r\nsociatis degentibus in dicto Hospitali xijd.” The lepers were to ring\r\nthe chapel bell for the _Salve Regina_ every night, and to pray in the\r\nchapel for their benefactors.—(_Regist. Episcopal. Glasg._, vol. ii.\r\npp. 488-490. Edinb. 1843, Mait. Club.) In 1505 we have “pauperibus\r\nleprosis in Leprosario Sancti Niniani trans pontem Glasguensem\r\ndegentibus.”—(_Liber Collegii Nostre Domine Glasguensis_, p. 259.\r\nGlasg. 1846, Maitland Club.) In 1528, James Houston, sub-dean of\r\nGlasgow, founder of the Lady College (now the Tron Kirk) of Glasgow,\r\nordered twelve pennies to be distributed yearly, on the anniversary of\r\nhis death, to the lepers beside the Bridge of Glasgow, and others, who\r\nshould appear in the churchyard of the Lady College to say orisons for\r\nhis soul—“_leprosis extraneis et commorantibus juxta Pontem Glasguensem\r\ncomparentibus in cimiterio prefecto Ecclesie Collegiate oraturis\r\nDeum_.”—(_Lib. Coll. Nostre Domine Glasguensis_, p. 51.) The Tron Kirk\r\nor Ladye College was on the north side of the Clyde, and within the\r\nburgh of Glasgow, so that we have here proof that lepers in 1528 were\r\nnot forbidden to enter the burgh. Contrast this feeling towards them\r\nwith the feeling shown in the Leges Burgorum and Statuta Gilde of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries, printed in the _Acta Parliamentorum\r\nScotiæ_, vol. i., and with the banishment of all lepers from Glasgow in\r\n1593 and 1594, as instructed by the Kirk-Session Records, abridged in\r\nWodrow’s _Biograph. Collect._, vol. ii. part ii. p. 41.\r\n\r\nDid this difference of toleration arise from some corresponding\r\ndifference in the intensity or general diffusion of the disease?\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPER HOSPITAL AT STIRLING.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a leper-house at Stirling is proved by entries in the\r\nRotuli Scaccarii Regum Scotorum, MS. in the General Register House.\r\n\r\n  1463-4. “Et leprosis prope burgum de Striuelin ex elimosina Domini\r\n            Regis percepientibus annuatim octo bollas farine—viij bolle\r\n            farine.”\r\n\r\n          Rot.

Scacc., No. 347.\r\n\r\nObserve how literally the situation of the leper-house, as described in\r\nthe language of record “_ad finem burgi_,” answers to Henryson’s\r\nphrase—“yone hospitall _at the tounis end_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPER HOSPITAL OF ABERDEEN.\r\n\r\nThe leper hospital of Aberdeen was in existence before 1363. A charter\r\nof that year describes certain lands as bounded by the king’s highway\r\nleading from the burgh of Aberdeen _versus domos Leprosorum_; and again\r\n_a domibus dictorum Leprosorum_.—(_Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 283.)\r\n\r\nThe use of the plural _domos_ and _domibus_ may possibly denote that\r\nthere were two hospitals, as at Canterbury and elsewhere—one for men\r\nand one for women.\r\n\r\nThe Regent and the Privy Council interposed for the repair or\r\nrestoration of the leper hospital of Aberdeen in 1574; in 1578 it was\r\nplaced under the charge of a master; and in 1591 there were patients in\r\nit.—(_Selections from Ecclesiastical Records of Aberdeen_, pp. 20, 23.\r\nAberd. 1846, Spald. Club.—_Extracts from the Burgh Records of\r\nAberdeen_, 1570-1625, pp. 70, 71. Aberd. 1848, Spald. Club. _Book of Bon\r\nAccord_, p. 342.) There would seem to have been an outbreak of leprosy\r\nin Scotland about this time. It was in 1584 that the Magistrates of\r\nEdinburgh issued orders for finding a commodious place for a\r\nleper-house; in 1589 a leper-house was ordered to be built; and in 1591\r\nthere were five patients in it. (Sir James Simpson’s Paper, Part I. p.\r\n11.) So also in Glasgow, in 1586 the Kirk-Session of Glasgow gave orders\r\nthat “the Lepper Folk’s House or Spittal beyond the Bridge” should be\r\nvisited, “to see how the same should be reformed.” These orders were\r\nrenewed in 1587; in 1588 “the yard of the Lepper House” was built; and\r\nin 1589 six lepers are found in the Hospital. (Wodrow’s _Biographical\r\nCollections_, vol. ii. part ii. pp. 40, 41. Sir James Simpson’s Paper,\r\nPart I. p. 10.) In 1593, “the Lepper House [of Glasgow] was charged to\r\nreceive none but townsfolks, and all Leppers were banished the town;”\r\nand in 1594 the Kirk-Session “beseeches the magistrates to put all\r\nLeppers out of toun, for fear of infection.”—(Wodrow’s _Biographical\r\nCollections_, vol. ii. part ii. pp. 40, 41.)\r\n\r\nIf there were really a new access of leprosy in Scotland about\r\n1580-1590, the disease seems speedily to have abated, at least in\r\nAberdeen. In 1604, when a female leper applied for admission, “the Keys\r\nof the Hospital” were given to her, showing that the place was then\r\nempty and locked up.—(_Selections from the Ecclesiastical Records of\r\nAberdeen_, p. 34.) In May 1610 it was ordered that two merks should be\r\ngiven by the Kirk-Session “to the Lepper woman laitlie put in the Lepper\r\nHous, becaus she will not gett any of the rent of the said Hous till\r\nMartenes next;” denoting, apparently, that there was but one leper in\r\nthe hospital at this time.—(_Selections from the Ecclesiastical Records\r\nof Aberdeen_, pp. 73, 74.) In 1612, a female leper, “being expellit\r\nfurth of this toun, as ane not meit to dwell within the same,” is\r\nallowed to take up her abode in the leper-house, although “sche be not\r\nborne and bred within this burght.”—(_Extracts from the Burgh Records\r\nof Aberdeen_, vol. ii. (1570-1625), p. 308.) I do not observe record of\r\nany later patient. Fifty years afterwards, in 1661, both the leper\r\nhospital and its chapel (erected in 1519) were ruined if not razed to\r\nthe ground, “and scarcelie is the name knowne to many.”—(Gordon’s\r\n_Description of Bothe Touns of Aberdeene_, pp. 18, 19. Aberd. 1842,\r\nSpald. Club.)\r\n\r\nMr. Albert Way, in the _Promptorium Parvulorum_, p. 298,\r\nsays—“Heutzner, who visited England during the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nspeaks of the English as very subject to the disease of leprosy.” I have\r\nnot Heutzner’s book at hand, but it might be looked at to see if he\r\nspeaks of leprosy being prevalent in England so late as the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPER HOUSE OF RATHVEN.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first charter now extant of the leper-house at Rothfan\r\n(now Rathven) in the Enzie, was between the years 1224 and 1226, as can\r\nbe shown from the list of witnesses who attest it. It may be remarked\r\nthat the founder, John Bisset, is believed to have been a kinsman of\r\nthat Manaser Bisset, sewer to King Henry II. of England, who founded the\r\nleper hospital of Mayden Bradley in Wilts, and whose wife Alice, an\r\nheiress, is said to have been herself a leper.—(_Monasticon\r\nAnglicanum_, vol. vi. part ii. p. 643, edit. ult.)\r\n\r\nThe hospital of Rathven still exists, but has long ceased to be occupied\r\nby lepers. Its tenants, in 1563, were simply “beidmen,” and their number\r\nhad been reduced from seven to six. They had 42 marks for their ordinary\r\ncharges, and £7 : 4s. for their habits. At the end of the last century\r\nevery bedeman had half-an-acre of land for life, one boll of oatmeal\r\nyearly, and 9s. 6d. also yearly. At that time none of the bedemen lived\r\nin the hospital. But it was repaired not many years ago, and when the\r\n_New Statistical Account of Scotland_ was published, two of the six\r\nbedemen resided in the hospital. It stands in the village of Rathven, in\r\nthe district of the Enzie, and the shire of Banff.—(_Antiquities of the\r\nShires of Aberdeen and Banff_, vol. ii. pp. 142-145. Aberd. 1847, Spald.\r\nClub.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS OF ST. LAZARUS IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nIn 1296, Friar William Corbet, master of the house of St. Lazarus of\r\nHarop (Frater Willelmus Corbet, magister domus Sancti Lazari de Harop),\r\nhad letters for the restitution of his lands, directed to the Sheriff of\r\nEdinburgh (a sheriffdom which then included both Haddingtonshire and\r\nLinlithgowshire), from King Edward I. of England, as overlord of\r\nScotland.—(_Rotuli Scotiæ_, vol. i. p. 25. London, 1814.)\r\n\r\nIn 1376, King Robert II. granted a charter to his eldest son, John, Earl\r\nof Carrick, Steward of Scotland, of the lands of Prestisfelde, St.\r\nGiles’ Grange, and Spetelton, in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh, then in\r\nthe King’s possession by reason of the forfeiture of the Friars of\r\nHarehope, abiding at the faith and peace of the King and kingdom of\r\nEngland, contrary to the faith and peace of the King and kingdom of the\r\nScots, (racione forisfacture Fratrum de Harehope ad fidem et pacem Regis\r\net regni Anglie, ac contra fidem et pacem nostras existencium). The\r\ngrant was to lapse when the Friars of Harehope became reconciled to the\r\nfaith and peace of the King and kingdom of the Scots.—(_Registrum Magni\r\nSigilli Regum Scotorum_, p. 132. Edin. 1814.)\r\n\r\nThese notices do not enable us to fix the position of Harop or Harehope,\r\nshowing only that it had lands near Edinburgh. The only other notice of\r\nthe house which I have observed rather perplexes the question than\r\notherwise. It occurs in the history of the deprivation of English\r\npriests of their Scotch benefices, given by Fordun (_Scotichronicon_,\r\nlib. xi. cap. xxi.), and, with some variations, in a memorial of a\r\nScotch monk claiming the Priory of Coldingham, about 1422, printed in\r\nthe _Priory of Coldingham_, pp. 246-258. Lond. 1841, Surtees Soc. It is\r\nhere said that Harehope, or Holme, was founded by King David, the son of\r\nSt. Margaret; that certain lands in Lothian were annexed to it, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh, namely Spitalton and St. Giles’ Grange; that\r\nthe monks (_monachi_) and laymen of the house, being Englishmen,\r\nconspired against the realm of Scotland; that King David therefore\r\ndeclared their lands forfeited, and bestowed them on Walter of Wardlaw,\r\nBishop of Glasgow, for his life; that after Bishop Wardlaw’s death the\r\nlands were given to his kinsman the Laird of Ricarton, by whose heirs\r\nthey were possessed at the time this record was written. The memorial\r\nprinted in the _Priory of Coldingham_ expressly quotes the Ricarton\r\ncharters—“Ut patet in cartis dicti domini de Ricarton exinde\r\nconfectis.” If these be still extant, they may remove the doubts which\r\nmeanwhile may attach to the question whether the “Harehope or Holme” of\r\nFordun and the Scotch Prior of Coldingham be certainly the same with the\r\n“Harehop” of the _Rotuli Scotiæ_ in 1296, and the charter of King Robert\r\nII. in 1376. The possessors of the latter are described as Friars\r\n(_fratres_), of the former as monks (_monachi_)—an all-important\r\ndistinction in that age, and not at all likely to be overlooked. Then,\r\nagain, Fordun and the Scotch Prior of Coldingham say nothing of the\r\ngrant of the possessions of Harehope to the Earl of Carrick,—if,\r\nindeed, they do not relate grants of these possessions incompatible with\r\nthe charter of King Robert II. in 1376. On the other hand, we have, both\r\nin that charter and the notices of Fordun and the Scotch Prior of\r\nColdingham, mention of the same lands of Spitaltoun and St. Giles’\r\nGrange as the possessions of Harehope.\r\n\r\nThe Spitaltoun here referred to may perhaps be identified with the\r\n“Spittle toun” of Upper Liberton, near Edinburgh. At the same time there\r\nis a Spitaltoun in the lands of Warristoun, near Ricarton.\r\n\r\nIn Spottiswood’s _Account of the Religious Houses in Scotland_, it is\r\nsaid that the hospital of St. Mary Magdalene, near Linlithgow, “was\r\nformerly governed by the Lazarites.”—(Bp. Keith’s _Catal. of Scotch\r\nBishops_, p. 477, edit. 1824.) It is added that the hospital at Lanark\r\n“belonged likewise to this sect.” It does not necessarily follow from\r\nthe words of the charter in the _Registrum de Neubotle_ (p. 149) that\r\nthe Friars of St. Lazarus, there spoken of, had their Hospital in\r\nLinlithgow. The words are,—“Unam particam terre cum crofto de quarta\r\nparte illius tofti quod tenui de Fratribus de Sancto Lazaro in villa de\r\nLynlitgu in burgagis scilicet illum particum terre que iacet ex\r\norientali parte illius tofti.” The object here seems to be rather to\r\nindicate the position of the piece of land as being in Linlithgow than\r\nto describe the Friars of St. Lazarus as being located there.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOWMENTS OF SCOTCH LEPER HOSPITALS, Part I. p. 31.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow._—In 1593 the rental of the leper-house of Glasgow was £7 :\r\n15s. in money, and 18 bolls of meal.—Wodrow’s _Biographical\r\nCollections_, vol. ii. part ii. p. 40; Glasg. 1848, Mait. Club.\r\n\r\n_Rothfan or Rathven._—In 1563 the money rent of the hospital of Rathven\r\nseems to have been £35 : 4s. In 1798 the hospital had 3 acres of land, 6\r\nbolls of oatmeal, and £3 : 15s. of money rent.—_Antiquities of the\r\nShires of Aberdeen and Banff_, vol. ii. pp. 143-145; Aberd. 1847, Spald.\r\nClub.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF INMATES IN LEPER HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nA passage in the will of “old John of Gaunt, time-honour’d Lancaster,”\r\nin 1398, seems to support the opinion expressed at p. 18, that the leper\r\nhospitals in general did not contain many patients.—“Item, jeo devise a\r\nchescun maison de lepres deinz v. lieues entour Londres charges de v.\r\nmalades, v. nobles en l’onur des v. plaies principalx de Nostre\r\nSeigneur, et a ceux qi sont meyns charges, trois nobles en l’onur de la\r\nBenoit Trinite.”—(_Testamenta Eboracensia_, vol. i. p. 227; Lond. 1836.\r\nSurtees Soc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDATES OF THE APPEARANCE OF LEPROSY IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n_Ireland._—Ireland is excluded from consideration, else proof of the\r\nexistence of leprosy in that island in the end of the seventh century\r\nmight be adduced. St. Finan, a native of Munster, who died between 675\r\nand 695, “was surnamed Lobhar, or the Leper, from his having been\r\nafflicted for thirty years of his life with some cutaneous\r\ndisorder.”—(Dr. Lanigan’s _Ecclesiastical History of Ireland_, vol.\r\niii. pp. 83-88; Dublin, 1822.)\r\n\r\n_England._—As to England, says Mr. Albert Way, “it has been affirmed\r\nthat leprosy was brought into Europe by the Crusaders; in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon vocabulary, however, which has been attributed to Aelfric,\r\noccurs the word ‘LEPROSUS = hreofliz, oððe, licðrowera,’ Jul. A, II. f.\r\n123.”—(_Promptorium Parvulorum_, vol. i. p. 297; Lond. 1843. Camden\r\nSoc.)\r\n\r\nTo the instances given by Sir James Simpson, Part I., p. 39, of the\r\noccurrence of leprosy in England before the first Crusade, may be added\r\nthe case of a noble Englishman of the south of England—_nobili viro sed\r\nleproso_—miraculously cured at the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham, as\r\nrelated by Reginald of Durham from the recital of a fellow-monk,\r\nTurold—“qui se hæc audisse a veteranis canonicis asseruit, in quorum\r\npresentia et aspectu hoc gestum fuit.” The canons here spoken of were\r\nejected from Durham in 1083—thirteen years before the first Crusade.\r\nReginald of Durham wrote before 1195. He speaks of the disease\r\nthus:—“Accidit ut lepræ morbum passim eam enutriendo incurreret, ita\r\nut, modico interposito tempore, tota vultus illius superficies\r\nhorribilis videntibus appareret. Suis etiam quandoque, sanie ulcerum\r\ndifluente, factus est evitabilis; et in consortii communione nonnullis\r\neffectus intolerabilis.” Yet, when he journeyed from the south of\r\nEngland to the tomb of St. Cuthbert he was “nobilibus juvenum\r\nministrantium, amicorum et parentum, constipatus\r\nagminibus.”—(_Reginaldi Dunelmensis Libbellus de Beati Cuthberti\r\nVirtutibus_, cap. xix. pp. 37-41; Lond. 1835. Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\nThe disease was probably not unknown among the Anglo-Saxons, yet the\r\nsilence of their laws (the word Leper is not to be found in the index to\r\nThorpe’s Collection) with regard to it, contrasts strongly with the\r\nfrequent enactments for its prevention in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies both in England and Scotland, and (if we allow the Welsh laws\r\nthe antiquity which is claimed for them) in the tenth and eleventh\r\ncenturies in Wales. May not the anomaly be explained by supposing that\r\nthe disease broke out with new severity about the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth century?\r\n\r\n_Scotland._—No trace of leprosy is to be found in Adamnan’s Life of St.\r\nColumba, written in the seventh century. But of one of St. Columba’s\r\ncontemporaries—St. Kentigern of Glasgow, who died about 600—it is\r\nrelated that in that city he cleansed lepers—“mundabat leprosos.” These\r\nare the words of his biographer, Joceline of Furnes, who wrote towards\r\nthe end of the twelfth century.—(_Vit. S. Kentigerni_, cap. xxxiv.;\r\nPinkert. _Vit. Antiq. Sanct. Scotiæ_, p. 270.) The same biographer\r\nrelates that at St. Kentigern’s tomb in Glasgow lepers were\r\ncured—“leprosis cutis munditia restituitur.”—(_Vit. S. Kentigerni_,\r\ncap. xliv.; Pinkert. _Vit. Antiq. SS. Scot._, p. 295.)\r\n\r\nSo also it is related of St. Boniface of Rosemarky, who appears to have\r\nflourished in the beginning of the eighth century, that he cleansed\r\nlepers—“leprosos mundabat.” These are the words of the Breviary of\r\nAberdeen (Proprium Sanctorum pro tempore hyemali, fol. lxx.), printed in\r\n1510, but quoting and using older materials.\r\n\r\nSt. Aelred of Rievaux, who died in 1166, relates that lepers were\r\ncleansed at the tomb of St. Ninian at Whithern in Galloway—“ad ejus\r\nnamque sacratissimum tumulum curantur infirmi, mundantur\r\nleprosi.”—(_Vit. S. Ninian_, cap. xi.) He mentions specially two\r\ncases:—\r\n\r\n   “Visi sunt præterea venire in civitatem viri duo leprosi. Qui\r\n   præsumptuosum æstimantes cum lepræ contagio scabiem tangere,\r\n   quasi delonge poscunt auxilium. Accedentes autem ad fontem, et\r\n   sanctum arbitrantes quidquid sanctus contigerat Ninianus,\r\n   lavacio illo se abluendos putarunt.... Mundantur leprosi tactu\r\n   lavacio, sed meritis Niniani.”—(_Vit. S. Niniani_, cap. xi. §\r\n   4; Pinkert. _Vit. Antiq. SS. Scot._, pp. 22, 23.)\r\n\r\nAll these writers—St. Aelred of Rievaux, Joceline of Furnes, and the\r\ncompiler of the Aberdeen Breviary—wrote so long after the Saints whose\r\nmiracles they commemorate, that their testimony cannot avail as proof in\r\nitself of the existence of leprosy in Scotland in the seventh and eighth\r\ncenturies. Besides, they speak only in general terms—“leprosos\r\nmundabat,”—which may be little or nothing more than a rhetorical\r\nflourish. But the passages which have been quoted are at least\r\nsufficient to demonstrate that in the twelfth century the existence of\r\nleprosy in Scotland from a remote age was a matter of unquestioned\r\nbelief. Of the general prevalence of the disease on this side of the\r\nTweed in that and the subsequent age, there is abundant evidence\r\nelsewhere in the Leges Burgorum and other ancient capitularies of Scotch\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe canon of the Scotch Church, “De monitionem faciendo leprosis,”\r\nprinted in the Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. ii. p. 32, and\r\nelsewhere, belongs to the thirteenth century, probably to the latter\r\npart of that century. If, as seems to be the case, it be merely a\r\ndiocesan statute, and not a statute for the whole of Scotland, it will\r\nonly show more forcibly the general prevalence of the disease. The\r\ndiocese for which it was enacted was apparently Aberdeen, containing at\r\nthat time about eighty parishes, and the number of lepers must have been\r\ngreat before it could be found necessary to guard against the injury\r\ndone to the parochial clergy by the withdrawal of the dues and oblations\r\nof the inmates of the leper hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPROSY IN WALES.\r\n\r\nThe Venedotian Code (the Laws of the Women)—\r\n\r\n   “Should her husband be leprous, or have fetid breath, or be\r\n   incapable of marital duties; if on account of one of these\r\n   three things she leave her husband, she is to have the whole\r\n   of her property.”—(_Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p.\r\n   39. Lond. 1841.)\r\n\r\nThe Dimetian Code (of Women)—\r\n\r\n   “For three causes, if a woman desert her husband, she is not\r\n   to lose her agweddi [dowry]; for leprosy, want of connection,\r\n   and bad breath.”—(_Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p.\r\n   255.)\r\n\r\nThe Laws of Howel Dda, according to the Gwentian Code (of Women)—\r\n\r\n   “For three causes a woman loses not her agweddi, although she\r\n   may leave her husband; to wit, on account of leprosy, bad\r\n   breath, and default of connection.”—(_Ancient Laws and\r\n   Institutes of Wales_, p. 365.)\r\n\r\nThese citations are from Aneurin Owen’s translation of the Welsh text of\r\nthe Welsh laws, published in parallel columns with the Welsh text by the\r\nRecord Commissioners. These laws are of uncertain date; they are\r\ncommonly attributed to Howel Dda, but bear interpolations or alterations\r\nof much later date. The oldest MSS. of them are of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nI add the passages regarding lepers which occur in the Latin versions of\r\nthe Welsh Laws, the oldest MSS. of which are of the thirteenth\r\ncentury:—\r\n\r\n   “Tribus de causis potest femina habere suum egwedy [suam\r\n   dotem], licet ipsa uirum relinquat; scilicet, si sit leprosus\r\n   uir; et si habeat fetidum anhelatum; et si cum ea concumbere\r\n   non possit.”—(_Liber Legum Howel Da_, lib. ii. cap. xx., sec.\r\n   xxxi. _Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p. 796; Lond.\r\n   1841.)\r\n\r\n   “Tribus de causis habebat femina suum aguedi [suam dotem],\r\n   licet ipsa virum suum relinquat; id est, si leprosus sit vir;\r\n   et si fetidum hanelitum habueret; et si cum ea coire non\r\n   possit.”—(_Liber Legum Howel Da_, lib. ii. cap. xxiii. sec.\r\n   xiii. _Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p. 827.)\r\n\r\n   “Leprosi cum seculum dimittunt ebedyw [_i.e._ heriot _seu_ caulp]\r\n   dare debent dominis suis.”—(_Liber Legum Howel Da_, lib. ii.\r\n   cap. xxii. sec. ix. _Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_,\r\n   p. 797.)\r\n\r\nThe Dimetian Code (of Murder)—\r\n\r\n   “If there be a relative of the murderer, or of the murdered,\r\n   who is an ecclesiastic in holy orders, or in an ecclesiastical\r\n   community, or leprous, or dumb, or an idiot, such neither pays\r\n   nor receives any part of galanas” [assythment, or fines for\r\n   murder].—(_Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p. 200.)\r\n\r\nThe Dimetian Code (Triads)—\r\n\r\n   “There are three persons, no one of whom, by law, can be a qualified\r\n   judge; one of them is, a person having a defect, as one who is deaf, or\r\n   blind, or leprous, or an insane person,” etc. etc.—(_Ancient Laws and\r\n   Institutes of Wales_, p. 200.)\r\n\r\nThe next class of passages is taken from what are called the “Anomalous\r\nWelsh Laws,” which, in the state they are now found in, are supposed to\r\nbe of the sixteenth century:—\r\n\r\n   “If a person become a surety, and before the termination of\r\n   the suit he should become leprous, or a monk, or blind, ....\r\n   he must fulfil his promise while he lives.”—(_Ancient Laws\r\n   and Institutes of Wales_, p. 403.)\r\n\r\n   “There is to be no objection to a pleader, but for having\r\n   violated his religious profession, and quitting the world, or\r\n   his becoming a separated leper.”—(_Ancient Laws and\r\n   Institutes of Wales_, p. 516.)\r\n\r\n   “Three sons who are not to have patrimony—The son of a\r\n   priest, the son of a leper, and the son of a man who had paid\r\n   his patrimony as blood land. The son of a leper is not to have\r\n   it, because God has separated him from worldly kin—that is,\r\n   such son as a leper may have after being adjudged to a\r\n   lazar-house; and a son a priest shall have after taking\r\n   priestly orders; and the third has no patrimony, as his\r\n   father, prior to him, had determined it by law.”—(_Ancient\r\n   Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p. 556. See also p. 603.)\r\n\r\n   “Three persons to whom saraad [fine for insult] is not due—A\r\n   leper, a natural fool, and an alltud [an alien serf] who is\r\n   not married to an innate Cymraes: And, nevertheless, there is\r\n   worth in law attached to each of them, and whoever shall\r\n   ill-use them and injure them in person and property is subject\r\n   to a dirwy [fine or punishment].—(_Ancient Laws and\r\n   Institutes of Wales_, p. 656.)\r\n\r\n   “Three persons who are not to be invested with the judicial\r\n   function—An inefficient person, as one that is deaf, or\r\n   blind, or maimed, or leprous, or insane, or mute,” etc.\r\n   etc.—(_Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales_, p. 671.)\r\n\r\n   “A leper cannot be a pleader.”—(_Ancient Laws and Institutes\r\n   of Wales_, p. 764.)\r\n\r\nThe Welsh term for leper is _Clafwr_, obviously an adaptation of the\r\nLatin word.\r\n\r\nIt should be kept in view that the license which the Welsh laws give to\r\nthe wife to leave a leprous husband is in direct contradiction to the\r\ncanon law as declared by Pope Alexander III. to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury in 1180:—“Mandamus quatenus si qui sunt in provincia tua\r\nviri vel mulieres qui lepræ morbum incurrunt, ut uxores viros et viri\r\nuxores sequantur, et eis conjugali affectione ministrent, sollicitis\r\nexhortationibus inducere non postponas. Si vero ad hoc induci non\r\npoterunt, eis arctius injungas ut uterque altero vivente continentiam\r\nservet. Quodsi mandatum tuum servare contempserint, vinculo\r\nexcommunicationis adstringas.”—(_Corpus Juris Canonici_, vol. ii. col.\r\n656. Edit. 1747.)\r\n\r\nThe same Pope, in the same year, decreed that lepers might\r\nmarry:—“Leprosi autem si continere nolunt, et aliquam quæ sibi nubere\r\nvelit invenerint, liberum est eis ad matrimonium convolare.” He settled\r\nanother and more delicate point:—“Quodsi virum sive uxorem divino\r\njudicio leprosum fieri contigerit, et infirmus a sano carnale debitum\r\nexigat, generali præcepto Apostoli, quod exigitur est solvendum: cui\r\npræcepto nulla in hoc casu exceptio invenitur.”—(_Corpus Juris\r\nCanonici_, vol. ii. col. 656. Edit. 1747.)\r\n\r\nPope Urban III. found, in 1186, that subsequent leprosy was a sufficient\r\nreason why betrothed persons should not be compelled to marry.—(_Corpus\r\nJuris Canonici_, vol. ii. col. 657. Edit. 1747. See also col. 344.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE OF THE DISEASE.—The terms “Leprosi” and “Elephantuosi.”\r\n\r\nThe “MS. History of the Durham Cathedral and Diocese,” referred to in\r\nSir James Simpson’s Paper, Part II. p. 77, was printed in Wharton’s\r\n_Anglia Sacra_ in 1691, and more perfectly in the _Historiæ Dunelmensis\r\nScriptores Tres_, by the Surtees Society in 1839. The passage quoted\r\nstands thus (pp. 11, 12):—\r\n\r\n   “Præterea Hospitale de Schyreburne construxit, et elefantiosos\r\n   in episcopatu suo circumquaque collectos, ibidem instituit,\r\n   aptisque eorum usibus habitaculis ampliant; et ne quid\r\n   sollicitudini caritatis deesset, ad eorum perpetuam\r\n   sustentationem et nonnullorum susceptionem terras et ecclesias\r\n   concessit et confirmavit. In geminum creditur esse bonum, quod\r\n   et pauperum necessitatibus liberrime prospexit, et societatem\r\n   immundorum a cohabitacione mundorum segregavit.”\r\n\r\n“Elephantuosi” is here put as equivalent to “Leprosi.” In the Chronicle\r\nof Battle Abbey, written about 1180-1200, some slight distinction seems\r\nto be implied between the words. The writer is speaking of the Abbot\r\nWalter, who died in 1171:—\r\n\r\n   “Leprosorum maxime et elephantiosorum ab hominibus ejectioni\r\n   compatiens, eos non solum non abhorrebat, verumetiam in\r\n   persona propria eis frequenter ministrans, eorum manus\r\n   pedesque abluendo fovebat, et intimo caritatis pietatisque\r\n   affectu blanda oscula imprimebat.”—(_Chronicon Monasterii de\r\n   Bello_, p. 135; Lond. 1846. Anglia Christiana.)\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the two terms may here be used merely rhetorically.\r\nThere are other instances of such a tautology. Ducange (t. iii. coll.\r\n49, 50), quotes _Elephantiæ lepra_ and “Leprosi enim vere atque\r\nElephantia debent habere.” At the same time he cites from an old\r\nLatin-French Glossary, “ELEPHANCIA = une maniere de mesclerie.” In the\r\nsame way some writers distinguish between _mesellerie_ and _cordrerie_.\r\nOn the other hand, the _Catholicon Anglicum_, an Anglo-Latin Dictionary\r\nof the year 1483, has “A LEPYR = lepra, elefancia,\r\nmissella.”—(_Promptorium Parvulorum_, vol. i. pp. 297, 298. Lond. 1843.\r\nCamden Soc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF A LEPER.\r\n\r\nReginald of Durham (sometimes also called Reginald of Coldingham), a\r\nBenedictine monk, who wrote before 1195, gives the following\r\ndescription of a leper girl who had been for three years in the\r\nhospital at Budele, near Darlington, in the bishopric of Durham:—\r\n\r\n   “Nempe omnem facierum illius superficiem laceræ putredinis\r\n   cicatrix nunquam sana totam obduxerat, et falliculis [_l._\r\n   folliculis] crudæ carnis sparsim patentibus et hiulco meatu\r\n   saniem venenoso meatu rimantibus, horridam cunctis visu\r\n   reddiderat. Labiorumque ipsius extrema circumquaque marcentia\r\n   diriguerant, quia particulares quasdam ejus regiones usque ad\r\n   profunda quædam dimensionum dispendia vis sæva diutini\r\n   languoris consumendo exederat. His itaque aliisque illius\r\n   aegritudinus modis corpus ejus dilaceratum periit,”\r\n   etc.—(_Libellus de Vita et Miraculis S. Godrici_, p. 456.\r\n   Lond. 1847. Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\nThe leprosy is cured by a miracle at the tomb of S. Godric at Finchale,\r\nwhen the appearance of the face is thus described:—\r\n\r\n   “tota sana comparuit, omnisque lepræ prioris fœda scabies\r\n   jam recesserat, labiaque illius sana ac tenua, facies vero\r\n   tota incontacta ac clara, velut parvuli cujusdam triennis\r\n   apparebat. Quæ una cum matre sospes domum rediit, quæ illo\r\n   prius tota lepræ pustulis et sanie contracta pervenit.”\r\n\r\nAmong other witnesses to the miraculous cure, Ralph Haget, sheriff of\r\nDurham,\r\n\r\n   “dicebat quod facies ejus cutis licet sana, tenera sit et\r\n   clara, tamen ubi cicatrices ulcerum quondam fuerant illa\r\n   superficies videtur aliquantulum comparere subrufa; labiorum\r\n   vero extrema quæ frustris carneis pinis fuerant valliculata,\r\n   tota sunt plena atque rotunda, sed aliquanto altius\r\n   prominentia.”\r\n\r\nThis was confirmed also by Norman the priest of Hailtune, who got the\r\ngirl into the lepers’ hospital at Badele, near Darlington, and who\r\nsubsequently showed her to his parishioners in his church.—(_Libellus\r\nde Vita et Miraculis S. Godrici_, pp. 457, 458.)\r\n\r\nThe same writer, in the same work, gives other descriptions of leprosy.\r\nA young shepherd of the north of England “lepra percussus cunctis\r\nhorrori fuit.” He is miraculously cured—“tumorque omnis cum deformi\r\nrubore fugatus abscesserat, novaque coloris insoliti superficies in\r\nfacie et toto corpore ipsius relucebat; et nulla omnino pustula vel\r\ncicatricis macula in ipso residendo comparuit.”—(_Lib. de Vit. et\r\nMirac. S. Godrici_, p. 431.)\r\n\r\nA woman—“diutino tempore toto corpore lepræ fuerat contagio maculisque\r\ncum pustulis horrende perfusa ... cunctis horrida et detestenda, nulli\r\npene ad videndum tolerabilis fuerat.”—(_Lib. de Vit. et Mirac. S.\r\nGodrici_, p. 431.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRANK OF THE PERSONS ATTACKED BY LEPROSY.\r\n\r\nIn 1203, a piece of land in Sudton in Kent was in dispute in the King’s\r\ncourt between two kinswomen—Mabel, the daughter of William Fitz Fulke,\r\nand Avicia, the widow of Warine Fitz Fulke. Among other pleas, it was\r\nurged by Avicia, that Mabel had a brother, and that his right to the\r\nland must exclude her claim. Mabel answered that her brother was a\r\nleper—“E contra dicit Mabilla quod leprosus est.” The judgment is not\r\nrecorded; but the notice shows two things—(1) The doctrine of the civil\r\ndeath which followed leprosy; (2) The comparatively good condition of\r\nthe person who in this instance was smitten with leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe case is recorded in the _Placitorum in Domo Capitulari\r\nWestmonesteriensi asservatorum Abbreviatio_, p. 39. Lond. 1811. Record\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nIn 1280 it was certified to King Edward I. that Adam of Gangy, brother\r\nand heir of Ralph of Gangy, deceased, of the county of Northumberland,\r\nholding land of the king in chief, was struck with leprosy (_leperia\r\npercussus_), so that he could not conveniently repair to the king’s\r\npresence to pay his homage to the king (quod ad presenciam Regis ad\r\nhomagium suum Regi faciendum commode accedere non potest). It was\r\ntherefore ordered that Thomas of Normanville, the elder, should in lieu\r\nand turn of the king take the leper’s fealty for his lands.—(_Rotulorum\r\nOriginalium in Curia Scaccarii Abbreviatio_, vol. i. p. 33. Lond. 1805.)\r\n\r\nHere, again, we see leprosy attacking a person of comparatively high\r\nposition. But here the disease neither inferred civil death nor excluded\r\nthe leper from all intercourse with his fellows.\r\n\r\nIn 1313, Nicholas the Leper (Nicholaus le Lepere) and William the Leper\r\n(Willielmus le Lepere) are manucaptors or pledges that John de la Poile,\r\nknight of the shire returned for Surrey, will do his duty in\r\nParliament.—(_Palgrave’s Parliamentary Writs_, vol. ii. pp. 89, 113.)\r\n\r\nHere we have a family of note bearing the name of Leper, derived no\r\ndoubt from the leprosy of an ancestor.\r\n\r\nBefore 1083 a miraculous cure of leprosy is said to have been effected\r\nat the shrine of St. Cuthbert at Durham, on the person of a noble of the\r\nsouth of England—“vir quidam in longinqua Australium Anglorum regione\r\nqui multæ nobilitatis gratia inter comprovintiales preditus erat. Hic\r\ntam corporis sani virtute gaudebat, quam omni prosperitatis affluentia;\r\net divitiarum gloria cæteros excedebat,” etc. etc.—(_Reginaldi\r\nDunelmensis Libellus de Beati Cuthberti Virtutibus_, pp. 37-41. Lond.\r\n1835. Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\nThe same writer, in another work, relates the cure of three lepers at\r\nthe tomb of St. Godric of Finchale. One, a male, was a shepherd; the\r\nother two were women, apparently of the middle or lower\r\nranks.—(_Reginaldi Dunelmensis Libellus de Vita et Miraculis S.\r\nGodrici_, pp. 430, 431, 455-458. Lond. 1845. Surtees Soc.) The shepherd\r\nwas a youth (_juvenis_); one of the women was a girl (_puella_).\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPERS AMONG THE CLERGY.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the prevalence of leprosy among the English\r\nclergy, alluded to at p. 106, Part III., is supplied by the will of\r\nRichard Basy, of Bylburgh, in Yorkshire, in 1393:—“Item lego\r\npresbiteris cæcis vel leprosis seu aliter languentibus, qui non valent\r\ncelebrare circa divinum officium celebrandum, et aliis pauperibus eodem\r\nmodo languentibus et jacentibus, xl. solidos.”—(_Testamenta\r\nEboracensia_, vol. i. p. 192. Lond. 1836. Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\nPope Lucius III. decreed in 1181 that rectors of churches who were\r\nstruck with leprosy should serve their cures by coadjutors; and Pope\r\nClement III., in 1190, ordained that leprous priests should be removed\r\nfrom their priestly office, but should be supported from the fruits of\r\ntheir benefices.—(_Corpus Juris Canonici_, vol. ii. coll. 447-448.\r\nEdit. 1747.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE OF KING ROBERT BRUCE.\r\n\r\nThe silence of Wyntoun, Fordun, and our other early Scotch chroniclers,\r\nas to the disease of which King Robert Bruce died, may not improbably be\r\nexplained by their reluctance to associate the heroic monarch with an\r\nodious and degrading malady. But the King’s metrical biographer names\r\nhis disease, or at least its origin; and it would be interesting to know\r\nif that disease can be identified with leprosy.\r\n\r\n “For a malice him tuk sa sar,\r\n  That he on na wiss mycht be thar.\r\n  This malice off enfundeying\r\n  Begouth; for, through his cald lying,\r\n  Quhen in his gret myscheiff wes he,\r\n  Him fell that hard perplexite.”\r\n\r\n—(Barbour’s _Bruce_, pp. 406-407. Dr. Jamieson’s edit. 1820.)\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Cosmo Innes’ later edition the passage stands thus—\r\n\r\n “For ane male es tuk him sa sar\r\n  That he on na wis mycht be thar.\r\n  His male es of ane fundying\r\n  Begouth, for throu his cald lying,\r\n  Quhen in his gret mischef was he,\r\n  Him fell that hard perplexite.”\r\n\r\n—(Barbour’s _Bruce_, p. 469. Aberd. 1856. Spalding Club.)\r\n\r\nWhat is “enfundeying,” as Dr. Jamieson calls it, or “ane fundying,” as\r\nMr. Innes makes it? Dr. Jamieson glosses it as “perhaps asthma,” but on\r\nwhat ground I do not see. At the same time I am unable to suggest any\r\ninterpretation of the term. Can medical nomenclature supply none?\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUSNESS OF LEPROSY.\r\n\r\nTo the list of persons (Part III. pp. 133, 134) who tended or even\r\nkissed lepers without being smitten with the disease, may be added\r\nWalter de Luci, Abbot of Battle, in Sussex, from 1139 to 1171, who often\r\nwashed and kissed the feet and hands of lepers—_eorum manus pedesque\r\nabluendo fovebat, et intimo caritatis pietatisque affectu blanda oscula\r\nimprimebat_.—(_Chronicon Monasterii de Bello_, p. 135. Lond. 1846.\r\nAnglia Christiana.)\r\n\r\nThe story (Sir James Simpson’s Paper, Part III. p. 134) quoted from\r\nMatthew Paris, about the good Queen Maud, is to be found in an earlier\r\nwriter, St. Aelred of Rievaux, from whose _Genealogia Regum Anglorum_\r\nMatthew Paris, or rather Roger of Wendover, borrowed it. It may be\r\nremarked, generally, that late editors have shown that all that part of\r\nMatthew Paris’ history which is previous to the year 1235 is really the\r\nwork of Roger of Wendover. As such it has been reprinted by the English\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF LEPER HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\n_Oxford, St. Bartholomew._—The date of foundation of this hospital is\r\nleft blank in the list of British Leper Hospitals, p. 160. It certainly\r\nexisted before the 24th November 1200, when the lepers of St.\r\nBartholomew of Oxford had letters of protection from King John.—(_Rot.\r\nChart. in Turr. Lund._ vol. i. p. 99.)\r\n\r\n_Berington._—On the 20th July 1199 King John confirms to the canons\r\nregular of Lantony, among their other possessions, the half of\r\nBerington, which had been given to them by the Earl Roger for the\r\nprocuration of thirteen lepers—“_Ex dono Rogeri Comitis aliam\r\ndimidietatem de Berington ad procurationem tredecim\r\nleprosorum._”—(_Rot. Chart. in Turr. Lund._ vol. i. p. 7.) “Procuratio”\r\nseems to be used here in the sense of _necessaria ad victum et\r\nvestitum_.—(See Ducange, t. v. col. 885.)\r\n\r\n_Carlisle._—The lepers of Carlisle had letters of protection from King\r\nJohn on 25th February 1201.—(_Rot. Chart. in Turr. Lund._ vol. i. p.\r\n101.)\r\n\r\n_Badele, near Darlington, in the county of Durham._—The reception of a\r\nleprous girl into the hospital of Badele, about three miles from\r\nDarlington, is related by Reginald of Durham in his _Libellus de Vita et\r\nMiraculis S. Godrici_, p. 456. Lond. 1845. (Surtees Soc.) The work was\r\nwritten before 1195.\r\n\r\n_Canterbury._—The date of foundation of this hospital is left blank in\r\nthe list of British Leper Hospitals, p. 158. It certainly existed before\r\nthe death of Archbishop Lanfranc in 1089, for the contemporary historian\r\nof Canterbury expressly says it was built by him:—“Ligneas domos in\r\ndevexo montis latere fabricans, eas ad opus Leprosorum delegavit, viris\r\nin istis a fœminarum societate sejunctis.”—(_Eadmeri Hist. Novorum_,\r\np. 9. Lond. 1623.)\r\n\r\n_York._—_One_ leper hospital at York is noted in the list of British\r\nLeper Hospitals, at p. 161. There were _four_. The will of Henry of\r\nBlythe, painter of York, in 1365, has this bequest:—“Item lego quatuor\r\ndomibus Leprosorum civitatis Eboracencis equaliter ij solidos\r\ndividendos.”—(_Testamenta Eboracensia_, vol. i. p. 75. Lond. 1836.\r\nSurtees Soc.) The will of Master Adam Wigan, rector of St. Saviour’s,\r\nYork, in 1433, has—“Item lego cuilibet domui quatuor domorum leprosorum\r\niij s. iiij d.—(_Test. Ebor._ vol. ii. p. 26. Lond. 1855. Surtees Soc.)\r\nThe will of Richard Russell, citizen and merchant of York, in 1435,\r\nshows that at York, as elsewhere, the leper hospitals were beyond the\r\ncity walls:—“Et cuilibet leproso in quatuor domibus Leprosorum in\r\nsuburbiis Ebor., v solidos.”—(_Test. Ebor._ vol. ii. p. 55.) Again, in\r\nthe will of William Gyrlyngton, draper of York, in 1444:—“Item lego\r\nquatuor domibus Leprosorum in suburbiis Ebor., xx solidos per equales\r\nportiones.”—(_Test. Ebor._ vol. ii. p. 93.) The lepers of York have\r\nsimilar bequests in 1446, in 1454, and 1441.—(_Test. Ebor._ vol. ii.\r\npp. 115, 182, 187.) I do not observe any legacies to them after 1454.\r\n\r\n_Beverley._—The leper hospital here, as at York, Canterbury, Glasgow,\r\nStirling, Aberdeen, etc., stood in the suburbs. The will of John\r\nBrompton, merchant of Beverley, in 1444, has this legacy—“Item leprosis\r\nextra barras boriales Beverlaci ij s. et dimidiam celdram\r\ncarbonum.”—(_Test. Ebor._ vol. ii. p. 97.)\r\n\r\n_Newcastle-upon-Tyne._—The will of Roger Thornton, merchant of\r\nNewcastle, in 1429, has this legacy—“Item to the Lepre men of\r\nNewcastell, xl s.”—(_Northern Wills and Inventories_, part i. p. 78.\r\nLond. 1835. Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\n_Winchester._—The existence of a leper hospital at Winchester is shown\r\nby the will of Martin of Holy Rood, master of the hospital of Sherborn,\r\nin 1259 [referred to in Sir James Simpson’s Paper, Part I., p.\r\n36]—“Fratribus Leprosis Wyntonie, ij solidos.”—(_Northern Wills and\r\nInventories_, part i. p. 10.)\r\n\r\n_Lynne, Norfolk._—_Five_ leper hospitals at Lynne, in Norfolk, are\r\nenumerated in the list of British Leper Hospitals, p. 160. There seem to\r\nhave been _six_. Mr. Albert Way, in a note to the _Promptorium\r\nParvulorum_, vol. i. p. 297, Lond. 1843 (Camden Soc.), cites, from\r\nParkins’ _Account of Lynne, in Blomf. Norf._ iv. 608, the bequest of\r\nStephen Guybor, in 1432, to every house of lepers about Lynn, “namely,\r\nat West Lynn, Cowgate, Herdwyk, Setchehithe, Mawdelyn, and Geywode.”\r\nFour of these may be identified with those in the list, p. 160. “West\r\nLynn” and “Cowgate” are the same in both lists; “Mawdelyn” is “St. Mary\r\nMagdalene’s;” and “Setchehithe” is “Setch Hithe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [SIZE OF ORIGINALS]]\r\n\r\nANCIENT GREEK MEDICINE VASES.]\r\n\r\nNOTES ON SOME ANCIENT GREEK MEDICAL VASES FOR CONTAINING LYKION; AND ON\r\nTHE MODERN USE OF THE SAME DRUG IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physicians and surgeons who, in ancient times, pursued their medical\r\nprofession at Rome, and in different parts of the Roman empire, have\r\nleft us various palpable relics of their craft. Thus, in the ruins of\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum, numerous surgical instruments, pharmacy and\r\ndrug-bottles, etc., have been found; and elaborate drawings and accounts\r\nof these have lately been published by Savenko, Vulpes, Renzi, and\r\nothers. On the sites of the old Roman cities and colonies throughout\r\nWestern Europe, various surgical and medical relics of the same kind\r\nhave been at different times discovered; as lancets, probes,\r\ncupping-glasses, scalpels, oculist-stamps, phials, etc. But of medicine,\r\nas it was still earlier exercised in Greece and in the Grecian colonies,\r\nfew such tangible vestiges remain. We have, it is true, had carefully\r\ntransmitted down to us the imperishable professional writings of\r\nHippocrates and others of the purely Greek school; but time has spared\r\nfew, or indeed almost no, material remnants of the professional\r\ninstruments or vessels used by the ancient Greek surgeons and\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the great rarity of such archæological remains may serve as some\r\napology for the present notice of some specimens of ancient Greek\r\nmedical vessels or vases. Besides, the vases which I wish to describe\r\nare interesting in other points of view. They are all of them intended\r\nto contain one and the same drug, as shown by the inscriptions on their\r\nexterior; this drug was derived by the ancient Greeks chiefly from\r\nHindostan,—one of the many points of evidence of the former freedom and\r\nfrequency of the traffic between the south of Europe and India; and at\r\nthe present day the same drug is still employed extensively and\r\nsuccessfully, by the native practitioners of the East, for the very\r\npurposes for which it was, in former times, used by the medical\r\npractitioners of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe drug to which I allude is the _Indian Lycium_ or _Lykion_, the\r\nΛΥΚΙΟΝ ΙΝΔΙΚΟΝ of Dioscorides. In modern collections and\r\nwritings, I know of four ancient vases or drug-bottles intended to\r\ncontain this valued eye-medicine. If our museums, however, were properly\r\nsearched, perhaps various other Greek vases, for the same or for similar\r\nmedicines, would be detected. The four specimens of bottles or vases for\r\n_Lycium_, to which I have adverted, are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. In the collection of Greek antiquities contained in the British\r\nMuseum is a small vase, made of lead, and of the exact form and size\r\nrepresented in Plate, Fig. 1. The vase is of a sub-ovoid form, and is\r\nsomewhat above an inch in height, and about three quarters of an inch in\r\nbreadth. An inscription, preceded by the ornament of a small tripod,\r\nencircles the middle of the vase. The inscription is in Greek letters,\r\nof which the following is a correct copy:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ΛΥΚΙΟΝ ΠΑΡΑΜΟΥΣΑΙΟΥ]\r\n\r\nThis inscription may be read as ΛΥΚΙΟΝ ΠΑΡΑΜΟΥΣΑΙΟΥ—the _Lycium of\r\nParamusaeus_—as suggested to me by Mr. Birch, who first had the\r\nkindness to direct my attention to this vase, or, and perhaps more\r\ncorrectly, it may be rendered ΛΥΚΙΟΝ ΠΑΡΑ ΜΟΥΣΑΙΟΥ—the _Lycium_ sold\r\n_by Musaeus_. Mr. Birch informs me that he thinks he met with the name\r\nof _Paramusaeus_ as a medical practitioner in Fabricius’ _Bibliotheca\r\nGræca_. I have not been fortunate enough to detect the name in question,\r\nnotwithstanding some considerable search through that learned work. On\r\nthe other hand, the name of _Museus_, or _Musaeus_, is well known in\r\nAthenian biography. (See Fabricius’ _Bibliotheca_, vol. i. pp. 120-133.)\r\nI should, perhaps, have already stated, that the vase in question was\r\nsent to the British Museum, among a collection of antiquities from\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n2. Through the kindness of M. Sichel of Paris, I am enabled to give, in\r\nPlate, Fig. 2, an engraving of a second _Lycium_ jar, not hitherto\r\npublished, of nearly the same dimensions as the specimen contained in\r\nthe British Museum. This second specimen is not made of lead, but of\r\npottery-ware. It bears upon its side the inscription:—\r\n\r\n  HΡΑΚΛΕΙᵒΥ\r\n  ΛΥΚᵒN\r\n\r\nThis inscription—“the _Lycium of Heracleus_”—has the word ΛΥΚΟΝ spelt\r\nwithout the I; errors of this kind being, as is well known, very common\r\nin old Greek and Roman letterings.\r\n\r\n3. M. Millin of Paris published, nearly forty years ago, an account of a\r\nsimilar vase, found at Tarentum, a well-known Greek colony and\r\nsettlement (_Description d’un Vase trouvé à Tarente._ Paris, 1814). This\r\nvase is slightly larger than either of the above, but somewhat\r\nmutilated. It is made of clay, and has on its front, in Greek letters,\r\nthe inscription _Lycium of Jason_.\r\n\r\n  IAϹᵒNᵒϹ\r\n  ΛΥΚΙᵒN\r\n\r\nThe form and size of this jar are represented in Plate, Fig. 3. M.\r\nMillin fancied that probably this small vase or jar was intended as a\r\nchild’s toy; but two years after he wrote, M. Tochon d’Anneci gave an\r\naccount of a similar jar, and first suggested that it must have been\r\ndestined to contain a collyrium or an ointment—_destinè à contenir un\r\ncollyre ou un onguent_. (See his _Dissertation sur l’Inscription\r\nGrecque, et sur les Pierres Antiques_, etc., Paris, 1816.)\r\n\r\n4. The vase described by M. Tochon is delineated in Plate, Figs. 4, 5,\r\nand 6. It is of the same material, and nearly of the same size, but less\r\nmutilated than that previously delineated by M. Millin. It presents also\r\nin front the same inscription (see Fig. 5), namely—\r\n\r\n  ΙΑϹᵒΝᵒϹ\r\n  ΛVΚΙᵒN\r\n\r\nM. Tochon believes, further, that this vase was found, like that of\r\nMillin, at Tarentum. At least, it was originally given to M. Tochon by a\r\nperson who had resided for a long time in that city, and who had himself\r\nacquired the specimen there. M. Sichel has reason to think it not\r\nimprobable that his specimen (Fig. 2) also came from Tarentum. And it is\r\nperhaps not uninteresting to remark, that Galen, Celsus, and various\r\nother old medical authors, repeatedly mention a Greek physician of the\r\nname of Heracleus or Heraclides, who practised at Tarentum, and was the\r\nauthor of various treatises on the Materia Medica, etc. (See an\r\nenumeration of his writings, etc. in Kühn’s _Opuscula_, vol. ii., p.\r\n156, etc.) Among his large collection of collyria and medicines for\r\ndiseases of the eye, Galen gives formulæ for making different eye\r\nmedicines bearing the name of Heracleus, as, for example, two\r\n“_agglutinatoria pilorum Heraclidæ Tarentini_ (Ἥρακλεῖδου Ταραντίνοῦ).\r\nSee Kuhn’s edition of _Galen_, vol. xii. p. 741.\r\n\r\nThe medicine mentioned in the preceding inscriptions, the LYCIUM or\r\nΛΥΚΙΟΝ, was a drug which enjoyed much favour among the ancients; and it\r\nwas supposed to be possessed of great medical value and virtues. It was\r\nused principally as an astringent remedy to restrain inflammatory and\r\nother discharges. Dioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and Paulus Ægineta,\r\ndilate upon the medicinal properties of the Lycium. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as an astringent for the cure of various complaints, as\r\nobscurities of the cornea, psoriasis, and pruritus of the eyelids,\r\npurulent ears and tonsils, ulcers of the gums, chapped lips, fissure of\r\nthe anus; in cæliac and dysenteric affections, both in draughts and\r\nclysters; in hæmoptysis and coughs; in female fluxes, hydrophobia, and\r\nso forth. The Indian variety, he states, cures inflammation of the\r\nspleen and jaundice, prevents menstruation, purges water, and is a\r\ncounter-agent to deadly poisons. (Dr. Adam’s Trans. of _Paulus Ægineta_,\r\nvol. iii. p. 234.) Two varieties of Lycium were in use—one obtained from\r\nLycia and Cappadocia, etc., and the other from India. The latter was\r\nregarded as by far the most valuable. Thus, when treating of the two\r\nvarieties of Lycium, Galen mentions the Indian as the most powerful for\r\nall purposes—τὸ Ἰνδικὸν ἰσχῦρότερόν ἐστιν εἰς ἅπαν. (_De\r\nSimp. Medicam._ lib. vii. 64.) Such late writers as Paulus Ægineta,\r\nÆtius, etc., allude also to the superior value of the Indian variety.\r\nFor instance, in Roxarius’ edition of _Oribasius_ it is stated that the\r\nIndian Lykion “præstat ceteris et est efficacius.” (_Medicin. Collect._\r\nlib. xi.) Avicenna, the celebrated Arabian physician, who gives a long\r\naccount of the medical uses, etc., of Lykion, remarks, “Magis vincens,\r\nsecundum existimationem, est quod Indicum est,” etc.; and he compares\r\nits properties with that from Mecca. (_Canon Medicinæ_, Lib. ii. cap.\r\n398.)\r\n\r\nOf all the uses to which the Lycium was applied in medicine, by far the\r\nmost important was the employment of this drug, and particularly of the\r\nIndian variety, as a collyrium or local application to the eye, in the\r\ntreatment of different varieties and forms of ophthalmic inflammation.\r\nThus Scribonius Largus, the reputed body physician to the Emperor\r\nClaudius, and one of the most original among the ancient medical\r\nwriters, declares that “he attributes to no collyrium whatever such\r\ngreat efficacy as to the genuine _Indian Lycium_ used by itself. For\r\nif,” says he, “near the commencement of ophthalmia, any one anoints\r\nhimself with this collyrium, he will immediately—that is, on the same\r\nday—be freed from present pain and future swelling. It is unnecessary\r\n(he adds) to dilate on its virtues, for a person experienced only in\r\nother collyria would scarcely credit the effects of this simple drug.”\r\n(_De Composit. Medicamentorum_, cap. 3.) Marcellus lauds its power in\r\nnearly the same words. (_De Medicam. Lib._ cap. 8.)\r\n\r\nThe Lykion, or Lycium, is still used extensively by the native medical\r\npractitioners of India, under the Hindoo name of _Rusot_ or _Ruswut_. In\r\na learned article on the nature of the λύκιον of Dioscorides, contained\r\nin the _Transactions of the Linnæan Society_, vol. xvii. p. 82,\r\nProfessor Royle has shown that the Indian Lycium or Rusot is an\r\ninspissated extract, prepared from the wood or roots of several species\r\nof Berberis, as the _Berberis lycium_, _aristata_, etc., growing on the\r\nmountains and plains of Upper India, and principally procured from\r\nNuggur-kote, near Lahore.[366] “On inquiring,” says Dr. Royle, “in the\r\nshops of the druggists in the bazaars of India, I everywhere learned\r\nthat both the wood (_dar-huld_) and the extract Rusot were imported from\r\nthe hills into the plains, and that large quantities continued to be\r\nbrought from Nuggur-kote as well as other places.” And he adds,—“The\r\n_Rusot_ is at the present day procurable in every bazaar in India, and\r\nused by the native practitioners, who are fond of applying it both in\r\nincipient and chronic inflammation of the eye; and in the latter state\r\nboth simply and in combination with opium and alum. It is sometimes\r\nprescribed by European practitioners; and I have heard that it was found\r\nvery efficacious by Mr. M^cDowell in the ophthalmia of soldiers who had\r\nreturned from the expedition to Egypt. I have myself occasionally\r\nprescribed it; and the native mode of application makes it particularly\r\neligible in cases succeeding acute inflammation, where the eye remains\r\nmuch swollen. The extract is, by native practitioners, in such cases,\r\nrubbed to a proper consistence with a little water, sometimes with the\r\naddition of opium and alum, and applied in a thick layer over the\r\nswollen eyelids; the addition of a little oil I have found preferable,\r\nas preventing the too rapid desiccation. Patients generally express\r\nthemselves as experiencing considerable relief from the application.”\r\n\r\nMy friend, Dr. Wise, the author of that learned work _Commentaries on\r\nthe Hindoo System of Medicine_, some time ago brought to Scotland with\r\nhim a small quantity of the Indian Lykion. I have seen one or two cases\r\nof recent conjunctival ophthalmia treated by the application of this\r\nLykion, with speedy relief and cure. Dr. Wise has been so good as\r\nfurnish me with the following interesting letter regarding his own\r\nextended experience with it.\r\n\r\n“The use (says Dr. Wise) of the mixture of Lykion or Ruswut is very\r\ngenerally known over Hindostan, where diseases of the eye are common,\r\nand probably over Asia and Africa, if we are to believe that this was\r\nthe black application employed with such success to the diseased eyes of\r\nour soldiers in Egypt. It is likewise probable that Dioscorides obtained\r\nit nearly two thousand years ago from the East, where the plant is\r\nindigenous, and introduced it into Europe. Having found great personal\r\nbenefit from the application of the mixture of Lykion to my eyes when\r\ninflamed, I employed it extensively when superintendent of the Eye\r\nInfirmary, Calcutta; and so convinced was I of its efficacy, that I\r\nbrought a supply with me to Europe, with the intention of bringing it to\r\nthe notice of the profession. I found you investigating the subject; and\r\nat your suggestion, Dr. Walker was so kind as to try the medicine, and I\r\nam sure will inform you of the results he saw derived from its use. The\r\nIndian mixture consists of equal weights of Lykion and burnt alum, with\r\nhalf the weight of opium. These ingredients are mixed with lemon-juice,\r\nand reduced to the consistence of cream, and applied round the eyelids\r\nand over the eyebrow of the inflamed eyes. This mixture is washed off,\r\nand again applied twice in twenty-four hours; and it was only when\r\naccompanied with fever, that aperients and other parts of the\r\nantiphlogistic regimen were required. In less urgent cases the mixture\r\nwas only applied at night, and produced no inconvenience, unless when it\r\ndried, and the lids felt stiff, when it was softened by applying a\r\nlittle moisture. I found the Lykion mixture most useful in all cases of\r\ninflammation of the external tunics of the eye. When both eyes were\r\ninflamed, it was interesting to mark the advantage this simple remedy\r\nhad when applied to one eye, while the usual remedies of leeches,\r\nblisters, etc., were applied to the other eye. Another most important\r\napplication of the Lykion is when the ophthalmia is accompanied with\r\nsevere pain. On such occasions, after applying the mixture, a piece of\r\nlive charcoal (_gool_) produced the most soothing effect when approached\r\nnear the eye. With this intention, the charcoal was placed upon an\r\nearthen cup, and held on a wooden stand by the patient, and he\r\napproached or withdrew it from the eye according to his own feeling. The\r\ngreat relief in this case was in part from the anodyne effect of the\r\nopium.”\r\n\r\nMr. Walker has kindly given me the following note of his experience with\r\nthe Lykion at the Edinburgh Eye Dispensary:—\r\n\r\n“I have used (he writes me) the Indian Lykion in a considerable number\r\nof cases of eye-disease. The affections in which I found it most useful\r\nwere those of the conjunctiva, such as the simple, catarrhal, and\r\npustular forms of inflammation. In them its action was well marked and\r\nbeneficial, the disease generally subsiding in a day or two; sooner\r\nperhaps than it would have done under the ordinary treatment. I have had\r\nno opportunity of trying it in purulent ophthalmia; but I believe that\r\nin it also it would prove of service. Cases of slight rheumatic and\r\ncatarrho-rheumatic inflammations have been benefited, but not cured, by\r\nit alone. In some affections of the eyelids, as ophthalmia tarsi and\r\nchronic ophthalmia, it did good; but such cases often get well with very\r\nlittle treatment. I applied it to the eyelids in the form of a paste,\r\nwith opium and burnt alum, as recommended by Dr. Wise. This was repeated\r\ntwo or three times a day. The patients generally complained of a burning\r\nand smarting of the lids after its application, similar to what is\r\nproduced by a mustard blister.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four ancient Greek vases, mentioned in the preceding notice as\r\ninscribed with the name of the drug _Lykion_ or _Lycium_, are each of\r\nvery small dimensions, the Plate representing all of them of their\r\noriginal sizes and forms. They are small, in consequence, in all\r\nprobability, of the foreign drug which they contained being difficult to\r\nprocure in large quantities, and being hence an article of high price in\r\nthe markets of Greece and Italy. The value set upon the contained drug\r\nwould seem to be indicated by another circumstance—namely, by the shape\r\nof the interior of the vases. In the specimens described by Millin and\r\nTochon, the cavity of the jars is narrow and conical from above\r\ndownwards, the mouth being wide, and the interior becoming more and more\r\ntapering and contracted as it descends downwards. The section of the\r\ninterior of the vase of Tochon, given in Plate, Fig. 6, represents this\r\npeculiar and deceitful form of the cavity. In consequence of this\r\npeculiarity in their form, these jars contained, in fact, much less of\r\nthe Lykion than their mere external appearance indicated. This remark,\r\nat least, holds true of the two vases from Tarentum bearing the name of\r\n_Jason_. The vase of _Museus_ from Athens, belonging to the British\r\nMuseum, appears more honest at least in its construction. The high price\r\nof the pure Lykion probably led also to the fact mentioned specially by\r\nDioscorides (lib. i. cap. 133), Pliny (lib. xxiv. cap. 14), and Serapion\r\n(lib. ii. cap. 398), of the frequent adulteration of the drug. And,\r\nperhaps, as in similar inscriptions on some modern medicine-nostrums and\r\npackets, the names of the preparer or vendor, _Jason_, _Heracleus_, and\r\n_Museus_, stamped on the vases, were added in attestation of the purity\r\nand unadulterated character of the drug which these vases contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. I., Fig. II.\r\n\r\nROMAN INSCRIPTIONS TO MEDICAL OFFICERS.]\r\n\r\nWAS THE ROMAN ARMY PROVIDED WITH MEDICAL OFFICERS?\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing has hitherto been written by archæologists regarding\r\nthe medical staff of the Roman army. Indeed, in none of our common works\r\non Roman antiquities, as in those of Rosini, Kennet, Adam, Smith,\r\nRamsay, etc., is there any allusion whatever made to the question,\r\nwhether or not the Roman troops were furnished with medical officers. In\r\none anonymous work on Roman antiquities, translated from the French, and\r\npublished in London in 1750, the subject is referred to, the author\r\nstating that during the commonwealth there were no physicians in the\r\nRoman armies; and he adds that, even under the Emperors, “it does not\r\nappear there were any physicians in the armies, as there are surgeons in\r\nours.”[367] Nor does there exist, as far as I am aware, in the Roman\r\nclassics, any very distinct allusion to the matter. I have also, in\r\nvain, searched among Roman medical authors, and among the writings of\r\nthe Greek physicians who practised at Rome, for any direct notices,\r\nrelative to the medical or surgical care of the numerous and scattered\r\narmies employed by Rome in the different quarters of the world. In fact,\r\nthe only passages, with which I am acquainted, relating at all to the\r\nsubject, consist of a casual remark in one of the military epistles of\r\nAurelian; two incidental legal observations contained in the law\r\nwritings of Modestinus, and in the Codex of Justinian; an allusion by\r\nVegetius to the medical care and expense of the sick in camp; and an\r\nexpression by Galen as to the opportunities for anatomical observation\r\npresented to the physicians during the German wars.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the medical superintendence of the army by Aurelian\r\noccurs in Vopiscus’ Life of that Emperor (chap. vi.) In issuing some\r\nperemptory orders regarding the discipline of the army, after\r\nenumerating various rigid rules which the soldiers were to observe,\r\nAurelian concludes with the following admonition and announcement:—“Let\r\neach soldier aid and serve his fellow; let them be cured gratuitously by\r\nthe physicians (_a medicis gratis curentur_); let them give nothing to\r\nsoothsayers; let them conduct themselves quietly in their hospitia; and\r\nhe who would raise strife, let him be lashed.”[368] The date of this\r\norder is not earlier than A.D. 270, the year when Aurelian became\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nWhen treating of those who, by absence from Rome, etc., were exempted\r\nfrom some burthens and taxes, the jurist Modestinus, who wrote in the\r\nearlier half of the third century, mentions, among others, the military\r\nphysicians (_Medici Militum_), “because,” he adds, “the office which\r\nthey fill is beneficial to the public, and ought not to be productive of\r\nany injury to themselves (quoniam officium, quod gerunt, et publice\r\nprodest, et fraudem eis adferre non debet”).[369]\r\n\r\nIn Justinian’s _Corpus Juris Civilis_, lib. x. tit. 52, drawn up in the\r\nsixth century, there is a series of laws, “De Professoribus et Medicis.”\r\nThe first of these laws exempts the physician of a legion (_Medicum\r\nLegionis_) from civil duties when he is absent in the public\r\nservice.[370]\r\n\r\nIn his work _De Re Militari_, Vegetius, who wrote towards the end of the\r\nfourth century, devotes a chapter (lib. iii. 2) to the regulation of the\r\nhealth of an army; and incidentally rather than directly alludes to the\r\ncure of sick soldiers by the skill of the physicians (_arte\r\nmedicorum_).[371] Enumerating also elsewhere the duties of the Præfect\r\nof the Camp, he states that his authority extended over his sick\r\nfellow-soldiers, and the physicians who had the care of them, and he\r\nregulated the expenses relative thereto. (Lib. ii. cap. 10.)\r\n\r\nThe passage I have alluded to as in the works of Galen is of an earlier\r\ndate than any of the preceding, and is to be found in liber iii. cap. 2,\r\nof his work, _De Compositione Medicamentorum per Genera_. In discoursing\r\nregarding the treatment of wounds, he talks of the necessity of a\r\nknowledge of human anatomy for their proper management. In order to know\r\nthe anatomy of man, he recommends here, as elsewhere, the anatomy of the\r\nmonkey to be studied, maintaining that without such knowledge you cannot\r\ntake due advantage of the opportunities that you may accidentally have\r\npresented to you of becoming acquainted with the anatomical structure of\r\nhuman bodies. And he adds, that in consequence of a want of this\r\nknowledge the physicians (οἱ ἰατροι) employed in the German wars, and\r\nhaving the power of dissecting the bodies of the barbarians, did not\r\nlearn more than the cooks understand.[372]\r\n\r\nThis paragraph, though indistinct as regards the status and office of\r\nthese Ἰατροι, is still sufficiently explicit as to the fact\r\nthat there were physicians in the Roman army during the German wars that\r\nGalen alludes to; and these wars were no doubt those that occurred from\r\nthe year A.D. 167 to 175, immediately previous to the time when Galen\r\nwrote the work from which we have quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of other more ancient governments than that of Rome is not\r\nwithout allusion to the office of army physicians. Homer,[373]\r\nHerodotus,[374] and Pliny,[375] each comment on the number and fame of\r\nthe medical men with which the kingdom of Egypt abounded. Diogenes\r\nLaertius, in his life of Plato, tells us of Plato’s sickness when\r\ntravelling in Egypt; and adds that he remarked, like Homer, that the\r\nEgyptians were all physicians (φαναι παντας ἀνθρώπους Αἴγυπτιους ἰατρους\r\nεἰναι).[376] They had, moreover, paid medical officers attendant upon\r\ntheir troops in war. For, in describing the status and character of the\r\nEgyptian physicians, Diodorus Siculus specially mentions that, when\r\nengaged in military expeditions, the soldiers were cured without fees,\r\nfor the physicians of the army received a salary from the state.[377]\r\n\r\nOne instance is referred to in history, in which an Egyptian king, when\r\nthrown from his horse in battle, wounded and speechless from injury of\r\nthe head, had his skull trepanned by his surgeons. I allude to Ptolemy\r\nPhilometor, who defeated Alexander Balas, the pretender to the throne of\r\nSyria, in the year B.C. 146. According to Livy, the victor himself died\r\nafter the battle during the attempts of his surgeons to relieve him.\r\n“Ptolemaeus, in caput graviter vulneratus, inter curationem, dum ossa\r\nmedici _terebrare_ contendunt, exspiravit.”—(_Epit._ lib. lii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is the old classical literature of Greece without reference to\r\nsurgical services tendered to the soldier in war. Homer describes the\r\ndouble character of army surgeons and warriors as combined in the\r\npersons of Podalirius and Machaon.[378] And when the latter is wounded,\r\nhe puts into the mouth of Idomeneus the well-known expression (Iliad,\r\nlib. xi. v. 514), that the medical man is to the army more valuable than\r\nmany warriors; knowing as he does how to excise arrows, and to apply\r\nsoothing medications:—\r\n\r\n  Ιητρος γαρ ανηρ πολλῶν ἀνταξιος ἀλλων,\r\n  Ιους τ’ ἐκταμνειν, επι τ’ ηπια φαρμακα πασσειν.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Iliad, the surgical treatment followed in\r\nindividual cases among the disabled Greek warriors is sometimes minutely\r\nentered upon; and thus the different modes of operation by which the\r\ntransfixing arrow, dart, and lance, were, in those early days of\r\nsurgical science, removed from the bodies of the wounded, may be\r\nsometimes gathered from Homer’s lucid and minute descriptions. He\r\nmentions three different methods, at least, by which war-weapons were\r\nextracted—viz., first, by evulsion, or traction of the weapon\r\nbackwards, as in the case of Menelaus (Iliad, lib. iv. 214); secondly,\r\nby protrusion, or pushing of the instrument forward, as in the case of\r\nDiomede (v. 112); and, thirdly, by enlarging the wound, and cutting out\r\nthe weapon, as was the practice of Patroclus in the case of Eurypylus\r\n(xi. 843). I am not aware that Homer ever individualises any internal\r\nmedical treatment except once (xi. 638), when he mentions a mixture of\r\nPramnian wine, cheese, and flour, as having been administered by the\r\nnursing hand of Hecamede to the wounded Machaon,[379] ere she prepared\r\nthe warm bath for him and washed away the clotted blood (xiv. 7).\r\n\r\nThe author of the ancient Greek treatise Περὶ Ἰητρου, an essay usually\r\nincluded in the works of Hippocrates, explicitly advises the young\r\nphysician to attach himself for a time to some army, in order to learn\r\nthe best methods of extracting war-weapons, and to acquire practical\r\nskill in the treatment of accidents.[380]\r\n\r\nXenophon alludes in various parts of his works to physicians or surgeons\r\nconnected with the Greek armies. In describing the laws of the\r\nLacedemonians, as instituted in the earliest ages of Greek history by\r\nLycurgus, he incidentally mentions that physicians were attached to the\r\nSpartan army. For in the arrangements previously laid down for the\r\ntroops before a battle, it was ordered that there should be placed\r\nbehind the station occupied by the King several officials, and among\r\nothers, the soothsayers or priests, the physicians, the minstrels, the\r\nleaders of the army, and any persons who were voluntarily present in the\r\nexpedition (καὶ μάντεις, καὶ ἰατροὶ, καὶ αὐληταὶ, οἱ τοῦ στρατοῦ ἄρχοντες,\r\nκαὶ ἐθελούσιοι ἠν τινες πατρῶσιν).\r\n\r\nAgain, in his celebrated account of the retreat of the ten thousand\r\nGreeks, Xenophon states that at the conclusion of the fifth day of their\r\nmarch, and after considerable skirmishing with the troops of\r\nTissaphernes, “they appointed eight physicians, for there were many\r\npersons wounded.”[381]—(_Anabasis_, lib. iii. c. 4, § 30.)\r\n\r\nLastly, in his semi-historical or political romance—the _Cyropædia_\r\n(lib. i. 6, § 15), Xenophon makes his young royal hero, Cyrus, the\r\nfounder of the Persian monarchy, speak, among other matters, of the\r\nimportance of medical officers being attached to armies. “With respect\r\nto health” (says Cyrus), “having heard and observed that cities that\r\nwish health choose physicians, and that commanders, for the sake of\r\ntheir soldiers, take physicians; so, when I was placed in this command,\r\nI immediately attended to this point; and I believe that I have men with\r\nme that are very skilful in the art of physic.” In the same work\r\nXenophon subsequently describes Cyrus as commending to the professional\r\nservices and care of his medical officers the Chaldeans who had been\r\nwounded and captured in fight with him.—(_Instit. Cyri_, lib. iii. c.\r\n2, § 12.)\r\n\r\nFew individual instances are recorded in Greek history of surgical aid\r\nbeing afforded on the field of battle. One of the most interesting\r\nexamples is that mentioned by Quintus Curtius in reference to Alexander\r\nthe Great at the taking of the capital of the Oxydraceæ, or Mallians.\r\nThe Macedonian King, who had leaped down, almost alone, within the walls\r\nof the fortress, was struck with a long arrow (duorum cubitorum\r\nsagitta), which entered the right side of the thorax (per thoracem\r\npaulum super latus dextrum infigeretur). The wound produced great\r\nhæmorrhage and faintness. Alexander was carried on his shield to his\r\ntent; and the shaft of the arrow being cut off and his cuirass removed,\r\nit was discovered that the head of the arrow was barbed, and could not,\r\nconsequently, be removed without the artificial dilatation of the wound\r\nand imminent danger from increased bleeding; for the large weapon was\r\nfixed in its situation, and seemed to have penetrated into the internal\r\nviscera (quippe ingens telum adactum erat, et penetrasse in viscera\r\nvidebatur). At Alexander’s request, the surgeon Critobulus undertook the\r\nextraction, enlarged the wound, and removed the arrow-head, which,\r\naccording to Plutarch, was “three fingers broad and four long.” Great\r\nhæmorrhage (ingens vis sanguinis) attended the operation; death-like\r\ninsensibility supervened; and, when the flow of blood continued in\r\ndespite of the medicaments (medicamenta) applied, a cry and wail was set\r\nup by those around, that the king was dead. At last, however, the\r\nhæmorrhage stopped, under the state of syncope. That very syncope,\r\nobserves Arrian, saved his life; and Alexander gradually recovered. But\r\nevery modern surgeon must admire the boldness, not less than the\r\nexpertness, of Critobulus, when he reflects for a moment on the fearful\r\nperil attendant on such an operation, performed on so august a\r\npatient—and at a time, too, when surgical science as yet possessed no\r\ncertain means of restraining surgical hæmorrhage.[382]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of Roman history and Roman warfare, the treatment\r\nof the military sick and wounded was, in all probability, trusted to the\r\ncasual care of some fellow-soldiers whose tastes and inclinations had\r\nled them to pay more than usual care to the rude surgery which existed\r\nat the time.[383] As early, however, as the commencement of the\r\nChristian era, we find Celsus laying down distinct, and in many\r\ninstances very excellent and practical precepts for the extraction of\r\nwar-weapons from the bodies of the wounded[384]—as of arrows, spears,\r\nleaden bullets (_glandes plumbeæ_), etc.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the weapons used in ancient war seem to have been forged\r\nfor the special purpose of rendering their extraction by the surgeon a\r\nmatter of difficulty and danger. At least we find Paulus Ægineta\r\ncomplaining that some of them have “their barbs diverging in opposite\r\ndirections, like the forked lightning, in order that, whether pulled or\r\npushed, they may fasten in the parts.”[385]\r\n\r\nStill, let me repeat, neither in Celsus nor in Paulus Ægineta, nor,\r\nindeed, in any other ancient medical work, have we, as far as I know,\r\nany allusion to the circumstance of surgeons or physicians being\r\nregularly appointed as army medical officers in the Roman army, for the\r\npurpose of superintending the treatment of the wounded, or—what is of\r\nstill greater importance—in order to take professional care of the\r\nsoldiers disabled by sickness and disease, and whose number in warfare\r\nis generally very much greater than the number of those that are\r\ndisabled in fight.\r\n\r\nModern military experience has, in many instances, proved the high\r\nimportance of the services and superintendence of a medical military\r\nstaff; and not so much in reference to the care of individual cases, and\r\nthe cure of the wounded, as in reference to the general health and\r\nconsequent general strength and success of whole armies. In fact, in war\r\nthe devastations produced by sickness and disease have often been found\r\ngreatly more formidable and fatal than any devastations produced by the\r\nsword; fevers, dysenteries, and other distempers of the camp, have\r\ncarried off far more soldiers than the ball or bayonet; malarious and\r\nmorbific agency has sometimes terminated a campaign as effectually as\r\nthe highest military strategy; and armies have occasionally, in later\r\ntimes, been as completely destroyed by the indirect ravages of disease\r\nas by the direct effects of battle.\r\n\r\nNor was the experience of the Roman armies in this respect different\r\nfrom our own. When the Emperor Septimius Severus determined to subdue\r\nthe whole of Scotland, he about the year 208 led, according to Herodian\r\nand Dion Cassius,[386] an army of not less than 80,000 men across the\r\nForth, marched them north, apparently as far as the Moray Firth, and\r\nthence returned to York. But though in this course the Roman Emperor\r\nnowhere met the enemy in open fight, he is stated to have lost, in this\r\nsingle campaign, not less than 50,000 of his troops. The marshes, fens,\r\nwoods, etc., of Caledonia were far more destructive to the Roman\r\ninvaders, than were the spears, long swords (ingentes gladii) and\r\nscythed chariots (corvini) of its painted, and almost naked,\r\nwarriors.[387]\r\n\r\nWe know, from the oft-repeated anecdote regarding Arcagathus, as told by\r\nPliny, that in the early days of republican Rome the practice of\r\nmedicine was not encouraged among the inhabitants of the Eternal City.\r\nBut, in the later periods of the empire, Rome abounded with native and\r\nforeign physicians; and, when we find the Roman people exalted in so\r\nmany branches of art and knowledge, we could not but expect that common\r\nexperience, and results like that of Severus, would have suggested to\r\nthem the propriety of increasing the strength and success of their\r\narmies, by having medical men to watch over the health of the soldiers\r\nthat were fighting in so many different regions around the Roman\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome modern discoveries in Great Britain and elsewhere show that such a\r\nconjecture is not at variance with truth, and that the Roman armies were\r\nprovided, at all events in the time of the Empire, with a medical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousesteads, in Northumberland (the ancient Borcovicus), formed one of\r\nthe principal stations on the great defensive wall which the Emperor\r\nHadrian reared, in the second century, from the Tyne to the Solway. Many\r\nRoman remains have been found at Housesteads.[388] Thirty years ago the\r\nembellished monumental tablet, represented in the accompanying plate,\r\nFig. 1, was discovered among these remains. This tablet was, according\r\nto the inscription upon it, raised by the first Tungrian cohort to the\r\nmemory of their MEDICUS ORDINARIUS.[389] The plate represents this\r\ninteresting relic, which is preserved in the Newcastle Museum. The\r\ninscription upon the tablet reads as follows, in its contracted and in\r\nits extended forms:—\r\n\r\n   D     M           D[IIS]   M[ANIBUS]\r\n    ANICIO               ANICIO\r\n   INGENUO              INGENUO\r\n    MEDICO               MEDICO\r\n  ORD COH         ORD[INARIO] COH[ORTIS]\r\n   I TUNGR          [PRIMÆ] TUNGR[ORUM]\r\n  VIX AN XXV        VIX[IT] AN[NIS] XXV\r\n\r\nAnd I append Mr. Brace’s translation of it:—“Sacred to the gods of the\r\nshades below. To ANICIUS INGENUUS, Physician in Ordinary of Cohort the\r\nfirst of the Tungrians. He lived twenty-five years.”[390]\r\n\r\nThe first Tungrian Cohort, which erected this monument over the grave of\r\ntheir young physician, distinguished itself under Agricola at the battle\r\nof the Mons Grampius.[391] It was afterwards, as we learn from some\r\nlegionary inscriptions, engaged at Castlecary in erecting there a\r\nportion of the more northern Roman wall of Antoninus, which ran from the\r\nForth to the Clyde.[392] Subsequently it was stationed at Cramond, near\r\nEdinburgh, and there raised an altar to the _Matres Alatervæ et\r\nCampestres_.[393] Still later, this Cohort was stationed in Cumberland;\r\nand latterly at Housesteads, in Northumberland, where the monument\r\nwe allude to, and several others, were erected by them.[394]\r\n\r\nThe youth of this military physician is remarkable. He died at\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate nature of the carving of this monumental tablet affords\r\nthe strongest evidence of the esteem and respect in which this young\r\nphysician was held by his Cohort. In fact, it is more ornamented than\r\nmany of the altars raised by this and other Cohorts to the worship of\r\ntheir gods.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Mr. O’Callaghan[395] that the animal\r\nrepresented on the monument is a hare, and that it was selected as an\r\nemblem characteristic of the watchfulness of the profession to which\r\nANICIUS INGENUUS belonged. In his admirable work on the Roman Wall, the\r\nRev. Mr. Bruce describes, more correctly, the figure to be that of a\r\nrabbit; and he further conjectures that it had some reference to the\r\nworship of Priapus. The whole device is, in all probability, far more\r\nsimple in its signification. The _cuniculus_, or rabbit, when found on\r\nancient Roman monuments and coins, is generally held by archæologists\r\nand numismatists as the recognised emblem of Spain,[396] as, for\r\nexample, on the coins of Sextus Pompey and Galba; and the circular\r\nbucklers or cetræ which are placed on this tablet, on either side of the\r\nanimal, are equally strong characteristics of the same country. Indeed,\r\nthere can be little or no doubt that these devices indicate merely that\r\nthis young military physician was of Spanish birth and origin.\r\n\r\nSeveral monumental and votive tablets have been discovered in other\r\nparts of the old Roman world, affording further evidence of the Roman\r\ntroops being provided with a medical staff. In Gruter’s great work on\r\nRoman inscriptions there are copies of at least three inscriptions, in\r\nwhich physicians of Cohorts (_medici cohortum_) are mentioned.[397] One\r\nof these inscriptions (p. 219, 3) bears the name of a physician who had\r\nthe same _nomen gentilicium_ as the medical officer of the Tungrian\r\nCohort who died at Housesteads—viz., “M. JULIUS INGENUUS MEDIC. COH.\r\nII. VIG.” The tablet, which was found at Rome, contains a votive\r\nimperial inscription from twelve or thirteen persons, and among others,\r\nfrom the physician to the second “Cohors Vigilum.” Another of the\r\ninscriptions of Gruter is specially interesting in relation to its date,\r\nfor it was cut at the commencement of the reign of Domitian,[398] and in\r\nthe year of the consulship of F. Flavius Sabinus, which year\r\nchronologists know to have been the eighty-third of the Christian era.\r\nWe are, consequently, afforded evidence by this inscription that before\r\nthe end of the first century, at least—however much earlier—medical\r\nofficers were appointed to the Cohorts of the Roman army. The\r\ninscription itself is upon an altar or votive tablet, dedicated by\r\nSEXTUS TITUS ALEXANDER, physician of the fifth Prætorian Cohort, to\r\nÆsculapius, and the safety of his fellow-soldiers. A copy of this altar\r\nand its inscription is given in the accompanying plate, Fig. 2. The\r\nstone seems to have been found at Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother altar, discovered also at Rome, and inscribed in the same terms\r\nto Æsculapius, is given by Gruter (p. 68, 2). In this instance, the\r\ndedicator is SEXTUS TITIUS, medical officer to the sixth Prætorian\r\nCohort; and he erects it for the health of the fellow-soldiers of his\r\nCohort, in conformity with a vow which he had undertaken. The whole\r\ninscription is as follows:—\r\n\r\n     ASCLEPIO ET. SALUTI\r\n  COMMILITIONUM COH. VI. PR.\r\n      VOTO. SUSCEPTO\r\n   SEX. TITIUS. MEDIC. COH.\r\n         VI.

S.\r\n\r\nMuratori, in his Thesaurus,[400] cites a Roman sepulchral tablet\r\ndiscovered at Veterbi, and containing an inscription by a father to his\r\ndeceased son, M. VLPIUS SPORUS, Physician to the Indian and Asturian\r\nAuxiliaries (Medico Alarum Indianae et tertiae Asturum).[401]\r\n\r\nThe tablets to which I have hitherto alluded all refer, with the\r\ndoubtful exception of the first and last, to one rank of medical\r\nmilitary men, namely the surgeons of cohorts (_Medici Cohortum_). It is\r\ngenerally believed that each cohort consisted of about 500 or 600 men;\r\nthough this appears to have varied at different times. From the\r\npreceding tablets, each cohort seems to have been provided with at least\r\none medical officer, if not more. For the distinctive terms “Ordinarius”\r\nand “Clinicus,” which occur in the first and last of the preceding\r\ninscriptions, when added to the usual term “Medicus Cohortis,”\r\napparently tend to indicate a different grade or rank of medical officer\r\nfrom the latter.\r\n\r\nWhether, however, or not there were different grades among the Roman\r\n_Medici Cohortum_, we have sufficient evidence for proving that there\r\nexisted in the Roman army a higher rank of medical officer than\r\nthese,—namely, _Medici Legionum_. The Roman legion consisted of ten\r\ncohorts.[402] We have seen that the individual cohorts of which the\r\nlegion was composed were each provided with a medical officer or\r\nofficers. I have already cited a law from Justinian’s Codex, showing\r\nfurther that there were military physicians to the Roman legions. The\r\nevidence of monumental tablets affords additional proof, that over the\r\nwhole legion, another, and in all probability a superior medical\r\nofficer, was placed. More than one monumental tablet has been\r\ndiscovered, dedicated not to the _Medicus Cohortis_, but to the _Medicus\r\nLegioni_. Thus Maffei, in his _Museum Veronense_, gives the inscription\r\nof a tablet raised by Scribonia Faustina to the manes of her very dear\r\nhusband, L CÆLIUS ARRIANUS, physician to the Second Italian Legion, who\r\ndied at the age of forty-nine years and seven months. The inscription\r\nin the original runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n      D             M\r\n      L. CAELI ARRIANI\r\n      MEDICO LEGIONIS\r\n  II. ITALIC. QUI. VIX. ANN\r\n    XXXXVIIII. MENSIS VII\r\n     SCRIBONIA FAUSTINA\r\n      COIUGI KARISSIMO.[403]\r\n\r\nIn the _Collectio Inscriptionum_ (vol. i. No. 448) of Hugenbach and\r\nOrelli, there is published another Roman tablet found in Switzerland (at\r\nGebistorf, near Windisch), bearing the name of a Legionary physician.\r\nThe inscription states that Atticus Patronus erected this tablet to\r\nTITUS CLAUDIUS HYMNUS, physician to the twenty-first Legion, and to\r\nClaudia Quieta, his wife.[404]\r\n\r\n   TI CLAVDIO HYMNO\r\n   MEDICO. LEG. XXI.\r\n  CLAVDIÆ QUIETÆ EIUS\r\n   ATTICUS. PATRONUS.\r\n\r\nOrelli gives in the same work (vol. ii. No. 4996), another tablet found\r\nat Salon, in which a third physician to a legion is named; the tablet\r\nbeing erected by M. BESIUS TERTULLUS, physician of the eleventh Legion,\r\nto the memory of his “hospes,” Papiria Pyrallis.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to a passage in Vegetius, showing in relation to\r\nthe government of the Roman medical staff, that the medical officers as\r\nwell as their patients were both placed under the control of the Præfect\r\nof the Camp, to whose multifarious duties, these, among other matters,\r\npertained. “Praeterea aegri contubernales, et medici a quibus curantur,\r\nexpensae etiam ad ejus industriam pertinebant.”[405] Vegetius does not\r\nallude to the existence of any special sick quarters; but a writer of\r\nthe second century, who lived under Trajan and Hadrian, Hyginus\r\nGromaticus, in his essay “De Castrametatione,”[406] in laying down the\r\nproportions and measurements of the different parts of a Roman camp,\r\ndescribes the proper situation in it for the Hospital or\r\n“Valetudinarium.” This observation of Hyginus is interesting as far as\r\nregards the probable date of the first institution of camp hospitals;\r\nfor we have no allusion to them in Polybius’ earlier account of the\r\ndifferent points and parts of a Roman camp of his day; and even in the\r\nfirst century of our era, when Tacitus describes Germanicus as visiting\r\nand encouraging the wounded soldiers under his command, he uses such an\r\nexpression, “circumire saucios” as to lead to the supposition, that the\r\ninvalids in the Roman camp were still, like the old Homeric heroes, laid\r\nup in their own tents.[407] Indeed, Lampridius speaks of the Emperor\r\nAlexander Severus in the third century, still visiting his sick soldiers\r\nin their tents (aegrotantes ipse visitavit per tentoria milites).[408]\r\nLet me add, that medical stores appear, as we might expect, to have been\r\ncarried with the imperial armies. At least in the war conducted by\r\nGermanicus against Arminius, we are told by Tacitus, that in one of\r\ntheir contests with the German army, the Roman troops lost their\r\nintrenching tools, tents, and remedies or dressings for the wounded\r\n(fomenta sauciis);[409] and subsequently we find Agrippina the wife of\r\nthe Roman general, distributing gratuitously among the soldiers, clothes\r\nto the needy, and dressings to the wounded (militibusque, ut quis inops\r\naut saucius, vestem et fomenta dilargita est).[410] We have the\r\ntransport of the wounded sick sometimes spoken of; as, for example, when\r\nTempanius leads back his victorious troops from the Volscian war;[411]\r\nbut the only instance in which, as far as I remember, any special\r\ndescription of ambulance is mentioned, occurs in Hirtius’\r\n_Commentaries_, where he tells us that, after the battle fought near\r\nRuspina, Labienus ordered his wounded to be carried to Adrumentum, bound\r\nin waggons (saucios suos jubet in plostris deligatos Adrumentum\r\ndeportari).[412] The passage should more probably read “plostris\r\ndecubitos.”\r\n\r\nThe remarks which I have hitherto made refer only to the medical staff\r\nand organisation of the Roman army. If, however, as the preceding facts\r\ntend to show, the Roman troops were furnished with a medical staff,\r\nthere is, _a priori_, every probability that the Roman fleet was\r\nsimilarly provided. The contingencies, however, of a naval, as compared\r\nwith a military life, render the preservation of such monumental proofs\r\nas we have already adduced in relation to the existence of army medical\r\nofficers much less likely in relation to the existence of medical\r\nofficers in the fleet. Indeed I am only aware of the discovery of one\r\nancient tablet referring to the naval medical service. In his late\r\nsplendid work on the Latin inscriptions found in the kingdom of Naples,\r\nMommsen has given a careful copy of the tablet in question.[413] The\r\ninscription upon it was first, I believe, published by Marini.[414] The\r\ntablet itself, which is now placed in the antiquarian collection at\r\nDresden, was originally discovered in the Elysian fields, near Baiæ; and\r\nconsequently in the vicinity of the famous _Pontus Julius_, and the\r\nstation of the imperial Misenian fleet. The inscription on the stone\r\nbears that M. SATRIUS LONGINUS, physician to the three-banked ship or\r\ntrirem, the CUPID,[415] and those or the heirs of those freed by Julia\r\nVenerias, his wife, erected the tablet to the manes of this deserving\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n       D.        M\r\n      IVLIÆ VENERIÆ.\r\n    M. SATRIUS LONGIN\r\n  MEDIC. DVPL. III. CVPID\r\n  ET. IVLIA VENERIA LIBER\r\n      HER. BEN. MER\r\n          FECER\r\n\r\nIn the preceding inscription LONGINUS is designated _Medicus\r\nDuplicarius_; the term duplicarius in this as other inscriptions\r\nsignifying that, by the length or superiority of his service, he was\r\nentitled to double pay and rewards. The “duplex stupendium” and “duplex\r\nfrumentum” is repeatedly alluded to by Varro, Livy, Virgil, and other\r\nclassical authors, as a military reward accorded to the more deserving\r\nsoldiers and officers of the army; and the corresponding adjective\r\n“_duplicarius_” not unfrequently occurs in old Roman inscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous page it has been stated that nowhere in the Roman\r\nclassics does there exist any distinct allusion to physicians or\r\nsurgeons as forming a regular part of the staff of the Roman army. There\r\nare several references, however, in ancient medical and classical\r\nauthors to the fact of medical men being placed in professional\r\nattendance upon Roman Senators,[416] Consuls,[417] and Emperors during\r\nthe course of their military campaigns. Thus Galen tells us that he\r\nhimself was summoned in this last capacity to attend upon the Emperors\r\nM. Aurelius and L. Verus at Apuleia during their proposed campaign\r\nagainst some of the German tribes.[418]\r\n\r\nVarious fragmentary notices exist regarding the physicians who attended\r\nupon those Roman Emperors who visited Britain. A medical author (whom\r\nGalen often quotes), Scribonius Largus, has left a valued therapeutical\r\nwork, _De Compositione Medicamentorum_. This work was written, as we are\r\ninformed in the preface to it, when the author was absent from Rome, and\r\ndeprived of the greater part of his library. In his _History of\r\nMedicine_, Sprengel states, but I know not on what precise authority,\r\nthat the work in question was composed by Largus when he was absent with\r\nthe Emperor Claudius during his short campaign into England.[419] Our\r\ncountryman, Sir Thomas Browne, makes a similar statement. In his\r\n_Hydriotaphia_, when discoursing on the want of Roman notices regarding\r\nthe state, habits, etc., of the ancient Britons, he observes, “We much\r\ndeplore the loss of that letter which Cicero expected or received from\r\nhis brother Quintus, as a resolution of British customs; or the accounts\r\nwhich might have been made by Scribonius Largus, the physician\r\naccompanying the Emperor Claudius, who might have discovered that frugal\r\nbit of the old Britons (mentioned by Dion) which, in the bigness of a\r\nbean, could satisfy their hunger.”[420]\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to allude to the disasters which attended\r\nthe Scottish campaign of Severus, and to the imperfect health of the\r\nemperor himself during his invasion of Scotland. The evidence of\r\nHerodian further shows us that during it he was attended by his own\r\nphysicians, and that their conduct after the emperor’s return from\r\nScotland to York, whilst in the highest degree commendable as regards\r\ntheir faith and duty to the emperor, proved the cause of their own\r\ndownfall and destruction. The anxiety of Caracalla for the death of his\r\nfather Severus is well known. We have the testimony of Herodian to the\r\nfact, that while the father and son were living at York, Caracalla at\r\none time attempted to destroy his father with his own hand. The same\r\nhistorian further informs us, that the unhappy son attempted to induce\r\nthe medical attendants of Severus to adopt means to hasten the emperor’s\r\ndeath.[421] He adds further, that in consequence of the court physicians\r\nnot complying with his unrighteous request, Caracalla, immediately after\r\nthe demise of Severus, commenced his reign of bloodshed and terror by\r\nputting to death these recusant physicians of the late emperor.[422]\r\n\r\nIn the retrospect, it affords a strange subject of meditation for us in\r\nthe nineteenth century, to consider that, some fifteen hundred years\r\nago, it thus happened in England, that a number of physicians were\r\nthemselves doomed to death for refusing to pervert their professional\r\ntrust so far as to become the murderers of the royal invalid who had\r\nconfided his health to their care. And the modern physician may look\r\nback with some degree of pride upon the fact, that in an age and at a\r\ncourt where cruelty and corruption held unrestrained sway, some members\r\nof the medical profession at least remained so uncorruptible as to\r\nendanger and sacrifice their own lives rather than tamper with the life\r\nof their patient.[423]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNº I\r\n\r\n  Fig. I\r\n\r\n  Fig. II\r\n\r\n  Fig. III\r\n\r\nNº II\r\n\r\nNº III\r\n\r\nROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.]\r\n\r\nANCIENT ROMAN MEDICINE-STAMPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON THE DISCOVERY, CHARACTERS, ETC., OF ROMAN\r\nMEDICINE STAMPS.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred years ago there were found at Nymegen, in Holland, two\r\nsmall, greenish, flat, square-shaped stones or tablets, each engraved on\r\nits four lateral surfaces or edges with inscriptions, the letters of\r\nwhich were cut incuse and retrograde. In his work on the Roman and other\r\nantiquities of Nymegen,[424] Schmidt, one of the greatest archæologists\r\nof his day, described these two stones; but he confessedly altogether\r\nfailed in interpreting their nature and uses, or in reading the legends\r\ninscribed upon them.\r\n\r\nA few years later, another distinguished Dutch antiquary, Spon of\r\nLeyden, published an account of a third tablet, similar in character to\r\nthe two described by Schmidt;[425] and he suggested that they were\r\nengraved stones, which the ancient pharmacopolists used as lids for\r\ncovering the jars or boxes in which their ointments, oils, or collyria\r\nwere kept.[426]\r\n\r\nSubsequently, during the currency of the last century, Chishull,[427]\r\nCaylus,[428] Walch,[429] Saxe,[430] and Gough,[431] published accounts\r\nof various other stones, analogous in their character to the two first\r\ndiscovered at Nymegen. And, through the labours and interpretations of\r\nthese and other authors, it came at last to be generally admitted among\r\nantiquaries, that the nature of the legends upon the stones in\r\nquestion,—the incuse and retrograde form of their inscriptions,—and\r\nthe localities in which they were found, all proved them to be\r\nmedicine-stamps, employed for the purpose of marking their drugs, by the\r\nRoman doctors, who (some sixteen or seventeen centuries ago) practised\r\nat the various stations throughout Europe, that were in those olden\r\ntimes occupied by the colonists and soldiers of Rome. Latterly, since\r\nthe beginning of the present century, various additional examples of\r\nsimilar Roman medicine-stamps have been discovered at different old\r\nRoman towns and stations in France, Germany, etc., and described by\r\nTochon,[432] Sichel,[433] Duchalais,[434] Dufour,[435] and others.\r\n\r\nThese Roman medicine-stamps all agree in their general characters. They\r\nusually consist of small quadrilateral or oblong pieces, of a greenish\r\nschist and steatite, engraved on one or more of their edges or borders.\r\nThe inscriptions are in small capital Roman letters, cut retrograde and\r\nintagliate (like the letters on modern seals and stamps), and\r\nconsequently reading on the stone itself from right to left, but making\r\nan impression, when stamped upon wax or any other similar plastic\r\nmaterial, which reads from left to right. The inscriptions themselves\r\ngenerally first contain (and that repeated on each side) the name of the\r\nmedical practitioner to whom the stamp pertained; then the name of some\r\nspecial medicine, or medical formula; and, lastly, the disease or\r\ndiseases for which that medicine was prescribed. In a few instances, the\r\nmodes and frequency of using the medicine are added. In some instances,\r\nthe designation of the medicine, and of the disease for which it is\r\nintended, are alone given. Perhaps still more frequently, when the\r\nnumber of items is limited, the name of the medical practitioner only\r\nappears, along with the name of some special medicinal preparation or\r\nremedy prepared or sold by him. And sometimes the stamps present merely\r\nthe appellation of the medicine alone, without either the name of the\r\npractitioner who vended it, or the name of the disease against which it\r\nwas supposed to be efficacious.\r\n\r\nTo this brief description one more curious fact remains to be\r\nadded,—namely, that in almost all, if not in all, the Roman\r\nmedicine-stamps hitherto discovered, the medicines inscribed upon them\r\nare drugs for affections of the eye and its appendages; and the\r\ndiseases, when specified upon them, are always ophthalmic diseases.\r\nHence it may, with great probability, be concluded, that either these\r\nstamps were used by oculists alone, or they were used by the general\r\nmedical practitioner in marking his eye-medicines only. On this account\r\nsome authors have not inaptly described them under the special\r\ndesignation of Roman Ophthalmic or Oculist stamps.\r\n\r\nThe number of the stamps that have already been discovered amply proves\r\nthat ophthalmic diseases must have been extremely frequent in the sites\r\nof the old Roman colonies spread throughout western Europe; and although\r\nonly three such oculist-stamps are as yet described as having been found\r\nwithin the confines of Italy itself,[436] yet the frequent references to\r\nindividual oculists at Rome by Celsus, Galen, and others, and the\r\nelaborate descriptions of eye-diseases left us by the various Greek and\r\nRoman medical authors, who practised in the Eternal City during the time\r\nof the empire, alike testify to the fact, that these diseases were also\r\nsufficiently common in the Roman capital, and that many of the\r\nfellow-citizens of Horace could probably personally apply the well-known\r\ndescription which the poet gives of himself:—\r\n\r\n  Hic oculis ego nigra meis Collyria lippus\r\n  Illinere.\r\n\r\nGalen, Celsus, Ætius, Paulus Ægineta, etc., all describe the different\r\ndiseases of the eye with care and minuteness; and the Roman\r\npractitioners had evidently studied these affections, and their specific\r\ndistinctions, with no small degree of attention. In modern times medical\r\nliterature has been enriched with more complete and elaborate monographs\r\nupon the diseases of the eye, than upon the diseases of any other single\r\norgan of the body. But, perhaps, few of these monographs describe a\r\nlarger number of ophthalmic diseases than was professed to be known and\r\ndiscriminated in those distant times when Galen wrote and practised.\r\nThis author, in the 16th chapter of his book, entitled _Introductio seu\r\nMedicus_ enumerates and defines nosologically not less than one hundred\r\nand twenty-four diseases to which the eye and its appendages are\r\nliable.[437]\r\n\r\nIn the management of these diseases of the eye, the Roman practitioners\r\nused, as we shall afterwards see, bleeding, antiphlogistics,\r\nscarification, and other appropriate constitutional and local treatment.\r\nBut the practical part of their treatises, referring to ophthalmic\r\naffections, is specially loaded with collyria—professedly of use in\r\nalmost every stage of every disease of the eye.[438] Galen speaks of\r\nAsclepiades describing in his works a plentiful forest of collyria\r\n(_collyriorum silva_).[439] In his book, _De Compositione Medicamentorum\r\nsecundum Locos_, Galen has himself left us formulæ for upwards of two\r\nhundred of the ancient collyria. Ætius gives as great, if not a greater\r\nnumber. The “Opus de Compositione Medicamentorum” of Myrepsus contains\r\nrecipes for eighty-seven ophthalmic collyria; and the works of\r\nScribonius Largus, Celsus, Actuarius, Oribasius, Alexander Trallianus,\r\nMarcellus, Paulus Ægineta, etc., present us with abundance of formulæ\r\nfor the same class of preparations.\r\n\r\nThese collyria were composed of very various,[440] and in some instances\r\nof very numerous, ingredients. But most of them which had attained any\r\ngreat degree of reputation, seem (like the compound formulæ, or\r\nprescriptions in our modern pharmacopœias), to have each passed under\r\na short specific name, by which they were no doubt readily and generally\r\nrecognised by the profession, and perhaps also by the public, in those\r\nancient times. The specific appellations of the individual collyria were\r\nderived from different sources.\r\n\r\nSome of them were known under the names of the oculists who invented or\r\nemployed them. Thus Galen gives recipes for the collyria of Asclepiades,\r\nof Philoxenis, of Capiton, of Zoilus, of Cassius, of Sosandrus, of\r\nPhaedrus, of Syneros, of Hermeius, of Erasistratus, of Marcus, of\r\nAntonius Musa; the collyrium of Sergius, the Babylonian oculist; the\r\ncollyrium of Philip of Cæsarea; and many others.[441] Occasionally the\r\nappellation under which the collyria were known was derived from some of\r\ntheir more marked physical properties, as the “collyrium _Chloron_\r\nappellatum,” from the green colour of the preparation; the _Cirrhon_,\r\nfrom its yellowish tint; _Euchron_, from its agreeable hue (a colore\r\nbono dictum); the collyrium _Cygnus_, from its white or swan-like\r\nhue;[442] the _Aromaticum_, from its pleasant odour; and so forth. One\r\nor other of the principal ingredients entering into its composition\r\nseems to have given the name under which other collyria were known, as\r\nthe _Nardinum_, from its containing spikenard; the collyrium\r\n_Diasmyrnes_ (δια, with, and σμυρνα, myrrh), from its\r\ncontaining myrrh; the _Diarrhodon_, from its containing roses, etc.\r\nOccasionally the collyrium seems to have derived its name and fame from\r\nsome great person whom it had been fortunate enough to benefit or to\r\ncure. Thus, for example, Galen gives a recipe for the collyrium which\r\nPhlorus used in the case of Antonia, the mother of Drusus; for the\r\n“_collyrium Harmatium_,” which King Ptolemy used, etc. One was termed\r\n_Achariston_, from its cheapness; and this collyrium repeatedly occurs\r\non the oculist-seals. Another was termed _Atimeton_, from its supposed\r\ngreat value. But perhaps the most common mode of appellation was the use\r\nof some recommendatory name, advertising the supposed high qualities of\r\nthe drug. Thus the old Greek and Roman authors give various species of\r\nthe collyrium _Monohemeron_,—so named from its being alleged to effect\r\na cure in a single day; others are designated the _Miraculum_, the\r\n_Mysterium_, the Nectar collyrium (_Nectarium_); the Royal (_Collyrium\r\nBasilicon_); the Royal Indian (_Collyrium Indicum Regale_); the\r\ngold-like (_Isochryson_); the divine (_Isotheon_), etc. etc. And lastly,\r\na collyrium was often known under some high-sounding but unmeaning name,\r\nsuch as the collyrium _Olympus_, _Proteus_, _Phœnix_, _Phyon_,\r\n_Sphærion_, _Philadelphium_, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nUnder such designations the principal collyria of the Roman oculists\r\nwere known and used (like the one invented and boasted of by Galen) “per\r\nomnes gentes quibus imperant Romani;” and it is under such special\r\nappellations that we find these different collyria mentioned in the\r\ninscriptions engraved upon the old oculist-stamps, which have been\r\nturned up among the ruins of their ancient colonial stations.\r\n\r\nAbove sixty Roman oculist-stamps have now been discovered in different\r\nparts of Western Europe, but particularly in Germany, France, and\r\nHolland. Some time ago one was found about ten miles east of Edinburgh;\r\nand it is principally with the view of describing this, and along with\r\nit the other specimens that have been detected in the British Islands,\r\nthat I have ventured to draw up the present imperfect essay. I have been\r\nthe more induced to do so because this Scottish stamp is remarkable,\r\nboth as being found on almost the very frontier of the ancient Roman\r\nempire, and as being one of the most perfect yet discovered. Besides, I\r\nentertain a strong hope that such a publication as the present may\r\nperhaps be fortunate enough to lead, through the zeal of some members of\r\nthe profession, to the detection in this country of additional examples\r\nof these curious remains of our Roman medical predecessors.\r\n\r\nIn treating, in the following sections, of the individual Roman\r\nmedicine-stamps that have been found in Great Britain, I shall begin\r\nwith some account, first, of the specimen found at Tranent, and of two\r\nother undescribed specimens contained in the British Museum. Afterwards\r\nI shall notice the other similar stones or tablets that have been\r\nhitherto brought to light in these islands, in an order chronologically\r\nin reference to the dates at which they severally happened to be\r\nrediscovered in those localities in which they had lain concealed and\r\nburied for many a long century. And lastly, I shall attempt to offer\r\nsome general remarks upon the probable uses of the medicine-stamps; the\r\nnature of the drugs and the character of the diseases mentioned upon\r\nthem; the names, status, and residences of their proprietors; and\r\nvarious other correlative points.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. I.—FOUND AT TRANENT.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish specimen of Roman medicine-stamp, to which I have adverted\r\nin the preceding page, was discovered some years ago at Tranent in East\r\nLothian, not far distant from the old, and doubtlessly in former times\r\nextensive, Roman settlement or _Municipium_ at Inveresk.[443] The stamp\r\nnow belongs to the Museum of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nIt was presented to the Museum by the late Mr. Drummond Hay, formerly\r\none of the Secretaries of the Society. From Mr. Hay’s notes it appears\r\nthat it was found amid a quantity of broken tiles, brick, and other\r\ndebris of an old (and probably Roman) house, near the church of Tranent.\r\nFor many years after being deposited in the Antiquarian Museum its\r\ncharacter remained undiscovered, till the present excellent Secretary of\r\nthe Society, my esteemed friend Mr. Daniel Wilson, was led, in reading\r\nthe descriptions of other similar stamps, to ascertain its true\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe stamp itself is, as usual, formed out of a greenish-coloured\r\nsteatite. The stone is of the figure of a parallelogram, nearly two and\r\na half inches in length, and with inscriptions cut upon two of its\r\nsides. There is a roundish projection at either extremity of the stone,\r\nas seen in the accompanying lithograph (Plate I., No. I., Figs. 1, 2,\r\n3), where the stone and letters of the two inscriptions are, in every\r\nrespect, faithfully copied from the original as to form and size. The\r\nletters are, as in all other similar medicine-stamps, cut incuse and\r\nreversed, so as to read from left to right when the inscription was\r\nstamped upon any impressible material. Fig. 2 shows one of the\r\ninscriptions as it appears cut intagliate upon the stone. Fig. 3\r\npresents an accurate copy of this inscription as it is seen when stamped\r\nupon wax. Fig. 1 is an equally faithful copy of the second inscription\r\nplaced on the opposite side of the stone. It will be observed that, as\r\nin the original, the size of the lettering varies on the two sides.\r\n\r\nThe lettering on the two sides (1 and 2) runs thus, as it stands\r\ninscribed upon the stone:—\r\n\r\n  1. LVALLATINIEVODESADCI\r\n     CATRICESETASPRITUDIN\r\n\r\n  2. LVALLATINIAPALOCRO\r\n     CODESADDIATHESIS\r\n\r\nThe two inscriptions read as follows, when we separate the individual\r\nwords composing them from each other:—\r\n\r\n  1. L VALLATINI EVODES AD CI-\r\n     CATRICES ET ASPRITUDIN\r\n\r\n  2. L VALLATINI APALOCRO-\r\n     CODES AD DIATHESIS.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to interpret each of these inscriptions in detail,\r\nsupplying the elisions and contractions which exist in almost all Roman\r\ninscriptions; but which are less in this seal than in most others.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. L(_ucii?_) VALLATINI EVODES AD CICATRICES ET\r\nASP_e_RITUDIN_es_.—_Lucius Vallatinus’ Evodes for cicatrices and\r\ngranulations._\r\n\r\nSeveral of the collyria derived, as I have already observed, their\r\ndesignation from some special physical character. The present instance\r\nis an example in point, the appellation _Evodes_ (εὐώδες) being derived\r\nfrom the pleasant odour (εὐ, well, and ὄζω, I smell) of the composition.\r\nMarcellus, in his work _De Medicamentis_, specially praises the\r\ncollyrium known under the name of _Evodes_; and that too in the class of\r\neye-diseases mentioned on the Tranent seal. For, in his collection of\r\nremedies for removing ulcers, cicatrices, etc., of the eyes and eyelids,\r\nhe recommends (to use his own words) “præcipue hoc quod quidam\r\nDiasmyrnon, nonnulli _Evodes_, quia boni odoris est, nominant.” And he\r\ndirects the _Evodes_ to be dissolved and diluted in water, and\r\nintroduced into the eyes with a probe, or after inverting the eyelid,\r\nwhen it was used with the view of extenuating recent cicatrices of the\r\neyes, and removing granulations of the eyelids,—“ex aqua autem ad\r\ncicatrices recentes extenuendas, et palpebrarum asperitudinem tollendam\r\nteri debet, et subjecto specillo aut inversa palpebra, oculis\r\ninseri.”[444]\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus had previously described, in nearly the same words,\r\nthe collyrium,—“quod quidam εὐώδες vocant,” and its uses in recent\r\ncicatrices and granulations, etc. Both these authors give the same\r\nrecipe for the composition of the _Evodes_,—viz. pompholyx, burnt\r\ncopper, saffron, myrrh, hematites, opium, and other ingredients, rubbed\r\ndown in Chian wine. Its agreeable odour was probably owing to a\r\nconsiderable quantity of spikenard being used in its composition.[445]\r\nGalen gives two other collyria, of a different composition, and for\r\nother affections, as known at his time under the same name of\r\n_Evodes_,—the one termed the “_Evodes_ of Zosimus,” the other the\r\n“diasmyrnon _Evodes_ of Syneros.”[446]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. L. VALLATINI APALOCROCODES AD DIATHESIS.—_L. Vallatinus’ mild\r\nCrocodes for affections of the eyes._\r\n\r\nThe term diathesis in this inscription is used in a different sense from\r\nthat in which we now employ the same word in modern medicine. At the\r\npresent day we apply the term diathesis to designate the tendency or\r\npredisposition to some special disease, or class of diseases. In the\r\ntimes of the Roman physicians, it was often used as synonymous with\r\ndisease itself; and in the Latin translations of the Greek texts of\r\nGalen, Aetius, etc., it is hence rendered usually by the general word\r\n“affectus,” “affectio,” etc. The first sentence in Paulus Ægineta’s\r\nchapter on Ophthalmic Diseases, affords an instance in point: “Quum\r\ndolores vehementiores in oculis fiunt, considera ex quanam affectione\r\n(διαθεσει) oculum dolere contingit.”[447] Thus, also, the\r\n_Evodes_ of Zosimus (to which I have before alluded) is entered by Galen\r\nas a remedy simply against “dolores et recentes affectus,” according to\r\nthe Latin translation of Kühn,—“προς περιωδυνιας και προσφατους\r\nδιαθεσεις,” according to the original Greek text. He uses diathesis, in\r\nfact, as a general term for eye-diseases. Thus, when speaking of\r\ndiseases of the eye in general, he observes,—“Scripsi omnia quæ necesse\r\nest Medicum de oculorum affectibus (διαθεσεων) nosse.”[448]\r\nIn its last syllable in the inscription on the seal, diathesIS stands\r\ninstead of the Roman accusative diathesES, or the Greek accusative\r\ndiathesEIS. This usage, however, is not without classical authority.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium mentioned in the prescription (the _Crocodes_) derives its\r\ndesignation from its containing the crocus, or saffron, as one of its\r\nprincipal ingredients.\r\n\r\nIn describing the therapeutic effects of the crocus, Dioscorides\r\nmentions, as its first special use, its efficacy in “fluxions of the\r\neyes”—(oculorum fluxiones cohibet).[449]\r\n\r\nPliny, in enumerating the qualities of the crocus, begins by observing\r\nthat it has a discutient effect upon all inflammations, but chiefly on\r\nthose of the eyes (discutit inflammationes omnes quidem, sed oculorum\r\nmaxime); and in speaking of its combinations he tells us that it has\r\ngiven a name to one collyrium (collyrio uno etiam nomen dedit).[450] But\r\nit entered into the composition of very many of the ancient\r\neye-medicines, and more than one of these passed under the name of\r\n_Crocodes_, as in the inscription on the seal. Galen, in his list of\r\neye-remedies, gives the recipe for the composition of a _Crocodes_\r\ncollyrium for epiphoræ, pains, and affections (διαθεσεις) from\r\nwounds of the eye.[451] He discusses the composition also of the\r\naromatic _Crocodes_ of Heraclides, and the oxydercic _Crocodes_ of\r\nAsclepius, etc.[452] When describing, in another part, the remedies for\r\nulcers of the eyes, he mentions a collyrium containing crocus, and\r\nadds, “habet autem hoc plurimum in se crocum, unde etiam _Croceum_\r\n(κροκωδες) appellatur.”[453]\r\n\r\nCelsus,[454] Alexander Trallianus,[455] and Paulus Ægineta[456] give\r\nrecipes for eye collyria, under the name of diacrocus (δια κροκος).\r\n\r\nI have not yet alluded to the expression APALO, standing before\r\n_Crocodes_. This expression presents the only difficulty in reading the\r\ninscription; and various suggestions might be offered in regard to its\r\nexplanation. But it seems most probable that it was used as a qualifying\r\nterm to the _Crocodes_. Several of the collyria have the Latin adjective\r\n“lene,” and “leve,” placed before them, in order to certify their mild\r\nnature. Scribonius Largus gives a whole division of collyria, headed\r\n“Collyria composita levia.” Aetius has a chapter, “De Lenibus\r\nCollyriis.” The expression _apalo_, as a part and prefix to _Crocodes_,\r\nwould seem to indicate the same quality in the crocodes sold by\r\nVallatinus, the term being in all likelihood derived from the Greek\r\nadjective απαλος, or the corresponding Latin adjective _apalus_\r\n(mild, soft). Homer frequently uses the word as signifying soft,\r\ndelicate, and especially as applied to different parts of the body (see\r\n_Iliad_, book iii. 371; xvii. 123, etc.); and, indeed, both Aetius and\r\nPaulus Ægineta employ the Greek adjective therapeutically in the sense\r\nof mild, and as applied to collyria. In the treatment of acute\r\ninflammatory ulcers of the eye, after inculcating the usual\r\nantiphlogistic treatment, Aetius adds, “collyria vero tenera (απαλα)\r\nulcerate oculo infundantur.”[457]\r\n\r\nWhen treating of carbuncles and carcinoma of the eye, Paulus Ægineta\r\nobserves that the affection may be alleviated “by the injection of\r\nsoothing (_tenera_, απαλα) collyria, such as the _Spodiacum_,\r\n_Severianum_, and the like.”[458] And again, when giving his formulæ for\r\ndifferent collyria in another part of his works, he applies the term\r\nαπαλον to the collyrium _Diathalium_, or collyrium made from olive\r\nleaves (Διαθαλιον απαλον), upon the same principle, and\r\nevidently with the same signification, as the word is used in the\r\nTranent stamp, as applied to the collyrium _Crocodes_.[459]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Birch for the impressions of two\r\nunpublished oculist-stamps, contained in the British Museum. Their forms\r\nand inscriptions are represented in Plate I., Nos. II. and III.; and I\r\nshall describe them under these numbers. They are supposed to have\r\nformed part of the collection of Sir Hans Sloane; but no note exists as\r\nto the precise locality in which they were discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. II.—CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nThis large stamp consists (Plate I., No. II.[460]) of a flat\r\nquadrilateral stone, about an inch and a half broad, and engraved upon\r\nthree of its sides. A portion of one corner of the stone is broken off.\r\nThe probable deficiency which is thus produced in one of the\r\ninscriptions is supplied in this, and in some other similar instances in\r\nthe sequel, by Italic letters. The three inscriptions read as follow:—\r\n\r\n  1. SEX: JUL: SEDATI\r\n     CROCOD PACCIAN\r\n\r\n  2. SEX: JUL: SEDATI CRO-\r\n     CODES DIALEPIDOS\r\n\r\n  3. (_Sex_): JUL: SEDATI CRO-\r\n     (_cod_)ES AD DIATHES\r\n\r\nThe name of the oculist—SEXTUS JULIUS SEDATUS—is imperfect on the\r\nthird or broken side, the prænomen “SEX” being wanting on that side in\r\nthe first line, and the middle syllable “COD” of the word Crocodes being\r\nalso wanting, from the same cause, in the second line.\r\n\r\nThe restored reading of this third side—viz., SEXTI JULII SEDATI\r\nCROCODES AD DIATHES_es_—need not be dwelt upon, as it is so very\r\nsimilar to that on one side of the Tranent stone. The other two sides\r\ncontain the names of two new varieties of crocodes.\r\n\r\nOne of these varieties—the CROCODES PACCIANUM—received its name from\r\nPaccius, a celebrated Roman medical practitioner, who either invented\r\nthis special collyrium, or brought it into repute. Paccius, who lived\r\nabout the commencement of the Christian era, is said to have amassed a\r\nfortune by the sale of a secret nostrum. At his death he bequeathed the\r\nprescription for it to the Emperor Tiberius, who placed a copy of it in\r\nthe various public libraries.[461] In the list of his ophthalmic\r\nmedicines, Galen gives formulæ for various collyria invented by Paccius,\r\nsuch as the “_Sphragis Paccii_,”[462] “_Asclepiadeum Paccii_,”[463]\r\n“_Collyrium_ ex terra Samia _Paccii Ophthalmici_ ad affectus intensos\r\n(επιτεταμενας διαθεσεις).”[464] Galen does not give any recipe\r\nfor the _Crocodes_ of Paccius; but it was evidently a collyrium duly\r\nesteemed at the time in which he wrote; for, in his chapter on ulcers of\r\nthe eyes, he specially names the “CROCODES PACCIANUM,”[465] and\r\nrecommends its use in cases in which the accompanying inflammation has\r\nalready ceased, and at the stage when a stimulating application becomes\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe other variety of crocodes used by Sedatus is the CROCODES\r\nDIALEPIDOS. A formula for _Dialepidos_ is given by Marcellus,[466] with\r\nthe crocus as the first ingredient mentioned in its composition. The\r\n_Dialepidos_ derived its name from its containing the scales—(λεπιδες)\r\nof burnt copper, or the black peroxide of that metal,—a preparation\r\nwhich Dioscorides (lib. v. cap. 89) describes as useful in eye-diseases;\r\nand which Galen declares to be a “medicamentum multo utilissimum,” vol.\r\nxii. p. 223.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. III.—CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nA second Roman medicine-stamp is (as I have already stated, p. 244)\r\ncontained in the British Museum. The stone is small and broken, and only\r\nengraved on one side (see Plate I., No. III.) The inscription does not\r\ninclude, as usual, the name of the oculist who possessed and employed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe lettering on this stamp is very distinct, except in one particular.\r\nIt is doubtful whether the third last letter is intended for an “L,” or\r\nstands, as suggested by Mr. Way, for an “I,” with a period-point after\r\nit, thus—“I.” An inspection of the stamp itself has impressed me with\r\nthe belief, that the doubtful letter is truly an “L;” and if so, the\r\ninscription would run:—\r\n\r\n  COLLYR. P. CLOC.\r\n\r\nOr, to read it in an extended form, COLLYR_ium_ P_ost_ C_a_L_iginem_\r\nOC_ulorum_—_Collyrium for blindness of the eyes._ And I may observe\r\nthat several of the prescriptions found on these medicine-stamps are\r\ncollyria professing to be useful against and after (_ad_ and _post_)\r\n_caliginem_.\r\n\r\nBut if the doubtful letter is an “I,” and not an L, then the\r\ninscription, when extended, may be read as follows:—COLLYR_ium_ P_ost_\r\nCI_catrices_ OC_ulorum_, or, “_Collyrium after cicatrices of the eyes._”\r\n\r\nThe P may stand for P_ro_, and not for P_ost_; but I am not aware of any\r\ninstance of the former preposition (_Pro_) occurring in these\r\ninscriptions, while several examples of this use of the latter\r\npreposition (_Post_) are known. An instance of this use of the\r\npreposition _Post_ will be found in the sequel, in Stamp No. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. IV.—FOUND AT COLCHESTER.\r\n\r\nThe first Roman medicine-stamp discovered in Great Britain was described\r\nabout a hundred and thirty years ago by Mr. Chishull in the learned\r\n“Dissertatio De Nummo ϹΚωΠΙ,” which he addressed to Haym, and\r\nwhich this last-mentioned author has published in the preface to his\r\nsecond volume of the _Tesoro Brittanico_.\r\n\r\nThe stamp had been found some years previously at Colchester, a\r\nwell-known and extensive Roman colonial station. Mr. Chishull believed\r\nit to have belonged to some old Roman Iatraliptes, or curer by\r\nointments.[467] The following is a copy of the inscription on this\r\nColchester stamp, as given by Chishull:—\r\n\r\n  1. QIULMURRANIMELI\r\n     NUMADCLARITATEM.\r\n\r\n  2. QIULMURRANISTAGIU\r\n     MOPOBALSAMATADCAP.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Chishull interpreted these inscriptions thus:—“Quinti Julii\r\nMurranii Melinum, sive ex malis cotoneis oleum, ad claritatem oculorum\r\nfaciens. Iterumque, Quinti Julii Murranii stagium opobalsamatum, sive\r\nmyrrhæ oleum opobalsamo permixtum, ad cap. _i.e._, ad caput medicandum\r\nutile.”\r\n\r\nIn this interpretation, Mr. Chishull seems to have fallen into more than\r\none important error, as we shall endeavour to show by considering the\r\ntwo inscriptions in detail.\r\n\r\n1. Q. JULII MURRANI MELINUM AD CLARITATEM.—_The Melinum of Q.\r\n(Quintus?) Julius Murranus, for clearness of vision._\r\n\r\nTwo or three varieties of the collyrium _Melinum_ are given by\r\nGalen.[468] Thus, in his list of collyria he gives formulæ for the\r\n_Melinum_ of Lucius; for the _Melinum atarachum_ (_i.e._ against the\r\ntaraxis); and for a _Melinum delicatum_, fitted for those who could not\r\nbear the irritation of any powerful medicament.\r\n\r\nDifferent opinions have been expressed in relation to the origin and\r\nsignification of the term _Melinum_. Walch,[469] like Chishull, derives\r\nthe term from “malum” (μῆλον), an apple, supposing it to be the\r\nprincipal ingredient in the collyrium. And certainly Pliny and Paulus\r\nÆgineta speak of an oil termed _melinum_,[470] being made from the\r\nquince (Malum Cydoneum); and the flower of the plant is described by\r\nPliny as useful in inflammation of the eyes. But no “malum” enters into\r\nthe composition of any of the three _Melina_ collyria, which I have\r\nreferred to in Galen.\r\n\r\nThe best variety of alum seems, in ancient times, to have come from the\r\nisland of Melos; and, according to Pliny, this drug was consequently\r\ntermed _Melinum_. It was believed to be useful in discussing\r\ngranulations of the eyes (oculorum scabritias extenuat).[471] Hence Saxe\r\n(p. 29) and Tochon (p. 18) have conjectured that the alum or _Melinum_\r\nof Pliny was the _Melinum_ which has been found inscribed on several\r\noculist-stamps. But again, the same objection holds,—namely, that in\r\nnone of the collyria _Melina_ of Galen was alum a component ingredient.\r\n\r\nIn his observations, however, upon the different forms of emplastra (and\r\nmany of which were named _Melina_), Galen gives a sufficient explanation\r\nof the origin of this term as it was applied to plasters; and the same\r\nholds, no doubt, also in reference to its application to collyria.\r\nAccording to his own explanation, it was a term significant merely of\r\nthe colour of the resulting medicament, like the green, brown, etc.,\r\nplasters and collyria, named _chloron_, _cirrhon_, etc. etc. Gesner,\r\nCooper, and other philologists, lay down _Melinum_ as an adjective,\r\nmeaning yellow. And perhaps the term was originally derived from the\r\nyellow colour of the quince or μῆλον, in the same way as the _citrine_\r\n(_Unguentum Citrinum_), which is still common in modern pharmaceutical\r\nlanguage, was a term originally derived from the yellow colour of the\r\n_citron_ (κιτριον) or lemon, and was applied to designate ointments,\r\netc., of that special tint. In further proof of this origin and\r\nsignification of the term _Melinum_, I may add, that, in mixing together\r\nthe ingredients contained in the _collyrium melinum delicatum_ of Galen\r\n(vol. xii. p. 769), I find that a yellow or orange-coloured fluid is the\r\nresult. The yellowish tint of the _emplastra melina_ was, as Galen tells\r\nus, generally, but not always, derived from their containing verdigris,\r\naltered by a moderate boiling with the other component ingredients.[472]\r\nThe collyria _Melina_ of Galen contain ceruse and calamine in their\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThe _Melinum_ is professed, in Murranus’ stamp, to be efficacious for\r\nthe clearing of the eyesight (ad claritatem). The _Melina_ collyria of\r\nGalen are all alleged by him to have effects conducive to this\r\nobject—viz. the removing of cicatrices and calli, and every weakness of\r\nvision (omnem hebetudinem visus).\r\n\r\n2. Q. JULII MURRANI STAGIUM (STACTUM) OPOBALSAMAT_um_ AD\r\nCAP (CAL_igines_).—_Q. Julius Murranus’s Opobalsamic Stactum, or\r\nOpobalsamic Eye-drops, for dimness or blindness._\r\n\r\nMr. Chishull read _Stagium_ instead of _Stactum_, the CT of the latter\r\nword having been mistaken by him for GI. Mr. Forster showed to the\r\nLondon Antiquarian Society,[473] in 1767, a plaster-cast of what was\r\ndoubtlessly this same Colchester stamp, and gave the reading correctly\r\nin the second inscription as Stactum.\r\n\r\nThe Latin designation _Stactum_, analogous to the Greek terms _Stacton_,\r\n_Enstacton_, and derived from the verb σταζω (I drop), denoted any\r\nliquid collyrium, applied by drops into the eye—“collyria enstacta, hoc\r\nest, instillatitia, appellata.”[474]\r\n\r\nA collyrium, with the appellation _Stactum_ or _Staticon_, is described\r\nby Marcellus,[475] Myrepsus,[476] Paulus Ægineta,[477] etc.; and\r\nAetius[478] gives a chapter of collyria under this designation. In this\r\nchapter Aetius describes five collyria _Stactica_; and, of these, four\r\ncontain the Opobalsam[479] as an ingredient, showing the origin and\r\npropriety of the term _Opobalsamatum_ in the inscription on the seal.\r\n\r\nChishull read the last three letters of the inscription CAP, and thought\r\nthat the oil was serviceable for head diseases. But if the inscription\r\nis not really CAL, the P has in all probability been substituted by an\r\nerror of the engraver for L (CAL), an abbreviation for Caligines. In\r\nconfirmation of this opinion, I may remark that the same inscription\r\noccurs at greater length on an oculist-stamp found at Daspich in France;\r\nand in it the _Stactum Opobalsamatum_ is professed to remove\r\n_Caligines_.[480] There is, indeed, little doubt but that Murranus of\r\nColchester vended, of old, his Opobalsamic Eye-drops for the same\r\nalleged purpose. This quality of “visum acuens” is attributed to two out\r\nof the four forms of Opobalsamic Eye-drops mentioned by Aetius. And the\r\n_Stactum_ is (according at least to the testimony of Myrepsus) “ad\r\nacumen visus mirabile admodum.”—P. 660.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. V.—FOUND AT BATH.\r\n\r\nThis stamp was found, in the year 1731, at Bath, a well-known Roman\r\nstation. It was discovered in a cellar in the Abbey-yard. Shortly\r\nafterwards the stamp was exhibited to the Antiquarian Society of London\r\nby Mr. Cutler. Mr. Mitchell of Bristol, who possessed the stone about\r\nthe middle of the last century, submitted it also for examination to the\r\nRoyal Society of London. I have, through Mr. Norman of Bath, and other\r\nfriends in England, attempted to trace out the present proprietor of\r\nthe stamp, with a view of ascertaining more correctly the exact nature\r\nof the inscriptions upon it; but these efforts have been quite\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nMr. Lethieullier presented to the London Antiquarian Society plaster\r\ncasts of the inscriptions on the stamp; and three of these plaster\r\nimpressions of it are still preserved in the London Antiquarian Museum.\r\nThese plaster casts, however, are very imperfect; and the lettering upon\r\nthem is now unfortunately defective at some of those very points that\r\nare otherwise the most difficult to decypher.\r\n\r\nManuscript notices of this Bath medicine-stamp exist in the Minute-books\r\nof the Antiquarian Society for 1744 (vol. iv. p. 210), and for 1757\r\n(vol. viii. p. 29); the last is with an impression taken with ink from\r\nthe inscriptions. For copies of these I am deeply indebted to the polite\r\nkindness of Mr. Akerman, the distinguished secretary to the Society. The\r\noutline in Pl. II., No. V., presents a copy of a rude drawing of the\r\nBath stamp given in the Minute-book of the Antiquarian Society for April\r\n27, 1732.[481] Mr. Akerman has also obligingly furnished me with this\r\nsketch, which is interesting as giving us the form of the stone. On the\r\nexposed sides of this sketch there is given retrograde, as on the\r\noriginal stone, one of the inscriptions. This inscription the engraver\r\nhas entered in the plate, as corrected from the pertaining plaster-cast\r\nin the museum; and below it, in the plate, is a reversed impression of\r\nthis inscription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nº V\r\n\r\nNº VI\r\n\r\nNº VII\r\n\r\nROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.]\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Mr. Gough published, in the _Archæologia_, “Observations on\r\ncertain Stamps or Seals used anciently by the Oculists.”[482] In\r\nthis communication he has given, amongst others, copies of the\r\ninscriptions on the medicine-stamp found at Bath; but without making any\r\nattempt whatever to read and decypher these inscriptions. He appears to\r\nhave seen the stone itself, as he describes it as “square, of a greenish\r\ncast, and perforated.” He presents the following as the legends or\r\ninscriptions on the four sides of the stamp:[483]—\r\n\r\n  1. T. IVNIANI THALASER\r\n     AD CLARITATEM\r\n\r\n  2. T. IVNIANI CRSOMAEL\r\n     IN M AD CLARITATEM\r\n\r\n  3. T. IVNIANI D[symbols]VM\r\n     AD VETERES CICATRICES\r\n\r\n  4. T. IVNIANI HOFSVMAρDV\r\n     EC VMODELICTA AMEDICIS\r\n\r\nThe two first of these inscriptions are given with sufficient\r\ndistinctness and accuracy; and they do not offer any great difficulties\r\nin the way of explanation. But the two last have been copied so\r\nimperfectly,—and, perhaps, so inaccurately,—by Mr. Gough, as to\r\nsurround their meaning with no small degree of uncertainty and doubt.\r\n\r\nIn all of the four inscriptions, the name of the proprietor or oculist,\r\nT(_itus_?) JUNIANUS, is perfectly distinct. The first side reads as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n1. T. JUNIANI THALASSER AD CLARITATEM. _T. Junianus’ Thalasser (or\r\nMarine Collyrium) for clearness of vision._\r\n\r\nThe collyrium _Thalasseros_ (θαλασσερος) is mentioned by several of the\r\nold Greek and Roman authors, who have discussed the subject of diseases\r\nof the eye and collyria, as by Galen,[484] Myrepsus,[485] Aetius,[486]\r\nAlexander Trallianus,[487] and Paulus Ægineta.[488]\r\n\r\nThe name itself—_Thalasseros_—is evidently derived from θαλασση, the\r\nsea. Fuchs, the translator of Myrepsus, avows that he can form no\r\nconjecture as to why the collyrium was termed Thalasseros (quam autem ob\r\ncausam nescio). In Cornarius’ translation of Aetius, it is entered as\r\n“Thalasserum, _hoc est marinum_.” And in all probability it originally\r\nreceived its high-sounding and attractive appellation from the marine\r\ncolour of the preparation, the hue of the collyrium being, as we have\r\nalready seen, sometimes the cause and source of its distinctive\r\nappellation, as in the collyria termed _Melinum_, _Cygnus_, _Cirrhon_,\r\netc. It has been conjectured that the name was imposed upon it in\r\nconsequence of one or other of its ingredients being of marine origin.\r\nBut in none of the formulæ given for it by the authors already named,\r\ndoes any sea ingredient enter into its composition.[489]\r\n\r\nThe object of the _Thalasseros_ in our inscription was to produce\r\nclearness of vision (_ad claritatem_). It was used in vision impaired\r\nfrom cataract (_suffusio_) and other causes. Galen describes the\r\n_Thalasseros_ of Hermophilus as “accomodatum ad suffusiones et ad omnem\r\nhebetudinem visus; facit et ad incipientem suffusionem” (vol. xii. p.\r\n781). Myrepsus assigns to it the powers of “lachrymas retinens, ad\r\ninchoantes suffusiones et nyctalopas, et ad recentem pupillæ\r\ndilatationem” (sect. xxiv. cap. 51). It is adapted, according to\r\nTrallianus, “ad hebetudinem, et incipientes suffusiones; et callos\r\nexterit” (lib. ii. cap. v. p. 175).\r\n\r\n2. T. JUNIANI C_e_R_us_SOMAELINUM AD CLARITATEM.—_T. Junianus’ Leaden_\r\n(?) _Melinum (or Golden Yellow Collyrium) for clearness of vision._\r\n\r\nI have already had occasion to speak of the signification and qualities\r\nof the collyrium named _Melinum_. In the Colchester stamp the _Melinum_\r\nis invested with the same supposed properties as the _Crsomelinum_ in\r\nthe above legend on the Bath seal,—namely, “ad claritatem.”[490]\r\n\r\nThe prefix CRSO, in _Crsomelinum_, admits of more than one\r\ninterpretation. Galen gives four different formulæ for “collyria\r\n_Melina_.” Three of these contain, as one of their ingredients, the\r\n_Cerussa_, or carbonate of lead; and the prefix CRSO may possibly stand\r\nas a contraction for _Cerussa_, implying the presence of this medicine\r\nin the collyrium. And, in relation to this view, it is to be recollected\r\nthat this preparation of lead was, in these ancient times, held in some\r\nesteem as a local application in eye-diseases. Galen recommends it as an\r\nanodyne in pains of the eyes, and as a general astringent and sedative\r\napplication.[491]\r\n\r\nAnother, and perhaps more probable meaning, has been suggested to me by\r\nmy friend M. Sichel. He supposes the CRSO to be a contraction for CHRSO,\r\n_golden_ (from χρυσος, gold), the prefix marking the golden\r\ncolour of this _melinum_, or yellow collyrium. In this way we would have\r\nJunianus retailing his “Golden Yellow Collyrium” to the colonists and\r\nnatives of Bath some sixteen centuries ago. And we all know that “Golden\r\nOintment” for the eyes is an application not by any means unknown to the\r\nmedical practitioners and pharmacopolists of England in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n3. T. JUNIANI DIEXUM AD VET_e_RES CICATRICES.\r\n\r\nIn the above line I give the reading of the third side of the Bath\r\nmedicine-seal, such as it stands copied into the manuscript minute-books\r\nof the Antiquarian Society for 17th November 1757. By turning back to\r\nthe inscription, as cited in a previous page from Gough, it will be seen\r\nthat the three medial letters IEX are in a rude Brittano-Roman\r\ncharacter, which allows us only to guess at their true signification.\r\nUnfortunately, the plaster cast of this side of the stamp does not\r\nhappen to be preserved with the others, so as to enable us to ascertain\r\nthe probability of either reading; and it is more than doubtful whether\r\nthe inscription thus given by these opposed authorities is correctly\r\ncopied, either by Gough, or in the Society’s minute-book. And I believe\r\nI state the general experience of all who have worked at the\r\ndeciphering of Roman and other inscriptions, in observing that the\r\nperplexities connected with the reading of them have often been\r\nproduced, much more by grave errors in the published copies of the\r\ninscriptions, than by actual difficulties in the interpretation of the\r\noriginal, after a true copy has been once obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, by reversing the usual mode of procedure in\r\nsuch investigations, we may perhaps arrive at the probable truth. In\r\nother words, if we consider the disease prescribed for, we may possibly\r\narrive at a knowledge of the drug prescribed. Now the affection on this\r\nside of the Bath stamp is _old cicatrices_ (VETERES CICATRICES). This\r\ndisease, or rather result of disease, is mentioned on various Roman\r\nmedicine-stamps discovered on the continent of Europe, as on examples\r\nfound at Verona, Lillebonne, Ingweiler, and Saint Cheron,[492] and in\r\none which I shall notice in the sequel, lately detected in Ireland. In\r\nall the instances which I have just named, the collyrium indicated on\r\nthe inscriptions as the remedy (VETERES CICATRICES), is the collyrium\r\ntermed DIAMYSOS or DIAMYSUM, which contained, as its principal\r\ningredient, the metallic preparation known under the name of Μισυ, or\r\nMysy, among the ancient medical authors; and Marcellus Empiricus gives a\r\nformula for the formation of a collyrium DIAMYSOS from it. Looking to\r\nthese facts, in relation to other analogous Roman medicine-seals, it\r\nseems not an improbable conjecture that the word on this third side of\r\nthe Bath stamp is the same, perhaps more or less mis-spelt or\r\ncontracted; and consequently, that the whole inscription is T. JUNIANI\r\nDIAMYSUM AD VETERES CICATRICES. The re-discovery of the stamp itself can\r\nalone settle this and other difficulties connected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we judged of the nature of the inscription by the characters of the\r\nletters, as given by Gough, the disputed word might perhaps be more\r\ncorrectly read DRYCUM or DRYXUM. And possibly, in this way, it may\r\nsignify an astringent and detergent collyrium, made from the bark,\r\nacorn, or galls of the DRYS (δρυς) or oak—a tree that held a\r\nplace in the materia medica of Hippocrates, Galen, and the other\r\nancients, and which still maintains its place in our own modern\r\nPharmacopœias. Dioscorides, and the other old pharmaceutical\r\nauthorities, describe the _Drys_ or Quercus as possessing desiccant,\r\nastringent, and other properties; and they attribute especially these\r\npowers to the gall excrescences that so often grow upon it, and which\r\nthey incorrectly deemed the fruit of this tree. According to Oribasius,\r\nthe gall of the oak—“siccat, repercutit, contrahit, constringit, et\r\nparticulas infirmas roborat.”[493]\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, in favour of the present supposition, that the collyrium of the\r\ninscription may possibly be named from the DRYS, I may take the present\r\nopportunity of mentioning that the ancient Roman oculists seem to have\r\npursued, in regard to old cicatrices of the eye, a treatment which is\r\nnot followed by their successors in modern times. “All cicatrices on the\r\ntransparent part of the eye,” says Aetius, “appear white (omnes\r\ncicatrices in nigro oculi _albæ_ apparent”);[494] and consequently\r\ngive, by their presence, a disagreeable and disfiguring effect to the\r\neye.[495] Some of the Roman oculists seem to have used various collyria,\r\nfor the purpose of dyeing or changing the colour of these white specks\r\nor pearly cicatrices, and of thus imparting to them some kind of tint\r\nthat rendered the appearance of the eye, and the distinction between the\r\ntransparent cornea and its white opacities, less marked and striking.\r\nFor this purpose the gall-nuts of the oak or DRYS appear to have been\r\ngreatly used. Aetius does not approve of the practice of tinting\r\ncicatrices; but, in a chapter bearing the heading of “Albuginum\r\nTincturæ,” he describes half-a-dozen applications and collyria that\r\nmight be employed for the purpose of staining and correcting the colour\r\nof old cicatrices of the eyes, lest, he adds, his readers should be\r\nignorant of the means which might effect this (ut ne ignorentur ea quæ\r\nhoc facere possunt). In three or four of these collyria the gall-nut\r\nforms a leading ingredient,[496] and it seems to have been generally\r\nused previously to, or in combination with, blue vitriol (_atramentum\r\nsutorium_). Myrepsus gives a “collyrium tingens crassas albugines et\r\ncicatrices,” containing galls with chalcanthus (or copperas), roasted\r\nlead, etc.; and a second formed of burnt and washed lead, etc., combined\r\nwith unripe galls.[497] Paulus Ægineta mentions two dyes for\r\ncicatrices, both of them containing galls along with chalcanthus.[498]\r\nAlexander Trallianus gives a collyrium for staining cicatrices, which he\r\npronounces “valde generosum.” It consists principally of chalcanthus and\r\ngalls.[499]\r\n\r\nLastly, let me offer one more conjecture. If the debateable word in this\r\nlegend be correctly copied as DIEXUM into the Antiquarian Society\r\nminute-book, it may probably signify the collyrium DIOXUS or DIOXUM\r\ngiven by Marcellus, and which he recommends for the removal of\r\ngranulations of the eyelids. This collyrium was composed of cadmia,\r\nburnt copper, hæmatites, myrrh, and gum.[500]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. T. JUNIANI HOBSUM AD ρUECUMO DELICTA A MEDICIS.\r\n\r\nThis fourth legend on the Bath stone offers the most puzzling of all the\r\ninscriptions hitherto found upon the Roman medicine-stamps discovered in\r\nGreat Britain. As Mr. Gough gives it, the last words of the inscription\r\nDELICTA, or more probably DELECTA[501] A⃨ MEDICIS (esteemed by\r\nphysicians), are alone intelligible. The plaster cast of this side of\r\nthe seal, contained in the Museum of the Antiquarian Society of London,\r\ncontains an extremely imperfect copy of the second line, and not an over\r\nperfect one of the first; but we see enough in it to be quite aware of\r\nthe great carelessness with which Mr. Gough had originally copied the\r\nwhole inscription. The second last letter in the line is not the Greek\r\nρ, as Gough prints it, but the Latin Q; and the name of the collyrium is\r\nnot HOBSUM, as he gives it, but apparently PHOEBUM. At all events there\r\nis a P, which he has omitted, before the H; and the two medial letters,\r\nwhich he read F S, are seemingly E B. Such is the conclusion to which a\r\ncareful examination of the lettering of the cast itself forces me; and\r\nwhat is much more important,—because affording far stronger evidence\r\nthan mine,—Mr. Akerman reads this inscription in the same way. I may\r\nadd, that (as I am informed by the same gentleman) the word is always\r\ncopied and written as PHOEBUM, in the several notices of the stamp\r\ncontained in the minute-books of the Antiquarian Society, and to which I\r\nhave already referred; and Gough’s Greek ρ is always given as the Roman\r\nQ.\r\n\r\nStill, with all these emendations, I confess myself quite at a loss to\r\ndecipher, satisfactorily, the inscription. The spelling of all the\r\ninscriptions on this stamp is executed very carelessly,—as in\r\n_crsomaelinum_ for _crysomelinum_; _thalaser_ for _thalasser_; and\r\npossibly the term QUECVMO may be a mis-spelling by the engraver for\r\nLEUCOMA. If so, the inscription would stand as\r\n\r\n  T JUNIANI PHOEBUM AD LU\r\n  ECOMA DELECTA A MEDICIS.\r\n\r\nOr, as we may then translate it, “_The Phoebum of T. Junianus for\r\nLeucoma, esteemed by physicians._”\r\n\r\nI am not aware that any of the old authors have described a collyrium\r\nunder the name of PHOEBUM. But it looks like one of those specious\r\ntitles which the oculists were so fond of selecting and assuming; and we\r\nfind described in their works collyria with analogous semi-astronomical\r\nand mythological appellations, such as _Sol_, _Aster_, _Lumen_, _Phos_,\r\n_Uranium_, etc.[502]\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall venture only one more remark, viz. the possibility of the term\r\nbeing PHORBIUM and not PHOEBUM. “The PHORBIUM,” observes Galen,\r\n“possesses attenuating, attractive, and discutient powers. They apply\r\nits seeds, mixed with honey, to LEUCOMA; and it is believed to have the\r\npower of extracting spicula of wood.”[503]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. VI.—FIRST DESCRIBED BY MR. DOUCE.\r\n\r\nMr. Douce published in 1778[504] a notice of a square flattened Roman\r\nmedicine-stamp, a quarter of an inch thick, and each side or edge\r\nmeasuring about two inches.\r\n\r\nMr. Gough published in the _Archæologia_ a sketch of this stamp, which\r\nis copied into Pl. II., No. VI. Some wax impressions were taken of the\r\nstone, but the stone itself was (it is stated in the same volume of the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1778, p. 510) “lost out of a pocket that had a\r\nhole in it, and probably, instead of gracing a museum, has contributed\r\nits mite towards mending the roads.”\r\n\r\nThe four sides of the stone contained the following series of\r\ninscriptions, the terminal and initial letters of three of the lines\r\nbeing wanting, and supplied in our copy below by italic letters:—\r\n\r\n  1. MJULSATYRIDIA\r\n     LEPIDOSADASPR\r\n\r\n  2. MJULSATYRIDIASMI(_r_)\r\n    (_n_)ESPOSTMPETLIPPIT\r\n\r\n  3. MJULSATYRIDIALI\r\n     BANUADSUPPURAT\r\n\r\n  4. (_m_)JULSATYRIPENI\r\n     CILLENEEXOVO\r\n\r\nThe name of the oculist, M. JUL. SATYRUS—_M(arcus?) Jul(ius)\r\nSatyrus_—is sufficiently distinct, and occurs with each of the four\r\nlegends of the stamp. When we analyse further the inscriptions on the\r\nfour sides of the seal, they severally read as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n1. M(_arci_) JUL_ii_ SATYRI DIALEPIDOS AD ASP_e_R_itudines_.—_Marcus\r\nJulius Satyrus’ Dialepidos or Copper collyrium for granulations of the\r\neyelids._\r\n\r\nThe three first sides of this stamp have the special collyria inscribed\r\nupon them, beginning each with the letters DIA, from the Greek\r\npreposition δια, “with,” and here signifying “made with.”[505] The three\r\nprincipal ingredients in the three first inscriptions are all given,\r\ncombined with this initial preposition δια, and under their Greek\r\nappellatives,—λεπιδος, σμυρνα and λιβανος—forming instances, among\r\nmany others, of the anxiety of the ancient Roman oculists to invest\r\ntheir drugs with all the mysterious attraction and formality of a Greek\r\nname; just as some modern English physicians foolishly enough consider\r\nit still proper to write always the names of the medicines which they\r\nnow prescribe in the language of the ancient Romans, thus, like their\r\npredecessors, attempting, in the exercise of their profession, to act\r\nupon that principle in the weakness of human nature which holds “omne\r\nignotum pro mirifico.”\r\n\r\nI have already described (see Stamp No. II., p. 245) the composition of\r\nthe collyrium termed _Dialepidos_, and the origin of the name of the\r\ninscription from the λεπιδες, or scales of the oxide of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. M. JUL. SATYRI DIASMI_rn_ES POST IMPETUM LIPPIT_udinis_.—_The\r\nDiasmyrnes or Myrrh collyrium of M. Jul. Satyrus, after the commencement\r\nof ophthalmy._\r\n\r\nThe principal ingredients in the collyrium _Diasmyrnes_, namely, myrrh\r\n(μῤῥυα or σμυρνα), was a drug to which important therapeutical\r\nvirtues were formerly ascribed. It was applied in the treatment of\r\nvarious diseases. In reference to affections of the eye, it had the\r\npower, according to Dioscorides, of filling up ulcers of the organ,\r\nremoving cicatrices and scales obstructing the pupil; and besides, it\r\ncured eruptions and granulations of the eyelids (oculorum ulcera\r\ncomplet, exteritque albugines, et ea quae pupillis tenebras offundunt;\r\nquin et scabritias seu asperitudines expolit).[506]\r\n\r\nVarious collyria were used by the ancients, bearing the name of\r\n_Diasmyrnes_ or _Diasmyrnon_, from myrrh constituting their leading\r\ningredient. Aetius has one of his long chapters on collyria headed\r\n“Collyria Diasmyrna et Chiaca appellata.”[507] Actuarius, in his section\r\n“De affectionibus Oculorum,” speaks of the collyria _Diasmyrna_ (quæ ex\r\nmyrrha constant) in the plural number, and as well known in his\r\ntime.[508] Paulus Ægineta, in discussing the treatment of hypopion or\r\nsuppuration in the cornea, speaks of sometimes making the abscess burst;\r\nand, if so, then, he adds, “cleanse the ulcer by means of the more\r\npotent remedies, such as those called _Diasmyrna_,”[509] etc. Among his\r\nformulæ for individual collyria in his several books, he gives a receipt\r\nfor the collyria _Diasmyrnes_. (Aldine edition, p. 118.)\r\n\r\nGalen gives several collyria _Diasmyrna_, as the _Diasmyrnum_ Odorum\r\nSynerotis,[510] the _Diasmyrnum_ Glaucidanum, and the _Diasmyrnum_ ex\r\nhæmatite.[511] And in his work _De Simplicium Medicamentorum\r\nTemperamentis ac Facultatibus_, he states, “Sed et collyria sunt plurima\r\nquæ medeantur suffusionibus, et maxime quod plurimam recipit myrrham,\r\nquale est quod a Democrate compositum est, quod vocant\r\n_Diasmyrnon_.”[512]\r\n\r\nThe term _Lippitudo_ in this legend, and which we will find recurring in\r\nthe sequel, was, according to Galen, anciently applied to that form of\r\nophthalmy which consists of inflammation of the conjunctival covering of\r\nthe cornea (lippitudo inflammatio est membranæ, quæ corneæ adnata\r\nest.)[513] But the term was also used to designate other forms or\r\nvarieties of ophthalmic inflammation. The disease described by Celsus\r\nunder the name of _Lippitudo_ appears (says a high modern authority on\r\neye-diseases) to have been “catarrhal conjunctivitis.”[514] The same\r\noculist speaks of Lippitudo as “an excoriation of the edges of the lids,\r\nor bleared eyes;” and he describes obliteration of the Meibomian\r\nfollicles as the cause of incurable Lippitudo.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. M. JULII. SATYRI DIALIBANU_m_ AD SUPPURAT_ionem_.—_M. Jul.\r\nSatyrus’ Dialibanum, or Incense collyrium, for Suppurative discharge\r\nfrom the eyes._\r\n\r\nFrankincense (_thus_, λιβανος, λιβανωτος)[515] was frequently\r\nused by the ancient oculists in their collyria. According to Galen[516]\r\nand Paulus Ægineta,[517] in consequence of its detergent powers, it\r\napparently cleanses and fills up ulcers in the eyes (expurgare et\r\nimplere quæ in oculis consistunt ulcera videtur). It has the power,\r\naccording to Oribasius, “astringendi, calefaciendi, _caliginem oculorum_\r\ndiscutiendi, cava ulcera implendi, ad cicatricem perducendi,”[518] etc.\r\n\r\nAlexander Trallianus gives a formula for the collyrium _Dialibanum ad\r\nchemosim efficax_; and he describes the _Dialibanum_ as, like the\r\nLibanum, of much use in eye-diseases, and particularly for inflammations\r\nwhich are accompanied with ulceration (multi est usus, maxime ad\r\ninflammationes quae cum ulcere infestant).[519] Celsus recommends it in\r\nulcers of the eye following pustules (fit quoque proprie ad hæc quod\r\nδια λιβανου vocatur).[520] Paulus Ægineta gives a formula for the\r\n_Dialibanum_, in his chapter on collyria.[521] Marcellus Empiricus, who\r\noffers two recipes for its composition, ascribes to it the power of\r\nbeing efficacious in the disease noted on our inscription, namely, “ad\r\nsuppurationes oculorum.”[522]\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the treatment of suppuration of the eye, Galen lays\r\ndown the following indications for the use of the _Diasmyrnes_, and\r\n_Dialibanum_:—“At quando pus, quod in oculis est, digerere placet,\r\ncollyriis quæ myrrham habent, maxime utemur; quæ utique et _Diasmyrna_\r\nGræci proprie vocant; his certe minus, sed reliquis melius faciunt quæ\r\n_Dialibanum_ vocant.”[523]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. (M): JUL: SATYRI PENIC_illum_ LENE EX OVO.—_M. Jul. Satyrus’ mild\r\nPenicillum; to be used with an egg._\r\n\r\nThe term _Penicillum_ has been found inscribed on several different\r\nRoman medical stamps, as upon specimens discovered at Vieux and Paris,\r\neach marked with _lene penicillum_; upon one discovered at Nais\r\n(_penicillum ad omnem lippitudinem_); and upon another at Famars. Its\r\nsignification has given rise to several opinions somewhat differing from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nM. Grivaud considers the _Penicillum_ indicated on the Roman\r\nmedicine-stamps, to be merely a small brush or hair-pencil, such as is\r\nstill used at the present day to wipe away the more viscid discharges\r\nthat may be found adhering to the palpebræ and eyelashes.[524] According\r\nto M. Sichel, the _Penicillum_ consisted of a pledget or folds of\r\ncharpie, which the ancient oculists used both for the purpose of\r\ncleansing the eyes, and of introducing into them soothing washes and\r\ncollyria.[525] M. Eloi Johanneau,[526] and M. Duchalais,[527] describe\r\nthe _Penicillum_ as a soft and fine sponge, employed in applying\r\ncollyria to the diseased eye. Blancardi, in his _Lexicon Medicum_,\r\ndefines the word _Penicillum_ as “lint reduced to charpie, and\r\nbesmeared with ointment to be applied to ulcers.”\r\n\r\nThe word _Penicillum_ occurs in the writings of Pliny and Celsus, and is\r\nused by these ancient authorities in such a manner as to give\r\ncountenance to each of the preceding opinions. Thus Pliny, in his\r\nchapter on sponges (_De Spongiarum Natura_), speaks of a variety of very\r\nfine sponge under the name of _Penicillum_; and this, when soaked in a\r\npreparation of honeyed wine (mulso), was, he says, applied to tumours of\r\nthe eyes.[528] These _Penicilli_ were also (he adds) useful, when very\r\nsoft and fine, in cleansing the eye in ophthalmy.[529] Celsus, in his\r\nobservations on the diseases of the eye, three or four times, and in\r\ndifferent senses, uses the term. In inflammation of the eye, he\r\nrecommends the eyes to be fomented with a _Penicillum_ or pledget,\r\nsqueezed out of a warm watery decoction of myrtle or rose leaves, before\r\nlocal medicines and collyria are applied to them.[530] Elsewhere, he\r\nrecommends a pledget or _Penicillum_ to be laid, or, if necessary, bound\r\nover the eyes, squeezed out of water; or, if the attack is more severe,\r\nout of vinegar and water (_Penicillo_ uti expresso ex aqua; si major, ex\r\nposca).[531] In another passage, he states that in intense ophthalmia\r\nthe white of an egg or the milk of woman, dropped into the eye with a\r\n_Penicillum_, relieves the inflammation, and that this may be used by\r\nthe patient when neither a physician nor other medicines are at\r\nhand.[532] And again, he recommends the patient to take a bath, and\r\nfoment his head and eyes freely with the warm water, then to wipe both\r\nwith a _Penicillum_, and anoint his head with iris ointment.[533] Here\r\nwe have the _Penicillum_ used by the same author as a mechanical means\r\nboth of cleansing the eye and of making local applications to it.\r\nFurther, in his chapter on the surgery of the eyes, Celsus uses the word\r\n_Penicillum_ in the signification of tents. Thus, in describing the\r\noperation for ancyloblepharon, or agglutination of the eyelids, he\r\ndirects the eyelids, after being separated by a probe, to be kept\r\nasunder by small _penicilla_ laid between them, till the ulceration of\r\nthe part is cured.[534]\r\n\r\nThe preceding quotations show that, besides other significations, there\r\nis no doubt that the term _Penicillum_ was used to designate a soft\r\nsponge, and perhaps also a brush or pledget of charpie that was\r\noccasionally employed in ophthalmic practice, for the double purpose of\r\nfomenting or cleansing the eye, and of dropping local applications into\r\nit. But it seems very unlikely that a stamp should be used by the\r\noculist to mark the material of these _Penicilli_ with. It would be both\r\ndifficult and unnecessary to stamp in any way either a piece of sponge\r\nor of charpie with such an inscription as that found upon this and the\r\nother Roman seals. And I would venture to suggest, that it appears much\r\nmore probable that the collyrium, ointment, or lotion, that was to be\r\nused with the sponge or charpie, was sometimes designated _Penicillum_,\r\nfrom the special mode in which it was to be applied; in the same way as\r\nwe have found various eye-drops passing under the general designation of\r\n_Stactum_, from the special mode in which they were applied to the\r\ndiseased organ. In this way the LENE PENICILLUM in the legend of our\r\npresent oculist-stamp would not signify the material which was used in\r\nthe application of the medicine, but the name of the medicine or\r\ncollyrium as indicative of the mode in which it was to be used.\r\n\r\nThe employment of the collyrium PENICILLUM mixed with an egg (EX OVO) is\r\noften indicated upon the oculist-stamps; and in the ancient Roman\r\nauthors it is a mode in which many of the collyria were directed to be\r\nprepared before they were applied to the diseased eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. VII.—CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nIn his paper in the _Archæologia_ (vol. ix.), Mr. Gough published a\r\nsketch and account of a medicine-stamp, inscribed on three of its sides,\r\nand remarkable in one or two respects. The sketch which he has given of\r\nit is copied into Plate II., No. VII. The stamp itself is preserved in\r\nthe British Museum. It is thicker, and more rounded at the edges, than\r\nthe generality of these flat medicine-stones.\r\n\r\nAfter quoting the three inscriptions on its sides, Mr. Gough gives the\r\nfollowing very brief and unsatisfactory account of the reading of this\r\nstamp. “From the inscriptions,” he observes, “we learn that the owner’s\r\nname was FL., or FLAVIUS SECUNDUS, and that his composition was made of\r\nOpobalsamum and Myrrh, and the white of eggs.”[535]\r\n\r\nMr. Gough pointed out that the third side of the stamp was engraved in\r\nletters of a rude and negligent form, and different in character from\r\nthe inscriptions on the two other sides. But he failed in seeing that\r\nthe remaining sides are both imperfect; and that the latter half of one\r\nof the inscriptions, and the first half of the other, are deficient, in\r\nconsequence of the stone, which was at first much larger, having been\r\nbroken or reduced in size, and subsequently again rubbed down and\r\nsmoothed on two of its sides before one of these sides was cut with the\r\nrude lettering above alluded to. When these circumstances are attended\r\nto, the inscriptions on the three sides appear to stand as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. LJULIVENISD . . . . .\r\n     OPOBALSAMTU . . . . .\r\n\r\n  2. . . . . . . ASMVRNESBIS\r\n     . . . . . . MPETUEXOVO\r\n\r\n  3. FSEKUNDI\r\n     ATALBAS.\r\n\r\nThe name of the proprietor is evidently L. JUL. IVENIS [L(_ucius?_)\r\n_Jul(ius) Ivenis_]; and I may remark in passing, that the cognomen\r\nof IVENIS is one which has been found recurring among the Roman\r\npottery-stamps found in England.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fill in, with anything like precision and certainty,\r\nthe defective words in the two first inscriptions. But judging from the\r\nanalogy of other similar and more perfect stamps, these two inscriptions\r\nprobably read somewhat as follows when the seal was entire.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. L. JUL. IVENIS D_iapsoricum_ OPOBALSAM_a_TU_m_ _ad Claritatem_.—_L.\r\nJul. Ivenis’ Opobalsamic Diapsoricum for clearing of the sight._\r\n\r\nThe adjective, OPOBALSAMATUM, has hitherto been generally found united\r\nupon medicine-stamps with one of two collyria—viz. with _Stacticum_ (as\r\nin seal No. IV.); or with _Diapsoricum_, as in seals found at Jena and\r\nLyons. The D preserved in the first line is, in all probability, the\r\ninitial letter of the latter collyrium.\r\n\r\nThe _Psoricum_ was a mixture of cadmia and chalcitis, according to\r\nDioscorides, Pliny, and Celsus;[536] or of litharge and chalcitis,\r\naccording to Galen, Aetius, and Paulus Ægineta.[537] This metallic\r\ncompound derived its name of _Psoricum_ from its supposed utility in the\r\ntreatment of parts affected with the eruption of scabies or _psora_. The\r\neyelids, according to the ancient oculists, were the occasional seat of\r\neruptive or pruriginous inflammation (_psorophthalmia_, _scabrities_,\r\n_prurigo_, etc.) In enumerating the diseases of the lining membrane of\r\nthe palpebræ, Galen mentions, among others, _sycosis_, _chalazosis_, and\r\n_psoriasis_.[538] Various collyria employed for the removal of these\r\naffections were termed _Psorica_, and most of them, though not all,\r\ncontained the metallic compound alluded to. “Quae scabros in palpebris\r\naffectus persanant, atque ob id _Psorica_ appellantur.”[539] When\r\nspeaking of the specific affections of the eyes and their appropriate\r\nlocal applications, Actuarius, in the same way, remarks, “Quae scabiosis\r\npalpebrarum affectionibus medentur, id circo _Psorica_\r\nappellantur.”[540] He gives (p. 307) formulæ for various forms of the\r\n_Collyrium Psoricum_; as the _Psoricum aridum_, the _Psoricum Aelii_,\r\netc. Aetius recommends the collyrium _Psoricum_ against “scabros ac\r\ncorrosos angulos, et intensos pruritus, milphoses et prurigines.”[541]\r\nScribonius Largus describes the composition of a collyrium _Psoricum_\r\nmade from the metallic compound of the same name (facit hoc collyrium\r\nbene quod _psoricum_ dicitur), and fitted to remove blindness,\r\ngranulations, and xero-ophthalmia.[542] Marcellus Empiricus credulously\r\ninvests the collyrium _Psoricum_ with signal powers for various\r\neye-diseases, but particularly for old-standing blindness (antiquam\r\ncoecitatem). For if (says he) we may credit the experience of the author\r\nof the remedy, it has, at the end of twenty days, restored sight to a\r\nperson who had been blind for twelve years (nam ut auctori hujus remedii\r\nde experimento credamus, duodecim annorum coeco intra dies viginti visum\r\nrestituisse se dicit).[543]\r\n\r\nOn the Jena medicine-stamp the _Diapsoricum Opobalsamatum_ is entered as\r\nefficacious for the clearing of the sight (ad claritatem);[544] and in\r\nthe proposed restoration of the reading of the present English stamp, I\r\nhave added to it the same therapeutic indication, as one not unlikely to\r\nhave originally filled up the part that is now deficient in this line of\r\nthe stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _L. Jul. Ivenis Di_ASMYRNES BIS _Lippitudinis i_MPETU EX\r\nOVO.—_The myrrh collyrium of L. J. Ivenis, to be used twice a day,\r\nmixed with an egg, at the commencement of Ophthalmy._\r\n\r\nAlready we have considered the composition, etc., of the Collyrium\r\n_Diasmyrnes_ (see pp. 267, 268.) It is entered, as efficacious in\r\nattacks of Lippitudo, on the medicine-stamps of Jena, Nais, etc. In the\r\nJena stamp it is, as in the present instance, ordered to be used mixed\r\nwith an egg.[545]\r\n\r\nThe word BIS denotes, in all probability, the frequency with which it\r\nwas to be used daily. Occasionally the ancient authors state in the same\r\nway in their works the frequency with which a special collyrium was to\r\nbe used. Thus, for example, Paulus Ægineta, after describing the\r\ncomposition of the brown collyrium (collyrium fuscum), adds that it is\r\nto be applied thrice a day (illinitur _ter_ in die ... ex ovo aut lacte,\r\netc.)[546] Indeed when speaking of the variety of collyrium mentioned in\r\nthe legend on this stamp,—namely, of the “collyria quæ quod ex myrrha\r\nconstant διασμυρνα vocantur,” Actuarius expressly states that the\r\naffected eye is to be annointed with the _Diasmyrnes_ “twice a day\r\n(_bis_ in die).”[547]\r\n\r\n3. The third side of this medicine-stamp is engraved, as already\r\nobserved, by a different and far more inexperienced hand than the other\r\ntwo sides. The letters are very roughly and rudely formed. The\r\ninscription indicates the name of another oculist,—of one who probably\r\nbecame the possessor of the stamp after IVENIS. The new proprietor’s\r\nname is F., or probably FL., SECUNDUS, and the inscription reads, F.\r\nSEKUNDI AT ALBAS, _the collyrium_ or _preparation_ of _F. Secundus\r\nagainst Albugines_.\r\n\r\nIn reading it, I suppose the AT to be a mis-spelling for AD,—a mistake\r\nof which there are not wanting other examples in the illiterate and\r\ncareless engravings sometimes found upon these medicine-stamps.[548] And\r\nI have interpreted the ALBAS as signifying _albas cicatrices_ (white\r\ncicatrices), or, in other words, _albugines_ of the cornea,—a\r\nsuggestion for which I am indebted to M. Sichel. Already I have quoted\r\nthe expression of Aetius to the effect that all cicatrices of the cornea\r\nare “_Albæ_;” and the nouns by which such eye-cicatrices are designated,\r\nboth by the Greek and Roman physicians, namely, λευκωμα and _albugo_,\r\nare words derived from, and intended to signify, the white colour\r\n(λευκος, _albus_) of these lesions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. VIII.—FOUND AT SOUTHWELL.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous correspondent, C. D., sent to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_,\r\nin 1772, a sketch and notice of what, no doubt, is a Roman\r\nmedicine-stamp, but both the sketch given of it and the description are\r\nexcessively meagre. The correspondent dates his letter from Southwell,\r\nin Nottinghamshire. He says, “The inscribed stone was found lately by\r\ncasting up the ground, in the neighbourhood of Littleborough in this\r\ncounty. The stone is oblong, about two inches long, and one broad. It\r\ncontains inscriptions on the edges or rim of the two ends, and on one of\r\nits oblong sides, but not on the other.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” says the correspondent, “supposed to be a Tessera or kind of\r\ntally, such being, as we are told, a little flat square piece of stone,\r\nand having a particular inscription, and was used in the Roman armies,\r\nby being on certain occasions delivered to each of the soldiers, to\r\ndistinguish them from the enemy, and also in setting their nightly\r\nguard, by being given from one centurion to another, quite through the\r\narmy, till it returned to the tribune who first delivered it. Upon the\r\nreceipt of this, the guard was set immediately. But,” he continues, “as\r\nthe inscription on the above drawing cannot be made out to satisfaction,\r\nmany of you will be glad to know whether it has been such a Tessera as\r\nis above supposed; or what else it may have been, or also an explanation\r\nof its legend, by some of your antiquarian correspondents.”\r\n\r\nThe inscription on one of the long sides of the stone appears to be the\r\nname of the proprietor of the stamp; but the published copy of it\r\npresents such irregular lettering, as to defy any certain deciphering of\r\nwhat the name is. (See Plate III., No. VIII.) On the other two sides the\r\ninscriptions are as follow:—\r\n\r\n  1. B. DIASORICV.\r\n  2. STATVS.\r\n\r\nThese two words evidently are misspellings, either on the original\r\nstamp, or (what is equally probable) in its published copy, for the\r\nCollyria termed _Diapsoricum_ and _Stactum_. But I have already, in\r\nreference to previous inscriptions, discussed the signification of these\r\ntwo terms at such length as not to require to revert to them. (See under\r\nStamps No. IV. and No. VIII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.]\r\n\r\nThe initial B, as it stands in the first line, seems to defy all kinds\r\nof conjecture in regard to its signification. In this, as in one or two\r\nother instances, the only hope of obtaining a true reading of the legend\r\nis in the re-discovery of the stamp itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. IX.—FOUND AT WROXETER.\r\n\r\nThis seal is remarkable both from its inscription, and from its round\r\nform. In this last respect it is, I believe, as yet unique,—no other\r\nspecimen of a medicine-stamp of the same circular figure having, as far\r\nas I know, been hitherto described. The stone is about seven-eighths of\r\nan inch in diameter, and a quarter of an inch thick. Its form and\r\ninscription are seen in Plate III. No. IX., where the upper figure shows\r\nthe stamp presenting the usual incuse and reversed inscription; and the\r\nsecond or lower figure shows the impression left by the stamp upon\r\nwax.[549]\r\n\r\nThis curious medicine-stamp was found, in 1808, by a person ploughing in\r\na field near the Roman wall at Wroxeter (the ancient Uriconium),\r\nShropshire. It was first figured and very briefly noticed by Mr. Parkes\r\nin the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1810, p. 617. “Several (observes Mr.\r\nParkes) have attempted to decipher the legend, but no one has as yet\r\nbeen able to give a satisfactory reading.” Mr. Nightingale (1813), in\r\nhis account of Shropshire in the _Beauties of England and Wales_[550]\r\nmentions the stamp; and Mr. Hartshorne in his _Salopia Antiqua_[551]\r\n(1841), has given an embellished and consequently less accurate copy of\r\nthe inscription than that originally published by Mr. Parkes. Mr.\r\nHartshorne describes it as “an amuletal seal,” and adds, “it has\r\nhitherto baffled the endeavours of those who have attempted to explain\r\nit.” Lastly, Mr. Albert Way has lately correctly published it as a\r\nspecimen of a Roman medicine-stamp, and has interpreted the second and\r\nfifth lines, leaving the others still undetermined. But the whole\r\nappears capable of being deciphered. The inscription runs thus:—\r\n\r\n   IBCLM\r\n  DIA LBA\r\n   AD OM\r\n  NE Δ VN\r\n   O EX O\r\n\r\nJ (_ulii?_) B (_assi?_) CL_e_M_entis_ DIAL_i_BA_num_ AD OMNEM Διαθεσιν\r\n(Diathesin) VNO EX O_vo_.—_The Dialibanum or Incense collyrium of\r\nJulius Bassus Clemens, for every eye-disease; to be used mixed with an\r\negg._\r\n\r\nThe name of the practitioner or proprietor, given in the first line of\r\nthe seal, offers the principal difficulty in reading the inscription.\r\nBut the CLM is in all probability a contraction, as I have ventured to\r\ninterpret it, for CLEMENS,—a common cognomen or family name among the\r\nRomans. The B as an initial could stand for any of the various gens\r\nnames which begin with this letter, as Balbus, Betutius, etc. I have\r\nconjecturally given it as _Bassus_, principally because on an old\r\nmonumental tablet, discovered at Leyden,[552] the cognomen of CLEMENS is\r\npreceded by the nomen gentilicium of BASSUS,—showing the combination in\r\nquestion not to have been unknown among the Roman colonists formerly\r\nscattered over Western Europe. Besides, _Bassus_ was a name by no means\r\nunknown in ancient Roman medical literature and practice. When\r\nmentioning, in the preface to his first Book, the more distinguished\r\ndisciples and followers of Asclepiades, Dioscorides places, as the\r\nforemost in his enumeration, _Julius Bassus_. Galen (_De Simpl. Medicam.\r\nFacult._ lib. i. cap. 7) and Cælius Aurelianus (_Contra\r\nHereses_—Preface to lib. i.) both cite the practice and authority of\r\n_Bassus_; and Pliny, in his _Index Auctorum_, mentions that this\r\nphysician wrote in Greek, although he was by birth a Roman.[553]\r\n\r\nThe nature and composition of the Collyrium _Dialibanum_ we have already\r\nhad occasion to consider under a former head. (See Stamp No. VI., p.\r\n253.)\r\n\r\nI have also formerly shown that the Greek term Διαθεσις was used as a\r\ngeneral term for eye-disease (see p. 241); and no doubt its initial\r\nletter Δ stands in the present inscription under this signification.\r\n\r\nMany of the ancient collyria were, like the _Dialibanum_, preserved and\r\nsold in a firm or solid form, and were directed to be dissolved or\r\nmixed with the white of one or more eggs at the time when they were\r\nrequired for application to the eye.[554] Hence the expression, UNO “EX\r\nOVO,” in this and other stamp legends.\r\n\r\nThis stamp, like some others, has a rude figure of a plant engraved\r\nalong with the inscription. The trunk of the plant is given at the\r\ncommencement of the third line by Mr. Hartshorne as an I—thus\r\nunnecessarily confusing the reading of the legend.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. X.—FOUND AT KENCHESTER.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal of the British Archæological Association for 1849, Mr.\r\nRoach Smith has described a medicine-stamp found at Kenchester, in\r\nHerefordshire, and communicated to him by Mr. Johnson. I myself am\r\nindebted to the kindness of Mr. Johnson for both a model and drawings of\r\nthis medicine-stamp, which is quadrilateral, and engraved on its four\r\nsides. It has, besides, the word SENIOR inscribed on one of its flat\r\nsurfaces; and the four first letters of the same word are repeated on\r\nthe opposite surface. I shall afterwards have occasion to re-advert to\r\nthis curious point.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith has published a sketch of the stamp; but the more correct\r\ndrawings of it in Plate III., No. X., have been kindly furnished to me\r\nby Mr. Johnson. The six lowest figures in this plate represent, first,\r\nthe two flat surfaces of the stone, with the retrograde inscriptions\r\nupon its four sides; and, secondly, these four inscriptions as they\r\nappear when impressed upon wax.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions on the four sides of this stamp read as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. F.VINDAC.ARIO\r\n     VISTIANICET\r\n\r\n  2. T.VINDACIAR\r\n     (_i_)OVISTINARD\r\n\r\n  3. (T) VINDAC. ARI\r\n     OVISTI CHLORON\r\n\r\n  4. T. VINDAC . ARIO\r\n     VISTI ... RINM\r\n\r\nThe name of the oculist or proprietor, T. VINDAC ARIOVISTUS, _Titus (?)\r\nVindacius_ or _Vindex Ariovistus_, is singular; the name ARIOVISTUS\r\nbeing the same as that of the celebrated German king and general that\r\nplays so interesting and important a part in the Commentaries of Cæsar,\r\nand the reputed valour and prowess of whose troops daunted for a time,\r\nand almost created a mutiny in, Cæsar’s army.\r\n\r\nOn this stamp there are no names of any specific eye-diseases given; but\r\nthe four sides contain the designation of four collyria that we have not\r\nmet with on any of the previous medicine-stamps which we have had\r\noccasion to describe. These are the collyria _Anicetum_, _Nardinum_,\r\n_Chloron_, and _Thurinum_.\r\n\r\n1. T. VINDAC_ii_ ARIOVISTI ANICETUM.—_The Anicetum_ or _infallible\r\nCollyrium of T. Vindacius Ariovistus_.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium _Anicetum_, or Ανικητον, is, as far as I know, described\r\nby Oribasius alone. It was composed of red copper, combined with\r\nhenbane, hemlock, spikenard, frankincense, etc. Oribasius enters it as a\r\ncollyrium “ad carbunculos aptum.”[555]\r\n\r\nMr. Roach Smith supposes that the collyrium _Anicetum_ of this stamp\r\nderives its name from being a preparation containing aniseed. But the\r\nformula given by Oribasius does not present this ingredient; and the\r\norigin of the term is, we believe, very different. Galen presents us\r\nwith a clue to its true meaning, when discussing the subject of\r\nplasters, in the sixth book of his work, _De Compositione\r\nMedicamentorum_. One, bearing the name of ANICETUM, is (he observes)\r\ncalled so in consequence of its many and wonderful effects (vocatum est\r\ninsuperabilis (ΑΝΙΚΗΤΟΝ) propter miranda et multa ipsius opera).[556]\r\nThe term itself is, no doubt, derived from the Greek participle νικητος\r\n“conquered,” with the prefix of the privative α. Among his own list of\r\ncollyria, Galen enters the one known in his time under the name of\r\nCollyrium Aster,[557] as unsurpassed (Αστερ Ανικητον[558]).\r\n\r\n2. T. VINDAC.—ARIOVISTI NARDINUM.—_T. Vindacius Ariovistus’ Nardinum_\r\nor _Spikenard Collyrium_.\r\n\r\nThe ancient authorities on the Materia Medica describe several kinds of\r\nspikenard, according to the localities in which it is procured, as the\r\nIndian, Syrian, Celtic, etc. It was used by the Romans in many of their\r\nointments and perfumes,[559] and sometimes added to their wines.[560]\r\n\r\nThe nard, or spikenard, was used principally to perfume various\r\nmedicines, etc. But high medicinal properties were also attributed to it\r\nin various diseases, and, amongst others, in diseases of the eye. (See\r\nDioscorides, lib. i. cap. vi.) It entered into the composition of many\r\nof the ancient collyria, and several were named from it in consequence\r\nof its forming their leading ingredient. Aetius has a long chapter on\r\nformulæ for “Collyria Nardina et Theodotia,”[561] and bestows the most\r\nextravagant praises upon some varieties of the spikenard\r\neye-applications. Speaking of one of them, he observes, “It is not easy\r\nto relate the powers and efficiency of this medicine; indeed my readers\r\nwould scarcely credit it, for under the most desperate affections it\r\nrecalls the eye to its natural state.”[562]\r\n\r\n3. T. VINDAC. ARIOVISTI CHLORON.—_The Chloron_ or _green Collyrium of\r\nT. Vindax Ariovistus_.\r\n\r\nAlready I have had occasion to allude to the collyrium _Chloron_, as one\r\nof those which derive their particular appellation from the tint or\r\ncolour of the preparation. The green collyrium, or _Chloron_, is\r\nmentioned in many of the old treatises upon affections of the eye. For\r\nexample, Galen gives several such collyria in succession, as, vol. xii.\r\npp. 763 and 768, the “_Chloron_ ad diatheses;” and again, two forms of\r\n_Chloron_ used by Zoilus the oculist.\r\n\r\n4. T. VINDAC. ARIOVISTI _Tu_RINUM. _The Frankincense Collyrium of T.\r\nVindacius Ariovistus._\r\n\r\nThe designation of the collyrium on this fourth side of the Kenchester\r\nstone is so very much destroyed as to render the deciphering of it\r\nextremely difficult and problematical.\r\n\r\nMr. Roach Smith has not attempted to read it; but has contented himself\r\nby giving N as the last letter of the collyrium, and the only one\r\ncapable of being deciphered, printing the whole legend on this side\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n    T VINDAC. ARIO\r\n  VISTI ... N.[563]\r\n\r\nBut certainly the terminal letter is not N. Mr. Johnson has kindly\r\nsupplied me with two wax impressions of the legend on this side. One of\r\nthese is faithfully copied in Plate III., No. X., lowest figure. The\r\nexamination of it will show that the terminal letter is not an N; for\r\nthe supposed middle or oblique line of the letter descends downwards\r\nfrom left to right, and not, as it should do, provided the letter were\r\nN, from right to left. The two first letters of the name of the\r\ncollyrium are entirely obliterated. In the position of the third letter\r\nthere is the head of a letter which may stand for R, B, or P. The\r\nfollowing letter is apparently an I; and the next an N. In reading it, I\r\nhave supposed these three consecutive letters to be RIN, and the\r\nterminal letter to be an M, or rather a V and M braced together. An\r\ninstance of a similar bracing or conjunction of two letters is seen in\r\nthe legend of the second side of this stone, where the terminal two\r\nletters TI of “_Ariovisti_” are conjoined into one. Further, I have\r\nventured to suggest the two initial letters as TU, and the whole name as\r\nconsequently TURINUM.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium _Thurinum_, or _Turinum_, is inscribed on three Roman\r\nmedicine-stamps that have been discovered in France,—the first in\r\nParis, the second at Cessi-sur-Tille, and the third at Solangei. The\r\ntwo last are both described by M. Fevret de Saint-Mesmin.[564] The\r\ncollyrium evidently derived its specific name from its principal\r\ningredient frankincense, or _thus_, this latter Roman noun being\r\nsometimes spelt with, and sometimes without, the _h_. In the Solangei\r\nstamp the collyrium is written THURINUM; but in the stamps of Paris and\r\nCessi-sur-Tille it appears without the H, or as TURINUM.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium _Turinum_ is, it is scarcely necessary to add, merely a\r\nlatinised form for the Greek collyrium _Dialibanum_, the composition and\r\nvirtues of which we have considered in the previous pages (see pp. 269\r\nand 283). The Latin translators of Oribasius and Paulus Ægineta render\r\nthe collyrium Dialibanum as written by these Greek authors by the term\r\n“_Collyrium ex thure_.”[565] In the same way the κολλουριον το δια\r\nλιβανου γινομενον of Galen is rendered by Kühn, and his other\r\ntranslators, as “Collyrium quod fit ex THURE.”[566]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. XI.—FOUND AT CIRENCESTER.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful work on the Roman remains of Cirencester, published\r\nlast year by Professor Buckman and Mr. Newmarch, a Roman medicine-stamp\r\nis described.[567] It was found, in 1818, in the Leauses garden at\r\nCirencester, deposited in a fictile urn.\r\n\r\nThis stamp is of the form of a parallelogram, and is inscribed on two of\r\nits sides. Plate III., No. XI., shows the lettering of these two\r\ninscriptions, as well as the size of the sides, and the rude\r\ncross-markings that appear on the two ends of the stone. The\r\ninscriptions are as follow:—\r\n\r\n  1. MINERVALIS DIALEB\r\n     ANUM AD IMPT LIPP EX OVO\r\n\r\n  2. MINERVALIS MELINU\r\n     AD OMNEM DOLOREM\r\n\r\nMessrs. Buckman and Newmarch read MINERVALIS as signifying “pertaining\r\nto Minerva;” but it is no doubt the name, as in other specimens, of the\r\noculist who was the proprietor of the stamp. And from the inscriptions\r\nleft us upon Roman tombs, we know that _Minervalis_ was a Roman\r\ncognomen.[568]\r\n\r\nThe two inscriptions are easily read; they are as follow:—\r\n\r\n1. MINERVALIS DIALEBANUM AD IMPET_um_ LIPP_itudinis_ EX\r\nOVO.—_Minervalis’ frankincense Collyrium for attacks of Ophthalmy; to\r\nbe used with an egg._\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to discuss the nature of the Collyrium\r\nDialibanum (p. 269), and it is unnecessary to recur to it. On a\r\nprevious occasion, also (p. 284), the signification of the common\r\nexpression, _ex ovo_, was adverted to.\r\n\r\n2. MINERVALIS MELINU_m_ AD OMNEM DOLOREM.—_Minervalis’ yellow Collyrium\r\nfor every pain or disease of the eye._\r\n\r\nMore than once we have had occasion to allude to the Collyrium _Melinum_\r\n(pp. 250, 257). The only singularity in the present instance is, that we\r\nhave here the _Melinum_ offered as a panacea for every painful affection\r\nto which the eyes of the colonists and natives of Cirencester might be\r\nsubject, at the time that MINERVALIS practised amongst them. One of the\r\nforms of the Collyrium _Melinum_ given by Galen is professed by him to\r\nbe efficacious “ad omnem oculorum hebetudinem.”—(Kühn’s edit. vol. xii.\r\np. 786.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nSTAMP NO. XII.—FOUND IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\nA Roman medicine-stamp has lately turned up in these islands, in a\r\nlocality in which its presence could be little expected—viz., in the\r\ncounty of Tipperary, in Ireland. It has been described by Mr. Albert Way\r\nin an interesting paper, published after the first part of the present\r\nessay appeared in the _Monthly Journal of Medical Science_.[569] Dr.\r\nDowsley, of Clonmel, who now possesses this stone, has kindly furnished\r\nme with a wax impression of its inscription, and with the following note\r\nrelative to the locality in which it was discovered:—“It was found (he\r\nsays) near the village of Golden, parish of Relig-Murry, in the county\r\nof Tipperary, in a field near the ruins of an old hospital, or at least\r\nwhat was supposed to be such; but it was built at so remote a period,\r\nthat there is now no record of what the building was for, nor of the\r\nfounder of it, and so little of the walls are at present standing, that\r\neven the style of architecture cannot be known. The seal was discovered\r\nby a labourer when digging. There was no pottery nor coin found; but\r\nnear it was a human skeleton much decayed, the position of which in the\r\nground was not noticed. The soil in this field is peculiarly rich and\r\nvery deep; it is frequently carted away for manure; most likely it was\r\nan ancient burial-ground. The village of Golden is about a mile from the\r\nold Abbey of Athassel.”\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to discuss here how such a Roman relic reached this\r\npart of Ireland,[570] and whether it was conveyed there or not when the\r\nRomans were colonising Britain; or, what is probable, at a later period.\r\nBut I may merely remark, there can be no doubt that Roman civilisation\r\nand Roman practices spread in the earlier centuries of the Christian era\r\nto parts beyond the precise line of Roman conquest. Other Roman relics\r\nhave been found in Ireland,[571] though Ireland was never subject to the\r\nRoman arms; and Roman vases, ornaments, and coins, have been discovered\r\neven in those more distant and northern Scandinavian settlements, to\r\nwhich the Roman power never penetrated.[572]\r\n\r\nPlate III., No. XII., shows the figure of this Irish medicine-stamp. It\r\nis engraved only on one side, and the inscription runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n  M IUVEN TUTIANI\r\n  DIAMYSUS AD VET CIC\r\n\r\nM(_arci?_) JUVEN_tii_ TUTIANI DIAMYSUS AD VET_eres_ CIC_atrices_.—_The\r\nDiamysus of Marcus Juventius Tutianus, for old cicatrices._\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first line there is a small cut in the inscription\r\n(see Plate), which, in all probability, is not a letter, but a mark or\r\nornament intended to fill up that space. If a letter, it is most likely\r\nC, standing perhaps for collyrium.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Bath stone, I have already taken occasion to state\r\nthat this same inscription of _Diamysus ad veteres cicatrices_ has now\r\nbeen found on various Roman medicine-stamps discovered in different\r\nparts of France.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium DIAMISYOS or DIAMYSOS derived its designation from\r\ncontaining as its principal ingredient the _Misy_, a metallic vitriolic\r\npreparation, used to a considerable extent as a stimulant and escharotic\r\namong the ancients; and it was retained even to a comparatively late\r\nperiod in the London Pharmacopœia.[573] It appears to be still used\r\nmedicinally in the East.[574]\r\n\r\nThe chemical nature, however, of _Misy_ has given rise to some\r\nconsiderable doubt and discussion. It was usually found, and generally\r\ndescribed, along with two other cognate fossils, _Sori_ and _Chalcitis_.\r\nAnd Galen, who enters into an elaborate description of them, visited the\r\ncopper mines of Cyprus, with a view of determining the precise nature of\r\nthese three mineral substances.[575]\r\n\r\nDr. Adams,[576] who has examined this question with all his well-known\r\ngreat learning and care, believes that these three minerals were merely\r\nvarieties of _chalcanthum_ or copperas. In his opinion the _Chalcitis_\r\nwas probably a kind of pure sulphate of copper which had contracted an\r\nefflorescence from age; the _Sori_ was sulphate of copper combined with\r\nzinc or other impurities; and the _Misy_ was a combination of sulphate\r\nof copper with sulphate of iron, the predominance of the chalybeate salt\r\ngiving to the fossil its peculiar colour. For the Misy, says\r\nDioscorides, is “of a golden appearance, hard, shining like gold when\r\nbroken, and glancing like stars.”\r\n\r\nIn his remarks on the _Misy_, Dioscorides speaks of the analogy of its\r\ncaustic power with those of Chalcitis; but the only diseases that he\r\nreferred to as having the _Misy_ used in their treatment, are the\r\ndiseases of the eye. And he does so in telling us that the Egyptian kind\r\nof _Misy_ is quite inferior to the Cyprian in forming eye-medicines\r\n(ocularia medicamenta).[577]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of its medical powers, Galen,[578] Oribasius,[579] and\r\nPaulus Ægineta,[580] describe the _Misy_ as escharotic, and astringent.\r\nIn giving his list of eye-medicines, Galen places the _Misy_, _Sori_,\r\netc., amongst those local applications which have a detergent\r\neffect.[581] Paulus Ægineta enters the _Misy_ in his list of\r\n“detergents of foul ulcers” of the eye (vol. iii. p. 548). Pliny, in\r\ndescribing the properties of Misy, states that “extenuat scabrities\r\noculorum.”[582] Celsus in his work repeatedly alludes to the _Misy_ and\r\nits effects.[583] One of the collyria which he describes when treating\r\nof granular ophthalmia, contains the _Misy_ (see page 294). And he adds,\r\nthat with the exception of those affections which require mild\r\napplications, this special collyrium is adapted to every kind of\r\ndisorder of the eye (adversus omne genus oculorum valetudinis idoneum\r\nest). Galen (vol. xii. p. 736), Oribasius (lib. iv. p. 51), and Paulus\r\nÆgineta (vol. iii. 556), all give formulæ for the collyrium PANCHRESTOS\r\nof Erasistratus, which contained _Misy_ as its leading ingredient. “It\r\nhas,” says Paulus, “wonderful efficacy in diseases of the eyes.”\r\nOribasius enters it as a “compositio admirabilis.” The _Misy_, as a\r\nreputed “valedissimum medicamentum,” enters as an ingredient into\r\nseveral of the collyria described by Actuarius.[584]\r\n\r\nIn a previous page I have already taken occasion to state that Marcellus\r\nEmpiricus gives a formula for a collyrium under the name inscribed upon\r\nthe stone of the collyrium DIAMISYOS; and he describes it as calculated\r\n“ad aspritudines oculorum tollendas et ad lachrymas substringendas.”\r\n\r\nThe collyrium _Diamisyos_ of Marcellus Empiricus consists of _Misy_\r\nburnt till it becomes red, and then combined with spikenard, saffron,\r\ncadmia, calcined copper, opium, myrrh, Cyprian scales, and gum, with all\r\nwhich it was to be rubbed down in the best wine, shaken and filtered.\r\nBut he gives also the alternative of adding to the _Diamysos_ another\r\ningredient, which was long an article in the materia medica—viz.\r\nvipers. For some (he observes) add to the collyrium _Diamisyos_ “a\r\nviper, dried and baked well in the sun, as if it were salted” (quidam\r\nadjiciunt huic collyrio viperam siccam et arefactam bene in sole tanquam\r\nsi sit salita). He goes on, however, still further to explain that\r\nprayers and incantations must be used in making this addition to the\r\n_Diamisyos_. For (he observes) if you thus wish to add the dried viper,\r\nyou must first extract its bones, roll it up in linen, and then pour\r\nover it the wine of the collyrium, previously charming the viper (sed\r\nprius eam praecantabis) as follows, lest it cause tears and produce\r\nharm, saying, “As thou dost not see, even so may thy juice, when tasted,\r\nhurt no one, but I pray that with the purpose for which thou hast been\r\nadded, thou mayest[585] further the cure (quomodo tu non vides, sic et\r\ntuus succus gustatus nulli noceat, sed ob rem propter quam adjecta es\r\nproficias bene curationi, precor).”[586]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUARIAN NOTICES OF SYPHILIS IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical men are, for the most part, agreed upon two points in relation\r\nto the history of syphilis—viz. that it is a species of disease which\r\nwas unknown to the Greek, Roman, and Arabian physicians; and that it\r\nfirst began to prevail in Europe in the later years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe non-existence of syphilis in ancient times, and the circumstance of\r\nits original appearance in Europe about the date alluded to, are\r\nopinions strongly borne out by two sets of facts. For, first, no\r\ndefinite account of this marked and extraordinary species of disease is\r\nto be found in the writings of any one of the ancient Greek or Roman\r\nphysicians, historians, or poets; and, secondly, of the numerous authors\r\nwhose works exist in the learned collections of Luisinus,[587]\r\nAstruc,[588] and Girtanner,[589] and who saw and described the malady in\r\nthe later years of the fifteenth or commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, almost all comment upon it as (to use their own general\r\nexpressions) _morbus novus, morbus ignotus, ægritudo inaudita,\r\nægritudo nova, malum novum, novus et nostro orbe incognitus\r\nmorbus_, etc. etc.[590]\r\n\r\nIt would not, however, affect our present object were we to consider the\r\ndisease, as it appeared about the period in question, not to have been a\r\nnew malady previously totally unknown, but merely, as some have thought,\r\nan aggravated form of a disease formerly existing in so mild a form as\r\nnot to have attracted general observation.\r\n\r\nNor need I stop here to inquire into the much more difficult questions\r\nof the probable source of syphilis, and the exact date at which syphilis\r\nfirst burst forth in Europe. In relation to the object which I have at\r\npresent in view, it matters not whether the malady sprang up\r\nspontaneously and endemically in Spain, Italy, or France, at the era in\r\nquestion; or was imported from Africa, as Grüner,[591] Infessura,[592]\r\nand others allege; or from Hispaniola, as Astruc,[593] Girtanner,[594]\r\nWeatherhead,[595] and various other authorities, have stoutly and not\r\nunsuccessfully maintained. Nor is it necessary for me to discuss whether\r\nit first showed itself in 1493, as Sanchez[596] and Hensler[597]\r\nconsider that they have proved; or in 1492, as Fulgosi[598] asserts; or\r\nas early even as the month of October 1483, as Peter Pinctor,[599] in\r\n1500, demonstrated astrologically, to his own complete satisfaction at\r\nleast, that it ought to have done, inasmuch as that was—as he\r\nsagaciously convinced himself—the precise and exact date of the\r\nconjunction of Venus with Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury; and the\r\nconjunction of these or other stars in the heavens above, was—so he and\r\nmany of the astrological physicians of his day believed—the undoubted\r\norigin of this new scourge on the earth below.\r\n\r\nIn such a notice as the present, we may most safely, I believe, and that\r\ntoo without entertaining the question of the exact source or\r\ngeographical origin of syphilis, start from the general proposition that\r\nthe disease was in 1494 and 1495 first distinctly recognised in Italy,\r\nduring the invasion of that country by the victorious army of Charles\r\nVIII. of France. The malady is usually allowed to have first broken out\r\nin a very marked degree at Naples, about the time that Charles took\r\npossession of that city, in the spring of 1495; or nearly two years\r\nafter Columbus’ return from his first voyage to Hispaniola. Charles set\r\nout again for France in May 1495; and the malady seems to have been both\r\ndiffused by his infected troops along the line of their northward march,\r\nand afterwards carried to their respective homes by his own French\r\nsoldiers, as well as by his various Swiss, German, and Flemish\r\nauxiliaries.\r\n\r\nBut it is as little my intention at present to trace the progress as to\r\nascertain the first origin of syphilis in Europe. The chief object of\r\nthe present communication is to adduce some data which show that the new\r\nmalady was not long in reaching the shores of Scotland, and in\r\nspreading to different towns in that kingdom. In proof of this, I have\r\nprincipally to appeal to one or two old edicts and ordinances relative\r\nto the disease, and to other collateral but slighter evidence bearing\r\nupon the subject. The edicts or statutes in question were issued by the\r\nTown-Council of Aberdeen, in relation to the existence of the malady in\r\nAberdeen; and by the Privy Council of Scotland, in relation to the\r\nprevalence of the disease in Edinburgh. The two first edicts in both\r\nplaces were issued in 1497. That of Aberdeen is the earlier. It is dated\r\nthe 21st of April 1497. Its words, as they stand in the old and\r\ncarefully preserved Council Records of that city,[600] are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n“The said day, it was statut and ordanit be the Alderman and Consale for\r\nthe eschevin _of the infirmitey cumm out of Franche and strang partis_,\r\nthat all licht weman be chargit and ordanit to decist fra thar vices and\r\nsyne of venerie, and all thair buthis and houssis skalit, and thai to\r\npas and wirk for thar sustentacioun vndir the payne of ane key of het\r\nyrne one thair chekis, and banysene of the toune.” (Vol. i. p. 425.)\r\n\r\nA few years later—or on the 8th October 1507—a long list of statutes\r\nwas passed by the “Prouest, bailyes, and counsale” of Aberdeen, for the\r\n“common proffitt, weil, and gud reull of the burgh.” Two of these\r\nstatutes refer again to the introduction and spread of syphilis. By the\r\nfirst of these statutes it was enacted “That diligent inquisitioun be\r\ntakin of ale infect personis with this strange _seiknes of Nappillis_,\r\nfor the sauetie of the town; and the personis beand infectit therwith\r\nbe chargit to keip thaime in their howssis and vther places fra the\r\nhaill folkis.” (Vol. i. p. 437.)\r\n\r\nTwo or three enactments follow in the “statut buk” on minor subjects,\r\none ordering the hygienic measure “that thar salbe certane personis to\r\ncleng the toun and dicht the causaies;” and then succeeds another\r\nsanitary ordinance relative to the avoidance of syphilis—viz. “That\r\nnayne infeccht folkis with the _seiknes of Napillis_ be haldin at the\r\ncommon fleschouss, or with the fleschouris, baxteris, brousteris,\r\nladinaris, for sauete of the toun, and the personis infectit sale keip\r\nthame quyat in thar houssis, zhardis, or vther comat placis, quhill thai\r\nbe haill, for the infectioun of their nichtbouris.” (P. 437.)\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh edict regarding syphilis was six months later in date than\r\nthe first of those issued by the magistrates of Aberdeen, and is more\r\nlengthy in its details and provisions. It was drawn up, as I have\r\nalready said, by the King’s Privy Council, and apparently sent to the\r\nmagistrates for due execution. It is preserved in the first volume of\r\nthe _Town Records of Edinburgh_, fol. 33, 34, and is entitled in the\r\nrubric “Ane Grangore Act;”—Grandgore being an early term often applied\r\nto syphilis in Scotland. This edict has been repeatedly printed, but\r\nusually in a very incorrect form. The exact date and words of it are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“xxii Septembris anno i^ai iiii^c lxxxxvii zeiris. It is our Souerane\r\nLordis will and the command of the Lordis of his Counsale send to the\r\nProvest and baillies within this burch, that this proclamatioune follow\r\nand be put till executioune for the eschewing of the greit apperand\r\ndanger of the infectioune of his liegis fra this contagius seiknes\r\ncallit the Grandgor, and the greit vther skayth that may occure to his\r\nlegeis and inhabitouris within this burch—that is to say—We charge\r\nstraitlie and commandis be the authoritie abone written, that all maner\r\nof personis being within the fredome of this burch quhilkis ar infectit\r\nor hes bene infectit vncurit with this said contagious plage callit the\r\nGrandgor, devoyd red and pas furth of this toun and compeir vpoun the\r\nsandis of Leith at x houris befoir none, and thair sall thai haue and\r\nfynd botis reddie in the havin ordanit to thame be the officiaris of\r\nthis burch reddely furneist with victuallis to haue thame to the Inche,\r\nand thair to remane quhill God prouyde for thair health, and that all\r\nvther personis the quhilkis takis vpoune thame to hale the said\r\ncontagious infirmitie and takis[601] the cure thairof, that they devoyd\r\nand pas with thame, sua that nane of thir personis quhilkis takis sic\r\ncure vpoune thame vse the samyn cure within this burch in presens nor\r\npeirt ony maner of way—and quha sa beis fundin infectit and nocht\r\npassand to the Inche as said is be Monounday at the sone ganging to, and\r\nin lykwayis the saidis personis that takis the said cure of sanitie\r\nvpoun thame gif thai will vse the samyn thai and ilk of thame sal be\r\nbrynt on the cheik with the marking irne that thai may be kennit in tyme\r\nto cum—and thairefter gif ony thame remanis that thai sall be banisht\r\nbut fauouris.”\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary to add that the measures adopted by the public\r\nauthorities in Aberdeen and Edinburgh were utterly inadequate to arrest\r\nthe further dissemination of syphilis after it was inoculated upon the\r\ncountry. It seems indeed to have been spread to the more populous towns\r\nof Scotland within a year or two after its first introduction into the\r\nkingdom. There are some references in official documents of the period\r\nwhich incidentally but amply prove this rapidity in its diffusion.\r\n\r\nThe notices to which I here specially refer exist in the Accounts of the\r\nLord High Treasurer of Scotland. The Register House, Edinburgh, contains\r\na curious and valuable series of these Accounts, detailing the daily\r\nexpenses of the kings of Scotland from the reign of James III. down to\r\nthe ascension of the English throne by James VI. At the time of the\r\nfirst appearance of syphilis in our northern realm, the throne of\r\nScotland was occupied by James IV., a prince who was a great patron of\r\nthe arts and sciences of his time. He was a practitioner in them also,\r\nas well as a patron of them. At different times we find him busily\r\nexperimenting in chemistry, in physiology, and in medicine. His daily\r\nexpense-books contain many entries of purchases for instruments and\r\nmaterials to make the unmakeable “quinta essentia,” or philosopher’s\r\nstone; and he had laboratories for these investigations both at\r\nEdinburgh and Stirling. His alchemical assistant—John the Leeche—whom\r\nhe had imported from the Continent and made Abbot of Tungland,\r\nexperimented for the king in physiology as well as in chemistry. John,\r\nDædalus-like, undertook to prove the improvability of human progression\r\nby flying to France with wings. “To that effect he causet (states Bishop\r\nLesley[602]) mak ane pair of wingis of fedderis, quhilkis beand fessinit\r\napoun him, he flew off the castell wall of Striveling, but shortly he\r\nfell to the ground and brak his thee bane.” But the doctrine of\r\nsympathies was in vogue in these days, and by that doctrine the\r\nafflicted Abbot easily, of course, and clearly explained all. For the\r\ncause of his fall, or “the wyt thairof he asscryvit to that thair was\r\nsum hen fedderis in the wingis, quhilk yarnit and covet the mydding and\r\nnot the skyis.” Like the Egyptian king mentioned by Herodotus, King\r\nJames made also a physiological or rather philological experiment to\r\nascertain the primeval language of mankind; and for this purpose his\r\nMajesty sent a deaf and dumb woman to live with and bring up two young\r\nchildren upon the island of Inchkeith in the Firth of Forth—the same\r\nisland to which we have found the first victims of syphilis previously\r\nbanished, and itself the old “Urbs Guidi” of the venerable Bede. When\r\nthe two children, the companions of the “dumb voman cam to the aige of\r\nperfyte speach, some sayes” (to quote the account of Lindsay of\r\nPitscottie) “they spak guid Hebrew;”[603] but the cautious old Scottish\r\nchronicler sagely doubts the truth of this tradition. King James\r\npersonally practised the art of leechcraft, as well as experimented in\r\nalchemy and physiology. “He was,” says Pitscottie, “weill learned in the\r\nairt of medicine, and was ane singular guid chirurgiane; and thair was\r\nnone of that professioune, if they had any dangerous cure in hand, bot\r\nwould have craved his adwyse” (p. 249). So states the ancient Scottish\r\nhistorian. The High Treasurer’s Account shows that the king had in one\r\nimportant respect a right royal way of gaining patients,—a way by the\r\nadoption of which he probably might have secured a considerable\r\nconsultation and private practice even in these modern days of\r\nhigh-pressure rivalry, and keen competition. For he paid his patients,\r\ninstead of being paid by them. Thus, for example, in his daily\r\nexpense-book, under the date of April 14th and 15th, 1491, are the two\r\nfollowing entries:—\r\n\r\n“Item to Domenico to gif the king leve to lat him blud, xviii\r\nshillings.” “Item til a man yat come to Lythgow to lat the king blud\r\nand did it nocht, xviii shillings.”\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards he buys from a travelling pedlar “thre compases,\r\nane hammer, and a turcase to tak out teeth;” and forthwith, we find the\r\nScottish king becoming—like the more modern Peter the Great of\r\nRussia—not a dentist to royalty, but himself a royal dentist, as the\r\ntwo following entries may suffice to show (the first of them—provided\r\nthere be any truth whatever in dental orthography—surely indicating a\r\ntooth of rather a tough and tusky character):—\r\n\r\n“Item, to ane fallow, because the king pullit furtht his twtht, xviii\r\nshillings.”\r\n\r\n“Item, to Kynnard, ye barbour, for tua teith drawin furtht of his hed\r\nbe the king, xviii shillings.”\r\n\r\nHe seems to have tried his royal hand also at ocular surgery. But the\r\nterms of the following entry would seem rather ominously to hint that he\r\nwas not a very successful operator for cataract:—\r\n\r\n“Item, giffin to ye blind wif yat hed her eyne schorne, xiii shillings.”\r\n\r\nA prince imbued with such medical and surgical propensities would\r\nnaturally feel deeply interested in the first appearance within his\r\nrealm of such a malady as syphilis; and in his Treasurer’s accounts\r\nthere are several entries indicating that the king had bestowed monies\r\nupon various persons affected with this disease. Perhaps these monies\r\nwere given less in the way of alms than in the way of a reward for the\r\nking’s medication of the patients; less for the behoof of royal charity\r\nthan of royal chirurgery. The entries I advert to all occur during the\r\ncurrency of the years 1497 and 1498.[604] They are as follows:—the\r\nfirst sum given away being to a person at Dalry, when the king was on\r\none of his many pilgrimages to the ancient and holy shrine of St. Ninian\r\nat Whitehorn, in Wigtownshire.\r\n\r\n  September 1497.\r\n\r\n“Item, to ane woman with the grantgore thair [Dalrye, in Ayrshire],\r\nbe the kingis command                               iijs. vjd.”\r\n\r\n  2 October 1497.\r\n\r\n“Item to thaim that hed the grantgor at Linlithquho      viijd.”\r\n\r\n  21 February 1497-8.\r\n\r\n“Item, that samyn day at the tounne end of Strivelin to the\r\nseke folk in the grantgore                                 ijs.”\r\n\r\n  22 February 1497-8.\r\n\r\n“Item, the xxij day of Februar giffin to the seke folk in the\r\ngrangore at the tounn end of Glasgo.                       ijs.”\r\n\r\n  April 1498.\r\n\r\n“... seke folk in grangor in Lithgw as the King\r\ncom in the tounne                                   ijs. viijd.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding remarks I have had occasion to adduce\r\nseven or eight different notices with regard to the appearance of\r\nsyphilis in various cities and districts of Scotland during the years\r\n1497-8, as at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Linlithgow, etc. A\r\ndiversity of allusions to the same disease, of a less direct and\r\nofficial character, and somewhat later in date, may be traced in various\r\nolden Scottish works and writings. The malady is occasionally alluded\r\nto, for example, in the reports left us of some of the old criminal and\r\nother trials of Scotland. Thus a minute in the Records of the Privy Seal\r\nof Scotland records the punishment of a medical man in whose hands a\r\ndignitary of the church had died while under treatment for syphilis. The\r\nentry is as follows:—\r\n\r\nJanuary 18th, 1509.—“Respitt made to Thomas Lyn, burges of Edinburgh,\r\nfor ye slauchtir of umquihile Schir Lancelote Patonsoun, chapellain,\r\nquhilk happinit be negligent cure and medicine yat ye said Thomas\r\ntuk one him to cure and hele ye said umquhile Schir Lancelote of ye\r\ninfirmitie of ye Grantgor yat he was infekkit with. To endure for xix\r\nyeeris. (Subscripsit per dominum Regem apud Edinburghe.)”[605]\r\n\r\nSome, perhaps, of my professional brethren may think that this nineteen\r\nyears’ banishment from the town was a proper punishment for an\r\nunprofessional charlatan undertaking the cure of syphilis in the\r\nsixteenth century; and some, possibly, may even hold, that it would not\r\nbe an improper proceeding in this—the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe disease is alluded to in some of the old Scotch witch trials of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these trials was that of a lady of station\r\nand wealth—Euphame Macalzane, daughter of Lord Cliftonhall, a judge of\r\nthe Court of Session. Among other matters, she was “indyted and accusit”\r\nof using, during the birth of her two sons, anæsthetics in the form of\r\ncharms, and a fairy stone “layit under the bowster,” whereby, in the\r\nwords of the dittay, “your seiknes was cassin of you unnaturallie, in\r\nthe birth of your fyrst sone upon ane dog, quhilk ranne away and wes\r\nnewir sene agane. And in the birth of your last sone, the same prakteis\r\nfoirsaid wes usit, and your naturall and kindlie payne, unnaturallie\r\ncassin of you uponn the wantonne cat in the house, quhilk lyke wyis wes\r\nnewer sene thair efter.” In the fourteenth item of her indictment she is\r\naccused of trying to break off a marriage by “certane witchcraft,” and\r\nby alleging that the intended bridegroom had the “glengore.” For these\r\nand other analogous crimes this unfortunate lady was “takin to the\r\nCastel-Hill of Edinburghe, and thair bund to ane staik, and brunt in\r\nassis, quick to the death.”[606]\r\n\r\nThere are also various sarcastic allusions to syphilis by the Scottish\r\npoets of these early days, amply testifying to the fact of its rapid\r\ndiffusion both among the followers of the court—who were then the most\r\ncommon objects of poetical satire—and among the community at large.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar, the flower of the old Scottish poets, was, at the period\r\nof the first introduction of syphilis in 1497, in the prime of manhood;\r\nand in two or three years afterwards, viz. in 1500, he was attached to\r\nJames IV. and his court by an annual state pension. In a number of\r\nverses addressed to his patroness, Margaret, the Queen of James IV. and\r\nthe sister of Henry VIII.—verses which appear to us at the present day,\r\nand with our existing standards of taste, as utterly degraded and\r\nindecent—Dunbar commemorates the communication of the new disease under\r\nthe name of the “pockis” and the “Spanyie pokis,” to the Queen’s men (as\r\nhe terms them) during the jollities of Fastern’s e’en, and the reign of\r\nthe Abbot of Unreason; and he closes his stanzas with an earnest advice\r\nto all youths, to\r\n\r\n  “Be ware with that perrelous play\r\n   That men callis libbing of the Pockis.”[607]\r\n\r\nThe after effects and consequences of the disease he describes as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  “Sum that war ryatouss as rammis,\r\n   Ar now maid tame lyk ony lammis,\r\n     And settin doun lyk scarye crockis,\r\n   And hes forsaikin all sic gammis\r\n     That men call libbing of the Pockis.”\r\n\r\n  “Sum thocht thame selffis stark lyk gyandis,\r\n   Ar now maid weak lyk willow wandis,\r\n     With schinnis scharp, and small lyk rockis,\r\n   And gottin thair bak in bayth thair handis,\r\n     For ower oft libbing of the Pockis.”\r\n\r\nAnother and later poet of that age, Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount,\r\nalludes to the occurrence of syphilis at the Christmas feasts in an\r\ninferior officer of the court—viz. in John Mackrery, the king’s\r\n“fule,” or royal jester, who, according to the poet—like many a poor\r\nfool since John’s time—did\r\n\r\n “In his maist triumphand gloir\r\n  For his reward get the Grandgoir.”[608]\r\n\r\nThe same author includes this disease elsewhere (p. 147) among the\r\nmaladies\r\n\r\n “Quhilk humane nature dois abhor,\r\n  As in the Gut, Gravel, and Gor.”\r\n\r\nA metrical translation of Hector Boece’s _History of Scotland_ was made\r\nin the earlier half of the sixteenth century, apparently by command of\r\nJames V. It has been published for the first time, within the last two\r\nyears, under the authority and direction of the Master of the Rolls. The\r\nauthor of this rhyming _Buik of the Chronicles of Scotland_, William\r\nStewart, when translating Boece’s account of the fatal disease produced\r\nin the old mythical Scotch king, Ferquhard, by the bite of a wolf, tells\r\nus (vol. ii. p. 313) that the resulting gangrenous wound defied the\r\nskill of the leiches, and the fœtor of it, and its discharges were\r\n\r\n “Moir horribill als that time for till abhor,\r\n  No canker, fester, gut, or yit Grandgor.”\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated old poem of the _General Satire of Scotland_,\r\nattributed by most authorities to Dunbar, and which, from some\r\ncircumstances adverted to in the course of it, is supposed by Sibbald\r\nand Chalmers to have been written in 1504 (seven years after the first\r\nintroduction of syphilis), the author deplores the extent to which the\r\ndisease had by that time already spread in Scotland, observing—\r\n\r\n “Sic losing sarkis, so mony Glengoir markis,\r\n  Within this land was nevir hard nor sene.”[609]\r\n\r\nIn several of the notices which I have just quoted, the new disease,\r\nsyphilis, is alluded to under the names of “Gor,” “Gore,” “Grandgore,”\r\netc. Few maladies have been loaded with a more varied and more extensive\r\nnomenclature. The terms in question, “Gore” and “Grandgore,” are of\r\nFrench origin, and are old names corresponding to pox and great\r\npox—“verole” and “grand verole.” In the earlier periods of the history\r\nof syphilis they were terms commonly employed by the French themselves\r\nto designate the affection. To quote one confirmatory sentence from\r\nAstruc (p. 1166), the disease “Gore et Grandgore a Gallis initio vocata\r\nerat.” John le Maire, in his celebrated poem on syphilis, published in\r\n1520, gives this as one of the designations of the disease used at that\r\ntime by the commonalty:—\r\n\r\n “La nommoit Gorre ou la verole grosse,\r\n  Qui n’espargnoit ne couronne ne crosse.”[610]\r\n\r\nOld Rabelais, whose _Gargantua_ and _Pantagruel_ are perfect\r\nrepositories of the low and licentious French words of the era at which\r\nsyphilis first appeared, uses the term Grandgore as a synonym for\r\nsyphilis; and in his wild allegorical style he makes the poor and\r\nwidowed poet, Rammagrobis, take this grandgore to bed for his second\r\nwife. The term Grandgore seems to have been applied to the disease in\r\nScotland for a long time after its introduction. For example, the\r\nauthor of the _Historie of the Kennedys_ quotes a letter written in the\r\nlatter part of the sixteenth century by the Laird of Colzean to the\r\nLaird of Bargany, whose “neise was laich,” maliciously suggesting to him\r\nthat yet he might lose “sum uther joynt of the Glengoir, as ye did the\r\nbrig of your neise.”[611] Still later, or in 1600, the Kirk-Session of\r\nGlasgow requested the magistrates “to consult the chirurgeons how the\r\ninfectious distemper of Glengore could be removed from the city.”[612]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, as elsewhere, the disease also passed under other\r\ndesignations. When syphilis first broke out it was frequently, as is\r\nwell known, designated from the country or people from whom it was\r\nsupposed to have been transmitted. Thus, the Italians and Germans at\r\nfirst generally spoke of it as the French disease; while the French\r\ntalked of it as the disease of Naples; and the Dutch, Flemings,\r\nPortuguese, and Moors, applied to it the name of the Spanish pocks or\r\nCastilian malady. Dunbar, in the Scottish poem already alluded to as\r\naddressed to Queen Margaret, speaks of it, in most of the stanzas, under\r\nthe simple title of “pockis,” but in one he gives it, as I have already\r\nhinted, the distinctive and significant appellation of the Spanish\r\npocks:—\r\n\r\n “I saw cow-clinkis me besyd;\r\n  The young men to thair howssis gyd,\r\n    Had better liggit in the stockis;\r\n  Sum fra the bordell wald nocht byd,\r\n    Quhill that thai gatt the Spanyie Pockis.”\r\n\r\nIn two of the Aberdeen Town-Council entries we have already seen the\r\nmalady spoken of as “the sickness of Naples.” This name was at first\r\noften applied to the malady. The disease was, however, much more\r\ngenerally known in Scotland and in the other kingdoms of Europe under\r\nthe name of the French pox. The first Aberdeen edict speaks of it in\r\n1497 as the “infirmity come out of France.” In the manuscript Session\r\nRecords of the parish of Ormiston for 1662, there is an entry regarding\r\nthe malady under the appellation of the French pox, one of the minutes\r\nbeing—\r\n\r\n“The minister, Mr. Sinclair, hath given out to James Ogilvy,\r\napothecary-chirurgeon, for curing William Whitly, his wife and daughter,\r\nof the French pockis, 35 lbs. Scots.”\r\n\r\nGrunbeck and Brandt, who wrote on syphilis in 1496, when speaking of the\r\ndiffusion of the disease at that early date over Europe, both allude in\r\nvery vague and general terms to its having invaded France, Germany,\r\netc., and reached as far as Britain.[613] But the earliest specific\r\nnotice of syphilis in England which I remember to have met with is in\r\n1502; and in this notice the malady is spoken of under the same name\r\nthat I have been adverting to, of “French pox.” The notice in question\r\nis contained in the interesting Privy Purse Expense Book of Elizabeth of\r\nYork, the queen of Henry VII., edited by Sir Harris Nicolas. This\r\ncharitable lady seems from these records to have had several protégés\r\nunder her immediate care and keeping. Among these protégés is entered\r\nJohn Pertriche, one “of the sonnes of mad Beale.” There are various\r\narticles of expenditure noted in the Queen’s private expense book as\r\nlavished upon this John Pertriche during the currency of 1503; as monies\r\nfor his “dyetts,” for buying “shirtes,” “shoyn,” and “hosyn,” “cloth for\r\na gown,” and “fustyan for a cote” to him. There are twenty pence\r\nexpended “for his lernyng;” and the last two items in the account record\r\nattempts of two different and rather opposite kinds to amend the mental\r\nand moral deficiencies of this hopeful youth. These two ultimate items\r\nare—\r\n\r\n“For a prymer and saulter (book to John), 20 pence.”\r\n“And payed to a Surgeon whiche heled him of the Frenche pox, 20\r\nshillings.”\r\n\r\nTo finish this very rough and meagre sketch, let me here add that by the\r\nend of the sixteenth century—and perhaps long before that date—the\r\nmalady was abundant enough in England. Writing in 1596, or in the time\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, William Clowes, “one of her Majesties chirurgians,”\r\nobserves to his “friendly reader,” “If I be not deceived in mine\r\nopinion, I suppose the disease itselfe was never more rife in Naples,\r\nItalie, France, or Spain, than it is in this day in the Realme of\r\nEngland.”[614]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding notices, however brief and imperfect, relative to the\r\nfirst introduction and dissemination of syphilis in Scotland, are not\r\nsimply matters calculated to gratify mere antiquarian curiosity. They\r\nappear to me to be capable of a much higher application, for they offer\r\nso many elements tending to illustrate the general history of the first\r\nappearance of syphilis in Europe. Besides, we may, I believe, be\r\njustified in drawing from the data they afford several not uninteresting\r\nnor unimportant corollaries, both in regard to the first origin and mode\r\nof propagation of the disease, and the distinction of it from other\r\naffections with which it has sometimes been confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1st Corollary._—These notices tend to corroborate the pathological\r\nopinion, that syphilis was a species of disease new to Europe when it\r\nfirst excited the attention of physicians and historians in the last\r\nyears of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nLike the numerous list of contemporary authors and physicians quoted by\r\nAstruc, Grüner, and Weatherhead, the Aberdeen edict speaks of syphilis\r\nin the last years of the fifteenth century as a disease hitherto\r\nunknown, “the infirmity come out of France and foreign parts.” The\r\nEdinburgh edict mentions it as “_a_ contagious disease callit the\r\ngrandgore.” If it had been previously known, the definite, and not the\r\nindefinite, article would have, in all probability, been employed. And\r\nif such a disease had previously existed on the continent of Europe,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that it would have also existed and\r\nbeen known in Britain. Besides, this reasoning certainly admits of being\r\ninverted and changed, in so far that we may probably lay it down with\r\nequal justice, that if the disease was new, as it would appear to have\r\nbeen, in Scotland at that time, it was in all probability new also to\r\nthe other kingdoms of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2d Corollary._—But if syphilis was thus new in Britain in the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, this shows that it is a species of disease\r\ndistinct and different alike—1st, from gonorrhœa, and, 2d, from\r\nGreek leprosy, with both of which maladies it has, as is now well known,\r\nbeen occasionally confounded; for both these maladies existed, and were\r\nabundantly recognised, in this, as in other countries, long before the\r\nera of the introduction of syphilis. Gonorrhœa was early\r\ndistinguished by English authors under the name of “burning,” or\r\n“brenning” (_ardor urinæ_, _arsura_, etc.) Thus, Andrew Borde, in his\r\n“_Breviary of Health_,” 1546, speaks of it as the “burning of an\r\nharlotte.” “Burning of harlottes” is also mentioned in Bulleyn’s\r\n_Bulwark of Defence_, 1562. But it is under this same name that\r\nreference is made to the same disease in one of the ordinances enacted\r\nabout 1430, for the better regulation of the eighteen brothels that\r\nstood for centuries on the Bankside in Southwark, under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Bishop of Winchester. At the above date it was decreed that “no\r\nstewholder keep noo woman wythin his hous that hath any sickness of\r\nbrenning.”[615] This statute was enacted half-a-century before the\r\nintroduction of syphilis in England; and nearly a century previously,\r\ngonorrhœa had been accurately described, among others, by John Arden,\r\nsurgeon to Richard II., who, writing about 1380, gave a correct summary\r\nof the symptoms, pathology, and treatment of this malady. In an old\r\nEnglish medical poem, evidently written not later than the last part of\r\nthe fourteenth century, and published lately by Mr. Stephens of\r\nCopenhagen, there is a receipt for “all maner brenninge” (line 294);\r\nand then follows a series of cures (line 510, etc.)—\r\n\r\n               “if ye verge be brente\r\n  As man of woman may so be schente,\r\n  Thorow cas yᵗ womā may be his bote\r\n  Off qwom his sekenesse be gan ye rote.”[616]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, further, that gonorrhœa was well known to the\r\nGreek, Roman, and Arabic authors, and is described unmistakably in their\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nI might also, if it were here necessary, adduce abundant evidence to\r\nshow that the two diseases, Greek leprosy and syphilis, though sometimes\r\nconfounded together, were always in general regarded as two entirely\r\ndifferent affections; and that, as such, the hospitals severally\r\nappointed for the reception of those unfortunates labouring under the\r\ndiseases in question were kept distinct and separate. Thus, in 1527, the\r\nCarmelite monk, Paul Elia, proposed to the burgomaster of Copenhagen a\r\nplan for an hospital outside the town for “syphilis, cancer, and other\r\ngreat sores,” similar to the Leper Hospital already existing;[617] for\r\nsyphilis had, at an early period of its existence, spread itself into\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nWhen syphilis broke out in Edinburgh, in 1497, those affected by it were\r\nnot sent to the leper hospital then existing near the town, but they\r\nwere ordered off to Inchkeith. In the course of the next century, we\r\nfind in the Kirk Session books of Glasgow the two maladies recognised as\r\ndistinct, and two separate hospitals devoted to those affected by these\r\ntwo separate diseases. For on the 20th October 1586, the Kirk Session\r\n“ordains some to visit the leper folks’ house or spittal beyond the\r\nbrig, to see how the same, and the dykes of the yards may be reformed,\r\nand that nane be received but town’s folks.” But again, in 1592, the\r\nsame Session directed “that the house beyond the stable-green-port for\r\nwomen afflicted with the Glengore be looked after.”[618]\r\n\r\nIn a late census of Norway, above two thousand lepers were found in that\r\nsmall kingdom; but the Scandinavian physicians do not confound together\r\nsyphilis and Greek elephantiasis, and have no difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing them. Nor have our own colonial professional men in the\r\nEast and in the West Indies, where both diseases exist, any dubiety, at\r\nthe present day, in recognising them as two totally different and\r\nspecific maladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3d Corollary._—As regards the mode or modes in which syphilis was\r\nsupposed to be so speedily propagated at its first appearance in Europe,\r\nthe Aberdeen and Edinburgh records are both interesting, though in some\r\nrespects they offer very opposite testimony on this point.\r\n\r\nFor some time after syphilis broke out, it was believed, both by medical\r\nmen and by the non-medical public, that the disease was communicable,\r\nand constantly communicated from the infected to the healthy by the\r\nemployment of the clothes, vessels, baths, etc., used by those already\r\nsuffering from it, and by the slightest corporeal contact, or even by\r\ninhaling the same air with them. I might appeal on this head, if it\r\nwere necessary, to the individual and general testimony of Schilling,\r\nTorella, Brandt, Massa, and almost every other early continental author,\r\nhistorical or medical, who mentions the first outbreak of syphilis. Some\r\neven thought that neither the presence of infected persons, nor of\r\nfomites, was always absolutely requisite. In his work, _De Morbo\r\nGallico_, published in 1551 (above half-a-century after the disease\r\ncommenced), Benedict Victorius, of Fienga, like most of his\r\ncontemporaries, still maintained that “the state of the air” (to use his\r\nown words), “together with that of the putrid humours, are sufficient to\r\nbeget the affection;” and in strong confirmation, he adds, “I myself\r\nhappened once to know some honest and religious nuns, who were confined\r\nin the strictest manner, and yet contracted the venereal disease from\r\nthe peculiar state of the air, together with that of the putrid humours,\r\nand the weakness of their habit of body.”\r\n\r\nThe same belief in the easy contagion of syphilis without contact or\r\nintercourse extended to our own country. It was, in particular, strongly\r\nbelieved that the malady could be propagated from the sick to the\r\nhealthy by the medium of the breath. One of the gravest articles of\r\nguilt brought against the celebrated Cardinal Wolsey, when he was\r\narraigned before the English House of Lords in 1529, was the allegation\r\nthat (to quote the _ipsissima verba_ of the indictment, as laid before\r\nHenry VIII.), “whereas your Grace is our Sovereign Lord and Head, in\r\nwhom standeth all the surety and wealth of this realm, the same Lord\r\nCardinal, knowing himself to have the foul and contagious disease of the\r\ngreat pox, broken out upon him in divers places of his body, came daily\r\nto your Grace, rowning in your ear, and blowing upon your most noble\r\nGrace with his perilous and infective breath, to the marvellous danger\r\nof your Highness, if God of his infinite goodness had not better\r\nprovided for your Highness. And when he was once healed of them, he made\r\nyour Grace believe that his disease was an impostume in his head, and of\r\nnone other thing.”[619]\r\n\r\nThe notion that the breath of persons having the venereal disease was\r\ninfectious seems to have prevailed as late as the reign of William and\r\nMary. Dr. Oates, in his _Picture of the late King James_ (1696),\r\nsays,—“Tom Jones, your quondam chaplain, was afraid to go to old\r\nSheldon, for fear he should give him the pox by breathing on him.” (Part\r\nII. p. 106.)\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh regulations of September 1497 are evidently framed upon\r\nthe idea that “the contagious plage callit the grandgore,” as they term\r\nit, was propagated by simple contact, and personal intercourse, or\r\nprobably even by the air. Hence their strict injunctions for the removal\r\nand detention of the “infectit, or that hes bene infectit and incurit,”\r\nto their secluded position upon the island of Inchkeith, for “the\r\neschewing” (to cite again the words of the edict) “of the greit apperand\r\ndanger of the infectioune of the lieges.” Indeed, it seems to have been\r\nbelieved that the disease might be communicated through medical\r\nattendants, or intermediate individuals who were themselves unaffected.\r\nThis is at least the natural, or, indeed, the only interpretation of\r\nthat part of the edict which enjoined that all persons who take upon\r\nthem “to hale the said contagious infirmitie,” go with their infected\r\npatients to Inchkeith; and if they attended and treated such cases\r\nwithin the city, they did so at the peril of being themselves cauterised\r\non the cheek with the “marking iron,” and banished without favour\r\n(banisht but favouris) out of the town.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the authors of the Edinburgh regulations to prevent this\r\nsupposed medium of communication through a third person is further\r\ndisplayed in the severity of the punishment—(the application, namely,\r\nof the actual cautery to the face)—denounced against the medical\r\nattendants who should infringe the above edict by not passing to, and\r\nremaining on, Inchkeith. “Lykwayis the saidis personis that takis the\r\nsaid cure of sanitie vpoun thame, sal be byrnt on the cheike with the\r\nmarking irne that thai may be kennit in tyme to cum.”\r\n\r\nFor some time after the first outburst of the disease, sexual\r\nintercourse with the infected does not seem to have been suspected as\r\nthe source and means by which the syphilitic contagion was propagated.\r\nNor was the local primary affection of the sexual organs generally\r\nnoticed by the authors of these times as either a constant or marked\r\nsymptom. They were acquainted with, and described, only the secondary\r\nsymptoms of the malady—the hideous eruptions on the skin—the ulcers of\r\nthe throat—the nocturnal pains in, and lesions of, the bones—while\r\nthey mostly all pass over the genital organs, as if they remained\r\nunaffected. So much so was this the case, that we find Montagnana, in\r\n1498, advising not as a means of infection, but rather as a means of\r\ncure, moderate coition; for, in laying down various rules of treatment\r\nto a sick bishop under his care for syphilis, he inculcates, among\r\nother items “coitus vero sit temperatus.”[620]\r\n\r\nWhen treating of this subject, and when speaking of both the usual mode\r\nof the infection of syphilis and its primary local symptoms generally\r\nescaping notice at the era of the first appearance of the disease,\r\nSwediaur observes,—“It is worthy of remark, that although many authors,\r\nsince the year 1500, make mention of the genital organs, and say that\r\nsyphilis may more generally (ut plurimum) be communicated by coition;\r\nnot one before that time (1500) points out the (primary) affection as\r\nessential or characteristic of the disease. All (Swediaur adds) look\r\nupon it as a disease pestilential and contagious without coition, and\r\neven without any direct contact” (vol. i. p. 36). The observations of\r\nAstruc and Girtanner, and other authors on this point, are nearly to the\r\nsame effect.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this question, that of the actual mode and means of\r\npropagation of syphilis, the edict of Aberdeen, in 1497, is particularly\r\nremarkable and interesting, and most fully maintains the character of\r\nthe capital of the north for that native shrewdness and sagacity which\r\nthe poet Dunbar long ago solemnly assigned to it. We have just now\r\nreferred to Swediaur, etc., stating that up to 1500 all European writers\r\nlooked upon syphilis as spreading, pestilentially and contagiously,\r\nwithout coition. Three years earlier, the aldermen and town-council of\r\nAberdeen seem to have arrived at more just ideas of its laws of\r\npropagation, and to have distinctly suspected impure sexual intercourse\r\nas the mode of communication of the malady. This seems to be fully\r\nborne out by their ordering, “for the eschewing of the infirmitey,” that\r\n(to use the words of the edict) “all licht weman be chargit and ordanit\r\nto desist fra thar syne of venerie;” and we have the usual glowing and\r\nearnest threat of the application of the actual cautery, or “ane key of\r\nhet yrne (hot iron) to thair chekis,” in case of disobedience. The later\r\nAberdeen edicts of 1507, which we have already quoted at length, show,\r\nhowever, that the rulers of the burgh had been subsequently led to adopt\r\nthe erroneous idea of the leading authorities of the day, that the\r\ndisease might be transmitted also in the way of common contagions, and\r\neven, perhaps, by the medium of a third person.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4th Corollary._—The early notices that I have adduced of the\r\nappearance of syphilis in Scotland are curious as proofs of the rapidity\r\nwith which the disease travelled, at its first outbreak, over the\r\nkingdoms of Europe. The new malady was, as I have already stated, first\r\ndistinctly recognised during the period that Charles VIII. of France\r\noccupied the city of Naples, or rather immediately after he left that\r\nplace. The cases of the disease that had appeared previously were not,\r\nat least, anywhere in such numbers, or in such severity, as to excite\r\nany marked and decided degree of attention from physicians or from the\r\npublic. That Naples was the locality in which the contagion first burst\r\nforth so extensively and overtly as to be considered almost the source\r\nand cradle of the new epidemic; and further, that this happened at the\r\nprecise date of the visit of the French army, seems, as has been\r\nsuggested by various authors, to be shown by the very designations\r\nrespectively conferred at the time upon the new affection by the\r\nNeapolitans and French. For whilst, as already alluded to, the French,\r\nas is well known, designated it at its first commencement among them the\r\nNeapolitan disease, alleging it to have been communicated to them by the\r\ninhabitants of Naples, the Neapolitans, on the other hand, termed it the\r\nFrench disease, believing that it had been brought to them by the\r\nvictorious army of France. Now the date of Charles’s sojourn in Naples\r\nis well known. His army, in their march through Italy, arrived at Rome\r\non the 4th December 1494, and entered Naples on the 21st or 22d February\r\n1495; and after remaining three months, they vacated the city on the\r\n20th May. On the 24th of the same month the renowned Spanish general\r\nCordova landed in Sicily; on the 6th July the battle of Fuornovo was\r\nfought, and next day King Ferdinand returned to Naples; but the last\r\nremains of the French army did not reach France till the end of the\r\nfollowing year. The Aberdeen edict, however, was issued within less than\r\ntwo years after Charles commenced his march homeward. Or, we may state\r\nthe matter otherwise. Columbus arrived at Palos, in Andalusia, after his\r\nfirst voyage to the New World, on the 15th March 1493, having previously\r\nlanded at Lisbon on the 6th, and visited the Portuguese King at\r\nValparaiso: while Pinzen, the commander of the other remaining caravel\r\nof Columbus’ tiny fleet, was, about the same date, driven northward into\r\nthe French port of Bayonne. Possibly one focus or centre for the future\r\nspread and dissemination of syphilis was left in this French port by\r\nPinzen’s crew, if they brought the infection with them; but I have\r\nnowhere found any allusion to this question. Columbus reached Spain,\r\nfrom his second voyage, in April 1496. The edict of the Aberdeen\r\naldermen and council was passed on the 23d April 1497, or exactly four\r\nyears and thirty-eight days from the date of Columbus’ first return to\r\nSpain; while the famous ordinance of the Parisian authorities regarding\r\nsyphilis was issued on the 6th March 1497, only forty-eight days before\r\nthat of Aberdeen.[621]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the rapidity with which syphilis spread from the south\r\nand middle of Europe to this small and isolated kingdom of Scotland, it\r\nis necessary to remember that in the last years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and during the reign of James IV., the intercourse of this\r\ncountry with “France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Flanders was (to\r\nquote the words of the Scottish historian, Mr. Tytler) as regular and\r\nuninterrupted, not only in the more solemn way of embassies, but by\r\nheralds, envoys, and merchants, as that carried on with England.”[622]\r\nThere was in actual operation, also, at that very date, another medium\r\nby which such a disease was very likely to be carried from the Continent\r\nto our shores, and diffused among the population of the larger towns. In\r\nNovember 1495, Perkin Warbeck, under the title of Prince Richard, Duke\r\nof York, arrived in Scotland, and was received with regal honours by\r\nKing James, who bestowed upon him in marriage his cousin, the Lady\r\nCatherine Gordon. This pretended claimant to the English throne remained\r\nin Scotland till July 1497. He was preceded, accompanied, and followed\r\nto this country by gay and reckless “soldiers of fortune” from the\r\nContinent, Ireland, England, etc.—the men of all others most likely to\r\ntransmit and diffuse such a disease as syphilis. These adventurers\r\nappear to have been quartered by the Scottish King upon various towns.\r\nThus, the town-records of Aberdeen show that, as early as the 5th July\r\n1495,—some months before Warbeck himself arrived in Scotland,—a burgh\r\ntax was imposed “to the sustentacioun of aught Inglismen of the Duk of\r\nYorkis, direkit to the toune by our souerane lordis hiennes, and his\r\nletteris therapone.”—(_Spalding Club Extracts_, vol. i. p. 57.)\r\n\r\nThe speed, however, with which the disease thus travelled from the south\r\nof Europe to its western confines has been often employed as an argument\r\nto show that the contagion of syphilis was propagated at its first\r\nintroduction by laws different from those which now regulate its\r\ncommunication. In other words, it has been often alleged that the\r\ndisease was then spread from kingdom to kingdom, and from city to city,\r\nby epidemic influences and by general contagion, and not merely by the\r\nslower medium of impure sexual connection. We have just seen such a\r\ndoctrine so far belied by the sagacious regulations of the magistrates\r\nof Aberdeen; and when we look to the then existing state of Society,\r\nboth on the Continent and in our own country, to the loose manners and\r\nlicentious lives of these times, we shall probably find a sufficient\r\nsolution of the, at first sight, difficult problem of the rapid\r\ndissemination of the new malady. The morals of the general mass of the\r\npeople are ever found to be principally regulated by the example set\r\nbefore them by the aristocracy and clergy. At the date of the\r\nintroduction of syphilis into Europe, the notorious habits of the two\r\nlatter ruling bodies were assuredly such as to expedite greatly the\r\ndiffusion of the new scourge that had sprung up among them; and hence,\r\nat its first outbreak, we find the disease fixing itself upon several\r\nof the highest members of the continental courts, and of the church. The\r\nEmperor Charles V., and Pope Alexander VI., kings and cardinals, princes\r\nand bishops, peers and priests, are openly and publicly recorded among\r\nits victims by those who personally watched and described the first\r\nravages of syphilis. In fact the disease was then scarcely, or indeed\r\nnot at all, looked upon as conferring any degree of infamy.\r\n\r\nIn his tract on the malady,[623] published at Rome in the year 1500,\r\nPeter Pinctor mentions by name, and without any reticence, three of the\r\nmore illustrious patients whom he had treated for this new\r\ndisease—namely, the Prebendary Centez, the Cardinal of Segovia, and his\r\nHoliness the reigning Pope. Writers thought it no imputation on their\r\nown characters to publish an account of the disease as it occurred in\r\ntheir own persons. The physician Joseph Grunbeck of Burkchausen, in his\r\nessay “De Pestilentiali Scorra sive Mala de Frantzos” (1496), tells his\r\nreaders how he himself caught the disease from the atmosphere, when\r\nwalking in some fields near Augsburg. One of the earliest adherents and\r\nfiercest champions of the Reformation in Germany was Ulric Hütten, “the\r\npoet and valiant knight of the sixteenth century,” as Merle D’Aubigné\r\ndesignates him. In 1519, Hütten, though bred to arms, and not to physic,\r\npublished a treatise—_De Guiaci Medicina, etc., Morbo Gallico_. In this\r\ntreatise he details his own case and sufferings from the disease, how he\r\nhad been “utterly vexed with the sycknes,”—had been eleven times\r\nsalivated for it, and was at last cured by guiacum. This treatise,\r\nwritten, as the preface bears, by “that great clerke of Almayne, Ulrich\r\nHütten, Knycht,” was translated by Thomas Paynell, Chanon of Marten\r\nAbbey, and published in England in 1539. The disease was, in Hütten’s\r\nopinion, produced “throughe some unholsome blastes of the ayre.” His\r\npolemical antagonist, Erasmus, in his _Colloquy of Gamos and Agamos_,\r\ndenounced fiercely the character of this reforming and literary\r\nknight:—“Qualis eques (he exclaims) cui per Scabiem vix in sella sedere\r\nliceat!”\r\n\r\nIn order to show how swiftly a disease, propagated in the way syphilis\r\nis, might overrun the society of continental Europe towards the\r\nconclusion of the fifteenth century, it is only necessary to allude to\r\nthe dire and deplorable state of morals among those that ought to have\r\nset an example to the community—namely, the clergy of these days, as\r\npainted by the tongue and pens of their own writers. In an official\r\nsermon published by Martene (tom. ii. p. 1758), and preached in St.\r\nPeter’s at Rome by the Apostolic Auditor prior to the election of the\r\nPope in the year 1484, the corrupt morals and dishonesty of the whole\r\nchurch are denounced; and it is added that many do not merely commit,\r\nbut triumph even in, such sins as the subversion of chastity and other\r\nvirtues (de pudicitia, cæterisque virtutibus subversis, triumphantes).\r\nThe frightful licentiousness and obscene orgies of the reigning pontiff,\r\nand of his family and court, which speedily followed, formed a hideous\r\npractical commentary upon this text. A high Romanist who had the honour\r\nof refusing a cardinal’s hat, Claud D’Espence, Rector of the University\r\nof Paris, after exposing the infamy of the taxes of the apostolic\r\nchancery, with its list of “filthy and horrid iniquities” (fœdorum\r\ntamque horrendorum scelerum)—a license for any and all of which could\r\nbe purchased—adds, “You shall say we ingenuously confess that God\r\npermits this (Lutheran) prosecution to come upon his church on account\r\nof the sins of men, chiefly of priests and prelates, from whose sins the\r\nScriptures cry out that the sins of the people are derived.... Is it\r\nwonderful if the malady descend from the head to the members, from the\r\nsupreme Pontiff to others?[624] Where under heaven is there a greater\r\nlicense of all evils (infamia, impudecentia, etc.)?... Truly (adds\r\nD’Espence, and he had personally visited Rome), evils such and so great\r\nthat no one can believe but he who has seen, and no one can deny but he\r\nwho has not seen....\r\n\r\n  Vivere qui cupitis sancte, discedite Roma;\r\n  Omnia cum liceant, non licet esse bonum.”[625]\r\n\r\nPreviously another orthodox Roman ecclesiastic, Nicolas de Clemangis,\r\nArchdeacon of Bayeaux, had, in indignant, and, let us hope, in too\r\nsweeping terms, denounced the continental nunneries of these dark days\r\nas little better than brothels, and the taking of the veil as almost\r\nsynonymous with a profession of public prostitution:—“Nam quod aliud\r\nsunt puellarum monasteria nisi quædam non dicam Dei sanctuaria, sed\r\nVeneris execranda postibula. Sed lascivorum et impudicorum juvenum ad\r\nlibidines explendas receptacula ut idem hodie sit puellam velare, quod\r\net publice ad scortandum exponere.”[626] Truly in these pre-Reformation\r\ndays there was, as Cardinal Bellarmine confesses and laments, “almost no\r\nreligion left.”[627]\r\n\r\nAs far as regarded the predisposing habits and influence of the clergy,\r\nmatters were not better in Britain than on the Continent, when the\r\ndisease first reached this country. We have already seen Cardinal\r\nWolsey, the primate of England, publicly accused in Parliament of\r\nlabouring under the disease. We can, however, wonder the less at the\r\ndisease attacking such a high dignitary, when we recollect that,\r\naccording to some writers,[628] there was openly inscribed over the\r\ndoors of a palace belonging to this prelate—“_Domus Meretricium Domini\r\nCardinalis_.” Polydore Vergil, the sub-collector of the Pope’s revenues\r\nin England, speaks, perhaps in exaggerated terms, of the orgies in the\r\nresidence of Wolsey, by which he allured at first the young King Henry\r\nVIII. “Domi suae voluptatum omnium sacrarium fecit quo regem frequenter\r\nducebat. Sermones leporis plenos habebat, etc.”[629] The manners of the\r\ninferior dignitaries of the church offered only too close an imitation\r\nof those of its primate. The commissioners appointed by Henry VIII. to\r\nvisit the monasteries of England have recorded a sad, and (even setting\r\naside the influence of prejudice) probably only too true a picture of\r\nthe moral degeneracy of the great mass of the regular clergy of the\r\ntime. With some few cheering and honourable exceptions, they found the\r\noccupants of most of the monasteries following lives of degraded vice\r\nand licentiousness, instead of religious purity and exemplary rectitude.\r\nWhen the visitors received their commissions and instructions, they were\r\ndespatched into different parts of the kingdom, at the same time, that\r\nthe monks might have as little warning of their approach as possible.\r\nThey executed, says the historian Henry,[630] their commissions with\r\nzeal and diligence, and made some curious discoveries almost in every\r\nhouse, not much to the honour of its inhabitants. Accounts, he adds, of\r\ntheir proceedings were transmitted by the visitor to the vicar-general,\r\nand they contained sufficient materials to render the monasteries\r\ncompletely infamous,—for their gross, absurd superstition, their\r\nshameful impositions, their abandoned unnatural incontinency, etc. etc.\r\nSome of the old abbots and friars did not attempt to conceal their\r\namours, because they knew it was impossible. The holy father, the prior\r\nof Maiden Bradley, assured the visitors that he had only married six of\r\nhis sons and one of his daughters out of the goods of the priory as yet;\r\nbut that several more of his children were now growing or grown up, and\r\nwould soon be marriageable. He produced a dispensation from the Pope,\r\npermitting him to keep a mistress; and he asseverated that he took none\r\nbut young maidens to be his mistresses, the handsomest that he could\r\nprocure; and when he was disposed to change, he got them individually\r\nprovided with very good lay husbands.[631] “These be the men” (exclaimed\r\nSimon Fish, in one of his celebrated public sermons which he delivered\r\nat the period we speak of), “these be the men that corrupt the whole\r\ngeneration in your realm, that catch the pox of one woman, and bear it\r\nto another; that be burnt with one woman, and bear it to another.”[632]\r\n\r\nClerical morals and manners were not in a much healthier state on the\r\nScottish side of the Border. Towards the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nwe have not on record any such obscene scandal as was detailed in a\r\nprevious century in the _Chronicle of Lanercost_ regarding Priest John,\r\nwho is alleged to have publicly celebrated phallic orgies among the\r\nyoung inhabitants of his parish of Inverkeithing,[633] a town which was\r\ncertainly a place of no small note and importance in these early days.\r\nBut clerical morals were still confessedly in a sad state about the time\r\nthat syphilis first appeared in this part of the island. The _General\r\nSatyre_ of Scotland, written, as I have already stated, at the\r\ncommencement of the sixteenth century, stigmatises amongst other\r\nthings—\r\n\r\n “Sic pryd with prellatis, so few till preiche and pray,\r\n  Sic haunt of harlettis with thame, baythe nicht and day.”[634]\r\n\r\nQueen Mary would seem to have regarded the health of the high Roman\r\nchurch dignitary who baptized her son James VI. with considerable\r\nsuspicion, perhaps, however, only in as much as he was one of a class\r\nwith a very bad character in that respect. King James, in “A Premonition\r\nto all most mightie Monarchs, Kings, Free Princes, and States of\r\nChristendome,”[635] thus refers to it:—“For first, I am no apostate, as\r\nthe Cardinal (Bellarmine) would make me, not onely having ever been\r\nbrought up in that religion which I presently professe, but even my\r\nfather and grandfather on that side professing the same: and so cannot\r\nbe properly an Heratike, by there own doctrine, since I never was of\r\ntheir church; and as for the Queene my mother of worthy memorie,\r\nalthough she continued in that religion wherein she was nourished, yet\r\nshe was so farre from being superstitious or Jesuited therein, that at\r\nmy Baptisme (although I was baptized by a Popish Archbishop) she sent\r\nhim word to forbeare to use the spettle in my baptisme; which was\r\nobeyed, being indeed a filthy, and an apish trick, rather in scorne than\r\nin imitation of Christ; and her owne very words were, that ‘She would\r\nnot have a pokie priest to spet in her child’s mouth.’”\r\n\r\nOf the dissolute lives of the Scotch, like the other clergy of these\r\ntimes, we may find ample proof in some of the contemporaneous medical\r\nworks. We know, for example, from an old medical author, something of\r\nthe inner life of the identical “pockie priest” who baptized James VI.\r\nIn 1552, Dr. Jerome Cardan, the famous Italian physician, came from\r\nMilan to Edinburgh to visit professionally the high ecclesiastic in\r\nquestion—namely, John Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews—who was\r\nsuffering under severe and recurrent attacks of asthma. He travelled\r\nwith all possible expedition, and in these “good olden times” the part\r\nof his journey from London to Edinburgh only took twenty-three days.\r\nCardan has left us in his works a copy of the lengthy and very minute\r\nmedical and hygienic directions which he drew up for the behoof of the\r\narchbishop. Besides giving him innumerable medical prescriptions, he\r\nlays down for him excellent rules regarding his food, drink, exercise,\r\nsleep, etc., down to the materials of which his bed and his pillows\r\nshould be composed. He adds for the Archbishop’s guidance the following\r\nrule—“De Venere. Certe non est bona, neque utilis: ubi tamen contingat\r\nnecessitas, debet uti ea inter duos somnos, secilicet post mediam\r\nnoctem, et melius est exercere eam ter in sex diebus pro exemplo, ita ut\r\nsingulis duobus diebus semel, quam bis in una die, etiam quod staret per\r\ndecem dies.”[636]\r\n\r\nThe quiet and matter-of-course style in which these rules are laid down\r\nand published proves only too strongly the dissolute life of some of the\r\nhighest clergy in our land; and in order to appreciate the full force of\r\nthis observation, it is necessary to remember that Cardan’s patient was\r\nthe living head of the Scottish Roman Catholic church of that day—the\r\nPrimate and Metropolitan of Scotland.[637] Perhaps still more\r\nunequivocal evidence of the scandalous profligacy of the Scottish clergy\r\nof these times is to be found in their own statutes, and in the legal\r\ndocuments of the country.\r\n\r\nIn a provincial council of the Scottish clergy, held at Edinburgh in\r\n1549, the circumstance that there had come very grave scandals to the\r\nchurch from the incontinence of ecclesiastics (ex clericorum\r\nincontinentia, gravissima ecclesiæ scandala esse exorta) was taken into\r\nconsideration, and the edict of the Council of Basle “De Concubinariis”\r\nput in force. Another edict was passed by this Edinburgh synod\r\n“exhorting” both the prelates and inferior clergy not to keep their own\r\nillegitimate children in their company, prohibiting their promotion of\r\nthem in their churches, and forbidding the endowment of them with\r\nbaronies out of the church’s goods.[638] But perhaps the dissolute and\r\ndepraved state of the Romish church in Scotland is more clearly\r\nphotographed in a subsequent edict, which they passed in a large synod\r\nheld at Edinburgh in 1558-9. This edict does not “exhort” against\r\nincontinence on the part of the priests, but it simply and shamelessly\r\nrestricts, and lays down a legal limit to, the amount of property which\r\nthey might unsacrilegiously abstract and purloin from the pious\r\nendowments belonging to the Church (de patrimonio Christi) for the\r\nmarriage portions of the bastard daughters of their concubines; the\r\nsynod enacting that neither prelates nor any other ecclesiastics should\r\ndirectly or indirectly give with their illegitimate daughters, in\r\nmarriage to barons or other landowners, any greater sum than one hundred\r\npounds yearly of the Church’s patrimony.[639]\r\n\r\nThe legitimation of bastard children was necessary before they could\r\ninherit or dispose of property, and exercise other legal rights. The\r\nPrivy Seal Records of Scotland for the earlier years of the sixteenth\r\ncentury have been preserved, and are full of entries of legitimation of\r\nthe bastard children of Scottish prelates and priests. Lord Hailes gives\r\nus some sad information regarding the numbers of the illegitimate\r\nchildren of the Scottish bishops, abbots, and monks of these\r\ntimes.[640] Among others, he states that David Bethune, the immediate\r\npredecessor of Hamilton in the archbishopric of St. Andrews and primacy\r\nof Scotland, had three bastards legitimised in one day; and afterwards,\r\nPatrick Hepburn, Bishop of Moray, had seven—five sons and two\r\ndaughters—all acknowledged in one day. John Leslie, Bishop of Ross,\r\nhimself the illegitimate son of an official in the diocese of\r\nMoray—viz. of Gavin Leslie, parson of Kingusie, was the father of\r\nseveral illegitimate children; and it is, says the learned author of the\r\n_Book of Bon Accord_, sufficiently amusing to find his name among those\r\nof the other members of the chapter of Aberdeen who solemnly counselled\r\ntheir ordinary to “caus the lay kirkmen within their diocie to reforme\r\nthameselfes in all thair slanderous maner of lyving, and to remove thair\r\n_oppin_ concubins.”[641]\r\n\r\nConcubinage among the lower clergy, provided it was not slanderously\r\nopen and avowed, would almost seem to have been overlooked and connived\r\nat by the church dignitaries of those degenerate times.[642]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the old chapel of St. Ninian, at Leith, still exist in\r\nthe vicinity of Edinburgh. The spire of the church is, even at the\r\npresent day, a conspicuous object above the second harbour bridge,\r\nthough the chapel itself and its prebendary are degraded to common\r\ndwellings. This chapel was founded by Robert Bellenden, Abbot of\r\nHolyrood, and endowed for two chaplains. In the charter of foundation,\r\nwhich is dated 1493 (four years before syphilis broke out in Edinburgh),\r\nit is—in accordance with a common formula in these deeds—ordained that\r\nif “either of the aforesaid chaplains keep a lass or concubine, in an\r\nopen and notorious manner, he shall be degraded; which seems,” as the\r\nhistorian Maitland pertly observes, “to imply this, that they or either\r\nof them might keep a miss or misses provided it were not publickly\r\nknown.”[643]\r\n\r\nNor was poverty on the part of a portion of the priesthood apparently\r\nany great obstacle to such, as well as to less sinful indulgences. For,\r\naccording to the testimony of honest George Marjoribanks (see his\r\n_Annals of Scotland_, p. 5), “In the yeir of God 1533 Sir Walter Cowpur,\r\nChaiplaine in Edinburgh, gate a pynte of vyne, a laiffe of 36 unce\r\nvaight, a pock of aite-meill, a pynte of aill, a schiepe-hede, ane penny\r\ncandell, and a faire woman for ane xviii^d grote.”\r\n\r\nVery shortly before the commencement of syphilis, the dissolute manners\r\nof the English clergy, especially of the regulars, created such noise\r\nand commotion among the laity, that Pope Innocent VIII. sent in 1490 (a\r\nfew years before the actual appearance of the disease) to Archbishop\r\nMerton, authorising him to admonish his abbots and priors that “by their\r\nlewd and dissolute lives they brought ruin upon their own souls, and set\r\na bad example to others.” In obedience to this bull, the Primate sent\r\nmonitory letters to the superiors of all convents and religious houses\r\nin his province, admonishing and commanding them, by the authority he\r\nhad received from the Pope, to reform themselves and their subjects from\r\ncertain vices, of which they were said to be guilty. The monitory letter\r\nthat was sent on this occasion to the Abbot of St. Alban’s is published\r\nin Wilkins’s _Concilia_, vol. iii. p. 632. If that Abbot and his monks\r\nwere stained with all the odious vices of which the Primate openly\r\naccuses them in this letter, they stood much in need of reformation.\r\nSome of these vices, says Dr. Henry, were so detestable that they cannot\r\nso much as be named in history. “You are infamous,” writes the\r\nArchbishop to the Abbot, for “simony, usury, and squandering away the\r\npossessions of your monastery, besides other enormous crimes.” One of\r\nthese crimes was, that the Abbot had turned all the modest women out of\r\nthe two nunneries of Pray and Sapwell (over which he pretended to have a\r\njurisdiction), and filled them with prostitutes; that these nunneries\r\nwere esteemed no better than brothels, and that he and his monks\r\npublicly frequented them as such. His Grace seems to have been well and\r\naccurately informed, for he even names some of these infamous women and\r\ntheir gallants. The monks, too, were at least as profligate as their\r\nAbbot, for they also kept their concubines both within and without the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nWhen such was the scandalous life led by some of the clergy, we cannot\r\nwonder that, before the introduction of syphilis, Rabelais (himself at\r\none time a monk) should apply to the gonorrhœal disease the very\r\nsignificant term of “rhume ecclesiastique;” or that, after the\r\nappearance of syphilis, this latter and greater malady should have\r\nspread speedily among all ranks, down from the clergy to the laity, and\r\nfrom the king to the churl, and should have become diffused by such\r\nstealthy but rapid steps over the countries of Europe, as to have at\r\nfirst been mistaken for a malady spreading itself, not by impure\r\nintercourse, but by general epidemic influences. And when we advert to\r\nthe existing state of society in that age, and couple it with such\r\nnotices as we have found in the Aberdeen records, we may surely (in\r\ndespite of all that has been written to the contrary, both in ancient\r\nand modern times) reasonably doubt whether the laws regulating the\r\npropagation of syphilis in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were in\r\nany degree different from what we know them to be in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The Aberdeen edict shows that three hundred and sixty odd years\r\nago, or in 1497, the common mode of infection of the disease was\r\nprecisely the same as all acknowledge it to be at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] From the _Edinburgh Med. and Surg.

At p. 63 of the\r\n  Appendix to Paris, the institution of one hospital at St.\r\n  Alban’s is referred to; but neither here nor elsewhere in his\r\n  work can I find any allusion whatever to the existing number of\r\n  leper hospitals in England, or in Christendom in general.\r\n\r\n  [6] Velley, Villaret et Garnier, _Histoire de France_, tom. ii.\r\n  (ed. of 1770), p. 291.\r\n\r\n  [7] Velley, etc., _Histoire_, ii. p. 292.\r\n\r\n  [8] Mezeray, _Histoire de France_, tom. ii. 1645, p. 168. “Il\r\n  n’y avoit n’y ville, n’y bourgade, qui ne fust obligée de bâtir\r\n  un hospital pour les (Lepres) retirer.”\r\n\r\n  [9] _Antiquitates Italicæ Medii Aevi_, tom. iii. p. 53. “In\r\n  Italia vix ulla erat civitas quæ non aliquem locum, Leprosis\r\n  destinatum, haberet.”\r\n\r\n  [10] _Acta Sanctorum a Patribus Soc.

(See a table in\r\n  Taylor’s _Index Monasticus_, p. xxv.) We have no collection of\r\n  data on which to form any similar general calculation for\r\n  Scotland. In Chalmers _Caledonia_ (vol. ii. p. 347) nine\r\n  hospitals are stated to have existed in the county of Berwick\r\n  alone. In the Scottish Parliament of 1424, an Act was passed\r\n  regarding the hospitals “uphaldane to pure folks and seik”\r\n  (poor people and sick) throughout the kingdom, and empowering\r\n  the chancellor and bishops to “reduce and reforme tham to the\r\n  effec of thair first fundacione” (see Thomson’s edition of the\r\n  _Scotch Acts of Parliament_, vol. ii. p. 7). Some of the\r\n  hospitals in these early times were founded for the reception\r\n  of the sick and infirm, others for lepers, many for the poor\r\n  and aged, and a considerable number for the gratuitous\r\n  entertainment of pilgrims and travellers. Among the whole long\r\n  English list I have only found four endowed as lunatic asylums.\r\n  A few were instituted for purposes which sound strangely in the\r\n  ears of the present generation. Thus the hospital of Flixton,\r\n  or Carman’s Spittle, in the parish of Folketon, Yorkshire, was\r\n  founded in the time of King Athelstane, to preserve travellers\r\n  from being devoured by the wolves and other voracious and\r\n  forest beasts of the districts (“pro conservatione populi inde\r\n  transeuntis, ne populus ille per lupos et alias bestias voraces\r\n  et sylvestres, inibi existentes, devoretur”).

(Leipsic, edit. of\r\n  1735).\r\n\r\n  [150] The disease is still designated in different parts of\r\n  Asia and Africa by the same terms, more or less slightly\r\n  changed. In his Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria (p. 332),\r\n  Browne speaks of elephantiasis under the local designation of\r\n  _dzudham_; Niebuhr says it is still named in Arabia and Persia\r\n  _dsjuddam_ and _Madsjuddam_. (Pinkerton’s _Collection of\r\n  Voyages and Travels_, vol. x. p. 170.) In Morocco it is called\r\n  at the present day _Jeddem_ and _Murd Jeddem_. (Jackson’s\r\n  _Account of the Empire of Morocco_.)\r\n\r\n  [151] The remark in the text applies to nearly all the numerous\r\n  Latin versions made from the Arabic. It is proper, however, to\r\n  add, that the translator of the works of Haly Abbas has so far\r\n  avoided the error alluded to, by translating the Juzam of his\r\n  author by elephanta. With this single exception, the error\r\n  might otherwise, I believe, be called universal.\r\n\r\n  [152] The Arabians (_i.e._ the Latin translators from the\r\n  Arabians), and their expositors, as was long ago remarked by\r\n  Eustachius Rudius, and as has been often repeated since, “per\r\n  Lepram nil aliud intelligunt præter Elephantiasim.”—_De\r\n  Affectibus Externarum Corporis Humani Partium_, Venet. 1606, p.\r\n  24.\r\n\r\n  [153] See Bostock’s _History of Medicine_ (New York edition of\r\n  1836), pp. 43 and 47, or chapters vi. and vii.\r\n\r\n  [154] This appropriation of the single term “lepra” for the\r\n  designation of Greek elephantiasis is still adhered to by some\r\n  modern authors. Thus Plenck, in his celebrated _Nosology of\r\n  Cutaneous Diseases_, denominates (after the example of the\r\n  translators from the Arabic) the Barbadoes leg “Elephantiasis,”\r\n  and applies to the Greek elephantiasis the simple term “Lepra.”\r\n  Hence he defines lepra to be “that disease in which the skin,\r\n  particularly of the face, becomes rugose and irregular\r\n  (_aspera_), and is deformed with large reddish-livid and\r\n  chinked tubercles (_rimosis tuberibus_), along with\r\n  insensibility of the extremities, and the voice raucous and\r\n  nasal.”—_Doctrina de Morbis Cutaneis, quâ hi morbi in suas\r\n  Classes, Genera, et Species rediguntur_ (1783), p. 67.

This\r\n  division, which some of them freely allow to be founded more in\r\n  theory than in nature, seems to have been first proposed by\r\n  Constantinus Africanus. (_De Morborum Cognitione_, chap. 17.)\r\n  Like the fanciful fourfold subdivision of other diseases, it\r\n  was made in correspondence with the Hippocratic and Galenic\r\n  doctrine of the four humours. Theodoric, Arnald, Gilbert, and\r\n  the other authors who, in accordance with the pathological\r\n  creeds of the time, were led to adopt it, attribute each\r\n  particular variety to the operation and predominance of a\r\n  particular humour. John of Gaddesden has attempted, in his\r\n  _Rosa Anglica_, to dress up different medical doctrines in rude\r\n  Latin hexameters, and amongst others, he announces the doctrine\r\n  in question in the five following lines:—\r\n\r\n    Sub specie tetrâ deturpat corpora LEPRA;\r\n    TIRIA prima datur, de _flegmate_ quae generatur;\r\n    Turpe pilos pascens ALOPICUS, _sanguine_ nascens;\r\n    Fitque LEONINA, _colera_, fervente canina;\r\n    De _Mel_ _(Melancholia)_ fit tristis ELEFANTIA, tristior istis.\r\n\r\n  [174] The _History of Physick_, 5th edit. 1758, vol. ii. p. 263.\r\n\r\n  [175] Freind, p. 262.\r\n\r\n  [176] Sprengel, vol. ii. p. 448.\r\n\r\n  [177] _Bernhardi Gordonii Opera Medica_, Lugd. 1542, pp. 48 and\r\n  49.\r\n\r\n  [178] _Ib._ p. 54.\r\n\r\n  [179] See Freind, Sprengel, Eloy, etc.\r\n\r\n  [180] In the _Biographie Universelle, ancienne et moderne_,\r\n  Paris, 1813, tom. viii. p. 293, a third Pope, Innocent VI., is\r\n  added to this list.\r\n\r\n  [181] _Chirurgiae Libri Septem_, Lugd. 1572, p. 307, _sqq._\r\n\r\n  [182] _Gilberti Anglici Compendium Medicinae, tam morborum\r\n  universalium quam particularium, non solum medicis sed et\r\n  chyrurgicis utilissimum._ Vienna, 1510.\r\n\r\n  [183] Eloy’s _Dictionnaire Historique de Medecine, Ancienne et\r\n  Moderne_, 1778, tome ii. p. 349.

Speaking of the Greek elephantiasis, or elephantiasis\r\n  legitima of Sauvages, they observe “on ne trouvoit nulle part,\r\n  pas même dans Arétée de Cappadoce, une exposition plus claire\r\n  que celle qui a été donnée par Gilbert, Medecin Anglois du\r\n  seizieme (?) siecle.”\r\n\r\n  [188] Sprengel’s _Histoire de la Medecine_ (Jourdain’s\r\n  translation).

The editor, Schopf, appends to\r\n  this passage a rubric, stating the above sound counsel as\r\n  “Decretum Joannis Angli de Leprosis.”\r\n\r\n  [194] Pitt places him about 1360: Eloy, vol. ii. p. 354;\r\n  Freind, vol. ii. p. 293.\r\n\r\n  [195] From the old translation of Glanville’s work, _De\r\n  Proprietatibus Rerum_, by John Trevisa, Vicar of Barkley.

The poem has been published, without the name of the\r\n  author, in Godfray’s and most other later editions of Chaucer’s\r\n  Works.\r\n\r\n  [199] This complication was not so common as to be regarded as\r\n  a constant and pathognomonic sign of Greek elephantiasis, but\r\n  it is noted as an important and frequent one, by various\r\n  authors, both ancient and modern. Hally-Abbas tells us, in our\r\n  diagnosis of a case of the disease, to be particular in\r\n  examining “album oculorum ne forte turbatum est” (Lib. i. cap.\r\n  xxiv.); Rhazes attributes great value as a diagnostic mark of\r\n  his Juddam or elephantiasis to the “conturbatio albedinis\r\n  oculorum” (Lib. v. cap. cxx.); Avicenna, among his incipient\r\n  signs, states “et apparet in oculis obfuscatio ad rubedinem\r\n  declivis” (Lib. iv. Fen. iii. Fr. 3, cap. ii.) Not to multiply\r\n  examples, I may merely mention that Theodoric, in the\r\n  thirteenth century, places early among his list of signs\r\n  “oculorum in albedine lividitas” (Lib. iii. cap. lv.); see also\r\n  Lanfranc (Doct. i. Tr. iii. c. 7, albedo oculorum obfuscator);\r\n  Arnald of Villeneuve (Brev. ii. c. 46, multum rubeae); Gilbert\r\n  (Lib. viii. oculi circulos habent rubros), etc. Dr. Heberden,\r\n  in his account of the tubercular leprosy in Madeira, states, in\r\n  regard to a case, “that the confirmed elephantiasis was\r\n  attended with _livid_ and scirrhous tubercles, which had\r\n  overspread the face and limbs; the whole body was emaciated;\r\n  the eyebrows inflated; the hair of the eyebrows fallen off\r\n  entirely; the bones of the nose depressed; the _alae nasi_\r\n  tumefied, as likewise the lobes of the ears; _with a suffusion\r\n  in both eyes_, which had almost deprived the patient of sight,”\r\n  etc.—_Medical Transactions of the College of Physicians_, vol.\r\n  i. p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [200] I give the term “livid” as synonymous with the old Scotch\r\n  term “haw,” under the idea that it expresses in all\r\n  probability, as nearly as possible, the meaning of the author.\r\n  The Scottish writer Gawin Douglas renders the Latin adjectives\r\n  “caeruleus” and “glaucus,” by the adjective “haw,” in his\r\n  celebrated translation of “The xiii. bukes of Eneados of the\r\n  famose poet, Virgill, out of Latyne verses, into Scottish\r\n  meter.” For the occasional livid colour of the lumps or\r\n  tubercles in the face, see the extract in the preceding note\r\n  from Dr. Heberden, and the modern descriptions quoted in a\r\n  previous page from Bateman and Schedel.\r\n\r\n  [201] Since writing the above, I have met with the following\r\n  interesting notice in the still earlier voyage of Martin to St.\r\n  Kilda, the most westerly island of the Hebrides. Describing his\r\n  visit to St. Kilda, in 1697, he states, “Some thirteen years\r\n  ago, the Leprosy broke amongst the inhabitants, and some of\r\n  their numbers died of it. There are two families at present\r\n  labouring under the disease. The symptoms of it are, their feet\r\n  begin to fail; their appetite declining; their faces becoming\r\n  too red, and breaking out in pimples; a hoarseness, and their\r\n  hair falling off from their heads; the crown (?) of it\r\n  exulcerates and blisters; and, lastly, their beards grow\r\n  thinner than ordinary.”—_Voyage to St. Kilda_ (first published\r\n  in 1698), p. 40 of edition of 1749.\r\n\r\n  [202] _MS. Medical Annotations_, vol. iii. p. 226.\r\n\r\n  [203] “The Moderator proposed to the session, that, considering\r\n  that a Gracious Providence had not only delivered the Island\r\n  and country from the burden and necessity of maintaining and\r\n  otherwise providing for the poor Lepers, formerly in this\r\n  Island, but had also put a stop to the spreading of that\r\n  unclean and infectious disease, so that there is no appearance\r\n  of the symptoms thereof in any person now in this place, the\r\n  Session should therefore ordain a day to be set apart for\r\n  solemn thanksgiving for so great a deliverance throughout this\r\n  ministry excepting Fowla, which we can have no access to\r\n  probably to inform. The Session having heard the Moderator’s\r\n  proposal, were cordially satisfied therewith, and did agree\r\n  unanimously that a day be set apart for solemn thanksgiving on\r\n  the above account throughout the bounds of the ministry,\r\n  excepting Fowla, as above said.” (Extracts from the MS. Session\r\n  Register of Walls, under date of 17th March 1742.) The 19th May\r\n  1742 was held as the day of thanksgiving, as appears from a\r\n  subsequent entry.\r\n\r\n  [204] _Færoæ et Færoa Reserata_ (London, 1659), pp. 310, 311.\r\n\r\n  [205] Mackenzie’s _Travels in Iceland during the summer of the\r\n  year 1810_; or _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_, vol.\r\n  viii. pp. 202, 203.\r\n\r\n  [206] Von Troil’s _Letters on Iceland_, p. 123; Barrow’s _Visit\r\n  to Iceland in the summer of 1834_, pp. 289 and 294.\r\n\r\n  [207] Pontoppidan’s _Natural History of Norway_, containing an\r\n  account of its Climate, etc. etc. (London translation, 1755),\r\n  pp. 261, 262.\r\n\r\n  [208] See Wellhaven’s account, extracted from the _Transactions\r\n  of the Stockholm Society_, vol. iii. pp. 188-200, into\r\n  Hunefeld’s “Essay on Radesyge,” pp. 38-56.\r\n\r\n  [209] See pp. 110-117 of the excerpta in Hensler’s learned\r\n  work, _Vom Abenländischen Aufsatze im Mittelalter_.

(See Olassen’s\r\n  _Islansk Urtagaard Bok_, p. 172; and Back, in Von Troil’s\r\n  _Letters on Iceland_, p. 324.) Munch and Hunefeld suggest, with\r\n  no great probability, that it might have been carried to the\r\n  north by the expeditions which, during the ninth and tenth\r\n  centuries, were made upon the Norman coast by Rolf and others.\r\n  (See Hunefeld’s _Radesyge oder das Scandinavische Syphiloid_,\r\n  p. 57.)\r\n\r\n  [211] I have already referred to Bartholin in relation to its\r\n  former prevalence in the Faroe Isles and Iceland. Writing in\r\n  1672, he states that in these parts leprosy “_fuisse olim\r\n  familiarem_” (_de morbis Biblicis in Mis. Med._ p. 41). Jonas,\r\n  Pastor of Hitterdale in Iceland, wrote in 1662 to the\r\n  celebrated Sir Thomas Browne, “Nullus _elephantiasi_ vel\r\n  abominabilior vel pestilentior hic existimatur, et tamen\r\n  postremo hoc seculo pavendus se diffundit.” (Wilkin’s edition\r\n  of Sir Thomas Browne’s Works, including his _Life and\r\n  Correspondence_, vol. iv. p. 261.)\r\n\r\n  [212] The date of admission to the church of one of the priors\r\n  of the hospital.\r\n\r\n  [213] _Synopsis of Cutaneous Diseases_, p. 419.\r\n\r\n  [214] Murray’s Edition of the _Acts of the Parliament of\r\n  Scotland_, vol. ii. p. 18.

Session Records of Walls.\r\n\r\n  [215] In describing the duties of the examiner, De Chauliac\r\n  observes, “In primis invocando Dei auxilium debet eos\r\n  comfortare, quòd ista passio est salvatio animae et quod non\r\n  dubitent dicere veritatem, quia si reperientur Leprosi,\r\n  purgatorium animae esset; et si mundus habet eos odio, non\r\n  tamen Deus, cum Lazarum Leprosum plus dilexit quam alios.

Shortly\r\n  afterwards Froissart states, “And thus, soone after thys noble\r\n  Robert de Brouse, Kyng of Scotland, trespassed out of thys\r\n  incertayne worlde, and his hart was taken owte of his body and\r\n  embawmed, and honourably he was entred in the Abbey of\r\n  Donfremlyne.” When the grave of the Bruce was opened at\r\n  Dunfermline in 1818, the anatomical appearances of the skeleton\r\n  showed that the king’s will had been so far obeyed, the bones\r\n  of the chest being found divided in such a way as to have\r\n  allowed the removal of the heart. This piece of dissection\r\n  seems, at the time at which it was made, to have drawn down the\r\n  dreaded vengeance of the Vatican upon Randolph, Earl of Moray,\r\n  the king’s nephew, and apparently the operator in this case, in\r\n  such a way as forms a strange and startling contrast with the\r\n  medical usages observed towards the dead at the present day. I\r\n  quote the account, as a curious point in the march of\r\n  necroscopic anatomy, from the Appendix to the _Chronicon de\r\n  Lanercost_ (p. 428)—“It appears that, by a constitution of\r\n  Pope Boniface, the mutilation of a dead body subjected those by\r\n  whom it was mutilated to heavy ecclesiastical censures. To free\r\n  himself from these censures, Randolph, two years after the\r\n  death of King Robert, presented a petition to the Pope, setting\r\n  forth that the deceased king had intended to undertake a\r\n  crusade against the Saracens, but was prevented by death, and\r\n  that in his last will he expressly ordered his heart to be\r\n  taken out of his body and carried in such an expedition, which\r\n  was done by James de Douglas, who conveyed it into Spain. The\r\n  Bishop of Moray was employed to obtain from the Pope a\r\n  remission for the crime, dated 8th before the Ides of August,\r\n  in the fifteenth year of Pope John’s pontificate.” Raynald, in\r\n  his _Annal. Ecclest._, gives the extract A.D. 1329. § 81.\r\n\r\n  [277] _Compendium Medicinae_ (Lugd. 1510), p. 336.\r\n\r\n  [278] See the Maitland Club _Burgh Records of Glasgow_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n  [279] See _Memorabilia of Glasgow_, p. 55.\r\n\r\n  [280] _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_, xxvi. p. 15,\r\n  _seqq._\r\n\r\n  [281] _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_, xxiv. p. 286.\r\n\r\n  [282] Debes’ _Færoæ et Færoa Reserata_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [283] _Dictionnaire des Sc.

Hooker’s _Iceland_, vol. i. p. 189\r\n  (ascribes it to former use of woollen garments). Taylor’s\r\n  _Index Monasticus_, p. xii.

Wilkin’s _Leges\r\n  Anglo-Saxonicae Ecclesiasticae et Civiles_, p. 94. Turner’s\r\n  _History of the Anglo-Saxons_, vol. ii. p. 72.\r\n\r\n  [289] Hollinshed mentions the “multitude of _chimnies_ latelie\r\n  erected” as one of the “three things marvellouslie altered in\r\n  England” about the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n  (_Chronicles of England_, etc. edit. of 1807, vol. i. p. 317;\r\n  and Strutt’s _Horda Angel-Cynnan_, 1774, vol. i. p. 104.) When\r\n  we consider this we shall scarcely wonder that the smoke of\r\n  coals was formerly looked upon as a noted cause of disease, and\r\n  was at one time actually prohibited in London and Southwark.\r\n  (Stow’s _Survey of London_, p. 925. Evelyn’s _Fumifugium_,\r\n  1661. Macpherson’s _Annals of Commerce_, vol. i. p. 474.) In\r\n  1307 fires were ordered not to be lighted near the Tower\r\n  because the Queen was going to reside there. (Macpherson, _ut\r\n  supra_, see the edict in Rymer’s _Foedera_, vol. ii. p. 1057.)\r\n\r\n  [290] The last Archbishop of Glasgow (says Arnott) put on a\r\n  clean shirt once a week.—_History of Edinburgh_, p. 259.\r\n\r\n  [291] Straw was first used for the king’s bed in 1242, in the\r\n  reign of Henry III., whose court was considered the most polite\r\n  in Europe. (Dr. Henry’s _History of Great Britain_, vol. iii.\r\n  p. 507.) Some estates in England were held by the tenure of the\r\n  proprietors finding clean straw for the king’s bed, and litter\r\n  for his chamber. (Henry, _ut supra_; Camden’s _Britannia_, vol.\r\n  i. p. 311; _Index Monasticus_, p. 12.) In the charter granted\r\n  by Robert the Bruce to the Burgh of Ayr, the providing of this\r\n  latter item for him and his successors, for three days and\r\n  nights, whenever they visited the town, is specially entered in\r\n  the reddenda—“Et inveniendo nobis et heredibus nostris per\r\n  vices in adventibus nostris et heredum nostrorum apud Are per\r\n  tres dies et noctes _literium_ pro aulâ nostrâ.” (_Records of\r\n  Prestwick_, p. 128.) The office of rush-strewer was continued\r\n  till a late period on the list of the royal household (Craik\r\n  and Macfarlane’s _History of England_, vol. i. p. 644.)\r\n\r\n  [292] _Chronicles_, vol. i. p. 317.\r\n\r\n  [293] Many of the older medical authors lay down various and\r\n  most contradictory lists of articles of food as capable of\r\n  producing leprosy—some accusing too great quantities of animal\r\n  diet—others blaming too much vegetable diet as the cause,\r\n  while a third class, as Theodoric, impugn too free a use of\r\n  either or both (nimium usum carnis vaccinae, buballinae,\r\n  lentium et omnium leguminum. Theodoric, c. 55). Some authors\r\n  state the most strange doctrines on this point. Thus Bernhard\r\n  Gordon gravely states, that to partake of fish and milk in the\r\n  same meal does induce leprosy (comedere lac et pisces in eadem\r\n  mensa inducit Lepram. _Lilium Medicinae_, p. 48). The same idea\r\n  is repeated from Avicenna down to our countryman Gilbert, and\r\n  it is probably not unworthy of being remarked that the same\r\n  prejudice in regard to the influence of a mixed fish and milk\r\n  diet prevails, or prevailed till of late, in such opposite\r\n  points as Madeira and Hindostan.—(Heberden’s paper on\r\n  “Elephantiasis in Madeira,” p. 29; Walker, in _Calcutta Medical\r\n  and Physical Transactions_, vol. i. p. 4 of his “Account of the\r\n  Medical Opinions of the Hindus on Leprosy.” See also Sir\r\n  William Jones’ Works, vol. i. p. 556.)\r\n\r\n  [294] _History and Chronicles_, vol. i. p. lx.\r\n\r\n  [295] Marsden’s _History of Sumatra_, containing an account of\r\n  the Government, Laws, etc., pp. 151 and 201.\r\n\r\n  [296] See references formerly given to the works of Mackenzie,\r\n  Olafsen, Troil, Barrow, Henderson, Hooker, etc.\r\n\r\n  [297] Some scattered records of the leper hospital at Hamel en\r\n  Aarde by Messrs. Halbeck and Leitner, are to be found in the\r\n  _Periodical Accounts relating to the Missions of the Church_,\r\n  vol. ix. p. 345, 482, etc., as kindly pointed out to me by Dr.\r\n  William Brown. In 1824 the hospital contained 110 lepers.\r\n\r\n  [298] See Heberden, Adams, and Heineken’s papers, already\r\n  referred to.\r\n\r\n  [299] Hoest’s _Reise nach Marokos_, p. 248, calls the disease\r\n  Sghidam (Juddam). Lempriere’s Tour from Gibraltar to Tangier,\r\n  Morocco, etc., in 1789, in Pinkerton’s _Collection_, vol. xv.\r\n  p. 689, describes the disease as true leprosy. Jackson’s\r\n  _Account of the Empire of Morocco_ (1801), gives an account of\r\n  the leper hospital or village near Morocco.\r\n\r\n  [300] Niebuhr states that three different varieties of leprosy\r\n  are known in Arabia in modern times—viz. the Bohak, Barras,\r\n  and Juddam. “There is (he states) a quarter in Bagdad\r\n  surrounded with walls, and full of barracks, to which lepers\r\n  are carried by force, if they retire not thither voluntarily.\r\n  They come out every Friday to ask for alms.”—(Pinkerton’s\r\n  _Collection of Voyages_, vol. xviii. p. 170.)\r\n\r\n  [301] Dejean in Hensler’s _Abendländischen Aufsatze_, p. 240.\r\n\r\n  [302] Schilling, _De Lepra_, p. 20.

The hospital consisted of a number of\r\n  cottages, and the ground on which it stood was “surrounded by a\r\n  high wall, and had only one gate, and that always carefully\r\n  guarded.”\r\n\r\n  [310] My friend, Dr. Cheyne, lately of San Luis, informs me\r\n  that the hospital of San Lazaro, in the city of Mexico, is set\r\n  aside for the reception of cases of tubercular leprosy.\r\n\r\n  [311] As in Ceylon (Marshall’s _Medical Topography of Ceylon_,\r\n  p. 43); Mauritius (Kinnis in _Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal_,\r\n  vol. xxii. p. 286); Madagascar (_Narrative of Madagascar\r\n  Mission_, pp. 208 and 191).

Howard, in his _Account of the principal European\r\n  Lazarettoes_, mentions, p. 40, the leper hospital in Scio.\r\n  Hennen, in his _Medical Topography of the Mediterranean_,\r\n  states that elephantiasis is endemic in one small village in\r\n  Cephalonia, p. 275. Savary seems to have met with several cases\r\n  in the islands of the Archipelago (_Letters on Greece_, 1788,\r\n  p. 110).\r\n\r\n  [315] It is but proper to add that the tubercular leprosy is\r\n  looked upon by some pathologists as a disease not originally\r\n  endemic in any part of the New World, and that it was first\r\n  imported into and spread through the West Indies, etc., by\r\n  subjects brought from Africa. Hillary professes himself certain\r\n  upon this point.

Nicelas Ryse, William Pollesta, etc., by\r\n  their common consent have granted.”—_Lansdowne MS._, No. 896,\r\n  fol. 116.\r\n\r\n  [333] Skene alleges that these laws were made by David I., who\r\n  died in 1152-53. George Chalmers states, that, from allusion to\r\n  them in a charter to Glasgow, bearing date 1176, they were at\r\n  least by that time in existence.

Æneas Sylvius, who visited Scotland\r\n  as the Pope’s Legate in the reign of James I., speaks of there\r\n  seeing the almost naked paupers (pauperes, pæne nudos; ad\r\n  templa mendicantes) supplied with coals as alms.—_Historia de\r\n  Europa_, c. 46. Sibbald’s _Chronicle of Scottish Poetry_, vol.\r\n  i. p. 176.\r\n\r\n  [353] We have seen, in a previous page (p. 137, _supra_), that\r\n  the lepers met with by Maundrell, in Palestine, in 1697,\r\n  carried a kind of “cop,” or, as he expresses it, they came\r\n  “with small buckets in their hands to receive the alms of the\r\n  charitable.” Evelyn, in his interesting _Memoirs_, alludes to a\r\n  curious mode of sending alms to the leper that he saw practised\r\n  one hundred years ago in Holland. In his Diary, under the date\r\n  of 26th July 1641, he states, “I passed through Deft to the\r\n  Hague, in which journey I observed divers leprous poor\r\n  creatures dwelling in solitary huts on the brink of the water,\r\n  and permitted to aske the charity of the passengers, which is\r\n  conveyed to them in a floating box that they cast out.”—Bray’s\r\n  edition of _Evelyn’s Memoirs_, etc., vol. i. p. 12.\r\n\r\n  [354] _Antiquitates Italicæ Medii Ævi_, tom. iii. p. 54.\r\n\r\n  [355] _Sir Tristrem_, a metrical Romance of the thirteenth\r\n  century, edited by Sir Walter Scott (Edinb. 1804),\r\n  Introduction, p. 12.\r\n\r\n  [356] Tytler’s “Historical Inquiry into the ancient state of\r\n  Scotland,” _History_ (2d edit.), pp. 305 and 337.\r\n\r\n  [357] In Robert de Brunne’s translation (made in the reign of\r\n  Edward the Third) of Peter Langtoft’s Chronicles, the same term\r\n  “mesel” is used as synonymous with leper, and applied to one\r\n  designated in the rubrics “Baldeiano Leproso.”\r\n\r\n    Baldewyn the Meselle, his name so hight, ...\r\n    For foul meselrie he comond with no man.\r\n\r\n  John Trevisa has rendered the lepra of Glanville by “meselry,”\r\n  in translating, in 1398, the treatise _De Proprietatibus\r\n  Rerum_.—See the London edition of 1535, pp. 109-110.\r\n\r\n  [358] _Testament of Cresseid_, as previously quoted.\r\n\r\n  [359] Lord Coke’s _First Institutes of the Laws of England_\r\n  (Thomas’ edit.) vol. ii. p. 193, and vol. i. p. 162.\r\n\r\n  [360] Lindenborg’s _Codex Legum Antiquarum_ (1613), p. 609.\r\n\r\n  [361] _Observations sur l’Histoire de S.

With respect to places, the soldiers should not\r\n  remain long near unhealthy marshes, nor in arid situations that\r\n  are destitute of the shades of trees; nor on hills without\r\n  tents in summer. They ought not to be late in the day in\r\n  commencing their march, lest they contract disease from the\r\n  heat of the sun and the fatigue of their journey; and, indeed,\r\n  in summer, they had better arrive at their destination before\r\n  the morning is advanced. In severe weather they should not\r\n  pursue their journey through snow and ice at night; nor be\r\n  allowed to suffer from scarcity of fuel, or a deficient supply\r\n  of clothing. For the soldier who is obliged to endure cold is\r\n  neither in a fit state for enjoying health, nor for marching.\r\n  Nor should he make use of unwholesome nor of marsh waters. For\r\n  a draught of bad water induces, like a poison, disease in those\r\n  who drink it. And, moreover, in this case, the unremitting\r\n  diligence of the generals, tribunes, and their assistants, as\r\n  wielding the highest authority, will be required, so that their\r\n  sick comrades may be restored by seasonable articles of food,\r\n  and be cured by the skill of the physicians (_arte medicorum_).\r\n  For it is difficult to manage with those who are at one and the\r\n  same time oppressed with the evils of disease and of war. But\r\n  those who are skilled in military affairs have held that daily\r\n  exercise contributes more to the health of the soldiers than\r\n  the physicians do. Wherefore, they have advised that the foot\r\n  soldiers should be regularly exercised during seasons of rain\r\n  and snow under cover, and at other seasons openly. In like\r\n  manner, they have ordered that the horsemen should assiduously\r\n  exercise themselves and their horses, not only on level ground,\r\n  but also in steep places, and in parts rendered difficult by\r\n  wide ditches, so that nothing new or strange may occur to them\r\n  in this respect during the casualties of battle. From all this\r\n  may be inferred how much the more diligently an army ought to\r\n  be trained in the exercise of arms, seeing, as we do, that the\r\n  habit of labour procures alike health in the camp and victory\r\n  in the battle-field. If (Vegetius adds) a multitude of soldiers\r\n  be permitted during the summer or autumn seasons to remain long\r\n  in the same locality, from the corruption of the water, and the\r\n  stench of their filth, the atmosphere is rendered insalubrious,\r\n  their respiration becomes vitiated, and most dangerous disease\r\n  is engendered; and this cannot be remedied by any other means\r\n  than by a change of encampment.”—(_De Re Militari_, III. 2.)\r\n\r\n  [372] _Galeni Omnia Opera_, Ed. Kühn, vol. xiii. p. 604. Celsus\r\n  speaks of the possibility of studying human internal anatomy by\r\n  looking at the wounds of soldiers, etc. “Interdum enim\r\n  gladiatorem in arena, vel _militem in acie_, vel viatorem a\r\n  latronibus exceptum sic vulnerari, ut ejus interior aliqua pars\r\n  aperiatur.”—_De Medicina_, lib. i. p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [373] See _Odyssey_, lib. iv. v. 229, etc.\r\n\r\n  [374] _Euterpe_, II. § 84; _Thalia_, III. §§ 1 and 132.\r\n\r\n  [375] _Historia Naturalis_, lib. xxvi. c. 1. Pliny states that\r\n  the Egyptians even prosecuted the study of morbid anatomy by\r\n  dissection:—“In Ægypto, regibus corpora mortuorum ad\r\n  scrutandos morbos insecantibus.”—(Lib. xix. c. 5.) Galen\r\n  advised those who desired, in his day, to become acquainted\r\n  with human osteology, to repair for that purpose to Alexandria,\r\n  for this potent reason, that there were two actual human\r\n  skeletons preserved in that city.—See Kühn’s edit. of Galen,\r\n  vol. ii. p. 220.\r\n\r\n  [376] _De Vitis, etc., Clarorum Philosophorum_, lib. iii. v. 8.\r\n\r\n  [377] “In expeditione bellica absque mercede curantur; medici\r\n  enim annonam ex publico accipiunt.”—_Bibliothecæ Historicæ_\r\n  (Amsterdam edition of 1746), vol. i. p. 92. Lib. i. § 82.\r\n\r\n  [378] It has been suggested by some authorities, but without\r\n  sufficient grounds, that in practice Machaon exercised only the\r\n  art of surgery, while Podalirius followed the art of medicine.\r\n  Hence, it is argued, Agamemnon, when Menelaus was wounded, did\r\n  not send for Podalirius, but Machaon. Arctinus, one of the\r\n  early cyclic poets, takes this view.—See Welcker’s _Cyclus\r\n  Epicus_: “Ilii Excidium Arctini,” xiii. 2.\r\n\r\n  [379] See Eustathius’ _Commentarii in Homeri Iliadem_, _loc.\r\n  cit._; and Dr. Adams’ _Paulus Ægineta_, vol. ii. p. 426.\r\n  Plato, in his _Republic_, discourses as to whether the potion\r\n  of Pramnian wine, etc., given to Machaon (whom by mistake he\r\n  names Eurypylus), was not too inflammatory in its\r\n  character.—(Lib. iii. c. 14.)\r\n\r\n  [380] The treatise in question, though usually printed amongst\r\n  the Hippocratic works, is not admitted to be genuine by any of\r\n  the translators or commentators upon Hippocrates, with the\r\n  exception of Foes.—See Dr. Adams’ _Works of Hippocrates_, vol.\r\n  i. p. 121.\r\n\r\n  [381] Xenophon’s expression (ιατροὺς κατέστησαν ὀκτω) has been\r\n  supposed by some commentators to indicate that eight soldiers,\r\n  perhaps previously experienced to some extent in tending the\r\n  wounded, were selected and improvised into medical officers,\r\n  rather than that eight were chosen out of a greater number of\r\n  medical attendants present with the army. But, in all\r\n  probability, there were present among the ten thousand Greeks\r\n  more than eight men who professed the imperfect medical\r\n  knowledge pertaining to the surgeons of that day. In a later\r\n  part of the _Anabasis_ (v. 8), Xenophon, in defending himself\r\n  against accusations of alleged severity on his part, in the\r\n  course of the retreat, to some of the soldiers under his\r\n  command, argues for its necessity on the principle that\r\n  “physicians also use incisions and caustics for the good of\r\n  their patients.” He owns to having urged some, when themselves\r\n  unwilling, to continue their march towards the shores of the\r\n  Black Sea, through the cold and snows of Armenia, “because,”\r\n  says he, “sitting down and rest made the blood to congeal, and\r\n  the toes to rot off, which was the case of a great many,”—a\r\n  result that lately happened only too frequently to the soldiers\r\n  of our own armies on the opposite or Crimean shores of the\r\n  Euxine.\r\n\r\n  [382] _De Rebus Gestis Alexandri Magni_, lib. ix. cap. 18. In\r\n  lib. iv. cap. 25, an account is given of the extraction of an\r\n  arrow from the king’s shoulder, by the surgeon Philip of\r\n  Acarnania, who had previously cured Alexander of the attack of\r\n  fever which followed on his bathing, when overheated, in the\r\n  cold waters of the Cydnus. Curtius speaks (iii. 13) of Philip\r\n  as one “inter nobiles medicos,” who were present with the army.\r\n  When describing the well-known incident of the fever draught\r\n  given by this physician Philip to Alexander, Arrian speaks of\r\n  him, not as a medical attendant upon the king, but as one “in\r\n  whose extraordinary skill in physic Alexander had great\r\n  confidence, because of his success in the camp,” or in\r\n  attending upon other members of the army.—(Lib. ii. cap. 4.)\r\n  Alexander himself affected some knowledge of medicine. At\r\n  least, when Craterus was invalided, and Pausanias, the\r\n  physician in attendance upon him, proposed to give him a dose\r\n  of hellebore, Alexander (as we are informed by Plutarch) wrote\r\n  a letter to Pausanias, expressing his great anxiety about the\r\n  case, and desiring him to be cautious in the use of this\r\n  medicine. In Alexander’s own chest-wound, as detailed in the\r\n  text above, the head of the arrow possibly did not enter the\r\n  cavity of the thorax, as its point was, according to Plutarch’s\r\n  account, fixed in the bone (the scapula or a rib?). When Julius\r\n  Cæsar fell under the daggers of his assassins, out of the\r\n  twenty-three wounds which he received, there was none that was\r\n  mortal, in the opinion of the surgeon Antistisius, except the\r\n  second, a penetrating wound of the breast. (See Suetonius’\r\n  _Julius_, c. 82.) After Epaminondas was fatally wounded at the\r\n  battle of Mantinea, he refused to allow the iron of the spear\r\n  with which he was struck to be extracted till the victory was\r\n  decided—aware that, from its site, death from bleeding would\r\n  immediately follow—an event which the result\r\n  confirmed.—(_Cornel. Nepos_, lib. xv. c. 9.)\r\n\r\n  [383] At the famous battle at the Lake Regillus, fought 497\r\n  years before the commencement of the Christian era, Livy tells\r\n  us that after Titus Herminius slew Mamilius, he was himself\r\n  struck with a javelin while stripping the body of his enemy;\r\n  and on being brought back to the camp victorious, he died on\r\n  the first dressing of his wound (inter primam _curationem_\r\n  expiraverit).—_Livii Historiarum Libri_, lib. ii. cap. xx. It\r\n  is not, however, stated whether this cure of the wound was\r\n  attempted by the hand of a military comrade, or by that of a\r\n  surgeon. The same historian mentions that a few years later\r\n  (B.C. 483), after the battle in which the Romans defeated the\r\n  Hetrurians, the surviving consul, M. Fabius, distributed his\r\n  wounded soldiers, for the purpose of cure, among the senators\r\n  residing in Rome (saucios milites _curandos_ dividit\r\n  patribus).—See _Livy_, lib. ii. cap. xlvii. And Tacitus, when\r\n  describing the catastrophe resulting from the fall of the\r\n  amphitheatre at Fidena, in the reign of Tiberius, states that\r\n  those injured and wounded by the accident were received into\r\n  the houses of the citizens, and there carefully attended to, as\r\n  (he adds) was the custom in former times after great battles\r\n  (veterum institutis similis, qui magna post proelia saucios\r\n  largitione et cura sustentabant).—_Annal._, lib. iv. c. 63.\r\n\r\n  [384] See lib. vii. cap. v. “Telorum ejectio.”\r\n\r\n  [385] Dr. Adams’ Translation, book vi. § lxxxviii. vol. ii. p.\r\n  418.\r\n\r\n  [386] Xiphilin gives the following account from Dion Cassius of\r\n  the various difficulties and disasters encountered by Severus,\r\n  from the rivers, marshes, woods, stratagems, etc., of the\r\n  Caledonians:—“Severus, wishing to reduce the whole island\r\n  under his power, entered into Caledonia, and, in marching\r\n  through it, encountered the greatest difficulties; for he had\r\n  to cut down woods, make roads over mountains, mounds across the\r\n  marshes, and bridges over the rivers. He fought no battle, nor\r\n  did he ever meet with the forces of the enemy in array; but\r\n  they advisedly placed sheep and oxen in the way of our troops,\r\n  so that when our soldiers attempted to seize the booty, and\r\n  were thus drawn far from the line of march, they were easily\r\n  cut off. The waters and lakes, likewise, were destructive to\r\n  our men, as by dividing them they fell into the ambuscades\r\n  prepared for them; and when they could not be brought off, they\r\n  were slain by their comrades, that they might not fall into the\r\n  hands of the enemy. Owing to these causes there died not less\r\n  than fifty thousand of our troops.”—Xiphilin’s _Excerpta_, p.\r\n  305. Severus himself seems to have suffered in his health\r\n  during this Scottish campaign; for during the most of it, he\r\n  required, says Dion, to be carried, on account of his weakness,\r\n  in a closed litter (nam plurimum propter _imbecilitatem_ operta\r\n  lectica vehebatur—p. 305). Both Dion (p. 307) and Herodian (p.\r\n  153) mention that he was disabled by gout.\r\n\r\n  [387] Herodian’s account of the labours and difficulties of\r\n  Severus in this campaign sufficiently indicates the sources of\r\n  malaria and disease to which his army was subjected, and, at\r\n  the same time, affords a curious statement regarding the\r\n  condition and habits of the ancient Caledonians:—“Severus’\r\n  first care (says Herodian) was to throw bridges across the\r\n  morasses, that his soldiers might be able to pursue the enemy\r\n  over the dangerous places, and have the opportunity of fighting\r\n  on firm ground; for as the greater part of the island is\r\n  frequently overflowed by the tides, these constant inundations\r\n  make the country full of lakes and marshes. In these the\r\n  barbarians swim, or wade through them up to their middle,\r\n  regardless of mud or dirt, as they always go almost naked; for\r\n  they are ignorant of the use of clothes, and only cover their\r\n  necks and bellies with fine plates of iron, which they esteem\r\n  as an ornament and sign of wealth, and are as proud of it as\r\n  other barbarians are of gold. They likewise dye their skins\r\n  with the pictures of various kinds of animals, which is one\r\n  principal reason for their wearing no clothes, because they are\r\n  loath to hide the fine paintings on their bodies. But they are\r\n  a very warlike and fierce people, and arm only with a narrow\r\n  shield and spear, and a sword hanging by their naked bodies;\r\n  unacquainted with the use of habergeons and helmets, which they\r\n  think would be an obstruction to their wading through the ponds\r\n  and marshes of their country, which, perpetually sending up\r\n  thick gross vapours, condense the air and make it always\r\n  foggy.”—Hart’s _Herodian_, pp. 153, 154. Dion Cassius, who\r\n  lived at the date of Severus’ expedition, gives, when\r\n  describing the expedition, an account of our Caledonian\r\n  ancestors that is in no degree more flattering. “The\r\n  Caledonians,” says he, “both possess rugged and dry mountains,\r\n  and desert plains full of marshes. They have neither castles\r\n  nor towns; nor do they cultivate the ground; but live on their\r\n  flocks and hunting, and the fruits of some trees; not eating\r\n  fish, though extremely plenteous. They live in tents, naked,\r\n  and without buskins. Wives they have in common, and breed up\r\n  their children in common. The general form of government is\r\n  democratic. They are addicted to robbery; fight in cars; have\r\n  small and swift horses. Their infantry are remarkable for speed\r\n  in running, and for firmness in standing. Their armour consists\r\n  of a shield, and a short spear, in the lower end of which is a\r\n  brazen apple, whose sound when struck may terrify the enemy.\r\n  They have also daggers. Famine, cold, and all sorts of labour\r\n  they can bear, for they will even stand in their marshes, for\r\n  many days, up to the neck in water, and, in the woods, will\r\n  live on the bark and roots of trees. They prepare a certain\r\n  kind of food on all occasions, of which taking only a bit the\r\n  size of a bean, they feel neither hunger nor\r\n  thirst.”—Xiphilin’s _Excerpta_, p. 304; and Pinkerton’s\r\n  _Inquiry into the Early History of Scotland_, vol. i. p. 438.\r\n\r\n  [388] See Gordon’s _Journey through Scotland_, p. 75. Bruce, in\r\n  his work on _The Roman Wall_, p. 214, speaks of the ancient\r\n  city of Borcovicus as likely, when excavated, to prove “the\r\n  Pompeii of Britain.” Stukeley, in a similar spirit, declared it\r\n  the “Tadmor of Britain.”\r\n\r\n  [389] It is possible the word may be a contraction for\r\n  _ordinatus_ (appointed), and not for _ordinarius_.\r\n\r\n  [390] _The Roman Wall_: a Historical, etc., Account of the\r\n  Barrier of the Lower Isthmus, extending from the Tyne to the\r\n  Solway, p. 228.\r\n\r\n  [391] _Vita Agricolæ_, cap. 36 (Orelli’s edit. vol. ii. p.\r\n  441).\r\n\r\n  [392] Stuart, in his _Caledonia Romana_, p. 340, gives a copy\r\n  of a legionary tablet found at Castlecary, which states that\r\n  the first Tungrian Cohort had erected 1000 paces (mille passus)\r\n  of the wall.\r\n\r\n  [393] Horsley’s _Britannia Romana_, p. 205. Stuart’s _Caledonia\r\n  Romana_, p. 164.\r\n\r\n  [394] According to Horsley, it was probably under the reign of\r\n  Marcus Aurelius that the Tungrian Cohort became stationed at\r\n  Castle-steeds, in Cumberland, where they erected an altar to\r\n  Jupiter. Lastly (he adds), this Cohort settled at Housesteads,\r\n  where we have six or seven of their inscriptions under four or\r\n  five different commanders. Here they seem to have continued\r\n  till the lowest time of the empire. The _Notitia_ places this\r\n  Cohort at Borcovicus (Housesteads).—_Britannia Romana_, p. 89.\r\n\r\n  [395] _United Service Journal_ for 1841, vol. iii. p. 124.\r\n\r\n  [396] See Eckhel’s _Doctrina Nummorum Veterum_, vol. i. p. 8,\r\n  and vol. vi. p. 495.\r\n\r\n  [397] _Inscriptiones Romanæ_, p. 68, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2; and p.\r\n  269, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  [398] The name of Domitian (see the plate) is erased from the\r\n  inscription—a practice which has been followed sometimes in\r\n  relation to the names of other Roman tyrants besides him; but\r\n  the name of the consul on the stone fixes the date and reign.\r\n\r\n  [399] _Syntagma Inscriptionum Antiquarum_ (1682), p. 611, 7.\r\n  See also Spon’s _Miscellanea Eruditæ Antiquitatis_, 145, 16;\r\n  and Dr. Middleton’s Dissertation “De Medicorum apud veteres\r\n  Romanos conditione,” in his Works, vol. iv. p. 103.\r\n\r\n  [400] _Novus Thesaurus Vet. Inscriptionum_, 1046, 5.\r\n\r\n  [401] In the text I have given the reading of this puzzling\r\n  inscription suggested by Hultmann, in his _Miscellanea\r\n  Epigraphi_, p. 415, the letters referring to the corps to which\r\n  SPORUS was attached being very indistinct—namely, “Medico alar\r\n  indianae etheriae astorum.” The inscription, if Hultmann’s\r\n  suggestion be correct, indicates the third wing or cohort of\r\n  the Asturian or Spanish auxiliaries. The first and second wings\r\n  of the Astures (_Astorum_), and the first cohort of them, are\r\n  mentioned in the celebrated “Notitia imperii” as located at the\r\n  time at which that army-list was made out, at three different\r\n  military stations along the line of Hadrian’s wall from the\r\n  Tyne to the Solway; and various inscriptions raised by these\r\n  troops have been dug up in Northumberland and Cumberland. See\r\n  Dr. Bruce’s work, p. 47, 110 and 154. These English slabs all\r\n  read _Asturum_, instead of the _Astorum_ of the Notitia, and of\r\n  the Italian inscription referred to in the text. Let me add\r\n  that inscriptions referring to soldiers of the Ala Indiana or\r\n  Indian wing of auxiliary horsemen, have also been found in\r\n  England.—See an example in Mr. Akerman’s Archæological Index,\r\n  p. 67, and Messrs Buckmann and Newmarch’s Corinium, p. 115.\r\n\r\n  [402] “In Legione sunt Cohortes decem.”—_Cincius in Aulus\r\n  Gellius_, xvi. 4.\r\n\r\n  [403] _Museum Veronense_, p. 120, 4. See also Gruter’s\r\n  _Inscriptiones Romanæ_, tom. i. p. 633, fig. 5. The exact age\r\n  of the dead, not as to years only, but as to months, as in the\r\n  above tablet, and sometimes even as to days, is a feature\r\n  peculiar to Roman monumental inscriptions. And nothing appears\r\n  to us more strange and interesting in relation to Roman\r\n  monumental tablets, than their total or almost total silence as\r\n  to a future state, and the possibility of meeting beyond the\r\n  grave. Out of the almost innumerable Roman monumental\r\n  inscriptions that have now been copied and published, not one,\r\n  as far as I am aware, ventures to refer to the hope of a future\r\n  life. They seem to have looked upon the idea of a future state\r\n  of existence as poetical imagery only, and not reality; all\r\n  doubting, like Tacitus, “si quis piorum manibus locus; si, ut\r\n  sapientibus placet, non cum corpore extinguuntur magnæ\r\n  animæ.”—_Vita Agricolæ_, cap. 46.\r\n\r\n  [404] There is, at the end of the third line, an evident\r\n  ellipsis of the word _Uxoris_. It is scarcely necessary to add\r\n  that, as is well known, these old Roman inscriptions abound in\r\n  errors of orthography and grammar.\r\n\r\n  [405] _De Re Militari_, lib. ii. cap. 10.\r\n\r\n  [406] Grævius’ _Thesaurus_, vol. x. p. 1021.\r\n\r\n  [407] _Annal._ lib. i. cap. 71.\r\n\r\n  [408] _Scriptores Historiæ Romanæ_, tom. ii. p. 355.\r\n\r\n  [409] _Annal._ lib. i. cap. 65.\r\n\r\n  [410] _Ibid._ cap. 69.\r\n\r\n  [411] Livy, lib. iv. cap. 39.\r\n\r\n  [412] _De Bello Africano_, cap. xxi. The exigencies of war\r\n  sometimes converted the stronger soldiers into the only\r\n  available transport corps for the sick and wounded. Xenophon\r\n  speaks in the _Anabasis_ (lib. iii. cap. iv.), of the number of\r\n  Greeks capable of fighting being diminished, because some\r\n  soldiers were employed in carrying the wounded, and others in\r\n  carrying the arms of the latter. One anecdote subsequently told\r\n  by Xenophon seems to show that, occasionally at least, if not\r\n  as the common rule, one soldier was deemed capable of carrying\r\n  a sick or wounded companion. For he informs us, that towards\r\n  the end of the expedition, when publicly accused of being\r\n  sometimes too severe to the soldiers during the long retreat of\r\n  the Greeks, the only person who came forward to substantiate\r\n  the charge, was a soldier whom he had compelled to carry a sick\r\n  comrade, and who, it turned out, had subsequently dug a pit to\r\n  bury the invalid before he was completely dead. The army held\r\n  that Xenophon had not beaten the complainant so much as he\r\n  actually deserved for this conduct.—_Anabasis_, lib. v. cap.\r\n  8.\r\n\r\n  [413] _Inscriptiones Regni Neapolitani Latinæ_, No. 2701.\r\n\r\n  [414] _Atti e Monumenti de fratelli Arvali_, vol. ii. p. 826.\r\n\r\n  [415] In the fragmentary list of the two old Roman fleets\r\n  stationed at Misenum and Ravenna, collected from various\r\n  inscriptions by Mommsen (p. 477), it is not uninteresting to\r\n  find the ships—sixteen or eighteen centuries ago—bearing\r\n  names exactly the same as those borne by our modern royal and\r\n  commercial navies; as The Cupid, The Diana, Mars, Neptune,\r\n  Ceres, The Fortune (_Fortuna_), The Victory (_Victoria_), The\r\n  Hope (_Spes_), The Faith (_Fides_), The Triumph (_Triumphus_),\r\n  Providence (_Providentia_), The Peace (_Pax_), The Tiber\r\n  (_Tiberis_), The Nile (_Nilus_), etc.\r\n\r\n  [416] Thus when Cato the younger, after the battle of Thapsus,\r\n  committed suicide at Utica, by stabbing himself in the abdomen,\r\n  his friends rushed into his room, on hearing him fall, and\r\n  among them his attendant physician, Cleanthes, who replaced the\r\n  uninjured bowels, and began to staunch and sew up the gash. But\r\n  on recovering from his state of syncope, Cato thrust aside the\r\n  surgeon, tore asunder the wound, pulled out the entrails, and\r\n  speedily expired.—(See Plutarch’s Life of him, and Hirtius’\r\n  _Commentar. De Bell. Africano_, cap. 88.) Cicero and Seneca\r\n  have written applaudingly of Cato’s suicide. Lucan invests him\r\n  with all godlike virtues; and various modern writers have\r\n  spoken in enthusiastic terms of his unbending moral dignity and\r\n  magnanimity of character. But one anecdote, mentioned by\r\n  Plutarch, seems calculated to detract not a little from our\r\n  modern estimate of the mental character of this “the last and\r\n  greatest of the Romans.” In stabbing himself, Cato could not,\r\n  according to Plutarch, strike sufficiently hard to produce an\r\n  immediately fatal wound, in consequence of inflammation in his\r\n  hand, which had required to be dressed by Cleanthes; for a few\r\n  hours before death, Cato,—that alleged “paragon of Roman\r\n  virtue,”—had severely injured his fist by striking one of his\r\n  slaves in the mouth with it.\r\n\r\n  [417] The death of Pansa, the consul, at the battle of Mutina,\r\n  in the year B.C. 48, is detailed by Suetonius and Tacitus in\r\n  such a way as proves that Glycon attended the army as surgeon\r\n  to Pansa, and took professional care of the consul when he was\r\n  wounded. In fact, Glycon was thrown into prison, after Pansa’s\r\n  death, upon a suspicion of having poisoned his wounds.—(See\r\n  Tacitus’ _Annal._ lib. i. cap. 10; Suetonius’ _Octavius_, cap.\r\n  11.) M. Brutus, in a letter to Cicero, begs the interference of\r\n  Cicero in favour of Glycon, and pleads his innocence of the\r\n  deed imputed to him.—(Cicer. ad Brut. 6.)\r\n\r\n  [418] Kühn’s Edit. of Galen, vol. xiv. pp. 649, 650.\r\n\r\n  [419] _Histoire de la Médicine_, vol. ii. p. 54 (Jourdan’s\r\n  Translation). “Scribonius Largus vivait sous le règne de\r\n  l’Empereur Claude, qu’il suivit dans ses campagnes\r\n  d’Angleterre.”\r\n\r\n  [420] Wilkins’ Edition of Browne’s Works, vol. iii. p. 467.\r\n\r\n  [421] “_Medicis_ ministrisque conaretur persuadere, senem ut e\r\n  medio quam primum quoquo modo tollerent.”—Lib. iii. p. 412. The\r\n  Emperor Marcus Aurelius died in Pannonia, when prosecuting a\r\n  war against the German tribes. Dion Cassius alludes to the\r\n  physicians who were in attendance upon Aurelius during this\r\n  long campaign, when adverting to the report that the emperor’s\r\n  death was caused by them, in order to promote his son and\r\n  successor Commodus (“peremptus a _Medicis_ qui Commodo\r\n  gratificabantur.”—_Excerpta_, p. 252). But Capitolinus, the\r\n  principal authority regarding the biography of Aurelius, does\r\n  not even advert to the report. On the other hand, he describes\r\n  Aurelius’ fatal illness as one of seven days’ duration, and\r\n  states that the emperor only dismissed Commodus from his\r\n  presence on the last day, lest he should communicate the\r\n  disease to him. (“Septimo die gravatus est; et solum filium\r\n  admisit; quem statim dimisit, _ne in eum morbus\r\n  transiret._”—_Scriptores Historiæ Romanæ_, vol. ii. p. 298.)\r\n\r\n  [422] Lib. iii. p. 413. “Nam et _Medicos_ supplicio affecit,\r\n  quod sibi parum obtemperaverant, jubenti senis maturare necem.”\r\n  This, as stated in the text, was one of the first, if not the\r\n  first, act of cruelty which Caracalla committed after Severus’\r\n  death. Dion affirms that, after murdering his brother Geta, he\r\n  ordered about 20,000 of Geta’s supposed friends to be put to\r\n  death; and amongst others he condemned to death, according to\r\n  Spartian, a class which is medically not uninteresting—namely,\r\n  all those who wore amulets or charms about their necks for the\r\n  cure of agues, a custom which would appear to have been much in\r\n  use both among the Greeks and Romans.—See Hart’s Herodian, p.\r\n  177.\r\n\r\n  [423] As a further not uninteresting record of the habits of\r\n  these times, as contrasted with our own, let me add (though the\r\n  topic is not altogether medical), that after Severus died at\r\n  York, worn out, according to Herodian, more by grief than by\r\n  disease (moerore magis quam morbo consumptus), his body was\r\n  burned, and the ashes left by the corpse inclosed in an urn of\r\n  alabaster with perfumes (odoribus).—Herodian, p. 413. His\r\n  sons, with their own hands, lighted the funeral pile. Dion\r\n  states that, shortly before his death, Severus sent for the urn\r\n  that was destined to contain his ashes, and addressed it in\r\n  terms too truly significant of the vanity and emptiness of the\r\n  highest earthly ambition and the greatest earthly success: “_Tu\r\n  virum capies quem totus orbis terrarum non cepit._”—Dion, p.\r\n  307.\r\n\r\n  [424] _Antiquitates Neomagenses, sive Notitia rarissimarum\r\n  rerum Antiquariarum_, etc. (1678), pp. 97, 99. When describing\r\n  these two medicine-stamps (which are interesting as having been\r\n  the first rediscovered in modern times), Schmidt ingenuously\r\n  states:—“De illis quid sentiam, non facile dixerim, sæpe mecum\r\n  cogito, quid sibi illa velint. Ego tamen _nihil_ adhuc\r\n  affirmare audeo.”—P. 98. Hugo Grotius, in his _Respublica\r\n  Hollandiæ_ (1630), speaks of Schmidt as “antiquitatum omnium\r\n  cultor summus, cujus commentarium de Noviomagi oppidi\r\n  (_Nymegen_) antiquitate avidissime expectamus.”—P. 123.\r\n\r\n  [425] _Miscellanea Eruditæ Antiquitatis_ (1685), pp. 236-238.\r\n\r\n  [426] “Smetius vir eruditus nobis exhibet lapides duos virides\r\n  quadratos, in margine scriptos, quarum usum se ignorare\r\n  fatetur.

Thus\r\n  Alexander Trallianus gives a receipt for a very complex\r\n  collyrium, which, when anointed upon the eyes, enabled those\r\n  who used it to gaze upon the sun even without harm (Possis\r\n  etiam solem citra noxam intueri).—_De Arte Medica_, lib. ii.\r\n  p. 174.\r\n\r\n  [439] “Etiam Asclepiades plurimam et optimam tum aridorum tum\r\n  liquidorum collyriorum conscripsit silvam.” See Kühn’s edit. of\r\n  _Galen_, vol. xii. p. 226. Asclepiades, who enjoyed during his\r\n  life high professional popularity at Rome, seems to have\r\n  flourished in the century preceding the commencement of the\r\n  Christian era; and the expression of Galen (_sylva\r\n  collyriorum_) consequently shows us the great number and extent\r\n  of the collyria known and used even at that early period. For\r\n  notices of the time and character of Asclepiades, see Pliny’s\r\n  _Historia Naturalis_, lib. xxv. cap. 7; Grumpert’s _Asclepiades\r\n  Bithyni Fragmenta_, Vinar. 1794; Burdach’s _Scriptorum de\r\n  Asclepiade Index_, Leipzig, 1800.\r\n\r\n  [440] In the following passage Galen tersely enumerates the\r\n  very varied general ingredients, and general therapeutic\r\n  effects, of the numerous collyria used by the Roman\r\n  practitioners of his day:—“Nam et liquores, et succi, et\r\n  semina, et fructus, et plantarum particulæ, ocularibus\r\n  compositionibus induntur, veluti etiam non pauca ex iis, quæ\r\n  metallica appellantur; aliqua quidem extreme austera, et\r\n  acerba, atque aeria; aliqua vero his moderatiora et tamen\r\n  fortia; quemadmodum item aliqua omnia mordacitatis expertia, ac\r\n  lenissima per lotionem reddita.”—_De Compositione Medicam.\r\n  secundum Locos_, cap. i.; Kühn’s edition, vol. xii. p. 699.\r\n\r\n  [441] Celsus, in the same way, enumerates and describes the\r\n  collyria of Philon, of Dionysius, of Cleon, of Theodotius, of\r\n  Euelpides (_qui ætate nostra maximus fuit ocularius medicus_),\r\n  of Nileus, of Hermon, etc. See his _Medicinæ Libri_, lib. vi.\r\n\r\n  [442] Appellantur talia a medicis collyria _libiana_ et\r\n  _cygni_, ob colorem quidem album.—Galen, _de Compos.

According to Pliny, Prodicus, a disciple of\r\n  Hippocrates, founded the mode of cure termed “Iatraleptice.” By\r\n  this means (adds Pliny) he opened a road to riches to the\r\n  slaves and rubbers themselves employed by the physicians\r\n  (reunctoribus quoque medicorum ac mediastinis vectigal\r\n  invenit).

Perhaps the\r\n  medical idea of staining the cicatrices of the eyes was\r\n  suggested by the circumstance, that the Romans, like the\r\n  ancient Egyptians, occasionally had recourse to dyeing or\r\n  staining their eyebrows in the decorations of the toilet. On\r\n  the substances (_calliblephara_) used for this purpose, see\r\n  Pliny, lib. xxiii. cap. 4, and lib. xxxv. cap. 16. Juvenal\r\n  alludes to the practice in his Second Satire, v. 93:—\r\n\r\n    Ille supercilium madida fuligine tactum\r\n    Obliqua producit acu, pingitque trementes\r\n    Attollens oculos.\r\n\r\n  [500] See _Medicæ Artis Principes_. De Medicam. p. 280.\r\n\r\n  [501] In the Minutes of the Society of Antiquaries for 17th\r\n  November 1757, the word is copied as DELICATA.\r\n\r\n  [502] Thus Nicolaus Myrepsus describes the “Collyrium nominatum\r\n  _Sol_;” the “Collyrium _Aster_, hoc est stella;” the “Collyrium\r\n  dictum _Lumen_.” See his _Opus de Compositione Medicamentorum_,\r\n  sect. xxiv. cap. 2, 22, 3, etc. Trallianus describes the\r\n  collyrium _Phos_, etc., p. 174. Aetius gives, p. 352, a formula\r\n  for the collyrium _Uranium_. See also Oribasius, p. 50. Perhaps\r\n  I ought to have stated earlier, that in quoting the works of\r\n  Oribasius, Aetius, Myrepsus, Trallianus, Scribonius Largus, and\r\n  Marcellus, I always refer, except when it is otherwise\r\n  specified, to the writings of these authors as contained in\r\n  Stephen’s collated edition of the “_Medicæ Artis Principes post\r\n  Hippocratem et Galenum_” (Paris, 1567).\r\n\r\n  [503] _De Simplic. Medicam._ Kühn’s Edit. vol. xii. p. 152.\r\n\r\n  [504] See _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1778, p. 472.\r\n\r\n  [505] This form of Greek designation, consisting of the name of\r\n  the principal ingredients in a formula, preceded by the initial\r\n  DIA, was long retained in pharmaceutical nomenclature. The\r\n  London Pharmacopœia of 1677, for instance, has upwards of\r\n  twenty medicines or formulæ commencing with DIA, as the _Pulvis\r\n  Diasennæ_, the _Electuarium Diacinnamomum_, the syrup named\r\n  _Diacodium_, etc. Almost the only remnant of this type of\r\n  nomenclature that is retained in modern medical language, is to\r\n  be found in the well-known term _Diachylon_ plaster. The\r\n  inventor of the _Diachylon_ plaster—Menecrates—lived about\r\n  the time of Tiberius, and, according to the inscription still\r\n  preserved at Rome upon his marble tombstone (See Gruter’s\r\n  _Inscriptiones_, p. 581), he was the author of not less than\r\n  155 medical works, few or no fragments of which remain. His\r\n  plaster has greatly outlived the productions of his pen. The\r\n  medical poet, Damocrates, who wrote several pharmaceutical\r\n  works, put Menecrates’ directions for preparing the _Diachylon_\r\n  into Greek Iambic verse.—See Galen _de Compos. Medicam. sec.\r\n  Genera_, vol. xiii. p. 996.\r\n\r\n  [506] _Opera_, lib. i. cap. 77, p. 43.

Or, when extended,—“_Phronimi\r\n  Diasmyrnes post impetum lippitudinis ex ovo._”—_Tochon_, p.\r\n  66. _Phronimus_ is the name, of course, of the occulist or\r\n  proprietor.\r\n\r\n  [546] Cornarius’ Edit.; or Dr. Adams’ Edit. vol. iii. p. 550.\r\n\r\n  [547] _Med.

Philosenus (who reigned in the east of Bactria), and\r\n  Antialcides, Lysias, and Archebias (who reigned in the west),\r\n  according to Grotefend’s classification, all appropriated this\r\n  title to themselves. See Werlhof’s _Handbuch der Griechischen\r\n  Numismatik_, pp. 72 and 73.\r\n\r\n  [559] The Unguentum _Nardinum_ was one of the favourite\r\n  ointments used by the Romans for anointing the hair previous to\r\n  crowning it with the garland at their festive symposiums.—See\r\n  Horace’s _Carmina_, lib. ii. carm. xi. “Assyriaque _Nardo_\r\n  Potamus uncti.”\r\n\r\n  [560] Thus Plautus, in his _Miles Gloriosus_, act iii. sec. ii.\r\n  v. 11, speaks of wine mixed and flavoured with the perfume of\r\n  Nard—\r\n\r\n    Demisit _Nardini_ unam amphoram cellarius.\r\n\r\n  Horace, in one of his odes addressed to Virgil (_Carmina_, lib.\r\n  iv. c. 12), invites his brother poet to a drinking-party,\r\n  provided Virgil will earn his wine by bringing some spikenard;\r\n  and he declares that a small box of the perfume shall draw a\r\n  whole cask of wine from the storehouses of Sulpicius.\r\n\r\n                     _Nardo_ vina merebere.\r\n     _Nardi_ parvus onyx eliciet cadum\r\n     Que nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis.\r\n\r\n  The _onyx_, or alabaster box, mentioned in these lines of\r\n  Horace, was made of a kind of gypsum, and was used for\r\n  containing the more precious ointments, under the belief, as we\r\n  are told by Pliny (lib. xxxv. cap. 12), that this material\r\n  prevented the fragrance of the ointments from being dissipated\r\n  (quoniam optime servare incorrupta dicitur). In explanation of\r\n  the great use of ointments among the Romans, it is to be\r\n  remembered that they then formed their only vehicle for the\r\n  enjoyment of perfumes, the art of distillation being altogether\r\n  unknown to them.\r\n\r\n  [561] _Tetrabiblos_, Sermo III. cap. cxiii. pp. 436-8.\r\n\r\n  [562] Hujus auxilii actiones ac efficaciam dicere non est\r\n  facile.

Above fifty Chinese porcelain\r\n  seals, with legends, etc., inscribed upon them in ancient\r\n  Chinese characters, have now been discovered in different parts\r\n  of Ireland, and generally in localities indicating that they\r\n  had lain entombed for many long ages. See Smith in _London and\r\n  Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_ for March 1840; and Getty’s\r\n  _Notices of Chinese Seals found in Ireland_, Belfast, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [571] See Ledwich’s _Antiquities of Ireland_, p. 45—Roman\r\n  coins found at New Grange. A celebrated passage in Tacitus\r\n  proves that, even as early as the first century of the\r\n  Christian era, the Irish seaports were better known to the\r\n  merchants of these times than those of Britain were—(“Melius\r\n  aditus, portusque per commercia, et negotiatores cogniti”). See\r\n  _Agricolæ Vita_.\r\n\r\n  [572] Hildebrand states, that in the northern or Scandinavian\r\n  districts of Europe there have been found “Roman silver coins\r\n  from about the middle of the first to the commencement of the\r\n  third century (Vespasianus to Severus Alexander); but\r\n  especially those of Hadrianus, Antoninus Pius, Aurelius, and\r\n  Commodus. Along with them,” he continues, “are sometimes found\r\n  various bronze articles, as statuettes, vases, and ornaments of\r\n  various kinds of Roman workmanship, and apparently of the same\r\n  age. These coins, etc., are usually found about the islands of\r\n  Gothland and Oland, and in Scanïa. The coins are worn and\r\n  clipped, so that often the legends and reverses are defaced,\r\n  and the portrait alone tells by whom they were struck. The\r\n  reason of this is (he suggests), that the coins came to the\r\n  north after long voyages. As the Roman eagles were never\r\n  planted on Swedish soil, these coins, etc., must either have\r\n  been brought by the northern pirates from Roman possessions, or\r\n  by merchants trading with Roman subjects. Only one gold coin\r\n  (of Titus), and one ? (of Faustina the elder), are as yet known\r\n  to have been found in the North.” See Hildebrand’s _Monnaies\r\n  Anglo-Saxonnes du Cabinet Royal de Stockholm_.

In process of\r\n  time the chalcitis changes into misy by degrees, and the sori\r\n  can change into chalcitis, but requires a much longer space of\r\n  time. So that it is no wonder that these three substances\r\n  should be possessed of homogeneous (similar) powers, as\r\n  differing from one another in tenuity and density of their\r\n  parts—the grossest being the sori, and the finest the misy,\r\n  whereas chalcitis possesses an intermediate power. When burnt,\r\n  they become more attenuant, but less styptic.”—Adams’ _Paulus\r\n  Ægineta_, vol. iii. note, p. 400.

(See Alston’s _Materia Medica_, vol. ii. p.\r\n  517; Hill’s _Materia Medica_, p. 829; Quincy’s _Dispensatory_,\r\n  p. 400; Mead’s _Essay on the Viper_, 1745, etc.)\r\n\r\n  [586] Perhaps this incantation was but a remnant of that ophite\r\n  worship which appears to have in former times prevailed so\r\n  generally throughout the world. On the ancient extent of\r\n  serpent-worship in the old world, see Stukeley’s _Abury_, p.\r\n  32; Colonel Tod’s _History of Rajasthan_; the Rev. J. B.\r\n  Deane’s learned Treatise on the Worship of the Serpent, and his\r\n  observations on various ancient Dracontia, or ophite temples in\r\n  England, France, etc., in the _Archæologia_, vol. xxv. p. 180,\r\n  etc. Latterly, the observations of Mr. Squier would seem to\r\n  show that the same type of worship was, in long past times,\r\n  diffused as extensively over the new world. (See his late work,\r\n  entitled _Serpent Symbol, and the Worship of the Reciprocal\r\n  Principles of Nature in America_.) The supposed connection of\r\n  the serpent and serpent-worship with the healing art has been\r\n  handed down to us emblematically in the serpent symbol with\r\n  which the caduceus of Æsculapius is always represented as\r\n  surrounded. The Romans regarded the serpent as a symbol of\r\n  health, and we find it figured as such on some of the coins of\r\n  Augustus and Claudian.\r\n\r\n  [587] _Aphrodisiacus, sive, Collectio Auctorum de Lue Venerea._\r\n  Venet. 1566-67; and Lugd.

The infection has spread from the head\r\n  through the members, and has descended from the popes to the\r\n  rest of the clergy.”—_Pallav. Op._, vol. i. p. 160; _Sarpi_,\r\n  p. 25.\r\n\r\n  [625] See _Claud. Espencæi Opera Omnia_, p. 479. The morals of\r\n  those assembled at the “sacred” Councils of the Church showed,\r\n  perhaps, in these days, little or no amendment upon the morals\r\n  of Rome itself. At the great Council of Constance, for example,\r\n  held in the fifteenth century, there were, according to the\r\n  long list of those present, as given by Lenfant, “seven hundred\r\n  common women” whose habitations were known to Ducher; whilst\r\n  the Vienna list of the same Council sets down the list of\r\n  “meretrices vagabundæ” as fifteen hundred in number (Lenfant’s\r\n  _History of the Council of Constance_, vol. iv. pp. 414, 416).\r\n  This Council was summoned together by that misnamed “Vicegerent\r\n  of God on earth,” Pope John XXIII., a man who, according to his\r\n  own secretary, Thierry de Niem, was guilty of “all the mortal\r\n  sins, and of a multitude of abominable acts not fit to be\r\n  named” (Niem _de Vita Joh. XXIII._, ap. Von’der Hardt, tom. ii.\r\n  p. 391.) Among other matters, the Procurators of the Council\r\n  publicly accused him before it of “cum uxore fratris sui, et\r\n  cum sanctis monialibus incestum, cum virginibus stuprum, et cum\r\n  conjugatis adulterium, et alia incontinentiae crimina” (Concil.\r\n  Constan. Sess. xi., Binius, tom. iii. p. 874). Yet this same\r\n  “infallible” Council of Constance, as it termed itself, called\r\n  together, as it was, professedly for the cure of the evils and\r\n  doctrines of the Church and Papacy, principally distinguished\r\n  itself in history by burning John Huss and Jerome of Prague for\r\n  preaching from the Scriptures the pure and simple gospel of\r\n  Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n  [626] Nicol. de Clemangiis, _Opera_ (edit. Lydii), p. 22.\r\n\r\n  [627] _Opera_, tom. vi. col. 296 (ed. of 1617). The history of\r\n  these and other dark times shows us, however, occasional bright\r\n  and isolated glimpses of the existence of true Christianity in\r\n  general society and in the cloisters. In the personal history\r\n  of Luther, for example, few circumstances are more interesting\r\n  than the fact of Staupitz, the Vicar-General of the Order of\r\n  Augustine Monks of Germany, earnestly and tenderly assisting\r\n  the young and distressed monk of Erfurth to arrive at a\r\n  knowledge of salvation by faith alone (as laid down in the\r\n  Scriptures—a copy of which he presented to him), and not by\r\n  works.\r\n\r\n  [628] See Sir John Dalyell’s _Fragments of Scottish History_,\r\n  p. 11.\r\n\r\n  [629] _Polydor.

Perhaps the Archbishop held some of the other\r\n  commandments in little more respect than the seventh, if we may\r\n  judge by one of his sayings regarding Queen Mary, when a girl\r\n  of nine or ten years of age, as reported by Sir James Melville\r\n  in his _Memoirs_, p. 73. There is no wonder that Sir James\r\n  found it difficult or impossible to translate the coarse saying\r\n  of the Scotch Primate for the polite ears of Montmorency the\r\n  Constable of France.
