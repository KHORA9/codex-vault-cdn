The hygiene unfolded is both original and\r\nrevolutionary: its practicality is of the largest, and its physiology\r\nbeyond any possible question. The reader is assured in advance that\r\nevery line of this volume has been written with conviction at white\r\nheat, that enforced food in sickness and the drug that corrodes are\r\nprofessional barbarisms unworthy of the times in which we live.\r\n\r\nE.

Methods in health culture are about as numerous as\r\nthe individuals who find some method necessary for the health: taking\r\nsomething, doing something for the health is the burden of lives almost\r\ninnumerable. Very few people are so well that some improvement is not\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe literature on what to eat and not to eat, what to do and not to do,\r\non medicines that convert human stomachs into drug-stores, is simply\r\nboundless. If we believe all we read, we must consider the location we\r\nare in before we can safely draw the breath of life; we must not cool\r\nour parched throats without the certificate of the microscope. We must\r\nnot eat without an ultimate analysis of each item of the bill of fare,\r\nas we would take an account of stock before ordering fresh goods; and\r\nthis without ever knowing how much lime we need for the bones, iron for\r\nthe blood, phosphorus for the brain, or nitrogen for the muscles. In\r\nshort, there is death in the air we breathe, death in the food we eat,\r\ndeath in the water we drink, until, verily, we seem to walk our ways of\r\nlife in the very valley and shadow of death, ever subject to the attack\r\nof hobgoblins of disease.\r\n\r\nHow many lives would go down in despair but for the miracles of cure\r\npromised in the public prints, even in our best journals and monthlies,\r\nwe cannot know. It is the hope for better things that sustains our\r\nlives; suicide never occurs until all hope has departed. Even our\r\nmedical journals are heavily padded with pages of new remedies whose use\r\ninvolves the most amazing credulity. Perhaps it is well, in the absence\r\nof a sound physiological hygiene, that the people who are sick and\r\nafflicted shall be buoyed up by fresh, printed promises. Perhaps it is\r\nalso well for the physician to be able to go into the rooms of the sick\r\ninspired from the advertising pages of his favorite medical journals.\r\n\r\nAre they not new stars of hope to both physician and the people? Why\r\nshould we not hope when new remedies are multiplying in such infinite\r\nexcess over newly discovered diseases? _New diseases?_ What is there\r\nessentially new that can be treated with remedies, in the coated\r\ntongues, foul mouths, high temperature and pulse, pain, discomfort, and\r\nacute aversion to food, that is to be found in the rooms of the sick?\r\nAre there really specifics for these conditions?\r\n\r\nThe hygiene to be unfolded in these pages is so new, so revolutionary,\r\nthat its first impress has never failed to excite every form of\r\nopposition known to language, and yet its practicality is so great that\r\nit is rarely questioned by those who fairly test it. It has not been\r\nfound wanting in its physiology, nor has it failed to grow wherever it\r\nhas found lodgement.\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of this new way in health culture seem to\r\nrequire something of professional autobiography, that it may be seen\r\nthat it is a matter of evolution and not of chance, not a fad that has\r\nonly its passing hour.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving my medical degree from the University of Michigan, and\r\nserving a term as house physician to the U. S. Marine Hospital at\r\nDetroit, Michigan, I entered one of the large army hospitals at\r\nChattanooga, Tenn., at the beginning of the Sherman campaign in Georgia,\r\nwhere I found a ward of eighty sick and wounded soldiers fresh from the\r\nbattle of Resacea. My professional fitness for duties so grave and so\r\nlarge in extent was of a very questionable order, and I did not in the\r\nleast overestimate it.\r\n\r\nIt had not escaped my notice, even before I began the study of medicine,\r\nthat whether disease were coaxed with doses too small for mathematical\r\nestimate, or whether blown out with solid shot or blown up with shells,\r\nthe percentage of recoveries seemed to be about the same regardless of\r\nthe form of treatment.\r\n\r\nI was reared in a large family in a country home, several miles from a\r\nphysician, where all but the severest sicknesses were treated with\r\nherb-tea dosage, and this was true of all other country homes. With all\r\nthis in mind I had begun the study of medicine with a good deal less\r\nthan the average faith in the utility of dosage, and it was not enlarged\r\nby my professor of materia medica.\r\n\r\nI entered upon my serious duties as did good, rare, old Bunyan into his\r\npulpit, with a feeling fairly oppressive that I was \"the least of all\r\nthe saints.\" My materia medica was in my vest pocket; my small library\r\nin my head, with its contents in a very hazy condition. With a weak\r\nmemory for details, and marked inability to possess truth except by the\r\nslow process of digestion and assimilation, my brain was more a\r\nmachine-shop than a wareroom; hence capacity of retail dealing was of\r\nthe smallest. I was not in the least conscious at this time that a large\r\nwareroom amply stored by virtue of a retentive memory was not the most\r\nneeded as an equipment for all the practical affairs of life. I have\r\never found it necessary to dodge some memories, when there was lack of\r\ntime to endure a hailstorm of details.\r\n\r\nThat I did not become a danger to the hapless sick and wounded only less\r\nthan their diseases and wounds, was wholly due to my small materia\r\nmedica, to utter lack of pride in knowledge that had not become a power\r\nwith me, and to that lofty ambition for professional success which moved\r\nme to seize aid from no matter where or whom, as the drowning man a\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nIt was my great professional fortune that the medical staff of this\r\nhospital of more than a thousand cots was of a very high order of\r\nability and experience, and that I entered at the beginning of a\r\ncampaign in which for more than three months there was a fitful roar of\r\nartillery and rattle of musketry every day; hence a continuous influx to\r\ncots vacated by deaths or recoveries.\r\n\r\nIn all respects it was the best equipped hospital for professional\r\nexperience of any that I knew anything about. There was one rigid rule\r\nthat I believe was not carried out in any other hospital: post-mortems\r\nin all cases, numbering from one to a dozen daily, and all made with a\r\nthoroughness I have never seen in private practice.\r\n\r\nThe features of my hospital service that impressed me most were the\r\npost-mortem revelations and the diverse treatments for the same disease.\r\nI soon found that, no matter what the disease, every surgeon was a law\r\nto himself as to the quality, quantity, and times of his doses, with the\r\nmortality in the wards apparently about the same.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem examinations often revealed chronic diseases whose existence\r\ncould not have been suspected during life, and yet had made death\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage in army hospital practice was the stability of the\r\nposition and the absence of the harassing anxiety of friends, thus\r\naffording the highest possibilities of the judgment and reason. And\r\nstill another advantage was the high social relations existing between\r\nthe medical officers, due to the absence of all causes for jealousy,\r\nneither the position nor salary depending on superior endowments or\r\nprofessional success.\r\n\r\nI was aware that, in spite of my lack of experience and the presence of\r\na most painful sense of general insufficiency, my sick and wounded were\r\nabout as safe in my hands from professional harm, even from the first,\r\nas the patients of the most experienced medical officer in the hospital.\r\n\r\nWith high professional ideals, with no ability to make use of hazy\r\nconceptions or ideas, having no pride in knowledge that had not become\r\nmy own, I began at once to reinforce myself from the experience and\r\nwisdom of my brother officers, whose advisory services were always\r\nreadily and kindly rendered.\r\n\r\nFrom the first and all through my military service my severely sick had\r\nthe advantage of all the borrowed skill and experience I could command.\r\nAs for surgical operations, they were all performed in the presence of\r\nmost of the medical staff, some of whom were of great experience.\r\n\r\nThe surgery of the army hospitals of 1864 was of the highest character\r\nin skill and in careful attention to all the details involved, and the\r\nfatalities were generally due to the gravity of the wounds requiring\r\noperations and lack of constitutional power for recovery, rather than to\r\nthe absence of the germ-killer. At that time the microbe was not a\r\nfactor in the probabilities of life or death. In all else the care of\r\nthe wounds could hardly be surpassed.\r\n\r\nAs for the medicinal treatment of my sick, it was unsatisfactory from\r\nfirst to last. After all the years since I cannot believe that, except\r\nfor the relief of pain, any patient was made better by my dosage; and in\r\nall fatalities the post-mortem revealed the fact that the wisest dosage\r\nwould have been without avail.\r\n\r\nBut in the study of the history of disease as revealed by symptoms my\r\nhospital experience was invaluable. I have since found that my greatest\r\nservice at the beds of the sick is as an interpreter of symptoms rather\r\nthan a vender of drugs. The friends of the sick read indications for\r\ngood or bad with wonderful acuteness, as a rule; and I have rarely found\r\nmyself mistaken in my ability to read the condition of patients in the\r\nfaces of the friends, even before I enter the rooms of the sick.\r\n\r\nAs my experience enlarged so did my faith in Nature; and, since there\r\nwas no similarity in the quality, sizes, and times of the doses for like\r\ndiseases, my faith in mere remedies gradually declined.\r\n\r\nAfter a year and a half of large opportunities to study the diseases of\r\nmen in the early prime of life, in the care of the simple surgery of\r\nshot and shell, I left the army with such familiarity with grave\r\ndiseases and death in various forms as to enable me ever after to retain\r\ncomplete self-possession in the presence of dying beds in private\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nI began the general practice of medicine in Meadville in the autumn of\r\n1866. Among the many physicians located in the city at that time were\r\nmen of ability and large experience. There were those who administered\r\nwith sublime faith doses too small for mathematical estimate; those who\r\nwith equal faith administered boluses to the throat's capacity for\r\ndeglutition; those who fully believed in whiskey as nourishment, that\r\nmilk is liquid food, and who with tremendous faith and forceful hands\r\nadministered both until human stomachs were reduced to barren wastes and\r\ndeath would result from starvation aggravated by disease.\r\n\r\nMost of the cases of disease that fall to the care of the physician are\r\ntrivial, self-limited, and rapidly recover under even the most\r\ncrucifying dosages; Nature really winning the victories, the physician\r\ncarrying off the honors.\r\n\r\nThis is so nearly true that it may be stated that, aside from the domain\r\nof surgery, professional success in the general sense depends upon the\r\npersonal qualities and character of the physician rather than the\r\nachievements of the materia medica.\r\n\r\nPeople have a confidence in the power of medicine to cure disease\r\nscarcely less than the dusky warrior has in the Indian medicine-lodge of\r\nthe Western wilderness, and a confidence about as void of reason.\r\n\r\nThe physician goes into the rooms of the sick held to the severest\r\naccountability in the matter of dosage; and the larger his own faith in\r\nmedicines the greater his task; and, if he is of my own, the so-called\r\n\"old school,\" or Allopathic, the more dangerous he is to the curing\r\nefforts of Nature.\r\n\r\nWith the people the disease is simply an attack, and not the summing up\r\nof the results of violated laws going on perhaps from birth. With the\r\npeople the symptoms are merely evidences of destruction, and not the\r\nvisible efforts to restore the normal condition. Hence the failures to\r\nrelieve always raise more or less questioning, among friends in painful\r\nconcern, as to the ability of the physician to discharge his grave\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThis unreasoning, unreasonable \"blind faith\" in remedial means is as\r\nstrong in the most intelligent as in the most ignorant, and it has ever\r\ngiven me more trouble than the care of the sick. Another serious\r\ncomplication of the sick-room arises from near-by friends who are very\r\ncertain that their own physicians are better fitted by far for the\r\nserious work of prescribing for the sick.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the serious work of attacking the symptoms of disease as\r\nso many foes to life, there is also a care as to what unbidden food\r\nshall go into unbidden stomachs, that the system shall be supported\r\nwhile life seems to be in the hands of its greatest enemy.\r\n\r\nThe universal conception of disease as a foe to life, and not as a\r\nrational process of cure; the boundless faith in remedies as means to\r\nresist the attack, revealed by symptoms, makes the professional care of\r\nthe sick the gravest of all human occupations, and the most trying to\r\nboth head and heart.\r\n\r\nWith all these taxing conditions confronting me, I opened an office in a\r\nfield which seemed to be more than occupied by men of large experience.\r\n\r\nWith all my army experience I still had a hazy conception as to Nature\r\nin disease. That the vital forces needed the support of all the food the\r\nstomach of the sick could dispose of, was not a question of the remotest\r\nconsideration. That medicine did in some way act to cure disease I could\r\nnot fully question.\r\n\r\nI was now to enter a service in which, from the care of infancy in its\r\nfirst breathings to old age in its last, every resource of the materia\r\nmedica, of the reason, judgment, and of the soul itself, was to be\r\ncalled in in every grave case, and to be held to a responsibility\r\nmeasured by preposterous faith in medicines.\r\n\r\nI entered upon my duties with a determination to win professional\r\nsuccess by the most thorough attention to all the details of service\r\nupon the sick and their friends, and I confined my efforts almost wholly\r\nto acute cases. None of my professional colleagues were winning laurels\r\nby the treatment of chronic diseases, and not having faith in drugs for\r\nsuch I had my scruples about fees for failures that seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with the most painstaking service fortune would play with me at\r\ntimes in the most heartless manner. At one time four of my adult\r\npatients were awaiting burial within the radius of a half mile. As they\r\nwere all physical wrecks, and died after short illnesses, there could be\r\nno question raised in any just sense as to the character of my services,\r\nbut the fatalities were scored against me. Such fortune would be\r\nannihilating but for the fatalities inevitable with all practitioners.\r\n\r\nFor full ten years I visited the sick and dosed them according to the\r\nbooks, but with far less force of hands and faith than any of my\r\nbrethren, and all were enjoined to take nourishment to keep up the\r\nstrength for the combat with disease.\r\n\r\nMy doses were confined to only a few Sampsons of the materia medica, and\r\nthese were administered with a watching for favorable results that could\r\nhardly be surpassed, and yet always with disappointment.\r\n\r\nI was innocent enough to believe that a large practice could only be\r\nbuilt up by the most painstaking and persistent effort; later on I found\r\nthat a large practice was but little dependent upon the skill and\r\nlearning displayed in the sick-room. One physician could immediately\r\nsecure a large patronage because she was a woman; another, because he\r\nbelonged to this or that nationality, or there was something in the\r\npersonal outfit rather than in the professional that incited large hopes\r\nfor the ailing.\r\n\r\nIn all my cases of acute sickness there was always a wasting of the body\r\nno matter how much they were fed; a like increase of general strength\r\nwhen a normal desire for food occurred no matter how little they were\r\nfed. I saw this with eyesight only; but I saw with insight that a large\r\npractice could be carried on by doctors too ignorant to know that there\r\nwas an alphabet in medical science.\r\n\r\nI was not then so fully aware of the depths of ignorance among the\r\npeople as to what cures disease, did not know that faith in doses was so\r\nlarge, as child-like even with the most cultured as with the ignorant. I\r\nwas not so well aware, as I became later, that the physician himself\r\nmust have such energy of faith in the materia medica as to reveal it in\r\nevery line of his countenance when in the rooms of the sick.\r\n\r\nAs the years went on, my faith in remedies did not increase; but I had\r\nto dose to meet the superstitious needs of the people. My practice,\r\nthough far short of what it seemed to merit from the pains bestowed upon\r\nit, was large enough for all the needs of profitable study had I been in\r\na condition for thought and reflection. It was not to my encouragement\r\nthat there were those doing a far larger business with doses simply\r\ncrucifying, and because crucifying, a far larger attendance was the\r\ndirect result.\r\n\r\nI now see, as I did not then so clearly, that Nature's victories are\r\noften won against the desperate odds of treatments that are simply\r\nbarbarous; and yet Nature is so powerful, so persistent in the attempts\r\nto right all her wrongs, that she wins the victory in the great\r\nmajority of cases no matter how severely she may be taxed with means\r\nthat hinder. The great majority of the severely sick of a hundred years\r\nago recovered in spite of the bloody lancet and treatments that are the\r\nbarbarism of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was called one day to one of the families of the poorest of the poor,\r\nwhere I found a sick case that for once in my life set me to thinking.\r\nThe patient was a sallow, overgrown girl in early maturity, with a\r\nhistory of several months of digestive and other troubles. I found a\r\nvery sick patient, so sick that for a period of three weeks not even one\r\ndrink of water was retained, not one dose of medicine, and it was not\r\nuntil several more days that water could be borne. When finally water\r\ncould be retained my patient seemed brighter in mind, the complexion was\r\nclearer, and she seemed actually stronger. As for the tongue, which at\r\nfirst was heavily coated, the improvement was striking; while the\r\nbreath, utterly foul at first, was strikingly less offensive. In every\r\nway the patient was very much better.\r\n\r\nI was so surprised at this that I determined at once to let the good\r\nwork go on on Nature's own terms, and so it did until about the\r\nthirty-fifth day, when there was a call, not for the undertaker, but for\r\nfood, a call that marked the close of the disease. The pulse and\r\ntemperature had become normal, and there was a tongue as clean as the\r\ntongue of a nursing infant.\r\n\r\nUp to this time this was the most severely sick case I ever had that\r\nrecovered, and yet with not apparently more wasting of the body than\r\nwith other cases of as protracted sickness in which more or less food\r\nwas given and retained. And all this with only water for thirst until\r\nhunger came and a _complete cure_!\r\n\r\nSuch ignoring of medical faith and practice, of the accumulated wisdom\r\nand experience of all medical history, I had never seen before. Had the\r\npatient been able to take both food and medicine, and I had prohibited,\r\nand by chance death had occurred, I would have been held guilty of\r\nactually putting the patient to death--death from starvation. Feed, feed\r\nthe sick whether or not, say all the doctors, say all the books, to\r\nsupport strength or to keep life in the body, and yet Nature was absurd\r\nenough to ignore all human practice evolved from experience, and in her\r\nown way to support vital power while curing the disease.\r\n\r\nI could recall a great many cases in which because of intense aversion\r\nto food patients had been sick for many days, and even weeks, with not\r\nenough nourishment taken to account for the support of vital power; but\r\nthe fact did not raise a question with me.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this case upon my mind was so profound that I began to\r\napply the same methods in Nature to other patients, and with the same\r\ngeneral results. The body, of course, would waste during the time of\r\nsickness; but so did the bodies of sick that were fed. As for medicines,\r\nthey were utterly ignored except where pain was to be relieved, though\r\nunmedicated doses were alike a necessity with all. Not a single\r\nmedicine was given except for pain, and occasionally in cases in which I\r\nhad reason to think the entire digestive tract needed a general clearing\r\nof foul sewage. Thence on, that supreme work, the cure of disease, in my\r\nhands became the work of Nature only.\r\n\r\nIn a general practice I was able to carry out the non-feeding plan by\r\npermitting the various meat teas or the cereal broths, none of which can\r\nbe taken by the severely sick in quantities to do harm. By withholding\r\nmilk I was enabled to secure all the fasting Nature required, while\r\nsatisfying the ever-anxious friends with tea and broth diversions.\r\n\r\nThis was a line of investigation that I felt ought to be of the deepest\r\ninterest to every thinking, high-minded physician, to every intelligent\r\nlayman; and very early the evidences of the utility of withholding food\r\nfrom the sick during the entire time of absence of desire for it, its\r\nabsolute safety, were beyond any questioning.\r\n\r\nI had no fatalities that were apparently in any way due to the enforced\r\nlack of food. In cases of chronic disease in which death was inevitable,\r\nsuch as cancer, consumption, etc., patients were permitted to take what\r\nthey could with the least offence to the sense of relish. In every case\r\nof recovery there was a history of increasing general strength as the\r\ndisease declined, of an actual increase of vital power without the\r\nsupport of food that had no more relish than the dose that crucified\r\nthe nerves of taste.\r\n\r\nIn all America milk is the chief reliance to support vital power when no\r\nother food can be taken. Milk in one stage of normal digestion gets into\r\nthe form of tough curds ready for the press, and curds should always be\r\nthoroughly masticated before swallowing.\r\n\r\nSir William Roberts, of England, in his exhaustive work on _Digestion\r\nand Diet_, asserts that milk-curds are not digested in the stomach\r\nduring sickness, but are forced into the duodenum, where, he asserts,\r\nthey are digested, but he gives no reason for his faith that there is\r\npower to digest in the duodenum where there is none in the stomach.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to make the mothers in the homes understand that\r\ntaking milk by the drink was equivalent to swallowing green cheese-curds\r\nwithout due mastication.\r\n\r\nWith these hygienic conceptions and methods I continued to visit the\r\nsick as a mere witness of Nature's power in disease rather than as an\r\ninvestigator, yet without being able to understand the secret of the\r\nsupport of vital power without food. But whatever risk there might be,\r\nor how strong my faith when my patrons were the subjects of what might\r\nbe called foolhardy experiments, there came a time when this faith was\r\nto have the severest of all tests.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic of diphtheria broke out among my nearest neighbors, and\r\nafter four deaths in as many families within a stone's throw of my\r\nresidence a son of mine aged three years was taken. I had never given\r\nhim in all his life even a cross look, and whatever sin there was in\r\nmaking idols of children in this I was the worst of all sinners, and I\r\ndid not quite believe, as some Christian folks would have me, that my\r\nhappiness through him was not the very incense of gratitude to the great\r\nAuthor for the gift of such a treasure of the heart.\r\n\r\nIn my hour of trial two of my ablest and most experienced medical\r\nfriends came to me. Quinine and iron in solution were their verdict--and\r\nthe little throat was not copper-lined; and, in addition, all the strong\r\nwhiskey possible to force into the stomach: all this would have required\r\nmanacled wrists and the prying apart of set jaws. He had never received\r\nanything from me more violent than caresses, and this abomination of\r\ndosage was to be sent down a bleeding, ulcerated way, over raw surfaces\r\nthat would writhe and quiver under the added torture. This would not be\r\nrational treatment for ulcerations on the body, and the loss of strength\r\nthrough resistance and structural injury to the throat had no promise of\r\nredemption except in the minds of my medical friends.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I left home without getting the prescription filled,\r\nand, not getting back as soon as expected, the anxious wife procured the\r\nmedicines and succeeded in getting one dose into the stomach, and also\r\nin raising a nervous hurricane that took an hour to allay. She was then\r\ninformed that such a dose would be cruel even to a horse. Thence on he\r\ntook nothing into his stomach but the water that thirst compelled, and a\r\nlittle dosage with it to meet the mother's need; and so I stood beside\r\nthe suffering idol of my heart, with the entire medical world against\r\nme--strong enough, only rejoicing in my strength to defend him against\r\nthe barbarism of authorized treatment. My only comfort was that in his\r\ntime of supreme need I could give him supreme kindness, and if death\r\nmust come there would not be the additional laceration of avoidable\r\ncruelty inflicted; and Nature, with every possible aid that could add\r\ncomfort to the suffering body, won the victory.\r\n\r\nSince then the medical world has advanced to antitoxin as a specific,\r\nleaving me nearly alone to plodding ways that are by sight and not by\r\nfaith. That the treatment of my sick son in the absence of the only\r\nsupposed specific was in advance of my time, the medical world cannot\r\nnow question.\r\n\r\nAs the months and years went on, it so happened that all my fatalities\r\nwere of a character as not to involve in the least suggestions of\r\nstarvation, while the recoveries were a series of demonstrations as\r\nclear as anything in mathematics, of evolving strength of all the\r\nmuscles, of all the senses and faculties, as the disease declined. No\r\nphysician whose practice has been extensive has failed to have had cases\r\nin which the same changes occurred, and in which the amount of food\r\ntaken did not explain this general increase of strength.\r\n\r\nBelieving I had made a most important discovery in physiology, one that\r\nwould revolutionize the dietetic treatment of the sick, if not\r\nultimately abolish it, my visits to the sick became of unsurpassed\r\ninterest, I watched every possible change as an unfolding of new life,\r\nseeing the physical changes only as I would see the swelling buds evolve\r\ninto the leaves or flowers, reading the soul- and mind-changes in the\r\nmore radiant lines of expression.\r\n\r\nI saw all these things with the naked eye, and more and more marvelled\r\nat the bulk of our materia medicas, the size of our drug-stores, and the\r\nspace given to healing powers in all public and medical prints.\r\n\r\nFor years I saw my patients grow into the strength of health without the\r\nslightest clue to the mystery, until I chanced to open a new edition of\r\nYeo's _Physiology_ at the page where I found this table of the estimated\r\nlosses that occur in death after starvation:\r\n\r\n    Fat             97 per cent.\r\n    Muscle          30    \"\r\n    Liver           56    \"\r\n    Spleen          63    \"\r\n    Blood           17    \"\r\n    Nerve-centres    0\r\n\r\nAnd light came as if the sun had suddenly appeared in the zenith at\r\nmidnight. Instantly I saw in human bodies a vast reserve of predigested\r\nfood, with the brain in possession of power so to absorb as to maintain\r\nstructural integrity in the absence of food or power to digest it. This\r\neliminated the brain entirely as an organ that needs to be fed or that\r\ncan be fed from light-diet kitchens in times of acute sickness. Only in\r\nthis self-feeding power of the brain is found the explanation of its\r\nfunctional clearness where bodies have become skeletons.\r\n\r\nI could now go into the rooms of the sick with a formula that explained\r\nall the mysteries of the maintenance and support of vital power and cure\r\nof disease, and that was of practical avail. I now knew that there could\r\nbe no death from starvation until the body was reduced to the skeleton\r\ncondition; that therefore for structural integrity, for functional\r\nclearness, the brain has no need of food when disease has abolished the\r\ndesire for it. Is there any other way to explain the power to make wills\r\nwith whispering lips in the very hour of death, even in the last moments\r\nof life, that the law recognizes as valid?\r\n\r\nI could now know that to die of starvation is a matter not of days, but\r\nof weeks and months; certainly a period far beyond the average time of\r\nrecovery from acute disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere fell to my care a very much worn-out mother, who took to her bed\r\nwith an attack of inflammatory rheumatism, with the joints so involved\r\nas to require the handling of a trained nurse. The agony was such that\r\nthe hypodermic needle was required to make existence endurable, and it\r\nwas used with the idea that the brain would be less injured by the\r\nremedy than by the agony with its inevitable loss of sleep.\r\n\r\nI know of no disease in which treatment has been more savage than in\r\nthis. The remedies in common use at that time were mainly new and of\r\nsupposed specific powers; but they were so violent, and proved to be so\r\nfutile, that they have all been given up since by the majority of the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nAs the days went on the disease declined in spite of the enforced\r\ncomfort through the needle; there were easier movements, a clearing of\r\nthe skin from sallow to a tint of redness, and finally, after a month,\r\nthe armchair could be used for a change.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the forty-sixth day there was revealed in the face the\r\nperfect color of health, and happiness marked every line of the\r\nexpression. There was ability to walk through several rooms of her home.\r\nBut it was not until the afternoon that the first food was desired and\r\ntaken, and never before was plain bread and butter, the supreme objects\r\nof desire, so relished. In the following few months there was an actual\r\ngain of forty pounds.\r\n\r\nMy next marked case is a wonderful illustration of the self-feeding\r\npower of the brain to meet an emergency, and a revelation, also, of the\r\npossible limitations of the starvation period. This was the case of a\r\nfrail, spare boy of four years, whose stomach was so disorganized by a\r\ndrink of solution of caustic potash that not even a swallow of water\r\ncould be retained. He died on the seventy-fifth day of his fast, with\r\nthe mind clear to the last hour, and with apparently nothing of the body\r\nleft but bones, ligaments, and a thin skin; and yet the brain had lost\r\nneither weight nor functional clearness.\r\n\r\nIn another city a similar accident happened to a child of about the same\r\nage, in whom it took three months for the brain to exhaust entirely the\r\navailable body-food.\r\n\r\nI will now enter upon a study of the brain and its powers along these\r\nlines, to be enlivened by illustrative evidence. What reason and\r\nphysiology had I with me that I should use methods in the sick-room\r\nwherein the entire medical world was against me, and with severest\r\ncondemnation?\r\n\r\nThe head is the power-house of the human plant, with the brain the\r\ndynamo as the source of every possible human energy. We think, love,\r\nhate, admire, labor with our hands, taste, hear, smell, see, and feel\r\nthrough the brain. Broken bones and wounds heal, diseases are cured\r\nthrough energy evolved in the brain or the brain system as a whole. The\r\nother so-called vital organs and the muscles are only as so many\r\nmachines that are run by the brain power, with the stomach an\r\nexceedingly important machine. That powers so rare do not originate in\r\nthe bones, ligaments, muscles, or fats, does not need argument; that\r\nwhen the nerve-trunks that supply the arm or leg are severed power of\r\nmovement and feeling is lost, is known to all; and equally would the\r\npower of the stomach be abolished were the nerve-trunks cut off. In a\r\ngeneral way, then, it may be stated that the strength of the body is\r\ndirectly as the strength of the brain.\r\n\r\nWith this physiology, who in or out of the medical profession can fail\r\nto see clearly that the digestion of even an atom of food is a tax upon\r\nthe strength of the brain for whatever of power needed by the stomach,\r\nthe machine, for this purpose? Unless it can be proved that the stomach\r\nhas powers not derived from the brain system, this will have to be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nHow is the strength kept up in the light of this physiology? The\r\nuniversal belief is that it is kept up by the daily food. In proportion\r\nto the prostration of sickness, so are physicians anxious to conserve\r\nthe energies by working the stomach to the limit of its powers.\r\n\r\nThe impression that there must be something digested to support the\r\nvitality of the system is a belief, a conviction that has always been\r\ntoo self-evident to suggest a doubt.\r\n\r\nIf the well need food to keep up the strength, the sick need it all the\r\nmore; this is the logic that has been displayed upon this question. Let\r\nus keep it clear in mind that, if the nerves going to the stomach are\r\nsevered, paralysis will result as in the case of the arm, in order more\r\ndefinitely to conceive the stomach as a _machine_ that requires power to\r\nrun it even to a tiringout degree. This is strikingly illustrated by the\r\nexhausted feeling that invites the after-dinner nap for rest, which,\r\nhowever, does not rest overfilled stomachs, overfilled brains. The brain\r\ngets no rest while getting rid of food-masses with more of decomposition\r\nthan of digestion.\r\n\r\nIf food really has power to keep up the strength, there should not be so\r\nmuch strength lost by the general activities--indeed, it would seem that\r\nfatigue should be impossible. But the fact remains that from the first\r\nwink in the morning to the last at night there is a gradual decline of\r\nstrength no matter how much food is taken, nor how ample the powers of\r\ndigestion; and that there comes a time with all when they must go to\r\nbed, and not to the dining-room, to recover lost strength. The loss of a\r\nnight of sleep is never made up by any kind of care in eating on the\r\nfollowing day, and none are so stupid as not to know that rest is the\r\nonly means to recover from the exhaustion of excessive physical\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe brain is not only a self-feeding organ when necessary, but it is\r\nalso a self-charging dynamo, regaining its exhausted energies entirely\r\nthrough rest and sleep. There is no movement so light, no thought or\r\nmotion so trivial, that it does not cost brain power in its action--and\r\nthis is true of even the slightest exercise of energy evolved in\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, do we eat?\r\n\r\nFor two reasons, or perhaps three: we eat because we are hungry. We\r\nrarely fail to eat excessively to satisfy the sense of relish after the\r\nnormal hunger sense has been dissipated; we may eat to satisfy relish as\r\nwe eat ice cream, fruits, and the enticing extras that beguile us to put\r\nmore food into the stomach after it is already overfilled for its\r\nworking capacity. But our actual need of food, the best reason for\r\ntaking it, is to make up for the wastes from the general activities; and\r\nthis is a process in the order of Nature that actually tires the entire\r\nbrain system, or, in the common phrase, the whole body, unless the\r\nstomach has powers not derived from the brain system.\r\n\r\nNow as we need not, cannot feed the brain in time of sickness, what can\r\nwe feed? In all diseases in which there are a high pulse and\r\ntemperature, pain or discomfort, aversion to food, a foul, dry mouth and\r\ntongue, thirst, etc., wasting of the body goes on, no matter what the\r\nfeeding, until a clean, moist tongue and mouth and hunger mark the close\r\nof the disease, when food can be taken with relish and digested. This\r\nmakes it clearly evident that we cannot save the muscles and fat by\r\nfeeding under these adverse conditions.\r\n\r\nAnother very important, unquestioned fact is that disease in proportion\r\nto its severity means a loss of digestive conditions and of digestive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nCheer is to digestion what the breeze is to the fire. It may well be\r\nconceived that there are electric nerve wires extending from the depths\r\nof the soul itself to each individual gland of the stomach, with the\r\nhighest cheer or ecstacy to stimulate the highest functional activity,\r\nor the shock of bad news to paralyze. From cheer to despair, from the\r\nslightest sense of discomfort to the agony of lacerated nerves,\r\ndigestive power goes down. Affected thus, digestive power wanes or\r\nincreases, goes down or up, as mercury in a barometer from weather\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nDigestive conditions in their maximum are revealed in the school-yard\r\nduring recess, when Nature seems busy recovering lost time.\r\n\r\nHow compares the ramble of a June morning, with the blue and sunshine\r\nall above, the matchless green of the trees, and all the air fragrant\r\nwith the perfume of flowers and alive with music from the winged singer,\r\nin digestive conditions, with those in the rooms of the sick, where\r\nthere is only distress felt in the body and seen in the faces of the\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nIn time of health, if we eat when we are not hungry, or when very tired,\r\nor in any mental worriment, we find that we suffer a loss of vital\r\npower, of both physical and mental energy. How, then, can food be a\r\nsupport to vital power when the brain is more gravely depressed by\r\ndisease? Yet from the morning of medical history the question of how\r\nvital power is supported in time of sickness has never been considered,\r\nbecause there has never been any doubt as to the support coming from\r\nfood. I assume this to be a fact, since all works on the practice of\r\nmedicine of to-day enjoin the need to feed the sick to sustain their\r\ndepressed energies--all this without a question as to whether there is\r\nnot a possibility of adding indigestion to disease when food is enforced\r\nagainst Nature's fiat.\r\n\r\nSince vital power is centred in the brain, do we need to feed, can we\r\nfeed, for other than brain reasons? This physiology admitted, there is\r\nno other conclusion possible than that feeding the sick is a tax on\r\nvital power when we need all that power to cure disease.\r\n\r\nWith all this physiology behind me, for more than a score of years I\r\nhave been going into the rooms of the sick to see the evolutions of\r\nhealth from disease, as I see the evolutions from the dead wastes of\r\nMarch to the affluence of June, and from the first I had the exceeding\r\nadvantage of being able to study the natural history of disease, a\r\nhistory in which none of the symptoms were aggravated by digestive\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nAs there was no wasting of vital power in the hopeless effort to save\r\nthe body from wasting, I had a clear right to presume that my patients\r\nrecovered more rapidly and with less suffering. With no perplexing\r\nstudy over what foods and what medicines to give, I could devote my\r\nentire attention to the study of symptoms as evidences of progress\r\ntoward recovery or death; and in addition to all this there was the\r\ngreat satisfaction of being strictly in line with Nature as to when and\r\nwhat to eat.\r\n\r\nAs to the danger of death from mere starvation, the following remarkable\r\ncase reveals how remote it is in the ordinary history of acute diseases.\r\nThe late Rev. Dr. Merchant, of Meadville, Pa., a short time before his\r\ndeath, which occurred some months ago, informed me that a brother\r\nentered the army during the War of the Rebellion with a weight of one\r\nhundred and fifty-nine pounds. He was sent home so wasted from\r\nulceration of stomach and bowels that he actually spanned his thigh with\r\nthumb and finger. He lived ten days only, to astonish all by the\r\nclearness of his mind even on the last day of his life, when he could\r\nthink on abstruse questions as he had never been known to do in health.\r\nAt death his body weighed only sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Merchant's opinion, from a history of the case, that no food\r\nwas digested during the last four months of his life; but it is my\r\nopinion that it took a much longer time than this for the brain to\r\nabsorb more than ninety pounds of the body. That life was shortened by\r\nthe more rapid loss of the tissues from the disease is to be taken into\r\naccount in estimating time in starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding the sick! Who that rule in kitchens and feed the well do not\r\nrealize with weariness of brain the demands of the stomach that at each\r\nmeal there shall be some change in the bill of fare?\r\n\r\nThe chief reliance of physicians for the maintenance of strength while\r\nsick bodies are being cured is milk. As a food, milk was mainly destined\r\nfor the calf, and not for man--certainly not after the coming of the\r\nmolars. It is not a food that will start the saliva in case of hunger,\r\nas the odors from the frying-pan or from roasting fowl, yet because it\r\nplays such an important part as a complete food for some months in the\r\nlife of the calf, and because it can be taken without especial aversion\r\nwhen the odors of the cooking-stove are an offence to the nostrils; it\r\nis given by the hour, day after day, and in some cases week after week;\r\nand there are physicians by the thousands who reinforce this inflexible\r\nbill of fare by the strongest alcoholics, whiskey being generally\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I shall say of alcoholics that they contain not an\r\natom that can be converted into living atoms; they congest and irritate\r\nthe stomach, and hence lessen digestive power; and benumb all the brain\r\npowers and faculties.\r\n\r\nAs a daily ration without change, this combination, strictly adhered to,\r\nwould prostrate the energies of a giant, and he would find himself\r\nmustered out of all active service in less time than the hapless sick\r\nare often compelled to endure such feeding. Does Nature so conveniently\r\nreverse herself to meet an emergency that the sick can be built up and\r\nsustained by such feeding as would debilitate the well?\r\n\r\nIn the city where I live the physicians average well in learning,\r\nability, character, and experience. Among them are the extremists in\r\ndosage: those with a hundred remedies for a hundred symptoms; others\r\nwith such boluses as would writhe the face of an ox. There are some with\r\nextraordinary force of command in the rooms of the sick, who believe\r\nthat whiskey is nourishing and that milk is liquid food; that doses go\r\ninto human stomachs to travel the rounds of the circulation, and finally\r\ndrop off at the right place for either patchwork or original work.\r\n\r\nWhatever there is in drugs to cure disease, whatever in milk and the\r\nstrongest alcoholics to sustain the strength, every protracted case has\r\nbeen made to reveal in their forceful hands. I have no reason to believe\r\nthey exceeded authorized treatments. I have no reason to doubt that in\r\nall countries, in all lands, where there are educated physicians, the\r\nsame appliances are in common use, appliances that will make the next\r\nshort step from the lancet and bolus of a darker age the estimate of the\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\nThe treatments of the sick are always changing, while the process of\r\ncure remains the same. Only in the case of broken bones are we compelled\r\nto let Nature do all the curing, while we may take pride in some\r\nprogress in the mechanical appliances.\r\n\r\nAs milk and stimulants are a common, authorized means to sustain the\r\nsick, and as they are poured into human stomachs with all the faith with\r\nwhich lancets were once forced into congested veins, their efficiency\r\nfor good or evil must be studied by comparison.\r\n\r\nTreatments must lessen both the severity and the duration of disease to\r\nbe of permanent benefit. For a study by comparison, this opportunity\r\ncame to me. There was a call to attend a case of typhoid fever in a\r\nyoung girl. In the same vicinity there had been under the care of one of\r\nmy forceful brethren a woman in middle life, whose stomach was\r\nhabitually rejecting all the milk and alcoholics poured into it, the\r\ndoctor having a theory that good would result no matter how brief the\r\ntime they were retained.\r\n\r\nFor a month my patient swallowed only the desired water and doses which\r\ndid not corrode, a desire for food coming at the end of the month. The\r\nonly day and night nurse was an overwrought mother, who got into bed\r\nwith the same disease as soon as the daughter got out of it. There was\r\nanother month of severer sickness, when without food and without the\r\nhorror of dosage, as before, the call for food marked the close of the\r\ndisease. My services ended here some days before the undertaker took\r\ncharge of the doctor's case.\r\n\r\nA girl in her later teens, with a mild, so-called malarial fever, fell\r\ninto the same forceful care. There was a true history in this case of\r\nnearly two gallons of whiskey, and daily milk from the quart at first\r\ndown to inability to take the least nourishment at last. Then there were\r\nmore than a month of days when vital power sustained itself without the\r\nways of violence, death occurring during the _nineteenth week_.\r\n\r\nThe ravenous brain had absorbed the lips to such thinness that the\r\ndepressions between the teeth were clearly revealed. From the first dose\r\nto the last breath this was a case of dying, and the most persistent\r\nfight for life against immense odds I have ever become aware of in an\r\nacute case. In this case the stomach had become so seared by the\r\nalcoholic that digestion was impossible, as would have been the case in\r\na body that was not sick.\r\n\r\nNear this home there was a more delicate girl of about the same age\r\ntaken with the same fever; but with mild dosage and no food--in Nature's\r\ncare--hunger came at the close of the fourth week.\r\n\r\nLater on in the same family there was a case of la grippe, in which for\r\nseveral years there had been chronic, ulcerative bronchitis that bid\r\ndefiance to blisters and inhalations, the various specifics of another\r\nforceful predecessor, who also was a believer in large doses and full\r\nrations of alcoholized milk.\r\n\r\nThe coughing was so persistent, so continuous, that only the hypodermic\r\nneedle met the need. To prevent the tearing of a raw surface in the\r\nbronchial tubes by the cough was as necessary as to apply splints to a\r\nbroken bone. There was no food for six weeks, and Nature made most of\r\nher opportunity, not only to cure the acute disease, but also the\r\nchronic disease, which for nearly ten years since has remained cured.\r\n\r\nI was summoned to Asheville, N. C., to see a young man in the last stage\r\nof consumption. I found him nearly a skeleton, though he had been eating\r\nsix times daily for several months by the decree of a really learned\r\nphysician. The belchings from gas were loud and frequent; the sputa by\r\nactual measure was about six ounces during every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nA fast was ordered, and on the third day a mass of undigested food was\r\nthrown up. As soon as the stomach and bowels became empty there was\r\ncomfort all along the line, and the cough was so diminished, that less\r\nthan an ounce of sputa was raised in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of fasting there came a natural desire for food, and thence\r\non he enjoyed without distress of stomach all he wished to take. Thence\r\non he lived with only the least discomfort, and with whispering lips he\r\ndictated to me his will, conveying large property. He could look with\r\nmeaning when the power to whisper was gone, and life ended as the going\r\nout of a candle.\r\n\r\nFor months his sufferings had nearly all been due to food masses in a\r\nstate of decomposition. He saw clearly and mentioned often that his had\r\nbeen a case of starvation from overfeeding. Nature finally had to\r\nsuccumb because she was not also able to deal with a clearly avoidable\r\ndisease, indigestion; but she kept up a brave fight until the body was\r\nnearly absorbed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the stomach and bowels became empty the friends noticed that\r\nnervousness largely disappeared. His sleeps were much longer, because\r\nnot broken by coughing as before; and as the brain was not taxed with\r\nfood masses there was an accumulation of power that was clearly revealed\r\nin the cheer of expression and a calmness as if heavenly rest had come\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nA few years ago an attorney in this city had to endure a course of fever\r\nto which was added all the known barbarism of the times. Under enforced\r\nfood and stimulants his mind at last became so weak that the dosings\r\nwere forced down his throat. There were many weeks of life at lowest ebb\r\nbefore the man of torture (the doctor) was compelled to discontinue his\r\nevil work, and there were then months, extending to years, during which\r\nthere appeared a colorless ghost of his former self on the streets--and\r\nthis in spite of a wood-chopper's daily eatings, which were far in\r\nexcess of power to digest.\r\n\r\nAt last he was brought to his couch with a mild fever complicated with a\r\nvariety of other ailings. Not one of his friends who knew him\r\nintimately expected his recovery, as it was believed by them that there\r\nwere chronic conditions that were beyond cure, and this because there\r\nhad been death in manner, movements, and looks for months. And yet he\r\nhad been able to take a stomach to his office every morning for many\r\nweeks filled with pancakes, sausage, fried potatoes, etc., only to\r\nshiver before the stove between his stomach-fillings.\r\n\r\nTo this possibly hopeless case I was called, and from that time he was\r\nto suffer only from the disease. For nearly three weeks no food was\r\ncalled for; and yet power so increased that he became able to dress\r\nhimself; and on the morning before hunger finally called for food he\r\ncame down from his bedroom with a son on his back who weighed not less\r\nthan seventy-five pounds. Thence on, life, color, mind, muscle, rapidly\r\ncame until there was such regeneration as to reveal a new body and a new\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nSome years before this event an only son was taken sick with a mild\r\nfever. A young physician and friend of the patient was called whose\r\nfaith in drugs, milk, and whiskey was boundless. He was fresh from his\r\nuniversity, and therefore Nature had no part, through experience at the\r\nsick-bed, in the cure of disease. For many weeks these remedies of\r\ntorture were vigorously and persistently enforced. But the time came\r\nwhen Nature would bear no longer. The father, a personal friend, came to\r\nsee me simply to unburden himself, and as he was not able to give me the\r\ncase I was unprofessional enough to advise that the attendance should\r\ngo on, but that there should be a complete rest the physician should not\r\nknow of. This was done, and in a few days there was a call for food, the\r\nfirst call in more than two months. Of course, there was a recovery,\r\nwhich was an exceeding victory for Nature against extraordinarily\r\nadverse conditions, but it required many months to restore the wrecked\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nAs I write this experience the following comes to me as a still stronger\r\nindictment against authorized medical method. A. B., when in the early\r\nmaturity of his physical manhood, was stricken with a partial paralysis\r\nthat sent him to his bed. It was simply the case of a wound of the brain\r\nrequiring rest as the chief condition for cure. But milk, whiskey, and\r\ndrugs were used with the greatest persistence, and after three months he\r\nbecame able to be about, no less feeble in mind than in body, and with\r\nteeth utterly ruined by the dosage. For fully five years he went about\r\nhis home and along the streets as one in a dream. For ten years there\r\nwas inability to attend to his ordinary business. Life came at last\r\nthrough the no-breakfast plan.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fight for life on the part of Nature against the\r\nadverse conditions of drugs, alcoholics, and milk I have ever known was\r\nin the following case: A spare woman, of perhaps forty years, came to\r\nher bed the victim of habitual bromidia and chloral, invited by severe\r\nheadaches. The treatment of this case was as follows: whiskey every\r\nhour, milk every other hour; corrosive medication and powerful brain\r\nsedative every night, which would have paralyzed digestive energy for\r\nmany days. There was not an hour during the twenty-four in which there\r\nwas not dosing either to cure the disease or to sustain the system. The\r\naverage quantity of whiskey was six ounces daily, and of milk nearly a\r\nquart. This treatment was borne for weeks, merging into months. There\r\nwas no disease not caused by the treatments, and the battle went on\r\nuntil there was only the shadow of a woman left when Nature rebelled\r\nagainst further violence. A few days of peace were granted because hope\r\nhad departed; but it took Nature more than a year to recover from the\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nA man of iron and steel, in the early prime of life, was the victim of a\r\nsevere injury. With the agony of lacerated nerves and the hypodermic\r\nneedle to make the digestion of food impossible, milk and whiskey were\r\npoured into an unwilling stomach from the first, and both were used\r\nuntil neither could be retained; and then the lower bowel was\r\nextemporized into a stomach. For one hundred and forty-six days, from\r\nthree to seven doses of morphine were put into the arm daily; and\r\nmorphine dries both mouth and stomach and lessens all energies of the\r\nbrain. The body itself was not sick; there was no hint of disease in it;\r\nyet there were drugs prescribed that cost dollars by the score, and\r\nthere were alcoholics by the gallon. For months the pain, alcoholics,\r\nand morphine kept the mind in such a daze that there were only the\r\nimbecilic mutterings of a dreamer in trouble.\r\n\r\nThe only treatment indicated in this case was the best of surgery for\r\nthe injury, and some easing doses for a short while at first, to relieve\r\npain. No food would be desired or digested; so the fast would go on\r\nuntil there would be a natural hunger, which would only manifest itself\r\nwhen there would be marked relief from pain. The meals, thence on, would\r\nbe so far apart that all would be keenly relished; and there could be no\r\nloss of weight when meals would be so taken.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising when I say that a seared stomach and a brain\r\nconverted into a whiskey pickle had no part in the digestion of milk:\r\nelse why did the weight of one hundred and sixty pounds at the time of\r\nthe accident fall to eighty-five at the time of hunger? And all this\r\ndrugging and alcoholics for a man who was not really sick! and the bill\r\nof fare that was not changed during one hundred and sixty days! and the\r\ntime lost, and the expense entailed, and the anxious, aching hearts that\r\nwere nearest the bed of horrors--of horrors, torments clearly invited.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast the following case is given. During vacation a lad of\r\ntwelve years of one of my families took to his bed with appendicitis in\r\nsevere form. A learned physician was called, and there were many days of\r\nmorphine, with other medication and all the food that could be coaxed\r\ninto an unwilling stomach. Enough morphine was given daily to paralyze\r\ndigestive energy for at least two or three days in one in ordinary\r\nhealth. There was a month of this war against Nature, when the violence\r\nof the acute attack subsided and a partial victory was gained against\r\ngreat odds.\r\n\r\nOn my return I found him under heavy dosage for the recovery of strength\r\nand lost appetite. Colorless, anaemic, languid--he was barely able to\r\nwalk. He was immediately put under my care, and therefore under a fast\r\nthat ended in a few days in such hunger as had not been felt in several\r\nmonths; and color, cheer, energy, weight evolved in a month. But there\r\nwas also a developing abscess deep in the groin, and the time came when\r\na grave operation was necessary to save life. He was made ready for the\r\nsurgeon's knife that cut its way down, down many inches to relieve walls\r\nready to burst from the tension. The wound remained in the care of the\r\nsurgeon, but the life in my care. Who deny that the anaesthetic, the\r\nshock of the operation, and the subsequent pain will not abolish all\r\npower to digest as well as all the desire for food? Here was a patient\r\nwaiting for Nature to rally, which she did on the third day in a call\r\nfor food; and thence on one daily meal was keenly relished, and the\r\nwound was healed--a wound that was three inches long on the surface and\r\nsix inches deep. On the fifteenth day the lad was able to be dressed and\r\nable to walk about his room, and with a freshness of color that was\r\nnever observed in him before. What law of body was violated in the\r\npreliminary treatment intended to prepare Nature for the ordeal and to\r\nenable her to rally from it?\r\n\r\nThis fresh tragedy in one human life has become known to me while I\r\nwrite. A man, a giant, in his eighty-eighth year, lost his appetite, and\r\nwas put to death by the following means: A pint of whiskey and from one\r\nto two quarts of milk daily to keep him nourished. Five months passed\r\nwithout any change in the bill of fare--five months of delirium, of\r\nimbecilic muttering before the last breath was drawn. These tragedies\r\nare common the world over. Do I cry against them with too loud a voice?\r\nWould that I had a voice of thunder!\r\n\r\nI have given a few examples of the crucifixions of the sick and the\r\nafflicted, whereof I have many, and they are the real history of cases\r\nknown, and are constantly occurring in every community.\r\n\r\nThe cure of disease and injury by fasting--the mode of Nature--made the\r\ngreatest impression in families in which there was intelligence enough\r\nto comprehend it; but the victories of Nature were complicated by cases\r\nin which death was inevitable. With a feeling that I must give the new\r\nhygiene to the world in printed form, I did not enlarge in public over a\r\nmethod that would be certain to be suggestive of starvation, where food\r\nwas supposed to be of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nMy sick-room success failed to enable me to draw larger checks; but the\r\nsatisfaction of going into the rooms of the sick and not having to rack\r\nmy mind over what medicine to give, what food to be taken, was a great\r\ncompensation for the absence of a large bank account. Professional\r\nattainments and abilities play only a small part in the mere business\r\nside of the medical profession. An innocent public believes with intense\r\nconvictions in the efficacy of dosage; and with distorted vision, as the\r\nfamous knight of La Mancha, sees giants in professional healers who are\r\nreally only windmills, with whom personal contact in the sick-room is\r\nonly too often a danger measured by its closeness.\r\n\r\nThink of the wasting of the body during sickness; of the brain system,\r\nwhich is life itself, that does not waste: think of the cases of\r\nrecovery in which for weeks no food is possible for stomach reasons; of\r\nthe more frequent cases in which recoveries take place after weeks of\r\nsuch scant food as not to be taken into account as a support to vital\r\npower by minds governed by reason. Think how disease, in proportion to\r\nits severity, is a loss of digestive power, and with cure energy\r\nentirely of the brain, how serious a matter it is to lessen it by waste\r\nof energy in forcing decomposing food masses through a digestive channel\r\nnearly two rods long, food masses that the brain will have none of, and\r\nthat do not save the fat and muscles; think of all this physiology, and\r\nraise this question: \"Is this man alone in his faith and practice, or\r\nis Nature so in line with him that the entire medical profession is\r\nwrong in their dosings and feedings?\"\r\n\r\nI conclude these cases with an illustration. Think of all this enforced\r\nfeeding, of the doses to relieve, of the wasting of brain power, and\r\ncompare with the following illustration, in which case no food was taken\r\nfor thirty-six days, and yet it was possible for the patient to be about\r\nduring the greater part of the time.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--In this case severe indigestion and nervous troubles and\r\n    almost daily headaches had been a torture for years. On the\r\n    morning of the thirty-sixth day, on which the photograph was\r\n    taken, a visit to the dentist for the extraction of a tooth\r\n    revealed no fear, as had formerly been the case. Eating was\r\n    resumed on the thirty-eighth day with no inconvenience. Since\r\n    then (over six months ago) no trace of the former troubles has\r\n    reappeared. Loss of weight about twenty pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph, by Henry Ritter.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. M. LICHTENHAHN,\r\n\r\nTHIRTY-SIXTH DAY WITHOUT FOOD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Physician, heal thyself!\" There is a world of sarcasm in these three\r\nwords; for about the only advantage the physician has over the laity is\r\nthat he can do his own dosing. As a general fact, he does no more to\r\nprevent bodily ailings than other people, and is just as liable to\r\nbecome the victim of bad habits.\r\n\r\nIt is my impression that, in proportion, as many physicians become the\r\nslaves of tobacco, opium in some form, and alcoholics as are to be found\r\nin any other class of people; they are quite as likely to be the victims\r\nof various chronic ailings as other people, and with equal impotency to\r\nrelieve. Every day I see physicians going to the homes of the sick with\r\ncigars on fire, signals of the brain system in distress undergoing the\r\nlullaby of nicotine; going into rooms where the purest air of heaven\r\nought to prevail, as animated tobacco-signs.\r\n\r\nWhere is there virtue in this world that is of any practical good whose\r\nvital force is not to be found in example rather than in precept? Who\r\nhas more need to go into the room of the sick with the purest breath,\r\nthe cleanest tongue, the brightest eyes, the purest complexion, the most\r\nradiant countenance, and with a soul free from the bonds of ailings or\r\nhabits that offend and disable, than the physician? Where is the logic\r\nof employing the sick to feed the sick? Is not that a sick doctor whose\r\nnerves are so full of plaints as to need the frequent soothings only\r\nfound in a cigar, that also sears the nerves of taste? Is he not very\r\nsick when those nerves require the stronger alcoholic?\r\n\r\nThere is contagion in good health and sound morals, when daily\r\nillustrated, no less than in courage and fear. No physician can be at\r\nhis best in the rooms of the sick if he be under any bondage from\r\ndisease or habit.\r\n\r\n\"Physician, heal thyself!\" Physician, how does it happen that you have\r\nneed to be healed, and of what worth are you if you can neither prevent\r\ndisease nor cure yourself with your dosings? What availeth it to a man\r\nto talk righteously when virtue is not in him?\r\n\r\nAilings, habits blunt all the special senses and the finer instincts and\r\ntastes, and impair the power to reason clearly, to infer correctly, to\r\nconclude wisely. Only the well have that hopefulness that comes from\r\npower in reserve, power that is not wasted through acquired disease and\r\nacquired habits. The contagion of health is a power no less than courage\r\nor fear.\r\n\r\nThat man, self-poised, void of fear, General Grant, crushed the\r\nRebellion with a single sentence, \"I will fight it out on this line if\r\nit takes all summer.\" That sentence made every man in his army a Grant\r\nin courage and confidence. Grant in his prime could puff his cigar while\r\ncommanding all the armies of his country; but the cigar ultimately\r\ndestroyed his life, and there was no physician to interpose to prevent\r\none of the most torturing of deaths.\r\n\r\nWhere is the logic of the sick trying to heal the sick? This question\r\nwill be more frequently asked in that time to come when the drug-store\r\nannex to the sick-room will be much smaller than is now thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHuman expression is studied in the rooms of the sick as nowhere else;\r\nand if the lines are not obscured by the fogs and clouds of disease the\r\nsigns can be much more clearly distinguished.\r\n\r\nA man is now under my care whose soul is of the largest mould, and who\r\nis so supremely endowed by reason of intellect, varied tastes and\r\nacquirements, as to make life on earth well worth living. His long\r\nchronic local ailment has not impaired his power to read me for signs of\r\nhope as it seems to me I have never been read before; and never before\r\nhave I so felt the need to enter a room of the sick with a larger stock\r\nof general health. For the time I seem to him to be holding before his\r\neyes the keys of life or death.\r\n\r\nThe physician should be able to go into the room of the sick to see with\r\nclearest vision whatever is revealed to the natural eye; and no less to\r\nsee with eyes of understanding that he may be an interpreter of\r\nconditions that indicate recovery or death. He is the historian of\r\ndisease, and therefore before he can write he must see clearly all that\r\ncan be known about the process of cure as revealed by symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe eye is at its best only in perfect health no less than the reason,\r\nthe judgment, and the spirits. A few years ago a drouth of many weeks\r\noccurred; in some meadows and pastures the grass seemed dead, beyond the\r\npossibility of growth. Every shade of the green had departed; but warm\r\nrains came, and in a few days there was a green carpet plush-like in its\r\nsoftness and delicacy.\r\n\r\nSo the progress of cure may be read on the tongue, on the skin, in the\r\neyes, where there are both eyesight and insight to see and to study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years I entered the rooms of the sick a sick man myself; I was\r\nthe victim of that monster of hydraheads, dyspepsia, or, to call it by a\r\nmore modern title, indigestion.\r\n\r\nIn my later teens my stomach began seriously to complain over its tasks,\r\nand a pint of the essence of bitterness was procured to restore it to\r\npower. My mouth was filled with teeth of the sweet kind; hence my horror\r\nfor the doses far exceeded the milder protests of the stomach. Not the\r\nslightest benefit came from my medicinal sufferings, and this ended all\r\nroutine treatment of my stomach. My intense aversion to the flavor of\r\nstrong medicines caused me to inflict them as rarely as possible upon\r\nother mouths during the drug period of my practice.\r\n\r\nMine seemed to be a weary stomach, in which the tired sense was a close\r\napproach to acute pain for hours after each meal. When a medical student\r\nI found nothing in the books, in the advice of my preceptor, nor in the\r\nlectures at the university, but what proposed to cure me through drugs\r\nthat were abhorrent. As I never encountered any cures nor received the\r\nslightest benefit from my experiments, I was deterred from injuring\r\nmyself through persistent dosage.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of my student career I was behind a drug-counter,\r\nwhere I had ample experience in putting up prescriptions, and had an\r\nexcellent opportunity to measure medical men as revealed in their\r\nformulas and the results in many cases in which failure was the rule in\r\nchronic ailings; and I was not encouraged to abuse myself through the\r\nresults as revealed by any form of medication.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who suffer from complainings of the stomach I\r\ngive a condensed summing-up of myself. I was born with a wiry\r\nconstitution, but of the lean kind, and a weak stomach, the chiefest\r\nancestral legacy. With ability to see with intense sense very much to\r\nenjoy in this world, my resources in this way were boundless, hence I\r\nwas always full of hope and cheer.\r\n\r\nAll the senses of my palate were of the acute kind, and so were a\r\ncontinual source of the penalties of gluttony. Whatever else there might\r\nbe alack with me, there was never a lack of appetite. I was able to eat\r\nat each meal food enough which, if fully digested, would have redeemed\r\nthe wastes of any day of labor; and not only this, but also enough of\r\nsugar-enticing foods to anticipate the wastes of the following day.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the country and with an intense fondness for the tart\r\nsweetness of apples, pears, and peaches, and the harmlessness of eating\r\nthem no matter how full the stomach with hearty food, without question\r\nmy stomach was never void of pomace during the entire fruit season.\r\n\r\nWhenever I sat down to eat there was an onrush of all the senses of the\r\npalate as the outrush of imprisoned children to the ecstatic activities\r\nof the school-yard; hence over-eating always, with never a sense of\r\nsatiety. The penalties were realized in painful digestion, with the\r\nduodenum the chiefest of protesting voices.\r\n\r\nA time came when gas would so accumulate as to make the heart labor from\r\nmere pressure, the inevitable insufficiency of breath causing a lack of\r\naeration of the blood. With a constant waste of power in the stomach\r\nthere was always a sense of weariness; hence I was never able to know\r\nthe luxury of power in reserve. All through life my best efforts were\r\nthe result of intellectual inebriation, with always corresponding\r\nexhaustion as the direct result. This weakness compelled me to waste the\r\nleast time on people who could not interest me, and to spend much time\r\nalone to recharge my exhausted batteries.\r\n\r\nFor such a case as mine there is not to-day to be found an intelligent\r\nhint in any medical text-book as to the physiological way to recovery.\r\n\r\nThe breakfasts in my house were of a character that, without ham,\r\nsausage, eggs, steaks, or chops, they would not have been considered\r\nworth spending time over. I had reached a time when a general collapse\r\nseemed to be impending; but it was stayed for a few years by the new\r\nlife that came to me through the evolutions of health in the rooms of\r\nthe sick that seemed to portend possible professional glories: but as\r\nthe years went on I suffered more and more from nervous prostration\r\nthrough waste of power in the stomach.\r\n\r\nMy friends began to enlarge upon my wretched looks, and with no little\r\nconcern; but none were wise enough to realize that my need was for words\r\nthat reminded of life and not of death.\r\n\r\nBy chance I met an old friend on the street when he happened to be\r\nthinking about ways in daily food in Europe, from which he had just\r\nreturned, and at once he began to talk, not about my wretched looks, but\r\nabout the exceedingly light breakfasts customary in all the great\r\ncentres where he had been. They consisted only of a roll and a cup of\r\ncoffee. I was impressed just enough not to forget the fact, but without\r\nthere being a hint in it to set me to thinking.\r\n\r\nBut the time came, \"the fulness of time.\" There came a morning when for\r\nthe first time I remembered that when in ordinary health I had no desire\r\nto breakfast; but there was a sense of such general exhaustion from\r\npower wasted over an unusual food mass not needed at the previous\r\nevening meal that my morning coffee was craved as the morning dram by\r\nthe chronic toper. Only this, and a forenoon resulted of such comfort of\r\nbody, such cheer, and such mental and physical energy as had never been\r\nrealized since my young manhood was happy in the blessed\r\nunconsciousness of having a stomach that, no matter how large or how\r\nnumerous the daily meals, never complained.\r\n\r\nAs for the dinner that followed, it was taken with an acuteness of\r\nrelish and was handled with a power of digestion that were also a new,\r\nrich experience; but the afternoon fell far short of the forenoon. The\r\nexperience was so remarkable that I at once gave up all eating in the\r\nmorning, and with such reviving effects upon all my powers that the\r\nresults began to be noticed by all friends.\r\n\r\nSo originated the no-breakfast plan. Up to this time I had never had a\r\nthought of advising anyone to do without food when desired; much less\r\nthat any of the three daily meals should be given up. My war was against\r\nfeeding when acute sickness had abolished all desire for food, and this\r\nI had been able to conduct many years without exciting suspicion of a\r\ngeneral practice of homicide.\r\n\r\nThe improvement in my own case was so instant and so marked that I began\r\nto advise the same to others, and with the result that each would make\r\nknown the redeeming work to suffering friends, and so the idea spread in\r\na friend-to-friend way.\r\n\r\nNow the American breakfast, in point of sheer necessity, is believed to\r\nbe the most important meal of the day, as the means for strength that is\r\nto be called out for the forenoon of labor, and believed with a force of\r\ninsistence that warrants a conclusion that a night of sleep is more\r\nexhausting to all the powers than the day of labor.\r\n\r\nTo go into the fresh air, to do anything with an empty stomach, is to\r\ninvite a fainting by the way, is the general impression; but there were\r\nscarcely any cases in which there was not sufficient improvement to\r\nprevent all possibility of a return to the heavy breakfasts that had\r\nbeen abandoned.\r\n\r\nHow did this scheme affect me in a professional way, that is, in the\r\nreputation as a physician of average balance of brain functions? Some of\r\nmy professional brethren of strong conviction and ready command of\r\nlanguage began at once to try to abolish the dangerous heresy by\r\nsuggesting that on this one subject I was absolutely crazy. Of course,\r\ntheir patrons took up this idea with avidity; and so there was a babble\r\nof tongues, with myself the central point of attack as crank-in-chief of\r\nall cranks. This is not the language of exaggeration; for whatever the\r\nlaw and modern civilization permitted to abolish me professionally was\r\ninflicted with tongues by the thousands, the war being made all the more\r\nexciting and interesting by the enthusiasm of new recruits to the heresy\r\nfrom the professional domains of my medical brethren.\r\n\r\nWhat did I gain by this professionally? Mostly the odium of heresy\r\nduring the first few years; but with it was the supreme satisfaction\r\nthat came from seeing more additions to bright eyes and happy faces than\r\nmedicine ever gave, and in a way that would redound to my own good at\r\nsome time. The fact is, that as a means to better health, no matter what\r\nnor where the disease, there is no limit to its application. As a\r\nuniversal panacea its powers are matchless.\r\n\r\nFor a time I saw no farther than a cure of stomach condition and\r\nresulting general comfort. That any disease was to be cured otherwhere\r\nthan in the stomach by means so simple, did not occur as an original\r\nconception; but the fact that giving up the morning meal was attended\r\nwith improvement of all local diseases set me to thinking. Many of my\r\npatients became thin under the regime; but as this was attended by an\r\nincrease of strength, not even the alarm of anxious friends without\r\nfaith was ever able to induce a return fully to the old ways.\r\n\r\nBut how explain the loss of weight? A clue came from the following case:\r\nThe first-born of a young mother had an habitual diarrhoea from birth\r\nlasting many months; and yet it seemed well nourished, for it was\r\nunusually fat and heavy for its age; but the days and nights were long\r\nin the care of this apparently well-nourished child. The symptoms were\r\nheedless to the every-hour dosing of pellets, or from the tumblers of\r\napparently purest water.\r\n\r\nNow this mother, young as she was, was a woman of convictions, and with\r\ncourage to follow each to an ultimate conclusion. She had heard of\r\nmiracles resulting from only three feedings per day during the nursing\r\nperiod; and so, notwithstanding a storm of opposition from a vast\r\ncircle of relatives, she put this first-born rigidly on the three-meal\r\nplan, with the result of immediate cessation of the bowel trouble, but\r\nwith rapid decline in weight.\r\n\r\nThis caused anxiety, and I was called upon for advice. In every respect\r\nexcept the weight-loss the improvement was wonderful. After much thought\r\nthere was a sudden flash of the truth: there were an abnormal weight and\r\nbulk, due to the general dropsy of debility, similar in character to the\r\nswelling of the feet and limbs in the old and feeble. The thickened\r\nwalls of the bloodvessels, toned with health, caused absorption; but the\r\neyes of the friends would not open to the miracle for a very long time,\r\nand so render justice to the heroine, the young mother. As an aider and\r\nabettor of such a flagrant system of starvation, I had my full share of\r\nopprobrium; but, aided by the strong-minded, sensible mother, Nature\r\ngained a sweeping victory, and thus this case cleared my mind from\r\nconfusion as to the anomaly.\r\n\r\nOne of my medical friends with whom calomel was as a sheet-anchor often\r\nasserted that babies would actually get fat on it. That bulk would\r\nactually increase by use of the forceful medicine is likely; but that\r\nthe increase would be dropsical I think is unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe dropsy of debility is due to a loss of tone of the vascular system;\r\nthe walls of the vessels become thinner and therefore dilate. In the\r\nfeet and limbs of the old and greatly enfeebled by disease the veins\r\nbecome distended to abnormal size by the force of gravity, resulting in\r\neffusion of water into the cellular tissues, which increases when in the\r\nupright position during the day and decreases when in the horizontal\r\nposition at night.\r\n\r\nA toning up of the entire vascular system, by which a reverse current\r\nfrom the tissues into the bloodvessels is made possible, is the only\r\nmeans for relief.\r\n\r\nThis flash-light upon the part physics plays in the cure of disease put\r\nme upon the true lines of investigation, and furnished a key for the\r\nsolution of many problems. From this time on I was to be kept busy, not\r\nin winning victories, but in studying them.\r\n\r\nThis new physiology was not fully apprehended until long after the\r\nno-breakfast plan was taken up. It came to me link by link; but the\r\nmissing link was the fact that food only restores waste, that lost\r\nstrength is only restored by sleep; and it now seems to me that I was\r\nvery dull not to have found it out long before I did. It seems to me\r\nthat no method of health culture, none in the treatment of disease can\r\nhave any physiological basis where these facts are not taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nFor a time I failed to look beyond the ailments of the stomach for\r\ncurative results, until really surprising news began to reach me from\r\nmany sources. There would come to me those who had to tell about clearer\r\nvision, acuter hearing, a stronger sense of smelling, etc., senses that\r\nwere not thought to be affected by disease; or there would be news that\r\nchronic, local ailings, as nasal or bronchial catarrhs, skin diseases,\r\nhemorrhoids, or other intractable disease, in some mysterious manner,\r\nwere undergoing a decline under the new regime.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of drugs we have medicines that vivid imagination has\r\nendowed with presumed affinities for locations that are diseased. They\r\nenter the circulation and happily get off at the right spot, to act\r\ncuratively; but no theories are advanced as to how they aid in the\r\nconstruction of new cells or atoms, or how they aid in the disposal of\r\nthe old ones.\r\n\r\nConstruction, destruction! There is no death of atoms: really nothing is\r\ngenerated, nothing destroyed: the change is but the rearranging of\r\nultimate elements; and how is a drug to influence any more than would be\r\nin case of the affinities of chemistry?\r\n\r\nHazy conceptions, crude means! The ultimate cell multiplies by division\r\nto become bone, nails, hair, ligaments, muscles, fat, the brain, the\r\nwhole body. Where along the line in the reconstructive work called by a\r\ndisease or injury is a medicine to apply with power to aid? In what way\r\nthe need to be expressed, in what operative way the helpful assistance\r\nmade clear, that faith without works that are seen can be made strong?\r\n\r\nThe chemist never rushes into print with news that another element has\r\nbeen discovered until demonstrative evidence has placed the matter\r\nbeyond all question. If anything new is discovered in the firmaments,\r\nadequate means to an end will be able to reveal it to all interested\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe impressions of science are quite different from the impressions of\r\nthe materia medica; and the miracles of cure that are displayed by the\r\ncolumn in even the highest class public prints are never in reach of\r\nscientific explanation.\r\n\r\nA new element is announced; we know instantly that it has been actually\r\ndiscovered. A new cure is announced; we instantly may know that the\r\nevidences will never be displayed along the lines of science.\r\n\r\nI now unfold a theory of my own of the origin and development of\r\ndisease, and the development of cure, in which the physical changes\r\ninvolved in some of the processes are in reach of the microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is my impression that, with rare exceptions, people are born with\r\nactual structural weaknesses, local or general, that may be called\r\nancestral legacies. These are known as constitutional tendencies to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIn parts structurally weak at birth the bloodvessels, because of thin\r\nand weak walls, are larger than in normal parts, and because of\r\ndilatation the blood circulates slower. There is an undue pressure upon\r\nall between-vessel structures, a pressure that must lessen the nutrient\r\nsupply more or less, according to its degree. The death of parts in\r\nboils and abscesses is due, I believe, to strangulation of the\r\nnerve-supply. The bloodvessels are elastic, and capable of contraction\r\nand dilatation, a matter regulated by the brain.\r\n\r\nNow in these weaknesses always lie the possibilities of disease; they\r\nmay be supposed the weak links in the constitutional chain, and can no\r\nmore be made stronger than the constitutional design than can the body\r\nas a whole. By whatever means brain power is lessened abnormality is\r\nincited in the weak parts; hence gradually from the original weakness\r\nthere is a summing up, as a bronchial or nasal catarrh, or other acute\r\nor chronic local or general disease.\r\n\r\nThe first step in any disease is the impression that lessens brain\r\npower; the slightest depressing emotion, the slightest sense of\r\ndiscomfort, lessens brain power, and to a like degree the tone of all\r\nthe bloodvessels; hence dilatation in degree. That the stomach, as the\r\nmost abused organ of the body, plays the largest part in over-drafts\r\nupon the brain is not a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nLet us develop a chronic disease along these lines, with nasal catarrh\r\nfor an illustration. As tone is regulated entirely by the brain system,\r\nall taxing of the brain increases the debility of the nasal structures.\r\nIn course of time the debility so increases through whatever also\r\ndebilitates the brain, that a stage is reached when water in the blood\r\nbegins to escape through the thin walls of the vessels and mingles with\r\nthe natural secretion of the membrane, and a catarrhal discharge is the\r\nresult. In severe cases a time may be reached when death of parts from\r\nthe strangling pressure may occur, and then we have an ulcerative\r\ncatarrh.\r\n\r\nThis evolution will go on as determined by the gravity of the ancestral\r\nweakness, by the natural strength of the dynamo, the brain, and the\r\nseverity of the debilitating forces to which it may be subjected.\r\n\r\nNo one is ever attacked by a nasal or any other catarrh, nor by any\r\nother chronic ailings. They all start from structural weaknesses that\r\nare inherited, and they are the evolutionary results of brain-wearying\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nIf a specialist were asked to express the actual condition of a diseased\r\nstructure that seems to call for medicinal aid, and to tell just how\r\nmedicated sprays, washes, and douches are to reach all the parts\r\ninvolved, with healing power, and in what way that power is\r\nexercised--in other words, what work actually is to be done, and how\r\nmedicine is to do it--he would not be able to enlighten his questioner\r\nno matter how fertile his conception, how dexterous his use of language.\r\nIn fact, the healing power of drugs exists in fertile imaginations\r\nrather than among those ultimate processes where disease is cured, where\r\ndisease destroys.\r\n\r\nAs the care moves by the power evolved in the dynamo, so do the\r\nbloodvessels contract and relax as determined by brain conditions.\r\nDilating bloodvessels, effusion of water from thinning walls, the\r\nbetween-vessels starving pressure, increasing general debility of all\r\nthe structures involved--this is the gradual evolution of catarrh and of\r\nall other chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nFrom this it was seen that no form of local treatment can avail to\r\nrelieve the operative cause in cases of this kind. Tone must be added to\r\nall the weakened, dilated vessels, in order to contract and thicken\r\ntheir walls so as to stop the leakage, and to relieve that pressure upon\r\nthe between structures that have become anaemic through lack of\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nThat an evolution in reverse is the one need scarcely calls for\r\nargument. It is the brain that needs our attention, and we meet its need\r\nby saving its rare powers from wasting.\r\n\r\nWe will do this by cutting down, as far as possible, all the activities\r\nfor which it furnishes power, even as we would diminish the number of\r\ncars where power in the dynamo had become deficient; we will either\r\nsever the wires that connect with the stomach, or make a marked\r\nreduction in the labor to be performed in the stomach. With power\r\naccumulating in the brain, power will reach the utmost recesses of\r\ndebility and disease, with Nature to do all the healing.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce this physiology, this statement may be made with the\r\nstrongest emphasis: the medical treatment of chronic disease fails\r\ninevitably because it fails to consider the vital force involved. The\r\nbrain has no part in the treatment of chronic disease by the specialist,\r\nwhere drugs are a means to an end never reached: there are only a\r\ndisappointment and an interchange of pocket-books.\r\n\r\nIn all parts suffering with pain there is congestion, swelling. The\r\nbloodvessels are distended; hence the nerves suffer violence in\r\nstretching or from pressure. The pain simply adds to the abnormal\r\nconditions by causing an active determination of the blood to the\r\ninvolved parts. To relieve pain, then, is curative, because it lessens\r\nthe abnormal congestion.\r\n\r\nThe no-breakfast plan with me proved a matter of life unto life. With my\r\nmorning coffee there were forenoons of the highest physical energy, the\r\nclearest condition of mind, and the acutest sense of everything\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe afternoons were always in marked sluggishness by contrast, from the\r\ntaxing of digestion.\r\n\r\nWithout realizing that the heavy meals of the day were a tax upon the\r\nbrain, I would scarcely get away from the table before I began to feel\r\nmore generally tired out than the severest taxing from a long forenoon\r\nof general activity ever made me. With the filled stomach, fatigue,\r\ngeneral exhaustion, came as a sudden attack rather than as an evolution\r\nfrom labor, and there would be several hours of unfitness for doing any\r\nkind of service well.\r\n\r\nIn the application of this method to others I had the great satisfaction\r\nof good results without any exceptions; and the missionary work was\r\nbegun by friends among friends, fairly spreading better health and\r\nadding thereby more and more disaster to my name.\r\n\r\nMore and more I became a focus of adverse criticism in all matters where\r\nlevel-headedness was deemed important. My acute cases began to be\r\nwatched with hostile interest, as if homicide from starvation were the\r\ninevitable result in all cases. My country had become the country of an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nNot being able to give my patients clearly defined reasons for the\r\ngeneral and local improvements resulting from a forenoon fast as a\r\nmethod in hygiene, it had to be spread from relieved persons to\r\nsuffering friends; and according to the need, the sufferers from various\r\nailings would be willing to try anything new where efforts through the\r\nfamily physician or patent medicines had completely failed; it was\r\nspread as if by contagion, among the failures of the medical profession.\r\n\r\nAmong those to become interested at an early date was a prominent\r\nminister who wore the title of D. D., and for a time his interest was\r\nintense. He came to me one day with word that a member of his household,\r\nwell known to me as a young woman of unusual ability and culture, had\r\nnot been able to take solid food at his table for a year, and he\r\nbelieved that my treatment would avail in her case. To this she was very\r\naverse, since every treatment her hapless stomach had received had only\r\nadded to the debility, until disability had become the result. She\r\nfinally came to me to be relieved from the forceful importunity of her\r\nreverend friend, who had excited my eager interest with a prophecy that\r\nunusual literary distinction would follow a cure, as there were\r\nabilities of the very highest order, in his estimation.\r\n\r\nShe came, and I had no difficulty in securing such a vacation for the\r\nworn-out stomach that it could begin with solid food when the time to\r\neat arrived. The vacation was so brief and power had accumulated so\r\nrapidly that almost any food could be taken without discomfort, and no\r\ntrouble ever came not invited by a relapse from the better way of living\r\nthat had really created a new stomach.\r\n\r\nThis case caused more notoriety over the no-breakfast plan than any that\r\never occurred in the city. As a writer of biographies and of articles in\r\nhigh-class journals and magazines, this talented woman has been a\r\nmiracle of patient, persistent study and investigation.\r\n\r\nThis endorsement in high places greatly added to my reputation as a\r\nphysician with distorted mind, for the idea that any good could come\r\nfrom a short fast, to be followed by the giving up of that needed\r\nmorning meal, was too absurd for sober reflection, too violently\r\nrevolutionary to be even patiently considered.\r\n\r\nThe no-breakfast plan was not so very long in becoming known over the\r\nentire city; a bridge had been crossed, and every plank taken up and\r\ndestroyed; thence the ways into new families were nearly closed.\r\n\r\nI am enlarging a little upon the opposition that met me from all points,\r\nbecause all who are to be convinced that these are the true ways in\r\nhealth culture will begin at once to enlighten their ailing friends, and\r\nwill, therefore, encounter the same opposition. \"Sir, you have not had\r\nenough opposition,\" said bluff, old Samuel Johnson. There will be no\r\nneed to complain of any lack of this kind in the efforts to render\r\nsuffering friends the only aid possible, that will be in persistent\r\nefforts of Nature.\r\n\r\nMy medical brethren considered the scheme only as they would consider an\r\ninvasion of smallpox or a heresy whose methods were a danger to life.\r\nOne physician, a woman specialist, informed me that she was continually\r\nimportuned as to her professional opinion of the new craze that had\r\ninvaded the city. That all other physicians were equally called upon,\r\nthat they would condemn, was inevitable; and I permitted them the\r\nlargest liberty without the least resentment; but there was the\r\nsustaining cheer of seeing the happiest faces that only increased as the\r\nheresy spread.\r\n\r\nMy attendance upon the severely sick became more taxing because of the\r\nexceeding concern in the immediate environment, that the pangs of\r\nstarvation were being added to the pangs of disease.\r\n\r\nAs none of my professional brethren ever manifested any desire to be\r\nenlightened on this subject, I did not volunteer, since I felt the wiser\r\nway would be to wait an adequate amount of evidence before making any\r\npublic announcements of presumed important discoveries in practical\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nMy experiences in the rooms of the sick had convinced me, long before I\r\ngave up my morning meal, that death from starvation was so remote as\r\npractically to exclude it from consideration; hence with the great\r\nimprovement that was the immediate result in my own case I could from\r\nthe first speak with a \"thus saith the Lord\" emphasis on the safety of\r\ngoing through a forenoon \"on an empty stomach.\"\r\n\r\nAs no one could come into my office without my being able to give the\r\nassurance of at least some relief that would be immediately realized,\r\nthat would be felt even to the finger-ends, my office became more and\r\nmore a lecture-room, a school of health culture for the education of\r\nmissionaries, for a friend-to-friend uplifting into higher life.\r\n\r\nAll I needed for my own sake was that missing link to clothe my words\r\nwith all the desired power. With so much to enliven, to encourage, it\r\nwas as if I were sitting at the very feet of Nature, so thrilled by her\r\nwonderful stories that I was utterly unconscious of the storm of\r\nridicule and epithet to which I was subjected.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while Nature would favor me with a miracle in the way of an\r\ninspiring change. A man in the early prime of life had reached a\r\ncondition in which he habitually rejected every breakfast. Two trips to\r\nEurope and a year in the hands of a Berlin specialist for the stomach\r\nfailed to relieve; and yet he was not so disabled as to prevent him\r\nattending to his ordinary business affairs; the stomach seemed to be\r\neccentric in being merely irritable without structural disease.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he felt that the breakfasts which would not stay down\r\nwere doing him any good. To this he had to assent that they were not. I\r\ntold him if the breakfast only to result in a heave-offering were\r\nomitted he would be better able for his duties of the forenoon. He began\r\nat once to raise his brows.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult for him to see that if no breakfasts were put into\r\nhis stomach none would have to be thrown up with sickening effort, and\r\nhence he could not but be better for the forenoon services if the sick\r\nspell were omitted. The fact was, the breakfast would soon be rejected,\r\nand then the hours of rest would enable the stomach to handle the dinner\r\nwithout the repetition of the morning sickness.\r\n\r\nOnly a few words from me of this kind, and thence on there were no\r\nbreakfasts; and from the first all the complaints from the stomach\r\nceased, and he used to remark that he began to get well as soon as I\r\nbegan to talk to him.\r\n\r\nNow this man with his family was a recent arrival in this city, and his\r\nfirst intimate acquaintance was one who had been relieved of weekly\r\nheadaches of a skull-bursting kind through the no-breakfast plan--thus\r\nthe missionary contagion.\r\n\r\nFor many years I was content to allow people to have the morning coffee\r\nor tea as desired, with the largest liberty of dinner gluttony; and this\r\nwas really the only means possible for the introduction of an innovation\r\nso radical. To have given nothing to relieve the morning want for\r\nsomething in the stomach to set the wheels of life in motion would have\r\nbeen a failure from the first. With all the coffee break of the fast was\r\nattended by so marked an increase of cheer and general strength, and the\r\nenjoyment of the general meal at or before noon was so immeasurably\r\nincreased, that the method spread as a contagion against which\r\nprofessional denouncement and ridicule were in vain.\r\n\r\nAnd with all converts I found that the experiences in the penalties of\r\ngluttony were so enlightening, so restraining, that there was apparently\r\nlittle need to say much more as to the quantity or quality of food, what\r\nand how to eat.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of all over the forenoons of power and comfort, to be\r\nfollowed by a luxury of meals never before realized, fully satisfied my\r\npride in professional success; and all the more because the penalties of\r\ngluttony were seldom charged to my account.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the missing link was found and added to the chain that\r\nI could fully realize the enormous waste of strength and the mental and\r\nmoral degradation from eating food in excess, because the enticements of\r\nrelish are taken for the actual needs of the body. Think of it! Actual\r\nsoul power involved in ridding the stomach and bowels of the foul sewage\r\nof _food in excess_, _food_ in a state of decomposition, to be forced\r\nthrough nearly two rods of bowels and largely at the expense of the soul\r\nitself!!\r\n\r\nOh, gluttony, with its jaws of death, its throat an ever-open gate to\r\nthe stomach of torment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I finally arrived at a point of vision where I could see the\r\nstomach as a mere machine, that it could no more act without brain-power\r\nthan brawny arms with their nerves severed could wield a sledge, I began\r\na study of digestion with new interest, with a view to save power from\r\nundue waste.\r\n\r\nIt is the _sense of relish_, of flavor, that is behind all the woes of\r\nindigestion, and not the sense of hunger. The sweetened foods; the pies,\r\ncakes, puddings, etc., that are eaten merely from a sense of relish\r\nafter the sense of hunger has become fully sated, and generally by far\r\nmore of the plainer foods than waste demands, is the wrecking sin at all\r\nbut the humblest tables.\r\n\r\n_Rapid eating_, by which there is imperfect solution of the tougher\r\nsolids and a filling of the stomach before the hunger sense can\r\nnaturally be appeased, is the additional evil to insure serious\r\nconsequences to the stomach and brain.\r\n\r\nFor merely _practical purposes_, all that is necessary to know about the\r\ndigestive process is that by a peculiar arrangement of the muscle forces\r\nof the stomach the food is made to revolve in such a way as to wipe the\r\nexuding digestive juice from the walls; that, therefore, the finer the\r\ndivision of the solids by mastication the more rapid the solution to the\r\nabsorbing condition. That meat in finer particles will sooner dissolve\r\nthan meat in large, solid masses is clearly seen.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that digestive conditions are really soul\r\nconditions, as if there were actual wires extending from the very depths\r\nof the soul itself to each individual gland, with power to ebb and flow\r\nas the mental condition shall determine.\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that _power_ to digest is the power to revolve food\r\nin the stomach and the power to generate the gastric juice as determined\r\nby the power of the brain, the glands themselves not holding their juice\r\nin mere reserve, but power to generate in reserve. Thus it is seen that\r\nfood in excess is in every way exhaustive as the immediate result.\r\n\r\nThese may be called the subjective conditions of digestion. Now let us\r\nconsider some of the objective conditions from the standpoint of moral\r\nscience. What the sunshine of a warm day is to all growing things on the\r\nearth, so is that shining seen in other faces that reaches the depths of\r\nthe human soul with brightness and life.\r\n\r\n_Overeating_ is so universal from the general ignorance of practical\r\nphysiology that few stomachs have a time for a full clearing with the\r\nneeded rest before the time of another filling arrives. It is therefore\r\na matter of sheer necessity not only to attain and maintain the utmost\r\npossible cheer of soul, but it is also a necessity to have cheer in\r\nother souls with whom relations are intimate.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of extraneous _digestive aid_, a cheerful soul in a family\r\nis an abiding source of digestive energy to all in social contact. It\r\naffects the digestive energy of all, as the breeze the fire, as the\r\nclearing sky the low spirits from the gloom of chill and fogs. The eyes\r\nthat do not glisten with higher life, the lines upon the face that are\r\nnot alive with cheerful, kindly emotions, the frowning look, the word\r\nthat cuts deeply, have their repressive effects upon digestive energy\r\nwithin their remorseless reach.\r\n\r\nThe _moral science_ of digestive energy is a new study; it is not known\r\nas a factor in the process of digestion; but the time is coming when\r\ncheer of soul will become a study as of one of the finer arts, and then\r\nhuman homes will not be so much like lesser lunatic asylums without the\r\nrestraining hands of a wise superintendent.\r\n\r\nLife will be different in homes when all within the age of reason shall\r\nrealize that their words without kindness, their looks without cheer,\r\nare forces that tend to physical and moral degradation, really nothing\r\nless than death-dealing energies upon all lives within their reach. The\r\npower of human kindness has ever been a favorite theme with the\r\nmoralist, but it has not been considered with reference to its power\r\nupon digestion.\r\n\r\n_Anger_ is mental and moral chaos; it is insanity; it is revenge in the\r\nfury of a hurricane; and sensitive natures have the greatest need for\r\nthe largest measure of health in order that these human tempests shall\r\nbe under larger restraint.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy, the irritable, the dyspeptic Christian is a dispenser of\r\ndeath and not of the higher life, and his religious faith does not\r\nspread by the contagiousness of example: and because of the solemnity,\r\nof the exceeding importance of his sense of the possibilities of the\r\nlife beyond death he has all the more need to have that physical and\r\nmoral strength that his daily walk, conversation, and mien may be\r\nconsistent, forceful, and uplifting.\r\n\r\nTo this great end study, study to see _cheer_ everywhere, and above all\r\nthings to possess it. Good health is also contagious, and, no less than\r\ndisease, has a reflex impression. Only above the chill dampness, the\r\nfogs, and clouds is the clear sky with the blazing sun. There are\r\nundreamed-of possibilities of getting above the worriments of life\r\nthrough an intelligent understanding and application of the physiology\r\nof cheer as the chief force in the life of the body, mind, and soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving finally arrived at the conviction that from the first wink in the\r\nmorning until the last at night strength departs, not in any way to be\r\nkept up by food, that from the last wink at night until the first in the\r\nmorning strength returns, I became fully endowed to tell all the sick\r\nand afflicted in the most forceful way that with the strength of the\r\nbrain recharged by sleep is all the labor of the day performed, and that\r\nno labor is so taxing upon human muscles that it cannot be performed\r\nlonger without fatigue when the breakfast is omitted.\r\n\r\nThat this is possible came to me as a great surprise and in this way: a\r\nfarmer with a large assortment of ailments came to me for relief through\r\ndrugs. He was simply advised to take coffee mornings, rest mainly during\r\nforenoons, and when a normal appetite and power to digest would come he\r\nwould be able to work after resuming his breakfasts. This man, who was\r\nmore than fifty years old, was the first manual laborer to be advised to\r\nobserve a morning fast.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after, he came to me with news that his ailing had all\r\ndeparted, and that he had been able to do harder work on his coffee\r\nbreakfasts than ever before with breakfasts of solids. And if he so\r\nworked with power during forenoons, why not others? Why not all?\r\n\r\nThis no-breakfast plan was so contagious that I was not long in finding\r\nthat farmers in all directions were beginning to go to their labors with\r\nmuch less food in their stomachs than had been their wont, and in all\r\ncases with added power of muscle.\r\n\r\nOnly recently three farmers went into the field one hot morning to\r\ncradle oats, the most trying of all work on the farm; two of them had\r\ntheir stomachs well filled with hearty foods. With profuse sweating and\r\nwater by the quart because of the chemical heat arising from both\r\ndigestion and decomposition, these toiled through the long hours with\r\nmuch weariness. The third man had all his strength for the swinging of\r\nthe cradle, the empty stomach not even calling for water; with the\r\ngreatest ease he kept his laboring friends in close company and when the\r\nnoon hour came he was not nearly so tired as they.\r\n\r\nA man who had been a great sufferer from indigestion, a farmer, found\r\nsuch an increase of health and strength from omitting the morning meal\r\nthat he became able to cradle rye, a much heavier grain than oats,\r\nduring an entire forenoon \"on an empty stomach.\" Later he went from one\r\nDecember to the following April on one daily meal, and not only with\r\nease, but with a gain in weight in addition. During these months this\r\nman did all the work usual in farm-houses, besides riding several hours\r\nover a milk route during the forenoons.\r\n\r\nIn this city resides a carpenter, formerly subject to frequent\r\nsicknesses, who for the past five years has walked nearly a mile to the\r\nshop where he is employed without even as much as a drink of water for\r\nbreakfast; and this not only without any sicknesses, but with an\r\nincrease in weight of fifteen pounds also.\r\n\r\nMore than a dozen years ago a farmer who was not diseased in any way,\r\nbut who had been in the habit of eating three times a day at a\r\nwell-spread table, and at mid-forenoon taking a small luncheon for\r\nhunger-faintness, omitted his breakfast and morning luncheon, and has\r\nbeen richly rewarded since then in escaping severe colds and other\r\nailings. He conclusively felt that his forenoon was the better half of\r\nthe day for clear-headedness and hard labor; he has added nearly a score\r\nof pounds to his weight, and his case has been a wonder to all his\r\nfarmer friends, who see only starvation in cutting down brain and\r\nneedless stomach taxing.\r\n\r\nI must now ask the reader to bear with me while I apply the principles\r\nof this new hygiene with a good deal of reiteration, trying to vary them\r\nin utterance as far as possible. The need of daily food is primarily a\r\nmatter of waste and supply, the waste always depending upon the amount\r\nof loss through the general activities, manual labor being the most\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from where I live a new house is being built: for\r\nmany days during the chilly, windy month of March several men have been\r\nengaged high in the air, handling green boards, studs, and joists for\r\nten hours each day; and yet these men are not eating more food daily\r\nthan hundreds of brain-workers who never have general exercise. The\r\nworkmen across the street eat to satisfy hunger; the brain-workers, to\r\nsatisfy the sense of relish; and the meals of the latter are habitually\r\nin excess of the real demands because of wasted bodies.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the apparent overeating of the brain-worker, I believe the\r\nfarmer and the manual laborer break down at an earlier age, for the\r\nreason that they overwork and generally eat when too tired to digest\r\nfully: the farmer is rarely content to do one day's work in one day when\r\nthe crop season invites him to make the most of fair days.\r\n\r\nWith successes rapidly multiplying in all directions within my circuit,\r\nthe desire became urgent for some way to make my new hygiene known to\r\nthe public. My first thought was to get some eminent divine interested\r\nthrough a cure that would compel him to a continual talk as to how he\r\nbecame saved.\r\n\r\nAt a great denominational meeting in Chicago I chanced to hear a\r\nsplendid address from a sallow-faced professor of a divinity school, the\r\nRev. Dr. G. W. N.; and after a great deal of reflection I resolved,\r\nwithout consulting him, to write him a series of letters on health\r\nculture, hoping that he would become so immediately interested as to\r\npermit me a complete unfolding of my theory and practice.\r\n\r\nI began the series, taking all the chances to be considered a crank;\r\nthey were continued until the end without response, when later I\r\nreceived a brief note with sarcasm in every line. At least my letters\r\nhad been read; for he informed me that he had no confidence in my\r\ntheory, giving me a final summing up with his estimate that there were\r\nmore \"cranks\" in the medical profession than in any other. I was not in\r\nthe least cast down at this long-range estimate, since I had become\r\nquite used to close-at-hand ridicule.\r\n\r\nThere was before me the unknown time when a still more eminent D. D.\r\nwould both accept and practise my theory, and also give the world his\r\nestimate in an elaborate preface to a book that in the fulness of time\r\nthe ways opened to me to write and have published.\r\n\r\nI was sent for by a man who had become a moral and physical wreck, his\r\nbody being reduced to nearly a skeleton condition from consumption. As\r\nhe was taking an average of two quarts of whiskey per week, I accepted\r\nthe charge of his case with reluctance.\r\n\r\nI was not able in any way to change his symptoms for the better; there\r\nhad been no hint of hunger for many weeks, and the mere effort to\r\nswallow or even taste the most tempting dainties was painful to witness.\r\nHe was taken with a severe pain in his side, which was fully relieved\r\nwith the hypodermic needle, and there followed several hours of general\r\ncomfort and no desire for the alcoholic. Seeing this I was strongly\r\nimpressed that by continuing the dosings for a time the seared stomach\r\nmight get into a better condition and the fast be followed by a natural\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nThis is what actually followed: in about a week the dosings were reduced\r\nto mere hints, and without any desire for stimulants there came a desire\r\nfor broiled steak and baked potatoes, which were taken with great\r\nrelish. Thence on this was mainly the bill of fare, and the half-filled\r\nbottle remained on his table _untouched_, undesired; and in time there\r\nwere added more than a score of pounds to his wasted body.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that this regenerative work was seen day after day by his\r\nfriend, who was badly in need of an all-round treatment to meet the\r\nneeds of his case; he was a man of keen intellect, of real ability of\r\nboth mind and muscle. Becoming deeply interested in the theory behind\r\nthe miracle he saw unfolding day after day, and all the more because of\r\na total extinction of the drink-habit that was deep seated through long\r\nduration, he began to omit his morning meals.\r\n\r\nHe saw more than his own case. He had been a manager of book agencies,\r\nand when he found also his desire for the cigar undergoing a rapid\r\ndecline, he became possessed with the idea that a book might be written\r\non the subject. The time came when he could sit down in the office of\r\nthe Henry Bill Publishing Company, Norwich, Conn., a picture of health,\r\nto interview Mr. Charles C. Haskell on the subject of publishing a\r\nbook. Mr. Haskell had known him in less healthful years, and he\r\nmarvelled at the change.\r\n\r\nI had duly suggested, and with great emphasis, that no publisher would\r\nlisten to him unless he were sick enough to be interested in the theory\r\nand would give a test by actual trial. He found Mr. Haskell in very low\r\nhealth. Experts had sent him on a tour through Europe in search of that\r\nhealth he failed to find; his body was starving on three meals a day\r\nthat were not digested, and he began to arrange his affairs with\r\nreference to a near-at-hand breakdown.\r\n\r\nTo this man was made such an appeal as men are rarely able to make,\r\nbecause a regenerated life was also vocal in utterance. To him a miracle\r\nseemed to have been wrought, and he listened to each word as if to a\r\nreprieve from a death seemingly inevitable.\r\n\r\nAs there was no disease of the stomach, it required only a few days for\r\nMr. Haskell to acquire so much of new life that he felt as one born\r\nagain, and a week had not passed before I had his earnest request to put\r\nmy hygiene into a book, he taking all chances of failure.\r\n\r\nHe began to advise all ailing friends to give up their breakfasts or to\r\nfast until natural hunger came, getting many marvellous results. One of\r\nhis first thoughts was to have the forthcoming book introduced by some\r\neminent divine who could write through the inspiration of experience.\r\n\r\nIn a visit to Norwich of that evangelist of world-wide eminence, George\r\nF. Pentecost, D. D., then of London, Eng., the opportunity came, and\r\nfor a case of \"special conversion\" he was made the guest of Mr. Haskell.\r\nHe was easily persuaded to the system, and his need is expressed in the\r\nfollowing from the introduction of _The True Science of Living_, which\r\nwas actually written without his having read a single line of the\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\n\"Taking the theory upon which this system of living is based into\r\naccount--and even to my lay mind it seemed most reasonable--and the\r\ntestimony which I personally received from both men and women, delicate\r\nand biliously strong, workingmen, merchants, doctors, and preachers,\r\ndelicate ladies for years invalided and in a state of collapse, and some\r\nwho had never been ill, but were a hundred per cent. better for living\r\nwithout breakfast, _I resolved to give up my breakfast_. I pleaded at\r\nfirst that it might be my luncheon instead, for I have all my life\r\nenjoyed my breakfast more than any other meal. But no! it was the\r\nbreakfast that must go. So on a certain fine Monday morning I bade\r\nfarewell to the breakfast-room. For a day or two I suffered slight\r\nheadaches from what seemed to me was the want of food; but I soon found\r\nthat they were just _the dying pains of a bad habit_. After a week had\r\npassed I never thought of wanting breakfast; and though I was often\r\npresent in the breakfast-rooms of friends whom I was visiting, and every\r\ntempting luxury of the breakfast was spread before me, I did not desire\r\nfood at all, feeling no suggestion of hunger. Indeed now, after a few\r\nmonths, the thought of breakfast never occurs to me. I am ready for my\r\nluncheon (or breakfast if you please) at one o'clock, but am never\r\nhungry before that hour.\r\n\r\n\"As for the results of this method of living, I can only relate them as\r\nI have personally experienced them:\r\n\r\n\"1. I have not had the first suggestion of a sick headache since I gave\r\nup my breakfast. From my earliest boyhood I do not remember ever having\r\ngone a whole month without being down with one of these attacks, and for\r\nthirty years, during the most active part of my life, I have suffered\r\nwith them oftentimes, more or less, every day for a month or six weeks\r\nat a time, and hardly ever a whole fortnight passed without an acute\r\nattack that has sent me to bed or at least left me to drag through the\r\nday with intense bodily suffering and mental discouragement.\r\n\r\n\"2. I have gradually lost a large portion of my surplus fat, my weight\r\nhaving gone down some twenty pounds, and my size being reduced by\r\nseveral inches at the point where corpulency was the most prominent; and\r\nI am still losing weight and decreasing in size.\r\n\r\n\"3. I find that my skin is improving in texture, becoming softer, finer,\r\nand more closely knit than heretofore. My complexion and eyes have\r\ncleared, and all fulness of the face and the tendency to flushness in\r\nthe head have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"4. I experience no fulness and unpleasantness after eating, as I so\r\noften did before. As a matter of fact, though I enjoy my meals (and I\r\neat everything my appetite and taste call for) as never before, eating\r\nwith zest, I do not think I eat as much as I used to do; but I am\r\nconscious of better digestion; my food does not lie so long in my\r\nstomach, and that useful organ seems to have gone out of the\r\ngas-producing business.\r\n\r\n\"5. I am conscious of a lighter step and a more elastic spring in all my\r\nlimbs. Indeed, a brisk walk now is a pleasure which I seek to gratify,\r\nwhereas before the prescribed walk for the sake of exercise was a\r\nhorrible bore to me.\r\n\r\n\"6. I go to my study and to my pulpit on an empty stomach without any\r\nsense of loss of strength mentally or physically--on the other hand,\r\nwith freshness and vigor which is delightful. In this respect I am quite\r\nsure that I am in every way advantaged.\"\r\n\r\nRev. George Sherman Richards, after more than fifteen years of frequent\r\nsevere headaches that were supposed to be due to heredity, has had\r\nentire freedom during the five years of the No-breakfast Plan. He can\r\nhardly be surpassed as a picture of perfect health.\r\n\r\nOne of the first prominent converts who finally surrendered to Mr.\r\nHaskell, whose persistence was beyond fatigue, was the editor of the\r\nNorwich, Conn., _Bulletin_, a special friend. There was no want of\r\nconviction on his part, but the evil day to begin the morning fast was\r\ncontinually postponed. Finally, one morning when he was specially busy\r\nand charged with impatience, the beaming and hopeful face of Mr. Haskell\r\nappeared. Said the busy man, \"Mr. Haskell, if you will walk right out\r\nof that door, I will promise you to begin tomorrow morning to do without\r\nbreakfasts.\" Mr. Haskell walked out--the breakfasts were given up, and\r\nsome years later I was personally informed that he believed that his\r\nlife had been saved thereby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. GEORGE SHERMAN RICHARDS,\r\n\r\nRector of Christ Church, Meadville, Pa.]\r\n\r\nOne of the expedients was to send a circular about the book to every\r\nforeign missionary of every denomination, and as a result one of these\r\nfell into the hands of Rev. W. E. Rambo, in India. He had become a mere\r\nshadow of his former self from ulcerated bowels, the sequel of a badly\r\ntreated case of typhoid fever. For seven months there had been daily\r\nmovements tinged with blood; the appetite was ravenous, and large meals\r\nwere taken without any complainings from the stomach. Before a\r\nwell-spread table his desire to eat would become simply furious, and it\r\nwas indulged regardless of quality and quantity. His brain system had\r\nbecome so exhausted that reason and judgment had no part in this\r\nhurricane of hunger.\r\n\r\nThere were seven successive physicians in this case, some of them with\r\nmany titles. The first one he called on reaching New England cut his\r\nfood down to _six bland meals daily_. All of them had tried to cure the\r\noffending ulcers by dosings. Think whether bleeding ulcers on the body\r\nwould get well with their tender surfaces subjected to the same\r\ngrinding, scratching process from bowel rubbish!\r\n\r\nHe was in condition on his arrival to lose six pounds during the first\r\nweek of six \"bland\" daily meals. After reading the _True Science of\r\nLiving_ he discharged his physician and came under my personal care.\r\nThese ulcers were treated with the idea of giving them the same rest as\r\nif each had been the end of a fractured bone. To relieve pain, to hold\r\nthe bowel still, and to abolish the morbid hunger, a few doses with the\r\nhypodermic needle were a seeming necessity.\r\n\r\nIn less than two weeks this starving man of skin and bones was relieved\r\nof all symptoms of disease, and there seemed a moderate desire for food\r\nof the nourishing kind. Less than two weeks were required for all those\r\nulcers to become covered with a new membrane: but for full three weeks\r\nonly those liquid foods were given that had no rubbish in them to prove\r\nan irritant to the new, delicate membrane covering the ulcers. For a\r\ntime after the third week there was only one light daily meal, with a\r\nsecond added when it seemed safe to take it.\r\n\r\nIn a little more than three months there was a gain of forty-two and a\r\nhalf pounds of flesh, as instinct with new, vigorous life as if freshly\r\nformed by the divine hand. My last word from this restored man was after\r\nhe, his wife, and four children had been back in India for a year and a\r\nhalf, where they were all living on the two-meal plan without any\r\nsicknesses, and he had a class of one hundred and sixty native boys on\r\nthe same plan.\r\n\r\nWho can fail to see the science and the sense to relieve all diseases\r\nof the digestive tract? There are no cases of hemorrhoids not malignant\r\nin character, in which total relief will not be the result if fasts are\r\nlong enough; no cases of anal fistula that will not finally close if\r\nthey can have that rest from violence that is their only need; and\r\nequally all ulcers and fissures that make life a history of torture.\r\n\r\nNo case with structural disease of any part of the digestive tract not\r\nmalignant has yet come under my care in which there has not been a cure,\r\nor in which there has not been a cure in sight. Through a fast we may\r\nlet the diseased parts in the digestive tract rest as we would a broken\r\nbone or wound on the body.\r\n\r\nSeveral missionaries have regained health on these new lines, who have\r\nreturned to preach and practise a larger gospel than before. One\r\nreturned from the Congo region of Africa with such wreckage of health as\r\nto make any active service impossible. Mr. Haskell met him in New York,\r\nand in time he returned with twenty-four missionaries, all as converts\r\nto the new gospel of health, and to have that sustained health only\r\npossible through a larger obedience to the laws of God \"manifest in the\r\nflesh\"--obedience that takes into account the moral science, the physics\r\nand the chemistry of digestion.\r\n\r\nThese and those others who have had their lives redeemed from lingering\r\ndeath through the simple, easy ways of Nature never suffer their\r\nenthusiasm to wane. Not to volunteer aid when unintentional suicide is\r\ngoing on seems nothing less than criminal.\r\n\r\nAs a means to better health the utility of the morning fast is beyond\r\nestimate. In all other modes of health culture there is a great deal of\r\ntime consumed in certain exercises that are certain to be given up in\r\ntime. What the busy world requires is a mode to gain and maintain the\r\nhealth that requires neither time nor thought--one that is really\r\nautomatic.\r\n\r\nWe arise in the morning with our brain recharged by sleep, and we go at\r\nonce about our business. If we take a walk or go to the gymnasium, we\r\nsimply waste that much time, and we also lessen the stored-up energy by\r\nwhatever of effort is called out. We can skip the dumb-bells and perform\r\nany other kind of exercise that is good for the health; and always with\r\nthe certainty that we shall have more strength for the first half of the\r\nday if none is wasted in this way. As a matter of mere enjoyment, walks\r\nin fresh air are beneficial, but not as an enforced exercise for the\r\nreason of health.\r\n\r\nFor the highest possibilities for a day of human service there must be a\r\nnight of sound sleep; and then one may work with muscle or with mind\r\nmuch longer without fatigue if no strength is wasted over untimely food\r\nin the stomach, no enforced means to develop health and strength. When\r\none has worked long enough to become generally tired there should be a\r\nperiod of rest, in order to regain power to digest what shall be so\r\neaten as to cause the brain the least waste of its powers through\r\nfailure to masticate.\r\n\r\nOne need not always wait until noon to eat the first meal. Those in good\r\nhealth have found that they can easily go till noon before breaking the\r\nfast; but in proportion as one is weak or ailing the rule should be to\r\nstop all work as soon as fatigue becomes marked, and then rest until\r\npower to digest is restored. To eat when one is tired is to add a burden\r\nof labor to all the energies of life, and with the certainty that no\r\nwastes will be restored thereby.\r\n\r\nFor the highest efforts of genius, of art, of the simplest labors of the\r\nhands, the forenoon with empty stomach and larger measure of stored-up\r\nenergy of the brain is by far the better half of the day; and, more than\r\nthis, it is equally the better for the display of all the finer senses\r\nof the tastes, the finer emotions of soul life. In addition to\r\nthese--and what is vastly more important--it is by far the better half\r\nof the day for the display of that energy whereby disease is cured. All\r\nthis with no power lost in any special exercise for the health!\r\n\r\nThe time to stop the forenoon labor is when the need to rest has become\r\nclearly apparent; and there must be rest before eating, to restore the\r\nenergy for digestion. This always determines Nature's time when the\r\nfirst meal shall be taken, and not the hour of the day.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important to all who are constitutionally weak or\r\nhave become disabled through ailings or disease. Disappointments have\r\ncome to hundreds who have given up breakfasts, because of the mistaken\r\nidea that they must wait till noon before breaking the fast, and hence\r\nhad become too tired to digest; and therefore experienced a loss rather\r\nthan a gain from the untimely noon meals.\r\n\r\nThe desire for morning food is a matter of habit only. Morning hunger is\r\na disease under culture, and they who feel the most need have the most\r\nreason to fast into higher health. They who claim that their breakfasts\r\nare their best meals; that they simply \"cannot do one thing\" until they\r\nhave eaten, are practically in line with those who must have their\r\nalcoholics before the wheels can be started.\r\n\r\nNow it has been found by the experience of thousands that by wholly\r\ngiving up the morning meal all desire for it in time disappears, which\r\ncould hardly be the case if the laws of life were thereby violated; and\r\nthe habit once fully eradicated is rarely resumed.\r\n\r\nTo give up suddenly the use of alcoholics or of tobacco in any of its\r\nforms is to call out loudest protests from the morbid voices that have\r\nbeen kept silent by those soothing powers; and yet no one would accept\r\nthose loud cries as indicating an actual physiological need. The\r\ndifficulties arising from giving up the morning meals--even as those\r\nfrom giving up the morning grog--are an exact measure of the need that\r\nthey shall be given up in order that health, and not disease, shall be\r\nunder culture.\r\n\r\nI once heard a Rev. Mrs. tell a large audience of ministers that for\r\nmore than a week she spent most of her forenoons in bed to endure better\r\nthe headaches and other angry, protesting voices that were averse to the\r\nno-breakfast plan. She won her case, and thence on a hint of headache or\r\nother morbid symptoms was a matter of humiliation and fasting, with\r\nprayer for forgiveness and for greater moral strength against the\r\ntemptations of relish.\r\n\r\nWith many people the breaking of the breakfast habit costs only less of\r\nwill-power than is called out by attempts to break the alcoholic or\r\ntobacco habit; but by persistence a complete victory is certain for all,\r\nand the forenoons become a luxury of power in reserve.\r\n\r\nNow, I must warn all that very many persons who adopt the No-breakfast\r\nPlan are disappointed, because they have become chronic in the ways of\r\nunwitting sin: they are like thin-soiled farms long-cropped without soil\r\nculture. Harvests in either case can only come by the study and practice\r\nof the laws of nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe besetting sin against all such ailing mortals, the lines of whose\r\nlives are frequently of the hardest, is that the friends all oppose\r\ncutting down the daily food from the dreadfully mistaken impression that\r\nweakness and debility from disease are the measure of the need to eat,\r\nnot the measure of the inability to digest.\r\n\r\nScores of times I have been written to by this class of patients as to\r\ntheir troubles from friends in this way. Scores of times I have been\r\nconsulted as to the safety of this method in daily living for the old,\r\nas if it were a tax upon the constitutional powers to stop sinning\r\nagainst them! As well ask whether one may get too old as to make it\r\ndangerous to cut down daily whiskey or daily labor that is clearly\r\nbeyond the reasonable use of the powers.\r\n\r\nThose who are the victims of chronic diseases and have become greatly\r\nenfeebled by overwork of body, mind, or stomach, will have to work out\r\ntheir salvation with most discouragingly slow progress; but not to work,\r\nnot to try, is to invite the processes of disease culture.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the time when that first meal of the day shall be taken.\r\nSince the best meal of the day in all America with the great majority of\r\nthe people is at noon, this time may well be selected as the most\r\nfitting. Since the man of muscle loses no time in taking his breakfast,\r\nhe should be able with good sense to rest an hour before this noon meal.\r\n\r\nThose whose general energies give out earlier in the morning and do not\r\ncare to have general meals prepared in advance of the usual hour, can\r\nput in the time in the best possible way by resting into power of relish\r\nand digestion, the evil of eating when tired being that the exhausted\r\nfeeling is only increased.\r\n\r\nNow think what forenoons may be had with no time lost over breakfasts,\r\nnone in thinking about the health or in doing anything for it, and not\r\nonly to have the best and strongest use of the reason, judgment, and\r\nmuscles, but also to have the best possible conditions for the cure of\r\nailings! Think, too, what it would be to the mothers of the land not to\r\nhave any need to go into their kitchens until the time to prepare the\r\nnoon meal arrived!\r\n\r\nCan children while growing rapidly do without breakfasts? They certainly\r\ncan without a hint of discomfort, and be all the better for it in every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nA few months ago I spent some hours in Illinois, where the no-breakfast\r\nplan had been practised for two years. When the plan was begun there was\r\na pale, delicate mother of four children, who was enduring a life that\r\nhad no cheer. During the first year the battle was a severe one, not a\r\nlittle aggravated by the assurance of all sympathetic friends that\r\nresulting evil was making its mark on all the lines of expression; but\r\nhealth with its life and color finally came to silence the uttered\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nThere was a boy in the home who was subject to the severest headaches\r\nevery week, and who was much wasted in his body when he began: he had\r\nbecome robust and wholly relieved of all his ailings. There was a plump,\r\nrosy-cheeked girl of fourteen who for a year had taken only one daily\r\nmeal, and yet a better nourished body I never saw.\r\n\r\nNow in this family the only warm, general meal, and this a plain one,\r\nwas at noon. The evening meal was entirely of bread and butter taken\r\nwithout even a sitting at the table. What happy, healthy children they\r\nwere! And the mother was in a great deal better health to do all the\r\nwork of the kitchen: work, she strongly asserted, which was not nearly\r\nhalf of what it formerly was. For her there was a cure, a great increase\r\nof strength, and a great reduction of the most taxing of all the duties\r\nof the home-life.\r\n\r\nIf there is such a thing as an attack of disease, it cannot occur in the\r\nforenoon when there is an empty stomach and all the powers are at their\r\nbest for resisting disease; and where children are fed as these are,\r\ndisease, acute or chronic, is only a remote possibility.\r\n\r\nI belong to a family of seven; the oldest is beyond seventy, the\r\nyoungest beyond fifty. This No-breakfast Plan has been very closely\r\nadhered to with all for not less than twelve years, and during this time\r\nnot one of us has had any acute sickness; and I am not aware that any\r\nhave diseases of the chronic kind.\r\n\r\n    The accompanying illustration is that of Mrs. E. A. Quiggle,\r\n    sister of the Author, after twelve years' trial of The\r\n    No-breakfast Plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. E. A. QUIGGLE,\r\n\r\nChicago, Ill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utility of eating with thoroughness is strongly illustrated in the\r\nfollowing cases:\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Fletcher, the author and traveller, took to the\r\none-daily-meal plan to cut down his abnormal weight, having the patience\r\nto masticate all sense of taste from each mouthful before swallowing. I\r\nsaw him after he had been on this plan for some months: there had been a\r\nweight loss of some forty pounds; a nasal catarrh of many years had been\r\ncured, and he strongly asserted that in every way he felt himself\r\ntwenty-five years younger.\r\n\r\nHe had been living a week on baked potatoes for experimental reasons\r\nwhen I met him, and without experiencing any morbid sensations: a more\r\nperfect specimen of physical health I never gazed upon. To all\r\ndyspeptics who are willing to work for their health through pains and\r\npatience, his little work, _Glutton or Epicure_, is strongly\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nA dyspeptic from Vermont came to me who for ten years had eaten three\r\nhearty meals daily, none of which had ever satisfied his hunger. He was\r\nin a very low mental state when he came, and feeble in body: for fully\r\nten years both himself and physician had held the stomach accountable\r\nfor all its complainings, and with no thought of avoidable cause.\r\n\r\nI put him on one meal a day, as there was still some power of digestion,\r\nand with the following list for the daily bill of fare: baked potatoes\r\nwell buttered, bread and butter, beans dressed with butter, fish or lamb\r\nchops, and rice or oatmeal only if strongly desired; all sugar foods\r\ndebarred, and no drinks except water as thirst called for it between the\r\nmeals. The constipated bowels were permitted their own times for action.\r\nThe mouthfuls were small and far apart--like dashes between words--not\r\nless than forty-five minutes were spent in masticating. Very soon there\r\nwas a general rousement of new life in every way. His first surprise was\r\nin an unwonted sense of relish and a complete sating of hunger long\r\nbefore he had eaten the old-time amounts.\r\n\r\nThere was a fresh revelation to me in this, as I had not before been so\r\nimpressed that by slow eating the hunger-spell is also dissipated in\r\npart by time, and hence there is much less danger of eating to excess.\r\nHunger comes in part from habit, and it is appeased, with or without\r\neating, with equal completeness. The hunger-habit can be trained to come\r\nat almost any fixed time.\r\n\r\nNot long since I read of a farmer who kept his horses in apparently\r\nperfect condition on one feeding, and only at night: they had become so\r\ntrained that they had no desire for food until their labors were over.\r\nAt night they both ate and rested, and made good the waste of the day;\r\nthey were fully nourished and rested by morning, and could labor all the\r\nforenoon without loss of energy diverted to digestion: at noon they\r\nwould rest--become strong for the labors of the day.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that the strongest sense of hunger at\r\nthe regular eating-time could be dissipated by a fast not longer in\r\nduration than that of an ordinary meal-time.\r\n\r\nMy patient's bowels gave no hint of their locality until the eighteenth\r\nday, when they acted with little effort; on the twenty-fourth day again\r\nin a perfect way, and thereafter daily. The mind became ecstatic through\r\nperfect relief from mental and physical depression; there were no wants\r\nfor other than those simple foods, and at the end of a month he left me\r\nwith new views as to Nature's power of selection to meet her needs and\r\nof the vast utility of using both time and food to dissipate hunger.\r\n\r\nThe waste with most people is so small that the cost of the food, the\r\ncost of time in preparation, could be reduced to a startling fraction if\r\nthe need could be actually known, and the pleasures of the palate\r\nincreased by an inverse ratio. There is no redemption for women on the\r\nearth who have the care of kitchens except through simpler, smaller\r\nmeals--meals so very far apart that there shall be a maximum of the\r\nhunger-sense of relish and the resulting maximum of power to convert\r\nthem into tissues instinct with life.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the waste is so very trifling, especially with\r\nbrain-workers, that one may be a vegetarian, fruitarian, or even an\r\neater of pork, without positive violence to practical physiology. There\r\nis this further very practical consideration, that when Nature is so\r\nfairly dealt with that she can speak in natural tones she will call only\r\nfor those foods easily available along geographical lines.\r\n\r\nThere is this to be said about fruits, that all those containing acids\r\ndecompose the gastric juice, as they all contain potash salts in union\r\nwith fruit acids. As soon as they reach the stomach the free\r\nhydrochloric acid of the gastric juice unites with the potash, setting\r\nthe fruit acid free to irritate the stomach. There is never any desire\r\nfor acid fruits through real hunger, especially those of the hyperacid\r\nkinds: they are simply taken to gratify that lower sense--relish.\r\n\r\nThe tropical fruits are without acids, and therefore are well adapted to\r\na class of people who have only the least use for muscle and brains.\r\nAcid fruits can only be taken with apparent impunity by the young and\r\nold, who can generate gastric juice copiously. Because of the general\r\nimpression that they are healthful and no tax, human stomachs are\r\nconverted into cider-mills at will, regardless of between meal-times. By\r\ntheir ravishing flavor and apparent ease of digestion apples still play\r\nan important part in the \"fall of man\" from that higher estate, the\r\nEden without its dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we eat? The fig-leaved savage under his bread-fruit tree, the\r\nfur-clad Eskimo in his ice-hut, need not be asked: the needed food is in\r\nall due supply with little cost of muscle and less of mind--and he has\r\nno mental condition that can disturb the digestion.\r\n\r\nThe simpler waste-restoring foods have a flavor of their own that needs\r\nlittle reinforcement if developed by due mastication and with adequate\r\nhunger. In my own case butter duly salted seems to be my only natural\r\nappetizer aside from hunger; and yet I must own that at times new honey\r\nhas a wonderful effect on the mouth-glands.\r\n\r\nThe difference between eating from hunger and mere relish, as fruits and\r\nthe various sweetened foods are eaten, is a new study in dietetics, and\r\none more important can scarcely be conceived. It can hardly be\r\nintelligently studied without taking into due account this new\r\nphysiology. With rarest exceptions the need of food is estimated by the\r\nmere pleasure that comes from relish--that kind of relish that is\r\nevolved from the pies, puddings, ice creams, the last course in Sunday\r\ndinners, never taken until the limits of stomach expansion are nearly\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the external evidences of that general regeneration which comes\r\nthrough Nature will now be given. We will study the human face as we\r\nstudy the earth when the favoring conditions of Spring rouse all Nature\r\nto newness of life. The face shall be our human landscape.\r\n\r\nI select a face in which the eyes are dull from debility, in which there\r\nis no sparkle of soul, and beneath are the dark venus-hanging clouds.\r\nThe face has a dull, lifeless cast; the veins are all enlarged from\r\ndebility, and cover the larger arteries as with a mourner's pall, save\r\nwhere there are patches as of clouds on fire, where disease of the skin\r\nenlivens the drear landscape. There are pimples large and small, some\r\nwith overflowing volcanoes; there are no lines of expression: these are\r\nchanged to lines of morbid anatomy. We listen, and there are no echoes\r\nof departed joys; look as we will, and we see no evidence of the\r\nexistence of a soul.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate of this picture is death from unrecognized suicide; death,\r\na slow dying to every sense that made life worth living. There is this\r\nabout these deaths that go on through the months and years: they\r\nexaggerate the worst instincts of the soul as it is dragged down--down\r\nthrough brain-wasting largely avoidable if only understood.\r\n\r\nThe instant result of a total suspension of the use of the brain power\r\nin the digestive tract is the evolution of life: new life is sent to the\r\nremotest cell as by an electric charge. The nutrient vessels of the eye\r\ntone down in size, and there is polish, sparkle where there was only\r\ndimness; and on the face the venus clouds, black and red, begin to\r\ndisappear; the toning of the veins condenses the skin, and thereby the\r\nruddy arteries are uncovered, and a color that has life appears; the\r\npimples, the hillocks, even have a brighter look as they slowly shrink\r\nfrom sight. Finally, the skin becomes of a plush-like texture, soft,\r\ncondensed, and with tints that compare as the tints of flowers with the\r\nfaded colors of the house-painter, or as the matchless tint and plush of\r\nthe perfect peach to the spotted, colorless, wilted, degenerated\r\nrepresentative awaiting the garbage-barrel; and the cherry lips, the\r\ncherry gums, and the whiter teeth--Nature does not match them\r\notherwheres.\r\n\r\nLandscape gardening upon the human face has the largest, most inspiring\r\npossibilities; and there are no eyes so dull, no faces so void of light\r\nand life, no skin degraded to a parchment, for a public display of an\r\nassorted collection of evidences of physical poverty, in which these\r\nchanges to a higher life are not in some degree easily possible.\r\n\r\nFace culture becomes of the profoundest interest when it is realized\r\nthat whatever there is in eyes and lines of expression that reveals a\r\nsoul in higher life, whatever there is in softness and delicacy of\r\ntexture, in color that is alive with life, is only the external\r\nrevelations of the higher life within. Nature is always at work over her\r\nwaste places, whether about the roots in the mouth, or in the depths of\r\nthe organs; and the aches, the pains of the living, and the agonies of\r\nthe dying are only evidences of the earnestness and persistence of her\r\nefforts to right all her wrongs.\r\n\r\nIn what ways are drugs available in this kind of landscape culture; how\r\nsent through the crystalline structures of the eye with clearing effect;\r\nhow to polish the retina and the surfaces to a sparkle? What drugs for\r\nsuch culture? And yet the materia medica needs a hoist to place it on\r\nthe shelf. These external changes that become clearly apparent to even\r\ndull eyes are the changes that also go on in the very depths of diseased\r\nstructure, in all the special senses, in all those higher instincts and\r\ntastes that make man the best for self, for home, State and Nation--the\r\nimage of his Creator. Is this high estate ever reached through dosage?\r\n\r\nLet this matter be again considered. In the days of the lancet, roots\r\nand herbs, of bleedings and sweatings, of fevers without water for\r\nparched tongues, throats, and stomachs, Nature had no part in the cure\r\nof disease in the professional or lay mind, except in rare instances in\r\nwhich there were those specially gifted with insight as well as\r\neyesight.\r\n\r\nNow such barbarism was inflicted with intense force of conviction, and\r\nit was patiently endured with the largest faith. When a mere child I was\r\na witness of the bleeding treatment upon my mother of saintly memory,\r\nand my child hands carried into the back yard nearly a quart of blood\r\ndrawn for a bilious attack that lasted but a few days.\r\n\r\nThere is this to be taken into account in the dose treatment of\r\ndiseases--that most cases recover regardless of the time of treatment,\r\neven whether it is the most crucifying or whether there is no dosing.\r\nTherefore, the good effect of dosing is at best a matter of hazy\r\ninference, where real evidence is not possible. The lack of uniformity\r\nin the character and times of doses for similar diseases is a burlesque\r\non science. What would a text-book on chemistry be worth with nothing\r\nmore in the way of demonstrative evidence than we find in our materia\r\nmedica in the summing up of the \"medical properties\" of drugs.\r\n\r\nIn modern times homoeopathy has come in as a protest against the drawing\r\nof blood and the administration of drugs that corrode. For a form of\r\nskin disease sulphur has been given by the teaspoonful by my brethren of\r\nthe \"regular\" school; with equal faith, my brethren of the homoeopathic\r\nschool will give the fraction of a grain whose denominator will cross an\r\nordinary page: at which extreme is the science of dosage, if any; or\r\nwhere between? I can hardly resist the conclusion that faith in dosage\r\nis, by as much, inability for the deduction of science.\r\n\r\n\"I know whereof I believe,\" is the language of Science. \"I believe,\" is\r\nthe language of credulity--with all the ways back to cause too hazy for\r\nthe perception of even the assuring guide-boards. Said that prince of\r\nAmerican humorists, Artemus Ward, \"I have known a man who drank one\r\ndrink of whiskey every day, and yet lived to be one hundred years old;\r\nbut do not believe, therefore, that by taking two drinks a day you will\r\nlive to be two hundred years old.\" \"I have known a man who had not a\r\nsingle tooth, and yet he could play a bass drum better than any man I\r\never knew;\" but do not infer that the pulling of sound teeth will aid in\r\nbringing out all the possibilities of harmony, melody, and delicacy of\r\ntone of this particular instrument of song without words. I have seen a\r\nman seemingly in perfect health at one hundred years old who had eaten\r\nthree meals a day; but may I infer that on four meals a day he would\r\nhave lived to be one hundred and thirty-three and a third years old? A\r\nhundred times I have been told by physicians that they have had the best\r\nresults from certain drugs; but in not one instance was any reason for\r\ntheir faith advanced.\r\n\r\nIf I am to be governed by impressions as to the utility of what I may do\r\nfor the sick, what is more impressive than to draw blood as they of old\r\ndid, with recovery in most cases? Have we reduced the mortality of\r\ndisease by a change in dosage? If so, how much, apart from the better\r\nsanitary conditions of living and from those involved in the care of the\r\nsick?\r\n\r\nI can easily see or believe there is utility in clearing the digestive\r\ntract at an early date in the case of severe sickness; I know that\r\nstomach and bowels are as machines run by brain power; but beyond this\r\nthe materia medica is summed up in this way, \"I dose my sick: they get\r\nwell: therefore my treatment is successful; or if they die, it is the\r\nprovidence of God\"--and with no thought that it may have been the\r\nprovidence of bad treatment.\r\n\r\nMen and brethren of the medical profession, you believe me a heretic in\r\nall my professional modes, and only endure me because I do not carry\r\nviolent hands; but you would bar the sick-room from the bleeder of old.\r\nI may attack the lancet, the herbs, the ground-roots, whose doses were\r\nonly as kindling-wood and sawdust a little more refined, and you will\r\nsay \"Amen\" with emphasis. \"But we, we live in a more enlightened age:\r\nour doses are more refined\"--yes, but you administer them with the same\r\nforce of conviction as to their utility in the cure of disease, and with\r\nlittle thought as to just why they are given and how they act.\r\n\r\nIt is my present conception that feeding the sick as now very generally\r\npractised will be held, in a more enlightened age, as we now hold the\r\nlancet of a darker age--a twin relic of barbarism; and there will be\r\nonly wonder that attempts were ever made to convert the lower bowel\r\ninto a temporary stomach _thirty feet away_.\r\n\r\nHow discriminating this deputy stomach that it selects the predigested\r\nfood-ration from its unutterable lower bowel involvements; sending it\r\npure and undefiled as ready-made flesh into the blood, only requiring it\r\nto be placed as bricks to a wall. Fortunately, these lower stomachs are\r\nnot subject to nausea no matter how capable of otherwise rebelling, as\r\nthey so often do.\r\n\r\nPredigested foods! If they nourish the sick, why not feed the well; why\r\nnot abolish our kitchens at an immense saving in the time, expense, and\r\nworry of cooking, and live on them at an immense saving of the tax of\r\ndigestion and the indigestive processes? Brethren of the medical\r\nprofession, make haste to let the world know when you have found a case\r\nin which you have made use of the lower bowel so to nourish the sick\r\nbody that it did not waste while the cure was going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FASTING-CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nNOTES AND PRESS COMMENTS ON VOLUNTARY FASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first voluntary protracted fast for the cure of chronic ailing to\r\nreach the public prints as a matter of interesting news occurred in the\r\ncase of Mr. C. C. H. Cowan, of Warrensburg, Ill., early in 1899. He had\r\nbeen on the two-meal plan for a time, and wishing for something more\r\nradical wrote to me as to his entering upon a fast. I probably wrote him\r\nas I now find it necessary to write all who feel that fasts are\r\nnecessary and cannot have my personal care, \"Go on a fast and stick to\r\nit until hunger comes or until your friends begin to suffer the pangs of\r\nsympathetic starvation; then compromise with the sin of ignorance by\r\neating the least that will bring peace to their troubled souls.\"\r\n\r\nThe results were summed up by the _Morning-Herald Dispatch_, Decatur,\r\nIll., April 16, 1899:\r\n\r\n    \"A few years ago Dr. Tanner, in New York City, fasted for forty\r\n    days and forty nights, and all the world wondered. Up to that\r\n    time the feat was considered impossible. From day to day the\r\n    papers told of his actions and his condition, and the entire\r\n    people became deeply interested in the performance. Medical men\r\n    and scientists became interested in the performance, and the\r\n    laity watched the faster through curiosity. Tanner's\r\n    accomplishment was considered marvellous by the medical\r\n    profession and laymen alike, but Dr. Tanner has long since been\r\n    a back number, and his performance is not now regarded as\r\n    remarkable, although there are not many persons who would care\r\n    to attempt the fast. Tanner was simply trying to prove that the\r\n    thing could be done. He did it, and within a year the man who\r\n    held the attention of the people of the country for forty days\r\n    was a visitor to this city. What Tanner did has been more than\r\n    accomplished by a Macon County man, but he went about his\r\n    undertaking quietly, and the fact that he was fasting was known\r\n    to only a few of his friends. The man is C. C. H. Cowan, of\r\n    Warrensburg, and for forty-two days and nights he abstained from\r\n    the use of food in solid or liquid form. He began his fast on\r\n    March 2 and broke it on the evening of April 13 at supper-time.\r\n    With the exception of the loss of thirty pounds of flesh, which\r\n    materially changed his personal appearance, Mr. Cowan shows no\r\n    ill-effects of his undertaking. When he began he weighed one\r\n    hundred and sixty-five pounds, and when he quit he weighed one\r\n    hundred and thirty-five pounds. Before his fast he was inclined\r\n    to be fleshy, and now, while still in fairly good flesh, his\r\n    clothing manifests a desire not to hold close communion with his\r\n    body. Mr. Cowan was in the city Saturday, and some of his\r\n    friends did not know him. He related his experience to some of\r\n    them, but he did this cautiously, and with the oft-expressed\r\n    hope that the papers would not devote any attention to the\r\n    affair, because he was not seeking and did not want notoriety.\r\n    At different times during his fast the _Herald-Dispatch_ has\r\n    referred to the fact in short items. Cowan is a disciple of a\r\n    Dr. Dewey, living at Meadville, Pa., who is an advocate of\r\n    fasting as a means of curing many of the ills to which the body\r\n    is heir. Dr. Dewey has many pamphlets touching the subject, and\r\n    has also written some books for his belief, and his reasons have\r\n    been made so plausible that a number of persons have coincided\r\n    with him. Cowan says the efficacy of the treatment has been\r\n    established in many instances, a fact that he can prove by ample\r\n    testimony. During his long abstinence from food he had numerous\r\n    letters and telegrams from Dr. Dewey, encouraging him in the\r\n    undertaking. When asked why he had fasted, Cowan explained that\r\n    for years he had suffered from chronic nasal and throat catarrh\r\n    which would not yield to medical treatment. His appetite was\r\n    splendid, and he ate many things that he really did not want. He\r\n    read Dr. Dewey's ideas, and became convinced that his system\r\n    needed general overhauling, and that this could be accomplished\r\n    through faithful adherence to the theory of Dr. Dewey. One of\r\n    these theories is to the effect that fasting rests the brain,\r\n    which is ofttimes overworked as a result of heavy feeding. It is\r\n    also supposed that the body throws off old mucous membrane of\r\n    the stomach and bowels, and that these are immediately\r\n    supplanted by new lining. Believing that he could get rid of his\r\n    catarrhal trouble and get the new lining referred to, Cowan\r\n    decided to fast, and without noise about the matter he\r\n    commenced, and up to Thursday evening he did not allow a bite of\r\n    food to pass his lips. The only thing that he took was water. Of\r\n    this he did not drink much, and he claims that he suffered no\r\n    pain or pangs of hunger. Looking at the matter now, it does not\r\n    seem to have been much of an accomplishment. After he once got\r\n    started he said it was an easy matter to carry out his plan\r\n    except for the worry of his family and some of his friends. They\r\n    thought that he was losing his mind and tried to induce him to\r\n    relinquish his idea, but he took some of them under his wing and\r\n    reasoned with them on the beauties of the treatment, expounded\r\n    the strong points, gave them reasons, showed them testimony of\r\n    others, and kept on fasting. When he began he had no idea that\r\n    he would continue for forty days; but as he progressed he had no\r\n    desire for food, and therefore did not desist. Thursday evening\r\n    he began to feel hungry, and that night he ate a reasonably good\r\n    supper. The return of hunger, according to his theories, was the\r\n    signal of the return of health. He feels confident that his\r\n    stomach has been relined, and for the present he knows that his\r\n    catarrh has left him. He is a firm believer in the new method of\r\n    curing bodily ailments, and says that during his fast he was\r\n    able to be around the village of Warrensburg every day, and was\r\n    able to perform his duties. His abstinence from food apparently\r\n    has not weakened his constitution. Since breaking his fast he\r\n    has partaken sparingly of food. Cowan's friends are very much\r\n    interested in the recital of his experience.\"\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that during this fast much more than his ordinary business\r\ncame to him, and without the least inability to perform it. I saw him\r\nseveral months later, and found his physical condition seemingly\r\nperfect. He had found out that for the best working conditions a nap at\r\nnoon was better than even a light luncheon, and that one meal a day\r\ntaken after his business was over was the best practice. This fast was\r\nnot in the right locality to excite the attention it deserved.\r\n\r\nThe second voluntary fast was destined to reach the ends of the earth\r\nthrough the public prints. The following appeared in the _New York\r\nPress_ of June 6, 1899:\r\n\r\n    \"Twenty-eight days without nourishment and without letting up\r\n    for a moment on the daily routine of his business is the\r\n    unequalled record of Milton Rathbun, a hay and grain dealer at\r\n    No. 453 Fourth Avenue, and living in Mount Vernon. He is a man\r\n    of wealth, has many employes, and has been in the same business\r\n    in this city for thirty-nine years.\r\n\r\n    \"He fasted because he wanted to reduce his weight, fearing that\r\n    its gradual increase might bring on apoplexy. He succeeded in\r\n    his efforts. He weighed two hundred and ten pounds when he\r\n    stopped eating; when he resumed he tipped the scales at one\r\n    hundred and sixty-eight pounds, a loss of forty-two pounds of\r\n    flesh.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Rathbun's description of how he felt as the days and weeks\r\n    wore along and the pounds of avoirdupois slipped away one by one\r\n    is interesting. The remarkable point about it is that he\r\n    continued his work and kept well. He gave his account of it\r\n    yesterday to a reporter for _The Press_. Mr. Rathbun is known by\r\n    the business men for blocks around his own place of business,\r\n    and they all know of his fast.\r\n\r\n    \"Every day his friends would come in and talk to him about it.\r\n    At first they told him he was foolish; that nobody could fast\r\n    that length of time, much less continue his work without\r\n    interruption. Then as the days went on and he kept up without a\r\n    break they began to be frightened.\r\n\r\n    \"A crowd would gather about him every night at 6.30 o'clock,\r\n    when he would leave his office, for that was his hour for\r\n    weighing. Some days he would lose two or three pounds from the\r\n    weight of the day before; some days only one, but always\r\n    something. And as the record was scored up on the book each\r\n    night his friends would shake their heads and warn him to\r\n    beware.\r\n\r\n    \"Finally, on the fifteenth day, his friends and employes got\r\n    together and made up their minds that something had to be done.\r\n    They were afraid that Rathbun would die. They appointed a\r\n    committee to wait on him in his office and beg him to eat\r\n    something. The committee took dainties to Mr. Rathbun, told him\r\n    their fears, and offered the good things to tempt him, but all\r\n    to no purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"It was the night of April 23 that Mr. Rathbun took his last bit\r\n    of nourishment. He made no attempt to eat a large meal in\r\n    preparation for his fast. He ate his regular supply just as if\r\n    he had meant to continue eating on the following day. Then for\r\n    twenty-eight days he absolutely abjured all food. He drank\r\n    water, but that was all. Before going to bed he would take a\r\n    pint of Apollinaris.\r\n\r\n    \"Had he remained at his home in bed or taken perfect rest, his\r\n    achievement would have been less remarkable. That is the course\r\n    which always has been adopted by the professional fasters. Dr.\r\n    Tanner, and the Italian, Succi, in their fasts were surrounded\r\n    by attendants who allowed them scarcely to lift a hand, so that\r\n    every ounce of energy might be conserved.\r\n\r\n    \"Rathbun pursued a course diametrically opposite to this. He\r\n    worked, and worked hard. He came down earlier to his office and\r\n    went away later than usual. He made no effort to save himself.\r\n    On the contrary, he seemed determined to make his task as hard\r\n    as possible. On four of his fast days he spent the afternoons in\r\n    a dentist's chair, at which times his nerves were tried as only\r\n    dentists know how to do it.\r\n\r\n    \"It was his idea to continue the fast until he began to feel\r\n    hunger. After the first twenty-four hours his hunger\r\n    disappeared, and he had no desire for food until the end of the\r\n    fourth week, when the craving set in, and he immediately set\r\n    about satisfying it in a moderate and careful manner. He\r\n    consulted two physicians while the fast was going on, to see that\r\n    he was suffering no injury that he could not appreciate himself.\r\n    One was Dr. F. B. Carpenter, of Madison Avenue and thirty-eight\r\n    Street, and the other, Dr. George J. Helmer, of Madison Avenue\r\n    and Thirty-first Street. He saw Dr. Carpenter on the eighteenth\r\n    and the twenty-first days, and Dr. Helmer on the twenty-fifth\r\n    day. Both expressed surprise at his long fast and astonishment at\r\n    his excellent condition.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Rathbun is fifty-four years old, and five feet six inches\r\n    in height. He does not look more than forty years old, and he is\r\n    as active as a man of that age. He says he never felt better\r\n    than when he was fasting, and that he has experienced no bad\r\n    effects of any kind, while, on the other hand, he has reduced\r\n    his weight to a normal limit and removed all danger of apoplexy.\r\n\r\n    \"He got the idea of the fast from the new theory exploited by\r\n    Dr. Edward Hooker Dewey, a practising physician of Meadville,\r\n    Pa., who recommends fasting as a cure for many ailments, and\r\n    advises all persons to go without breakfast and eat only two\r\n    meals a day.\r\n\r\n    \"'I became intensely interested in this new system,' said Mr.\r\n    Rathbun yesterday, 'and I decided to put it to a practical test.\r\n    Dr. Dewey had said that he had many patients fasting all the way\r\n    from ten to thirty and forty days, and I concluded that if it\r\n    did them so much good it would be just the thing for me. So I\r\n    tried it.\r\n\r\n    \"'On April 23 I ate my last meal, and from then until May 24 I\r\n    had absolutely nothing to eat. I drank water, of course, for\r\n    that is a matter of necessity. One cannot do without drink; but\r\n    I took no nourishment. For the first twenty-four hours I was\r\n    very hungry, and would have liked very much to take a square\r\n    meal; but I resisted the temptation, and after the expiration of\r\n    one day I had no desire to eat.\r\n\r\n    \"'I had been in the habit of getting to my office about 8; now I\r\n    get there at 7. I generally had left at 5.30; I now stayed until\r\n    6.30. I had been in the habit of taking an hour or an hour and a\r\n    quarter for luncheon. The luncheon was now cut off, so I stayed\r\n    in the office and worked. I sat there at my desk and put in a\r\n    long, hard day's work, constantly writing.\r\n\r\n    \"'At night I drank a bottle of Apollinaris, and went to bed at\r\n    8.30 and slept until 4 in the morning. I never enjoyed better\r\n    sleep than in those four weeks. And I was in excellent condition\r\n    as far as I could see in every other way. My mind was clear, my\r\n    eye was sharper than usually, and all the functions were in\r\n    excellent working order.\r\n\r\n    \"'I had many amusing experiences. I went to a dentist on the\r\n    first day. I had some work requiring several hours' labor on the\r\n    part of the dentist. I said nothing to the doctor on the first\r\n    day. Four or five days afterward I kept a second appointment\r\n    with the dentist, and he asked me how the teeth worked which he\r\n    had fixed before. I said to him: \"I haven't tried them yet.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'You can imagine the look of surprise on his face. When I told\r\n    him that I was fasting, and had been since he had seen me\r\n    before, he showed the greatest concern, and said he did not\r\n    think I could go on with the dental work on account of the\r\n    weakness of my nerves. He solicited me to go out and have just a\r\n    bite of something. I refused, of course, and he continued the\r\n    work. I visited him on two days after that until he had finished\r\n    the work.\r\n\r\n    \"'The men in my employ were greatly concerned about me, and\r\n    thought I would break down. I used to weigh every night before\r\n    leaving the office, and as they saw my constant wearing away\r\n    they became more and more frightened, and finally appointed a\r\n    committee to wait on me. The committee was headed by my manager,\r\n    who begged me to eat. He brought along some fine ripe cherries\r\n    to tempt me. I told him I would not eat them for one thousand\r\n    dollars, for I was interested thoroughly in the fast by that\r\n    time and would not have stopped.\r\n\r\n    \"'After that they made no more attempts to stop the fast; but my\r\n    friends all shook their heads, and said that when I started in\r\n    to eat again I would find I was without a proper stomach.\r\n\r\n    \"'On the twenty-eighth day the hunger began to come on again,\r\n    and I began to eat under the advice of Dr. Carpenter. On the\r\n    twenty-ninth day I drank a little bouillon, and afterward from\r\n    day to day increased the amount of food to the normal. I\r\n    suffered no inconvenience.'\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Rathbun says he is a firm believer in the no-breakfast\r\n    system of hygiene advocated by Dr. Dewey, and that neither\r\n    himself, his wife, nor any of the servants in his house eat\r\n    breakfast, and as a result all are remarkably well. His two\r\n    sons, one of whom was graduated at Harvard in 1896, and a\r\n    second, who is still at Harvard, practise the no-breakfast\r\n    system.\r\n\r\n    \"Just before beginning his fast Mr. Rathbun ordered a suit of\r\n    clothes at his tailor's. He did not go for it until the end of\r\n    his long fast. Being something of a practical joker, besides a\r\n    man of great nerve, he walked into the tailor-shop and let the\r\n    tailor try his new suit on to see if it was all right.\r\n\r\n    \"When he slipped on the coat the tailor stood aghast. There was\r\n    apparently the same man he had measured twenty-eight days\r\n    previously standing before him in perfect health, but as to\r\n    dimensions not at all the same man.\r\n\r\n    \"'It doesn't fit any part of you,' said the tailor, after the\r\n    suit had been tried on. In the tailor's book Rathbun's\r\n    measurement was entered: 'Forty-three inches around the waist\r\n    and forty-two around the chest.' When he went for his suit his\r\n    measurements were thirty-eight around the waist and thirty-eight\r\n    around the chest.\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Dewey's theory, which led Rathbun to make his long fast, is\r\n    that the brain is the centre of every mind and muscle energy, a\r\n    sort of self-charging dynamo, with the heart, lungs, and all the\r\n    other parts only as so many machines to be run by it; that the\r\n    brain has the power of feeding itself on the less important\r\n    parts of the body without loss of its own structure, and that as\r\n    the operation of digestion is a tax on the brain, a long period\r\n    of fasting gives the brain a rest, by which means the brain is\r\n    able to build itself up, which means the upbuilding of the whole\r\n    body.\r\n\r\n    \"In this way, it is asserted, the alcohol habit is cured and\r\n    other diseases eradicated.\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. F. B. Carpenter said yesterday to a reporter for _The\r\n    Press_ that he had not recommended Mr. Rathbun to take the fast,\r\n    but had advised him while it was going on and after it was over.\r\n    The doctor said he was inclined to believe there might be\r\n    something in the no-breakfast system, as a great many persons\r\n    eat and drink altogether too much.\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Helmer said he had examined Rathbun on the twenty-fifth\r\n    day, and had found him in surprisingly good condition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rathbun had been on the no-breakfast plan for several years, and he\r\nwas one of the first to write me after my book came out. It was not\r\nwithout reason he feared apoplexy, for Ex-Gov. Flower, an over-weighted\r\nman, had gone down to instant death though seemingly in perfect health\r\nand in the prime of business energy and mental capacity. During his fast\r\nmy only trouble with him was in his drinking so much water without\r\nthirst, thus greatly and needlessly adding to the work of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nMr. Rathbun was so disappointed over the skepticism of New York\r\nphysicians as to the reliability of the fast that he determined to\r\nundergo a longer one under such surveillance as would enforce\r\nconviction. He was mainly actuated, however, to go through the ordeal in\r\nthe interests of science.\r\n\r\nAgain I had trouble with him on the water question, wishing him to drink\r\nonly as thirst incited. He was differently advised by an eminent Boston\r\nphysician, who, taking a great interest in the case, wrote him that he\r\nshould have great care to drink certain definite amounts for the\r\nnecessary fluidity of the blood. I had to respond that thirst would duly\r\nindicate this need; that in my cases of protracted fasts from acute\r\nsicknesses not one had been advised to take even a teaspoonful of water\r\nfor such reasons; that at the closing days before recovery of such cases\r\nthere was only the least desire for water, and this with no indication\r\nof need from the blood. Mr. Rathbun did not escape some trouble from\r\noverworked kidneys, and he became convinced that my theory and practice\r\nwere more in line with physiology.\r\n\r\nThis fast was made a matter of daily record by the leading New York\r\njournals, and he became such a subject of general interest that in\r\naddition to his ordinary business he was greatly overtaxed, and was\r\ncompelled to give up the fast on the thirty-fifth day, in part from the\r\nexhaustion of over-excitement.\r\n\r\nThis case was summed up as follows by the _New York Press_, February 27,\r\n1900:\r\n\r\n    \"Milton Rathbun has ended his long fast.\r\n\r\n    \"After thirty-five days, in which solid food or any liquid other\r\n    than water was a stranger to his palate, he became extremely\r\n    hungry on Sunday night. At first he resisted the longing to eat\r\n    and tried to sleep it off. But he awoke in a few hours hungrier\r\n    than ever, and then he decided he had fasted as long as was good\r\n    for him.\r\n\r\n    \"He ate a modest, light meal and went back to bed, only to awake\r\n    still hungry. Then he ate an orange, and was asleep again in a\r\n    jiffy. A bowl of milk and cream and crackers sufficed for his\r\n    breakfast, and at noon yesterday he enjoyed his first hearty\r\n    meal.\r\n\r\n    \"As he walked around the parlor of his home in Mount Vernon,\r\n    lighter by forty-three pounds than he was on January 21, this\r\n    man of fifty-five years and iron will said:\r\n\r\n    \"'I feel like a boy again. I think I could vault over a six-foot\r\n    fence.'\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Rathbun herself knows what it is to fast. For five years\r\n    such a thing as breakfast has been an unknown quantity in her\r\n    house, save when guests were present or for the servants. To\r\n    this abstinence Mrs. Rathbun attributes the curing of catarrh,\r\n    from which she had suffered previously. And as she and her\r\n    husband do, so do their two sons.\r\n\r\n    \"After the first few days of abstinence he had felt no desire to\r\n    eat until Sunday evening. Then he became hungry--ravenously so.\r\n    His first fast of a year ago--it was twenty-eight days then--had\r\n    taught him that sleep took away the longing for food, and, too,\r\n    he had said he would make his fast last forty days this time. So\r\n    he went to bed and to sleep.\r\n\r\n    \"But he awoke at 11 o'clock; he was hungrier than ever, and he\r\n    decided not to resist his inclination for food. Calling his wife\r\n    he asked her for an orange, and ate it; then he took another.\r\n    His next demand was for oysters, and a dozen large, juicy ones\r\n    disappeared rapidly, to the accompaniment of five soda crackers.\r\n    Then he drank about two-thirds of a cup of beef-tea, and some\r\n    Oolong tea. His appetite was not sated by any means, but he knew\r\n    the danger of overloading his stomach, so he stopped.\r\n\r\n    \"He soon was slumbering again, but he was wide awake at 2\r\n    o'clock in the morning. And his hunger was with him still. He\r\n    ate an orange to appease the craving, and again sought his\r\n    pillow. He slept again until 6 o'clock, and then, breaking some\r\n    crackers in a bowl of milk and cream, he ate again.\r\n\r\n    \"At noon a meal was served to the still hungry man. He began\r\n    with a little clam-broth; then came half a dozen steamed clams,\r\n    followed by a small portion of mock-turtle soup. Of a squab he\r\n    ate one-half, and with it some canned pease and fried potatoes;\r\n    while for dessert he had a little lemon ice.\r\n\r\n    \"'That was good,' he exclaimed, as he finished. The remark was\r\n    unnecessary; the relish with which he had eaten was convincing\r\n    testimony of his enjoyment. Asked why he had decided not to fast\r\n    for the full forty days, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"'I ate just because I was hungry.'\r\n\r\n    \"Asked how the weather affected him, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"'When I began there was a spell of cold weather, and I found\r\n    it rather hard to keep warm at night. But it soon passed away,\r\n    and I made it a point to wear the same underclothing and outer\r\n    garments as usual. Oh, yes; I did wear a different pair of\r\n    trousers. I had them made five years ago, but they were so tight\r\n    around the waist I could never wear them. They are as loose as\r\n    can be now, however.'\r\n\r\n    \"'From a scientific standpoint,' said Professor R. Ogden Doremus\r\n    yesterday, 'it is the most interesting and valuable experiment I\r\n    have known. Mr. Rathbun is a man of great nerve force. The very\r\n    fact that he attended to his business was what saved him, in\r\n    keeping his mind away from the thought of food. He could not\r\n    have done it had he been on exhibition or if he had remained at\r\n    home. If he had been at sea, in an open boat, he could not have\r\n    lasted more than ten days. He would have had nothing to think of\r\n    but his hunger.'\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. George J. Helmer, who has given no little attention to Mr.\r\n    Rathbun, said:\r\n\r\n    \"'I have examined him several times; I did so when his thirty\r\n    days were up. Well, it was remarkable. It's a wonderful\r\n    exhibition, that will attract the attention of the medical\r\n    world. His heart is as clear as a bell and his kidneys are\r\n    perfect. He is in absolutely rugged health. His temperature was\r\n    normal, his eye clear, and to-day, upon examination, any\r\n    insurance company would rate him as an A1 risk.'\r\n\r\n    \"Following is from the diary kept during his fast, and furnished\r\n    by Milton Rathbun to _The Press_:\r\n\r\n      \"_First Day_, Jan. 22, 8.45 A.

There had been five years' trial of the No-Breakfast\r\n    Plan before these fasting demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest things on earth as a mental operation is to be fair\r\nto the opposition. Now lest I have beguiled my readers overmuch by the\r\nforce of my convictions even to the point of danger, I will give an\r\nestimate of the danger of fasting by one of the most eminent physicians\r\nof New York City, Dr. George F. Shrady. I quote from an interview\r\nreported in the New York _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    \"The strange case of Milton Rathbun, of Mt. Vernon, who, to\r\n    reduce his flesh and generally tone up his system, is said to\r\n    have gone without food of any sort for thirty-six days, still\r\n    continues to be the subject of more or less discussion among the\r\n    medical men of the city. Dr. George F. Shrady, in speaking last\r\n    evening of Mr. Rathbun's remarkable exploit, said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. MILTON RATHBUN,\r\n\r\nSHORTLY AFTER HIS FAST.]\r\n\r\n    \"'There are three things to say about it. In the first place,\r\n    the fact, if it be a fact, as it seems to be, is astonishing;\r\n    secondly, it was very foolish; and thirdly, it would be a very\r\n    unfortunate and dangerous thing to popularize such experiments.\r\n    Now as to whether the gentleman in question actually did go\r\n    thirty-six days without taking nourishment of any sort is a\r\n    matter I will not discuss. If he were a professional faster, I\r\n    would hardly hesitate to say his claim was fraudulent, for I am\r\n    fully convinced that all the professional fasters are frauds.\r\n    They are simply adept sleight-of-hand men. They work out some\r\n    adroit trick by which they may get nourishment into their\r\n    systems in spite of the always more or less negligent or\r\n    suspicious watchers, and then advertise for a forty days' or\r\n    sixty days' 'fast.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'Now, mind you, I do not say this Mt. Vernon case is anything\r\n    of this sort. I only say that if it is true it is most\r\n    astounding. It is in flat contradiction of all the authorities\r\n    on the subject of a human being's ability to do without food.\r\n    The extreme limit of all well-authenticated cases of total\r\n    abstinence from nourishment is from nine to ten days. Imprisoned\r\n    miners have been known to go that time and survive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'But at all events it was a very foolish thing for Mr. Rathbun\r\n    to do. About that there can be no manner of doubt. What will be\r\n    the future effect upon him--upon his heart action, upon his\r\n    impoverished blood, upon his nervous system, upon his organs of\r\n    nutrition, necessarily paralyzed for days? These are grave\r\n    questions, the answers to which may be unpleasant to Mr. Rathbun\r\n    as they reveal themselves to him in the future. You cannot fly\r\n    in the face of Nature and ignore all her laws in that way with\r\n    impunity. She exacts her penalties and there is no court of\r\n    appeals in her realm.\r\n\r\n    \"'When I say that the extreme limits of abstinence from\r\n    nourishment in clearly authenticated cases is from nine to ten\r\n    days, you must not get the impression that all persons can last\r\n    that long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'It is a question of environment, of mental condition--whether\r\n    buoyed by hope or stimulated by ambition to do a great feat--and\r\n    above all, of course, of the physical condition of the faster.\r\n    Without food the body absorbs its own tissues. Mr. Rathbun, I am\r\n    told, was a very heavy man with a superabundance of tissue.\r\n    Naturally he could go longer without nourishment than a weak,\r\n    attenuated, thin-blooded man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'Yet Mr. Rathbun was exercising daily and about his usual\r\n    avocations, and he abstained from food for thirty-six days!\r\n    Well, it's remarkable!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'But I sincerely hope Mr. Rathbun will have no imitators. It\r\n    would be a very unfortunate thing, fraught with grave\r\n    possibilities, if the newspaper accounts of his reduction in\r\n    weight and general improvement in health were to move others to\r\n    follow his example. Many persons would be injured for life,\r\n    physically wrecked, and perhaps actually killed if they\r\n    conscientiously did the fifth part of what he is said to have\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'And right here it may be said that there is a great deal of\r\n    exaggeration in the sweeping statements made about people eating\r\n    too much. If a man sleeps well, goes about his business in a\r\n    cheerful frame of mind, and does not get what is called\r\n    \"out-of-sorts,\" he may be pretty sure he is not eating too much,\r\n    even though he eat a good deal. My observation is that the\r\n    average man who works and gets a proper amount of exercise does\r\n    not eat too much. If you want to get work done by the engine,\r\n    you have got to stoke up the furnace. If a man wants to keep his\r\n    vital energies up to par he has got to put in the fuel--that is,\r\n    the food.\r\n\r\n    \"'Of course, there are those who lead sedentary lives who get\r\n    too much absorbed in the pleasures of the table and overfeed.\r\n    There are a sufficient number of these, to be sure, but I think\r\n    they are the exception. But it will be a sad mistake if even\r\n    they seek a road to health by Mr. Rathbun's starvation\r\n    methods.'\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor is astonished, and so am I that he is astonished. This would\r\nseem to imply that he has never had cases of acute sickness in which the\r\namount of food taken during many days or even weeks was too small to\r\nplay any part as a life-prolonging factor.\r\n\r\n\"It was a foolish, even dangerous experiment.\" How foolish or dangerous?\r\nWhat vital organs suffered? Was there evidence of a loss of anything but\r\nfat? What organs were \"necessarily paralyzed\" during the fast? Evidently\r\nnot the brain, else longer days of labor would not have been possible;\r\nand the grave future possibilities in heart action, impoverished blood,\r\nnervous system, upon organs of nutrition \"necessarily paralyzed\" for\r\ndays; and the extreme limit of nine or ten days before death from\r\nstarvation; and that without food the _body_ lives on its own tissues!\r\n\r\nOne can easily see that the earnest doctor is full of strong impressions\r\nthat have little of the flavor of science: truth that is not\r\nself-evident should have the instant logic in easy reach. I may here say\r\nthat my hygienic scheme has from the first been subject to similar\r\nattacks by physicians from the standpoint of impressions, but no\r\nphysician has ventured into print against it after becoming aware of its\r\nphysiologic basis.\r\n\r\nI am happy to assure all readers that in all the involuntary fasts of my\r\ncases of acute sickness or in the voluntary fasts in chronic disease,\r\nhas there been any other than improved general health as the result.\r\nNotably was this the case in a man who fasted ten years ago for forty\r\ndays for an ulcer of the stomach, and who had been troubled with\r\nindigestion for more than forty years. He had become nearly a mental and\r\nphysical wreck when he took to his bed with an abolished appetite. There\r\nhave since been some ten years of nearly perfect health, and now in his\r\nseventy-seventh year he is the youngest-looking man for his age I have\r\never seen. He walks the streets with the gait of a youth of twenty. To\r\ndo without food without hunger does not tax any vital power, as Dr.\r\nShrady may yet become aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next fast to have a brief notoriety as the \"most remarkable on\r\nrecord\" occurred in Philadelphia, the medical center of America, and\r\nbeneath the very shadow of its great medical schools; in Philadelphia, a\r\ncity that surpasses all other cities for the wisest conservatism, for\r\nall-around level-headedness. Its journals are rarely equalled for their\r\nclean, winnowed columns; there is no \"yellow\" journalism in that great,\r\nfair city, known as the \"Quaker City.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Estella Kuenzel, a lady of twenty-two years, of acutest, finest\r\nsensibilities, born to live in June and not in March, lost her mental\r\nhealth to a degree that death became the final object of desire.\r\n\r\nShe had a friend in a bright young man of the name of Henry Ritter,\r\nchemist and photographer at the Drexel Institute, a born scientist, and\r\nwho possesses the very genius of the pains and persistence of science.\r\nWell versed in the science of the morning fast, he believed that a fast\r\nwhich would merely end with hunger would result in all-around\r\nimprovement. A fast was instituted which he thought would not last more\r\nthan a few days, but went on until the days merged into weeks: it went\r\non because only general improvement attended it.\r\n\r\nI first heard of it in a letter written by him on the thirty-eighth day\r\nof the fast, during which there had been a walk of seven miles. On the\r\nforty-second day of the fast I had a brief letter from Miss K., in which\r\nevery line was radiant with cheer.\r\n\r\nAt the Asylum five feedings per day were ordered, and at first were\r\nrejected; but finally she accepted them as a means to end her unhappy\r\nlife; took them in bed, and in the last weeks seemed to be fleshing up,\r\nas there was a gain of seventeen pounds above the normal, of water--she\r\nhad become dropsical. The last professional expert in her case advised a\r\nhalf-gallon of milk daily in addition to the three regular meals--making\r\na five-meal plan.\r\n\r\nTo carry out an unopposed fast it was necessary to take her to a home\r\nwhere the parents would be ignorant of this radical means to a cure.\r\n\r\nThe following is from Mr. Ritter's letters:\r\n\r\n    \"I had made my views known to the parents and daughter when the\r\n    case commenced, and after the failure of these methods they\r\n    decided to let me have charge of the case, which was on Sept.\r\n    30, 1899. I at once requested them to send her to the house of\r\n    some friends to whom I made my views known. We then discharged\r\n    the nurse who had gone with her. With doctor and nurse gone\r\n    there was free room for Nature's victory (the young lady being\r\n    as deeply interested as any). We put her upon the rest, which\r\n    was the only needed sign since her first signs of breakdown\r\n    appeared Oct. 2, at the supper table, being the last meal she\r\n    has taken up to to-day, Nov. 9, this being, as you will see, the\r\n    thirty-eighth day of her fast, with cheerfulness and strength\r\n    holding full sway. I put her to bed on the first day, to which\r\n    she kept, with an occasional day in the rocker, until the\r\n    eleventh day, when she took a walk of about one mile. Then she\r\n    rested indoors until the twentieth day, when we went to church,\r\n    walking a little over two miles, with no fatigue or tired\r\n    feelings. I forgot to mention that we had been out driving in\r\n    the bracing air for over three hours in the afternoon. On the\r\n    twenty-first and twenty-second days, indoors, walking and\r\n    working around the house, reading, etc. On the twenty-third day\r\n    walked through the country for three miles, stopping at friends\r\n    to enlighten them upon 'Nature's Laws;' twenty-fourth day, eight\r\n    miles, no fatigue; twenty-fifth day, between seven and eight\r\n    miles, no fatigue; twenty-sixth day, walked one and a half\r\n    hours; twenty-ninth day, rainy, no walks; thirtieth day, walked\r\n    in the evening for two and a half hours; thirty-first day,\r\n    walked seven miles, no fatigue; thirty-second day, rainy, no\r\n    walks; thirty-third day, went to the Exposition, walked all day\r\n    from 2 P. M. until 11.30 P. M. (with rest while at the\r\n    performance we attended of not over one and a quarter hours),\r\n    this being the only resting, possibly two hours, during the\r\n    whole time.\r\n\r\n    \"Weight taken at the start, one hundred and forty pounds; at the\r\n    Exposition one hundred and twenty-five and three-quarters\r\n    pounds; no sense of tired feeling, but hunger started to assert\r\n    itself for a period of about three hours, after which it passed\r\n    over.\r\n\r\n    \"On the thirty-fourth day went driving; thirty-fifth day, walked\r\n    one mile, then went to the asylum to show the results. The\r\n    physicians in charge were simply astounded, and would hardly\r\n    believe it possible for one to be so active while taking no\r\n    food. I believe we have done quite a little good there, as they\r\n    have expressed the desire to try the same on others. They\r\n    examined the tongue and took the pulse, finding both in good,\r\n    normal state; in the evening walked another mile, visiting the\r\n    other doctors whom her parents called in. On the thirty-sixth\r\n    day walked one and a half miles; thirty-seventh day, walked\r\n    seven miles, hunger sensation becoming decided.\r\n\r\n    \"I have given you a sketch of this case because it seems to me\r\n    an unusual one owing to the great activity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 \"November 18, 1899.\r\n\r\n    \"Miss Kuenzel's hunger arrived as per Nature's demand on the\r\n    forty-fifth day at noon. One poached egg and two slices of\r\n    toast (whole wheat). There was an intense relish for her simple\r\n    fare, but not the least sign or desire for haste in eating. She\r\n    was amply satisfied for the day, and relished the same bill of\r\n    fare and quantity for the forty-sixth day, with a very slight\r\n    luncheon in the evening. We had been to the Exposition the night\r\n    of the forty-fourth day, when the tongue again started cleaning\r\n    and a most distinct craving for food presented itself. It\r\n    persisted on retiring, and also on the next morning, when she\r\n    felt that Nature again was ready for her wonderful chemistry of\r\n    digestion. I had her weight taken after her first meal, which\r\n    revealed a loss of twenty pounds. We called to see the professor\r\n    under whom she was last placed, and he was surprised with the\r\n    clearness of her mental condition and good general appearance,\r\n    though he observed she had gotten a trifle thinner, but which he\r\n    had also in view to accomplish upon a five-meal plan per day. He\r\n    tried his best to confuse and trouble her with questions, etc.,\r\n    but found her too intensely awake, and she won the victory by\r\n    cornering him in his own set traps. We received his\r\n    congratulations and were made to promise to call again. I have\r\n    now been with her to seven physicians who were interested, and\r\n    have shown them Nature's own unhampered work.\r\n\r\n    \"Miss Kuenzel has now an intense desire to help others. You are\r\n    at liberty to make use of Nature's work in her case for the\r\n    benefit of others, and I shall be only too glad to give you any\r\n    desired information that may be of use. The good work you have\r\n    started will, I am sure, never end; and it will prove a pleasure\r\n    to me indeed to work with added interest for the benefit of\r\n    those in need of the same in the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe forty-fourth day of the fast was the busiest of all with her. She\r\narose at 8.30 A. M. to attend to her affairs until the late afternoon,\r\nwhen she and her friend met a sister, by appointment from her home, at\r\nthe Exposition. Several hours were spent there, and when they took the\r\nstreet car for return the only vacant seat was accepted by the sister,\r\nbecause she was tired, and not knowing that there were forty-four days\r\nwithout food with her sister, who was not tired. A striking feature of\r\nthese daily walks was that they did not cause marked fatigue. Miss\r\nKuenzel retired near midnight without unusual fatigue, and so ended the\r\nforty-fourth day of the fast.\r\n\r\nI quote from the _Chester County Times_ of Feb. 12, 1899:\r\n\r\n    \"'Conclusive evidence is being multiplied as to the wonderful\r\n    power of fasting in the restoration of health, but it is only\r\n    more recently that its power in the case of insanity is even yet\r\n    more wonderful. A recent case is as near home as the city of\r\n    Philadelphia, and those interested are very willing that others\r\n    may know of it, so that its usefulness may be extended and its\r\n    value appreciated. The discovery was made by Dr. E. H. Dewey, of\r\n    Meadville, Pa., and tidings of the good work are being spread by\r\n    Charles C. Haskell & Son, of Norwich, Conn. The editor of this\r\n    paper knows somewhat the value of the discovery by an experience\r\n    of several years. We give a letter from the lady who was cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 \"'PHILADELPHIA, PA., Dec. 12, 1899.\r\n\r\n    \"'_My Dear Mr. Haskell:_\r\n\r\n    \"'I have received your letter of the 9th inst., and at last find\r\n    time to fulfil the request for a statement. In regard to my\r\n    _wonderful cure_ through \"The New Gospel of Health,\" I would\r\n    state that the second week after Christmas, 1898, I first had a\r\n    paralyzing effect which affected the right side of face, body,\r\n    and limbs, also tongue, which nearly prevented my speaking. This\r\n    passed over and I again began working at my position as milliner\r\n    in a large establishment, and after a short while became so\r\n    dizzy and confused that I was compelled to ask my friends to\r\n    direct me home. (This was around Easter, 1899.) I was then taken\r\n    to a doctor, who at once requested me to stop working, and to\r\n    take a _complete rest_, but not for the stomach, as he\r\n    prescribed a severe and exacting master to stimulate the _tired\r\n    and overworked stomach_ to _renewed life_, and so give the\r\n    nerves plenty of pure food, as they were in need of same. I\r\n    then, after getting a ravenous hunger, weakened myself still\r\n    more and became worse. My stomach felt numb and paralyzed, as\r\n    did also my other internal organs, but this was put down against\r\n    me as an illusion. So a _professor of nervous diseases_ was\r\n    called in consultation, owing to my many desires to die (as life\r\n    had no sunshine, flowers, or music for me); I was simply living\r\n    a living death of torture which these professors would have were\r\n    illusions. My parents were then informed that I must be sent to\r\n    an asylum, where I was for ten long weeks. _They_ also told me\r\n    that my feelings were illusions, and proceeded to banish the\r\n    same by giving the _tired-out nerves a little rest_ and _plenty\r\n    of nourishment_ on a _five-meal_ plan per day. If refused (owing\r\n    to a loss of appetite), I was threatened to have nature helped\r\n    by the aid of a stomach or nasal tube. I lost none of my\r\n    illusions while there, as I could not feel any improvement in my\r\n    feelings. I left the institution June 28, 1899, feeling no\r\n    better; in fact, worse than when I arrived there. I was then\r\n    taken from one doctor to another, the one wishing to operate,\r\n    the other not; one advising me to go to the seashore, country,\r\n    etc., but _none_ to give my stomach the needed vacation.\r\n\r\n    \"'It was then that my friend, Mr. Ritter, stepped in, as he saw\r\n    the failures of professors and specialists, and begged my\r\n    parents to let him have a chance to demonstrate what Dr. Dewey's\r\n    method would do for melancholy illusions and tired-out stomachs\r\n    and nerves. I then went to friends, and, in entire ignorance of\r\n    my parents, began under directions of Mr. Ritter the most\r\n    natural, sensible, and cheapest of all cures. I began my fast on\r\n    Oct. 3, and broke the same on Nov. 16. During the first week of\r\n    my fast I was in bed; during the second (excepting the eleventh\r\n    day, when I took my first walk of seven-eighths of a mile) I was\r\n    in bed, in rocker, reading, etc. On the twentieth day, after a\r\n    drive of three hours, went to church, walking two and\r\n    one-sixteenth miles. I then stayed indoors again on the\r\n    twenty-first and twenty-second days, and then started taking\r\n    daily walks (weather permitting). I went out walking\r\n    twenty-three out of the forty-five days of my fast, and during\r\n    that time walked one hundred and twelve miles. This was besides\r\n    the carriage-drives, Exposition, and evening gatherings (walking\r\n    to same included). I did not in the least feel tired or weak,\r\n    but happier and brighter each day of the fast, as I could feel\r\n    the effects of a new life throughout my whole body. My mind also\r\n    became clearer and dizziness became a thing of the past. This\r\n    was indeed _joy supreme to me_, and life became once more a joy\r\n    instead of a burden. Sunshine, trees, flowers, etc., again made\r\n    an impression, and my parents, sisters, and friends are rejoiced\r\n    to see me in my happy normal state of health.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have gone through a year of unspeakable torture brought on\r\n    by overwork and _human-wise professors_; but at last, through\r\n    the wonderful teachings Dr. Dewey has given to mankind, and\r\n    through a friend, who was able to preach the \"New Gospel of\r\n    Health,\" am now well, strong, and happy. May God only help and\r\n    bless the many sufferers throughout the world (especially in the\r\n    asylums) with the rays of this Gospel. I have been saved, no\r\n    doubt, from a gloomy future, and may such be the realization of\r\n    many more unfortunate souls is the sincere wish through\r\n    experience of\r\n\r\n        \"'Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n            \"'ESTELLA F. KUENZEL.'\"\r\n\r\nThis case was summed up in the Philadelphia _Public Ledger_ of Dec. 25,\r\n1899, whose columns are guarded with unsurpassed care, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"One of those cases which a judicious editor ponders in no\r\n    little perplexity is that of a young lady who was taken out of\r\n    an insane hospital and subjected to a protracted fast, without\r\n    medical supervision, and with results that appear to have been\r\n    quite successful. On the one hand, there is the benefit that may\r\n    be derived by having the attention of the profession called to\r\n    the subject, with possibly good results; on the other hand,\r\n    there is the danger of having a lot of ignorant or impulsive\r\n    people risking their lives by starving themselves for this or\r\n    that real or fancied disease, forgetting the adage that a little\r\n    knowledge is a dangerous thing, especially in therapeutics.\r\n\r\n    \"The mind of the young lady referred to became affected about a\r\n    year ago, and after what was regarded by her parents as an\r\n    unprofitable period of treatment for two and a half months in a\r\n    hospital for the insane she has been apparently cured by\r\n    fasting--some would call it starvation. The case has been\r\n    attracting attention and discussion lately in a growing circle\r\n    that has included a few physicians.\r\n\r\n    \"The subject is a Miss K., aged twenty-two years. Henry Ritter,\r\n    who has charge of the Photography Department of the Drexel\r\n    Institute, and who is better acquainted with the matter than any\r\n    one else, furnished a _Ledger_ reporter with the particulars as\r\n    they are here given, the name and address of the young lady, for\r\n    obvious reasons, being omitted. Mr. Ritter was at first loath to\r\n    have any publicity given the case, but felt upon reflection that\r\n    the results were properly a subject matter for inquiry by\r\n    physicians, at least, not to speak of others who may be\r\n    interested.\r\n\r\n    \"Miss K., by the advice of specialists who had treated her at\r\n    home, was put under treatment for melancholy in an institution\r\n    for the insane. Mr. Ritter, being an intimate friend of the\r\n    family, visited her, and, he says, found her retrograding. She\r\n    was receiving three meals a day, with two luncheons between\r\n    them. Having built up his own digestive powers by following the\r\n    tenets laid down by Dr. Dewey, a Crawford county physician, he\r\n    had become a student and advocate of the latter's theory,\r\n    briefly stated, that no food should be given to a patient except\r\n    in response to a natural call or appetite for it. Believing that\r\n    no improvement could result from the course Miss K. was\r\n    receiving in the hospital, he prevailed upon her parents to\r\n    permit him to have her placed in the home of a friend, and\r\n    suggested the fasting process. This was the more readily done as\r\n    the physicians in whose care she had been advised her parents to\r\n    leave their daughter as much as possible among strangers.\r\n\r\n    \"This young lady, according to Mr. Ritter, was absolutely\r\n    without food for forty-five days, beginning October 3 and ending\r\n    November 16. He says he did not fear, as others did, that she\r\n    would starve, as the authority he depended on had never fed a\r\n    sick patient during a practice covering twenty-two years, no\r\n    matter how protracted the case might have been, and claimed to\r\n    have had only the best results. 'This,' said Mr. Ritter, 'is on\r\n    the theory that, since all bodily energy is the result of the\r\n    brain, by abstaining from feeding in the absence of appetite\r\n    there is all the energy of cure undiverted by needless waste in\r\n    the stomach. Feeding the sick, this physician contends, is a tax\r\n    on their vital power, adding indigestion to whatever other\r\n    troubles exist: because the brain has the power in sickness to\r\n    absorb nourishment from the body, as predigested food, so that\r\n    it never loses weight, even in death from starvation.'\r\n\r\n    \"The patient herself became interested, Mr. Ritter says, and\r\n    evidenced great relief from abstinence from enforced periodic\r\n    feeding. Gradually a numb feeling of which she had complained as\r\n    affecting her internal organs, and which had been ascribed to\r\n    her illusions, left her, and she appeared to gain daily in\r\n    strength and brightness. Mr. Ritter's narrative proceeds:\r\n\r\n    \"'On the eleventh day of her fast a walk was suggested, and she\r\n    covered about seven-eighths of a mile; on the twentieth day she\r\n    was taken for a carriage drive of three hours in the afternoon,\r\n    and in the evening she walked to church and back, a distance of\r\n    something more than two miles. From the twenty-third day she\r\n    took walks daily, excepting on October 31 and November 3, when\r\n    rain prevented. She visited friends and the theatre and the\r\n    Exposition, went to church several times, to the hospital where\r\n    she had been a patient--this on the thirty-fifth day of her\r\n    fast--and to the Drexel Institute on the thirty-ninth and\r\n    forty-second days. A table of dates shows that she walked from\r\n    two or three to six and eight and as high as nine miles a day\r\n    during the period of forty-five days that she abstained from\r\n    food, with a general increase of strength and cheer and no sign\r\n    of fatigue. Hunger sensations were marked on the forty-fourth\r\n    day and night, and on the morning of the forty-fifth day Miss K.\r\n    broke the fast by eating a poached egg and two slices of\r\n    buttered whole wheat toasted bread.\r\n\r\n    \"'During her fast she was seen by seven physicians and medical\r\n    professors, President MacAlister and professors of the Drexel\r\n    Institute, and many others.'\r\n\r\n    \"The young lady's weight at the beginning of the fast, Mr.\r\n    Ritter says, was one hundred and forty pounds, and just after\r\n    the meal with which she broke the fast she weighed one hundred\r\n    and twenty pounds. By December 15 she had regained nine pounds,\r\n    meanwhile eating one meal daily and sometimes two, with an\r\n    occasional light luncheon.\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Chase, medical director of the institution above referred\r\n    to, was visited on Saturday by a _Ledger_ reporter in regard to\r\n    the case of Miss K. He had been informed of her long fast and\r\n    of its results, and had seen Miss K. herself when she called at\r\n    the asylum on the thirty-fifth day of the fast. He said that\r\n    when she was first brought to the asylum she was suffering from\r\n    melancholia, and was put under the treatment which all the\r\n    leading alienists had found most beneficial for persons\r\n    suffering from nervous disorders, viz., quiet, rest of mind and\r\n    body, and full, nourishing diet, carefully selected to produce\r\n    the best results. During the time she remained at the asylum she\r\n    improved both in bodily and mental health.\r\n\r\n    \"Referring to the treatment she had received under Mr. Ritter's\r\n    supervision since leaving the asylum, Dr. Chase said he had\r\n    first heard of the system through a work published two years ago\r\n    by Dr. George S. Keith, of London, from which he first learned\r\n    of Dr. Dewey, who also uses the fasting cure. In all the cases\r\n    cited by Dr. Keith none had been afflicted with any mental\r\n    disorder. He looked upon the cases, however, as showing some\r\n    remarkable results, warranting a careful study. But it would not\r\n    do to adopt such a system without a most thorough examination.\r\n    As 'one swallow does not make a summer,' neither will one case\r\n    nor half a dozen cases cured by such a method prove anything. No\r\n    universal method can be adopted for treating disease. Hardly two\r\n    cases are alike. Cures also may be brought about in different\r\n    ways if the exact condition of the patient is understood.\r\n\r\n    \"'Mr. Ritter says the patient lent herself very willingly to the\r\n    treatment, which was a great deal to start out with in her case.\r\n    But I am surprised that a young man with no medical knowledge\r\n    would do a thing like that. The treatment might easily have\r\n    resulted differently. If he had been a doctor, he would have had\r\n    that fact to sustain him in case he got into trouble. The case\r\n    might very well have resulted fatally, because the treatment was\r\n    so contrary to what would naturally be pursued by physicians in\r\n    nervous cases.\r\n\r\n    \"'I do not ridicule the system. There have been cases which were\r\n    cured by ways not recognized by the general practitioner after\r\n    they had been given up. I am a firm believer that in selected\r\n    cases the fasting method would be efficacious, but I do not\r\n    believe in its general application.\r\n\r\n    \"'Mr. Ritter is evidently an enthusiast, and apt to overstate\r\n    the points in favor of the method, neglecting those which tell\r\n    against it. It is too early yet to say what the outcome of Miss\r\n    K.'s case will be. I think the matter ought to be looked into\r\n    more fully. Mr. Ritter could not have been with the patient at\r\n    all times. It is a remarkable thing that she should have kept up\r\n    and had the strength reported, unless she had some food. He may\r\n    have been deceived in that.'\"\r\n\r\nDuring several months since the fast there have been the best physical\r\n_health_ and mental condition, the weight having increased several\r\npounds above the former average.\r\n\r\nMr. Ritter conducted this case in a blaze of publicity. He showed it to\r\nno less than seven physicians, some of whom were college professors, and\r\none of them at near the close of the fast suggested that if food were\r\nnot soon taken a sudden collapse would be the result. There seemed to\r\nhave been less danger of this calamity on the forty-fourth day than on\r\nany other.\r\n\r\nThe reliability of the fast was so clearly evident that the leading\r\npapers of the city accepted it as authentic news and of the most\r\nstartling kind. _The Times_ gave several columns of its first page to an\r\nillustrated article.[1]\r\n\r\n    The accompanying illustration shows Miss Kuenzel on the\r\n    forty-first day of her fast. She walked seven miles on this day\r\n    without any signs of fatigue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyrighted 1900, by Henry Ritter.\r\n\r\nMISS ESTELLA F.

The following account of it appeared in the _North American_,\r\none of whose editors had personal knowledge of its history:\r\n\r\n    \"Leonard Thress, of 2618 Frankford Avenue, has learned how to\r\n    live without eating. By physical experience he has proved not\r\n    only that food is not a daily necessity of the human system, but\r\n    that abstinence therefrom for protracted periods is beneficial.\r\n    Indeed, it saved his life. He has just finished a fifty days'\r\n    fast. When he began it he was on the brink of the grave and his\r\n    physicians had abandoned hope. When he ended it he was in better\r\n    health than he had enjoyed for years, although in the meantime\r\n    he had lost seventy-six pounds, falling away from two hundred\r\n    and nine to one hundred and thirty-three pounds.\r\n\r\n    \"Thress, who is about fifty-seven years old, was attending the\r\n    Grand Army Encampment at Buffalo in the fall of 1898, when he\r\n    caught a violent cold, which settled in his bronchial tubes. It\r\n    proved so stubborn that his general health became affected, and\r\n    a year later dropsy developed. His condition grew steadily\r\n    worse, and at Christmas time, 1899, it was such that he could\r\n    neither walk nor lie prostrate, but was compelled to sit\r\n    constantly in an armchair. His doctors exhausted their skill in\r\n    the effort to bring relief, and eventually, in the early part of\r\n    last January, they told him that their medicines refused to act,\r\n    and that his death was a question of only a few days.\r\n\r\n    \"Up to this time Thress had been subsisting on the meagre diet\r\n    permitted to a man in his condition, but his stomach rebelled\r\n    even at that. He had heard of the Dewey fasting cure and its\r\n    boasted efficacy against all human ills, and, though he had\r\n    little faith, death was already looming before him, and he knew\r\n    that he could lose nothing by the experiment.\r\n\r\n    \"He began to fast on January 11 by taking in the morning a\r\n    portion of Henzel's preparation of salts in a glass of water and\r\n    the juice of two oranges, and in the evening a hot lemonade. For\r\n    twenty-five days he also drank a teaspoonful of a tonic\r\n    consisting chiefly of iron, but the rest of the diet he\r\n    continued until two weeks ago, when he discontinued the salts\r\n    and orange juice and confined himself to a hot lemonade at\r\n    morning and evening. This was his only sustenance until last\r\n    Thursday.\r\n\r\n    \"According to Thress's own recital, the effects of this course\r\n    of treatment were amazing. He says that the natural craving for\r\n    food was gone after the first day. Three days later he had\r\n    regained so much strength that he was able to go upstairs to\r\n    bed and enjoyed a good night's sleep. From that time on,\r\n    although he steadily lost in weight, his vitality grew greater,\r\n    and on January 22 he left the house and took a half-mile walk.\r\n\r\n    \"Before three weeks of his fast had elapsed his dropsy had\r\n    disappeared, and thereafter he took almost daily walks,\r\n    increasing the distance with his strength. Some days he covered\r\n    as many as five miles, and never less than two, even while he\r\n    was growing thinner and thinner, as the accompanying table\r\n    shows.\r\n\r\n    \"For the first time since the beginning of his fast he became\r\n    hungry last Thursday, March 1, and he felt that he should like\r\n    some pigs' feet jelly. It is one of the prescriptions of the\r\n    fasting cure that when hunger finally comes the patient shall\r\n    eat whatever he craves, so Thress consumed two slices of the\r\n    jelly and one piece of gluten bread, with butter. He says he\r\n    enjoyed it and felt well afterward.\r\n\r\n    \"He ate no more that day, but at noon yesterday he became hungry\r\n    again, and this time his appetite was for something more\r\n    substantial. He disposed of a dish of mashed potatoes, some red\r\n    cabbage, another portion of pigs' feet jelly, apple sauce, and a\r\n    cream puff for dessert. He even smoked a cigar after the meal,\r\n    enjoyed it, and felt still better.

H. Potts, Editor of the _Chester County Times_, a man who has the\r\nlargest faith in eating only to restore the wastes of the body, thus\r\ngives vent to his emotions after seeing the case by invitation of Mr.\r\nRitter:\r\n\r\n    \"On January 10 there sat in his home, at 2618 Frankford Avenue,\r\n    Philadelphia, Mr. Leonard Thress, with dropsy, hopelessly given\r\n    up to a speedy death by the many physicians he had vainly sought\r\n    and paid well for relief. His weight was two hundred and nine\r\n    pounds. His limbs were at the bursting point, and the water was\r\n    close up to the top of his chest. He could not lie down nor even\r\n    lay his head back without choking, and to walk across the room\r\n    completely exhausted him. At that critical moment a friend of\r\n    his heard of Miss Kuenzel's miraculous cure, and told him of it.\r\n    He at once sent for Mr. Ritter, who thought that a cure was in\r\n    his reach, and on January 11 Thress commenced a fast that has\r\n    been absolute up to yesterday, the only things passing his lips\r\n    being water, a little lemonade, and rarely the juice of an\r\n    orange. Learning through the _Chester County Times_ that we were\r\n    interested in Dr. Dewey's discovery, he invited us to come and\r\n    see the cases now under his care, and on Friday of last week we\r\n    gladly availed ourselves of the opportunity to see the living\r\n    proof of what we believed but had never seen. We were very\r\n    cordially received at Mr. Ritter's home, and instead of meeting\r\n    a pompous, egotistic, big man, as we might expect, we met a\r\n    young gentleman of small stature, like ourselves, modest,\r\n    retiring, and claiming no credit for his own part in these\r\n    remarkable cures; but insisting that he is only observing the\r\n    progress of cases, following in the line of truths discovered\r\n    only by Dr. Dewey, giving such advice as he is enabled to do\r\n    from his thorough knowledge of chemistry, anatomy, and hygiene.\r\n    He took us to the house of Mr. Thress, and the startling\r\n    impressions we received can never be effaced. We seemed to be in\r\n    the presence of one who had arisen from the dead, and could not\r\n    realize the truth of what we saw and heard from him and his\r\n    estimable wife, who shows the happiness she feels in receiving\r\n    her husband back to life. Impossible as it seems, yet on the\r\n    previous day, as well as many other days, that man had walked\r\n    three miles after six hours given to his business as a baker,\r\n    which he now attends to personally. All traces of dropsy have\r\n    disappeared, and his weight is now less than one hundred and\r\n    thirty-five pounds, having lost this nearly seventy-five pounds\r\n    of water through the natural channels at the rate of five or six\r\n    pounds per day at times. His eyesight has grown younger and his\r\n    hand is firm. He sleeps soundly several hours out of each\r\n    twenty-four, and is almost a cured man, although the curative\r\n    action is still going forward throughout his system, and his\r\n    many friends are now awaiting the arrival of his normal healthy\r\n    appetite, which in these cases does not arrive until the cure is\r\n    entire, and then it comes in such a way as not to be mistaken.\r\n    On Monday of this week we again visited him, taking a friend who\r\n    has long suffered similarly to what he did, that she might see\r\n    results for herself. We found him looking even better than on\r\n    Friday, and it is very interesting to hear him tell his\r\n    experience, which he will be glad to impart to those who are\r\n    seeking after the truth, and interested in the cure of disease\r\n    of themselves or their friends by this natural and without price\r\n    (but priceless) means. We also visited two other of the five\r\n    cases over which Mr. Ritter is at present keeping watch, and\r\n    every one bore evidences of the great truth. No one should\r\n    undertake the fast on their own responsibility, as certain\r\n    conditions may arise requiring the eye of one who has made the\r\n    matter a study, and no one should pass an opinion on the matter\r\n    until they read Dr. Dewey's _New Gospel of Health_, wherein the\r\n    reasons are made so plain that all can understand.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyrighted 1900, by Henry Ritter.\r\n\r\nMR. LEONARD THRESS,\r\n\r\nFIFTIETH DAY OF FAST.]\r\n\r\nMr. Thress has regained his normal weight and has been in the best of\r\nhealth in the several months since the fast.[2]\r\n\r\nThe following case was deemed a miracle by all friends: Mrs. H. B., a\r\nwoman of seventy-six, became exceedingly breathless, due, it was\r\nsupposed, to defective heart action that had been chronic for many\r\nyears. The final result was general dropsy. The eyelids had become so\r\nheavy that reading could be indulged only a short time because of their\r\nweight; the throat was also charged with water so as to make swallowing\r\ndifficult. Beneath the eyes and jaws were pockets of water--in short,\r\nthe skin of the entire body was distended, a condition that had deceived\r\nthe friends as revealing only an increase of her natural stoutness. The\r\nreal condition became known through a call to treat a bad cold.\r\n\r\nWhat had authorized medical art to promise in such a case? Absolutely\r\nnothing, as she had become too old and weak to be subjected to the\r\nordinary means for such a general condition. As for a fast for one so\r\nold, that was the last thing that would have been thought of: her age\r\nand debility would only have seemed to invite more daily food than she\r\nhad been taking.\r\n\r\nShe was put on a fast, or rather the fast was continued, the cold\r\nhaving abolished her appetite. It went on until the fifteenth day, with\r\nincreasing general strength and diminishing weight. The last days before\r\nhunger came she was able to go up a long flight of stairs without the\r\naid of the railing and without marked loss of breath, the heart-murmur\r\nhad nearly disappeared, and water by the gallon seemed to have been\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth day there was a desire for food, that was taken with\r\nrelish through the enlarged throat without difficulty; the water pockets\r\nhad become emptied, and the lids so thin and light as to reveal no\r\nfatigue in reading. Thence on one meal a day became the rule; and since\r\nthere have been five years without any recurrence of the\r\nconditions--five years of remarkable general health and girl-time relish\r\nfor her daily food.\r\n\r\nHow often has the cutting down of the daily food by the old and weak\r\nbeen condemned as too severe an ordeal to be safe! For this woman there\r\nhave been these acquired years of nearly perfect health, and the end\r\nwill be in the natural, easier death of old age.\r\n\r\nThe following is inserted as additional evidence of Nature's power over\r\ndisease, and that brain-workers may go on with their labors with\r\nincreasing power while waiting for natural hunger in cases in which\r\nhunger is possible:\r\n\r\n    Rev. C. H. Dalrymple, of Hampden, Mass., has just completed a\r\n    fast, of which he says, February 5, 1900: \"My fast continued\r\n    thirty-nine and one-half days. My appetite came on me about 9\r\n    o'clock at night, and I thought I would wait until the next\r\n    day; but two boiled eggs and some dry toast would not retire\r\n    before my presence. I have never had such an assault upon my\r\n    will power as that imagined egg and toast made on me. I was\r\n    finally compelled to surrender. My tongue had been clearing up\r\n    that day, and the next day I was hungry at noon. I have not\r\n    missed a first-class appetite at noon since. My tongue has kept\r\n    clear and my taste has remained sweet. I have had no chills nor\r\n    fevers this winter, nor cold in any form. I have made no\r\n    allowance for my sickness and have never worked harder. My flesh\r\n    came back rapidly, and now I think I must weigh about fifteen\r\n    pounds more than last summer. _I gained strength beyond all\r\n    question about three weeks before my appetite returned. I would\r\n    work all day long finally._ It was good to get well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ritter conducted over twenty cases, some being able to carry on\r\ntheir usual avocations. I give the most important ones: Mr. A. H.,\r\nforty-five days; Miss B. H., forty-two days; Mrs. L., thirty-eight days;\r\nMr. L. W., thirty-six days; Miss L. J., thirty-five days; Mrs. M.,\r\nthirty-one days; Miss E. S., twenty-six days; Mr. G. R., twenty-five\r\ndays; Mr. P. R., twenty-four days; and Miss E. Westing, forty-two days,\r\nwho, on the fortieth day, was able to sing with unusual clearness and\r\npower, and ended her fast without losing a day from her duties as a\r\nteacher of music.[3]\r\n\r\nWonderful are these fasts? Not in the physiological sense. These fasts\r\nwent on with only increasing comfort by day and more refreshing sleep\r\nat night. It is quite another thing to endure the fasts of acute\r\nsickness, for such they all are. That life is maintained for days and\r\nweeks, even months, under pain, discomfort--under all the torturing\r\nconditions of such diseases as pneumonia, typhoid fever, or inflammatory\r\nrheumatism, is far more a matter to wonder over.\r\n\r\nI may well wonder that Nature is powerful enough to cure the sick at all\r\neven under the wisest aid; but with me the abiding wonder is that\r\nphysicians do not see that acute sickness is a loss of all the natural\r\nconditions of digestion, with the wasting bodies the clearest evidence\r\nthat food is neither digested nor assimilated. I wonder with only\r\nincreasing impatience that the stomach is not understood as a machine\r\nthat Nature wills shall not be run to tax her resources when life is in\r\nthe throes of disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyrighted 1900, by Henry Ritter.\r\n\r\nMISS ELIZABETH W. A. WESTING,\r\n\r\nFORTIETH DAY OF FAST.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The fasts conducted by Mr. Ritter constitute performances of the\r\nmost impressive kind as demonstrative evidence of the practical\r\nphysiology I have been teaching for many years. For the copyrighted\r\nphotographs he has kindly furnished I am very thankful, and to all who\r\nhave been willing to enhance the value and interest of this volume by\r\nsuch eyesight illustrations.\r\n\r\n[2] The accompanying illustration shows Mr. Thress on the fiftieth day\r\nof his fast; weight loss, seventy-six pounds. Does the picture reveal\r\nany skeleton condition?\r\n\r\n[3] The accompanying illustration is a reproduced copyrighted picture of\r\nMiss E. Westing. This picture was taken on the return home from her\r\nduties at church on the fortieth day during the cold of winter; the\r\nweight at the start being one hundred and ten pounds, at the close on\r\nthe forty-second day ninety-three pounds--loss, seventeen pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not been long engaged in observing the evolution of cure through\r\nNature when I began to suspect strongly, as before intimated, that\r\nfasting is the true \"medicine for the mind diseased.\" Not less evident\r\nthan the cure of various ailings would be the emergence of the soul into\r\nhigher life, and in some instances from the depth of despair. As the\r\nscope of my vision constantly enlarged through multiplying experiences,\r\nI began to see great hopes of the cure of the gravest of all\r\ndiseases--insanity--through a rigid application of this method in\r\nNature. I gave the matter so much thought and study that I wrote a\r\nmonograph on the subject with the idea of publishing it, but gave it up\r\nto the idea of telling my impressions in \"The No-breakfast Plan.\"\r\n\r\nThere are the same structural changes in the evolution of insanity as in\r\nthat of catarrh. There is a morbid structural basis in minds diseased,\r\nthe abnormal mentality or morality being merely symptoms of a physical\r\ndisease. Of all human legacies, structural weakness of the mental or\r\nmoral sense is the most unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more about the forms of mental disease than that there is\r\ndistinctively both intellectual and moral insanity as a direct result\r\nof disease of the intellectual and moral centres. This will be more\r\nclearly seen when I recall the fact that moral insanity in its worse\r\nform--the suicidal--often exists with such intellectual clearness that\r\nthere is the greatest ingenuity displayed in carrying out\r\nself-destruction. These mind and soul centres are often gravely diseased\r\nwithout impairment of muscle energy: the furious strength of the insane\r\nis an abiding fear with all.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that weakness of structure so soft as brain, a substance\r\nwhich is on the dividing-line between liquids and solids, must be of the\r\ngravest form from the first: grave because so fragile, grave because the\r\nsick centres cannot rest as the broken arm, the sick body: these\r\ncentres, regardless how sick, must continue to serve, even in abnormal\r\nways.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of insanity must always be a matter of the degree of the\r\nprimary structural weakness and the energy and persistence of the\r\noperative forces; on these must depend the mere gentle, persistent\r\nillusion, or that fury of mania which transforms man, the \"image of the\r\nCreator,\" into a wild beast. That insanity, no matter what its form or\r\ndegree, is an evolution from an ancestral structural legacy, not\r\nessentially different from the structural conditions evolved from those\r\nof any other chronic disease, I cannot have the slightest doubt, any\r\nmore than I can have for the structural means for the cure.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that so illustrates the civilization, the benevolence\r\nof the age and of the nations as these palaces we call hospitals for the\r\ninsane. Whatever there is that can add comfort to the body, or charm to\r\nthe tastes, or new life to the soul has its culmination in these palaces\r\nof wood and stone, with one great exception: the structural condition of\r\nthe diseased centres indicating rest, even as the ulcer, wound, or\r\nfracture, has no part in the methods of cure.\r\n\r\nThe feeding is all done not at the time of hunger, but at the time of\r\nday. All patients are expected to eat no less than three meals a day,\r\nregardless of any desire for food and whether the patient spends all his\r\ntime in bed in mindless apathy, whether pacing his room with meaningless\r\ntread, whether active in light service in the building or in heavy labor\r\nwithout. When there is refusal to eat it seems to be taken for granted\r\nthat suicide by starvation is the design, and the pumping of food into\r\nthe stomach through the nose is the common resort. There seems to be no\r\nthought that there may be no hunger in such cases, and no apprehension\r\nof any danger from not eating; that in this they follow the instincts of\r\nbrutes. Would the desire for food not come and with a saner condition of\r\nmind if they were permitted their own ways of eating?\r\n\r\nA physically strong woman, whom I knew well, was sent to a hospital for\r\nthe insane in a generally bad state of mind, with destructive\r\npropensities marked. With no desire for food, and certainly with no mind\r\nto realize the need to eat without hunger, she naturally refused to\r\neat. But for a time her meals were forced down her throat, a proceeding\r\nthat taxed the strength of several strong arms.\r\n\r\nWhy were the meals not omitted long enough to cause such a reduction of\r\nstrength as to make feeding less expensive in the outlay of others'\r\nmuscle? The persistent refusal to eat resulted in a cessation of all\r\nefforts to enforce food; left to the gentler hands of Nature for a time,\r\nthe mental hurricane subsided in great degree on the return of hunger,\r\nand long before there was an appreciable loss of weight or strength. In\r\na few months this woman was able to return to her home, and with\r\nrestored mind to tell me of the violent feedings she had endured.\r\n\r\nNow let us look again to the structural conditions involved in diseases\r\nof the mind. There are those soft, pulpy centres from which emanate the\r\nhighest powers of life: power to think, to admire, to rejoice, or to\r\nsuffer; and we know how digestive power varies along the scale between\r\necstacy and despair. In mental disease there is the same abnormal\r\nstructural change as in other local diseases; but for these sick\r\nmind-centres there is no rest. There must be still thinking and feeling,\r\nno matter how chaotic, to tax them, and there is no cheer to electrify\r\nthe stomach into easy display of power. We may well marvel that powers\r\nso wonderful as the power to think, love, admire, see, hear, and feel\r\nare located in structures so fragile as the brain; and we may well\r\nmarvel at the provision of the turret of flinty hardness to protect it\r\nfrom violence.\r\n\r\nNow we are to consider these centres of energy as abnormally weak in all\r\ntheir structures at birth in those who become insane: these are the\r\nluckless legacies from the fathers and the mothers, and for how far back\r\nin the ancestral line we do not know. We are to consider that there is\r\nthe same abnormal condition of the cerebral bloodvessels and of the\r\nsofter inter-vascular structures as in other local diseases; and when\r\nyou recall the fact that everything that worries, that adds discomfort\r\nto either mind or muscles, is a force that tends to develop weakness and\r\ndisease, you will see how it applies in the evolution of insanity.\r\n\r\nShall these fragile centres be permitted to rest when overwork has made\r\nthem sick, or is there any other rational means for their recovery?\r\nShall they not be permitted to rest when abundantly able to keep\r\nphysically nourished in a way that does not cause even the slightest\r\nshade of discomfort?\r\n\r\nAgain, let it be borne in mind that recovery from acute disease is\r\nattended with a revival of strength in every power that makes life worth\r\nliving, and that every person not acutely sick who has fasted under my\r\ncare or who has cut down the waste of brain power by less daily food has\r\nfound the same revival of power. To this there have been no exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhat do we fear in sickness? Is it disease or the wasting pounds? Since\r\nthey will disappear when Nature would have the food-gate closed, since\r\nthey reappear when there is the highest possible reach of mere relish,\r\nand when all the other senses have become more acute, and also when\r\nexistence has become almost ecstatic, why ever oppress the weak or sick\r\ncentres when Nature wills a rest?\r\n\r\nThe literature on the disease of the mind has become so massive in mere\r\nbulk, in its physiological refinements, that it would require time with\r\na long reach into eternity to go through it; but it has not come to my\r\nknowledge that it contains any reference to the brain as a\r\nself-nourishing, self-charging dynamo; that therefore the stomach is\r\nonly a machine whose use can well be omitted for long periods when these\r\ncentres of moral and intellectual energy have become worried into\r\ndisease, with rest the only means, the only need for all the recovery\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you giants of the medical profession!\" You who have been elected to\r\npreside over these great homes of the mentally wrecked because of your\r\neminence in character, ability, experience, and professional\r\nattainments, do you deny the soundness of the physiology involved in\r\nthis method of reaching health through Nature? Then let me array against\r\nyou Alexander Haig, M. A., M. D. Oxon., F. R. C. P., Physician to the\r\nMetropolitan Hospital, and the Royal Hospital, and for Children and\r\nWomen; late Casualty Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I quote\r\nfrom his exhaustive work, _Uric Acid in the Causation of Disease_:\r\n\r\n\"And now I come to the causes which led me to take too much albumen and\r\nto suffer severely; in _Fads of an Old Physician_, Dr. Keith refers to\r\nanother work on diet, by Dr. Dewey, of Meadville, Pa., _The True Science\r\nof Living_, and the chief point in this book is that temporary, complete\r\nstarvation till there is once more a healthy appetite is the best cure\r\nfor a host of dyspepsia, debilities, depression, mental and bodily, and\r\nnumerous other troubles, and that for similar less severe disturbances\r\nof nutrition the great remedy is to leave out the breakfast, so as to\r\ngive the stomach a long rest of sixteen hours or more, with the object\r\nof allowing it to recuperate and accumulate secretions after the last\r\nmeal of the previous day.\r\n\r\n\"It seems from internal evidence in Dr. Dewey's book, a copy of which I\r\nowe to Dr. Keith, that his plans have been completely successful in a\r\nlarge number of cases, _and it seems to me that his logic is\r\nunanswerable_, and that in his main contentions he is perfectly right.\r\n\r\n\"Having arrived at this conclusion, I proceeded forthwith to put the\r\nmatter to the test of experience by placing myself on two meals a\r\nday--that is, I left out my breakfast--and the result was I ate such a\r\ngood lunch at 1 P. M. that it was impossible to take anything more till\r\ndinner-time, 7.30 or 8 P. M.; so that I reduced myself at once from four\r\nmeals a day to two. The result was exactly what Dr. Dewey describes. I\r\nfelt extremely bright and well in the morning, and capable of very good\r\nwork, both mental and bodily. At 1 P. M. I had keen hunger, even for dry\r\nbread; such hunger as I had not experienced for years. After lunch\r\n(breakfast) I felt a little bit dull and occasionally sleepy, and the\r\nmental work for the first hour or two after it was not as good as usual.\r\nAbout 5 P. M. I was very thirsty and had to have a drink of water, but\r\nthere was not the least desire for food until several hours later;\r\nthough by 7.30 or 8 P. M. I was able to manage another fairly good meal;\r\nand thus my meals automatically, so to speak, reduced themselves to\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\nI also quote from his work on _Diet and Food_, page 10:\r\n\r\n\"It is also possible, by introducing more food than can possibly be\r\ndigested, to overpower digestion so that nothing is digested and\r\nabsorbed, and starvation results, a fact that has been brought to the\r\nfront in the most interesting manner in the writings of Dr. Dewey.\"\r\n\r\nAnd who is Dr. Keith? You know that he is one of the youngest physicians\r\nin all Scotland, even if he does possess eighty years that are no burden\r\nto him. I quote him from his _Fads of an Old Physician_:\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Dewey's grand means of cure now is abstinence for the time from all\r\nfood, and this he carries out to a degree which must astonish most\r\nphysicians of the present day, as well as their patients. During times\r\nof sickness, when there is no desire for food, he gives none till the\r\ndesire comes, and then only if the state of the tongue and general\r\ncondition show that the power of digestion has returned. This may be in\r\na few days, or in severe cases, as of rheumatic fever, it may not be for\r\nforty days or even longer. He points out very forcibly that we have all\r\na store of material laid up in the body which supplies what is required\r\nfor keeping necessary functions of the system going, while no food can\r\nbe usefully taken in the stomach. I had mentioned this provision in my\r\n_Plea_, and had stated that so long as it lasts it is sufficient to\r\npreserve life. I also suggested that it might be found that the waste of\r\nthe body was less when this internal supply was alone trusted to, than\r\nwhen it was supplemented by food from without which the organs of\r\nnutrition were not in a condition to utilize. This, to my mind, Dr.\r\nDewey has proved to be the fact, and no one can read his case without\r\nbeing convinced that it is so. He gives a most interesting table from\r\nDr. Yeo, showing what textures of the body waste most rapidly in\r\ndisease. Fat is at one end of the scale, and at the other the brain,\r\nwhich does not waste till all the other textures and organs are depleted\r\nto the utmost.\r\n\r\n\"In cases of slighter disease where the patient is able to be about or\r\nto carry on his business, but with discomfort, the same abstinence from\r\nall food is recommended. It is usually found that work can be done more\r\neasily, and that strength actually increases, although the starving may\r\nhave to be kept up for several days. But the great _coup_ in Dr.\r\nDewey's practice is, that to improve or to preserve health he advises\r\nall to give up breakfast, and to fast till the mid-day meal. In this he\r\nhas had a very large number of followers, very much to their advantage.\r\nIt may be that the omission of breakfast is more needed and has greater\r\neffect in America than it would have on this side of the Atlantic. In\r\nAmerica the meal is generally a very full one, made up in a large\r\nmeasure of a variety of hot cakes, also flesh food and tea or coffee.\r\nThe other two meals of the day are full, 'square' meals likewise. I have\r\nseen much overfeeding in this country, but never to such a degree, and\r\nso generally, as I have seen in America and on American steamers. In one\r\nof the latter the cooking was the worst I ever met with, but the hard\r\nmeat was swallowed all the same, and the consequences must have been\r\ngrievous.\"\r\n\r\nAre you still without any questioning of your authorized, established\r\nmethods of treating the mentally sick? Then let me quote against you\r\nanother man across the ocean, whose ability, learning, and professional\r\nattainments are of the highest order. I quote from _Air, Food, and\r\nExercise_, by A. Rabagliati, M. A., M. D., F. R. C. S., Edin., a man\r\nwith whom patient, exhaustive investigation is only a recreation:\r\n\r\n\"It has been shown by physiologists that certain tissues are absorbed\r\nand used before others. Dr. Dewey, of Pennsylvania, with whose views I\r\nam glad to find myself in general accord, and who seems to have made\r\nthe same attempt as the writer to view the facts of medical practice\r\nfrom an independent--and may I say, original?--standpoint, quotes a\r\ntable of great significance from Dr. Yeo. Besides quoting it in the text\r\nof his book, _The True Science of Living_, Dr. Dewey places it in\r\ncapital letters in the frontispiece of his book. He calls it Nature's\r\nBill of Fare for the Sick; and he shows that in illness, when we are\r\nusing up the materials accumulated in our bodies, we may use as much as\r\n99 per cent. of our fat (practically all of it), that of muscle we may\r\nuse as much as 30 per cent., that the spleen may waste to the extent of\r\n63 per cent., the liver as much as 56 per cent., and the blood itself be\r\nabsorbed to the extent of 17 per cent. of its total amount. But even\r\nwhen wasting to this extent has occurred the curious and significant\r\nfact is emphasized that the _brain and nerve-centres may not have wasted\r\nat all_. The controlling nervous system thus does not lose its powers\r\ntill the very last. Generally, however, the wasting process does not\r\nrequire to be carried to the very last, the chronic inflammatory deposit\r\n(and in rare cases even a cancerous infiltration) being absorbed and got\r\nrid of before this point is reached.\r\n\r\n\"As most, if not all, of the chronic diseases depend upon the deposition\r\nof waste, unassimilated materials in various situations; or, in other\r\nwords, depend upon a blocking of the local circulation in this way, a\r\nlittle wholesome starvation is generally of vast benefit by inducing\r\nthe economy to use up some of its waste stuff. Nature herself points the\r\nway to us in this matter, because when things have gone as far as she\r\ncan bear, and when, were things to go on in the same way, death must\r\nensue, she generally throws the patient into bed with a digestive system\r\nentirely disorganized, taking away all appetite for food and all power\r\nof assimilation for the time being. We may, in such circumstances, do\r\nmuch harm by efforts too persistently made to feed our patients; but\r\ngenerally they refuse all sustenance for some time. After a while (Dr.\r\nDewey does not seem to be afraid if his patients refuse all food even\r\nfor as long on some occasions as thirty days continuously, or even\r\nlonger) they right themselves, the tongue cleans, appetite returns, the\r\npower of assimilation is reestablished, and recovery takes place. It\r\nstrikes me as somewhat curious (and yet, if we both look at the facts of\r\nlife candidly and impartially, perhaps it is not curious) that observers\r\nso wide apart, and in circumstances so very different as the conditions\r\nof human life must be in Yorkshire from what they are in Pennsylvania,\r\nshould come to conclusions so practically similar as Dr. Dewey and the\r\nwriter have reached.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, masters in the medical profession, to what good end are you\r\npumping food into human stomach, where there is no hunger and no mind\r\nleft to know the need? Is it to maintain that strength which costs you\r\nso much muscle at every feeding. Or is it that it would be a danger to\r\nlose a few pounds of body while Nature gets ready to ask for food in\r\nthe gentlest and most persuasive way? Whatever there is in appeal to the\r\nbest in any human life to uplift it from the deepest depths, you have at\r\nthe readiest command. You seem amply equipped to reach everything but\r\nthose sick, afflicted, oppressed brain-centres. You treat everything but\r\nthese, but to these you are worse than the Egyptian task-masters in that\r\nyou force needless labor where rest alone is the need. It is not bricks\r\nwithout straw, but labor with exhausted power; and for all your efforts\r\nyou simply maintain weight at a tremendous cost to the energy of cure.\r\nIn no class of patients is rest for the brain more indicated than in\r\nyours; in none are the means so at command and the results for good so\r\npromising. With your patients the importance of time for business or\r\nsocial use is no more a concern; the abnormal is all due to disease.\r\n\r\nLet us consider those rooms of bedlam you call the \"excitable wards.\"\r\nThey who enter leave all hope (of the friends) behind. Is there special\r\nneed in these regions of despair and mental chaos that the mere pounds\r\nand strength shall be kept up? What will be lost by protracted fasts?\r\nNothing in the kitchen. As for the brain and those sick centres, they\r\nwill feed themselves until the last heart-beat sends the last available\r\nnourishment to the remotest cell. Will the functions of the brain grow\r\nmore abnormal by a suspension of digestive drafts upon it? Does rest to\r\nanything that is tired tend to the abnormal?\r\n\r\nAgain I ask, What will be lost by protracted fasts in such cases?\r\nNothing but weight, of which the fat will be by far the larger part.\r\nWould there be worry about starvation? With most of the cases there is\r\nnot mind enough to worry over anything from the standpoint of reason.\r\nThe very fact of the absence of the sense of the importance of daily\r\nfood would render fasts in the highest degree practical and successful.\r\n\r\nThe fasts could be instituted with the certainty of a calmer condition\r\nof mind as soon as the digestive tract would cease to call upon the\r\nbrain for power, and with the probability that a surprising degree of\r\nimprovement would be manifest in all, and long before the available\r\nbody-food for the brain would be exhausted.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you have treated acute sickness in all its forms, and you\r\nhave had many cases in which, because of irritable stomachs, neither\r\nfood nor medicine could be given. Day after day you have seen the\r\nwasting of the bodies, and you have also seen mental aberration or\r\nstupor lessen day by day as the disease lessened its grasp upon the\r\nbrain-centres, and finally when the point of natural hunger was reached,\r\nyou never found the lost pounds a matter of physical discomfort or\r\nmental abnormality or weakness; rather you have always found at this\r\npoint a mental condition in every way the most highly satisfactory. I\r\nnever saw brighter eyes, a happier expression on every line, than\r\nrevealed by a woman after a fast of forty-four days, in which acute\r\ndisease had reduced the weight forty pounds.\r\n\r\nAll overweight not due to dropsy or other disease is due to eating more\r\nfood than the waste demands. As an abnormal condition overweight has\r\nreceived a great deal of attention in the way of misguided effort to\r\nboth prevention and cure. These efforts are such conspicuous failures\r\nthat even the patent medicine man has not found his \"anti-fat nostrums\"\r\nthe happy means to fortune. There have been all kinds of limits built\r\naround bills of fare, but sooner or later Nature revolts and they are\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nThe reason that certain people take on weight easily and become \"stout,\"\r\nis because of constitutional tendency, good digestion, and excess of\r\nfood. As a general fact, the overweights are \"large feeders,\" and they\r\nnot only look well but feel well, for they have much less stomach\r\ntrouble than the average mortal, and in cheerful endowment of soul they\r\nrank the highest among all the people.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my philosophy, I, who am one of the leanest of the kind,\r\nlook upon the stoutness of those in the early prime of life with\r\nsomething of both envy and admiration; they seem so ideally conditioned\r\nto enjoy the best of all things on earth. But it is quite a serious\r\nmatter when the muscles and brain have to deal with pounds in excess by\r\nthe score, even as if the victim were doomed to wear clothes padded with\r\nso many pounds of shot.\r\n\r\nWhy some people take on fat easily even with the smallest of meals, why\r\nsome of the largest eaters are of the leanest, are matters to talk about\r\nbut not to know about. For my purpose it is sufficient that I assert\r\nthat overweight can be prevented by an habitual limitation of the daily\r\nfood to the daily need; that it can be cut down to any desired degree by\r\nstopping the supply, a method that is not attended with any violence to\r\nthe constitution, nor even to comfort or power. This plan has the great\r\nadvantage of adding to the curative energy of disease as well; and more\r\nthan this, there is a change attending the loss that seems at first\r\nphenomenal, as involving a physiological contradiction--there is an\r\nactual increase in muscle-weight as the bloat and fat weight go down.\r\n\r\nHow is this, you ask? Here is the explanation: As the fat weight\r\nincreases by surplus food, so decrease the disposition and ability for\r\ngeneral exercise. As it declines, so do muscle and all the other\r\nenergies increase, and the use of muscle within physiological limit\r\ntends to restore the normal weight and strength.\r\n\r\nThere are no overweights who would not receive the greatest benefit by a\r\nfast that would diminish the pounds to that of the ripest maturity of\r\nlife, a fast that would be determined by the time required to reach the\r\ndesired number of pounds. As a means this method is available to all,\r\nand practical where due physiological light will enable it to be carried\r\nout with no starving concern to disable vital power.\r\n\r\nAs a general fact, the No-breakfast Plan has been attended by a highly\r\nsatisfactory reduction of surplus pounds; where there has been a failure\r\nit has been due to such an increase of digestive power as really to add\r\nto both an increase of the average amount of daily food and of power to\r\ndigest it. For instance, one of my fellow citizens, weighing not less\r\nthan three hundred and thirty pounds some years ago, gave up his morning\r\nmeals. This was attended with entire relief from frequent bilious\r\nspells; but the average of daily food was increased and the business of\r\na barber did not add anything to muscle development. Finally from mere\r\nexcess of weight he became a prisoner to his house and yard, unable to\r\nwalk a square without the greatest difficulty; and yet there were two\r\nenormous meals put into a stomach daily that did not complain, and the\r\nweight increased until the three hundred and seventy-five pound notch\r\nwas nearly reached. He heard about the Rathbun fast, and I was able to\r\npersuade him to come down to one light meal daily, and day after day\r\nbonds were loosened. After a year there have been nearly seventy-five\r\npounds lost, and there is ability to labor and to walk several miles\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nVery many thin persons have gained as high as forty pounds by reason of\r\nthe larger degree of muscle exercise. Since last writing, this word has\r\ncome from Miss K., who one year ago was at the asylum eating several\r\nmeals a day in bed with suicidal intent. She left that bed with a weight\r\nof one hundred and forty pounds, and, as I have mentioned before, lost\r\ntwenty pounds of it by her fast. My last news is from a letter written\r\nthe day after a twenty-five-mile ride among the mountains with a soul as\r\nfree and joyous as there are freedom and joy with the birds whose songs\r\ngreeted her rapt ears from every treetop. She writes of a gain of\r\ntwenty-four pounds since the fast, and states that the glasses she has\r\nworn for thirteen years are wanted no longer!\r\n\r\nI feel that I need not multiply words as to the ability and utility of\r\nbringing all overweight down to the physiological normal and of keeping\r\nit there. I could fill hundreds of pages with the joyous testimonies of\r\nthose who have been relieved of many surplus pounds, with numerous\r\naccompanying ailings; they all tell the same story, and I will only add\r\nthis, that there is no physiological excuse for any mortal to carry\r\naround weight that disables.\r\n\r\nNot very many months ago ex-Governor Flower, of New York, a statesman of\r\nnational fame, a man of largest public spirit, a most valuable citizen,\r\nand Colonel Robert Ingersoll, an orator of world-wide fame and of great\r\nnobility of soul, dropped as beeves beneath the stroke of an ax because\r\nof a fracture of brittle bloodvessels. In both of these cases not many\r\nless pounds than a hundred had needlessly accumulated.\r\n\r\nCould I have had the Colonel's ear when I last saw him as a listener to\r\nalmost matchless oratory, whose rotundity of belt was to be measured by\r\nthe yard, I would have addressed him as follows: \"My dear Colonel, when\r\nI last saw you you were just filled out enough to be the joy of your\r\ntailor, and as a picture of health in form and looks you were ideal. You\r\nwere then eating the meals of a woodchopper; and merely because food\r\ntastes good and does not seem to hurt you, you have been doing the same\r\nduring the nearly score and a half of years since I have seen you. You\r\nhave been eating more food every day in proportion to general muscle\r\nexercise than the hardest toiler does in a week, and your vast bulk\r\nevidences against you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter explaining to him the structural possibilities of apoplexy as a\r\nlegacy, as I have to you in the cases of insanity, I would continue:\r\n\"Now by virtue of a possible ancestral weakness of your brain arteries\r\nthis may happen: the arterial walls, because of habitual food in excess,\r\nmay undergo a fatty, limy degeneration that will make a rupture\r\npossible, with death or paralysis of one-half or more of the body as the\r\ndirect result; or the small arteries may have their walls so thickened\r\nas not to permit enough blood to circulate in order duly to nourish\r\nparts of the brain they supply; hence softening of the structure and\r\nmore or less imbecility.\r\n\r\n\"The history of all overweights is that of a decline of muscle energy,\r\nand very generally of the amount of muscle activity as the pounds and\r\nyears increase; but no cut in the amount of daily food so long as it can\r\nbe taken with relish and disposed of without any special protesting from\r\nthe stomach. This is the history of by far the largest majority of\r\nthose sudden deaths due to cerebral hemorrhage, and also the history of\r\nmost of the cases of imbecility with the overweights.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Colonel, you should make a radical parting with those surplus\r\npounds by a fast that may extend into months, or take one of the\r\nlightest of meals once a day. Follow this out rigidly until you have\r\nlost a hundred pounds, and then by as much will you be not only free\r\nfrom disease, but free also from the danger of disease.\"\r\n\r\nMy experience with cases of epilepsy, or \"fits,\" is confined to a half\r\ndozen cases, in which permanent relief seems to be assured. There is an\r\nacquired structural abnormality behind the spasms, acquired from surplus\r\nfood, with a cure to be reached ultimately in most cases along these\r\nphysiological lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not take time in telling the evils of alcoholics. It would not\r\nbe more enlightening were I to spend hours in telling of wrecked lives,\r\nof wrecked homes, of prisons filled with their victims, of the immense\r\nloss to states and nations from the loss to sufferers and the loss they\r\ninflict. Alcoholism has no sense for frowning, ominous statistics, for\r\nit is a disease to be rationally treated, a disease to be rationally\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nIn the light of later science the word \"stimulants\" has become a\r\nmisnomer as applied to alcoholics; the term, no doubt, came into use\r\nfrom the fact that under their use there is more endurance to both\r\nphysical and mental ills, an endurance or indifference ascribed to\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\nIf power is stimulated by their use, then there should be a rise in\r\ntemperature whereby severe cold is better endured; but this is not the\r\nfact any more than that temperature is lowered whereby extreme heat is\r\nendured; in either case the endurance is due to benumbed brain-centres.\r\nThe alcoholic simply lessens the power to suffer mentally or physically;\r\nhence in degree it is an anaesthetic, and as such it also affects the\r\nmoral sense and lessens the power of reason and judgment. They are\r\nhabitually taken for no other reason than for the temporary relief they\r\ngive to some ill of life.\r\n\r\nIt seems the very depths of total depravity when there is no bread for\r\nthe hungry family, that the price of a loaf will rather be spent for a\r\ndrink; but it is not so much moral depravity as depravity of\r\nbrain-substance. The lethal drink is taken because without it there is\r\nmore acute suffering than from the want of a loaf of bread by the entire\r\nfamily. In my practice an ordinarily sober father would always get drunk\r\nand stay drunk while any member of his family was sick, and for the sole\r\nreason that he could not endure the worry of apprehension. This was not\r\nso much depravity as an acute sense of the suffering and danger\r\ninvolved, a painful rousing of the best instincts of the soul, those\r\ninstincts that raise man above the brute and make him the noblest work\r\nof the divine hand. That is not a bad man at heart who has such a sense\r\nof affection for his wife or child when they seem dangerously sick that\r\nhe must have artificial aid to endurance; and if you shall detect the\r\nalcoholic odor in his breath at the funeral you may know that there is\r\nheart agony under repression.\r\n\r\nThe fact that alcoholics are anaesthetics, and not stimulants, has become\r\nknown to a few of the scientists in the medical profession; but it can\r\nscarcely be said to have become known to the profession generally. That\r\nthe habitual drinker partakes for any other reason than to drown his\r\nwoes that will not stay drowned, and that the drowning is not\r\nstimulation, do not need argument.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic in proportion to its strength is mental chaos and\r\nparalysis to power, and it has not the virtue to contain an atom that\r\ncan be converted into a living atom. In not the least sense is it a\r\ntissue-builder, and its use by the medical profession is without the\r\nshadow of a reason, and is all the more reprehensible in cases of shock.\r\n\r\nLet us see: shock in degree is brain paralysis; alcoholics in degree are\r\nbrain paralyzers; shock is simply a state of exhaustion with rest the\r\nsupreme need. All the rousement that is necessary and that can avail\r\nwill be called into action by the need of oxygen. There are cases of\r\ndisease in which breathing goes on hour after hour, when the soul seems\r\nto have departed and with it every life sense. The patient has become\r\ndead beyond reviving, and yet breathes hour after hour. Now can one for\r\none moment think that an alcoholic can add to the power of the\r\nrespiratory centres of the brain to respond to the calls for oxygen and\r\nso prolong life? Shock in its gravest degree is to be considered the\r\nextreme of the tired-out condition, with rest the only restorative\r\nmeans; and rest may be permitted with the certainty that for mere\r\nbreathing purposes alcoholics are dangerous in proportion to the gravity\r\nof the shock.\r\n\r\nIn health the alcoholic only adds discomfort, because there are no\r\ncomplaints to soothe; hence it is the duty of every mother so to train\r\nher sons in health-habits that those first drinks will be discouraging\r\nbecause they bring no cheer of contrast, but rather sensations that are\r\nnot suggestive of a better physical condition.\r\n\r\nAlcoholics have a corroding effect upon the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach, a congestive effect by which the glands are subjected to\r\nstarving pressure; hence their use always disables the mere mechanics\r\nand the chemistry involved in digestion, and so prolongs disease, and\r\nthis applies to all medicines that corrode. This corroding power of the\r\nalcoholics upon the walls of the stomach and its paralyzing effect upon\r\nthe brain-centres, with the additional fact that there is nothing in it\r\nthat adds force to any life power or that can be converted into living\r\natoms, should make its use in the stomach of the sick a crime scarcely\r\nto be excused by ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the drunkard is a process of culture, and involves\r\nsomething of a constitutional tendency as in other diseases. I conceive\r\nthat there is an alcoholic temperament, or a temperament in which the\r\ninability to bear with patience the various mental and physical woes of\r\nlife is marked even from childhood. Indigestion and every cause that\r\nlowers vital power only add to the importance of such a nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the evolution of the drunkard is the first untimely\r\nmeal drawn from the breast of the mother. By irregular nursings and the\r\nnursings merely to stop crying the nervous system is continually\r\novertaxed. There are the untimely meals to prevent gluttony; there are\r\nthe between-meal lunches to incite nervousness, irritability, a feeling\r\nof unrest that nothing seems to satisfy.\r\n\r\nThis goes on year after year until the time comes when that first drink\r\nhas power to soothe many discordant voices, and the die is cast. Other\r\ndrinks follow, with each to lessen the power of the dynamo and to\r\ndisable the machine. At first, drink is indulged not without a sense of\r\nwrongdoing, but with that feeling of power in reserve to keep within the\r\nlimits of safety.\r\n\r\nThe gradual corrosion of the stomach adding to the labors of the brain\r\nin the matter of food mass decomposition as well as digestion marks the\r\ndecline of power to abstain and the degradation of every sense that\r\nmakes life worth living. Now add to the corrosion of the membrane and\r\nthe paralysis of the brain-centres from alcoholics the other inciting\r\ncauses in the culture of disease, and you have the evolution of the\r\ndrunkard.\r\n\r\nHow is he to be cured? Only through a fast that shall let that diseased\r\nstomach become new from regeneration, that will let the brain accumulate\r\nrest in reserve. For a time you will need to have him under bonds, for\r\nhis will power is abolished. Put him where there will be deaf ears to\r\nthe cries of morbid nature, for there is to be a conflict at first; but\r\nlong before hunger will come the storm will subside; and finally, when\r\nfood will be really desired, there will be a new stomach and a new brain\r\nto which an alcoholic will be no temptation.\r\n\r\nThis is no figure of speech, because there is such a continual change of\r\nlife and death going on in the soft tissues of the body that in a month\r\nor more of fasting it may be assumed that much of the tissues which is\r\nleft has undergone reconstruction, and both brain and stomach act as if\r\nthey are new when the time comes to restore the lost pounds.\r\n\r\nThe ways of the kitchen and dining-room are the ways of disease and\r\ndeath, ways whose ends are prisons, asylums, scaffolds, to a far larger\r\nextent than is dreamed of by the fathers and mothers of the land. A new\r\ncrusade against intemperance, the intemperance of the dining-room, is\r\nthe only one that will ever settle this so-called liquor question. The\r\nrum-seller will only pull down his sign through the starvation of his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nWith brains and stomachs kept in the highest order, the alcoholic has\r\nonly the least power of the beguiling kind; it is rather a dose whose\r\neffects do not invite repetition. But for all who have the drink disease\r\nseemingly beyond hope a fast of a month, or two months if necessary,\r\nwill cure any stomach or brain, no matter how pickled they are with\r\nalcoholic soaking, and with only the least disturbance in the habit\r\nbreaking; even within a week the hardest of the fighting should be over\r\nwhen the fast is made absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now to consider briefly a most distressing disease, one that\r\nperhaps was never cured by the power of doses, and that most happily\r\nillustrates the structural changes in the cure of disease.\r\n\r\nAsthmatic distress is caused by congestion of the terminals of the\r\nbronchial tubes, by which entrance of air into the cells is made\r\ndifficult, even in some cases to the point of suffocation. This\r\ncondition as a disease may be called bronchial catarrh, as in most cases\r\nthere is such a condition of the larger tubes as to cause the habitual\r\nraising of a discharge. As to the disease itself, you have only to\r\nrecall what has been said about nasal catarrh in order to understand its\r\norigin and development. It would be as trivial a disease were it not for\r\nthe fact that those smaller and ultimate tubes, because of flabby walls\r\nand weak vessels, become congested, with resulting narrowing of the\r\nair-ways of life.\r\n\r\nFor this most distressing disease local treatments are as futile and\r\nvoid of intelligence as the physiology and anatomy involved in cause and\r\ncure of other local diseases. Is it not a great thing that those too\r\nnarrow ways of life may be reached through a fast which shall so charge\r\nthe brain with power that the flabby walls will be condensed; that most\r\ncases of asthma may be cured, with marked relief for every case? This\r\nis as certain as a result, as that rest restores strength. With the\r\ntoning of the brain through rest, a catarrh of the bronchial tubes is\r\ncertainly curable in most cases. With a large opportunity to know I am\r\nable to say this with intense conviction.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months ago, just before the break of day, a freight train\r\ntook a side track; in a few moments, with nearly a mile-a-minute speed,\r\na limited passenger train took the same track, and in the time of a\r\nsecond five men were hurled into eternity. Why? How? The conductor and\r\nhis brakeman were in such heavy sleep when the switch was opened that\r\nthey were not awakened to close it.\r\n\r\nWhy? How? There was the torpor of indigestion holding the tired brains\r\nof those two men in its fatal grasp; their stomachs were full of food\r\nwhen they were already tired out by their long trip that was nearly at\r\nits close, and for them those untimely meals were the last.\r\n\r\nOf all men who ought to work with empty stomachs for the sake of the\r\nbest possible reach of the memory it is the railroad engineer and\r\nconductor; so also every man who is in any way responsible for the\r\nsafety of the trains. If we had the history of all the derailments,\r\ncollisions, of cars with human freight converted into funeral pyres, a\r\nfrightful percentage of them could be traced to where \"some one had\r\nblundered\" because of the torpor from handling meals when the brain was\r\ncompelled to higher services. Digestive, indigestive torpor is also\r\ntorpor of the sense of _responsibility_.\r\n\r\nIn the city where I live is the point between two divisions of the Erie\r\nRailroad, each somewhat more than a hundred miles long. Before I began\r\nthe agitation of the No-breakfast Plan all trainmen felt that filling\r\ntheir stomachs was the last duty before entering upon their taxing\r\ntrips, and tired wives would have to get up at all times of the night to\r\nprepare general meals. In this city a mighty revolution for the good of\r\nwives, for the good of men themselves, and for the safety of the trains\r\nand the hapless passengers has been going on for some years.\r\n\r\nIn former times when these men came home from their rounds generally\r\ntired out, and with a feeling that in proportion to the sense of\r\nexhaustion was the need to eat, general meals had to be prepared at any\r\ntime of night. All this is changed in a large measure. Trainmen have\r\nbeen finding out that the less food in their stomachs they take into bed\r\nwith them and on to their trains, the better it is for them in every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMore and more they are getting into the way of having a general meal\r\nwhen they can eat it with leisure and leisurely digest it; and I predict\r\nthat a time will come when all who are in any way responsible for the\r\nrunning of trains will have to know how to take care of their stomachs,\r\nin order that they shall attain and maintain the highest efficiency for\r\nservices where human lives so much depend on the best there is in\r\nmemory, reason, and judgment. This will be a part of their preparatory\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThe \"block system\" has wonderfully added to the safety of the trains,\r\nbut there should be a block system added to the stomachs of the\r\ndispatchers and all whose duties are so grave as the handling of human\r\nfreight. There is no division so long that it cannot be doubled with\r\nless fatigue and better mental condition if the stomach be not on duty\r\nat the same time. In this I speak with the authority that comes from the\r\nstudy of the experiences of trainmen during many years: with one accord\r\nthey speak of their trips as taken with clearer heads and stronger\r\nmuscles than when large meals were thought a necessity while on duty.\r\n\r\nWith an empty stomach it takes a very long time to get into such\r\ntorpor--drowsiness--as compels the after-dinner sleep. That engineer who\r\nonce told me of such sleepiness as made him nod while on duty was not\r\nsuffering from either lack of sleep or overwork of his body: it was\r\nsimply a case of the torpor of indigestion, and this was when there was\r\nno block system to lessen the danger of such services.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of imperfection in what man does for man that\r\ncomes from the indifference arising from the torpor of untimely food,\r\nand far more than there is any conception in what man does against man\r\nfrom the destruction of power in this way.\r\n\r\nThere is now one of the Erie conductors who five years ago was losing\r\nat least half of his time from asthma; there is another who was equally\r\ndisabled from sudden head symptoms that would immediately disable. These\r\nmen have lost no trips since they began to run their stomachs with the\r\nsame care as their trains. And there is an engineer whose trips to the\r\nphysician and to the drug-store for many years were as frequent as those\r\nto his engine. There has since been a half dozen years of wiser care of\r\nhis stomach, and his wife says that the change for the better in his\r\ndisposition is beyond description. These men have rendered far more\r\nservice, and who cannot see that these services have been of far higher\r\ncharacter for the company, and that they have been infinitely better\r\nhusbands, fathers, and citizens?\r\n\r\nThe following case will interest trainmen: D. S., a brakeman, reached\r\nthe burden of two hundred and forty-six pounds, with resulting\r\nbreathlessness and other ailings that taxed all his resources to perform\r\nhis duties. He was induced to cut down his daily food as the only means\r\nfor relief, and to add to his strength. It took him a long time to\r\nmaster the fact that his strength was not kept up by food, but the\r\ngradual loss of weight with the general improvement made this more and\r\nmore evident. He finally reached a time when he was able to make his\r\nround trip of one hundred and ninety-six miles without a morsel of food\r\nthe while, and with much less fatigue than when there was a midnight\r\nmeal from a lunch-pail. Within a year the weight has gone down to one\r\nhundred and eighty-eight pounds. To my professional eye there is beauty\r\nin the bright eyes, in the condensed, smooth face, in the body enfolded\r\nwith clothes that flap in the breeze like the sails of a ship. No\r\naccident will happen to precious human freight through his brain kept\r\nfree from digestive torpor while on duty.\r\n\r\nEver since my book has been out I have been in more or less trouble with\r\ncases that badly needed my personal care, and not few in which death was\r\ninevitable. For instance, there is a woman in Illinois who has been\r\nailing for years, and in spite of the No-breakfast Plan has had to take\r\nto her bed with acute aversion to food. Medical art had utterly failed\r\nbefore she changed her dietary methods.\r\n\r\nHer dietary views are known, and so she is held in severe censure\r\nbecause the sick stomach is not compelled to a futile service; and\r\nthough I am informed of an enlargement in the region of the bowels that\r\nhas been perceptible and tender for years, her death will be considered\r\nsuicidal from _starvation_.\r\n\r\nA Warrensburg, Ill., editor began his fast by throwing up his food and\r\ncontinued it to the end; yet because he had talked about a fast it was\r\nsupposed to be a case of suicide of the stupid kind; and though the\r\npost-mortem revealed a diseased gall-bladder, the doctors who made it\r\ndid nothing to lessen the suicidal impression, and the death from\r\n\"starvation\" appeared under large headlines in the public prints.\r\n\r\nWhen men as learned, able, and eminent as Dr. Shrady, of New York, go\r\ninto print to inform the public that people may starve to death in ten\r\ndays, and when such men as Prof. Wood, of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, do not see any starvation in the wasting pounds of acute\r\ndisease, the care of acute sickness as Nature would have it is a grave\r\nmatter for the physician.\r\n\r\nIn five fatal cases under my care in which there was no possibility of\r\nfeeding, there was such agitation over the question of starvation as\r\nwould have subjected me to violence had my city been nearer the equator.\r\nIn all these cases I was compelled to have a post-mortem to silence\r\nheathen raging. In one case in which a young man had died after weeks of\r\ninability to take food, even one of my medical brethren carried the\r\nconviction with him for years, and without seeking to inform himself,\r\nthat there was a death from starvation. In this case there were spells\r\nof hunger in a fury, when meals would be taken, only to be soon thrown\r\nup, and he finally took to his bed to starve slowly to death. There was\r\nmind enough left to make a will, though the body had lost apparently\r\nmore than half the normal weight; the post-mortem revealed a stomach\r\nseared, thickened, and not more than a third of the normal size.\r\n\r\nThe physiology of fasting in time of sickness is so entirely new to the\r\nmedical world that every death that occurs with those who practise it is\r\ncertain to be attributed to starving.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year (1900) a woman of seventy, in high circles, died from\r\nan obscure stomach trouble. For thirty-eight days there averaged nearly\r\na half-dozen spells of vomiting; and yet it was generally believed that\r\nit was clearly a case of death from starvation, believed by those whose\r\npower to receive impressions is far stronger than their power to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nFasting, because it is Nature's plan, will win the victory in all cases\r\nin which victory is possible; and yet wherever it is adopted, to become\r\nknown about, there will be the same confusion of tongues as would be\r\nwere violent hands laid upon gods of wood and stone in heathen temples.\r\n\"Starved to death\" is the verdict.\r\n\r\nFasting during sickness, because of the vast utility and from the\r\nimpetus arising from the cases in Philadelphia, is bound to spread as by\r\ncontagion; but when death occurs, all friends involved will be charged\r\nas abettors of homicide. To be fair to the opposition, and to let all\r\nreaders know what chances for public censure will be theirs, whenever\r\nthey see fit to let their friends recover on Nature's plan or die\r\nnatural deaths, the following case is given. I quote from the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_ of May 7, 1900:\r\n\r\n    \"In the death notices of April 26 appeared the name of Mrs.\r\n    Hermina Meyer, fifty years of age, of 1233 North Howard Street.\r\n    At the time this short and simple record of the passing away of\r\n    an ordinary, obscure woman attracted no more attention than the\r\n    hundred similar names that constituted the necrological annals\r\n    of April 25. But there is a startling aftermath that at once\r\n    gives significance to this brief record, and rude and bitter\r\n    awakening to the followers of the so-called 'Starvation Cult,'\r\n    that has gained a considerable acceptance in the northeast\r\n    section of the city.\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Meyer was a believer in the fasting treatment. She was\r\n    apparently a victim of this strange and heretical therapeutical\r\n    faith. Kensington is buzzing with gossip concerning the\r\n    deplorable death of the unfortunate woman. C. F. Meyer, the\r\n    husband of the victim, accepts the death of his wife as due to\r\n    heart-failure, and apparently is not disposed to complain.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Meyer talked freely with a _Press_ reporter yesterday\r\n    concerning the sickness and death of his wife. He said that Mrs.\r\n    Meyer had been ill for about a year, her malady having been\r\n    diagnosed as chronic rheumatism. She had been treated by the\r\n    family physician for this disease, but without relief. In\r\n    despair she turned to the fasting treatment.\r\n\r\n    \"From time to time she had read of the remarkable cures claimed\r\n    to have been effected by complete abstention from food. Through\r\n    a friend she met and talked with the family of Leonard Thress,\r\n    of 2618 Frankford Avenue, whose case is proclaimed as one of the\r\n    most remarkable that had been successfully treated by the\r\n    fasting system. Thress was widely advertised as a victim of\r\n    dropsy, who, after a complete fast of more than a month, was\r\n    restored to sound health.\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Meyer believed, and sent for Henry Ritter, the chief\r\n    advocate and adviser of the fasting cult in Philadelphia. His\r\n    belief in the weird treatment of disease he has adopted is\r\n    seemingly unshakable.\r\n\r\n    \"Ritter has superintended many cases of starvation treatment,\r\n    wherein, according to his own statements, the patients have\r\n    totally abstained from actual food for periods of from four to\r\n    six weeks. He claims that in every case the afflicted person has\r\n    completely recovered health--with the single exception of Mrs.\r\n    Meyer.\r\n\r\n    \"In response to her request, Ritter called upon Mrs. Meyer. She\r\n    at once began her fast. Nothing was allowed to pass her lips but\r\n    a small quantity of tonicum and some physiological salts,\r\n    dissolved in water. Of each of these she was permitted to take\r\n    sparingly every day. It is claimed by Ritter, a fact well-known\r\n    to physiologists, that there is no actual food in either of\r\n    these thin condiments. They are simply stimulants. These\r\n    liquids, according to Ritter, are the only things given to any\r\n    of the patients whose cases he has supervised.\r\n\r\n    \"For twenty-five days, so says Mr. Meyer, his wife fasted and\r\n    improved. At the expiration of that time, he says, her health\r\n    was very much improved. She was able to walk about her room, a\r\n    thing she had not been able to do for many weeks. Then there was\r\n    a sudden and violent change for the worse. The patient was\r\n    seized with convulsive vomiting.\r\n\r\n    \"For sixteen days she suffered the excruciating pains of these\r\n    convulsions. But, under Ritter's advice, Mrs. Meyer continued\r\n    her fast. Till the thirty-fifth day she tasted no food. The\r\n    vomiting continued unabated. On the thirty-sixth day she felt a\r\n    craving for food for the first time since her long fast began.\r\n    She was given oatmeal porridge. But the vomiting continued\r\n    unabated.\r\n\r\n    \"She grew weaker and weaker. From one hundred and fifty pounds\r\n    weight she was reduced to a gaunt skeleton. When, upon the\r\n    resumption of a food diet, the vomiting did not cease, the\r\n    family was alarmed. The family physician was sent for in dismay.\r\n    But he could do nothing. Flesh-building foods were prescribed,\r\n    but they accomplished nothing. The vomiting continued, and three\r\n    weeks following the breaking of the fast Mrs. Meyer died.\r\n\r\n    \"The death was put down to a depleted blood-supply, or\r\n    heart-failure. Ritter claimed that this unexpected turn could\r\n    not have been anticipated, as the fact that the patient was\r\n    subject to heart disease was previously unknown.\r\n\r\n    \"He had treated her for rheumatism, and the cure was apparently\r\n    in sight when heart-failure carried the patient to her grave.\r\n\r\n    \"These facts were detailed by Mr. Meyer. He added that Mr.\r\n    Ritter was not a physician; that he charged no fees; that he did\r\n    not claim to prescribe remedies, but only advised.\r\n\r\n    \"So ends the case of Mrs. Hermina Meyers, first victim of the\r\n    starvation cult.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Press_ of May 8:\r\n\r\n    \"The death of Mrs. Hermina Meyer, after undergoing the fasting\r\n    treatment for thirty-five days, has not at all shaken the faith\r\n    of the adviser responsible for the ordeal, Henry Ritter, who\r\n    claims to have restored tireless persons to health. He affirmed\r\n    that the ravages of chronic disease had progressed too far for\r\n    his treatment to conquer them, and that his attendance was\r\n    advised by the family physician.\r\n\r\n    \"Against this comforting declaration, however, stands the fact\r\n    that the certificate of death, signed by Dr. James Chestnut,\r\n    Jr., gave as the cause prolonged abstinence from food; in other\r\n    words, _starvation_. Dr. Chestnut also has stated that the case\r\n    was taken out of his hands, and Ritter installed as medical\r\n    adviser, by what was virtually a dismissal. Dr. Chestnut was\r\n    summoned again when the condition of the woman became critical,\r\n    after twenty-five days of fasting, but she became rapidly weaker\r\n    with violent convulsions and vomiting, and was beyond medical\r\n    aid.\r\n\r\n    \"She had never been treated for cancer of the stomach, which\r\n    Ritter says he thinks she may have had, although she had a\r\n    valvular affection of the heart which had existed for some time.\r\n    But the fact that the cause of her death was officially attested\r\n    by the family physician as due to her long fast contradicts\r\n    flatly the position taken by the self-constituted healer, who\r\n    made the following statement last night:\r\n\r\n    \"'I have seen all the members of Mrs. Meyer's family to-day, and\r\n    they are entirely satisfied that my treatment was in no way\r\n    responsible for her death. I was called in at their urgent\r\n    request, as their own relatives were numbered among the cures to\r\n    the credit of the fasting treatment, as well as Mr. Thress. I\r\n    accept no money for my work; they knew it was a labor of love,\r\n    and the family physician, Dr. Chestnut, agreed with them as to\r\n    the advisability of this system which they had seen tested.\r\n\r\n    \"'Mrs. Meyer improved rapidly for a time, her chronic rheumatism\r\n    causing her less trouble than in years, after the first three\r\n    weeks of fasting. She had been treated previously for catarrh of\r\n    the stomach, and it is probable that a cancer afflicted her. I\r\n    am using no new system. The method has been used with very\r\n    notable success by Dr. Edward H. Dewey, of Meadville, whose\r\n    reputation and standing are distinguished. This is the first\r\n    case I have lost out of twelve patients who had been given up as\r\n    hopeless by regular physicians. It is Nature's cure, nothing\r\n    more; but it was applied too late in the case of Mrs. Meyer.'\r\n\r\n    \"Dr. Chestnut would not allow himself to be quoted because of\r\n    the rigid rules of medical ethics. It may be stated, however, in\r\n    addition to what has been said, that he does not wish to be\r\n    considered as having encouraged the experiment, and that the\r\n    death certificate defined his view of the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nA verdict on the part of the doctor _without a post-mortem_.\r\n\r\nAgainst the doctor is the following, from the daughter, Miss Kate Meyer.\r\nI quote from an article in the _North American_ of May 8, 1900:\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Hermina Meyer, devotee of an odd cult, that regards\r\n    starvation as a sure cure for all bodily ills, fasted for nearly\r\n    forty days because she was suffering from rheumatism.\r\n\r\n    \"The rheumatism disappeared.\r\n\r\n    \"But after twenty-five days of total abstinence from food she\r\n    sickened. Violent nausea came to her. She died.\r\n\r\n    \"Nevertheless, Miss Kate Meyer, daughter of the dead woman,\r\n    says:\r\n\r\n    \"'My mother did not die because she fasted. The fasting did her\r\n    good. When she began it she had been ill with rheumatism for\r\n    more than a year. She could hardly walk. Her left arm was\r\n    powerless. She could not lift it from her side. After two weeks\r\n    of fasting she was active. She could walk. The power came back\r\n    to her arm. She suffered little pain. She looked well. Then came\r\n    the attacks of nausea.\r\n\r\n    \"'But Dr. Chestnut, who is our family physician, was attending\r\n    mother all the time. He called once a week. He said himself that\r\n    the fast cure seemed to be doing mother good. When she got\r\n    nausea he did not lay it to her fasting. He said it was heart\r\n    trouble. That's what mother died of. Dr. Chestnut said so.\r\n\r\n    \"'Do you remember the case of Leonard Thress? He cured himself\r\n    of dropsy by fasting. Mother heard of it. She was introduced to\r\n    Mr. Thress. He told her that all he knew of the fast cure he had\r\n    learned from Henry Ritter. Mother sent and asked Mr. Ritter\r\n    about the cure. Then she began it. Mr. Ritter never charged\r\n    mother for anything. Dr. Chestnut consented that mother should\r\n    try the Ritter cure.'\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Meyer was the wife of Charles F. Meyer, of 1233 North\r\n    Howard Street. Meyer, like his daughter, has only friendliness\r\n    for Ritter, and also favors the fast cure. Mrs. Meyer, past\r\n    middle age, had been sorely tried by her ailment. For more than\r\n    a year Dr. Chestnut attended her, but her condition did not\r\n    improve. Prescription after prescription was tested, only to\r\n    fail.\r\n\r\n    \"'There is little hope for me,' said the woman to her daughter.\r\n    'I'm tired of taking medicines. They do me no good.'\r\n\r\n    \"She became more melancholy as the days passed. She regarded her\r\n    case as hopeless. Dr. Chestnut acknowledged defeat. He had only\r\n    a change of climate--a long stay in Colorado--to recommend. A\r\n    very domestic woman was Mrs. Meyer. She looked with horror upon\r\n    a journey. She said she would remain at home and die.\r\n\r\n    \"But one day last March there gathered at a banquet in the home\r\n    of Leonard Thress about a dozen persons, very happy, very\r\n    healthy (or believing themselves to be so), all members of the\r\n    'starvation cure' cult.\r\n\r\n    \"Each had to tell the story of a long fast that brought a\r\n    remarkable cure. Newspapers gave publicity to the dinner of the\r\n    little band with the odd faith in fasting. Mrs. Meyer heard of\r\n    it. Here was a chance--a gleam of hope! She came to know Leonard\r\n    Thress, and, through him, Henry Ritter, the apostle of the fast\r\n    cure. He told her of remarkable recoveries. She caught his\r\n    enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    \"But, according to Mr. Meyer, the young man was careful first\r\n    that the family physician should consent. He never hinted at\r\n    compensation for his services; never got it. Aside from advising\r\n    total abstinence from food, he supplied small quantities of\r\n    tonicum and salts dissolved in water. These contained no food\r\n    matter; they were merely stimulative.\r\n\r\n    \"In two weeks hope was strong with Mrs. Meyer; with all the\r\n    family. Certainly, she was improving. She could walk; her arm\r\n    that had been stiff and painful moved with ease--hurt no more.\r\n    She still suffered occasional twinges, and decided to continue\r\n    her self-imposed starvation until every rheumatic germ in her\r\n    body was eradicated.\r\n\r\n    \"She regarded herself as almost cured, when, after twenty-five\r\n    days, she was attacked with nausea. She was very ill. It lasted\r\n    sixteen days. After the first few days of fasting all desire for\r\n    food had vanished. But on the thirty-sixth day she was hungry.\r\n\r\n    \"Oatmeal porridge was given her sparingly. The nausea, however,\r\n    did not cease. She began to grow alarmingly emaciated. She had\r\n    weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. Her weight had fallen to\r\n    one hundred.\r\n\r\n    \"The family physician prescribed light food, but her stomach\r\n    repulsed it. She grew very weak.\r\n\r\n    \"On April 26 she died. Dr. Chestnut unhesitatingly issued a\r\n    death certificate, ascribing her death to heart-failure. He also\r\n    suspected a cancer of the stomach, but was not sure.\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Herman Reinhardt, a cousin of the deceased woman, is\r\n    firmly convinced that fasting had nothing to do with her death.\r\n\r\n    \"'For more than fifteen years Mrs. Meyer suffered from some\r\n    acute stomach trouble,' Mrs. Reinhardt said yesterday, 'and it\r\n    is my belief that it caused her death. Her general health had\r\n    been greatly benefited by abstaining from all food, but the\r\n    disorder from which she suffered most could not be cured. My\r\n    husband fasted for twenty-five days and was completely cured of\r\n    stomach trouble, and there were no ill effects in his case.'\"\r\n\r\nThe impression of this death and of these fasts upon the minds of the\r\nmedical profession was perhaps fairly summed up by the eminent Horatio\r\nC. Wood, M. D., LL. D., Clinical Professor of Nervous Diseases in the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He disregarded the legal phase of the\r\nquestion, the question of the legality of a layman dealing out words of\r\ncheer and comfort in cases in which the medical profession had retired\r\nin total defeat. The question had been seriously raised as to whether\r\nMr. Ritter had not committed a crime against the laws of Pennsylvania,\r\nand for what? For simply advising these people to stop all eating until\r\nthere would come a natural desire for food!\r\n\r\nProfessor Wood thus gave utterance in the _Press_ of May 10:\r\n\r\n    \"'These people are falsifying,' he said, 'There have been liars,\r\n    you know, and they are not all dead. I don't believe for an\r\n    instant such stories as fasting totally for forty or fifty days\r\n    and keeping up energy and activity. It is contrary to common\r\n    sense as well as to all we know about the human body. I don't\r\n    know the object of deception, but somebody must be making money\r\n    out of it, or having a craving for notoriety. It is\r\n    preposterous. I understand that one of these fasters walked ten\r\n    miles a day, after doing altogether without nourishment for a\r\n    month or so. If these persons did what they claim to have\r\n    undergone, more than one death would have been charged against\r\n    the treatment, you may be sure.\r\n\r\n    \"'You will remember that the professional forty-day fasters,\r\n    Tanner and Suci, were reduced to mere skin and bone, were almost\r\n    helpless, carefully husbanded every bit of their vital energy,\r\n    and took no exercise. They were _watched_ and studied\r\n    scientifically. And here is a woman, weighing only one hundred\r\n    pounds when she started fasting, claims she began to eat after\r\n    thirty-eight days of starvation, and had more energy and took\r\n    more exercise than in years. It is all amazingly absurd,\r\n    whatever the motive may be.'\"\r\n\r\nTanner and Suci, \"skin and bones?\" Cowen weighed one hundred and\r\nseventy-five pounds when he began his forty-two day fast, and lost only\r\nthirty pounds. My case of acute rheumatism revealed a loss of only\r\nforty pounds after a forty-six days' fast; and the woman of fifty-seven\r\nwho began eating on the forty-third day was so well padded with muscle\r\nand fat as not to reveal the slightest suggestion of starvation as she\r\nsat down to the first meal. \"Skin and bones?\" This is a matter for\r\nmonths, and not for days.\r\n\r\n\"Falsifiers, these fasters?\" Science settles important questions by\r\ninvestigation, not by epithet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I write the closing pages of this book, the most taxing case of\r\nfasting that ever came under my care has ended in hunger, and I insert\r\nit that all may know what tribulations will be theirs if they have any\r\npart in letting their sick get well or die in that peace God and Nature\r\nclearly design for all.\r\n\r\nA man of large mould came to me, unknown, unbidden, from a distant city\r\non the seventeenth day of his fast. His appetite had been abolished by a\r\nsevere throat and bronchial attack, both of which had been relieved\r\nbefore reaching me. Well posted in the theory of fasting, he came with\r\nthe declared intention of fasting until hunger or death would come.\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks he was able to be about the city with his nearly\r\ntwo hundred pounds of flesh; but there was an unknown, unknowable\r\ndisease of the bowels and stomach in slow development. There were a\r\ndryness of the mouth and such aversion to food as to forbid all eating,\r\nand he was deaf to my suggestion that he should at least taste some of\r\nthe liquid foods from time to time, to save me in the eyes of his\r\nfriends from a verdict of homicide, were we to fail to win a victory.\r\nAfter more than fifty days without even a taste of food nausea and\r\nvomiting were added to his woes, and when his friends became aware of\r\nthe many days without food no words I could utter saved me from the\r\nseverest condemnation. The anxiety that involved the sick bed only\r\ndepressed the patient, and when another physician had to be called to\r\nrelieve the pressure the last hope with him nearly departed.\r\n\r\nThe adviser was a man of high character and of unusual general and\r\nprofessional acquirements. Behind him was the entire medical profession\r\nand all its literature: behind me were only Nature, many-voiced--and the\r\npatient. With us there was no lack of mutual respect, except in matters\r\nof faith and practice; but he no more tolerated my \"crankiness,\"\r\nlunacy--perhaps imbecility--in withholding food from the sick than I his\r\npaganism in enforcing it. For the sake of the agony of friends my noble\r\npatient accepted one severe dose of medicine and one ration of\r\npredigested food. The instant response of the digestive powers was, \"We\r\nhave stopped business down here for repairs: when we are ready we will\r\nlet you know.\"\r\n\r\nNext a ration of food was sent into the sick bowels, only to cause hours\r\nof pain. The enemy having been expelled with disaster from all points of\r\nattack, there simply had to be a waiting on Nature, and in one day after\r\nthe last vomiting spell there was a natural call for food--and this on\r\nthe _sixtieth day of the fast!_\r\n\r\nHad this man died--such was his prominence--I should have been paraded\r\nas a criminal of the stupid kind in the entire press of America, except\r\nin the papers of my own city. For this man of sixty-five, who with\r\nmarvellous faith in Nature patiently waited upon her time, there\r\npromises to be many years of the days of his youth restored to him. As\r\nfor me, with authorized medicine driven from the field, I see only new\r\nlife unfolding in him daily, and my reward is exceeding.\r\n\r\nMen and brethren of the medical profession: This man read his favorite\r\n_Sun_ during every one of those sixty long days, and not one day was\r\nthere revealed a hint of mental loss in clearness of apprehension. He\r\nlived because he knew that starving to death was his remotest danger; he\r\nlived also because he was made to see evidences that a cure was evolving\r\nin many ways. There was at no time apprehension, except when he felt\r\nunable to resist his friends with a _No_ in thunder tones when it was\r\nproposed to torture him with drugs and foods.\r\n\r\nBrethren, are you going into print to denounce the physiology or the\r\npracticality of this old method in Nature, this new method in humanity,\r\nto the sick and afflicted? Not one of you can advance arguments that\r\nwill convince those who reason.\r\n\r\nTo what good end are you now enforcing your _predigested_ foods? Are\r\nthey relished better than other foods? Can they be taken with less\r\naversion in cases of nausea and vomiting? Do they really nourish the\r\nbrain so as to add clearness and strength to the mind? Do they ever\r\nprevent the uncovering of bones that makes the ways of acute sickness?\r\nIf food actually can be so digested out of the body as to be ready for\r\ninstant absorption, we should be able to abolish our kitchens, and at\r\nonce enter upon that golden age in which there would be no dyspepsia\r\nhydraheaded; no disease of any kind, not even drunkenness, and where\r\ndeath would be only as the last flicker of the burned-up candle.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in all other cases, the desire for water was abolished\r\nbefore hunger became marked. In this connection I will suggest to the\r\nreader that thirst is a morbid condition to be avoided as far as\r\npossible; that water is its only need, and no mortal ever needs a drop\r\nfor health's sake except when thirsty. Making water-tanks of human\r\nstomachs is without the shade of physiological reason, and the alleged\r\nresults for good are not based on a shade of scientific evidence: these\r\nare based wholly in the minds of the credulous enthusiasts who prescribe\r\nthem. Taking large quantities of water without thirst only entails added\r\nwork upon the kidneys, and thus it becomes a factor in the development\r\nof Bright's disease and other forms where the tendency exists. The\r\nactual need of water is always made clear in every case; the need always\r\ndisappears before hunger can become possible.\r\n\r\nAs to the use of water on the body, this physiology has to be taken into\r\naccount. The skin is covered with scales that are constantly dropping\r\noff as they mature, each to uncover a bright, clean one. As the skin is\r\nnot an absorbent membrane, and as old scales are constantly dropping\r\noff, the need of frequent baths is more a need to satisfy the personal\r\nsense of cleanliness than a physiological need. These scales should not\r\nbe either soaked off or brushed off in a wholesale way; the oil in the\r\nskin is a protection against weather-changes, and is also a necessity to\r\nits functional integrity, and therefore should not be dissolved and\r\nwashed off by soaps that are strongly alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe body itself is very sensitive to contact with water below the\r\nnatural temperature of the skin. The plunge bath is specially depressing\r\nto every human energy, and should never be indulged by the debilitated.\r\nThe daily bathings of nursing children are cruel and life-depressing.\r\nTheir little bodies are always clean in the physiological sense when\r\ntheir clothes are kept clean; hence once a week ought to satisfy all\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nThe question of how often to bathe must be considered along these\r\nphysiological lines. They whose employments soil their clothes and\r\nbodies spend the least time in cleansing their bodies; and yet in no\r\nmedical work that treats of diseases and their causes is there to be\r\nfound a hint that any special disease has its origin in uncleansed skin\r\nas a chronic condition. That will be a small-minded reader who draws\r\nconclusions from these statements that the author is not highly in favor\r\nof having bodies and clothes kept so habitually clean as not to be an\r\noffence to the finest fibred olfactory nerve at close range. In the\r\nuse, then, of water on the body be physiologically sensible, and not the\r\nslaves of the bath-tub or \"medicated\" waters.\r\n\r\nLay readers, I draw my message to a close. I have addressed it to you\r\nbecause your minds are open and free. Draw near and listen while I talk\r\nrather than write. Let me look into your eyes, see the play on all the\r\nlines of expression, as I would were you in my consulting-room. Mine has\r\nreached your ears as a lone voice from the depths of some wilderness; I\r\nhave tried so to speak with my pen that you could catch an echo as if\r\nfrom between the lines of every page.\r\n\r\nYou will not banish your medical adviser, for you still need his\r\nknowledge of the workings of disease, if you do not need the drugs you\r\nformerly believed necessary; but you will now be able in a more\r\nintelligent way to diminish the possibilities of the future need of him.\r\n\r\nSince these wonderful fasts in Philadelphia others are occurring over\r\nthe country from the contagion of example. Many are certain to be\r\nundertaken as a last resort where hope has departed; and death will\r\ncome; and then there will be the confusion of tongues, as in the case of\r\nMrs. Meyer. Her case has been the third one that I know of where the\r\npress has spread the news of death from starvation.\r\n\r\nI have given you the case of Mrs. Meyer that you may know that no matter\r\nhow hopeless any case may be considered, no matter how given up by\r\nvenders of drugs, if a fast be advised and death come, death from\r\nstarvation will be the general verdict. Hence on as fasts multiply, so\r\nwill the press continue to make special note of all who chance to die\r\nbecause they had ceased to add distress to their bodies by foods that\r\nwere only taken as the medicinal dose. All this you need to take into\r\naccount in those cases you would advise where the medical faculty has\r\nretired in defeat.\r\n\r\nNever in my entire professional life have I been so depressed by\r\ndiscordant voices as during this sixty-day fast just ended. All the air\r\nhas been charged, darkened with frownings--even threats of what would\r\nhappen in case of death; and as never before has this question come to\r\nme, \"Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?\"\r\n\r\nAgain I must tell you that the No-breakfast Plan, the plan not to eat in\r\ntime of health until there are a normal need and desire for food, that\r\nare only developed after several hours of morning labor, and not to eat\r\nat all during acute sickness, is the easiest of all means to maintain\r\nhealth, and to regain it when lost. In my message I have had the\r\ngreatest good for the greatest number of the world's busy people, who\r\nhave no time to indulge abnormal, artificial ways in the recovery and\r\nmaintenance of health--ways that are a real tax on time and taxing in\r\nthe means involved. Passing few are they of the world's workers who\r\nhave the time for all this, and especially they who are the slaves of\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\nAgain I must suggest to you that the actual need of daily food as a\r\nmatter to meet the actual daily need is a new question in practical\r\nphysiology. It may be very much less than is supposed, a matter to be\r\ndetermined by the scales. There are none who can eat at all with relish\r\nwho are not more governed by relish than the hunger sense, as to the\r\namount of food eaten. The real amount of daily food needed may be so\r\nsmall that enough of nourishment can be extracted from almost any of the\r\neasiest available foods, the main question being one of slow eating,\r\nrestful eating, and with the most thorough mastication. For those who\r\nhave the leisure and tastes for study over what to eat there are the\r\nworks of Haig, Hoy, Hensel, Sir Henry Thompson, and others, that may be\r\nread with both interest and profit.\r\n\r\nAnd now I address my last words to the mothers of the land. For you the\r\nNo-breakfast Plan means the highest possible health, the greatest\r\npossible relief from the slavery of toil. On no other plan are there\r\nsuch promises of relief and prevention of all your sex ailings. On this\r\nplan only can you become man's equal in the hours of leisure that are\r\nhis by a feeling of divine right; you also should consider the\r\npossibilities of a day of eight or ten hours as needing the reduction\r\nall the more because of your weaker bodies.\r\n\r\nThe No-breakfast Plan means for your children the best possibilities\r\nfor the conservation of all the higher instincts and powers that will\r\ntend to save them from the saloon, the prison, the electric chair. If\r\nthe Garden of Eden was abolished because you enticed man to eat the\r\nwrong food, it is for you to restore a new race of Adams in all the ways\r\nof health, of such health as will make the entire earth a \"Paradise\r\nregained.\"\r\n\r\nReaders, lay and professional, let me reiterate in my parting words,\r\nwords at white heat with conviction as to their soundness and utility.\r\nEnforced food is a danger always to be measured by the gravity of the\r\nlocal or general disease; a danger always to be measured also by the\r\nfeebleness of old age--by feebleness no matter how caused.\r\n\r\nThis physiological righteousness will remain unquestioned, its\r\npracticality unsurpassed, while man remains on the earth to violate the\r\nlaws of his Creator manifest in his own body. The penalties of\r\ndisobedience are as certain as that every cause is followed by a\r\ndefinite effect. There are no remissions in the various antitoxins;\r\nthere is no hope for you through hollow needles. Nature is exacting, but\r\nshe is merciful. Obey her laws that your ways may be toward Paradise,\r\nand not away from it.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: The following words were spelled/hyphenated\r\ninconsistently in the original text and have not been changed:\r\nover-eating, overeating; centre, center; Cowan, Cowen; Suci, Succi.\r\n\r\nThe following corrections have been made to the original text.\r\n\r\nPage 64:\r\n  insistance changed to insistence\r\n\r\nPage 65:\r\n  abandaned changed to abandoned -- 'had been abandoned'\r\n\r\nPage 67:\r\n  opprobium changed to opprobrium\r\n\r\nPage 74:\r\n  constrast changed to contrast -- 'sluggishness by contrast'\r\n\r\nPage 122:\r\n  satifsying changed to satisfying -- 'about satisfying it'\r\n\r\nPage 160:\r\n  now changed to no -- 'no matter'\r\n\r\nPage 186:\r\n  frieght changed to freight -- 'human freight'\r\n\r\nPage 191:\r\n  wierd changed to weird -- 'weird treatment']",
