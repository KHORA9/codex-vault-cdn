It contains hundreds of suggestions\r\n  that hindsight shows to be purely \"mental\" in their effect.\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17439\r\n\r\n  One of the author's favorite terms is \"over-solicitous\". The patient\r\n  literally \"worrys themselves sick\" over trivial symptoms and makes\r\n  serious cases worse than necessary. Most of his use of psychotherapy\r\n  consists of informing, diverting and cheering the patient so that\r\n  worry and its consequences are not piled on top of real or imagined\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n  This book illustrates the general state of medicine in 1910.\r\n  Psychotherapy was more important to medical care because so little\r\n  was known of the complex physical mechanisms of the body. I\r\n  particularly reacted to the discussion of hay fever because it\r\n  plagued me for thirty years until experimental desensitization\r\n  therapy successfully cured my case. Nonetheless, much of value has\r\n  been lost with the decline of psychotherapy by the family physician.\r\n  A personal relationship with the physician is often replaced with\r\n  expensive impersonal technology that mostly tells what is not wrong.\r\n\r\n  Many paragraphs have bold or italic titles. These are rendered\r\n  by a extra blank line--a total of two blank lines.\r\n\r\n  Obvious spelling or typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n  Inconsistent spelling of names and inventive and alternative\r\n  spelling is left as printed.\r\n\r\n  The outline format of the book uses these conventions:\r\n    Major Topics, [Upper Case title]\r\n      Sections, [Upper Case, italic title]\r\n        Chapters,\r\n          Minor topics, denoted by bold face and an em-dash\r\n            Topic subheads denoted by italics and and em-dash\r\n\r\n  for example:\r\n    SPECIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n      SECTION VII. _Cardiotherapy_\r\n        Chapter III.

Five years ago he began at\r\nFordham University School of Medicine a series of lectures on\r\nPsychotherapy. This book consists of material gathered for these\r\nlectures. It will be found in many ways to partake more of the nature\r\nof a course of lectures than a true text-book. In this it follows\r\nFrench rather than English or American precedent. Its relation to\r\nlectures makes it more diffuse than the author would have wished, but\r\nthis is offered as an explanation, not an excuse. Addressed to medical\r\nstudents and not specialists the language employed is as untechnical\r\nas possible, and, indeed, was meant as a rule to be such as young\r\nphysicians might use to their patients for suggestion purposes.\r\n\r\nThe historical portion is probably longer than some may deem\r\nnecessary. The place of psychotherapy in the past seemed so important,\r\nhowever, and psychotherapeutics masqueraded under so many forms that\r\nan historical resume of its many phases appeared the best kind of an\r\nintroduction to a book which pleads for more extensive and more\r\ndeliberate use of psychotherapy in our time. The historical portion\r\nwas developed for the lectures on the history of medicine at Fordham\r\nand perhaps that fact helps to account for the space allotted to this\r\nsection of the book.\r\n\r\nSo far as the author knows, this is the first time in the history of\r\nmedicine that an attempt has been made to write a text-book of the\r\nwhole subject of psychotherapy. We have had many applications of\r\npsychotherapeutics to functional and organic nervous and mental\r\ndisease and also indirectly to nutritional diseases; but no one\r\napparently has attempted to systematize the application of\r\npsychotherapeutic principles, not only to functional diseases, but\r\nspecifically to all the organic diseases. A chapter on the use of\r\nmental influence in anesthesia was, during the course of the\r\npreparation of this volume, written for Dr. Taylor Gwathmey's\r\ntext-book on Anesthesia, which is to appear shortly (Appletons).\r\n\r\nNo one knows better than the author how difficult is the subject and\r\nhow liable to misunderstanding and abuse. He appreciates well, too,\r\nhow almost hopeless it would be to make a perfectly satisfactory\r\ntext-book of so large a subject at the first attempt. The present\r\nvolume is founded, however, on considerable experience, on wide\r\nreading in the subject, and on much reflection on its problems. It is\r\noffered to those who are interested in the old new department of\r\npsychotherapy until a better one is available. The author's principal\r\nidea in the book has been to help students and practitioners of {viii}\r\nmedicine to care for (_curare_) suffering men and women and not cases,\r\nto treat individual human beings, not compounds in which various\r\nchemical, physical and biological qualities have been observed,\r\ndiligently enough and with noteworthy success, but incompletely as\r\nyet, and quite without the satisfying adequacy which it is to be hoped\r\nwill result from future investigations.\r\n\r\n  James J.

Each generation announced its cures for\r\ndiseases, provided its remedies to relieve symptoms, and invented\r\nmethods of treatment that seemed to put off the inevitable tendency\r\ntoward dissolution. Yet few of these inventions and discoveries\r\nmaintain their early reputations, and succeeding generations\r\ninvariably abandon most of this supposed medical progress in favor of\r\nideas of their own, which later suffer a like fate. Plausible theories\r\nhave not been lacking to support the successive remedies and methods\r\nof treatment, but the general acceptance of them was always founded\r\nfar less upon theory than upon actual observation of their supposed\r\nefficacy. Certain remedies were given and the patients began to\r\nimprove. Patients who did not have the remedies continued to suffer,\r\nand sometimes the course of their disease led to a fatal termination.\r\nEven with the best remedies death sometimes took place, but that was\r\neasily accounted for on the ground that the disease had secured so\r\nfirm a hold that it could not be dislodged, even by a good remedy. The\r\nconnection of cause and effect between the administration of the\r\nremedy and the improvement and eventual cure of the patient seemed to\r\nbe demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe archives of old-time medicine disprove the notion that clinical\r\nlearning and teaching--that is, observation and demonstration at the\r\nbedside--were not part of medical education until quite modern times.\r\nThe medical books of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies are full of descriptions of actual cases, while, over a\r\nmillenium before, one of Martial's epigrams tells of a patient who\r\ndreaded the coming of his physician because he brought with him so\r\nmany students, whose cold hands gave chills to the poor victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincidence and Consequence.--In spite of the opportunities for\r\ncareful observation thus afforded and the facilities for training\r\nclinical observers in medicine, many remedies came into vogue, were\r\nenthusiastically applied, and then, after a time, went out of use and\r\nwere heard of no more. Sometimes they were subsequently revived and\r\nhad even a greater vogue than when originally brought out. But most of\r\nthese remedies eventually went forever into the lumber room of disused\r\ntreatments. Of the many thousands of remedies which had the approval\r\nand the praise of past generations, two score at most hold a place in\r\nthe pharmacopeia of to-day.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for this initial success and eventual failure;\r\nbut the most important explanation lies not so much in reason as in\r\ncoincidence. In the majority of human ills there is a definite\r\ntendency to get better, and almost anything that is given to the\r\npatient will be followed by relief and {2} improvement. The recovery\r\nis not, however, on account of the remedy, but occurs only after a\r\ndefinite succession of events that would have taken place either with\r\nor without the remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence.--What the old physicians did not, as a rule,\r\nappreciate, or at least failed to value at its true significance, was\r\nthe effect upon the patient's mind of the taking of a remedy. Because\r\nof the confidence with which it was given, the patient, having full\r\nfaith in the physician who gave it, became impressed with the idea\r\nthat now he must get well. The very presence of the physician and his\r\nassurance that the illness was not serious and that many symptoms that\r\nwere sources of dread to the patient were only concomitant conditions\r\nof the ailment, naturally to be expected under the circumstances,\r\nrelieved the patient from worry, and so gave his nervous energy a\r\nchance to exert itself in bringing about improvement. In other words,\r\nthe suggestive elements of the presence of the physician and the\r\ntaking of his remedy were important therapeutic factors which enabled\r\nwhat was an absolutely inefficient remedy, as the event proved when\r\ncloser observations of it had been made, to relieve even serious\r\nsymptoms, or helped a weak remedy to accomplish good results by\r\nstrengthening the patient's resistive vitality.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have come to study much more closely this\r\nsuggestive element and to appreciate better its true value. Suggestion\r\nhas always been an important factor in therapeutics, but has been used\r\nindeliberately and indirectly rather than with careful forethought.\r\nNot that the great thinkers in medicine have not known its value and\r\nhave not used it deliberately on appropriate occasions, but that the\r\nprofession generally has been so much occupied with the merely\r\nmaterial means of curing that practitioners have not realized the\r\ninfluence for good of the psychotherapeutic factors they were\r\nunconsciously employing.\r\n\r\nThe history of the phases of psychotherapy brings out clearly how much\r\nit has always meant in the curing of human ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstancy of Psychotherapy in Medicine.--Though we are prone to think\r\nof it as coming to attention in our time, psychotherapy has played an\r\nimportant role in every phase of the history of medicine. It has\r\nalways been at work, though usually under other names, and has been\r\neffectively used without conscious direction. Germs and their\r\npernicious activity were not recognized before our time, yet many\r\ndefinite precautions against them, such as cooking of food and the\r\nkeeping of perishable goods on ice, which now seem to be the direct\r\nresult of our knowledge of bacteriology, were commonly practiced. The\r\ninfluence of the mind on the body exerted itself quite apart from\r\nman's recognition of its place or appreciation of its power. When\r\nemployed unconsciously it was in many ways even more effective than it\r\nwill be when a consciousness of the means by which it is applied\r\nbecomes more general. For most people are unwilling to confess that\r\ntheir minds exercise as much influence as now proves to be the case,\r\nand that over-solicitude means so much in inhibiting the curative\r\npowers of nature, and that it is this which is favorably affected by\r\npsychotherapy.\r\n\r\nThe great physicians employed psychotherapy very commonly, and on that\r\naccount many of their disciples were inclined to think that they were\r\nneglectful of medication and other remedial measures. At all times\r\nphysicians have had to be large-minded and have had to recognize the\r\nlimitations of medicine in {3} their own time, to turn to other agents\r\nand to appreciate how much their own influence on the patient and that\r\nof the patient on himself meant for the relief of symptoms and the\r\nincrease of resistive vitality.\r\n\r\nSome of the phases of indeliberate psychotherapy, however, are even\r\nmore interesting than this chapter of the history of genuine and\r\ndeliberate psycho-therapeutics. Not a few of the remedies recommended,\r\neven by distinguished physicians, were utterly inert, yet accomplished\r\ngood through their effect upon the patient's mind. If we were to omit\r\nall reference to certain favorite prescriptions that passed down from\r\ngeneration to generation, sometimes for centuries, yet eventually\r\nproved to be quite inefficient for the purpose for which they were\r\nemployed, what a large lacuna would be left in the history of medical\r\ntreatment! Galen's _theriac_ is a typical example of this. Still more\r\nstrikingly the role of psychotherapy is seen in the many remedies that\r\nwere recommended at various times for such self-limited diseases as\r\nerysipelas, ordinary coughs and colds, pneumonia and typhoid fever.\r\nAnything that was administered just before the change for the better\r\ncame in these diseases, or that was persistently taken until that\r\nchange came, was proclaimed as curative.\r\n\r\nAn even more interesting chapter in the positive history of\r\npsychotherapy is that which shows how the value of genuine remedies\r\nwas exaggerated by suggestion, and how these remedies became\r\ntherapeutic fads, and sometimes almost seemed to be cure-alls. What a\r\nlarge place antimony holds in medical history, though it is now\r\nentirely discredited! How beneficent has venesection seemed, though it\r\nis now frankly confessed that it has but a narrow usefulness for a\r\nvery circumscribed set of ills! Calomel in large doses has a history\r\nvery like that of antimony. Alcohol in various forms, now so\r\nstrikingly losing its hold in therapeutics, must also be placed in\r\nthis category.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy has perhaps had its most fruitful field of potency in\r\nconnection with discoveries in the physical sciences. Whenever a\r\ndiscovery has been made in any science, an application of it to\r\nmedicine has been mooted by some fertile mind, though as a rule it\r\neventually proved to have no place in medicine. One might ordinarily\r\nexpect that the suggestion would be latent only when the discovery was\r\nin one of the sciences allied to medicine, but this relation has not\r\nbeen necessary. Discoveries in astronomy even, in light, in\r\nelectricity, in every department of physical science, have each been\r\ngiven their opportunity to affect patients' minds favorably, and have\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrregular Phases of Psychotherapy.--The quack has always been a\r\npsycho-therapeutist _par excellence_. His main stock in trade has been\r\nhis knowledge of men and his power to convince them that he was able\r\nto do them good, so that he could tap all the sources of energy that\r\nwere in the patient, some of them quite latent, yet of great\r\nefficiency. Often what the quack and the nostrum vender did for their\r\npatients was calculated to do harm rather than good, yet the mental\r\nenergy aroused by the appeal to the patients' minds was sufficient not\r\nonly to neutralize the evil, but to release curative powers that\r\notherwise would not have been called out. The advertisements of the\r\nnostrum maker have proved especially effective, and printer's ink,\r\nproperly administered, has been a most potent remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrug Therapeutics.--Many of the newer phases of mental healing pretend\r\nto do away with drugs. Nothing is farther from my purpose than to\r\ncondemn drugs: I am simply pointing out how much supposed drug\r\nefficacy has been {4} due to the mental influence on the patient of\r\nthe suggestion that went with the drugs. There has been no thought at\r\nall of pushing drugs out of the extremely valuable place they occupy\r\nin medicine, for I yield to no one in my thorough conviction of their\r\nusefulness. But the efficacious element in the administration of many\r\ndrugs has been entirely the confidence of the physician in them, which\r\nconfidence was communicated to the patient's mind. Undoubtedly many\r\nhighly recommended drugs have in themselves tended to do harm rather\r\nthan good, and have been useful only because of this\r\npsycho-therapeutic element. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous\r\nexpression, that if all the drugs that had ever been used had been\r\nthrown into the sea instead of put into patients' bodies the human\r\nrace might have been the better for it, should not be taken to mean\r\nthat a great many drugs are not efficacious. Above all, it leaves out\r\nthe most important consideration, that patients, while taking drugs\r\nthat are either inert or at times even slightly harmful, have had\r\ntheir mental attitude towards themselves and their ills so favorably\r\nmodified by the repeated suggestion that the result has been\r\ndistinctly beneficial.\r\n\r\nThere are probably two score of drugs that are simply\r\ninvaluable--magnificent auxiliaries in times of physical and mental\r\ndistress. To realize and appreciate the place of these drugs, their\r\nlimitations, how they should be administered, and what they can do\r\nunder varying circumstances, has taken us centuries. When to these\r\ndrugs there is intelligently attached the influence that psychotherapy\r\nhas over the patient, their efficacy is probably doubled. Without that\r\ninfluence nature often works against the drug and lowers its\r\nefficiency. That is the reason why physicians, when themselves\r\npatients, do not respond well to drugs. Familiarity has bred contempt\r\nfor some of the old-fashioned remedies, but the contempt that comes\r\nfrom familiarity is often quite undeserved, and many of the things\r\nthat we thus undervalue because of accustomedness have a power that\r\nshould be respected. People in a dynamite factory become so familiar\r\nwith danger as to despise it at times, but that does not lessen the\r\nenergy of the dynamite when occasion arises. When the physician\r\nhimself is ill he is likely to remember his failures with drugs rather\r\nthan his successes. That is, however, only the tendency of human\r\nnature to a certain pessimistic outlook where we ourselves are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThere is another class in whom familiarity with drugs has become a\r\nserious matter. They are the patients who have made the rounds of\r\nphysicians, have learned to read prescriptions, have looked up the\r\nsignificance of the various remedies that they have seen prescribed,\r\nhave heard doctors talk about them, and remember only what is\r\ndepreciatory, and who critically examine a prescription and conclude\r\nthat the remedies recommended are not likely to do them good. Every\r\nphysician knows the hopeless condition such patients are in. Mental\r\nattitude will greatly help drugs, and it can utterly undo the effect\r\nof all drugs except those which have certain drastic mechanical\r\neffects. Drug failure in these cases is another illustration of how\r\nmuch psychotherapy means in connection with drug treatment.\r\n\r\nNot only is there no intent, then, to lessen respect for drugs in this\r\ntextbook of psychotherapeutics, but the one thing that the author\r\nwould like to emphasize is the necessity for giving drugs in\r\nsufficient doses. Recommendations in text-books of medicine are often\r\nvague in their indications as to dosage, and surprisingly small doses\r\nare, in consequence, sometimes prescribed. {5} Practically the only\r\nremedial element of such small doses is the mental effect on the\r\npatient, whereas a combination of pharmaceutic and psychotherapeutic\r\nfactors would be much more efficacious. It is not unusual to find that\r\nthe patient who is supposed to be taking nux vomica as an appetizer or\r\na muscle tonic, or in order to produce heart equilibrium in the\r\ncardiac neuroses, is getting five drops, two and a half minims, three\r\ntimes a day, when he should be getting at least twenty drops with the\r\nsame frequency. I have known a physician to prescribe ten grains of\r\nbromid where thirty to sixty grains should have been prescribed, and\r\nsuch valuable pharmaceutic materials as bismuth and pepsin are often\r\ngiven in doses so small that they preclude all possibility of benefit\r\nexcept by mental influence.\r\n\r\nWith therapeutic nihilism or skepticism of the power of drugs I have\r\nno sympathy. As a teacher of medicine I have for years emphasized the\r\nnecessity of the use not of conventional doses of drugs for every\r\npatient, but of doses proportioned to the body weight. It seems to me\r\nquite absurd to give the same amount of a drug to a woman who weighs a\r\nhundred pounds and to a man who weighs two hundred and fifty pounds of\r\nsolid muscular tissue. I believe in using drugs well up to their\r\nphysiological effects if the drugs are really indicated.\r\n\r\nWith regard to other modes of treatment the same thing is true. Where\r\nthey are indicated, balneo-therapy, hydro-therapy, mechano-therapy,\r\nelectro-therapy, massage, and all the forms of external treatment,\r\nshould be used rationally and not merely conventionally. The\r\nindividual and not his affection must be treated. In all of these\r\nmethods there is a psychotherapeutic element, and for the benefit of\r\nthe patient this, too, must be recognized and used to its fullest\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposed Novelties in Mind Healing.--We hear much of mental healing,\r\nof absent treatment, of various phases of suggestion, and of the\r\nmarvelous therapeutic efficiency of complete denial of the existence\r\nof evil, and sometimes we wonder whether all these things are not\r\noffshoots of our recent growth in the knowledge of psychology. It is\r\npossible, however, to find, masquerading under the head of the\r\nefficacy of nostrums in the past, the equivalents for all the\r\nactivities of mental healing of the present. It all depends on what is\r\nthe scientific fad of the hour. If it is electricity, then some mode\r\nof electrical treatment serves the purpose of suggesting cure, and\r\nrelief of symptoms follows. If drug treatment of any particular kind\r\nis attracting much attention, then the suggestion is most effective\r\nthat is founded on this basis. Perkins' tractors or the Leyden jar are\r\neffective at one time, radium or the X-rays at another, sarsaparilla\r\nor dilute alcohol at another, while a generation that is much\r\ninterested in psychology may find, as ours does to a noteworthy\r\ndegree, quite sufficient favorable suggestion for the cure of many\r\nills in purely psychic influences, either direct or indirect,\r\ndeliberate or unconscious.\r\n\r\nMen and women do not change, their ills are about the same, and except\r\nfor certain definite scientific remedies it is only the superficial\r\nmode of treatment that differs very much. Psychotherapy has always\r\nbeen an important element in most of the therapeutics of history. With\r\nso much accomplished in the past by indirection, there can be no doubt\r\nbut that important advances in psychotherapeutics must result from the\r\nextension of its deliberate use.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet reached a point in our knowledge of the mode of the\r\n{6} influence of the mind on the body that will enable us to treat\r\nthis large subject in a scientific manner. What has been written is\r\nset down rather as suggestive than conclusive. There is almost nothing\r\nthat the human mind cannot do, its power ranging from the ability to\r\ndelay death for hours or even days to causing sudden or unlooked for\r\ndeath under strong emotional strain. But we are as yet without\r\ndefinite data as to the possibilities of the immense power for good,\r\nand also for ill, that lie unrevealed in this domain. Anything that\r\nmakes for observations by a large body of trained observers in a large\r\nnumber of cases will almost surely serve to bring about a development\r\nof this subject of valuable practical application.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy is open to large abuse. It will happen that men who are\r\nnot trained in diagnosis will occasionally try to use\r\npsychotherapeutic means when what is needed is the knife, the actual\r\ncautery, a good purge, some strong drug, or other efficient remedy\r\nwhose value has been demonstrated and which any trained physician can\r\nuse. It will also happen that men who lack tact will occasionally\r\ndisturb patients' minds still further by what they say to them in a\r\nmistaken attempt at psychotherapy, and will sometimes suggest other\r\nsymptoms and make sufferers worse by their clumsy attempts to remove\r\nsymptoms that are already present. Every good thing, however, is open\r\nto the same objection. Even good food is abused. The use of drugs has\r\nbeen so abused that the abuse has done much to discredit medicine at\r\nmany periods. There is a Latin proverb which says: \"From the abuse of\r\na thing no argument against its use can be drawn.\" We cannot prevent\r\nliability to abuse, and psychotherapy is sure to meet that fate. It\r\nhas been abused in the past, and is abused now, and always will be\r\nabused, but formal study of psychotherapy and its deliberate\r\nemployment will do more than anything else to limit the inevitable\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nIf its place in history and in medicine is definitely set forth, its\r\nproblems squarely faced and their solutions definitely suggested, it\r\nis much less likely to be misused. At least, then, the whole subject\r\nis open for free and frank discussion and for such additions and\r\nsubtractions as may make this department of therapeutics as important,\r\nor at least in a measure as valuable, as climato-therapy or\r\nbalneo-therapy or mechano-therapy or electro-therapy. The development\r\nof each of these subjects has proved helpful. It is true that each\r\nspecialist has, in the eyes of his colleagues in general practice,\r\nexaggerated the significance of his own department. This is true in\r\nall specialties, however, and psychotherapy deserves quite as much as\r\nany of the subjects we have mentioned to have a place among the\r\ntext-books of medicine; and so this one is committed to the judgment\r\nof clinical observers. Long ago Horace said:\r\n\r\n  Si quid novisti rectius his candidus imperti\r\n  Si non his utere mecum.\r\n\r\n\r\n{7}\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\n_PSYCHOTHERAPY IN THE HISTORY OP MEDICINE_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGREAT PHYSICIANS IN PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The real physician is the one who cures: the observation which does\r\nnot touch the art of healing is not that of a physician, it is that of\r\na naturalist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy is as old as the history of medicine and may be traced\r\nto the earliest ages. The great physicians of all time have recognized\r\nits value, have used it themselves and commended its use to their\r\ndisciples, though realizing its mysterious side and appreciating its\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\nThe first physician of whom we have any record was I-em-Hetep, who\r\nlived in the reign of King Tcsher of the third dynasty of Egypt,\r\nprobably before 4000 B. C. Among his titles, besides that of Master of\r\nSecrets, was Bringer of Peace. He was looked up to as one who, when\r\nnot able to cure physical ailments, did succeed in consoling and\r\nreassuring patients so as to make their condition much more bearable.\r\nLike others of the great early physicians, he was after his death\r\nworshiped as a god, a tribute which probably signifies that those who\r\nhad been benefited by his ministrations felt that he must have been\r\nmore than mortal.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Egyptians' admiration for him will be appreciated\r\nfrom the fact that the step pyramid at Sakkara is said to have been\r\nbuilt in his honor, though, as a rule, pyramids were erected only to\r\nhonor kings or the very highest nobility. The extant statue of\r\nI-em-Hetep shows a placid-looking man with an air of beneficent\r\nwisdom, seated with a scroll on his knees. It produces the distinct\r\nimpression, as may be seen from the illustration, that his patients\r\nmust have trusted him thoroughly, since this is the memory of his\r\npersonality that was transmitted to posterity. While he came to be\r\nlooked upon as the medical divinity of the Egyptians, he was never\r\nrepresented with a beard, which is the token of the gods, or of\r\nmortals who have been really apotheosized. Evidently his devotees felt\r\nthat it was the divine in his humanity which was the most prominent\r\nfeature that they wished to honor. Among the Greeks AEsculapius, who\r\nhad been merely a successful physician, came to be honored as a deity.\r\nWhen we recall the condition of therapeutics at that {8} time, it is\r\nevident that man's appreciation of his power to console, even though\r\nhe might not be able to heal, of his influence over men's minds in the\r\nmidst of their sufferings, and the confidence that his presence\r\ninspired, were the real sources of their grateful recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY IN EGYPT\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptians the first great development of medicine came among\r\nthe priests. The two professions, the medical and priesthood, were\r\none, and the temples were the hospitals of the time. We have stories\r\nof people traveling long distances to certain temples in the early\r\ndays of Egypt and also of Greece. Often the sick slept in the temples\r\nand dreamed of ways by which they would be cured. The stories make one\r\nfeel that somehow the sleep which came over them was not entirely\r\nnatural and spontaneous, but must have been something like hypnotic\r\nsleep. As for the dreams, the suggestions of modern time given in the\r\nhypnotic condition seem to be the best indication that we have of what\r\nhappened in those old days. Certain it is that the persuasion of the\r\npatient that he would get better, the influence of the diversion of\r\nmind consequent upon his journey and the regulation of life under new\r\ncircumstances in the temple, with the repeated suggestions of the\r\npriests and of their various remedial measures, as well as those due\r\nto the fact that other patients around him were improving, all plainly\r\nshow the place of psychotherapy at this time.\r\n\r\nMuch of the old-time therapy was in association with dreams supposed\r\nto have been in some way inspired. This was true at Epidaurus, at Kos,\r\nat Rome, at Lebene, at Athens, and at every place we know of where\r\ncures were worked in the olden times. To the modern mind it seems\r\nimpossible that dreams should come so apropos unless they were in some\r\nway directed. The only explanation seems to be the use of suggestion,\r\nwith the probable production of sleep resembling our modern hypnotic\r\ntrance. Apparently the patient's attention was little directed to the\r\norigin of the suggestions received, but he remembered and benefited by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe most explicit testimony that we have to the antiquity of\r\npsychotherapeutics and to the employment of the influence of the minds\r\nof patients over their ailments in the olden time is in Pinel's\r\n\"Nosographie philosophique\" and in his \"Traite medico-philosophique\r\nsur l'alienation mentale.\"\r\n\r\nPinel himself will be remembered as the great French psychiatrist who,\r\nconfident that he could control most of them by mental influence,\r\nfirst dared to strike the chains from the insane in the asylums of\r\nParis, at the end of the eighteenth century, when for more than a\r\ncentury they had been treated more barbarously than ever before in\r\nhistory. The passage makes clear that the writer himself, over a\r\nhundred years ago, was persuaded of the significance of the patient's\r\nmental attitude and of the value of mental treatment for many nervous\r\nand mental diseases:\r\n\r\n  An intimate acquaintance with human nature and with the character in\r\n  general of melancholics must always point out the urgent necessity  of\r\n  forcibly agitating the system, of interrupting the chain of their\r\n  gloomy ideas, and of engaging their interest by powerful and\r\n  continuous impressions on their external senses. Wise regulations of\r\n  this nature are considered as having constituted in part the\r\n  celebrity and utility of the priesthood of ancient Egypt. Efforts of\r\n  industry and of art, scenes of magnificence and of grandeur, the\r\n  varied pleasures of sense, and\r\n{9}\r\nthe imposing influences of a pompous and mysterious superstition, were\r\nperhaps never devoted to a more laudable purpose. At both extremities\r\nof ancient Egypt, a country which was at that time exceedingly\r\npopulous and flourishing, were temples dedicated to Saturn, whither\r\nmelancholics resorted in crowds in quest of relief. The priests,\r\ntaking advantage of their credulous confidence, ascribed to miraculous\r\npowers the effects of natural means exclusively. Games and recreations\r\nof all kinds were instituted in these temples. Beautiful paintings and\r\nimages were everywhere exposed to public view. The most enchanting\r\nsongs, and sounds the most melodious \"took prisoner the captive\r\nsense.\" Flowery gardens and groves, disposed with taste and art,\r\ninvited them to refreshment and salubrious exercise. Gaily decorated\r\nboats sometimes transported them to breathe, amidst rural concerts,\r\nthe pure breezes of the Nile. Sometimes they were conveyed to its\r\nverdant Isles, where, under the symbols of some guardian deity, new\r\nand ingeniously contrived entertainments were prepared for their\r\nreception. Every moment was devoted to some pleasurable occupation, or\r\nrather a system of diversified amusements, enhanced and sanctioned by\r\nsuperstition. An appropriate and scrupulously observed regimen,\r\nrepeated excursions to the holy places, preconcerted fetes at\r\ndifferent stages to excite and keep up their interest on the road,\r\nwith every other advantage of a similar nature that the experienced\r\npriesthood could invent or command, were, in no small degree,\r\ncalculated to suspend the influence of pain, to calm the inquietudes\r\nof a morbid mind, and to operate salutary changes in the various\r\nfunctions of the system.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Temple at Epidaurus as a Health Resort]\r\n\r\n  This gives some slight idea of the magnificent arrangement of this\r\n  famous health resort of the Greeks in which every possible care was\r\n  taken to influence the mind of the patient favorably and bring about\r\n  his cure. The buildings of the Hieron or medical institution of\r\n  Epidaurus were beautifully situated about six miles from the town of\r\n  Epidaurus in picturesque scenery and the most healthful\r\n  surroundings. There were a series of bathing houses for hydropathy.\r\n  The abatons, lofty and airy sleeping chambers with their southern\r\n  sides and open colonnade, are singularly like the open balconies of\r\n  our tuberculosis sanatoria. Every occupation of mind was provided.\r\n  There was a theatre that would seat over 10,000 people. Here the\r\n  great classic Greek plays were given with fullest effect. There was\r\n  a stadium seating about 12,000 people in which athletic events were\r\n  witnessed, finally there was a hippodrome for alt sorts of\r\n  amusements in which animals shared. Then there were the walks\r\n  through the country, sheltered paths around the grounds for\r\n  inclement weather, even tunnels for passage from one building to\r\n  another and all the influence of religion, of suggestion, of contact\r\n  with cultured priests thoroughly accustomed to dealing with all\r\n  manner of patients. No wonder the place was popular and many cures\r\n  effected.\r\n\r\n  A, South Propylaea; B, Gymnasium; C, Temple of Esculapius; DD, East\r\n  and West Abatons (temple enclosures); E, Pholos;  F, Temple of\r\n  Artemis; G, Grove; H, Small Altar; I, Large Alter; J, South\r\n  Boundary; K, Square (building); L, Baths of Esculapius; M, Gymnasium\r\n  and Hostel; N, Four Quadrangles (for promenade and exercise); O,\r\n  Roman Building; P, Roman Bath; Q, Portico of Cotys; R, Northeastern\r\n  Colonnade; S, Northeastern Quadrangle; T, Temple of Aphrodite (?);\r\n  U, Northern Propylaea, on the Road to Epidaurus; V, Roman Building;\r\n  W, Northern Boundary; X, Stadium; Y, Goal or Starting Line; Z, Tunnel\r\n  between Temple and Stadium. (Caton.)\r\n\r\n  [End Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other phases of Egyptian medicine which serve to show us how\r\nearly many of the psychological ideas that we now are trying to adopt\r\nand adapt in medicine had come to the thinkers in medicine of long\r\nago. There is, for instance, now in the Berlin museum an interesting\r\npapyrus of the Middle Kingdom, the date of which is about 2500 B. C,\r\nin which there are many modern ideas. It is a dialogue which attempts\r\nthe justification of suicide. The principal speaker, a man weary of\r\nlife, has made up his mind to suicide, but is hesitant. The others who\r\nspeak in the dialogue are his _secondary personalities_. The Egyptians\r\nconsidered that there were several of these interior persons with whom\r\nthe man himself might have communication. A man could play draughts\r\nwith his _ba_ somewhat as we play solitaire. He could talk to and\r\nexchange gifts with his _ka_. He could argue and remain at variance,\r\nbut more often come to an agreement, with his _khou_. This last was\r\nhis luminous immortal _ego_, which, according to the then generally\r\nreceived Egyptian conception, formed a complete and independent\r\npersonality. The whole scene thus outlined is typically modern in\r\ncertain phases of its psychology, and presents the only known\r\ntreatment for the tendency to suicide. While we have but this\r\ninstance, there seems no doubt that the same system of persuasion must\r\nhave been employed for the cure of other mental conditions than that\r\nwhich predisposes to suicide.\r\n\r\nWhat is described in our quotation from Pinel as the most ancient form\r\nof psychotherapy has all down the centuries been the rule of life for\r\npatients at institutions similar to those of Egypt. We know more of\r\nGreece than of other countries; there the shrines of AEsculapius were\r\nin many ways what we now call sanatoria. They were spacious buildings\r\npleasantly situated, the hours of rising and of rest were definitely\r\nregulated, the patients' minds were occupied with the details of the\r\ncure, they met pleasant companions from distant places, they had all\r\nthe advantages of diversion of mind, simple diet, long hours in the\r\nopen air and abundance of rest away from the ordinary worries of life.\r\nBesides, there had usually been some weeks or months of {10}\r\npreparation during a lengthy journey and all the diversion of mind\r\nwhich that implies. No wonder that these institutions acquired a\r\nreputation for cures of symptoms which the physician had been unable\r\nto accomplish while the patient was at home in the midst of his daily\r\ncares and worries of life.\r\n\r\nThe temples in Egypt, in Assyria, in Greece, were much like the health\r\ninstitutions--\"cure houses,\" as the expressive German phrase calls\r\nthem--of our day. Pictures of the temple of AEsculapius at Epidaurus\r\nshow a magnificent building with beautiful grounds, ample bathing\r\nfacilities, and evidently many opportunities for a quiet, easy life\r\nfar from the worries and bustle of the world and with everything that\r\nwould suggest to the patient that he must get well. This phase of\r\npsychotherapy in the olden time is not only interesting in itself, but\r\nfurnishes a valuable commentary on corresponding modern institutions,\r\nsince it shows that it is not so much the physical influences, which\r\nhave differed markedly at different periods, as the mental attitude so\r\nconstantly influenced at these institutions which was the real\r\ntherapeutic factor.\r\n\r\nNow our sanatoria are nearly all founded on some special principle of\r\ntherapeutics. Some of them have dietetic fads and no food out of which\r\nthe life has been cooked is eaten. Some of them are absolutely\r\nvegetarian. Some of them depend on wonderful springs in their\r\nneighborhoods, others on certain forms of exercise, still others give\r\nthe rest cure. All succeed in relieving many symptoms. No one who has\r\nanalyzed the cures effected will think for a moment that it is the\r\nspecial therapeutic fad of the institution that accomplishes all the\r\ngood done for patients suffering from so many different complaints.\r\nSimilar ills often are affected quite differently, and, while some are\r\nrelieved, others are not. Those who fail to be cured at one will,\r\nhowever, often be relieved at another. It depends on how much\r\ninfluence of mind is secured over the patient and how much diversion\r\nfrom thoughts of self is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIND HEALING IN GREECE\r\n\r\nWhen Greece awoke to the great literary and scientific discussion of\r\nhuman thought that gave us such philosophic and scientific thinkers as\r\nHippocrates, Plato and Aristotle, then psychotherapy, in the formal\r\nsense of caring for the mind of the patient as well as for his body,\r\ncame to be explicitly recognized as having therapeutic value.\r\nHippocrates insisted that medicine was an art rather than a science,\r\nthat personality had much to do with it, and that the patient must be\r\noptimistically influenced in every way. The first of his aphorisms is\r\nwell known, but few realize all of its significance. Hippocrates\r\ndeclares that \"life is short and art long, the occasion fleeting,\r\nexperience fallacious and judgment difficult. The physician must not\r\nonly be prepared to do what is right himself, _but also to make the\r\npatient, the attendants and externals cooperate.\"_ No one emphasized\r\nmore than he the necessity for differentiating the individual patient,\r\nand to him we owe, in foundation at least, the aphorism that it is\r\nmore important to know what sort of an individual has a disease than\r\nwhat sort of a disease the individual has, for the chances of cure\r\ngreatly depend on favorable individuality.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Hippocrates' most striking direct contribution to\r\npsychotherapy is his aphorism with regard to pain. He said: \"Of two\r\npains occurring together in different parts of the body, the stronger\r\nweakens the other.\" When {11} the attention is distracted from pain,\r\nthen it is lessened. Of two pains, then, only the one that attracts\r\nthe most attention is much felt, and, if a slight pain is succeeded by\r\na severe pain in another part of the body, the lesser pain will\r\napparently become trivial, or, indeed, not be felt at all.\r\n\r\nIn Plato we find the direct philosophic expression of the value of\r\npsychotherapy. There had been during the preceding century a great\r\nincrease in information with regard to the facts of physical nature,\r\nand especially the sciences relating to the human body, and so men had\r\ncome, as they are prone to at such eras--our own, for instance--to\r\nthink too much of the body and too little of the mind that rules it.\r\nAccordingly, we have from Plato a deliberate, emphatic assertion of\r\nthis great truth under circumstances which make us realize how keenly\r\nhe appreciated its significance for the art of medicine and for\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nProfessor Osier, in his address, \"Physic and Physicians as Depicted in\r\nPlato,\" [Footnote 1] tells a story which shows clearly how much the\r\ngreat Greek philosopher appreciated the place of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: \"AEquanimitas and Other Addresses.\"]\r\n\r\n  Charmides had been complaining of a headache, and Critias had asked\r\n  Socrates to make believe that he could cure him of it. Socrates said\r\n  that he had a charm which he had learnt, when serving with the army,\r\n  of one of the physicians of the Thracian king. Zamolxis. This\r\n  physician had told Socrates that the cure of a part should not be\r\n  attempted without treatment of the whole, and, also, that no attempt\r\n  should be made to cure the body without the soul, \"and, therefore, if\r\n  the head and body are to be well, you must begin by curing the mind;\r\n  that is the first thing. And he who taught me the cure and the charm\r\n  added a special direction. 'Let no one,' he said, 'persuade you to\r\n  cure the head until he has first given you his soul to be cured. _For\r\n  this,'_ he said, _'is the great error of our day in the treatment of\r\n  the human body, that physicians separate the soul from the body._'\"\r\n\r\nBecause it anticipates so much that is thought to be recent in the\r\ntreatment of certain affections this paragraph is interesting from\r\nmany standpoints. Headache is typically one of the ills that in the\r\nmodern time has often been cured by suggestion. Critias knew how much\r\nconfidence Charmides had in Socrates, whom he looked upon as his\r\nmaster, and that, therefore, Socrates' declaration of his power to\r\ncure would probably be sufficient to relieve his disciple. Critias\r\nshrewdly suggests, however, that Socrates possessed a charm which he\r\nhad learned from a distinguished royal physician. Cures in the modern\r\ntime of any kind are likely to be much more effective if they come\r\nfrom a distance and, above all, if they have some connection with\r\nroyalty, or have been tried with favorable results upon distinguished\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDRIAN PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\nWhen the center of interest in Greek medicine was transferred from\r\nGreece itself to Egypt, and the Alexandrian school represented what\r\nwas best in medical thinking and investigation, we find evidence once\r\nmore of wise physicians realizing the influence of the mind on the\r\nbody and of what seemed to physicians of lesser experience the cure of\r\nphysical ills by mental means. One of the most distinguished\r\nphysicians of all time is Erasistratos, who, with Herophilus, made the\r\nfame of the great medical school at Alexandria, {12} the first\r\nuniversity medical school in the world's history. Both practiced\r\ndissection with assiduity, and, while it is Herophilus' name that is\r\nassociated with the _torcular_ within the skull, and it was he who\r\ngave the name _calamus scriptorius_ to certain appearances in the\r\nfourth ventricle, and otherwise stamped his personality on the study\r\nof the brain, it is to Erasistratos that we have to turn for a typical\r\nexample of the mental physician. Erasistratos, about 300 B. C,\r\nrecognized the valves of the heart, gave them the names tricuspid and\r\nsigmoid, and, like his great colleague, studied particularly the\r\nnervous system. He seems to have distinguished the nerves of motion\r\nfrom those of sensation, recognized their different functions and the\r\ndifferent directions in which they carried impulses, and thought the\r\nbrain the most important organ in the body.\r\n\r\nThe story is told that he was summoned in consultation to see the son\r\nof Seleukos, surnamed Nikator, the Macedonian general of Alexander the\r\nGreat, who became ruler of Babylonia. The illness of this son,\r\nAntiochos, had baffled the skill of the court physicians. While\r\nErasistratos was feeling his patient's pulse, the stepmother of the\r\nyoung prince entered the room. She, the second wife of his father, was\r\nyoung and handsome, and Erasistratos noted that there was great\r\nperturbation of the pulse as soon as the stepmother came in. He\r\ncorrectly surmised that the young man was in love with the lady and\r\nthat his illness had been occasioned by the feeling that his love was\r\nhopeless. The very sharing of his secret seems to have started the\r\nyoung man's cure, and Erasistratos' wisdom and medical skill became a\r\nproverb throughout the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AT ROME\r\n\r\nGalen.--Galen, whom we are prone to think of as a Latin because so\r\nmuch of his work was done at Rome, but whose works have come to us in\r\nGreek, and who was a disciple of the Greek school of medicine, brought\r\nup under Greek influence in his native town of Pergamos, re-echoed\r\nHippocrates' expressions as to the necessity for securing the\r\npatient's confidence and setting his mind at ease. The story in the\r\n\"Arabian Nights\" of his experience with the quack, which is known to\r\nmost people, shows clearly how the place of mental influence in the\r\nrelief of human ills must have been brought home to him. For nearly\r\nfifteen centuries his works continued to be the most read of medical\r\ndocuments. Nine tenths of all the physicians of education and\r\ninfluence, confidently looking to him as their master, kept copies of\r\nhis works constantly near them, and turned to them for medical\r\nguidance as they would to the Bible for spiritual aid.\r\n\r\nThe book of Galen which is usually placed first among his collected\r\nworks shows how much more important is the mind than the body for\r\nhuman happiness, and insists on mental interests as making life worth\r\nwhile. In it he describes the good physician, and says that to be a\r\ngood physician a man must also be a good philosopher. When he comes to\r\ntalk of the different sects in medicine--for even in his time there\r\nwere groups of men who founded their medical practice on very\r\ndifferent principles--he points out that the members of the different\r\nmedical sects, while all employing practically the same remedies, do\r\nso on quite different principles, and yet get about the same {13}\r\nresults. This concept comes as near to being a conscious reflection as\r\nto the place that the patient's mental reaction had in therapeutics as\r\nmight well be expected at that early date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles.--After Galen, medicine suffered an eclipse\r\nbecause the Romans became too devoted to luxury to permit of its\r\ndevelopment, and later the descent of the barbarians from the North\r\ndisturbed silence and culture. In spite of the disturbance, however,\r\nthere is evidence during the succeeding centuries of the deliberate\r\nuse of mental influence and even of direct suggestion in the cure of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles (sixth century A. D.) was not judiciously\r\ncritical in his selection of remedies. Often he has quite ridiculous\r\ntherapeutic suggestions, and yet we have at least two stories with\r\nregard to him which clearly indicate his employment of mental\r\ninfluence. One of his patients is said to have been suffering from the\r\ndelusion that his head had been cut off by order of the tyrant, but he\r\nwas cured as soon as the doctor hit on the interesting expedient of\r\nmaking him wear a leaden hat, which eradicated his delusion and made\r\nhim think his head had been restored.\r\n\r\nIt is also in Alexander Trallianus, as he is sometimes called, that we\r\nhave the original of the story which has been often told, many writers\r\ngiving it as an experience of their own. A woman was sure that she had\r\nswallowed a snake, and that it continued to exist in her stomach,\r\ndevouring much of her food and causing acute pain whenever large\r\nquantities of food were not provided for it. All sorts of remedies had\r\nbeen tried without result. At last Alexander gave her an emetic and\r\nthen slipped into the basin into which she was vomiting a snake\r\nresembling as closely as possible that which she thought she had\r\nswallowed. The ruse effected a complete cure. Usually in latter-day\r\nvariants of this story the cure is only temporary, for the patient\r\nafter a time has the same symptoms as before and then is sure that\r\nduring the time of its residence in the stomach the snake has given\r\nbirth to young.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul of AEgina.--In the seventh century Paul of AEgina collected all\r\nthat had been written on insanity by physicians of olden times, and\r\nmany of his directions and prescriptions for treatment show that he\r\nappreciated the value of mental influence. He recommends that those\r\nwho are suffering from mental disease should be placed in a quiet\r\ninstitution, should be given baths, and that an important portion of\r\nthe treatment should consist of mental recreations.\r\n\r\n\r\nARABIAN MENTAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\nThe Arabian physicians who succeeded to the traditions of Greek\r\nmedicine preserved also those relating to psychotherapy. Rhazes, the\r\nfirst of the great Arabian physicians, has a number of aphorisms that\r\nshow his interest in and recognition of the value of mental healing.\r\nHe insisted that \"doctors ought to console their patients even though\r\nthe signs of death are impending. For the bodies of men follow their\r\nspirits.\" He believed that the most important function of the\r\nphysician was \"to strengthen the natural vitality for, if you add to\r\nthat you will remove a great many ills, but if you lessen it by the\r\ndrugs which you employ you add to the patient's danger.\" \"Truth in\r\nmedicine,\" he said, \"is a goal which cannot be absolutely reached, and\r\nthe art of {14} healing, as it is described in books, is far beneath\r\nthe practical experience of a skillful, thoughtful physician.\"\r\nManifestly he realized the importance of the influence of the\r\nphysician over the individual patient.\r\n\r\nHis greatest successor among the Arab physicians, Avicenna (eleventh\r\ncentury), \"the Hippocrates and the Galen of the Arabians,\" as Whewell\r\ncalled him, has some striking tributes to what he recognized as the\r\ninfluence of the mind on the body. He appreciated that not only might\r\nthe mind heal or injure its own body, but that it might influence\r\nother bodies, through their minds, for weal or woe. He says: \"The\r\nimagination of man can act not only on his own body, but even on other\r\nand very distinct bodies. It can fascinate and modify them, make them\r\nill or restore them to health.\" In this, of course, he is yielding to\r\nthe dominant mystical belief that man can work harm to others, which\r\nsubsequently, under the name of witchcraft, came to occupy so\r\nprominent a place for ill in European history. But at the same time it\r\nis evident that his opinions are founded on his knowledge of the\r\ninfluence of mind on body, as he had seen its action in medicine. From\r\nhim we have the expression: \"At times the confidence of the patient in\r\nthe physician has more influence over the disease than the medicine\r\ngiven for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL MIND-HEALING\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages faith was one of the things most frequently\r\nappealed to, and even the physicians made use of religious belief to\r\nsecure a favorable attitude of the patient's mind toward the remedies.\r\nOne of the men who particularly realized the importance of this was\r\nMondeville, the great French surgeon.\r\n\r\nPagel has called attention to Mondeville's insistence on preparing the\r\npatient's mind properly for venesection. The patient should be made to\r\nfeel that this procedure was sure to do him good, and various reasons\r\nshould be given him why the removal of a certain amount of blood\r\ncarried with it poisons from the body, and so gave a better\r\nopportunity to nature to conquer the disease. If the patients were\r\nunfavorably disposed towards venesection, Mondeville thought that it\r\nshould not be performed, as it was not likely to do good. It was not\r\nthat he felt that the mental influence was the more important of the\r\ntwo therapeutic factors, but that a combination of the remedial force\r\nof blood-letting with a favorable state of the patient's mind meant so\r\nmuch more than could be accomplished by venesection alone that it was\r\nworth while to take pains to have the combination of the two. We in\r\nmodern times realize that in most cases blood-letting rather did\r\nphysical harm than good. It continued to hold a place in medicine\r\nbecause patients were so much impressed by it that they were given\r\nrenewed vigor after its use.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL HEALING IN THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nWhat is exemplified in medieval medicine in this matter remains true\r\nduring the Renaissance. In the fifteenth century Petrus Pomponatius,\r\nwell known as a thinker and writer on borderland subjects related to\r\nmedicine, came to the conclusion that men might very well be cured of\r\ncertain ailments {15} by influence from the minds of others, and that\r\nsuch treatment, undertaken by physicians appropriately endowed,\r\nproduced wonderful effects. He said:\r\n\r\n  Some men are specially endowed with eminently curative faculties;\r\n  the effects produced by their touch are wonderful: but even touch is\r\n  not always necessary; their glances, their mere intention of doing\r\n  good are efficient for the restoration of health. The results,\r\n  however, are due to natural causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AND MODERN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nParacelsus.--Paracelsus, the great physician of the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century, who may well be considered the father of modern\r\npharmaceutics, had no illusions with regard to the exclusive power of\r\ndrugs over disease. He recognized that mental influence was extremely\r\nimportant, and often lent a power not otherwise possessed to many\r\nremedies. He said:\r\n\r\n  Imagination and faith can cause and remove diseases. Confidence in\r\n  the virtue of amulets is the whole secret of their efficacy. It is\r\n  from faith that imagination draws its power. Anyone who believes in\r\n  the secret resources of Nature receives from Nature according to his\r\n  own faith; let the object of your faith be real or imaginary, you\r\n  will in an equal degree obtain the same results.\r\n\r\nPersonal magnetism, in the sense in which we now use it, a\r\ntransference of the idea from the science of magnetics as related to\r\nthe phenomena of the magnet, seems to have originated with Paracelsus.\r\nHe was sure that the influence exerted over certain patients by\r\ncertain physicians was due to a force very like that exerted by the\r\nmagnet over iron. He was even inclined to think that magnets\r\nthemselves might exert a strong potency over diseased conditions, and\r\nhe found them to be useful in epilepsy. Doubtless in many cases of\r\nsupposed epilepsy successfully treated the ailment was really of an\r\nhysterical nature. In these cases the strong suggestion which the use\r\nof the magnets gave for many centuries acted favorably.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgrippa.--The writings of Cornelius Agrippa, a contemporary of\r\nParacelsus, and, like him, a student of alchemy and of the secrets of\r\nnature, contain corresponding passages which serve to show how much of\r\ninterest there was in mental influence during the Renaissance. All of\r\nthese men were, of course, a little outside of the ordinary medical\r\ntradition, intent on getting to realities, not being satisfied either\r\nwith words or assumptions, refusing to accept many thing that the\r\nphysicians of their time completely credited. Agrippa in a\r\ncharacteristic passage said:\r\n\r\n  Our mind doth effect divers things by faith (which is a firm\r\n  adhesion, a fixed intention, and a vehement application of the\r\n  worker or receiver) in him that cooperates in anything, and gives\r\n  power to the work which we intend to do. So that there is made in\r\n  us, as it were, the image of the virtue to be received, and the\r\n  thing to be done in us, or by us. We must, therefore, in every work\r\n  and application of things, affect vehemently, imagine, hope and\r\n  believe strongly, for that will be a great help.\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Helmont.--At the end of the sixteenth century Van Helmont, who\r\ncarried on the work in pharmaceutics begun by Paracelsus, and to whom\r\nwe owe the discovery of a number of substances commonly used, as well\r\nas the invention of the word \"gas,\" was a thorough believer in the\r\ninfluence of mind over body and, indeed, in the existence in human\r\nbeings of storehouses {16} of latent energy ordinarily unemployed, but\r\nthat might under special circumstances be tapped to produce wonderful\r\neffects. Indeed, some passages remind us of Prof. James' expressions\r\nin his discussion of the law of human energy. Van Helmont said:\r\n\r\n  All magical power lies dormant in man, and requires to be excited.\r\n  (Compare Prof. James's \"Law of Mental Energy\" in the chapter on\r\n  Mental Influence). This (need for excitation) is particularly the\r\n  case if the subject upon whom we wish to operate is not in the\r\n  most favorable disposition; if his internal imagination does not\r\n  abandon itself entirely to the impression we wish to make upon him;\r\n  or if he towards whom the action is directed possesses more energy\r\n  than he who operates. But when the patient is well disposed or\r\n  weak, he readily yields to the magnetic influence of him who\r\n  operates upon him through the medium of his imagination. In order to\r\n  operate powerfully, it is necessary to employ some medium; but this\r\n  medium is nothing unless accompanied by internal action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSydenham.--In the more modern period the deliberate use of the\r\ninfluence of the mind on the body is quite as clear. Undoubtedly the\r\ngreatest of modern physicians, who well deserves the name of the\r\nEnglish Hippocrates, is Sydenham. How much Sydenham realized that many\r\nof his patients' ailments could only be cured by occupying their minds\r\nwith other things is seen in his writings. There is a characteristic\r\nstory told by Dr. Paris in his \"Pharmacologia\" which illustrates this\r\nwell and is a striking anticipation of what we are prone to think of\r\nas very modern views in these matters:\r\n\r\n  This great physician, Sydenham, having long attended a gentleman of\r\n  fortune with little or no advantage, frankly avowed his inability to\r\n  render him any further service, at the same time adding, that there\r\n  was a physician of the name of Robertson, at Inverness, who had\r\n  distinguished himself by the performance of many remarkable cures of\r\n  the same complaint as that under which his patient labored, and\r\n  expressing a conviction that, if he applied to him, he would come\r\n  back cured. This was too encouraging a proposal to be rejected; the\r\n  gentleman received from Sydenham a statement of his case, with the\r\n  necessary letter of introduction, and proceeded without delay to the\r\n  place in question. On arriving at Inverness, and anxiously inquiring\r\n  for the residence of Dr. Robertson, he found, to his utter dismay\r\n  and disappointment, that there was no physician of that name, nor\r\n  ever had been in the memory of any person there. The gentleman\r\n  returned, vowing eternal hostility to the peace of Sydenham, and on\r\n  his arrival, at home indignantly expressed his indignation at having\r\n  been sent on a journey of so many hundred miles for no purpose.\r\n  \"Well,\" replied Sydenham, \"are you better in health?\" \"Yes, I am now\r\n  quite well; but no thanks to you.\" \"No,\" says Sydenham, \"but you may\r\n  thank Dr. Robertson for curing you. I wished to send you on a\r\n  journey with some object of interest in view; I knew it would be of\r\n  service to you: in going, you had Dr. Robertson and his wonderful\r\n  cures in contemplation; and in returning, you were equally engaged\r\n  in thinking of scolding me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgagni.--In the century following Sydenham we have a number of\r\nexamples cited by Morgagni, the father of pathology, in which his\r\nrecognition of the value of the mind as a curative agent and of the\r\nharm that may be done by over-occupation of the mind is set forth at\r\nits proper value. Benjamin Ward Richardson in his \"Disciples of\r\nAEsculapius\" [Footnote 2] tells of two incidents in which this phase\r\nof Morgagni's very practical application of knowledge to medical\r\npractice is exemplified:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: London, 1901]\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\n  In other examples, where the symptoms are due to mental oppression,\r\n  he pursued a course of treatment that was of soothing nature. A\r\n  distinguished professor of physic at Bologna happened to discover\r\n  that his pulse was intermittent, and being extremely anxious about\r\n  it was incessantly feeling his pulse, to discover that the evil was\r\n  daily increasing. Morgagni's advice to his patient was to take his\r\n  finger off his wrist and not to inquire too anxiously about his\r\n  condition. The advice was followed, and the result was a complete\r\n  removal of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n  It is a very singular truth that in describing the action of the\r\n  nervous system on the circulation Morgagni shows that he was\r\n  cognizant of the fact that the circulation may be disturbed by two\r\n  sets of nervous irritations, one inflicted through the\r\n  pneumogastrics, the other \"through those nerves which are\r\n  subservient to the arteries\"--the vaso-motor system which is readily\r\n  disturbed by the mind. In one patient he observed great\r\n  perturbations of the pulse in both wrists as the result of mental\r\n  anxiety. But a day or two later the pulse derangement was confined\r\n  to the left side altogether. The pulse of the right arm was quite\r\n  regular, while that of the left arm still showed the inequality.\r\n  When the mental distress was relieved, this pulse also became equal.\r\n\r\nMorgagni cites Sydenham's contemporary, Lancisi, the great Italian\r\nphysician, as recognizing the influence of the emotions on the heart.\r\nExamples of similar convictions as to mental influence in medicine are\r\nalso found in the works of Morgagni's great contemporaries, Boerhaave\r\nand Van Swieten, and the great physicians of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries were closely imitated in their recognition of the\r\nvalue of the influence of mind over body in medicine by their\r\nsuccessors in the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter.--Wise old John Hunter recognized the influence of the\r\nmind on the body very clearly. He said, for instance, \"There is not a\r\nnatural action in the body, whether voluntary or involuntary, that may\r\nnot be influenced by the peculiar state of mind at the time.\" He lays\r\nit down as a law that \"every part of the body sympathizes with the\r\nmind, for whatever affects the mind, the body is affected in\r\nproportion.\" He said further, \"as a state of the mind is capable of\r\nproducing a disease, another state of it may affect a cure.\" He called\r\nattention to the fact that the touch of a corpse produced wonderful\r\neffects upon the minds of patients. He said, \"Even tumors have yielded\r\nto the stroke of a dead man's hand.\" He observes that \"while we should\r\nnaturally expect that diseases connected with the nerves--and those in\r\nwhich their alteration is in the action of parts not in their\r\nstructure--would be most affected by the imagination, we find that\r\nthere are other diseases in which they appear to have little\r\nconnection that are much affected by the state of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman Mind Healing.--In his monograph on \"Psychotherapy in Its\r\nScientific Aspects\" [Footnote 3] Dr. Berthold Kern calls attention to\r\na forgotten book of the German physician Scheidemantel, published in\r\n1787. Its title was \"The Emotions as Remedies.\" It seems to be very\r\nrare since even our Surgeon General's Library has no copy of it. The\r\nauthor treated psychotherapy systematically. He insisted that man was\r\na unit in which body and soul mutually influenced each other.\r\nScheidemantel blamed the moralists for considering the soul\r\nexclusively and the physicians for thinking only of the body. He\r\nthought that this was a serious mistake for both sides and he seems to\r\nhave anticipated much of our recent discussion on the influence of the\r\nbody and {18} of things physical generally in what is called crime and\r\nvarious divagations from law. On the other hand, he thought that the\r\ninfluence of the mind on the body was one of the most important\r\nelements in therapeutics.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 3: \"Die Psychische Krankenbehandlung im Ihren\r\n  Wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen.\" Berlin 1910.]\r\n\r\nReil, after whom the Island of Reil is named, and who taught us much\r\nwith regard to brain anatomy, was also interested in the influence of\r\nmind on body. He was the professor of anatomy at Berlin in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century and had great influence over the\r\nmedical science of the time. He insisted on the recognition and\r\ndevelopment of psychotherapy and hoped to give it a place beside the\r\nmedical and surgical treatment of human ills. He did much to create a\r\ncurrent of thought in German medicine which culminated in Johann\r\nMueller's very definite expressions with regard to the power of the\r\nmind over the body.\r\n\r\nVery probably the most striking expression of the influence of mind\r\nupon body is in that wonderful old book, Johann Mueller's text-book of\r\nphysiology, issued in an English edition (London, 1842) under the\r\ntitle \"Elements of Physiology.\" The subject, a favorite study, is set\r\nforth very clearly, and evidently from personal knowledge. He\r\nrecognized that the mind might influence every organ and function of\r\nthe body. The influence of expectancy he emphasized particularly:\r\n\r\n  The influence of ideas upon the body gives rise to a very great\r\n  variety of phenomena which border on the marvelous. It may be stated\r\n  as a general fact that any state of the body, which is conceived to\r\n  be approaching and which is expected with perfect confidence and\r\n  certainty of its occurrence, will be very prone to ensue as the mere\r\n  result of that idea, if it do not lie without the bounds of\r\n  possibility. The case mentioned by Pictet, in his observations on\r\n  nitrous oxide, may be adduced as an illustration of such phenomena.\r\n  A young lady, Miss B., wished to inspire this intoxicating gas; but\r\n  in order to test the power of the imagination, common atmospheric\r\n  air was given to her, instead of the nitrous oxide. She had scarcely\r\n  taken two or three inspirations of it, when she fell into a state of\r\n  syncope, which she had never suffered previously; she soon\r\n  recovered. The influence of the ideas, when they are combined with a\r\n  state of emotion, generally extends in all directions, affecting the\r\n  senses, motions and secretions. But even simple ideas, unattended\r\n  with a disturbed state of the passions, produce most marked organic\r\n  effects in the body.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence of the mind over the body in the matter\r\nof fatigue Mueller is especially emphatic. He states just as clearly\r\ntwo generations ago the Law of Reserve Energy as James stated it in\r\nrecent years. Of course, Mueller was far beyond his time in everything,\r\nbut then men who really think always are, and even Mueller's accurate\r\nexpression only represents what had been in the minds of thinking men\r\nin many previous generations. He says:\r\n\r\n  The idea of our own strength gives added strength to our movements.\r\n  A person who is confident of effecting anything by muscular efforts,\r\n  will do it more easily than one not so confident in his own power.\r\n  The idea that a change is certainly about to take place in the\r\n  actions of the nervous system, may produce such a change in the\r\n  nervous energy, that exertions hitherto impossible become possible.\r\n  This is still more likely to be the case, if the individual is at\r\n  the time in a state of mental emotion.\r\n\r\nEven this necessarily fragmentary and rather disjointed sketch of the\r\nmain features of psychotherapeutics, as we see them recognized by the\r\ngreat {19} physicians of the past, serve to show that mental influence\r\nhas always been appreciated as an important element in the care of the\r\nindividual patient.\r\n\r\nThe times when special attention has been paid to psychotherapy have\r\ncertain special characteristics. Usually the periods have come just\r\nafter a signal advance in medicine made through devotion to physical\r\nscience. Great attention is given to the advances and for a time the\r\nindividual patient is forgotten in the hope that at last physical\r\nscience is going to solve the problems of the physical man. With the\r\ndisappointment that always follows there is a reversion of feeling and\r\nmen realize once more how important is the mental state of the\r\npatient, even in physical diseases. Then there comes an emphatic\r\nexpression of the value of psychotherapy. We are at present in the\r\nmidst of one of these periods, hence the widespread interest in the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUS PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\nThe great authorities in medicine, the men whose thought counted for\r\nmost in the development of not only the science but the art of\r\nmedicine, the men to whom we look back as having been great practicing\r\nphysicians, have always used this remedial measure deliberately and\r\nhave suggested to others that it should be so used. But the smaller\r\nminds have been satisfied to think that their drugs, their external\r\nremedies and applications, have been the sole sources of the benefit\r\nthat accrued to the patient. Such smaller men are prone to think that\r\nthey have specifics for disease, while the larger men hesitate and\r\nrecognize that coincidence plays a large role and that the suggestive\r\nfactors in therapeutics often deceive us as to the real efficacy of\r\ndrugs and remedies.\r\n\r\nAll physicians have at all times used, though often unconsciously, the\r\nsuggestive factor in therapeutics, and mental influence has had\r\neverywhere a large role in the treatment of disease. Only in recent\r\nyears have we come to appreciate how many diseases are self-limited.\r\nIn the treatment of these self-limited diseases all sorts of drugs and\r\ntherapeutic methods achieved a reputation. Some of them were looked\r\nupon by generations as specifics, though we know now that they are\r\nalmost, if not completely, useless so far as any direct influence upon\r\nthe disease is concerned. Indeed, at times they were, _per se_,\r\nharmful rather than beneficial, and the patient literally got well in\r\nspite of the treatment, though the repeated suggestion of betterment\r\noften more than overcame the ill effect and helped in recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES PLUS SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nProf. Richet, the head of the department of physiology, University of\r\nParis, quotes the expression of a French critic of medicine: \"Hurry up\r\nand take the new remedy while it still cures. After a time it will\r\nlose its power.\" The power that is lost as remedies grow familiar is\r\nthe suggestive element that accompanied them at the beginning. They\r\nwere announced with a flourish of trumpets as a discovery in\r\ntherapeutics, a number of cases treated with them {20} were much\r\nbenefited (because of the feeling that they must do good), and it was\r\nonly after a great many cases had been treated, many of them under\r\ncircumstances where patients knew nothing of the claims made for the\r\nremedies, and where physicians had little or no previous confidence in\r\nthem, that their true place in therapeutics was revealed. Every\r\nphysician of experience has seen the popularity of remedies wax and\r\nwane as a consequence of the attention called to them. We have new\r\ntherapeutic discoveries every week. Enthusiastic articles are written\r\nabout them, many of them in perfect good faith, and then after a time\r\nno more is heard of them, or they sink back into the long list of\r\ndubious remedies that may be tried when others have failed, but have\r\nno special claim upon us, in spite of the fact that some physicians\r\ncontinue to think them wonder-working.\r\n\r\n\"Time is short and art is long, the occasion is fleeting, experience\r\nfallacious and judgment difficult,\" as Hippocrates bemoaned 2400 years\r\nago, and conditions in medicine continue the same. With suggestions\r\nand coincidence ever at work, it is still practically impossible to\r\ndetermine the intrinsic value of any remedy until after a prolonged\r\ntrial. In the olden time it was still more difficult because there had\r\nbeen no such accumulation of experience as we have to guide us, and so\r\nit is not surprising to find striking examples of even great\r\nphysicians recommending remedies whose main therapeutic influence must\r\nhave been the element of suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalen's Theriac.--Perhaps the most striking instance of suggestive\r\ntherapeutics is Galen's famous _theriac_, various prescriptions for\r\nwhich have come down to us, some of them much more complex than\r\nothers, so Galen is probably not responsible for all its absurdities.\r\nThis remedy contained a host of ingredients, some of which neutralized\r\nothers, and all of which taken together could have had but little\r\neffect save by a strong suggestion to the patient that as he was\r\ntaking so many drugs he surely must be benefited.\r\n\r\n\r\nBernard's Theriac.--Almost in our own time another _theriac_ came\r\nprominently before the public. In his younger years Claude Bernard,\r\nthe French physiologist, worked in a little drug store in a country\r\nplace not far from the farm on which he was born. There he found that\r\nthe most called for remedy was a _theriac_. It was good for most of\r\nthe ills that flesh is heir to and was bought in quantities by the old\r\nwomen of the neighborhood, who administered it on every occasion. The\r\nremedy was made in large quantities, but the secret of its composition\r\nin this particular pharmacy was what interested Bernard. Whenever any\r\ncompound was for any reason spoiled in the drug store, the rule was,\r\n\"Put that aside for the _theriac_.\" This much sold remedy then\r\nconsisted of the most heterogeneous drugs. It was so diluted that it\r\ncould do no harm, though it had quite sufficient taste and odor to\r\nmake every one who took it realize that without doubt they were taking\r\na strong medicine.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the knowledge of the composition of this wonderful\r\nremedy on Claude Bernard was the best that could have been\r\nanticipated. He resolved to study the physiological effects of drugs\r\nso that they could be given scientifically, and not in the hit or miss\r\nfashion that made possible the success of the _theriac_.\r\n\r\nThe custom of Bernard's country drug store, however, was not different\r\nfrom that of most country drug stores of the time. Unconscious\r\npsychotherapeutics we may well call it, because the main therapeutic\r\nfactor was {21} suggestion, renewed as often as the mixture was taken,\r\nthat the patient ought to feel better, until finally whatever symptoms\r\nwere due to over-attention and to concentration of mind on feelings of\r\ndiscomfort were diverted. Just as soon as the inhibition exercised by\r\nthis over-attention ceased its hampering effect nature completed the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion in Colds.--Many remedies acquired a reputation for breaking\r\nup coughs and colds. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether any\r\none has ever aborted a cold, or any other infection, that had gained a\r\nhold on the patient. We now know that this common affliction is not\r\ndue to cold but to absorption of infectious material. Nansen spent two\r\nwinters near the North Pole without catching any cold, and his men\r\nwere as healthy as himself. He had been back in civilization scarcely\r\na week before he and his men were confined to bed with a grippy cold.\r\nIn the far north, and high on mountains where the temperature is low,\r\ncolds are not as common as they are in crowded cities and especially\r\namong those who are much in crowds. Cold weather only predisposes to\r\nthe infection, and after it has occurred it is sure to run its course.\r\nThat course may be longer or shorter. The cold is usually preceded by\r\nchilly feelings. Every one knows it is possible to have chilly\r\nfeelings that seem to portend a cold, yet be well the next day. If in\r\nthe meantime any remedy is taken, credit will be given to the remedy.\r\nWhen a cold was supposed to be merely a disturbance of circulation or\r\na congestion, one might expect to break it up. Now that we know that\r\nit is a microbic infection, and know further that microbic diseases\r\nare usually cured by a definite reaction on the part of the body, we\r\nare not so likely to think of breaking them up. There are still\r\nphysicians who think they can abort a threatened pneumonia or\r\nabbreviate typhoid fever, but they are not those who know most about\r\nthe science of medicine.\r\n\r\nWe have the story, then, of a series of remedies used with great\r\nconfidence in coughs and colds, some of them physically beneficial,\r\nmany of them, especially those containing opium, often physically\r\nharmful, yet taken with such confidence that undoubtedly the patient\r\nwas helped through his mind if not otherwise. What is thus true for\r\nthis class of diseases can also be said of other minor affections.\r\nMany internal remedies have been used for boils and styes and other\r\nexternal infections and have often had wide vogue. The reason for\r\ntheir acceptance as remedies has been that the giving of anything\r\nproduces a more hopeful attitude in the mind of the patient and this,\r\nby bettering the general health, sometimes overcomes the tendency that\r\nmay exist to a repetition of such infectious processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nErysipelas.--The medical history of erysipelas is just a succession of\r\nremedies recommended, each claimed to be almost infallible, yet\r\nabandoned after a time for another for which like exaggerated claims\r\nwere made. The doctrine of signatures played a large role in the\r\ntreatment of erysipelas, and, strange as it may seem, still survives.\r\nAccording to the doctrine of signatures, erysipelas, being a disease\r\ninvolving intense redness of the skin, red things in nature would be\r\nlikely to do it good. Red pepper, for instance, was suggested for it\r\nover and over again, both internally and externally. Various red\r\nremedies have been favorites at different times in history. At\r\npresent, in many country places, a poultice made of cranberries is\r\nsupposed to be most efficacious. For many years I lived in a small\r\ntown where one of the grocers {22} put in a large stock of cranberries\r\neach fall, though the people of the neighborhood used them but little\r\non the table, because during the winter there were many calls for them\r\nfor the making of poultices for erysipelas. People who have had\r\nerysipelas, especially if it has occurred on unexposed portions of the\r\nbody, are supposed to be protected against its recurrence--for there\r\nis a distinct liability to its recurrence--by the wearing of red\r\nflannels!\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any drug that has not at some time been recommended\r\nas almost a specific for erysipelas. Anything that was given on the\r\nthird or fourth day, and it was only at this time as a rule that\r\npatients came to physicians to be treated, seemed to bring about the\r\nalleviation of symptoms that occurred on the fifth or sixth day.\r\n\r\nErysipelas, because of the sudden irruption of fever which accompanies\r\nit, the intense redness which characterizes it, and the discomfort\r\nwhich is often present, is an affection that disturbs patients very\r\nmuch. For them, then, the presence of the physician and his assurance\r\nthat their affection is not likely to be severe, and his prompt relief\r\nof certain conditions, all act by suggestion on the patient's mind and\r\nstrengthen the natural curative reaction.\r\n\r\nIn country places where physicians were not near, erysipelas was one\r\nof the affections that continued almost down to our own day to be\r\ntreated by incantations. I have known in a little American country\r\ntown of a woman making a \"charm,\" as it was called, for erysipelas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPneumonia.--Pneumonia is another of these sharply self-limited\r\ndiseases that give opportunity to many remedies for the acquisition of\r\na reputation as cures. Croupous pneumonia is so disturbing in its\r\nonset, so rapid in its progress, yet so strictly self-limited in the\r\npreviously strong and healthy, that in the old days there were many\r\nremedies that were supposed to bring about the crisis. The old\r\ntext-books contain so many cures that it is surprising pneumonia\r\nshould have continued to be the fatal disease it has been at all\r\ntimes. Almost any remedy that is used for three or four days in\r\npneumonia will be followed by the crisis with, in most cases, a\r\nfavorable termination. The crisis takes place some time from the\r\nseventh to the tenth or eleventh day, and often we do not see a\r\npneumonia patient until the second or third day of the disease. Just\r\nbefore the crisis the patient runs into a series of acute and more or\r\nless alarming symptoms. Often there is much restlessness, difficulty\r\nof breathing with complaint of heaviness, and perhaps prostration. The\r\npulse and temperature are high, the skin hot and dry. Then in the\r\nmidst of this the patient sleeps, there is a critical sweat, the\r\ntemperature drops, the patient wakes up feeling quite well, there is\r\nlittle difficulty in breathing, and he feels that recovery is sure to\r\ncome. The change is so great that it is natural that it should have\r\nbeen attributed to all sorts of remedies which had been used\r\nimmediately preceding the crisis.\r\n\r\nI once heard an old physician declare at a meeting of a large and\r\nimportant medical society that calomel in divided doses was\r\npractically a specific for pneumonia. He said he waited forty-eight\r\nhours to be sure that the affection was pneumonia, and also that it\r\nhad reached that diffusion in the lungs beyond which it was not likely\r\nto go, then he gave the calomel. He said that, almost as a rule,\r\nduring the next forty-eight hours the crisis came--and he attributed\r\nit to the calomel. We have had other remedies just as curious as this\r\nrecommended and taken quite seriously. Some years ago a {23} Russian\r\nphysician, who had been treating soldiers in the Russian army for the\r\npneumonia which occurs so commonly after exposure on the Steppes,\r\nannounced that he had found in digitalis almost a specific. He pushed\r\nthe tincture up to twenty drops three times a day, beginning it just\r\nas soon as the pneumonia was detected, and the rate of mortality among\r\nhis patients was about one per cent. According to his theory, it was\r\nthe failure of the heart in pneumonia that made the disease fatal.\r\n\r\nApparently the character of the patients in whom his pneumonias\r\noccurred was forgotten. They were absolutely the most favorable cases\r\nthat could be selected. Most of them were young men between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five. At this age no one who is given a reasonable amount of\r\nfresh air should die of pneumonia. If the patient had a serious heart\r\nlesion, or a crippled kidney from nephritis after scarlet fever, or\r\ncrippled lungs because of a previous attack of tuberculosis, then the\r\npneumonia might be fatal--indeed, almost inevitably would be, or, in\r\nthe last-mentioned case, would end by lysis and not crisis. It really\r\nmatters little what remedy is given to young, otherwise healthy,\r\nadults; they will get better, barring serious complications. The use\r\nof digitalis lessened the chances of recovery by stimulating too early\r\nin the case the heart that later had to bear one of the most serious\r\nstrains that the organ can stand. But doubtless this harm was more\r\nthan overcome by the patient's knowledge that he was taking a new and\r\npowerful remedy, supposed to be particularly calculated to cure him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the special interest of the physician in these cases, and\r\nhis administration of a remedy with confidence which inspired the\r\npatient, undoubtedly did much good. Pneumonia is one of those diseases\r\nin which the patient is likely to be greatly depressed unless he is\r\nsurrounded by favorable mental influences, and is encouraged to\r\nbelieve that he is going to get well. Every physician has probably had\r\ncases in which patients died, not because of the severity of the\r\ndisease, but because they gave up the struggle in fright. If several\r\nof a man's friends have died of pneumonia during the year or two\r\nbefore he gets it, he is likely to conclude, especially if he is of\r\nthe worrying kind, that his doom is sealed as soon as the diagnosis of\r\npneumonia is made. If this thought persists hardly anything will save\r\nhim. He must be assured that pneumonia is not necessarily serious,\r\nthat there are remedies that influence it, and that his own case is\r\nparticularly likely to respond favorably to them.\r\n\r\nWe now realize that nursing is the most important element in the\r\ntreatment of pneumonia. Such attention to the patient as will treat\r\nsymptoms so as to prevent them from disturbing him, will secure him\r\nagainst discouragement, will arouse his resistive vitality by assuring\r\nhim of a favorable termination. This will above all prevent the\r\npatient from feeling that he is attacked by a fatal disease. The\r\npresence of the doctor and his general directions make the patient\r\nrealize how thoroughly the course of the disease is understood and\r\ntherefore how likely it is that a favorable termination will be\r\nbrought about. We know how much the mind may interfere with the\r\nbreathing if allowed to dwell on it, and therefore if the patient\r\nbecomes over-solicitous about the condition of his lungs he seriously\r\nhampers his recovery. In pneumonia the physician has always brought\r\nrelief, and he has usually attributed his success to his drugs, though\r\nhe has felt, too, that the confidence inspired {24} by him meant much\r\nfor his patient. It would have been better had he exaggerated the\r\nmental influence rather than the drug power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphoid Fever.--Typhoid fever is another affection for which we have\r\nmany therapeutic suggestions, with wide vogue, that are nevertheless\r\nalmost directly opposed to what we know about the pathology and\r\netiology of the disease. Typhoid fever runs its course in from between\r\ntwenty to thirty days. The majority of people who take the affection\r\nand who give in to it early enough, so as not to wear themselves out,\r\ncome through successfully. Complications may carry them off, but we\r\nexpect uncomplicated cases to recover. The longer course of typhoid\r\nhas made the action of drugs appear less striking than in pneumonia\r\nand erysipelas, but a number of remedies have been proclaimed to\r\nshorten its course, to make it less dangerous, to cure, and sometimes\r\nactually to abort it. So often have these come and gone that the\r\nphysician who knows the history of therapeutics is likely to be\r\nsuspicious of them. Even at present there are certain remedies\r\nsupposed to have this effect, but one does not find them used in\r\nhospitals where large numbers of cases are seen and where there are\r\nopportunities for comparative observation. They are used only by\r\nphysicians who see a few cases every year, and to whom coincidences\r\nmay mean much more than they are likely to when extensive statistics\r\nof the disease are made.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these remedies are founded on some real or supposed\r\nscientific principle. The antiseptic treatment of typhoid, for\r\ninstance, was based on the supposition that if one can kill the\r\nmicrobes in the intestine the disease will run a shorter course. The\r\nprinciple apparently fails to note that any remedy likely to kill\r\nmicrobes is still more likely to kill cells of other kinds, and above\r\nall human cells lessened in their resistive vitality by disease. The\r\nadvocates of this remedy also forget that typhoid is now recognized as\r\na general disease with only a local manifestation in the intestines,\r\nand that the treatment of this local manifestation is no more likely\r\nto affect the course of the disease than the treatment of the symptoms\r\nof typhoid would be likely to do. But the giving of remedies with the\r\nthoroughgoing confidence that awakens trust is in itself an excellent\r\ntherapeutic agent, and patients thus treated are sure to be benefited\r\nin so far as they share the physician's confidence. Just the same\r\neffect, however, can be produced by careful nursing and by making the\r\npatient realize that even though typhoid fever runs a definite course,\r\nwhich we cannot abbreviate nor probably influence, we can by nursing\r\nso prevent complications as to make a fatal termination almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhooping Cough.--Perhaps none of the common affections illustrate the\r\ninfluence of psychotherapy better than it is exemplified in the\r\nhistory of the therapeutics of whooping cough. We have had all sorts\r\nof remedies suggested for it, and most of them have been introduced by\r\nthose who had found them of great service in shortening the course of\r\nthe disease, and in making the \"whoop\" disappear much sooner than\r\nwould otherwise be the case. There have been internal and external\r\nremedies, inhalations and inunctions, as well as many less likely\r\nmethods of treatment. Practically none has maintained itself. Whooping\r\ncough is likely to run a rather long course. We know now that as a\r\nconsequence of the strain upon the lungs tuberculosis not infrequently\r\ndevelops. Whenever this is true the tendency to cough is likely to be\r\n{25} prolonged far beyond the natural period, and from habit ingrained\r\nupon the nervous system the \"whoop\" is likely to continue, though\r\nthere is no necessity for it. It is this secondary period of the\r\naffection that the remedies have succeeded in shortening either\r\napparently or in fact.\r\n\r\nPractically anything that is done for children is likely to instil the\r\npersuasion that the \"whoop\" should disappear. Anything impressive will\r\narouse this favorable attitude of mind toward the affection, and hence\r\nthe remedies have obtained a reputation. In the interior of many\r\ncountries draughts of sea water are a popular remedy for whooping\r\ncough. Sea water, it is said, loses its efficacy if carried long\r\ndistances from the shore, so the children must be brought to the\r\nseaside. In mining regions children are taken down into the mines. The\r\nexperience is enough of itself, especially when talked over a good\r\ndeal in the family, and when the occasion is often the first outing\r\nthat the child has had for months, to bring with it such improvement\r\nin health as will enable it to suppress the whoop. If the exposure to\r\nthe mine air does not bring improvement, it is said to be either\r\nbecause the child was not taken deep enough, or because there was no\r\ngas in the air, or the wrong sort of mine was chosen, or some other\r\nplausible excuse is advanced.\r\n\r\nThe development of scientific medicine, or at least what we are\r\npleased to think of as more scientific therapeutics than they had in\r\nthe past, has not kept us from having many and varied remedies for\r\nwhooping cough, which, after being introduced on apparently good\r\nauthority and apparently accomplishing many good results, have\r\neventually been allowed to drop into innocuous desuetude. Whenever the\r\nadministration of any such remedy was accompanied by strong\r\nsuggestion--when the internal remedies were particularly distasteful,\r\nor the inhalations rather trying or at least sure to attract the\r\nattention of the sufferers--then good results followed. But the cures\r\nwere due to the mental influences at work. In recent years various\r\nserums, including diphtheria serum, have been tried with reported good\r\nresults. The giving of the injection is one of those little operations\r\nthat is likely to impress itself forcibly upon the child's mind, and\r\nwhen given in connection with the promise, implied or explicit, of\r\nimprovement it is easy to understand that there will be a tendency to\r\nlessening the frequency of the whoop, at least during the secondary\r\nperiods of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGENUINE REMEDIES AND SUGGESTIVE EXAGGERATION\r\n\r\nThe story of the suggestive use of drugs shows us many suggestions\r\nemployed even by distinguished physicians, men whose work is eminently\r\nrational and has lived long after their time. In fact, very few, even\r\nof the most distinguished physicians, have failed to extol remedies\r\nwhich later proved to be quite ineffectual. Hippocrates felt quite\r\nsure that an external application of snake skin was a cure for all\r\nforms of that chronic skin manifestation, lichen. Pythagoras declared\r\nthat anise seed held in the hand was an excellent remedy for epilepsy.\r\nThese are only examples which serve to show how much suggestion has\r\nbeen used unconsciously by the medical profession. The sensation {26}\r\nproduced by the touch of the viper's skin was sufficient in some\r\npatients to bring about a change in the circulation in the skin, or\r\nperhaps a distinct modification of the nerve impulses on which trophic\r\nconditions in the skin depend, and this may have produced some cures\r\non which Hippocrates founded his recommendation. We know that the skin\r\ncan be unfavorably affected directly through the nervous system, and\r\nthere is no good reason for thinking that it may not also be affected\r\nfavorably. In our own day we have seen the suggestive influence of an\r\noperation act as a remedy in epilepsy and have lauded it for a time.\r\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that Pythagoras saw, as he thought,\r\nthe strong scent of the anise seed act favorably. Both of these\r\nconclusions as to the causative agency at work were wrong, because it\r\nwas suggestion and not the operation in most cases, nor the anise in\r\nany case, which caused the improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC PERSUASION\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the distant past, however, but also in quite modern\r\ntimes that these therapeutic persuasions have existed among\r\nphysicians, and as a result physicians have frequently recommended and\r\nemployed remedies that we now know not only to have been quite\r\nuseless, but sometimes even harmful. A typical example of this is the\r\nuse of antimony, originally discovered and studied by Basil Valentine,\r\nan alchemist who had busied himself much with the nature of\r\nsubstances, vegetable and mineral, and with their action as remedies\r\nfor disease. Sir Michael Foster hailed him as the first of\r\npharmacologists, and said: \"The old monk did not care for the problem\r\nof the body; all he sought to understand was how the constituents of\r\nthe soil and of plants might be treated so as to be available for\r\nhealing the sick and how they produced their effect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion and Antimony.--This was an eminently scientific research.\r\nIt brought the father of pharmacology to certain supposed discoveries\r\nwhich continued to occupy men's minds for centuries, yet ultimately\r\nproved to be utter misunderstandings of drug action, because\r\nsuggestion played so large a role that it vitiated all the\r\nconclusions. The best known of Basil Valentine's books is the\r\n\"Triumphal Chariot of Antimony,\" which contains many interesting\r\nscientific observations that were probably new at the time and which\r\nshow their author's investigating spirit and his interest in\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his scientific advances, however, Valentine was wholly\r\nmistaken with regard to antimony. He used it in various diseases, and,\r\nof course, it always produced very definite effects on the bowels.\r\nThese effects the physician could easily foretell. It was for the\r\npatient a proof that the physician knew much, both about his disease\r\nand his remedies, since he could prophesy the results. After the\r\nantimony had exerted its influence the patient was much more ready to\r\nthink that he must get better, and the influence of this suggestion\r\nworked strongly in all cases where the affection was not serious, and\r\nundoubtedly helped the patient's resistive vitality to throw off\r\ndisease. In weak patients its physical effect was lamentable. It still\r\nfurther reduced vitality, and when used by thoughtless physicians must\r\nhave done great harm. In spite of this, however, antimony continued to\r\nbe used for centuries. Shortly {27} after the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, when it was beginning to be neglected, antimony\r\nreceived a new lease of life as a consequence of its employment in a\r\nlingering illness of Louis XIV. The French king was attacked by what\r\nhas since been recognized as typhoid fever. Many remedies were tried,\r\nbut all in vain; the fever continued. When the fever had nearly run\r\nits course and the physicians were on the point of acknowledging that\r\nthey could do nothing, and when a fatal termination seemed near, it\r\nwas decided at a consultation to follow the advice of an old\r\npractitioner and use the old-fashioned remedy, antimony. Almost\r\nimmediately the king began to get better. His improvement was quite\r\nnaturally attributed to the last drug that he had taken, and antimony\r\nregained and held its remedial reputation for the next two centuries.\r\n\r\nSuch stories have always worked wonders in producing popular faith and\r\neven professional confidence in drugs. When great personages seem to\r\nbe cured by certain remedies, ordinary logic ceases to act, and the\r\nstrong power of suggestion comes in to strengthen whatever remedial\r\ninfluence there may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalomel and Suggestion.--Such mistaken notions as to therapeutic\r\nefficiency are not confined to centuries before our own. During much\r\nof the nineteenth century calomel was employed as extensively as\r\nantimony had been in preceding centuries. Calomel was often given in\r\ndoses which produced effects resembling those of antimony. Even in the\r\nsmall doses we now employ, it is apt to be a thorough purgative. In\r\nthe twenty and forty grain doses, commonly administered by the country\r\ndoctors of two generations ago at the beginning of practically every\r\nailment, it was purgative--and worse. Its effects could, of course, be\r\nvery strikingly seen, and what patients wanted were just such visible\r\nresults of the doctor's prescription. Undoubtedly, then, the calomel\r\ndid good, but not by its effect upon the patients' bodies, but upon\r\ntheir minds. Calomel is still used in ways that partake more of the\r\nold-fashioned ideas than we care to confess. Some of its supposed\r\neffects in stimulating the flow of bile have been placed in doubt by\r\nmodern investigation, but we still use it empirically, and undoubtedly\r\nits effectiveness is partly due to the fact that many patients see the\r\nresults in the purgation in dark coloration of the stools and are\r\nconfident that improvement must follow--and it does. Perhaps at a\r\nsubsequent operation we find the bile ducts effectively blocked and\r\nthen learn for certain that the stool coloration observed was not\r\nbiliary but due to a chemical reaction of the calomel itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nVenesection and Its Suggestiveness.--Between the periods of antimony\r\nand calomel popularity venesection was the favorite remedy of\r\nphysicians. It is hard to understand now the extent to which this\r\npractice was carried by the medical profession. People were bled for\r\nnearly every combination of symptoms. In severe cases the amount of\r\nbleeding practiced was almost incredible. Mirabeau, the great French\r\norator, suffering from angina pectoris, was bled some eighty ounces in\r\nthe course of forty-eight hours. In spite of this heroic treatment,\r\nwhich his physicians thought ought to have cured him, he died. We find\r\nit hard to understand how he lived so long. This, of course, was an\r\nexceptional case at the very height of the venesection furor, but it\r\nhelps us to realize how convinced physicians were of the curative\r\npower of the practice.\r\n\r\n{28}\r\n\r\nThoughtful physicians like Morgagni did not accredit it, or at least\r\nrefused to allow it to be practiced on themselves, but its acceptance\r\nwas practically universal. Probably no remedial measure ever generally\r\nused was calculated to be so effective as bleeding in producing a\r\nstrong mental influence. The rather sacrificial preparations for it,\r\nthe sight and the prick of the lancet, then the sight of the blood,\r\nthe languor that followed, the reaction on nature's part to reproduce\r\nthe lost material, all united to impress the patient's mind so deeply\r\nthat it is easy to understand that all the reserve of mental force was\r\nnow directed toward helping nature in the cure of whatever disease was\r\npresent. Venesection itself in nine out of ten cases probably did more\r\nphysical harm than good, but all the good came from its suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe are now apt to think of venesection as consisting only in the\r\nremoval of some blood from a favorably situated vein, but we must not\r\nforget that in the olden time they bled from many veins, and that a\r\nparticular vein was picked out because it was supposed to be connected\r\nin some way with the seat of the special trouble under treatment, and\r\nas a result there was a particular appeal to mental influence. A vein\r\non the forehead was opened for the treatment of migraine and diseases\r\nof the eyes, on the nose in case of discharge from the eyes, back of\r\nthe ears in chronic headache and in stuporous conditions, or beneath\r\nthe chin when there was pain in the eyes, or in the nose, or in the\r\njaws. The cephalic vein was opened for headache and for certain\r\naffections of the eyes and ears. Altogether there were thirty\r\ndifferent veins opened for as many maladies. It was thought extremely\r\nimportant in the drawing of blood from the arm that that arm should be\r\nchosen which, for some anatomical or other reason, was supposed to be\r\nthe more intimately connected with the affected part of the trunk or\r\nhead. The psychotherapeutic factors at work in these cases are easy to\r\nunderstand, and their beneficial effects gave the practice a firm\r\nfoothold in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuinine and Suggestion.--Whenever any drug has secured a reputation\r\nits use has always been extended to many other diseases besides that\r\nfor which it was definitely indicated. Quinine is a typical example.\r\nIt is a specific for malaria and, properly administered in suitable\r\ndoses, breaks up the fever--not because of any action upon the febrile\r\ncondition itself, but because it kills the _Plasmodium malariae_ whose\r\nreproduction in the blood brings about the paroxysms of fever. It was\r\nargued, however, that since quinine was good for one kind of fever it\r\nwould probably be good in others, and all sorts of theories were\r\ninvented and supported by supposed observations of the effect of\r\nquinine on various organs and tissues, even on the white blood cells,\r\nby which its efficacy in fever was supposed to be explained. Quinine\r\nwas used in all sorts and conditions of fever, and acquired a\r\nreputation as a remedy that had the power even to abort conditions\r\nleading to all fevers. It was used in large doses for such conditions\r\nas cold, incipient pneumonia, or indeed any disease with a chill at\r\nthe beginning, and was supposed to be a powerful prophylactic.\r\n\r\nNow it is settled that while quinine in small doses is an excellent\r\ntonic, it has no effect at all upon fevers in themselves nor upon\r\nfever-producing conditions. Yet it is still administered by many who\r\nhave not quite abandoned the old teachings as if it were a general\r\nfebrifuge. In the meantime, the use of quinine as a prophylactic of\r\ncolds and other minor febrile conditions has {29} spread so that many\r\npeople make themselves very uncomfortable by taking a large dose of\r\nquinine and whiskey whenever they fear they are going to have a cold.\r\nAs a consequence they feel dull and heavy the next day, but assume\r\nthat they would have been much worse than they are had they not taken\r\nthe potent remedy the night before. Undoubtedly some of them are\r\nenabled by the suggestive value of the remedy and the continued\r\nsuggestion of its unpleasant effects to throw off the lassitude that\r\ncomes from some minor infection and are encouraged to get out into the\r\nair, when they might otherwise have stayed in the house. This enables\r\nthem to get rid of their colds sooner than would be the case if they\r\nallowed themselves to be confined. Most of them, however, are harmed\r\nrather than benefited, and the cold runs its course, unaffected except\r\nthat the patient is more miserable and depressed for the first day or\r\ntwo than he would otherwise have been. There are physicians who still\r\nuse quinine as a febrifuge in typhoid and other essential fevers, and\r\ndoubtless its bitter taste helps their patients because of the\r\nsuggestive value of an unpleasant medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. John Long's Liniment.--An interesting exemplification of the power\r\nof mystery in adding to the curative value of a commonplace remedy is\r\nfound in the story of the famous St. John Long liniment. St. John Long\r\nwas a well-known quack in London in the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Like all quacks at all times, his specialty was chronic\r\ndiseases. He claimed to be able by means of external applications to\r\ncure the pains and aches to which the old are so likely to be subject.\r\nSt. John soon acquired an immense reputation. He gave a liniment with\r\na secret formula that was literally a miracle worker. People who used\r\nit found after a few times that they were free from, or at least\r\ngreatly relieved of, aches that had bothered them for years. It was\r\ngood for sprains and for internal pains of all kinds, as well as for\r\nthe so-called chronic rheumatisms, which have as their principal\r\nsymptom pains and aches around joints. So great a reputation, indeed,\r\nwas acquired by the remedy that an agitation was begun to have\r\nParliament buy the secret from its inventor in order to present it to\r\nthe British nation. The proposition was actually carried through the\r\nlegislative chambers and a considerable amount of money, still larger\r\nin those days because of the comparatively greater value of money, was\r\nvoted to St. John Long.\r\n\r\nHis liniment had a place in the British Pharmacopeia under his name\r\nfor many years afterwards. It proved to be only a simple old-fashioned\r\nremedy, the basis of which was turpentine, and one of the principal\r\ningredients was the white of egg. Just as soon as the secret was known\r\nthe power of the remedy began to decline. So long as it remained\r\nmysterious and unknown, discovered by a man who supposedly had made a\r\nspecial study for many years of these conditions, and had finally\r\nworked out the external applications necessary for them, it\r\naccomplished wonders. Just as soon as it was known to be a combination\r\nof familiar turpentine and egg it lost its power. The remedy is, of\r\ncourse, an excellent counter-irritant, and the gentle rubbing\r\nundoubtedly did much good. The most important element, however, was\r\nthe mental influence, the feeling that now things must be better,\r\nwhich thought distracted attention from the aches and pains and caused\r\nthe unfavorable influence of over-concentration of mind on the part to\r\ncease, for the vaso-motor system is particularly under mental\r\ninfluence. Every now and then since that time some {30} liniment or\r\noil containing nearly the same ingredients as that of St. John Long's\r\nacquires a reputation as a consequence of a campaign of advertising.\r\nIt is the printers ink that counts, however, and just as soon as the\r\nadvertising ceases to attract attention the remedy fails in\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcohol Plus Suggestion.--Alcohol has been employed in medicine with\r\nthe persuasion that it is a remedy for many states of exhaustion,\r\nthough we have gradually gotten away from its use to a great extent,\r\nbecause we realize that subsequent physical ill consequences outweigh,\r\nin most cases, the physical good it may do. Its use was undoubtedly\r\ndue to the confidence of physicians communicated to patients, and the\r\nsense of good feeling which it gives and which proves a further strong\r\nsuggestion to the patient. This sense of well-being is illusory, for\r\nit is sure to be followed by a longer period of dejection, which more\r\nthan counteracts it unless the dose of alcohol can be maintained for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nA generation ago few physicians would have cared to treat exhausting\r\ndiseases, the continued fevers for instance, without liberal doses of\r\nalcohol. Practically the only treatment for pyemia and septicemia on\r\nwhich any stress was laid, and in which there was any general\r\nconfidence, was the administration of alcohol in large quantities. In\r\nthe septicemia consequent upon puerperal infection it was the common\r\nteaching to give alcohol by the tablespoonful or more every hour, or\r\noftener, until its effects began to be noticed, and ordinarily large\r\nquantities were required, so that sometimes nearly a quart was taken\r\nin the twenty-four hours. Undoubtedly these septic conditions were\r\naccompanied by great mental prostration, and this was emphasized by\r\nthe knowledge that they are often fatal. So patients were usually\r\ndepressed into a state of mind in which their resistive vitality was\r\nmuch lowered. Alcohol, then, by producing a sense of well-being as\r\nwell as by stimulating hope in other ways and suggesting possibilities\r\nof recovery, undoubtedly exerted a powerful and favorable influence on\r\nthe mind. Its use in these cases nearly always did good, in spite of\r\nits inevitable depressive reaction, for the course of these infections\r\nwas rapid and the dosage of alcohol could be maintained until there\r\nwas a change for the better or the fatal termination was in sight.\r\n\r\nAlcohol was frequently used in many other conditions of a similar\r\nnature, and above all in the septic conditions so common in hospitals\r\nbefore the days of antisepsis and asepsis. When it is recalled that\r\namputations yielded a mortality from sepsis of at least one in four,\r\nthe extensive use of alcohol in hospital practice two generations ago\r\nwill be readily understood. We have changed that, however, and Sir\r\nFrederick Treves, at a meeting of the British Medical Association at\r\nToronto, five years ago, called particular attention to the statistics\r\nof the use of alcohol in British hospitals. During the last forty\r\nyears milk and alcohol have exactly changed places in the London\r\nhospitals. Between 1860 and 1870 about four times as much was spent\r\nfor alcohol as for milk in these hospitals; during the last decade\r\nabout four times as much was spent for milk as for alcohol.\r\n\r\nA corresponding change has taken place in many other phases of\r\ntreatment in which alcohol was commonly used. The physician of fifty\r\nyears ago would have thought that one of his most efficient remedies\r\nhad been taken from him if he could not use alcohol freely in\r\ntuberculosis. There are practically no well-known specialists in\r\ntuberculosis now who recommend the use {31} of alcohol. On the\r\ncontrary, most of them point out the dangers from its use and consider\r\nthat the depression which follows even a moderate dose is likely to do\r\nmuch more harm than the temporary and fleeting stimulation which it\r\ngives can do good. In the treatment of phthisis in recent years milk\r\nhas done much more than take the place of alcohol: it has displaced it\r\nentirely. The medical profession realizes now that what the\r\nconsumptive needs is not more stimulation--for more of that than is\r\ngood for him is forced upon him by the toxins of the disease--but more\r\nnutrition to enable him to resist the progress of the disease and\r\nraise his resistive vitality against its toxemia. The one stimulant\r\nthat is of service in the affection is oxygen, and even that should be\r\ngiven in nature's dosage rather than by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alcohol in Pneumonia_.--A corresponding change has taken place in the\r\nprofessional attitude towards the use of alcohol in pneumonia. There\r\nwas a time not so very long ago when alcohol was considered the sheet\r\nanchor of our therapeutics for pneumonic conditions, especially those\r\nin which from the beginning a fatal termination seemed inevitable,\r\nbecause of the age of the patient or some complication. There were\r\nphysicians who said that if they had to choose between all the drugs\r\nof the pharmacopeia on the one hand without whiskey and whiskey\r\nwithout all drugs whatsoever, for the treatment of pneumonia, they\r\nwould make the latter choice. We are not as yet entirely away from the\r\npoint of view that attributes a certain value to alcohol in pneumonia,\r\nthough even those who still employ alcohol are less emphatic in their\r\nadvocacy of it. Any one who has seen the result of the fresh air for\r\npneumonia patients will think less and less of alcohol. One well-known\r\nclinical authority declares that the very best place to treat\r\npneumonia in our cities would be beneath the trees in the parks. Our\r\npatients are being treated at the ends of wards with the windows up,\r\non the balconies, and on the roofs, and the death rate is much reduced\r\nand the necessity for any other than oxygen stimulation seems much\r\nless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alcohol in Vague Affections_.--The suggestive influence of the effect\r\nof alcohol is unconsciously obtained in a number of vague and rather\r\nchronic affections. Among these the most noteworthy are women's\r\ndiseases. Various alcoholic home remedies, gin and whiskey, usually\r\ndisguised by some bitter, used to be popular. But the known presence\r\nof alcohol in these discredited them. Then the nostrum vendors\r\nproceeded to supply something just as good. They were, in fact, the\r\nsame things under another name. Many of the much-advertised remedies\r\nthat are supposed to cure the ills the weaker sex is liable to, have\r\nbeen found to be little more than dilute whiskey, for in alcoholic\r\nstrength they were about equal to whiskey diluted once with water, and\r\nthe other substances were added only to disguise the taste and the\r\nodor of this principal ingredient. Many of these remedies have\r\nelicited innumerable flattering testimonials and not all of these were\r\nfraudulent or obtained by questionable means, but many of them were\r\ngiven because of results secured through the remedies. The alcohol\r\ngave the well-known sense of well-being, and the suggestive influence\r\nof this increased the appetite, tempted the patient to move around\r\nmore, and to get more into the air than before, and the consequence\r\nwas an improvement in the general health, in the midst of which many\r\nsymptoms that seemed to the excited imaginations of run-down\r\nindividuals to be serious were relieved. In a great many cases,\r\nhowever, the result was the {32} formation of a whiskey habit; hence\r\nthe crusade which has discredited these remedies.\r\n\r\nOther patent medicines, and, indeed, some of the proprietary\r\npreparations, commonly recommended as nutrients and the like, and\r\nsupposed to be ethical, are found to owe whatever efficiency they have\r\nto their alcoholic content. Here once more the suggestive elements\r\nwere the more important, and enabled substances of little physical\r\nefficiency to produce effects that seemed to indicate the presence of\r\npowerful energizing materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whiskey in Snake-Bites_.--A typical example of a remedy which owes\r\nits efficacy to mental influence over the patient is the use of\r\nwhiskey for snake-bites. It is generally recognized that whiskey is\r\nnot only of no special beneficial effect for snake-bite, but that when\r\ntaken in the large quantities usual in such cases it probably produces\r\nan ill effect by disturbing the patient's general condition and\r\nlowering his resistive vitality. I have no doubt, however, that its\r\nuse in considerable quantities has in these cases proved of value\r\nbecause of the mental effect upon the patient. Ordinarily a snake-bite\r\nis followed by a sense of extreme terror and prostration that lowers\r\nthe resistive vitality. This is overcome by the temporary stimulation\r\nof the alcohol. The generally accepted idea that whiskey is almost a\r\nspecific remedy for snake-bite takes away from most people this dread\r\nand consequent depression, and does this especially at a time when the\r\nacuter symptoms of the venom are making themselves felt. Only about\r\none in six even of those bitten by large rattlesnakes are likely to\r\ndie. Many circumstances are in their favor. The bite is not likely to\r\nbe fatal unless the full contents of the poison sac is injected--which\r\nwill not be done if the sac has been emptied in the preceding\r\ntwenty-four hours--and if there are any obstacles, such as clothing or\r\neven hair, on the part struck by the snake. Most people, however,\r\nwould almost die from fright, and such a thing is quite possible, if\r\nthey thought there was no remedy. The fact that they understand that\r\nalcohol is an almost infallible remedy gives them courage, and as soon\r\nas they receive some whiskey and it begins to take effect this intense\r\ndepression is relieved.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if the knowledge we now have as to snake-bites were\r\nmore generally used, and if people understood that only rarely is such\r\nan accident fatal. In this way there would be no necessity for an\r\nappeal to mental influence through whiskey. It is probable, however,\r\nthat alcohol will still be used for many years, at least in the\r\ncountry districts, because the supposed knowledge is too widely\r\ndiffused for a correction to come soon, and then other modes of\r\ntreatment have not that persuasive mental influence which whiskey has\r\nas the result of the long tradition. There are many other popular\r\nremedies for snake-bite not quite so inefficient as whiskey, but that\r\nwill continue to enjoy a reputation and really have a certain\r\nefficacious result as a consequence of the expectant attitude evoked\r\nby the fact that for as long as the patient has heard anything about\r\nthese things this particular remedy has been mentioned always as the\r\none thing sure to do good.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Cures.--Fontana, toward the end of the eighteenth century, was\r\nsure that he had discovered in caustic potash an absolute specific for\r\nsnake poisoning. He had had a series of cases, and felt that he had\r\nactually observed this substance following the snake poison into the\r\nsystem and neutralizing it. Its active effect on the external tissues\r\nproved eminently suggestive for {33} the patient and good results\r\nfollowed. We have had many specifics since, and yet we are not quite\r\nsure how much any of them avail unless recent biological remedies\r\nprove lasting in their effects and are really of therapeutic\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntidotes and Suggestion.--For many other poisons beside snake venom\r\nthere have been announced supposed antidotes of all kinds. The\r\nliterature of the antidotes used for opium is extremely interesting\r\nand even in recent times contains many disillusions. Twenty years ago\r\nour medical journals contained any number of cases in which a solution\r\nof potassium permanganate seemed to have proved effective in\r\nneutralizing not only opium itself but its alkaloids and derivatives.\r\nNot only was it efficacious, then, if taken while the opium was still\r\nin the stomach but, just as with Fontana's caustic potash and the\r\nsnake venom, it followed the opium into the tissues and at least\r\nblunted its action. Numbers of cases were reported in which potassium\r\npermanganate was supposed to have had this desirable effect. The\r\neffect of alcohol in neutralizing carbolic acid attracted as much\r\nattention as did potassium permanganate for opium. Here there was no\r\ndoubt that alcohol immediately after the external application of\r\ncarbolic acid did prevent its corrosive action. It was supposed to do\r\nthe same thing in the stomach and even, as some enthusiastic observers\r\nthought, followed the carbolic acid into the tissues. Here once more\r\nthe claim is not proven and it is evident that the influence on\r\npatients' minds when small doses of carbolic acid were taken, was the\r\nreal therapeutic factor at work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultices in Suggestive Therapeutics.--Poultices represent another\r\nphase of the value of suggestion in medicine and surgery, though for\r\nmany centuries those who used them were sure that the reasons for\r\ntheir employment were entirely physical and not psychic. All sorts of\r\npoultices have been used and each was supposed to do specific curative\r\nwork. New forms of poultice material have been introduced, and\r\nphysicians and patients have been certain that each worked wonders of\r\nits own. The drawing power of the poultice was extolled until patients\r\ndwelt on the idea that this external application was literally engaged\r\nin extracting from them, even from distant portions of their anatomy,\r\nvirulent material that would do harm if allowed to remain in them.\r\nPoultices in suitable cases, because they represent moist heat, do\r\ngood by counter irritation, by bringing about the expulsion of gas, by\r\ndiverting internal hyperemia to external tissues, but most of their\r\nsupposed efficacy has been really due to the bother required to\r\nprepare and apply them, the discomfort of having them on, and the\r\nfeeling that now something had been done and the aches and pains must\r\nget better. They are still used, but to a much less degree than\r\nbefore. Now the ordinary teaching is that a hot water bag wrapped in\r\ndry flannel, if dry heat is the agent desired, and in moist flannel,\r\nif moist heat is the desideratum, is much more efficient. It takes but\r\na few minutes for a poultice, no matter how hot when applied--and\r\noccasionally in the olden time they were applied so warm as to burn or\r\nscald--to decrease in temperature to that of the body. After that they\r\nrepresent only a moist compress.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the suggestive influence of poultices\r\nmight serve for an age that knew less about the realities of the\r\nefficacy of external applications than ours. As a matter of fact, we\r\nhave, nevertheless, shown ourselves to be quite as credulous and ready\r\nto receive analogous remedies as the past generation. With the waning\r\nof the popularity of the poultice, not {34} only among the profession,\r\nbut also among the people generally, there came into use various\r\nplasters which were supposed to have even more wonderful efficacy than\r\nthe poultice of the olden time. These required a good deal of trouble\r\nto apply and once applied remained on for hours, and so continued to\r\nproduce a definite curative effect on patients' minds. When first\r\nintroduced, exaggerated claims were made for their therapeutic value\r\nand a regular crusade to diffuse correct information regarding them\r\nhad to be made, in order to set them in their proper place as mere wet\r\ncompresses, without any therapeutic efficiency beyond that of cloths\r\nwrung out in water and kept in touch with the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poultices and the Doctrine of Signatures_.--There was a general\r\nimpression in the past that the indication of the ailment for which\r\nsubstances are medically useful has been set on them by nature, either\r\nthrough the color, or the form of the plant, or other qualities. In\r\ngeneral, the law of similars is supposed to hold in the doctrine of\r\nsignatures--like cures like. Hence the cornmeal poultice for light\r\njaundice, the flax-seed meal poultice for darker jaundiced conditions\r\nand for tendencies to gangrene. The charcoal poultice was employed for\r\nthis same purpose with no better reason, though some of its efficacy\r\nmay have been due to oxygen present in the pores of the charcoal. I\r\nhave already spoken of the appeal to the patient's mind in the use of\r\nthe cranberry for erysipelas, and various other berries were used in\r\nlike manner on the doctrine of signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deterrent Materials and Suggestion_.--Another basic principle in the\r\nmaking of poultices was the use of deterrent, repulsive materials,\r\nbecause these were more effective on the patient's mind. All the\r\nordures were so employed. Goose and chicken excrement was supposed to\r\nbe particularly efficacious for many of the purposes for which we now\r\nuse iodine. It was applied over sprains and bruises on the unbroken\r\nskin. Cow-dung was employed as a poultice for sprains of the larger\r\njoints, especially on the feet and legs, but to be efficacious it had\r\nto be applied fresh. I have known, within twenty years, of physicians\r\nin two so supposedly cultured parts of the country as Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland, to employ such ordure poultices for the cure of sprains and\r\ndislocations, and these physicians had a great reputation among the\r\npeople of their countryside. They were known especially as good bone\r\ndoctors, and their use of such deterrent materials instead of\r\ndecreasing their practices rather added to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOintments.--In the Middle Ages ointments made of the most far-fetched\r\nmaterials were employed even by distinguished surgeons. That, indeed,\r\nis the one serious flaw in the surgery of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries, when they did everything else so well. These\r\nointments contained all manner of materials that were likely to\r\nimpress patients and make them feel that something wonderful was being\r\ndone for them. Crushed insects of all kinds were employed for external\r\nlesions. Here the doctrine of similars seems once more to have been in\r\nplay. Insects gave creepy feelings, and whenever such feelings, or the\r\nparesthesiae generally, were complained of, a poultice or ointment\r\nmade of insects seemed to be the natural remedy. The more repellent\r\nthe materials, the more efficient they were likely to be. Many of the\r\nparesthesiae are due to neurotic conditions and it is not surprising\r\nthat when an ointment of crushed lice--these insects being collected\r\nfrom barnyard {35} fowls or from hogs--was used, the suggestive\r\ninfluence was strong. Another important ingredient in ointments were\r\nportions of dead bodies. A bit of a mummy from the East was supposed\r\nto be particularly efficacious. Portions of the bodies of men who had\r\nbeen hanged, or of the moss that grew on the skulls of malefactors\r\nwhose bodies had been long exposed in chains to the air, were also\r\nfavorite ingredients. Plants and shrubs gathered in graveyards,\r\nespecially in the dark of the moon, because on account of the terror\r\nof the place they were then harder to get, also had a great\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES AND PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n_Similia similibus curantur_, like is cured by like, is a very old\r\nidea. According to the doctrine of signatures nature had put an\r\nexternal natural marking or a symbolical appearance or characteristic\r\nupon a plant, mineral or other object, to indicate its special\r\nusefulness for the treatment of certain diseases or for affections of\r\ncertain organs. Sir Robert Boyle, sometimes spoken of as the father of\r\nchemistry, said, \"Chymists observe in the book of nature that those\r\nsimples that wear the figure or resemblance, by them termed signature,\r\nof a distempered part, are medicinal for that part or that infirmity\r\nwhose signature they bear.\" On this principle yellow flowered plants\r\nwere good for jaundice, because they resembled it in color. The blood\r\nstone was good for hemorrhage, and plants of certain forms were good\r\nfor the organs or parts of man which they resembled. Certain plants\r\nwere named with this idea. Kidneywort, liverwort, are typical\r\nexamples. Scorpion grass, our familiar forget-me-not of the _genus\r\nmyosotis_, was so-called because its spike resembled a scorpion's tail\r\nand was, therefore, good against the scorpion's sting, or against\r\npains similar to that produced by such a sting. Some of the\r\nresemblances were extremely far-fetched, but in spite of the defect of\r\nnature's signature on them, they seem to have been effective in\r\ntherapeutics. The plant, sometimes called Jew's ear, which can by an\r\neffort of the imagination be made to bear resemblance to the human\r\near, was, for instance, supposed to be a successful cure for diseases\r\nof that organ.\r\n\r\nWe know now that there is no significance in this doctrine of\r\nsignatures. It represented one phase of pseudo-science. But the idea\r\nof itself was enough to help people to throw off many symptoms, to\r\nrelieve discouragement, to encourage them with the thought that they\r\nought to get better; accordingly they took new heart, ate better, went\r\nout more, and as a result naturally slept better, and then nature did\r\nthe rest. Signatures are an exquisite example of pure psychotherapy,\r\nas the initial agent and natural curative methods accomplishing the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignature Details.--Some of the details of the doctrine of signatures\r\nare amusing. For a considerable period nuts were supposed to be a good\r\nbrain food, and some traces of this idea are still extant, although\r\nthere does not seem to be any better reason for it than the fact that\r\nmany nuts have an arrangement of their lobes which resembles the\r\nconformation of the brain. On the same principle the Chinese use\r\nginseng-root as a general tonic. The extract is not {36} of any\r\nspecial significance in medicine, though it has come to be much\r\nadvertised in recent years, and the Chinese continue to pay high\r\nprices for it. The reason is that the root of the ginseng plant often\r\nresembles the human body. The more nearly this resemblance can be\r\ntraced, the more virtue there is for the Chinese in the particular\r\nspecimen of ginseng. The signature is on the roots. It is good for man\r\nbecause it looks like man, just as the nuts are good for the brain\r\nbecause they look like the brain. In modern times we are likely to\r\nthink that we are far away from any such self-deception. But our\r\ndeceptions have a more appealing pseudo scientific element in them.\r\nFish was for some time considered a good brain food because fish has\r\nphosphorus in it and so has the brain. The two reasons have as much\r\nconnection as that between nuts and the brain; or ginseng and man.\r\n\r\nAstrological ideas came in to help out ignorance and foster supposed\r\nknowledge. The sun and the stars were favorable planets and the moon\r\nunfavorable. If anything about a plant reminded the gatherer of the\r\nsun or the stars, then that plant was sure to be beneficial,\r\nespecially in chronic diseases. If anything reminded him of the moon,\r\nhowever, then it could be expected to be maleficent in influence.\r\nThough childish, this had yet its power to help.\r\n\r\nThe use of nitrate of silver, which in the old days was called lunar\r\ncaustic, because it had, in a fresh state, a silvery, moon-like sheen,\r\nwas largely a matter of signatures. The signature went both by\r\nsimilitude and by contrary. Since the lunar caustic supposedly had a\r\nmoon quantity, therefore it would be good for moon-struck people--the\r\nlunatics of the old time and of our own time. As a consequence nitrate\r\nof silver was used in many obscure nervous and mental diseases. In\r\nepilepsy it was commonly employed. Even in our own times, entirely on\r\nempiric grounds, it was used for such severe organic nervous diseases\r\nas locomotor ataxia and sometimes to such an extent as to produce\r\nargyria. Undoubtedly, its use, with confidence on the part of the\r\nphysician and suggestion and persuasion on the part of the patient,\r\ndid much to relieve sufferers from discouragement and from such\r\npsychic disturbance of their general health as would have made their\r\ncondition seem worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nWines as Remedies.--How much suggestibility means in the choice of\r\nremedies that of themselves are more or less indifferent, may be well\r\njudged from the recommendations with regard to various wines that have\r\nbeen made by physicians. At one time and place it is red wine, at\r\nanother it is white wine that is particularly effective. For certain\r\nnations the stronger wines, as Port or some of the Hungarian wines,\r\nhave appeared to exercise specific effects. Except for the tastiness\r\nof these various brands or for other trivial accessories, it is\r\nprobable that the therapeutic efficacy of the wine depends entirely on\r\nthe alcohol and the effect of this upon the patient. In his \"Memories\r\nof My Life,\" Francis Galton relates that Robert Frere, one of his\r\nfellow pupils with Prof. Partridge, who became through marriage in\r\nlater years a managing partner in a very old and eminent firm of wine\r\nmerchants, told him that the books of the firm for one hundred and\r\nfifty years showed that every class of wine had in its turn been\r\nfavored by the doctors.\r\n\r\nIn prescribing wine the doctrine of signatures probably had more to do\r\nwith the special choice than anything else. Red wines were recommended\r\nfor anemic people, because somehow the coloring was supposed to affect\r\nthe {37} patient in such a way as to make up for the lack of coloring\r\nin the blood. On the other hand, the light, and especially the\r\nstraw-colored wines, were recommended for liver troubles, because of\r\ntheir relation in color to the yellow of bile. Light wines were best\r\nfor people who had more color than normal. Some wines are much\r\nstronger than others, and the alcohol, as in so many of our patent\r\nmedicines, had a stimulating tonic effect, but in olden times this was\r\nsupposed to constitute only the smallest portion of the efficiency of\r\nthe wine, while the ingredients that made its color and taste were\r\nextremely important. The taking of red wine by anemic patients often\r\nproved suggestively valuable, and the alcoholic stimulation led them\r\nto eat more freely and look at things more hopefully and,\r\nconsequently, to improve in health more rapidly than would have been\r\nthe case had they not had the feeling that somehow they were actually\r\nconsuming elements that would make their blood red.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecious Stones.--The doctrine of signatures applied particularly to\r\nprecious stones, and many of the popular medical superstitions with\r\nregard to precious stones were founded on it. The blood stone was said\r\nto be efficient as a tonic: it stimulated people: it made the anemic\r\nstronger and ruddier if it were worn on the fingers. The torquise\r\nturned pale when its owner was in poor health. It was the stone that\r\nwas an index of what has been called \"the blues\" or what one modern\r\nwriter has dignified by the title \"splanchnic neurasthenia.\" Dr. Donne\r\nwrote of:\r\n\r\n  A compassionate turquoise that doth tell\r\n  By looking pale, the owner is not well.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the pallor of the patient's hands as the\r\nbackground to the stone made the difference in its appearance thus\r\nnoted. It became deeper in hue, as it were, when people were in ruddy\r\nhealth. The suggestive influence of such beliefs is easy to\r\nunderstand. It is even possible that the wearing of an amethyst did\r\nhelp to keep people from indulging in liquor to excess, for that is\r\nthe traditional effect of the wearing of this stone, though its virtue\r\nseems to be founded on nothing better than the supposed derivation of\r\nthe name from the Greek _a_ privative and _methuo_, \"I get drunk,\"\r\nsuggesting strongly to the wearer that he should not get drunk.\r\n\r\nThe jacinth superinduced sleep and doubtless the strong suggestion of\r\nthis supposed influence helped many sufferers from so-called insomnia\r\nto get sleep. The single fixed idea that now they must get to sleep\r\nwould greatly help them. Pillows in the olden time were occasionally\r\nset with bits of jacinth, and there is even the record of bed-linen\r\nembroidered with it. This would probably be quite as effective as are\r\nhop-pillows in the modern time, for their main influence, as is also\r\ntrue of pine pillows, seems to be through suggestion. Some other\r\ntraditions with regard to precious stones are harder to understand,\r\nyet may be explained. The owner of a diamond was supposed to be\r\ninvincible. Diamonds represented money and money meant power. It is\r\nharder to explain the tradition that the possession of an agate made a\r\nman able and eloquent.\r\n\r\nThe wide acceptance of the doctrine of signatures, and of allied\r\nideas, as to the effect of precious stones and metal and jewelry upon\r\ndisease, makes {38} it clear that the acceptance of a mental\r\npersuasion with the changes in habits that follow, may serve as the\r\nbasis of a successful system of therapeutics. The materials associated\r\nwith the idea had absolutely no more physical influence than does the\r\ncarrying of a horse chestnut or a potato in the pocket serve to keep\r\noff rheumatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPSEUDO-SCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALING\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of psychotherapy is found in the history of the\r\napplications of new scientific discoveries to medicine. The\r\ndevelopment of every physical science has been followed by an attempt\r\nto apply its new principles and discoveries to the treatment of\r\ndisease. Such applications have nearly always been followed by\r\nexcellent results at the beginning. But almost without exception, the\r\nmedical significance of these discoveries has, after a time, been\r\nfound to be _nil_. When these discoveries were made they became the\r\ncenter of public attention. The announcement of their application to\r\nmedicine then seemed natural and produced a feeling that another great\r\ntherapeutic principle had been discovered. Sometimes wonderful\r\ntherapeutic effects were noted. The chronic diseases particularly were\r\nhelped for some time, at least, and practically all the affections\r\nthat have mainly subjective symptoms were greatly relieved, or\r\nactually cured. After a time, however, when the novelty of the\r\ndiscovery wore off, its suggestive power was lessened and then the\r\nremedy lost its therapeutic power.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTROLOGY\r\n\r\nAstrology is the typical example of pseudo-science in medicine. The\r\nstars, and particularly the planets and the moon, were supposed to\r\nhave great influence on human destiny, human health, and human\r\nconstitutions. Astrology was an organized body of knowledge over 3,000\r\nyears ago. Mr. Campbell Thompson has recently translated a series of\r\n300 inscriptions from the cuneiform tablets in the British Museum, and\r\nProfessor Suedhoff of Leipzig has compiled all the references to\r\nmedicine in these. The latter's studies show the extent which star\r\ninfluence was supposed to have over human health. A halo round the\r\nmoon, an obscuration of the constellation of Cancer, the pallor of a\r\nplanet in opposition to the moon, the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter,\r\nand other movements and phenomena of heavenly bodies were supposed to\r\nforetell the approach of disease for man and beast.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this application of astrological knowledge to\r\nmedicine, operations were performed only on certain favorable days or\r\nunder favorable conjunctions of planets. An ailment that occurred at\r\nan unfavorable time, because of an unpropitious state of the heavens,\r\nwould not be relieved until the motions of the stars brought a more\r\nbenign conjunction. Observations seemed clearly to indicate that the\r\nstars actually had such influences. Even Hippocrates, though he\r\ninsisted that \"the medical art requires no basis of vain presumption,\r\nsuch as the existence of distant and doubtful factors, the {39}\r\ndiscussion of which, if it should be attempted, necessitates a\r\nhypothetic science of supra-terrestrial of subterrestrial belief,\"\r\ncould not entirely get away from astrology. In his treatise on \"Air,\r\nWater and Locality\" he writes: \"Attention must be paid to the rise of\r\nthe stars, especially to that of Sirus as well as the rise of\r\nArcturus, and after these to the setting of the Pleiades, for most\r\ndiseases in which crises occur develop during these periods.\" In the\r\nsecond chapter he writes: \"If anyone would be of the opinion that\r\nthese questions belong solely in the realm of astrology, he will soon\r\nchange his opinion as he learns that astrology is not of slight, but\r\nof very essential importance in medical art.\" (Personally I doubt the\r\nHippocratean authorship of these passages, but they are surely very\r\nold.)\r\n\r\nThe influence of the suggestions derived from astrology on human\r\npatients continued until almost the nineteenth century. There were\r\nmany protests, especially from the Doctors of the Church, that the\r\napplications of astrology to medicine were false, but the practice\r\ncontinued. Both Kepler and Galileo drew horoscopes for patrons, and\r\nwhile Kepler doubted their value, he felt that in making them he was\r\njustified by custom. Galileo drew up the horoscope of the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany during an illness, and declared that the stars foretold a\r\nlong life, but the Duke died two weeks later. But incidents of this\r\nkind did not disturb either popular faith or medical confidence in\r\nastrology as helpful, in prognosis, at least, if not also in\r\ndiagnosis. Even so late as 1766 Mesmer was graduated at the University\r\nof Vienna, when it was doing the best medical work in Europe, with a\r\nthesis on \"The Influence of the Stars on Human Constitutions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater Astrology.--Few now realize that the curious figure printed at\r\nthe beginning of most of our almanacs down to the present day is a\r\nrelic of the time when physicians believed in the influence of the\r\nconstellations over the various portions of the body. Even yet this\r\nidea has not entirely gone out of the popular mind, and hence its\r\nretention as something more than a symbol in our little weather books.\r\nMan was considered as a little world, a microcosm, and the universe,\r\nas men knew it--the sun, the moon and the planets\r\ntogether--constituted a macrocosm. It was observed that the bodies\r\nconstituting the universe were circumscribed in their movements and\r\nnever went out of a particular zone in the heavens which was called\r\nthe zodiac. This zodiac was divided into twelve equal parts called\r\nsigns or constellations. Similarly man's body was divided into twelve\r\nparts, of which each one was governed by a sign of the zodiac or by\r\nthe corresponding constellation. The ram governed the head; the bull\r\nthe neck; the twins the paired portions, shoulders, arms and hands;\r\nthe crab the chest; the lion the stomach, and so on. The old surgical\r\nrule, as quoted by Nicaise in his edition of Guy de Chauliac's \"Grande\r\nChururgie,\" was that the surgeon ought not make an incision, or even a\r\ncauterization, of a part of the body governed by a particular sign or\r\nconstellation on the day when the moon was in that particular portion\r\nof the heavens, for the moon was supposed to be the bringer of\r\nill-luck and to have untoward influences. The incision should not be\r\nmade at these unfavorable periods for fear of too great effusion of\r\nblood which might then ensue. Neither should an incision be made when\r\nthe sun was in the constellation governing a particular member,\r\nbecause of the danger and peril that might be occasioned thereby.\r\n\r\n{40}\r\n\r\nSuch rules were supposed to be founded on observation. Patients were\r\ninfluenced by them mainly because they were assured that the surgical\r\ntreatment was undertaken under the most favorable influence of the\r\nstars and that all unfavorable influences had been carefully observed\r\nand eliminated. It is hard for us to understand how such ideas could\r\nhave been maintained for so long in the minds of men whose other\r\nattainments clearly show how thorough they were in observing and how\r\nprofoundly intelligent in reaching conclusions. We should, however,\r\nhave very little censure for them, since from some other standpoint we\r\nfind every generation, down to and including our own, jumping at\r\nconclusions just as absurd and just as inconsequential. And the\r\npractice of astrology was not without its value, for the reassurance\r\ngiven patients by the consciousness that the stars were favorable did\r\nmuch to relieve their anxiety as to the consequences of surgery,\r\nlessened shocks, hastened convalescence, and favored recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\nWhat is thus exemplified in astronomy and astrology can be found in\r\nthe story of every other science. After the knowledge of the stars,\r\nthe next organized branch of information that might deserve the name\r\nof science related to plants. This, too, was introduced into medicine,\r\nand with more justification than astrology. Most of what was\r\naccomplished by early herbal medicine was, however, due to the\r\ninfluence produced on the mind rather than to any physical influence\r\ntending to correct pathological conditions. The shape and color of\r\nplants, their form, the appearance of their leaves, were all supposed\r\nto indicate medical applications for human ailments. The reason for\r\ntheir acceptance was entirely the ideas associated with the plants and\r\nnot any definite therapeutic effect. Whatever good nine-tenths of all\r\nthe herbal medication accomplished certainly was by means of the\r\ninfluence on the mind. We have abandoned the use of most herbal\r\nremedies in recent years, even many that are still retained in the\r\npharmacopeia, because we have realized their physical incapacity for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALCHEMY\r\n\r\nWhen chemistry, under the old name of alchemy, began to develop, its\r\nfirst study was of minerals, and just as soon as a body of knowledge\r\nwas acquired chemistry was applied to medicine. All the investigators\r\nwere engaged in searching for the philosopher's stone, the substance\r\nby means of which it was hoped to change base metals into precious. It\r\nwas generally believed that when this substance was found, it would\r\nhave wonderful applications to human diseases and would transmute\r\ndiseased tissues into healthy tissues in the same way that it\r\ntransformed metals. It was felt that the philosopher's stone would be\r\nan elixir of life as well as a master of secrets for wealth. This\r\nwould seem amusingly childish to us were it not for the fact that in\r\nradium we, too, seem to have discovered a philosopher's stone--a\r\nsubstance that transmutes elements. For some years after its discovery\r\n{41} we were inclined to think that it must have some wonderful\r\napplication in medicine and in surgery, and we actually secured many\r\ngood results until its suggestive value wore off.\r\n\r\nThe fact that much had been learned about chemicals persuaded men that\r\nthey must be beneficial to human beings. Thus they were taken with\r\nconfidence and produced good results. When our modern chemistry\r\ndeveloped out of alchemy a great variety of drugs began to be used,\r\nand long, complex, many-ingrediented prescriptions were written.\r\nPolypharmacy became such an abuse that the time was ripe for\r\nHahnemann, whose principles, if carried to their legitimate\r\nconclusions, would require his disciples to give practically nothing\r\nto patients and treat them entirely by suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\nWhen mathematics developed, applications of that science were made to\r\nphysiology and to medicine. Under the influence of Borelli, the school\r\nof Iatro-Mathematical medicine developed and it flourished long after\r\nhim. Foster, in his \"History of Physiology,\" says:\r\n\r\n  Borelli was so successful in his mechanical solutions of\r\n  physiological problems that many coming after him readily rushed to\r\n  the conclusion that all such problems could be solved by the same\r\n  methods. Some of his disciples proposed to explain all physiological\r\n  phenomena by mathematical formulas and hypotheses concerning forces\r\n  and the shapes and sizes of particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM\r\n\r\nMagnetism occupied a large place in the minds of the great thinkers of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There is no doubt that\r\nParacelsus accepted, quite literally, what we embody in figurative\r\nexpressions with regard to magnetism. To him the attraction of sex was\r\nmagnetic. People had personal magnetism because they possessed\r\nphysical powers by which they attracted others. He considered that\r\nthese powers of attraction were expressions in human beings of the\r\npower of the magnet in the physical world, and that the two were\r\nliterally equivalents. Kepler, one of the deepest thinkers of his\r\ntime, evidently entertained the idea that the magnet represented the\r\nsoul of the physical world, and that the planets were held in\r\nconnection with the sun and their satellites with the planets, by\r\nmagnetic attraction. We now call it the attraction of gravitation. We\r\nunderstand the force no better than before, but have changed the\r\nterms. Descartes theorized much along magnetic lines, and felt that by\r\nthe use of certain expressions he was adding to knowledge, though he\r\nwas really only multiplying terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman Magnetism.--How seriously the question of human magnetism was\r\ntaken will perhaps be best appreciated from one old fallacy. For a\r\nlong period it was supposed that human beings were so highly magnetic\r\nthat if a man were exposed in an open boat, in perfectly calm weather,\r\nin the open sea, where no currents would disturb him, his face would\r\nturn to the north, under the same magnetic influences as caused the\r\nneedle to point to the north! Many studies of magnetism were made at\r\nthis time, so that the subject {42} attracted widespread attention.\r\nColumbus had made some rather startling observations on his voyage to\r\nAmerica with regard to the declination of the magnetic needle, and,\r\nduring the century following, Norman and Gilbert made interesting\r\nstudies in the same subject. Father Kircher wrote two books on\r\nmagnetism and there were a number of others written by university\r\nprofessors. Advantage was taken of this thoroughly scientific interest\r\nin magnetism to erect a whole body of pseudo-scientific medicine\r\nsupposed to be founded on magnetic principles. The same theories were\r\nalso applied to supposed explanations of various psychological\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the application of\r\nmagnets was a favorite treatment for a great many diseases. Especially\r\nwere they useful in the treatment of muscular pains and aches and the\r\nchronic diseases which so disturbed men's minds. Many of the joint\r\ntroubles of the aged, the muscular pains and aches that develop from\r\nthe wrong use of muscles, and the vague internal discomforts which\r\noften disturb men so seriously, were cured by the application of\r\nmagnets. Perkins' success with his tractors shows how much can be\r\naccomplished in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROTHERAPY\r\n\r\nThe great development of pseudo-science in medicine remained for the\r\nera following the scientific investigation of electricity. With the\r\ndiscovery of the Leyden jar and its startling spark, a new and\r\nmarvelous healing agent seemed to be at hand. It is quite amusing to\r\nread the accounts of the influence of the spark of the Leyden jar on\r\nthe well and on the ailing. In my \"Catholic Churchmen in Science\"\r\n(Dolphin Press, Phila., 1909) I summed up the situation.\r\n\r\n  Winckler of Leipzig said that the first time he tried the jar, he\r\n  found great convulsions by it in his body; it put his blood into\r\n  great agitation; he was afraid of an ardent fever, and was obliged\r\n  to use refrigerating medicines. He felt a heaviness in his head as\r\n  if a stone lay upon it. Twice it gave him a bleeding at the nose.\r\n  After the second shock his wife could scarcely walk, and, though a\r\n  week later, her curiosity stronger than her fears, she tried it once\r\n  more, it caused her to bleed at the nose after taking it only once.\r\n  Many men were terrified by it, and even serious professors describe\r\n  entirely imaginary symptoms. The jar was taken around Europe for\r\n  exhibition purposes, and did more to awaken popular interest than\r\n  all the publications of the learned with regard to electricity, in\r\n  all the preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the curative power of electric sparks from the\r\nLeyden jar was supposed to go is best appreciated from a list of the\r\naffections that one distinguished electro-therapeutist claimed could\r\nbe not only benefited, but absolutely cured by its employment. It\r\nincluded pulmonic fever, under which title practically all the more or\r\nless acute diseases of the chest were included, and some at least of\r\nthe sub acute; dropsy, by which was meant every effusion into the\r\nabdominal cavity no matter what its cause; dysentery, under which was\r\nincluded at that time not only the specific dysenteries but many of\r\nthe summer complaints and some typhoid fevers; diarrhea, including all\r\nthe intestinal diseases not already grouped under dysentery; putrid\r\nand bilious fever, under which category were assembled the worst cases\r\nof typhoid; typhus {43} fever, and all the other continued fevers, and\r\nany febrile condition reasonably severe for which no other term could\r\nbe used; epidemic diseases, pest, anthrax, small-pox, cancer, gravel,\r\ndiseases of the bladder and of the brain and spinal cord. The Leyden\r\njar had no real effect on any of these affections, but doubtless the\r\nmental effect of this new remedy was quite sufficient to be of\r\ndistinct therapeutic value in the milder forms of many of them.\r\n\r\nWith Galvani's discovery of the twitching of the muscles of the frog\r\nthere came a new impetus to the exploitation of electricity in\r\nmedicine. Many felt that now it was beyond doubt that electrical\r\nenergy bore some definite relation to vital energy--that one might be\r\nmade to replace the other if indeed they were not more or less the\r\nsame thing. This led to many applications of electricity in medicine.\r\nStudents of physiology were convinced that they were getting close to\r\nthe solution of the mystery of life, and their persuasion was readily\r\ncarried over to the people of the time, so that electricity literally\r\nworked wonders on them.\r\n\r\nWhen the various electrical machines were invented and their use\r\npopularized, pseudo-science proceeded to exploit them, and succeeded,\r\nbecause the mechanical shock of the electric current proved a\r\nsuggestive therapeutic stimulant. Gordon in the eighteenth century\r\nmade the first practical frictional electrical machine, and soon some\r\nmen were observing wonderful effects with it, though the charge was so\r\nsmall that it could actually accomplish little. Just after the\r\ninvention of the voltaic pile in 1800 it came to be used in medicine\r\nwith wonderful results. We are prone to think that electrotherapy is\r\nmodern, but when electrical machines were quite crude, current\r\nstrength small and potential low, old-time electro-therapeutists were\r\nrecording their wonderful results and were getting just as marvelous\r\neffects as are reported now by enthusiasts. Considerable\r\nelectro-medical literature existed a century ago when next to nothing\r\nwas known of electricity. When, later, high potency currents came in\r\nand the Wimshurst and other powerful machines were invented, there was\r\nrevealed at each novel invention a new horizon in electro-therapy and\r\nwondrous cures were reported. These continue to occur in the practice\r\nof a few favored individuals, though the general profession secures\r\nonly some ordinary mechanico-muscular effects, which demand much time\r\nfor real good to be accomplished and have nothing at all of the\r\nmarvelous about them.\r\n\r\nThe power of the pseudo-scientific aspect of electricity to influence\r\npatients, far from being lost in our time, has rather been increased.\r\nOur newspapers make their readers eminently suggestible because they\r\nconstantly furnish suggestions, and nothing so strengthens a function\r\nof any kind as exercise of it. All sorts of electrical contrivances\r\nand apparatuses are advertised to cure various pains and aches. Many\r\nof them actually seem to relieve long-standing discomfort, though it\r\nis not through any electrical power that they do so, but entirely\r\nthrough their influence on the patient's mind. A museum of the\r\nelectrical contrivances of various kinds for which absurdly high\r\nprices are paid at the present time and which people recommend to\r\nothers because of having been benefited by them would be interesting.\r\nThere are belts of many kinds, and rings, and medallions, and plates\r\nto be worn on the back and on the chest, and curiously shaped poles or\r\n\"polar plates\" resembling various organs, and pendants and armlets and\r\nanklets and insoles of many, many kinds, usually {44} going in pairs,\r\none made in zinc and the other in copper, and worth exactly as much as\r\nthe weight of copper and zinc in them, yet curing chronic ailments by\r\nsuggestion, or at least bringing relief from many pains and aches\r\ncomplained of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT AND PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\nJust as electricity has always been therapeutically abused by those\r\nwho have taken advantage of the suggestive influence of its marvelous\r\nenergy, so each new discovery in light has been the source of\r\npseudo-scientific applications to medicine. When the explanation of\r\nphotography was first made, shortly after the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and it was demonstrated that it was the blue light, or at\r\nleast that end of the spectrum, and even some of the rays beyond the\r\nvisible violet, which were the most active in this regard,\r\napplications of this fact to popular medicine became the order of the\r\nday. We had a wave of \"blue light therapy\" that wandered over this\r\ncountry and sold tons of blue glass. People simply sat beneath the\r\nblue glass as the sun shone through it and were supposed to absorb the\r\nactinic rays and acquire new life. According to many who had tried\r\nthem, the ultra-violet rays were quite equal in their power to heal\r\nand restore new vigor to old frames to the fabled elixir of life of\r\nthe olden time. \"Rheumatism (that universal ill of the unthinking) in\r\nall its hydra-headed forms disappeared,\" as one enthusiast declared,\r\n\"before the blue light, like the mists of the morning before the sun.\"\r\nAll this, though it is said that the movement had no more serious\r\nfoundation than the desire of a manager of a glass factory, who found\r\nhimself stocked up with blue glass through a mistake, to dispose of\r\nhis surplus stock. He not only did so, but many other manufacturers\r\nturned special attention to the new product because of the demand for\r\nit. The newspaper advertising was through the reading columns. The\r\nresults were heard of on every side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE X-RAY\r\n\r\nThat happened two generations ago, and it might be supposed that in\r\nthe meantime there had been so much advance in popular education, and\r\nparticularly in the diffusion of scientific knowledge, that such a\r\nself-deception on the part of scientists, and blind following by the\r\npeople, could not take place in our time. Just as soon as Roentgen\r\ndiscovered the X-ray, however, we began to have applications of that\r\nwonderful agent to curative purposes. About 1900, scarcely five years\r\nafter Roentgen's discovery, there was hardly an ailment that some one\r\ndid not claim to have seen treated successfully by the X-rays.\r\nEspecially was this true for the chronic and hitherto supposedly\r\nincurable diseases. All the forms of malignant disease were treated by\r\nthe new agent, and some supposedly marvelous cures were reported.\r\nEverything chronic was favorably affected--lupus, rodent ulcer,\r\neczema, acne rosacea, even tuberculosis of the lungs. At the time I\r\nwas on the staff of a medical journal, and the favorable reports came\r\nin so thick and fast that it really looked for a time as though the\r\nsurgery of the future was to be much simplified. It took but a year or\r\ntwo to show us how little of lasting therapeutic benefit there was\r\n{45} in the X-ray, in spite of the fact that it is a marvelous agent\r\nin its action upon living tissues. At the present moment it is used\r\ncomparatively little, and its use is gradually diminishing, except for\r\nvery special limited affections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND RADIO-ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nWhen radium was discovered, though it came so soon after the discovery\r\nof the X-ray and our disappointment with it, the old story of another\r\npseudo-scientific medical application was told. For a time it looked\r\nas though radium might accomplish all that had been promised for the\r\nX-ray, though that promise had been so lamentably broken. Then,\r\nbesides radium, we had brought home to us the whole class of\r\nradio-active substances, and their possibilities. The internal\r\nadministration of radio-active liquids was one of the hopes of\r\ntherapeutics. We had found it difficult to explain how many of the\r\nmineral waters produced the beneficial action credited to them when\r\ntaken at the spring. We knew that artificially made waters of exactly\r\nthe same chemical composition, so far as we could determine, did not\r\nhave the same effect, nor even the waters themselves when taken at a\r\ndistance from the spring.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of the radio-active principle there came the\r\nsuggestion that possibly the main virtue of mineral waters at the\r\nspring was due to radio-activity. This would not be present in\r\nartificial water and would disappear from the natural water during\r\nshipment. This new idea was alluring, and it captured many. Radium\r\nseemed to be the new panacea. But we are discovering its limitations.\r\nIt is of little avail in surgery; it is probably of less avail in\r\nmedicine. As yet, however, we cannot say absolutely and must wait\r\nuntil results are determined. In the mean time many zealous advocates\r\nof the marvelous power of radio-activity to cure are exploiting it,\r\napparently getting results and certainly making money. In the case of\r\nthe mineral waters, also, the most important therapeutic element is\r\nprobably the mental influence, which is strongest at the spring\r\nitself, where the suggestion of efficiency is repeated many times a\r\nday, and where the very atmosphere breathes confidence in the results\r\nto be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION AND PSEUDO-SCIENCE\r\n\r\nThese applications of science, or rather of supposed science,\r\nillustrate the influence of suggestion. The succession of events in\r\neach case is about as follows: The definite attitude of mental\r\nexpectancy is created in the popular mind. As a consequence, with the\r\napplication of the new scientific principle, patients cease inhibiting\r\nthe recovery that would have come spontaneously before, only that they\r\nwere self-centered and had their nervous energies short-circuited.\r\nSome are benefited by the habits of life that are established as a\r\nconsequence of the belief that they are about to be cured, while\r\nbefore this they had been largely confining themselves to their\r\nhouses, and had been refusing to take recreation or get diversion\r\nbecause of the conviction that they were ill. Finally, many of them\r\nhad no real physical ills, but were suffering from mental ailments\r\nbrought on by dreads and by a concentration {46} of attention on\r\ncertain portions of the body which interfered with the normal\r\nphysiologic action of those parts. Whenever strong mental impressions\r\nare produced, from any cause, results will surely follow, some of them\r\nmarvelous. The supposed causes of these results will seem quite absurd\r\nto those who study them afterwards, but they were living realities to\r\nthe sufferers. Nothing is more calculated to produce a strong mental\r\nimpression than a newly discovered scientific fact with some\r\nsupposedly wonderful application to humanity. The subsequent history\r\nof the application of scientific discoveries to medicine has been as\r\ninvariably the same as the primary enthusiasm over each new\r\ntherapeutic agent. After a time some people were not benefited.\r\nPhysicians lost confidence in the power of the new remedial measure,\r\nwhatever it might be. Patients were no longer impressed by the\r\nassurance that they would be benefited, and then the new application\r\nhas either completely disappeared from our list of remedies, or has\r\nremained only to be used by a few, who still report good results from\r\nit. In spite of the constancy of this succession of events, we are\r\nstill quite ready to take up with enthusiasm new discoveries in\r\nscience and their applications to medicine. We have not yet lost the\r\nfeeling, common in earlier centuries, that all science was meant for\r\nman and that every new scientific development must have some special\r\nreference to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nQUACKERY AND MIND CURES\r\n\r\nNot less interesting than the therapeutic results obtained by men who\r\nin good faith were using inert remedies that they thought effective,\r\nare the cures obtained by men who had good reason to know that the\r\ntherapeutic methods they were using were quite inefficient. Their good\r\nresults, often loudly proclaimed by healed patients, are obtained\r\nentirely through the patients' minds. Usually these men are supposed\r\nto possess some wonderful therapeutic secret, which they have obtained\r\nby a fortunate discovery, or by long years of study, though usually\r\ntheir discovery is a myth and their long years of study a fable. So\r\nlong as people can be brought to believe in their powers many cures\r\nare sure to follow their ministrations. The real secret is their\r\nknowledge of human nature. They induce people to tap new sources of\r\nvital energy in themselves, and somehow they succeed in bringing to\r\ntheir aid this law of reserve energy. Besides, in many cases the real\r\nreasons why patients continue to have certain symptoms once they have\r\nbeen initiated, is that their worry about themselves inhibits their\r\nnatural curative power. This inhibition is prevented or obliterated by\r\nthe change of mind produced by the quack, and then the _vis medicatrix\r\nnaturae_ brings about a cure.\r\n\r\nProbably the oldest story that we have of a quack in our modern sense\r\nof the word is found in the Arabian Nights, some of the stories of\r\nwhich were old even in the time of Herodotus. One day Galen, famous\r\nfor his work at Rome in the second century after Christ, found a\r\nwandering healer pursuing his avocation in his front yard. He found\r\nalso that this man succeeded in relieving certain patients for whom he\r\nhad been unable to do anything. He {47} found that the medicines\r\nprescribed were likely to do harm rather than good, yet many of the\r\npatients were benefited.\r\n\r\nGalen succeeded in winning the man's confidence, who told him his\r\nstory. He had been a weaver, but his wife thought he was not making\r\nmoney enough to support her properly, so she had advised him to become\r\na leech. After taking lessons from a wandering quack, he set up for\r\nhimself. When Galen inquired as to his method of making a diagnosis,\r\nhe found that he did it entirely by his knowledge of human nature. He\r\nwas even able to tell what was the matter with patients at a distance\r\nwhen friends came to demand medicine for them.\r\n\r\nWe think that such ready deception was possible only in earlier times,\r\nwhen education was not widely diffused and when belief in\r\nsuperstitions was fostered. Any such idea completely ignores the\r\nmodern status of the quack and the success that he meets among even\r\nthe more intelligent members of the community. Indeed, with the\r\ndiffusion of information in modern times the quack has secured a wider\r\naudience. Superficial ideas of science are disseminated by the\r\nnewspapers and by the magazines, people think that they understand all\r\nabout it, and then these ideas are turned to their own advantage by\r\nthe irregular practitioners of medicine. We have quacks by the score\r\nin all the centers of population, making a livelihood by exploiting\r\nthe ailing, and serving to no small extent to create a feeling of\r\npopular discontent towards the physician, because that serves the\r\npurpose of quackery. Indeed, it is during the past century or a little\r\nmore that some of the most striking examples of quackery have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCagliostro.--Cagliostro, whose story is told in Dumas' \"Memoirs of a\r\nPhysician,\" and an excellent account of whose life may be found in\r\nCarlyle's \"Miscellanies,\" is one of the great quacks and humbugs of\r\nhistory. He began his supposed medical work at Strasburg by the modest\r\nclaim that during his travels in the East he had found a series of\r\nremedies which made old people young. In proof of his power to do this\r\nhe exhibited his wife. She was a handsome young woman of very shady\r\nreputation whom he had married on his travels. She professed to be\r\nsixty years of age, though she was really under thirty and looked it,\r\nbut she claimed that she had a son who had served for many years in\r\nthe Dutch army. This imposition was so effective that in Strasburg,\r\nand subsequently in Paris, the charming pair collected large sums from\r\nwealthy old persons, especially from women on whom the marks of time\r\nhad begun to show, and who expected, as the result of the treatment,\r\nto be shortly as young and as handsome-looking as Madame Cagliostro\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nWe might think that it is quite impossible for any such a deception as\r\nthis supposed renewal of youth to be practiced in our more enlightened\r\nday when popular education is so widely diffused. We must not forget,\r\nhowever, that the newspapers bring us evidence every month of some old\r\nperson who is quite sure that something that was being done for him\r\nwas, if not renewing his youth, at least giving him back much of his\r\npristine vigor, healing his aches and pains, and enabling him to take\r\nup his work once more. In treating the ravages of old age, which would\r\nseem to be altogether beyond any influence of psychotherapy, some of\r\nthe most striking results are obtained. New therapeutic methods for\r\nthe old come into vogue every year. As they grow older, {48} people\r\nbecome discouraged and so do not exert even the natural energy that\r\nthey have for the maintenance of health and the keeping up of\r\nstrength. Their discouragement keeps them from exercising enough, and\r\nthis decreases appetite and sleep, and as a consequence there are many\r\ndisturbances of function. All of this disappears as soon as they feel\r\nencouraged. Brown Sequard and his extract of testicular tissues is a\r\ntypical example of how strong suggestion may influence the old and\r\nmake them think that they are renewing their vigor and strength, and\r\neven their youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerkins, Prince of Quacks.--Shortly after Cagliostro an American\r\nsucceeded in using a very simple idea to gain world fame and at the\r\nsame time to make an immense amount of money. He was a Connecticut\r\nYankee with the typical name, Elisha Perkins. Dr. Perkins must have\r\nbeen born under a lucky star; at least he lived in fortunate\r\ncircumstances for his purposes. Galvani's discovery of the twitchings\r\nthat occur in the frog's legs when a nerve-muscle preparation or its\r\nequivalent was touched by metals in contact, had aroused world-wide\r\ndiscussion as to the place of electricity and magnetism in biology.\r\nVolta's brilliant experiments, which led to the invention of the\r\nVoltaic Pile, still further increased men's interest in this subject.\r\nIt was then that Dr. Perkins came to exploit these electrical and\r\nmagnetic ideas in medicine by means of a very simple invention. It was\r\nindeed the simplicity of his apparatus that made its appeal even more\r\nwide than would otherwise have been the case, and, be it said, left a\r\nlarger measure of profit for the inventor.\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes in his \"Medical Essays\" [Footnote 4] has told\r\nthe story of what may be called the rise and fall of tractoration. Any\r\nphysician who wants to appreciate the real significance of cured cases\r\nshould read Holmes' essay. We quote:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Houghton, Mifflin Co., Boston.]\r\n\r\n  Dr. Elisha Perkins was born at Norwich, Connecticut, in the year\r\n  1740. He had practiced his profession with a good local reputation\r\n  for many years, when he fell upon a course of experiments, as it is\r\n  related, which led to his great discovery. He conceived the idea\r\n  that metallic substances might have the effect of removing diseases,\r\n  if applied in a certain manner; a notion probably suggested by the\r\n  then recent experiments of Galvani, in which muscular contractions\r\n  were found to be produced by the contact of two metals with the\r\n  living fiber. It was in 1796 that Perkins' discovery was promulgated\r\n  in the shape of the Metallic Tractors, two pieces of metal, one\r\n  apparently iron and the other brass, about three inches long, blunt\r\n  at one end and pointed at the other. These instruments were applied\r\n  for the cure of different complaints, such as rheumatism, local\r\n  pains, inflammations, and even tumors, by drawing them over the\r\n  affected parts very lightly for about twenty minutes. Dr. Perkins\r\n  took out a patent for his discovery, and traveled about the country\r\n  to diffuse the new practice.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: (Transcriber: This footnote is not numbered in the\r\n    text but appears to refer to the preceding paragraph.): In one of\r\n    Plautus' plays there is a curiously interesting expression that is\r\n    recalled by this subject. The dramatist described one of his\r\n    characters, Sosia, as thrown into a sleep by the manipulations of\r\n    Mercury. These manipulations are described as _tractim\r\n    tangere_--that is, to touch strokingly. It would remind one very\r\n    much of Perkins' Tractors, and in this regard the fact that\r\n    Mercury was to the Romans, besides being the messenger of the\r\n    gods, the divinity of thieves, seems not without interest.]\r\n\r\nJust what the tractors were composed of may be found in the\r\ndescription of them filed with an application for a patent in the\r\nRolls Chapel Office in London. They were not simply two different\r\nmetals, but a combination of many metals, with even a little of the\r\nprecious metals in them, partly because {49} of the appeal that this\r\nwould make to the multitude, as chloride of gold did to our own\r\ngeneration, but doubtless mainly because the claim of precious metals\r\nentering into the composition enabled the inventor to sell his\r\ntractors at a better price.\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes continues:\r\n\r\n  Perkins soon found numerous advocates of his discovery, many of them\r\n  of high standing and influence. In 1798 the tractors had crossed the\r\n  Atlantic, and were publicly employed in the Royal Hospital at\r\n  Copenhagen. About the same time the son of the inventor, Mr.\r\n  Benjamin Douglass Perkins, carried them to London where they soon\r\n  attracted attention. The Danish physicians published an account of\r\n  their cases in a respectable octavo volume, containing numerous\r\n  instances of alleged success. In 1804 an establishment, honored with\r\n  the name of the Perkinean Institution, was founded in London. The\r\n  transactions of this institution were published in pamphlets, the\r\n  Perkinean Society had public dinners at the Crown and Anchor, and a\r\n  poet celebrated their medical triumphs. [Footnote 6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6:\r\n      \"See pointed metals, blest with power t' appease\r\n       The ruthless rage of merciless disease,\r\n       O'er the frail part a subtle fluid pour,\r\n       Drenched with the invisible galvanic shower,\r\n       Till the arthritic staff and crutch forego\r\n       And leap exulting like the bounding roe!\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Watterson [Footnote 7] tells how he attracted attention. Like all\r\nsuccessful quacks, he had an inborn genius for advertising.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: \"Mesmer and Perkins's Tractors,\"\r\n      _International Clinics_, Vol. III, Series 19. 1909.]\r\n\r\n  He lived in the house once occupied by John Hunter [how\r\n  characteristic this is--the first quack we mentioned in this\r\n  chapter, took up his work in Galen's front yard], and in 1804 the\r\n  Perkinean Institute was opened, but by the end of 1802, 5,000 cases\r\n  had already been treated. Lord Rivers was president. Sir William\r\n  Barker, Vice-President [Prominent legislators, lawyers, bankers\r\n  always lend their names.] Twenty-one physicians, nineteen surgeons,\r\n  and the leading veterinaries succumbed to the influence of the magic\r\n  tractors. One \"eminent physician\" who had had 30 guineas from a\r\n  country patient and had done him no good was very angry when the\r\n  sick man took to Perkinism.\r\n\r\n  \"Why, I could have cured you in the same way with my old brick-bat\r\n  or tobacco pipe, or even my fingers.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Then why, sir,\" answered the patient in a stern voice (Perkins\r\n  quotes this), \"did you dishonorably pick my pocket when you had the\r\n  means of restoring me to health?\"\r\n\r\n  In some 176 pages young Perkins gives us the pick of 2,000 cases who\r\n  had, of course, been foolish enough at first to put faith in the\r\n  ordinary physician and his drugs.\r\n\r\n  In Bath, particularly, where aristocratic London went, as they do\r\n  to-day, to repair the damage wrought by a season in town, the\r\n  Tractor Cure was the talk of the place. But an enemy dwelt there, a\r\n  Dr. Haygarth, an unbeliever. He, with a certain Dr. Falconer,\r\n  fabricated a pair of false tractors. Five cases of gout and\r\n  rheumatism were operated on by the conspirators, who discussed in a\r\n  light tone the wonders of magnetism as they described circles,\r\n  squares and triangles with the sham tractors. \"We were almost afraid\r\n  to look each other in the face lest an involuntary smile should\r\n  remove the mask from our faces,\" says Haygarth, but the two\r\n  assistant doctors, unaware of what was being done, were almost\r\n  converted to Perkinism when they saw the five patients slowly\r\n  mending under the treatment. One man experienced such burning pain\r\n  that he begged to wait till the next day. [Footnote 8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Compare the first effects of the Leyden Jar, related\r\n    in the chapter on Pseudo-Science.]\r\n\r\n  So rapid, and so many were the hospital cures wrought by these two\r\n  doctors, that patients crowded to them and they could hardly spare\r\n  five minutes to eat. They amused themselves inventing other\r\n  instruments made of common nails and sealing wax, and effected with\r\n  them cures, while they sent a pair of false tractors {50} to Sir\r\n  William Watson in London and Dr. Moncriffe in Bristol, who operated\r\n  with them with wonderful results.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be thought that the uneducated, or the\r\nunskilled, or even merely unoccupied, were the only ones taken in by\r\nthe supposed power of Perkins' Tractors. As we have seen, many\r\nphysicians did not hesitate to avow themselves publicly as believers\r\nin this new and marvelous application of magnetism to human healing.\r\nIt is true that the only thing we know about the men who became\r\nadvocates of this new instrumental therapeusis, is their connection\r\nwith it. The attention of the scientific world was rather cleverly\r\nmanaged. Dr. Perkins presented a pair of his tractors and the book\r\nthat he had written about their use to the Royal Society. The custom\r\nof that learned body was to accept such presentations by a formal\r\nletter of thanks and place the objects and books on their shelves. No\r\nformal investigation of the claims to scientific consideration of such\r\npresentations was made. All possible advantage was taken of the fact\r\nthat the Royal Society had accepted the new invention and had publicly\r\nthanked the discoverer for it.\r\n\r\nHow characteristically recent this old story is; it is renewed on\r\nevery possible occasion and wears all the familiar aspect of modern\r\ndevices for securing recognition and obtaining the apparent\r\napprobation or recommendation of some scientific society or\r\ninstitution. We had an example of it a few years ago when a nostrum\r\nexploiter signed the register of an International Congress immediately\r\nafter a great medical investigator and then used a photograph of the\r\nnames for advertising purposes.\r\n\r\nHow did the tractors secure the vogue they enjoyed? Those who believed\r\nin them did so not because of the scientific theory that animal\r\nmagnetism or magnetic influence was behind them, nor because of the\r\nplausible ways of the Connecticut Yankee, but because of the\r\nunquestioned and unquestionable facts of actual healing that they saw\r\nin connection with the use of the tractors. Every one of these\r\napplications of science to medicine that has proved to be\r\npseudo-scientific after enthusiasm subsides has made its appeal\r\nthrough the cures effected by it. Cures are what Eddyism advances to\r\nsupport its claims, cured patients are presented as their most\r\neffective argument by the osteopaths, cured symptoms are the proofs\r\nfor Hahnemannism, but none of these systems of treatment ever cured as\r\nmany cases in a corresponding time as did Perkins' tractors. They\r\ncured all sorts of physical ills, but their only effect was exerted\r\nthrough the mind.\r\n\r\nHolmes wrote:\r\n\r\n  Let us now look at the general tenor of the arguments addressed by\r\n  believers to sceptics and opponents. Foremost of all, blazoned at\r\n  the head of every column, loudest shouted by every triumphant\r\n  disputant, held up as paramount to all other considerations,\r\n  stretched like an impenetrable shield to protect the weakest advocate\r\n  of the great cause against the weapons of the adversary, was\r\n  that omnipotent monosyllable which has been the patrimony of cheats\r\n  and the currency of dupes from time Immemorial--Facts! Facts! FACTS!\r\n  First came the published cases of the American clergymen,\r\n  brigadier-generals, almshouse governors, representatives,\r\n  attorneys and esquires. Then came the published cases of the\r\n  surgeons of Copenhagen. Then followed reports of about one hundred\r\n  and fifty cases, published in England, \"demonstrating the efficacy\r\n  of the metallic practice\" in a variety of complaints, both upon\r\n  the human body and on horses, etc. But the progress of facts in\r\n  Great Britain did not stop here. Let those who rely upon the numbers\r\n  {51} of their testimonials, as being alone sufficient to prove the\r\n  soundness and stability of a medical novelty digest the following\r\n  from the report of the Perkinistic Committee. \"The cases published\r\n  (in Great Britain) amounted, in March last, the date of Mr. Perkins'\r\n  last publication, to about five thousand. Supposing that not more\r\n  than one cure in three hundred, which the tractors have performed,\r\n  has been published, and the proportion is probably much greater,\r\n  it will be seen that the number, to March last, will have exceeded\r\n  one million five hundred thousand!\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that with such \"facts\" behind them the tractors\r\nattracted deep and wide attention. A contemporary tells of it and the\r\nfate of the inventor:\r\n\r\n  A gentleman in Virginia sold a plantation and took the pay for it in\r\n  tractors. Nothing was more common than to sell horses and carriages\r\n  to buy them. But the worst (or the best) of it was, yellow fever was\r\n  raging in New York, and Perkins thought he could cure the fever with\r\n  the tractors and fell a victim to the fever himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess of Quackery.--Always in the history of quackery and, indeed,\r\nin the history of all therapeutics, the appeal is to the cures that\r\nhave been effected. This is the only evidence, of course, that can be\r\nadduced for the development of therapeutics, and yet the history of\r\nmedicine makes it clear how carefully supposed cures must be analyzed\r\nif they are really to mean anything. Mesmer could adduce thousands of\r\ncured cases. Perkins could do the same. Every quack in history, from\r\nGalen's weaver, who became a leech, down to the last street corner\r\nnostrum vendor, does the same thing. When on the strength of supposed\r\ncures, then, a new system of therapeutics is introduced, it is much\r\nmore likely than not that there is no foundation for the claims made.\r\nWe have had ever so many more experiences of disappointment after the\r\nintroduction of remedies which cured at the beginning of their\r\nhistory, than we have had of remedies that maintain themselves after\r\nprolonged experience. It is the attitude of scepticism and suspended\r\njudgment until after a remedy or method of treatment has been tried on\r\nmany different kinds of cases in varying circumstances that\r\nconstitutes the only efficient safeguard against repeating the\r\nunfortunate errors of old times in the matter of drugs and remedial\r\nmeasures. If the public could be made to realize this, they would be\r\nmuch less easily taken in.\r\n\r\nWhat the quacks cure are not always imaginary ills, but often ills\r\nthat are very real, at least to the patients, and the symptoms of\r\nwhich are relieved by the confidence aroused in the new remedy and the\r\nrepresentations of the supposed discoverer, who, in spite of the\r\nexaggerated claims which he makes, somehow succeeds in catching the\r\ntrust of patients. Very often this process initiated by the quack is\r\nreally only the beginning of the cure.\r\n\r\nIn most people a vicious circle of pathological subsidiary causes is\r\nformed when anything becomes the matter. Patients are persuaded that a\r\nserious illness is ahead of them. This keeps them from exercising as\r\nmuch as before. Becoming overcareful of their diet, they reduce it\r\nbelow the normal limit for healthy activity. This causes them to have\r\nless energy for work and disturbs their sleep. Then a host of minor\r\nsymptoms, supposed to be due to the disease, whatever it is or they\r\nthink it is, but really consequent upon the unhealthy habits that have\r\nformed, begin to develop. Just as soon as confidence in their power to\r\nregain health is restored to these people, a virtuous circle, {52} to\r\nuse the Latin word virtue in its etymological sense, of strength and\r\ncourage, is formed. Everything conspires to stimulate the patients;\r\nthey live more naturally, the subsidiary symptoms consequent upon\r\ntheir bad habits disappear and the disappearance of each one of them\r\nmeans for the patients a new assurance of triumph over disease. They\r\nattribute every improvement to the remedy they happen to be taking,\r\nthough most of them are due to the changes in their habits, their\r\ndiversion of mind, and the new energy released by their sense of\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of how some of these mental persuasions in\r\nquackery act, and of how the cure is often really due to the physician\r\nwho previously treated the case, though it is credited to the quack,\r\nmay be found in the story that Hilton tells in his \"Rest and Pain\":\r\n\r\n  When this patient was first seen by a surgeon, he was thought to be\r\n  laboring under some disease of the bladder and kidneys, for he had\r\n  severe lumbago, pain over the bladder, and offensive urine. There\r\n  had been no suspicion of anything wrong as regards the spine. He was\r\n  a master painter and a house decorator, and was monstrously\r\n  conceited, thinking himself right and everybody else wrong. When I\r\n  explained to him, after careful examination, that the spine was the\r\n  cause of the symptoms, he was not satisfied with my opinion and\r\n  without my knowledge consulted Sir Benjamin Brodie, who also assured\r\n  him that his spine was diseased and told him that he must rest it by\r\n  lying down. To this he then assented. As he could not be controlled\r\n  in his own house, I persuaded him to go to Guy's Hospital, where he\r\n  had got nearly well; but he was very impatient, and would not remain\r\n  long enough under my care to be quite cured. He returned home,\r\n  gradually improved, and was getting quite well when some pseudo\r\n  friend advised hydropathy and homeopathy--it did not matter which\r\n  of the two--as \"the thing\" to cure him. After a few months he was\r\n  perfectly restored, not by either hydropathy or homeopathy, but,\r\n  no doubt, by nature. The man, however, feels convinced that\r\n  hydropathy and homeopathy cured him. It so happens, gentlemen, that\r\n  sometimes we do not get the degree of credit which perhaps belongs\r\n  to us.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Hilton's reflections one is tempted to add that many of these\r\npatients, after having been seriously ill, cannot bring themselves to\r\nthink that they will gradually get well by the forces of nature. Even\r\nafter they have improved very much they are still inclined to think\r\nthat that improvement is illusory or will relapse because they have\r\nnot been \"cured,\" that is, actively treated, in some way so that a\r\n\"cure\" should result. When they are nearly well, because of properly\r\ndirected rest and nursing, someone recommends some irregular form of\r\ntreatment. They take it up and this gives them confidence that they\r\nare being cured. This state of mind makes the ultimate steps of their\r\nrecovery more rapid than it otherwise would be. As a consequence, the\r\nirregular gets the credit. Immediately after this case Mr. Hilton\r\ntells the story of another case in which a \"rubber\" got all the credit\r\nfor the cure. It is evident that the modern osteopath has only\r\nsomewhat systematized what had been in existence generations ago.\r\n\r\nAll this tendency of human nature to respond to anything that is done\r\nfor it, provided the promise of cure goes with it, is taken advantage\r\nof by the quack, sometimes unconsciously, for his own purposes.\r\nResults, as a rule, are secured, in spite of the remedies that he\r\nsuggests, which in most cases do harm rather than good. Of the\r\nthousands of remedies that have been introduced by quacks, not one now\r\nremains, though every one of them produced {53} wonderful cures on a\r\ngreat many patients at some time or other. It is the duty of the\r\nphysician to secure just as good results honestly. He must influence\r\nthe patient's mind favorably so as to bring about a modification of\r\nhabits and a hopeful outlook on life, in spite of whatever ailment\r\nthere may be. If he can do so he will have in his hands the best\r\ntherapeutic measure that has been employed in all the history of\r\nmedicine. It is the most universally applicable. It will cure, that is\r\nhelp, all forms of disease. It will relieve many of the symptoms of\r\neven incurable diseases. It will occasionally arouse the resistive\r\nvitality of the patient to such an extent that even apparently\r\nincurable diseases will be overcome. This is the lesson that the\r\nmodern student of medicine must draw from the history of quackery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nNOSTRUMS AND THE HEALING POWER OF SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the power of the mind to bring about the\r\ncure of ailments and symptoms of every sort is found in the history of\r\nthe many nostrums and remedies that have worked wonders for a time and\r\nlater proved to be inert or even harmful. The ordinary definition of a\r\nnostrum includes the idea of secrecy. At all times in the world's\r\nhistory fortunes have been made out of such remedies. They appeal not\r\nonly to the uneducated, but also to those who are supposed to be well\r\ninformed, and this in spite of the fact that generally the remedies\r\nare claimed to do good for nearly every form of disease, and it must\r\nbe evident to anyone, after a moment's serious thought, that the one\r\nidea of their inventor is not to benefit patients, but to make money.\r\n\r\nWith the multiplication of newspapers and magazines, there has been a\r\ngreat increase in these secret remedies and of their users. Apparently\r\nall that is needed for many people who are ailing, or think they are\r\nailing, is to be told in a more or less impressive way that some\r\nremedy will cure, and then it proceeds to do them good. There is a\r\ngeneral impression abroad that some of these remedies represent great\r\ndiscoveries in medicine, and the feeling of most of those who take\r\nthem is that the inventor has found a new and wonderful remedy. During\r\nall the centuries such secret remedies have come and gone, and not one\r\nof them has proved to be of lasting value. Just as soon as its\r\ncomposition is no longer a secret it begins to fail. It is, therefore,\r\nevident that its effect was entirely due to influence on the mind and\r\nnot at all to any influence on the body.\r\n\r\nThe stories of the origin of these remedies bear a striking\r\nsimilarity. There are two variants on the theme: either the inventor\r\nis supposed to be an earnest student of science, devoting himself to\r\nprofound research for many years and finally finding some wonderful\r\nsecret of nature hitherto hidden from men; or else the remedy has been\r\ndiscovered by happy accident, and some chronic sufferer pronounced by\r\nthe most eminent physicians to be hopelessly incurable has in despair\r\nturned to the now method, caring little really, so discouraged is he,\r\nwhether it does good or ill, and wakes up to find that he is on the\r\nhigh road to recovery, apparently having been directed by Providence\r\nin the use of the remedy in question. Overflowing with gratitude, he\r\n{54} wants to share the heaven-sent blessing with all mankind--for a\r\nvaluable consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weapon Ointment.--Among the most famous nostrums, and a striking\r\nexample of the great role played in therapeutics by mental influence\r\nand coincidence, is the Unguentum Armariam or Weapon Ointment. This\r\nfamous remedy would cure any wound made by a weapon, if it could only\r\nbe employed before the fatal effects were absolutely manifest. There\r\nwas an abundance of evidence that it stopped the pain, checked the\r\nbleeding and initiated the restoration of the patient to health. We\r\nknow the remedy not from traditions of its use among the uneducated,\r\nbut from descriptions that we have by men who were among the best\r\neducated of their time, and that by no means an era of dullards. The\r\nstory of this infallible remedy is all the more surprising because it\r\nwas not applied to the wound itself, nor indeed to the sufferer at\r\nall, but _to the weapon which inflicted the wound_. Nay, it was well\r\nauthenticated that, where the weapon could not be secured for\r\ninunction, if the ointment were applied to a wooden model of the\r\nweapon, the cure followed with almost, though, it was confessed by\r\nsome, not quite so much assurance as in the fortunate case of the\r\nweapon being available.\r\n\r\nThe story has been so well told by Oliver Wendell Holmes in his\r\n\"Medical Essays\" [Footnote 9] that it seems best to retell it in\r\nabstracts from his \"Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions.\" He says:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston.]\r\n\r\n  Fabricius Hildanus, whose name is familiar to every surgical\r\n  scholar, and Lord Bacon, who frequently dipped a little into\r\n  medicine, are my principal authorities for the few circumstances I\r\n  shall mention regarding it. The Weapon Ointment was a preparation\r\n  used for the healing of wounds, but instead of its being applied to\r\n  them, the injured part was washed and bandaged, and the weapon with\r\n  which the wound was inflicted was carefully anointed with the\r\n  unguent. Empirics, ignorant barbers, and men of that sort are said\r\n  to have especially employed it. _Still there was not wanting some\r\n  among the more respectable members of the medical profession who\r\n  supported its claims_. [Italics ours.] The composition of this\r\n  ointment was complicated, in the different formulas given by\r\n  different authorities; but some substances addressed to the\r\n  imagination, rather than the wound or weapon, entered into all. Such\r\n  were portions of mummy, of human blood and of moss from the skull of\r\n  a thief hung in chains.\r\n\r\n  Hildanus was a wise and learned man, one of the best surgeons of his\r\n  time. He was fully aware that a part of the real secret of the\r\n  Unguentum Armarium consisted in the washing and bandaging the wound\r\n  and then letting it alone. But he could not resist the solemn\r\n  assertions respecting its efficacy; he gave way before the outcry of\r\n  facts (!), and therefore, instead of denying all their pretensions,\r\n  he admitted and tried to account for them upon supernatural grounds.\r\n\r\nHolmes says further:\r\n\r\n  Lord Bacon speaks of the weapon ointment, in his Natural History, as\r\n  having in its favor the testimony of men of credit, though, in his\r\n  own language, he himself \"as yet is not fully inclined to believe\r\n  it.\" His remarks upon the asserted facts respecting it show a\r\n  mixture of wise suspicion and partial belief. He does not like the\r\n  precise directions given as to the circumstances under which the\r\n  animals from which some of the materials were obtained were to be\r\n  killed, for he thought it looked like a provision for an excuse in\r\n  case of failure, by laying the fault to the omission of some of\r\n  these circumstances. But he likes well that \"they do not observe the\r\n  confecting of the Ointment under any certain constellation; which\r\n  is commonly the excuse of magical medicines, when they fail, that\r\n  they {55} were not made under a fit figure of heaven.\" It was\r\n  pretended that if the offending weapon should not he had, it would\r\n  serve the purpose to anoint a wooden one made like it. \"This,\" says\r\n  Lord Bacon, \"I should doubt to be a device to keep this strange form\r\n  of cure in request and use, because many times you cannot come by\r\n  the weapon itself.\" And in closing his remarks on the statements of\r\n  the advocates of the ointment, he says, \"Lastly, it will cure a\r\n  beast as well as a man, which I like best of all the rest, because\r\n  it subjecteth the matter to an easy trial.\" It is worth remembering\r\n  that more than 200 years ago, when an absurd and fantastic remedy\r\n  was asserted to possess wonderful power, and when sensible persons\r\n  ascribe its pretended influence to imagination, it was boldly\r\n  answered that the cure took place when the wounded party did not\r\n  know of the application made to the weapon, and even when the brute\r\n  animal was the subject of the experiment, and that this assertion,\r\n  lie as we all know it was, came in such a shape as to shake the\r\n  incredulity of the keenest thinker of his time.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to follow up some of the controversies among\r\nscientific men with regard to the weapon ointment, for they serve to\r\nshow how the remedy came to maintain its prominence for so long.\r\nPodmore, in his \"Mesmerism and Christian Science\" (London, 1909),\r\ntells the story of the controversy between Goclenius, a professor of\r\nmedicine at the University of Marburg, who published as the Inaugural\r\nThesis for his professorship, a treatise on the \"Weapon Salve,\" and\r\nFather Roberti, a Jesuit scientist and philosopher, whose final\r\ntreatise in the controversy was entitled after the lengthy fashion of\r\ntitles in that day, \"Goclenius Corrected Out of His Own Mouth; or, The\r\nDownfall of the Magnetic Cure and the Weapon Salve.\" The decision of\r\nthe controversy was eventually referred to the great physician of the\r\ntime. Van Helmont, who decided that both disputants were partly wrong,\r\nthe Jesuit erring most, but that above all Goclenius should\r\ndistinguish between the cases when the weapon had blood on it and when\r\nit had not. When there is blood on the weapon, he held, then the salve\r\nis always effective; when there is not, then much stronger remedies\r\nwere required. In both cases, of course, the salve or ointment was\r\napplied to the weapon.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this discussion of the points at issue, it is\r\ninteresting to note Van Helmont's opinion with regard to many curious\r\nthings used in medicine at that time. He insists that Goclenius makes\r\na mistake in attributing therapeutic power alone to the moss taken\r\nfrom the skull of a condemned criminal who had been hung in chains.\r\nThis material, under the name of _usnea_, was apparently quite popular\r\nin prescriptions for various chronic ills, and especially those that\r\nwe now recognize as prolonged neurotic affections. Van Helmont\r\nemphasizes the fact that the experience of all physicians shows that\r\nmaterial taken from the heads of condemned criminals executed in other\r\nways, as, for instance, those broken on the wheel, may be just as\r\neffective. Van Helmont conceived of the magnetic and sympathetic\r\nfeeling as a natural process. All the force of the stars might be\r\nconcentrated in objects that had been beneath their beams for a long\r\ntime, and this might be communicated in some wonderful way to patients\r\nso as to supply defects of vitality. Such defects of vitality Van\r\nHelmont's prescriptions actually were compensating, but the source was\r\nin the patients themselves--that reservoir of surplus energy which\r\nremains unused unless some strong suggestion brings it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSympathetic Powder.--After the weapon ointment, the best known of the\r\nnostrums of older times is probably Sir Kenelm Digby's famous\r\nSympathetic {56} Powder, which Dr. Holmes talks of as even better\r\nknown than its great therapeutic predecessor. This, too, was a\r\nwonderworker. Unlike the Unguentum Armarium, however, its composition\r\nwas simple. It was nothing else than copper sulphate which had been\r\nallowed to deliquesce to a white powder. This powder would cure any\r\ninjury as infallibly as the weapon ointment. It, too, was not applied\r\nto the wound, but to the _bloodstained_ garments (Van Helmont's\r\ndistinctions between the bloody and the bright weapon should be\r\nrecalled) of the wounded person. The patient did not need to be\r\npresent at the time the application was made. He might be far away and\r\nyet its efficacy was, according to many very intelligent and highly\r\neducated persons, quite assured.\r\n\r\nFor the sympathetic powder we have one of the stories of far-fetched\r\ndiscovery that have since become so familiar. A missionary, traveling\r\nin the East, was said to have brought the recipe to Europe about the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, in whose\r\ndominions the missionary took up his residence, heard of the cures\r\nperformed by him and tried by offers of money and favor to obtain the\r\nmissionary's secret, but without success. Sir Kenelm Digby, however,\r\nwho was traveling in Italy, happened by good fortune to do a favor for\r\nthe missionary, and put him under such deep obligations that he felt\r\nthe only way he could properly repay his benefactor was to confide to\r\nhim the composition of this wonderful remedy. Sir Kenelm Digby was at\r\nthis time one of the best known of English scholars. After having\r\nreached distinction in the English navy, he had devoted himself to\r\nliterature, to philosophy, and to politics. He had devoted much time\r\nto the old books of alchemy. Therefore, the offer of this precious\r\npiece of information especially appealed to him. On his return to\r\nEngland he proceeded to use it for the benefit of his friends, and it\r\ncreated a sensation. The French dictionary of the Medical Sciences\r\ntells the story of the application of the powder for the first time in\r\nEngland and of the subsequent use of it, especially on the nobility of\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n  An opportunity soon presented itself to try the powers of the famous\r\n  powder. A certain Mr. Howell, having been wounded in endeavoring to\r\n  part two of his friends who were fighting a duel, submitted himself\r\n  to a trial of the sympathetic powder. Four days after he received\r\n  his wounds, Sir Kenelm dipped one of Mr. Howell's garters in a\r\n  solution of the powder, and immediately, it is said, the wounds,\r\n  which were very painful, grew easy, although the patient, who was\r\n  conversing in a corner of the chamber, had not the least idea of\r\n  what was doing with his garter. He then returned home leaving his\r\n  garter in the hands of Sir Kenelm, who had hung it up to dry, when\r\n  Mr. Howell sent his servant in a great hurry to tell him that his\r\n  wounds were paining him horribly; the garter was therefore replaced\r\n  in the solution of the Powder, and the patient got well after five\r\n  or six days of its continued immersion.\r\n\r\n  King James I, his son, afterwards Charles I, the Duke of Buckingham,\r\n  then Prime Minister, and all the principal personages of the time\r\n  were cognizant of this fact; and James himself, being curious to\r\n  know the secret of this remedy, asked it of Sir Kenelm, who revealed\r\n  it to him, and his majesty had the opportunity of making several\r\n  trials of its efficacy, _which all succeeded in a surprising manner_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTar Water and Therapeutic Faith.--One further story of an old nostrum\r\ndeserves to be told because of the distinction of its chief promoter,\r\nwho did not, however, as do most of the nostrum promoters, make a\r\nfortune by it. {57} This is the incident of Bishop Berkeley and his\r\ntar water. Berkeley was one of the leaders of thought of the\r\neighteenth century. At one time he came to America with the idea of\r\nenlightening the ignorance of the colonists and of founding a school\r\nof philosophy. Besides being one of the most learned men of his time,\r\nhe was one of the best. He was known for his gentleness, his\r\nunselfishness, and his lack of pretension. Yet all of these virtues\r\nwere unable to save him from falling a victim to a medical delusion.\r\nOne of his essays is on the value of tar water in medicine, and is\r\nentitled \"Siris, a Chain of Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries\r\nConcerning the Virtues of Tar Water,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTar water was prepared by stirring a gallon of water with a quart of\r\ntar, letting it stand for several days, and then pouring off the clear\r\nwater. It, in fact, retained scarcely more of the tar than the odor.\r\nAccording to the great philosopher, this not only cured, but prevented\r\ndiseases. The list is, indeed, so long that it is hard to understand\r\nhow the claims for it could have received any credence. They did,\r\nhowever, and Berkeley himself, and many of his friends, were cured of\r\nmany and various ills, and were protected from many more by its\r\nfrequent use. The odor was the factor that proved of suggestive value\r\nand set free the springs of vital energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla.--It might be thought that such deception of self and\r\nothers as has been illustrated in the weapon salve and sympathetic\r\npowder would be impossible in our enlightened day. Anyone who thinks\r\nso forgets certain incidents of recent times. The story of\r\nsarsaparilla is a striking illustration. Few drugs have been more\r\npopular in the last half century, and it is even yet popularly\r\nsupposed to be a wonderful tonic, a cure for many diseases. During the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century, when the humoral theory of the\r\ncausation of diseases was generally accepted, certain German\r\nphysicians thought they observed that a decoction of sarsaparilla was\r\na sovereign remedy for various ailments having their origin in the\r\nblood. The blood was at that time supposed to become impure for many\r\nreasons, and the possibility of neutralizing such impurity by medical\r\nmeasures was seriously attempted. As Virchow used to insist, the\r\nhumoral pathology still holds its ground in popular estimation, and so\r\nblood purifiers are favorite remedies, and will doubtless continue to\r\nbe for at least another generation, until cellular pathology secures a\r\nhold on the popular mind.\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla came in, then, as a great blood purifier, and was used\r\nfor ten years by many of the physicians of the world, confident that\r\nthey were obtaining excellent results from its use. After a time,\r\nhowever, further study of the drug showed that it was inert. Gradually\r\nthe employment of sarsaparilla as a remedial agent ceased, though it\r\ncontinued to be used as an elegant vehicle in the prescription of\r\nnauseating remedies.\r\n\r\nOnly after it had been thus abandoned by the regular profession, was\r\nit taken up extensively by others who advertised its virtues widely\r\nand secured a great clientele for it. Probably more money has been\r\nspent on sarsaparilla during the last fifty years than on any other\r\nsingle drug. Many millions were every year appropriated by rival\r\nconcerns to advertise its virtues. It has been possible at any time\r\nduring the last half century to secure any number of people who were\r\nwilling and ready to declare--and most of them convinced of the truth\r\nof what they said--that various preparations of {58} sarsaparilla had\r\ncured them of long-standing ills, and that they considered it a\r\nlife-saving remedy.\r\n\r\nThe efficient ingredient in the sarsaparilla, so far as any of its\r\nvarious preparations have seemed to do good, has not been anything\r\nthat was in the bottle, but the printer's ink that was absorbed from\r\nthe outside of it. People were persuaded that they would get better,\r\nand, as far as most of them were concerned, this was of itself quite\r\nsufficient to turn the scale in favor of improvement that led to the\r\nobliteration of symptoms. So long as these symptoms were a source of\r\nworry and trouble to them, they continued to be quite incurable. Just\r\nas soon as the inhibition of nervous energy, due to worry and\r\nover-attention to their sensations, stopped, then the natural force of\r\nthe body was sufficient to remove the sources of complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychology, Old and New, of Remedies.--Men have always known how to\r\ntake advantage of the possibility of influencing patients' minds by\r\nwondrous claims for remedies. Anyone is sadly deceived who thinks that\r\nit is only in recent times that men have learned to make their\r\nadvertisements of nostrums suggestive by the promises made or that we\r\nhave developed the psychology of advertising to such a degree as to\r\nappeal to the ailing more forcibly and surely than was done in the\r\npast. Here is the announcement that went with a remedy in old Irish\r\nmedicine more than 1,000 years ago. It was, according to its inventor,\r\n\"a preservative from death, a restorative for the want of sinews\r\n(strength), for the tongue-tied, a cure for swelling in the head, and\r\nof wounds from iron and of burning by fire, and of the bite of the\r\nhound; it preventeth the lassitude of old age, cures the decline, the\r\nrupture of the blood vessels, takes away the virulence of the\r\nfestering sore, the fever of the blood, the poignancy of grief--he to\r\nwhom it shall be applied shall be made whole.\" The announcement ended\r\nup with the panegyric \"extolled be the elixir of life bequeathed by\r\nDiancecht to his people; by which everything to which it is applied is\r\nmade whole.\" When it is noted that, besides death and loss of muscle\r\npower and aphasia and wounds and burns and bites, it also cures old\r\nage and consumption (for that is what is meant by decline) and\r\nhemorrhages, and probably aneurysms, and fevers and also grief, there\r\nare not many modern panaceas that exceed it in power.\r\n\r\nAlways, as in this Irish announcement of the olden time, the climax of\r\nthe advertisement is a note of exultant praise for the inventor who\r\nhas brought such a magnificent blessing to mankind. The ways of the\r\nnostrum vender are ever the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoman Nostrums.--How old are all these methods, and how little human\r\nnature has changed through all the centuries! The patent medicine men\r\nof Rome in the early Christian eras made use of just the same methods\r\nthat are employed to-day. Friedlaender, in his \"Roman Life and Manners\r\nUnder the Early Roman Empire,\" tells the story well. Many remedies\r\nwere known by special arbitrary names, instead of descriptive names\r\nrecalling the ingredients. Sometimes they were named after famous\r\nphysicians who had used them, or were said to have done so; again, the\r\npreparations were named after persons of distinction who actually, or\r\nsupposedly, were cured thereby, much as, in our own day, cigars are\r\nnamed after poets, statesmen and pugilists. The titles of some of\r\nthese preparations, for instance, were \"Ointment for Gout, Made for\r\nPatroculus, Imperial Freedman--Safe Cure\"; \"Ointment for {59} Aburnius\r\nValens\" (probably the famous jurist) called the \"Expensive Ointment\";\r\n\"Eye Salve with Which Florus Cured Antonia, the Wife of Drusus (the\r\nEmperor's son) After the Other Doctors had Nearly Blinded Her.\" Many\r\nof these remedies were labeled \"instantaneous,\" \"safe,\" \"sure cure,\"\r\n\"Harmless remedy,\" and the like. Frequently euphonious names,\r\nsometimes from the Greek, were chosen: Ambrosia, Anicetum, Nectarium,\r\nfor the promoters evidently knew the satisfying effect, on both\r\npatient and physician, of a mystifying foreign name.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proprietary Remedies_.--A corresponding abuse very like that of our\r\nown time was with reference to proprietary medicines. Physicians,\r\ninstead of compounding their own, accepted those made by others with\r\nthe exaggerated claims for them, used them on patients, transferring\r\ntheir own confidence in them to the patients, thus producing cures\r\nwhich, after a time, proved to be due entirely to the influence on the\r\npatient's mind. Pliny, the elder, complains that physicians of his\r\ntime (the first century after Christ) often bought their remedies so\r\nas to avoid the trouble of preparation. He evidently refers to\r\ncompounds supposed to be curative for various affections; for\r\nFriedlaender says that \"often the physicians did not know the exact\r\ningredients of the compounds that they used and should they desire to\r\nmake up written prescriptions, would be cheated by the salesmen.\" Both\r\nGalen and Pliny complain that physicians used ready-made medicines,\r\ninstead of original prescriptions carefully prepared by or under the\r\nsupervision of the physicians themselves. It is evident that the\r\nproprietary remedy had come into existence thus early, and that\r\nvarious drug manufacturers made specialties which physicians,\r\nfollowing the line of least resistance, found it easy to prescribe,\r\nthough men like Pliny and Galen realized that this was an abdication\r\nof one of the most important functions of their profession, which was\r\nbound to work harm in the end both to themselves and to their\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nHow curious it is to find exactly the same state of affairs recurring\r\nin our time, with absolutely similar results. Simple remedies that are\r\nwell known combinations of ordinary drugs receive high-sounding names,\r\nusually derivatives from the Greek or the like, and are claimed to\r\nwork just as many wonders as the old-fashioned nostrums. Even\r\nimitations of the old-fashioned poultices, when thus exploited, give a\r\nnew lease of life to the exploded idea of the drawing-out power of\r\nexternal applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Ailments and Nostrums.--Certain ailments are particularly the\r\nsubject of exploitation by the manufacturers of remedies. Rheumatism\r\nis one of these, neuralgia is another, catarrh is a third, and\r\nheadache a fourth. Then there are various forms of indigestion and all\r\nthe pains and aches associated with it. All of these ailments are\r\nrather vague and are in some cases at least, due to the insistent\r\ndwelling of the patient's mind on some symptom of very little\r\nsignificance. Others are real pains and aches, relieved by some simple\r\nanodyne drugs, doubly efficient when taken with the suggestion that\r\nthey represent a wonderful discovery, which came only after long years\r\nof study and investigation, and are said to represent a new departure\r\nin medicine. Another favorite field for the nostrum vender is the\r\nseries of pains and aches associated with the menstrual condition.\r\nMany of these nostrums are used by hundreds of thousands, and yet an\r\nanalysis shows that probably the only active substance in them is the\r\nalcohol in which certain of the drug {60} principles are dissolved.\r\nThis makes the patient feel better by the exaltation that comes from\r\nthe dose of alcohol and the rest is merely suggestion, though there is\r\nno doubt that symptoms which have failed to be cured by physicians are\r\nsometimes relieved by these remedies. It is a cure by faith, not by\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCured Cases as Evidence.--As all of the nostrums, and indeed all the\r\ntherapeutic movements supposedly medical or physical or religious,\r\nsecure their vogue on the strength of reported cures, this would seem\r\nto be the best possible evidence for the efficacy of a remedy. But\r\nunless the cases supposed to be cured are critically examined and\r\nanalyzed, and above all, followed for some time afterwards, such\r\nevidence is open to all sorts of errors. Is it any wonder, then, that\r\nthe physician, familiar with the history of medicine in this regard,\r\nasks for the careful study and analysis of these cases. We know that\r\nit was on the strength of cures effected by it, that the weapon\r\nointment became possible throughout Europe. We know that portions of\r\nthe body of executed criminals and the touch of the hanged cured as\r\nmany cases as, let us say, osteopathy or Eddyism. The sympathetic\r\npowder and its advocates appealed to the many cures that followed its\r\nuse. Every other nostrum from the beginning of time has made this same\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAMULETS, TALISMANS, CHARMS\r\n\r\nAmulets, talismans, charms--these words are commonly used with\r\nsomething of the same significance, and for our purpose all three may\r\nbe treated in common.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylactic Objects.--From the earliest ages men have worn amulets,\r\nthat is, objects often resembling jewelry, though sometimes the\r\nremains of animals or even of men, [Footnote 10] with the idea that\r\nthey would ward off illness, or cure it when present. Rings of many\r\nsorts, brooches, various objects suspended around the neck, ear-rings,\r\nhead-bands, belts for the waist, and rings for the wrists and the\r\nankles, ornamented bracelets and anklets, have at all times had a\r\nmedicinal power attached to them in some minds. Earrings are still\r\nworn by many with the idea that they are helpful in affections of the\r\neyes. I have known children's ears to be pierced and earrings inserted\r\nbecause the little ones were suffering from headache. Precious stones\r\nwere supposed to have this power when worn. The amethyst protected its\r\nwearer from drunkenness; the bloodstone cured anemia; while the opal\r\nwas supposed to portend evil. Occasionally such gems were ground up\r\nand used as internal or external remedies, because of the power\r\nsupposed to be attached to them. Their influence upon the mind, at\r\nleast, can be readily understood. The earliest prescription we have in\r\nAmerica is at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, among the curiosities\r\nfrom Egypt (about 1500 B.C.). It calls for the use of ground up\r\nprecious stones in fumigations, probably for an hysterical person.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 10: A king of Italy of the later nineteenth century used\r\n  to send the parings of his toe-nails to friends to be worn in rings\r\n  for luck and protection against disease.]\r\n\r\nThe precious metals were used also as powerful cures. Chaucer says,\r\n\"for {61} gold in physick is a cordial.\" Some think that our own use\r\nof chloride of gold a few years ago for many chronic ills had little\r\nmore reason than the preciousness of gold impressing itself on\r\npatients. Inscriptions were made on the metals, and these were\r\nsupposed to add to their healing or preservative quality. Famous among\r\nthese was the abracadabra. It had to be written in a particular\r\ntriangular form, and was then very powerful. Here the amulet invades\r\nthe sphere of the charm. Prayers were written on parchment, or on\r\npaper, or on papyrus, in the old time in Egypt, Babylon and Assyria,\r\nand when worn about the body were supposed to do great good. It is\r\nsurprising to us now how many physicians and scientists placed\r\nconfidence in these things because they thought that they had seen\r\ngood results. Alexander of Tralles recommends a number of them. Robert\r\nBoyle, the father of chemistry, says that he was cured of a severe\r\nague, that the doctors could not benefit, by the application of an\r\namulet to his wrists. Burton, in the \"Anatomy of Melancholy,\" has a\r\nseries of references that show how much he, himself, and the educated\r\nmen of his time, believed in the power of amulets to help in illnesses\r\nand Boyle, particularly, has a number of references to precious stones\r\nand their curative virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\nRings in Therapy.--Under Faith Cures I mention the cramp rings blest\r\nby the Queen of England and effective against abdominal pains. Other\r\nkinds of therapeutic rings were used rather commonly. All through the\r\nMiddle Ages iron rings were worn, which were good for colic and\r\nbiliousness and also for rheumatic pains. There are literally\r\nthousands of such rings worn now, here in the United States, and by\r\nquite intelligent people. Personally, I know of more than a dozen\r\ncases where they have been worn for years. The wearers faithfully take\r\nthem off each day, rub off the rust which collects on the inside, call\r\ntheir own and others' attention to the fact that all this material has\r\nbeen drawn out of the body through the supposed electrical power of\r\nthe ring, and then they replace them. Here is pseudo science obtruding\r\nitself. Usually these rings are of polished steel and look a little\r\nlike silver. They may, however, be obtained in gold plate, and then\r\nare supposed to be quite as efficacious. The iron or steel rings cost\r\ntwo dollars each; gold-plated rings cost five to ten dollars,\r\naccording to the ability of the patient to pay, for metallotherapy has\r\nas one of its effects the lessening of congestion of the purse. Those\r\nwho wear them would not part with them, because they feel the benefits\r\nderived. These rings are supposed to be particularly good for vague,\r\npainful conditions in the joints, especially the so-called rheumatic\r\npains.\r\n\r\nIn old times these rings were sometimes engraved with a legend that\r\nwas itself a strong suggestive element. The rings of the Middle Ages\r\nthat were supposed to be a cure for biliousness were engraved with a\r\ncommand to the bile to go and take possession of a bird. Occasionally\r\nrings were supposed to be valuable because of their origin. Epileptic\r\nfits, for instance, were rendered much less frequent and less severe\r\nif a ring made of money that had been given in the church were worn.\r\nThe condition was that the sufferer should stand at the church door\r\nasking a penny from every unmarried man who passed in or out. After\r\nsufficient alms had been thus collected the money was exchanged for\r\nsilver money that had been contributed to the church, and from this\r\nthe ring was made. It was to have a cross and sometimes a verselet\r\nfrom Scripture, or an exorcism, or a prayer, engraved on it. It is\r\n{62} easy to understand that all of this represents strong suggestive\r\ninfluence and that the standing at the church door begging alms might\r\nwell represent an enforced prolonged opportunity to get rest and air,\r\nfor many unmarried men do not go to church, and so there were also\r\nphysical factors at work in the cure noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecious Stones as Preservatives.--Pettigrew, in his \"Superstitions\r\nConnected with Medicine and Surgery,\" mentions a number of the\r\nprecious stones and their power to heal. Garnet hung about the neck\r\nrelieves sorrow and refreshes the heart; chrysolite is the wisdom\r\nstone, the enemy of folly; heliotrope staunches blood and acts as an\r\nantidote; sapphire is good for ague and gout, and also gives its\r\nwearer courage; it also stops bleeding at the nose and was an\r\nantidote; the topaz was good for lunatics; the carnelian cured bloody\r\nfluxes and also fluxes of anger and passion. Jasper, hematite and\r\nsimilar stones had certain general powers of doing good. The Bezoar\r\nstone had a great reputation against melancholy; the smaragdum was\r\ninfallible against epilepsy; the onyx was good for sleep; the sardonyx\r\nprevented bad dreams. The most wonderful stone, however, was the\r\nagate; taken in liquid it was good for any disease. It made the skin\r\nhealthy. It preserved against snakebite, and against all poisons, and\r\nit prevented the devil from injuring one who wore it or drank it, and\r\nalso preserved him from being struck by lightning. Considering how\r\ncommon agates were and how readily they could be obtained, it is\r\nrather surprising that we should have so many stories of illness and\r\ndeaths by lightning and from poison and from venomous serpents in the\r\nold days when its curative value was rated so high.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmulets.--The coin given by the kings of England when they healed the\r\nscrofulus or epileptic came to be, in one sense, an amulet. The sight\r\nand the touch of this acted as an ever recurrent suggestion tending to\r\nmake these patients better, and undoubtedly the coin was of great\r\nservice by its renewal of the mental influence of the touch of the\r\nking. There are traditions, also, that these coins healed others who\r\ntouched them, and sometimes for generations they were kept in families\r\nas representing a fountain of healing and of preservation of health.\r\nAny object that thus became invested with reverence produced healing\r\neffects. Virchow, in the introduction to Schliemann's \"Troas,\" tells\r\nof going to a long distance for water, during the time when he was\r\npresent at the excavations, in order to be sure that the water would\r\nbe absolutely pure. The natives had heard that he was a great\r\nphysician from the West. They concluded that the reason why he went to\r\nthis particular distant spring for water, in spite of the trouble\r\ninvolved, was that it must have some wonderful healing virtues.\r\nAccordingly a tradition of healing grew up around it, and people came\r\nfrom long distances, drank from it and were cured.\r\n\r\nThere are still people who carry horse chestnuts for rheumatism, and\r\noccasionally a farmer carries a potato for the same purpose. The\r\nfeeling is, if they do no good, at least they can do no harm.\r\nDoubtless in the Middle Ages the same feeling prevailed as to other\r\nfavorite objects. At present, among the better informed classes,\r\nvarious pendants supposed to have some connection with electricity are\r\npopular. I have seen a medal made of alternate discs of copper and\r\nzinc, and confidently believed to be strongly electrical, worn even by\r\nan otherwise sensible merchant in a country town. Electric belts still\r\nare {63} extremely common--and expensive. Supposed electric insoles,\r\none made of copper, the other of zinc, are sold in great numbers and\r\nat good prices, though, quite needless to say, they are absolutely\r\ninert electrically. Various electric contrivances, small batteries,\r\nand the like, really are of the nature of amulets. People have a faith\r\nin them that is not justified by anything in science, but that faith\r\nhelps them in their ills. Most of the supposed medicinal plasters are\r\nin the same class. As a rule, sufficient curative material cannot be\r\nincorporated in a plaster to be of any service, and most of them,\r\nthough widely advertised, are scarcely more than rubber adhesive\r\nplaster. They do good partly by their mechanical effect, because they\r\nactually support muscles, but mainly because of faith in their\r\nefficacy. Whenever a particular discomfort occurs the feeling that a\r\nplaster is covering the spot gives the patient assurance that he or\r\nshe must soon be better. In all of these effects there is no\r\nmanifestation of any physical or marvelous supernormal power, but\r\nsimply and solely of the influence of the mind on the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDETERRENT THERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\nIn the history of therapy a peculiar phase was the use of all sorts of\r\nmaterials, intensely repugnant to human nature and deterrent to all\r\nthe finer feelings, but which, nevertheless, proved curative of many\r\nills. We know now that there was absolutely nothing remedial in these\r\nsubstances or methods of treatment, but only the effect produced upon\r\nthe patient's mind. If the patient makes sufficient effort to overcome\r\nthe intense repugnance, that enables him to release hitherto latent\r\nvital energies, or to correct hampering inhibitions which have\r\nprevented curative reactions. The more the patient had to conquer\r\nhimself, or herself, the more surely did the remedy produce a good\r\neffect. It was effective, however, not only among the poor and the\r\nuneducated, but often also among the better informed, provided the\r\npatients became persuaded of its efficiency. Persuasion in these\r\nmatters is usually best secured by the reports of cured cases. It is\r\neasy to obtain \"cures\" from almost anything. They are set up as\r\nconfident proofs of the remedial virtue of methods of treatment. They\r\nhave been, in the history of medicine, more often the indexes of\r\naction upon mind than upon body. Real remedies help patients to get\r\nbetter. Supposed remedies, that afterwards prove quite inert, _cure_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPortions of Corpses.--One of the ingredients of the famous Unguentum\r\nArmarium (see chapter on Nostrums) was, as has been said, moss scraped\r\nfrom the skull of a man who had been hanged. It was declared to be\r\nparticularly efficacious against so-called dead members, such as the\r\nblanched fingers of Raynaud's disease, or the hysterical palsies, and\r\nother functional paralytic conditions of the limbs. The real\r\ntherapeutic factor was not the gruesome material itself, but the\r\npotent suggestions awakened by it. It is probable that the quacks and\r\nwitch doctors who gave out the formula of their remedies as containing\r\nsuch material often did not take the trouble to collect them, and that\r\ntheir salves and ointments were really quite inoffensive preparations.\r\n\r\n{64}\r\n\r\nTouch of the Hanged.--Some of the traditions which gather round the\r\neffect of contact with the body of a hanged person are curiously\r\ninteresting from the standpoint of psychotherapy. This form of\r\nexecution seems to have had a much more potent influence in producing\r\ntherapeutic elements in the bodies of the victims than any other. We\r\ndo not hear much of the touch of a beheaded person's body nor of any\r\nplace in medicine for portions of the victims of execution by\r\nshooting, though Van Helmont claims curative properties for these in\r\nlesser degree. All sorts of ailments were, however, supposed to be\r\ncured by the touch of a hanged person. Thomas Hardy in his \"Wessex\r\nTales\" tells of a young woman in his time suffering from a paralyzed\r\narm, apparently a form of paralysis due to a functional nervous\r\ncondition, who was recommended by an old \"conjure\" doctor to touch her\r\nbared arm, as soon after the execution as possible, to the purple mark\r\nof the rope around the neck of a man who had been hanged. The doctor\r\nassured her this was the only means by which she could be cured. We\r\nwould not be surprised to hear of her cure under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nHardy has carefully collected his material regarding the traditions of\r\nthe southern part of England, and he makes the hangman say, when the\r\nwoman applies to him for permission to touch the body of the victim,\r\nthat such a request had not been made for some years, but that there\r\nused to be many applicants when he was a younger man. He adds,\r\nmoreover, that it was the custom to apply to the governor of the\r\nprison and that usually this application was made by the physician of\r\nthe patient who accompanied him or her on the visit to the corpse.\r\nThere is no doubt that physicians did, in many cases, have recourse to\r\nsuch methods, and that the reasons for their belief in the efficacy of\r\nthe touch of the dead was that they had seen the cure in this way of\r\nmany puzzling diseased conditions, which their skill in wortcraft and\r\nherbal medicines had not enabled them to relieve. The touch of the\r\ncorpse was supposed to bring about a \"turning of the blood,\" and this\r\nproduced the good effects. Occasionally the patients fainted from\r\nterror, yet afterwards were found to be able to use limbs that had\r\nbeen quite beyond their control before. The story is typical of what\r\nhappened in country districts all over Europe for centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMummies.--How little distant we are from the use of such material for\r\ntherapeutic purposes will be appreciated from the fact that mummy was\r\nused in medicine down nearly to the end of the eighteenth century. The\r\nfirst edition of the \"Encyclopedia Brittanica\" (1768) said:\r\n\r\n  We have two different substances preserved for medicinal use under\r\n  the name of mummy, though both in some degree of the same origin.\r\n  The one is the dried and preserved flesh of human bodies, embalmed\r\n  with myrrh and spices; the other is the liquor running from such\r\n  mummies, when newly prepared, or when affected by great heat or\r\n  damps. The latter is sometimes in a liquid, sometimes of a solid\r\n  form, as it is preserved in vials well stopped, or suffered to dry\r\n  and harden in the air. The first kind of mummy is brought to us in\r\n  large pieces, of a lax and friable texture, light and spongy, of a\r\n  blackish brown color, and often damp and clammy on the surface: it\r\n  is of a strong but disagreeable smell. The second kind of mummy, in\r\n  its liquid state, is a thick, opaque, and viscous fluid, of a\r\n  blackish color, but not disagreeable smell. In its indurated state,\r\n  it is a dry solid substance, of a fine shining black color, and\r\n  close texture, easily broken, and of a good smell; very inflammable,\r\n  and yielding a scent of myrrh and aromatic ingredients while\r\n  burning. This, if we cannot be content without medicines from our own\r\n  bodies, ought\r\n{65}\r\n  to be the mummy used in the shops; but it is very scarce and dear;\r\n  while the other is so cheap, that it will always be most in use.\r\n\r\n  All these kinds of mummy are brought from Egypt. But we are not to\r\n  imagine, that anybody breaks up the real Egyptian mummies, to sell\r\n  them in pieces to the druggists, as they may make a much better\r\n  market of them in Europe whole, when they can contrive to get them.\r\n  What our druggists are supplied with, is the flesh of executed\r\n  criminals, or of any other bodies the Jews can get, who fill them\r\n  with the common bitumen so plentiful in that part of the world; and\r\n  adding a little aloes, and two or three other cheap ingredients,\r\n  send them to be baked in an oven, till the juices are exhaled, and\r\n  the embalming matter has penetrated so thoroughly that the flesh\r\n  will keep and bear transportation into Europe. Mummy has been\r\n  esteemed resolvent and balsamic: but whatever virtues have been\r\n  attributed to it, seem to be such as depend more upon the\r\n  ingredients used in preparing the flesh, than in the flesh itself;\r\n  and it would surely be better to give those ingredients without so\r\n  shocking an addition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpents in Therapeutics.--Snakes and portions of snakes have been\r\nprominent features of deterrent therapeutics at all times. Headaches\r\nwere cured by wrapping a dead snake around the head, or by the touch\r\nof a snake's skin, and sore throat by wearing a snake's skin around\r\nthe throat at night. This seems one degree better than the custom,\r\nstill common, of wrapping the stocking, that has been worn during the\r\nday, around the neck. In the chapter on Graves Disease, the use of the\r\ntouch of a snake, or of a snake's skin worn around the neck, is\r\nmentioned. Girdles made of snake's skin or snakes themselves, were\r\nsupposed to be good for colic and for various internal troubles, and\r\nwere sometimes, among barbarous peoples, a sovereign remedy for the\r\nills of pregnancy and assured the woman a safe delivery and an easy\r\nlabor. Undoubtedly they lessened dreads by suggestion and the effort\r\nnecessary to overcome repugnance. Some of the symptoms of the\r\nmenopause have been cured in the same way. Rattlesnake oil has had a\r\nspecial reputation among mountainous people, where the snakes\r\nabounded, for the pains and aches of the old, and the vague joint\r\ndiscomfort, sometimes spoken of as rheumatic, but really due to\r\nvarious individual conditions. It is probable that in most cases the\r\noil thus employed was not extracted from the rattlesnake, but was some\r\nordinary oil palmed off under that name, and having its special\r\neffectiveness because of the thought associated with it.\r\n\r\nVarious portions of serpents are still in use, sometimes in the hands\r\nof physicians, though usually in popular medicine. I knew a physician\r\nin a small inland city who had a great local reputation for curing\r\nexternal eye troubles, and who owed not a little of it to the fact\r\nthat the people in his neighborhood thought that he used rattlesnake\r\noil as one of the ingredients for his strongest prescriptions. He was\r\nsupposed to be able to dissolve even cataract by his remedies, and\r\nthere is no doubt that in many cases of chronic indolent ulcer of the\r\neye he was able to bring about a cure sooner, and have it last longer,\r\nthan those of the regular profession who had not the advantage of this\r\npopular faith. He was careful to buy rattlesnakes from certain of the\r\nmountain people, who killed and brought them to him and who advertised\r\nthe fact that they had such commissions from him. The stories were\r\nmade all the more interesting by the fact that the doctor would not\r\npurchase dead rattlesnakes. They must be brought to him alive, since\r\nthe therapeutic virtues can only be extracted immediately after death.\r\nA mountaineer with a couple of live rattlesnakes with him is always an\r\ninteresting object and a fine {66} advertisement. One would like to\r\nknow what the doctor did with the snakes--that is, how he disposed of\r\nthem without suspicion. Homeopathic physicians still have\r\nlachesis-viper venom in their pharmacopeia. Their remedies, however,\r\nif they really follow the dilution principle of their founder, can\r\nhave an effect only on the mind, so that the use of lachesis is not\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepugnant Remedial Measures.--Quite in keeping with the use of\r\ndeterrent remedies of various kinds are the recommendations to do\r\ncertain things that involve great self-control, and the overcoming of\r\nrepugnance, or fright, or the like. A favorite mode of preparing\r\nremedies in the Middle Ages was to gather the particular herbs for the\r\nprescription in a graveyard in the dark of the moon. The patient\r\nhimself was supposed to gather them and to be alone when doing so, if\r\nthey were to be effective. How much occupation of mind and diversion\r\nof thought would be afforded for timid people by the effort to\r\novercome themselves to this extent! The occupation of mind alone and\r\nthe concentration of thought necessary for the ordeal would be quite\r\nsufficient to divert many people from the centralization of attention\r\non themselves, which is responsible for so many of their symptoms, or\r\nfor that exaggeration of symptoms that aggravates the ailment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ordures as Remedies_.--Among all primitive peoples we have the story\r\nof the use, as remedies, of ordures of various kinds, of repugnant\r\nportions of animals, of ground insects, of animal excrement and urine,\r\nand even of human excretions, of the blood of serpents, or eels, or\r\ncarrion feeding birds, and the like. Ground lice and insects of\r\nvarious kinds are very common as prescriptions in the history of\r\nprimitive medicine. They turn up here and there through the Middle\r\nAges, and they are said to be still used in China. The more one knows\r\nabout side-tracks in medicine, the more does one find of far-fetched\r\nrepugnant materials vaunted as wonderful cures. Some of the substances\r\nemployed are so disgusting that one does not care to mention, much\r\nless discuss, them. I have had a man tell me that, in a severe\r\nepidemic of diphtheria, he saved his children's lives when they were\r\nattacked by the disease, and the children of others were dying all\r\naround him, by blowing the dried excrement of dog down their throats.\r\n\r\nThere are certain popular medical practices that are related to these\r\nold traditions of deterrent therapeutics. In many manufacturing\r\nestablishments, in spite of progress with regard to sepsis and\r\nantisepsis and the diffusion of information as to first aid to the\r\ninjured, it is still the custom to put spittle on wounds. I am sure\r\nthat every doctor has seen quids of tobacco used in this way. Even\r\nnative-born Americans, who are not illiterate, are sometimes found\r\nusing some deterrent material. I have known such a man use his own\r\nurine as an eye-wash for sore eyes, and the use of children's urine\r\nfor such purposes is much commoner than might be thought. After all,\r\nit is only a generation since physicians used to taste urine in order\r\nto determine whether it contained sugar or not, and I have seen a\r\ncountry doctor even take between his finger and his thumb a little of\r\nthe excrement of a child and apply his tongue to it, pretending of\r\ncourse that he obtained very valuable information this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Excretions and Secretions_.--All the human excretions have formed the\r\nbasis of vaunted remedies. Tears, on the principle that like cures\r\nlike, were used for melancholia; nasal secretion to lessen respiratory\r\ndifficulty through {67} the nose; sputum for various mouth affections,\r\nbut also as an application to external abrasions, and to the eyes, the\r\nears, and the like. Undoubtedly patients were helped by many of these,\r\nnot because of any physical effect, but because they felt easier as a\r\nconsequence of the satisfaction of having something done for them, and\r\nthe consequent freedom from solicitude which allowed nature to produce\r\nher curative reaction without interference. The greater the effort he\r\nhas to make, apparently the more efficiently does he control this\r\ndisturbing state of mind. This is the secret of many cures now as well\r\nas in the olden time.\r\n\r\nWhatever good effect is produced in such cases comes, of course, from\r\nthe persuasion that these substances will do good, and there must be a\r\nstrong suggestion to that effect before the repugnance can be\r\novercome. While we are prone to think the older peoples who used such\r\nmaterials commonly are to be condemned for ignorance and superstition,\r\nit is well to recall that human nature has not changed, and is still\r\nready to be influenced in the same way. Brown Sequard's extract of\r\ntesticular substance came in this category. We had a wave of\r\norganotherapy a few years ago, and we know now that whatever benefits\r\npatients derived from taking heart substance for heart troubles, and\r\nbrain substance for brain troubles, and kidney for renal diseases, was\r\nentirely due to mental influence. The cannibal who eats the heart of\r\nhis enemy, thinking that the vigor and courage of the other will pass\r\ninto him, undoubtedly has for a time a power of accomplishment greater\r\nthan before. Nothing acts so powerfully as suggestion of this kind to\r\ngive renewed vigor and to enable us to tap sources of energy that we\r\nwere not aware of in ourselves, and that enable us to accomplish what\r\nbefore seemed quite impossible, and even to bring about curative\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases Benefited.--Observe the classes of disease that were\r\nparticularly relieved by deterrent therapeutics. Headache was one of\r\nthese. All sorts of things were cures for headaches--the touch of the\r\nhangman's rope, or of an executed criminal, or some herb gathered in\r\nthe graveyard in the dark of the moon, or pills made of the excrement\r\nof various animals. The forms of headache thus relieved would be those\r\nin which over-attention to self, rather than real headache, produced\r\nqueer feelings in the head, though concentration of attention might\r\nexaggerate this into an ache. Foot troubles were cured by deterrent\r\ntherapeutics. To wear the shoes of a dead person, especially of a\r\nmurderer who had been hanged, would cure them. Colic was cured by\r\npills of excrementitious materials, and by all sorts of other\r\ndeterrent remedies. For instance, one well-known remedy was to wash\r\nthe feet and drink the wash-water. The wash-water of little babies was\r\na favorite remedy for the vague abdominal pains of old maids, and for\r\nthe symptoms due to the menopause.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeterrent Pain.--A striking illustration of a strong mental influence\r\nhelping out a slight amount of therapeutic efficiency is found in the\r\nuse of the actual cautery for medical affections. At a number of times\r\nin history most of the chronic pains and aches, the arthritises, the\r\nso-called gouty tendencies when localized, the rheumatic affections\r\nand especially the chronic rheumatisms, have been treated by means of\r\nthe cautery. All of the neuralgias, many of the neuroses, all of the\r\nneuritises and a certain number of so-called palsies and paralyses,\r\nwere treated successfully by this means. It is a very suggestive\r\nremedy producing a deep impression that now relief must be in sight.\r\nIt {68} became popular over and over again, though after a time it\r\nalways lost its influence, and ceased to have the beneficial effects\r\nthat it had at the beginning of its reintroduction.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the eighteenth and the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century the cautery became very popular. It was applied\r\nparticularly in the form of the moxa. A cylinder of cotton was\r\nemployed for this purpose, being set on fire and allowed to burn on\r\nthe skin of the patient, producing a deep wound. The mental effect of\r\nthis can be readily understood. Baron Larrey, one of the most eminent\r\nsurgeons of the time, thought the moxa one of the best aids that he\r\nhad in the treatment of many affections where the knife was not\r\nindicated. There were large groups of diseases in which it was almost\r\na specific. Larrey employed it in affections of vision, of smell, of\r\ntaste, of hearing and of speech. In many paralytic affections of the\r\nmuscular system, in all chronic affections of the head, among which he\r\nenumerates non-traumatic affections, hydrocephalus, chronic headaches\r\nand many other affections supposed to be seated in the cranium. In\r\nasthma he was particularly successful with the moxa. Old catarrhal\r\naffections yielded to it. Consumption was frequently benefited by it.\r\nMost of the chronic affections of the uterus were benefited, as were\r\nalso similar affections of the stomach. He considered that the moxa\r\nmust be admitted, without contradiction, to be the remedy _par\r\nexcellence_ against rachitis. In Pott's disease, which he called\r\ndorsal consumption, it worked wonders. In sacrocoxalgia, in\r\ncocygodynia and femero-coxalgia he had excellent results with the\r\nmoxa.\r\n\r\nA glance at this list shows exactly the class of cases in which\r\nsuggestion has always played a large role, and for which there has\r\nbeen, at various times, a series of specific remedies, medicinal,\r\nmanipulative and surgical. Others extended the value of the moxa\r\nbeyond these affections. Ponto found it valuable in gout, and in the\r\nvarious chronic affections which are sometimes grouped under the name\r\nchronic rheumatism. He insisted that the moxa could be placed on\r\nalmost any part of the body, though the contra indications he suggests\r\nshow how far the men of his time went with its use. Only these\r\nportions named might not have a moxa applied to them. It must not be\r\nused on the skull, on the eyelids, on the ears, on the mamme, on the\r\nlarynx and on the genitals, though it might be applied to the perineum\r\nor the perineal body.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeterrent Taste and Smell.--The disturbing effects produced by other\r\nsenses besides those of sight have been used in the same way for the\r\nproduction of definite therapeutic suggestive effects. A number of the\r\nill-tasting, almost nauseating drugs of the olden time prove to have\r\nvery little real therapeutic efficiency in the light of modern\r\nclinical careful observation. This is particularly true of the herbs\r\nand simples. Many a disgusting preparation apparently owed all of its'\r\ngood effects on the patient to the effort that was required to swallow\r\nit, producing such a favorable influence upon the mind, by\r\n_contrecoup_ as it were, that the patient got better. A little girl\r\nsaid that cough medicines were nasty things they gave you in order to\r\nkeep you from catching cold again. The sense of smell has been used in\r\nthe same way. Valerian is probably an efficient drug in certain\r\nrespects, but undoubtedly its efficiency is materially increased by\r\nits intensely repulsive odor. For many of the psycho-neuroses and\r\nneurotic conditions generally the ammonium valerianate is likely to be\r\nmuch more efficient than the strychnin valerianate, though probably\r\nthe {69} latter should be considered as more physically efficacious in\r\nits tonic properties. Asafetida, musk and some preparations of the\r\ngenital organs of animals that used to be in the pharmacopeia, owed\r\nmost, if not all, of their power, whatever it was, to the mental\r\neffect of their odor and the feeling of deterrence that had to be\r\novercome before they were taken.\r\n\r\nThere is a precious therapeutic secret in this use of deterrent,\r\nrepugnant, frightful materials which patients use to advantage under\r\ncertain circumstances. It illustrates the influence of the mind over\r\nthe body, and emphasizes the fact that such influence can be exerted\r\nin the full only when a deep impression is produced upon the patient.\r\nWhether this can be imitated without deceit, and without the use of\r\nundignified methods, must depend on the physician himself and his\r\npersonality. There can be no doubt that there is a wonderful power\r\nhere to be employed. It must be the physician's business to find out\r\nin each individual case, according to his own personal equation, just\r\nhow he may be able to use at least some of it. It is well worth\r\nstudying and striving for, because nothing is more potent for\r\npsychoneurotic conditions, and for neuroses on the borderland of the\r\nphysical, than which no ailments are more obstinate to treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE PERSONALITY IN THERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\nThough it has seldom been fully realized and has probably never been\r\nappreciated as in our time, one of the most important factors in\r\ntherapeutics, in every period of the history of medicine, has been the\r\npersonal influence of the physician. Therapeutic fashions have come\r\nand gone, new drugs have been introduced, have had their day and then\r\nbeen relegated to the limbo of worn-out ideas. At all times, however,\r\nphysicians have succeeded in doing good, or at least using, with\r\napparent success, the therapeutic means of their own time, however\r\ncrude and inadequate these afterwards proved to be. They have\r\nsucceeded in shortening the progress of disease as well as increasing\r\nthe patient's resistive vitality and thus enabled him not infrequently\r\nto survive where otherwise a fatal termination might have occurred.\r\nAll unsuspected during most of the time, it was the personal influence\r\nof the physician that counted for most in all of the historical\r\nvicissitudes of therapeusis. It mattered not that the means he\r\nemployed might seem absurd to the second succeeding generation, as was\r\nso often, indeed almost invariably, the case, his personal influence\r\nhas at all times overshadowed his available therapeutic auxiliaries.\r\nIn spite of all our advance in scientific medicine, to a considerable\r\ndegree this remains true even at the present time, and to fail\r\nproperly to use this important auxiliary is to cripple medical\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace of Personal Influence.--When the antitoxins and directly\r\ncurative serums seemed about to make for themselves a place in\r\ntherapeusis, it looked for a time as though this personal element\r\nmight be entirely superseded. It seemed that all other therapeutic\r\nfactors must give way to definitely accurate doses of antitoxic\r\nprinciples, directly opposed to the toxins of disease and {70} capable\r\nof conquering it. With the success of diphtheria serum, the prospects\r\nfor scientific therapeutics from the biological standpoint became very\r\npromising. Unfortunately, our further experience with antitoxins and\r\ntherapeutic sera of various kinds has not been satisfactory, and now\r\nthe medical world is looking elsewhere for progress in therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThis throws us back once more on the old-time therapeutics, and we\r\nhave to learn to use all their elements. One of the most important of\r\nthese, if not, as we have suggested, absolutely the most important,\r\nthe one that in all the many variations of therapeusis has maintained\r\nitself, is the personal influence of the physician by which he is able\r\nto soothe the patient's fears, allay his anxieties, make him face the\r\nsituation calmly so that he may not use up any of his vital force in\r\nuseless worry, but on the contrary employ all his available psychic\r\nenergy in helping nature to overcome whatever disturbance there is\r\nwithin the organism. This personal influence was for several centuries\r\nspoken of as personal magnetism, not merely in the figurative sense in\r\nwhich we now employ that term, but in a literal sense. The implication\r\nwas that some men possessed within themselves a reservoir of\r\nsuperfluous energy, vital in character, but thought to be related to\r\nthe force exhibited by the magnet, when it attracted bodies to itself,\r\nand made metals for a time magnetic like itself, and which actually\r\npassed over from the physician to his patient. We have gotten away\r\nfrom the idea of any physical force flowing from physician to patient,\r\nbut we know very well that certain physicians are much more capable\r\nthan others of arousing the vital energies of the patient, sometimes\r\nto the extent of making him feel, after treatment, that he has more\r\nforce than before. The patient feels that something must have been\r\nadded to his natural powers, though he has only been brought into a\r\nstate of mind where he can better use his own powers.\r\n\r\nIt is the men whose presence created this impression in patients, an\r\nimpression that is justified by the fact that somehow he enabled them\r\nto vitalize themselves better than before, who have been most\r\nsuccessful in the treatment of patients. In all ages the men of\r\nreputation for healing have had this. A careful study of their lives\r\nshows that this counted for more in many of the experiences of their\r\nhealing than the drugs and remedies which they employed. The men who\r\nhave been the most sought by patients have not as a rule left us great\r\ntherapeutic secrets; on the contrary, they have only employed the\r\nconventional remedies of their times with reasonable common-sense and\r\nhave added to them their own personal influences. On the other hand,\r\nthe men who have made discoveries in therapeutics, and in medicine,\r\nhave not always been popular as physicians. They have known too much\r\nof their own lack of knowledge to be quite confident in their use of\r\nremedies, and this has hurt something of their personal influence over\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIVE PERSONALITY\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is easy to comprehend, even from the\r\ncomparatively scanty details that we have of habits and methods of the\r\ngreat physicians, that their effect upon their patients was always\r\nlargely a matter of impressive personality. Any one who, from a\r\npharmaceutical standpoint, knows how {71} inefficient were many of the\r\nremedies that great physicians depended on, yet how effective they\r\nseemed to be to their patients, and even to themselves, will\r\nappreciate the factor of personal magnetism that entered into their\r\nemployment. It is not alone in the olden time that great physicians\r\nhave been almost worshiped. For their patients they have at all times\r\nbeen men of exalted knowledge, masters of secrets and comforters of\r\nthe afflicted, just as was the first great physician of whom we have\r\nany account, I-em-Hetep, in Egypt nearly six thousand years ago. Such\r\nmen as Hippocrates, as Galen, as Sydenham and Boerhaave, and Van\r\nSwieten, accomplished curative results far beyond the therapeutics of\r\ntheir time. The loving admiration of patients and of their disciples\r\nshows how strong were their personalities and gives us, almost better\r\nthan the writings they have left to us, the secret of their successes\r\nas practitioners of medicine.\r\n\r\nA Great Modern Physician's Influence.--It is interesting to study in\r\nthe lives of great physicians the details which illustrate their\r\npersonal influence, their consciousness of it and how deliberately\r\nthey used it. A typical example very close to us, whose reputation was\r\nstill fresh while I was at the University of Paris, was Professor\r\nCharcot. He had made great discoveries in nervous pathology. To a\r\ngreat extent he had revolutionized our knowledge of nervous diseases\r\nand added many new chapters to this rather obscure department of\r\nmedicine. Far from making the treatment of nervous diseases easier\r\nthan before, or giving more assurance to the physician who dealt with\r\nthem, his discoveries, however, had just the opposite effect. His work\r\nemphasized that practically all of the so-called nervous diseases were\r\ndue to degenerations in the central nervous system, which no medicine\r\ncould be expected to relieve in any way, and which nothing short of\r\nthe impossible re-creation of damaged parts could ever cure. His\r\nstudies included organic degenerations of other organs, and in his\r\ntreatise on \"Diseases of the Old\" it is made clear that many of the\r\nsymptoms of old age are due to organic lesions for which no cure can\r\never be expected. This would seem to discourage treatment, yet somehow\r\nCharcot became a great practicing physician as well as a medical\r\nscientist and pathologist.\r\n\r\nHis success was due to his personal influence over his patients. In\r\nspite of the unfavorable prognosis that he had to give in so many\r\ncases, he was able by suggestion to help many patients with regard to\r\ntheir course of life, and to reassure them, so that many adventitious\r\nneurotic symptoms not due to their underlying nervous disease, but to\r\ntheir solicitude about themselves, disappeared. Very few people who\r\ncame to him went away without feeling that his advice had been very\r\nvaluable to them and without experiencing, as a rule, after they had\r\nfollowed his advice, that they were much better than they had been\r\nbefore. It was for the neurotic conditions associated with nervous\r\naffections that Charcot's personal influence over patients was of the\r\ngreatest therapeutic significance.\r\n\r\nHe himself recognized this and did not hesitate to use it to its\r\nfullest extent. Towards the end of his life, the method by which his\r\npatients were presented to him was calculated to make their relation\r\nto him, above all, a very personal one, and to give his influence the\r\nfullest weight. Nervous patients who came to see him, were each in his\r\nturn invited from the general waiting-room into a small ante-room just\r\noutside of Charcot's office and {72} there, in silence and dim light,\r\nasked to await the summons of the physician himself. When the time\r\ncame for him to call them in, the folding doors between the rooms\r\nopened and he stood in a blaze of light inviting them to enter. Many a\r\nneurotic patient despairing of relief for symptoms that had lasted\r\nlong in spite of the treatment of many other physicians, felt at once\r\nthat here, in this kindly, gentle-voiced man standing so prominently\r\nin the light, was surely the long looked-for physician who would heal\r\nwhatever ills there were. They came fully impressed with his power to\r\nheal, and all the valuable influence of auto-suggestion was enlisted\r\non the side of their physician.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in the regular practice of medicine can be seen much more\r\nclearly in the history of those who were not physicians, but who,\r\nnevertheless, by personal magnetism, succeeded in curing various ills,\r\nor at least in lifting up patients so that they used their own natural\r\npowers of recovery to much better advantage than would have been\r\npossible if left unaided.\r\n\r\nEvery successful healer has had this same personal influence, personal\r\nmagnetism, call it what we will, which his patients have thought\r\nhelpful to them through some direct communication, but which he\r\nhimself, if he seriously studied it, and which every other thorough\r\nstudent of the question must realize, was due only to his power to\r\ncall out the latent vitality of his patients. The mystery is not one\r\nof teledynamics, a transfer of energy from the operator, but one of\r\nawakening dormant faculties in the subject. Just why they should be\r\ndormant, since the patient so much wants to use them if he only could,\r\nis hard to understand. They do, however, lie dormant until the call of\r\nanother strong personality wakens them to activity. Many people are so\r\nconstituted that they cannot do effective work except under the\r\ndirection of others. They lack initiative, though they may fill\r\nsecondary places very well, indeed, much better often than the man of\r\ninitiative who so frequently lacks capacity for details. In the same\r\nway many people are not able to bring out to the full all their own\r\nenergies, even for their own bodily needs, unless under the guidance\r\nand influence of others; hence the stories of the healers that we have\r\nall down the centuries, and who have a definite place in the history\r\nof humanity and of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Modern Healer.--A typical instance of the really marvelous power of\r\nmental influence over the minds of sufferers from many kinds of ills,\r\nis found in the career of the well-known Father Kneipp. For more than\r\ntwenty-five years he had attracted the attention of Europe, and had\r\nmade the little town of Woerishofen well known all over the world\r\nbecause of the cures effected there by him. The exactly proper phrase\r\nis effected _by him_ because it is clear to anyone who has studied the\r\ntherapeutic methods he employed, that it was not these, or at least\r\nnot these alone, that enabled him to cure so many ailments which had\r\nresisted the efforts of some of the best physicians in Europe. It was\r\nhis magnetic personality which won patients to the persuasion that\r\nthey must get better because he said so, and then to the following out\r\nof certain very simple natural rules of life, and certain quite as\r\nsimple remedial measures, which acted as alteratives and enabled\r\npatients to tap reservoirs of vitality, of which they themselves were\r\nunconscious, but which, supplying energies to overcome tendencies to\r\nvarious symptomatic conditions, brought about cures.\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\nPfarrer Kneipp had himself suffered from consumption, had been\r\npractically given up and then, as is the case of many another, had\r\ntaken himself in hand, had secured much more outdoor air than before,\r\nand more abundant nutrition, until gradually his ailment was overcome.\r\nIt is true that he used various hydrotherapeutic measures, some of\r\nthem, as he confessed afterwards, to an excess, both as regards the\r\ntemperature of water and the length of the application of it, that\r\nmight have seriously hurt him if he had been less robust, but it was\r\nnot so much his hydrotherapy as his own determination to get better\r\nand to live a little closer to nature that led to his cure. Then he\r\nbecame the apostle of cold water and of many natural remedial\r\nmeasures, and as a consequence, healer of all forms of ills in the\r\nmany thousands who flocked to consult him in the little South German\r\ntown. He made his patients get up early in the morning, get out in the\r\nair shortly after rising, the excuse, or, as he declared it, the\r\nreason being that they were to walk with bare feet in the dewy grass.\r\nAfter this he had them eat heartily of simple food, of such variety\r\nand in such quantity as relieved them of constipation, made them use\r\nwater, internally and externally, in abundance, and after a time, sent\r\nmost of them on their way rejoicing that they had been cured from\r\nchronic ills.\r\n\r\nSome of the highest in Europe came to him; the Empress of Austria was\r\nhis patient, and he was asked to prescribe for the Pope; reigning\r\nprinces and all the lesser order of the nobility were included among\r\nhis patients. Several of the Rothschild family went to him and where\r\nthey went, of course, others flocked. Very few failed to be benefited.\r\nPeople less educated, and less rich in the world's goods than these,\r\ncame also, and went away relieved. After a time Kneipp societies were\r\nfounded all over Europe and even spread through America. These\r\nconsisted of organizations of men and women who encouraged each other\r\nto keep up the Kneipp practices. With his death there has come a\r\ndecline in interest in Kneipp methods. He, himself, was sure that his\r\nremedies and recommendations were the important curative factors. Now\r\nit has become clear that it was mainly his forceful personality, his\r\npower to lift patients above their ills, and enable them to use mental\r\nresources or vital forces that they could not use until encouraged by\r\nhim with the thought that they would surely get better. In the\r\natmosphere he thus created, they seemed to borrow something of his\r\novermastering personality. It can not be too often repeated that this\r\nis the secret of the success of the great world healers. They do not\r\ntransfer force to others, but they enable others to use their _own_\r\nforces more successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ancient Healer.--Let us compare some of the details of the career\r\nof Father Kneipp with the story we have of one Aristides, who, as the\r\nresult of dreams that came to him while practicing the cult of\r\nAEsculapius and the injunctions contained in these dreams, was cured\r\nof many ills, and afterward delivered a series of sacred orations.\r\nAristides is one of the first of the large group of literary men, much\r\ninterested in their own health and their own ills, whose writings have\r\nbeen preserved for us. He was intensely proud of the number and\r\nvariety of his ills, and he was perhaps conceited about the curious\r\nways in which some of them had been cured. Traveling in the winter\r\ntime he caught a chill; then he suffered from earache and in the midst\r\nof a storm developed fever, asthma and toothache. Arrived in Rome, he\r\nhad severe internal sufferings, shivering fits and want of breath.\r\nTreatment by the Roman {74} doctor only aggravated his sufferings. A\r\nstormy voyage home made him worse. When, at last, he arrived in\r\nSmyrna, the doctors gathered round him, and were astonished at the\r\nmanifold nature of the disease. They could do nothing for him.\r\n\r\nSuffering from all these ills (which remind one of a modern literary\r\nman who has got his mind on his stomach and his body on his mind),\r\nAristides went to a number of the old temple hospitals and received\r\nsuggestions in sleep from AEsculapius. These he has described in what\r\nare called his sacred orations. In them we have every phase of modern\r\ntherapy that has the strong element of suggestion in it. Like Pfarrer\r\nKneipp, he tried very cold baths and was benefited by them. Walking in\r\nthe dewy grass in his bare feet was another recommendation that had\r\ncome to him in a dream. Occasionally he would run rapidly for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and then when heated plunge into a cold bath.\r\nWe have many complaints of his fever and stomach troubles. Mud-baths\r\nwere also recommended to him and, of course, tried with benefit for a\r\ntime. Sand baths later proved to be beneficial. For rheumatism a cold\r\nbath, after running almost naked in the cold north wind, proved\r\nsuccessful when other remedies failed. Aristides wrote out his\r\nexperiences, and his writings had great influence over generations of\r\npatients and maintained the influence of the old Greek temples as cure\r\nhouses long after the general acceptance of Christianity. As the\r\nresult of his writings, no matter how bizarre a dream might be, some\r\ninterpretation of a therapeutic nature was found from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstancy of the Law of Personal Influence.--Indeed, there has\r\napparently never been a time when some strong character, full of\r\nreligious enthusiasm and of high purpose, strong in the confidence of\r\nmen, has not succeeded in accomplishing wonderful curative results by\r\nthe reassurance that comes from a renewal of faith in the goodness of\r\nProvidence. There are, for instance, a number of stories which show\r\nJohn Wesley's power to help men to tap the reservoir of surplus energy\r\nthat all of us have within us, but that somehow we do not succeed in\r\nmaking use of, unless some strong mental influence is brought to bear\r\non us. Practically every religious man who has had the love and the\r\nveneration and the respect of those around him has succeeded in\r\naccomplishing the cures that many people in recent years have been\r\nprone to regard as rather novel phenomena in the history of\r\npsychology. Men like St. Philip Neri, St. Francis Xavier, and St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi, and St. Bernard, have many stories told of them\r\nwhich show how much they were able to help fellow mortals by enabling\r\nthem to make use, even in a physical way, of their own highest and\r\nbest powers. Their lives show how much more they did.\r\n\r\nNor is this power confined to men. In nearly every century we have the\r\nstory, also, of wonderfully strong women, leaders of their time, who\r\ninspired the profound confidence and veneration of those around them,\r\nand who were enabled, by their own strength of character, to help\r\npeople physically as well as morally. The Life of St. Catherine of\r\nSiena is full of such instances. She spent her life mainly in caring\r\nfor the sick and the distressed at the hospital in Siena, and the\r\nbeautiful hospital there was completed largely as a monument to her.\r\nDuring her lifetime marvelous cures occurred that in many cases were\r\nevidently due to her power over the minds of people. The {75} life of\r\nSt. Teresa has a number of similar examples, and Joan of Arc, in her\r\nlifetime, lifted many a dispirited man into vigorous strength because\r\nof her own abounding personality and the physical reaction which\r\ncontact with her enthusiasm brought.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern Examples.--Nor did such occurrences come only in older and less\r\nsophisticated centuries than ours. John Wesley is close enough to our\r\ntime to negative any such impression, but there are many other\r\nexamples. There is Pastor Gassner, whose cures remind Prof.\r\nMuensterberg of the Emanuel movement at the present time, but there are\r\nalso a number of strong, religious characters whose influence was\r\nexercised in the alleviation of physical ills during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The name of Father Matthew, the Irish \"Apostle of\r\nTemperance,\" as he was called, is mainly connected with wonderful\r\ncures of the worst forms of alcoholic addiction. Physicians know how\r\ndifficult such cases are to cure, yet there are many thousands of what\r\nwere apparently hopeless cases to Father Matthew's credit. It may be\r\nremarked that this is one of the ills that modern mental treatment\r\nclaims most success with. Besides these morbid habits there are,\r\nhowever, other cases, told in detail, in which Father Matthew's\r\ninfluence enabled people to shake off headaches, to get rid of\r\nillusions, to overcome hysteria, and even to relieve other and much\r\nmore physical affections. Animal magnetism was the subject of much\r\nthought in his lifetime (nineteenth century), so that it is not\r\nsurprising that Mr. John Francis McGuire, a member of the English\r\nParliament, who wrote Father Matthew's life in 1864, declared that\r\n\"Father Matthew possessed in a large degree the power of animal\r\nmagnetism, and great relief was afforded by him to people suffering\r\nfrom various affections; and in some cases I was satisfied that\r\npermanent good was effected by his administrations.\"\r\n\r\nAnother strong man of this same kind was Prince Alexander of\r\nHohenlohe. Though a prince he had become a clergyman and spent his\r\nlife in the service of the poor. Shortly after he became a priest he\r\nwent through a great epidemic, fearlessly caring for his poor people,\r\nand as a consequence inspired them with so much confidence that ever\r\nafter they came to him with all their ills. He was able to help, not\r\nonly the poor, but also many of the nobility. Some of the things\r\nreported as accomplished through his influence show extraordinary\r\npower. His usual method was to endeavor to inspire in the people who\r\ncame to him a faith in their cure, and then after a time the cure was\r\nactually accomplished.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent troubles in Russia, attention was called to the fact\r\nthat the famous Father John of Cronstadt, the hero of Bloody Sunday,\r\nwas looked up to with so much respect and veneration that many people\r\nfound themselves helped physically by contact with him. There are a\r\nnumber of interesting stories of cures of ills of various kinds, some\r\nof them exclusively mental, but many of them fundamentally physical,\r\nwhich took place as a consequence of the new spirit of hope infused\r\ninto people because of their confidence in Father John. His subsequent\r\nhistory seems to indicate that this was evidently due to the forceful\r\npersonality of the man rather than to any special religious influence.\r\nHis influence was not limited to the ignorant masses in Russia, for\r\nsome of the cures reported occurred in families of the better class,\r\nthoroughly capable of judging the character of the man apart from his\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS IN HEALING\r\n\r\nWe have any number of examples, then, of this power of the healer in\r\nhistory. Over and over again we find that it was the personality of\r\nthe man and the suggestive value of the means that he employed that\r\nenabled patients to cure themselves, that is, to use all the vital\r\nforce which they had for curative purposes. This force had hitherto\r\nbeen inhibited by their own doubts of themselves and their doubts of\r\nthe value of all ordinary means of cure which had been previously\r\nemployed in their cases. This is the secret of the success of the\r\nhealer, and this secret is much more valuable for therapeusis than any\r\nremedy which has come down to us from the olden time. It has,\r\nunfortunately, been neglected, and thus an important benefit to\r\nhumanity has been lost. Now that we are able to review frankly and\r\ndeliberately the conditions that obtained in the past, it is time to\r\nset about making use of this oldest secret in medicine, now no longer\r\na secret, as a strong factor in the treatment not of disease but of\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nHealers are at all times strong characters who are helpful to others\r\nbecause of their own superabundant strength. The world is made up of\r\ntwo classes of people, lifters and leaners, and the leaners constitute\r\nby far the larger class. Most men and women are the subjects of doubts\r\nand dreads and difficulties with regard to their health, and the more\r\ntime they have for introspection, the more are they likely to suffer.\r\nUnable to overcome them by themselves, they need the help of others.\r\nWhat they need, above all, is the reassurance that a trained strong\r\nmind can give them. The exercise of this mental influence over them,\r\nis only what corresponds to leadership in all the affairs of life.\r\nMost people need to be led and to be guided. The place of the\r\nphysician is that of guide and director. The family physician of the\r\nolden time had a precious amount of influence that accrued to him from\r\nhis character, and it was used to magnificent purpose. Most of his\r\ndrug treatment would be looked upon as quite absurd at the present\r\ntime, yet he did a great good work by lifting people up to their own\r\nhighest possibilities of resistive vitality. That means more for the\r\nconquest of disease, even now, in most cases, than any remedies we\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nOften men do not realize how much their personal influence counts for.\r\nThey think it is their method of treatment, or some new discovery in\r\ndrugs or remedial measures, or some new phase of psychology they have\r\nhit upon, that is producing results. This makes it difficult to\r\ndetermine, in given cases, just what are the actual influences at\r\nwork. Many men supposing themselves to be discoverers of some novel\r\nforce, are merely exploiting that old-time influence of one mind over\r\nanother that can be observed all down the centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to study the careers of men who thought they were\r\nemploying on their patients some new psychological method, when all\r\nthey were exploiting was the old-fashioned influence of suggestion\r\nfrom a stronger personality to a weaker. A dozen times in history\r\nhypnotism has been announced as a wonderful curative agent. At present\r\nno one thinks it so, but, on the contrary, if used frequently, we\r\nthink that it is much more likely to do harm than good. We went\r\nthrough a phase of interest in hypnotism a quarter of {77} a century\r\nago and there are now signs of the possibility of its return in\r\nanother form. In recent years we have heard much of psycho-analysis,\r\nof dominant ideas, of the auto-suggestion that comes from this, and\r\nhow much benefit can be conferred on the patient by removing such\r\nideas or revealing their unfavorable influence and so neutralizing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe patients that come for treatment and to whom psychotherapy is of\r\nspecial benefit, are not, as a rule, those suffering from acute\r\ndiseases or injuries, though even in these cases the attitude of mind\r\nis always an important therapeutic factor. The patients are mainly\r\nthose suffering from chronic ailments, and from minor affections\r\nwhich, while they do not confine them to bed, often prove the source\r\nof such serious disturbance as makes them very miserable. The\r\nsuffering in the world is out of all proportion to the actual disease.\r\nMany people who have little disease suffer a great deal, partly from\r\nover-sensitiveness, partly from concentration of mind on their\r\nailments, and partly from such ignorance of whatever pathological\r\ncondition is present that they grow discouraged and morbid over it.\r\nThe role of psychotherapy is particularly to help patients of this\r\nkind. This does not mean that its main purpose is to treat imaginary\r\ndisease, or disease which exists only in the mind of patients, for in\r\nnearly all of these cases there is a definite physical element in the\r\naffection. Even where the disease is quite imaginary, though that term\r\nhas been so sadly abused that it is perhaps better to speak of\r\naffections as purely mental in origin, psychotherapy is important. As\r\nhas been well said, a patient not having something physical the matter\r\nwho thinks that there is something the matter, is in a worse state\r\nthan one who really has something the matter. There are a great many\r\nsuch cases. If the principles of psychotherapy can relieve them and\r\ncure many of them, then it has a large place in human life.\r\n\r\nIn order that the individual patient may be benefited, a thorough\r\nunderstanding must be established between physician and patient. This\r\nmust take on the character of a personal relationship. The patient\r\nmust feel that the physician has a personal interest in him--that\r\nthere are certain individual features in his ailment which make his\r\ncase mean something much more than ordinary to his physician. Some\r\nphysicians have the power to make their patients feel this personal\r\nrelationship to a marked degree. They are the eminently successful\r\npractitioners of medicine. Their patients sound their praises, and\r\neven though they may not be distinguished scientists, they acquire a\r\nlarge practice. Some of them are thoroughly scientific men. All of us\r\nknow them and, while we may not be able to understand just how it is\r\ndone, we recognize their power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFAITH CURES\r\n\r\nThe series of phenomena that may be grouped under the term \"faith\r\ncures\" represent the oldest, the most frequent, universal, and\r\nconstantly recurring examples of the influence of the mind over the\r\nbody for the healing of ills. Whenever men have believed deeply and\r\nwith conviction that some other being {78} was able to help them, many\r\nof their ills, or at least the conditions from which they suffered\r\nseverely, have dropped from them and their complaints, real or\r\nimaginary have disappeared. This was true whether it was the touch of\r\nanother human being supposed to have some wonderful power that was the\r\nagent, or some persuasion of the interference of the supernatural that\r\nappealed to them. Religions of all kinds have always had their cures,\r\nand one of the main reasons why men have accepted the various\r\nreligions has nearly always been because of the weight of these\r\nhealing phenomena. Apparently it does not matter how debased the form\r\nof religion may be, whether it is exercised by the medicine man of a\r\nsavage tribe with methods that appeal only to barbarous instincts, or\r\nby a highly cultured priest of a form of religion appealing to the\r\nloftiest feeling and the profoundest intellectuality, cures take place\r\nwhenever devotees have complete and absolute faith in the possibility\r\nof divine or supernatural interference in their behalf. The very\r\nearliest history that we have tells us of such cures, and the daily\r\npapers bring us reports of them from all quarters among the high and\r\nthe low, the educated and the uneducated.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is universal and we come logically to the belief that\r\nthe Supreme Being intended that confidence in Him, and above all\r\nrecognition of the fact that somehow the world with all its ills has a\r\nmeaning for good, should be rewarded. The argument that religion is a\r\nnatural revelation should then apparently be extended to include also\r\nthe thought of a healing power in connection with it. Many of the\r\nfounders of religions that have meant much for uplift to mankind, have\r\nmade healing a principal portion of their message to man--the proof of\r\ntheir missions. Indeed, there actually seems to be an extension of\r\npower, above what is natural, to those who in profound confidence in\r\nDivinity, turn to this source of strength for relief from the ills\r\nthat flesh is heir to. In any of these cases, definite inquiry as to\r\nthe significance of the particular incident is needed, and not any\r\ngeneral principle of either acceptance or rejection. Faith healing is\r\na fact, its meaning is of the greatest importance for psychotherapy\r\nand its phenomena deserve that specific study which alone can give any\r\ncertainty in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessories of Faith Cures.--From the earliest dawn of history we have\r\ndefinite records of faith cures. It is true that they were usually\r\nassociated with certain physical factors besides the mere act of the\r\nmind. In ancient Egypt the physicians were also priests, and while\r\nthey administered various remedies, these had the added advantage of\r\nbeing supposed to be the result of divine inspiration, or suggestion,\r\nor to be in some way connected with religion. Among these men there\r\nwere many strong personalities, contact with whom brought healing.\r\nDreams and premonitions and hallucinations all had a definite place in\r\ntheir therapeutics because of their supposed connection with religion,\r\nor at least with the beings of another world. Spiritualism, itself a\r\nform of religion, is very old, and communications from spirits, real\r\nor supposed, were easily thought to have therapeutic significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiracles.--In most cases of faith healing, faith acts through the\r\ndefinite conviction that there is to be a direct interference with the\r\nordinary course of nature in the patient's behalf. Some of the\r\nevidence for such direct interference on the part of Providence is so\r\nstrong as to carry conviction even to serious and judicious and\r\njudicial minds. When the circumstances are such {79} that an exception\r\nto the laws of nature would not involve an absurdity, there is no good\r\nreason why its occurrence should be absolutely put out of the\r\nquestion. It may well be urged that we know so little about the laws\r\nof nature that we cannot determine absolutely what are and what are\r\nnot exceptions to those laws. There is in itself, however, no\r\nabsurdity in what is called a miracle, and unless one is ready to\r\nreject Christianity entirely, or to declare it absolutely impossible\r\nthat the God who made the universe should have any personal care for\r\nit, or above all any interest in particular individuals in it, their\r\npossibility must be admitted. The attitude of utter negation and\r\nincredulity often assumed at the present day is only a reflection of a\r\ncertain ignorance of philosophy, and too great dependence on a\r\nsuperficial knowledge of physical science, so characteristic of\r\nnarrowly trained minds. After a visit to Lourdes and careful study of\r\n_\"La clinique de Lourdes,\"_ I am convinced that miracles happen there.\r\nThere is more than natural power manifest.\r\n\r\nIn a great many cases it is easy to see that the agents involved in\r\nthe faith cures, and the circumstances surrounding them, are quite\r\nunworthy of any supposition that the Deity should have interfered.\r\nWhere there is anything irrational, or sordid, or eminently selfish\r\nabout the faith-healing, then any appeal to a supposed interference\r\nfrom on high is absurd. Horace said in another matter, but it will\r\nbear application here: \"Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus.\"\r\nDo not let a god intervene unless there is a set of circumstances\r\nworthy of him. In many of the faith-healing phenomena claimed to be\r\nconnected with religion there are a number of absurdities. It may be\r\nsuggested that any one person must not set himself up as the judge of\r\nsuch absurdity. When it is evident, however, that the ailing are being\r\nexploited for the benefit of one or of a few persons, or when there\r\nare certain manifestly irrational conditions in the circumstances of\r\nhealing, then it is fair to conclude that what we have to do with are\r\nonly examples of healing by means of strong mental influence. But it\r\nwould be quite wrong on account of these abuses to dismiss the whole\r\nsubject of miracle healing as all imposture or merely mental\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Touch.--Probably the most interesting chapter in the history\r\nof faith cures is that of the touch of the King of England for\r\nscrofula, or, as it was known, the King's Evil. His touch was also\r\nsupposed to be efficacious in epilepsy. English historians usually\r\ntrace the origin of the custom to Edward the Confessor. Aubrey remarks\r\nthat \"the curing of the King's Evil by the touch of the King does much\r\npuzzle our philosophers, for whether our Kings were of the house of\r\nYork or Lancaster, it did the cure for the most part.\"\r\n\r\nEven the change of religion in the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth\r\nmade no difference. Some people who hesitated about submitting to\r\nElizabeth as queen lost their hesitancy when they heard that the\r\nqueen's touch was successful in curing. James I wanted to drop it, but\r\nwas warned not to, as it was a prerogative of the crown with which he\r\nhad no right to interfere. Charles I was particularly successful.\r\nCharles II, whose licentious life apparently would quite unfit him for\r\nthe exercise of any such power, was perhaps the English king who\r\ndevoted most time to healing. While he was in exile in the\r\nNetherlands, many people crossed over to the Low Countries in order to\r\nbe touched by him, and they returned cured of many different diseases.\r\n{80} This effectively prepared the minds of many for his return. Under\r\nscrofula were included most of the wasting diseases, and under\r\nepilepsy many neurotic conditions as well as many organic\r\ndisturbances. It is easy to understand how great was the room for the\r\nsuccessful employment here of mental influence.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne continued the practice, and many cures were reported in her\r\ntime as late as the eighteenth century. William of Orange, when he\r\nascended the throne with Mary, refused to believe that there was any\r\nspecial power for good in his touch. On one occasion he touched a\r\nperson who came to him, saying as he did so: \"God give you better\r\nhealth and more sense.\" In spite of this skeptical attitude his touch\r\nis said to have healed that particular person. In the next reign,\r\nhowever. Queen Anne resumed the practice, and Dr. Samuel Johnson, as a\r\nboy of five, was touched by her with some hundreds of others in 1712.\r\nNo cure was effected in his case, but as the gruff old doctor lived to\r\na round age in rather sturdy health, doubtless some would raise the\r\nquestion as to whether, if he had early scrofula, it was not greatly\r\nmodified for the better.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances connected with the royal touch were all calculated\r\nto be curative of the affections for which this practice had a\r\ntherapeutic reputation. There were certain times in the year,\r\nparticularly in the spring after Easter, when the king touched people\r\nfor their ills. Ordinarily preparations would be made for some time\r\nbefore, and the patients would have all the benefit of expectancy.\r\nThen there came the journey to London to the king's presence, and as\r\nit was usually known that these ailing folks were on their way to the\r\nking, they received particular care from the people of the towns\r\nthrough which they passed. Then came the day of the touch itself, and\r\nthe presentation of a coin, the so-called coin of the king's touch,\r\nwhich the patient was supposed to preserve. On the way home they were\r\nonce more subjects of solicitude, and they had the royal coin to\r\nassure them every now and then that they had been touched by the\r\nking's hand, and that they ought to get well--for had not many others\r\nbeen thus cured? All this favorable suggestion, with the outing and\r\nthe better food, was eminently calculated to cure the so-called\r\nscrofular conditions, under which term was grouped many vague forms of\r\nmalnutrition and the milder epilepsies and pseudo epilepsies, for the\r\ncure of which the touch was famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCramp Rings.--Scarcely less famous than the king's touch for\r\nnutritional and neurotic conditions were the \"cramp rings,\" which were\r\nblessed by the Queens of England and were supposed to cure all sorts\r\nof cramps. The power attached to them for this form of ailment was\r\nsimilar to that which the king's touch had for scrofula or the king's\r\nevil. Cramps seemed to be the \"queen's evil.\" Whenever a queen died\r\nthere was a great demand for these rings, because no more could be\r\nobtained until a new queen was crowned. The efficiency of these and\r\nthe cures which they performed can be readily understood. Many of the\r\nhysterical conditions within the abdomen are cramplike in character.\r\nHysteria will imitate nearly every form of cramp, including even those\r\ndue to gallstone and kidney calculus. Any strong mental influence will\r\ndo more for hysterical pain than our strongest medicines. On the other\r\nhand, many of the cramplike conditions within the abdomen may be\r\nrelieved by concentration of mind on some distracting thought, and\r\nfeelings of discomfort in the intestines may thus be relieved.\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\nMental Healers.--When the king was absent from England during\r\nCromwell's time, the touching for the king's evil was sadly missed. If\r\nCromwell himself had announced that he would touch for the diseases\r\nthat used to come to the king, a number of cures would undoubtedly\r\nhave been reported. As it was, Greatrakes, the Irish soldier\r\nadventurer, dreamt that he was commissioned from on high to touch for\r\nthe same diseases as formerly had gone to the king, and, having begun\r\nit, cures followed until probably many more came to him every year\r\nthan usually went to the sovereign in the olden times. He worked at\r\nleast as great a proportion of cures. Greatrakes had many imitators,\r\nsome of them doubtless quite sincere, but they were people of more or\r\nless deranged intellect, the kind who easily get the idea that they\r\nare commissioned for some purpose that sets them above the common\r\npeople. Indeed, the story of the mental healers is probably, more than\r\nanything else, a chapter in the history of insanity, and the power of\r\nthose with delusions to lead others to share their delusions. This is\r\nnot a slur upon human nature, and especially upon some of the\r\ninspirations and aspirations that lift it up to do great things, but a\r\nliteral statement of the view of these phenomena that seems forced\r\nupon us by modern advances in the knowledge of the psychology of\r\nmental influence and of psychic contagion.\r\n\r\nMost of the influence that was acquired by men who in the course of\r\nhistory claimed to have a heavenly mission has been due, as with\r\nhealers heretofore referred to, to reputed cures made by them. Trace\r\nthe story of this among the Eastern nations in the old time. The\r\npseudo-Messiahs of the Jews always advanced as one evidence their\r\nhealing power, but so did the founders of religions among all the\r\nother nations of antiquity. It must be borne in mind, however, that\r\nmany of the queer religions of after times were founded by men who\r\nclaimed to have a Messiahship, and put forth, as the evidence of a\r\ndivine commission, their power to cure the afflicted. Sometimes the\r\nmen who made these claims were good men. In many cases they were\r\napparently self-deceived. Very often, however, they had no claim to\r\ngoodness in the commonly accepted meaning of that term, for they\r\ncounseled the violation of moral precepts, made exceptions, for their\r\nown benefit, to general laws, and exploited their followers for\r\nselfish reasons. Provided their followers had confidence in them,\r\nhowever, they continued to work cures, so that even reasonable people\r\nwere likely to be led to the thought that there must be something\r\nsupernatural about their activities. In every century there have been\r\ntwo or three men who have thus secured a following, and apparently\r\nhealed many diseases.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of faith-healing as the result of belief in the heavenly\r\nmission of special men, are as common now as at any time. Dr. Cutten\r\nin his \"Three Thousand Years of Mental Healing\" (_Scribners_, 1911)\r\nhas a chapter on \"Healers of the Nineteenth Century,\" which shows how\r\nmany phenomena of faith-healing can be studied in recent generations.\r\nSome of the men and the women who are mentioned secured wide\r\nreputations throughout our own country.\r\n\r\nThese faith-healing movements have particularly affected the New\r\nEngland portion of our population, and many of our most prominent\r\nhealers have been born in the New England States. Wherever the new\r\ncults flourished, it is usually found that some of the most prominent\r\nmembers are descendants of {82} the old New Englanders. It has been\r\nsuggested that this is due to the gradual loss of belief in great\r\nreligious truths by New Englanders, and a definite tendency toward\r\nreaction against this loss of the religious sense, which, as is usual\r\nwith reactions, easily becomes exaggerated. From lack of belief they\r\njump to excess of belief. Men without trust in Providence find the\r\ntrials of life hard to bear, and they dread the development of\r\nphysical ill so much that they exaggerate their feelings, or even\r\ncreate symptoms. Men are happier with the feeling that the\r\nsupernatural powers surrounding them are interested in them directly\r\nand personally, and that somehow things, even in an incomprehensible\r\nworld, are arranged, if not for the best, at least for such good as\r\nmakes ills stepping-stones to new benefits. Whenever they are led far\r\naway from that thought, there is likely to be an exaggerated reaction\r\nback to it. The stronger minded apparently can get on without\r\nreligion, but to the great mass of men a strong religious sense is\r\nneeded to enable them to overcome the lack of self-confidence that is\r\nthe root of dreads, doubts, difficulties of many kinds, and which is\r\nalso the source of many symptoms as well as the cause of the\r\nexaggeration of many ailments.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, modern healers have been founders of new religions, or at\r\nleast they have broken away from old-established sects, and have\r\nformed congregations for themselves. They have sprung up in every part\r\nof the country. East, North, South, West, and among all the differing\r\nnationalities of our population. We cannot console ourselves with the\r\nidea that they affect especially the foreigners, for the native-born\r\npeople have proved to be quite as susceptible to them. These healers\r\nhave, as a rule, abused the medical profession and the use of drugs,\r\nand have taught that disease, if it really existed at all, was from\r\nthe devil: that what one needed, in order to secure relief from pains\r\nand ills, was faith in God--but always through _them_. Many of these\r\nmen and women have probably been serious and earnest and have deceived\r\nthemselves first. Most of them have undoubtedly been more or less\r\ndisequilibrated, though they have practically all exhibited the power\r\nto accumulate large amounts of money from their followers. The people\r\nwho have gone to them have not been the ignorant among our population,\r\nbut particularly those who read the newspapers, and who look upon\r\nthemselves as well informed. The intelligence of the disciples of\r\nthese healers, as we ordinarily estimate intelligence, has been a\r\nlittle above the average, rather than below it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schlatter and Dowie._--Probably the most disillusioning phenomena\r\nwith regard to the complacent idea that the diffusion of information\r\nprevents manifestations of superstition are stories of the healers\r\nSchlatter and Dowie. At the end of the nineteenth century both of them\r\nattracted widespread attention. Schlatter was probably not quite sane.\r\nHe wandered through the deserted portions of the Southwest, hatless,\r\nunkempt, with clothing torn and without shoes. In July, 1895, he first\r\nattracted attention as a public healer in New Mexico. After a reputed\r\nforty-day fast he went to Denver, where people flocked from all parts\r\nof the country to him. Files of people formed--sometimes five or six\r\nthousand--to be touched, and healed, by him. His reputation was due to\r\nthe cures that were reported. Dowie was another of these healers. Just\r\nat the beginning of the twentieth century he organized a great new\r\nchurch of his own, and announced himself as Elijah, the prophet,\r\nreturned to life. {83} Nearly 20,000 persons are claimed to have been\r\nhealed during the first ten years of his healing career. Toward the\r\nend of his life he declared that he treated, and cured, over 50,000 a\r\nyear. An abundance of crutches, canes and every form of surgical\r\nappliance for the ailing hung on the walls of his church at Zion City,\r\nChicago, left by people who, having been healed, had no further use\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nGENERAL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\n\r\n_GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MIND ON BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power of mind over body for the relief of symptoms has been\r\nrecognized, not only by physicians, but by the generality of men at\r\nall times. Every one has had experiences of aches, or actual pains, or\r\ndiscomfort quite annoying while one is alone, but that disappear while\r\nin pleasant company or occupied in some absorbing occupation. Many a\r\nheadache that was painful enough to disturb us seriously while we\r\ntried to apply ourselves to something of little interest, and became\r\nalmost unbearable if we tried to do something disagreeable, and\r\nactually intolerable if the occupation of the moment was a drudgery,\r\ndisappeared, at least for the time, when we turned to a pleasant game\r\nof cards or indulged in some other favorite pastime. Our relief was\r\nnot, however, from an imaginary ill, for the symptoms usually\r\nreasserted themselves when we got through with the pleasant\r\noccupation, showing that they have been there all the time and that we\r\nhave only turned our mind away from them, and hence have ceased to\r\nfeel them. This is so familiar it seems almost too commonplace to\r\nrepeat, yet it constitutes the special phenomenon that lies at the\r\nbase of psychotherapeutics, or the mental healing of physical ills.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the slighter, more or less negligible aches or pains,\r\nnor the vague discomforts that thus disappear when our attention is\r\noccupied, but even quite severe and otherwise unbearable pain may be\r\nmodified to a great extent. A toothache that is bearable, though it\r\nnags at us constantly and never lets us forget its presence while we\r\nare occupied with many other things during the evening, may become a\r\npositive torture when we get to bed. This is not only because of\r\nphysical conditions modifying the pain, for there seems no doubt that\r\nthe warmth induced by the preliminaries for sleep and the bed-covering\r\nhave a tendency to increase congestion, but it is mainly because as we\r\ndoze off we are able, less and less, to inhibit our attention, or\r\ndivert it from the pain that is present, and so this is emphasized\r\nuntil we have to do something for it or lose hours of sleep. This lack\r\nof inhibition, which characterizes the dozing hours, represents the\r\nstate of mind in which people are who have no interest in their\r\noccupations, and who have ceased to find recreation in the ordinary\r\npleasures of life, when pain of any kind comes to them.\r\n\r\nCabanis, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, under the title\r\nof {85} \"The Influence of the Moral on the Physical,\" discusses what\r\nwe would now call mental influence on the body. He says:\r\n\r\n  The great influence of what one may call the moral or mental on what\r\n  may be called the physical is an incontestible fact. Examples\r\n  without end confirm it every day. Every man capable of making\r\n  observations finds proofs of it thousands of times in himself. Many\r\n  physiologists and psychologists as well as moralists, have collected\r\n  the evidence that brings out clearly this power of the intellectual\r\n  operations and emotions on the different organs and the diverse\r\n  functions of the living body. All of us could add new illustrations\r\n  to these collections. Men who are rude and credulous talk of the\r\n  effect of the imagination, and if they are not themselves its\r\n  playthings and its victims, at least they know how to observe its\r\n  effects In others.\r\n\r\n  As a matter of fact, the action of our organs can be in turn\r\n  excited, suspended, or totally inhibited, according to the state of\r\n  mind, the change of ideas, the affections and the emotions.\r\n\r\n  A vigorous, healthy man has just made a good meal. In the midst of\r\n  the feeling of satisfaction which diffuses itself over all his body,\r\n  his food is digested with energy and without any bother. The\r\n  digestive juices perform their work steadily and without causing any\r\n  annoyance. But let such a man receive some bad news; let some sudden\r\n  emotion come to excite him, and especially to shock him into\r\n  profound sadness, and at once his stomach and intestines cease to\r\n  act upon the food which they inclose, or they at best perform their\r\n  functions badly. The digestive juices, by which the food materials\r\n  were gradually being dissolved, are suddenly stricken with\r\n  inactivity. What might seem to be a stupor comes over the digestive\r\n  tract, and while the nervous influence which determines digestion\r\n  ceases entirely, that which tends to bring about the expulsion of\r\n  material from the digestive tract may become more active and all the\r\n  material contained in the digestive viscera may, in a short time, be\r\n  expelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelief in Severe Injuries.--Even extremely severe injuries, which\r\ninflict serious organic lesions that ordinarily would produce shock\r\nand collapse, quite apart from the pain induced, may at moments of\r\nexcitement pass unnoticed. A soldier often does not know that he is\r\nwounded until the flow of blood calls his attention to it, or perhaps\r\na friend points it out to him, or loss of blood causes him to faint.\r\nThe prostrating effects of even fatal wounds may thus be overcome for\r\na considerable time in the excitement of battle, or because of a\r\nsupreme occupation by a surpassing sense of duty. There is the\r\nwell-known story of the young corporal detailed to make a report to\r\nNapoleon at a very important crisis of one of his great battles, who\r\nmade the report with such minute accuracy that it called forth a\r\ncompliment from Bonaparte, for it involved a very special exercise of\r\nmemory for details, yet who was actually on the verge of death when he\r\ndelivered the message. As his duty was accomplished the Emperor,\r\nnoticing his extreme pallor, said: \"But you are wounded, my lad.\" The\r\nyoung soldier replied, as if, now that duty was done, the\r\nconsciousness of his wound had just come to him, \"No, Sire, I am\r\nkilled,\" dropping dead at the Emperor's feet as he uttered the words.\r\n\r\nIn all of the great theater fires examples of this kind are recorded.\r\nA woman who barely escaped with her life from a theater fire some\r\nyears ago had an ear torn off, very probably by some one grasping it\r\nin the crowd. She knew nothing of this until it was called to her\r\nattention after she got out of the theater, and then she promptly\r\nfainted from the pain and shock. Under such circumstances men walk\r\nwith broken legs or limp even with dislocations, utterly unconscious\r\nthat anything serious has happened to them. Men have been known to be\r\nunaware of a broken bone or even more serious conditions, {86}\r\nordinarily quite painful and disabling, while laboring to help others\r\nin an accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppression of Reaction.--This side of the influence of the mind on\r\nthe body is so interesting that its effects have often been noted and\r\nstudied. While we do not quite understand the mechanism by which it\r\naccomplishes its marvels of anesthesia and even of motility under\r\napparently impossible conditions, there is no doubt that severe pain\r\nmay utterly fail to reach the consciousness, though the nervous system\r\nis uninterruptedly carrying the messages just as it did before. The\r\nlack of attention suppresses the ordinary effect upon the personality.\r\nEvidently the messages originate and are carried to the nerve centers,\r\nbut find no attention available for them, and so pass unnoticed. The\r\nstudy of phases of this phenomenon of suppression of reaction forms a\r\ngood basis for the use of mental influence, and shows its marvelous\r\npower to overcome disturbing physical factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmputation Stump Aches.--An interesting example of the influence of\r\nmind over body, when circumstances favor its exercise or emphasize it,\r\nand at the same time a striking illustration of the potency of\r\nsuggestion in the cure of discomfort, is found in the stories that are\r\nso common of cases of pains in amputation stumps. Any number of weird\r\ntales are told of men who complain of feeling cramps in the toes of an\r\namputated limb after this portion of their body had been buried. The\r\ndiscomfort is common enough. In the special stories, however, the\r\nlimbs have been dug up, the toes straightened out--according to the\r\nstory, they were always found cramped in some way--and then the\r\npatient is at once restored to ease. In the good old times they\r\nprobably believed in some direct connection between the straightening\r\nout of the toes of the amputated member and subsequent relief of pain.\r\nFor us it is but an example of the power of suggestion. It is not the\r\nsort of suggestion that one likes to think of employing, though it has\r\na certain dramatic quality which adds efficiency to suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind and Motility.--We have spoken thus far almost exclusively of\r\npainful conditions as relieved by suggestion or mental influence, but\r\ndisturbance of motor function may also be favorably affected. There\r\nare any number of cases on record in which patients who had been\r\nutterly unable to walk were restored to motility by a shock. Many such\r\npatients have, in the midst of the excitement of a fire, or the scare\r\ncaused by the presence of a burglar, got up and walked quite as well\r\nas ever, though sometimes they have been for years previously confined\r\nto bed. The San Francisco earthquake is said to have exerted such an\r\neffect on a number of patients, and, while such unusual disturbances\r\ncannot often be provided for the cure of these ailments, there can be\r\nno doubt at all of the power of a shock to the mind to overcome\r\nfunctional incapacity that has resisted every possible form of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nAilments of this kind, which involve inability of the will to control,\r\nor rather to initiate, movements of the body, receive their best\r\nexplanation on the neuron or neuroglia theory. (See the chapter on the\r\nMechanism of Suggestion.) The central neurons become either quite\r\nseparated from certain of the peripheral neurons, or at least the\r\nconnections are not made with that nice adjustment necessary for the\r\nproper passage of nerve impulses. The shock communicated to the\r\nnervous system by fright is sufficient, however, to restore these\r\nconnections, and consequently to enable the patient once more to\r\nexercise motor functions that have been in abeyance for some time.\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\n_Astasia-abasia._--Any one who has had to deal with the cases for\r\nwhich the French have invented the rather impressive Greek name of\r\nastasia-abasia--how much better it would be to call the condition\r\nsimply what we know it to be, nervous inability to stand or\r\nwalk!--appreciates how almost a miracle is needed to improve them. The\r\nincapacity for station or movement to which the disease owes its name\r\nis so complete in many cases, and the patients' lack of confidence in\r\nself so absolute, that no ordinary remedial measure is capable of\r\ndoing any good. These cases are usually a severe trial to the\r\npatients' friends. Indeed, the patients themselves maintain their\r\nnutrition so well and, as a rule, enjoy such good health, or, as has\r\nbeen said, enjoy their bad health so well, that it is for their\r\nattendants the physician feels most commiseration. Yet generally he is\r\nquite unable to do anything. It is certain, however, that with care\r\nand authoritative suggestion there would not need to be an earthquake,\r\nor a fire, or even a burglary, as a therapeutic measure in these\r\ncases. As a matter of fact, their cure when it occurs is always\r\nbrought about by some strong mental influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence on Organs.--_The Heart_.--The influence of mind can\r\nbe noted on practically every organ of the body in a concrete way. It\r\nmight be thought that the heart, the first living thing in the animal\r\nbeing, the pulsations of which begin before there is any sign of the\r\nnervous system, might be free from this influence. On the contrary,\r\nthe heart is so readily affected by mental states that, taking effect\r\nfor cause, the old popular, and even scientific idea with regard to\r\nit, was that it was the organ of the emotions. The heart is stimulated\r\nmore by favoring circumstances, and suffers more from depression, than\r\nalmost any other organ. In the melancholic states it usually beats\r\nless frequently and is sluggish. When individuals are tired out and\r\nthe heart has become weakened in its action, new courage will first be\r\nnoted as having its effect upon the heart action. As the whole\r\nmuscular system is much influenced by the mental state and, as the\r\ncontrol of the arterial system depends on the muscles in the arteries,\r\nit is easy to understand how much the general bodily condition may by\r\nmental influence be modified for good and ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Digestive Tract_.--The stomach and intestines, though their functions\r\nmight be presumed to be dependent entirely on physical conditions, are\r\nalmost completely under the control of the mental state. At moments of\r\ndepression, just after bad news has been received, the appetite is\r\nabsent, or is very slight and digestion itself proceeds slowly and\r\nunsatisfactorily. On the other hand, when there is mental good feeling\r\nappetite is vigorous and digestion is usually quite capable of\r\ndisposing of all that is eaten. If after a period of rejoicing in the\r\nmidst of which food is taken abundantly bad news is brought, the\r\nmental influence on digestion can be seen very well. It is not alone\r\nthat depression interferes with digestive processes, but apparently\r\nsome favorable factors for digestion consequent upon the previous\r\nstate of mind are withdrawn, and now what would have been a proper\r\namount of food proves to be an excess and the digestive organs find it\r\ndifficult to deal with it..\r\n\r\n\r\nNervous Inhibition.--The mind can actually inhibit certain of the\r\ninvoluntary processes of the body by thinking about them, and, above\r\nall, by dwelling on the thought that they are going wrong. This\r\nbecomes easier to understand when we recall how, in the same way, we\r\nmay disturb many habitual and more or less unconscious actions that we\r\nhave grown accustomed to. There {88} are any number of actions\r\nrequiring careful attention to details which become so habitual that\r\nwe do not have to think of them at all. Not infrequently it happens\r\nwhen we try to explain to others how we do them, we disturb the\r\nfacility of performance and have to repeat the acts several times\r\nbefore we succeed in performing successfully what a moment before we\r\ndid without any thought. The story of the centipede who was asked how\r\nhe walked with all his hundred legs, and who tried to describe how\r\neasy it was and got so mixed up that he was unable to move at all, is\r\na whimsical symbol of conscious attention disturbing actions which go\r\non quite well of themselves if only we do not allow ourselves to think\r\nconsciously of each and every phase of them.\r\n\r\nHow much the mind may influence the body under certain conditions when\r\ntrance-like states either assert themselves or are brought on, has\r\noften been noted. Lombroso in his book \"After Death What?\" [Footnote\r\n11] says of Eusapia Paladino the \"medium,\" that \"when she is about to\r\nenter the trance state the frequency of the respiratory movements is\r\nlessened just as is the case with the Indian fakirs. Before the trance\r\nshe will have been breathing eighteen to twenty times a minute; as the\r\ntrance begins the number of respirations is gradually reduced to\r\nfifteen; when the trance is fully developed she breathes twelve times\r\na minute or less. On the other hand, at the same time the heart beats\r\nincrease. Normally her pulse is about seventy, but during the early\r\ntrance stage it rises to ninety, while during the course of a deep\r\ntrance, it may go as high even as one hundred and twenty. The passing\r\nfrom a more or less rigid state to that of active somnambulism is\r\nmarked by yawns and sobs and spontaneous perspiration on the\r\nforehead.\" The observation of these phenomena is, of course, entirely\r\napart from any theory one may hold with regard to mediumistic\r\nmanifestations, and it provides evidence of mental influence that is\r\nvery striking.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 11: Small, Maynard & Co.. Boston, 1909.]\r\n\r\nImaginary Drug Effects.--Drug effects may be produced through the\r\nimagination. Physicians know that when patients are persuaded that\r\ncertain effects are to be expected from a particular medicine, the\r\neffects may follow all the same in sensitive, imaginative people, if\r\nthat medicine is replaced by some inert compound. Many a physician who\r\nhas used bread pills or other placebos to replace a drug that he did\r\nnot want the patient to acquire a habit for, has thus been able to\r\nallow good effects to go on without interruption, where the stoppage\r\nof medicine had previously interfered with the continuance of the good\r\nhabit that had been formed. Very few physicians have not seen the\r\neffect of a hypodermic of pure water when a hypodermic of morphine is\r\ndemanded, and when the patient would not sleep without having the\r\nhypodermic injection. Sleeping powders of various kinds can sometimes\r\nwith distinct advantage be replaced by inert materials, because the\r\npatient's mind is fixed upon the idea of sleep coming after a certain\r\ntime and they, in consequence, compose themselves to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nerves and Tissues.--Cases occur where disturbances of vitality\r\nare noted as a consequence of nervous affections, though no gross\r\nlesion of the nervous system is demonstrated. Certain nervous people\r\nsuffer from ulcerative conditions of their hands, and it is evident\r\nthat in some the nervous impulses {89} that would ordinarily keep the\r\nskin surface in good, healthy condition are insufficient. Some people\r\nwho use a typewriter have no difficulty at all with the ends of their\r\nfingers, while others are subject even to loss of skin or ulcerative\r\nconditions that make it almost impossible for them to go on with their\r\nwork. In some this is true in the winter, in others in the summer.\r\nThere are a number of skin conditions which are due to nervous factors\r\nand these evidently point to the influence of the central nervous\r\nsystem in keeping the forces of our body in such health, and resistive\r\nvitality, as will enable us to carry on whatever work we may wish to.\r\nThis is, of course, a very individual matter. Some people chap very\r\neasily, some suffer from chilblains, or are frost-bitten even on\r\nslight exposure, and these peculiarities are evidently dependent on\r\nthe intensity of the nervous impulses as well as the tone of the\r\ncirculation, which itself depends on the nerves to a great extent.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that some of these disturbances are not enduring, but\r\nare only temporary and therefore are due to functional disturbances of\r\nthe nervous system. Physicians often see hysterical patients suffering\r\nfrom intense pain that requires an injection of morphine, yet after a\r\nseries of such incidents, the physician is able to give an injection\r\nof plain water and produce just as good an anodyne effect. In these\r\ncases some influence of the will is enough to correct the painful\r\ndisturbances. Occasionally a single member loses sensation, or motion,\r\nor both, yet the fact that its nutrition does not suffer shows that\r\nthere is only disturbance in the motor connections between it and the\r\ncentral nervous system and not in the sensory nor trophic tracts, and\r\nthat this functional defect may be restored by some favorable\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nerve Supply and Health_.--We know now that when a part of the body\r\nis cut off from its connections with the central nervous system, it\r\nbegins at once to be lowered in vitality and gradually tends to\r\ndissolution. This will be true in spite of the fact that the\r\ncirculation continues as actively as before. It is not necessary,\r\nindeed, that the nerve trunk to a part should be cut, if it is\r\nsufficiently compressed its function is stopped and various\r\ndisturbances begin to appear in the vitality of the part which it\r\nsupplies. A typical example is to be seen in certain fractures of the\r\nclavicle, where a fragment presses on one of the nerves leading to the\r\narm. After a time pains develop in the arm, a burning feeling is\r\nnoticed in the skin, which becomes shiny and cold and of distinctly\r\nlowered vitality. Even a slight injury to the arm will now produce a\r\nserious ulcerative condition. There are evidently important influences\r\nfor life that flow down through the nerves from the central nervous\r\nsystem, quite as important in their way as the nutritional elements\r\nwhich flow through the blood.\r\n\r\nHow these influences of the mind on the body are accomplished is a\r\nportion of that larger mystery of the influence of mind, or soul, or\r\nprinciple of life, on the material elements of which our body is\r\ncomposed. Why a man receives a shock of lightning or a charge of\r\nelectricity at high voltage, and without a mark on his body or a\r\nchange in any cell that we can make out, be dead, though he was living\r\nan instant before, is another of these mysteries too familiar for\r\ndiscussion. There is no change in the weight of the body, nothing\r\nphysical has happened, but what was living matter with the power to\r\naccomplish the functions of living things is now simply dead material,\r\nunable to resist the invasion of saprophytic micro-organisms which\r\nwill at once, {90} unhampered, proceed to tear it down, though the\r\npreceding moment resistive vitality was completely victorious. The\r\nmystery remains, but the mechanism of the influence can now at least\r\nbe studied with much more satisfaction than was the case a few years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath and the Mind.--The extent to which the mind can be made to\r\ninfluence the body is apparently without limit. While the doctor is\r\nfrequently disturbed by the fact that death occurs when there is no\r\nadequate physical reason for it, just because the patient has looked\r\nforward to it with complete preoccupation of mind, there is no doubt\r\nthat occasionally death may be put off in the same way. We talk about\r\npeople living on their wills. This is a literal expression of what\r\nactually occurs in certain cases. On the other hand, without the will\r\nto live, it is sometimes extremely difficult to keep alive patients\r\nwho are in a run down condition. If one of an old married couple dies\r\nwhen the other is ill, we conceal the sad news very carefully from the\r\nsurvivor. This is done not alone to put off the shock and sorrow for a\r\ntime, but because often, under such circumstances, there will be no\r\nwill to live.\r\n\r\nWhen the vital forces have run down to such a degree that it seems\r\nimpossible, so far as ordinary medical reason goes, to look for\r\nanything but dissolution, patients still cling to life if there is\r\nsome reason why they want to live until a definite time. It does not\r\nhappen so much with the acute diseases but is quite common in chronic\r\ncases. Patients will live on expectant of seeing a friend who is known\r\nto be hurrying to them, or for some other purpose on which they very\r\nstrongly set their minds. In the life of Professor William Stokes, the\r\nIrish physician, to whom we owe the introduction of the stethoscope to\r\nthe English medical world, and many other important contributions to\r\nmedicine, there is a striking story that illustrates this power of the\r\nwill to maintain life until a definite moment.\r\n\r\n  An old pensioner, a patient of Stokes' in the Meath Hospital whose\r\n  life was despaired of, and whose death was hourly expected, was one\r\n  morning distressed and disappointed at observing that Stokes, who\r\n  believing that the man was unconscious at the time, and that it was\r\n  useless to attempt anything further as his condition was hopeless,\r\n  was passing by his bed. The patient cried out: \"Don't pass me by,\r\n  your honor, you must keep me alive for four days.\" \"We will keep you\r\n  as long as we can, my poor fellow,\" answered Stokes; \"but why for\r\n  four days particularly?\" \"Because,\" said the other, \"my pension will\r\n  be due then, and I want the money for my wife and children; don't\r\n  give me anything to sleep for if I sleep I'll die.\" On the third day\r\n  after this, to the amazement of Stokes and all the class, the\r\n  patient was still breathing. On the morning of the fourth day he was\r\n  found still breathing and quite conscious, and on Stokes' coming\r\n  into the ward, he saw the patient holding the certificate which\r\n  required the physician's signature in his hand. On Stokes\r\n  approaching him, the dying man gasped out. \"Sign, sign!\" This was\r\n  done, the man sank back exhausted, and in a few minutes after\r\n  crossed both hands over his breast and said, \"The Lord have mercy on\r\n  my soul,\" and then passed quietly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dread and Death_.--Dr. Laurent in his little book, \"La Medecine des\r\nAmes,\" [Footnote 12] has a story of similar kind but from a very\r\ndifferent motive:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Paris, Maloine, 1804.]\r\n\r\n  They brought to the prison infirmary one day an old burglar, an\r\n  incorrigible offender, who was undergoing a long sentence. He was\r\n  suffering from cancer of the stomach, and was already in a very\r\n  advanced stage of the affection. The poor devil seemed to realize\r\n  his condition very well, and felt that it was only a question of a\r\n  short time until he should die. He had made up his mind to that with\r\n  the {91} resignation which so often characterizes people of this\r\n  kind. Only one thing put him out very much, and that was the fear of\r\n  dying in prison.\r\n\r\n  \"I know well that I have to pass in my checks,\" he said over and\r\n  over again; \"but I do not want to die here. I do not want to be cut\r\n  up after I am dead.\"\r\n\r\n  He still had two months of his sentence to undergo. Every day the\r\n  disease made notable progress. His cachexia became more profound.\r\n  Life was passing from him drop by drop. At the end of five weeks he\r\n  was scarcely more than a living skeleton. Every morning we expected\r\n  to find him dead, or at least in his last agony. Nevertheless, every\r\n  morning, by an effort, he was able to recognize me and a little life\r\n  shone out of his sharp, small eyes that seemed like those of a bird\r\n  of prey.\r\n\r\n  One morning he said to me: \"Oh! you need not watch me. You shall not\r\n  have my carcass. I do not want to die in prison. I shall not die\r\n  here.\" He lived on till the end of his sentence. The morning of his\r\n  freedom he said to me, \"I told you that I did not want to die here,\r\n  and that I would not die here.\"\r\n\r\n  By an effort of his will he aroused himself enough so that his\r\n  friends were able to take him out of the prison. It was the last bit\r\n  of energy he had, however. His will power was at an end. A few hours\r\n  after his arrival in the house of his son he went off into a\r\n  profound depression, and would not talk even to his own. Then his\r\n  death agony came on, and he died that same evening. The strange and\r\n  surprising struggle of this man against death, the marvelous force\r\n  of physiological resistance which the fear of autopsy, if he died,\r\n  gave him, struck me vividly at the time. What intimate and\r\n  mysterious bond connects mind and matter that the one is able to\r\n  react in so much energy upon the other. How wonderful to think that\r\n  the fear, lest his abandoned body should be cut up, should actually\r\n  keep body and mind together until after the danger of that dreaded\r\n  event was passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestion and Death._--On the other hand, there are many stories\r\nthat show us how the giving up of hope of life seems to even hasten\r\ndeath. We have many stories of the death on the same day of husband\r\nand wife, or of brothers and sisters who thought very much of each\r\nother. Some of these are mere coincidences, but there are too many to\r\nbe all explained on the score of coincidence. It seems clear that the\r\nliving one, on hearing of the death of the other, feels that now there\r\nis nothing more to live for, and gives up the struggle. Hence the\r\nimportant rule in medical practice that a seriously ill patient should\r\nnot be told of an accident, and, above all, of the death of a near\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, strong expectation of death at a definite time,\r\nespecially if accompanied by suggestions with some physical signs, may\r\nbring about actual dissolution. We have a number of well authenticated\r\nstories to illustrate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Renewal of Hope._--How much energy even the slightest hope may\r\nfurnish, when apparently all power of effort is exhausted, is well\r\nillustrated by what happens to men who are lost at sea or in a desert.\r\nAfter the lapse of a certain length of time human nature seems utterly\r\nincapable of further effort and they sink down exhausted. The\r\nappearance of a light at a distance, a hail, any communication that\r\ngives them even the slightest hope will renew their energy and enable\r\nthem to draw on unsuspected stores of vitality after the end seemed\r\ninevitable. It may be said that the exhaustion in these cases is more\r\napparent than real, that discouragement prevents the release of even\r\nthe energy that is present, and might be used under more favorable\r\ncircumstances, but that is exactly the argument which favors the\r\ndeliberate employment of psychotherapeutic motives to enable patients\r\nto use the energies which they possess. In the midst of disease, or\r\nthe struggle for life, when vitality is {92} being sapped, hope is\r\nlost or obscured, just as it is when a man is alone in the desert or\r\nstruggling far from help on the ocean. If we can prevent this\r\ndiscouragement from sapping his powers there will always be a\r\nprolongation of life, and often this will be sufficient to enable\r\nvital resistance to overcome exhausting disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw of Reserve Energy.--Prof. William James [Footnote 13] called\r\nparticular attention to the law of reserve energy which recent studies\r\nin psychology have emphasized. This law of reserve energy is a\r\nconclusion from certain facts which are very familiar to men and have\r\nbeen observed as long as the memory of man runs, yet the full\r\nsignificance of which has never been read quite aright. Applied to a\r\nvery limited range of actions, it has been applied only half-heartedly\r\nin ordinary life, and to its full extent only under the pressure of\r\nabsolute necessity. This law holds out the best promise to\r\npsychotherapy. It shows that there are reservoirs of surplus energy in\r\nman which, if they can be successfully tapped, present possibilities\r\nof resistance to fatigue--and fatigue in many more ways than we used\r\nto think resembles disease. Besides, this law represents a very\r\nwonderful capacity for withstanding pains and aches and conquering\r\ndisinclination that would otherwise seem impossible. If it can be made\r\nto apply to ordinary life as well as it does to extraordinary events,\r\nthen the conscious deliberate use of psychotherapy or mental\r\nsuggestion should prove to have wonderful remedial power. Prof. James\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: _American Magazine_, Sept., 1908.]\r\n\r\n  Everyone knows what it is to start a piece of work, either\r\n  intellectual or muscular, feeling stale--or \"cold,\" as an Adirondack\r\n  guide once put it to me. And everybody knows what it is to warm up\r\n  to his job. The process of warming up gets particularly striking in\r\n  the phenomena known as second wind. On usual occasions we make a\r\n  practice of stopping an occupation as soon as we meet the first\r\n  effective layer (so to call it) of fatigue. We have then walked,\r\n  played, or worked enough, so we desist. That amount of fatigue is an\r\n  efficacious obstruction on this side of which our usual life is\r\n  cast.\r\n\r\n  But if an unusual necessity forces us to press onward, a surprising\r\n  thing occurs. The fatigue gets worse up to a certain critical point,\r\n  when gradually it passes away, and we are fresher than before. We\r\n  have evidently tapped a level of new energy, masked until then by\r\n  the fatigue obstacle usually obeyed. There may be layer after layer\r\n  of this experience. A third and fourth wind may supervene. Mental\r\n  activity shows the phenomenon as well as physical, and in\r\n  exceptional cases we may find, beyond the very extremity of fatigue\r\n  distress, amounts of ease and power that we never dreamed ourselves\r\n  to own--sources of strength habitually not taxed at all, because\r\n  habitually we never push through the obstruction, never pass those\r\n  early critical points.\r\n\r\nHe then states what has come to be called the law of reserve energy.\r\n\r\n  _It is evident that our organism has stored up reserves of energy\r\n  that are ordinarily not called upon, but that may be called upon;\r\n  deeper and deeper strata of combustion or explosible material,\r\n  discontinuously arranged, but ready for use for any one who probes\r\n  so deep, and repairing themselves by rest as well as do the\r\n  superficial strata_.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a marvelous reserve power in men and women which can\r\nbe used in emergencies and in times of severe strain, to enable men\r\nand women to accomplish what looks impossible and which has often\r\ncontradicted the prognosis of the physician. History is full of\r\napplications of this law which, however, does not come into action,\r\nunless especially called. Men and women {93} may die simply because\r\nthey give up the struggle. Men and women who _will not give up_ seem\r\nable to overcome severe illness that would take away ordinary people.\r\nIt has often been said that tuberculosis takes only the quitters and\r\nthat men of character constitute the typically favorable patients for\r\ntuberculosis sanatoria. Psychology is now getting at the explanation\r\nof many events that were formerly quite inexplicable. The science has\r\ncome to recognize the reservoir of reserve energy in human nature\r\nwhich may be tapped under special favoring circumstances. The\r\nphysicians of the past have often succeeded in tapping it deliberately\r\nas well as unconsciously. There is large room, however, for the\r\nfurther development of medicine along this line, to the great\r\nadvantage of therapeutics and probably the most promising field at the\r\npresent time in view in therapy lies in this direction. Hence the\r\nnecessity for more deliberate conscious use of it in every possible\r\nsuitable form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nUNFAVORABLE MENTAL INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nMuch as may be accomplished by psychotherapeutics through favorable\r\nmental influence--the modifying of the mental attitude towards\r\ndisease, diversions of mind from aches and pains, concentration of\r\nattention on subjects apart from ailments--much more may be done by\r\nremoving any unfavorable mental influence. This of itself produces\r\nsymptoms either by interfering with normal processes through\r\nsurveillance of them, or by so exaggerating, through attention to\r\nthem, slight symptoms that may be present that patients are made quite\r\nmiserable, though there is no adequate physical cause for their\r\ncondition. Perhaps the most striking example that we have of\r\nunfavorable mental influence as productive of the persuasion that\r\ndisease is present, is familiar to every physician who is close to\r\nmedical students when they are first introduced to the symptoms of\r\ndisease. It is almost a rule that certain members of the class\r\nimmediately conclude that they are suffering from one or more of the\r\nsymptoms which they are studying, and that, therefore, they must have\r\nthe diseases with which the symptoms are associated. If at this time\r\nthey walk on the shady side of a street on an autumn day and have a\r\nlittle shivery feeling, or when they get into the sun they feel a\r\nglow, these two very normal feelings are exaggerated into chilliness\r\nand fever, and the student has to go to his professor to have his\r\nmental malaria or typhoid treated. To the student, his symptoms are\r\nfor the moment very real, and unless someone in whom he has confidence\r\nreassures him, his discomfort will probably continue for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathological Suggestion.--In a word, suggestions of disease are much\r\neasier to take than is usually imagined, and if people read or hear\r\nmuch about diseases they are likely to jump to the conclusion that\r\nthey are sufferers. Under present conditions there are many more such\r\nsinister suggestions put before people than used to be the case. The\r\nnewspapers are constantly reporting curious cases and rare diseases,\r\nand usually those of absolutely unfavorable prognosis and inevitably\r\nfatal termination are particularly dilated on. Pathology has become a\r\nsource of many sensations, until the community {94} generally has come\r\nto eke out the thrills of the day's news by reading about fatal\r\ndiseases and fatal injuries, whenever murder and suicide sensations\r\nfail. As a consequence, many become persuaded that they are suffering\r\nfrom forms of disease of which they have not a symptom, and, not\r\ninfrequently, the wonderful cures that are reported in the newspapers\r\nconsist of nothing more than recoveries from these imaginary ills into\r\nwhich people have suggested themselves as the result of reading about\r\nmorbid states.\r\n\r\nA typical illustration of the power of the mind to influence the body\r\nunfavorably is recognized in many of the comic stories that have had a\r\nvogue in recent years. Their underlying thought is that if a man is\r\nonly told often enough, and by a number of different people, that he\r\ndoes not look well, or if he is even asked a little solicitously as to\r\nwhether he feels well or not, he will almost invariably begin to\r\npersuade himself that there must be something the matter with him.\r\nAfter a time, under the influence of this unfavorable suggestion, he\r\nbegins to feel tired and is likely to think that he cannot go on with\r\nhis work. When meal time comes his appetite fails him. A victim has\r\nbeen even known to go home and send for the doctor, persuaded that\r\nthere is something the matter, simply because a series of friends, for\r\na joke, or sometimes through a mistake, have insisted on asking him\r\nquestions that called attention to his state of health. Few men are\r\nstrong enough to stand the influence of unfavorable suggestion of this\r\nkind, if it is frequently repeated. More direct forms of suggestion of\r\ndisease have, of course, even greater effects. Many a man goes to a\r\nquack only feeling a little out of sorts and wanting to reassure\r\nhimself, but easily becomes persuaded that there is something serious\r\nthe matter with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion in Ancient Times.--This unfavorable influence\r\nof the mind on the body, even to the extent of the production of\r\ndisease by means of suggestion, was recognized by the ancients. They\r\nknew and wrote of hypochondriasis and, indeed, they invented the term.\r\nIn many of these cases the seat of auto-suggestion is supposed to be\r\nthe digestive organs and the localization of the discomfort is in the\r\nhypochondria, that is, in the upper abdominal region. The Grecian\r\nwriters seemed to recognize clearly that the symptoms were the result\r\nof thinking over much about self and concentration of attention upon\r\nunfavorable suggestions.\r\n\r\nPlato, in the \"Republic,\" says:\r\n\r\n  In former days the guild of Asclepius did not practice our present\r\n  system of medicine, which may be said, he declares, to educate\r\n  diseases. He cites the example of Herodicus who, \"being a trainer\r\n  (of gymnasts) and himself of a sickly constitution, by a happy\r\n  combination of training and doctoring, came to the invention of\r\n  lingering death; for he had a mortal disease, which he perpetually\r\n  tended, and, as recovery was out of question, he passed his entire\r\n  life as a valetudinarian.\" Plato, finishing the description, makes\r\n  us recognize the hypochondriac when he says: \"He could do nothing\r\n  but attend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he\r\n  departed in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by\r\n  the help of science he struggled on to old age.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of the neurasthenic, or hypochondriac, who has educated\r\nhimself, as Plato says, into disease, is an interesting parallel to\r\nmodern conditions in this matter.\r\n\r\nNowhere more than in this matter of knowledge of disease, can weight\r\n{95} be attached to Pope's dictum that a little knowledge is a\r\ndangerous thing, and that one must drink deep or touch not the Pierian\r\nSpring of medical information. The teaching of pathology under the\r\nguise of physiology, now so common in our schools, is likely to do\r\nmore harm than good. Various pathological conditions, such as those\r\nproduced by alcohol and tobacco, have been emphasized to such an\r\nextent as to produce unfavorable suggestions in the pupils' minds with\r\nregard to the untoward events that may happen in their insides, and\r\nthe serious lasting pathological changes that may occur, though all\r\nunconsciously, to the sufferer as the result of indiscretions. The\r\nstudy of the morbid changes produced in the mucous membranes of the\r\ndigestive tract by the use of stimulants, impresses ideas on the mind\r\nthat are readily transferred to other abuses in eating or drinking.\r\nThe rather vivid pictures and descriptions of the pathological\r\nconditions that may develop, become a portion of the acquired\r\nconsciousness as to internal conditions, and this consciousness acts\r\nas an unfavorable suggestive factor whenever there are any digestive\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteriphobia.--The development of bacteriology has had a similar\r\neffect, especially because periodicals and newspapers like to take up\r\nonly the sensational side of biological discoveries. Most physicians\r\nwho have had anything to do with nervous diseases have seen cases of\r\nmisophobia, the fear of dirt, which in our day has taken on the\r\nspecial character of fear of microbes. Those who are sensitive to the\r\npossibility of contamination learn of the almost sacrificial\r\nprecautions that surgeons take to avoid wound infection, and conclude\r\nthat practically everything they handle must fairly reek with\r\nmicrobes. They hesitate about touching the door knob or latch, and\r\ninvent all sorts of excuses to wait for a moment outside the door in\r\norder to have someone else open it. Especially are they timorous about\r\ntouching the door knobs of a physician's residence, or the chairs in\r\nhis waiting room, or even to shake hands with him. Hospital walls and\r\ndoors become an abomination to them. These cases emphasize how much of\r\nunfavorable suggestion there has been in the present spread of popular\r\nknowledge with regard to microbes.\r\n\r\nA writer on popular science once said that every time we spread a\r\npiece of bread of the size of the hand with butter, we scatter over\r\nits surface as many microbes as there are inhabitants in the United\r\nStates. The expression has gone the rounds, producing its effect on\r\nsensitive people, occasionally causing even a disgust for so important\r\nan article of diet as butter, more often giving rise to an extreme\r\nsensitiveness with regard to any special savor that butter may have,\r\nand it may have many according to the prevailing food of the cow.\r\nThere has been much emphasis laid on the potentialities for harm of\r\nthe microbes, and very little on the important part which they play in\r\nthe production of many forms of food materials. Most people know and\r\ndread the fact that microbes produce disease. Very few seem to realize\r\nthat while we know many thousands of different kinds of microbes,\r\nscarcely more than a score of them are known to be seriously\r\npathogenic, while all the others are either indifferent or, as we know\r\nof very many, are actually benefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\nPeople have heard much of the flora of the digestive tract, until they\r\nhave come to think with anxiety of the almost infinite number and\r\nmultitudinous variety of the minute plant life that finds a habitat in\r\nthe human intestine. Most people think that all of these are, in\r\ntendency at least, {96} harmful, and are only kept from being\r\npositively dangerous by the overwhelming vital activity of the mucous\r\nmembrane and the secretions which keep them from exerting their malign\r\nactivity. Very few appreciate the fact that the intestinal flora, far\r\nfrom being a disturbing factor, are often an aid to digestion, and\r\nthat the equilibrium established among them favors many biological and\r\nchemical processes which help in the preparation of food and in the\r\nbreaking up of waste products that might be dangerous if reabsorbed\r\nduring their stay in the intestinal tract. Microbes we have always\r\nwith us and always will have, and men have lived to round old age, not\r\nonly in spite of them, but very probably partially because of them.\r\nThey are part of that beneficent mystery of nature of which as yet, in\r\nspite of scientific progress, we know comparatively little.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opposing Favorable Suggestion_,--A recent striking change of\r\nsentiment with regard to one form of food material furnishes a good\r\nexample of how little we know about the real effect of bacterial life\r\nwithin the digestive tract. There was a time, not so long since, when\r\nsour milk was supposed to be especially harmful, or at least only\r\nlikely to do good to those of particularly strong digestive vitality.\r\nMetchnikoff's work on the influence of sour milk on the digestive\r\ntract, however, has brought a complete reversal of opinion in this\r\nmatter. Now most physicians are convinced that the bacillus of sour\r\nmilk, acts in the intestinal tract to inhibit the reproduction and\r\ngrowth of other, and possibly more disturbing, bacterial agents. Sour\r\nmilk is looked upon as one of the things that, by neutralizing certain\r\nunfortunate bacterial processes in the digestive tract, lead to\r\nlongevity. There seems no doubt at all, that those who consume a great\r\ndeal of it, live longer lives than the average, and many old men have\r\ntaken to its use with a consequent amelioration of digestive\r\nannoyances.\r\n\r\nThe popularization of bacteriology, then, has been one of those\r\nmoments of unfavorable suggestion that have affected a large number of\r\npeople. Such influences do not mean much for people of phlegmatic\r\ntemperament. For others, however, they have a weighty significance and\r\nmake every symptom, or more properly every sensation, that is at all\r\nunusual in the digestive tract, seem of ominous import. Certain\r\nsensations inevitably accompany digestion. The peristaltic movements\r\nare usually said to be unfelt, but even a slight exaggeration brings\r\nthem into the sphere of sensation. Where attention is given to the\r\nabdominal region and its contents, feelings that ordinarily are not\r\nnoticed at all come to be perceived. With the unfavorable suggestion\r\nderived from the unfortunate diffusion of a superficial knowledge of\r\npathology and of bacteriology instead of hygiene and the science of\r\nbeneficent microbiology, these feelings produce a bad effect upon the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamiliar Examples of Unfavorable Suggestion.--There are many familiar\r\nexamples of the discomfort that may be produced by the mental\r\npersuasion that something will disagree with us, or that certain\r\nfeelings have a significance quite beyond that which ought to be\r\nattributed to them. Everyone knows how qualmy may be the feeling\r\nproduced by being told that something eaten with a relish contained\r\nsome unusual material, or was cooked under unclean conditions. Food\r\nthat agrees quite well with people, so long as they do not know too\r\nmuch about it, often fails to be beneficial after they see how it has\r\nbeen prepared. It is often said that people would not relish the food\r\n{97} placed before them if they were aware how lacking in cleanliness\r\nwas the place of its preparation, and how negligent those who had\r\ncharge of it. Occasionally a peep at the kitchen of a boarding house\r\neffectually takes away appetite, or disturbs the equanimity with which\r\nfood must be taken, if there is to be that undisturbed digestion which\r\nmakes for healthy nutrition.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, with regard to digestion that the influence of the mind\r\non the body, favorable as well as unfavorable is, perhaps, most\r\neffectively exercised. Unfortunately the unfavorable influence is even\r\nmore pronounced than its opposite. Some people are much more sensitive\r\nthan others in this respect, and even the thought of certain defects\r\nin the preparation of their food seriously disturbs them. Everyone has\r\nhad the experience of seeing sensitive persons leave the table because\r\nsome one insisted on telling a nauseating tale. Anyone who has seen\r\nthe effect of talking of blood sausage or fried brains with black\r\nbutter sauce at a table on shipboard, when some practical joker was\r\nexercising his supposed wit, knows how much the imagination can\r\ndisturb, not only appetite but digestion. The attitude of mind means\r\nmuch, and especially are such unfavorable suggestions likely to\r\nproduce serious effects in inhibiting digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestion and Seasickness_.--Seasickness illustrates the place of\r\nunfavorable suggestion in digestion. The nausea, consequent upon the\r\nmovement of a vessel at sea, is due to a disturbance of the\r\ncirculation within the skull, and particularly of the circulation in\r\nthe semi-circular canals. The organ of direction of the body is\r\ndisturbed by the over-function demanded of it, consequent upon the\r\ncontinuous movement of the vessel. This is, however, only a\r\npredisposing element. A strong additional factor is the firm\r\npersuasion many people have that they will suffer from nausea and\r\nseasickness, and the unfavorable expectancy thus aroused. Most people\r\nhave to give their dole to Neptune. Those who for weeks before have\r\nbeen expecting and dreading it usually pay a heavy tribute. Probably\r\nthe best remedy for seasickness is the suggestion that there is no\r\nnecessity for losing more than a meal or two, if even that much,\r\nprovided there is simplicity of diet and proper predisposition of body\r\nby gentle opening of the bowels, and lack of the over-feeding that\r\nsometimes comes from dinners given before departure. I have known many\r\npeople who, after suffering severely not in one but in many voyages,\r\nhave, by means as simple as this, been saved from days of seasickness\r\neven in rough weather.\r\n\r\nMost of the cures for seasickness that have been suggested have\r\ndepended principally on the suggestive element. For instance, there is\r\nno doubt that many people are relieved by wearing dark glasses, and\r\nthis remedy does good for train sickness and other afflictions of a\r\nsimilar kind. There is, however, no good physical reason why wearing\r\ndark glasses should help except through their constant physical\r\nsuggestion. A simple remedy that has helped many through seasickness\r\nis the wearing of a sheet of glazed paper, usually some heavy\r\nwriting-paper, immediately over the skin of the abdominal region. This\r\nof itself has no physical effect, but the sensation of its presence\r\nconstantly obtrudes itself, and by making people feel that they must\r\nbe better because a great many other people have declared that they\r\nwere bettered by this remedy, they actually suffer less from nausea\r\nand vomiting. Many of the internal remedies employed for seasickness\r\nare directed to the stomach and intestines. {98} As the seat of the\r\ndifficulty is not here but within the skull, the reputation which\r\nthese remedies have acquired has been due largely to the suggestive\r\neffect of taking them rather than to any physical qualities they\r\npossessed, though of course they have served to set at rest stomachs\r\ndisturbed by unfavorable expectancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Groups and Suggestion.--Labeling groups of ailments with a\r\nsingle term gives rise to many unfortunate conclusions and dreads with\r\nregard to what a particular condition really is. The word\r\n\"indigestion\" is commonly used for any stomach discomfort or\r\ndisturbance, especially that occurring after eating, from the slight\r\ndistress because too much has been eaten, or the uncomfortable feeling\r\nof fullness because too much liquid has been taken, or the discomfort\r\ndue to an unsuitable mixture of food materials, to such serious\r\nconditions as develop when there is motor insufficiency of the\r\nstomach, followed by dilatation, with delay of the food for long\r\nperiods and with consequent fermentation, distress and bad breath.\r\nWhenever the word \"indigestion\" is mentioned, the patient may think of\r\nthe worst cases that he has seen or heard of with this label, and\r\nconcludes that while his ailment may not be very serious just now, it\r\nis only a question of time until it becomes so, and that unless he can\r\nget rid of his uncomfortable feeling he is destined to have one of the\r\nforms of \"indigestion\" that are productive of such serious discomfort,\r\nwith probably ever increasing torment, until some fatal complication\r\ndevelops. The initial symptoms of gastric ulcer and cancer have been\r\nlabeled indigestion, and people, often recalling the serious\r\nconsequences that followed in such cases, fear for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fearing the Worst_.--This looseness of terms is noted with regard to\r\nmany other forms of disease. Rheumatism calls up the picture of\r\nadvanced arthritis deformans, with the awful deformed joints and\r\nbed-riddenness, which should not bear the term rheumatism at all, but\r\nwhich the patient has heard called so. Catarrh is the simplest of\r\ninflammatory processes, meaning merely an increase of secretion,\r\nfunctional in character and without any serious disturbance of an\r\norganic character beneath it, but many people have heard the\r\nfoul-smelling ozena called catarrh, at least popularly, and so the\r\nmental picture of such a repulsive progressive process as beginning in\r\nthem is suggested. It is important, therefore, when using words that\r\nhave such wide connotation as these, to explain exactly what is meant,\r\nand perhaps, better still, not to use the words, but to employ some\r\nmore specific term that does not carry a cloud of dreads with it.\r\nIndigestion can be a very simple passing set of symptoms, but once\r\ncertain people get the notion that they are troubled with indigestion,\r\ntheir minds dwell on it to such an extent that they are likely to\r\nlimit their eating more than they should, and to disturb digestive\r\nprocesses by thinking about them and using up in worry nervous energy\r\nthat should be allowed to flow down to actuate digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo-called Incurability.--Patients are likely to hear entirely too much\r\nof the incurability of disease. To the doctor and patient this word,\r\nincurability, often has an entirely different meaning. The doctor\r\nmeans only that the diseased tissues cannot be restored to their\r\nprevious condition by any of our known remedies, and that the effects\r\nof the deterioration are likely to be felt to some degree for the rest\r\nof the patient's life. To the patient it means, as a rule, not only\r\nthat the doctor can do nothing for him, which is usually {99} quite\r\nuntrue, for much can be done for his symptoms even though the\r\nunderlying disease may be intractable, but also that the symptoms are\r\nto grow constantly worse. This is often quite without foundation, for\r\nnature's compensatory powers are very wonderful and seldom fail to\r\nafford relief. In a great many cases fatal termination comes, not from\r\nthe original affection, but through intercurrent disease. Above all,\r\nincurable means to many patients that finally the victim is to become\r\nmore and more subject to the pains and ills of his \"incurable\" ailment\r\nuntil he becomes perhaps a pitiable object. Incurability, when we\r\nrecall that patients are so likely to mistranslate this term in the\r\nway indicated, must be a word little used. Etymologically it is never\r\ntrue, for _cura_ means care, and we can always care for and relieve\r\nthe patient. In every chronic case there is room for hope of much\r\nrelief through accustomedness, various remedies, nature's compensatory\r\nmethods, and, above all, the modification of the state of mind.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no incurable disease that is ever quite as serious\r\nas it is pictured by its victim when he first hears this word\r\npronounced. When we recall the chances of life, and that in any given\r\ncase, almost as a rule, the patient will live to hear of the deaths of\r\nmen and women who were in perfect good health when his ailment was\r\npronounced incurable, there is much of consolation to be derived from\r\nconditions as they are. It seldom happens that a physician sees a\r\nsufferer from tuberculosis, whose affection is running a somewhat\r\nchronic course, without being able to find out that since the first\r\nsymptoms of the disease manifested itself, one or more of the\r\npatient's near relatives have died because of exposure incident to\r\ntheir abounding health. Pneumonia, appendicitis, typhoid fever,\r\naccidents of various kinds, take off the healthy relatives, while the\r\ntuberculous patient, constantly obliged to care for his health, lives\r\non, and often is able to accomplish a good deal of work. It is\r\nimportant to impress facts of this kind upon these \"incurable\" cases,\r\nfor they represent the light in the desert, or the shout, or the\r\nwhistle at sea, that give renewed energy when nature seems about to\r\ngive up the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking Health.--Hudson in \"The Law of Mental Medicine\" [Footnote 14]\r\nsuggests that we should think health and talk health on all suitable\r\noccasions, remembering that under the law of suggestion health, as\r\nwell as disease, may be made contagious. This expression probably\r\nrepresents an important element for the prophylaxis of disease under\r\nall conditions. Under present conditions people talk entirely too much\r\nabout disease and have too many suggestions of pathological\r\npossibilities constantly thrown around them by our newspapers, our\r\nmagazines and by popular lecturers as well as by our free public\r\nlibraries. People have learned to think and talk disease rather than\r\nhealth. This predisposes them to exaggerate the significance of their\r\nfeelings, if it does not actually, on occasion, lower their resistive\r\nvitality because of solicitude. The medical student torments himself\r\nwith the thought that he is suffering from the diseases that he\r\nstudies, and we cannot expect that the general public will be even as\r\nsensible as he is in this matter. On the contrary, people generally\r\nare much more liable to exaggerate the significance of their feelings,\r\nhence the necessity for healthy suggestions rather than innuendoes of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 14: McClurg, Chicago, 1903.]\r\n\r\nIn recent years, to paraphrase Plato's expression, people are much\r\nmore {100} inclined to educate themselves in disease than in health.\r\nThe result has been a storehouse of unfavorable suggestion, from which\r\nideas are constantly being taken to make whatever symptoms that may be\r\npresent seem unduly important. Consequently people look for the worst,\r\nand suggest themselves into conditions where not only are they\r\nexaggerating their symptoms, but they are absolutely preventing the\r\nflowing down of such nervous impulses as will enable them to overcome\r\naffections that are present. Whenever anything turns up that lessens\r\ntheir tendency to unfavorable auto-suggestion, their health improves.\r\nHence the taking, with confidence, of any quack medicine, no matter\r\nwhat its constituents, cures them; hence the success of the numerous\r\nand very varied forms of mental treatment. New Thought, Eddyism,\r\nosteopathy, and the like, attain most of their successes because of\r\nthe removal of unfavorable suggestions, and the setting up in their\r\nstead of favorable suggestion. In psychotherapy the first duty of the\r\nphysician is to undo all the unfavorable suggestion at work, and, if\r\nsuccessful in that, great therapeutic triumphs are possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF BODY ON MIND\r\n\r\nWhile trying to take advantage of the influence of the mind on the\r\nbody for therapeutics, it is important to remember that the body has a\r\ngreat influence on the mind. There are many states of mind that are\r\ndependent on states of body, and that can be modified only by first\r\nmodifying the body. Body changes can at least greatly help. In order\r\nto use the mind in the therapeutics of conditions in which it would\r\nhelp in the awakening of such vitality as is necessary for the cure,\r\nparticularly of many of the chronic affections, it is necessary first\r\nto dispose the body so that it will not constantly be adding to, or at\r\nleast emphasizing, an unfavorable state of mind. For this purpose it\r\nis important to study definitely and practically the influence that\r\nvarious attitudes, expressions and external manifestations may have in\r\nchanging the internal feelings. This factor seems trivial when viewed\r\nfrom the standpoint of health, but it is one of the trifles that are\r\nvery helpful in the predisposition of the patient to get better.\r\nAlteratives in medicine, while we have not been able to say just what\r\ntheir effect was, have done much for us, and the influence of body on\r\nmind is just such an alterative.\r\n\r\nEven those who have insisted most strenuously on the independence of\r\nmind from body have always recognized not only the influence of the\r\nmind on the body, but also of the body on the mind. Perhaps the most\r\nfamiliar example of this is the well-known liability to dream after\r\neating things that disturb digestion and seem to interfere, probably\r\nby congestive tendencies, with the circulation of the brain during\r\nsleep. It has always been recognized that mental operations are\r\nsluggish for some time after eating, and that a period of depression\r\nis likely to follow any excess. The Romans feared the consequences of\r\nindigestion so much that, occasionally after they had surfeited\r\nthemselves with rich food, they took such direct mechanical means as a\r\nfeather or a finger in the throat to relieve their overloaded stomach,\r\nin order that they {101} might not suffer the after consequences, but\r\nespecially the depression and irritability of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisposition and Digestion.--The relation of the body to the mind in\r\nmany other besides the purely animal digestive functions has always\r\nbeen realized. It has always been felt that the disposition of an\r\nindividual depended to a great extent on his nutrition. Men were not\r\nusually approached for favors before their meals, and especially after\r\na long fast, but, as far as possible, requests were made shortly after\r\nmeals. It has always been recognized that the best time for men to get\r\ntogether in council is, at least so far as amiability goes, shortly\r\nafter meals. Tiredness was also felt to be an important element in\r\naffecting the mind. The tired man, even though he may be hungry, can\r\nonly eat a hearty meal at the risk of serious disturbance of\r\ndigestion, for, as a consequence of the fatigue of the body being\r\ncommunicated to the mind, the mental influence which predisposes to\r\ngood digestion is lacking, and it is easy for serious digestive\r\ndisturbances to be set up. In a word, body and mind are inextricably\r\ninvolved in all that concerns not only health but good feeling, and\r\nthese two terms are practically convertible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling and Expression.--In nothing is the influence of the body on\r\nthe mind more clear than in the influence of expression upon the\r\ndisposition. Actors know that if they want to well express a certain\r\nfeeling, they must arouse that feeling deeply, and the easiest, surest\r\nand most direct method of doing so is to fix the features in the\r\nexpressions that would ordinarily indicate the presence within of\r\nthese feelings. If we insist on putting our features into the shape\r\nwhich ordinarily expresses sadness, that will be reflected internally,\r\nand we shall become as sad as our expression. On the other hand, if\r\nthe features are drawn, even by force of will, into the state that\r\nordinarily expresses joy or lightness of heart, we shall be tempted\r\nmore and more to feel that way, until at last even internal melancholy\r\nmay be dissipated. In the oldest book in the world, \"The Instruction\r\nof Ptah Hotep,\" written about 3,000 years before Christ, the old\r\nfather giving advice to his sons says: \"Let thy face be bright what\r\ntime thou livest,\" and the literature of every time since then\r\nemphasizes the same idea.\r\n\r\nThis influence of the expression on the mind is an extremely important\r\nelement in psychotherapy. Men and women must be taught to shake off\r\ninner sadness, and over-occupation of mind, by training their facial\r\nmuscles of expression as far as possible to occupy positions\r\nexpressive of good feeling, but above all not to let them be fixed in\r\npositions indicative of ill feeling. It makes a great difference for\r\nthe mental state whether a man has the corners of his mouth drawn down\r\nor up, or whether they are pulled straight across the face to give the\r\nsevere, austere expression that some people seem to cultivate. If the\r\ncorners of the mouth are allowed to droop the glumness and depression\r\nis likely to grow deeper. If the lips are curled upward and smile,\r\neven though it may be a forced smile, the inner feeling will soon\r\nyield to it. Actors are able to counterfeit the reality, but much more\r\nthan this, as we have said, they realize that, by imitating the\r\nexternals of the feeling, they awaken the feeling itself within them.\r\nThis is true for anger and loathing, and for many of the more serious\r\ndispositions as well as for those that might be thought more\r\nsuperficial, and hence more controlled by the external muscles.\r\n\r\n{102}\r\n\r\n_The Mouth_.--It is interesting to realize how different are the\r\nexpressions of the face as a consequence merely of control of the\r\nsphincter of the mouth and its associated muscles. Physiological\r\npsychologists have often called attention to the fact that only a few\r\nlines are necessary to picture the characteristic human expressions of\r\nsadness, joy and severity. If a little droop is given to the line that\r\nrepresents the lips, melancholy is at once expressed, while the upward\r\ncurve expresses joy, and the straight line severity. These types of\r\nhuman expression are easy to control, and the internal effect of each\r\nis soon felt where there is deliberate, or indeliberate, perseverance\r\nin its maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.  Three abstract faces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eyes_.--A typical example of the influence of the mind on the\r\nbody is to be found in the use of the eye muscles, especially the\r\noblique muscles. Of definite and important use for many purposes, they\r\nare especially employed to attract attention by means of the eyes.\r\nCoquetry has used them to express various phases of sex attraction. We\r\nall know the picture of the young woman who \"makes eyes.\" It is\r\ninteresting, however, to set solemn people imitating these exercises\r\nof the oblique eye muscles. For most people it is practically\r\nimpossible to use these muscles without a corresponding quasi-demure\r\nsetting of the features, commonly associated with those who use them\r\nmost. There is even likely to be a certain attitude of mind aroused\r\ncorresponding to the setting of the features in a particular way.\r\nWhile this is true for almost any other expressive state of the\r\ncountenance, it is not so easy to demonstrate as is this.\r\n\r\nThe use of the superior recti muscles has also a definite effect upon\r\nthe disposition. One of the pleasures of walking in a well-kept forest\r\nwhere the trees meet high overhead, is that the eyes are inevitably\r\nattracted upward to range among them, and there is a corresponding\r\nelevation of feeling. Bernard Shaw once said that it was impossible to\r\nenter a Gothic church without an elevation of the spirit, because the\r\neyes were surely attracted upward by the height of the nave, and a\r\ncorresponding uplift of feeling ensued. During a period of glumness it\r\nis apparently impossible to keep the eyes raised. People who are\r\ndepressed and \"cast down,\" as the expression is, invariably keep their\r\neyes downward, and just as soon as a man \"looks up and not down\" there\r\nis a lifting of the depression. Even such apparently trivial muscular\r\nactions as this may influence the mind, and thus react upon the\r\nphysical system generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wrinkles_.--Many influences of the body on the mind group themselves\r\nin the muscles of expression around the eyes. Wrinkles, for instance,\r\nare originally a habit of mind, and then the emphasis of this, in the\r\nmuscles of the face, is reflected back to deepen still further the\r\ndejection or nervous unrest that originally causes them. It is\r\nsurprising to see what an influence it has on patients who go round\r\nmuch with wrinkled foreheads, to have them give over the practice and\r\ndiscipline themselves to appear with uncorrugated superciliary\r\nmuscles. St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, and one of\r\n{103} the wisest managers of men that ever lived, has emphasized in\r\none of his rules that \"wrinkles on the forehead and still more on the\r\nnose\" are a sign of interior disquiet and must not be seen. He\r\nrealized that the interior feelings could be influenced by suggestion\r\nat least, by having those who indulged in wrinkles keep their\r\nforeheads and noses smooth. Most of the expression of the face is\r\nconcerned with the eyebrows and neighboring regions, and people should\r\noccasionally be asked to look at themselves in the glass, so as to rid\r\nthemselves of habits of expression indicative of a disturbed mind, for\r\nthis will do much to help to relieve the mental disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttitudes and the Mind.--With regard to the influence of the body on\r\nthe mind, and the stimulating mental reaction that follows even a pose\r\nof well-being and good feeling, perhaps nothing affords more striking\r\nevidence than the effect of assuming the expressions and attitudes\r\nusually associated with various states of mind and then noting the\r\nresults. If a man throws his shoulders back, and takes in long breaths\r\nof air, expanding his chest and stimulating his circulation, his whole\r\nbody as well as his mind feels the effect. A slow walk with bowed\r\nshoulders and head, while one moodily turns over all the possibilities\r\nfor ill in the life around, does very little good, while a brisk walk\r\nwith head thrown back, shoulders erect, brings a man home with mind\r\nand body both ready to throw off temporary obstacles of all kinds, and\r\nin addition to the fact that the mental depression has disappeared, to\r\nsome extent at least, all the physical functions will be accomplished\r\nbetter than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTears and Feeling.--Some of the usual translations of the meaning of\r\nexternal expressions are not justified by what we know of their actual\r\npurpose and effects. For instance, tears are supposed to be a sign of\r\ndeep grief. Except in the very young they are not, as a rule, to be\r\nthus understood. As we grow older they are much more frequently a sign\r\nof deep feeling that is usually quite pleasurable. It is almost\r\nimpossible for a human being to be touched deeply without a glistening\r\nof the eyes that readily runs over into tears. A mother who is proud\r\nof something that her children have done is quite sure to have tears\r\nin her eyes. If she is present at a successful musical or dramatic\r\nperformance given by a son or a daughter, especially where there is\r\nsomething of a triumph for them, she is sure to have tears in her\r\neyes. There are few mothers who fail to be moved in this way when\r\ntheir children take prizes, or when some one writes to tell them how\r\nwell their children are doing. Tears, indeed, far from being a sign of\r\nsadness, usually in adults indicate profound joy.\r\n\r\nTears, then, instead of being discouraged, should rather be\r\nencouraged, unless when indulged in to excess. We realize how trying\r\nto health and strength is the stony grief that does not melt into\r\ntears. The mother who faints over the sudden death of her child, and\r\nwho wakes to silent consciousness, is in a dangerous condition until\r\nthe solace of tears comes to her. Until there are tears, we fear for\r\nthe effect upon her mind of the grief. The sufferer from melancholia\r\nis sad, but a good outburst of tears will, indeed, often mean the end\r\nof a prolonged period of melancholia. In the trials of life tears are\r\na consolation rather than an addition to sorrow. In the olden times\r\nmen wept as well as women, and Homer's heroes thought it not at all\r\nbeneath their dignity to be seen in tears. Over and over again, the\r\nphysician learns that while people have been going to \"shows\" that\r\nwere supposed to make them {104} laugh and so divert their minds, the\r\nbest possible effect is derived not from trivial laughter, but from a\r\nserious play that touches the heart deeply and makes all who go to it\r\nmelt a little. Many nervous patients never feel better than after they\r\nhave had a good quiet cry.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the serious things of life in producing favorable\r\nstates of mind is not sufficiently appreciated, or at least has come\r\nto be neglected in our day. There is a seeking far and wide for\r\npleasure and diversion that should be obtained near home, through the\r\nsimple joys of domestic life or intimate contact with others who need\r\nus in some way. As has been well said, it is not far-fetched pleasure,\r\nbut simple joys that are more needed in our time. Nothing so enables\r\nthe patient to get his, and above all her, mind off self as care for\r\nothers. This must be expressed, however, in external acts accomplished\r\nby ourselves for others to have any deep effect. Doing things for\r\nother people deepens the feeling of sympathy, and so makes the mind\r\nmuch more ready to respond to increase of these feelings so profoundly\r\nas to displace selfish considerations. Exercise is valuable, but\r\nexercise undertaken for a worthy motive, constantly before the mind\r\nduring the time it is taken, means ever so much more in awakening all\r\nthe sources of energy that there are in men and women to make life\r\nworth living for themselves and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Principles.--The best possible source of relief from\r\nthat combination of mental despondency, and the lack of bodily\r\nvitality which so often accompanies it, and which, if not interrupted,\r\nmay lead to a serious breakdown of mental health, is the discipline of\r\nwork; above all, work for the benefit, of others, to which one forces\r\none's self gradually but persistently, not with, long intervals, but\r\nday after day. The discipline of the asylum and the sanatorium is\r\nprobably the most efficient curative agent when these cases are at\r\ntheir worst. When the symptoms are beginning, a discipline of a milder\r\ncharacter, yet resembling that of the institution, but appealing to\r\nhigher motives and leading to frequently repeated actions for the\r\nbenefit of others, will undoubtedly do much to prevent worse\r\ndevelopments or make the future condition of the patient less serious\r\nthan it would otherwise be. Undoubtedly some of the old monastic\r\nregulations were efficient in preventing the more serious developments\r\nof despondency when the danger to himself and others of the\r\nmelancholic was not so well recognized as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laughing Cures_.--Every now and then the newspapers announce that\r\nsome physician has invented a laughing cure, or a smiling cure, or\r\nsomething of the kind. Sometimes these reports are founded on actual\r\noccurrences; oftener, perhaps, they are the invention of a reporter\r\nsuffering from a dearth of news. There is, however, no doubt that a\r\nsmiling cure will do much to make people, even those who have serious\r\nreasons to be depressed, feel better. Every physician knows that if\r\nmelancholic patients of the milder type can be amused quietly, their\r\ndepression is modified for the better. Accordingly, we advise them to\r\nsee farces or lively comedy, and we try to pick out cheerful nurses\r\nfor them. The depression consequent upon some serious illness can be\r\nbetter relieved in this way than by any tonics or stimulants. For the\r\ndepression, for instance, that so often follows a stroke of apoplexy,\r\nthe employment of a nurse with a good human sense of humor and a large\r\nsympathy with the humorous side of things in life will do more to\r\narouse a man from the lethargy into which he settles than almost\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\nWith regard to laughing, there is, of course, another element that\r\nmust be remembered. A hearty laugh moves the diaphragm up and down\r\nvigorously, empties and ventilates the lungs, stimulates the heart\r\nmechanically by its action upon the intra-thoracic viscera, and is one\r\nof the best tonics that we have for the circulation in the abdominal\r\ncavity, and probably also for the important nervous mechanisms\r\ncentered there. Its action upon the lungs is readily recognized. Its\r\ninfluence upon the heart is usually not so much thought of, but\r\ndeserves even a more prominent place. It is now well known that when\r\npatients have gone into coma or the apneic condition that sometimes\r\nfollows shock, or the administration of an anesthetic, when the heart\r\nceases to beat, the only effectual means of resuscitation is by\r\ndirectly irritating the organ. It has been suggested that if the\r\nabdominal cavity is open the surgeon's hands should be passed up and\r\nshould squeeze the heart through the diaphragm. It has even been\r\nproclaimed that tapping on the chest vigorously over the precordium\r\nmay arouse a heart that has for the moment stopped beating. It is easy\r\nto understand, then, that a hearty laugh, by stirring up all the\r\nintra-thoracic viscera, stimulates the heart mechanically and sets it\r\nbeating more vigorously than before. This is one of the reasons why\r\npeople feel so well after a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\nEven slight swallows of water act as a distinct heart stimulant. When\r\npeople have fainted, a succession of swallows of water, each of them\r\nacting as a heart tonic, is one of the best methods that we have of\r\nstimulating the heart's action. It is usually said that this action is\r\na consequence of the reflex from the terminal filaments of the vagus\r\nnerve running back and reflected down again to the heart. To me it has\r\nalways seemed that the swallowing action had a direct mechanical\r\neffect upon the heart, because the esophagus passes so close to it in\r\nthe thoracic cavity.\r\n\r\nMan is the only animal that laughs, and, as the old philosophers point\r\nout, he might very well be defined as _animal risibile_ with just as\r\nmuch truth as by the words _animal rationale_. It requires reason in\r\norder to have a sense of humor. The higher the reason, the more the\r\nhumor. Peasants and the uneducated have, as a rule, a very undeveloped\r\nsense of humor. It is the highly educated man of deep intellectual\r\npowers who catches all the humor of a situation, and, though his\r\nexpression of it may not be loud, it is deep and helpful at moments of\r\ndepression. Humor is, of course, very different from wit, which is\r\nbiting and which seems almost to be shared by the animals, if we can\r\njudge from the fact that they appear, occasionally, to play practical\r\njokes upon one another.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost absurd that a physician should tell patients that it\r\nwill do them good to practice smiling, to take every possible\r\nopportunity to laugh, and even to take frequent glances into a looking\r\nglass, to see that they are not pulling long faces. The difference\r\nbetween a feeling of melancholy and one of gladness consists mainly in\r\nthe position of the outer angles of the mouth. The putting into\r\npractice of the maxim, not to let the sad lines dominate the\r\ncountenance, but to insist on keeping the others there as far as\r\npossible, means much for the correction of internal feelings of\r\ndepression and discouragement that may be badly interfering with the\r\nflow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nMouth Breathing.--Since Meyer's discovery of the overgrowth of the\r\n{106} lymphoid tissue in the pharynx, we have learned to appreciate\r\nhow important is mouth breathing, even for the intellectual life. We\r\nall knew before, and indeed from time immemorial it was well\r\nunderstood, that, as a rule, people who went around with their mouths\r\nopen were of low grade intelligence. All sorts of methods were used to\r\nteach these young people to keep their mouths shut. They were reminded\r\nof it at home, they were told about it at school, and, if they\r\nmarried, their wives tried to keep them from this apparent\r\nmanifestation of lack of intelligence. Of course, they were not, as a\r\nrule, able to carry out the well-meant intentions of their friends and\r\nadvisors. The mouths were kept open because they could not breathe\r\nnormally through their noses, and so respiration had to be\r\naccomplished by the only other available avenue. As a consequence of\r\nthe open mouth, the lips were inclined to roll out somewhat, and\r\ncertain indications of the human physiognomy were supposed to be\r\nassociated with these thick lips.\r\n\r\nNow we know the real meaning of the condition. Mouth breathing is\r\npossible, but it is inadequate. Insufficient respiration leads to\r\ninsufficient oxidation of tissues, and to lowered vitality in all\r\nstructures, and this is particularly notable in the brain, as well as\r\nin certain other higher structures. It is not because the individuals\r\nare lacking in intelligence that their mouths are open, but because\r\nthe same reason that compels the open mouth also affects their\r\nintellectual activity. The blocking of nasal respiration lowers vital\r\nactivity of all kinds. Hence the lowered intellectual vitality. The\r\nthick lips, which are supposed to be characteristic of a certain\r\npassionateness of nature, and which usually are associated with a lack\r\nof thorough control over animal inclinations, probably owe their\r\nsignificance to the fact that this special peculiarity of feature\r\nusually accompanies mouth breathing, and that the individual who\r\nlabors under this deficient respiration, is likely to lack control to\r\nat least some degree. There is even a question whether the deficient\r\noxidation is not likely to be much more notable in its effect upon the\r\nhigher faculties than on the lower, and as a consequence the latter\r\ndevelop somewhat to the detriment of the former.\r\n\r\nThese studies in physiognomy may, indeed, be correlated in many ways\r\nwith distinct physical conditions instead of as formerly with the\r\ngeneral constitution of the individual. For instance, large protruding\r\neyes used to be said to be characteristic of nervous, timid, sensitive\r\nindividuals, easily scared, and not well able to take up the harder\r\nparts of the battle of life. Now we know that this feature is usually\r\nassociated with an excess of secretion of the thyroid gland, and that\r\nthe nervousness is not a matter of character so much as it is due to\r\nthe disturbance of internal metabolism consequent upon this\r\ninterference with the proper function of an important organ. It might\r\nwell be called a slight thyroid intoxication. In large amounts it\r\nproduces all the symptoms of Graves' disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nBodily Conditions and Stupidity.--We have many illustrations of the\r\ninfluence of the body on the mind, when purely physical causes work\r\nrather serious results on disposition and character and energy. A\r\ntypical example was the so-called tropical anemia which existed in\r\nPorto Rico when the Americans took possession of the island. There\r\nwere so many cases of it that out of about 25,000 deaths reported in\r\n1903, nearly 6,000 were from so-called anemia. Investigation of the\r\nconditions soon revealed the real cause. It had been {107} thought to\r\nbe due to a combination of the climate, malaria and the lack of\r\nnutrition on the part of the country people. The people were\r\nabsolutely without ambition, they had no energy, they seemed scarcely\r\nable to keep body and soul together, and they cared for nothing except\r\nto get just enough to supply them with a meager sustenance. Of\r\nincentive to lift themselves up, there was none. This was largely\r\nattributed by the first Americans who went to the island to the\r\nconditions which had existed under Spanish rule, as the Spaniards had\r\nnot encouraged manufactures or industries in the island, and had left\r\nthe people without any incentives to the awakening of enterprise or\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hook-Worm Disease_.--Before long it was found that the real reason\r\nfor the anemia of the Porto Ricans was the presence in their\r\nintestines in large numbers of the so-called hook-worm. These worms\r\nexhausted the vitality of the sufferers and left them without surplus\r\nenergy and, indeed, with scarcely enough life to care whether or not\r\nlife itself continued. It was not a moral condition, but a very\r\ndefinite physical cause that was at work. Shortly afterwards it was\r\nfound that the same disease existed in our Southern states among the\r\nso-called \"poor whites.\" Before this, these people had been supposed\r\nto be a characterless, unambitious, lazy people, who cared not to get\r\non, who had sunk to about the lowest depths possible for civilized\r\npeople, and who were quite satisfied to remain there. The discovery of\r\nhook-worm disease among them, however, soon made it clear that their\r\nlaziness was the result of the drain upon their systems due to the\r\npresence of thousands of hook-worms. When these were removed, if\r\nnature was not already exhausted, the \"poor whites\" became normal\r\nhuman beings once more with ambition and initiative.\r\n\r\nThis story of pathology influencing racial qualities is not new in the\r\nhistory of the world. It is not improbable that even certain periods\r\nof decadence in Egyptian history which have ordinarily been attributed\r\nto the so-called running out of particular ruling races or families,\r\nor to the degeneration of the people consequent upon luxury, were\r\nreally the result of the spread of the hook-worm disease through\r\ncertain portions of Egypt. Dr. Sandwith, who has studied the disease\r\nvery carefully in Egypt, is sure that it has existed there for at\r\nleast four thousand years, and that the descriptions of certain\r\naffections which occurred in Egypt in historic times were really due\r\nto the same cause as now is known to produce the so-called Egyptian\r\nchlorosis, the name that was used for hook-worm disease in Egypt.\r\nWorkers in soil, and in mines and in tunnels, are especially likely to\r\nbe affected by it, and whenever it is neglected it spreads rather\r\nwidely, as is seen in the mines of Germany and Hungary at the present\r\ntime. As the cause was unrecognized in the olden time, it is possible\r\nthat periods of supposed lassitude among the people were really due to\r\ninfection by this parasite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malaria and Degeneration_.--In recent years it has come to be\r\ngenerally recognized that the decadence of Greece, for instance, was\r\nnot due to moral causes so much, perhaps, as to physical reasons.\r\nDuring the classic periods in Greece there are no traces of malaria.\r\nAfter the invasion of Sicily, the expedition against Syracuse and\r\nother attempts on the part of the cities of Greece to spread their\r\ndominion, malaria seems to have been introduced among her people, and\r\nas the _anopheles_ mosquito was already there, the malaria spread\r\nwidely, and in the course of a century affected so many of the people\r\nthat their energy and ambition and initiative were to a great extent\r\ndestroyed. {108} It is well known that these effects often occur as a\r\nconsequence of malaria, and as generation after generation is affected\r\nby the disease, are emphasized more and more. The relaxing effect of\r\ntropical climates, of which we have heard so much, and which is\r\nsupposed after a time to bring about the inevitable production of a\r\nrace eminently lazy and careless of the future, is probably much more\r\ndue to certain affections, such as malaria and those consequent upon\r\nanimal parasites, than to any constitutional change that has taken\r\nplace in the body, or any profound corresponding change in the mind.\r\nIt is a case of the body influencing the mind and producing an\r\napparently different race from that which existed before, though all\r\nthis may be changed for the better by some even slight amelioration of\r\nbodily conditions.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt, then, to influence the human mind in order to use its\r\npower and its reserve energy for therapeutic purposes, the place of\r\nthe body and its influence upon the mind must always be remembered. It\r\nis quite impossible to lift people up to enable them to use their\r\nmental reserve force if they are living in discouraging physical\r\nconditions, which use up so much of energy as to make it impossible to\r\nhave any to spare. Many of the phases of mental discouragement and\r\nlack of initiative which are reflected in what we call lowered\r\nresistive vitality and lack of immunity to infection, are really\r\nconsequent upon physical states representing a drain upon the system\r\nthat can be removed, or at least greatly improved, if they are\r\ndiscovered and properly treated. Victims of chronic malaria and of\r\nhook-worm disease cannot be lifted up by psychotherapy. Neither can\r\nsufferers from other forms of chronic physical debility. After the\r\nremoval of the debilitating cause, however, mental influence may be\r\nbrought to bear to encourage them to rise to their opportunities, to\r\nliterally take on new life, and gradually accumulate reserve energy\r\nthat will enable them to accomplish, not only the average work of\r\nmankind, but even better, in the reaction that comes with the new\r\nfeeling of physical energy. And what is thus true in these extreme\r\ncases is even more true of minor ailments and conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANISM OF THE INFLUENCE OF MIND ON BODY\r\n\r\nThe question as to how mind influences body, and body mind, has always\r\nproved a riddle to all but those with a special theory in the matter.\r\nThe facts of the mutual influence of mind on body are so obtruded on\r\nobservation that they could never be missed, but it is quite another\r\nthing to reach a satisfactory explanation of them. How the will\r\ninitiates motion continues in spite of all our advance in psychology,\r\nto be as much a mystery as ever. Just how sensation is transformed\r\ninto ideas is a parallel mystery. Since the mind is able to influence\r\nmotion, it is not surprising that it should be capable of modifying\r\nsecretion or inhibiting other kinds of functions. Any of these various\r\nactivities is scarcely more mysterious than the other. Since the\r\ntransformation of sensation into thought takes place, it is\r\ncomparatively easy to conclude that the mental processes are able to\r\nexclude, or to some extent inhibit, sensation. All these activities\r\nhave actually been observed. How does this mutual influence of mind on\r\nbody take place? What principles underlie it?\r\n\r\n{109}\r\n\r\nAt present, it would be futile to hope to outline the absolute\r\nprinciples on which the mechanism of mental influence or suggestion\r\ndepends, but we can discuss recent explanations that have been\r\noffered, and this will help us to understand, not the mystery itself,\r\nbut just where the mystery lies and what the physical mechanism\r\nconnected with it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.--CORTEX OF HUMAN BRAIN ILLUSTRATING\r\n  COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEMS AND PLEXUSES OF NERVE FIBERS (Combination\r\n  of the methods of Weigert and Golgi--after Andriezen). _c, z.,_\r\n  clear zone free from nerve fibers; _M.P.,_ Exner's plexus in the\r\n  molecular layer; _A. str.,_ ambiguous cell stratum; _Subm, P.,_\r\n  sub-molecular plexus; _Gt.

(Barker.) ]\r\n\r\n\r\n{110}\r\n\r\nThese explanations are as yet only theoretic, but theories have often\r\nhelped students in science to make their thoughts more concrete and\r\ntheir investigations more practical. It would be a mistake to conclude\r\nthat because some of the theories advanced are very plausible, we\r\nhave, therefore, reached definite truth with regard to the mechanics\r\nof the brain that underlie suggestion and mental influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain Complexity.--The most interesting feature of the discoveries in\r\nbrain anatomy during the past generation, has been that the central\r\nnervous system is of even greater complexity than had been thought.\r\nBecause of this, these new discoveries, instead of solving the\r\nbiological mystery they subtend, or even helping very much to solve\r\nit, have made it still harder to understand just how we succeed in\r\ncontrolling and directing this immensely complex machine, of whose\r\ndetails we are utterly unconscious, yet which we learn to use with\r\nsuch discriminating nicety of adjustment and accomplishment. The\r\ndiscoveries of Golgi and of Ramon y Cajal show us that the brain\r\nconsists of nerve cells with a number of ramifying fibers connecting\r\neach cell and each group of cells with other simple and compound\r\nelements of the brain, and sending down connecting fibers to every\r\norgan and every part of the body. Dr. Ford Robertson calculates that\r\nin an average human brain there are at least three billions of cells.\r\nWithout knowing anything of their existence, much less anything of the\r\ninfinite detail of their structure and mode of operation, we have\r\nlearned to use these for many purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED PYRAMIDAL CELLS OF\r\n  THE VISUAL CORTEX OF A CHILD TWENTY DAYS OLD.

They serve to emphasize the much more\r\n  pronounced condition which develops in the adult.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNerve Impulses.--We do not know even how nerve impulses travel.\r\nProbably they do so by a mode of vibration, just as heat and light and\r\nelectricity are transmitted as modes of motion. The similarity that\r\nused to be thought to exist between the transmission of nerve impulses\r\nand of electrical energy is now known definitely to be only an\r\nanalogy, and not to represent anything closer. Waves of nervous energy\r\ntravel at a different rate of speed from electrical waves, and there\r\nare other notable differences. Such phases as molecular action, or\r\nmotion, or vibration are only cloaks for our ignorance, A generation\r\nago Huxley declared that \"the forces exerted by living matter are\r\neither identical with those existing in the inorganic world or are\r\nconvertible into them.\" He instanced nervous energy as the most\r\nrecondite of all, and {111} yet as being in some way or other\r\nassociated with the electrical processes of living beings. As Prof,\r\nForel said in his \"Hygiene of the Nerves,\" \"the neurokym cannot be a\r\nsimple physical wave, such as electricity, light or sound; if it were\r\nits exceedingly fine weak waves would soon exhaust themselves without\r\ncausing the tremendous discharges which they actually call forth in\r\nthe brain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw of Avalanche.--How great is the power of the nervous system or the\r\nenergy of it that may be set loose by some very simple reflex, as\r\nsuggested by Forel, is illustrated by what Ramon y Cajal calls the Law\r\nof Avalanche. A single peripheral nerve ending is represented in many\r\ndifferent portions of the brain. An ocular nerve ending, for instance,\r\nprobably has direct connection with four or more portions of each\r\nhemisphere. Each of these portions of the brain has association fibers\r\nconnecting it with other parts and so the stirring of a single nerve\r\nending may disturb many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of\r\nbrain cells; at least it affects them in some way or other. The older\r\npsychologists used to insist on the similarity, or analogy, between\r\nthe cosmos ol the universe and the microcosmos that man is. The\r\nEnglish poet of the nineteenth century told us that there is no\r\nmoving of a flower without the stirring of a star, so intimately\r\nconnected by the laws of gravitation is the universe. In the microcosm\r\nsomething of this same thing is true and a titillation of even the\r\nmost trivial nerve ending may produce, in Ramon y Cajal's phrase, \"an\r\navalanche\" of cell disturbances in the central nervous system which\r\nmay seriously disturb the whole system.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus true for the brain is true, also, for the cord, and the\r\ncomplexity of spinal cells needs to be seen to be properly realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.--SERIES OF SECTIONS SHOWING THE FINE NERVE\r\n  ENDINGS AND BRANCHINGS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND LAYER OF THE VISUAL\r\n  CORTEX OF A CHILD FIFTEEN DAYS OLD.

(Ramon\r\n  y Cajal.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychic States.--There are a number of human states representing\r\nextremes of sensory and intellectual conditions in man, that have\r\nalways attracted attention, and in recent years have been special\r\nobjects of investigation by physiologists. Natural sleep is one of\r\nthese; the unconsciousness of narcotism or anesthesia is another.\r\nHypnotism is allied to both of these, and would seem to lie on a plane\r\nbetween them. Then there are various states of exaltation in which\r\nsensations fail to produce their usual effect. Those {112} escaping\r\nfrom a fire, or passing through a severe panic of any kind may sustain\r\nall manner of injuries without being aware of them. Martyrs, for all\r\nmanner of causes, are able to withstand suffering with such\r\nequanimity, and sometimes even joy, that it is evident that they\r\ncannot feel, as would people under ordinary conditions, the pain that\r\nis being inflicted on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.--FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD LAYER OF THE\r\n  ANTERIOR CENTRAL CONVOLUTION (THAT IS, OF THE ASCENDING FRONTAL\r\n  CONVOLUTION) OF THE BRAIN OF A CHILD ONE MONTH OLD.

(Barker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurons.--With the advance in our knowledge of brain anatomy, various\r\nexplanations for these curious conditions have been suggested. The\r\ndiscovery that the central nervous system is composed of a large\r\nnumber of separate units, and not of a feltwork of continuous fibers\r\nwith cells here and there, revolutionized all previous attempts at\r\nexplanation of these conditions. We know now that it is not fibers but\r\ncells that are the most important components of the brain and\r\nspinal-cord substance, and that, indeed, the fibers are only\r\nprolongations of cells. The central nervous system is made up of nerve\r\ncells with various appendages, and each one of these cells and its\r\nappendages is called a neuron. These appendages are of two kinds, one\r\nthe axon, the long conducting fiber which transmits the nerve force of\r\nthe cell, the other the dendrons or connecting elements by which the\r\ncell is linked with the axon of another cell. The contact of the axon\r\nof one neuron with the dendrons of another is called a synapse. Each\r\nneuron does not extend to and from the brain and the periphery, but\r\nseries of neurons connect the surface of the body with the brain.\r\nThere is usually a group of neurons in the path from the surface to\r\nthe brain cortex. The peripheral neuron for sensation runs from the\r\nsurface of the body to the spinal cord, while for motion it runs in\r\nthe opposite direction. There is a secondary neuron in each chain that\r\nruns up or down the spinal cord to and from the base of the brain. A\r\nthird--sometimes, perhaps, a fourth--neuron connects in the two\r\ndirections, afferent and efferent, the cortex and the base of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neuronic Movement_.--Duval, the French anatomist and histologist,\r\nsuggested the possibility of voluntary and involuntary movement in the\r\nneurons or nerve cells themselves, thus making and breaking\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--SCHEME OF THE VISUAL CONDUCTION PATHS (after\r\n  C. von Monakow). a, rods and cones; b, rods; c, nuclei of rods; d,\r\n  bipolar cells for the cones; e, bipolar cells for the rods; f, large\r\n  multipolar ganglion cells giving rise to the axons of the N.\r\n  opticus; g, centrifugal axon of a neuron, the cell body of which is\r\n  situated in the collieulus superior, its telodendron being situated\r\n  in the retina; h, Golgi cell of Type II, or dendraxon in the corpus\r\n  geniculatum laterale; i, neuron connecting the corpus geniculatum\r\n  laterale with the lobus occipitalis, its axon running in the radiato\r\n  occipito-thalamica (Gratioleti).

(Barker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to his suggestion, sleep would be due to a separation of the\r\nneurons that run from the surface of the body to the brain cortex,\r\nbecause the various neurons had become too tired for further function.\r\nAs a consequence of fatigue, their terminal filaments would fall away\r\nfrom one another, external sensations would no longer be communicated\r\nto the brain, because the peripheral neuron was not connected with the\r\nnext in the chain. As a further result, the brain, undisturbed by\r\nsensations, would be left at rest so far as the body was concerned.\r\nWithin the brain certain connections through which flow thoughts that\r\nwould keep us awake, are also supposed on this theory to be broken,\r\nand consequently all the nerve cells have a chance to rest, except, of\r\ncourse, those concerned with such very vital functions as heart\r\nmovement, respiration and peristalsis.\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--ISOLATED CELL FROM HUMAN SPINAL CORD\r\n  (Obersteiner).]\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow, these vital neurons obtain their rest in the intervals\r\nbetween the impulses which they send down, just as cardiac cells do\r\nbetween heart beats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neurons in Psychic States_.--This same explanation would serve for\r\nnarcosis, that is, for anesthesia, due to chloroform or ether, or any\r\nother drug. As a consequence of the effect of the narcotic upon the\r\ncentral neuron, they are brought into a condition resembling fatigue,\r\nat least to the extent of breaking their connections with other\r\nneurons so long as they are under the influence of the drug. While\r\nsensory nerves at the periphery, then, are being stimulated by the\r\ncutting of tissues to which they are attached, the message from them\r\ndoes not reach the brain because of a disturbance of the connections\r\nin the chain of neurons. Drunkenness illustrates the same phenomenon\r\nin a less degree. The effect of the intoxicant upon the central\r\nneurons disturbs sensation because it makes the connection much less\r\ncomplete than before, and so it is easy to understand the familiar\r\noccurrence of even severe injuries to drunken men without their being\r\naware of them, or at least without their suffering nearly so much as\r\nwould be the case if they were not intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypnotism_.--The same theory would also hold for the phenomena\r\nobserved in hypnotism. After all, the best explanation of hypnotism\r\nthat we have is that there is a turning inward of the patient's\r\nattention, so that only those sensations are allowed to reach the\r\nbrain to which mental attention has already been called by suggestion.\r\nHypnotism usually begins with a certain fatigue of peripheral neurons\r\nuntil these do not act normally, and then the cerebral neurons become,\r\nas it were, short-circuited on themselves with a consequent internal\r\nconcentration of attention. The anesthesia so often noted in hypnotic\r\nor hysterical states is explained by the same theory. For the time\r\nbeing, at least, the connection between the peripheral neurons and the\r\ncentral neurons is broken or but imperfectly made, and conduction does\r\nnot take place, or is hampered. There may be loss of motion as well as\r\nof sensation, or of motion without sensation. In all these cases, the\r\ndiscontinuity of the nervous system enables us to understand more\r\nreadily the mechanism by which these curious phenomena occur.\r\nExaltation or intense interest or profound preoccupation may so\r\nconcentrate nervous energy within the nerve centers themselves as to\r\ninhibit the flow of sensory impulses from without and thus enable\r\n{118} people to stand pain and fatigue that would otherwise seem quite\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unconsciousness_.--The unconsciousness due to apoplexy, or to a blow\r\non the head, would be comparatively easy of explanation on the same\r\ntheory. The hemorrhage would actually push certain neurons apart\r\nwithin the skull, or the intracranial pressure produced by it would\r\nkeep them from making proper connections. A blow on the head may\r\nreadily be supposed to jar neuronic terminal filaments so severely\r\nthat it would be some time before connections could be made, and the\r\ninjury might be serious enough to prevent certain cells from ever\r\nagain coming in contact in such a way as to allow the passage of nerve\r\nimpulses from one to the other. Concussion of the brain would, on this\r\ntheory, mean that neurons were so shaken apart as to produce some\r\nconfusion in their terminal filaments and consequent serious\r\ndisturbances of consciousness, if not its complete loss, and\r\ncorresponding disturbance of the power to move. In a word, this theory\r\nwould seem to afford a reasonably satisfactory explanation for most of\r\nthe extraordinary phenomena of mental life and, therefore, might also\r\nbe expected to be applicable to the ordinary phenomena, though these\r\nare so elusive that it is difficult to satisfactorily apply theories\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--NEURON FROM THE OPTIC LOBE OF THE EMBRYO\r\n  CHICK (after Koelliker).

(Barker.) ]\r\n\r\n_Tired States_.--When fatigued, it becomes extremely difficult for us\r\nto follow a train of thought, especially if it is somewhat intricate.\r\nIt becomes easy to forget things, even such as under ordinary\r\ncircumstances would be readily remembered. Names are much more likely\r\nto be forgotten. Facts and, above all, dates, refuse to come as they\r\ndo under normal conditions. Efforts in the direction of recalling\r\ndetails are eminently unsatisfactory. The command goes forth, but\r\nthere is {119} evidently hesitation about obedience. Other thoughts\r\nintrude themselves. Ideas come unbidden. The connection of thought is\r\nreadily broken, and is hard to get at again. There may have been very\r\nlittle mental work, but somehow the fatigue of the general physical\r\nsystem is reflected through our central nervous system on the mind as\r\nwell as the body. The early morning hours are the best for mental\r\nwork, not, it seems, because the mind is fresher after its rest, but\r\nrather because the physical factors that are important for mental\r\naction are in good condition. Later they become disturbed by the\r\nfatigues of the day. The delicate cells of the brain become fatigued\r\nby sympathy with the somatic cells and it is harder to secure those\r\nnervous connections necessary for thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--DEEP LAYER OF GIANT PYRAMIDAL CELLS OF THE\r\n  POSTERIOR CENTRAL OR ASCENDING PARIETAL, CONVOLUTION OF A CHILD\r\n  THIRTY DAYS OLD. a, axis-cylinder; c, collateral branch; d, long\r\n  basilar dendrites; e, end tuft.

At least during certain states of the mind, they are moved\r\nand seem to have an inherent, if not quite voluntary, power {120} of\r\nmotion. There are many objections urged against the theory because of\r\nthis neuronic motion. It has been said that the movement of neurons\r\nhas been observed in certain of the _Medusae_. The observation has\r\nbeen doubted and it lacks confirmation. In higher animals, of course,\r\nthe observation is impossible because an investigation of the nervous\r\nsystem for this purpose would necessarily bring about the death of the\r\nanimal and the cessation of spontaneous mobility. Whether it occurs or\r\nnot, therefore, is a theoretic problem. So many objections tell\r\nagainst Duval's theory that it is now only discussed because of its\r\nsubjective value.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuroglia Theory.--Ramon y Cajal elaborated a second theory of\r\nexplanation for the mechanism of the nervous system that has seemed to\r\nmany authorities in brain physiology much more satisfactory than\r\nDuval's theory of the actual motion of the neurons themselves. The\r\nSpanish nervous histologist had made a special study of the neuroglia\r\nor connective tissue cells in the central nervous system. These are\r\nvery small in size but very numerous. Ramon y Cajal suggested that it\r\nwas because the terminal filaments of these neuroglia cells inserted\r\nthemselves between the neuronic filaments, thus insulating one from\r\nanother, somewhat as if an insulating plug were inserted between two\r\nportions of an electric circuit, that the interruption of nervous\r\ncurrents took place. This explanation is free from many of the\r\nobjections urged against Duval's theory.\r\n\r\nThe small size of the neuroglia cells makes it easy to understand how\r\nmovement may take place in them sufficient to bring about separation\r\nof neurons. It would not be surprising if they should be more or less\r\nactively contractile. Whenever they contract, neuronic filaments which\r\nthey have been holding apart, come together so as to permit the\r\npassage of nervous impulses, if any are flowing at the time. When the\r\nneuroglia cells become fatigued or seriously disturbed, they refuse\r\nany longer to obey the will in any way, or at least gradually get\r\nbeyond control, and in their relaxation becoming prolonged, push\r\nneurons apart. When a man is very tired it gradually becomes\r\nimpossible for him to keep awake. This is partly because poisons,\r\nproduced in the course of fatigue, exhaust the vitality of the\r\nneuroglia cells and also of the neurons, so that less energy is\r\nrequired to push these latter apart.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the neuroglia cells might well become\r\naffected by the various narcotics and intoxicants in such a way as to\r\nproduce the phenomena of anesthesia and drunkenness. The rapid\r\nrecovery from anesthetics seems to indicate that it is not neurons, or\r\nessential nerve cells, that are so deeply affected, but some\r\nextraneous, and less important, mechanism within the brain. The\r\nneuroglia theory explains this very well and does away with the\r\ndifficulty. Certain curious phenomena of hysteria are easily explained\r\non this theory. When there is anesthesia in a member because of\r\nhysteria, this anesthesia does not follow the distribution of certain\r\nnerves, but is limited by a line in the shape of a cuff drawn round\r\nthe limb. This indicates that the trouble is not peripheral but\r\ncentral, and that owing to psychic disturbance, all the neurons that\r\nreceive sensory impulses from a particular portion of the body are so\r\naffected by a psychic condition that they are no longer capable of\r\nreceiving impulses from the periphery. The neuroglia cells in a\r\nparticular area have passed from the control of the will and, relaxing\r\nthemselves, have {121} inserted their processes between the terminal\r\nfilaments of neurons, thus preventing conduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--NEUROGLIA CELLS OR THE FASCIA DENTATA; IN\r\n  THE NEW-BORN RABBIT (method of Golgi).

(Ramon y Cajal.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Neuroglia_.--The connective tissue cells are of many\r\nkinds, each probably exercising a special function. Ramon y Cajal has\r\ndescribed and pictured a special kind of neuroglia cells for the gray\r\nand another for the white matter. In his description of these cells he\r\nhas pointed out many interesting diversities of form, and probably\r\nalso of function. He has also described particularly a special form of\r\nneuroglia cells which lie close to the blood vessels. These he calls\r\nperivascular cells, and they seem to have an important function in\r\nregulating the amount of blood that goes to a particular part of the\r\nbrain. He has written so clearly and yet so concisely with regard to\r\nthese that it seems better to cite his own words:   [Footnote 15]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: This article is a translation made by the author shortly\r\n    after a visit to Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, in 1900. See _International\r\n    Clinics_, Phila., Vol. II Series Eleventh.]\r\n\r\n  Under the term neuroglia are included at least three kinds of\r\n  cells,--those of the white brain substance, those of the gray\r\n  substance, and the perivascular cells, which have been described by\r\n  Golgi. The neuroglia cells of the white brain material are easily\r\n  recognizable, being large and with rather prominent, smooth, and\r\n  sharply outlined processes. As my brother seems to have shown, their\r\n  object appears to be to furnish an insulating, or, at least, a badly\r\n  conducting, substance to serve as an interrupter of nerve-currents.\r\n  They certainly do not represent interstices of true nerve substance\r\n  through which lymphatic fluid can conveniently find its way.\r\n\r\n  The neuroglia cells of the gray matter present a very special and\r\n  highly characteristic appearance. They are of manifold form,--at\r\n  times star-shaped, at times {122} like a comet drawn out in length.\r\n  These are the tall cells of von Retzius. They have very numerous\r\n  prolongations, with a large number of short branched collaterals\r\n  which give the whole cell the appearance of having feathers\r\n  projecting from its periphery. These cells have been observed in two\r\n  different conditions. One is that of relaxation, and the picture is\r\n  that given above. The other is that of contraction, during which the\r\n  cell body has more protoplasm in it, and the processes become\r\n  shorter and thicker, and some of the secondary branches disappear\r\n  entirely. These cells resemble, in certain ways at least, the\r\n  pigment cells which occur in the skin of some animals. By means of\r\n  their contractility, these pigment cells can stretch out their\r\n  processes while in a state of contraction. It must be remembered\r\n  that this form of neuroglia cells is most abundantly present in\r\n  those parts of the brain in which it might be expected that a number\r\n  of nerve currents would frequently come together. They occur, for\r\n  example, with special frequency in the molecular layer of the\r\n  cerebral cortex, where the bundle of pyramidal fibers, with their\r\n  immense number of terminal nerve-endings, come in contact with one\r\n  another.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--NEUROGLIA CELL FROM THE SUBCORTICAL LAYER\r\n    OF THE CEREBRUM FROM WHICH TWO PROCESSES GO TO A BLOOD VESSEL\r\n    (Obersteiner).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--NEUROGLIA CELLS FROM THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n    Longitudinal section (Obersteiner). ]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The third form of neuroglia cells consists of those known as the\r\n  perivascular cells. They are found only in the neighborhood of the\r\n  capillaries of the gray matter and they send one or more firm\r\n  prolongations to the outer surface of the endothelium of the blood\r\n  vessels.\r\n\r\n  These processes are inserted in the walls of the blood vessels.\r\n  Every capillary has thousands of these little pseudopod\r\n  prolongations, and from the vessel the cell reaches out in a number\r\n  of directions. The object of these cells undoubtedly is by\r\n  contraction of the prolongations to bring about local dilatation of\r\n  the blood vessels. This dilatation of the blood vessels causes\r\n  greater or less intensity of the psychical processes in certain\r\n  parts of the brain, because of the greater or less congestion of the\r\n  circulation in a part which it produces.\r\n\r\n  With the exception of these last cells the object of the neuroglia\r\n  cells is to insulate nerve fibrils and cells from one another. When\r\n  the cells are relaxed, the passage of a nerve current is either\r\n  entirely prevented or rendered much less easy than before. It is in\r\n  this way that the true nature of intellectual rest is explained.\r\n  Sleep--not only natural sleep, but also artificial narcosis, such as\r\n  is produced by narcotics, hypnotics or hypnotization--is evidently\r\n  the result of the same conditions.\r\n\r\n  During the state of contraction the pseudopod of the neuroglia cells\r\n  are drawn in; that is to say, the protoplasm of the cells absorbs\r\n  the processes, and so the true nerve cells and nerve fibrils which\r\n  were separated from each other by the interposition of neuroglia\r\n  come into contact. By this mechanism the brain passes from the\r\n  condition of rest into one of activity. These neuroglia contractions\r\n  may, particularly in certain parts of the brain, occur\r\n  automatically. Often, however, they are produced by the action of\r\n  the will, which, in this manner is able to influence {123} the\r\n  definite groups of neuroglia cells. As the result of this influence\r\n  of the will the association of intellectual operations can be guided\r\n  in various directions. The unusual course that the association of\r\n  ideas sometimes takes, the flow of words and of thoughts at certain\r\n  moments, the passing difficulty of speech, the recurrence of\r\n  tormenting thoughts, the disappearance of expressions or ideas from\r\n  the memory, even the increase of mental activity and of every kind\r\n  of motor reaction as well as many other phenomena of intellection,\r\n  can be satisfactorily explained on this hypothesis. It is only\r\n  necessary to suppose that in certain parts of the brain the\r\n  neuroglia cells are at rest, while at other parts they are in a\r\n  condition of active contraction.\r\n\r\n  To put it all in a few words, the neuroglia cells of the gray\r\n  substance of the brain represent an insulating and switching\r\n  apparatus for nerve currents. They are an insulation apparatus when\r\n  in a state of contraction, a switching and insulating apparatus when\r\n  in a state of rest. It is to be remarked, then, that according to\r\n  this theory the contraction of brain cells does not take place, as\r\n  in Duval's theory, during intellectual rest, but, on the contrary,\r\n  during the state of activity of the cerebral cortex. It is much more\r\n  probable that the action of cells coincides with the active stage of\r\n  intellection than that brain cellular activity--that is,\r\n  contraction--should correspond with psychic rest.\r\n\r\nThe application of some of these theories enables us to understand\r\njust how short-circuiting may come about, how many of the curious\r\nphenomena of memory happen, and what are the effects, as well as the\r\ncauses, of attention and distraction of attention and of diversion of\r\nmind. It is particularly the latter portion of Ramon y Cajal's theory,\r\nwith regard to attention and the more or less voluntary though\r\nunconscious and usually indeliberate control of blood supply to\r\nvarious portions of the brain, that is of special interest. If the\r\nneuroglia cells, whose end plates are attached to blood-vessel walls,\r\nbecome over-contracted or lose their power of relaxation or of\r\ncontraction, many of the curious phenomena of over-tiredness in\r\nneurotic conditions, and the lack of the power of concentration, and\r\nsufficient attention to things, can be readily understood. In a word,\r\nthe theory enables us to translate many expressions that are vague and\r\nindefinite, from terms of mind into terms of the physical basis of\r\nmind--the anatomy and physiology of the brain.\r\n\r\nWhile I have dwelt on Ramon y Cajal's theory, because for years it has\r\nbeen familiar, of course I must re-echo his own warning that it is,\r\nafter all, only a theory. It presupposes an active interposition of\r\nthe glia cells between the axon of one neuron and the dendrons of\r\nanother. This cannot be demonstrated. A third theory of mental\r\noperations, then, has been suggested, and the English school, so ably\r\nled by Sherrington (\"Integrative Action of the Nervous System,\"\r\nLondon, 1903) and McDougal (\"Synapse Theory of Fatigue,\" _Brain_,\r\n1910) has deservedly attracted wide attention. They contend that all\r\nthe phenomena can be more simply explained without postulating the\r\nmovement required for the Duval Theory or the glial activity of Ramon\r\ny Cajal's hypothesis. They consider that each nerve cell has, as it\r\nwere, a certain potential energy which it sends forth in nerve\r\nimpulses. These are transferred from neuron to neuron through the\r\nsynapse. If what we might call, to borrow a figure from electricity,\r\nthe voltage of the cell impulse be sufficient to overcome the\r\nresistance at the synapse, the impulse passes from neuron to neuron.\r\nIn fatigue the potential energy of the cell is gradually dissipated.\r\nThe impulses become feebler till they cease to pass. This occurs in\r\nthe state we usually experience as tiredness and in analogous states\r\nsuch as sleep, unconsciousness, narcosis and the like. Obviously this\r\n{124} theory can be elaborated and applied parallel with the neuroglia\r\ntheory except that here we are substituting synapse resistance for the\r\nhypothetical, undemonstrated action of the glial cells. But, as the\r\nlatter seems a simpler process upon which to explain the various\r\nphenomena, especially to those not familiar with very recent\r\ndevelopments in nervous histology and studies in nervous mechanism,\r\nand as it merely involves a question of the nature of the resistance\r\nand not of its site, I have used it for explanatory purposes without\r\nadvocating either theory in the present state of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBRAIN CELLS AND MENTAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the theories of neuronic action we have discussed do not\r\nrepresent absolute knowledge, they are at least suggestive and helpful\r\nin psychotherapy. Whenever there are disturbances of mental\r\noperations, patients are likely to become very solicitous, lest these\r\nrepresent organic and incurable changes. The application of Ramon y\r\nCajal's neuroglia theory serves to bring out the fact that most of\r\nthem can be very well explained as merely functional, due to passing\r\ndisturbances of activity, and not necessarily to tissue changes. When\r\npatients become possessed of the fear that certain nervous symptoms\r\nportend definite injuries to the nervous system, this unfavorable\r\nsuggestion keeps them from using, to its proper and full extent for\r\nrepair and convalescence, the nervous energy which they possess. This\r\ndisturbing influence can be counteracted by a straightforward\r\nexposition of Ramon y Cajal's or the newer English theory of brain\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nPatients become very much disturbed if they observe a failure of\r\ncertain faculties in themselves, and are prone to think that such a\r\nfailure means serious exhaustion or enduring change. The power of\r\nattention is one of the faculties often disturbed in neurotic cases\r\nand causes patients needless solicitude. Disturbances of memory are\r\nthe next most alarming elements in these cases. There are then many\r\nforms of mental distraction, absorption and preoccupation that\r\nsometimes frighten neurotic individuals who have become solicitous\r\nabout themselves. Though only passing incidents, due to overattention\r\nto themselves and their ills, real or fancied, and the consequent lack\r\nof concentration of mind on a particular subject, the patients fear\r\nserious deterioration of their mental condition, or at least of mental\r\ncontrol. The neuroglia theory of mental action throws a light on all\r\nthese phases of mentality that serves to lessen the solicitude of\r\npatients and enable them to understand that, in spite of their fears,\r\nthere is nothing but functional disturbance. The condition can be\r\nreadily explained and it admits of complete restoration to health.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTION\r\n\r\nEven more important, perhaps, than any other of the functions\r\nattributed to the neuroglia cells, is the role they may play in\r\nenabling the individual to concentrate attention on a particular\r\nsubject, or at least to use a particular {125} portion of his brain,\r\nby bringing about a more active circulation in that portion than in\r\nany other, Ramon y Cajal attributes this power to the perivascular\r\nneuroglia cells. Every capillary in the brain has thousands of these\r\nlittle pseudopod prolongations. When the cells in a particular region\r\ncontract, the blood vessels of the part are pulled wide open and a\r\nlarger supply of blood flows more freely, stimulating the nerve cells\r\nby which it passes and supplying them with nutrition for the\r\nexpenditure of energy that they may have to make. This is the physical\r\nprocess that underlies attention. When too much, that is, too\r\nlong-continued attention is paid to any subject, without diversion of\r\nmind, the capillaries may easily acquire the habit of being open, and\r\ncells the custom of contraction, so that relaxation does not readily\r\ntake place. Something of this kind is the most important element in\r\nthe etiology of many functional nervous disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--AN ARTERY FROM THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.--One\r\n  can see numerous fine fibers passing over to the brain substance\r\n  (Obersteiner).]\r\n\r\n\r\nEase and Pleasure in Mental Operations.--On the other hand this same\r\nset of ideas explains many things otherwise difficult of\r\nunderstanding. For instance, we all know that habit enables us to\r\napply ourselves to a particular subject with ever growing ease. What\r\nwas extremely difficult for us at the beginning, may after a time\r\nbecome comparatively easy, and later even positively pleasant. Study,\r\nthat is application of mind, is, at the beginning, for most people,\r\nnot agreeable. If persisted in, it almost inevitably becomes a\r\npleasure. Hard exercise of any kind is, at the beginning, sure to\r\nrequire great energy of purpose, and requires some subsidiary motive\r\nof approbation or reward to make us persist in it. But what was a\r\ndistinct labor at the beginning becomes pleasant after a while. This\r\nmay be applied to the neuroglia cells apparently as well as to the\r\nmuscle fibers. On this theory, the reason for the gradual acquirement\r\nof an intense pleasure in the intellectual life becomes easy to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\nDangers of Over-attention.--The danger of concentration of mind on\r\none's self, quite as much as on any other subject, becomes clearer\r\nwhen this theory is accepted as explaining the physical basis of the\r\nmental operations involved in attention. If people allow thoughts of\r\nthemselves and of their physical processes constantly to occupy their\r\nminds, gradually that portion of the brain ruling over these becomes\r\nover-fatigued and fails to respond to the calls for relaxation.\r\nInsomnia may develop readily as a consequence of continued solicitude\r\nand prove to be, as the worst forms of insomnia so often are, quite\r\nunamenable to direct drug treatment, because, even during the enforced\r\nsleep that comes from drugs, dreams with regard to self and the\r\nsupposed ills may still occupy the overworked portion of the brain.\r\nNervous people are, most occupied with those parts of the brain which\r\nhave something to do with the omission and transmission of trophic\r\ninfluence to particular parts of the body. As a consequence of the\r\npersistent hyperemia, too many trophic impulses are sent down. These\r\ncause an exaggeration of physiological function, in the stomach, the\r\nheart, or some other important organ. Hence these organs may become\r\noversensitive.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, this theory of attention, of the great Spanish\r\n{126} investigator, deserves to be well known by those who hope to\r\ntreat neurotic affections, especially functional diseases of the\r\nbrain, and therefore I prefer once more to give it in his own words.\r\n[Footnote 16]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: _International Clinics_, Vol II, Series 11.]\r\n\r\n  Ramon y Cajal's Theory of Attention.--Under usual conditions, the\r\n  motor apparatus of the gray matter suffices for the explanation or\r\n  the varied course of association of ideas and of the reaction\r\n  produced by voluntary motion. But as soon as attention is\r\n  concentrated upon an idea, or a small number of associated ideas,\r\n  there enters into the problem, besides the active retraction of the\r\n  neuroglia of the corresponding part of the brain, a new factor--the\r\n  active congestion of the capillaries of the over-excited region. As\r\n  a consequence of this, the energy of emotion reaches a maximum. The\r\n  heat and metabolism of the hyperemic parts is increased, which, of\r\n  course, makes these parts capable of more work.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--NEUROGLIA CELLS OF THE SUPERFICIAL LAYERS\r\n  OF THE BRAIN FROM AN INFANT AGED TWO MONTHS (method of Golgi). A, B,\r\n  C, D, neuroglia cells of the plexiform layer; E, F, G, H, K, R,\r\n  neuroglia cells of the second and third layers; I, J, neuroglia\r\n  cells with vascular pedicles; V, blood-vessel. (Ramon j Cajal.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis congestion of various parts of the brain has been experimentally\r\nobserved {127} by a number of physiologists. It can be best explained\r\nby considering that the will has an influence upon the nerves which\r\nproduce a dilatation of the blood-vessels in different parts of the\r\ncerebral cortex. The process of attention, however, by which\r\nintellectual activity is concentrated upon a limited number of ideas,\r\nseems to be but very little under the control of the sympathetic nerve\r\nendings.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the capillaries of the brain are wanting in\r\nnerves and smooth muscle fibers. Hence they are not under the control\r\nof the sympathetic system. Only the relatively large arteries of the\r\npia mater, which possesses a tunica muscularis are under a certain\r\nlimited control of the sympathetic, which is able to produce in them\r\nan incomplete and not very well limited congestion. One of the\r\ndifficulties of the problem of the activity of the sympathetic is best\r\nrealized when we recall that vasomotor activity is usually\r\ninvoluntary. The process of attention, however, is entirely conscious\r\nand voluntary.\r\n\r\nIn the hypothesis that we have given, most of the difficulties\r\ndisappear. Under the influence of the will, the pseudopod branches of\r\nthe neuroglia cells, which end in the walls of the capillaries,\r\ncontract. As the result of this, the bloodvessels, all of which are\r\nsurrounded by lymph spaces, dilate, and this dilatation may proceed to\r\nsuch an extent that the vessels occupy the whole of the lymph spaces.\r\nThus we can easily understand how the very limited congestions which\r\nare necessary for the concentration of thought upon a single idea may\r\nbe brought about.\r\n\r\nThe perivascular lymph spaces which exist in the brain seem to be for\r\nthe purpose of making these limited hyperemias easier. At the same\r\ntime they serve a very useful purpose in preventing pressure or\r\nconcussion, such as might be caused upon the neighboring nerve cells\r\nby too great dilatation of the blood vessels of a part.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that we do not consider the hypothesis that we\r\nhave advanced to be absolutely without objection. On the contrary we\r\nbelieve that, owing to the difficulty of the problem and our, as yet,\r\nextremely slight knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nerve\r\nprotoplasm, any theory as to the special mechanism of psychic\r\nprocesses is sure to be faulty. Rational hypotheses, however, which\r\nare supported by well-known facts, are not only justified, but are\r\noften fruitful of suggestive ideas. A scientific hypothesis often\r\ngives a new direction, suggests an untried method of observation, or\r\nhints at new ways of experiment, and, though it may not lead directly\r\nto truth, always brings us closer to methods of investigation and of\r\ncriticism that are invaluable. Even though our further investigations\r\nshould not confirm our hypothesis, the result will not be less\r\npositive. Negative conclusions lessen the number of possible\r\nhypotheses and therefore diminish the possibility of error in future\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORY\r\n\r\nIt is evident that some of the physical mechanisms that are employed\r\nfor the lower grade mental processes at least can be explained on the\r\nneuroglia theory. Memory we share to a great extent with the animals,\r\nand for this the physical processes can be rather interestingly\r\nstudied. We have all had the experience of being unable to recall a\r\nword when we wanted it. Commonly the word is a proper name with which\r\nthere are not many direct connecting ideas, so that, somehow, we seem\r\nunable to trace the word to its depository in the brain. Occasionally\r\nwe are sure that we know the first letter of the word. Sometimes we\r\nare able to name this letter, and, if we do so, the rest of the word\r\nwill usually turn up a moment later. At times, however, the word fails\r\nto come and we grope for it. Then if we stop deliberately seeking it,\r\nthe word will often after a longer or shorter time, come up\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nThis experience is familiar to everyone. It is especially frequent\r\nwith public speakers. Certain words have a habit of slipping away just\r\nwhen we {128} want them. At times by beginning a sentence confidently,\r\neven though there is a feeling that there is a missing word ahead, the\r\nword will turn up in time. Often it will not, and then a weak\r\ncircumlocution must be indulged in. If it is a proper name, a\r\ndescription may have to be substituted, sometimes a confession may\r\nhave to be made that the name will not come and the audience, unless\r\nit is very young, will sympathize with the speaker.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the idea that the memory has a definite location in the\r\nbrain, the process is easily understood. Just how we cannot say, but\r\nsomehow brain cells serve as the media by which our memory processes\r\nrevert to knowledge that has been previously stored up. If now we\r\nassume that the repetition of things known is accomplished by bringing\r\nbrain cells into connection with one another, and with the organs of\r\nspeech, it is easy to understand that somehow the connection with a\r\nparticular cell or set of cells cannot be secured at a given moment.\r\nThis delay prevents us from being able to repeat things that we know,\r\nand know that we know, though we cannot somehow get at them. The will\r\nfails to reach the proper insulating plug of a neuroglia cell, which,\r\nif acted upon, would put a cell or group of cells in communication\r\nwith others. As a result the message from it cannot flow down. We feel\r\nthat we have it on the tip of our tongue, as we say, that a little\r\neffort may bring it to us and sometimes that effort succeeds. If there\r\nis any disturbance of consciousness by secondary motives, however, as\r\nby the excitement of public speaking or the flustering that comes to\r\nsome people when they try to introduce even old-time friends and\r\nforget their names, then we cannot control the brain processes and\r\nmemory fails. We do not for a moment think of attributing this failure\r\nof memory to the faculty of memory itself. We have the feeling that\r\nthere is some mechanical obstacle. Ramon y Cajal's theory enables us\r\nto understand this obstacle better, perhaps, than any other.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of this lapse in memory helping us to a\r\nrevelation of something of the physical process which underlies the\r\nfaculty, is the fact that it implies a very intricate machine.\r\nRecalling has become such an obvious incident that we do not think of\r\nthe complexity of action involved. Many things are brought together,\r\nand relations of all kinds serve to recall various facts and names and\r\ndates. Some of these relations are most bizarre. Particular names\r\nrecall a definite series of facts. A color will bring up a scene or\r\nthe memory of an individual. An odor will recall scenes long since\r\napparently forgotten and will set trains of thought at work that are\r\nquite unexpected. Sometimes we wake in the morning with a name or a\r\nfact on our lips that we have been looking for for several days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION\r\n\r\nSome people actually learn to depend on unconscious cerebration. A\r\nman, for instance, who has to make an address on a particular subject\r\nor to write an article, will record that fact on a tablet and after\r\ngathering a few basic thoughts in connection with the subject\r\nproposed, will put it aside for the time being. He is confident that\r\nvarious illustrations and thoughts in connection with the subject will\r\noccur to him at intervals during the next few days, and that he will\r\nthus without direct labor accumulate an amount of {129} material for\r\nuse. In the early morning hours he may find that thoughts on it come\r\nto him unbidden. Sometimes he will find these thoughts precious germs,\r\nthat will develop during the course of the following days, and will be\r\nof great help to him. If he is worried and preoccupied with other\r\nthings very much, this may not happen, but under ordinary\r\ncircumstances he can continue routine occupations which demand\r\npractically all of his time, yet continue to develop the subject\r\nselected for his paper or address. The more he has occupied his mind\r\nwith the subject at the beginning, the more will this unconscious\r\ncerebration continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACTION OF MIND\r\n\r\nFeatures of the mechanism of mental operations are brought out in\r\ncertain phenomena of abstraction of mind, which show how the attention\r\ncan be so short-circuited that sensations from the periphery utterly\r\nfail to penetrate to the consciousness. Most men have had the\r\nexperience of taking out their watches, looking at them, and then\r\nputting them back. Presently somebody asks what time it is. Unable to\r\nrecollect what it was that they saw, they have to look again. There is\r\nno doubt that they meant to observe the time.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true for practically all the senses. A pickpocket\r\ntakes advantage of our being occupied with many other feelings in the\r\nmidst of the jostling in a crowd on a car, or before a show window, or\r\nhe has a confederate add to the sensations already streaming up to us,\r\ncalling attention particularly to the other side of the body, and then\r\ninserts his hand into our pocket and extracts what he finds. Sometimes\r\nwe have a faint memory of something having happened to that pocket,\r\nbut our attention was occupied elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn hearing we have the same experience. When thoroughly occupied with\r\na book, a person may talk to us or ask us a question and we have no\r\nidea of what was said, sometimes utterly failing to hear the voice;\r\nsometimes we hear the sound of the voice, but do not comprehend the\r\nmeaning of the words.\r\n\r\nWhen we are unprepared for a question we nearly always have to have it\r\nrepeated to us. Sitting in a railroad train, if the person behind us,\r\nwhom we did not expect to talk to us, asks a question, it is very\r\nprobable that on the first asking we shall not notice it at all,\r\nconsidering that it is addressed to someone else. On its repetition,\r\nit may appeal to us as addressed to ourselves, but even then we\r\nreadily lose its significance because our attention has not been\r\ncalled to the wording of it soon enough to enable us to comprehend it\r\nthoroughly. These experiences, so familiar that we have probably all\r\nhad them at some time or other, indicate how universal is the power of\r\nthe mind to concentrate itself upon itself to the extent of neglecting\r\nsensations from the outer world, even though they may pass the\r\nperiphery of the organism and manifestly affect the first neuron of\r\nthe chain that leads up to our brain and consequently to\r\nconsciousness. They do not reach the center with sufficient intensity\r\nto be understood, and a conscious act of attention must be made before\r\nwe comprehend their meaning.\r\n\r\n{130}\r\n\r\n\r\nPREOCCUPATION OF MIND\r\n\r\nThis is true, not only for ordinary sensations, but even for such as\r\nwould ordinarily be presumed to be so insistent in their call that\r\nthey could not be neglected. The concentration of mind necessary for\r\nthis is not common to all mankind; it is possessed only by a few\r\nindividuals whose intellect represents the larger portion of their\r\npersonality. Certain of the great investigating scientific geniuses\r\nhave had the faculty of so concentrating their attention upon the\r\nquestions with which their intellects were engaged, that even the call\r\nof appetite did not make itself felt. Newton was one of these. Over\r\nand over again, he was known to neglect to take his meals, even though\r\nthey were brought to him, and, occasionally, he would entirely forget\r\nwhether he had taken a meal or not. But Newton is not an extreme\r\nexception. Most of the great mathematicians have had experiences of\r\nthis kind and, indeed, mathematics seems to be that special branch of\r\nintellectual work which most readily brings about a preoccupation of\r\nmind sufficient to completely shut out the outer world for the time\r\nbeing. Archimedes, the great ancient mathematician, lost his life\r\nbecause of preoccupation with mathematical problems that kept him from\r\ntelling the Roman soldiers, who had strict orders to spare him, who he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nComplete absorption of mind to the exclusion of all external\r\nsensations is not, however, confined to the mathematicians. Mommsen,\r\nthe historian, was famous for his fits of mental abstraction. Once he\r\npatted a school-boy on the head and asked whose boy he was, to be told\r\nrather startlingly, \"Yours.\" Lombroso, the criminal psychologist, was\r\nsubject to abstraction in almost as great a degree. Men have become so\r\npreoccupied in study as not to appreciate the significance of\r\nwarnings, indicating that a serious accident was about to happen, such\r\nas a fire or the fall of some object that they should have avoided, or\r\nsome other danger to themselves. The tendency to such abstraction is\r\nresponsible for many accidents on busy city streets. When so\r\npreoccupied, painters walk off scaffolds, and such preoccupation of\r\nmind is extremely dangerous, not only for the man himself, but for\r\nthose who are working with him.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that a slight headache frequently disappears in\r\npleasant company. There is sometimes the suspicion, though it is quite\r\nunjustified, that because a person has a headache which can be cured\r\nby engaging in a favorite occupation, the headache is more imaginary\r\nthan real. The common experience with toothache shows the falsity of\r\nthis opinion. There is no imagination in regard to toothache, yet it,\r\ntoo, except in very severe cases, will be so modified as to be quite\r\nnegligible if the victim has some mental occupation that is very\r\nabsorbing. Pains of other kinds that are just as real, may be modified\r\nin the same way. I have known a boy to suffer enough from the presence\r\nof an unsuspected kidney stone to give up play and come into the\r\nhouse, yet he could be made entirely to forget his discomfort by a\r\ngame of checkers. On account of the ease with which the pain was thus\r\ndispelled, the suspicion was harbored that his ache was more imaginary\r\nthan real. The ache continued and at the end of about a year there was\r\nan acute exacerbation which justified an operation, and the stone was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn all these instances there is evidently a question of the unmaking,\r\nor at {131} least imperfect making, of connections between the\r\nperipheral and central neurons, because of the existence of\r\nconnections between different portions of the brain itself which take\r\nup the attention. This attention to mental things may become\r\nexaggerated, and must be guarded against, but it represents a valuable\r\npsychotherapeutic remedy. Whenever the peripheral connections are\r\nunmade, external sensation is unfelt. Even though the peripheral\r\nneuron may be suffering to some extent, this is true. It is this law\r\nof attention that must be taken advantage of for psychotherapeutics.\r\nPeople who are liable to be too much concerned with their sensations,\r\nmust be taught to occupy themselves with interests that will absorb\r\nthe attention. Central neurons can, except under very serious\r\ncircumstances, be made to connect with one another so intimately as to\r\nbring about the neglect of many bothersome external sensations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--COMPLEXITY OF CELL OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS\r\n  SYSTEM. A Golgi cell after Andriezen. (Barker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the connections with the periphery are well\r\nmade, external sensations flow in on us to the exclusion of thought\r\nand then even simple sensations may be exaggerated so as to become\r\npainful. Anything that attracts our attention so much that we cannot\r\nthink quietly about it, is likely to be a disturbance rather than a\r\npleasure. Music is distinctly pleasant, yet very loud music becomes\r\npainful. The reason is that the peripheral neuron is so much disturbed\r\nthat these excessive vibrations are communicated to other neurons\r\nconnected with it and they are unable to occupy themselves with\r\nanything except this over-strenuous sensation. A very bright light has\r\nsomething of the same effect, and the same thing is true for all the\r\nother senses. A pleasant odor, if over strong, becomes disgusting. A\r\nvery sweet taste is cloying. This over excitation of neurons may come\r\nfrom without, or may come from within. If the central neuron is so\r\nmuch occupied with itself, and the sensation that is flowing into it,\r\nthat it is prevented from making such connections as would communicate\r\nand distribute the sensations properly, then the sensory phenomenon\r\nbecomes painful, though it may not be exaggerated in the peripheral\r\nneuron.\r\n\r\n\r\nVITAL ENERGY BEHIND BRAIN CELLS\r\n\r\nIn all of these phenomena there is something more than brain cells at\r\nwork. Brain cells are guided, co-ordinated, controlled, and even\r\noverseen, in their labors. The same conclusion becomes inevitable with\r\nregard to the action of the cells of the body generally. A generation\r\nor two ago it was the custom to attempt to explain all the processes\r\nin the body by chemical and physical principles. Respiration, for\r\ninstance, and absorption of gases into the blood in the lungs and the\r\nexpiration of gases that have been generated within the body during\r\nvital processes, were supposed to be entirely explicable on the\r\nprinciple of the diffusion of gases. The absorption of various\r\nsubstances into the body proper from the intestinal tract, and the\r\nexcretion {132} of various substances from within the body into the\r\nexcretory organs, as well as the process of secretion, were supposed\r\nto be nothing more than varying phenomena of osmosis and exosmosis.\r\nThere has since been a general recognition of the fact that these\r\nprinciples do not explain many of the incidents within the body in its\r\nrelations to its surroundings, and that vital processes are something\r\nmuch more than merely manifestations of physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are not mere laboratories in which refinements\r\nof the laws of the diffusion of gases may be studied, for under\r\nvarying pressures from without that would vitiate the ordinary\r\nlaws of diffusion, inspiration and expiration continues. Fishes\r\nlive at depths where the pressure is so great that expiration\r\nwould seem to be impossible, yet they succeed in eliminating\r\nharmful gaseous material. Prof. Haldane of Cambridge has\r\ncalled attention to many of these processes. Animal stomachs\r\nare not test-tubes. Animal excretion, and above all, secretion,\r\nis carried on sometimes in accordance with but, almost more\r\noften, in defiance of chemical and physical principles. The\r\nindividual, even in the lower animals, counts for much more\r\nthan the chemical constituents of the tissues and the physical\r\nprinciples involved.\r\n\r\nBesides, all the parts of the organism are co-ordinated, and\r\nthere are wonderful checks and counterchecks which show that\r\nanimals are much more than colonies of cells fortuitously\r\ngrowing together and habituated to such common life by many\r\ngenerations of heredity and environment and training. In a\r\nword, the old vitalistic principle has become popular once\r\nmore and even great physiologists have insisted that there is a\r\nprinciple of life which guides and controls and co-ordinates the\r\ndifferent portions of the body. Especially does this seem to be\r\ntrue of the brain. We have here an intensely complex machine,\r\ncomposed literally of billions of parts which work together, and\r\nin doing so accomplish wonderful results. Of the existence of\r\nthis machine, much more of the great intricacy of its parts\r\nand mechanism, we are quite unconscious. We learn to use it\r\nin very early years with an assurance and a perfection that is\r\namazing, considering how complex it is. The less we think\r\nabout it and its workings, the better does it work and the less\r\ndisturbance of function is there in its accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21.--SECTION THROUGH THE CORTEX OF THE\r\n  GYRUS OCCIPITALIS SUPERIOR. (Hammarberg. Barker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a vitalistic principle were needed to enable us to understand the\r\nworkings of the ordinary body cells, how much more is it required for\r\nthe workings of brain cells. There is something behind that guides and\r\nrules the brain, and through which it accomplishes its work. It is\r\nthis that brings about an unconscious cerebration accomplishing\r\nintellectual results for us even when the brain machine itself is at\r\nrest as when asleep, or fails, for some reason, to be in readiness to\r\ntake up the work that we demand of it. It is this vital principle that\r\ncoordinates the movements of brain cells which represent {133} the\r\nphysical processes underlying memory and the nervous elements of the\r\nsensitive and motor phenomena of the organism. Reflection on the\r\nphysical mechanism underlying mental operations of various kinds,\r\ndemands the vitalistic explanation much more than the physiological\r\nphenomena which have converted physiologists to the old way of\r\nthinking in our time. Our individuality is probably largely due to the\r\nphysical basis of our mentality, but there is something more than that\r\nrequired for any theory of mental operations that would satisfy all\r\nthe questions that come to us. There is, then, actual proof of the\r\nexistence of a force that is part of us, that constitutes a bit of the\r\nessence of our personalities, yet is capable of accomplishing results\r\nthat we cannot understand, and of managing a machine that transcends\r\nany physical powers that we can think of.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22--MOTOR CELL OF VENTRAL HORN OF SPINAL CORD\r\n  FROM THE HUMAN FETUS, THIRTY CENTIMETERS LONG (method of Golgi;\r\n  after von Lenhossek. Barker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vital force behind the nervous system contains stores of energy\r\nthat can be called on for therapeutic purposes. It is the directing,\r\nco-ordinating and energizing force which controls the central nervous\r\nsystem, and enables it to accomplish its purposes. It is the\r\ndisappearance of this force at death which leaves the body without\r\nvital activity, though no physical difference between the dead and the\r\nliving body can be demonstrated. Changes in the body _follow_ death;\r\nthey are not simultaneous. This vital force supplies the energy that\r\nwe call the will, and underlies the process called \"living on the\r\nwill\" which so often serves to maintain existence when there is every\r\nreason to think that a fatal termination is due. The amount of energy\r\nthus available is limited, {134} but is much more powerful than has\r\nbeen thought. It is of the greatest possible service in preserving\r\nhealth and eliminating disease. Its existence, demonstrated by the\r\ncomplex nervous system which we employ with such confidence, though we\r\nknow nothing of it, furnishes the best possible basis for confident\r\nattempts at rousing the patient to use the vital energy he possesses\r\nfor the strengthening of weakness, the correction of deficiency and\r\nthe control of evil tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION\r\n\r\nMany of the exhausting neurotic and psycho-neurotic affections so\r\ncommon in recent years are largely due to the failure of patients to\r\nsecure such mental relaxation as will permit complete repair of\r\nnervous waste. We are proud of being a generation of specialists. Some\r\nmen never get completely away from the set of thoughts with which they\r\nare occupied in their particular specialty. Waking or sleeping these\r\nthoughts are with them. It is almost impossible, then, for cells of\r\nthe central nervous system to secure such rest as they need. Cells\r\nmust be put at absolute rest so that nutritional processes may go on\r\nentirely undisturbed, and every portion of the cell be renewed in\r\nvigor. Re-creation, in its original meaning, is exactly what must be\r\nprovided for nerve cells.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is not alone that men occupy a very narrow set of brain\r\ncells with their special interest, and make all their energy pass\r\nthrough that set, but among men who are lacking in a certain\r\ninsulation in the nervous system, this particular set of cells\r\ncontinues to be active, even at times when they think they are resting\r\nor diverting themselves. Unconscious cerebration (the occupation of\r\nthe mind with subjects when we are not deliberately giving our\r\nattention to them) is a common phenomenon in human psychology. With\r\nthe rise of extreme specialization, it has become even more dangerous\r\nthan before. In the past unconscious cerebration might mean any\r\noccupation, with any one of a number of interests. At the present it\r\nis likely to mean concentration of thought on a particular subject\r\nwith which the brain is prone to be occupied more than is good for it,\r\neven during the hours of ordinary labor. It seems worth while to\r\ndiscuss at some length, then, the subject of unconscious cerebration,\r\nbecause it constitutes the pathological physiology of many nervous\r\nstates that we see in modern life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequency of Unconscious Cerebration.--The mind, having been set to\r\nwork over a given thought, continues at it sub-consciously, even while\r\napparently completely occupied with something else. Most people who\r\ndevote themselves to the intellectual life have experienced phenomena\r\nmore striking and going much farther in unconscious cerebration than\r\nthis. Most writers have a common experience: if they arrange their\r\nthoughts on a given subject and then turn aside to something else,\r\nthey find, when they go over the same subject next day, much more\r\nmaterial than came the day before. The thoughts for an article will\r\noften gradually accumulate by unconscious cerebration after the\r\nprocess has been consciously started.\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\nAt intervals during the next few days succeeding the determination to\r\nwrite a certain article (at moments when no conscious thought is being\r\ngiven to it), ideas crop up that help to fill out the original scheme\r\nof thought, and if these are jotted down, a good deal of intellectual\r\nwork is accomplished without the necessity for that labor over a desk\r\nthat most of us scheme to avoid. The more familiar literary work\r\nbecomes, the more frequent are these experiences, and one occasionally\r\nwakes up with a thought that opens up a new vista and adds valuable\r\nmaterial to what has already been accumulated. If the subject is a\r\nlarge one, as for a book, then most writers will probably confess that\r\nsome of their best thoughts have come in this \"hit and miss\" fashion\r\nrather than at the times when they were seriously applying themselves\r\nto elaborating their theme.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspiration.--Some of the great literary writers have felt that their\r\nbrain work was so independent of themselves that the word inspiration\r\nproperly suited what they were accomplishing. Thackeray destroyed\r\nsheet after sheet of manuscript, utterly dissatisfied with it until,\r\nas the result of keeping at it, inspiration would come. Then he would\r\nbe able to fill up rapidly many pages with work so finished that it\r\nneeded little correction or polish. George Eliot, at times, became so\r\nabsorbed in her writing that it almost appeared to her that some other\r\npersonality than her own was wielding the pen. Her imaginary\r\ncharacters became real to her, and it was while under the stimulus of\r\nthis impression of living in an imaginative world with them that she\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing her best work. Many other authors were, of\r\ncourse, very different. Some of them ridiculed the idea of waiting for\r\ninspiration. Most of them, however, found it difficult to begin their\r\ntask at certain times, yet if they forced themselves to it, and once\r\ngot their minds going, the line of thought ran on easily and, at the\r\nclose of the task, they looked back with pleasure and wonder that they\r\nwere able to accomplish so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illustrations_.--This is true not only of literary work, whose main\r\npurpose is the arrangement of details of information of various kinds\r\nwith personal opinions concerning it, but also of original thought of\r\nany kind. Many stories of poets are told illustrating this. They\r\nwander round with pencils and jot down thoughts that come here and\r\nthere at what are called moments of inspiration. The poets dream over\r\ntheir subjects, catch fleeting thoughts that, vague at first, sing\r\nthemselves into musical expression. Music seems to be on the same\r\nplane with poetry, for there is the well-known story of the\r\ndistinguished German musician who, walking with his wife in the park,\r\nfound himself without paper at the moment when he had an inspiration.\r\nHe used his own cuffs to write upon, and then finally impressed those\r\nof his wife into the service of carrying home the precious musical\r\nmotifs that he was afraid might not come again if he allowed the\r\nfavorable moment to pass without recording them.\r\n\r\nThere are stories of Tennyson finding some of his most perfect lines\r\nin the fields, after hours of seclusion and effort in his study had\r\nfailed to round them out to his satisfaction, or dreaming them into\r\nshape, or waking to find one ready made to be written down. The\r\nletters of Wordsworth tell how often such incidents happened in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nAny one who has been thinking much for several days about a problem is\r\nlikely to wake up with the thought that he has dreamed a solution of\r\nit, though unfortunately the solution has not remained in his memory.\r\nIt seems as if a communication has been made to him during sleep. I\r\nhave discussed dream life with many men engaged in serious work, and\r\npractically all of them confess to such experiences. Preoccupation of\r\nmind with a subject during the waking hours leads to at least some\r\noccupation of mind with the same subject during sleep. This\r\nunconscious occupation must often require rather strenuous attention,\r\nexhausting nutrition, using up nerve force and hampering the rest that\r\nis so important for tired human nature. [Footnote 17]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 17: A number of poetic products of dreams are in our\r\n  literature, some of them interesting for more than their curious\r\n  origin. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, in his latest volume of poems, \"The\r\n  Comfort of the Hills,\" made an interesting contribution to the\r\n  psychology of dreams by publishing two poems which were composed by\r\n  him while asleep. The little poem, \"Which?\" has all the curious\r\n  alliterativeness and frequent rhyme that is so likely to be noted in\r\n  expressions that come during sleep, or just as we awake. The other\r\n  is more like a somnambulistic effort. What we might suggest here is\r\n  that the habit of poetizing during sleep would surely be dangerous\r\n  to any one less eminently sane than their author. We give them as\r\n  curious examples that will interest patients who complain that their\r\n  dreams are too vivid.\r\n\r\n      APRIL FIRST\r\n\r\n    Come, let us be the willing fools\r\n      Of April's earliest day.\r\n    And dream we own all pleasant things\r\n      The years have reft away.\r\n\r\n    'Tis but to take the poet's wand,\r\n      A touch or here or there,\r\n    And I have lost that ancient stoop,\r\n      And you are young and fair.\r\n\r\n    Ah, no! The years that gave and took\r\n      Have left with you and me\r\n    The wisdom of the widening stream;\r\n      Trust we the larger sea.\r\n\r\n    WHICH?\r\n\r\n    Birth-day or Earth-day,\r\n    Which the true mirth-day?\r\n    Earth-day or birth-day,\r\n    Which the well-worth day?\r\n\r\n  For further details on this subject, see the chapter on Dreams.]\r\n\r\n\r\nArt in Dreams.--Many a painter testifies that as he slept interesting\r\ndetails have been added to his scheme for a picture. Mr. Huntington,\r\nwho was for so long president of the National Academy, once told me\r\nthat some of the arrangements of his famous picture, \"Mercy's Dream\"\r\nin the Corcoran Art Gallery at Washington, had come to him during\r\nsleep. Giovanni Dupre, the French sculptor, confessed that the ideas\r\nfor his beautiful _pieta_ had practically all come to him in a dream.\r\nHe had been thinking for a long time how he should arrange it, without\r\nallowing any of the ideas of sculptors whose treatment of the subject\r\nwas well known to influence him too much, and had almost felt that it\r\nwould be impossible to make anything individual. While deeply occupied\r\nwith it one day he fell asleep, and when he awoke the whole scheme was\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical Dreams.--Such phenomena of unconscious cerebration are\r\nnot uncommon in the exact sciences. Some of the best examples of these\r\n{137} curious phenomena that we have are to be found in the history of\r\nthem. We all know the stories of mathematicians who, occupied deeply\r\nwith a problem which they have been unable to solve, have gone to bed\r\nstill thinking about it, have slept deeply and, as they thought,\r\ndreamlessly, and yet they have waked in the morning to find by the\r\nbedside the problem all worked out in their own penciling--all\r\naccomplished during a somnambulistic state. Missing factors have been\r\nfound in dreams; mistakes in the working out of problems have been\r\nclearly pointed out in dreams, so that, on awaking, the calculator\r\ncould at once correct his calculations, and even serious errors have\r\nbeen thus corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgassiz's Experience.--Some examples of these experiences in other\r\nsciences are striking. One that is likely to be impressive because it\r\noccurred in the experience of Professor Louis Agassiz, seems worth\r\nreporting.   [Footnote 18]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 18: \"Louis Agassiz, His Life and Correspondence,\"\r\n  edited by Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1885.]\r\n\r\n  It is interesting both as psychological fact and as showing how,\r\n  sleeping and waking, his work was ever present with him. He had been\r\n  for two weeks striving to decipher the somewhat obscure impression\r\n  of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was preserved. Weary\r\n  and perplexed he put his work aside at last, and tried to dismiss it\r\n  from his mind. Shortly after, he waked one night persuaded that\r\n  while asleep he had seen his fish with all the missing features\r\n  perfectly restored. But when he tried to hold and make fast the\r\n  image it escaped him. Nevertheless he went early to the Jardin des\r\n  Plantes, thinking that on looking anew at the impression he should\r\n  see something that would put him on the track of his vision. In\r\n  vain--the blurred record was as blank as ever. The next night he saw\r\n  the fish again, but with no more satisfactory result. When he woke\r\n  it disappeared from his memory as before. Hoping that the same\r\n  experience might be repeated, on the third night he placed a pencil\r\n  and paper beside his bed before going to sleep. Accordingly toward\r\n  morning the fish reappeared in his dream, confusedly at first, but\r\n  at last with such distinctness that he had no longer any doubt as to\r\n  its zoological characters. Still half dreaming, in perfect darkness,\r\n  he traced these characters on the sheet of paper at the bedside. In\r\n  the morning he was surprised to see in his nocturnal sketch features\r\n  which he thought it impossible the fossil itself should reveal. He\r\n  hastened to the Jardin des Plantes, and, with his drawing as a\r\n  guide, succeeded in chiseling away the surface of the stone under\r\n  which the portions of the fish proved to be hidden. When wholly\r\n  exposed, it corresponded with his drawing, and his dream, and he\r\n  succeeded in classifying it with ease. He often spoke of this as a\r\n  good illustration of the well-known fact that when the body is at\r\n  rest the tired brain will do the work it refused before.\r\n\r\n\r\nHilprecht's Sleep Vision.--Quite as surprising a dream was that of\r\nProf. Hilprecht, of the University of Pennsylvania. He had been trying\r\nfor some time to decipher certain characters on ancient cylinders from\r\nthe Orient. In spite of much hard mental labor he had been utterly\r\nunable to reach definite conclusions. In the midst of work on the\r\nsubject he dreamt one night that a priest of the olden time appeared\r\nto him and read off the inscription that he had in vain been trying to\r\ndecipher. Immediately after waking he told his wife of his dream and\r\nwrote down the interpretation that had thus been given. It was quite\r\ndifferent from anything that he himself had obtained any hint of in\r\nhis previous studies. When he got back to the inscription he found\r\nthat this interpretation would satisfy the conditions better than any\r\nother, and there seemed no doubt that it represented the missing\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n{138}\r\n\r\nSomnambulism.--These curiously vivid dreams are occasionally\r\nassociated with somnambulistic phenomena. Sometimes very definite\r\npurposes, requiring careful adaptation of means to ends, are\r\naccomplished in the somnambulistic state, and yet the actions are\r\ncompletely forgotten. I have recently been consulted about a case in\r\nwhich a young woman, on a visit to a family, had been shown some\r\npretty though not expensive jewels. Evidently the guest envied their\r\npossession, for she got up during sleep and took the jewels and hid\r\nthem. There seems no reason to doubt her statement that she remembered\r\nnothing at all about the incident. The taking was not attributed to\r\nher. There had been previous experiences of the same kind with things\r\nbelonging to this young woman's sister. Somnambulism represents a\r\ndegree of unconscious cerebration that may have serious results.\r\nCombinations of intellectual work with somnambulism are not\r\ninfrequent, though many of the stories that are told are exaggerated.\r\nSome of them are authenticated. Ribot has a typical example of\r\nintellectual accomplishment, in a somnambulistic condition, that shows\r\nhow far this may go:\r\n\r\n  A clear case of somnambulism was that of a clergyman, whom his wife\r\n  saw rise from bed in his sleep, go to a writing table, and write\r\n  rapidly for some minutes. This done he returned to bed, and slept on\r\n  until morning. On awaking, he told her that in a dream he had worked\r\n  out an argument for a sermon, of which he now retained no\r\n  recollection whatever. She led him to the writing table, and showed\r\n  him the written sheet upon which he found his argument worked out in\r\n  the most satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\nUnconscious cerebration is not, then, a trivial matter, and not an\r\nunusual experience. It probably occurs in every individual to a much\r\ngreater extent than he thinks, unless he is engaged in analyzing his\r\nmental processes and their ways rather carefully. This constitutes one\r\nof the dangers of the intellectual life, which must also be guarded\r\nagainst in business life or in any absorbing occupation. When the mind\r\nhas become intensely occupied with a subject, it is not easy to\r\nrelinquish it. Even when we turn to something else, mental activity in\r\nthe old groove continues to some extent, and so will prevent the rest\r\nthat is necessary for the repair of tissue. Under these conditions the\r\n_re-creation_ that is so important does not take place quite as well\r\nas it should, and even sleep does not relieve us from the burden of\r\nmental work. Mental exhaustion will result as a consequence of\r\nconstant occupation, and so mental relaxation must be secured.\r\nDeliberate means and methods must be employed in order that we may not\r\ndeceive ourselves into thinking we are securing mental recreation,\r\nthough all the time certain exhausting mental processes continue to be\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n\r\nDual Mental Occupation.--Many are inclined to think that reading,\r\nespecially the reading of newspapers and magazines, which has become\r\nso popular in our time, furnishes an occupation of mind that enables\r\none, for a time at least, to get away from cares and worries. This is\r\nprobably true when the news is of special interest, or there is some\r\nform of excitement, or at the beginning of such reading before one\r\ngrows accustomed to the usual {139} formula of the magazine stories;\r\nbut as years go on and cares increase, such reading does not afford an\r\noccupation of mind that enables one to throw them off. It helps to\r\npass the time, but the cares and worries keep insistently presenting\r\nthemselves, and the effort to inhibit them, and at the same time pay\r\nsome attention to what we are reading, makes a double task. Such\r\nreading, then, far from being restful, rather adds to the burden of\r\ncare and to the labor of the mind, for besides the conscious\r\ncerebration, there is the undercurrent of subconscious cerebration\r\ndisturbing the rest of cells that should be free from labor. The\r\nconstant renewal of effort to keep one train of thought from\r\ninterfering with another is itself a waste of nervous energy. This\r\nwhole matter of reading is coming to occupy a new place in the minds\r\nof educators, especially of those who are trying to realize the\r\nscientific significance of various phases of education. In his address\r\nas the President of the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, at the Winnipeg meeting in 1909, Prof. J. J. Thompson, the\r\nBritish physicist, sums up the value of reading as an intellectual\r\nexercise in a way that would not be gratifying to those who, in recent\r\nyears, have apparently accepted the doctrine that in much reading\r\nthere is much information and, therefore, much education. He says:\r\n\r\n  It is possible to read books to pass examinations without the higher\r\n  qualities of the mind being called into play. Indeed, I doubt if\r\n  there is any process in which the mind is more quiescent than in\r\n  reading without interest. I might appeal to the widespread habit of\r\n  reading in bed as a prevention of insomnia as a proof of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Duties.--So-called social duties are, in this respect, very\r\nlike reading. When we meet new people who are interesting, we get\r\ndiversion of mind in their company. When the people with whom we are,\r\nhowever, already familiar, and perhaps most of them a little tiresome,\r\nthen what is presumed to be a social diversion becomes merely a bore,\r\nall the problems of the day obtrude themselves, of real rest there is\r\nnone, and re-creation can scarcely be possible. Nearly the same thing\r\nis true of the present-day theater, after we have become used to its\r\nofferings. A serious play, well constructed and with life's problems\r\ntouched deeply, may grip us and take us out of ourselves, constituting\r\na complete and magnificent diversion. For a limited number of people\r\nmusic accomplishes this purpose. Unfortunately, the number is very\r\nlimited, and for those for whom music is the greatest diversion, it\r\nsometimes constitutes in itself a poignant source of mental\r\nexhaustion. Music may be a very trying thing, especially for women,\r\nand for those who have souls extremely sensitive to its manifold\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations, the importance of unconscious cerebration\r\nis brought home to the physician. It is impossible for a great many\r\npeople to keep their minds inactive, and this is particularly true of\r\ntwo classes of people: those who have superabundant mental energy and\r\nthose who lack self-control. To both of these classes of men and\r\nwomen, the physician must point out the dangers of unconscious\r\ncerebration--the occupation of mind with some subject, even at times\r\nwhile they imagine they are occupied with something else, or even\r\nduring sleep. Such continuous occupation with a single subject is\r\ndangerous. Physicians must emphasize that many supposed {140} mental\r\noccupations are really so superficial that they allow other more\r\nexhausting processes to continue below them in the sphere of\r\nconsciousness. As a consequence, the mind, instead of being relaxed,\r\nis really more tense than before, because occupied with two sets of\r\nthoughts. Very often it would be better for such people to continue\r\nwith the more serious problem until its solution came, or until they\r\nrealized that they must divert themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL RELAXATION\r\n\r\nWhat is important for mental relaxation, apparently, is not that a man\r\nshall try to set his mind at absolute rest, for that seems to be\r\nimpossible, if a man really has a mind; nor that he shall occupy it\r\nwith trivial things (because his interest will not be caught by them\r\nand will revert to the last serious thing that he was doing), but that\r\nhe shall have an outlet for mental activity in entirely another\r\ndirection from that to which he usually devotes himself. In other\r\nwords, it is important that a man shall have a hobby, and that he\r\nshall ride that hobby whenever his ordinary business, whatever that\r\nmay be, will permit him, and the more interesting the hobby, the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIAL MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe most important general remedy for over-prolonged mental occupation\r\nwith a single subject, is some outdoor sport or form of exercise that\r\nrequires all the attention. Horseback exercise is particularly\r\nvaluable; boating, especially where the man has charge of the boat\r\nhimself and where he has to have his wits about him, and the various\r\nsports. It is particularly important that men should not be alone\r\nduring the taking of their exercise and diversion of mind. Above all,\r\nhuman interests take a man outside of himself and keep him from\r\ndisturbing his mental equipoise by too much devotion to a single\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDISTANT MENTAL INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nThere is a very general impression that it is possible, at least under\r\ncertain circumstances, for one human mind to influence another at a\r\ndistance without any of the ordinary known means of communication.\r\nMany people have had the experience of thinking about a friend whom\r\nthey have not seen for a long while, and shortly after meeting him.\r\nSometimes it is found that the friend was making up his mind to bring\r\nabout the meeting just about the time that the thought of him came.\r\nMany have had the experience of writing a letter and having it cross\r\nin the mails with another from their correspondent, evidently written\r\nwithin a few hours, though there had perhaps been no communication for\r\nweeks or months before. There are people who insist that they can, by\r\nconcentrating the mind and fixing their eyes on the head of a {141}\r\nperson some distance in front of them in a theater, or a railway car,\r\ncause the person to turn around. There are others who say that by\r\nthinking strongly of some person in a distant part of a large room,\r\nthat person can be made to think of them. In general, there are many\r\npersons who are quite sure that there is evidence enough to indicate\r\nthe possibility of distant mental influence, or, as it has come to be\r\ncalled learnedly, telepathy.\r\n\r\nTelepathy, from the two Greek words, _tele_, at a distance, and\r\n_pathos_, feeling, has been much discussed in recent years. Many\r\npeople who use the word glibly are inclined to think they know much\r\nabout it. A long word, however, is not an explanation, and, just here,\r\nGeorge Eliot's expression \"we map out our ignorance in long Greek\r\nnames\" is worth recalling. There are a number of phenomena that seem\r\nto require some such theory as that of telepathy, but the phenomena\r\nare still under discussion and their significance is by no means\r\nclear. As we understand it, telepathy may mean either thought\r\ntransference or mind reading, that is, either the active process by\r\nwhich we communicate our thought to someone at a distance, or the\r\npassive process by which we receive communications from others. These\r\nthoughts include the idea of mental influence at a distance; that is,\r\nwe can by willing influence the wills, or at least the motives to\r\naction, of people at a distance and they may, in turn, influence ours.\r\nThe further thought has come, that since the mind largely influences\r\nthe body in matters of health, so mental influence from a distance by\r\naffecting mind, may either improve or injure health.\r\n\r\nSome sensitive people are disturbed by the thought that they may be\r\ninfluenced from a distance by others, or at least that suggestions\r\nthat come to them, may be due to telepathic influence. Investigation\r\nwould probably show that there are at least as many persons disturbed\r\nby real or supposed telepathic influences as there are of those who\r\nhave hallucinations. Sometimes it is said that such persons are not\r\nquite sane, but the more experience a physician has with them, the\r\nmore he dismisses the thought of insanity and proceeds to use contrary\r\nsuggestion and frank discussion, in order to counteract the mental\r\ninfluences. Insane persons think they are being influenced from a\r\ndistance just as they hear voices and see visions, but such\r\nhallucinations may occur to the sane, as apparent telepathic\r\nexperiences may also.\r\n\r\n\r\nWitchcraft.--It used to be a common belief that people could be\r\ninfluenced, even at a distance, by the mere evil wishes or intentions\r\nof others. After all, the old beliefs in witchcraft that were so\r\ncommon in Europe and in America until well into the eighteenth century\r\nrepresent the conviction of mankind that at least certain people\r\nmight, from a distance, seriously influence them for evil. Always the\r\nfear of malign influence was uppermost in people's minds and literally\r\nhundreds of thousands of witches were prosecuted, and many thousands\r\nof them put to death, because of this belief in the possibility of\r\ntheir working evil to others at a distance, merely by willing it.\r\nOccasionally some such material auxiliary to malign purpose as an\r\nimage in wax of the one to whom the evil was to be done was used. Into\r\nthis the ill wisher stuck pins according to the part that he or she\r\nwould want to be affected in the enemy, but as a rule the will, and\r\nnothing more, was used.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsent Treatment.--In our own time a system of healing, that has\r\nattracted many followers, has taken up the idea of beneficent mental\r\ninfluence at a distance. \"Absent treatment\" has now become a familiar\r\nexpression. {142} That those who believe in such favorable influence\r\nat a distance should also believe in unfavorable influence seems\r\ninevitable. As a matter of fact, we know that the founder of this\r\nspecial sect always insisted on the power for evil over herself and\r\nher followers of those who want to exert the injurious influence of\r\nanimal magnetism--malicious animal magnetism as it is called. A very\r\ndefinite attempt was made to bring a case of this kind before the\r\ncourts, the subject matter of which exactly resembled some of the old\r\nwitchcraft trials in New England! And in spite of the insistence and\r\nemphatic assertion that no such thing is intended, from the principles\r\nthat are accepted the necessary logical conclusion is a return to the\r\nbelief in witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalignant Magnetism.--As a number of persons are likely to fear such\r\nevil influence of others upon them, the question of the possibility of\r\nit must come up for discussion in order that its status may be clear\r\nin the physician's mind, for by just as much as he can make certain to\r\nthe patient that modern psychology refuses to accept distant\r\ninfluence, will he be able to reassure his patient. Of course, the\r\npatients who come with such complaints have usually some element of\r\nmental trouble. The alienist sees any number of people who are sure\r\nthat enemies at a distance are working spells upon them, some by\r\nelectrical, some by magnetic means, and some by telepathic absent\r\ntreatment, or absent ill-wishing. Such notions are the delusions of\r\nthe disequilibrated and these persons often cannot be reasoned with.\r\nYet very often a distinct delusion may be reasoned out of even a\r\nsubrational person, if it is taken seriously, and some striking\r\nexpression of its irrationality and of its total disagreement with\r\nscientific views can be shown to the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nAction Without a Medium.--The medieval scholastic philosophers quoted\r\nas an absolutely accepted principle the Latin axiom, _\"actio in\r\ndistans repugnat.\"_ Literally translated this means action at a\r\ndistance is repugnant to reason. Expressed less technically, the\r\nprinciple declares that any action of one body on another, where there\r\nis no medium connecting them, no link that in some way places them in\r\ncontact with one another, is absurd. The expression _in distans_ means\r\nthat the two bodies are separated from one another and stand in two\r\nplaces having no connection of any kind. This principle would\r\nordinarily seem to preclude the possibility of one person acting on\r\nanother, unless there is some mode of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrookes' Theory.--Sir William Crookes, at a meeting of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science about ten years ago, in\r\ndiscussing telepathy, directed attention to the fact that there exists\r\nby scientific hypothesis, generally accepted, a definite medium of\r\ncommunication by which minds at a distance might influence one\r\nanother. The medium is the ether which, according to physical\r\ntheories, besides carrying light, also carries heat and electrical\r\nwaves, and in recent years is recognized as transmitting the impulses\r\nof wireless telegraphy. It is possible that when the cells of certain\r\nhuman minds are stimulated to a particular phase of vibration, they\r\nmay, even at long distances, affect the cells of other individuals\r\nthat resemble them, or are attuned to them, that is, have the same\r\nmoment of vibration. This is the principle which underlies wireless\r\ntelegraphy. Whether the vibrations of living nerve cells can be made\r\nthus to radiate out over the ether and arouse in any way other cells,\r\nespecially to the extent of communicating ideas, is a matter still\r\nopen for investigation. The possibility of this occurring {143} cannot\r\nbe denied. We are, however, still in the presence of a condition and\r\nnot a theory. The question is whether minds are thus influenced at a\r\ndistance--whether we have data enough to establish the occurrence of\r\ntelepathy or mental communications of any kind at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Practical Thought Transfer.--At the beginning, it is of the\r\ngreatest importance to recall that, while many people think there must\r\nbe something in telepathy and presume that the investigations of\r\nrecent years have shown not only the possibility of the communication\r\nof ideas from mind to mind and of the mental influence of one person\r\nover another, even at long distances, but also its actual occurrence,\r\nyet all our ordinary life is founded on the absolute negation of any\r\nsuch phenomenon. For instance, our courts of law are conducted in\r\ndirect contradiction of the possibility of anything like telepathy.\r\nJuries are summoned of twelve good men and true who, as far as\r\npossible, know nothing about the prisoner and as little as may be\r\nabout the case. They are supposed to get all their information in the\r\ncourt room. We do not believe that any of them by any wonderful\r\nprocess might be able to know what was going on in the prisoner's mind\r\nin spite of his plea. Nor do we think for a moment that they can know\r\nwhat is going on, apart from what he communicates in evidence, in the\r\nmind of any witness. Neither is there the slightest presumption that\r\nthe judge or any of our lawyers can know anything about what is in the\r\nminds of any of the persons present, except as they reveal it by\r\noutward signs.\r\n\r\nA lawyer who could employ telepathy with success would be simply\r\ninvaluable. Before a month had passed, he would have all the business\r\nof the criminal courts in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Retention.--In answer to this it may be said that these\r\nrepresent conditions in which determined effort is made to keep all\r\npossible information that may be in the minds of all concerned from\r\npassing to others. Everyone concedes the power of such absolute self\r\nretention of our thoughts, when we deliberately wish to keep them from\r\nbeing known to others. When people wish to communicate their thoughts\r\nto others, then it may be different. In that case the sending and\r\nreceiving minds are both active and the conditions for interaction, if\r\nit were at all possible, would be favorable. Just this condition\r\nobtains in the court room every day. An innocent prisoner wants with\r\nall his heart and soul to communicate the idea of his innocence to the\r\njudge and jury. Of course, he does not succeed by telepathic means in\r\ntransferring to them any inkling of the truth. On the contrary, his\r\nvery nervousness and anxiety to set himself right before them will\r\nsometimes actually cause prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe rule that has thus been exemplified in our courts of law holds for\r\nall business transactions. The ordinary customs of business presume\r\nthat the buyer does not know what the seller paid for the particular\r\narticle that is being exchanged, and it is on the strength of this\r\nthat profit becomes possible. A few telepathic merchants or customers\r\nwould work serious havoc in business life.\r\n\r\nWhat thus holds for important affairs in life is just as strikingly\r\nexemplified in the trivial round of social existence and in our\r\nintercourse with friends. Suppose one woman knew what another woman\r\nthought of her!\r\n\r\nThat charming, old-fashioned institution \"courting\" would go entirely\r\nby {144} the board, if there were any such thing as real telepathy. In\r\ngeneral, social life in all its features would become very, very\r\ndifferent to what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Slight External Expression Conveys.--Mrs. Coventry Patmore,\r\nthe English poet's wife, once told a little story of some people who\r\nlived in a distant island where the inhabitants possessed tails. These\r\ntails were, as they are on the animals, organs of expression, but of\r\ninvoluntary and quite unconscious expression. It was utterly\r\nimpossible for the people there to say nice things to one another when\r\nthey had quite other things in mind, because if they did not like the\r\nperson their tails hung down behind; if they did like them they wagged\r\nrather vigorously, no matter what their owner might be saying. This\r\nsimple revelation of feelings, so much less than even the slightest\r\ndegree of telepathy would occasion, was quite enough to work a\r\nrevolution in the social affairs of this romantic island. It made the\r\npeople truthful and candid in their relations with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nNegation of Telepathy.--There is, perhaps, some evidence of the\r\noccurring of telepathy in special cases, but all of our present-day\r\nlife is organized on a firm basis of complete negation of the\r\nexistence or occurrence of telepathy to even the slightest degree.\r\nEvery-day experiences teach us that husbands and wives, even those who\r\nhave the greatest love and confidence toward each other, do not really\r\nknow their life partners, for it frequently happens that something\r\nturns up which reveals an unsuspected side of character even after\r\nmany years of intimate union.\r\n\r\nWe human beings are \"infinitely repellent particles,\" to use the\r\nphrase, of Matthew Arnold. We never get close enough to one another to\r\nhave a real glimpse into the depths of other minds. The information\r\nthat is supposed to pass by telepathy from one person to another is so\r\noften just the kind that we would most sedulously conceal. There is\r\nextreme unlikelihood then that any such passage of information takes\r\nplace. The cases cited, as proof of this transference of thought, are\r\nmuch more likely to be coincidences than any evidence of true\r\ntelepathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposed Examples of Telepathy.--In the first place, though there are\r\nopportunities for the exhibition of the phenomena of telepathy every\r\nday and every hour of existence, the cases in which it is supposed to\r\noccur are extremely rare and are distant from one another, both in\r\ntime and place. Even the people who claim to have had the phenomena of\r\ntelepathy happen to them once or twice, do not pretend that it is at\r\nall a common occurrence with them, and as for the supposed exhibitions\r\nof telepathy upon the stage, these have been exposed over and over\r\nagain as the simplest fakes.\r\n\r\nAs to the cases of telepathy that have been reported, with careful\r\ncollection of evidence, to the psychic research societies, and which\r\nare few in number, though some of them are very difficult to explain,\r\nthere is no reason why they should not be striking coincidences rather\r\nthan startling examples of telepathy. An example will illustrate what\r\nI mean:\r\n\r\nA few years ago what seemed to be a complete case of telepathy was\r\nreported in connection with a railroad accident. A Western man about\r\nto take an express train for the East was the object of a good deal of\r\nsolicitude. There had previously been a series of accidents to this\r\nvery fast train which he was to take. This fact had been discussed in\r\nthe family, and did not tend to allay the fears of those who remained\r\nat home. During the night the {145} train actually left the track, and\r\nthe car in which the subject of the story was asleep rolled down the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nAt the moment his train went down the bank the thought of his wife and\r\ndaughter came very vividly to his mind. For a moment the awful\r\nposition in which they would be placed if anything serious happened to\r\nhim occupied his mind to the exclusion of all other thoughts. As soon\r\nas he could, he telegraphed home that he was unhurt, with the\r\nunderstanding that the telegram should not be delivered before the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nDuring the night mother and daughter sleeping in adjoining rooms were\r\nwakened at the same moment, and very seriously disturbed, by\r\nsomething, they knew not quite what. They rose at once to go to each\r\nother and met at the door. They felt vaguely that father was in some\r\nway connected with their awakening and disturbance of mind. After they\r\nreceived his telegram they were sure that what disturbed them during\r\nthe night was the telepathic communication of father's danger. Each\r\nhad, however, deliberately kept from speaking of her impression. When\r\nthey found that he had passed through the danger unhurt, they were\r\nsure that it was a call from him that each had heard.\r\n\r\nThis bears most of the ear-marks of a genuine case of telepathy. Here\r\nare minds whose cells by custom and inheritance are finely attuned to\r\nthose of a distant mind that is suddenly very much disturbed. If the\r\nperturbations of that first mind were carried through the ether by a\r\nsort of wireless telegraphy, it would apparently not be very\r\nsurprising. So carried, they woke the receptive cells of similar minds\r\nat a long distance, and mother and daughter felt the thrill at the\r\nsame instant. Vague though it was, there was a telepathic message.\r\n\r\nBut there were other passengers in this train who had near and dear\r\nrelatives, yet none of them received communications. There have been\r\nliterally hundreds of thousands of other accidents in the past fifty\r\nyears of railroading in which passengers who have been put in very\r\nserious danger, have thought intensely of their loved ones, and yet,\r\nthere has been at most only a dozen or so examples of vague telepathy\r\nof this class. Similar cases to this are extremely rare, though\r\naccidents in America are very frequent. At most, then, we are in the\r\npresence of a very exceptional case. Such cases would mean nothing as\r\nevidence for a scientific law, since they occur so rarely as to aptly\r\nexemplify the old adage that the exception proves the rule. The rule\r\nevidently is that there is no communication at a distance, hence the\r\nsurprise when there seems to be some reason for thinking that a\r\ncommunication has actually taken place. Instead of proving that\r\ntelepathy occurs, such cases make it clear, to the limit of\r\ndemonstration, that telepathy does not occur unless some extremely\r\nspecial conditions intervene to make it possible.\r\n\r\nHow much more easy it is to explain such a case on the score of\r\ncoincidence! Of course, mother and daughter, with father absent, and\r\nabsent in the midst of what they thought was danger, would go to bed\r\nanxiously thinking of him. They would sleep lightly because of the\r\nworry. Any slight unusual noise would wake them, and at once the\r\nthought of father and his danger would occur to them. If the noise was\r\nsudden, and not repeated, and therefore inexplicable to one awakened\r\nout of sleep, they would probably be so disturbed that it is easy to\r\nunderstand that they would arise at once and seek each other's\r\ncompany. Their meeting, therefore, in the doorway between their rooms\r\nwould be readily explicable. Neither would say much {146} about the\r\nsubject uppermost in her thoughts in order to shield the other. The\r\ntelegram in the morning would throw a glow of retrospective light on\r\nthe events and seem to give an entirely new significance to their\r\nthoughts. The whole affair, though only a coincidence, would seem to\r\nbe a demonstration of telepathy.\r\n\r\nEven more marvelous instances of coincidence, in which there was no\r\nquestion of anything more than coincidence, have been related. The\r\nEnglish Psychical Research Society reported the case of a young man\r\nsent to find some trace of his brother who had disappeared\r\nmysteriously from a steamer sailing from Plymouth to Lisbon. On board\r\nthe steamer late at night he stood by the rail thinking of his lost\r\nbrother and wondering what could possibly have become of him. Suddenly\r\nas he looked down into the ocean a body came bobbing up out of the\r\nwaves almost directly under his gaze. He reported it to the officers\r\nof the vessel and it was grappled for and lifted aboard. It proved to\r\nbe the body of his brother. Is this an example of telepathy, that is,\r\nof the mental influence of the perturbed spirit of the live brother\r\nupon the dead brother's body floating below the surface? No one would\r\nstretch supposed telepathy to that extent. The steamer disturbed the\r\nbody which had been floating below the surface, as bodies do,\r\ngradually developing within themselves the gases of decomposition.\r\nAfter a time any slight disturbance, as, for instance, the booming of\r\na cannon or the passage of even a small boat, will bring a body up. It\r\nso happened that the brother was on the spot, and actually thinking of\r\nthe body, but that was the merest coincidence. There was no connection\r\nof cause and effect.\r\n\r\nMost of the cases of so-called telepathy can be explained in this way.\r\nAs we have said, no source of error is so copious as that of\r\nconcluding that because one thing happens after another therefore the\r\nsecond is caused by the first. People who are so inclined will still\r\ncontinue to accept such a notion of connection of cause and effect,\r\nhowever, and we shall have many cases of supposed telepathy exploited\r\nfor us on no better grounds than this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwins and Telepathy.--There is a definite popular impression that\r\ntwins are gifted with the power of telepathic communication much more\r\nthan others. Accepting Sir Wm. Crookes' theory, the possibility of\r\nmental reciprocal influence, even at a distance, is greater for them,\r\nsince their brain cells must be considered as having corresponding\r\nmoments of vibration. Twins of the same sex, especially those who\r\nresemble one another closely, are usually born from a single ovum. The\r\nintimate relations of two such beings to each other can be readily\r\nunderstood, so that we have many stories of mental communication at\r\nlong distances and curious warnings, forebodings and communications of\r\ndanger, and especially of sickness and death.\r\n\r\nEspecially does one find stories of wraith-like appearances of one to\r\nthe other of such persons at the moment of death. A series of these\r\nstories, apparently well authenticated, is published by the Psychic\r\nResearch Society. There are also a number of tales, seemingly well\r\nattested, of cloud-like shapes of other persons at the moment of\r\ndeath. As a consequence, there has been developed an idea that there\r\nis some evidence of the distinct possibility of such appearances when\r\nthe soul leaves the body. It, however, seems very doubtful whether\r\nthese are anything more than a very striking coincidence. Twins are\r\nlikely to be almost constantly in one another's minds, so there is\r\nabundant {147} room for coincidences. But any number of twins have\r\ndied at a distance from each other without there being any such\r\nwarning. Occasionally such startling appearances occur in connection\r\nwith people who are so slightly related, or whose existence bears such\r\nslight importance to each other, that it is hard to understand why the\r\nappearance may have come. Whether they are anything more than the\r\nfigment of an excited imagination remains to be seen, for, while we\r\nhave a little positive evidence, this only emphasizes the possibility\r\nof coincidental day-dreaming in nervous persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nNegative Tests.--We hear much of the possibility of reading minds at a\r\ndistance, or of getting definite information from sealed documents and\r\nthe like, but it must not be forgotten that whenever definite\r\nconditions have been set down, so that all the actions of the supposed\r\nclairvoyant could be controlled, then telepathy has always failed to\r\nbe manifested. Sir James Simpson, for instance, publicly offered to\r\ngive a five-hundred-pound note, which he had placed in a safe deposit\r\nvault, to anyone who could read its number which he had carefully\r\nimpressed on his own mind. Needless to say, no one got it. In the days\r\nwhen Bishop, the exhibiting mind reader, was creating such a furore in\r\nNew York and London by supposedly reading people's minds, Labouchere,\r\nthe editor of London _Truth_, offered a similar opportunity to Bishop,\r\nbut advantage of it was not taken. Bishop's power was entirely due to\r\nmuscle reading. People make involuntary movements of muscles that are\r\nvery slight, but sufficient for a trained observer to notice,\r\nespecially if his hand is on the individual experiencing the emotions,\r\nand the consequent muscle reflexes. [Footnote 19] About the middle of\r\nthe last century, the French Academy made a labored investigation of\r\ntelepathy and found that whatever there seemed to be in it, when\r\ncontrol was not properly kept, it at once was demonstrated to be\r\nimpossible when conditions were planned so as to prevent deception.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 19: The story of Hans, the calculating horse, shows that\r\n  even animals usually thought rather dull-witted may catch muscle\r\n  movements so slight as to be scarcely visible to any but one looking\r\n  particularly for them.]\r\n\r\nIf patients are worried over disturbing influences from others or the\r\nreading of their thoughts or telepathic suggestions, a calm review\r\nwith them of the practical side of this subject, as we have come to\r\nknow it in the modern time from actual investigation, will do more\r\nthan anything else to relieve their apprehensions. Most of these\r\npatients are unfortunately insane, but the reasoning will help even\r\nsome of these. There are some quite rational believers in such\r\nmanifestations who will be greatly benefitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSECONDARY PERSONALITY\r\n\r\nSo much attention has recently been directed to the subject of\r\nsecondary personality by the startling phenomena described in numerous\r\nbooks and articles on the subject, that a certain class of \"nervous\"\r\npatients have permitted themselves to be influenced by the\r\nauto-suggestion, flattering the vanity, that they, too, have a\r\nsecondary personality. They even do not hesitate to hint that this\r\ncondition is responsible for many of the failures on {148} their part\r\nto do what they ought to do, or at least what they think they would\r\nlike to do; but self-control and self-discipline require such constant\r\nattention and effort that they fail. Even when these patients have not\r\nquite reached the persuasion of a complete secondary personality, they\r\nat least think that the subconscious (or their subliminal self) plays\r\na large role in their conduct. As a consequence, they assert, it is\r\nmore or less beyond their power to control themselves, and their\r\nresponsibility for certain acts is surely somewhat impaired. This is a\r\nrather satisfying doctrine for those who do not feel quite equal to\r\nthe effort of conquering vicious or unfortunate tendencies. Those who\r\nlike to have some excuse for self-indulgence take refuge in this\r\nsupposedly scientific explanation to absolve them from blame, and from\r\nthe necessity of self-control. The drug habitue, the inebriate, the\r\nvictim of other habits, sometimes hug this flattering invention to\r\ntheir souls, especially when they are of the class who delight in the\r\nstudy of the abnormal. Reform becomes well-nigh impossible as long as\r\nsuch an auto-suggestion of inherent weakness and lack of will-power is\r\nat work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Other Self.--From the beginning of written history, man has always\r\nbeen inclined to find some scapegoat for his failings. The story of\r\nAdam blaming the first fault on the woman and the woman blaming it on\r\nthe serpent, is a lively symbol of what their descendants have been\r\ndoing ever since. The less personal the blame is, the better, and the\r\nmore it can be foisted over on some inevitable condition of human\r\nnature, the more generally satisfying it is. A secondary personality\r\ncan scarcely resent being blamed for its acts by the primary\r\npersonality to which it is attached, and so the field of\r\nauto-suggestion as to the blameless inevitability of certain acts is\r\nlikely to widen if it is given a quasi-scientific basis. Long ago St.\r\nPaul spoke of the law in his members opposed to the higher authority,\r\nand declared that the things he would do he did not, while what he\r\nwould not do he sometimes did. There is no doubt that there are two\r\nnatures in the curious personality of man. Everyone at times has the\r\nuncanny feeling that there is something within almost apart from\r\nhimself, leading him in ways that he does not quite understand.\r\nUsually the leading is away from what is considered best in us. But\r\nthose who have dwelt much on the better side of man and have tried to\r\nclimb above mere selfish aims, have realized that there is also a\r\npower within them leading to higher paths. Indeed, some of the\r\ngreatest thoughts that men think, and the resolves that lift them up\r\nto heroic heights, are apparently so far beyond ordinary human powers,\r\nthat the hero and the poet and even the more ordinary literary man, is\r\nquite ready to proclaim inspiration as the source of his best\r\nideas--as if they were breathed into him from without and above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Responsibility.--For ordinary normal individuals, this\r\nquestion of secondary personality has scant interest. Normal persons\r\ngo about their work realizing that what they want to do, they may do,\r\nand what they do not want to do they can keep from doing, unless some\r\ncontrary _physical_ force intervenes. There are many metaphysical\r\narguments for free will, but none of them is so convincing as the\r\nobservation that every sane man, with regard to his own actions, has\r\nthe power to choose between two things that attract him. He may be\r\nmuch drawn to one thing, yet choose another. He may allow himself to\r\nbe ruled by baser motives; he may sternly follow the {149} dictates of\r\nreason, or he may do neither and hold himself inactive. In any case,\r\nhe realizes his power to choose. While this power may be impaired by\r\nmany external conditions, his consciousness of its actuality makes him\r\nappreciate his responsibility. He realizes that punishment for wrong\r\ndone is not only a part of the law, but it is also a proper\r\nvindication of that consciousness of free will which all men have, and\r\nwhich does not deceive them. The question has been obscured by much\r\ntalk, but the reality is there, and the common-sense of mankind has\r\nproclaimed its truth. All our laws are founded on it. Without it\r\npunishment as meted out is an awful injustice and crime is a misnomer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical Phenomena.--Most of the cases of secondary personality that\r\nhave been discussed at greatest length have been in persons who were\r\nas desirous of attracting attention, and as pleased over being the\r\nsubject of special study as were the hysterical patients who used to\r\ndelight in investigation two generations ago. That most of the\r\nphenomena of so-called dual personalities are mainly hysterical seems\r\nnow to be clear. In a few cases, where the patient has found that the\r\nexistence of a double personality was of special interest, a definite\r\ntendency to the formation of further personalities has been noted.\r\nSome triple personalities have been discussed and, in a few cases, a\r\ngroup of personalities, even up to five or more, began to assert\r\nthemselves. This _reductio ad absurdum_, of the hypothesis of\r\nsupernumerary personality has revealed the real hysteric character of\r\nthe phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of secondary personality in recent years vividly\r\nrecalls commonplaces in the older medical literature that gathered\r\naround the study of hysteria, and that afford a striking confirmation\r\nof the conclusion as to the relation of the conditions ascribed to\r\nhysteria. Physicians of a generation or two ago who found their\r\nhysterical patients interesting, because of certain marvelous symptoms\r\nwhich they presented, were usually astonished to learn that their\r\npatients could, under suggestion, develop still further and more\r\nsurprising symptoms. Each new visit, especially when other physicians\r\nwere brought to see the patient, showed the existence of still further\r\nsymptoms and revealed new depths of interesting disease. Indeed, the\r\nsoil was found to be inexhaustible in its power to produce ever new\r\nand interesting crops of symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhen the real significance of hysteria as a mental condition in which\r\npatients devoted themselves to the task of furnishing new symptoms for\r\nthe physician began to be realized, one of the most potent objections\r\nagainst this explanation was that it would have been impossible for\r\nthe patients to have studied out their symptoms enough to furnish the\r\nnew material for study which physicians found so interesting. The\r\npatients were supposed to be mentally incapable of fooling the\r\nphysicians. When, however, a person devotes entire attention to the\r\none subject of making phenomena in themselves appear interesting to\r\nothers, some very startling results are usually produced.\r\n\r\nAfter having attracted the sensational attention so common with any\r\nnovel observation and having been exaggerated out of all proportion to\r\nits due significance, the phenomenon is now settling down to its\r\nproper place--a rather obscure neurotic phenomenon of memory in\r\nhysteric individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Neurotic Symptoms_.--Janet's studies at the Salpetriere seem to\r\nshow that the alterations of memory which bring about what we call\r\n{150} secondary personality (the forgetting of certain phases of\r\nexistence and the maintenance for a time of a small portion of\r\nconsciousness and memory quite apart from the rest) correspond with\r\nalterations in the physical basis of memory, that is, in the\r\ncirculation to certain portions of the brain, and probably also in the\r\nmodes of association of brain cells. They occur, particularly, in\r\nconnection with certain phenomena of hystero-epilepsy so-called, or\r\nwith the deeper forms of epilepsy in which there are various\r\nparesthesias, hyperesthesias and anesthesias as a consequence of a\r\ndisturbance of the circulation in the central nervous system; and\r\nprobably also of the connections made by neurons and the movements of\r\nneuroglia cells in making and breaking these connections. These\r\nalterations of memory are represented physically by such cases as\r\nthose in which patients so lose their consciousness of sensation that\r\nthey are unable to tell even where their feet are. As they themselves\r\nsay, \"they have lost their legs.\" In these cases, patients are often\r\nvery deaf or have a limited auditory power, and their fields of vision\r\nare extremely narrowed. In most of these cases, recovery of the\r\noriginal personality takes place after hypnosis. This probably\r\nrepresents a relaxation of that short-circuiting, within the nervous\r\nsystem, which brought about the curious phenomenon studied as\r\nsecondary personality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDual Dispositions.--The studies of secondary personality that we have\r\nhad seem to show us persons under the influence of some strong\r\nsuggestion, in what is practically a hypnotic condition. There are\r\nmany similarities between the actions and the mentality of hypnotics\r\nand of those in secondary-personality conditions. The individuals are,\r\nfor the moment, unable to recall what happened in other states. They\r\nmay be very different in disposition, gentle and tractable in one\r\nstate, but morose and difficult to get along with in another. Such\r\ndifferences are, however, only exaggerations of the variations of\r\nnormal personality. There are times when, under the stress of\r\ncircumstances, even the mildest of men and women become querulous and\r\ndifficult. It is often noted that people are much more gentle and\r\ncareful in their relations with some people than with others. Men who\r\nare known in their business relations to be quiet, easy to get along\r\nwith, are at times bears in their homes. This is a matter of the\r\nexercise of inhibition for certain mental qualities, and this\r\ninhibition is neglected for some places and persons. An American\r\nhumorist said not long since that a young girl passing a weekend at\r\nthe house of a friend, should remember that she is expected to be\r\nunselfish, thoughtful for others, and ready to help her hostess to\r\nmake it pleasant for others, so that the party may be successful. He\r\nadds that, of course, as soon as she returns home she should be\r\nperfectly natural again.\r\n\r\nAt least in a limited sense, all of us have buried in us secondary\r\npersonalities that are due to a lack of control of ourselves, or\r\noccasionally to a lack of such initiative as makes possible the best\r\nthat is in us. The secondary personality of some people, that side of\r\ntheir characters that their friends see only rarely, is the best side\r\nof them. Many people, under the demand of some great purpose, rise up\r\nto be really heroic in quality, yet in the commonplace relations of\r\nlife they are quite ordinary. The secondary personality in either of\r\nthese cases is not something abnormal. It is due to a tapping of\r\ndeeper levels in personality than most people realize that they\r\npossess. When taken in connection with hypnotism and the power of\r\nsuggestion over {151} susceptible individuals, these adumbrations of\r\nthe deeper problem of secondary personality as the psychologists have\r\ndiscussed it, furnish the best data for its fuller explanation.\r\nExcuses for actions founded on secondary personality must either rest\r\nultimately on insanity, or else on that lack of inhibition which\r\nconstitutes the source of so many of our actions that we regret.\r\n\r\nPeople who are susceptible to hypnotism may remember absolutely\r\nnothing of what occurs to them in the hypnotic condition, though they\r\nwill recall it without any difficulty if during hypnosis it is\r\nsuggested to them that they should remember it. This represents the\r\nmost prominent feature of secondary personality; the individuals who\r\nare affected by it do not recall in one state of personality what\r\nhappens to them in the other. In the two states they are very\r\ndifferent in character. These differences have been much emphasized\r\nwith regard to a few cases that are especially abnormal and have not\r\nattracted much attention in cases where the differences are slight.\r\nIndeed, in a number of the cases where secondary personality asserted\r\nitself, the differences in the character of the individual in the two\r\nstates were practically nil. The only difference was a lapse of memory\r\nfor certain important events. Considerations such as these help in the\r\nunderstanding and psychotherapy of what are sometimes puzzling cases\r\nof apparent dualism of disposition.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to do with here are the suggestions of secondary\r\npersonality which neurotic patients have been inclined to make to\r\nthemselves as a consequence of the interest in the subject in recent\r\nyears. The investigations of Head and of Gordon Holmes have\r\nundoubtedly shown, however, that there are true pathological\r\nconditions associated with certain definite and very marked\r\nmanifestations of dualism of disposition consequent upon lesions in\r\nthe optic thalamus. These cases so far as can be judged at the present\r\ntime, at least, are quite rare and at most would account for duality\r\nand not for the plurality of personality that has come to be discussed\r\nby certain enthusiastic neurologists in recent years. The magnificent\r\nwork done on this shows how much may yet be accomplished in the\r\nelucidation of nervous diseases by faithful study and investigation of\r\nselected cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHYPNOTISM\r\n\r\nHypnotism is popularly supposed to be a mysterious psychological\r\nprocess by which susceptible subjects are brought under the influence\r\nof a person possessing some marvelous power over others' minds and\r\nwills. According to this supposition, during the periods in which the\r\nsubjects are under this influence, they either have some new source of\r\nenergy transferred to them from the operator's strong personality, or\r\nelse they share to some extent in the will power possessed by him. In\r\nthe midst of the sub-consciousness which characterizes the hypnotic\r\ncondition, then, they are in some way endowed with new strength, which\r\nenables them to overcome obstacles to physical or mental health, some\r\nof which seemed at least quite insurmountable under their normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n{152}\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, hypnotism is much simpler than this, consisting\r\nmerely of a state of mental absorption in which all distracting\r\nthoughts are for the moment warded off, and only such thoughts as are\r\nsuggested by the hypnotist reach the consciousness of the patient. The\r\nessence of hypnotism is the concentration of mind on one idea or only\r\na few ideas dictated by the hypnotist. This mental concentration\r\nproduces the effect of greater strength, whether apparent or real, to\r\ncarry out the purposes connected with those thoughts. It is usually\r\nconsidered that hypnotism involves sleep, and in some cases it does.\r\nThis is often undesirable. True, therapeutic hypnosis leaves at least\r\ncertain senses of the subject open to perceive such things as are\r\npresented by the hypnotist's suggestion though these senses may be,\r\nand usually are, quite closed to all other perceptions. In a great\r\nmany cases, though there is a real hypnotic condition, a state\r\nresembling true sleep does not occur. There is only a more or less\r\ncomplete concentration of attention on the suggestions of the\r\noperator, and a complete cessation of all spontaneous thought, or of\r\nall suggestions that might come in ordinary ways from the subject's\r\nown senses.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Hypnotism.--Most people have a very erroneous notion with\r\nregard to the effects of hypnotism. Some expect that the hypnotic\r\nsleep will work miracles. Nothing is more common in the experience of\r\none who is known to employ hypnotism, even occasionally, than to have\r\na patient who is addicted to some habit, alcoholic, drug, or sexual,\r\nask, \"Do you hypnotize?\" If an affirmative answer is given, the\r\npatient proceeds to say that he has heard that one can be hypnotized,\r\nand then all the tendency to fall back into the old habit is\r\nimmediately lost, and he has no further bother from it. This supposed\r\nmiraculous effect of hypnotism in supplanting the necessity for using\r\nthe human will has been cultivated very sedulously in the public mind\r\nby quacks and charlatans of various kinds and even exploiters of\r\nhypnotism who belong to the medical profession. But there is nothing\r\nin it. Hypnotism will not change character unless it be for the worse,\r\nsince the habit of it sometimes leads to dependence on suggestion\r\nrather than spontaneous motives. Hypnotism cannot be substituted for\r\nweakness of will. The suggestions given in the hypnotic state are\r\npractically no stronger than those given in the waking state, if the\r\npatient would only equally concentrate his mind to receive them, and\r\nwould be as ready in response. It is the readiness of response which\r\ncomes in cumulative fashion, in the midst of the utter abstraction\r\nfrom other thoughts, that characterizes the hypnotic condition.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, quite a different valuation of hypnotism from the\r\nvery strong expressions, with regard to the power of hypnotists to\r\ninfluence the human will, which have at various times been made. These\r\nexaggerated claims have been no stronger than those often made for\r\nremedies of various kinds that have been long since discredited. I\r\nhave heard a serious though young professor of psychology declare that\r\nhe was not sure whether he was justified in using all the power that\r\nhe possessed by hypnotism to influence men's wills to keep them from\r\nindulging in liquor to excess, because after all men had a right to\r\ntheir free will, even in a matter of this kind, and it would be wrong\r\nto take it away from them. He added very philosophically that no human\r\nbeing had the right to play the role of Providence in directing\r\nothers' actions even for good, unless they themselves were perfectly\r\nsatisfied. {153} If there was any such force in hypnotism as is thus\r\nsuggested, the reformation of the world, or still more its\r\ndeformation, at the hands of some of the strong-minded practicers of\r\nhypnotism, would be a comparatively easy process. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, the hypnotizer has, except as regards abnormally suggestible\r\npeople, only as much influence over the person hypnotized as the\r\nsubject permits, and the subject retains all his personality as an\r\nindividual with all his weaknesses. After he has been helped away from\r\nhis weaknesses by hypnotism, he is just as likely as ever to yield to\r\nthem again, unless, during the interval of conquest, he has succeeded\r\nin bracing up his will to resist them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMER METHODS OF HYPNOTIZATION\r\n\r\nAll the methods of hypnotizing, then, are directed to securing this\r\nstate of concentration of the patient's mind. The hypnotic state is\r\nbrought about in different ways by different operators, and even the\r\nsame operator must employ quite different methods to secure hypnotic\r\ninfluence over different subjects. In the old times, mysterious passes\r\nand strokings and rubbings of various kinds, and instruments that\r\nflashed light, or that made special sounds, were employed. Among the\r\npioneers, each worker invented methods of his own. A review of these\r\nwill bring out the fact that none of them represents essentials, and\r\nthat they are only auxiliaries to secure concentration of the\r\npatient's mind.\r\n\r\nThe methods of hypnotism practiced by those most noted in the history\r\nof the art were very different from one another, but not more\r\ndifferent than are the methods in vogue to-day among individual\r\nhypnotizers. Indeed, the practices of the past have come down as a\r\nheritage to our own time. Stroking and touching, of which we have\r\nhints in the oldest times in Egypt and Babylonia and Greece, have\r\nalways been prominent features. Valentine Greatrakes dreamt that he\r\nheard a voice in his dream telling him that his right hand should be\r\ndead and that stroking it with his left should cause it to recover its\r\npower once more. After this had happened three times in succession he\r\nbegan to apply this method to the ills of others. Greatrakes seems\r\nreally to have come in to replace the touching by the king for the\r\nKing's Evil at a time when there was no king in England, Pastor\r\nGassner, the next worker who attracted attention by hypnotic\r\nprocedures, used words of command after attracting the profound\r\nattention of his patients. Father Hell employed the touch of magnets.\r\nMesmer used music to predispose the mind, but had many of the methods\r\nof modern hypnotists.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesmer.--While Mesmer undoubtedly attracted attention to certain\r\nphases of hypnotism that were to prove valuable, he was by no means\r\nthe first to do so, and what he did had such a tincture of\r\ncharlatanism it is no wonder that he was discredited. There was a\r\nlittle truth, but there was a deal of mere pretense in his work. While\r\nhe undoubtedly obtained results, he did so mainly because of certain\r\nmentally impressive methods that he employed in connection with\r\nwhatever of hypnotism he used. Binet and Fere, who have given us some\r\ndetails of his work, describe his methods in such a way as to make it\r\nclear that they smacked largely of quackery:\r\n\r\n{154}\r\n\r\n  Mesmer, wearing a coat of lilac silk, walked up and down amid his\r\n  agitated throng, accompanied by Dezlon and his associates, whom he\r\n  chose for their youth and comeliness. Mesmer carried a long iron\r\n  wand with which he touched the bodies of the patients and especially\r\n  the diseased parts. Often laying aside the wand, he magnetized the\r\n  patients with his eyes, fixing his gaze on theirs, or applying his\r\n  hand to the hypochondriac region and to the abdomen. This\r\n  application was often applied for hours, and at other times the\r\n  master made use of passes. He began by placing himself \"en rapport\"\r\n  with his subject. Seated opposite to him, foot against foot, knee\r\n  against knee, Mesmer laid his fingers upon the hypochondriac region\r\n  and moved them to and fro, lightly touching the ribs. Magnetism,\r\n  with strong electric currents, was substituted for these\r\n  manipulations when more energetic results were to be produced. The\r\n  master, raising his fingers in a pyramidal form, passed his hands\r\n  all over the patient's body, beginning with the head, and going\r\n  downward over the shoulders to the feet. He then returned to the\r\n  head, both back and front, then the belly and the back, and renewed\r\n  the process again and again until the magnetized person was\r\n  saturated with the healing fluid and transported with pain or\r\n  pleasure, both sensations being equally salutary. Young women were\r\n  so much gratified by the crisis that they wished to be thrown into\r\n  it anew. They followed Mesmer through the halls and confessed that\r\n  it was impossible not to be warmly attached to the person of the\r\n  magnetizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Puysegur and His Successors.--De Puysegur has some definite\r\ninstructions for hypnotizers, whom he called magnetizers. It is\r\ninstructive even now to read these, for they emphasize the most\r\nimportant element in all hypnotism, the confidence of the operator in\r\nhis own power, for this, communicated to the subject, produces the\r\nbeneficial results:\r\n\r\n  You are to consider yourself as a magnet; your arms, and\r\n  particularly your hands, being its poles; and when you touch a\r\n  patient by laying one of your hands on his back, and the other in\r\n  direct opposition upon his stomach, you are to imagine that the\r\n  magnetic fluid has a tendency to circulate from one hand to the\r\n  other through the body of the patient. You may vary this position by\r\n  placing one hand on the head and the other on the stomach, still\r\n  with the same intention, the same desire of doing good. The\r\n  circulation from one hand to the other will continue, the head and\r\n  stomach being the parts of the body where the greatest number of\r\n  nerves converge; these are, therefore, the two centres to which your\r\n  action ought to be mostly directed. Friction is quite unnecessary;\r\n  it is sufficient to touch with great attention.\r\n\r\nSome of these methods continued to be employed by the successors of\r\nMesmer and De Puysegur, the sense of touch being the principal\r\nadjuvant, though Mesmer employed also the sense of hearing. Braid\r\nseems to have been the first to realize that the sense of sight could\r\nbe used effectively, or perhaps that the tiring of the muscle sense\r\nmight well serve as a point for the concentration of attention. He\r\nused the flash of a light from some bright object or tired the eye\r\nmuscles by having the patient look upward at some object brought near\r\nso as to require convergence of vision. His methods were imitated by\r\nmost of the hypnotizers of the nineteenth century. Liebault and\r\nBernheim, at Nancy, employed them regularly, and they were used in the\r\ninvestigations at the Salpetriere. It was found, however, that after a\r\npatient had been once hypnotized, all that was needed was a word of\r\ncommand or a definite suggestion, and the hypnotic state recurred.\r\nFurther experience showed also that the original hypnotic phenomena\r\nmight, in most cases, be secured very simply by word-suggestion to the\r\npatient, though some individuals required persistent efforts in the\r\napplication of several methods {155} to secure the concentration of\r\nmind on a single idea or set of ideas that is the essence of\r\nhypnotism.\r\n\r\nBy most serious hypnotists, especially those who use hypnotism for\r\ntherapeutic purposes, all the rubbings and manipulations are now\r\neither completely eliminated, or are used only under special\r\ncircumstances. The important element of the operator's influence\r\nconsists in obtaining the complete confidence of the subject in the\r\noperator's power to control his intelligence for the time being;\r\ngetting the subject to resign himself completely, with absolute\r\nassurance that his trust will be for his good, and can by no means\r\nresult in harm. Without this attitude of mind on the part of the\r\nsubject, anything like real hypnotism is impossible. Even with this,\r\nonly a slight degree of the hypnotic condition may be secured in\r\ncertain people, but the majority have a distinct susceptibility to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT DAY METHODS OF HYPNOTIZATION\r\n\r\nThough various methods of producing the hypnotic sleep are in use, the\r\nrule is now that, in the course of a hypnotizer's experience, less and\r\nless external auxiliaries of any kind are needed, and more and more\r\ndependence is placed on the bringing about of mental _rapport_ between\r\nthe active and passive agencies in hypnotism by persuasion and\r\ncommand. If the hypnotic sleep has once been obtained, usually all\r\nthat is necessary is a few gentle words, and then the command to\r\nsleep. It is at the initial attempts to hypnotize a particular person\r\nsomewhat refractory to the condition that auxiliaries are needed. In\r\nthese cases it is often well to tire the eyes of the patient. This is\r\ndone by directing them to the fingers of the operator held well above\r\nthe patient's head. After a minute or two of effort the distinct\r\nfatigue which occurs may induce forgetfulness of everything else and\r\ncause absorption in the single idea of attending only to the\r\nhypnotizer's suggestions. This constitutes the beginning of hypnotism.\r\nOccasionally the flash of a bright object, or a revolving mirror, may\r\nbe used, but these are only adjuncts and may be dispensed with\r\nentirely if the operator has the patience and the time to give to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessories.--Some operators use a mirror on which a ray of light is\r\ncast for the purpose of concentrating the attention and bringing about\r\ntiredness of the eye muscles. In so far as it has a more universal\r\napplication, sight is certainly the best sense to act upon. Other\r\nsenses may be appealed to, as I suggest later. Instead of a mirror, a\r\npolished match-box or pencil-case may be used, but as a rule the less\r\nartificiality enters into it and the simpler the procedure, the\r\nbetter. One of the inconveniences of using the flash of a bright\r\nobject is that occasionally patients who are very susceptible may,\r\nafter they have had a number of hypnotic experiences, be thrown into a\r\nhypnotic condition by the flash of a light in the street, or by the\r\nreflection of light from a mirror in their own homes. These conditions\r\nof facile auto-hypnotism constitute one of the serious dangers of the\r\npractice on susceptible subjects. Whatever good may be accomplished by\r\nhypnotism will probably be reached during the first half dozen\r\nseances. To proceed with the treatment beyond this, if it is employed\r\nat regular and short intervals, is almost sure to result in harm\r\nrather than good.\r\n\r\n{156}\r\n\r\nSensations.--Besides sight, sounds have sometimes been used for the\r\npurpose of inducing hypnotism. The ticks of a watch, for instance,\r\nplaced at a little distance and listened to very intently, have been\r\nknown to assist in securing the hypnotic state. Sometimes the sound of\r\na gong, or an imitation of a cathedral chime, have been used in the\r\nsame way. Soft music has also been used by operators with decided\r\nadvantage. It is necessary that the sounds should be of a kind that do\r\nnot disturb, but only attract attention to one sensation, and then, as\r\nconcentration on this is secured, the hypnotic condition results.\r\nPractically any other sensation may be used in the same way. Touch is\r\noften employed. Mesmer stroked his patients gently, and others have\r\nused the same process with advantage. Some of the French workers in\r\nhypnotism have claimed that there were special portions of the body\r\nthe stroking of which was likely to produce this favorable effect.\r\nThey have called these regions zones hypnogenes--areas that give rise\r\nto hypnotic conditions. Strokings of the forehead, of the cheeks, of\r\nthe hands, are favorite locations for these auxiliary touches. In\r\nthis, as with regard to sound, the main thing is to concentrate\r\nattention on some one sensation without producing disturbing thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nStroking.--Stroking seems to affect many people and to easily induce a\r\nsort of hypnoidal condition. It is done very naturally to a child when\r\none wants to console or encourage or admonish slightly but kindly. In\r\nolder people it is a familiar gesture among those who think much of\r\none another, and represents a very natural tendency. Even in the midst\r\nof physical discomfort its effect is quite soothing, and it is evident\r\nthat something resembling hypnotism is at work. Evidently, what really\r\nhappens is a concentration of attention on the sensation thus\r\nproduced, which concentration prevents distracting thoughts from\r\nmaking themselves felt and permits the words of the one who does the\r\nstroking to produce a deeper effect on the mind than would ordinarily\r\nbe possible. This seems to be nature's method of making suggestion\r\nmore effective. It has been adopted, quite spontaneously, by many of\r\nthe pioneers in hypnotism as the result of their observations upon its\r\nefficacy. Lloyd Tuckey calls attention to an illustration of this\r\npractice, which makes clear its effectiveness and at the same time\r\nshows how naturally it suggests itself as a mode of using mental\r\ninfluence. He says:\r\n\r\n  Among the medical men who have come to watch some of my cases was a\r\n  gentleman who seemed much struck at seeing the method I adopted with\r\n  a rather refractory subject. I held his hand and stroked his\r\n  forehead while at the same time suggesting the symptoms of sleep.\r\n  The gentleman told me afterward the reason why he was so interested.\r\n  It appears that he had a few months previously been in attendance on\r\n  a very severe and protracted case of delirium tremens. The patient\r\n  could get no sleep, and the doctor was afraid of death from\r\n  exhaustion. On the third evening he resolved to make a strong effort\r\n  to produce sleep, and, if necessary, to sit up all night with the\r\n  patient. He told the man that he would not leave him until he slept,\r\n  and sitting down by the bedside, he took his hand in one of his own,\r\n  and with the other gently stroked the forehead. At the same time he\r\n  talked quietly and reassuringly to him. In less than half an hour he\r\n  was rewarded by seeing the restlessness entirely cease and the man\r\n  drop off into a quiet sleep. That sleep, the doctor told me, lasted\r\n  fourteen hours, and the patient awoke out of it weak, but cured.\r\n  Manipulation about the head has in many persons a most soporific\r\n  effect, and several persons have told me that they always become\r\n  drowsy under their barber's hands.\r\n\r\n{157}\r\n\r\nDrugs.--A number of drugs and related substances have been used as\r\naids to hypnosis, but in nearly all of these cases it is doubtful\r\nwhether it is true hypnotism that results and whether the suggestions\r\nin these states have much therapeutic value. One of the drugs most\r\nfrequently administered by hypnotists is _cannabis indica_, which has\r\nlong been used in the East for a similar purpose. After this,\r\nchloroform is most popular. Schrenck-Notzing even ventured to employ\r\nalcohol as an aid in hypnosis, and claims that he has succeeded at\r\ntimes in making intoxication pass into the true hypnotic condition.\r\nBernheim and many others of the French school have used chloral and\r\nmorphine. These substances are, however, liable to great abuse.\r\nWhenever they have to be employed it means that the patient is but\r\nlittle susceptible to hypnotic influence. These aids are employed only\r\nbecause hypnotists do not want to confess that a very considerable\r\nportion of humanity is not directly susceptible to the hypnotic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nSerious harm may be done by the employment of these drugs. A\r\nphysician, who hoped that he would be able to overcome a drug\r\naddiction that had been the bane of his existence for a long while,\r\nwent to a well-known hypnotist physician with the idea that perhaps\r\nthe miracle of hypnotism would be worked in his case. He was one of\r\nthese flighty mortals whom it is extremely difficult to have fix their\r\nminds upon any one idea for a definite time. As it was impossible to\r\nbring him into anything like a hypnotic condition by ordinary means, a\r\nlarge dose of chloral was administered. He already had an idea that\r\nhis heart had been affected by his previous drug-taking habit, but the\r\nchloral was administered to him before he realized what it was. When\r\nhe came out of the sleep it induced, he was in an agony of solicitude\r\nand anxiety lest his heart should have been further hurt by the\r\nchloral. He went back for no more doses of that kind of hypnotism.\r\n\r\nThe use of drugs seems to be a confession of failure to secure true\r\nhypnotism, so that it is doubtful whether their employment is\r\njustified. Suggestions received while in the more or less comatose\r\nstate induced by drugs, instead of having a strengthening effect on\r\nthe patient's will, rather tend to produce the idea of the\r\nimpossibility of effectively using his own will, or even exercising\r\nhis will when helped, as he supposes, by the will of the operator. The\r\nreal value of hypnotism consists in the concentration of mind upon a\r\nparticular idea without any distractions, which enables the subject to\r\nmake firm resolutions and then to have his mind help his body as much\r\nas possible by directing his energy to the accomplishment of one end.\r\nWhen drugs are employed, they have a diffusive rather than a\r\nconcentrating influence, so that the real purpose of hypnotism is\r\nentirely missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICE OF HYPNOTISM\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary practice of hypnotism now, the patient is placed\r\nsitting on a comfortable chair and the operator on one side facing\r\nprepares the mind of the subject by proper assurances. The patient\r\nmust be brought into a thoroughly assured and comfortable state of\r\nmind and must be quite ready to submit to hypnotism. Then in most\r\npeople, if the finger is held rather close to the patient and well\r\nabove the line of sight, requiring special effort {158} on the part of\r\nthe superior recti muscles as well as of the power of convergence, a\r\ntired feeling will come over the subject with a tendency of the lids\r\nto droop. When this happens the subject is asked to allow the lids to\r\ndrop and to quietly concentrate the attention on the idea of sleep so\r\nas to permit the drowsy feeling gradually to increase. On a first\r\nseance this may take ten minutes, subsequently much less time will be\r\nneeded, and, as a rule, in five minutes the subject is quite\r\npredisposed to sleep. In more difficult cases a much longer time may\r\nbe needed, and repeated efforts may have to be made. Great patience is\r\nrequired. The operator soon learns to adjust himself to certain\r\npeculiarities of individuals in predisposing them to the hypnotic\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypnotism Simple, Natural, Not Mysterious.--The most important thing\r\nto know about hypnotism is the fact that any one who wishes can\r\nhypnotize. There may be need for favoring circumstances, but there is\r\nno need for any special faculty in the operator. If he has confidence\r\nin himself so as to take up the question of hypnotizing seriously, if\r\nthe subjects are reasonably susceptible and if they are persuaded that\r\nthey may be hypnotized, or even if they are not, so long as they take\r\nthe operator seriously a hypnotic state will result. Nothing is more\r\nsurprising to the operator himself, the first time he succeeds, than\r\nhis success. This at once gives him renewed confidence, and future\r\nhypnosis becomes a comparatively simple matter. To have this idea\r\nwidely diffused would do much good, since it would at once strip the\r\ncharlatans, who abuse hypnotism, of most of the mystery that surrounds\r\nthem. The general diffusion of such knowledge would also do good in\r\nanother way. It would expose the supposed wonderful power that some\r\npeople are presumed to possess. Hypnotism works no wonders; it is a\r\nmere natural manifestation not unlike sleep, and probably not a whit\r\nmore mysterious.\r\n\r\n\r\nStages.--A number of divisions of the hypnotic state have been\r\nsuggested, but probably the simple division into three stages is the\r\nbest for ordinary teaching purposes, and helps to the understanding\r\nboth of the conditions themselves and of many things that are written\r\nabout hypnotism.\r\n\r\nThe first stage consists of a subdued, dreamy condition, in which the\r\npatient is not asleep and yet not thoroughly awake to all that is\r\ngoing on around him. He has his mind so concentrated on certain\r\nthoughts that he is preoccupied, and suggestions are much more\r\nefficient than under ordinary circumstances. This is really only a\r\nstate of intense attention to the suggestions that are being made,\r\nwith the banishment of all distracting thoughts. It is rather\r\ndifficult for any one to keep from being distracted, and whenever this\r\nis accomplished, the ideas that then enter the mind penetrate more\r\ndeeply and, above all, seem to affect the will more forcibly than when\r\nthey are merely superficially considered. This first stage of\r\nhypnotism would not be considered hypnotic by most people who\r\nassociate the idea of sleep with hypnotism.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has been found that most of the good that is\r\naccomplished, especially for nervous people, by hypnotic suggestion,\r\ncan be attained almost, if not quite as well, in this first stage, and\r\nwithout the hypnotic trance. The first stage is much less liable to\r\nthe dangers of hypnotism in many ways, and it represents one of the\r\nmost interesting phases of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n{159}\r\n\r\nThe second stage of hypnotism is the hypnotic sleep. The patient loses\r\nconsciousness of his surroundings, though his senses are still open to\r\nsuggestion from the operator. Practically all that happens in the room\r\napart from what is brought to the subject through the operator's\r\ndirection remains unnoticed. If the sleep is very deep, even the\r\nsuggestions of the operator do not penetrate after a time, so it may\r\nbe quite difficult to awaken the subject. It may be even some hours\r\nbefore the person hypnotized will come out of the lethargy which has\r\nbeen induced in these cases. Under these circumstances, this second\r\nstage partakes somewhat of the nature of the deeper trance condition\r\nthat characterizes the third stage.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of hypnotism consists of a profound trance-like\r\ncondition in which there is catalepsy--that is, firm contracture of\r\nmuscles all over the body--and as the extensors are stronger than the\r\nflexors, this contracture takes place in the extended position. The\r\ncataleptic condition is really a nervous spasmodic seizure rather than\r\na true stage of hypnotism. It is probably always harmful for the\r\npatient to have it induced. Its occurrence as one manifestation of\r\nhysteria, apart from hypnotism, shows its real character. It is with\r\nthis stage of hypnotism that professional hypnotists, who give\r\nexhibitions, make their demonstrations--that is, of course, when their\r\ndemonstrations are really hypnotic and are not merely, as is often the\r\ncase, performances by actors trained for the purpose. Catalepsy is\r\nentirely pathological; experiment with it then is eminently\r\nundesirable, and certainly should not be undertaken except under the\r\nmost careful precautions and by a physician. One of its dangers was\r\nvery clearly pointed out by the death of a young man, who in a\r\ncataleptic condition was subjected to certain strains upon his thorax\r\nwhich brought about the rupture of an aortic aneurism. Catalepsy never\r\npermits of suggestion in such a way as to be helpful to the patient.\r\nIt always leads to further functional deterioration of the nervous\r\nsystem, and yet it has unfortunately come to mean for many people the\r\nmost essential characteristic of hypnotism. Its production is supposed\r\nto represent the acme of skill in the hypnotist. Nothing could\r\npossibly be less true nor be more likely to do harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusceptibility.--As to the number of people who are susceptible to\r\nhypnotism, there are great differences of opinion. Liebault declared\r\nthat practically every one is susceptible in the hands of a patient\r\noperator. In a carefully made series of cases his failures were less\r\nthan three per cent. Van Rentergehem and Van Eeden, in a series of\r\nover 1,000 persons, failed only with fifty-eight, or little more than\r\nfive per cent. Schrenk-Notzing's statistics, collected from many\r\ncountries, seem to show that only about six per cent. were\r\nuninfluenced. Bernheim, at Nancy, was not nearly so successful as\r\nLiebault, his master, and his failures amounted to twenty-five per\r\ncent. at the beginning and at least twenty per cent. later. I remember\r\nthat when I was at the Saltpetriere fifteen years ago, they were\r\ninclined to discount the enthusiasm of the Nancy school with regard to\r\nthe value and significance of hypnotism. They insisted that probably\r\nnot more than one out of two of the persons presenting themselves at a\r\nnervous clinic could be hypnotized to the extent that is ordinarily\r\nassociated with the word--could be brought beyond the drowsy stage.\r\nThere are other workers in the subject who have insisted that not more\r\nthan one out of three ordinary individuals can be so {160} deeply\r\nhypnotized as to exhibit the ordinary symptoms. These symptoms consist\r\nof complete neglect of surroundings and absolute absorption in the\r\nsuggestions of the operator.\r\n\r\nSome people can be hypnotized to the extent of being thrown into sleep\r\nand yet walk and talk under the absolute control of the operator.\r\nThese are so-called somnambules, the class of persons who are\r\nexhibited by professional hypnotizers who want to attract popular\r\nattention, and, indeed, the class usually exhibited by physicians\r\nbefore medical societies, and even by professors before their classes.\r\nThis extreme susceptibility is, however, quite rare. Even the most\r\nardent advocates of hypnotism and of the susceptibility of humanity to\r\nit do not claim that more than one in ten of average individuals can\r\nbe influenced to this degree. There are milder degrees of hypnotism\r\nthan this, until we reach a state in which all the patients feel is a\r\ncertain dreamy sense of well-being and a heaviness of the eyes, with a\r\nreadiness to respond to suggestions. Most people who think of the\r\nsomnambulistic stage as representing hypnotism would not consider\r\nthese latter to have been at all subjected to the hypnotic state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Repeated Efforts_.--As to this question of susceptibility, much\r\ndepends on how often the operator has tried to hypnotize the\r\nparticular subject, for susceptibility develops with repeated trials,\r\nnot only where there is a manifest impression at first, but also where\r\nthere is not. It is not uncommon to find that a patient who cannot be\r\nbrought at all under the influence of hypnotism in the first or second\r\nor third trial, will, at the fifth or sixth trial, yield to the\r\nsuggestion to go into a hypnotic sleep. A dozen unsuccessful efforts\r\nmay be followed by the development of a very satisfactory hypnosis.\r\nThose who have practiced hypnotism much tell of having tried a score\r\nor even two score of times before finally bringing on a hypnotic\r\ncondition. Dr. J. Milne Bramwell, one of the English authorities on\r\nhypnotism, tells the story [Footnote 20] of having tried sixty or more\r\ntimes to hypnotize patients before finally succeeding. It is this\r\npersistence that enables successful hypnotic operators to accomplish\r\nresults where less confident physicians fail. It is also the frequency\r\nof trial that makes all the difference in the statistics as to the\r\nsusceptibility of patients to hypnotism in the hands of different\r\nindividuals. There must be the confidence of the patient in the\r\nphysician's power to hypnotize, but, above all, there must be the\r\nphysician's own confidence in his power to bring on the hypnotic sleep\r\nso that he tries and tries again, even to seventy times.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 20: \"Hypnotism. Its History, Practice and Theory,\" by J. M.\r\n  Bramwell, 2nd edn. London, The De la More Press, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL HYPNOTISM\r\n\r\nThe hypnotization of animals shows that only a very low grade\r\nintelligence is needed for the production of this state. The famous\r\nexperiment of Father Kircher with the hen, which any one may repeat at\r\nany time, is a good illustration. The fascination exerted upon birds\r\nby snakes is another familiar example. The bird is paralyzed with\r\nterror at the sight of the snake, and so cannot escape from its enemy,\r\nfairly glueing its eyes on the terrifying object, and thus loses power\r\nto control its wings. Stories of snake {161} fascination are usually\r\ntold as if the eye of the snake attracted the bird, who thereupon\r\nproceeded to approach the snake. These are, however, doubtful stories.\r\nThe paralysis of motion seems to be the main effect. The rabbit is\r\naffected in nearly the same way. There is a tremor of horror in\r\nanticipation, and then the animal stands perfectly quiet, though\r\nordinarily he would be quite able to escape, while its enemy\r\napproaches. The underlying mechanism is evidently a concentration of\r\nattention, which completely precludes the possibility of the exertion\r\nof any spontaneous energy except that involved in the one act of\r\nwatching the awful object.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGERS OF HYPNOTISM\r\n\r\nThere are many and various opinions of the dangers of hypnotism. Some\r\nof those who have given it a fair trial have insisted on its dangers.\r\nSome of those who have had very large experience have declared\r\nemphatically that there is no danger at all. Occasionally it has\r\nseemed that such a declaration must be considered as having been\r\ndictated by such intensity of interest as sometimes leads men to\r\noverlook the darker side of things with which they are much occupied.\r\nCertain moral aspects of hypnotism are at least dubious, and, it must\r\nbe admitted, present opportunities for abuse. There are certain\r\ndangers connected with its effect upon nervous patients, and\r\nespecially with its influence upon character, that have become more\r\nand more clear in recent years. Dr. John K. Mitchell, in his \"Self\r\nHelp for Nervous Women,\" a series of familiar talks on economy in\r\nnervous expenditure, [Footnote 21] has dwelt on certain of these\r\ndangers of hypnotism for nervous patients in a passage that deserves\r\nto be recalled. As a representative of a school of thought that is\r\nworthy of special regard from American physicians his expressions must\r\ncarry weight:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 21: Philadelphia, Lippincott, 1909.]\r\n\r\n  The greatest danger of all is the use of hypnotism in any form or\r\n  degree, a two-edged sword, capable indeed of usefulness, but more\r\n  capable of harm. After years of study, beginning with too easy an\r\n  approval of it, hypnotism, whether called by that name or by the\r\n  unsuitable one of suggestion, has been laid aside by the medical\r\n  profession as a means too dangerous for ordinary use, involving\r\n  great risk of deterioration of character in the subject if often\r\n  repeated, and putting a terribly tempting tool in the hands of the\r\n  user, fascinating in the ease with which it can produce superficial\r\n  and temporary good results and equally capable of being used for\r\n  harmful ones.\r\n\r\n  A susceptible person, once hypnotized, is more and more easily\r\n  thrown into the hypnotic state until even the slightest hint\r\n  suffices to bring about the condition. It is not necessary for the\r\n  hypnotization to go so far as deep sleep; this more advanced stage\r\n  is indeed seldom required, and to say that persons are not\r\n  hypnotized because they are not put into a sleep or a trance shows\r\n  ignorance of the subject.\r\n\r\n  I am not asserting that very slight degrees of the hypnotic\r\n  condition are as dangerous as the deeper, but I do say that all\r\n  degrees of it are dangerous to the integrity and healthy action of\r\n  the subject's nervous system. The danger of harm increases with\r\n  every repetition of the hypnotization.\r\n\r\n  In suggestible, that is, over-susceptible, individuals, who are\r\n  almost universally neurotic persons, to fix the eyes on a small\r\n  point, especially a bright one, sometimes even to fix the mind on\r\n  the one idea of going into the hypnotic state (mild or deep), is\r\n  enough without further intervention from any one to put them into\r\n  that state.\r\n\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\nIn an article on the \"Danger and Uses of Hypnotism\" Prof. Forel, of\r\nZurich, twenty years ago, while frankly admitting that hypnotism is by\r\nno means a panacea for all nervous affections and unfortunate habits,\r\nfound it to be an extremely valuable help in the treatment of many\r\nforms of functional nervous disease. He suggests that some of its many\r\ndangers are due to the fact that hypnotism is practiced by men who are\r\ntoo distrustful of it, and this distrust, unconsciously communicated\r\nto the patients, produces an unfortunate effect. On the other hand,\r\nfear and distrust on the part of the subjects seriously disturbs the\r\nprocess of hypnotization, interferes with its effect and sometimes\r\nleads to unfortunate results.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it seems that the state of dependence on some one else,\r\nat least by suggestion, that had been created during the hypnotic\r\nexperience, resulted in a diminution of will power and caused a less\r\nhopeful state on the patient's part than before. I found personally\r\nthat suggestion in the waking state might in most cases be used quite\r\nas efficiently as hypnosis itself, and that when improvement came\r\nunder these circumstances, the patient always felt more confidence in\r\nhimself and less in the operator. Anything that restores\r\nself-confidence and gives patients the feeling that they can conquer\r\ninclinations, tendencies, even habits, if they only will, merely by\r\nfirmly resolving to do so, is the best possible mental influence for\r\nthem. The hypnotic relief is always easier, but nothing that is easy\r\nis likely to be of lasting value. The enduring effect of gradual cure\r\nby suggestion means much more than the hypnotic miracle that these\r\npatients are so prone to crave.\r\n\r\nAt present there is a very general feeling among those who have had\r\nconsiderable experience with hypnotism, that in spite of the claims of\r\ncertain votaries for it, there is no justification for its frequent or\r\nhabitual use. It has a definite place in diagnosis, in certain\r\ndifficult cases, and at the beginning of the treatment of certain\r\nforms of the psycho-neuroses. When repeated frequently it is not\r\ntherapeutic, but is likely to produce serious results in a certain\r\nlack of self-control and tendencies to auto-hypnotization with\r\ndeterioration of character. There is very seldom need of a repetition\r\nof deep hypnosis, and, as a rule, all the diagnostic benefit can be\r\nsecured in one or two seances. Its continued use only illustrates the\r\ntendency noted at all times, in the history of medicine, for the\r\nunthinking or unprofessional to persist in the application of supposed\r\nremedial measures after they have been shown to be useless or even\r\nharmful. The subject well deserves further study, but investigations\r\nshould be carefully made by men who realize the dangers, and who are\r\nnot likely to be tempted to exploit patients and curious psychological\r\nphenomena for the sake of sensational reputation. The use of hypnotism\r\nfor exhibition purposes, by men who are not physicians, is an unmixed\r\nevil, producing entirely wrong impressions on the public, and doing\r\nuntold evil to the subjects employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\n_THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important element in Psychotherapy is the individual patient.\r\nOld Dr. Parry of Bath said a century ago, \"It is much more important\r\nto know what sort of a patient has a disease, than what sort of a\r\ndisease a patient has.\" Mental influence is not of the slightest avail\r\nagainst pneumonia or typhoid fever, nor constipation nor rheumatism as\r\nsuch; mental influence may be, and often is, of the greatest possible\r\nhelp to the patient suffering from any of these diseases.\r\n\r\nWe recognize frankly now that for most diseases we can do nothing to\r\ncounteract the disease directly or to cure it specifically. The idea\r\nof specifics in medicine has to a large extent disappeared. Two or\r\nthree of them possibly we have, but even with regard to these, there\r\nare certain doubts as to the essential modes of their activity. We\r\nhave learned, however, to help the patient to overcome disease. We\r\nknow how to conserve his forces, to increase his vital reaction, to\r\nmaintain his nutrition without disturbing his general condition, and\r\nto secure elimination in such a way as to prevent nature from being\r\ninterfered with in her curative purposes. To this, psychotherapy would\r\nenable us to add such encouragement of the patient as would tap new\r\nsources of energy in him according to the law of reserve energy, and\r\nwould prevent discouragement and the inhibition of favorable nerve\r\nimpulses that so often follow. The outcome of any disease depends on\r\ntwo factors. One is the condition of the patient at the time the\r\ninfection was acquired, the other is the virulence of the infection.\r\nWe can do nothing to modify this latter element, once the disease\r\nmanifests itself. We can, however, do much to enable the patient to\r\nthrow off the disease and, above all, by securing a favorable attitude\r\nof mind, we can enable him to use his forces to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has noted the difference between the patient's state just\r\nbefore and just after his physician has called, though absolutely no\r\nphysical remedy has been employed, is able to realize very well how\r\nmuch psychotherapy is able to accomplish. One who did not know, would\r\nbe sure to assume that some potent remedy had been administered--and\r\nthere has been. This potent remedy is psychotherapy. Whether the\r\npersonal magnetism necessary to produce therapeutic effects of this\r\nkind can be learned or not depends on the individuality of the\r\nphysician. Undoubtedly, however, everyone can add to whatever of\r\npersonal influence he has by definitely recognizing its place, by\r\n{164} making every effort to employ it, and then by regular systematic\r\neffort in securing as much personal information as possible with\r\nregard to the patient. This personal relationship of physician and\r\npatient makes instruction easier and suggestion more effective.\r\n\r\nThe securing of personal information is of the utmost importance in\r\ndetermining the affections that psychotherapy will relieve, because\r\nvery often details of life and habits are discovered that can be so\r\nmodified by instruction as to bring about a disappearance of\r\nunfavorable physical influences. It is indeed surprising to find how\r\nmany unreasonable things people do from habit, from unfortunate\r\npersuasion, or from lack of knowledge. In many of the minor chronic\r\nailments that are the source of so much mental discomfort to patients,\r\nthe physician finds that a change in the patients' habits, not\r\nnecessarily of marked degree, may make all the difference between\r\ncheerful health and rather despondent low-spirited feeling. Now that\r\nepidemic disease has become rarer, a physician's practice, especially\r\namong the better classes, is much more taken up with these minor\r\nailments than with the typical classical diseases.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary history of their ailments, as patients commonly present\r\nthem, especially when there are neurotic elements, is likely to be\r\nmeager in what is objective, but consists mostly of the subjective.\r\nSuch patients have much to say of their sensations, their feelings,\r\ntheir dreads, their surmises, their conclusions as to their particular\r\ncondition, and especially the hereditary elements in it, but\r\ncomparatively little of the objective realities of their ills and of\r\ntheir environment. What the physician needs to know about them is\r\ntheir habits of life, their daily routine of existence, just as\r\nminutely as it is possible to obtain the information. There is just\r\none way to get the latter details, and that is to inquire particularly\r\nwith regard to actual happenings. In chronic conditions of many kinds,\r\nit is so helpful that it will always be worth the physician's while to\r\nget at these details, especially in supposedly puzzling cases for\r\nwhich various forms of treatment have been already tried.\r\n\r\nIn spite of every precaution in this matter, the physician sometimes\r\nfinds, after a series of consultations, that some point which when\r\nbrought to light he considers to be of great importance, has been\r\nthought so trivial by the patient that it was never mentioned, in\r\nspite of the most careful questioning. In all medical practice the\r\nrule is that mistakes of diagnosis are much more due to neglect in\r\neliciting necessary information than either to lack of expertness in\r\ndiagnosis, or lack of knowledge of the significance of symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn the affections that can be relieved by psychotherapeutics, the most\r\nimportant element for diagnosis, besides a minute knowledge of the\r\npatient's habits, is just as detailed information as possible with\r\nregard to his ways and modes of thought as to his ills. Practically\r\nevery motive, as well as every action of the day, must be scrutinized,\r\nand often it will be found that little things mean much for the\r\nindividual. \"Trifles make perfection, but perfection is no trifle,\" as\r\nsaid by Michelangelo, might well be changed for the physician to,\r\n\"Trifles make all the difference between health and discomfort, though\r\nhealth is no trifle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{165}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING HOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn getting the history of patients for diagnostic purposes the safest\r\nway is to begin with the getting up in the morning and then to follow\r\nout the various actions of the day. The hour and mode of rising should\r\nbe inquired into. Practically all nervous people, and nearly all those\r\nbeyond middle life, feel less fit in the morning hours than at any\r\nother time in the day. Apparently as a consequence of their will\r\nhaving been allowed to lose its hold during sleep, it does not secure\r\nthorough command over the organism for some time. Nervous people, as a\r\nrule, wake up with a tired feeling, a dread of the day, wondering\r\nwhether life is worth living. They dread--for it is a real dread--to\r\nget up and tackle the daily round of life once more.\r\n\r\nIf they have nothing very definite to do, then slight tired feelings\r\nor discomfort, even of very minor degree, may lead them to think that\r\nthey cannot get up. Any yielding in this matter is almost sure to do\r\nharm. When there are no objective signs, that is, when there is no\r\nfever recognizable by the thermometer and there has been no diarrhea\r\nor any physical weakness, nervous patients should get up promptly at a\r\nparticular hour every morning, because, as a rule, within a half hour\r\nafter getting up they feel better, and by the time they are washed and\r\nhave had their breakfast, life has grown not only quite possible but\r\neven plausible, and the day's work does not seem such a nightmare as\r\nit was at first. It is not advisable to tell people all this as soon\r\nas they confess their habit of dawdling in the morning, for they must\r\nbe gradually brought to discipline themselves. The detail emphasizes\r\nthe necessity of knowing how they get up as well as when.\r\n\r\n\r\nMode of Awaking.--It is often valuable to know how patients awake.\r\nSometimes it will be found that they are anxious and solicitous to be\r\nat work at a particular hour, or to catch a train at a particular\r\ntime, and that as a consequence their sleep is disturbed in the early\r\nmorning hours. At best it may be fitful and when they awake they fear\r\nto go to sleep again lest they oversleep. An alarm clock will\r\nsometimes remedy this state of affairs. Better still is an arrangement\r\nby which someone, who can be depended on, will wake them at a\r\nparticular time. Occasionally patients cannot content themselves in\r\nspite of the assurance that they will be waked. They dread that the\r\nalarm clock may not go off, or that the awakener may make a mistake,\r\nand so they go to bed with a dominant idea, which is more or less\r\nconstantly present in their mind during all their sleeping hours,\r\ndisturbing sleep and preventing complete rest. It may be necessary to\r\ninsist on a change of occupation for such persons, or a change of\r\nresidence that will do away with the necessity for early rising. When\r\nthis is done, many a neurotic condition that has before proved\r\nintractable will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmount of Sleep.--It is of cardinal importance to know how long\r\npatients sleep. In our large cities most people have too little sleep.\r\nA comparison of the hours when they get to bed with those when they\r\nget up will often show that at least three or four nights in the week\r\nsome patients who are complaining of nervous symptoms, especially\r\nnervous indigestion, are {166} sleeping less than seven hours. There\r\nare but few men, and still fewer women, who will retain their health\r\nunder such conditions. Some men have been able to do it, but they are\r\ncomparatively rare. King Alfred's rule of dividing the day into three\r\neight-hour periods--one for sleep, one for work, and the third for\r\nbodily necessities and recreation, still remains the best for human\r\nnature. Whenever people try to live the strenuous life and get along\r\non less than eight hours of sleep, they are almost sure, sooner or\r\nlater, to render themselves uncomfortable, to make themselves liable\r\nto all sorts of neurotic symptoms and, above all, to detract from\r\ntheir efficiency for whatever work they are engaged in. Whether they\r\nsleep or not, they should be in bed for nearly eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing.--_Morning Bath_.--In our larger cities at least, many of the\r\ninhabitants begin the day with a bath. In this matter one finds all\r\nsorts of harmful fads that need to be corrected. Many men take a cold\r\nbath, and unless they are particularly strong and vigorous, this is\r\nrather an exhausting experience for the beginning of the day, when the\r\nlast nutrition the body absorbed is twelve hours before. On the other\r\nhand, large, athletic men who manufacture a great deal of heat, their\r\nmuscles--the heat-making organs--being well developed, will be\r\nbenefited by having a cold bath because of the abstraction of heat\r\nthat it involves. It is not, however, infrequent to find that the man\r\nfor whom it will be good is not taking it, while the thin, neurotic\r\nindividual, already exhausting more of his vitality by worry and\r\ndieting and in various fads with regard to his health than is good for\r\nhim, is regularly taking his cold plunge or douche. Unless especially\r\nasked about it, few men give particulars in this matter, yet they are\r\nextremely important.\r\n\r\nWomen, on the other hand, are likely to take hot baths more frequently\r\nthan is good for them. Especially when they have maids to assist in\r\ndressing and undressing, it is not unusual to find that women take\r\ntwo, and sometimes even three, hot baths in a day. They take them in\r\nthe early morning when they first get up, and in the evening before\r\ndressing for dinner. I have known cases where some took a third hot\r\nbath before going to bed and sometimes even put in a fourth before\r\nluncheon in case they had had any exercise in the morning\r\nhours--tennis, or horseback riding, or the like--that made them\r\nperspire. These are details which the physician will learn only if he\r\nasks particularly about them. Until he has actually had the experience\r\nof finding that they play an important role in some ailment he is\r\nalmost sure not to think of it. It is probable that even two hot baths\r\na day are too many. I have known women to begin at once to get better\r\nof neurotic symptoms that before had proved quite intractable, when\r\ntheir hot baths were limited or when they were changed for a single\r\nwarm bath with a cold rub after it in the morning, or sometimes just\r\nbefore dinner.\r\n\r\nBathing is more liable to abuse than is usually thought to be\r\npossible. While the habits of modern life call for it often, and many\r\npeople are quite sure that they would not be healthy without it, the\r\npeople who live longest, and who have had the best health far beyond\r\nthree score years and ten, have usually not been noted for bathing\r\nproclivities. The human body is composed of nearly seven-eighths\r\nwater, and so our cells are constantly bathed in it, but the making of\r\nthe whole organism a marine animal once more, as seems to be the\r\ndefinite tendency of some people, is not nearly so hygienic as {167}\r\nit is often thought to be. Enough bathing for thorough cleanliness,\r\nbut not for luxury, must be the rule for people who have active work\r\nand want to retain their health.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bathing Fads_.--While such mistakes are usually made only by the\r\nwealthy and leisure classes, the physician will sometimes be surprised\r\nto find that women who have no maids for personal service are\r\nindulging themselves in these over-frequent bathing practices. They\r\nhave heard that it softens the skin and renews youth, or they have\r\nheard that the Japanese take hot baths and are revivified when they\r\nare very fatigued, and so they go to great lengths in bathing. Often\r\nthis is the main reason for the relaxation of muscle tissue and the\r\nsense of prostration that has come over them. Neurotic people are\r\nconstantly going to extremes. Even delicate women will sometimes be\r\nfound to take very cold baths which are surely doing them harm. Over\r\nfrequent washings of hands and face are sometimes responsible for skin\r\nlesions, especially if the soap used is one of the varieties so\r\nscented that the manufacturer is enabled to conceal the impurities in\r\nits ingredients. Some women easily run into what is really a\r\nmisophobia, an exaggerated morbid fear of dirt, and need to be\r\nrestrained from washing themselves over frequently. Many a chapped\r\nhand would be saved by avoiding unnecessary washings, and especially\r\nin warm water just before one goes out, for it leaves the skin without\r\nits proper oily protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nClothing.--Then comes the question of clothing. It is curious how\r\nirrationally many people clothe themselves. People complain of cold\r\nhands and feet when they are wearing thin cotton undergarments, and\r\nwho need only to have these changed for wool for their feelings to be\r\nat once improved. In the meantime they have been persuaded that they\r\nhave a defective circulation. The usual excuse for not wearing wool is\r\nthat it produces hyperemia of the skin with itchy discomfort, but\r\nthis, as a rule, is only passing and is due to unaccustomedness. The\r\ncoarser wools should not be worn by the sensitive. A thin cotton\r\ngarment may, if absolutely necessary, be worn next the skin. There is\r\ntoo little variety in the underclothing that people wear. Some change\r\nfrom light to heavy weight and only that, but there should be a medium\r\nweight worn, and occasionally, when there is a spell of mild weather\r\nin the winter time, even during the season when heavy weight is\r\nusually worn, medium weight should be substituted for comfort's sake.\r\n\r\nIt is even more common to find that neurotic individuals, who fear to\r\ncatch cold, wear too much clothing, especially around the chest. Very\r\noften they alternate from this during the day to next to nothing in\r\nthe evening, and by so doing subject themselves to special risks of\r\ninternal congestions. When the skin is covered with too much clothing\r\nit loses the habit of reacting, and the warmth and the irritation of\r\nwool keep up an artificial hyperemia which gradually lowers the tone\r\nof the peripheral vessels. Many people wear \"chest protectors,\" as is\r\nevident from the prominent display of these abominations in the\r\ndrug-store windows. By leaving certain portions of the chest\r\nunprotected while other parts are kept over-warm, these add greatly to\r\nthe risk of such disturbances of circulatory equilibrium as predispose\r\nto the infections grouped under the term \"taking cold.\" It is not\r\nheavy clothing that keeps people warm so much as the layers of\r\nnon-conducting air between the skin and the outer air. It is better,\r\ntherefore, to wear three thin {168} garments than two heavy ones\r\nbecause of the additional layers of air that are thus confined. A\r\npaper vest, if one is driving in the wind, will probably protect\r\nbetter than the heaviest woolen garment worn. The wearing of chamois\r\ngarments is not, as a rule, advisable because chamois does not permit\r\nfree access of air and it hampers transpiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Breakfast.--After dressing comes breakfast, with regard to\r\nwhich it may be advisable to ask many questions. It is well to begin\r\nwith a query as to whether liquids are taken before breakfast. Many\r\npeople have taken to the fad of drinking a large quantity of warm\r\nwater, sometimes as much as a pint, before breakfast. Surely this\r\nnever does any good and, in most cases, just as surely does harm.\r\nPlain water will not dissolve mucus that may have collected in the\r\nstomach, and warm water merely dilates that organ, relaxes its fibers,\r\nand renders the whole gastric digestive system atonic. If cold water\r\ncan be borne, it will often be found that a glass of cold water the\r\nfirst thing in the morning stimulates peristalsis, and serves to\r\nlessen the necessity for laxatives. Many people complain that cold\r\nwater is too much of a shock. Usually, if they are reminded that when\r\nwe want to warm our hands we rub them vigorously with cold water and\r\nthat the reaction after this gives a healthy glow, the effect of the\r\nsupposed shock, which was merely an unfavorable suggestion, will\r\ndisappear. Sometimes delicate people cannot drink cold water. If there\r\nis any reason to suspect an accumulation of mucus in the stomach, a\r\nsmall bouillon cup of _very hot water_, just as hot as it can be\r\nborne, in which a pinch of salt and a pinch of bi-carbonate of soda\r\nhave been dissolved will prove an excellent aperitive for the day.\r\nThis is physiological and appropriately chemical, as well as naturally\r\nstimulating. Mucus does not dissolve in ordinary water but dissolves\r\nreadily in an alkaline salt solution, and this is just what is thus\r\nrecommended. This drink is quite grateful to the palate. Indeed, it\r\ntastes very much like clear soup, and, if the eyes are closed, cannot,\r\nas a rule, be distinguished from some of the bouillon commonly served.\r\nI have known this cup of hot water to stimulate an appetite when drug\r\ntonics had failed.\r\n\r\nIt is better to take the glass of cold water from fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes before the morning meal--say immediately on rising. If,\r\ninstead, the small cup of hot water is chosen, it should come\r\nimmediately before eating, and will usually prove an appetizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast.--The exact details of the amount of breakfast taken and how\r\nit is eaten should be known. Nervous people eat little breakfast. When\r\nordered to eat, they find it difficult at first, but the habit is\r\neasily formed, and then they want their breakfast like anyone else. It\r\nis surprising how often physicians will find that nervous persons, who\r\nare under weight, are not taking enough breakfast. They will\r\nordinarily say that they are eating breakfast about as other people do\r\nand will, perhaps, mention eggs and rolls, but it will be found that\r\ntheir ordinary breakfast consists of a roll and piece of toast and\r\ncoffee, and only occasionally do they have any of the other things\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nBreakfast is ordinarily the meal which those who work are likely to\r\neat too hurriedly. Those who are neurotically inclined are especially\r\nvictims of the habit. They lie abed until there is only a few minutes\r\nleft to get the train so as to reach their place of occupation in\r\ntime, and thus their breakfast is {169} skimped. Their oatmeal or\r\nother soft cereal is fairly shovelled in, coffee is gulped, toast is\r\nunchewed, the coffee softening it; if they have creamed potatoes they\r\nare swallowed in such large pieces that, as every physician knows, if\r\nfor some reason they vomit they are surprised, beyond all measure, at\r\nthe large portions they have been able to pass down into their\r\nstomachs. A breakfast thus eaten makes a bad beginning for a nervous\r\nman's day, and the more that is so eaten the worse for the victim.\r\nWith a habit like this, it will be utterly impossible by means of\r\ndrugs or directions as to diet to relieve the discomfort of neurotic\r\nindigestion, or to keep the patient from suffering that stomach\r\ndiscomfort so often complained of in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Women.--Working women are even more prone than are men to take\r\na hurried breakfast, and having, as a rule, less appetite than men,\r\ntheir meal is likely to be deficient. It is not unusual to find that a\r\nyoung woman who is under weight and who needs three meals a day, is\r\ntaking so little for the first meal that even she hesitates to regard\r\nit as a meal. Very often her last previous meal has been taken before\r\nseven o'clock the night before, so that she goes out ill prepared for\r\nher day's work. Much more than men, women are annoyed in the morning\r\nby our transportation systems, and by worry as to whether they will\r\nget to the office on time. Suggestions as to the modification of this\r\nunfortunate routine, the taking of an earlier train, the using of a\r\nquiet local instead of a crowded express, a short walk at least before\r\ntaking the train, will often help in producing a marked change in the\r\ngeneral health.\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Keeping Women.--For those who really have homes, the morning\r\nduties are usually sufficient to rouse their activities and make them\r\nbegin the day well. For those who live in apartment-hotels, however,\r\nand for those who have the luxury of many servants, the morning hours\r\nare often a serious problem. Madame does not get up, or if she does,\r\nit is only to lie around in dressing gown for most of the morning.\r\nBreakfast is easily neglected or may be eaten hurriedly because the\r\nhead of the house is rushing to business. The lack of an incentive\r\nrequiring them to rise, and get outside for a time every morning, is\r\nprobably at the root of more feminine symptoms among leisure class\r\npatients than anything else. As we grow older all of us are likely to\r\nnote the lowered physiological cycle of the morning hours, so that\r\nunless there is some sharp reason to compel action, we are rather\r\nprone to persuade ourselves that it is better to lie abed, or at least\r\nto loll around. This leads to a concentration of attention on self and\r\non one's feelings that easily gives rise to neurotic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in life.--In my special clientele I have often found that\r\ngoing to church in the early morning hours was an excellent remedy for\r\nmany of these patients. It gives them a definite reason for rising\r\npromptly, the service provides motives to rouse them to activity, they\r\nare likely to think during it of how they shall make their life a\r\nlittle bit more livable for others as the result of their trying to be\r\nbetter, and so the apathy that is so fruitful of ill feeling is shaken\r\noff. This can only serve for those who have faith in the service. For\r\nothers, the old-fashioned going out to market, or the making of\r\nappointments at morning hours that will tempt them to regular activity\r\nearly in the day, is of special significance. It is always ominous for\r\nhealth when a woman can look forward to a whole long day without any\r\nparticular duties {170} in it until the late afternoon or evening\r\nhours. This has become so frequently the case for the women of our\r\nlarge cities, particularly those who live in apartment hotels, it is\r\nno wonder that neuroses and psychoneuroses of various kinds have grown\r\nin frequency. The best prophylaxis for them is occupation of mind. The\r\ncure for them is the securing of many interests and such diversion of\r\nmind as will prevent concentration of attention on self.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Before Breakfast.--Many people receive their most important mail\r\nin the early morning, and personal mail, in cities especially, is\r\nlikely to be placed beside the breakfast plate. Not infrequently,\r\nletters contain serious matters that are likely to disturb people, and\r\noccasionally even important business finds its way to the side of the\r\nplate at breakfast time. Authors often find their rejected manuscripts\r\nsent back in the morning's mail. Occasionally bad news of other kinds\r\ncomes in this way, and, as a rule, it is the very worst time for its\r\nreception. The human system--it cannot be too often repeated--is at\r\nits lowest physiological term in the morning, the temperature is lower\r\nthan during the rest of the day, all the nervous vitality is below the\r\nnormal. Half an hour after breakfast the reception of bad news, or the\r\ncoming of important matters requiring decision, would not make so much\r\ndifference. Hence, the necessity for knowing whether the mail is\r\nordinarily read in the early morning, in order to know something about\r\npeople, and about the consumption and digestion of their breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany at Breakfast.--Pleasant company during meals is an important\r\nfactor that makes for good digestion. At the other meals there is much\r\nmore likelihood of having such pleasant company, while the morning\r\nmeal is often a solitary, and quite as often as not, a rather glum\r\nquarter of an hour, preoccupied with the business cares of the day. As\r\nmay be readily understood from our discussion of this problem of\r\nmental preoccupation during digestion, this may seriously hamper\r\ndigestive processes. Often men take refuge in their paper. The\r\nthoughts aroused by reading the modern newspaper are not the\r\npleasantest in the world and consist, very often, of the following out\r\nof details of hideous crimes and scandals. When, as is sometimes the\r\ncase, these scandals concern relatives, friends or acquaintances in\r\nwhom we are interested, and with regard to whom we feel poignantly\r\nbecause of the publicity involved, nearly the same effect is produced\r\nas when bad news is received in letters, or when business worries are\r\nthus brought to the breakfast table.\r\n\r\nThe best conditions for the eating of breakfast are those in which it\r\nbecomes like the other meals, a family matter. When father, mother and\r\nchildren eat their breakfast together, nearly always family interests\r\nand especially the enlivening effect of the joyousness with which\r\nchildren face a new day is the best possible tonic for a business man\r\nin whom a solitary breakfast starts a day of digestive disturbance.\r\nSociability and sufficient time must be insisted on, whether at home\r\nor in a boarding house, at breakfast as well as the other meals, and\r\nit will often be surprising to find how much difference this makes\r\nboth as regards the quantity eaten and the digestion of the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorbid Habits.--In matters of diet, it is important to ask for\r\ndetails, for it is surprising what unexpected things may be discovered\r\nafter weeks of treatment. That was illustrated for me once by a case\r\nof persistent acne in a young girl, which all the ordinary remedies\r\nfailed to cure. I felt sure that {171} I had given her such explicit\r\ndirections with regard to diet that I knew exactly what she was taking\r\nand that nothing could be hoped for from any change. As a last resort,\r\nI asked once more with regard to all that she ate and only then\r\ndiscovered that before breakfast every day she ate a baked banana. It\r\nhad been recommended to her by a friend as a sure cure for\r\nconstipation, she had formed the habit of taking it as a medicine, and\r\nso had not spoken of it. Baked bananas agree with many people well,\r\nbut just as soon as this was eliminated from her diet her acne began\r\nto improve and before long had disappeared almost entirely. The taking\r\nof large amounts of warm water, already spoken of, is another of these\r\nmorbid habits. Then many people take a glass of salt water, or\r\nlaxative water, and some have curious habits with regard to the eating\r\nto excess of salt on cereal or on fruit, or sometimes they eat too\r\ngreat a variety of fruit. All this should be known, but often will not\r\nbe ascertained unless particularly inquired about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DAY'S WORK\r\n\r\nProbably even more important than details with regard to the early\r\nhours of the day, is detailed information as to the day's work, the\r\nkind and character of the occupation and the length of time spent at\r\nit, the interruptions that may occur, the habits with regard to\r\nluncheon, and, above all, the state of mind in which the occupation is\r\npursued. The physician will only learn these details when he sets\r\nbefore himself a definite schedule of what he wants to know, and then\r\nproceeds to secure information with regard to it. With this sufficient\r\ncan be learned in a short time to ascertain the source of the\r\naffection or the symptoms complained of. In some cases it is, however,\r\nonly when the whole day's occupation is reviewed that proper\r\nsuggestions can be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting to Work.--Many a man, especially if he has been accustomed to\r\nmuch exercise in younger years, craves muscular exercise, feels much\r\nbetter whenever he has the opportunity to take it, yet rides down to\r\nbusiness every morning and back every evening. On his vacation in the\r\nsummer time, he gets up early for the sake of a morning walk, but he\r\nscarcely has time to take his breakfast and ride to business at other\r\ntimes, though the main reason for his better feeling during his\r\nvacation is his exercise. There is usually the story of crowded cars\r\nin the busy hours, often with annoying thoughts pestering him that he\r\nmay not be in time and with a constant call on nervous energy while he\r\nstands up in the train, jolted, pushed, crowded, or unable to read his\r\npaper with satisfaction, even if he has a seat. The discomfort\r\nexperienced during a ride in crowded cars to business is about as bad\r\na way to begin a day for a nervous person as could be imagined.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it will take more than half an hour to get to business in\r\nthis way. If an extra twenty minutes were taken, it would be possible\r\nto walk the distance. On at least two out of every three days in the\r\nyear this would give a magnificent opportunity for exercise of the\r\nbest kind, for fresh air, {172} for diversion of mind, for the route\r\ncould be frequently changed, and, during the spring and fall, if there\r\nare parks on the way, these would provide occasion for pleasant\r\nthoughts to replace the annoyances which too intimate contact with\r\nover-strenuous humanity in overcrowded cars is likely to occasion.\r\n\r\nThis seems almost too trivial for a doctor to talk about, but it is on\r\nthe care of trivialities that good health often depends. It is easy to\r\nassume that this amounts to little for health but tempt a dissatisfied\r\npatient, whose digestion and sleep are disturbed, to do it, especially\r\nin the spring and in the fall, and see what a difference it makes in\r\nall his physical functions. If he is not used to walking, he will have\r\nto begin by walking only a mile or two, but after a time he will do\r\nhis four-mile walk in about an hour, with no waste of business time,\r\nand with a renewal of energy that will seem little short of marvelous.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails of the Day's Work.--If patients are to be benefited through\r\nmental influence it is extremely important that details as to\r\noccupation be completely secured. This must include, especially in\r\ncases where there are objective but obscure symptoms, minute\r\ninformation that may seem trivial, and yet which often proves to be of\r\ngreat importance. In recent years there has been profound study of the\r\ndangers of trades and occupations. Anyone who wants to treat nervous\r\npatients, must know much about these occupations, for otherwise\r\nsymptoms may be ascribed to old infections, to obscure rheumatic\r\nconditions, to intestinal auto-intoxication, or to nervous weakness or\r\nexhaustion, when they are really the result of occupation-conditions.\r\nThe various poisons must be carefully looked for, or affections will\r\nbe wrongly treated. I have had a series of cases of lead poisoning\r\n[Footnote 22] under most unexpected conditions which have taught me\r\nmuch as to the possibilities of obscure plumbism. Lead poisoning from\r\nnew lead pipes--with no one else in the household suffering from it,\r\nlead poisoning from frequent drinking of carbonated waters, the\r\nbottles of which had the old-fashioned lead stoppers, lead poisoning\r\nfrom the painting of a flat by a settlement worker who could not get a\r\npainter to do it, show how carefully such things must be looked for.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 22: \"Curiosities of Lead Poisoning,\"\r\n  _International Clinics_, Eighth Series, Vol. II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dust and Respiratory Affections_.--Mechanical conditions connected\r\nwith trades are especially important. Workers in dusty trades are\r\nalmost sure to suffer severely from bronchitis at times, and to have\r\nthe affection oftener than others, to have it \"hang on longer,\" as\r\nthey say, and eventually to have tuberculosis develop. There are some\r\nof the polishing trades in the metal industries in which it is\r\nimpossible to maintain the ordinary death benefit fund that workmen\r\nhave in other trades, because the men die so frequently and at such an\r\nearly age from consumption that the drain on the treasury makes it\r\nimpossible to maintain the fund. Practically all of the dusty\r\noccupations have this same tendency. This is true often in occupations\r\nwhere dust is sometimes not supposed to be much of a factor. Railroad\r\ntrainmen suffer more frequently from colds than do those in other\r\ntrades because of the dust to which they are exposed, and a trainman\r\nwith incipient consumption will be greatly benefited by getting out of\r\nthe dust during the summer months. Sweepers in large buildings,\r\njanitors and janitresses have colds that are often untractable because\r\nof the dust in their occupations. It is to be hoped that {173} the new\r\nvacuum cleaning system now becoming so popular will obviate these\r\ndangers, though like all improvements, it will probably bring its own\r\ndangers with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lack of Light_.--People who work at occupations that keep them from\r\nthe light are likely to suffer from lung symptoms and to have quite\r\nintractable colds which will not clear up until they get more\r\nsunlight. Workers in theaters and like places who do their sweeping\r\nwhere sunlight does not penetrate, are in more danger than others from\r\nrespiratory disease. Those who work in gloomy lower stories,\r\nespecially in narrow but busy and dusty streets, suffer the same way.\r\nAttendants at moving picture shows who work much in the dark where the\r\nfrequently changing crowd brings in dust which cannot be well removed,\r\nand in quarters where the sun does not penetrate, are almost sure to\r\nhave persistent repeated respiratory troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Habitual Movements_.--After the question of dust comes the mode of\r\nthe occupation. Many occupations demand certain habitual and repeated\r\nmovements. When people come complaining of pains in muscles in and\r\naround joints, or of achy conditions in the limbs, it is important to\r\nknow every detail of their occupation movements, if the physician is\r\nto appreciate just what pathological causes are at work. It is not\r\nenough, for instance, to know that a man is a clerk, or a bookkeeper,\r\nbut it should be asked whether he stands much at his occupation, or\r\nwalks considerably, or whether he sits practically all the day. If he\r\nstands much, we can expect that he will have various painful\r\nconditions in his feet and legs, unless he takes care to change his\r\nposition frequently, to wear the most comfortable shoes obtainable\r\nand, above all, to provide against any yielding of the arch of the\r\nfoot. Often it will be found that people who complain of discomfort in\r\nthe feet stand much on a cold, and sometimes damp and draughty floor,\r\nand this needs to be corrected or their symptoms, often carelessly\r\ncalled rheumatic, will not disappear. If he sits down always during\r\nhis occupation, he will need exercise and air or he will suffer from\r\nmany vague discomforts, over sensitiveness and irritability of nerves,\r\nas well as from physical conditions.\r\n\r\nMost patients prefer to think that they are suffering from some\r\nconstitutional condition, rather than from a merely local\r\nmanifestation due to their occupations. Those who have to stand much\r\ncan often make such arrangements as will permit their sitting down\r\nfrom time to time. They may, if they are standing at a desk, have a\r\nhigh stool; they may during their hour of lunch sit down restfully, or\r\neven to recline for a time, so as to restore the circulation in the\r\nlegs. For many people who suffer from the achy discomfort connected\r\nwith varicose veins in the leg, a rest of half an hour in the middle\r\nof the day with the feet a little higher than the head, will do more\r\nthan anything else to make them comfortable. This same thing is true\r\nfor people with flat-foot, and there are many occupations with regard\r\nto which advice of this kind will be appreciated. The well known\r\ntendency of many men to sit with their feet higher than their head is\r\nnot a mere caprice, but is due to the fact that this is an extremely\r\nrestful posture and thoroughly hygienic for those who have been\r\nstanding much.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is not so easy to secure such relief for working\r\nwomen, but occasionally the advice to lie down during the middle of\r\nthe day on the couches of the retiring rooms may be the best medical\r\nprescription that can {174} be given. This will carry young women over\r\ntrying periods of the month when everything seems to be going wrong.\r\nIn women particularly, if there are complaints of the pains in the\r\nlower limbs, footwear must be investigated. When the heels are too\r\nhigh those who have to stand much are thrown forward and there is a\r\nstrain of the muscles of the thighs and on the muscles of the back.\r\nMany young women suffer from backache supposed to be due to internal\r\nconditions usually of gynecological character, when it is only due to\r\nhigh heels or a combination of high heels and constipation. On the\r\nother hand, heels that are too low are not comfortable and women's\r\nshoes, in spite of the outcry against them, have been better adapted\r\nthan men's to prevent them from developing flat foot. Fewer women than\r\nmen suffer from this affection. Shoes that are too loose are almost as\r\nbad, sometimes it would seem worse, than those that are too tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Habitual Motions and So-Called Rheumatism_.--The habitual movements\r\nof various trades are extremely important for the diagnosis of\r\nconditions that develop in the muscular system. Much of the so-called\r\nrheumatism of the working people is really due to the muscular\r\nover-activity demanded by their trades. This affects all kinds of\r\nworking people. Men who have to work foot-lathes, or women who have to\r\nwork sewing machines, or men or women who have to use their arms much\r\nin repeated vigorous movements, are likely to suffer from achy\r\ndiscomfort. The strong and healthy ones do not suffer, but the\r\ndelicate do. The suffering is much more prevalent in rainy, damp\r\nweather; it is worse during the spring and fall than at other times.\r\nIt is particularly noticeable whenever the patient is run down\r\nphysically, is worrying about many things, or, above all, is getting\r\ninsufficient nutrition. The discomfort is particularly likely to recur\r\nin those who do not know how to use their muscles properly, who are\r\nnaturally awkward, and who perhaps have from nature an insufficient\r\ncontrol over opposing and coodinating muscles, so that they do not\r\naccomplish movements quite as readily as would be the case if they\r\nwere normal. The personal element enters largely into these\r\naffections. Many patients, however, can be trained to do their\r\nhabitual movements under the best possible mechanical conditions,\r\nwhereas very often they are found accomplishing them under the worst\r\npossible mechanical conditions.\r\n\r\nMen who have to do much writing may have to be taught the application\r\nof Gowers' rule, that the forearm should so move as a whole during\r\nwriting that if a pen were fastened to the elbow it would execute\r\nexactly all the movements of a pen held in the hand. The writing must\r\nall be done from the shoulder. People who do typewriting may have to\r\nbe instructed not to allow the machine to be too much above them, nor\r\non the other hand, too much below them when they sit down. Young\r\npeople particularly who, from long hours of practice on the piano,\r\nsuffer from neurotic conditions, may have to be instructed to do this\r\nunder good mechanical conditions.\r\n\r\nMen who do much filing of metal will often suffer from painful\r\nconditions in the arms. These will be much worse in case the filing is\r\ndone at a table or workbench so high that pressure has to be brought\r\nto bear upon the file by the arms instead of through the weight of the\r\nbody. This same thing is true for women who iron much. If the ironing\r\nboard is so high that the additional pressure applied is made by the\r\narms, then painful conditions will {175} almost inevitably develop if\r\nthe work is long continued. These details are discussed in the\r\nchapters on joint and muscular affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Work.--In a large city there are many workmen who are on night\r\nduty. They will be disturbed in many ways in health, unless they make\r\nspecial arrangements to live under conditions that enable them to have\r\nfull eight hours of sleep every day and, above all, to have their\r\nmeals regularly. When they come home in the morning they usually have\r\na rather hearty meal. Most of them can sleep very well with this, but\r\nvery few of them sleep the full eight hours, and all need this amount.\r\nUsually they have another full meal about five in the evening. Very\r\noften it will be found that the third meal of the day consists of a\r\nsandwich, with a glass of milk or a glass of beer, and some cake or\r\nsome crackers and cheese, or the inevitable pie. Every workman should\r\nhave three full meals, and a man who is suffering from almost any\r\nsymptoms will be improved at once if the third good meal is insisted\r\nupon. At one time I had occasion to see a number of men whose work\r\nbegan not later than seven in the evening and did not finish until six\r\nor seven in the morning. They were sufferers from all sorts of\r\ncomplaints. Most of them were under weight. Not a few were\r\nconstipated. Some were suffering from severe headaches that came\r\nrather frequently, and a few from a headache that was severe but came\r\nonly every two or four weeks. These patients alternated night and day\r\nwork, and it was the week after they had been on day work, and first\r\nwent on to night work, that they suffered from headache.\r\n\r\nIn every one of these cases instructions with regard to eating and\r\nsleeping proved to be the best remedy. Nearly all of them were not\r\neating enough, and were skimping the third meal. Three of them were\r\ntaking only between four and five hours of sleep. They stayed up after\r\nbreakfast to read the paper, went to bed about nine and got up about\r\ntwo o'clock. Just as soon as two or three hours was added to their\r\nsleep, they began to feel better, and various symptoms, digestive,\r\nrheumatic and nervous, of which they complained, began to disappear.\r\n\r\nNearly always night workers are more prone than the ordinary run of\r\nworkmen to some indulgence in spirituous liquors. Cold and shivery on\r\nthe way home from work in the early morning, they take a nip of\r\nwhiskey to brace them up. Alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver is a little\r\nmore common among sea captains, policemen, printers and night workmen\r\non the railroads than among the average of the population. The reason\r\nfor it seems to be that undilute whiskey is thrown into the\r\ncirculation by being taken into the stomach at a time when that viscus\r\nis empty and all the cells are craving food and drink. It is carried\r\ndirectly to the liver, and there either produces or predisposes to the\r\nbad effects upon liver cells which we know as cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nIt is usually useless to treat such men for the indigestion and other\r\nsymptoms that are likely to develop as a consequence of their habits,\r\nwithout getting at their story completely. It is easy, as a rule, to\r\nrelieve them of certain of their symptoms by ordinary drug\r\ntherapeutics. Unless their habits are changed, this relief, however,\r\nis only temporary. It must not be forgotten that in recent years women\r\nhave come to do a good deal of work at night that was not usual to\r\nthem before. In the telephone service of certain cities, as cashiers\r\nin restaurants, as ticket sellers in various places of entertainment,\r\n{176} as office help at busy seasons of the year, women may be kept\r\noccupied either all night or at least until quite late. Not\r\ninfrequently during times when rehearsals are on, chorus girls are\r\nkept until the wee small hours. They are particularly likely to suffer\r\nfrom such variations in normal habits, and no treatment is so\r\neffective with them as pointing out how they must live, if they want\r\nto preserve their appearance and continue in such exacting\r\noccupations. A healthy young woman can burn the candle of life at both\r\nends with less protest from nature at the beginning than man, but she\r\nsuffers more for it and the suffering begins sooner.\r\n\r\n\r\nPositions During Occupations.--The question of position during\r\noccupation, especially as regards its influence upon digestive\r\nprocesses, has always seemed to me much more important than most\r\npeople think. Our idea of digestion has been so largely one of\r\ndigestive secretions, to the neglect of the motor side of the gastric\r\nand intestinal functions, that we have missed some important points.\r\nIf a person leans over a desk shortly after a meal, there is no doubt\r\nthat the crowding of the abdominal viscera hinders peristalsis, at\r\nleast to some degree, not of course in the robust and healthy, but in\r\nthose who already have some irregularity or sluggishness in this\r\nregion. The old high desks at which many clerks used to stand, at\r\nwhich even proprietors did not hesitate to take their position, had a\r\nreason in common sense that has been forgotten in the modern times,\r\nand the variation of position thus permitted seems to have been good\r\nfor the workers.\r\n\r\nA good deal of comfort may be obtained by having a suitable desk and\r\nchair for business hours. Not infrequently it happens that a desk is\r\ntoo high for comfortable writing. Any discomfort that is continuous\r\nand makes itself felt intrusively during occupation with other things,\r\nwill have an unfortunate effect. Such things seem trivial by contrast\r\nwith serious disease and may seem safely negligible. Trivial they are,\r\nbut little things count both in themselves and as to the attitude of\r\nmind which they occasion. It is the attitude of mind that we try to\r\nmodify by psychotherapy, and even the removal of little sources of\r\nannoyance help a patient materially to get through life more happily\r\nand through work more efficiently and without any more discomfort than\r\nis absolutely unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Positions After Meals_.--While we have talked thus of business\r\npeople, what is said refers, also, to the positions assumed out of\r\nbusiness hours, as, for instance, at home after dinner. A Morris chair\r\nthat permits of a somewhat reclining position, or a rocking chair that\r\ntemps one to sit back, pretty well distending the abdomen and giving\r\nall due play to the internal viscera, will be found not only much more\r\ncomfortable than a straight-back chair which tempts a man to lean\r\nforward, but also there will be less interference with gastric\r\nmotility, the most important digestive function of the stomach.\r\nArm-chairs which really support the arms, and therefore tend to keep\r\nthe shoulders up, have something of the same effect. We naturally\r\nassume these positions, though occasionally social usage forbids them.\r\nThe tendency, for instance, for elbows to be put on the table,\r\nespecially toward the end of a meal, represents a natural instinct to\r\nlift up the shoulders and keep the weight of the upper part of the\r\ntrunk off the abdominal organs. Children's instincts often curiously\r\nguide their postures--as is illustrated by the story of the little boy\r\nwho, when asked by his grandmother if he could manage {177} another\r\ntart, said that he thought he could if he stood up. (See chapter on\r\nPosition.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Conditions of Occupations.--While the details of manual\r\noccupations have to be learned with great care if we are to modify the\r\nconditions so as to prevent certain unfortunate effects, just as much\r\ncare has to be exercised, with those not employed manually, in finding\r\nout details as to mental worries, and the various disturbances\r\nconsequent upon business conditions. Many a man has not brain enough\r\nto run his business and his liver. This is the old English expression,\r\nand the liver, as the largest of the abdominal organs, is taken for\r\nthe physical life generally. Many people have not vital energy enough\r\nto waste any of it on worries and then be able to complete their\r\ndigestion and other physiological functions with success. The\r\npreceding mental condition is a predisposing cause of many a purely\r\nphysical ailment. It used to be said that during a cabinet crisis in\r\nEngland, or rather just after it was over, attacks of gout were most\r\nfrequent among prominent politicians. Mental influence usually kept\r\nthe attacks off until the very end of the crisis. Merchants come down\r\nwith pneumonia or digestive disturbances more frequently during\r\nperiods of acute business depression. Physicians are attacked by\r\npneumonia, or influenza in bad form, after they have been wearing\r\nthemselves out in an epidemic and worrying about patients. Just after\r\na mother has nursed a child through a severe ailment she herself is\r\nprone to suffer from some acute infection. Such common-place\r\ninfections as boils, styes, abscesses and even the more serious\r\nosteomyelitis are likely to come at these times.\r\n\r\nIt is important, then, to know as much as possible about a business\r\nman's affairs. Any one who has had a series of tuberculous patients\r\n(who were getting along quite well in spite of latent or even active\r\nlesions) disturbed by anxieties of one kind or another, knows how much\r\nworries may mean. Men will lose weight and appetite and weaken in\r\ntheir general condition as a consequence of some serious business\r\nincident, while all the time physical conditions are the same as they\r\nwere when they were improving. And it must not be forgotten that even\r\nin those who do no physical labor, there may be physical conditions of\r\ntheir occupation that are important. Many a business man does his work\r\ncooped up in a small office, with insufficient ventilation, and\r\nsometimes, especially where his business is on the ground floor of a\r\nlarge building, with so little sunlight that his environment is quite\r\nunhygienic. The great air purifier is sunlight. Unless sunlight is\r\nadmitted for hours every day to the rooms in which people live, the\r\ndust that is inevitably breathed will contain living germs, active and\r\nnoxious, though had they been exposed to sunlight these germs would be\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nEspecially then for people with respiratory defects of any kind,\r\nwhether these be tuberculous or of chronic bronchitic character, the\r\nconditions surrounding the occupation should be carefully inquired\r\ninto. Once the family physician knew such things as a matter of\r\ncourse. Now he is likely to know very little. The lack of such\r\ninformation may not be important for the more serious conditions that\r\nhe has to treat at patients' homes, but they usually mean much for the\r\nsubmorbid conditions, so to say, the discomforts and chronic\r\nconditions, which come for office treatment. They mean much for\r\ncomfort in life, and for the conservation of health and strength. They\r\n{178} represent that newer medicine which people are asking of us now\r\nso much more than before, which shall keep them in good health and\r\nprevent them, as much as possible, from suffering even from minor\r\nills.\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness Habits.--The modern idea of having a flat-top business desk,\r\ninstead of a roll-top desk, and having it thoroughly cleared off every\r\nevening, so that each day's work does not accumulate, is an important\r\npsychic factor in the strenuous life, which in recent years many\r\ncorporations have been taking advantage of. It is well for those who\r\nare their own masters to realize the value of this principle. Nothing\r\nso disturbs the efficiency of work, nor adds so much to the incubus\r\nthat work may become, as having a number of unfinished things which\r\nkeep intruding themselves. It is not always possible to dispose of\r\nproblems, but discipline is necessary to keep us from pushing business\r\nmatters aside. Then they have to be done in a rush, very often at a\r\nmoment when other things are also pressing. The result is poor work,\r\nbut, above all, a waste of nerve force and energy that leads up to\r\nnervous symptoms and eventually nervous exhaustion. The orderly man,\r\nwho has learned to settle things as they come up, or at definite\r\ntimes, can accomplish an immense amount of work. Some men are born\r\norderly, but any one who wants to do much work must have order grafted\r\non his makeup--a habit which can be made a second nature. It may seem\r\nthat a physician is unwarranted in intruding on a man's business\r\naffairs thus to inquire about the ways he does things, but this is the\r\ndifference between psychotherapy and the regulation of life as\r\ncompared with cures by more material but less effective means.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Hygiene.--Expert Advice.--For many men who are much occupied\r\nwith business, the best possible safeguard for health, as well as the\r\nbest guarantee against nervous or physical breakdown, would be a\r\ndetailed consultation once a year with a physician regarding their\r\nhabits of life and their business in relation to their health, present\r\nand future. In recent years many a business firm has found it not only\r\nexpedient but profitable to turn to an expert accountant or auditing\r\ncompany and ask advice with regard to the management of its business.\r\nIt is often found that certain business customs are causing serious\r\ndrains, and that there are newer ways of doing things that save time\r\nand money. Sometimes a reorganization of the accounting system, or of\r\nthe method of dealing with credits and debits, or the receiving or\r\nshipping department, proves advantageous to the business. Sometimes it\r\nis found that the capital invested will not justify the extension of\r\nbusiness that is proposed, and not infrequently it is shown that a\r\nproposed extension adds to business movement but does not add to\r\nprofits. Sometimes there are departments that can be dropped to\r\nadvantage, though they seem to be adding to both business and profit.\r\n\r\nAll of this may well be transferred to the question of health in its\r\nrelation to business. Not infrequently it is found that the capital of\r\nstrength of the business man is not sufficient to justify the\r\nextension that he is planning or has already attempted. Sometimes\r\nsuggestions can be made with regard to the mode of doing business, the\r\nhours employed and the hours of relaxation, that will make business\r\nless of a drain on the system. Occasionally arrangements for sleep and\r\nexercise, as well as for afternoons or special times of diversion, may\r\nsave a man from that concentration of attention on one thing {179}\r\nwhich frequently leads to nervous breakdown. Not infrequently business\r\nmen who are of neurotic habit have customs of doing business which add\r\nto their nervous irritability, and these might be modified so as to\r\nlessen the call on nervous energy. There is need that the physician be\r\nlooked to as an expert in personal health and its relation to\r\nbusiness, just as the expert accountant or auditing firm is looked to\r\nfor advice with regard to business methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE OP THE DAY\r\n\r\nInformation regarding the mid-day meal will be of value to the\r\nphysician in many cases. In cities, luncheon, likely to be rather an\r\napology for a meal, is taken rapidly, and immediately there is a\r\nreturn to work. As a medical student in Vienna, I was much interested\r\nin the mid-day meal of the bankers and merchants of the old Austrian\r\ncapital. At that time--I hope they have not changed the good custom\r\nsince--the banks closed at 12 o'clock and did not open again until 3\r\no'clock. This gave time for taking the mid-day meal in comfort, and\r\nfor a proper interval for digestion. In all the southern countries of\r\nEurope, for seven or eight months in the year at least, little is done\r\nduring the two or three hours in the middle of the day. The people get\r\nup earlier and rest at mid-day as a break between the afternoon and\r\nmorning. It is quite beyond expectation that anything like this will\r\never again be possible in the great commercial cities. The fact that\r\nthis was the custom of our European forefathers, however, shows how\r\nbusiness has obtruded itself on the habits that man would naturally\r\nform for himself. Business men hurry to luncheon, or if they take any\r\ntime over it, it is because they have invited some one to lunch with\r\nthem with whom they wish to talk over important matters. This means of\r\nsaving time recalls the well-known expression of James Jeffrey Roche:\r\n\"Time is money. Every second saved from your dinner now is a sequin in\r\nyour doctor's pocket later on in life!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHurried Lunch.--The seeds of our frequent American dyspepsia are sown\r\npartly at the hurried breakfast and then at the hurried mid-day lunch.\r\nWhen a physician finds this to be the case, then the patient's habits\r\nmust be reformed. Otherwise there is little prospect of relief from\r\nneurotic digestive symptoms, or from those uncomfortable feelings so\r\noften supposed to refer to the heart, or other important organ, when\r\ndigestion is interfered with. There should be pleasant company at\r\nluncheon if possible; it should be preceded by fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes in the open air, with, as far as possible, complete seclusion\r\nfrom business thoughts so as to allow the stomach to secure its share\r\nof blood, and it should be followed by at least half an hour of\r\npleasant occupation that does not call for serious mental work. This\r\nmay not be possible for every one, and many will complain that this is\r\nasking too much in our busy time. We physicians are not here to make\r\nthe nice customs of medicine courtesy to great kings of finance or to\r\nthe busy tyrants of the professions, but to tell them what we think\r\nshould be {180} done in order that nature may not be abused. Men\r\nshould be advised to take their luncheon in some building different\r\nfrom that in which their offices are located, or, if they eat in the\r\nsame building, to go out on the street for a while before the meal. In\r\nthe old days men used to call on one another in order to transact\r\nbusiness, and these little trips were often made just before or after\r\nluncheons.\r\n\r\nNow the telephone and the messenger boy have done away with this, with\r\na great saving of time, but with an increase of intensity of labor\r\nthat makes for nervous exhaustion. Luncheon clubs are excellent things\r\nwhen men do not talk shop, but they have one fatal defect. Almost\r\ninvariably they lack simplicity of menu, and, because of the variety\r\nsupplied and the example of others, there is a tendency to eat to\r\nexcess. A game of billiards after eating is often excellent, because,\r\nwhen standing, digestion is accomplished with more comfort than when\r\nseated. A walk after the lighter midday meal is a good thing, though\r\nthe old saw said \"after dinner sit a while,\" but that was in reference\r\nto the largest meal of the day, and may still hold good for the\r\nevening meal, which is likely to be the heaviest one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen's Lunch.--Women are very likely to take their mid-day meal, when\r\nit is their luncheon, very irregularly. If they have to get it for\r\nthemselves they are likely to be satisfied with almost anything. If\r\nthey get it outside the house they are likely to take it rather late,\r\nso that if they have breakfast before eight o'clock, this putting off\r\nof the next meal causes some disturbance of the economy. When the\r\nstomach gets to be empty, either there is a tendency to swallow air,\r\nor there is a rumbling sense of fullness that disturbs the appetite,\r\nor the appetite itself is capricious, and a headache develops. How\r\nmany headaches are due to missed meals it would be hard to say, but\r\nthis is one of the most fruitful causes of the ordinary passing\r\nheadache. Delicate women, and especially those who work, are likely\r\nnot to eat enough luncheon. All the details with regard to this meal\r\nmust be known or the physician will find it hard to get rid of many\r\nneurotic symptoms, particularly in working women. The same thing is\r\ntrue for the so-called society woman, since she is likely to have a\r\nlate breakfast and then skip her mid-day meal. This is permissible if\r\nshe is so stout as to be able to spare it, but it is all wrong if she\r\nis thin and needs every ounce of weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of the Noon Meal.--During the last two generations fashion,\r\ncustom and the increasing demands of business have pushed the hour of\r\ntaking the principal meal farther and farther away from mid-day. There\r\nare, however, cases in which it seems better that the principal meal\r\nshould be taken in accordance with the old custom, about noon time.\r\nFor tuberculous patients this is especially important. They often have\r\nfever in the afternoon that seriously disturbs appetite. They may eat\r\nwith comfort and relish a couple of hours before the fever is due. For\r\ndelicate persons, especially those who have not much appetite for\r\nbreakfast and who can not be persuaded to eat a sufficient amount\r\nearly in the morning, a hearty meal at noon is almost a necessity.\r\nThey should be shown how low their nutrition is during working hours.\r\nTheir principal meal of the day before was taken between six and seven\r\no'clock. They have had a light breakfast, a meager lunch, and\r\nnaturally have little reserve force during the afternoon hours. As a\r\nconsequence they become overtired, this lessens the appetite, they do\r\nnot eat properly, and, {181} above all, they do not digest as well as\r\nthey would if their last good meal were not so far away. They are\r\nsuffering from inanition, and, as is well known, starving people\r\ncannot be allowed to eat heartily, because their stomachs have not\r\nenough vitality to digest well.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to change the hour of taking the principal meal,\r\nbut in special cases this can be done with decided advantage. I have\r\nseen such a change make all the difference between slow recuperation\r\nfrom bad colds, and have seen it of the greatest possible importance\r\nin tuberculosis. The very changing of the hour will sometimes\r\nsuggestively react to make the patient eat more heartily than usual,\r\nthe day is broken up better, the reaction against the morning\r\ndiscouragement comes earlier, and the patient's general condition\r\nimproves. Many people rest better at night if their principal meal is\r\ntaken at the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LEISURE HOURS.\r\n\r\nThen comes the return from business. Here once more the ordinary\r\nmethod of getting on a crowded train, standing up to be pushed and\r\njammed, to have all sorts of unpleasant things happen, to have the\r\npessimism of one's nature stirred to its depths by the utter disregard\r\nfor women, the heedless rush of men, the roughness of railroad\r\nemployees, and the general lack of humanity that characterizes the\r\nevening rush from business in a large city, is eminently unsuitable as\r\na preparation for dinner; while a calm walk of three to five miles is\r\nideal. To walk home will probably take twenty minutes or half an hour\r\nlonger, but not more than this--and it avoids the undesirable features\r\nof the usual method.\r\n\r\n\r\nGymnastics.--Occasionally one finds that men rush through the last\r\nhour of business in order to spend an hour in a gymnasium. Often this\r\nis quite undesirable. Exercise within doors, taken in a routine manner\r\nand merely for the sake of exercise, with no diversion of mind, is\r\neminently unsuitable for the busy man. What he needs is air much more\r\nthan exercise. Walking out of doors is the very best thing for him. If\r\nhe walks at a rapid pace, swinging his arms a little freely and\r\ncarrying a cane in one hand and perhaps a book in the other, because\r\nthis exercises his fingers and keeps him from having any unpleasant\r\ncongestion of the hands when they hang down, then the exercise is\r\nalmost ideal. Owing to the novelty of it, and the interest that a new\r\noccupation arouses, great benefit will at first be derived from the\r\ngymnasium. Very often, too, the cold plunge after the exercise does\r\nmore good than the exercise itself. The plunge is real fun, especially\r\nwhen taken with many others, but the exercise itself is likely to\r\ndegenerate into the sorriest kind of a task. If the man who walks home\r\nwill take a bath before dinner, the temperature of the water being\r\nmade suitable to him and the reaction that comes to his particular\r\nnature, there is no need of anything else, and there is nothing better\r\nthat he could do. The walk must be varied. The course must not always\r\nbe through the same streets. Occasionally it {182} should even lead\r\none to see some monument or new building, or to go out of the way with\r\na friend, so that variety is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork at Home.--There are men who in busy times take some of their work\r\nhome with them. This is a mistake. And though it is the custom to tell\r\nthe doctor that they cannot do otherwise, it is practically always a\r\nbit of self-deception. When the case is properly put before them, they\r\nrealize, if they already have any neurotic symptoms, that to continue\r\nhome work will be a serious risk. Most men who carry business home\r\nwith them, easily get into the habit of pushing certain details away\r\nfrom them during the day with the idea that they will have more time\r\nfor that in the evening. They do a certain amount of dawdling over\r\ntheir work. If they really resolved to finish work during business\r\nhours they could do it, and do it better than during the evening at\r\nhome. Six hours of work is about all that a man ought to do with his\r\nintellect at high pressure. This should be pretty well divided into\r\ntwo periods of three hours each, with an interval of an hour to an\r\nhour and a half between. The nearer a man can come to this arrangement\r\nthe better for him, and the better, also, for his affairs. If he has\r\nassumed obligations that require more of his time and attention than\r\nthis, he is trying to do too much.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter-Dinner Hours.--The evening hours and their proper occupation are\r\nimportant for the business man, or for anyone who is much occupied\r\nduring the day. The temptation to let the work of the day run over\r\ninto the evening must be overcome at all costs, or it will prove\r\nserious for the health of most men. It is important as far as possible\r\nto get something completely different for men to do at night. Many men\r\nsettle down to the reading of a newspaper or of a magazine or novel.\r\nWhile this does very well under some circumstances, reading does not\r\nprovide diversion whenever there is serious worry or solicitude over\r\nbusiness matters. A man may think that he is occupying himself with\r\nthe newspaper, but we all know very well that business cares intrude,\r\nthat business troubles are often doubled by reading about others. The\r\nreading of novels does well for a while, but the serious-minded man\r\ntires of them and then, while they may occupy a couple of hours, they\r\nhave exactly the same objection as the newspaper. A genuine diversion\r\nshould give the physical basis of mind an opportunity literally to\r\nremake itself by storing up new energies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amusements_.--The fact of the matter is that a man must have, if\r\npossible, some other serious interest in life besides his business. He\r\nmust have a hobby. We have discussed this in the chapter on Diversion\r\nof Mind and refer to it here only to indicate the importance of\r\nknowing something about a man's recreation as well as his work. It is\r\nnot a casual occupation but a real interest that he should have. This\r\nneed not necessarily be a useful employment and, indeed, it may be\r\nabsolutely useless provided it is absorbing. Card playing is an\r\nexcellent diversion for many people. When joined with gambling, new\r\nworries and feverish excitement usually make it harmful for neurotic\r\npersons. Chess is hard work, but of a different kind from that of the\r\nday and, therefore, often makes an excellent recreation. Any games are\r\ngood. Bowling, for instance, is excellent, and billiards, if a man has\r\nan interest in it, is a fine sport for evening hours. It has the added\r\nadvantage of physical exercise. A man does not sit down during\r\nbilliards, crowding his {183} already well-distended abdominal\r\nviscera, but walks around and gives his viscera a better chance for\r\ntheir work and aids rather than retards peristalsis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Encroachment on Sleep_.--There is just one defect about some of the\r\nmore absorbing recreations--they keep a man up too late. Whenever a\r\nso-called recreation takes up such time that a man has less than eight\r\nfull hours in bed, then a mistake, almost sure to be serious sooner or\r\nlater, is being made. When the physician tries to limit a man's\r\nrecreation by suggesting an earlier hour for retirement, he may be\r\ntold that his patient must have some time for diversion and\r\nrecreation. But the physician must insist that no form of recreation\r\nis as good as sleep, and any other form must be limited in order that\r\nsleep may be obtained. A man may easily regulate his affairs so that\r\nhe shall have eight hours of sleep, and it is only negligence of such\r\nregulation that gives him the idea that recreation cannot be obtained\r\nexcept after eleven o'clock at night. Little suppers after the theater\r\nare often fine diversions, but whenever they interfere with sleep they\r\nmust not be allowed except at long intervals. Other diversions that\r\nkeep a man out of bed after midnight are sure not to do good in the\r\nlong run, though an occasional lapse in this matter may prove a\r\nstimulant rather than a depressant. It is custom that must be\r\nregulated; an occasional variant from it is rather good than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeisure of the Working Woman.--A woman's occupation, unlike a man's,\r\nholds out little future for her. Her occupation does not arouse her\r\nambition. Daily work is a monotonous grind that must be endured for\r\nthe sake of the wages that it brings. For a time this serves to occupy\r\nattention. After some years, when the prospects of matrimony grow\r\nless, and further advance is out of the question, women often need to\r\nhave some special interest that will grip them. The working woman may\r\nthen need to be tempted to some occupation of mind, especially with\r\nthe companionship of others, that will give her renewed interests in\r\nlife. Clubs, charities in which they are active, friends, serious\r\nintellectual interests, must all be appealed to, in different cases,\r\nin order to secure diversion. Women must have something to look\r\nforward to each week. They must know on Monday that before the\r\nfollowing Sunday there is going to be a theater party, a lecture, a\r\nvisit to friends, something to break the deadliness of weekly routine,\r\nwhich is anticipated with pleasure and then pleasantly remembered.\r\nThis may seem to be only a slight matter, but it is of importance in\r\nmany cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeminine Occupations.--The occupations of women who stay at home are\r\neven more important than those of women who go out to work. In our\r\ntime the root of much nervousness, as it is called, neurotic symptoms\r\nof various kinds and of many symptoms apparently quite distant from\r\nreal nervousness, is really a lack of occupation. Many women who live\r\nin apartment hotels have almost nothing with which to occupy their\r\nminds. They are not obliged to get up in the morning if they do not\r\nwant to, or, at least, any excuse, however slight, serves to keep them\r\nin bed. Very often there are either no children or the mother has\r\nnothing to do with her children early in the morning. After the age of\r\nthree, they go off to kindergarten; later on they go to school.\r\nBreakfast is sent up, there may be a nap of an hour or two after the\r\nmeal, and often a magazine is glanced over lying in bed, and perhaps\r\nit will be twelve o'clock before madame gets up. Anyone in a position\r\nto do this, and who allows the habit to grow, is sure to be profoundly\r\n{184} miserable. Without any real occupation of mind, the mind\r\noccupies itself with the body and emphasizes every sensation, evokes\r\nnew pains and aches, and the consequence is likely to be a highly\r\nneurotic state.\r\n\r\nSuch women have nothing serious to think about in the afternoon. At\r\nbest it is a luncheon engagement with a friend, or attendance at the\r\nmatinee, or a lecture, or a meeting of a club. For a while, and for a\r\ncertain few, these things are satisfying, but after they have been\r\nindulged in for a time, they pall so completely on most people as to\r\nleave them almost helplessly at the mercy of their feelings. These\r\npersons may have some favorite charities that occupy part of their\r\ntime. They may have other interests, but most of these interests are\r\nquite amateurish. They create no obligations; they arouse no sense of\r\nduty; they are abandoned at a moment for anything else that turns up,\r\nand consequently they lack that absorbing power that a real interest\r\ngives. It is quite impossible that these people should be either happy\r\nor healthy. These ladies of leisure sometimes have fads for physical\r\nexercise that keep them from becoming absolutely sluggish, but except\r\nin a few cases, these fads pall after a time, and in a few years women\r\nof the leisure classes are generally without any interest that will\r\nsave them from themselves. The root of many a case of nervousness that\r\nwanders from physician to physician and then from quack to quack, and\r\nfrom charlatan of one kind to charlatan of another kind, that takes up\r\nnow this remedy and now that, and advertises each new method of\r\nhealing--mental, hypnotic, mechanical--is due to nothing more serious\r\nthan lack of proper occupation of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ambition to Have Nothing to Do.--It seems to be the ambition of\r\neveryone to reach a place in life so that he can give up work and do\r\nnothing. Men and women often envy those whose material situation is\r\nsuch that they are not compelled to work. It is from the leisure\r\nclasses, however, that our neurotic invalids are mainly recruited. The\r\nsymptoms these people give will sometimes make one wonder whether they\r\nmay not be suffering from some serious ailment, but just as soon as\r\nthe details of their daily occupation are gone into, the real cause\r\nfor their complaints can be readily seen. Nothing will do them any\r\nlasting good until they get interested enough in life to be distracted\r\nfrom themselves. Such men and women are invalids by profession. They\r\nare profoundly to be pitied, for they are much more the victims of\r\npresent-day social conditions than of any special fault of their own.\r\nThey go from one health resort to another seeking relief and now and\r\nagain finding it, not because of any special effect of the remedies\r\nthat they take, but just in proportion to the amount of diversion and\r\noccupation of mind they are able to secure in their wanderings. After\r\na time they relapse, then, the old cures having lost novelty, the\r\nphysician who succeeds in occupying their minds does them good; his\r\nbrother physician, who does not, fails; but anyone else, however\r\nabsurd his quackery, who can in any way catch their attention, will\r\nbenefit them at least for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness Anxieties.--The physician should know all that concerns such\r\nsources of excitement, worry and anxiety, as are suggested by the\r\nwords speculation, investment, going on bonds and securities,\r\nespecially when the person bonded gets into trouble. Fortunately most\r\nof these latter sources of worry have been eliminated by the bonding\r\ncompanies of recent years. Details {185} of this kind were given to\r\nthe old family physician as a matter of course. With the going out of\r\nthe family physician there has often been no one to replace him in\r\nhearing such stories, and it has been harder for some to bear the\r\nconsequences in solitude. The very telling of many cares lessens the\r\nburden of them. The warnings of a medical friend may be more effective\r\nin keeping a man from serious loss than those of financial friends.\r\nEveryone realizes that the physician's advice is quite unselfish and\r\nthat what he objects to, even more than the danger and loss of money,\r\nis worry and anxiety which may lead to loss of health.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary therapeutic purposes, the physician may be content to\r\nknow only the physical signs and symptoms of his patient's affection.\r\nFor psychotherapeutics, he must, if he would be successful, know every\r\npossible source of worry and annoyance and, as nearly as may be\r\nascertained, every slight phase of physical fatigue that may be a\r\ndisturbing factor in his patient's life. It is surprising how many\r\nthings the physician will find to correct when he carefully goes over\r\nall the actions of the day and ascertains all the possible sources of\r\nworry and anxiety his patient may have. It may happen that in many\r\ncases he will be unable immediately to remove these sources of worry.\r\nBut there is relief in telling them, and then, even when they cannot\r\nbe completely eradicated, they can often be modified. Every\r\nimprovement of this kind, however slight, is a fountain of favorable\r\nsuggestion which makes the patient look on the brighter side of life.\r\nFrom every amelioration, however trivial, there is a reaction on the\r\nfeelings that gives more and more confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n{186}\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\n_GENERAL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn formal, deliberate psychotherapeutics the first and most important\r\nprinciple is the treatment of the individual patient, and not of his\r\ndisease. It is much more important to know the kind of an individual\r\nwho has pneumonia, as a rule, than to be able to tell the amount of\r\npulmonary involvement. If heart, kidneys or lungs are affected when\r\nthe disease declares itself, the outlook is extremely unfavorable.\r\nSimilar conditions are true of the patient's mind. If he is of the\r\nworrying kind, the outlook is serious. If, on the contrary, he faces\r\nit bravely, and without after-thought except that of responding to\r\nmedical treatment, he will probably get well.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is only one example of the part the individual plays in\r\ntherapeutics. In the popular mind it is supposed that for each disease\r\nthere is a definite remedy, and that when the physician gives that\r\nremedy the patient gets well. This idea of specific remedies has come\r\nto the people from the physician, but only the quack now pretends to\r\ncure disease, the physician helps the patient to overcome the\r\naffection from which he is suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Incurable Patients.--There are many incurable diseases, but there\r\nare no patients to whom a doctor should say with truth, \"I can do\r\nnothing for you.\" We may be unable to do anything for the underlying\r\ndisease. That may be absolutely incurable. In spite of this, there are\r\npractically always symptoms for which the patient can be afforded so\r\nmuch relief that he feels better than before. This is the most\r\nimportant attitude of mind for the physician who would use\r\npsychotherapy. He can always do something. Prof. Richet said not long\r\nsince, \"Physicians can seldom cure, but they can nearly always relieve\r\nand they can always console,\" and it is the physician's duty to lift\r\nup and console the mind as well as to heal the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestions.--Patients often have many opinions and\r\nconclusions with regard to their ailments which are not confided to\r\ntheir medical attendants, and which constitute the basis of many\r\nannoying symptoms. They have mental convictions with regard to the\r\nincurableness of their ailments, the supposed progressive character of\r\nthe disease, and the development of symptoms which will still further\r\nannoy them, that are often more serious and harder to bear than the\r\nsymptoms from which they are actually suffering. Unless the physician\r\nhas their complete confidence, these patients may suffer much in\r\nsilence, though the revelation of their state of mind would {187}\r\noften be sufficient to afford a good measure of relief, and the\r\ncorrection of false notions would do nearly all the rest.\r\nPsychotherapy confers its benefits mainly by securing the most\r\ncomplete _rapport_ between the mind of patient and physician. Good\r\nadvice is often more important than any medicine. The correction of\r\nwrong notions will do more to relieve the patient, and make whatever\r\nsymptoms he has bearable, than most of the anodyne drugs. The\r\nstimulation of hope means more than almost anything else in arousing\r\nthe latent forces of nature and predisposing to recovery. The removal\r\nof unfavorable suggestions is but little less efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Study of the Individual_.--The great differences in the relations\r\nbetween physicians and their patients is well recognized. To some\r\nphysicians a patient will present only conventional symptoms, while a\r\nfollow practitioner will discover the elements of an interesting case.\r\nAbove all, the painstaking physician, interested in psychology, will\r\nfind mental and other personal manifestations in his patient that\r\ndistinctly modify the course of the disease. We must know all that is\r\npossible about the patient's attitude of mind toward his malady, and\r\nall the ideas that he has acquired with regard to it, either from\r\nprevious relations with physicians or from what he may have read or\r\nheard from others. The removal of many false notions that are thus\r\nworking harm will reward the medical practitioner who gets at his\r\npatient's ideas. The old rule in therapeutics is _non nocere_--to be\r\nsure to do no harm. The special rule in psychotherapy is to be sure to\r\nremove all the ideas that are doing harm to the patient and making his\r\nsymptoms mean more to him than they really signify.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neutralizing Contrary Suggestion_.--In the application of\r\npsychotherapy, then, the first principle is the neutralization of\r\nunfavorable mental influence. In our day men have such a smattering of\r\nknowledge about disease, especially about the worst forms of it, that\r\nthey are likely to be in a frame of mind with regard to many\r\naffections that is quite unfavorable. Many patients think disease and\r\nnot health. Disease means discomfort, and consequent loss of vital\r\nenergy and disturbance of the resistive vitality that would enable the\r\npatient to throw off the affection. Sometimes the physician does not\r\nrealize what a large part unfavorable suggestions are playing in the\r\naffection. Sometimes patients conceal their state of mind lest the\r\ndoctor should confirm their worst fears. The preliminary to all\r\nsuccessful treatment is to remove unfavorable suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Suggestion.--The next thing is to set certain favorable\r\nsuggestions at work. It is possible always to do this. Even in certain\r\nof the acute diseases favorable suggestion has its place, and for all\r\nchronic cases this form of therapeutics is extremely important. The\r\nvery presence of the physician, especially if he is thoroughly in\r\ncontrol of himself, placid, imperturbed, evidently ready to use all\r\nhis powers without any excitement, is of itself the strongest kind of\r\nfavorable suggestion. From the very beginning of medical history the\r\npresence of the physician has in most cases meant even more than his\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nMuensterberg, in his recent book on Psychotherapy, has emphasized this\r\nin a way that deserves to be recalled:\r\n\r\n  There is one more feature of general treatment which seems almost a\r\n  matter of course, and yet which is perhaps the most difficult to\r\n  apply because it cannot {188} simply be prescribed: the sympathy of\r\n  the psychotherapist. The feelings with which an operation is\r\n  performed or drugs given do not determine success, but when we build\r\n  up a mental life, the feelings are a decisive factor. To be sure, we\r\n  must not forget that we have to deal here with a causal and not with\r\n  a purposive point of view. Our sympathy is therefore not in question\r\n  in its moral value, but only as a cause of a desired effect. It is\r\n  therefore not really our sympathy which counts but the appearance of\r\n  sympathy, the impression which secures the belief of the patient\r\n  that sympathy for him exists. The physician who, although full of\r\n  real sympathy, does not understand how to express it and make it\r\n  felt will thus be less successful than his colleague who may at\r\n  heart remain entirely indifferent but has a skillful routine of\r\n  going through the symptoms of sympathy. The sympathetic vibration of\r\n  the voice and skillful words and suggestive movements may be all\r\n  that is needed, but without some power of awakening this feeling of\r\n  personal relation, almost of intimacy, the wisest psychotherapeutic\r\n  treatment may remain ineffective. That reaches its extreme in those\r\n  frequent cases in which social conditions have brought about an\r\n  emotional isolation of the patient and have filled him with an\r\n  instinctive longing to break his mental loneliness, or in the still\r\n  more frequent cases where the patient's psychical sufferings are\r\n  misunderstood or ridiculed as mere fancies, or misjudged as merely\r\n  imaginary evils. Again everything depends upon the experience and\r\n  tact of the physician. His sympathy may easily overdo the intention\r\n  and further reinforce the patient's feeling of misery, or make him\r\n  an hypochondriac. It ought to be sympathy with authority and\r\n  sympathy which always at the same time shows the way to discipline.\r\n  Under special conditions, it is even advisable to group patients\r\n  with similar diseases together, and to give them strength through\r\n  the natural mutual sympathy; yet this too can be in question only\r\n  where this community becomes a starting point for common action and\r\n  common effort, not for mere common depression. In this way a certain\r\n  psychical value may be acknowledged for the social classes of\r\n  tuberculosis as they have recently been instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Environment--After the removal of unfavorable suggestion and\r\nthe implanting of favorable suggestion, the next point must be the\r\npersistent occupation of the patient's mind with thoughts favorable to\r\nhis condition. A nurse who is inclined to be pessimistic must be taken\r\nout of the sick room, and there must be only cheerful faces and cheery\r\npeople around him. Hence the modern trained nurse, and especially the\r\npicked nurse, who does not allow herself to be disturbed, who is not\r\nfussy, who is not forcibly cheerful but quietly placid and confident\r\nand cheery, means much for the patient's recovery. Relatives are\r\nalmost sure to exert strong unfavorable suggestions, though time was\r\nwhen the devoted wife or mother might be depended upon to cover up all\r\nher personal feelings and give the best possible service for the\r\nmental uplift of the patient. When she can thus conceal her own\r\nsolicitude, a near relative may be the best possible auxiliary in\r\npsychotherapeutics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Relief.--The fourth step in the application of\r\npsychotherapeutics is that all the natural modes for the relief of\r\nsymptoms, the making of patients comfortable in body as well as in\r\nmind, must be employed. In acute rheumatism, for instance, a number of\r\nsmall pillows must be at the disposition of the patient so that his\r\nlimbs can be fixed in those positions in which there is the least\r\ndiscomfort. Every physician should frequently read Hilton's classical\r\nvolume on \"Rest and Pain\" because of its unpretentious significance\r\nfor psychotherapy, as well as its enduring value in the treatment of\r\npainful conditions. Just as soon as a patient finds that simple\r\nprocedures relieve his pain and add to his comfort, his fear of the\r\nseriousness of his ailment is lessened, {189} and he begins to get\r\nbettor. Cold water in fevers, cold fresh air in pneumonia, all the\r\nnatural modes of treating disease, thus become active factors in the\r\napplication of psychotherapy. When fevers were treated by the\r\nadministration of hot drinks the effect upon the patient's mind must\r\nhave been quite serious. Freedom to use cold water, just as one wants\r\nit and whenever it is craved for, is of itself an excellent\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuroses in Organic Disease.--Fifth, psychotherapy, by suggestion, may\r\nalleviate or even completely eradicate neurotic symptoms that develop\r\nin connection with organic diseases. Such neurotic symptoms may prove\r\neven more bothersome to the patient than the symptoms due to his\r\nunderlying affection, and may, by interfering with nutrition, hamper\r\nrecovery. The appetite of a patient who is worrying about a chronic\r\ndisease will be disturbed, and, as a consequence of insufficient food,\r\nconstipation and a whole train of attendant evils may ensue. Headache,\r\nsleeplessness, worry at slight irritation and exaggerated complaints\r\nfrom slight pain may all be due to this worry and not to the\r\nunderlying disease. All these, the result of over-solicitude, are\r\nattributed by the patient to his chronic ailment. They can be relieved\r\nby simple measures after he is saved from his own worry. Until the\r\npatient is made to rouse himself and look hopefully at the situation,\r\neating more, getting out more, and relaxing his mind from its constant\r\nattention to himself, he cannot get better.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Principles.--It should be pointed out to the patient\r\nthat there is a constant tendency to exaggerate the significance of\r\ndisease. This is true in acute as well as in chronic disease, but in\r\nacute diseases the necessity for removing unfavorable influences\r\ndirectly is not so urgent, since usually the presence of the\r\nphysician, with his simple declaration of the meaning of symptoms, is\r\nsufficient to neutralize the effect of previous exaggerations.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the action of unfavorable suggestions due to imperfect\r\nknowledge (everything unknown is magnified, as Cicero said), or to\r\nprevious medical opinions which the case does not justify, must be\r\nstopped. The natural dread which comes to all men in the presence of\r\nsymptoms of disease must be as far as possible removed.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the favorable elements in the case should be emphasized. This\r\nneeds to be thoroughly done in order to secure the patient's\r\nco-operation, even though the serious possibilities of his ailment may\r\nbe pointed out to his friends. These friends, however, must be persons\r\nwho can be absolutely depended on not to reveal by word, or, what is\r\nmuch more important, by their looks or actions, the possible worse\r\nprognosis of the case.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, people expect a doctor to tell them the worst, rather\r\nthan the best. Many physicians seem to have formed the habit of\r\nrepresenting the condition of patients as grave as possible, in order,\r\napparently, that they may have more credit when the patient recovers.\r\nNot a little of the tendency of ills to hang on in neurotic persons is\r\ndue to this habit. Over-cautiousness leads some physicians to reveal a\r\ncase in its worst aspect, lest, by any chance, something unexpected\r\nshould happen, and the friends of the patient might think that the\r\nphysician was incompetent because he had not anticipated it. Some of\r\nthe serious accidents of disease are quite beyond anticipation; but\r\nthey occur only rarely. For the sake of safeguarding the possible\r\nreflection on the physician because of them, it is quite unjustifiable\r\nto make bad {190} prognosis habitually, for this acts deterrently on\r\nthe vital resistance and delays recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of Organic Disease_.--It is usually considered that\r\npsychotherapy is beneficial only in nervous cases; yet we know that\r\nall sorts of affections with tissue changes in the skin, in the\r\ncirculation, and very probably also in the internal organs, may be\r\nproduced in hysterical affections--ailments dependent on loss of\r\ncontrol over the vaso-motor nervous system. Just as ills can be\r\nproduced, so they may also be cured. As a matter of fact, analysis of\r\nthe statistics of disease cured by mental influence, shows that it has\r\nbeen more strikingly manifest in organic than in so-called nervous or\r\nfunctional diseases. Neurotic patients often make extremely unsuitable\r\nsubjects for the exercise of mental influence, because their very\r\nnervousness is a manifestation of lack of power properly to control\r\nthe mind. Cures by mental influence have oftenest been reported in\r\nnon-neurotic patients. As Dr. Hack Tuke pointed out in \"The Influence\r\nof the Mind on the Body\" as long ago as 1884, it is in such cases as\r\nrheumatism, gout and dropsy that benefit was most frequently reported\r\nby mental means.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, certain digestive and intestinal ailments that evidently\r\nare associated with tissue changes, have in recent years come\r\nparticularly into this category of ailments affected by psychotherapy.\r\nDr. Hack Tuke's declaration, made nearly thirty years ago, seems\r\nconservative even at the present day: \"The only inference which we are\r\njustified in drawing from the statistics of the affections cured by\r\nmental means is that the beneficial influence of psychotherapeutics is\r\nby no means confined to nervous disorders.\" Many physicians are likely\r\nto hold that when cures take place the so-called organic diseases were\r\nnot actual, but were only _supposed_ to exist because of certain\r\nobscure symptoms that apparently could not otherwise be explained. But\r\nmany of the cases have had external symptoms, striking and\r\nunmistakable. To assume that physicians of experience and authority\r\nwere in error in diagnosing them is simply to beg the question. It is\r\nmore probable that mental influence acted curatively even over tissue\r\nchanges as it so often does, directly under our observation, in the\r\nproduction of such changes in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tissue Changes From Nerves_.--Until one recalls how many physical\r\nchanges may be brought about by mental influences or emotional\r\ndisturbances, it is not always clear just how mental influence can\r\naffect disease favorably or unfavorably. Prof. Forel, of Zurich, in\r\nhis \"Hygiene der Nerven und des Geistes im Gesunden und Kranken\r\nZusande,\" Zurich, 1905, English translation 1907, brings together into\r\na single paragraph most of these physical and physiological influences\r\nof the mind upon the central nervous system:\r\n\r\n  Through the brain and spinal cord, thoughts can lead to a paralysing\r\n  or stimulation of the sympathetic ganglion nodes, and consequently\r\n  to blushing or blanching of certain peripheral parts. Through\r\n  disturbance of this mechanism, many nervous disorders arise, such as\r\n  chilblains, sweats, bleeding of the nose, chills and congestions,\r\n  various disturbances of the reproductive organs, and, if it lasts\r\n  long enough, nutritional disturbances in the part of the body\r\n  supplied by the blood vessels affected. In the same way there are\r\n  peripheral ganglionic mechanisms which superintend glandular\r\n  secretion, the action of the intestinal muscles, etc. These likewise\r\n  can be influenced through the brain by ideas and emotions. Thus we\r\n  can explain how constipation and a vast number of other disturbances\r\n  of digestion and of menstruation can be produced through the brain,\r\n  without having their cause in {191} the place in which they appear.\r\n  It is for the same reason that such disturbances can be cured by\r\n  hypnotic suggestion.\r\n\r\n_Health and the Central Nervous System_.--Nature has so constituted\r\nand ordered the human economy that its health depends to a great\r\nextent on conditions in the central nervous system. We discuss\r\nelsewhere the return of vitalism in physiology--that is, the\r\nreassertion of a principle of life behind the chemical and physical\r\nforces of the human organism regulating it, supplying energy,\r\noccasionally enabling it to transcend the ordinary laws of osmosis, or\r\nthe diffusion of gases. The main seat of this principle of life is in\r\nthe central nervous system and especially in the cerebral cortex. The\r\nimportance of this portion of the human anatomy can scarcely be\r\nexaggerated. In his inaugural address to the Royal Medical Society,\r\n[Footnote 23] delivered at Edinburgh in 1896, Prof. T. S. Clouston,\r\nthe distinguished English psychiatrist, has a passage on this subject\r\nthat deserves to be recalled:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: _British Medical Journal_, January 18, 1896.]\r\n\r\n  I would desire this evening to lay down and to enforce a principle\r\n  that is, I think, not sufficiently, and often not at all, considered\r\n  in practical medicine and surgery. It is founded on a physiological\r\n  basis, and it is of the highest practical importance. The principle\r\n  is that the brain cortex, and especially the mental cortex, has such\r\n  a position in the economy that it has to be reckoned with more or\r\n  less as a factor for good or evil in all diseases of every organ, in\r\n  all operations and in all injuries. Physiologically, the cortex is\r\n  the great regulator of all functions, the ever active controller of\r\n  every organ and the ultimate court of appeal in every organic\r\n  disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psychotherapy in Its Relation to Patient and Physician_.--In spite of\r\nthe present-day fad for psychotherapy, I have no illusions with regard\r\nto its popularity among patients, unless practiced with due regard to\r\nindividuals and with proper tact. Psychotherapy has been most\r\neffective in the past when it was cloaked beneath the personality of\r\nthe physician; when it was felt that there was in him a power to do\r\ngood that must help the patient. This personal influence has to be\r\nmaintained if the patient's mind is to be influenced favorably. Very\r\nfew people are willing to think, and still less to welcome the\r\nthought, that they themselves are either bringing about a continuance\r\nof their symptoms or are hindering their own recovery. They are quick\r\nto conclude that this would be a confession that their ills are\r\nimaginary. \"Imaginary\" has no place in medicine. There are physical\r\nills and mental ills. Mental ills are just as real as physical ills.\r\nThere are no fancied ills. A person may be ailing because he persuades\r\nhimself that he is ailing, but in that case his mind is so affecting\r\nhis body that he is actually ailing physically, though the etiology of\r\nthe trouble is mental.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the physician to get at these mental causes of\r\nphysical ills and remove them by persuasion, by reassurance, by\r\nchanging the mental attitude, by making people understand just how\r\nmind influences body, but this must be done tactfully. From the\r\nbeginning of time we have written our prescriptions in such a way that\r\nninety-nine out of one hundred patients have not been able to\r\nunderstand them. It has often been said that we should change this\r\nmethod of prescription writing, and write directions for the\r\ncompounding of our medicines in plain vernacular. Besides the many\r\n{192} scientific reasons against this, it is better for patients not\r\nto know exactly the details of their treatment. Physicians, because of\r\ntheir real or supposed knowledge, are usually the worst patients. If,\r\nwhen a physician is ill, a drug is administered in which he has lost\r\nconfidence, he will really oppose its action by contrary suggestion,\r\nand perhaps neutralize it. Confidence added to the action of the drug\r\nitself, makes it much more potent and much more direct. Hence the\r\nsuggestive value of a prescription the ingredients of which are\r\nunknown. Every physician knows of patients who have declared that a\r\ndrug has been tried on them without avail, when it has only been used\r\nin such small quantities as to be quite nugatory in its effect. Such\r\nuse was enough to prejudice them against it so that when given in\r\nphysiological doses it failed to work properly.\r\n\r\nOpium given to a trusting patient, in gradually reduced doses until\r\npractically there is nothing but the flavor of the drug in the\r\ncompound that he takes, will continue to have its effect. But to a\r\npatient prejudiced against the drug, even large doses of opium will\r\nprove unavailing, because the lack of confidence disturbs the mind,\r\ndirects attention to whatever discomfort may be present, emphasizes\r\nthe ill and prevents sleep by preoccupying the mind with the thought\r\nthat neither the drug nor the dose can accomplish its purpose. In a\r\nword, medicine plus mental influence is extremely valuable. Medicine\r\nminus mental influence is valuable but sometimes ineffective.\r\nMedicine, with mental influence opposed to it, is often without effect\r\nbecause of the strong power the mind has over bodily functions.\r\n\r\nMost people would rather be cured by some supposedly wonderful\r\ndiscovery, which presumedly made it clear that they had been suffering\r\nfrom a severe and quite unusual ailment, than by ordinary simple\r\nmethods. The recent growth of interest in psychotherapy and psychology\r\nhas, however, somewhat prepared people to accept mental influence as\r\nan important factor in therapeutics. The direct and frank use of\r\npsychotherapy will be of benefit to these people. But in most cases\r\nmental influence will have to be exerted in such a way as to conceal\r\nfrom patients that it is their own energy we want to tap to help them\r\ncure themselves. This would be for them quite an unsatisfactory method\r\nof being cured. In practically all cases such a combination of methods\r\nis needed that the place of mental influence is not over-emphasized.\r\nAs a rule, mental influence must not be used alone. Its place is that\r\nof an adjunct, a precious auxiliary, to other methods of treatment.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy represents one of the important elements in\r\ntherapeutics, and we must learn to use it in a way suitable to our\r\npatients. We have to learn to use our drugs in accordance with the\r\nnature and physical make-up of the patient. We have to find out by\r\nexperience just how to use hydrotherapy for each individual. Varying\r\ncurrents of electricity and varying forms of electrical action are\r\nneeded for different individuals. Just in the same way, our\r\npsychotherapy must be dosed out according to the special need of each\r\nindividual, the form of the affection and the particular kind of mind\r\nthat is to be dealt with. To learn the place of mental influence in\r\nhealing, so that we shall not be attributing to other therapeutic\r\nfactors what is really due to the mind, will be a great advance in\r\ntherapeutics. This is the mistake that we have been making in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the applications of the general principles of psychotherapy\r\n{193} include all means, apart from the physical, of influencing\r\npatients. Drugs will always have a large place in rational therapy.\r\nMany physical remedial measures, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy,\r\nclimatotherapy and others, must be important adjuncts. To these is now\r\nadded psychotherapy. It has been used before, as have most of the\r\nother forms of therapy, but in our day we are trying to systematize\r\ntherapeutic modes so as to secure the greatest possible information\r\nwith regard to their exact application. This is what must be done with\r\nregard to psychotherapy also. Just now its importance is being\r\nexaggerated by ardent advocates. In every department of therapy this\r\nhas always been done by enthusiasts. The business of the practicing\r\nphysician must be to select what is best, and above all what is sure\r\nand harmless, from the many suggestions offered, so as to build up a\r\npractical body of applied truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n{194}\r\n\r\nSECTION V\r\n\r\n_ADJUVANTS AND DISTURBING FACTORS_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION\r\n\r\nUnder the head of Adjuvants and Disturbing Factors in the psychic\r\ntreatment of patients come the various phases of life which make for\r\nand against such a favorable state of mind as predisposes to the\r\ncontinuance of good health, minimizes inhibition, and adds to\r\nfavorable suggestion. By modifying the modes of life, an ever renewed\r\nset of suggestions is initiated. By definite instruction and advice\r\nwith regard to exercise, position, training, habit, pain, occupation\r\nof mind and diversion of mind, patients may be profoundly influenced,\r\nand gradually made to take on an entirely new attitude of mind towards\r\nthemselves. These chapters, then, while apparently much more concerned\r\nwith physiotherapy than psychotherapy, are really directions for the\r\nuse of such physical methods as by frequent repetition make the most\r\nvaluable suggestions. There is probably nothing more valuable in the\r\nordinary application of psychotherapy than these various auxiliaries,\r\nwith their power to remove disturbing factors, while, on the other\r\nhand, nothing aids more in bringing relief for many conditions than\r\nthe removal of certain disturbing factors.\r\n\r\nThere is now a general recognition of the fact that suggestion in the\r\nwaking state can in most cases be as therapeutically efficient as\r\nhypnotism, and is probably even more enduring in its effects when\r\nsuccessful, without the dangers and sequelae connected with hypnosis.\r\n_Every idea tends to act itself out_. When we crave something, when\r\nthere are active ideas of desire, there usually are movements of our\r\nflexor muscles. These affect the hands especially. At moments of\r\nhatred, detestation or abhorrence our extensor muscles are affected,\r\nas if we would wave these things away from us. There may even be an\r\ninvoluntary turning of the trunk muscles, as if we would no longer\r\nface what is abhorrent, though the repulsive thing may be present only\r\nto the mind. It is not far-fetched to argue that, since the voluntary\r\nfunction of muscles is thus influenced, other functions are also\r\ntouched by emotions, ideas, trains of thought, especially when the\r\nmind is much concentrated on them.\r\n\r\nBishop, the so-called mind-reader, whose exhibitions attracted much\r\nattention in London and New York some years ago, confessed that his\r\nfeats were accomplished mainly through muscle reading. He would permit\r\na committee to select a book in a library in a certain house, and even\r\na particular page of {195} that book, and then, blindfolded, sitting\r\nwith the committee in a carriage with his hand on the forehead and the\r\narm of one of the committee, he would direct just where the carriage\r\nshould be driven and would, while always continuing his contact with\r\nthe member of the committee, go to the particular house and room,\r\nselect the special book, and eventually find the page. There was no\r\nopportunity for collusion in some of these feats. The most startling\r\nthings were often accomplished by the system of forcing a choice which\r\nprestidigitateurs use in order to compel the taking of the particular\r\ncard by suggestion (though all the time they seemed to be leaving\r\nabsolute liberty of selection to the person), but there was much,\r\nbesides this, required to accomplish what he did. He said that there\r\nwere always involuntary muscle movements, little starts and tremors\r\nthat guided him in his work. Other exhibitors have been able to use\r\nthis to a considerable extent, though not with Bishop's success. That\r\nour thoughts can be read in our muscle system is interesting and\r\nvaluable confirmation of the unconscious tendency of ideas to affect\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nWhen a single idea occupies the consciousness it will, some\r\npsychologists insist, necessarily act itself out unless some\r\ndistracting thought prevents it. We know how difficult it is to stand\r\nat the edge of a height, say at the brink of a waterfall or on the\r\ncornice of a high building, or to look down a mine or elevator shaft,\r\nbecause the thought comes to us, how dreadful it would be to plunge\r\nover. As a consequence of this insistent idea taking possession of our\r\nconsciousness, we have the sense of falling, we become tremulous and\r\nhave to withdraw, or we would actually fall, or find in ourselves a\r\ntendency to throw ourselves over. There are persons who cannot even\r\nsit in the front row of a balcony because of the constant effort\r\nrequired to neutralize the suggestion that they may fall or throw\r\nthemselves over its railing. Curious sensations become associated with\r\nthis idea--a feeling of numbness and tingling in the back, sometimes a\r\ngirdle feeling, sometimes a sense of suffocation. All of these are due\r\nto the concentration of attention on a single idea and its\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nVery few men, shaving themselves with an old-fashioned razor, have\r\nnot, at moments of worry and nervousness, sometimes had the thought of\r\nhow easy it would be to end existence by drawing the edge of the razor\r\nthrough the important structures in the neck. Some are so affected by\r\nthis thought that they have to give up shaving themselves. It is a\r\nsurprise usually to find how otherwise sensible, according to all our\r\nordinary standards, are the individuals who confess to having had\r\nannoyance from such thoughts. This illustrates how strongly suggestive\r\nthe concentration of attention may make an idea, and how much a single\r\nidea, when it alone occupies the center of consciousness, tends to\r\nwork itself out in act, though there is no reason at all for willing\r\nin that direction. It is not improbable that in some inexplicable\r\ncases of suicide the tendency has actually worked itself out.\r\n\r\nThe expression, \"he is a man of one idea,\" enshrines in popular\r\nlanguage the conclusion of psychologists that if a single idea is\r\npresent in the mind it will surely work itself out. We all know how\r\nmuch men of one idea accomplish. All their powers, physical and\r\nmental, are brought to bear on its development. Obstacles that deter\r\nother men, conditions that prevent others from daring even to think of\r\ndoing the thing, seem as nothing to the man {196} of one idea, and in\r\nspite of discouragement, and even apparent failure, he often succeeds,\r\nnotwithstanding obstacles that seemed insurmountable. What is thus\r\ntrue in the practical world is paralleled, for both good and ill, in\r\nthe microcosm of the human body. A man who has one idea to urge him on\r\nis capable of accomplishing things in spite of pains and aches and all\r\nsorts of disturbances of function. On the other hand, if the one idea\r\nis unfavorable, then, in spite of a heritage of good physical and\r\nmental powers, his efficiency is inhibited. If a man gets an idea that\r\nthere is something the matter with any organ, and concentrates\r\nattention on it, he will surely disturb the function of that organ.\r\nJust the opposite, however, will happen in case, even with physical\r\ndefect, he believes that there is nothing the matter, or only\r\nsomething that can be overcome. This is the power of faith as\r\nillustrated in the various forms of faith healing, from mental science\r\nto Eddyism and the rest.\r\n\r\nThis is the power that the physician must learn to use. In _The\r\nLancet_ for November, 1905, Dr. J. W. Springthorpe, writing on the\r\n\"Position, Use and Abuse of Mental Therapeutics,\" said:\r\n\r\n  Few indeed are the medical practitioners who daily prescribe\r\n  suggestion as well as diet, hygiene and drugs. Yet the physician who\r\n  makes even a minimum effort in this direction often does more for\r\n  his patient than his more highly qualified confrere, who makes none.\r\n  To some, and they naturally the most successful, this endeavor comes\r\n  without conscious search, and improves with experience, but in some\r\n  measure it may be acquired by all and no one who has become familiar\r\n  with its powers will henceforward be content to remain without its\r\n  constant aid.\r\n\r\nThis power is thoroughly exploited by the irregular practitioner, and\r\nthe regular practitioner is bound in duty to learn to use it just as\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nWhat is true for the lesser faculties is eminently true for our most\r\nimportant faculty, the intellect. We all know how intellectual\r\ntraining enables us to accomplish without difficulty what at first\r\nseemed almost impossible. Not only that, but we acquire the power to\r\ndevote ourselves to a subject that was at first irksome, if not\r\nactually forbidding. There are educators who insist that this\r\ndiscipline of mind, by which the power to devote ourselves to what we\r\ndo not care for is gained, is the principal fruit of genuine\r\neducation. It has been lost, or at least impaired to a great degree,\r\nby educational experiments, especially those related to the elective\r\nsystem which pushed interest, instead of discipline, into the\r\nforeground of education. In the same way the power of self-control,\r\nand the faculty of self-denial, so precious to the human race, have\r\nbeen lessened by the methods of training which omitted the\r\nconsideration of these and emphasized the idea of personal comfort.\r\nMuch can be done to make the unpleasant things that are inevitable in\r\nlife not only tolerable, but actually to give a satisfaction\r\nsurpassing selfish pleasure. It is this discipline that is needed in\r\npsychotherapy at the present time and the physician must endeavor to\r\nencourage it by every means in his power.\r\n\r\nThe one purpose of the use of suggestion in therapeutics, then, is to\r\nsecure as far as possible concentration of mind on a single idea. This\r\nis what is done in hypnosis, but frequently in such a way as to leave\r\nthe idea {197} to work out unfavorably associated suggestions. If\r\nthere could, in the conscious state, be the same absolute\r\nconcentration of mind on an idea, a great force for good, without\r\naccompaniment of ill, would be secured. Experience has shown that with\r\npatient effort and definite methods such concentration of attention on\r\na single idea can be secured, at least to such an extent as to make it\r\nefficiently therapeutic.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, suggestion accompanies the material remedies that the\r\ndoctor prescribes. He must emphasize just when and how the medicine is\r\nto be taken, and it is well to emphasize the effects that are expected\r\nand just about how they will come. If he is prescribing a tonic, he\r\ndoes not merely say before meals. He specifies from ten to twenty\r\nminutes before meals, according as he wishes it taken, with a definite\r\namount of water, stating that the taste of it will excite appetite and\r\nthat only food in reasonably liberal quantities will satisfy the\r\ncraving produced by it. If he is prescribing a laxative, he states\r\njust when it should be taken and when its effects may be expected. The\r\narousing of expectancy does much to relax inhibition and to permit the\r\nflow of nervous impulses that may be helpful. If a sleeping potion is\r\ngiven, the patient is directed to compose himself for sleep\r\nimmediately after it is taken, or to take it just a definite time\r\nbefore he gets into bed, and then to expect its action in the course\r\nof twenty minutes or a half hour, designating rather definitely just\r\nwhen it shall have its climax of effect. Two or three things done\r\ntogether, as, for instance, a gentle rubbing with cool water over the\r\nbody to produce a glow, a warm foot-bath, and then a sleeping potion,\r\nwill combine to produce a climax of physical and psychical effect.\r\n\r\nIn many conditions that come for treatment to the modern physician,\r\nthe physical remedies are much less important than the psychical. This\r\nis particularly true for the affections known as psychoneuroses, in\r\nwhich some slight nervous disturbance is exaggerated into an extremely\r\npainful condition or a disturbing paralytic state; in the so-called\r\nhysteria of the older times; in the drug habits; in the sex habits; in\r\nthe over-eating and under-eating habits, and then with regard to\r\ndreads and other psychic disturbances connected with dreams,\r\npremonitions and the like. In all these cases it is important to\r\nsecure concentration of the patient's mind on a neutralizing\r\nsuggestion. This must be done deliberately and in such a way as to\r\nsecure thorough concentration of attention. It is often a time-taking\r\nprocess, but nearly everything worth while requires time, and the\r\nresults justify the expenditure. Methods mean much in the attainment\r\nof this. They must be impressive, the patient must be convinced of the\r\npower of the physician to help him, and he must have trust in the\r\nefficacy of the mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be put into a comfortable position, preferably in a\r\nlarge, easy arm-chair, should be asked to compose himself in such a\r\nway as to bring about thorough relaxation of muscles, and then to give\r\nhis whole attention to the subjects in hand. Occasionally the arms\r\nshould be lifted and allowed to fall, to see whether relaxation is\r\ncomplete, and the knee jerks may be tested, to show the patient that\r\nhe is not yet allowing himself fully to relax. There should be no\r\nlines in the face: the muscles around the mouth, and especially those\r\nin the forehead, should relax. It is surprising how {198} much can be\r\ndone, sometimes by slight touches on the forehead, to secure this. The\r\npatient should then be made to feel that the tension in which he has\r\nbeen holding himself, and which makes it so difficult for him to\r\nrelax, has really been consuming energy that he can use to overcome\r\nthe tendencies to sensory or motor disturbance, or to supply the lack\r\nof will which makes him a victim of a drug or other habit, or takes\r\naway from him that mental control that would enable him to at once\r\nthrow off dreads and doubts and questionings and bothersome\r\npremonitions which now, because of the short circuiting on himself\r\nthrough worry and nervousness, he cannot do.\r\n\r\nTwo or three seances usually show a patient how much better control\r\nover himself even a short period of relaxation will give. He comes out\r\nof a ten-minute session of relaxation, during which he has been talked\r\nto quietly, soothingly, encouragingly, with a new sense of power.\r\nOften he feels that there will be no difficulty in overcoming his\r\nhabit. This may pass, of course, but he has received a new idea of his\r\nown resources of energy and self-control.\r\n\r\nIn most cases it is well, after securing relaxation, to ask the\r\npatient to close his eyes gently and to keep them closed till all his\r\nmuscles are relaxed. Then suggestions may be made to him with regard\r\nto his power to control cravings, and to put away doubts and\r\nquestionings, because, after all, as he sees them himself, they are\r\nquite irrational and entirely due to habitual tendencies that he has\r\nallowed to grow on him. A concentration of attention on the idea, not\r\nonly of conquering but of being able to conquer, will be secured.\r\nUnless this complete attention can be had, suggestion in the waking\r\nstate may not prove efficient. There are nervous, excitable people for\r\nwhom, at the beginning, it will be quite impossible to secure such\r\nrelaxation and peaceful quiet as will be helpful to them. For these a\r\nnumber of seances may be necessary, but on each occasion a little more\r\nof quieting influence is secured.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, this quiet, peaceful condition, with eyes closed,\r\nthorough relaxation and absolute attention, has sometimes been spoken\r\nof as the hypnoidal state. If it be recalled that hypnos in Greek\r\nmeans sleep, and that this is a state resembling sleep with the\r\nrestfulness that sleep gives, the term is valuable in its suggestions.\r\nIf, however, the word is connected with hypnotism, then there may be\r\nan unfortunate connotation. This state is entirely free from the\r\ndangers of hypnotism, and instead of making a patient dependent on his\r\nphysician, teaches him to depend on his own will. It is not a new\r\ninvention as this term hypnoidal might seem to indicate, but is as old\r\nas our history at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEXERCISE\r\n\r\nIn recent years a great change has come over the popular mind\r\nregarding exercise, especially in the open air. It is well to\r\nemphasize at the very beginning the subject of too much exercise,\r\nbecause there is no doubt in the minds of many who study the question,\r\nthat many Americans, and indeed people of the northern nations\r\ngenerally, take a certain amount of voluntary {199} exercise that is\r\nnot good for them, though they take it at the cost of considerable\r\neffort and sacrifice of time and are firmly persuaded that it is of\r\ngreat benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSufficient Exercise.--There is a much larger number of persons who do\r\nnot take sufficient exercise. The amount to be taken is eminently an\r\nindividual matter. Neurotic patients exaggerate everything in either\r\ndirection, so that perhaps the state of affairs that exists is not so\r\nsurprising as it might otherwise seem. Instead of the uncertainty that\r\nprompts now to too much exercise, and again to too little, for\r\nhealth's sake there must, as far as possible, be a definite settlement\r\nof the needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Customs.--There is a curious difference in the attitude of\r\nmind of the various nations towards exercise. Most of the southern\r\nnations of Europe do not as a rule take any violent exercise. As is\r\nwell known, however, they are not for this reason any less healthy\r\nthan their northern contemporaries, though perhaps they are less\r\nstrong and muscular. But muscularity and health are not convertible\r\nterms, though many people seem to think they are. An excess of any\r\ntissue is not good. Our economy should be taxed to maintain only what\r\nis useful to it. Nature evidently intended, in cold climates at least,\r\nthat men should maintain a certain blanket of fat to help them retain\r\ntheir natural heat, but any excess of fat lessens their resistive\r\nvitality by lowering oxidation processes. Fat in cold climates can be\r\nused to advantage as a retainer of heat. In the warmer climate it\r\nwould be a decided disadvantage. Muscular tissue is a manufacturer of\r\nheat and this is a decided advantage in the colder climates, but in\r\nthe temperate zone, where the summers are very warm, muscle in\r\nover-abundance, unless its energy is consumed by actual physical\r\nexercise, may be quite as much of a burden as fat. Muscular people do\r\nnot stand heat well. They demand exercise to keep muscle energy from\r\nbeing converted into heat, and they require frequent cold baths, and\r\nother forms of heat dissipation, in order to be reasonably\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise in Early Years.--The question of the amount of exercise that\r\nis to be taken must be decided at an early age for individuals. Most\r\nof the young people of the Celtic and Anglo-Saxon races are tempted by\r\ntraditions and by social usage to develop considerable muscle during\r\ntheir growing years. In this respect, the difference between the\r\nGerman and the English schoolboy is very striking. The English\r\nschoolboy is likely to be as \"hard as nails,\" as the expression is, as\r\na consequence of violent exercise in his various sports, taken often\r\nto the uttermost limit of fatigue. The German schoolboy has his walk\r\nto and from school, and some other simple methodical exercises, with\r\nsome mild amusements that make little demand on muscle, but of games\r\nin the open he has very few, and of the violent sports he has none at\r\nall. A comparison of the health of the two nations will not show that\r\nthe English boy, who receives a public school and a university\r\neducation, with all their temptations to exercise, enjoys any better\r\nhealth, and, above all, reaches an average longer life than the German\r\nyouth, who has gone through a similar educational career in his own\r\ncountry, but without the athletic training that the English schoolboy\r\nhas had.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the absence of athletics and its diverting\r\ninterest, the German is apt to have learned more than his English\r\ncolleague, but a {200} comparison of mortality and morbidity tables\r\nwould show that his resistive vitality, his power to overcome disease\r\nand recover from accident is not lower than that of his colleague from\r\nacross the North Sea. The German is less strong muscularly, and in a\r\ncontest of physical effort would as a rule come out second best, but\r\nthen we have gotten beyond the period when it is important for a man\r\nto be able to defend himself by physical force, except in emergencies\r\nthat may never come. Surely the English time and effort devoted to\r\nathletics is not justified by this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation for a Sedentary Life_.--Certainly if a young man is going\r\nto live a sedentary life in his after years, it does not seem\r\nadvisable for him deliberately to devote much time to muscular\r\nexercise during his growing years. This only provides him with a set\r\nof muscles for which he has no use. Ordinarily it is assumed that\r\nmuscles are organs for the single purpose of evolving energy. This is\r\nnot true, since they are important organs for the disposition of\r\ncertain food materials and for the manufacture of heat for the body.\r\nNature in her economy probably never makes an organ for one function\r\nalone, but usually arranges so that each set of organs accomplishes\r\ntwo or three functions, thus saving space and utilizing nutrition to\r\nthe full. The man with a well-developed muscular system, which he is\r\nnot using, will have to feed it, and besides will have constantly to\r\nexert a controlling power over the heat that it manufactures whenever\r\nit is not dissipated by actual exercise. For these reasons he will be\r\nconstantly nagged by it into taking more exercise than his occupation\r\nin life demands, and if he does not do this, his developed musculature\r\nis likely to deteriorate so as to be a serious impediment, or to\r\ndegenerate by fatty metamorphosis into a lower order of tissue that is\r\na clog and not a help to life.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are more sensible. As students, they live quite sedentary\r\nlives, develop their muscles just enough to keep them in reasonably\r\ngood health, and then, when it comes to living an indoor life, as will\r\nbe almost inevitable in their chosen professions or occupations, they\r\ndo not meet with the difficulties that confront the Anglo-Saxon with\r\nhis burdensome, over-developed muscular system. German professors, as\r\na class, do not find themselves under the necessity of taking\r\nsystematic daily exercise. They are quite content and quite healthy\r\nwith an hour or two of sitting in the open air, and a quiet walk from\r\nthe home to the university or the school. With the ideas that some\r\npeople have with regard to the value of exercise for health, it might\r\nbe expected that the German professors would be less healthy than\r\ntheir Anglo-Saxon colleagues. This is notoriously untrue, for the\r\nGermans live longer lives on the average, and most of them accomplish\r\nmuch more, and above all are much more content in the accomplishment,\r\nthan their physically strenuous Anglo-Saxon colleagues. They are not\r\noppressed by the demands of a muscular system that insists on having\r\nits functions exercised, since it has been called into being in the\r\nformative period. These German professors live to a magnificent old\r\nage, requiring very little sleep and often doing a really enormous\r\namount of work. The man with a developed muscular system generally\r\nrequires prolonged sleep, particularly after exercise, but even\r\nwithout it very seldom is it possible for him to do with less than\r\nseven hours, while the Germans often are content and healthy with five\r\nhours, or less.\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\nOur muscular system is our principal heat-making apparatus. It is easy\r\nto understand. If we have larger heat-making organs than are necessary\r\nfor the maintenance of the temperature of the body, and if we have no\r\nmode of dissipating our heat by muscular energy, as through exercise,\r\nthen there will be a constant tendency for our temperature to rise,\r\nwhich must be overcome, at considerable expense of energy, by the\r\nheat-regulating mechanism of the body. This heat-regulating mechanism\r\nis extremely delicate, yet does not seem to be easily disturbed. With\r\nthe external temperature at 120 deg. F. or--10 deg., human temperature is\r\nconstant. With a heating apparatus entirely too large for its purpose,\r\nit is no wonder that irritability of the nervous system ensues because\r\nof the constant over-exercise of a function called for from it. It is\r\nthis state of affairs which seems to me to account for the marked\r\ntendency to nervous unrest, and to the presence of many heart and\r\ndigestive symptoms that often characterize athletes who develop a\r\nmagnificent muscular system when they are young, and later have no use\r\nfor it. They must learn the lesson and keep up the practice of using\r\ntheir muscles sufficiently to dissipate surplus heat, so as to prevent\r\nthis energy from being used up in various ways within the body, with a\r\nresulting disturbance of many delicate nervous mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseless Muscles.--Whatever a human being has to carry round as useless\r\ncan only be expressed by the telling Roman word for the baggage of an\r\narmy, _impedimenta_. Prof. James, in his \"Principles of Psychology,\"\r\nsums up the law very well:\r\n\r\n  The great thing in all education is to make our nervous system our\r\n  ally instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capitalize our\r\n  acquisitions and live at ease upon the interest of the fund. For\r\n  this we must make automatic and habitual as early as possible as\r\n  many useful actions as can be and guard against the growing into\r\n  ways that may be disadvantageous to us as we should guard against\r\n  the plague.\r\n\r\nAn over-developed muscular system, with its tendency to manufacture\r\nheat and its craving to be used, and the consciousness it is so apt to\r\nproduce of ability to stand various dangerous efforts, is a\r\ndisadvantage rather than an advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseless Fat.--This reminds us very much of the attitude with regard to\r\nchildren in the acquisition of fat. Chubby babies with rolls of fat\r\nall over them and deep creases near their joints are considered to be\r\n\"perfectly lovely.\" Mothers are proud to exhibit them. They are\r\nsupposed to be typical examples of abounding good health. Neighborly\r\nmothers come in to coo over them and, in general, the main aim of\r\nexistence for children in their early years would seem to be to make\r\nthem as fat as possible. Such children, as is brought out in the\r\ndiscussion of the subject in the chapter on obesity, are not healthy\r\nin the true sense of the word, are well known to be of lower resistive\r\nvitality than thinner infants, and easily succumb to diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResistive Vitality.--One reason for the early deaths of many athletes\r\nis the fact that, confident of their strength, they allow themselves\r\nto become so overwhelmed by an infection, before they confess that\r\nthey are sick and take to bed, that often the cure of their affection\r\nis hopeless. Ordinarily neither pneumonia nor typhoid are likely to be\r\nfatal diseases for men between twenty and fifty. If a man's heart and\r\nkidneys are in good condition during this {202} period, an attack of\r\neither of these diseases, while a serious incident, is likely to be\r\nonly a passing loss of time. Rather frequently, however, strong and\r\nhealthy men without any organic defect that may be considered\r\nresponsible for the fatal termination, succumb to these diseases. The\r\nreason for the fatality is that they are not willing to admit that\r\nthey are ill enough to be in bed, they have a large reserve force of\r\nstrength on which they call and which enables them, for a good while,\r\nto resist the weakening influence of disease. Doctors know and dread\r\nthese cases. A young man in the flower of youth, with magnificent\r\nmuscular development, comes into the office breathing very rapidly and\r\nwith a laboring pulse. Almost exhausted, he sinks into a chair,\r\nconfesses that he is nearly \"all in,\" and wonders what is the matter.\r\nAt times the physician will find practically a whole lung solidified\r\nby pneumonia, and at times both lungs are seriously affected. The\r\nwonder is how the young man succeeded in holding out so long.\r\nSometimes the doctor is summoned to see him because he has fainted in\r\nhis home, or in his office, and his friends are alarmed. These cases\r\nare almost invariably fatal. Any one who continues to be up and around\r\nuntil the third or fourth day of pneumonia will have so exhausted his\r\nvitality, no matter how great that may be, that he will have no\r\nreserve force for the life-struggle that must come before the crisis\r\nis reached.\r\n\r\nNearly the same thing is true for typhoid fever in the same class of\r\npersons. A young athlete, who considers it babyish to confess to\r\nillness, complains of feeling out of sorts but nothing more, until\r\nsome morning he is literally unable to leave his bed, or has a\r\nfainting fit after going up-stairs. He is found by the physician with\r\na temperature of 104 deg., or near it, and with evident signs of being in\r\nthe middle of the second week of typhoid fever. The termination of\r\nsuch a case is generally fatal.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary man knows his limitations better; he recognizes the fact\r\nthat he may be ill, and gives in quietly and rests, so that nature may\r\nemploy all her energies in conquering the infection. Most of the\r\nlong-lived people of history have been rather delicate and have\r\nlearned young the precious lesson of caring for themselves. This care\r\nhas not been exaggerated, but it has consisted in avoiding danger, in\r\nresting when tired, in not overdoing things, and above all in yielding\r\nto the symptoms of disease before these become serious.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation of Exercise.--Each man must be a law unto himself as to the\r\namount of exercise that is necessary for him. He must take enough to\r\nuse up the energy supplied by the food he eats, just as, on the other\r\nhand, he must eat enough food to make up for whatever waste there is\r\nin his body. There are many men who eat over-heartily and then have to\r\ntake exercise to use up this material or else suffer for it. This is\r\none of the compensations that the hearty eater must pay: he overfeeds\r\nand becomes obese, or, if he succeeds in keeping down his weight to\r\nthe normal, it is only by the expenditure of time in securing such\r\nmuscular action as will use up surplus energy. Many men find it\r\ndifficult to control their appetites, and prefer to take exercise\r\nrather than to deny the appetite which they created during their days\r\nof indulgence in athletics. It is for such men to decide just what\r\nseems preferable. If the fuel is supplied to the heat engine, which\r\nall human beings are, it must be used for the production of energy or\r\nelse it will exert {203} itself in accumulating certain waste in the\r\ntissues, just as over-abundant fuel serves merely to clog up the\r\nfire-box of an engine without doing any work.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir and Exercise.--It is easy to deceive one's self in the matter of\r\nexercise. With regard to air such a mistake is almost impossible. As a\r\nrule, it is air rather than exercise that people need when they have\r\nthe restlessness and nervousness which comes from over-abundant\r\nnutrition. Fresh, pure air enables the individual to burn up nutritive\r\nmaterial to the best advantage by the encouragement of oxidation. It\r\nis a surprise to those who are not accustomed to it, to see how\r\ntuberculosis patients who come to sanatoria with very little appetite,\r\nsoon acquire an appetite and are able to consume large quantities of\r\nfood, to sleep well and become restful--all as the result of living\r\nconstantly in the open air during the day, and also having an\r\nabundance of fresh air at night. This is particularly true if the air\r\nin which they live is rather cold, and, above all, if it has a large\r\ndifference of temperature every day, so that there is an upward and\r\ndownward swing of the thermometer of from thirty to forty degrees.\r\nThis varying temperature seems to use up nutritive material, and keeps\r\nall the natural processes going.\r\n\r\n\r\nGymnastics.--The very opposite to this plan of open air life is that\r\nfollowed by those who take gymnastic exercises for health's sake, with\r\nthe idea that the use of certain muscles is necessary to keep the\r\nbodily economy in equilibrium. Such gymnastics are usually undertaken\r\nindoors, sometimes in stuffy quarters, and the movements are commonly\r\nrepeated with such continued routine that absolutely all interest is\r\nlost. That there are many who advocate this form of exercise, it has\r\nnearly always seemed to commonsense physicians an entirely wrong\r\nsolution of the important question of the encouragement of oxidation.\r\nIt is like running an engine, not for the purpose of having it do\r\nsomething, but simply in order to have it oil itself, and consume the\r\nfuel that has been put into its boiler and that must be used up\r\nbecause more will be put in to-morrow. It would be much better, either\r\nto limit the amount of fuel or to give the muscular exercise some\r\nuseful purpose, above all connect it with some interest that furnishes\r\ndiversion of mind at the same time that the muscles are used. This\r\nlast is the most important consideration, for, after a time,\r\ngymnastics pall in spite of artificial incentive.\r\n\r\nDr. Saleeby, in \"Health, Strength and Happiness,\" has expressed very\r\nforcibly what has come to be the feeling of many physicians with\r\nregard to gymnastics, especially indoor gymnastics:\r\n\r\n  The natural spontaneous exercise having been forbidden, and the bad\r\n  consequences of no exercise having become conspicuous, there has\r\n  been adopted a system of factitious exercise--gymnastics. That this\r\n  is better than nothing, we admit; but that it is an adequate\r\n  substitute for play we deny. . . . The common assumption that, so\r\n  long as the amount of bodily action is the same, it matters not\r\n  whether it be pleasurable or otherwise, is a grave mistake. . . .\r\n  The truth is that happiness is the most powerful of tonics. . .\r\n  Hence the intrinsic superiority of play to gymnastics. The extreme\r\n  interest felt by children in their games and the riotous glee with\r\n  which they carry on their rougher frolics, are of as much importance\r\n  as the accompanying exertion. And as not supplying these mental\r\n  stimuli, gymnastics must be radically defective.\r\n\r\n  Granting, then, as we do, that formal exercises of the limbs are\r\n  better than nothing--granting further that they may be used with\r\n  advantage as supplementary aids, we yet contend that they can never\r\n  serve in place of the exercises prompted by nature. For girls, as\r\n  well as boys, the sportive activities to which the instincts {204}\r\n  impel, are essential to bodily welfare. Whoever forbids them,\r\n  forbids the divinely appointed means to physical development.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay and Exercise.--There has been a distinct tendency in modern times\r\nto think that gymnastic exercise can be a substitute for play for\r\ngrowing young folks. When certain of the instruments and methods of\r\nthe modern systems of gymnastics which have been introduced into\r\nschools, and are supposed to be so wonderfully beneficial, are put to\r\nthe test of the psychology of exercise, the conclusions are likely to\r\nbe very different from the theories under which they were introduced.\r\nDr. Saleeby has expressed these differences rather strikingly:\r\n\r\n  Anyone who will consider for a moment the natural constitution of\r\n  man and the principles of natural education, must agree that the\r\n  deplorable thing called a dumb-bell offers an exquisite parody of\r\n  what exercise should really be. The cat, as she exercises her\r\n  kittens along the lines of their natural proclivities and needs,\r\n  never telling them that this is exercise for the sake of exercise,\r\n  and certainly prepared, if she could, to turn up her nose at any\r\n  artificial implement we might offer her--should be our model in this\r\n  respect. It may be imagined that some unfortunate girl, brought up\r\n  on early Victorian lines, having never been permitted to wear\r\n  comfortable garments, or to stretch her arms, would welcome and\r\n  enjoy the dumb-bells when first introduced to them. But any one who\r\n  has had a natural childhood and who has been taught to play, and who\r\n  has taken his or her exercise naturally, or incidentally in the\r\n  course of pursuing some mental interest--any such person may be\r\n  excused for saying that a pair of dumb-bells should be deposited in\r\n  our museums as indications of what was understood by exercise even\r\n  as late as the earlier years of the twentieth century. All exercise\r\n  for the sake of exercise is a mistake--or, at any rate, a second\r\n  best. You may do your mind--and body, too--more harm by sheer\r\n  boredom than you may gain good from the exercise you go through. The\r\n  dumb-bell symbolizes the fact that the most elementary and obvious\r\n  truths of psychology are still unrecognized, though the play and\r\n  games of every natural child--if you object to be instructed by\r\n  kittens--should be perfectly sufficient to teach us what indeed\r\n  nature taught us ages ago, if only we would listen to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndoor Sport.--Indoor sport is another thing. In wintry weather it is\r\nimpossible to play outside conveniently, and indoor games have their\r\nplace. Unfortunately they are usually associated with dust, and when\r\nplayed before crowds of spectators, the participants suffer also from\r\nthe disadvantage of rebreathed air containing, too, the emanations of\r\nthose who are looking on. It must not be forgotten that these two\r\nfactors are the most prominent predisposing causes of tuberculosis.\r\nThose who have any tendency to tuberculosis, by which is meant\r\nspecifically all those who are associating with tuberculosis patients,\r\nwhether those patients are related to them or not, or who are more\r\nthan 20 per cent. under the weight that they should have for their\r\nheight, should not be allowed to take part in indoor sports where\r\nthese drawbacks are sure to be encountered.\r\n\r\nSport, because of the diversion of mind involved, is an ideal form of\r\nexercise. An exercise that becomes a mere routine and that can be\r\neventually gone through with so mechanically as to leave abundant room\r\nfor thoughts of business or study or worries of other kinds, loses\r\nsight of one of the principal purposes of exercise as nature demands\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorseback Biding.--It is because of the complete diversion of mind\r\nthat is necessarily involved in it, that horseback riding makes such a\r\nmagnificent exercise for the busy man. The old expression \"the outside\r\nof a horse is the {205} best thing for the inside of a man\" is founded\r\neven more on the mental influence of horseback riding than its\r\nphysical quality. The same amount of exercise in the open air, taken\r\notherwise, often does not accomplish so much good, because a man's\r\nthoughts may continue to run on his business or be occupied with his\r\nworries, or he may not be able to divert his thoughts from himself and\r\nhis digestion or his ills. A horseback rider must pay attention to the\r\nother animal, rather than himself, and that represents the complete\r\ndiversion of mind so necessary for the health of most people. Just as\r\nsoon as man rides an old favorite animal on whose back he can throw\r\ndown the reins, allowing it to saunter on as it will, while he\r\noccupies himself with other things, then horseback riding loses its\r\nefficacy and falls back into the class of bicycle riding or carriage\r\nriding or walking in the open air unless there is diversion of mind in\r\nthe scenes, or the necessity for care at street crossings, to banish\r\npreoccupation of mind. Unless business troubles and worries are\r\nnecessarily excluded by its conditions, or are deliberately eliminated\r\nfrom the mind during the course of any exercise, it may even become a\r\nrenewed source of worrisome thoughts, rather than a renewal of energy,\r\nmental and physical.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether horseback riding should ever be recommended for\r\nthose who have not been accustomed to it from their youth. To ask a\r\nman past forty to learn to ride horseback for the sake of exercise is\r\nnearly always a mistake. It becomes a trial rather than a recreation,\r\nand may thus do harm rather than good. On the other hand, horseback\r\nriding is one of the things that may be, and indeed often is, much\r\nabused. The old English fox-hunting squire would never have lived out\r\nhis life even as long as he did, consuming the amount of proteid\r\nmaterial that was his custom, and drinking his three or more quarts of\r\nport at dinner every day, but that the excessive drain upon his system\r\nby long days of hard riding in the hunting field made calls upon his\r\nnutrition which kept even this amount of food and stimulant from doing\r\nimmediate harm. Just as soon, however, as long spells of severe\r\nexercise become excuses for the consumption of big dinners, and\r\nexercise is used as a factor to enable one to overeat with more\r\ncomfort than would otherwise be the case, a vicious circle is formed,\r\nand one serious abuse is counterbalanced by another. What many\r\nwell-to-do people of leisure need is not so much more exercise as less\r\neating.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking.--Perhaps the best and most readily available form of exercise\r\nfor most people is walking. It has one disadvantage. As soon as the\r\nwalk becomes too much of a routine, and the ground gone over has lost\r\nits interest, or is even of such a nature as to permit or, indeed,\r\ntempt introspection and occupation with other things, rather than with\r\nthe surroundings, then walking loses most of its efficacy as a form of\r\nexercise. Walking in the country, for instance, becomes monotonous,\r\nthough at first it is a great source of pleasure. Walking in a large\r\ncity, however, has little of this objection and as large city life has\r\ngrown more and more strenuous in recent years, the good effect of\r\nwalking to and from the office or walking in the busy parts of the\r\ncity has been increased. Between the trolley and the automobile, and\r\nthe hustling commercial traffic of the streets, it is impossible for a\r\nman to walk through the busier portions of any large American city\r\nwithout keeping his wits thoroughly intent on what he is doing, nor\r\nwithout requiring all of his {206} attention for his transportation.\r\nAn abstracted man will in the course of a half hour have so many\r\nnarrow escapes from being run down in a busy quarter that he will\r\neither eschew walking in that particular neighborhood, or give up his\r\nhabits of mental abstraction, or else he will come to himself some day\r\nin a hospital.\r\n\r\nBesides, the passing show in city life is itself of surpassing\r\ninterest. It is not things but men that interest us most. There are so\r\nmany phases of human life to be seen on busy city streets, so many\r\nthings happen in the course of even a short walk to bring out\r\nprominently traits of human nature that, if a man is at all\r\nsympathetic, he finds much to occupy his attention, to distract him\r\nfrom his own worries and take him away from his business cares. The\r\nlong walk to and from the office may thus become an efficacious source\r\nof thoughts that are different and of profound pleasure. All depends\r\non the man and his mood. Men who try it whole-heartedly soon find a\r\nrenewed interest in life. An hour of daily walking in the open air\r\nwith the distractions of city life all around, provided the walking is\r\ndone briskly and faithfully, is of infinitely more hygienic value than\r\nan hour of gymnasium work. There is only one thing that hampers this\r\nform of exercise--there are so many excuses to tempt one not to keep\r\nit up. If one gets to a gymnasium there is an instructor or director\r\nwho keeps tabs on one's hours and so helps a weak human will, and\r\nexcuses are easier made to one's self than to others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMassage as Exercise.--This curious tendency of men to take their\r\nexercise far more regularly, provided some other is concerned in their\r\ntaking it so that it cannot be neglected without explanation, is\r\nillustrated in many of the experiences of the doctor in modern life. A\r\nnumber of forms of massage have come into vogue as wonderful\r\ncure-alls. It is comparatively easy for some men, and above all for\r\nmany women, to take their exercise by means of massage rather than in\r\nsome more vigorous way that requires their own initiative. A man who\r\nis working hard, and who feels the need of exercise, will not take the\r\neasy natural way of getting up half an hour earlier, having his\r\nbreakfast half an hour sooner and then walking down to his office four\r\nor five miles, but he hears of someone who gives vigorous massage and\r\nhe engages him to come every morning and exercise him for half an hour\r\nor an hour. In order to do so, he has to get up an hour earlier, but\r\nthe fact that he has the engagement with someone else, rather than\r\nwith himself, makes it more difficult for him to make excuses, and so\r\nmorning after morning, in spite of the fact that he may have been up\r\nlate the night before, perhaps to a big dinner, he gets up to be given\r\nhis exercise. If he is a heavy eater he will, of course, at the end of\r\na week or ten days feel ever so much better for he has been using up\r\nmaterial that was clogging his circulation and irritating his nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month he will probably feel so much better that he\r\nwill conclude that he has found the root of all evil in life, or of\r\nall disease, in a failure of circulation that can be removed by means\r\nof massage, manipulation and passive movements. When he gets well\r\nenough to give it up, he drops straight back into his old troubles,\r\nbecause what he needs is a radical change of life that will adapt his\r\neating to the amount of exercise that he takes, and his exercise to\r\nthe amount that he eats. If this fails to come, he has had only a\r\ntemporary benefit that has probably tempted him rather to increase\r\n{207} the amount that he eats normally than otherwise and will\r\nprobably do him harm in the end. This massage brings about a distinct\r\nreduction in the weight of women, and as most of them are very\r\ndesirous of this, the remedy becomes even more precious to them than\r\nto men. Here, too, however, it is only a temporary expedient. They are\r\ntempted to eat more than before, or at least not to reduce their diet,\r\nand the good that is accomplished is only for the moment, while no\r\nhabits, either of restraint of eating, or of more exercise in the open\r\nair which so many of them need, have been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive Movements.--The success of osteopathy has been largely founded\r\non this curious peculiarity of human nature. People are not satisfied\r\nto regulate their eating and exercise in a sensible way. They prefer\r\nto submit to various methods of exercise, manipulations and passive\r\nmovements which make up for the muscular exertion that should help the\r\ncirculation within the body, but do not accomplish the purpose nearly\r\nso well as the voluntary exercise of muscles. It requires little\r\nexercise of will to submit to this treatment, while for many people it\r\nrequires considerable exertion of will power to exercise their muscles\r\nfor themselves. The old particularly, who are likely to suffer from\r\nachy conditions around joints, always worse on rainy days, which would\r\nbe expelled by enough exercise to stimulate the circulation in these\r\nstructures, find the new remedial measures of vicarious exercise of\r\ngreat service to them and consequently osteopathy has gained many\r\nvotaries. Old members of many a state legislature who have been\r\naccustomed to ride for so long that exercise is almost an unknown\r\nquantity in their lives, are treated by the osteopath and lose so many\r\nvague pains and aches and discomforts of various kinds that it has not\r\nbeen difficult to persuade them that it is a great new discovery in\r\nmedicine, and so in many of the states the osteopaths have secured\r\nlegal recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary.--Exercise, as exercise, often does harm rather than good.\r\nThin people seldom need exercise, stout people seldom take enough of\r\nit. No one should be encouraged to exercise merely that he may be able\r\nto use up material that he has eaten, when it is evident that he is\r\neating more than is required for his ordinary occupation. The question\r\ncan never be settled without taking into consideration all these\r\nindividual peculiarities of each case. Properly used, exercise is one\r\nof the most important therapeutic aids. But it is liable to as many\r\nabuses as are drugs, and the patient's attitude of mind toward any\r\nparticular exercise is always an extremely important factor. If the\r\nexercise produces fatigue and disgust, then it will do no good, in\r\nspite of all that is hoped from it. If it creates true diversion of\r\nmind, it will surely be precious, even though it may, for other\r\nreasons, seem unsuitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOSITION\r\n\r\nThere are many changes of position that relieve pain, lessen\r\ndiscomfort, aid in excretion, and in the evacuation of material from\r\nthe body, yet it is often found that very little advantage is taken of\r\nthis natural method of therapeutic aid. Traditions and habit often\r\nrule to such an extent that {208} certain quite unfavorable positions\r\nare assumed, modifications of which frequently bring about distinct\r\namelioration of symptoms. Very often patients learn this alone. There\r\nare many mechanical principles that can be applied in the treatment of\r\npathological conditions which patients will not use unless definite\r\nsuggestions are made. Often the physician has to suggest that they\r\nshould try first one position and then another, in order to determine\r\nwhether a certain amount of relief may not be afforded by position\r\nalterations, and perhaps function encouraged, or at least certain\r\ninhibiting factors modified for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavoring Return Circulation.--For people who have to stand much during\r\nthe day, position in their resting hours is often extremely important.\r\nThe caricature of the old-time American exhibited him with his feet on\r\nthe mantlepiece, or somewhere as high as his head. For thin\r\nindividuals there is no doubt that the placing the feet about as high\r\nas the head often makes a very comfortable position for a time. To\r\nthose who have been standing much it is particularly restful. This may\r\nbe easily accomplished lying down, though it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the tendency to place the feet on a neighboring chair, or over\r\nthe arm of the chair, so often seen in young folks, is in response to\r\na physiological stimulus that brings relief to the heart by\r\nencouraging by means of gravity the return circulation in the veins\r\nfrom dependent portions of the body distant from the heart. For people\r\nwho have not much exercise, and who have to stand all day, a brisk\r\nwalk or leg exercises that thoroughly empty their muscles of blood by\r\nbringing about active contraction of them is important as a factor in\r\ntheir hours of rest. It makes all the difference in the world between\r\nthe feeling of intense tiredness due to the sluggish circulation, and\r\na return of vigor in the muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVaricose Veins.--For patients suffering from varicose veins, position\r\nis particularly important. When they have to stand much, their limbs\r\nget painfully tired. The ache in the sense of fatigue is reflected\r\nover the body with the resultant depression. Active exercise, for a\r\ntime, is not so good for them, and yet it is helpful. The ideal relief\r\nfrom their achy condition is afforded by gentle massage upwards of the\r\nlimbs. That empties the dilated veins of blood and restores vigor to\r\nthe circulation. It must not be forgotten, that when the circulation\r\nin the lower limbs is rendered sluggish by varicosity, the heart is\r\nalso affected because it is so much more difficult to secure the\r\nreturn of blood through the tortuous dilated veins. This accounts for\r\nthe intense general sense of fatigue that many of these patients have.\r\nVaricosities have a definite tendency to develop in those who are\r\noccupied in standing occupations, waiters, footmen, clerks, and the\r\nlike, and often they have to continue at these occupations in spite of\r\nthe varicose condition. It is particularly important for them to have\r\nan hour of lying down during the middle of the day so as to break\r\ntheir day's work in two. With a little insistence it can be secured in\r\na great many cases and will afford more relief to the patient than\r\nanything else that can be done, even the wearing of rubber stockings,\r\nbandages and the like. I have known waiters massage each other at the\r\ntime they had their period of rest with excellent results.\r\n\r\nFor the rupture of a varicose vein, position may be one of the most\r\nimportant auxiliaries to prevent serious hemorrhage. I remember as an\r\nambulance surgeon once being called to see a case in which a great\r\ndeal of blood {209} had been lost because efforts had been used to\r\nstop the bleeding by the application of a tourniquet. This shut off\r\nthe superficial arteries, but not the deep ones and effectually\r\nprevented the return of any venous blood into the trunk, while all the\r\ntime the ruptured varicose veins continued to bleed profusely. Local\r\napplications of styptics failed, of course, because the varicose vein\r\nitself had nearly the diameter of the little finger. Pressure over the\r\nwound did good for the time, but the bleeding was renewed whenever it\r\nwas let up, and the two physicians in charge, alarmed at the loss of\r\nblood, were beginning to lose their heads. The ambulance was summoned\r\nto take the patient to the hospital and when it was suggested that if\r\nthe tourniquet were removed and her foot was elevated the bleeding\r\nwould probably stop without more ado, the suggestion seemed too simple\r\nto be true, but the event showed that that was all that was necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelief for Flat Foot.--For the achy discomfort of flat-foot, which is\r\nusually felt much more in the calf and the knee than in the ankle,\r\nsome vigorous exercise for the foot, and especially for the calf\r\nmuscles, at times during the day is likely to give great relief. Ten\r\nminutes of vigorous movement of the calf muscles followed by half an\r\nhour lying down will save most of them from the intense tiredness that\r\nis very discouraging in the late afternoon in many of the standing\r\noccupations. This relief removes from patients' minds the common idea\r\nthat there must be something serious the matter with them. A good many\r\nof those who are cured of rheumatism by osteopathy, and of kidney\r\ntrouble by the advertising specialists, and of various nervous\r\ndiseases by new thought and irregular mental healing, are only\r\nsufferers from conditions such as can be relieved in this way. When\r\nflat-footed people sit down they should be advised to cross their feet\r\n(not their legs), because this emphasizes the arch of the foot\r\nsomewhat and helps to strengthen and preserve it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdominal Relaxation.--Many of the discomforts within the abdomen of\r\nwhich patients complain, especially whenever their attention is\r\nconcentrated on them, can be benefited by suggestions as to position.\r\nMany a man who feels very uncomfortable after a hearty meal when\r\nsitting curled up beneath a lamp to read the evening paper, does not\r\nnotice it at all when he stretches out on an easy Morris chair and\r\nwith head back talks to friends. Many a man who thinks that his\r\ndiscomfort after dinner must mean serious dyspepsia, finds that a game\r\nof billiards after dinner will often dissipate almost completely his\r\nill-feeling, unless, of course, it is due to overeating. After meals\r\ngenerally, positions that crowd the abdominal organs should be\r\navoided. It must not be forgotten either that when lying down a full\r\nstomach may very well interfere with the heart action and produce\r\nmarked palpitation. There are many men who cannot lie down within two\r\nhours of having eaten a hearty meal without decided heart\r\nirregularity, though while they are sitting up or standing quietly, or\r\neven moving, there will be no sign of this. Many of the vague\r\ndiscomforts within the abdomen, those due to movable kidney, or even\r\nchronic conditions in the biliary or urinary tracts, are only manifest\r\nwhen there is crowding of the organs within the abdomen.\r\n\r\nHow much the mechanical element may mean in kidney and biliary\r\nconditions is well illustrated by the relief often afforded by changes\r\nof position when calculi in these organs are giving trouble. Both\r\nrenal and biliary calculi, which perhaps have been lying quite\r\nharmlessly in their positions {210} for years, are especially likely\r\nto become productive of discomfort by a jolting ride, or the jar of a\r\nfall, or by the influence of changes of position produced by gymnastic\r\nefforts of an acrobatic kind, or by a loop-the-loop experience, or\r\nsomething of the kind. In spite of this, only rarely does the\r\nphysician try to use changes of position for their relief. I have seen\r\na man suffering from excruciating biliary colic get almost immediate\r\nrelief when put standing on his head alongside of a lounge. He looked\r\nupon it as magic. It was only that the stone, in the midst of the\r\nrelaxation of all abdominal muscles produced by the unusual position,\r\nwas able to drop back into the gall bladder, where it had been for\r\nmonths perhaps years before without giving any trouble. Similar relief\r\nis often afforded from the pain of kidney stones before they become\r\ndefinitely engaged in the ureter.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaising the Head.--Patients suffering from respiratory difficulties\r\nusually learn to accommodate themselves to such changes of position as\r\nwill afford them the greatest relief. The difficulty of breathing\r\nleads to such tossing about that the position easiest for the patient\r\nis almost inevitably found. When respiratory difficulties first\r\ndeclare themselves patients may not realize how much relief will be\r\nafforded by raising the head, or by the assumption of a sitting\r\nposition. Often such patients prefer to sit in a chair. It should be\r\nborne in mind that, wherever this is compulsory, dispositions can be\r\nmade so that the chair shall be as comfortable as possible, that its\r\nseat edge shall not press upon the underportion of the legs so as to\r\nimpede blood circulation, nor press upon nerves, and that comfortable\r\narrangements shall be made for the arms. When the patient's head has\r\nto be raised in the bed, it is much better to raise the mattress by\r\nplacing some large properly-shaped object underneath it, so as to\r\nsecure a gradual slant rather than have the patient's head and upper\r\nportion of the thorax bent by pillows. In default of something better,\r\na chair placed so that the mattress lies along its back will be a\r\nhandy aid. This is a matter of nursing rather than strictly of medical\r\nattendance, but unless the physician pays attention to it, it will be\r\nneglected, or at least in many cases not used to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nWhenever there is difficulty of expectoration, especially when\r\nexpectoration is abundant as in certain of the chronic bronchitises,\r\nand above all in dilatation of the bronchi, the advantage of position\r\nshould be taken to aid in the expectoration. Patients who have to\r\ncough up large amounts in dilatation of the bronchi and who have long\r\nsevere fits of coughing in the early morning, will often obtain a\r\ngreat measure of relief by leaning out of bed with one hand on the\r\nfloor, doing their coughing in that position. Gravity helps in the\r\nemptying of the pockets of the bronchi and in five minutes they\r\nsucceed in getting up satisfactorily as much material as would come\r\nup, only after severe convulsive efforts for an hour, when gravity was\r\nin opposition to their efforts. Children in whooping cough naturally\r\nbend over in order to cough. They will cough easiest if placed on a\r\nbed with a pillow beneath their chest so as to lift the face from the\r\nmattress, or in the case of older children, with the head projecting\r\nbeyond the edge of the bed. This is only a trifle, but it will often\r\nsave children severe convulsive efforts. Tuberculous patients who have\r\nto cough much, should be encouraged to find for themselves by trial\r\nwhether certain positions, leaning out of bed, may not be of great\r\nservice to them. There is often in advanced cases an accumulation of\r\nmaterial during {211} the night that must be expectorated, and the\r\npatients are severely shaken up by their efforts to bring it up. I\r\nhave known cases where a considerable measure of relief was afforded\r\nby leaning out of bed with the elbow on a pillow, a chair or\r\nfoot-stool somewhat lower than the level of the bed. The mechanical\r\nhelp of gravity is particularly important where cavities exist and a\r\nconsiderable amount of material has to be emptied out of them.\r\n\r\nIn modern surgical times one does not often see the emptying of a\r\npurulent pleurisy through the bronchi, but I once had an opportunity\r\nto see the termination of one of these cases in a very favorable way.\r\nWhen I saw her the patient had already coughed up a cup full of\r\npurulent fluid and, altogether, about a quart of pus was thus\r\nevacuated. The patient had been so ill that the effort was\r\nconsiderable, but the evacuation was greatly helped by having her lean\r\nout of bed whenever material was to be expectorated. The patient is\r\nstill alive and in good health--fifteen years after the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart Cases.--Position is also often of very great importance for the\r\nrelief of the symptoms of patients suffering from heart affections.\r\nFor organic heart affections, rest in bed is often advised. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that this does not necessarily mean in a recumbent\r\nposition. Whenever there is difficulty of breathing in connection with\r\nan affection of the heart, the recumbent position is extremely\r\nuncomfortable. This is nature's safeguard against the accumulation of\r\nfluid in the dependent parts of the lungs at the terminal capillaries\r\nof the pulmonary circulation. Most of the natural demands have a\r\ndefinite reason and are prophylactic rather than merely a symptom of\r\naimless discomfort. Patients with heart disease often want to sit up\r\nin a chair. Their wish should, as a rule, be yielded to. There is no\r\nneed of their sitting in a narrow uncomfortable armchair, nor of being\r\nincommoded by the position they have to assume. The end of a large\r\nlounge, especially one that curves over towards the floor on which\r\npillows can be piled so as to make the patient comfortable, and yet\r\nafford many changes of position, is the best.\r\n\r\nIn general, the arrangements should be such that changes of position\r\ncan be secured without much difficulty. These prevent hypostatic\r\npneumonia and guard the patient against serious accumulations in the\r\nlung tissue because of sluggish circulation. Changes of position can\r\nbe used as valuable suggestions. Often the main portion of the\r\npatient's symptoms consists of the intense fatigue due to one\r\nposition. This can be relieved and the patient made to feel that,\r\nafter all, the ailment to which he is suffering must not be so serious\r\nsince relief can be afforded so simply. Besides, when patients\r\ncomplain, something must be done for them. Medicine cannot be given\r\nfor every symptom and yet some remedial measure there must be to\r\nsatisfy them. This satisfaction will often be secured by changes of\r\nposition, by slight local treatment, by the adjustment of pillows so\r\nas to relieve fatigue of particular muscles and parts of the body, and\r\nby the movements of the limbs and the head into other positions than\r\nthose in which they have become fatigued. The experienced nurse is of\r\nthe greatest possible value in these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestlessness.--Usually restlessness is considered to be an unfavorable\r\nsymptom of disease, just as are pain and tenderness. Like these,\r\nhowever, it is really conservative rather than in any sense\r\ndestructive. Pain prevents serious changes from taking place without\r\nour attention being effectively {212} called to them. Restlessness\r\ninduces the patient to change position frequently and often leads to\r\nthe discovery of some position in which there is much more comfort\r\nthan the one that had been assumed. Restlessness, in the recumbent\r\nposition, is usually nature's protest against the maintenance of a\r\nposture in which, owing to failure of circulation, there may be\r\nleakage of serum into the lung tissues with dangerous results.\r\nRestlessness, in abdominal pain, often leads to such a change of\r\nposition as affords the best condition for the relief of the\r\ndiscomfort as far as that may be brought about by position of muscles.\r\nThe man with colic very soon discovers that lying on his stomach may\r\nrelieve his pain. The drawing up of the knees in peritoneal conditions\r\nis the result of a similar reaction. The physician must learn to\r\nimitate nature, and recognize what mechanical conditions are likely to\r\nbe of help. As soon as these afford relief, they act as a strong\r\nfavorable suggestion, on the patient, and relieve dreads with regard\r\nto his affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoint Affections.--In painful joint conditions, position may help much\r\nto bring relief or at least considerable mitigation of symptoms. In\r\nrheumatism, for instance, of the acute articular type, a number of\r\nsmall pillows can be disposed in various ways, underneath the\r\npatient's limbs, between them and in other positions, so as to give as\r\nmuch comfort as possible and will often be of great value. There\r\nshould be at least half a dozen pillows at the disposal of the\r\npatient, besides three or four for the head. In certain relaxed\r\npositions of the joints, there is more room within the capsule than\r\nothers and, almost unconsciously, the patients assume such positions\r\nwhen there is pain from effusion. Occasionally, however, in the midst\r\nof fever, or because of apathy, patients may not do this, and then\r\ncare should be taken to bring them some measure of relief. Generally\r\npatients suffering from fever, with delirium of typhoid condition,\r\nthat is, when there is considerable apathy, should have their\r\npositions changed gently from time to time to prevent discomfort\r\ndeveloping, and as a prophylactic against skin disturbances from\r\npressure. In children, this is particularly important.\r\n\r\n\r\nBladder Evacuation.--In emptying the bladder position may mean much.\r\nAfter childbirth, especially the first, many women are quite unable to\r\nempty their bladders while lying down, though if they are allowed to\r\nassume the usual position there is little or no difficulty. In certain\r\nsensitive men whose power over their bladder is disturbed by\r\nself-consciousness, the presence of anyone in the room or near them,\r\nmakes it impossible for them to urinate, and this is particularly true\r\nif they are lying down. In the milder forms of prostatism position\r\noccasionally seems to have some influence in helping to empty the\r\nbladder. When there is a prostatic bladder pouch behind the prostate,\r\nit is quite impossible to empty this in the standing position. It may\r\nbe emptied in the prone position, that is, lying face downwards,\r\nparticularly if the pelvis is elevated above the rest of the trunk.\r\nUndoubtedly some of the cures reported after operation, when the\r\noperation itself effected no reduction in the size of the prostate (as\r\nthe removal of the testicles or vasectomy), the improvement was\r\nbrought about partly by the more favorable position in which, for\r\nweeks after the operation, the patient emptied his bladder, and also\r\nby the greater control gained over it, by the persuasion that the\r\noperation would do him good. The same suggestion can be made in\r\nconnection with the new position for urination with just as good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\nIntra-abdominal Conditions.--There are many intra-abdominal conditions\r\nin which position is of great importance for the relief of pain.\r\nAppendicitis cases are found with the right knee drawn up because this\r\nrelieves the tension of the abdominal muscles, and probably also of\r\nthe large muscles that go to the thigh and lie behind the peritoneal\r\ncavity. In most cases of intra-abdominal pain flexing of the knees on\r\nthe abdomen means much in affording relief, and patients usually\r\ndiscover this for themselves. There are certain apathetic patients,\r\nhowever, who need to be helped by suggestions. In certain of the\r\npainful conditions, due to intra-pelvic conditions, relaxation of\r\nmuscles by flexion lessens the pain. Pressure upon the abdomen, as by\r\nlying on a pillow, often does this also. Apparently one reason why\r\nchildren with flatulent colic stop crying almost at once, when laid on\r\ntheir stomachs, is because the pressure thus produced tends to bring\r\nabout a movement of the gas that, collected at one or two places, was\r\ncausing painful distention.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportance to the Physician.--There are many other suggestions with\r\nregard to position that will occur to thoughtful physicians in\r\nparticular cases. The one idea is to secure such an alteration of the\r\nposture as is likely to bring about mechanically relief of pain. If\r\nrelief is afforded in this way, as has already been emphasized, a very\r\nfavorable influence is produced on the patient's mind. Above all, he\r\nrealizes that his physician not only understands his general\r\ncondition, but his experience with many patients suffering from the\r\nsame ailment has given him the power to direct even such slight\r\nchanges of position as will give comfort. Nothing that I know adds\r\nmore to the confidence that a patient has in his physician than the\r\nrealization of this sort of knowledge. Therefore, the necessity for\r\nsuch consideration of each individual case as will enable the\r\nphysician to recommend such modifications of position to patients. At\r\nthe same time the patient's mind can be influenced very favorably by\r\nattaching definite significance to these alterations, and having them,\r\nas it were, repeat their favorable suggestions every time that he\r\nthinks about them, and be pleased as to the relief they have afforded.\r\nThis is the sort of psychotherapy that is particularly likely to be\r\nsuccessful, and it needs careful cultivation and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nOne of the most important factors for therapeusis in the sense of the\r\namelioration of defective motor conditions, the relief of disturbing\r\nsensory affections and the restoration of or compensation for\r\ndefective functions of various kinds is training. By this is meant the\r\ntraining of the power of attention and its concentration in such a way\r\nthat defects are overcome. There are many examples of almost marvelous\r\nimprovement of function brought about in this way that are familiar,\r\nbut it is well to recall some of them here in order to illustrate the\r\nuses to which this therapeutic mode may be applied. A blind man is\r\nable to read by means of his finger tips, and to recognize raised\r\nletters that seem quite beyond the possibility of tactile recognition\r\nby {214} ordinary individuals gifted with all their senses. The\r\npeculiar skill is simply due to the individual being able by\r\nconcentration of attention upon slight variations in touch sensation\r\nto recognize even minute differences readily and so read raised\r\nletters with comparative ease and rapidity.\r\n\r\nOver and over again it has been shown that neither the congenitally\r\nblind nor those whose vision has become defective have any better\r\nsense of touch than the average person. With an esthesiometer, their\r\npower to recognize the distance between the points of a calipers is\r\nshown to be no better than that of an ordinarily sensitive individual.\r\nThis is illustrated in other ways. Certain blind persons, even those\r\nborn blind, are known to be able to distinguish colors more or less\r\naccurately, that is, at least the three primary colors. Their power to\r\ndo this is consequent upon a faculty of recognizing differences in\r\nheat absorption. The ordinary seeing person going into a room in the\r\ndark recognizes at once the difference between a pencil and a piece of\r\nmetal of the same shape and size by its weight and the greater\r\ntendency of the metal to feel colder. When we are not sure whether a\r\npillar in a structure is of stone or an imitation, we determine this\r\nby touch, and the fact that stone absorbs heat rapidly while wood and\r\nother imitations of stone do not. It is the same faculty for\r\ndistinguishing specific heat that enables certain blind people to\r\nrecognize colors. If pieces of cloth of different colors are put over\r\nsnow when the sun is shining on them, it will be found that black\r\nabsorbs much more heat than the colored cloths, or white, and\r\nconsequently that the snow melts faster beneath the black. After black\r\ncomes red, then green, then blue. It is this difference in the power\r\nto absorb heat that the blind recognize and thus distinguish colors\r\nafter long patient training of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nObstacle Sense.--An example of the value of training is the so-called\r\nobstacle sense which has been rather carefully studied in recent\r\nyears. By means of it blind people are able to avoid larger obstacles\r\nand to know when they are passing an open door or window on a corridor\r\nor a building alongside a street. Blind children have been known to\r\nplay in a garden where there were trees and other obstacles and\r\ncarefully avoid them even while moving rather rapidly. This sense is\r\ndisturbed whenever there is loud noise in the vicinity. It is not very\r\nactive and yet it is of considerable value to the blind. Its\r\ndisturbance by noise would seem to indicate that it is due to some\r\nsense faculty in the tympanum, or ear drum. It exists in everybody,\r\nbut remains quite undeveloped except in those who need it and\r\ntherefore learn to make use of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouch and Sight.--The triumph of training is to be seen in the cases\r\nof those who are born blind and deaf and who yet are taught to\r\nunderstand through lip and throat reading by the tips of the fingers\r\nand taught to talk by being shown patiently the method by which others\r\naccomplish it, though the only avenue to their brain is the dull sense\r\nof touch which means so little for the ordinary individual. The cases\r\nof Laura Bridgeman and of Helen Keller illustrate how a sense that is\r\nusually quite neglected can be made to supply the place of both the\r\neyes and the ears by patient, persistent training. Lip reading by\r\nsight is, of course, a very interesting example of the same principle\r\nthat can be learned by anyone who has good sight in a comparatively\r\nshort time. There are compensations of this kind and powers of\r\ndevelopment latent in every sense and function of the body that can be\r\n{215} employed to make life interesting and to restore usefulness\r\nafter nearly every form of lesion or defect. Practically all of this\r\ncompensatory power is mental, hence its place in psychotherapy. We do\r\nnot increase the power of the sense but by concentration of attention\r\nthe mind is rendered capable of obtaining definite information from\r\nsensory stimuli that are present in every person but that are\r\nordinarily neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing.--One of the most surprising instances of the value of\r\ntraining for cases in which favorable results seemed quite out of the\r\nquestion, is Urbantschitsch's method of training the deaf to hear.\r\nAfter investigating it personally I reported it in the _International\r\nClinics_.   [Footnote 24] Patients who could hear but very little,\r\nindeed, only the loudest noises, were trained by means of loud\r\nshouting and the hearing of loud notes gradually to catch sounds more\r\nand more easily until not infrequently they could hear rather well.\r\nSometimes even those who were thought to be absolutely deaf to sound\r\nwere found to be able to hear very loud sounds and then it was\r\ninvariably discovered that by practice they could be made to hear much\r\nmore. The secret of the success consisted not in any increase in the\r\npower to hear, but entirely in training the attention to recognize and\r\ndifferentiate sounds so that what seemed at first a confused murmur\r\ngradually became intelligible. It is exactly the same process as that\r\nby which a man learns to read with his fingers. He is not able to\r\ndifferentiate the letters but after a time it is possible to do so\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 24: Lippincott & Co., Phila., Vol. IV, 8th series, 1899.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEquilibrium.--There are typical examples of almost as striking\r\nincrease of muscle sensation, or rather of ability to distinguish\r\nminute differences in muscular sensation, noted in those who train\r\nthis faculty carefully. Acrobats succeed in developing wonderful\r\ncontrol over muscles and marvelous response to slight disturbance of\r\nequilibrium. The ordinary individual has comparatively small balancing\r\npowers, but the slack-rope performer seems almost to defy the laws of\r\ngravity, because he has learned so to coordinate all muscular action\r\nas to enable him to maintain his balance. He has trained himself to\r\ndistinguish every variety of message from his semicircular canals. Of\r\nitself neither of these senses gives us very much information, indeed,\r\nonly as much as we ask for from it, but when we pay careful attention\r\nto the minute details of the information that it imparts, we are able\r\nto use it to great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscle Training.--It is this power of training to enable us to\r\nappreciate minute sensations that forms the basis of the Frenkel\r\ntreatment of tabes. For the proper guidance of the muscles the\r\nmuscular sense is all-important, though ordinarily we are quite\r\nunconscious of the information it conveys. This is seriously disturbed\r\nby the degeneration in tabes. The patient can, however, be taught to\r\nuse even the slight amount of it that remains to great advantage or\r\nelse to avail himself of some other compensatory sensations which will\r\nenable him to guide his muscles in various motions much better than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis same faculty can probably be employed in many other conditions.\r\nFrenkel has shown that it is applicable in paralysis agitans and\r\nmarkedly relieves the rigidity that is so annoying a symptom. It gives\r\nthese patients something to occupy their minds, too, which means a\r\ngreat deal for their {216} general condition, for occupation of\r\nattention saves them from neurotic disturbance of themselves.\r\n\r\nSufferers from infantile paralysis can be taught to do many things\r\nwith their weakened muscles that seem to be quite impossible to them.\r\nIt requires patience to get results, but they mean so much that the\r\nefforts are well worth while. After cerebral incidents, sometimes\r\nactual apoplexies, sometimes injuries, occasionally serious effusions\r\ndue to kidney diseases, there may be disturbance of motor functions.\r\nIt is surprising how often training will enable the sufferer to use\r\nhis muscles much better in these cases than at first seemed possible.\r\nI have seen a man who had lost most of his power for writing after a\r\ncerebral incident regain it as a consequence of being taught to write\r\nfrom his shoulder, instead of from the forearm as had been his custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart Training.--In recent years we have learned that training is not\r\nonly good for the external muscles and enables them to do more work\r\nwithout discomfort, but that it is particularly beneficial to the\r\nheart muscle whenever that organ can respond to it favorably. At all\r\nof the heart cures in recent years, exercise of some kind or another\r\nis one of the important features and the failure of physicians\r\ngenerally to secure as good results while pursuing all the other\r\nmethods followed at these cures, seems to show that exercise was\r\nprobably the most important factor. Nauheim is the typical heart cure\r\nand there, besides the resisted movements in the bath, there is the\r\ngraduated exercise of the walks around the town, all of which, owing\r\nto the situation, lead up hill. Walking up hill, even though it be a\r\ngradual ascent, might seem to be the worst possible exercise for heart\r\npatients, yet it proves eminently beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespiratory Training.--Shortness of breath is often a bothersome\r\nsymptom, especially for stout people, and prevents them from taking\r\nnecessary exercise. When it cannot be traced directly to some\r\naffection of the heart or of the circulatory apparatus, it is usually\r\ndue to lack of exercise. Much can be done for it by deliberate\r\ntraining. In the modern time, with elevators so common, people seldom\r\nhave to walk up-stairs, and consequently one of the modes of exercise\r\nthat was particularly likely to furnish some training in deep\r\nbreathing is absent. Any one who has seen the shallow breathing of\r\nmany of the patients who come to Nauheim and how much it has improved\r\nby the gradually increased walks up the hills around the valley, will\r\nappreciate how much training in deep breathing means. This exercise of\r\nthe diaphragm will often give benefit besides in making the bowels\r\nmore regular, and in getting rid of the accumulation of fat in the\r\nabdomen, which is one of the mechanical causes of the interference\r\nwith the diaphragm and consequent shortness of breath.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining the Appetite.--Just as training may be used for the sensory\r\nand motor systems that are external, so it may also be used for many\r\ninternal functions analogous to these. There are a great many people\r\nwho eat too little. They are the nervous, irritable persons with no\r\nfund of reserve energy to draw on when anything happens, and who are\r\nin their years before middle life likely to be the victims of\r\ninfectious disease. They suffer much from lack of proper covering in\r\nthe winter time and from a certain protection that is afforded to the\r\nnervous system generally by being up to weight. Often their\r\nunder-weight is a life-story, and occasionally it is a family matter.\r\nWhen {217} they suffer from neurotic symptoms a gain in weight nearly\r\nalways does them good. They complain that when they increase their\r\ndiet they have uncomfortable feelings. This is only what is to be\r\nexpected, since the muscularis of their stomach--much more important\r\nthan its secretory function--has not been accustomed to as much\r\nexercise as is now being demanded of it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for those who are over-weight, training in eating\r\nless is the one important therapeutic factor. If their diet is cut\r\ndown suddenly, they soon become discouraged. If there is a gradual\r\nreduction of food quantities, variety being allowed, so that they may\r\neat practically everything they have been eating before, the system\r\ngradually accommodates itself to less and less food. This is the only\r\nsensible way of bringing about reduction in weight. It requires\r\nconstant attention over a long period, but it can be done with\r\nexcellent success.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the bowels may be trained to perform their work\r\nregularly. Habit means probably more with them than any other factor.\r\nOur digestive tract, however, is largely dependent on habit. We get\r\nhungry three times a day or twice a day, according to the custom that\r\nwe have established. Countries differ radically in the matter, and\r\nnearly always, when a man goes from one country to another in early\r\nyears, he changes to the habits of the new country, though if he comes\r\nafter middle age he usually clings to those that he is used to.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining to Stand Pain.--There are many painful conditions, especially\r\ninvolving the muscles in the neighborhood of joints, that are worse on\r\nrainy days and are spoken of as rheumatism, that can be very much\r\nimproved by training in the use of muscles. As men grow older and gain\r\nin weight, the lack of exercise in their sedentary lives incapacitates\r\ntheir muscles for activities of many kinds. The consequence is that\r\nwhere most strain is put upon them, in the neighborhood of joints,\r\nthey readily become tender and painful. It is this class of cases\r\nparticularly that is benefited by irregular practitioners of all\r\nkinds. Mental healing, osteopathy, Eddyism, the many liniments,\r\nrubbings and manipulations prove beneficial. What is needed is\r\ntraining in the use of muscles so as to enable them to do the work\r\nthat is required of them without discomforting reaction. This is\r\nparticularly true for the leg and foot muscles. Exercises that\r\nstrengthen the muscles of the calf and of the thigh, and particularly\r\nsuch as require free movement of the foot, are almost sure to relieve\r\nthese patients of many annoying symptoms. Pains around the ankles and\r\nin the knee and hip, worse in rainy weather, disappear as a\r\nconsequence of such gradually increased use of these muscles as gives\r\nthem increased nutrition and power. This subject is discussed more\r\nfully under Foot Troubles and Painful Conditions of the Knee.\r\n\r\nThere may be a training in bearing discomfort which is of great value\r\nto over-sensitive patients. Some nervous patients seem to suffer\r\nmerely from their ordinary physiological functions. These are the\r\npatients who abuse the drugs that are supposed to bring relief. There\r\nis just one mode of treatment that is successful with them: they must\r\nbe told to bear their discomfort for a while without seeking drug\r\nrelief, but always securing freedom from discomfort by means of\r\nattention to other things, until gradually they have succeeded in\r\ndiverting their minds from the concentration of attention on their\r\nfunctions which is causing their disturbance. The whole programme\r\n{218} need not be outlined to them or they will perhaps have a\r\nrevulsion of feeling against it that will make its accomplishment\r\nimpossible. They can, however, be made to stand their discomforts for\r\na time with the promise that it is for the best, since there will be\r\neventually an improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Faculties.--Nearly every one of our faculties can be\r\ntrained to do much better work than we have any idea of if we only are\r\nwilling to take the trouble and give the attention. I have often shown\r\npeople who came complaining of loss of memory that if they wanted to\r\ntrain themselves to remember they could do so. The memory probably\r\ncannot be bettered any more than can the sense of touch in the blind\r\nman, but by attention to minute details, in the concentration of the\r\nmind on certain subjects, it can accomplish results that seemed quite\r\nimpossible before. All systems of improving the memory are founded on\r\nthis method of concentrating attention on what one wishes to remember\r\nand connecting it with other things that we know by experience are\r\nreadily remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo classes of patients frequently apply to physicians for relief from\r\nvarious discomforts. They are, first, people who have no regular\r\noccupation and who often are in what is supposed to be the happy\r\nposition of being able to do just what they please. The second class\r\nconsists of those who take their occupations too seriously, so that\r\nthey never get away from them and, as a consequence, disturb their\r\nphysical functions. The feelings that these two classes complain\r\nof--for, when analyzed, their symptoms prove really to be\r\nuncomfortable feelings--can usually be \"bothered\" away and, if not\r\nentirely forgotten, made to disappear when the patients become deeply\r\ninterested in something other than their usual occupation. The first\r\nclass of patients needs occupation of mind; the second needs diversion\r\nof mind, and that subject will be taken up in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncomfortable Sensations, Their Location and Causes.--These pains and\r\naches, as patients call them, though it is well to remember that they\r\nare only discomforts, senses of unequal pressure, of constriction, or\r\nperhaps only unusual feelings, or consciousness of sensation, may\r\noccur in every part of the body. Perhaps they are most commonly\r\ncomplained of in the head. Many of the so-called headaches that are\r\nmore or less continuous consist of these senses of pressure or of\r\nconstriction over a particular part of the skull. Sometimes there may\r\nbe a sense of pressure at the back of the eyes. Very often there is a\r\nfeeling of heaviness at the back of the head that makes the patient\r\nfeel as if relief would come if the head were allowed to drop forward\r\nand if sleep could be thus obtained. Every other portion of the head,\r\nhowever, even within the cavities, may have some of these\r\nuncomfortable sensations. In some persons, there is a tightness in the\r\nthroat. In others, there is a feeling of fullness of one cheek and the\r\ndread that they may not be able to use it properly in talking.\r\nSometimes the uncomfortable feeling is within the nose. Not\r\ninfrequently the discomfort is in the ear.\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\nAll of these may be due to local conditions which need to be\r\ncorrected, but in most cases nothing is found locally, or at most\r\nthere is some functional disturbance so slight that, though it is\r\nshared by a great many people in our climate, others do not complain\r\nof it at all. It seems evident, therefore, that the discomfort must\r\nresult from the sensitiveness of the individual emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of some slight disturbance.\r\n\r\nEvery portion of the body may suffer from these discomforts. The upper\r\npart of the back, especially below the base of the neck, is a favorite\r\nlocation in men, and particularly in those who bend over a desk. The\r\nlower part of the back is affected in such men as tailors and cutters\r\nwho stoop incessantly at their work. In women, the lower part of the\r\nback is likely to suffer, and this is usually attributed to genital\r\nconditions, but constipation may play quite as large a role as the\r\ngenital organs. Some of the stooping occupations of women, at the\r\nsewing machine or dressmaking, or even harder occupations, as\r\nsweeping, washing, and the like, may also be responsible. The\r\ncommonest source of discomfort is, perhaps, the upper left-hand\r\nquadrant of the abdomen. This seems to be due to the distention of the\r\nstomach, either by gas or by liquid. Vague discomforts may occur\r\naround the umbilicus, often due to the presence of gas, with or\r\nwithout borborygmi.\r\n\r\nGenerally the local condition is only an occasion, and the real cause\r\nof the complaint is the lack of occupation of mind and consequent\r\nconcentration of attention on any organ whose function happens to be\r\ndisturbed sufficiently to make one conscious of its action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lack of Occupation_.--For all of these cases the most important\r\ntherapeutic factor is occupation of mind and diversion of attention.\r\nIn our time, social conditions allow a large number of people to have\r\nvery little occupation. For instance, many women of the well-to-do\r\nclasses have absolutely nothing that they must do. Various phases of\r\nthis are discussed in previous sections.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is useless to try to relieve these discomforts by\r\nanodynes. Many an opium habit has been formed by a turning to opium in\r\nsuch cases. The coal tar products are greatly abused here, for they do\r\nnot bring relief to queer feelings nor to a sense of pressure or\r\ndiscomfort; they rather add to depression. What they are efficacious\r\nfor is acute pain. The coal tar products relieve even toothache or\r\nneuralgia, as well as a real headache, but I have had patients tell me\r\nover and over again that the continuous headaches from which they\r\nsuffered were not relieved in the slightest degree by phenacetin or\r\nacetanilid. Occasionally one hears of hyoscine or hyoscyamus suggested\r\nfor these conditions, but they are quite as useless and as much\r\ncontraindicated as opium or the coal tar products. As a rule, these\r\nheadaches are relieved by lying down; they disappear during sleep. The\r\nreal indication for treatment, however, is found in the fact that all\r\nof these vague discomforts are much better or even disappear when the\r\npatient is intensely occupied, or at least pleasurably engaged.\r\n\r\nWhat these people need is occupation that really catches their\r\ninterest and takes attention from themselves. One of the most striking\r\nexpressions of this truth that we have comes from the poor, sad, mad\r\npoet, Cowper:\r\n\r\n  Absence of occupation is not rest;\r\n  A mind quite vacant is a mind distressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n{220}\r\n\r\nAnd surely poor Cowper, himself the victim of depression, saved from\r\nhimself only by the suggestion that he should put into poetic form the\r\nthoughts that came so abundantly to him, could well understand the\r\ndepth of wisdom in his couplet. The story of Cowper's life is enough\r\nof itself to encourage physician and patient to persevere in the\r\neffort to lift depression by occupation, since the fruits of that\r\noccupation may prove so valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Short-Circuit_.--The minds of these people must do something,\r\nand since there is nothing really occupying for them to do, in a very\r\nexpressive modern phrase, they are doing their possessors. As we\r\nsuggest elsewhere, the nearest simile is that of the short-circuiting\r\nof a dynamo. Mental energy is exerted harmfully within the machine\r\ninstead of in doing work.\r\n\r\nSee what happens in these cases when by some chance the women, or the\r\nmen, who complain almost constantly are suddenly deprived of the means\r\nwhich enabled them to live an aimless life. The physician often has\r\npatients who have been in affluence but after a financial panic are in\r\nstraitened circumstances. It is interesting to note what an excellent\r\ntonic effect, in younger people always, in older people very often,\r\nthe change of life has on these chronic valetudinarians. Sometimes\r\nthis is attributed to the simpler life which they lead when poorer,\r\noccasionally to the lack of responsibility, or other similar reason.\r\nNearly always it is easy to see that the real cause of the improvement\r\nin health is the occupation of mind with serious interests outside of\r\nself.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation of Life.--In the matter of occupation, and especially\r\noccupation of mind, the formation of habits and the training of the\r\nwill are extremely important. In his book on \"The Education of the\r\nWill,\" which was so popular that it went through over thirty editions\r\nin France, M. Jules Payot [Footnote 25] emphasizes the necessity for\r\ndeliberately arranging the details of life so that time shall not hang\r\nheavily on the hands, he reverts to certain rules of life of the old\r\nreligious orders, and to the habits advised by spiritual directors. He\r\ncounsels that every one should make an examination of the day's\r\nhappenings at the end of it, in order to see just where the failures\r\nlay and in what accomplishment was made. At the end of this\r\nold-fashioned examination of conscience, he counsels that a set of\r\nresolutions for the next day be made and an arrangement of work for\r\nvarious times, so that even more may be accomplished.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 25: English translation by Dr. Smith Ely Jelliffe.\r\n  New York, 1909.]\r\n\r\nM. Payot further suggests that a certain time be given up to\r\nreflection, or as he calls it, meditation, on the significance of life\r\nand on the consideration whether something valuable is being made of\r\nit. Without this he insists that it is easy to let one's self slip\r\ninto habits of life in which absolutely nothing is accomplished for\r\nself or others. If there is no real accomplishment, then pleasure soon\r\npalls, because pleasure has a place only as an interval in the midst\r\nof labor and as a relief from effort. These reversions to the old\r\nmodes of life and thought of the monastic communities show how little\r\nof real advance there is in life, and what excellent conclusions\r\nserious men came to even in the distant past. Certainly for many of\r\nthe leisure class in modern times only the use of periods of\r\nreflection and the examination of {221} results obtained will serve to\r\nprevent that utter waste of time which leads to the intense\r\ndissatisfaction that is often reflected in the general health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThought for Others.--After forgetfulness of self, the most important\r\nfactor in psychotherapeutics is thoughtfulness for others. Ordinary\r\ndiversions are quite insufficient to occupy most people. One must have\r\na serious occupation that appeals deeply, and then diversions of mind\r\nwill be useful for purposes of recreation. Pleasure, so-called, if\r\npursued not as an interruption from work but for its own sake and\r\nwithout serious occupation, palls, and after a time its votaries find\r\nlife is scarcely worth living. The pursuit of pleasure as the sole\r\ninterest of life is one of the most fruitful resources of depression,\r\ndiscouragement and neurotic symptoms with which modern physicians are\r\nbrought in contact. The only way to be sure of having compelling\r\ninterests is to be so much occupied with other people that one forgets\r\nself.\r\n\r\n  Yet mere flippant excitement and superficial entertainment is\r\n  nothing but a cheap counterfeit of what is needed. Voluntary effort\r\n  is needed, and this is the field where the psychotherapist must put\r\n  in his most intelligent effort. There is no one for whom there is\r\n  not a chance for work in our social fabric. The prescription of work\r\n  has not only to be adjusted to the abilities, the knowledge, and\r\n  social conditions, but has to be chosen in such a way that it is\r\n  full of associations and ultimately of joyful emotions. Useless work\r\n  can never confer the greatest benefits; mere physical exercises are\r\n  therefore psychophysically not as valuable as real sport, while\r\n  physically, of course, the regulated exercises may be far superior\r\n  to the haphazard work in sport. To solve picture puzzles, even if\r\n  they absorb the attention for a week, can never have the same effect\r\n  as a real interest in a human puzzle. There is a chance for social\r\n  work for every woman and every man, work which can well be chosen in\r\n  full adjustment to the personal preference and likings. Not\r\n  everybody is fit for charity work, and those who are may be entirely\r\n  unfitted for work in the interest of the beautification of the town.\r\n  Only it has to be work; mere automobiling to charity places or\r\n  talking in meetings on problems which have not been studied will, of\r\n  course, be merely another form of the disorganizing superficiality.\r\n  The hysterical lady on Fifth Avenue and the psychasthenic old maid\r\n  in the New England country town both simply have to learn to do\r\n  useful work with a concentrated effort and a high purpose. From a\r\n  long experience I have to confess that I have seen that this\r\n  unsentimental remedy is the safest and most important prescription\r\n  in the prescription book of the psychotherapist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Children_.--Probably the most important therapeutic factor in\r\nthe cure of the ills which come to unoccupied women is the finding of\r\nsome occupation that will absorb their hearts as well as their\r\nintellects, that is, satisfy their feelings as well as appeal to their\r\nintelligence. That very acute observer and kenner of her sex, Mrs. St.\r\nLeger Harrison, who is Charles Kingsley's daughter and writes under\r\nthe pseudonym of \"Lucas Malet,\" said in \"Sir Richard Calmady\": \"Feed\r\ntheir hearts and the rest of the mechanism runs easy. I have known\r\ndisease to develop in a perfectly healthy woman simply because the\r\nheart was starved.\" For most women the only thing that will entirely\r\nsatisfy the heart or keep it from hunger is children. Fortunately an\r\ninterest in other people's children can, under certain circumstances,\r\nbe almost as satisfying as in one's own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interest in Others_.--Probably the best possible occupation that a\r\nchildless woman can have is the care of others. Charity in one form or\r\nanother satisfies the emotions as well as creates interest and gives\r\nvaried occupations. Even the frequent disillusions that are\r\nencountered in charity work only add variety {222} to the experience,\r\nand do not discourage those who have the real charity instinct. For\r\nwomen particularly, as we have said, some charity that brings them\r\nmuch in contact with children is the surest preventive of\r\nover-occupation with themselves and over-emphasis on their feelings\r\nand sufferings. Many a woman in our large cities owes her freedom from\r\nthe neurotic symptoms to which her sisters are subject, to her\r\ninterest in tuberculous children. There is just enough of suffering to\r\narouse all the pity of the visitor, without so much of anguish as\r\nwould deter the more delicate from being interested in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Touch with Real Suffering_,--For patients who think they have much to\r\nsuffer, yet whose complaints are all of subjective feelings of\r\noppression and depression, there is no better remedy than to come in\r\ntouch with real suffering. I have known not a few neurotic young\r\nwomen, who were preparing for themselves years of suffering by\r\nover-attention to little pains and aches, saved to a life of\r\nusefulness and even happiness by having to nurse near relatives\r\nthrough the last stages of fatal cancer. When these neurotic persons\r\nare brought intimately in touch with real suffering, have their\r\nsympathies aroused, and see how well human nature can bear pain when\r\nit has to, and yet not be impatient, nor wish to end it all, then a\r\nrenewed life comes over them and they cease to be preoccupied with\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sympathy as a Remedy_.--In former days, when hospitals were not so\r\nwell provided and trained nurses non-existent, all forms of suffering\r\nhad a wider appeal and aroused more active sympathy than at present.\r\nIt is true that patients, in both hospitals and homes, suffered from\r\nthe lack of trained nursing, and that was an even greater\r\ndisadvantage. But it is, nevertheless, too bad that more actual touch\r\nwith suffering does not come to people now, for nothing is so sure to\r\nmake little ills disappear as the sympathy aroused by the sight of\r\nreal suffering. Certainly, our cancer cases might well be a strong\r\ntherapeutic factor for many of the neurotic ills of the world. They\r\nare, of course, deterrent to many people. It would seem to add\r\nneedlessly to human suffering for some of the delicate to have to be\r\nin contact with what is one of the most awful afflictions that flesh\r\nis heir to. If death and suffering were not inevitable, we might try\r\nto save people from the suffering which sympathy entails. But there is\r\nno avoiding them; soon or late they are sure to come to everyone. The\r\nupbuilding of character, consequent upon intimacy with them, is of\r\ngreat value, and really brings so much of contentment to people who\r\nare over-worried about little things that it is worth while to recall\r\nhow valuable this sympathy for suffering is in psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of this phase of occupation as if it referred only to\r\nwomen. There are many men of whom one may well say that they need more\r\nhuman sympathy in their lives and that if they had it their supposed\r\nills would drop from them, or seem so slight as to be quite\r\nnegligible. Over and over again, I have seen men who had become too\r\noccupied with themselves lose their pains and aches in an interest in\r\nsome real charity. Charity, however, not philanthropy, is the secret.\r\nThe sitting on a board of trustees of a charitable institution may\r\nmean little though even this usually has its good effect; but close\r\ncontact with the poor, intimate personal relations with other human\r\nbeings who are in suffering, are quite as necessary for men\r\nover-occupied with themselves as for women.\r\n\r\n{223}\r\n\r\n_Care of the Incurable_.--Mother Lathrop (Hawthorne's daughter) in her\r\ncancer work prefers not to take patients suffering from incurable\r\ncancer into the homes that she has for them, if they can in any way be\r\ncared for reasonably at their own home. Of course, the main reason is\r\nbecause there is so much of cancer in the community (one in thirty of\r\nthe population now die of it), that it is impossible to take care of\r\nall the cases that apply for admission. Another excellent reason is\r\nthat it would be too bad to take out of a home the opportunity for\r\nself-discipline that is afforded by the care of one of these patients,\r\nwhen it does not inflict an intolerable burden on someone already\r\noverworked. As a rule, the effect of attendance on such a patient does\r\nso much for character upbuilding, and for a proper realization of\r\nvalues in life, that trivial things fall into their right places.\r\nAnyone who has seen the development of character, And the growth in\r\namenity of disposition of those who bear such a burden with patience,\r\nwill realize just what is meant by the expressions used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding Mental Occupation.--For many of his patients the physician\r\nsimply must find occupation of mind. Not a little racking of brain is\r\nneeded for this, until experience helps. One form of occupation of\r\nmind that seemed quite unpromising at first, but that has in a number\r\nof cases proved of value, is the committing to memory of passages in\r\nverse. A generation ago it was quite common for people to have their\r\nmemories stored with fine passages from authors which they could\r\nrepeat literally. Latin verse particularly was learned by the school\r\nboys of fifty years ago. Frenchmen know their classical poets, and\r\nsome of the Italians also know theirs with wonderful fidelity. It is\r\nsaid that, even in his advanced years, Pope Leo XIII could repeat long\r\npassages of Dante and often found a relief from pressing cares of\r\nstate in the ponderings of the great thoughts recalled by the verses.\r\nI have known half a dozen Italian clergymen who could from memory\r\nfollow up a line of Dante, taken anywhere in the poet's writings, with\r\nthe rest of the passage.\r\n\r\nSuch well-stored memories furnished much more abundant food for\r\nthought to their possessors than do those of the modern time. Our\r\nmodern system of education has done away, to a great extent, with\r\nlearning by heart, but as one of those educated under the older system\r\nand who is still able to recall many passages from Pope, or\r\nGoldsmith's \"Deserted Village,\" or \"The Traveler,\" or from Virgil or\r\nHorace, I feel sure that this is a serious mistake. In some cases I\r\nhave deliberately tried to make up for it by having people, even well\r\non in years, settle down to memory lessons again. Under disorders of\r\nmemory I suggest the use of this practice as a valuable training which\r\nserves first to dispel the idea that memory is failing when it is only\r\nlack of attention and of concentration of mind that is at fault, and\r\nsecondly, because after a time there can be observed an actual\r\nimprovement of the memory faculty. Here I would insist on its value as\r\nan occupation of mind for those who lack some serious interests. I\r\nhave found it to be ever so much better as a diversion than reading or\r\nthe theater. If the interest in it can be awakened, it represents a\r\nvaluable adjunct in the treatment of some rather difficult cases of\r\nmental short-circuiting. Lord Chesterfield, in one of his letters,\r\nsuggested to his son that even very brief periods during the\r\nday--those that are ordinarily used for the fulfillment of bodily\r\nnecessities--might be employed to store the memory with valuable\r\nquotations, great thoughts {224} greatly expressed, and this should be\r\nrecalled. After a little practice not near so much time is required\r\nfor memory work as might be imagined, and the effects are excellent.\r\n\r\nMuch of this may seem too trivial for the physician to occupy himself\r\nwith and quite apart from his duties as a practitioner of medical\r\nscience. But it must not be forgotten that medical science is as yet\r\nquite imperfect and the practice of medicine is an art. What we have\r\nto do, is to treat individual patients rather than cure cases, for\r\nthat is why medicine is a profession. Each affected individual who\r\ncomes to us is quite different from any other. In spite of our\r\ngrouping them under certain heads, the diseases of the race are as\r\ndistinct from one another as the features of the individuals affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDIVERSION OF MIND--HOBBIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two classes for whom diversion is of the utmost value. The\r\nfirst are over-occupied with themselves; and the second group are so\r\noccupied with some one interest in life, or with one narrow set of\r\ninterests, that it becomes an obsession, never leaving them. Constancy\r\nof mental occupation with one set of thoughts proves seriously\r\ndisturbing after a time, especially if the only amusements available\r\nare so superficial that they do not really act as a diversion. Many of\r\nthe so-called neurasthenic or psychasthenic states (I would prefer to\r\ncall them conditions of nervous weakness and of psychic impotency,\r\nbecause the simpler names carry with them no suggestion of a definite\r\nailment) are really the consequence of this lack of any true\r\ndiversion. The patients do not get any genuine rest.\r\n\r\nThe typical example of such lack of diversion is the business man who,\r\ncontrary to the wisdom of the ages, takes his business home with him.\r\nIf we accept Ramon y Cajal's theory of attention, by which whenever a\r\nparticular portion of the brain is occupied with a subject the\r\ncapillary blood vessels in that particular part are pulled wide open\r\nby the contraction of the neuroglia cells, certain of the brain\r\ntissues in these cases are constantly in a state of congestion. It is\r\nnot surprising that such men suffer from insomnia. It is scarcely less\r\nto be wondered at if their digestion suffers, since that function is\r\nso important that it requires most of the nervous energy that a man\r\ncan provide at certain times. Besides his brain cells are never really\r\nresting. If a man goes to sleep with a thought and wakes with it, even\r\nthough he may not be quite conscious of the fact, his mind has been\r\noccupied with it. Brain cells need definite periods of rest. These\r\ncells are not getting such rest--hence the development of many\r\npathological conditions.\r\n\r\nI have described the extreme case, but it is not exaggerated. Writers,\r\neditors, scientific investigators and generally those whose work does\r\nnot bring them much in contact with others, are likely to thus suffer.\r\nContact with others, even on business matters, seems to have a\r\nrelaxing effect. Social amenities and personal interests prevent\r\nabsolute concentration of mind over long periods. In some people even\r\nmilder degrees of preoccupation with a {225} single subject may work\r\nharm. Some people are able to stand concentration of mind for many\r\nhours a day for years. Others cannot. We have come to recognize that\r\nmore than eight hours a day is a mistake, but there are many people\r\nwho cannot work more than a four-hour day. The sooner this is\r\nrecognized and diversion of mind provided, the better for them. This\r\nis one of the most important benefits that psychotherapy can confer on\r\nmany of the so-called neurasthenics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibility of Diversion of Attention from Ills.--The necessity for\r\ndiversion of attention from one's ills is best realized by considering\r\nwhat happens in the opposite direction. Headache, toothache, and many\r\nother uncomfortable feelings, especially discomfort associated with\r\nabdominal disturbances, can be entirely banished from the mind by\r\npleasant association with friends, by an interesting play, by a game\r\nof cards, or, indeed, by almost anything that takes up the attention\r\ncompletely. It is well understood that the severer forms of pains can\r\nnot be thus banished, but discomforts that make life miserable for the\r\npatient may be entirely relieved for the time being. If this power of\r\nmind to divert attention from the ills of the body means so much, it\r\nis not hard to understand that if this mental influence be directed in\r\nthe other way, that is, to emphasize the ailment by attention to it,\r\nit will not be long before symptoms become quite unbearable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies.--A hobby is the physical salvation for a man who wants to\r\nwork hard, yet not become so absorbed in his work that it becomes an\r\nobsession. Unfortunately, it is not possible to create a hobby for a\r\nman or a woman in a short time. It must be a growth for many years\r\nuntil it has become a portion of one's life. It must, as far as\r\npossible, be something to which one turns with as much interest as to\r\none's regular occupation, so that the time taken from it, even for the\r\nnecessary vocation of life, is more or less resented. If a man has two\r\noccupations that are intensely interesting, then he gets the best\r\npossible rest. Otherwise it will be necessary in many cases for the\r\nphysician to help him in the choice of another interest in life. It is\r\nnot enough that there should be a vacation once a year, or a\r\nconventional day off on Sunday. There must be much more than this,\r\ndeliberately planned and faithfully carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gladstone_.--Men with hobbies have done some of the best of the\r\nworld's work; busy for many hours every day, they have yet lived to be\r\neighty and even ninety years of age, and have been industrious to the\r\nend. A typical example in our generation was Gladstone, the great\r\nEnglish statesman. Few men had their minds occupied with more serious\r\nproblems than he for nearly forty years of a busy existence. In spite\r\nof this, he found time to make a study of Greek literature and of\r\necclesiastical writers; He acquired even more authority perhaps in\r\nthese subjects than in political science, doing the work of several\r\nmen, yet he lived to be an extremely old man. He welcomed the\r\nopportunity to get away from one kind of work in order to devote\r\nhimself to another, but this occupation of an entirely different set\r\nof brain cells gave those that had been previously at work opportunity\r\nfor complete rest. Very probably, except at times of special crisis or\r\nstress of anxiety, his political problems did not disturb his studies\r\nof Greek literature, not because he insisted on keeping them away, but\r\nbecause this other interest was so absorbing that it required no\r\nspecial effort to occupy his mind completely with it.\r\n\r\n{226}\r\n\r\n_Virchow_.--For more than a year I lived close to the great German\r\npathologist, Virchow, and found that his varied interests were\r\nprobably the secret of his power to devote himself to work for many\r\nhours a day, take only a small amount of sleep and yet live healthily\r\nand happily for over eighty years. Frequently he did not leave the\r\nPrussian legislature until 1 a. m., or even later, and yet he seldom\r\nfailed to be at his laboratory before 7:30 o'clock in the morning,\r\nthough it was several miles from his home and took over half an hour\r\nto get there. Besides pathology, he was deeply interested in\r\nanthropology and in most of the biological sciences, and his favorite\r\nhobby was the practical care of the health of the city of Berlin. From\r\nthe time when Berlin, just after the Franco-Prussian war, began to\r\ngrow out of the half-million provincial town that it was, into the\r\ngreat world capital that it became, a transformation that took less\r\nthan twenty years, Virchow had charge of the health of the men engaged\r\non the sewer farms of the city. Berlin, unlike other great capitals,\r\nis not situated on a large stream that will carry off its excreta, and\r\nconsequently a new problem in sewage disposal had to be met. The\r\nsewage was spread over fields outside the city and proved, as might be\r\nexpected, a magnificent fertilizer. The whole cost of sewage disposal\r\nwas recouped from the sale of the farm products.\r\n\r\nProphecies of dire disaster of many kinds were made when this system\r\nwas first proposed. It was said that the men engaged on the farms\r\nwould suffer from all sorts of disease, especially respiratory and\r\nintestinal diseases, that the farm products would be insanitary, and\r\nthe whole plant would be such a disease producer for the city as to\r\nbecome a nuisance. Virchow was put in charge of the sanitary side of\r\nthe project, and how well he fulfilled his obligations is shown by the\r\nstatistics. The people who worked on the farms were healthier than the\r\naverage inhabitants of Berlin, and were especially free from\r\nintestinal disease. Every phase of disease that occurred among the\r\nworkers on the farms, and there were many thousands of them with their\r\nfamilies, was reported to Virchow. Every night, the last thing before\r\nhe went to bed, he looked over this report and if there were any\r\nsuspicious cases, made arrangements for the prevention of the spread\r\nof disease.\r\n\r\nThis of itself might seem work enough for one man, but it was only a\r\ndiversion for Virchow, turning his mind away from his other\r\nintellectual work completely during certain hours of the day. His\r\nvisits to the farms, his planning for the prevention of the spread of\r\ndisease, his deep interest in the reports and the constant improvement\r\nof conditions, instead of hampering his other intellectual activity by\r\nwasting brain force, probably proved restful by diverting the blood\r\nstream away to the cells that occupied themselves with this other and\r\nvery different problem, and so proved a benefit, not an evil. Perhaps\r\nother men might not have had the store of nervous energy to enable\r\nthem to carry on work in this way, but for those who have, this is the\r\nideal arrangement. There are many others whose names might be\r\nmentioned here. John Bigelow and Pope Leo XIII are typical recent\r\nexamples. Great workers are usually long livers, barring accident, and\r\nall of them have had variety of occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity for Diversity of Occupation.--Even for those of lesser\r\nintellectual capacity, it is advisable to have, in a lower order of\r\nintellectual occupation, two very different things in which there is\r\nintense interest. The blase {227} attitude in which the individual\r\nfinds no interest in anything and nothing worth doing, makes it\r\nimpossible to secure such relaxation as will give relief from worry.\r\nSo long as nothing happens to call for special resistive vitality,\r\nsuch people may go on nursing their unhappiness. It is from this\r\nclass, however, that the suicides come. The mind becomes occupied with\r\nthe worries that it cannot get away from, sleep is interfered with;\r\nthe worries become an obsession, and brain exhaustion results. It is\r\nusually said that suicides are insane, and to this extent certainly\r\nthe expression is true. Certain brain cells have so long been occupied\r\nwith a particular subject, because the mind has no other interest to\r\ndivert attention and blood supply to other portions, that these cells\r\nare overborne and become utterly beyond the control of reason and\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntervals in Work.--The old university rule of long ago was that no\r\none should do more than two hours of intellectual work continuously at\r\nthe same subject. Certain of the monastic orders required scholars and\r\nstudents to take a break from an intellectual occupation for a\r\nmeasured interval at least every two hours. The modern business man,\r\nand even the literary man or reporter, would think this preposterous.\r\nThe rule is, however, founded on good common sense, for it relieves\r\nthe tension and keeps conditions of strain from inveterating\r\nthemselves in such a way as to do harm.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, better work is accomplished if it is done in\r\ntwo-hour intervals, with a break of fifteen minutes to a half-hour\r\nbetween, than if the attempt is made to work longer. This may not be\r\ntrue for certain forms of creative literary work, where, when the mood\r\nis on, it is easier to finish things than if a break occurs, but these\r\nare exceptional cases, and even here there may be serious abuse. Many\r\nof the men who work late at night eventually get into habits that\r\nseriously impair their sleep. This system of rest prevents such a\r\nstrain from being put upon the physical organs underlying attention as\r\nwill prevent them from promptly relaxing when the call upon them has\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, men for whom no such rules as these seem to be\r\nneeded, because they apparently thrive on work. These are exceptions,\r\nhowever, that prove the rule. They will usually be found on\r\ninvestigation to have been men who lived very simply and permitted\r\nthemselves very little excitement. There is great danger in imitating\r\nthem because most of them had a superabundant vitality which expressed\r\nitself in longevity as well as in a noteworthy capacity for work. They\r\nhad superabundant brain power to run their business (even though it\r\nwas deeply intellectual), but then, too, these men were careful not to\r\nthrow extra burdens upon their digestive organs, nor to abuse\r\nstimulants, nor to permit a regular routine of work to be disturbed.\r\nWhen symptoms of nerve weakness begin to show themselves, even the\r\nexceptional men must be warned of the danger. The causes of the\r\nexhaustion of nervous vitality should be pointed out, and an\r\nimprovement of habits insisted upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmusement and the Mind.--The theater, as it is at the present time,\r\naffords very little opportunity for mental relaxation. Most of our\r\ntheatricals are mere show that occupies the eye but does not seriously\r\ncatch the attention, especially after a certain number of types of\r\nthese performances have been attended. The humor of the comedians of\r\nour musical comedy may, for {228} a certain number of people, mean\r\nsomething as a diversion of mind, but it does not last. Unfortunately,\r\npractically all their humor runs along the same line, most of it is\r\nextremely superficial, much of it is borrowed and wears signs of its\r\norigin, not a little of it is mere horse-play, which may divert\r\nchildren but not grown men, and so the theater as a mental relaxation\r\nhas lost nearly all of its effect. Other diversions are sometimes more\r\nhopeful. For baseball enthusiasts, attendance at a game may be such a\r\ncomplete occupation of mind as to furnish thorough relaxation.\r\n\r\nThe kind of work that provides mental relaxation for others often\r\nproves exhausting to those who do it. Humorists, especially those who\r\nhave to grind out paragraphs or columns of humor every day or every\r\nweek, are usually melancholy men. The story of Grimaldi illustrates\r\nhow serious may be the effect of work that seems mere play if pursued\r\ntoo singly. This humorist on one occasion consulted a specialist in\r\nmental diseases, for certain symptoms of nervous breakdown and\r\ndepression that were causing him much annoyance and even more\r\nsolicitude. The specialist believed in diversion of mind, and, having\r\nbeen to see Grimaldi the night before and enjoyed him hugely, though\r\nhe did not recognize him off the stage, counseled him to go and see\r\nthat humorist and have his \"blue devils\" banished for good. \"If\r\nGrimaldi won't cure you of your depression,\" he added, \"I don't know\r\nanything that will.\" \"My God!\" the humorist said, \"then don't leave\r\nme in despair. Man, I am Grimaldi!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSports.--Unfortunately in our modern life we have to a great extent\r\nlost the idea of sport. The conventional make-shifts of life in a camp\r\nthat is really a luxurious country house, or on a luxurious yacht, do\r\nnot replace the complete diversions that came with real camping,\r\nhunting, fishing, sailing and the like. People now go to the country,\r\nbut take the city with them. They live in country hotels and make five\r\nchanges of clothing in the day, if not more. If men are interested in\r\nhunting and fishing and can go into the forest (unfortunately even the\r\nAdirondacks can scarcely be so designated now and we have to go into\r\nthe Canadian wilderness to get away from the pall of regular life and\r\ncivilization), complete recreation is secured. This makes a real\r\nvacation which does not mean absolute freedom of mind, but freedom\r\nfrom other cares so that one may with complete absorption apply\r\nhimself to something different. During the year sports for grown-ups\r\nare difficult to obtain. Some men continue well on in middle life to\r\nplay tennis, hand-ball, and certain other games, _O fortunati nimium_,\r\nthat make the best kind of diversion. Fortunately, in recent years\r\ngolf has become a favorite and for many makes a genuine diversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Diversions.--In recent years we have so interfered with the\r\nnormal natural development of the child that there is need to\r\nemphasize certain details in this matter. The modern child is apt to\r\nbe precociously occupied with books and adult interests, because he is\r\nbrought so much into the foreground of family interests. True play for\r\nsome city-bred children is almost an anomaly. Exercise and air they\r\nget. They are conducted solemnly to the park by a nursemaid, who is\r\ninstructed to see that they do not play with other children unless\r\nquite as well dressed as they are themselves, and their dress is often\r\nso elaborate that it is quite impossible for them to think of any real\r\nplay. There is absolutely no recreation for the child in this\r\nprocedure: on {229} the contrary, a new effort of will is required to\r\nwalk with the stately propriety that is expected of it. Then the child\r\nis preoccupied with the thought of its clothes. Relaxation of mind is\r\noften quite out of the question, and yet we wonder why children are\r\nnervous and do not sleep well, why they have night terrors and do not\r\ndigest their food properly, while all the time they are living\r\nunnatural lives that give no proper outlet for their energies and\r\nlittle diversion for their mind.\r\n\r\nGames are important, but their true spirit has gone out in recent\r\nyears. There are still a few young people who play for the sake of the\r\nsport, but everything now seems to be a preparation for some sort of\r\ncontest. Only those are engaged in these contests and the preparation\r\nfor them whose muscular development is such as to suggest that they\r\nwill help to win. Winning, and not sport, has become the purpose of\r\nour games. This makes the participants worry about the games and\r\nassociate them with dread of errors and ill chances. It is true that\r\nthe interest for the contestants during the game is sufficient to make\r\nup for this and make the game valuable as relaxation; but those who\r\nneed such relaxation most--the boys and girls who are underdeveloped\r\nmuscularly--must sit and watch the contests, and this, after one has\r\nbecome accustomed to it, like newspaper reading and the theater,\r\nconstitutes a poor apology for the complete relaxation of mind and\r\ndiversion of brain-cell energy that used to come with sports when they\r\nwere freely indulged, for the sake of the sport and not for the sake\r\nof winning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHABIT\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people realize how powerful a factor for physical, as well as\r\nmoral, good and evil is habit. The old expression that habit is second\r\nnature is amply illustrated in the most familiar experiences. The\r\nchild, unable at the beginning to make any but the most ill-directed\r\nmovements, learns during its first two years to make the most complex\r\nco-ordinated movements--first with difficulty, then with ease, and\r\nfinally with such facility that there is no need for it to pay any but\r\nthe most perfunctory attention to their execution. Walking requires\r\nthe co-ordination of a large number of muscles so that the absolute\r\nposition of every muscle in both the legs and in the trunk, at least\r\nas far as the shoulders, must be definitely known and their activity\r\nproperly directed. Perhaps nothing brings out more clearly the\r\ndifficulty of walking, though it depends on only one factor, the\r\nco-ordination of the two sides of the body, than the story of the\r\nItalian Tozzi twins. They were born with two heads and shoulders and\r\nwith only one pair of legs. It was found that each head ruled the leg\r\non its own side of the body. It was impossible for the creatures to\r\nwalk. They lived to adolescent life, yet never succeeded in walking.\r\nThe intimate association of the lower parts of their trunk and the\r\nlong years of companionship of their brains, did not enable them to\r\naccomplish what seems to us so commonplace a co-ordination of movement\r\nas walking.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormation of Habits.--The co-ordination of the two limbs is after all\r\nonly a small portion of walking. The body must be held erect, the\r\ncurve of {230} the spine must be managed so that the center of gravity\r\nis kept well within the base, and gluteal and femoral and calf muscles\r\nmust all be co-ordinated with one another. In a few months a child\r\nlearns to do all this, and in a couple of years it executes all the\r\nco-ordinate motions with such certainty that walking becomes not only\r\nan easy matter but an absolutely unconscious accomplishment that can\r\nbe carried on while the mind is occupied with something else or while\r\nit becomes so abstracted that surrounding objects are not noticed.\r\n\r\nA far more difficult co-ordination is required for talking. It is only\r\nwhen we analyze how nicely adjusted must be every movement, in order\r\nto pronounce consonants and vowels properly and to combine them in\r\nvarious ways, that we realize how complex is the mechanism of talking.\r\nA difference of a hundredth of an inch in the movement of the tongue,\r\nor less than that in the movements of various muscles of the larynx,\r\nmakes all the differences between clear articulation and a defect of\r\nspeech. In the course of the years up to seven, the child learns this\r\nwonderful co-ordination apparently without difficulty, but really at\r\nthe cost of constant well-directed effort. There is no time in human\r\nexistence when the child really learns so much as during the first\r\nfour years of its existence, even if it learns nothing else except to\r\nwalk and to talk. The foolishness of obtruding other things,\r\ninformation and study of various kinds, on the child's attention at\r\nthis time should be manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unconscious Regulation of Muscles_.--What is thus prefigured in early\r\nlife invades every activity in later years. The boy who learns to ride\r\na bicycle must at first devote all his attention to it, but after a\r\nwhile rides it quite unconsciously, his muscles having learned by\r\nhabit to accommodate themselves automatically to all the varying\r\npositions of his machine. Anything well learned by habit is never\r\nforgotten. How hard it is to learn to swim, yet, after years away from\r\nthe practice of it, the art comes back at once. The same is true of\r\nskating, and of the nice adjustments of muscles required in various\r\ngames. Such is the influence of habit in forming a second nature. It\r\nis no wonder that Reid, the Scotch philosopher, should have written:\r\n\r\n  As without instinct the infant could not live to become a man, so\r\n  without habit man would remain an infant through life, and would be\r\n  as helpless, as unhandy, as speechless, and as much a child in\r\n  understanding at threescore as at three.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this Prof. J. P. Gordy, in his\r\n\"New Psychology,\" [Footnote 26] says:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: \"New Psychology,\" by J. P. Gordy, New York, 1898.]\r\n\r\n  Strong as this statement seems, it is probably an understatement of\r\n  the truth. Without habit, we should rather say, a man would be as\r\n  helpless, as speechless, as unhandy at three-score as at birth.\r\n  Habit is the architect that builds the feeble rudimentary powers of\r\n  the child into the strong, developed powers of the full-grown man.\r\n  If a child's vague, purposeless movements give place to definite\r\n  movements performed for definite purposes, if his sensations become\r\n  more definite, if his perceptions become clearer, if his memory\r\n  becomes more accurate, if he reasons more and more correctly and\r\n  logically, it is because of habit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw of Habit.--The law of habit is that every time we perform any\r\naction, mental or physical, or allow ourselves to be affected in any\r\nway, we have more proneness to, and greater facility in the\r\nperformance of that action or in {231} experiencing that affection\r\nunder similar circumstances, than we had before. In the chapter on\r\nTics, I call attention to the fact that all the curious gestures by\r\nwhich we are individualized, are due to the law of habit. It is\r\ninfinitely amusing to watch a group of people and note the endlessly\r\ndifferent habits of which they have become the victims. There are\r\ntricks of speech and tricks of gesture eminently characteristic and\r\noften quite laughably individualistic. We imitate, especially those of\r\nwhom we think much. Sometimes it is only when a father's attention is\r\ncalled to them in his sons that he realizes the ludicrousness, or at\r\nleast laughableness, of some of the things he does, and he proceeds to\r\ncorrect both generations of their faults.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL HABITS\r\n\r\n\r\nHabit and Food.--Most of our likes and dislikes for food are neither\r\nphysical nor physiological, but simply habitual. We have become\r\naccustomed to certain things, and so we like them. We are unaccustomed\r\nto them, and do not care for them. It is amusing when people put\r\nforward these lacks of habituation as if they were physiological\r\nidiosyncracies. Many thin people do not like butter and milk. The real\r\nreason for this is not any peculiarity of digestion, or any gastric\r\nincompatibility, at least in 99 cases out of every 100, but the mere\r\nfact that they are not habituated to their use. That is one of the\r\nreasons why they are thin. Our tastes for curious foreign foods are\r\nnearly all deliberately acquired. Not one in ten ordinary Americans\r\nlikes olives or caviar when first tasted. Nearly every curious article\r\nof food is \"caviar to the general\" at first trial. Later it becomes\r\nimpossible to understand how we could have had any objection to them.\r\nAt times, even an actual craving for them asserts itself as a\r\nconsequence of the habitual use, and then deprivation means positive\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlow Eating.--One of the most valuable habits that a man can\r\ncultivate, but one of the most difficult to acquire in our time, is\r\nthat of eating slowly. Most Americans bolt their food to a degree that\r\nwould be quite appalling to them if they realized what they were\r\ndoing. Pieces of potatoe as large as the end of the thumb are\r\nswallowed. Bread and milk may be eaten so hurriedly as to be as potent\r\na source of digestive disturbance as fried onions. There seems no\r\ndoubt from what we know of Fletcher's experience and Chittendan and\r\nFollin's studies that a man derives more nutrition from food that is\r\nmasticated properly, that he can get along and do his work on less\r\nmaterial and that, above all, there is not the same tendency for him\r\nto put on weight that is so common among people after reaching middle\r\nage.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Clarke used to have his patients chew a definite number ol\r\ntimes on each bite--say thirty times. Even so great a man as Gladstone\r\nsubmitted to this rule and gradually learned to accustom himself to\r\neating very slowly. Fletcher's system of chewing the food until it\r\npasses down the esophagus of itself without any swallowing effort is a\r\nbetter rule. It is a surprise to most people how unconsciously\r\nswallowing can be accomplished in this way and how little liquid is\r\nneeded in order to prepare food to be swallowed. The formation of the\r\nhabit, however, is not an easy one. Persistence and frequent reminders\r\nare needed, or else the beginnings of the habit are soon dissipated\r\nand old bolting habits reassert themselves.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Drinking.--In drinking, habit is as supreme as in eating. The\r\nmajority of people who work outside and perform muscular labor crave\r\nand take an abundance of water. Many of those who live indoors,\r\nespecially in steam-heated houses, may need it quite as much if not\r\nmore, but get out of the habit of drinking water. As we need about\r\nthree quarts of water per day for use in our economy, this no water\r\nhabit often becomes a serious factor in the production of\r\nphysiological disturbances. We have replaced water drinking and the\r\nmilk drinking of the olden times by tea and coffee, and as these are\r\nstimulants, habits form very readily with regard to them. I have known\r\npeople who were sure they would be miserable without their half-dozen\r\ncups of tea or coffee each day, and who actually would be miserable\r\nfor a few days, when deprived of it. They were seriously impairing the\r\nefficiency of their nervous system by so much stimulation.\r\nUnfortunately, it is just those whose nervous systems have least\r\nstability, and are already the subjects of more stimulation by\r\nconscious introspection than is good for them, that are most likely to\r\nform the tea and coffee habits, and who are most harmed by them,\r\nthough they find it hard to understand the reason therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir and Exercise Habits.--Habits with regard to exercise and fresh air\r\nare particularly important. In this matter it is only habit that can\r\nbe really helpful. To work at high pressure indoors for several days,\r\nand then, when one is quite on edge, to take a lot of severe physical\r\nexercise is not good. Every human being should go out between meals. I\r\nam not one of those who believe much in exercise for exercise's\r\nsake--what is needed is fresh air. Our sanatorium patients who sit\r\nout-doors all day have fine appetites. The advice to a busy man that\r\nhe must form the habit of being out between every two meals for from\r\nhalf an hour to an hour would usually evoke a strenuous protest, but\r\nall he needs to do is to get up half an hour earlier and walk down to\r\nhis office, and if he will walk back in the evening he will have\r\nplenty of air and exercise between his meals.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange of Habits.--Patients do not want to change their habits. They\r\ncome to a doctor to be treated. They want some medicine that will,\r\nwithout further inconvenience, rid them of certain discomforting\r\nsymptoms. At the beginning, at least, patients resent interference\r\nwith their habits. They are quite satisfied, and to modify them\r\nrequires an effort that must be continued for some time. The changing\r\nof old habits and the formation of new habits are most important for\r\nthe ordinary ills to which mankind is prone. Modifications of habit\r\nconstitute real hygiene and are not mere corrections of symptoms,\r\npermitting the habits that have led up to them to go on.\r\n\r\nPatients may conclude that it is too much trouble to change their\r\nhabits. We all know persons who feel that they can not give up their\r\ncoffee. As to whether or not the modification of a habit is worth the\r\ntrouble it involves, the patient must be the judge after the case is\r\nput properly before him. It is possible that he may learn to endure\r\nthe inconvenience given him by his symptoms rather than to stand the\r\ninconvenience of changing a nicely settled habit, and forming a new\r\none. The reward should be put very plainly before him, however, and\r\nbesides, the consequences of his habit in the future should be\r\nsuggested so that he may realize just what it will lead to.\r\n\r\n{233}\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL HABITS\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the foregoing that physical habits have much to do\r\nwith making life easier and saving expenditure of nervous energy, but\r\njust this same thing holds good for mental states. With care, a proper\r\nhabit of mind and of the mental attitude towards difficulties in life,\r\ncan be so cultivated as to ward off many of the discouragements, and\r\nmost of the causes of depression that weigh heavily on some people.\r\nThe natural disposition can not be entirely overcome, but habit, as a\r\nsecond nature, can modify the personality so as to make conditions\r\nmuch better than before.\r\n\r\nWith this wonderful power in habit, it is too bad that its force for\r\ngood is not used. It is especially important that its force for evil\r\nshall not allowed to dominate human actions so as to make them harder\r\nof accomplishment. Many people, who are greatly troubled by the\r\ninconveniences and discomforts necessarily associated with human life,\r\nworry over it to such a degree as to make themselves sick. The\r\nexpression I have quoted elsewhere of the old man who said, \"I have\r\nhad many troubles but most of them never happened,\" is a typical\r\nexample of what the habit of looking at things from a wrong standpoint\r\nmeans to many people. They are confirmed pessimists. Their one\r\nconsolation, when a small evil happens to them, is that perhaps this\r\nmay be sufficient to ward off the greater evil that fate surely has in\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n\r\nPessimism.--Pessimism has been defined as sticking one's nose in a\r\ndungheap and then asking, \"How is it that it smells bad around here?\"\r\nSome people are always nursing a grievance. No matter how many times\r\nthey may happen to have been undeceived, still the next time the\r\nopportunity occurs they are sure that fate or friends or someone has\r\nit in for them and that the worst may happen at any time. In the\r\nexpressive words of a recent slang phrase, they have a \"perennial\r\ngrouch.\" This state of mind toward the environment not only prevents\r\nthe physical and mental good that cheerfulness brings with it, but it\r\nunfavorably influences physical conditions within the body. People\r\nsuffering from indigestion are usually morbid, petulant, and hard to\r\nget along with. Many a dyspeptic makes this an excuse for his bad\r\ntemper. Anyone who has had to study these cases much soon comes to the\r\nconclusion that the beginning of the digestive disturbance was the\r\ngloomy outlook on life, which flowed inward to disturb the digestion\r\nand all the other animal functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression of Mind and Body.--Patients suffering from melancholia\r\nnearly always lose in weight. As a result of their lowered vitality,\r\nthere is a suppression of the nervous impulses which rule over\r\nnutrition, with a consequent loss of weight. In cases where there are\r\nonly tendencies to depression and gloom, the effect upon the digestive\r\nsystem is not so marked but there is no doubt that there is some\r\neffect, and that the indigestion in these cases is more often than not\r\na result of the depressed state of mind, rather than the depression of\r\nmind the result of the indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoodiness.--The habit of looking at the gloomy side of things is\r\neasily formed and, once acquired, it becomes very forceful. Many a man\r\nwho was quite cheerful when young, becomes moody as he grows older.\r\nNearly everyone permits moods more than is good for him. The attitude\r\nof mind that should be cultivated is one in which it is realized that,\r\nthough there may be {234} many sources of evil in the world there is a\r\npreponderance of good even in the worst environment, and that\r\nopportunities for making the best of things will be found by any\r\ncheerful disposition. _Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch_ is a typical\r\nexample in fiction of the optimism that counts. Miss Helen Keller in\r\nreal life is a typical example of how the most untoward circumstances\r\ncan not crush the spirit of man if he only wishes to be cheerful--if\r\nhe only tries to lift himself above his surroundings, no matter how\r\ndiscouraging they may seem to be. No one is without discouragement and\r\ncauses for unhappiness. \"Happy he who has least,\" the Greek dramatist\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the optimistic and the pessimistic point of\r\nview is much more a matter of habit than is usually thought to be the\r\ncase. Indeed, there is good reason for assuming that it is so largely\r\na matter of habit, that other factors count for little. We all know\r\nindividuals who, after having, been cheery, bright, hopeful and\r\nhelpful, have had some incident sour them and then they have been just\r\nthe opposite. This did not come all at once; it was a growth. They\r\nfelt hurt and aggrieved, and then began to look at things through dark\r\nglasses, and after a time could see nothing on its brighter side. Not\r\ninfrequently, as doctors well know, the growth of such a moody\r\ndisposition has been the signal for the development of a series of\r\ncomplaints, if not of actual symptoms, and men and women who have not\r\nbeen in the doctor's hands before now become valetudinarians. This new\r\nphysical condition is often attributed by their friends, by\r\nthemselves, and even by complacent physicians, to the effect upon them\r\nof the trial or disappointment that struck them. Only too often it is\r\nwholly due to the cultivation of a habit of pessimism consequent upon\r\na shock that for the moment pushed their cheerfulness into the\r\nbackground. Strong characters will not be thus easily affected, but\r\nweaker characters need not suffer such a change of disposition and\r\nwith it a deterioration of health or well-being unless they so will\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND DISPOSITION\r\n\r\nHabit can modify nature so much as to make what is practically another\r\nman. We all know how the dancing master can transform a country gawk\r\ninto a refined, courteous society man (not gentleman, for that is\r\nsomething else) of graceful carriage and even handsome bearing. He\r\ncannot do this for all the pupils that come to him, for it is\r\nimpossible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but for anyone\r\nthat comes with good will the revolution in manners is often a\r\nrevelation to those who have known the man before. When the exterior\r\ncan be changed so much, the interior attitude toward other people\r\ncertainly can be greatly modified.\r\n\r\nPersons of a melancholic disposition may be surprisingly cheerful, and\r\neven gay, with comparative strangers when they make the effort to be\r\nso. For many people, meeting with strangers is an excellent remedial\r\nmeasure. It stirs them up to present the best side, and it occupies\r\nattention to the exclusion of themselves in a way that is extremely\r\nbeneficial. If people would only form the habit of being as courteous\r\nto their own folks as they are to others, the disposition involved in\r\nthis would often save them from certain symptoms, and save their\r\nphysicians from many complaints.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\nHappiness is the basis of good health. The phrase is often put the\r\nother way: Good health is the basis of happiness. Without health there\r\nis no happiness. But every physician knows that many a patient\r\nsuffering from real organic ills, and having much physical pain to\r\nbear, still has many hours of happiness in working for others. This\r\nhappiness reflected back upon his physical life is not able to cure\r\nhis ailments, but does so lessen the significance of the symptoms as\r\nto make the ailment more bearable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC IMPORTANCE OF HABIT\r\n\r\nThe most important therapeutic element in the formation of good\r\nhabits, mental and physical, is that habit does away with the\r\nnecessity for conscious regulation of many details of life. Without\r\nhabits of doing things, we have to make numerous decisions and keep on\r\nmaking them under conditions that require special effort and waste of\r\nenergy. When habit asserts itself, there is little or no difficulty.\r\nHabits of living in airy rooms, of taking exercise, of food regulation\r\nas to quantity and quality, of methods of taking food as regards\r\nmastication, the quantity of fluid ingested, the hours of meals and\r\nthe like, can all be formed and then followed without effort. Just\r\ninasmuch as life can be ruled by habit, nerve force is conserved. This\r\nis as true for our attitude towards life, our disposition and\r\nconsequently our satisfaction with life, as for anything else that we\r\ndo. Habitual cheerfulness, habitual readiness to make allowance for\r\nothers and to be helpful to them, habitual self-control--all of these\r\nthings can be cultivated. Properly cultivated, they save much of the\r\nwear and tear of life, and make for contentment and happiness much\r\nmore than many of the things for which men strive so anxiously because\r\nthey seem to promise happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPAIN\r\n\r\nPain, while always a dreaded symptom of disease, seems, with the\r\nincrease of comfort and the gradual abolition that has come in our\r\ntime of many of the trials of existence, to have had its terrors\r\nincreased. Even a slight pain or ache is dreaded, and if continuous or\r\nfrequently repeated, becomes for many people a trial that is almost\r\nimpossible to bear. This is all the more to be deplored because\r\nability to stand a certain amount of pain, with reasonable equanimity,\r\nis almost a necessary condition of rapid recovery from disease or\r\ninjury. Placidity of mind favors the flow of nerve impulses for\r\nreconstructive purposes, while over-reaction to pain inhibits the\r\nnatural processes of repair. According to Shakespeare's heroine:\r\n\"There was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache\r\npatiently.\" Pain is usually supposed to be an essentially physical\r\nphenomena for which mental influence can be of little, if any,\r\nbenefit. As a matter of fact, however, the mental attitude towards\r\npain modifies it to a considerable degree. I have quoted Hippocrates'\r\ndeclaration that a greater pain drives out a lesser pain. Any strong\r\npreoccupation of mind will greatly lessen pain at any time.\r\n\r\n{236}\r\n\r\nPain is not, after all, in the nerves, nor in the central nervous\r\nsystem, but in the consciousness. Just as there is no sound unless the\r\nwaves in the air arouse recognition in the consciousness, so there is\r\nno pain unless the disturbance of nerves finds its way above the\r\nthreshold of consciousness. Nerves may be racked, yet no sensation may\r\nbe felt. There may be pain in the mind apart from the nerves, and\r\nslight nervous affections may produce severe pains. The whole question\r\nof the treatment of pain involves the individual much more than it\r\ndoes the affliction which causes the pain. What seems unbearable pain\r\nto many may be little more than a passing annoyance to others. What\r\nwould be, under ordinary circumstances, intolerable torture,\r\nespecially to sensitive people, may, because of intense preoccupation\r\nof mind, remain absolutely unnoticed. Maniacal patients sometimes\r\ninflict what would normally be extremely severe pain on themselves by\r\nburning or mutilation without any manifestation of pain. In the\r\nexcitement of a panic men may suffer what would, under other\r\ncircumstances, be excruciating agony, and yet not know that they are\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nTo a mind that is without serious interest, even slight pain, if\r\ncontinuous, soon becomes unbearable. The course of pain, where there\r\nis no diversion of mind, is an interesting study. While suffering, we\r\nseem always able to bear the pain of the present moment, and it is\r\nonly the cumulative effect of the pain that is past and the\r\nanticipation of the discomfort to come, that make the pain unbearable.\r\nNearly, always it is much more the dread of what the pain may mean,\r\nand the lack of power to endure which gradually develops as a\r\nconsequence of suffering, that constitute the worst features of pain.\r\nAt the beginning of a period of pain we stand it well, as a rule, but\r\nits continual nagging debilitates us and heightens our susceptibility\r\nuntil we cannot nerve ourselves to further endurance. If our power of\r\nendurance were not thus gradually lessened the pain would not seem\r\nsevere. There are many neurotic people whose susceptibility to pain\r\nhas been so much increased by their lack of self-control and their\r\ntendency to react easily to pain, that even slight pain becomes a\r\ntorment. Psychotherapy should gradually train these people to a power\r\nof endurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain from Over-Attention.--Much of what is called pain is really due\r\nto such concentration of mind on a particular portion of the body that\r\nthe ordinary sensations of that part, usually accomplished quite\r\nunconsciously, become first a source of uneasy discomfort and then an\r\nache or pain. There may be some slight physical disturbance which\r\ncalls attention to the part, but there is no really serious\r\npathological condition. While such pains are spoken of as imaginary it\r\nmust be remembered that this does not mean that they are non-existent.\r\nOn the contrary they may be much more real to the patient than\r\nphysical ailments. A pain in the mind is a much more serious condition\r\nthan having it in the body.\r\n\r\nWhile pain may be thus created by concentration of attention, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that what the mind can do in increasing pain is even\r\nmore important than in originating it. Slight discomforts by\r\nconcentration of attention on them may be made insupportable. It is\r\nthis element in pain, above all, that the physician requires skill to\r\nalleviate. Habits of introspection and the lack of serious occupation\r\nof mind of many people leave them the victims of over attention to\r\nthemselves. In trying to relieve their pain it may be {237}\r\ncomparatively easy to alleviate their physical condition, but the\r\nmental condition, once aroused, may remain, and may easily tempt to\r\nthe use of habit-forming drugs or others that may do serious harm. The\r\nstory of the evil effects of headache powders in recent years, and of\r\nthe opium habits formed in olden times, are a significant commentary\r\non this fact. It is probable that in most of these cases, the\r\ndiscomfort for which remedies were frequently taken was of a kind that\r\nshould have been treated only partly, if at all, by drugs. It is more\r\nimportant to lessen susceptibility than to try to cure the pain.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the mind to what is often considered severe physical\r\npain, has come to be generally recognized in recent years. Neuralgias,\r\nfor instance, have often been reported as recurring after fright, or\r\nstrong emotion, or worry. It is at moments when patients are much run\r\ndown in health that pains are particularly likely to be unrelievable,\r\nand during periods of emotional strain that anodyne drugs are most\r\ncalled for and are most likely to be abused.\r\n\r\n\r\nRest and Pain.--In any study of pain and its relief, one must always\r\nrecur to that classical contribution to medicine, now in the fiftieth\r\nyear of its publication and still as important as when it was written,\r\nHilton's \"Rest and Pain.\" He calls attention to the fact that what he\r\nwrote was only a development of what many practical physicians had\r\nthought long before his time. He quotes a prize essay of the French\r\nsurgeon, David, written in 1778. Hilton's development of the idea that\r\npain is usually a signal on the part of nature for rest, and that rest\r\nwill usually enable her to overcome the pathological condition and so\r\nrelieve the pain without recourse to drugs, is, and ever must be, the\r\nbasic element in the therapeutics of pain. How many forms rest may\r\ntake can only be judged by a careful reading of Hilton's book. The\r\noftener one reads it, the better one realizes how much of precious\r\ncommon sense and acute clinical observation there is in it. It is\r\nessentially a book of psychotherapy. It treats the patient's mind\r\nfirst and then through that changes his habits, persuades him of the\r\nneed of rest, directs how that rest should be taken and so leads up to\r\nhis natural cure.\r\n\r\nEvery treatment of pain must include rest of mind as well as body.\r\nHilton has particularly dwelt on the rest of body. Rest of mind is\r\njust as important. Many pains could be easily borne were it not for\r\nthe worry that accompanies them. A slight pain becomes greatly\r\nannoying because the patient's general condition makes it impossible\r\nto stand discomfort with equanimity, and there has been no training in\r\nself-control. In spite of all our advance in medicine, we are not\r\nlikely ever to make life so free from pain that people can go through\r\nit without needing self-control. Training in self-control is an\r\nimportant psychotherapeutic prophylactic. If, with a certain amount of\r\ncapacity to bear discomfort, there goes such rest of mind as does not\r\nexaggerate or emphasize the condition, then many of the pains of life\r\nlose their power to annoy, all of them are distinctly lessened and the\r\nrelief of them by accessory physical methods becomes easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain in Its Relation to Life.--There is an unfortunate tendency to\r\nexaggerate the significance of pain. We have cultivated irritability\r\nin the physical sense, rather than the power of endurance. Patients\r\nshould, as far as possible, be lifted out of this condition of\r\nover-delicate sensitiveness and put into a state where the idea of\r\npain is not so serious. Only in this way can {238} the more or less\r\ninevitable discomforts of life be borne without such reactions as\r\nseriously interfere with health. It may be said to be other than the\r\nphysician's business to secure this magnanimity, but as magnanimity is\r\nneeded in our patients, and there is no one else to respond,\r\nphysicians must start its cultivation. The necessity for learning to\r\nbear minor discomforts, at least without exaggerated reaction, need\r\nnot be presented to the patient directly, but can be gradually made a\r\npart of the system of treatment. By absorption in other interests, the\r\nconsciousness of these discomforts disappears without the necessity\r\nfor recourse to drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Denial.--Many thoughtful people are sure that what is needed to\r\nmake a large number of our generation more happy, or at least less\r\nmiserable, is training in self-denial and in self-control. The word\r\nself-denial has come to have a very distant sound for most of our\r\ngeneration. From early childhood anything that is unpleasant is\r\nshunned and anything that is difficult is likely to be shirked. The\r\nhead-master of Eton College has recently insisted that too much is\r\nbeing done to please young folks and too little to stimulate them to\r\nactivity. He declares that, as a rule, any undertaking begins to be\r\nuseful just where it ceases to be simply pleasant. Unpleasantness is\r\navoided to such a degree that the habit of thinking that it has no\r\npart in life comes to be a second nature. As a consequence, the\r\nreaction to any continued unpleasantness is likely to be exaggerated\r\nand make the subject very miserable, and sometimes disturbs and\r\ndiscourages, whereas it should have the effect of stimulating to\r\nreactive efforts, to bring out the best that is in us.\r\n\r\nHinton emphasizes the fact that an ingredient of pain is necessary to\r\nall health or pleasure. The fatigue and the hardship associated with\r\nmountain climbing is a portion of the essence of the pleasure in it.\r\nAll healthy, pleasant exercise has an accompaniment of fatigue and\r\nsome aches and pains. What is needed, then, in our time is the\r\ntraining to do things for the sake of doing them. We should be\r\nneglectful of the discomfort that may be associated with them, or we\r\nshould even consciously rejoice in the fact that this very discomfort\r\nis of itself a sign that functions are being used to such an extent,\r\nthat their limits are being expanded, their limitations overcome.\r\n\r\nIt may well be said that it is not the physician who, as a rule,\r\nshould do this; it should be accomplished in the early years by the\r\nteachers and trainers of the young. True enough. But physicians can at\r\nleast help in reforming the tradition in this matter so as to\r\nneutralize the present state of mind which seems to look upon pain as\r\nan evil. Pain is always either a conservative sensation or an actual\r\nstimulus to function. Besides, many of the present generation who come\r\nto us, having had no training in the precious qualities of self-denial\r\nand self-control under difficulties and discomforts, must have this\r\nknowledge supplied for them as far as possible by suggestions of\r\nvarious kinds. It is more difficult to accomplish much in this matter\r\nfor the adult, but even in apparently hopeless cases of over-attention\r\nto self and incapacity to bear discomfort, much can be accomplished by\r\npatience and persistence.\r\n\r\nThe common dread of suffering is quite unwarranted by what we know\r\nabout the effect of pain. There are many motives that may be adduced\r\nto make it seem less terrifying than it now is to many people. The\r\neffect of pain upon character is always excellent. The difference\r\nbetween two brothers, as we have said, one of whom has had the\r\ndiscipline of pain or suffering and {239} the development of sympathy\r\nthat comes with it, and the other who has not had the advantage of\r\nthis great human experience, is likely to be marked. In the one there\r\nis a depth of human nature that enables him to appreciate and even to\r\nexpress the meaning of life better than his apparently more fortunate\r\nbrother. Practically all the men who have ever got close to the heart\r\nof the mystery of life, and expressed it in poetry or other form of\r\nliterature or art, have gone through suffering as a portion of their\r\ntraining. Even the suffering that comes from ill health is never\r\nwasted. Men have gone through it who have thought that the ecstasy of\r\nrelief following it made the experience worth while.\r\n\r\nMen are not deterred from action by the prospect of even severe pain.\r\nProbably no greater physical suffering can possibly be invited than is\r\nsure to come to those who go on Arctic expeditions, or who undertake\r\nprospecting in Alaska. Of course, many of the prospectors find\r\nthemselves in the bitter cold of the North without having realized\r\nwhat they would have to stand. But Arctic explorers, as a rule, know\r\nexactly what they have to expect. Most of of them have been through it\r\nall before, yet they deliberately choose to go again for rewards that,\r\nto an average man's eyes, seem trivial. The memory of past pain is\r\nrather pleasant. Virgil's \"Perhaps it will be pleasant to recall these\r\ntrials at some future time\" is not poetic exaggeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Discipline of Pain_.--There is only one way to learn how to bear\r\npain, and that is by practice in it. There might be no necessity for\r\nthis in case life were arranged differently. But all men must die, and\r\ndeath inevitably involves a painful process. Suffering is practically\r\nunavoidable for the majority of men. Even in the midst of every\r\npossible material comfort, cancer may come with all its hideous\r\nconnotations. It is important, then, that everyone should be prepared\r\nto stand some pain. Certain suggestions help in bearing special pains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain Diffusion.--Pain along one nerve may readily become diffused.\r\nThis diffusion will sometimes cause discomfort, and even tenderness,\r\nat a distance from the original seat of the pain. Such diffusion tends\r\nto produce in the patient's mind the idea that the underlying\r\npathological condition is spreading, though it is only a sign that the\r\nnervous system is becoming irritable and easily responding to sensory\r\ndisturbance. Dr. Head's investigations (\"Brain,\" 1893), should be\r\nknown to physicians, and the conclusions that flow from them should be\r\npresented to patients who are sometimes suffering quite as much from\r\ntheir apprehension of the spread of pain, and its significance, as\r\nfrom the discomfort itself. Dr. Head says:\r\n\r\n  If I have an aching tooth, the pain is at first localized to the\r\n  tooth affected. The longer the toothache continues the more I become\r\n  worn out, and the pain is rapidly accentuated by a \"neuralgia,\" that\r\n  is, a pain in the face. The neuralgia is soon accompanied by\r\n  distinct cutaneous tenderness over a definite area on the face\r\n  corresponding to the tooth affected. If I am anemic, or if the pain\r\n  remains untreated until my bodily health is affected, I no longer\r\n  have a localized area of tenderness, but the pain, and with it the\r\n  tenderness, spreads until the whole of one-half of the head and even\r\n  the neck may be intensely tender. Thus at last the pain of an aching\r\n  tooth has produced tenderness over areas which bear no relation to\r\n  the affected organ.\r\n\r\nAs pain can be suppressed by diversion of mind, or concentration of\r\nthought on something that creates great preoccupation, it must not be\r\n{240} forgotten that pain may almost be created by concentration of\r\nattention on certain areas of the body, or certain nerve tracts.\r\nOver-attention will actually make sensations intolerable that are at\r\nfirst quite indifferent, or at least very easy to bear. Sensitive\r\npeople, in the ordinary meaning of that term, are those who are much\r\ngiven to paying attention to their sensations, and who therefore have\r\nmuch to complain of them. There is much in modern life that has the\r\ntendency to produce this sybaritic condition in which even slight\r\ndiscomforts become the sources of almost unbearable annoyance.\r\n\r\nEven where there is no good physical reason for the occurrence of\r\npain, thinking may produce discomfort. The one thing that Freud's work\r\nhas made clear is that in neurotic persons the memory of a mental\r\nshock or strain may be transferred to some portion of the body related\r\nin some way to the shock, and then prove to be the source of\r\nhysterical pains and also of hysterical palsy. The case told by him in\r\nwhich the young woman massaging her father's limbs allows them always\r\nto rest on her own lap during the process, and after his death suffers\r\nfrom an hysterical, painful condition in this region, is a typical\r\nillustration. Her sympathy for her father, accentuated by his\r\nsubsequent death, and her sorrow at a time when her nursing efforts\r\nmade her particularly susceptible, led to an explosion of nervous\r\nenergy along those nerves which had always felt the impress of his\r\nlegs. The hysterical condition resulted. This is an extreme case. In\r\nmilder forms it would be possible to explain many otherwise\r\ninexplicable pains and aches in sensitive young people along these\r\nsame lines.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have seen young women, who had been asked to rub\r\nfather or mother with liniment, complain of tingling pains in their\r\nfingers which were followed by some redness so that one would be\r\ntempted to think of Weir Mitchell's disease, though evidently the\r\npathological cause at work was the slight disturbance of the vasomotor\r\nsystem due to the liniment and the rubbing, emphasized by the\r\nsympathetic feelings, and by the over-attention which this brought\r\nabout. Whenever women have, for a prolonged period, to nurse others in\r\nwhom they are deeply interested, and have to perform some habitual\r\naction that is somewhat fatiguing for them, after the death of the\r\npatient there will not infrequently be the development of hysterical\r\nor neurotic over-sensitiveness in the parts employed. This may give\r\nrise even to an hysterical joint, or to severe neurotic pains. Once\r\nthese cases are recognized, the attention can be diverted from\r\nthemselves and they can be made to understand that their grief and\r\nsympathy are being concentrated on the part and by transfer are\r\nproducing physical manifestations. The pain is not imaginary, but the\r\ncondition will improve as soon as the mind is diverted from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic and Organic Pain.--The distinction between pain due to a\r\nneurosis and to a definite lesion is often difficult to make. If there\r\nis a definite localization of pain, it is almost surely not neurotic,\r\nbut organic. If there are certain positions in which pain is felt\r\nwhile it disappears in others, there is some local inflammatory or\r\ncongestive condition and not mere hypersensitiveness of nerves at the\r\nbottom of it. These positions of maximum pain are important. When pain\r\nradiates a great deal, even though there may be complaint of a\r\nparticular region, it is usually neurotic. If patients are asked to\r\ntell exactly where their pain is, and they indicate its location by a\r\nwave of the hand, it is probable that the condition is neurotic. When\r\nthere is a definite {241} localized point of tenderness with the pain,\r\neven though there may be radiations, usually the condition is based\r\nupon some organic trouble. It must not be forgotten, however, that\r\nslight local troubles may by concentration of mind on them, become\r\nexaggerated and that, in spite of the fact that there is or was at the\r\nbeginning a definite localization of pain with some tenderness, the\r\nneurotic elements may, after a time, become manifest and prove to be\r\nmuch more important than the others.\r\n\r\nPain that is definitely influenced by motion, as by the jarring effect\r\nof walking, or by bending and stooping, is practically always organic.\r\nThe best differential diagnosis between neurotic abdominal conditions\r\nand organic trouble can be made by the help of information obtained in\r\nthis way. If the appendix is inflamed, or the gall bladder infected,\r\nor contains a calculus, or if the kidney has a calculus, these are all\r\nmade worse by movements, by jarring, by stooping as in tying the\r\nshoes, by riding on rough roads, and the like. If patients who suffer\r\nfrom obscure abdominal conditions associated with pain of which they\r\ncomplain much, can, at certain times, indulge with impunity in these\r\nexercises and motions, it is probable that their attacks are neurotic\r\nin character. Especially is this true if the indulgence in these rides\r\nand motions is without effect when they are in pleasant, agreeable\r\ncompany, though there may be some complaints when they have to ride\r\nalone, or under conditions that are less pleasant. If a hint of this\r\ndistinction by which the physician differentiates one form of pain\r\nfrom another is given a neurotic patient, the suggestion will serve\r\nthe purpose of producing complaints whenever the opportunity presents\r\nitself. Such patients take such suggestions, as a rule, without\r\nwishing to deceive, but they become persuaded that their sufferings\r\nare of the character asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\nSECTION VI\r\n\r\n_THE DIGESTIVE TRACT_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MIND ON FOOD DIGESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the progress of biological chemistry, digestion came to be\r\nconsidered a purely chemical process. Now we realize that even more\r\nimportant than the chemical factors of digestion is the individual\r\nliking for particular kinds of food, and the mental attitude of the\r\npatient toward digestion.\r\n\r\nNot only may mental factors interrupt or hamper digestive processes\r\ngenerally but, as the investigations of Pawlow at the Imperial\r\nInstitute of St. Petersburg show, they may modify very materially the\r\nchemical processes within the stomach. If, for investigation purposes,\r\na stomach pouch be experimentally segregated in a dog from the rest of\r\nthe stomach, and the dog be fed food that he has a particular liking\r\nfor, the gastric juice manufactured will be especially strong and\r\neffective. If the food given be less to the dog's liking, the gastric\r\njuice is not nearly so efficient in its activity. Finally, if food be\r\nconsumed for which the dog does not care, but which he takes because\r\nhunger compels him, the gastric juice manufactured for its digestion\r\nis quite weak and the process of digestion is slow. If this is true\r\nfor an animal like the dog, whose psyche is comparatively of much less\r\nimportance than that of human beings, the corresponding influences in\r\nmen and women will be even more emphasized. This is only what common\r\nexperience has always shown us. The human stomach is not a test-tube\r\nin which mere chemical processes are carried on, but its vital\r\nactivity is of great importance. That vital activity depends to a\r\nlarge extent on the state of mind, on the relish with which food is\r\neaten, on the individual likes and dislikes, and on the emotional\r\ncondition during digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrejudices and Digestion.--Perfectly good food materials may become\r\ndifficult or impossible of digestion as the result of learning\r\nsomething about their mode of preparation. In the country this is\r\noften noted, with regard to butter, milk, and even eggs. The story of\r\nthe farmer's wife who wanted to trade her own butter for an equivalent\r\namount made by someone else illustrates the influence of mind over\r\nrelish for food. She was candid enough to say that the reason she\r\nwanted to exchange the butter was that a mouse had been seen in the\r\ncream, and her children could not, therefore, eat it. She took {243}\r\nback home with her exactly the same butter in another crock, and there\r\nwas no further difficulty, though before this the children would have\r\nbeen actually sick if compelled to eat the butter. I once saw a family\r\nof three women who had vomited because they heard that the dishes had\r\nbeen washed in a slop pan, though this proved to be a mistake. Such\r\noccurrences emphasize the necessity for properly predisposing the\r\nmind, and for removing unfavorable suggestion, if digestion is to\r\nproceed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental States and the Stomach.--The typical example of the influence\r\nof the mind on the digestive tract is to be found in the experiences\r\nof Flaubert, the French novelist, while writing \"Madame Bovary.\" When\r\nhe was writing the scene in which he describes the effects of the\r\narsenic which Madame Bovary takes, he himself suffered from\r\npractically all the symptoms due to the drug. In order to describe it\r\nfaithfully he had studied it carefully. He had the pains, the\r\nvomiting, the burning feeling and even the garlicky, metallic taste in\r\nhis mouth. Such an incident is extremely exceptional, yet its\r\npossibility is recognized, and it illustrates how sensitive some\r\npeople are to the action of mental states upon the body, and how large\r\na role a strongly excited imagination can play in producing definite\r\nphysical symptoms. There are many more such realistic imaginations\r\nthan we have, perhaps, been inclined to suspect. It is over these\r\nparticularly that the psychotherapeutist can exert his influence by\r\nhelping to modify the cause of their symptoms, the mental attitude\r\nwhich exists, rather than by trying to change the symptoms which are\r\nonly effects, for diseases must, as far as possible, be treated in\r\ntheir causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disgust and Disturbance of Digestion_.--Max Mueller's story, told in\r\nhis book on \"Language,\" to show how language might have been a human\r\ninvention from imitation of natural sounds, illustrates the influence\r\nof an unfavorable state of mind in disturbing digestion. An\r\nEnglishman, traveling in China, fearful lest he should not be able to\r\nobtain food that he cared for, because of his lack of knowledge of the\r\nlanguage of the country, was rather surprised on his first day's\r\njourney into the interior, to be served with a stew made of some kind\r\nof dark meat that tasted very well indeed and with which he was so\r\nmuch pleased that he asked for a second helping. Just as he was about\r\nto eat the second portion, he thought it well to ask the waiter what\r\nsort of meat it was, as he wished to be able to obtain the same kind\r\nat other places. Calling the waiter to him, he said, pointing to the\r\ndish of meat with a questioning tone, \"Quack, quack?\" The waiter at\r\nonce shook his head and said, \"Ugh! bow wow!\" The Englishman pushed\r\nthe second portion away and got up from the table.\r\n\r\nTinder the same circumstances nearly everybody would feel the same\r\nqualmishness--at least all who had been brought up according to our\r\nWestern notions. Reason has little or nothing to do with it. It is a\r\nquestion of feeling. The dog is much more cleanly in its habits than\r\nthe hog, but we in the West are used to the idea of eating hog-meat\r\njust as they in the East are used to eating dog-meat. The objection,\r\nof course, might be urged that the difference between the hog and the\r\ndog is that we do not eat carnivorous but only herbivorous animals.\r\nBut the slop-fed hogs from the neighborhood of our large cities,\r\nconstituting a goodly portion of those brought to market, eat meat\r\nquite ravenously. They certainly are not exclusively herbivorous.\r\nThere is no {244} principle behind our objection to dog meal\r\nthen--only the unfamiliarity of the idea of eating it.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of patients with digestive disturbances requires a\r\ncareful analysis of the conditions of mind towards foods. If prejudice\r\nexists with regard to certain foods, there will be no relish for them,\r\nand unless these prejudices can be removed, the foods either will not\r\nbe taken, though they represent important nutritional elements, or\r\nelse they must be taken in such small quantities and digested with so\r\nmuch consciousness of their presence and such difficulty as to be a\r\ndisturbing factor for health. Persuasion, the custom of the country,\r\nhabit, training, mean much for this modification of mental attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Custom and Food_.--In recent years many parts of animals, not\r\ngenerally eaten before, have come to be consumed with a relish because\r\nof the removal of prejudices against them. It might be thought that\r\norgans like the kidney, the essential function of which is excretory,\r\nand through which so much of the offensive waste products of the body\r\npass, could not be a relished article of food. But it has become quite\r\na dainty. The liver, owing to the peculiar nature of its function, its\r\nvery special flavor, and the staining with bile, might be expected to\r\nbe objectionable. It is not, but, strange to say, a third organ of the\r\nabdominal cavity, the spleen, which has none of the external\r\nobjectionable features of kidney or liver, is not yet eaten, and most\r\npeople would probably find it rather difficult to eat it. This\r\ndifficulty would result, not because of anything in the organic\r\nsubstance itself, but because of the lack of accustomedness to it.\r\nThere are a number of people who now have trained themselves to eat\r\nit. Such apparently impossible portions of the animal as the\r\nintestines, even those of the hog, are eaten with relish by a great\r\nmany people, though there are others who have never been able to get\r\nused to them. The dainties of some peoples are utterly repulsive to\r\nothers. The French like brains and other special portions of animals\r\nthat are not much eaten by Anglo-Saxons. Fried brains in black butter\r\nsauce are enough to turn the stomach of some people by the very\r\nthought of it, though it is a highly prized dish in the south of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn Italy most visitors eat snail soup with relish before they know\r\nwhat it is. It seems to be a special kind of gumbo soup. Down at\r\nMarseilles, gourmets occasionally eat angle-worms and find them to be\r\na very appetizing dish. In all of these things the question of relish\r\nand peaceful, happy digestion depends entirely on the attitude of\r\nmind. The first men who ate eels must have been looked upon with\r\nconsiderable suspicion by their neighbors as viper eaters, and\r\nprobably they themselves were not comfortable over the feat. It has\r\nbeen said that the first man who ever swallowed an oyster performed as\r\ngreat a feat as any of our important inventors or discoverers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gastric Antipathies_.--To the great majority of mankind the idea of\r\neating horseflesh is repulsive. Numbers of people in various parts of\r\nEurope have found, however, that after the initial repugnance is\r\nconquered, it is quite as pleasant to eat as cow's meat. To my taste,\r\nat least, it is much more palatable than venison or bear meat. At the\r\nbeginning, its sweetish taste has a curious reflex effect. Taken in\r\nconnection with the thought that this is horse meat, the taste is apt\r\nto produce a sensation of nausea. This is readily overcome, though the\r\nfirst time it is necessary to keep constantly inhibiting {245} the\r\nmind from acting unfavorably upon the stomach during the course of\r\neating and digestion. Custom, I learned from many, soon made it quite\r\nas savory as beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Varieties and the Mind_.--How easy it may be to overcome many\r\nprejudices in the matter of food digestion under the stress of\r\nnecessity and the influence of example, was well illustrated during\r\nthe siege of Paris. The Parisians, though a most delicate people in\r\nthe matter of eating, were able to accommodate themselves to the\r\nconditions, and practically every kind of animal was eaten with a\r\nrelish. Before the siege, to most of them it would have seemed quite\r\nimpossible, that they should sit down with complacency to the dishes\r\nwhich afterwards were so appetizing. At the beginning there was a\r\ndefinite attempt to conceal the eating of rats, mice, cats and dogs\r\nunder various names, and by various modes of preparation. But it was\r\nnot long before there was an end of this pretense. The animals in the\r\nzoological garden proved a veritable life-saving store of meat. Every\r\none of them was eaten, people were glad to get them, and paid high\r\nprices for them. Camel steaks, elephant cutlets, lion and tiger stews,\r\nappeared under their own names, even at the banquets of the wealthy.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the mental attitude for meats influencing not only the\r\nrelish for them, but their digestion, is also true for many\r\nvegetables. There are unfavorable suggestions in the minds of many\r\nwith regard to the supposed indigestibility of potatoes, turnips,\r\ncarrots, beans and occasionally with regard to tomatoes, lettuce, or\r\nthe like. A few definite physiological idiosyncrasies against these\r\nvegetables, or certain of them, do actually exist. The attitude of\r\nmind, however, is largely responsible for the discomfort that occurs\r\nafter the consumption of most of them. Patients who ought to consume\r\nmore starchy substances, or whose bowels need the residual materials\r\nthat are contained in these vegetables, for the sake of their effect\r\nupon peristalsis, should be persuaded to take these vegetables, first\r\nin small quantities and then in gradually increasing amounts. Many of\r\nthem can thus be brought to a diet at once more nutritious and more\r\nlikely to help out intestinal function. Their objection to them is\r\nusually but a fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenuine Food Idiosyncrasies.--There are certain genuine idiosyncrasies\r\nwith a physiological basis which prevent the taking of certain kinds\r\nof food, or cause disturbance if they are taken, but these are rare.\r\nTheir presence should never be considered as demonstrated by\r\nsubjective signs alone for these are eminently fallacious. In certain\r\ncases, however, so rare as to be almost always curiosities in medical\r\npractice, there are definite objective symptoms of the idiosyncrasy.\r\nThese consist of urticarial rashes, tendencies to vomiting, or\r\ndiarrhea, or both. Sometimes these result from the most bland and\r\nnutritious of foods. I have notes of the cases of two children--whose\r\nfather could not eat eggs without vomiting--and to whom fresh eggs fed\r\nat the age of two and three years, always produced this same effect.\r\nEven small portions of egg would cause it. It mattered not how the egg\r\nwas prepared, nor even whether it was carefully concealed in custard\r\nor in cake provided there was a certain amount of it, the food eaten\r\nwith it would be vomited. There are many such idiosyncrasies for shell\r\nfish, cheese, and such fruits as strawberries, pineapples,\r\npomegranates and the like, but they are demonstrated by objective\r\nsigns. But by far the greater number of food dislikes are entirely\r\n{246} subjective and the subjective feelings can probably always be\r\novercome by habit and training.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood Dislikes.--_Milk_.--Nothing makes more clear the absolute\r\ndominion of the mind over the stomach than the likes and dislikes of\r\npeople for various kinds of milk. Most Americans can take cow's milk\r\nwith good relish, though there are a few to whom it is distasteful. In\r\nthis country we have not had much experience with the milk of other\r\nanimals. Even goat's milk is not commonly used. The very thought of\r\ntaking it disturbs many people, and to take it with other food would\r\nalmost surely produce disturbance of digestion. I have seen people\r\nwhile traveling quite upset over the discovery that goat's milk had\r\nbeen put into their tea or coffee. Mare's milk is commonly used in\r\nsome parts of Europe and in many parts of Asia, but it would be quite\r\nimpossible to most of our people. Sheep's milk is used in some places.\r\nAss's milk is commonly used in parts of Asia and may be obtained in\r\nSpain and is said to be less likely to disagree with children in\r\nsummer than cow's milk. Most American mothers would rather not hear of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of the milk products. Some people find certain\r\nkinds of cheese quite out of the question though other people relish\r\nthem. It requires special training, not of stomach but of mind, to\r\nenable one to eat certain cheese, though once the habit has been\r\nacquired such articles are delicious. It is only in recent years that\r\nsome forms of cheese with greenish tints have become popular in\r\nAmerica. To serve them at a dinner a generation ago disgusted many\r\npeople. Now a dinner does not seem complete without them.\r\n\r\nThe beverages of various countries illustrate this same principle. The\r\nwines the Spaniards care for are not palatable to the Italians, and\r\n_vice versa_. Beer, as the result of familiarity, is now drunk\r\neverywhere in Europe, but when it was first introduced into Italy from\r\nGermany, it was considered impossible to understand how anybody could\r\ntake it and pretend that its taste was pleasant. The question is said\r\nto have been once asked of one of the Congregations at Rome whether it\r\nwas permissible to take beer on fast days. The Cardinals who tasted it\r\ndeclared that not only did it seem to them permissible but that it was\r\na mortification to drink it and therefore it was proper Lenten\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eggs_.--Many people have a supposed natural repugnance for eggs which\r\nthey are sure indicates that these are not good for them. As a result,\r\nthe physician gets all sorts of stories with regard to the supposed\r\neffects of eggs. One person tells you that more than two eggs a day\r\nmakes him bilious. Another will tell you that they are too heavy for\r\nhim. A third will tell you that they are distinctly constipating. A\r\nfourth will tell you that they produce a tendency to diarrhea. Here,\r\nas with regard to milk, the experience of the tuberculosis sanatoria\r\nhas shown that there are but few people who cannot, when properly\r\npersuaded and when eggs are given in various forms, take from four to\r\nsix eggs in the day without injury, and even without inconvenience. In\r\nthese cases, it is largely a matter of mental attitude towards the\r\nfood. In many instances, it will be found that the disinclination\r\nbegan in some experience in childhood when an egg was not very good,\r\nor when it was served insufficiently cooked, or when, perhaps, eggs\r\nalways cooked one way were made a staple of the diet for a\r\nconsiderable period. There are over one hundred {247} ways of cooking\r\neggs and this variety of preparation will often make them palatable,\r\nand nearly always digestible.\r\n\r\nOver and over again I have seen people who had thought that eggs made\r\nthem bilious, and who accordingly had for long refused to eat them,\r\nput in circumstances (from tuberculosis, diabetes, or obesity) where\r\neggs had to form a considerable portion of the diet. Then there was no\r\ndifficulty about eating and digesting eggs. In three cases in my\r\nexperience patients with an objection they thought constitutional,\r\ndeveloped glycosuria, and then nearly all their desserts were\r\ncustards, and eggs became a standing dish in their daily diet. In\r\nevery case not only was there no trouble, but they got to like the\r\neggs and wondered why they should ever have had any prejudice against\r\nthem. Two of the patients were women, the third a man who had not\r\ntouched eggs for many years. His wife's comment was: \"Eggs always made\r\nhim bilious when he did not take them, but now that he is taking them\r\nfreely they no longer make him bilious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Changes and Digestion.--The change that has come over the\r\npublic mind with regard to sour milk is a typical illustration of how\r\nmuch a difference in the mental attitude towards a food product may\r\nmean for its satisfactory consumption by many people. Sour milk,\r\nthough many farmers and working people thought it a pleasant acid\r\nbeverage, was for long looked upon as a product fit at most to be fed\r\nto the pigs, if, indeed, there might not be question even of the\r\nadvisability of this. Only the very poor who craved the nutritious\r\nvalue there was in it, continued to take it to any extent. Even if the\r\nmilk still tasted sweet, but broke when it went into the tea, that was\r\nenough to make it quite impossible for many sensitive stomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactic Acid as a Bactericide_.--Then came Metchnikoff's announcement\r\nthat his studies showed sour milk to be an extremely valuable food\r\nmaterial, but much more than that, an important auxiliary for the\r\nlessening of microbic life in the intestines. He seemed to be able to\r\ndemonstrate that a great many bacteria, whose products, absorbed from\r\nthe intestines, hastened that process of deterioration in the tissues\r\nthat we call old age, were inhibited when sour milk or lactic acid\r\nbacteria were present. The general health of the person who took sour\r\nmilk was, as a consequence, much better. Not only this, but processes\r\nof deterioration being lessened, prolonged life and even old age could\r\nbe promised to those who drank sour milk in sufficient quantities.\r\nMetchnikoff had been brought to the study of this question by what he\r\nhad seen on the Steppes of Russia. Among the nomad tribes a principal\r\npart of whose diet consists of soured mare's milk, he found a large\r\nproportion of very old people. In looking for the reason for this\r\ndisproportionate longevity, he came to the conclusion that the sour\r\nmilk had something to do with it. Then laboratory observations and\r\nexperiments as to the influence of the bacillus, that causes the\r\nsouring of the milk, on the growth of other bacteria, and especially\r\nsuch bacteria as are usually found in the human digestive tract,\r\nseemed to show that the lactic bacteria had a strong inhibitory effect\r\non nearly all the pathologic flora of the intestines.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these studies, all the world is now quite willing to\r\ntake its share of sour milk. We no longer hear the complaint that\r\nuncomfortable feelings in the digestive tract are the result of taking\r\nmilk that was a little sour.\r\n\r\n{248}\r\n\r\nSince this doctrine of Metchnikoff's has come to be popularly known,\r\nfewer patients have insisted that they could not take milk in such\r\nquantities as the physician thought desirable for them. Before that, a\r\npersuasion with regard to the ease with which milk becomes\r\ncontaminated with microbes, and the dread that it might thus be a\r\nsource of disease, or at least of disturbance of digestion, made it\r\nvery difficult of digestion for many people. Now that they have a good\r\nauthority who insists that, even if it should become somewhat soured\r\nin the ordinary way, this, far from making it a pathological article\r\nof diet, rather adds to its value from a therapeutic standpoint, has\r\nchanged the attitude of mind of these people.\r\n\r\nWe need a similar feeling with regard to eggs in order that they may\r\nbe eaten by many people who now refuse them because they fear the\r\npossible evil results of taking even a slightly tainted egg. Our\r\nrecent pure food investigations have shown that the bakers in our\r\nlarge cities have been for many years using canned eggs, and that\r\nthese would be quite impossible of consumption except disguised as\r\nthey are in the midst of baker's products. Sometimes these eggs have\r\nbeen kept for several months before being canned. All the cold storage\r\neggs that cannot be disposed of otherwise are thus treated. In spite\r\nof the common use of these canned eggs by a large proportion of the\r\ncity population no serious results have come from them. The change\r\nthat comes over eggs in time does not apparently spoil their nutritive\r\nquality, but only disturbs their taste. The main element in the change\r\nis the production of hydrogen sulphide. This gas has a very unpleasing\r\nodor, but its presence is not of pathological significance. This gas\r\nis a common ingredient in those mineral waters that are known as\r\nsulphur waters, and that have a reputation for curing many forms of\r\ndigestive disturbance, especially chronic cases of nervous\r\nindigestion. What is true of sour milk, then, would seem to be true of\r\neggs that have been, to some degree, spoiled, and at least no serious\r\nresults may be expected from them. If serious results were to be\r\nexpected, we should have had many evil reports of them in recent\r\nyears. Whether considerations of this kind will help patients, who\r\nneed to get over qualminess with regard to eggs, because they are\r\nalways suspicious lest they should not be fresh, will depend a good\r\ndeal on the suggestive value of such information as presented by the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another Organic Acid_.--Sauerkraut has shared the fate of sour milk,\r\nand because of its acid bacteria has been accepted by Metchnikoff as\r\nan ally. Yet sauerkraut used to be thought quite out of the question\r\nfor invalids, especially those suffering from digestive disturbances.\r\nI recall the case of an old German shoemaker who had lived very much\r\non sauerkraut when he was a young man and then, having made money in\r\nthe manufacture of shoes, had not had much of it for thirty years,\r\npleading with me, when he was old and it was rather hard to get\r\nanything to stay on his stomach, that he should be allowed to have\r\nsauerkraut. On the principle that what a man craves is usually what\r\ndoes him good, I allowed it. The physician with whom I was in\r\nconsultation was perfectly sure there would be trouble, and the family\r\nwere confident that his physicians evidently had given up all hope and\r\nwere quite ready to yield to his caprices and let him take anything\r\nthat he cared for. He not only took the sauerkraut without any\r\ntrouble, though I must confess to some misgivings myself (for I am of\r\nthose who unfortunately do not care for it and, therefore, {249} was\r\nprejudiced), but after having eaten a large plateful of sauerkraut\r\ntwice a day for several days, he began to crave other things that\r\nwould not stay down before, retained them well, digested them without\r\ndifficulty, and got over that attack of indigestion and lived for\r\nseveral years afterwards. His own mental attitude was a better index\r\nthan our supposed knowledge, though science has now come to confirm\r\nhis state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacon and a Change in Suggestion_,--Another food material with regard\r\nto which there has been a complete change of view in recent years, is\r\nbacon and hog products generally. Pork in all forms used to be\r\nconsidered quite indigestible, and was one of the first things that\r\npeople suffering from indigestion--or the fear of it--eliminated from\r\ntheir diet. Now we know how valuable a food product it is, especially\r\nfor those inclined to suffer from constipation, or who are under\r\nweight. Many people still look surprised when advised to eat it\r\nregularly. Here we have a typical example of the change in the mental\r\nattitude toward a particular article of food bringing about a\r\ncorresponding difference as regards not only the appetite for it, but\r\nalso its digestibility. Many persons, who used to have no appetite for\r\nbreakfast, now find that after eating a crisp piece or two of bacon,\r\nthey develop an appetite for other foods. Bacon has become a fetish\r\nfor some people and is considered a help, not a detriment to\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nI recall a case in which I had very nearly the same experience with\r\nbacon as I related with regard to sauerkraut. The patient was an\r\nelderly woman, probably nearly ninety years of age, who, because of a\r\ncrippling deformity, had not been able to get outside of the house for\r\nmany years. She sat in a wheel chair, transported herself from one end\r\nof an apartment to another, spent most of her time by the window, but\r\nwas very helpful in many little things about the house and occupied\r\nher hands with knitting and sewing. In spite of her condition, she was\r\ncheerful, pleasant, happy, and all her life had had a good digestion,\r\nher only trouble being a tendency to asthma as she grew old. I came\r\nback to the city after a summer vacation to find that she was not\r\nexpected to live because nothing would stay on her stomach. She was\r\nsinking, and the end seemed not far off. I was asked to see her more\r\nbecause I had been her regular physician for some years, and it was\r\nthought that it would console her to see me than with any real hope of\r\nbetterment. It had been extremely hot weather and this seemed to be an\r\nunfortunate circumstance. At my visit, I asked her if there was\r\nanything that she cared for. She shook her head and yet there seemed a\r\nhesitancy. I urged her to tell me if there was anything that she\r\nwanted, but only after considerable urging did she venture to say that\r\nthere was something, only that she knew that she could not have it.\r\nPutting her thumb on the top of her little finger, she said, \"Oh, I\r\nwould like so much to have just a teenie-weenie bit of bacon.\" I said\r\nthat she should certainly have it. Then taking courage, she asked if\r\nshe could not have a little cabbage with it. I said, \"Certainly.\" Her\r\nfriends thought that it was just a yielding to one of the last wishes\r\nof an invalid with the idea that nothing could much harm her, since\r\nshe was so near the end. She had eaten cabbage and bacon all her life;\r\nshe ate it again with a relish, and in spite of the heat kept it down\r\nand digested it well. She had bacon and cabbage next day, and for\r\nseveral days; she gradually got strong and lived several more years of\r\nher happy contented life.\r\n\r\n\r\n{250}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION AND UNFAVORABLE STATES OF MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nIndigestion is the characteristic disease of our time. There are few\r\nmen or women over thirty who have not suffered from it. The working\r\nclasses are spared the most, but with the frequent suggestions in the\r\nnewspapers and the introspection which has become so common,\r\nindigestion is often complained of even among them. Sedentary\r\noccupations, involving mental work and little physical effort, seem\r\nespecially to predispose to some form of indigestion. Few of those who\r\nlive what is called the intellectual life escape suffering from some\r\nof its symptoms. Not infrequently men have been hale and hearty\r\nspecimens of muscular manhood when they took up some profession which\r\ncompels them to be indoors, yet before long, they begin to complain of\r\ndiscomfort after eating, of tendencies to constipation, of headaches,\r\nof depression, of incapacity for mental effort after meals, and all\r\nthese symptoms are attributed to the almost universal disease,\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the general attitude of mind to have a great effect\r\non digestive processes, and the symptom-complex which is called\r\nindigestion, or dyspepsia, is probably much more dependent on the mind\r\nthan on any other factor. In many cases it is primarily due to\r\nover-concentration of attention on digestion. In others it is due to\r\nover-occupation with business, worry, or serious thought at times when\r\nthe digestive processes need all the energy. In many cases so-called\r\ndyspepsia is due to an unfavorable state of mind toward digestive\r\nprocesses in general, because of unfavorable auto-suggestion.\r\nNormally, stomachic sensations reach our consciousness only under\r\nspecial circumstances. When, however, much attention is paid to them,\r\neven the slight sensations that occur with normal digestion may rise\r\nabove the threshold of consciousness and become subjects of\r\nsolicitude. If they do so, then the increased attention likely to be\r\npaid to them surely interferes with function and changes what may be\r\nmerely physiological into pathological processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Suggestions.--An unfortunate state of the public mind with\r\nregard to indigestion in general has been cultivated by many\r\npublications on the subject. People dread its occurrence, and fear\r\nthat the first sign of discomfort in their gastric region is a signal\r\nof the beginning of a progressive affection. They fear the worst, and\r\nthe consequence is a reaction quite out of proportion to the gravity\r\nof the ailment. So much has been said particularly of mistakes in diet\r\nthat just as soon as they feel, or often rather think they feel, the\r\nfirst symptom of beginning dyspepsia they begin to study how to modify\r\ntheir diet so as to prevent its progress. They begin to eliminate\r\nvarious supposedly indigestible foods. Usually among the first things\r\nthat are greatly reduced in quantity, or are entirely eliminated, are\r\nthe fats and certain of the starchy vegetables. Because of expressions\r\nheard and read as to its harmfulness, the fearful ones also are\r\nusually timorous about taking fluid at meal times. As this is about\r\nthe only time when they are likely to take fluid, unless it be summer,\r\nthey soon suffer for lack of it. Eating only food that {251} leaves\r\nlittle residue and taking insufficient fluid leads to constipation.\r\nThis reacts still further to disturb digestion, and to interfere with\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nThis leads to further reduction in the amount and variety of food,\r\nwith the consequence that insufficient nutrition to supply energy for\r\nbodily needs is taken. The digestive system gives up to the body as\r\nmuch as it possibly can, not only of the food materials to be\r\nconsumed, but of its own substance. Thus it weakens its own vitality,\r\nwith a lessening of appetite and of digestive power. Hence, a vicious\r\ncircle of change is instituted, the consequences of which are easy to\r\nsee. After a time the patient is taking only the blandest foods,\r\nconstipation has become an important element in the case, and the mind\r\nis constantly occupied with solicitude over the digestion and the\r\nchoice of materials at meals.\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary Suggestion and Digestion.--Hudson, in \"The Law of Mental\r\nMedicine,\" insisted on the necessity for not suggesting to children\r\nthe possibility of indigestion of various substances, for that is\r\nalmost sure to disturb digestive functions. Children sometimes hear\r\nthe remark that father or mother cannot take a certain article of food\r\nbecause it disagrees with them. The imitative faculty of the child is\r\nsure to be aroused, with the consequence that this particular food is\r\nnot eaten with relish nor given a fair show for digestion, and will be\r\nthe source of some stomach disturbance. Not infrequently substances\r\nthus spoken of are among those that are especially likely to do\r\nchildren good, such as milk or eggs, or occasionally butter. The harm\r\ndone by the remark may, therefore, even be serious, for these foods\r\nshould constitute a large proportion of the child's diet. Indeed, an\r\nexcellent prophylactic in the matter of indigestion is to prevent as\r\nfar as possible all conversation at table about the indigestibility of\r\nfood. Unfortunately, this has, in late years particularly, become a\r\nfavorite subject of table conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransferred Feelings.--Professor Cohnheim called attention to the fact\r\nthat many uncomfortable feelings are likely to be mistranslated\r\nbecause they are referred to organs with which there is nothing wrong.\r\nWhenever this function is hampered in any way, there are many\r\nuncomfortable feelings associated with the digestion of food. The\r\ncustom has been to refer the origin of all these to the stomach.\r\nCohnheim thinks that it is much more likely that they really originate\r\nin the intestines, though the rule has been to take the patient's\r\nfeelings as an indication and to treat the stomach. It is not an\r\nunreasonable thing for patients to be deceived as to the exact\r\nlocation of discomfort. Even in so acute a process as toothache it is\r\npossible to mistake the particular tooth that is giving trouble, and,\r\nas dentists know, a perfectly quiescent tooth is sometimes blamed for\r\npain that is coming from another. Fillings have been removed, teeth\r\nhave been treated, good teeth have been extracted, because patients\r\ninsisted on the significance of their feelings in such cases. The\r\nstomach must not always be blamed. Sometimes the only source of\r\nsupposed gastric discomfort is the constipation present which is\r\nusually easy to relieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gastric Reflexes_.--While the mind may serve to disturb digestion and\r\nproduce gastric discomfort by over-attention, there are many reflexes\r\nthat center in the digestive tract, the origin of which may be in\r\ndistant organs. Fright often produces a sensation as of cold at the\r\npit of the stomach. Looking down from a height has the same effect in\r\nsome persons. Discordant noises {252} have the same effect on people\r\nof sensitive hearing and certain reactions to touch may be similarly\r\nreflected. There are a number of affections which produce\r\nuncomfortable reflex sensations in the gastric region. This is the\r\nhypochondrium of the olden time. Whenever feelings were complained of,\r\nfor which there was no actual basis in the hypochondriac region, it\r\ncame to be spoken of as hypochondriasis, a word that has an innuendo\r\nof imaginativeness about it. Dr. Head's studies with regard to the\r\ntransfer of sensations from one portion of the body to the other, show\r\nus that there is a good physical reason in reflexes for many of these\r\ncomplaints. An explanation of this to patients will often relieve\r\ntheir minds greatly and make their discomfort seem much less serious.\r\nDr. Head said:\r\n\r\n  With orchitis or prostatitis, we also occasionally find that the\r\n  patient complains of a pain at the epigastrium, representing the\r\n  stomach area. This is put down to hypochondriasis and if it occurs\r\n  in a woman as a consequence of ovaritis, she is said to be\r\n  hysterical. But this phenomena is no more \"hysterical,\" whatever\r\n  that may mean, than is the reference of the pain and the tenderness\r\n  of an aching tooth to the back of the head or the shoulder.\r\n  [Transfers which have been observed actually to take place.]\r\n\r\n  This is the phenomenon I have been accustomed to call\r\n  \"generalization\" of visceral pain and tenderness, and is of such\r\n  common occurrence as to form a very important factor in the clinical\r\n  picture of many diseases.\r\n\r\n  The order in which generalization takes place, leads one to speak of\r\n  the relative \"specific resistance\" of the centers for the sensory\r\n  impulses from various organs. No very definite rule can be laid down\r\n  to govern every case, but each case must be considered on its\r\n  merits. However, the area which appears most easily on a woman, as a\r\n  secondary affection, is the tenth dorsal; then, perhaps the sixth\r\n  dorsal, or inframammary, and then the various gastric areas,\r\n  beginning first with the ensiform or seventh dorsal. In a man the\r\n  tenth dorsal appears rather less readily while the ensiform appears\r\n  with great ease.\r\n\r\nAffections of other organs within the abdomen may produce like\r\nreflexes. A chronic appendicitis, for instance, will often be\r\nreflected in the stomach area. So will the presence of gallstones, or\r\nof disturbances of the biliary mucosa. Loose kidney often produces\r\nstomach reflexes. Any disturbance of the intestinal function will\r\nproduce gastric irritation and inhibition of digestion. Most of the\r\nother primary conditions are more serious. Often the patient is aware\r\nof their existence, and it is a relief to him to find that the stomach\r\nsymptoms are not the index of further pathological development, but\r\nonly reflex conditions. This of itself does much to make the condition\r\nmore bearable.\r\n\r\nPatients who are suffering from symptoms of indigestion often have\r\nareas of their skin surface that are at least very sensitive, if not\r\nactually tender. They feel the pressure of their clothing over a\r\nparticular portion of the body, usually on the left side of the\r\nabdomen somewhat above, though at times also below the umbilicus.\r\nThough not painful, as a rule, it is decidedly uncomfortable and\r\nproduces a constant desire to loosen the clothing, or lift it from the\r\npart. Mere loosening, it is soon found, does no good, because the\r\nclothing continues to touch the skin and it is not the constriction or\r\npressure but the contact that produces the discomfort. Sometimes there\r\nis a distinct lesion of the stomach. This cutaneous hyperasthesia may,\r\nindeed, rise to the height of extreme tenderness in cases of gastric\r\nulcer, or the like. But there is no {253} doubt that a certain amount\r\nof this sensation is present with all functional disturbances of the\r\nstomach and that the reflex sensitiveness of superficial nerves is\r\nonly what might be expected from what we now know of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discomfort and Digestion_.--Just as certain food materials disagree\r\nbecause of the state of mind, so certain feelings in the gastric\r\nregion, even in the skin surface, sometimes disturb digestion and lead\r\nto changes of the diet unwarranted by the condition. Patients conclude\r\nthat, if the skin is so tender, then the underlying organs, the\r\ndisturbance of which causes this tenderness, must be in a serious\r\ncondition. For these patients the explanation of the present state of\r\nour knowledge as to reflex disturbance of sensory nerves will be of\r\ntherapeutic value. They must be taught that pain is reflected from one\r\nnerve branch to another, and is not communicated by continuity of\r\ntissue, or by sympathetic affection from the stomach mucous membrane\r\nthrough the stomach wall, and then from the abdominal wall to the skin\r\nsurface. This knowledge will prove reassuring.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Energy.--After this mental occupation with digestion\r\nitself, which by consuming nervous energy lessens the amount available\r\nfor digestive purposes, probably the most common factor in the\r\nproduction of indigestion is the concentration of mind on serious\r\nsubjects, while digestion is proceeding. An old English maxim is that\r\nsome people have not enough brains to run their liver and their\r\nbusiness. The liver in old-time pathology was considered the most\r\nimportant of the abdominal organs and was taken by metathesis for them\r\nall. Most of us have only a limited amount of vital energy and,\r\nusually, we can accomplish only one thing well at a time. If we try to\r\ndo intellectual work while digestion is going on, both the\r\nintellectual work and the digestion suffer. If we persist in\r\nattempting to do both, we will surely disturb the digestive organs and\r\nwe may bring about grave neurotic disturbances in the central nervous\r\nsystem. We may be able for a time to accomplish the two things at the\r\nsame time, but it will not be long before evil results will be seen.\r\nNervous, high-strung people should be reminded of Lincoln's anecdote\r\nof the little steamboat on the Mississippi which had not steam enough\r\nto blow its whistle and run its paddle wheels at the same time, so\r\nthat whenever the engineer wanted to blow the whistle he stopped the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nIndeed, much of the indigestion that we see is due to this dissipation\r\nof energy through the attempt to do two things at the same time. Those\r\nwho live the intellectual life are the most frequent sufferers.\r\nWorries and anxieties that are allowed to trouble the mind during\r\ndigestion time are sure to disturb digestion eventually because they\r\nuse up energy that is needed for physical purposes.\r\n\r\nA change of environment that takes us away from the ordinary cares of\r\nlife, is often sufficient to make all the difference between ease of\r\ndigestion and extremely uncomfortable dyspepsia. By worry the mind\r\napparently becomes short-circuited on itself and uses up a large\r\namount of the available energy in nervous impulses that do not find\r\ntheir way outside the central nervous system at all, but are used in\r\ndisturbing associated nerve cells. Just as soon as a change of scene\r\nand occupation calls for a different set of thoughts and other\r\nfeelings, energy is released for work outside the central nervous\r\nsystem itself, digestion begins to improve, and in a comparatively\r\nshort time what seemed to be a serious gastric disturbance, disappears\r\nalmost completely.\r\n\r\n{254}\r\n\r\n_Lack of Sleep Repair_.--In my own experience one of the most\r\ncharacteristic stigmata of these cases of indigestion which are due to\r\nexhaustion through other channels of vital energy, is that they feel\r\nmuch better in the evening than in the morning. They are, therefore,\r\ntempted to stay up late and so do not get the necessary rest. Their\r\nexcuse for late hours is that they need recreation. To that excuse I\r\nhave no objection. They do need more recreation; they need more hours\r\nduring which their minds are absolutely free from business cares; but\r\nthese hours must not be taken from their sleep, for they need rest\r\neven more than recreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worries and Irritations During Meals_.--The presence of worries or\r\nirritation during meals or shortly after, as well as unfavorable\r\nstates of mind towards digestion itself, and occupation of mind with\r\nserious affairs during digestion, are likely to be sources of serious\r\ndisturbance of digestion. A fright, a fit of anger, nagging,\r\nirritation, or any disturbing emotions, may hamper digestion. An\r\nexperiment that is sometimes performed in the physiological laboratory\r\non the cat nicely illustrates this. If the laboratory cat is fed some\r\ndainty that it likes, mixed with bismuth in order that its stomach and\r\nintestines may be made opaque to the x-rays, and then be examined by\r\nmeans of the fluoroscope, the peristaltic processes of digestion by\r\nwhich food is mixed in the stomach, passed out into the intestines,\r\nand by which intestinal digestion is stimulated, may be seen to go on\r\nvery interestingly. If, now, the cat is made to arch its back, and\r\nmanifest the usual signs of extreme irritation, the process of\r\ndigestion is interrupted, and will not be resumed till some time after\r\nthe cat quiets down. The lesson is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC TREATMENT OF DIGESTIVE CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nIf discouragement and solicitude make a healthy stomach digest\r\nimperfectly, the same mental factors will play an even more serious\r\nrole with a diseased stomach. Certainly without the mind's aid, there\r\ncan be little hope of such a reactive vital resistance as will enable\r\nthe organ to recover from the organic ailment.\r\n\r\nSo many cases of indigestion are due to mental persuasion alone, that\r\nafter a time there is danger that the physician may be over-confident\r\nin his diagnosis, and may occasionally overlook serious organic\r\nlesions. Before attempting psychotherapy in these cases, the physician\r\nmust assure himself that no organic lesion is present. This is\r\nparticularly true for cancer in the middle-aged and ulcer in young\r\nwomen. At times these lesions are latent except for certain vague\r\ndigestive symptoms. After careful consideration it is generally\r\npossible to make a definite decision, and then the indications are\r\nclear. Even when an organic lesion is present, a modification of the\r\nmental attitude will often be of great service to the patient.\r\nSuggestion will even make a cancer patient gain in weight, though one\r\nmust be careful of that very fact because the apparent improvement may\r\noccasion delay until the case becomes inoperable.\r\n\r\nOnce the presence of these serious organic lesions of the stomach can\r\nbe {255} excluded, the bringing of influence to bear on the patient's\r\nmind for the improvement of his digestion is indicated. It is true\r\nthat there are certain reflex disturbances of the digestive tract\r\nconsequent upon affections of other abdominal organs. Chronic lesions\r\nof the appendix may produce stomach symptoms as will also pathological\r\nconditions of the biliary tract. A floating kidney, various affections\r\nof the pelvic organs, especially in women, and of the urinary organs\r\nin men are sometimes said to produce seriously depressing effects upon\r\nthe stomach. Where this occurs, the first indications undoubtedly are\r\nto put the patient into as good condition as possible before making\r\nany decision. Where a lesion of the stomach itself exists suggestions\r\nwith regard to the increase of diet may do harm. They will not do harm\r\nin the reflex conditions, and so patients can be brought into better\r\nphysical condition. As a consequence of this, their symptoms in other\r\norgans will often disappear. In case the symptoms do not disappear the\r\npatients are in better condition to stand and react from operative\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding as to the character of the stomach symptoms we must\r\nmake sure that other important organs are not affected. Most cases of\r\ntuberculosis begin with stomach symptoms, which often make their\r\nappearance before there is cough or any definite localizing symptom of\r\nthe disease. Often there is only a disturbance of pulse, and perhaps a\r\nslightly increased range of temperature. If the patient has been\r\nexposed to tuberculosis, a careful investigation of the lungs should\r\nbe made. Any disturbance of the liver or pancreas (especially cancer)\r\nwill almost surely give rise to stomach symptoms. Latent cancer in any\r\npart of the body, however, will, by its depressing toxemia, produce\r\nloss of appetite, consequent loss of weight, and a number of symptoms\r\nthat are sure to be referred to the stomach. I have seen cancer of the\r\nprostate, without disturbing urination, produce such symptoms for\r\nmonths before it was recognized. I have seen cancer of the rectum in a\r\ncomparatively young woman treated as piles, without an examination,\r\nthe development of the piles being attributed to the gastro-intestinal\r\nsymptoms which were consequent upon the presence of the cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL INFLUENCE IN DYSPEPSIA AND INDIGESTION\r\n\r\nIt is often said that this teaching as to the effect of the mind on\r\ndigestion and its eminent usefulness for the treatment of dyspeptic\r\nconditions, is due to the attention that has been attracted to this\r\nsubject as a consequence of the prominence of Eddyism, New Thought,\r\nMental Healing, and the like. There are absolutely no good grounds for\r\nany such assertion. Here in America, more than twenty-five years ago,\r\nbefore there was any question of the modern mental healing movements,\r\nour greatest medical clinician, Dr. Austin Flint, expressed himself\r\nvery emphatically with regard to mental influence over digestion, and\r\nto solicitude of mind as one of the most frequent etiological factors\r\nin dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nDr. Flint was thoroughly scientific in his medical observations, was\r\nno seeker after notoriety, and he was reading his paper before the\r\nolder physicians of the period, and all of those who took part in that\r\nfirst meeting of the New York Medical Association strove to make their\r\npapers of scientific value. His words, then, must carry great weight:\r\n\r\n{256}\r\n\r\n  Dyspepsia formerly prevailed chiefly among those who adopted, to a\r\n  greater or less extent, the foregoing maxims [the finicky rules of\r\n  dyspeptics which he deprecates and corrects as quoted later in this\r\n  chapter]. It was comparatively rare among those who did not live in\r\n  accordance with dietetic rules. The affection is much less prevalent\r\n  now than heretofore, because these maxims are much less in vogue.\r\n  The dyspeptics of the present day are chiefly those who undertake to\r\n  exemplify more or less of these maxims. It seems to me, therefore, a\r\n  fair inference, that dyspepsia may result from an attempt to\r\n  regulate diet by rules which have for their object the prevention of\r\n  the affection which they actually produce. It is to be added that an\r\n  important causative element involved in the practical adoption of\r\n  these rules is the attention thereby given to digestion. It is by\r\n  introspection and constant watchfulness of the functions of the\r\n  stomach, that the mind exerts a direct influence in the causation of\r\n  this affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDietetic Rules of a Former Day.--In order to make definite just what\r\nwere the views of the olden times which he deprecates, he stated them\r\nbriefly and forcibly:\r\n\r\n  The views generally entertained, at the time to which I have\r\n  referred, largely by physicians and almost universally by\r\n  non-medical sanitarians, may be summed up in a few maxims as\r\n  follows: Eat only at stated periods, twice or thrice daily, and\r\n  never between meals, no matter how great may be the desire for food.\r\n  Never eat late in the evening or shortly before bedtime. In the\r\n  choice of articles of diet, carefully select those which reason and\r\n  personal experience have shown to be best digested; and never yield\r\n  to the weakness of eating any article of food simply because it is\r\n  acceptable to the palate. In order to avoid the temptation of\r\n  overeating, let the articles of food be coarse rather than\r\n  attractive, and eschew all the devices of the cuisine. Always leave\r\n  the table hungry. Study personal idiosyncrasies, and never indulge\r\n  in kinds of food which, although wholesome for most persons, are\r\n  injurious to a few who are peculiarly organized. With reference to\r\n  this last maxim, bear in mind that \"what is one man's meat is\r\n  another man's poison.\" In order to secure, as effectually as\r\n  possible, a proper restriction in the quantity of food, it was\r\n  recommended by some physicians and to some extent practiced, that\r\n  every article be carefully weighed at meal times, and that a certain\r\n  quantity by weight be never exceeded. Vegetarianism or Grahamism was\r\n  advocated and practiced by many. Total abstinence from drink was\r\n  considered by a few as a good sanitary measure, compelling the body\r\n  to derive the needed fluids exclusively from fruits, vegetables, and\r\n  other solid articles of diet. Restriction in the amount of drink, as\r\n  far as practicable with regard to the power of endurance, was very\r\n  generally deemed important, so as not to dilute the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nWhen to his question, \"Do you regulate your diet,\" the patient\r\nanswered promptly and often emphatically in the affirmative, Dr. Flint\r\ninsisted always: \"This is a good reason for your having dyspepsia; I\r\nnever knew a dyspeptic get well who undertook to regulate his diet.\"\r\nWhen the patient asks then, \"How am I to be guided,\" the reply is,\r\n\"Not by theoretical views of alimentation and indigestion, no matter\r\nhow much they appear to be in accord with physiological and\r\npathological doctrines, but by the appetite, the palate and common\r\nsense.\" He then goes on to answer certain other objections that\r\npatients are wont to urge, and says:\r\n\r\n  But the patient will be likely to say, \"Am I not to be guided by my\r\n  own experience and avoid articles of food which I have found to\r\n  disagree with my digestion?\" The answer is, that personal experience\r\n  in dietetics is extremely fallacious. An article of diet which may\r\n  cause inconvenience of indigestion to-day may be followed by a sense\r\n  of comfort and will be readily digested to-morrow. A variety of\r\n  circumstances may render the digestion of any article of food taken\r\n  at a {257} particular meal labored or imperfect. As a rule articles\r\n  which agree with most persons do not disagree with any, except from\r\n  casual or accidental circumstances, and from the expectation, in the\r\n  mind of the patient, that they will disagree. Without denying that\r\n  there are dietetic idiosyncrasies, they are vastly fewer than is\r\n  generally supposed; and, in general, it is fair to regard supposed\r\n  idiosyncrasies as purely fanciful. Patients not infrequently cherish\r\n  supposed idiosyncrasies with gratification. The idea is gratifying\r\n  to egotism, as evidence that Providence has distinguished them from\r\n  the common herd by certain peculiarities of constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nDietetic Instructions.--Finally Dr. Flint has a series of instructions\r\nfor those suffering from indigestion:\r\n\r\n  Do not adopt the rule of eating only at stated periods, twice or\r\n  thrice daily. Be governed in this respect by appetite; and eat\r\n  whenever there is a desire for food. Eat in the evenings or at\r\n  bedtime, if food be desired. _Insomnia is often attributable to\r\n  hunger_ [italics ours]. In the choice of articles of diet, be\r\n  distrustful of past personal experience, and consider it to be a\r\n  trustworthy rule that those articles will be most likely to be\r\n  digested without inconvenience which are most acceptable to the\r\n  palate. As far as practicable, let the articles of diet be made\r\n  acceptable by good cooking. As a rule, the better articles of food\r\n  are cooked, the greater the comfort during digestion. Never leave\r\n  the table with an unsatisfied appetite. Be in no haste to suppose\r\n  that you are separated from the rest of mankind by dietetic\r\n  idiosyncrasies, and be distrustful of the dogma that another man's\r\n  meat is a poison to you. Do not undertake to estimate the amount of\r\n  food which you take. In this respect different persons differ very\r\n  widely, and there is no fixed standard of quantity, which is not to\r\n  be exceeded. Take animal and vegetable articles of diet in relative\r\n  proportions as indicated by instinct. In the quantity of drink,\r\n  follow nature's indication; namely, thirst. Experience shows\r\n  abundantly that, with a view of comfortable digestion, there need be\r\n  no restriction in the ingestion of liquids.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoval of Solicitude as a Remedial Measure.--Many dyspeptics have no\r\nsubject that they occupy themselves with more seriously than their\r\ndigestion, and they thus divert blood needed for digestive purposes as\r\nwell as nervous energy that would help in it from the stomach to the\r\nbrain, in order to exercise surveillance over the process. As has been\r\nwell said, \"Probably much more than half of the indigestion is really\r\nabove the neck.\" This does not mean that there are not cases that need\r\ndefinite stomachic treatment, or even that patients who have succeeded\r\nin functionally disturbing their digestion by thinking over much about\r\nit, will not need gastric remedies.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the many fads and remedies that _cure_ indigestion,\r\nreal or supposed, is exactly this tendency of the suggestive influence\r\nof such remedial measures to lessen the patient's solicitude about\r\ndigestion. Any change in diet that carries with it the persuasion that\r\nfor any reason digestion ought to be better, will, because of this,\r\nmake digestion better. Any habit of taking warm or cold water before\r\nmeals, or of chewing in a particular way, or of taking a particular\r\nkind of food different from what is usually taken--exclusively cereal,\r\nuncooked, largely fruit, vegetarian, etc.--will lift the concentration\r\nof attention on the digestive process, and so give the stomach a\r\nchance to do its work without interference from the brain.\r\n\r\nDu Bois has quoted some striking testimony in this matter from Baras,\r\nwho wrote on the \"Gastralgias and Nervous Affections of the Stomach\r\nand the Intestines\" as early as 1820. Baras had himself been a\r\nsufferer from {258} gastric discomfort, fullness after eating,\r\neructations of gas, constipation, and general depression. He consulted\r\nmost of the distinguished medical practitioners of his time. With one\r\nexception they were convinced that he was a sufferer from chronic\r\ngastro-enteritis. They added more and more to his concern about his\r\nstomach, and furnished him with numerous sources of autosuggestion. In\r\nspite of all that they did for him, his condition grew worse and\r\nworse, he lost in weight, and was sure that his case was hopeless. He\r\nwas cured in a single day. His daughter was attacked with consumption,\r\nand \"in the moment my attention,\" says Baras, \"was centered entirely\r\nupon my child, I thought no more of myself, and I was cured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain Workers and Indigestion.--Perhaps the best proof of how\r\nnecessary it is that people should not continue to occupy their\r\nintellect seriously during the time when digestion is going on, is to\r\nbe found in the frequency with which complaints of indigestion occur\r\nin literary folk. The complaints are heard most from literary folk\r\nbecause they are more likely to tell their stories. They have their\r\nwork, and thoughts of it, always with them. So there is a constant\r\ncall for nervous and mental activity and for much blood in the brain\r\ntissues. This subtracts from the nervous energy necessary for\r\ndigestion, and makes it impossible to conduct it with that perfection\r\nwhich comes naturally to people who banish all other thoughts and keep\r\ntheir minds free for the pleasures of the table and social intercourse\r\nat meal time.\r\n\r\nNervous indigestion is so common among literary folk, teachers and\r\nscientific workers, that various causes have been suggested for it.\r\nDr. George Gould, in his \"Biographic Clinics,\" calls attention to it\r\nand suggests that the cause is probably the need of properly fitted\r\nspectacles. In our own time, when we are much more careful in the\r\nmatter of eyeglasses, and when most writers and professors wear\r\nscientifically adapted glasses, the complaints still continue. The\r\nreason is evidently something associated with the almost continuous\r\nwork that they do. Such people, too, are much more self-conscious than\r\nothers. They think more about their digestion and what they eat. They\r\noften think that they differ from other people and have special\r\nidiosyncrasies for food. These thoughts are sure to culminate in\r\nnervous indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood Faddists.--Literary folk and people who live the intellectual\r\nlife are very prone to take up with fads of various kinds and find\r\nsurcease from their sorrows in all sorts of out of the way dietaries,\r\nmodes of eating, food limitations and specializations. They constitute\r\na majority of the food faddists. Some of them--sure that they should\r\nnot eat meat--are strenuous vegetarians. Others confine themselves\r\nentirely to food the life of which has not been completely destroyed\r\nby cooking. They are fruit faddists, nut faddists, milk-product\r\nfaddists, and the like. Some of them try to persuade the world that it\r\neats too much; others that it eats too frequently. Some of them take\r\nbut a single real meal a day and have apologies for the other meals.\r\nAll want to lead people to their particular mode of life, as if all\r\nthe world had been wrong until they came to set it right. Some want\r\nthe rest of the world to chew seventy-times-seven before they swallow\r\nand to adopt other exaggerations of attention to eating that are quite\r\ncontrary to instinct, the most precious guide that we have in the\r\nmatter of food choice and food consumption.\r\n\r\nThese intellectuals are always improved by their fads, no matter what\r\nthey {259} may be. The reason is apparent. Their original digestive\r\ndisturbance was due to over-occupation with intellectual work. Then\r\nthey began to worry about their digestion and feared that nearly\r\neverything they ate would disagree with them. This fear and solicitude\r\nstill further interfered with digestion. Next they acquired the new\r\nfad. They became persuaded that they could eat certain things in\r\ncertain ways. They no longer disturb their digestion by anxiety about\r\nit, but, on the contrary, help it by favorable suggestion. Now under\r\nthe new regime everything will surely go on well. Besides, they\r\nusually learn the lesson of not doing intellectual work close to their\r\nmeals, and of spacing their work better. They learn to do a daily\r\nstint of work and no more. One of the fads that goes with most food\r\nfashions is abundant outdoor air. This always does good. Between the\r\nfavorable mental influence, the lessened work, especially just after\r\nmeals, and the increased outdoor air they get better and then they\r\nattribute it all to their special fad about food. The _\"cure\"_ is due\r\nto psychotherapy and common sense, and not in any way to the special\r\nfad.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorry.--Worry of any kind will have the same effect as the\r\nover-attention of the literary man or teacher to his work. Anyone who\r\nbrings his business home with him is likely to suffer and, unless he\r\nhas a superabundant supply of energy, will impair his digestive\r\nfunction as a consequence of attempting to do business after dinner,\r\nperhaps also stealing some of it in before and during breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION AND CORRECTION\r\n\r\nThe important rule with regard to the mental attitude of the patient\r\ntoward uncomfortable feelings due to digestion must be, first to\r\ncorrect all other possible sources of the trouble, and only after\r\nthese have been proved not to be factors in the case, should there be\r\nany question of modification of diet. This is just the opposite rule\r\nfrom that which obtains, and by which patients begin to meddle with\r\ntheir diet at the slightest symptom, or supposed symptom, of\r\nindigestion. My custom is to tell patients at once that there is\r\nprobably something else besides their diet at fault. It is not that\r\nthey eat too much, nor too great a variety, but that perhaps they eat\r\ntoo rapidly. Without reducing their diet, and above all without\r\neliminating supposedly indigestible things from it, there should be\r\nformed a habit of eating more slowly. This will usually result in the\r\nreduction of the quantity eaten, but the variety of food should be the\r\nsame, and the patient should not be permitted to limit his diet to a\r\nfew supposedly bland, unirritating materials. In that event,\r\nconstipation will assert itself, particularly if there is limitation\r\nof the amount of fluid taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nLongevity of Dyspeptics.--There is one consolation that may be given\r\nto nervous dyspeptics, though in the midst of their worst symptoms\r\nthey may not be sure whether it is a genuine consolation or not. It\r\nhas been noted that many of those who live to extreme age tell the\r\nstory of having suffered from nervous dyspepsia in middle-life. Their\r\nsolicitude about themselves makes them safe against over-indulgences\r\nof many kinds in food or drink that might prove hurtful to them. Much\r\nof their discomfort is indeed due to the fact that they do not eat\r\nquite enough. If they succeed in avoiding the {260} pitfalls of the\r\ninfectious diseases, and especially tuberculosis during their earlier\r\nyears, and most of them are likely to because of the great care they\r\ntake of themselves, they often live to old age. Certainly of two men,\r\none of whom eats very heartily and the other very sparingly, the\r\nlatter is much the more likely to attain old age. There are those who\r\ndeclare that the valetudinarian life, \"half dead and alive,\" which\r\neven Plato satirized nearly 2,500 years ago, ever renews the question\r\nas to whether life is worth living or not. It is particularly\r\ndyspeptics who seriously discuss this question--yet with all their\r\ncomplaints, they actually do live longer lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPharmaceutic Remedies.--This insistence on the importance of mind in\r\nthe treatment of indigestion does not imply that tonic remedies, and\r\nespecially such substances as strychnin, which stimulate appetite and\r\nadd tone to the muscles of the stomach, should not be used when duly\r\nindicated. They are always helpful. Alone, these remedies give but\r\ntemporary relief and after a short time the system becomes accustomed\r\nto them. If prescribed in connection with changes in the patient's\r\nhabits, and especially such as divert his attention from his digestive\r\ntract, and from wrong persuasions as to food taking, the good they\r\naccomplish will be lasting. Nervous people usually have an increase of\r\nacidity. They are liable to overdo everything, and even the stomach\r\noverdoes its acid forming function. For this, alkaline remedies such\r\nas rhubarb and soda will do good. But, just as with strychnin, the\r\nbenefit is but temporary unless the patient's habits and attitude of\r\nmind are modified so as to eliminate their solicitude as a constantly\r\ndisturbing factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstantial Suggestions.--There are many changes of habits that are\r\nof great value in the treatment of nervous and allied forms of\r\nindigestion. These changes often make a great difference in the\r\ngeneral health of the patient and thus help to improve digestion.\r\nBesides their influence as alteratives, they are valuable from the\r\nmental influence which they exercise. It requires a definite exertion\r\nof will many times, perhaps, each day to bring about the omission or\r\nperformance of certain actions, and this act of the will is\r\naccompanied by the repeated suggestion that this will cause\r\nimprovement in the digestion. Many of the cures effected by special\r\ndiet. Habits of exercise, health resort regimes and the like, owe\r\ntheir efficacy to this accompanying repeated suggestion of acts for\r\nthe formation of new habits or the breaking of old ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiological Measures.--There are, of course, certain details with\r\nregard to digestion in which the patient's mental attitude needs to be\r\nchanged by instruction rather than persuasion, by knowledge of\r\nphysiology rather than by psychology. In the taking of food itself,\r\nchewing is, of course, the most important consideration after its good\r\npreparation by the cook. If patients are told to chew their food\r\ncarefully, however, without further directions than this, it will\r\nusually be found that they begin to chew their meat a great deal and\r\ntheir vegetables scarcely more than before. It is, however, vegetables\r\nthat must be chewed particularly. The meat-eating animals bolt their\r\nfood. They have only cutting and tearing teeth. Their instinct is\r\ncorrect, for the saliva has nothing to do with the digestion of meat,\r\nand therefore no chewing is necessary. On the other hand, the\r\nvegetable-eating, and especially the grain-eating animals, chew\r\ncarefully. Most of them are ruminants, that is, after a preliminary\r\nthorough chewing of their food, they swallow it, and then {261}\r\nafterwards at their leisure bring it up once more into the mouth and\r\nchew it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mastication and the Stomach_.--If food is not chewed well, and occurs\r\nin large masses in the stomach, not only is it not dissolved easily,\r\nbut the work of passing it out to the intestine is delayed. The reflex\r\nwhich brings about the opening of the stomach and the ejection of food\r\ninto the intestine is best brought about by the liquefaction of the\r\nstomach contents. During the mixing process all the food, as far as\r\npossible, becomes fluid and then is passed on. Large pieces of any\r\nkind are delayed, however, hamper the emptying of the stomach and\r\ninterfere with stomach motility. The stomach is only a thin-walled\r\nmembranous viscus which finds difficulty in dealing with food in\r\nlumps. It is different from the stomach of the hen, which, having no\r\nteeth, swallows grains of all kinds without chewing, but also by\r\ninstinct swallows small stones which, in its thick-walled, muscular\r\ngizzard, are used for grinding up the food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exercise_.--The taking of exercise is an important habit that needs\r\nto be changed in the case of dyspeptics. Many of those who live a\r\nsedentary life, and are much occupied with intellectual or business\r\nmatters, are almost sure to take little or no exercise. If earlier in\r\nlife they were accustomed to take much, the lack of it leads to\r\nserious disturbances of nutrition. They have formed certain habits as\r\nto the amount of food they eat, and these continue, so that they\r\nconsume more heat-making material than they can use. In the process of\r\ndissipating it, there is likely to be much nervous energy wasted,\r\nusually to the discomfort of the patient. This is likely to be\r\neventually reflected back to the stomach, with disturbance of appetite\r\nand digestion.\r\n\r\nWe now know that the motor function of the stomach is much more\r\nimportant than its secretory function. Its main purpose is to mix the\r\nfood and pass it on in small quantities, at intervals, to the\r\nintestines. When patients have a sense of uncomfortable fullness in\r\nthe gastric region after a hearty meal, or of discomfort after the\r\ntaking of food, especially if much liquid is taken with it, they are\r\nprone to attribute these feelings to imperfect secretion not\r\ncompleting digestion as it should, and permitting fermentation with a\r\nproduction of gas and consequent stomach distention. The real reason\r\nfor their discomfort is not secretory, but motor. It is due to a delay\r\nin passing on the food and to stomach distention because the gastric\r\nmuscle is not in good tone.\r\n\r\nPeople who have been used to taking exercises have their muscular\r\nsystem in good tonic condition. This includes the involuntary muscles,\r\nas well as the voluntary, and if they are neglecting air and exercise,\r\nthe whole muscular system becomes flabby. Hence the uncomfortable\r\nsense of distention, because the stomach walls do not contract readily\r\nfor the expulsion of food. A second important factor is also\r\npresent--the muscles of the abdomen. Ordinarily they support the\r\nabdominal organs without any sense of effort. If by lack of exercise\r\nthey have diminished in tone, however, when a hearty meal is eaten,\r\nthe abdominal muscles have to support this additional weight since the\r\nstomach itself sags, and the consequence is a feeling of pressure on\r\nthe left side of the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. To\r\nrelieve this feeling the tendency of the patient is almost always to\r\nlessen the amount eaten. If he is not distinctly overweight this will\r\ndo harm rather than good. Instead he {262} needs to take sufficient\r\nexercise to tone abdominal muscles and reflexly also tone even\r\ninvoluntary muscles, and with them the gastric muscularis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air_.--Almost more important than exercise is an abundance of fresh\r\nair, and without this muscles soon fail to respond to voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary impulses. If people do not spend two or three hours in the\r\nair every day, they are likely to develop an over-sensitive condition\r\nin which all nervous sensations are exaggerated. The reason men and\r\nwomen differ so markedly in their reaction to pains, aches and\r\ndiscomforts, is mainly that their habits of being out in the air\r\ndiffer correspondingly. Men are out much and, as a rule, stand\r\ndiscomfort better. Women are out little and are more sensitive to\r\npains and aches. The more a man is out, the less is he likely to\r\nnotice discomforts and aches that he would otherwise complain about.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sleep_.--Another important factor is the amount of sleep. Over and\r\nover again I have found that patients who were beginning to complain\r\nof discomfort, which they associated with the word indigestion, were\r\ntaking too little sleep, and as soon as I persuaded them to add an\r\nhour or more to their sleep their gastric symptoms began to improve.\r\nIt is easy in our large cities to acquire the habit of shortening the\r\nhours of rest. This is sometimes done so gradually that the individual\r\nscarcely realizes how much he has cut into his sleeping period. Some\r\npeople who have to get up at seven or half-past seven in the morning\r\ngo to bed about twelve, but really do not get settled for sleep until\r\nnearly one o'clock. Sometimes people read interesting books just\r\nbefore going to bed, or while in bed, and it is nearly two o'clock\r\nwhen they get to sleep.\r\n\r\nMany people have the habit of reading themselves to sleep. This may be\r\nan excellent way to get rid of bothersome thoughts, provided the\r\nreading selected is not of too absorbing a character, and provided\r\nalso as soon as sleepiness comes its call is heeded. Some write\r\nletters late at night. Writing always keeps one awake, though reading\r\nmay be helpful for sleep. If this abbreviation of sleep becomes\r\nhabitual, the first organs in the body to set up an objection is the\r\ndigestive tract. It is one of the hardest worked systems in the body,\r\nhaving to dispose of its quantum of food three times every day, and if\r\nthe organism does not receive due rest, the digestive tract suffers\r\nfirst. People who get insufficient sleep often have no appetite in the\r\nmorning, and suffer from uncomfortable feelings in the gastric region.\r\nWhat they are too prone to do is to meddle with their diet, and this\r\npractice always does harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAPPETITE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo classes of patients come to the physician complaining of lack of\r\nappetite. The first and more important class consists of those who are\r\neating too little, who are consequently under weight, and who must be\r\nmade to eat more. The other class consists of those who eat enough but\r\ncomplain that they do not relish their food. Careful questioning\r\nusually elicits sufficient information to enable one to decide that\r\nmost of these latter are eating too {263} much, or unsuitable food,\r\nand at too frequent intervals. They are usually overweight, and there\r\nis need to reduce the amount they eat. In both of these classes the\r\nphysician is tempted to conclude that medicines should form the\r\nprincipal part of the treatment. We have a number of tonics and\r\nstimulants that undoubtedly initiate a desire for food, or at least so\r\nincrease the circulation in the stomach that patients feel much more\r\ninclined to eat than they otherwise would. There are a number of\r\nremedies, also, the so-called anti-fat group, which produce a\r\ndisinclination for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nPower of Mind Over Appetite.--Appetite, whether in deficiency or in\r\nexcess, is best regulated through the patient's mind. Patients\r\nfrequently state that they cannot eat more than they do, that they\r\nhave no inclination for food, and yet, after a little persuasion, they\r\ncan be made to increase the amount they have been eating, and then\r\nthat can be gradually raised until they are taking what is for them a\r\nnormal quantity. There are many things that we swallow without caring\r\nfor them. Most medicines we not only do not like, but positively\r\ndislike. We put them down, they accomplish their purpose, and food\r\nwill act nearly in the same way. There are few cases where food is\r\npositively rejected. Patients can be persuaded to eat more, and after\r\na time will be surprised to find that their desire for food increases\r\nwith the habit of taking it. On the other hand, patients can be made\r\nto see that they are taking too much food really to enjoy its\r\nconsumption. Their appetites are perpetually cloyed, and to them food\r\nhas none of the pleasant flavor that exists when it is taken in\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Will to Eat_.--In various parts of this book there is emphasized\r\nthe necessity for the exercise of the human will in order to aid in\r\nthe accomplishment of even physical functions. The basis of many\r\nnervous symptoms is a lack of sufficient nutrition to steady the\r\nnervous system. Some people not only lack will power, but also\r\njudgment in the matter of eating; they prefer to err on the side of\r\ninsufficiency lest they should over-eat. For these people the\r\nimportant remedial measure is to dictate the amount that they shall\r\neat, and gradually to increase it until they are eating enough for\r\ntheir nutritional purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen this advice is given to patients, they are willing to agree that\r\na gain in weight would be good for them, but they cannot understand\r\nhow they can eat more since they are now eating all they can, or\r\ncertainly all they care to. Appetite grows by what it feeds on, and\r\nincrease in appetite is a function of the habit of eating.\r\n\r\nBut some patients, after having tried the prescription of eating more,\r\nare still in the same condition, and find that they cannot put on\r\nweight. What is needed in such cases is an inquiry into all the\r\nconditions of the daily life, their habits of eating and the amount of\r\ntime that they take for their meals. They are probably eating one good\r\nmeal a day, their dinner in the evening--but they confess that the\r\nother meals are not satisfactory. If their habits are rearranged, the\r\nwill to eat does the rest. Sometimes they complain of uncomfortable\r\nfeelings after eating and this makes them eat less at the next meal.\r\nThere are various mental elements that disturb the efficacy of the\r\nwill to eat, consequently these patients do not get on. What they need\r\nis emphatic insistence on the necessity for persistent effort in\r\nregular eating day after day, meal after meal, and it is not long\r\nbefore improvement comes not {264} only in weight, but also in\r\nappetite. I have known patients to gain five or six pounds a week\r\nafter having tried weeks in vain to gain a single pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sitophobia_.--Many people read much of the possibilities of evil in\r\novereating, and they conclude that a limitation of diet would be\r\nbetter for them. After a time some of these people of nervous\r\nconstitution acquire an actual dread of over-eating and develop what\r\nhas been called sitophobia, or dread of food. Before anything can be\r\ndone with them, this dread must be removed. The problem is discussed\r\nmore fully in the chapter on Weight and Good Feeling, but here it\r\nseems necessary to emphasize that it is often quite impossible by\r\nordinary medical means to produce an appetite in these patients. Their\r\nmental persuasion with regard to food must first be removed. If it\r\ncannot be removed, improvement is usually out of the question. No\r\nmedicines are sufficiently powerful to overcome a fixed unfavorable\r\nidea with regard to food. The same is true as to sleep, or any other\r\nnatural function--it comes and must go through the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisturbance of Mind and Its Influence on Appetite.--The basis of the\r\npsychotherapy of the digestive tract is the fact that appetite is a\r\nfunction of the state of mind rather than of the state of body. We all\r\nknow how easy it is to lose the appetite by emotional disturbance. We\r\nmay come into the house after a brisk walk, when we know that dinner\r\nis going to be better than usual, quite ready to anticipate the\r\npleasure we are to have in eating it and with appetite craving that\r\ndinner shall not be delayed, we find a telegram announcing the death\r\nof a friend or the illness of a relative or some other bad news, and\r\nin an instant our appetite has disappeared. It makes no difference to\r\nus for hours whether we eat or not. What we eat gives us no\r\nsatisfaction. It will be taken entirely from a sense of duty and\r\nwithout pleasure and will digest slowly, even if it does not produce\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feelings and Appetite_.--There is no need for a serious stomach\r\ncondition to develop, to diminish, or eliminate appetite. The sight of\r\nan accident on the street, especially if blood is shed, will entirely\r\ntake away the appetite of many persons. Now that suicide beneath the\r\nwheels of subway trains has become a rather frequent way of going out\r\nof life, physicians note that nervous patients who happen to see these\r\nsad affairs have no appetite, not alone for the next meal, but\r\nsometimes for several days. Some people have no appetite at all if\r\nthere is a dead body in the house where they live. I have known people\r\nwho felt it almost a desecration to eat under such circumstances. Even\r\nmuch less than this may serve to diminish appetite. An offensive odor\r\nof almost any kind is quite sufficient to take away the appetite of\r\nmany people. For some the odor of cooking food, if they have been in\r\nit for some time, is almost sure to cloy any desire for food.\r\n\r\nCooks suffer from loss of appetite for this reason. The sight of a\r\ndisagreeable stain on a tablecloth, or of a waiter's thumb in the\r\nsoup, or of some unpleasant characteristic of the waiter, may be quite\r\nenough seriously to disturb the appetite of sensitive people.\r\n\r\nWe know all this very well, and yet we are prone to think of appetite\r\nas something regulated by instinct, and representing the real needs of\r\nthe organism in its cravings and the limitations of the necessity of\r\nfood by its satisfaction. In our sophisticated modern life instinct\r\nwill often fail entirely to fulfill these purposes. Appetite for those\r\nwho live much indoors is a question of {265} habit and regulation\r\nrather than of instinct. It has to be voluntary to a large extent, not\r\nonly as regards the quality but also the quantity of food. We eat the\r\nthings that we care for, but how much of them we shall eat is another\r\nmatter. That depends on how we happen to be disposed at the moment,\r\nand whether there is any good reason for eating more or less at the\r\ngiven time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppetizers.--There is a whole group of substances recommended as\r\nappetizers, most of which are effective, but their effect is likely to\r\nbe temporary, and to fail particularly in those cases where an\r\nappetite is most needed. Anything that will increase the circulation\r\nin the stomach will usually add to appetite; consequently warm drinks,\r\nalcoholic liquors and spices of various kinds have this effect. In\r\nvigorous people, a dash of cold on any portion of the body, is\r\nfollowed by a strong reaction of the circulation. Cold drinks,\r\ntherefore, will sometimes serve as an appetizer, especially in hot\r\nweather. Almost anything that has a certain peculiarity of taste, and\r\nthat is taken with the definite suggestion that it will produce an\r\nappetite, will almost surely have that effect. All sorts of articles\r\nof diet have in various countries acquired a reputation as appetizers.\r\nFermented mare's milk is effective in central Europe; a glass of\r\nbuttermilk in Ireland; some very hot soup with one of the strong\r\nspiced sauces in it in England; and various curious combinations of\r\nfruit and other materials in the shape of what are called cocktails,\r\nin America. Anything that stimulates the stomach a little unusually,\r\nand is accompanied by the idea that it is likely to increase the taste\r\nfor food, almost surely adds to appetite.\r\n\r\nThis question of appetizers is as yet a mystery to us. It is eminently\r\nindividual and yet much depends on racial customs, the habits, the\r\nenvironments and the family training. It is surprising what curious\r\nmaterials serve to excite the appetite. Caviar, in spite of the\r\ndistaste of \"the general,\" is undoubtedly a good appetizer for many\r\npeople. Bismarck herring, or kippered herring, acts in the same way.\r\nIn the old days men used to take what were called red herrings and\r\nundoubtedly found in the eating of them a renewal of desire for food,\r\nwhen there had been absence of appetite. There are some people in whom\r\na little taste of cheese serves the same purpose. Bitter tastes\r\nusually increase appetite. Salt under certain circumstances has a\r\nsimilar effect. Acid fruits sometimes stimulate a jaded desire for\r\nfood. Nearly always the effect of these various appetizers is\r\nincreased by the attitude of expectancy. They have the reputation of\r\nbeing appetizers and so, though often at first somewhat disagreeable,\r\nthey eventually prove to be helpful stimulants.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppetite and Habit.--For those who live an indoor life, and have that\r\nnervous disposition that disturbs instinct, the only safeguard for\r\nnutrition is a definite formula for eating which must be followed\r\nstrictly, especially by those who are below the normal in nutrition.\r\nIn the chapter on Weight and Good Feeling I discuss the failure of\r\nappetite following a diminution of the amount of food. The stomach may\r\nbe described as unselfish, and in times of scarcity it gives up to\r\nother organs more of the nutrition that comes to it than it should. As\r\na consequence, it is not so well able to fulfill its functions of\r\ndigestion and of craving for food, which is part of its function, as\r\nit would otherwise be. It is the people who are eating a proper amount\r\nand have been eating it, whose digestive tracts are in a condition to\r\ncrave the proper {266} amount of food. Those whose habits have\r\nunfortunately led them into eating amounts too small, also suffer in\r\nnot having the proper desire for food.\r\n\r\nNervous people particularly are likely to lack appetite in the early\r\nmorning. Those who are under weight will almost invariably confess\r\nthat they take little breakfast. Their reason for so doing is that\r\nthey have no appetite. For most of them what is really true is that in\r\nthe early hours of the day their will has not yet taken properly hold\r\nof their economies and everything is in a depressed state. These\r\npatients usually confess that they wake feeling not rested but tired,\r\nfearing the day, and wondering now they will be able to get through\r\nit. Only toward the middle of the day do they feel like themselves,\r\nwhile towards evening they wonder how they could have been so\r\ndepressed in the morning. What these people need is the rousing into\r\nactivity of their functions. Occasionally, especially in summer, a\r\ncold sponge on rising in a room into which an abundance of air is\r\nadmitted will do much for them. Often a walk of even ten minutes\r\nbefore breakfast will make all the difference between appetite and\r\nlack of it. Above all, however, they should be made to feel that if\r\nthey want to eat they can eat--if they want to they can reestablish\r\nthe habit of taking breakfast, and then it will be a pleasure instead\r\nof a burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food and Caprice_.--Those complaining of lack of appetite should\r\nlearn not to let caprice rule them in the matter of eating. There are\r\npeople who by habit eat too much. What they must do, as pointed out in\r\nthe chapter on Obesity, is to unlearn the habit of overeating, and\r\nthat is almost as hard to break as the habit of taking stimulants.\r\nMost nervous people undereat, but they must take themselves in hand,\r\neat three meals a day, and reestablish the habit of taking as much at\r\nthese meals as they ought. What each one should consume is eminently\r\nindividual, depending altogether on the sort of heat engine that each\r\none is. Family traits mean much in this. Some must eat much more than\r\nothers to keep up their weight and strength, because they are wasteful\r\nheat engines. As a rule, tall, thin people must eat more in proportion\r\nto their weight than shorter individuals of stout build. They expose\r\nmore surface for heat dissipation. In this each person must learn for\r\nhimself his own necessities. When there is a question of regulating\r\neating by reason, the rule must be remembered that there is a tendency\r\nin people living indoors to take too little rather than too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appetite and Food Preparation_.--There are many curious things with\r\nregard to the formation of the habit of eating that show how easily\r\nthe appetite or instinct is vitiated. Women, for instance, are nearly\r\nalways prone not to eat enough if they have to prepare their own\r\nmeals. When a mother and daughter or two sisters live together, they\r\nusually prepare one good meal, but the other two meals are likely to\r\nbe picked up any way. The presence of a man in the household makes all\r\nthe difference in the world. Meals are prepared regularly for men.\r\nEven for a boy of five to fifteen, meals are regularly prepared, and,\r\nas a rule, the presence of a child makes for regularity in eating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Habit of Overeating_.--On the other hand, it is easy to form habits\r\nof eating that go quite beyond appetite and vitiate the desire for\r\nfood quite as seriously in the opposite direction. Many stout people\r\ntake snacks between meals; women, already too heavy, indulge in the\r\nafternoon tea habit with a surprising amount of substantial food taken\r\nwith the tea; many a stout man {267} takes a glass of beer\r\noccasionally and never fails to take something to eat at the same\r\ntime, mainly with the idea, as he says to himself, that by taking\r\nsomething to eat the beer will be less likely to do him harm. Stout\r\nchildren are likely to form the habit of eating too frequently. When\r\nthey come home from school they have a piece of something; before they\r\ngo to bed they have a glass of milk, and a piece of cake, and\r\nsometimes are encouraged in these bad habits by their parents. Any\r\nchild who is more than ten per cent. above weight, should be kept\r\nstrictly to its regular meal times, and should not be allowed to put\r\non additional weight, for this will be very hard to get off in adult\r\nlife. To carry more than ten per cent. of over-weight is a burden, and\r\nnot a benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequent Eating as an Appetizer.--Thin people should be encouraged to\r\nindulge in some of these between-meal privileges. Very often a thin\r\nperson who has been accustomed to take comparatively small amounts at\r\nmeal times, will find it easier to gain in weight by indulging in\r\nluncheons between meals than by increasing the amount of each meal.\r\nLarge meals on stomachs unaccustomed to them, and somewhat less\r\nvigorous than they ought to be because of lack of nutrition, may be\r\nthe cause of considerable discomfort if abundant meals are taken where\r\nsmall ones have been habitual. In this case, multiple feeding at\r\nshorter intervals will gradually increase tissue strength. After the\r\npatient has come up to normal weight, regular intervals between meals\r\nmay be determined and sufficient quantities taken at each meal. Nearly\r\nall thin people sleep better, and are more comfortable if they take\r\nsomething shortly before going to bed. Most people will eat their\r\nbreakfast better after such an indulgence than if fourteen hours\r\nelapse between the evening and the morning meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNervous Loss of Appetite.--Nervous patients often say they have no\r\nappetite, that, even though they eat, their food has no taste. Such\r\npeople have often lost their eating instinct to a certain degree. They\r\neat merely from routine, or because food is placed before them. They\r\nwould usually just as soon not eat and they have no instinctive\r\ndirections as to quantity. If a number of courses are presented to\r\nthem, they eat such as they care for and take a conventional amount of\r\neach kind of food presented, but they have no particular feeling to\r\nguide them in the matter of quantity. There are moods in which these\r\npatients care to eat. There are others in which eating seems a hard\r\ntask. If they are in reasonably poor circumstances and have not to\r\nprepare a meal for others they are likely to neglect the preparation\r\nof one for themselves, take almost anything that happens to be at\r\nhand, and then consider that they have eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstinct and Natural Life.--If one expects the natural guidance of\r\none's instincts then one must give these instincts a proper\r\nopportunity. Instinct is a part of our animal nature, and unless other\r\nportions of our animal nature are given rather free play, or at least\r\nthe opportunities for their natural life, we cannot depend on any\r\nsingle one of the instincts to be a safe guide. Man was meant to live\r\nmuch outside. He was meant to take considerable exercise and to have\r\nto get his food by severe exertion. We have changed this. We live\r\nindoors to a great extent in an equable temperature, we very seldom\r\ntire ourselves by exercise, and it is not to be wondered at if we have\r\nnot that craving for food that comes to the man who lives a more\r\nanimal existence. The {268} Scotch surgeon, Abernethy, once said that\r\nthe best possible tonic for the appetite was \"to live on a shilling a\r\nday and earn it\"--of course, he meant by manual labor. He talked at a\r\ntime when the English workmen got but three shillings a day for\r\nfourteen hours of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Principles.--What is needed for the mental treatment of\r\npatients with defective appetite, is that they should be made to\r\nrealize that appetite is a function of habit, rather than of absolute\r\nnatural craving in the conditions in which men and women live at the\r\npresent time. The most important physical factor for appetite is not\r\nexercise, as has often been thought, because this, by consuming\r\nmaterial, is naturally supposed to increase the craving for material\r\nto renew the tissue, but air, for it is oxidation processes that\r\nstimulate metabolism and make the call for a fresh supply of\r\ntissue-building material. People without an appetite must be made to\r\nunderstand that they should spend a considerable portion of the time\r\nbetween meals in the open air. Sitting in the open air is often even\r\nmore effective than exercise under similar conditions, especially in\r\nweak people. The reason is exercise exhausts energy, and sometimes\r\ndoes not leave enough vitality for digestion, or even for the craving\r\nfor food. Exercise is, of course, excellent for those of stronger\r\nconstitution, and especially those who have been accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nThose who need to eat more, must keep constantly before their minds\r\nthe suggestion that if they want to eat they can, and that if they\r\nactually do eat more, satisfaction with eating grows, and appetite is\r\nrestored to its normal place of influence. This is as true for those\r\nwho are convalescing from some ailment, or who are in the midst of\r\nsome progressive disease such as tuberculosis, as it is for the merely\r\nnervous persons whose lack of will and inefficiency of judgment have\r\ndisturbed their eating habits. The will to eat is the most important\r\nappetizer that we have. The old Scotch physician's rule that if food\r\nstayed down it would do good, and that if the residue of it passed\r\nthrough the intestinal tract there was nothing very serious the matter\r\nwith the patient, applies to the majority of patients who come to be\r\ntreated for obscure ailments, especially of a chronic character,\r\nwhenever they are associated with or developed on a basis of lack of\r\nnormal weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo judge by the frequency of advertisements for laxatives of various\r\nkinds, constipation must be an extremely common affection. At least\r\none out of every three city dwellers suffers, it is said, from\r\nconstipation. Proper regard for the taking of food calculated to help\r\nthis important function, the formation of appropriate habits, and the\r\nproper disposition of the mind so as to relieve worry and anxiety,\r\nwill cure the majority of these patients. There are some who need\r\nadditional treatment, pharmacal or mechanical, but these are few.\r\nUndoubtedly the mind plays the most important role in the therapeutics\r\nof the affection. It is influenced partly through instruction, {269}\r\npartly by the modification of unfortunate auto-suggestion, and partly\r\nthrough auxiliary favorable suggestions of one kind or another.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--What is needed in most cases is such instruction as will\r\nlead to a better observance of certain common-sense laws of health,\r\nrather than the addition of remedies which eventually only complicate\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nMany people believe that unless they have an ample movement of the\r\nbowels every day all sorts of serious results are likely to follow. If\r\nthey do not have the expected movement before noon, they suffer during\r\nthe afternoon from headache that is probably due more to worry than to\r\nany physical cause. Ordinarily it is quite out of the question that\r\nthe retention of the contents of the lower bowel for a few hours\r\nshould produce any such serious effects as these patients immediately\r\nbegin to feel. Especially is this true when on the day previous there\r\nhas been, as is often the case, a sufficient movement of the bowels,\r\ndue to the use of medicine. Some people have become so anxious in the\r\nmatter that they foster the development of feelings of discomfort both\r\nin their abdominal and intracranial regions.\r\n\r\nThis over-anxiety is all the more important because recent\r\nobservations have made it clear that over-occupation of mind actually\r\nhampers peristaltic movements of the intestines, and thus prevents the\r\nmuscular action which would gradually pass the excrementitious\r\nmaterial on to the lower bowel, to be evacuated in the normal way. _It\r\ncannot be too often repeated that nature resents too close\r\nsurveillance of her functions and operations_. Just as soon as the\r\nover-anxiety is relieved, and patients are made to appreciate that if\r\nthey do not have a movement to-day they may wait without serious\r\nsolicitude till they have one to-morrow, the amount of medicine\r\nrequired to bring about movements of the bowels is at once reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind and Peristalsis.--Analogous to Pawlow's ingenious\r\nexperiments, with regard to digestive secretion in the stomach, are\r\nKronecker's experiments at Berne upon the motor function of the\r\nintestinal tract. Pawlow showed that the appetite depended, not on\r\nphysical conditions so much as on the mental state of the animal and\r\nits desire for a particular kind of food. Kronecker, by isolating a\r\nloop of intestine in which a metal ball was placed, showed that it was\r\npossible to modify peristalsis very materially by affecting the\r\npsychic condition of the animal. There was a distinct difference in\r\nthe movements of the intestine, in the passage of a metal ball, when\r\nthe animal was called and expected to go for a walk with its master,\r\nthan when it was threatened with punishment or rendered depressed for\r\nsome other reason. In animals, the psyche plays a very subordinate\r\nrole in inhibition and stimulation compared to that exercised by man's\r\nhigher nervous system, since in him this portion of the organism is so\r\nmuch better developed than in the animal. The condition of the human\r\nmind in its possibilities of unfavorable influence over the intestinal\r\nfunction, is, therefore, extremely important.\r\n\r\nThe more one knows about the curious power of the mind even over so\r\nmaterial a function as intestinal peristalsis and movement, the more\r\nis one convinced of the necessity for a properly disposed mind toward\r\nintestinal function, if it is to be accomplished with regularity and\r\nwithout disturbance. Many persons thoroughly under hypnotic influence,\r\nwho are told that they will have a movement of the bowels at a certain\r\nhour the next day will have it. Indeed, this constitutes one way of\r\ntreating certain forms of constipation in nervous, {270} preoccupied\r\npeople. There are many stories that illustrate the influence of\r\nauto-suggestion upon the bowels. We have already mentioned Flaubert's\r\nsuffering as a consequence of realistic absorption in \"Madame\r\nBovary's\" poisoning by arsenic when he was writing that scene in the\r\nbook. Boris Sidis has told the story of a man who used to have a\r\ndisturbance of the bowels at every new moon, as the result of his\r\nmemory, acting unconsciously, reminding him of his mother's habit of\r\ngiving him a purgative about that time. These may be and doubtless are\r\nexceptional cases, yet they illustrate the influence of mind and show\r\nhow much it must be the effort of the physician to use this effective\r\nadjuvant just as much as possible in this very common and often\r\nobstinate affection in which drugs so often fail, or are\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo-called Intestinal Auto-intoxication.--Those who are anxiously\r\ninterested in the subject are likely to have read so much of\r\nintestinal auto-intoxications, of which a great deal has been written\r\nin recent years, that they will be quite sure the slightest delay in\r\nintestinal evacuation may be serious, or at least may profoundly\r\ndisturb their economy. As a consequence, just as soon as the hour at\r\nwhich they should have a movement passes, they begin to worry about\r\nit. In a couple of hours they feel tingly all over, and they know that\r\nthere most be poisonous substances in their circulation. After two or\r\nthree more hours, they begin to have a headache. Then they have to\r\ngive up work, and still more devote themselves to concentration of\r\nattention on the disturbed condition. Their sleep will be disturbed,\r\nperhaps will be delayed; they wake unrested and fearful of the awful\r\neffects of intestinal auto-intoxication. In most people this state of\r\nfeeling is entirely due to suggestion.\r\n\r\nSo much has been said in recent medical literature of the influence of\r\nabsorption of poisonous substances from the intestinal tract--the\r\nso-called intestinal auto-intoxication--that it is a surprise to learn\r\nhow little we know, definitely and absolutely, about this subject, and\r\nhow many theories have come and gone. Arthur Hertz, in his\r\n\"Constipation and Allied Intestinal Disorders\" (Oxford Medical\r\nPublications, 1909), reviews the whole subject very interestingly but\r\nshows that we are entirely without any definite conclusive evidence\r\nfor what has been talked about so much. The idea had often occurred,\r\nand been expressed vaguely, in medical literature in the old time, but\r\nbegan to have its great vogue when the high-sounding Greek term\r\ncopremia (literally \"excrementitious-substances-in-the-blood\") was\r\ninvented, toward the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Naturally this had a strong suggestive effect. Bouchard took\r\nit up a generation later, and then intestinal auto-intoxication,\r\nanother mouth-filling term, came to occupy much attention as an\r\nexplanation for various vague conditions, and especially nervous\r\ndiscomforts of many kinds. Bouchard's method of proving his theory by\r\nshowing how much toxic material was reabsorbed from the intestines,\r\nusing the urine for injection into animals, was open to many\r\nobjections. Now it has been quite discredited.\r\n\r\nBouchard's disciples exaggerated and theorized even beyond their\r\nmaster, until intestinal auto-intoxication became the same sort of a\r\nrefuge for the puzzled physicians of our time--like rheumatism or the\r\nuric acid diathesis, for those of a score of years ago. Various\r\nmethods of demonstrating the toxicity of substances absorbed had a\r\nvogue for a time, but they have now lost their significance. There are\r\nonly a limited number of people who seem to suffer {271} from the\r\nsymptoms attributed to such reabsorption. Some people who are quite\r\nconstipated have none of the symptoms at all, while a delay of an hour\r\nor two in the evacuation seems to affect other people very much. These\r\nlatter are especially nervous persons. It now seems very clear that\r\nthe liver acts as a safeguard against the absorption of poisonous\r\nmaterials from the intestinal tract, and that neither degenerate\r\nproteid materials, nor bacterial toxins, are allowed to affect the\r\nsystem to any serious degree. After all our study, as Dr. Hertz\r\ninsists, we have as yet no evidence that poisons are absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReassurance as an Element in Treatment.--The most important element in\r\nthe rational treatment of constipation is to make patients understand\r\nthat under ordinary circumstances the symptoms of auto-intoxication,\r\nof which so much is said, do not develop until there has been\r\nlong-continued accumulation of excrementitious material and under\r\nconditions favoring absorption. Even then nature learns to protect\r\nherself against untoward conditions. We have some very striking\r\nexamples of good health in spite of even very rare movements of the\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examples of Intestinal Tolerance_.--There is the famous case of the\r\nFrench army officer who, from his earliest years, did not have regular\r\nmovements of the bowels, but secured evacuations of them by artificial\r\naid once every two months or more. He lived to the age of past fifty,\r\nand then died from an intercurrent disease not connected with his\r\nintestinal condition, having in the meantime enjoyed good health. He\r\nwas able to accomplish his duties as an officer without any special\r\nallowances, and he was on the sick list much less than many brother\r\nofficers whose intestinal condition left nothing to be desired. This\r\nremarkable man succeeded in doing his life work without his condition\r\nbeing known by others to any extent, and it was only inconvenience,\r\nand not serious illness, that he suffered from. After his death, it\r\nwas found that certain folds of the lower bowel were so large as to\r\nmeet across the lumen of the bowel, making shelves and pouches in\r\nwhich fecal material gathered, preventing the movement of all material\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, it is said that many people, especially of the better\r\nclass, do not expect to have movements of their bowels every day. Some\r\nof them, indeed, do not encourage intestinal evacuations oftener than\r\nonce a week, sometimes even more seldom. As their diet is more largely\r\nvegetable than ours, this is all the more surprising. This custom does\r\nnot contribute to their good odor, but this they compensate for by\r\nusing various Eastern perfumes. The average length of life of such\r\npeople is not much below the Occidentals and the difference is\r\nprobably accounted for to a great extent by other unhygienic\r\npractices, rather than this failure to have regular movements of their\r\nbowels. In the meantime, they do not suffer any particular\r\ninconvenience, and live life quite as free from the ordinary pains and\r\naches as do the people of the West. Of course, in such cases the\r\ncustom has been established early, and nature has grown accustomed to\r\nit. Nature seems to be able to stand almost anything, if she can only\r\nsurvive it long enough to neutralize its effects by some of her\r\nmarvelous means of compensation.\r\n\r\nA case under my observation some years ago deeply impressed upon me\r\nhow thoroughly the human system can learn to get along in spite of\r\nextremely unfavorable conditions in the matter of intestinal\r\nevacuation. The case was that of a young woman suffering from some\r\ninternal trouble and there was {272} a possibility of the growth of a\r\ntumor. Some charitable people had been interested in her case, and the\r\nquestion had arisen whether the tumor might not be physiological. Her\r\nstory was a very curious one. She and her sister worked in a mill.\r\nThey came from a family that had been reduced in circumstances, and\r\nwere much more sensitive, as regards the decencies of life, than were\r\ntheir fellow workers. In order to get to the toilet, the working girls\r\nhad to pass a window of an office where a number of men were at work.\r\nThe other girls did not seem to mind it, but these two girls were so\r\nsensitive that they preferred not to use the toilet room at the\r\nfactory. They had to leave home shortly after six o'clock in the\r\nmorning. They did not get home until nearly seven. For a time, they\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing their intestinal functions during the hours\r\nof their stay at home. Gradually, however, this habit was broken, and\r\nat first they went two or three days without an evacuation, then four\r\nor five days, and finally a week. It then became their custom to take\r\na large dose of epsom salts on Saturday night and spend most of the\r\nday on Sunday getting rid of the accumulated excrementitious material\r\nof the whole week.\r\n\r\nThey taught Sunday School in the afternoons, and as the elimination of\r\nthe accumulation of week-long material interfered with this, they\r\ngradually acquired the habit of doing their Sunday School work on\r\nalternate Sundays, each taking the other Sunday for evacuation\r\npurposes. It might be expected that this serious abuse of function\r\nwould soon lead delicate girls, compelled to work full eleven hours a\r\nday, into rapid serious breakdown. But it did not. This state of\r\naffairs continued for more than a year. Then finally one Sunday, the\r\nmore delicate of the two girls found it impossible to open her bowels\r\nat the end of two weeks, and though she stayed at home the next Sunday\r\nfound it likewise impossible. Had not the directress of the Sunday\r\nSchool, who had become interested in them, succeeded in gaining their\r\nconfidence, it is possible that they would not have consulted\r\nphysicians even for some time longer, though about three weeks had\r\npassed without an evacuation.\r\n\r\nProbably every physician in active practice has women patients who\r\nhave been constipated for successive periods of three or four days at\r\na time, for several months, without much disturbance of the general\r\ncondition. While, then, there are many nervous persons who are quite\r\nsure that they begin to notice definite symptoms within a few hours\r\nfrom the failure to have a motion of the bowels at the time when they\r\nhad been expecting it, it seems certain that this is generally rather\r\nthe result of anxiety and nervous worry than consequent upon any\r\nactual absorption of toxic materials--intestinal auto-intoxication--as\r\nthese patients, with a naive liking for nice long names, find such\r\nsatisfaction in describing their condition. A simple explanation of\r\nthe complete lack of inconvenience that is found in so many cases of\r\nconstipation, will neutralize the unfavorable auto-suggestion that\r\nexists, and make these people much less likely to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Individual Variation_.--Another suggestive item of information that\r\nshould be given those who are over-sensitive and anxious in the\r\nmatter, is that different individuals vary very much in the need for\r\nintestinal evacuation. Perfectly healthy people have lived long and\r\nhappy lives, having an intestinal evacuation only once every two days.\r\nWhether it may not in exceptional cases be rarer than this without\r\nserious injury, immediate or remote, {273} experience has not\r\ndefinitely settled. Many of these people with infrequent intestinal\r\nmovements, have gone on utterly unconscious of the frequency or\r\ninfrequency of the calls of nature, paying no attention at all to the\r\nmatter until by some chance remark or a newspaper health item, it is\r\nbrought forcibly to their notice. They have not had a symptom before\r\nof any kind, but now they begin to note all sorts of symptoms because\r\nthey try to order their lives after the supposed rule that they have\r\nheard or read.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anatomical Peculiarities_.--On the other hand, some people normally\r\nhave two evacuations a day, and seem to require them if they are to\r\nremain in the best physical condition. While daily evacuation is to be\r\nconsidered normal, individual departures from it in either direction\r\nmust be respected as quite within the bounds of good health. Sometimes\r\nthere are anatomical reasons, as the capacity of the large intestine.\r\nSometimes there are physiological factors, as the amount of food\r\ntaken, or the fullness or rapidity of function in the digestive tract.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmount of Food as a Causative Factor.--Frequency, or infrequency, of\r\nbowel movements seems to depend to a great degree on the amount eaten.\r\nIt is well known that two men of the same weight and doing the same\r\nwork often seem to require quite different amounts of food to enable\r\nthem to accomplish their tasks. This is what might be expected, since\r\nit holds true also for the consumption of fuel in heat machines.\r\nEngines built in exactly the same way often require quite different\r\namounts of fuel in order to release the same amount of energy. Where\r\nmen are large eaters, the amount of excrementitious material left will\r\nusually provoke, if not actually demand, more frequent evacuation than\r\nwhere the amount eaten is small. Variety of food also has an important\r\nbearing. Men who live largely on beef, milk, eggs and food materials\r\nthat do not leave much residue, do not require, indeed they cannot\r\nhave, frequent evacuations. Those who live almost exclusively on\r\nvegetables, with large amounts of residue, will require more frequent\r\nevacuation of the bowels. Certain other dietetic habits, as the amount\r\nof fluid taken with the meal, or whether food is eaten in the solid\r\nstate or cooked into purees, stews and the like, make a decided\r\ndifference, the reasons for which are obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nHabit in Treatment.--For the regulation of the bowels and the proper\r\ntreatment of constipation in nearly all cases, more weight must be\r\ngiven to the directions laid down for the patient's attitude of mind\r\nand habits of life than to drug treatment. The patient must be made to\r\nrealize that the directions given to him are much more important for\r\nthe effective relief of his condition, than is the medicine\r\nprescribed. As a rule, medicine is meant only to afford relief from\r\nimmediate inconvenience, in the hope that after a short time new\r\nhabits will be formed which will remove the habitual constipation by\r\ncorrecting certain hampering conditions that have unfortunately become\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Habitual Evacuations_.--By far the most important element in the\r\ntreatment is to make the patient realize that habit plays the largest\r\nrole in the regular evacuation of the bowels. A child, even under two\r\nyears, can, by tempting it at certain times to evacuate its bowels, be\r\ngradually brought to establish a habit that will save much\r\ninconvenience for nurses and the family. This has actually been done\r\nfor most human beings now alive, and this same thing can be done at\r\nall stages of life. If a particular time be chosen, and the {274}\r\nindividual habitually goes to the toilet at that time, results may be\r\nconfidently expected. It is rather important that the time chosen be\r\none when there is not much hurry nor anxiety, and when it is\r\nreasonably certain that the same time can be taken every day. It is\r\nsurprising how much so simple a bit of advice as this will do for many\r\npeople who have considered that they have been suffering great\r\ndiscomfort from habitual constipation. Between the persuasion that an\r\noccasional failure to have a movement is not serious and the definite\r\nhabit of journeying to the toilet room at a particular time, whether\r\nthe desire is felt or not, many cases of habitual constipation will\r\ndisappear with, perhaps, only the necessity for the administration of\r\nsuch drugs as will prove laxative to a slight degree during the first\r\ntwo or three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngestion of Fluids an Important Influence.--After the suggestion of a\r\nhabit and its extremely efficient influence, the most important idea\r\nthat a patient suffering from constipation must be made to grasp, is\r\nthe necessity for fluids. That there shall be easy movement of\r\nexcrementitious material in the digestive tract, there must be fluid\r\nenough ingested to keep the residue, after digestion, thoroughly\r\nmoist, so as not to allow it to become dry and compact. To secure\r\nthis, a reasonable amount of liquids must be taken. So much has been\r\nsaid in recent years about the actual and possible harm of taking much\r\nfluid with meals, because of the danger of diluting the gastric juice,\r\ndilating the stomach and the like, that many persons who eat under the\r\ncontrol of their reasons rather than their instincts, have very\r\nmaterially lessened the amount of liquids taken at meal time. This is\r\nundoubtedly one of the reasons why constipation has become more common\r\nin the last half century. In the olden time considerable quantities of\r\nfluid were taken at meals. With people in our time deliberately\r\ndiminishing the quantity, there is often not enough fluid ingested to\r\nkeep the human economy in proper working order. Prof. Hawk's work\r\nshows how utterly wrong was this limitation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary excretion of water through the kidneys should be at least\r\nthree pints, another pint is exhaled from the lungs--the quantity is\r\neven more than this in steam-heated houses where no provision for\r\nmoistening inhaled air is made--and probably still another pint is\r\nneeded for other purposes, perspiration, nasal and ocular secretion,\r\nand the like. Two quarts and a half to three quarts of liquid must be\r\ndaily ingested then, and unless special care is taken to see that this\r\namount is consumed the system may have to get on with much less, but\r\nas can readily be understood, not without difficulty. The ordinary\r\nglass of water does not contain half a pint; the ordinary tea cup\r\nprobably holds not more than from four to six ounces. A glass of water\r\nand a cup of tea or coffee is about the limit of consumption of fluids\r\nat meals for ordinary people, and some take even less. Except in hot\r\nweather, comparatively few regularly take any fluids between meals. At\r\nthe most, then, three or four pints of liquid is taken, instead of\r\nfive or six, and the consequence is that the intestinal contents are\r\ndeprived of their fluids by the call of the system for more liquids.\r\nPeristalsis has, therefore, to overcome the sluggish movement of the\r\nexcrementitious material, which usually does not contain as much\r\nliquid as would make its movement easy and normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nResidual Material.--The next most important consideration after the\r\namount of fluid in the intestines, is the amount of the residuum which\r\nthe lower bowel has to move. Evacuation of the intestines is to a\r\ngreat degree {275} a mechanical arrangement. When sufficient material\r\nis contained in the lower bowel, it pushes on ahead of it the matter\r\nthat has been gathered there during the immediately preceding time,\r\nand so leads to an accumulation in the rectum that brings about reflex\r\nevacuation. It is only indigestible material that is thus excreted. If\r\nsufficient indigestible material is not taken with the food, there\r\nwill not be sufficient residue left after digestion to call for the\r\nexercise of the evacuant function of the intestines, and the\r\nconsequence will be sluggishness and failure to bring about daily\r\nmovements. Originally nature provided food materials so arranged that\r\nthe amount of indigestible material was sufficient for the exercise of\r\nperistaltic function; or rather perhaps, the regularity of peristaltic\r\nmovement is of itself a development from the habits that were\r\ngradually formed in moving the residue that is normally left from food\r\nmaterials in the state in which they are produced by nature.\r\n\r\nFood materials are no longer taken to any great extent in the form in\r\nwhich they are provided by nature. We have learned to eliminate the\r\ncoarser indigestible portions. Bread used to be made of the whole\r\nwheat, and of rather coarse flour, leaving a large residue for\r\nperistalsis to exercise itself on. Now only fine white flour is used,\r\nleaving a minimum undigested. Vegetables used to be taken with much\r\nmore waste material attached to them than is the case now. After being\r\nbaked, potatoes were often eaten with the skins on, apples and other\r\nfruits were eaten unpared and many of the coarser vegetables, turnips,\r\ncarrots, beets, and greens of various kinds that leave large\r\nproportions of waste were much more commonly used. Movements of the\r\nbowels depend on this residue. If it is not present the bowel\r\nmovements will not take place with the regularity observed when food\r\nwith more residue is consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet--Prof. Otto Cohnheim, in his lecture before The Harvey Society in\r\nNew York, December, 1909, emphasized the necessity for a mixed diet.\r\nThe less vegetables are taken, the less cellulose remains undigested\r\nto stimulate peristalsis. Liquids find their way through the\r\nintestines by a system of percolation, and do not excite peristaltic\r\nmovements. Meat, if well digested, is almost entirely dissolved in the\r\nstomach and becomes a fluid. Vegetables are passed on to the\r\nintestines as a rather thick paste. Occasionally, in the midst of this\r\npaste there are portions of food of good size. Those excite\r\nperistalsis; hence the necessity for vegetables in the diet, if\r\nperistaltic movements and regular evacuations are to take place. This\r\nphysiological law is poorly understood. Patients have heard so much\r\nabout the indigestibility of starches, that whenever they have any\r\nuncomfortable feelings in their abdominal region, supposed to be due\r\nto indigestion, they commonly eliminate vegetables from their dietary\r\nwith the consequence that their disturbed condition is likely to be\r\nemphasized rather than improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limitation of Diet_.--Just as soon as a patient's attention is\r\nattracted forcibly to any tendency to constipation, he is almost sure\r\nto conclude that this is a symptom of indigestion and he proceeds to\r\nput into practice all the rules which he has heard and read for the\r\ntreatment of indigestion. The first of these is elimination from the\r\ndiet of all indigestible food products, including most of the\r\nvegetables. The result is a vicious circle of cause and effect by\r\nwhich constipation is rendered worse than before. This needs {276} to\r\nbe explained to intelligent patients in order to make them understand\r\nthat some of the new habits which they have been forming and which\r\nthey are prone to think highly hygienic, of cutting off all food\r\ncontaining indigestible material, are really important factors in the\r\ncausation of further intestinal disturbance. It will often be found\r\nthat the real reason for patients' inability to have daily evacuations\r\nof the bowels, is that they have become persuaded that various forms\r\nof food are either indigestible on general principles, or else are\r\nindigestible for them. For this reason they have eliminated from their\r\ndiet most of nature's ordinary and quite natural provocations to\r\nintestinal evacuation, only to have to substitute artificial means to\r\nthe same end in the form of the various laxatives.\r\n\r\nIt is important to talk this matter over with patients; otherwise the\r\ntrue cause of their constipation may be missed. For instance, from the\r\nvery beginning of human life an excess of fat acts as a lubricant of\r\nthe intestine, and as a material by means of which other and more\r\nconcentrated objectionable matter that needs to be eliminated is\r\ncarried out with as little friction as possible. Mother's milk\r\ncontains from one-fourth to one-third more fat than the baby can use\r\nin its economy. This is meant to furnish a lubricant for the large\r\nintestine. It is a residue that will aid in securing movements of the\r\nbowels at regular intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fats_.--Many people who come to their physicians complaining of\r\nhabitual constipation have been told, or have read, that fat is rather\r\nindigestible, and, as a consequence, they have eliminated from their\r\ndietary all fatty materials. Even butter they use but sparingly, and\r\nthey exchange the cream in their tea or coffee for plain milk; they\r\ncarefully remove as much as possible of the fat of meat and they\r\nabstain from all sauces in which fat is employed. Such practices make\r\nnormal, natural, regular evacuations of the bowels extremely\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugars_.--Another food material that is a valuable aid to nature for\r\nthe stimulation of peristalsis is sugar. In its digestion, a certain\r\namount of fermentation takes place, and the gas from this stimulates\r\nperistalsis. Of course, there may be excessive fermentation, and then\r\nharm rather than good, is done. Ordinarily a certain amount of sugar\r\nis demanded by nature and practically all the food materials, even the\r\nmeats, contain it. All the starches from vegetables have, as the end\r\nproducts of their digestion, various forms of sugary material. These\r\nare just the classes of foods that many nervous persons, suffering\r\nfrom constipation and anxious about their digestion, eliminate from\r\ntheir diet under the mistaken notion that they are indigestible, or\r\nare productive of undesirable fermentations. When they do so, it is\r\nnot surprising that their constipation should be emphasized and that\r\nthey should have to ingest other irritant materials, laxatives, to\r\nreplace the sugars. It is probable that where constipation exists in\r\nthe bottle-fed infant, the addition of a little brown sugar to the\r\nwater with which the milk is diluted, is the safest and most natural\r\nway of correcting the sluggishness of the intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supposed Idiosyncrasies_.--The physician will in many cases meet with\r\nthe objection that some of these materials that he is recommending\r\ndisagree with his patient. Most of the presumed idiosyncrasies in the\r\nmatter of food are founded on extremely insufficient evidence.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently young persons who are thin and inclined to be {277}\r\nconstipated, and who need to take fats plentifully, do not care at all\r\nfor butter. Sometimes this is founded on nothing more than the fact\r\nthat at some time or other the butter provided for them was rather\r\npoor, and they got out of the habit of eating it. Now they assume that\r\ntheir disinclination is physiological. In this regard, as with milk, a\r\nlittle careful persistence will usually convince the person that there\r\nis no natural obstacle and no good reason why they should not partake,\r\nin moderate quantities at least, of this extremely valuable article of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOften the supposed idiosyncrasy against a food is due to no better\r\nreason than that on a single occasion it disagreed, owing to its\r\npreparation, the circumstances under which it was eaten, or the\r\nmaterials with which it was associated. An aversion, for instance, to\r\nso nutritious and so valuable a food-stuff as hog-meat will be\r\nacquired for no better reason than that fried ham or bacon disagreed\r\nwith the patient on one or more occasions. Such people when told that\r\nham, boiled so thoroughly that it crumbles in the fingers, is a\r\nfavorite mode of giving meat to convalescents in European hospitals\r\nand that it agrees very well with them, will often be tempted to try\r\nit. Then they find they have been harboring an illusion as to their\r\nsupposed idiosyncrasy for hog-meat. Nearly the same thing is true of\r\nbacon. A trial or two of crisp bacon, with the fat so thoroughly\r\ncooked out of it that it may be eaten out of the fingers without\r\nsoiling them, will often convince those who doubt of their ability to\r\neat it, how tasty a nutriment it is. Bacon is one of the most precious\r\ndietetic adjuvants in the treatment of constipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise.--There is always a serious difficulty in the treatment of\r\nconstipation in stout people. To counsel fats and starches and liquids\r\nin the quantities necessary to bring about regular natural movements\r\nof the bowels, through the mechanical presence of a sufficient amount\r\nof residue, will often add greatly to their weight. For them,\r\nexercises are needed. Not exercise in general, for many a man who\r\ntakes abundant exercise may be constipated. I have patients with this\r\ncomplaint who are letter carriers, expressmen, even stevedores, and\r\nthe like. The mere absence of a sedentary occupation will not\r\nguarantee against constipation. Motormen and conductors not\r\ninfrequently suffer from it. What is needed particularly is exercise\r\ndirected to the strengthening of the abdominal muscles, and the\r\nincrease of peristalsis.\r\n\r\nFor this certain leg exercises that can be readily and easily done in\r\nless than five minutes each day will be found useful. A patient may be\r\ndirected to lie on his back, lift up the leg as high as possible in\r\nthe extended position, and do that with each leg an increasing number\r\nof times every day. At the end of a month he is able to lift each leg\r\nup forty or fifty times at each trial. This exercise twice a day,\r\nmorning and evening, just before and after sleep, will usually relieve\r\nthe constipation. The bringing up of the thigh on the abdomen as far\r\nas possible, not only acts as a sort of massage upon the abdomen\r\nitself, but the bellying of the large muscles within the pelvic and\r\nabdominal regions mechanically helps the movement of the intestinal\r\ncontents. If, in addition to this, the patient gradually accustoms\r\nhimself to rise to a sitting from a lying position, the constipation\r\nwill almost invariably yield. In stout people, the presence of fat in\r\nthe abdominal wall seems to weaken the muscles so that the intestines\r\nare not compressed as they should be in ordinary conditions, and\r\nperistalsis seems to be thus interfered with.\r\n\r\n{278}\r\n\r\nA heavy wooden (bowling) ball rolled on the surface of the abdomen,\r\nbeginning low down in the right lower quadrant up towards the liver,\r\nacross just above the umbilicus, and then down on the left is often\r\nadvised. It is a good remedy but not better than the simple exercises\r\nof the leg and abdominal muscles suggested. The use of the ball has\r\nthe advantage of novelty, and of distinctly adding to the suggestive\r\nvalue of the exercise treatment. It is particularly valuable for\r\nwomen. All of these exercises have a distinct value from their\r\nsuggestive side. If thus twice a day for three minutes people are made\r\nto recall while doing the exercises the necessity for taking an\r\nabundance of fluid, forming a habit with regard to movements of the\r\nbowels and eating so as to encourage peristalsis, a definite good\r\neffect will be produced. In the treatment of stout people\r\nparticularly, it is important to remember that the use of sufficient\r\nsalt, and then of certain of the natural salts, as Carlsbad or Hunyadi\r\nJanos, may be of distinct advantage for their obesity. If taken\r\nregularly in small amounts, that is, just enough to help to a movement\r\nof the bowels, and if varied from time to time and occasionally\r\ninterrupted while some other form of laxative is taken, much good may\r\nbe done. It is as well to take simple irritants of this kind as some\r\nof the irritant foods that will have a tendency to add to their\r\naccumulation of fat, though they may increase peristalsis.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence of Position.--Little things may mean much in the matter of\r\nthe regular movements of the bowels. In my student days in France, our\r\nlittle hotel in the Quartier had the old-fashioned water-closets\r\nconsisting of a hole in the floor in one corner, and a place to put\r\none's feet properly beside it, thus reverting to the old-fashioned\r\nnatural method of bowel evacuation. Some of the American students\r\nfound it an uncomfortable proceeding at the beginning, but, on the\r\nother hand, some of them who had suffered from constipation in America\r\nwere no longer troubled that way. I have found in quite a few cases of\r\nyounger men that the suggestion to revert to this natural mode of\r\nevacuation helped in the formation of the habit of having bowel\r\nmovements at a regular time. How much of the effect was physical and\r\nhow much was mental seemed hard to decide. The suggestion was\r\nparticularly valuable in my experience with patients of the better\r\neducated classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNEUROTIC INTESTINAL AFFECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a whole series of intestinal affections dependent on nerve\r\ninfluence that get worse and better under stress of emotion or relief\r\nfrom it. Probably the commonest of these is constipation, which is\r\ndealt with in a separate chapter. Often these nervous intestinal\r\nconditions are associated with other neurotic manifestations. On the\r\nother hand, patients are seen who are absolutely without any other\r\nsign of the neurotic habit, and have nothing like hysteria, yet who\r\nsuffer severely and rather frequently from intestinal neuroses. Most\r\nof the people who react symptomatically to the eating of strawberries,\r\nor of shellfish, or of pork in any form, or cheese or other milk\r\nproducts, also have a definite tendency to certain skin neuroses and\r\nto suffer from intestinal troubles as a consequence of emotional\r\nstates. It is hard to trace {279} real causation in many of these\r\ncases, because it is so easy to accept the patient's expressions that\r\nthey must have taken cold, or they must have eaten something that\r\ndisagreed with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Diarrhea.--But it must not be forgotten that nervousness\r\nalone, without any additional factor, may produce a disturbance of the\r\nfunctions of the intestines, and may even increase peristalsis and\r\nbring about severe diarrhea. Anyone who has observed students going to\r\nexaminations has surely seen many examples of this. There are some\r\nindividuals--fortunately they are rather rare--who always suffer from\r\ndiarrhea when they have to take a serious examination. Some of these\r\ncases are pitiable because the effects are quite beyond control, and\r\nmake it almost impossible for them to do justice to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fright and Loss of Bowel Control_.--Severe disturbance, such as\r\nfright, may bring on this paralysis of proper regulation of\r\nperistalsis, with consequent imperative intestinal evacuation. A\r\nclassical case in history is that of James II, for whom the Irish\r\nsoldiers invented a special name because of the tradition that he\r\nsuffered from an intestinal accident in one of the battles with\r\nWilliam of Orange. The imputation of cowardice on the last of the\r\nunfortunate Stuarts has been completely wiped out by the investigation\r\nof recent historians, and James' character for bravery has been\r\nthoroughly vindicated. The fact that the story should have gained\r\ncredence shows that there is a general persuasion and popular\r\ntradition that such intestinal incidents do occur from fright. An\r\nincident told of the Franco-German War illustrates this, though I do\r\nnot vouch for the facts. Wishing to test the bravery of some soldiers\r\nwhom he was to send on a very dangerous expedition, and above all to\r\ntry how they would bear up even before the threat of instant death, an\r\nofficer of the French troops is said to have asked that half a dozen\r\nbrave men be sent to him. Without a word, he announced that there had\r\nbeen treason in the ranks, and that the army needed an example. They\r\nwere condemned to be shot. A platoon of soldiers was drawn up, the men\r\nwere placed with their backs to a wall and they were asked whether\r\nthey wished to be blindfolded. They refused though they protested that\r\nthey did not know why they were being put to death. Then the word fire\r\nwas given. All of the men, excepting one, fell down, though the guns\r\nof the firing party had been loaded with blank cartridges. The one who\r\nremained standing was told that he was the man who would be selected\r\nto go on the expedition, which, though perilous, was also of great\r\nglory for himself and profit for his country. He said that he was\r\nready to go, but he asked permission to be allowed to change his\r\nclothing, as he had not been able to keep as good control over his\r\nintestinal muscles, as he had over his muscles of station.\r\n\r\nFright often has this effect in children. These stories and traditions\r\nillustrate the influence of the mind and of deep emotions over the\r\nintestines, and while only profound mental disturbance will produce\r\nthe most serious effects, there seems no doubt that lesser emotions do\r\ninterfere with normal function. This phase of the subject serves to\r\nstrengthen the contention that over-attention to the bowels may bring\r\nabout constipation by causing increased inhibition of peristalsis,\r\njust as severe emotional disturbance may paralyze inhibition and so\r\nbring about increased peristalsis with consequent diarrheal symptoms.\r\n\r\n{280}\r\n\r\nHabitual Diarrhea.--There are certain forms of chronic diarrhea,\r\nusually considered most intractable, that owe their origin and\r\ncontinuance to neurotic conditions of the intestine, rather than to\r\nany gross organic lesion. In these cases the bowels acquire the habit\r\nof emptying themselves two or three or more times a day, and the\r\nstools are seldom formed. All sorts of physical treatment are employed\r\nfor these conditions, usually without avail, but whenever the\r\npatient's mind can be set at rest, and his attention distracted from\r\nhis bowels by thorough occupation with some interesting work, the\r\nintestinal disturbance gradually becomes less annoying. Ordinarily,\r\nwhen stools have been frequent for a prolonged period, the case is\r\nconsidered more or less unamenable to treatment. So far as ordinary\r\ndrug remedies go, this is true. What is needed is attention to the\r\npatient's mind, to his habits of life, and to his worries, and the way\r\nthat he takes them. The illustrations given of the influence of the\r\nmind over the bowels should make it clear that this therapeutic\r\nprinciple can be of far-reaching significance and must be applied\r\ndeliberately and with confidence in the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worry as a Factor_.--Very often it will be found that the diarrhea is\r\nparticularly bothersome on days when the patient is worried. In a\r\nclergyman friend and patient who was building a church, the approach\r\nof days on which bills and notes became due, was always the signal for\r\na diminished control over his bowels, and there were frequently three\r\nor four stools in the day. On his vacations, when eating unusual\r\nthings, drinking unaccustomed water, exposed to changes of\r\ntemperature, all the factors that give many people diarrhea, he was\r\nperfectly regular because the worries had been lifted from his mind.\r\nIn another case, where for fifteen or twenty years a writer living\r\nmuch indoors had had tendencies to diarrhea, always made worse by\r\nworries, self-discipline and the refusal to let troubles occupy him by\r\nalways turning to something else, did him so much good that he\r\nconsidered himself cured. In his case the return of a manuscript from\r\na magazine would always affect his bowels unfavorably. If, as\r\nsometimes happened, he found that the manuscript had been returned\r\nonly for some corrections, there would be an immediate relief of his\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange of Mode of life and Intestinal Control.--An interesting phase\r\nof the neurotic or mechanical disturbance of peristalsis is found in\r\nthe interference with regular movements of the bowels when persons are\r\naboard trains for long distances, or for more than twenty-four hours.\r\nThere are very few people who are not bothered in some way by such a\r\njourney. Those of a nervous temperament are likely to suffer from\r\ndiarrhea. This is usually attributed to catching cold because of\r\ndrafts, but in recent years, when well guarded Pullmans eliminate\r\ndrafts to a great extent, the bowel disturbance continues. For the\r\nmajority of people, however, constipation results. The cause of it\r\nseems to be due to a disturbance of peristalsis in the line of\r\ninhibition because of the vibration and jolting of the train. The more\r\nor less conscious assumption of definite positions of the muscles of\r\nthe abdominal region in order to save the body from the action of the\r\nunsteady movement of the train, seems to be reflected in the sphere of\r\nperistalsis with consequent constipation. There are other features,\r\nsuch as a lessened consumption of food and water and absence of\r\nexercise, that seem also to have an influence. If the journey is for\r\nseveral days patients should be advised to walk out during the longer\r\nstops.\r\n\r\n{281}\r\n\r\nMental Influence and Indifferent Remedies.--The best evidence that we\r\nhave of the influence of mind upon the intestinal tract, and the\r\nimportance of employing that factor for therapeutic purposes, is found\r\nin the number of cases of various intestinal disturbances, often\r\napparently chronic in character, which have been cured by the\r\nadministration of quite indifferent remedies. Dr. Hack Tuke in his\r\n\"Influence of the Mind on the Body\" reports a number of cases in which\r\nbread pills were used with good effect. _Pillulae micarum panis_ were\r\nnot an infrequent prescription in preceding generations. They are\r\nusually supposed to have been effective only against the curious\r\nsymptoms that develop in hysterical women, but it must not be\r\nforgotten that neurotic manifestations connected with the abdominal\r\nregion may occur very freely in men, and that treatment by suggestion\r\nin connection with some remedy, real or supposed, is the most\r\nefficient cure. The \"British and Foreign Medical Review\" for January,\r\n1847, has a series of cases among naval officers which were reported\r\nby a surgeon of long standing and wide experience. These cases include\r\npainful intestinal psycho-neuroses, occasionally accompanied by\r\ndiarrhea, and sometimes by constipation and sometimes even by\r\ndysenteric movements, all cured by bread pills when these were\r\nadministered in certain definite ways, and the patient's attention\r\nconcentrated on their expected effects. Bismuth lost its effect in one\r\ncase of repeated colic, opium was beginning to lose its effect. The\r\npatient was then told that on the next attack he would be put under a\r\nmedicine which was generally believed to be most effective, but which\r\nwas rarely used on account of its dangerous qualities, and that would\r\nnot be used unless he gave his consent. At the first sign of his next\r\nattack, a powder containing four grains of ground biscuit was\r\nadministered every seven minutes while within the hearing of the\r\npatient the greatest anxiety was expressed lest too much should be\r\ngiven. The fourth dose caused an entire cessation of pain. On four\r\nother occasions, the same remedy was employed with equal success for\r\nthe same sort of attack. In a seaman who was suffering from obstinate\r\nconstipation which resisted even the strongest purgatives, including\r\nCroton oil, pills consisting of two grains of bread were administered\r\nevery seven minutes, and the patient watched with very apparent\r\nanxiety lest an overdose should be given. Within two hours he began to\r\nhave nausea at his stomach, which had been foretold as one of the\r\nsymptoms to be expected, and his bowels were freely open almost\r\nimmediately after. Apparently the administration of the bread pills\r\neventually cured his constipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin and Intestinal Sympathy.--Curious intestinal conditions are, as I\r\nhave said, often associated with neurotic manifestations of other\r\nkinds. Attacks of hives and other neurotic skin disturbances are\r\ncommon in association with nervous diarrhea. Sometimes the attack of\r\nhives precedes the intestinal disturbance; sometimes it accompanies\r\nit. Soon after eating the offending material, the skin manifestations\r\nmay begin and other symptoms follow. Only a few minutes elapse, even\r\nwhen the patient does not know that the offending material has been\r\neaten, because it is concealed in some combination, yet the reaction\r\ntakes place evidently not from digestive absorption, but from\r\nintestinal reflex. Very often there is vomiting, as well as diarrhea.\r\nIt is not hard to understand that in these cases there is produced an\r\nirritation of the intestinal mucosa, corresponding to that seen in the\r\nskin. Whenever {282} this occurs, it is not surprising that there\r\nshould be evacuation of the contents of the digestive tract in every\r\nway that nature has provided for removing irritating material. The\r\nsimple nervous diarrhea is often spoken of as an \"intestinal blush,\"\r\nas the neurotic disturbance of the bladder which causes frequent\r\nurination is spoken of as a \"vesical blush.\" Blushing is certainly the\r\nexternal manifestation that corresponds most closely to the\r\ndisturbance that is probably the basis of these curious\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urticaria and Diarrhea_.--Patients who suffer from urticaria readily\r\nare almost sure to have other neurotic disturbances, and their\r\nintestines seldom escape. On the other hand, those who have an\r\nidiosyncrasy for certain kinds of food are almost sure to have other\r\nnervous neurotic disturbances, which emphasize the fact that these\r\ncurious idiosyncrasies are of reflex nervous origin, rather than due\r\nto any chemical irritation.\r\n\r\nSome of these lesions of the intestinal tract related to urticaria may\r\naffect, either primarily or secondarily, the biliary structures. Under\r\nthese circumstances there may be symptoms resembling true biliary\r\ncolic with some jaundice and pain that radiates toward the right\r\nshoulder. Whether these bile symptoms are due to the occurrence of\r\nactual urticarial lesions in the bile duct, or so close to the papilla\r\nof entrance of the gall passages into the intestine as to occlude it,\r\nis doubtful. Practically all the symptoms of the presence of biliary\r\ncalculus may be thus simulated. The differential diagnosis can only be\r\nmade by the rapid clearing up of the symptoms, and by the history of\r\nthe case. As a rule, where there is the story of repeated attacks of\r\nneurotic intestinal disturbance, the physician and especially the\r\nsurgeon, should be slow to conclude as to the presence of a serious\r\npathological condition anywhere in the intestinal tract, unless the\r\nsymptoms are absolute. This is all the more necessary because now, in\r\npatients' minds, the words appendicitis or biliary calculus are\r\nassociated with the thought of operation. This thought sometimes gives\r\nrise to so much dread as to seriously disturb the appetite and still\r\nfurther predispose the patient to the repetition of neurotic\r\nintestinal trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Abdominal Discomfort, the necessity for absolute\r\nassurance of some definite lesion before there is any question of\r\noperation, is insisted on. Here the disturbing mental influence of\r\nsuggestion, with regard to certain serious abdominal conditions, may\r\nbe emphasized. Many painful conditions in the abdomen are either\r\nprimarily or secondarily due to appendicitis. Most of these are quite\r\nacute, and practically all amenable to definite diagnosis. There is,\r\nhowever, a tendency to exaggerate the place that this organ holds in\r\nthe pathology of chronic cases. Many women who suffer from nothing\r\nmore than hysterical abdominal conditions are told by someone that\r\nthey have recurrent attacks of appendicitis, though there is nothing\r\nexcept their suggestive complaints of pain on which to found such a\r\ndiagnosis, and then it becomes extremely difficult to remove this idea\r\nfrom their minds, and contrary suggestion applied over a long period\r\nis the only therapeutics that favorably affects them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestinal Idiosyncrasies.--I have had the opportunity to see a series\r\nof cases of intestinal idiosyncrasy in a family that has been an\r\ninteresting study for many years. One of the members has the most\r\nexquisite case of susceptibility to various articles of food that I\r\nthink I have ever seen or heard of. {283} Even the eating of a little\r\nunrecognized pork in sausage will give rise to a diarrhea so intense\r\nthat there is no peace for hours, and slight movements take place\r\nevery few minutes. Towards the end of the attack, there is always\r\nconsiderable blood in the stools. Often the attack is preceded by\r\nvomiting. While in most people the idiosyncrasy is limited to one\r\narticle of food, this patient has it for all of the articles that are\r\nusually the subjects of idiosyncrasy. Besides pork, shell-fish will\r\nproduce vomiting and diarrhea within a few minutes, strawberries act\r\ndetrimentally at once, and cheese produces an almost immediate\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of this case is that occasionally an\r\nattack of diarrhea that is extremely severe, will occur merely as a\r\nconsequence of a strong emotional stress. Any great anxiety will have\r\nthis effect. The knowledge that someone has a telegram for her whose\r\ncontents she can not ascertain for a time, will act as a cathartic.\r\nShe also has other neurotic manifestations, especially of an\r\nurticarial character, that are equally interesting. On a number of\r\noccasions, when she has particularly prepared for some special event\r\nsuch as a wedding or reception, for which a new gown has been provided\r\nand preparations made with considerable solicitude to the end that she\r\nshall appear at her best, she has suffered from a severe attack of\r\nangio-neurotic edema affecting either her lips or her eye-lids so that\r\nit was absolutely impossible for her to be present at the social\r\nengagement. This has happened to her over and over again. On the first\r\ntwo occasions, one eye was closed completely by the edema. In each\r\ncase she attributed it to the sting of an insect. There was no sign of\r\nany sting, there was no itching or inflammation, the condition\r\npresented all the signs of angio-neurotic edema, had come without\r\nwarning, and disappeared in from 36 to 48 hours without leaving any\r\nmark or trace of its origin.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely not a sign of hysteria in this individual, nor is\r\nthere any tendency to what would be called an emotional neurotic\r\ncondition. On the contrary, she is lively and sensible, the life of\r\nher friends when they are ill, their consolation when they are in\r\ntrouble, and she herself has shown the power to bear trials and\r\ndifficulties. It is only the peripheral circulation in the intestinal\r\nmucosa, and in the skin, that passes from under her control. She\r\nneither laughs nor cries without reason and she has no other\r\nexaggerated nerve reactions. Even more interesting is the fact that\r\nthe angio-neurotic condition can be traced in the preceding\r\ngeneration, while the tendency to an intestinal neurosis complicated\r\nby diarrhea exists in a sister in this generation. Examinations are\r\nalways a source of grave distress to the sister. Although she is a\r\nbright intelligent woman she does not do justice to herself because of\r\nher nervousness. Usually she has a vomiting spell in the morning\r\nbefore the examination, and rather serious intestinal disturbance\r\nduring the day. That this is entirely neurotic is clear from its\r\nconstant disappearance immediately afterwards, and its constant\r\nreappearance whenever there is this form of emotional stress.\r\n\r\nIn certain of these cases of supposed neurotic, intestinal troubles,\r\none cause of the condition sometimes fails of recognition. Many of\r\nthese people are found on inquiry to be taking much more salt than\r\nusual. It is hard to understand how this occurs, but I have seen it in\r\na number of cases, sometimes in men, but much more frequently in\r\nwomen. Some sort of a vicious {284} circle has been formed: probably\r\ntheir original tendency to diarrhea led to a craving for salt, because\r\nof the excessive serous evacuations. Somehow, then, the habit of\r\ntaking more salt was formed and its presence reacted to produce\r\nirritative conditions in the patient, which, combined with neurotic\r\ntendencies, produced the intestinal disturbance. I have seen chronic\r\ndiarrhea, mucous diarrhea, and even mucous colitis, associated with\r\nthe over-free taking of salt. When salt was eliminated from the diet\r\nthe cases at once improved. We now realize the value of a salt-free\r\ndiet for many conditions disturbing osmosis, and the presence of serum\r\nwhere it should not be. It is probable that most people take more salt\r\nthan is good for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestinal Troubles Due to Air.--One of the most annoying intestinal\r\ntroubles due to a neurosis is the passage of air from the intestines,\r\nor in some people a rumbling through them, which is distinctly of\r\nneurotic origin. It is increased under emotional stress or whenever\r\nthere is anxiety with regard to it. This is much more common in the\r\nold than in the young, as if relaxation of tissues had much to do with\r\nit. Old men seldom complain of it to their physicians, but for obvious\r\nconventional reasons, we are rather often asked to control it in older\r\nwomen, and are occasionally asked to treat poignant cases of it in\r\nyoung women. The older women are often stout, of flabby constitution,\r\nand one has almost to accept the conclusion that the real trouble is\r\nsuch a relaxation of the intestinal walls that the empty intestines do\r\nnot fall together as they used to, but rather tend to lie apart from\r\none another with the production of spaces into which gases, perhaps by\r\ndiffusion from the blood, find their way and are expelled. Usually\r\nthese patients were stouter than they now are.\r\n\r\nOften after these patients have walked outside for some time,\r\nespecially if they have become quite tired, and then sit down inside\r\nand become warm, the expansion of the air in the intestines leads to\r\nsome rumbling and the production of flatus. This experience is so\r\ncommon with elderly people, when they come in in cold weather, that\r\nthey do not feel quite right unless it actually happens. The odor of\r\nthe flatus is seldom offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air Swallowing_.--There seems to be no doubt that a certain amount of\r\nair is swallowed, that it finds its way along the intestines, and\r\nthen, with the change of temperature on coming into the house,\r\nexpansion takes place and the air finds its way out. In certain\r\npatients the habit of swallowing air may grow, and the necessity for\r\nits evacuation, either by eructation or flatus, may be a source of\r\ngreat discomfort. The latter form of relief may be impossible owing to\r\nconditions, though it is quite as natural as other forms of the\r\nevacuation of the bowels, and it must not be considered pathological\r\nunless it becomes too frequent. People of other civilizations than\r\nours are not so sensitive in this matter. A late distinguished Chinese\r\nAmbassador to this country relieved himself of an accumulation of gas\r\nin his lower bowel quite as indifferently as he would have of gas in\r\nhis stomach--but without so much as \"by your leave\" and evidently\r\nwithout a thought of anything unseemly in the act--apparently to his\r\nown great satisfaction, though sometimes to the consternation of the\r\nbystanders. Utterly failing to understand why he should not permit\r\nhimself this satisfaction, he peremptorily refused to conform to our\r\nWestern refinements in this matter.\r\n\r\nIn many of these cases habit may add to the necessity for relief of\r\nthis {285} kind, and habit may require considerable self-discipline\r\nand training of organs to overcome it. To attempt to control this form\r\nof intestinal trouble by ordinary intestinal remedies, and especially\r\nby carminatives, is almost sure to increase it rather than do any\r\ngood. It is the patient's mental attitude toward the affection that\r\nmust be modified, and the intestinal bad habit must be brought under\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intestinal Uneasiness_.--In young women the cases are much more\r\nserious, for the presence of gas in the intestines sometimes leads to\r\nsuch dread of physical events over which they fear they may have no\r\ncontrol, that it makes it impossible for them to carry on their\r\nordinary occupations, hinders their conformance with social usages, or\r\neven their association with any but very near friends. The cases are\r\nnot frequent, but are poignant when they occur. Many young women\r\nsuffer from rumblings in the intestines whenever more than four hours\r\nhave passed since their last meal. This phenomenon is not likely to\r\nmanifest itself unless they are nervous, excited and worried over\r\nsomething, but is particularly likely to be troublesome when they are\r\nwith persons whom they are most solicitous to impress favorably. The\r\nmanifestation is undoubtedly associated with emptiness of the\r\nintestines and relief will usually be afforded by taking something to\r\neat, even something so simple as a glass of milk and some crackers,\r\nshortly before the time when the rumblings are usually heard. Dread of\r\nthis annoyance plays a large role in it, and it is due to an\r\nexaggeration of peristalsis with the consequent crowding into larger\r\nmasses of small quantities of air that ordinarily would find their way\r\nmuch more slowly along the intestinal tract. Milk of bismuth will do\r\nmore than anything else, though the presence of a certain quantity of\r\nfood is probably the best prophylactic and remedy.\r\n\r\nBesides these cases, there are some that are even more annoying. These\r\noccur in young women who have all the symptoms of an approaching\r\nintestinal evacuation, and then find when they have excused themselves\r\nthat there is nothing but gas to be passed. This gas is nearly always\r\nquite inoffensive, and is evidently air that has been present in the\r\nintestines for some time, and has in the midst of the excitement of\r\nperistalsis been forced on into the rectum and gives the sensation of\r\nan approaching stool. These cases are coming into notice much more\r\ncommonly since young women have taken up business occupations. The\r\nsymptoms are worse in those who are constipated, though sometimes in\r\nthese cases there are recurring attacks of diarrhea showing that the\r\nnormal function of the intestine is disturbed. It is more annoying\r\njust before and during menstruation than at any other time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physical Basis_.--Whenever the patients are run down in weight there\r\nis a distinct exaggeration of the condition. Whether the loss of\r\nweight, by removing fat from within the abdomen, does not tend to make\r\nthe intestines more ready to take up air and to produce these\r\nmanifestations is a question worth considering. The most annoying\r\ncases that I have seen were in people who had lost considerable weight\r\nand though there had been some tendency to the condition before they\r\nlost weight, it was doubtful whether the symptoms were greater than\r\nthose often seen and which are not productive of special annoyance\r\nexcept in very sensitive people. In three of these cases that have\r\nbeen under my observation in recent years, improvement came promptly\r\nwhen weight was put on. The presence of an abundance of fat in {286}\r\nthe abdominal cavity seemed properly to balance the intestines and to\r\ndampen peristalsis.\r\n\r\nReassurance, absence of worry, occupation of mind with interests that\r\nkeep it from putting such surveillance on the intestinal tract as will\r\nsurely be resented, must be the chief care of the physician. Without\r\nthese any relief afforded will be only temporary. With psychotherapy\r\nrelapses will occur, for these individuals are in a state of unstable\r\nintestinal equilibrium, but practically all the successful remedies of\r\nthe past have been founded on it and its effect may be renewed over\r\nand over again under various forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMUCO-MEMBRANOUS COLITIS\r\n\r\nProbably the severest, certainly the most interesting of the neurotic\r\nconditions of the intestines, is muco-membranous colitis. The only\r\nlesions discovered are those which point to a functionally increased\r\nsecretion of tenacious mucus from the lower bowel. No definite\r\npathological changes are known. The colic seems to be due to nothing\r\nmore than the effort of the large intestine to push off the thick\r\nmucus which has been secreted, and which in many cases clings to the\r\nbowel walls. This may be of such consistency that it is passed from\r\nthe bowel in the shape of tubular casts. These casts have often been\r\nseen in place in the lower bowel. While the word membranous used in\r\nconnection with the disease has produced the impression that this\r\nmight be a form of diphtheritic affection, it is now known that it is\r\nonly due to an abnormally increased function, and not to any\r\nstructural pathological condition or infection of the lower bowel. The\r\nmembranous material is often gelatinous, and so the casts may hang\r\ntogether in long pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Etiology.--It might be thought that such a cast could not be\r\nformed, remain in situ in the lower bowel for a considerable period,\r\nand then be passed as a whole, or in quite long portions, without\r\ncausing serious tissue disturbance in the mucous membrane. As Sir\r\nWilliam Osier says, in spite of the apparent improbability, the\r\nseparation may and usually does take place without any lesion even of\r\nthe surface of the mucous membrane. The epithelium seems to be left\r\nintact. Owing to the curious nature of the stools, the disease has\r\nbeen recognized for a long time and the descriptions of this disease\r\nby the older authors are very interesting. Muco-membranous colitis\r\noccurs mainly in nervous individuals, and is much more frequent in\r\nwomen than in men, but it is not limited to women. Some of the\r\nseverest cases have occurred in men, and Woodward, in the second\r\nvolume of \"The Medical and Surgical Reports of the Civil War,\" has an\r\nexhaustive description of the disease as it occurred among soldiers.\r\nIt is particularly those who are worried and run down from overwork\r\nand excitement who are likely to suffer from it, but it occurs\r\ntypically in people who, _faute de mieux_, worry about themselves.\r\nMost of its victims are self-centered, though not hysterical.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Increase in Number of Cases.--According to all the authorities,\r\nthere has been a considerable increase in the number of cases in\r\nrecent years. {287} At one watering place in France, Plombieres, which\r\nhas acquired the reputation for relieving, or even curing the disease,\r\nabout 400 cases had been under treatment during the course of about\r\ntwo years. This increase was attributed by Boas of Berlin to two\r\ncauses. First the struggle for life has become much more intense in\r\nour day, and the nervous conditions which are practically always the\r\nbasis of muco-membranous colitis, have as a consequence become more\r\nfrequent. Not only this, but mild cases that were not called to the\r\nattention of physicians in the past, have become so emphasized by the\r\nnervous worries of the strenuous life that now they seldom escape the\r\nphysician's attention. Besides our generation is getting away from the\r\nold-fashioned idea of patiently standing many pains and aches, and\r\nrefusing to call in a physician unless the condition persists or seems\r\nto be producing serious results. There are more cases of the disease,\r\nbut physicians also see more of the cases than formerly because\r\npatients come for treatment for slighter causes.\r\n\r\nDr. Boas considered that, besides the strenuous life, there was\r\nanother prominent factor in the increase of the disease. This is the\r\nabuse of laxatives and purgatives. Many of these have their principal\r\neffect on the lower bowel. In consequence the nervous mechanism of\r\nthis structure has been irritated to a point where occasionally\r\nexplosions of nerve force take place. This causes an increase of the\r\nsecretion, and a tendency to cramp-like contractions. While there is\r\nundoubtedly much of truth in this, there is no doubt that the most\r\nimportant factor in the disease is the patient's nervous condition.\r\nOnly those who are inclined to be introspective, to worry much about\r\nthemselves, and who are constantly examining their stools for the\r\npresence of mucus, suffer severely from the affection.\r\n\r\nVery few cases have been seen among the working classes. Most of the\r\ncases have hypochondriacal symptoms that sometimes go to the extent of\r\nreal melancholia and the full persuasion that they have an incurable\r\ndisease, a visitation on them for some real or fancied lapse from the\r\nlaws of health in earlier years. The affection usually lasts a long\r\ntime, or has been in existence for some years when the physician is\r\nasked to see it, and patients are made most miserable by it.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion and Over-attention.--The pathological\r\nphysiology of this disease, for, as has been said, it has no pathology\r\nin the proper sense of the word, is in many cases a problem of mental\r\ninfluence. For some reason, the patient gets his or her lower bowel on\r\nhis or her mind. There is so much talk of constipation and its evil\r\neffects in the newspapers, in advertisements and by suggestion from\r\nbill-boards and in the magazines as well as, sad to relate, in\r\nparlors, drawing-rooms and even dining-rooms, that it is easy for\r\nthose who are introspective and nervous about themselves, and who have\r\nsome little tendency to constipation already, to become much worried\r\nabout it. If, then, as was suggested by Boas, they take laxatives in\r\nprofusion, the irritation set up further fixes the attention on this\r\nportion of the body. After a while, in these people, a goodly portion\r\nof the waking hours are spent in thoughts with regard to the lower\r\nbowel. The morning thought is the possibility of a stool to-day,\r\nfollowed by conjecture as to its character. After the stool has taken\r\nplace, if there seems anything abnormal about it, comes a morbid dread\r\nof the consequences of having such stools.\r\n\r\n{288}\r\n\r\nThis constant attention sends down a lot of impulses to the lower\r\nbowel. Anyone who has studied the psychology of attention knows how\r\nmuch influence can be exerted on the skin, or on the mucous surface by\r\nmental influence. Hyperemia is produced, and this leads to over-action\r\nof the glands of the large intestine. These glands secrete a glairy\r\nmucus which is necessary to protect the bowel from the offensive\r\nmaterial that is always present, and from the hardened material that\r\nis so often there when there is a tendency to constipation. This mucus\r\nis secreted in large quantities, while at the same time a hyperemia of\r\nthe colon tends to interfere with peristalsis and consequently to\r\ndelay the passage of contents and to keep the mucus in place. An\r\naccumulation goes on for some time, until irritation is set up by the\r\npresence of such a large quantity of material in the intestine, and\r\nthen colicky efforts for its removal are occasioned. All of this\r\nprocess is accompanied by suggestive reactions upon the mind that\r\nfurther complicate the case. This story of the affection points out\r\nthe indications for treatment. Unless the patient's mind can be\r\ndiverted from its constant attention to the lower bowel, the\r\npossibility of cure is distant, and even after such diversion any\r\nreturn of attention is likely to bring on a relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The treatment of this affection emphasizes its neurotic\r\norigin. We have had any number of cures for it and each one has\r\nactually relieved many patients. The more trouble the cure involves,\r\nand the greater the impression produced on the patient's mind the more\r\nlikely is there to be a relief of symptoms. All sorts of drugs have\r\nbeen employed. Many of them have for a time been heralded as more or\r\nless specific. The important thing, however, was that the patients\r\nshould come predisposed to believe that they were going to be\r\nimproved, and then that suggestion should be made at frequent\r\nintervals--a combination of auto-suggestion through the administration\r\nat regular intervals for a long period of simple remedies with the\r\nconfident suggestion of the physician that the patient will get\r\nbetter. Local treatment of various kinds has been reported to bring\r\nabout improvement. The more difficult this is, and the longer it\r\ntakes, as well as the more bother it involves for the patient and the\r\nattendant, the better the response to it is likely to be. Long rectal\r\ntubes were found beneficial in many cases, though they failed in many\r\nothers, and most physicians have seen relapses occur in spite of the\r\ncontinuance of the treatment that at first did much good. High\r\ninjections of water containing various drugs, and of olive oil\r\nsometimes bring improvement though they afford no guarantee against a\r\nrelapse. Mineral waters do good only in the suggestive environment of\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Surgery and Suggestion_.--The symptoms have sometimes been so severe\r\nand the complaints of the patients have been so great that even\r\nsurgery of serious character has been recommended and tried in some of\r\nthese cases. The making of an artificial anus in the right inguinal\r\nregion, so that for a time the feces are not allowed to pass over the\r\ncolon mucous membrane has been tried. This gives decided relief from\r\nthe symptoms, but when the artificial anus is allowed to close,\r\nrecurrences often take place. It has been suggested, therefore, that\r\nthe artificial anus should be allowed to stay open for months, but\r\neven this seems to afford no guarantee against a relapse. In recent\r\nyears the appendix has been taken out through the opening in the right\r\ninguinal region, and a portion of it allowed to remain through which,\r\nwhen {289} fastened to the abdominal wall, injections might be made\r\ninto the colon. In these cases ice-water has been found probably of\r\nmore effect than any drug solutions. This rather serious surgical\r\nprocedure is, however, as yet on trial, and we do not know enough\r\nabout the after-course of the cases to be sure that it has any\r\npermanent effect.\r\n\r\nA strong suggestion is involved in the removal of the appendix, and\r\nthe use of the stump of it as an irrigating tube. When the treatment\r\nconsists of something that is so strongly excitant of feeling as\r\nice-water, applied directly to the colon, it is easy to understand\r\nthat suggestion reaches the limit of its possibilities. No wonder\r\nthese cases improve, though we are not sure as yet what happens after\r\nthe appendix opening is allowed to close, or is deliberately sutured.\r\nI should expect a recurrence of symptoms, if ever a time came when the\r\npatient was run down in weight and worried by external conditions,\r\nintrospection, and above all by concentration of attention on the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direct Suggestion_.--The question is whether suggestion can be used\r\nto advantage in these cases without employing any of the radical\r\nmeasures that have been suggested. There is no doubt that at certain\r\nwatering places where a specialty is made of this disease, and to\r\nwhich patients go, sure that they are going to be much better than\r\nbefore, and where they see patients all round them who are improving,\r\nthey often get complete relief. This is only what might be expected.\r\nWhether a similar effect can be produced by simple suggestion when the\r\npatient is thoroughly convinced that the physician understands the\r\ncase, and that if they will respond he can cure it, remains to be\r\nseen. I know that mild cases improve rapidly under simple hygienic\r\nmeasures, with a renewal of confidence in the possibility of relief,\r\nand with the diversion of the patient's mind from the intestinal\r\ndifficulty. This is the most important factor in the treatment, as it\r\nis the most important factor in pathology. If the patient's nerve\r\ncenters can be kept from sending down impulses causing exaggerated\r\naction of the glands, then there is some hope of relief. A habit has\r\nbeen formed in the matter, and a habit can only be broken by a series\r\nof acts, just as it was formed. It is not effort for a few days nor a\r\nweek that counts in these cases, but diversion of mind for long\r\nperiods, until normal function is restored. It is usually quite\r\nimpossible to keep up this improvement constantly in nervous patients.\r\nThere are setbacks, but then this is true in every form of nervous\r\naffection. It is, then, that the renewed suggestion of the physician\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Resort Cures and Suggestion_.--Physicians often tell patients that\r\nmuco-membranous colitis is incurable, or at least emphasize strongly\r\nthat it is very refractory to treatment, and that it is prone to\r\nrelapse even after improvement. After a certain number of physicians\r\nhave insisted on these points, it is inevitable that patients should\r\nnot respond readily to treatment, and that they should be solicitous\r\nabout themselves, even when improvement does come.\r\n\r\nIt is most important then to bring about the neutralization of these\r\nunfavorable suggestions. This is what is particularly accomplished at\r\nthe health resorts where muco-membranous colitis is successfully\r\ntreated. At these the patients see other sufferers from the disease\r\nwho proclaim how much better they are and some at least who are\r\nentirely cured. The waters {290} used at these health resorts are not\r\nnearly so efficient when used at a distance because of this lack of\r\nadditional suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe most efficacious treatment of muco-membranous colitis then is to\r\nbring the patient up to normal weight, for they are often thin people,\r\nquiet their solicitude about themselves, give them a bland and\r\nirritating diet and get them away from worries or anxieties about\r\nthemselves or others. I know cases in physicians where the effect of\r\nworry of any kind can be traced very clearly in the increased symptoms\r\nof their colitis and the greater frequency of attacks. It is\r\nparticularly important not to give habit-forming drugs in these cases\r\nfor they always do harm. Where the pain is much complained of the\r\ncoal-tar anodynes are useful, but ice in the rectum or even\r\nsuppositories of gluten, or of cocoa butter without any medication\r\noften prove useful. Most of these patients watch prescriptions that\r\nare given them rather carefully and make up their mind beforehand\r\nwhether they are likely to do them good or not and the event usually\r\nfollows their premonition. They often have habits of self-drugging\r\nwhich must be stopped and always carefully inquired into for they will\r\nsometimes continue to take things for themselves in spite of being\r\nunder the doctor's care. If they have heard of surgical treatment for\r\ntheir affection they are likely to think that they will have to come\r\nto it eventually and this prevents a favorable attitude of mind\r\ntowards their affection. Unless this is secured no treatment will\r\nprove efficient. With it almost anything that keeps up the suggestion\r\nwill greatly relieve and often will actually cure the condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOBESITY\r\n\r\nObesity, popularly considered to be an over-accumulation of fat, is\r\nsometimes thought to exist only when there is the large development of\r\nabdomen which is more properly designated corpulency. In its strictly\r\nscientific sense it represents excessive over-weight, that is, above\r\ntwenty per cent. more of weight than is normal for the height of the\r\nparticular individual. (See table of weight for height in chapter\r\nWeight and Good Feeling.) The Latin derivation of the word gives also\r\nits etiology. Ob-ese means having eaten too much. It is a question of\r\nfailure of due proportion between the taking of nutrition and the\r\noxidation processes within the body. More food being taken than is\r\nneeded, there is an accumulation of it in the form of fat, and this is\r\ndeposited by natural preference in certain places, such as the\r\nabdomen, the breasts and in the _panniculus adiposus_ beneath the\r\nskin. The fats and starches are most readily converted into this fat,\r\nbut under certain circumstances proteid material may be turned into\r\nfat, and then a true pathological condition develops resembling\r\ndiabetes in certain ways.\r\n\r\nThe metabolism of fat is rather simple, but this may be disturbed by\r\nbad habits. When such large quantities of sugar-making materials are\r\ntaken that they are beyond the power of the normal metabolism to\r\ndispose of, they are excreted in the urine with the production of what\r\nis known as physiological {291} glycosuria. In the same way, the\r\neating of a superabundance of fat-forming food leads to the deposition\r\nof fat in the tissues where, when in excess, it is just as much wasted\r\nas if it were excreted. Physiological glycosuria is, however, usually\r\nconsidered to be dangerous, inasmuch as its frequent occurrence may\r\ndisturb the normal metabolism of sugar, and lead to diabetes. In the\r\nsame way, the over-consumption of fat-forming materials may disturb\r\nthe fatty metabolism, and lead even to the changing of proteid\r\nmaterials into fat. This represents a real disease requiring careful\r\nmanagement, while ordinary obesity needs only the exercise of the\r\npatient's will to secure such proportion between the amount of food\r\ntaken, and the amount of exercise and fresh air, as will not only\r\nprevent accumulation of fat but will lead to the reduction of any\r\naccumulation that may, through neglect of this care, already have\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver-eating.--The putting on of weight depends on the individual's\r\ncraving for food, and his satisfaction of his appetite. While it is\r\nnot ordinarily looked at from this standpoint, this craving for food\r\nand the habit of satisfying it which is developed, is not very\r\ndifferent from the craving for stimulants and the habit that forms\r\nwith regard to them. People insist that they can not eat less--that\r\ntheir appetite simply requires them to eat. We have all heard this\r\nstory over and over again from the man who craves alcoholic\r\nstimulation. Usually the obese can be persuaded more easily than the\r\ninebriate to break off their habit, but they relapse into it even more\r\neasily than he does. It is comparatively easy to limit the appetite,\r\nor rather to forego the satisfaction of eating abundantly, for a week\r\nor two weeks or even a month, but the effort finally becomes appalling\r\nand the consequence is a relapse. If the patient really wants to lose\r\nweight, in nine cases out of ten it is a comparatively simple matter.\r\nThe trouble is that they want to lose in weight without giving up the\r\nsatisfaction of eating.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Exercise.--The second factor in obesity--lack of sufficient\r\nexercise, is even more important than the habit of over-eating. This\r\nis illustrated very well by the cases of certain animals who, without\r\nany tendency to fat accumulation by nature, but rather the contrary,\r\nacquire fat to a marked degree, owing to the habits that are forced on\r\nthem by their relations to human beings. A typical example is the pet\r\ndog. Dogs living their natural active lives, have little tendency to\r\nput on superfluous flesh. Kept in the house in cities, they\r\npractically always put on weight until, after some years, many of them\r\nare quite incapable of moving except in an awkward waddle, often\r\ncomically symbolizing their mistresses in this respect. Besides the\r\ninactivity, the dog is subject to the influence of the other cause of\r\nobesity, the over-eating of fat producing material. Another typical\r\nexample, and one that provides evidence of the pathological tendency\r\nto fat accumulation, is found in the Strasburg geese from whom the\r\nfatty goose livers for _pates de foie gras_ are obtained. Geese are\r\nplaced in a warm underground room, in a mass of cement that gradually\r\nhardens round their feet keeping them almost completely inactive, and\r\nthen they are fed abundantly with fat-forming materials. The absence\r\nof light and air, and the immobility, leads to the production of the\r\nfatty changes, eventually producing the enlarged fatty livers, which\r\ndelight the gourmet's palate.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the dog and the goose is exemplified in the lives of\r\nall other {292} animals. The fattening process is well understood by\r\nbutchers--keep the animal inactive and supply an abundance of\r\nfattening food. The inactivity is even more important than the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxsis.--Of course, if obesity is to be successfully treated,\r\ncases must be seen early and before there has been a large\r\naccumulation of fat. When people are more than 10 per cent. over\r\nweight they are in the danger zone, and with 20 per cent. above the\r\nnormal, decrease must come or the condition becomes inveterate. It is\r\nbetween these two points and not when they are forty or fifty pounds\r\nover weight that they need the advice of a physician and the careful\r\ninstitution of regular life to prevent further fat accumulation. After\r\nthe body has carried thirty or forty pounds over weight for some time,\r\nit has acquired the habit of accumulating fat, rather than using it,\r\nand this, once acquired, is hard to break. Every additional pound\r\ntempts to the formation of lazy or sluggish habits because of the\r\nadditional weight that has to be carried around. Everyone knows how\r\nhard it is to walk a few blocks a little briskly carrying a suit case\r\nthat weighs thirty pounds. Even twenty pounds soon proves to be a\r\nburden. Fat in the tissues, though it seems to be a portion of the\r\nindividual, is really quite outside of him and consists of extra food\r\nmaterial that the body is carrying round, having accumulated it for\r\nthe purpose, apparently, of using it at some time when it should be\r\nnecessary. While carrying this burden, people have little inclination\r\nto an active life. Inactivity lowers oxidation processes and leaves\r\nthem with an additional tendency to fat accumulation because of lack\r\nof oxidation. In a word, a vicious circle of cause and effect is\r\nformed. Accumulation of fat prevents the taking of proper exercise,\r\nand lack of exercise leads to further accumulation of fat!\r\n\r\nNot only should the treatment of obesity begin early in a particular\r\ncase, but, in families where there is a recognized tendency to take on\r\nfat, it should begin early in life.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be so fed that they become mere specimens,\r\nillustrative of how early fat accumulation may occur, and to what a\r\ndegree it may go. Just as soon as baby shows signs of an accumulation\r\nof fat above its normal weight for age and size, there should be just\r\nsuch a regulation of its diet as would be considered necessary if it\r\nwere an older person, and showed the same unfortunate tendency. This\r\nis particularly important if the parental relatives on either or both\r\nsides of the house show tendencies to fat accumulation. We are sure\r\nthat in diabetes the over-eating of starchy and sugary substances\r\nproduces what is, at the beginning, an alimentary or so-called\r\nphysiological glycosuria, though it is doubtful whether any glycosuria\r\nis ever absolutely physiological. This may lead to a pathological\r\nglycosuria and the production of a true diabetes. So, also, the\r\ntendency to accumulation of fat, as the result of what might be called\r\nalimentary obesity, may lead eventually to the production of an\r\nessential obesity in which even the proteid materials of the food may\r\nbe changed into fats, just as in the case of diabetes they are changed\r\nto sugar. This fat is then stored up in the tissues though there is no\r\nneed at all for such an accumulation, and the food stuff is wasted\r\nquite as much as in diabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Will in Treatment.--The important element in the treatment of\r\nobesity is the readiness of the patient to follow directions. Nine out\r\nof every {293} ten stout people are thoroughly able to control the\r\naccumulation of fat and even to bring themselves down to about normal\r\nweight, if only they _will_ to do so. This is no easy matter. It is\r\nnot an affair of a few weeks, or even a few months. Just as in the\r\ncase of over-indulgence in alcohol, it will probably be a life\r\nstruggle. It is well worth the while, however, for life is longer and\r\nis larger without the accumulation of fat, which is not only so\r\nuncosmetic, but is so preventive of real enjoyment of life.\r\nUnfortunately, the cosmetic side of it, that is, the absurdity of\r\ngoing round among one's friends with a very prominent abdomen, or with\r\nnoticeable protuberances, is the particular motive that appeals to\r\nmost people. While women may be quite ready to stand many discomforts\r\nfor cosmetic effect when dictated by fashion, they are not ordinarily\r\npersistent enough in their efforts to prevent fat accumulation to be\r\nsuccessful in this much more important purpose.\r\n\r\nSuch patients make the rounds from physician to physician, and from\r\nquack to quack, and go from patent medicine to patent medicine, to\r\nfind something that will enable them to lose weight without the\r\nnecessity for their taking any trouble. It is the old, old story that\r\nthe nerve specialist who is known occasionally to treat his patients\r\nby hypnotism has so often presented to him. Patients who are sufferers\r\nfrom alcoholism, or drug addiction, or some other vicious habit,\r\npresent themselves and ask if they cannot be hypnotized and then lose\r\ntheir tendency to fall back into the old habit. There is no\r\npossibility of this. If they are willing to cooperate, all of these\r\nhabits may be overcome, but a constant effort will be required and,\r\neven after the habit is broken, there always remains a distinct danger\r\nof relapse. Patients suffering from obesity want to transfer the\r\nburden of working it off to someone else's shoulders, or they want\r\nsome specific remedy that will bring about reduction in weight yet\r\npermit them to indulge in all the pleasures of their artificially\r\nexcited appetite. They follow directions for a few weeks, often\r\nhalf-heartedly, and then give up the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Temptations_.--With obesity, as with indulgence in alcohol, the\r\nmain difficulty is the occasion. Most of these fat people are placed\r\nin circumstances in which tempting food passes them three times a day,\r\nand it is hard to refuse it. If a hot punch or a fragrant cocktail\r\nwere several times every day passed under the nose of a man with a\r\ntendency to inebriety it would be beyond the bounds of reason to hope\r\nthat he should withstand his craving. Just as soon as those who want\r\nto reduce in weight are put in conditions in which only simple food,\r\nthough there may be a reasonably good variety of it, is presented to\r\nthem, the difficulty of limiting the amount they eat is comparatively\r\neasy. This necessitates, as a rule, refusing invitations to dinner at\r\nfriends' houses, especially at the beginning of a reduction cure,\r\navoiding hotel _menus_ and giving up various social functions. It may\r\neven involve changing home customs from those of luxury back to\r\nsimplicity. The question is whether this is worth while or not. When a\r\nhusband is likely to indulge over much in alcoholic liquors a wife is\r\napt to consider it easy to deny herself the privilege of such liquors\r\non her table and of avoiding places where he is likely to be tempted.\r\nThe rest of the family are usually quite satisfied to stand some\r\nself-denial so that unfortunate results may not follow.\r\n\r\nWhere father or mother are suffering from obesity this same thing may\r\nbe necessary with regard to rich and highly seasoned foods. This would\r\nbe a {294} hardship to inflict on the family were it not for the fact\r\nthat the health of all the members will be distinctly benefited and a\r\nreturn to simple food, nutritious and with a variety that makes it\r\neminently wholesome, will be good for them as a prophylactic measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Motives for Self-Control_.--The task of keeping the weight down is so\r\ndifficult that very few people with a tendency to over-weight are\r\nequal to it. They need the help of every motive possible for\r\nencouragement. It is well to make these persons realize that\r\nover-weight, according to the statistics carefully gathered and\r\ncollated by the large insurance companies in recent years, is a\r\nserious bar to great expectancy of life. In a large series of cases it\r\nwas found that not a single individual recorded as being more than\r\ntwenty per cent. over the normal weight that he should have for\r\nheight, died of old age. Furthermore no one of over-weight attained\r\nthe age of eighty years, though 44 under-weights passed this age, and\r\ntwo of them even reached the age of ninety. Death from nearly every\r\nknown cause is more frequent among the over-weights than in the normal\r\npopulation, except in the single instance of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nWhat was thus demonstrated from statistics, carefully gathered in\r\nmodern times, has been a commonplace in medicine since the earliest\r\ndays. Hippocrates summed up Greek experience in the aphorism \"persons\r\nwho are naturally very fat are apt to die earlier than those who are\r\nslender.\" Practically all the commentators since his time have agreed\r\nwith him. In early years thinness may be quite as dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other reason but the greater frequency of _diabetes_\r\namong the obese, this of itself would be sufficient to act as a strong\r\ndeterrent motive. It may well be used as such, especially in families\r\nwhere a tendency to diabetes has been manifest. Diabetes figures as a\r\ncause of death in life insurance statistics five times more frequently\r\namong those who are over-weight than in the general population. Those\r\nwho are under-weight suffer from the disease in fatal form less than\r\none-half as frequently as the average. Hence, obesity and diabetes are\r\nevidently closely related. As we have suggested, the disturbance of\r\nmetabolism due to the failure to use sugar properly in the system and\r\nto its consequent elimination, corresponds in some, as yet not well\r\nunderstood, way to the other metabolic disturbance by which\r\nunnecessary fat is accumulated in the system. It is probable that the\r\nover-eating of starchy foods and fats which leads to obesity, causes\r\nin some people a breakdown of metabolism in the matter of the proper\r\ndisposal of sugar, and this initiates diabetes which becomes a\r\npathological condition, after a time quite beyond control.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep and Exercise.--After the reduction of diet, the most important\r\nfeature of any successful treatment of obesity must consist of an\r\nincrease in the amount of exercise. Both of these can be accomplished\r\nonly through the patient's will, and by frequently repeated\r\nsuggestion, and auto-suggestion, of the necessity for constant\r\nsurveillance in both these matters. Any form of exercise that is\r\npursued faithfully is beneficial. Exercise in the open air, because it\r\nencourages oxidation, is preferable to gymnastic exercises, but the\r\ncare of a trained instructor, the influence of example, the habit of\r\ntaking it at regular hours, make gymnastic exercise of value in this\r\ncondition. A regular walk every day is invaluable if it can be\r\nsecured. Women can be tempted {295} to walk even three or four miles,\r\nif the habit is gradually formed, and if they realize the necessity\r\nfor it. It is important that too much sleep should not be indulged in.\r\nOne of the difficulties with pet animals is that they sleep so much\r\nmore in domesticity than in the state of nature. Sleep must be\r\nabsolutely regulated for the obese. The old monastic rule \"seven hours\r\nfor a man, eight hours for a woman and nine hours for a hog\" must be\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity.--There always remains in these cases the influence of\r\nheredity. Many people are sure that because they come from families\r\nwith the tendency to obesity, it is impossible for them to overcome\r\nthis assumed heredity, and that the only thing for them is to bear the\r\naffliction with equanimity. They usually do this while indulging their\r\ntaste for the luxuries of the table rather freely. This question of\r\nheredity, however, has come in recent years to occupy a very different\r\nposition in the minds of biologists from that which it held a\r\ngeneration ago. We know now that the evidence for acquired characters\r\nbeing transmitted is so trivial as to be quite negligible.\r\n\r\nThe children of stout parents are likely to acquire their parents'\r\nhabits as to the consumption of food, in such quantity and quality as\r\nwill almost inevitably put fat on them. It is this habit much more\r\nthan any hereditary element, which is the underlying cause of the\r\nobesity. There may be some influence of heredity, but it is much less\r\nthan has been thought, and even where it exists, it is not so\r\ninevitable as has been considered. There are cases in every\r\nphysician's experience where the children of stout parents who, for\r\nsome reason, have been brought to habits of spare eating, have been\r\nthin all their lives. On the other hand, anyone who has seen the\r\nchange that has come over the sons of spare, lanky farmers, in whom\r\nboth father and mother were of the thin type, yet who in the midst of\r\nthe luxury of city life have taken on weight, will be convinced that\r\npersonal habits mean much more than any influence of heredity in the\r\nproduction of obesity.\r\n\r\nWhere there is normal occupation of mind and body with strict\r\nregulation of the hours of sleep, and simple though abundant food,\r\nthere is little tendency for people to become obese, even though there\r\nmay seem to be hereditary tendencies. In a considerable experience\r\nwith religious communities I have often noted that the member of a\r\nfamily who enters a religious order often goes but slightly above\r\nnormal weight, even though other members of the family may become\r\ndistinctly fat. This is not because of rigid self-denial in the matter\r\nof food, that is to such an extent as to take less food than is\r\nnecessary, for most members of the religious communities work too hard\r\nfor this to be possible, but because they live the regular active life\r\nand have the simple food of the community. This is true in spite of\r\nthe fact that their indoor life would seem to predispose them to the\r\naccumulation of fat. After fifty most of them put on weight because\r\nthis is the physiological accompaniment of that period of life, but it\r\nis not this form of fat accumulation that the physician is called upon\r\nto treat as a rule, but that in people between the ages of twenty and\r\nforty.\r\n\r\nIf the prevention of over-weight is taken up in time, if habits are\r\nbroken before they become tyrannous, if proper self-control is\r\ncultivated early in life, there are very few people that need fear the\r\noncoming of obesity. There are some pathologically obese families in\r\nwhich this will not be true, but they are as rare as diabetic\r\nfamilies. The most important element in any {296} treatment is the\r\nrousing of the patient's mind and his will to take up seriously the\r\ntask of unlearning habits of overeating and not allowing sluggishness\r\nof life to gain control. This can be done best, not by removing all\r\nsorts of articles for which there is special taste from the diet, but\r\nby a general reduction in the quantity of food eaten, by the\r\nintroduction of food material that does not put on weight yet\r\nsatisfies the craving, by the replacing of many of the starchy\r\nvegetables by greens of various kinds, by replacing many of the\r\ndesserts by gelatine products and cheese, and by additions to the\r\nexercise. But there must be no extremes in the reduction of food or\r\nthe taking up of exercise. Patients should not be permitted to lose\r\nfive pounds a week--at most two or three pounds--and they should be\r\nmade to understand that it is a life work and the formation of lasting\r\nhabits that they have before them. They should be made to understand,\r\nalso, after a time the satisfaction that comes from a more active life\r\nwill give them even more pleasure than the satisfaction of their\r\nappetite did before.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Treatment.--Many systems of treatment of obesity have\r\nbeen invented. All of them are supported by cured cases. Some of them\r\nare founded on a reduction in the amount of fluids, some on a\r\nreduction of the amount of vegetables eaten, in some cases going to\r\nthe extreme of an almost exclusively meat diet. Most of them modify\r\nthe diet very extensively. It is doubtful, however, whether any of\r\nthese systems, when successful, have owed their success so much to the\r\nphysical effect as to the suggestive influence exercised on the\r\npatient's mind, that he must at the same time limit his eating and\r\nincrease his exercise. In the matter of fluids particularly, some of\r\nthe systems are absolutely contradictory of one another, yet success\r\nfollows their application. There is one serious difficulty in the\r\napplication of these systems. After a time the patient becomes very\r\ntired of the monotony of diet suggested, and growing discouraged,\r\nrelapse into old habits. If suggestion can be used with as much force\r\nwithout such extreme modifications of diet, the results are as good,\r\nand are always more lasting. The important factor is a reduction in\r\nthe amount eaten, without necessarily denying any but the very rich\r\nfoods. In this way patients can very soon be induced to take half\r\nportions of what they have been previously eating and thus secure a\r\nprompt reduction in weight.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the bowels of obese patients be kept freely open.\r\nTendencies to constipation seem to disturb metabolism in the direction\r\nof fat deposition, and even fatty degeneration. Many of the cures at\r\nwatering places include the taking of laxative salts, or waters of\r\nvarious kinds, and undoubtedly this is helpful at the beginning. But\r\nthe continuance of such treatment may seriously disturb peristalsis so\r\nthat it is important to have intervals of rest for the bowels, during\r\nwhich, while there is a regular daily evacuation, there are no\r\ntendencies to diarrhea. The suggestive influence of the taking of\r\nsalts has meant much for a great many so-called obesity cures. They\r\nshould be employed carefully, but must not be abused.\r\n\r\nFor fat already accumulated, only exercise will serve as a sure\r\nremedy. For fat within the abdomen, the various leg exercises which\r\nmay be gone through in bed, and the trunk movements, especially those\r\nof sitting up from a lying position, when frequently repeated, will\r\nsoon serve to dissipate accumulated fat. They will also encourage the\r\ntaking of outdoor exercises, as {297} well as relieve the patient from\r\nmany muscular discomforts, difficulties of breathing and heart\r\npalpitation, which were not only annoying before, but discouraged the\r\ntaking of exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWEIGHT AND GOOD FEELING\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the most important single condition for the maintenance of\r\ngood health and _good feeling_ is the carrying of weight normal for\r\nthe height and age of the individual, or slightly in excess of normal.\r\nPopular expressions contain many proofs of this. The proverb \"laugh\r\nand grow fat\" is undoubtedly due to the recognition by all the world\r\nthat stout people are nearly always laughers, and as a consequence,\r\nperhaps placing the effect for the cause, laughing has been regarded\r\nas a factor in putting on flesh. [Footnote 27]  There is no doubt that\r\nthe exercise for the diaphragm afforded by hearty laughing, with the\r\nstimulation of the intra-abdominal circulation consequent upon\r\nvigorous diaphragmatic movements, is an important element in producing\r\na healthy state of the important organs of the human economy contained\r\nwithin the abdominal cavity. Dr. Abrams in his book, \"The Blues,\r\nCauses and Cure,\" attributes this disturbing condition of depression\r\nso familiar to those who have much to do with nervous patients, to a\r\ndisordered blood and nerve circulation in the splanchnic area, and\r\ncalls it scientifically, splanchnic neurasthenia. This undoubtedly\r\nsums up one important element in the causation of a great many\r\ndepressive conditions. Most of them are banished by frequent hearty\r\nlaughter which, with its exercise of the diaphragm, tends to stimulate\r\nsplanchnic blood vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 27: Those who are interested in fossil words will find many\r\n  curious confirmations of the connection between weight and good\r\n  health and good humor. A typical illustration is the word _buxom_,\r\n  derived from the German _biegsam_, which means \"ready to obey,\" from\r\n  the original significance of being ready to bend, that is bendsome.\r\n  In our day it has come to have quite a material rather than an\r\n  ethical significance. A buxom woman is one who is round and full of\r\n  form and while she usually also is cheerful and tractable, the two\r\n  ideas are not necessarily connected. It is curious that what was\r\n  originally the obedient wife should now have become the stout and\r\n  healthy wife, as if stoutness and healthiness were somehow\r\n  inseparably connected with the preceding idea so that gradually one\r\n  portion of the meaning was lost sight of and now only the physical\r\n  significance remains.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThinness and Discontent.--In general, it is well understood that thin\r\npeople are likely to be more gloomy and discontented than those of\r\nstouter build. The pessimists of the world have usually been lank and\r\nlean. Shakespeare, in \"Julius Caesar,\" has the great Roman declare\r\nthat he likes not \"the lean and hungry Cassius,\" and that \"discontent\r\nis bred in such bodies.\" The issue shows his prophetic power.\r\nDiscontent with life is much more likely in thin people than in stout.\r\nMost suicides are under-weight. Where nutrition is under the normal,\r\ndigestion is sure to be poor because the digestive organs themselves\r\nsuffer even more than others from lack of food, apparently giving up\r\nsome of their own substance at the call of other tissues; sleep is\r\nnearly always disturbed, constipation is almost the rule, and muscular\r\naction becomes distasteful. While in our day we hear much of people\r\novereating, the nervous specialist finds that many of his patients are\r\nundereating. {298} These patients grow out of many discomforts,\r\ndreads, and symptoms that often seem, even to the physician, to be due\r\nto organic change, when they take on enough weight to relieve them\r\nfrom the incessant calls for more nutrition to which insufficient food\r\nhas made them subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Disadvantages of Thinness.--There are many dangers that go\r\nwith thinness besides the tendency to that irritability of the nervous\r\nsystem which we have come to associate with neurotic symptoms. It has\r\nlong been known that a person who is under weight is much more likely\r\nto contract tuberculosis than a normal individual. From carefully\r\nselected statistics, the large insurance companies have determined,\r\nthat it is far more dangerous to insure a man who is twenty pounds\r\nunder weight and who has no family heredity of tuberculosis than to\r\ninsure a man with a family history of tuberculosis on both sides of\r\nthe house, provided he is well up to or above the normal weight, and\r\nis not living in special conditions of danger from contagion. It is\r\ncontagion and not heredity that plays the most important role in\r\ntuberculosis, and the element that is still more important is that of\r\nvital resistance. Every adult of thirty years or over has probably at\r\nsome time had tuberculosis, for traces of its presence are found in\r\nthe bodies of all adults who come to autopsy. Seven-eighths of the\r\nhuman race are, however, able to resist, and among these seven-eighths\r\nby far the greater proportion are those who are above normal weight.\r\n\r\nOf course, this matter of the relation of normal weight to good health\r\ndid not escape the acute observation of the old physicians.\r\nHippocrates, to take the first and greatest of them, realized that\r\nwhile excessive eating and drinking was serious, there were many\r\npeople who suffered from not eating enough. One of his aphorisms runs,\r\n\"A slender and restricted diet is generally more dangerous [manifestly\r\nhe means to both the well and the ill] than one a little more\r\nliberal.\" He appreciated, too, the fact that while the old may\r\nrestrict their diet with more or less impunity, this practice may be,\r\nand indeed is likely to be, more serious in young people. He has\r\nmarshaled the ages and stated the effects of a low diet on them very\r\ndefinitely:\r\n\r\n  Old persons endure fasting most easily, next adults; young persons\r\n  not nearly so well, and infants least of all, especially those who\r\n  are of a particularly lively disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discomfort Due to Lack of Fat_.--Many of the vague discomforts of the\r\ninternal organs seem to be due to a lack of fat cushions round them,\r\nand fat blankets to keep them from being too much subjected to the\r\nvicissitudes of external temperature. Anyone who has noted in a series\r\nof cases the difference between the condition of patients suffering\r\nfrom a slightly movable kidney when they are well up to weight, and\r\nwhen, on the other hand, they are considerably reduced in weight, will\r\nhave the significance of the first of these conditions brought home\r\nvery clearly. Most of the people who suffer much from cold in winter\r\nare greatly benefited, as might be expected, by a blanket of fat. It\r\nis rather easy to grow accustomed to carrying ten additional pounds of\r\nfat when ten additional pounds of clothes would be an insupportable\r\nburden. Some fat people are prone to complain of the cold. These are\r\nnot the plethoric but the anemic. This latter class often have a\r\nsluggish circulation, besides a lack of hemoglobin. As a consequence\r\nof this their {299} oxidation processes are slow and imperfect, and\r\nthis is one of the reasons for the over-accumulation of fat. The\r\nhealthy individual with normal heart and normal blood-making apparatus\r\nwill always be ever so much more comfortable with a reasonable\r\npanniculus adiposus and fat cushions and coverings for the internal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muscular Weakness and Discomfort_.--There are a number of pains and\r\naches occurring in lean persons that are due to nothing else than the\r\nweakness of muscle consequent upon the poor nutrition of their\r\nmuscular tissues. Muscles which do not receive as much nourishment as\r\nthey should, must necessarily be weak, and if asked to do much work\r\nthey will resent it. Ordinarily it is not realized how much work is\r\nrequired even for such common muscular efforts as those that are\r\nneeded to hold the body erect, or to keep it in a stooping position at\r\na definite angle, or to move around on the feet.\r\n\r\nI have seen patients lose their aches and pains, and become quite\r\ncapable of standing weather changes and ordinary hard muscular labor\r\nwithout discomfort, simply as the result of a decided gain in weight.\r\nAll that was needed was the persuasion to eat more, and especially to\r\neat a full breakfast, the meal likely to be neglected. In some\r\npersons, appetite will only return after the correction of\r\nconstipation and insistence on a certain amount of outdoor air every\r\nday, not necessarily exercise--for bus riding or the open cars are\r\nexcellent appetizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEating Enough.--It is very difficult to persuade some people to eat\r\nenough! They have all sorts of excuses. They rather pride themselves\r\non the fact that they do not eat much. Persons who are twenty pounds\r\nunder weight will calmly tell you that they do not need more than they\r\neat. They are actually in debt to that extent to their tissues, yet\r\nthey are persuaded that they are paying nature's claims in full.\r\nSometimes the excuse is that they have heard, or read, of how much\r\nharm is done by overeating; they have taken to heart the phrase that\r\npeople are digging their graves with their teeth, and so they are\r\nactually cultivating the habit of undereating instead of allowing\r\ntheir instinct for food to manifest itself. Many are found to be\r\nfollowing the good old saw of getting up from the table hungry. The\r\ninventor of it is not known, but quite unlike the inventor of sleep,\r\nit would have been a great blessing if he had kept it to himself by\r\npatent right.\r\n\r\nAfter a time habit for these people becomes second nature, and it is\r\nhard to get them to eat enough. When people undereat it is the\r\ndigestive organs that, in my experience, always suffer the most. As a\r\nconsequence, the appetite decreases because of gradually acquired lack\r\nof vitality in the digestive system, its nutrition having been lowered\r\nby drafts upon it from other portions of the body. Quite contrary to\r\nwhat is told in the old fable, the stomach apparently is not selfish\r\nand does not keep the lion's share for itself. The decrease in the\r\namount of food brings on a decrease in digestive power.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight for Height.--The physician who wants to help patients by\r\nsuggestion must keep before him weight tables for height, as they have\r\nbeen determined by statistics. When people are under weight, it\r\nmatters not what they may be suffering from, improvement will come if\r\nthey are made to gain in weight. To be able to show them that they are\r\nconsiderably below the normal and to point out what this probably\r\nmeans in lack of surplus energy, suffices of itself to make many\r\npeople understand the necessity for {300} effort in the matter and to\r\ngive them a strong suggestion as to probable relief of their symptoms.\r\nThe following tables are the best-known averages for men and women:\r\n\r\nADJUSTED TABLE OF WEIGHTS FOR INSURED WOMEN, BASED ON 58,855 ACCEPTED LIVES\r\n\r\n         15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 Combined\r\n                                                                     Ages\r\n4' 11\"   111   113   115   117   119   119   122   125   128   126   118\r\n5'  0\"   113   114   117   119   122   122   125   128   130   129   120\r\n5'  1\"   115   116   118   121   124   124   128   131   133   132   122\r\n5'  2\"   117   118   120   123   127   127   132   134   137   136   125\r\n5'  3\"   120   122   124   127   131   131   135   138   141   140   128\r\n5'  4\"   123   125   127   130   134   134   138   142   145   144   131\r\n5'  5\"   125   128   131   135   139   139   143   147   149   148   135\r\n5'  6\"   128   132   135   139   143   143   146   151   153   152   139\r\n5'  7\"   132   135   139   143   147   147   150   154   157   155   143\r\n5'  8\"   136   140   143   147   151   151   155   158   161   160   147\r\n5'  9\"   140   144   147   151   155   155   159   163   166   165   151\r\n5' 10\"   144   147   151   155   159   159   163   167   170   169   155\r\nCombined 123   126   129   132   136   136   139   142   145   142   133\r\nHeights\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average shoes of the average woman will raise her about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR.

It is well to bear in mind that most patients who are\r\nunder weight can be made to gain in weight by an appeal to their\r\nreason and by proper directions and care in seeing that those\r\ndirections are carried out. Patients have told me that they could not\r\neat more and yet I have been able to persuade them that they must eat\r\nmore, and they have done so. Anyone who has much to do with\r\ntuberculous patients knows that utter repugnance for food can be\r\novercome by will-power, when it is once made clear to the patient that\r\nthey {301} must eat if they want to live. The most interesting event\r\nin the process is that with the increase in the amount of food taken,\r\ninstead of the appetite becoming more and more satiated, as patients\r\nare likely to anticipate, and instead of the repugnance for food\r\ngrowing, the appetite grows stronger, and the repugnance gradually\r\ndisappears. There is only one way to gain in weight; that is by eating\r\nmore than one has been accustomed to eat. Persons who are twenty\r\npounds under weight ought easily to gain three pounds a week, half a\r\npound a day, if seriously intent on doing so, but in order to do this\r\nthey will probably have to increase the amount they eat by double this\r\nquantity. That means that a solid additional pound of food, quite\r\napart from the watery elements of the food, must be taken every day.\r\n\r\nIn the correction of under-weight details are all-important. Patients\r\nmust be given specific directions as to what and how much of the\r\nvarious foods they should take. With regard to supposed idiosyncrasies\r\nagainst such nutritious substances as eggs, milk and butter, enough is\r\nsaid elsewhere to make it clear that, as a rule, these are merely pet\r\nnotions, beginning in some unfortunate incident and cherished until\r\nthey have become a mental persuasion strong enough to disturb the\r\ndigestion of these substances. What is true for quality of food is\r\ntrue also for quantity. People must be made to understand that the\r\namount of food is to be increased. The results attained by this method\r\nare well worth the efforts required for it. Of course, the bitter\r\ntonics, especially strychnin and cinchona, will do much to help. Just\r\nas soon as patients begin to gain in weight many of their neurotic\r\nsymptoms leave them. Their tired feelings are no longer complained of\r\nand when they are up to normal weight they are quite other\r\nindividuals, both in good humor and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIf for years patients have been eating less than they should, then\r\nthey will have discomfort when they begin to eat more. They will have\r\nno more discomfort, however, than would be occasioned if they took\r\nmore exercise than they had been accustomed to. The stomach and\r\nintestines must be gradually accustomed to the new task of disposing\r\nof more food. Unfortunately, the usual impression among these patients\r\nis that discomfort in the abdominal region, by which they mean any\r\nsense of fullness, proceeds from indigestion, and indigestion\r\nsignifies developing dyspepsia with all the horrors that are supposed\r\nto go with it. In reality the slight discomfort which comes from\r\nincreased eating is usually not manifest whenever the patients are\r\noccupied with something reasonably interesting. After a time the\r\norgans will become accustomed to it, and then the discomfort will\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nervous Patients_.--One of the strongest suggestions that we have in\r\nour power for thin nervous patients, suffering from many and various\r\nills, is to have them gain in weight. Many of them will be found to be\r\ndistinctly under weight for their height. They insist that they cannot\r\neat more, that they are eating as much as they care to, and that they\r\nhave no appetite, that when they eat more they have discomfort, etc.\r\nIt must be made clear to them that their one easy road to health is to\r\ngain in weight. If they are under weight this makes a very definite\r\npurpose to put before their minds. The objection so often urged, that\r\nthey come from a thin family, must not be listened to. The unalterable\r\npurpose to make them gain in weight must be insisted upon. If they can\r\nbe made to eat more than they have been {302} eating before, they will\r\nsurely gain in weight. To see themselves gaining in weight is a daily\r\nrenewal of the suggestion that they will be better when they get up to\r\ntheir normal weight. It is much better than electricity or the rest\r\ncure, or anything else that I know; it is perfectly natural and, above\r\nall, because it may be made an auto-suggestion, it does not leave the\r\npatient after a time dependent on anyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nVAGUE ABDOMINAL DISCOMFORTS--LOOSE KIDNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the vague pains around joints so commonly called rheumatic, and\r\nwhich occur so frequently that probably there is no one over forty who\r\nis quite ready to confess that he has not had rheumatism, the most\r\nimportant source of vague discomfort is the abdominal region. This\r\noccurs particularly in people who are engaged in a sedentary\r\noccupation which prevents much exercise, keeps them indoors, and gives\r\nthem abundant opportunity as a rule for introspection and dwelling\r\nupon their sensations. There are few people who live the intellectual\r\nlife who have not suffered from some of this abdominal discomfort,\r\nwhich they presumed must mean some definite lesion, or portend some\r\nserious development, and yet, as a rule, they have lived for years\r\nafterward without any of their fears proving true.\r\n\r\nPhysicians are not spared from this source of worry and discomfort.\r\nThey suffer from it even a little more than others. Their knowledge of\r\nthe possibilities of serious pathological developments within the\r\nabdomen, especially after the age of forty, makes them a little more\r\nconcerned as to the significance of these vague discomforts.\r\n\r\nAt least half a dozen times a year, for the last ten years, I have\r\nheard physicians say that they were sure that some organ or other\r\nwithin was not performing its function properly, and that there was\r\nprobably some organic lesion. The thought has usually been in their\r\nminds for months, sometimes for years, and they have come to be\r\nthoroughly examined. Sometimes they rather expect to be told that they\r\nshould go to a surgeon. They are usually half concealing a question as\r\nto how soon they should set about putting their affairs to rights and\r\nhow serious the outlook is. As a rule, I am able to dismiss them\r\nwithout any further treatment than the injunction not to think so\r\npersistently about certain obscure feelings which they are allowing to\r\noccupy their consciousness. Sometimes I know they take the\r\nadvice--even oftener, perhaps, I know they do not. Once it has got\r\nhold of us, it is hard to get away from morbid introspection, and I\r\nsometimes hear of them consulting others. All of these patients are\r\nimproved for a time after their consultation by the reassurance that\r\nso long as they have a good appetite--which is the case with all of\r\nthem--and their bowels are regular--which unfortunately is not the\r\ncase with most of them--and so long as they sleep well and have no\r\nacute pain, there is little likelihood of any serious latent abdominal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nSuch reassurance cannot be given until the abdominal region is\r\ncarefully palpated, and especially the right side explored as\r\nthoroughly as possible. {303} Here lies the appendix, the head of the\r\ncolon, which is sometimes the seat of trouble not necessarily\r\noriginating in the appendix. Just above them one may find a loose\r\nkidney, for the right kidney is more likely to be movable than the\r\nleft, because of the overhanging liver, and finally the gall-bladder,\r\nand the bile passages, so likely to be the seat of serious trouble. If\r\nnone of these organs are tender on deep palpation, if the kidney does\r\nnot come down when the patient is examined in the standing position,\r\nif there are no serious derangements of digestion, except such as can\r\nbe attributed to nervous indigestion, and if there is no dilatation of\r\nthe stomach, and no enlargement of the spleen, there is no reason why\r\none should do anything but try to get the patient's mind off himself.\r\n\r\nThere is always the danger of overlooking an abdominal cancer, in\r\nthese eases, though with the care in diagnosis I have suggested this\r\nis minimal. The best therapeutic test that I know to determine this,\r\nif there should be any doubt, is to put the patient on an increased\r\ndiet and watch the scales. If he is able to digest the added food\r\nwell, and without trouble, and if he proceeds promptly to gain in\r\nweight, there is much less than one chance in a hundred that he is the\r\nsubject of latent cancer in the abdominal region. The old farmer's\r\nmaxim is: \"A sick hog don't get fat.\" When human beings properly\r\nrespond to increased feeding, it is probable, not only that there is\r\nnothing serious the matter with them, but that the symptoms of which\r\nthey complained before may very likely have been due to lack of\r\nnutrition. The digestive organs not having enough to occupy them, were\r\ntempted to digest themselves, or at least to have their function\r\ndisturbed by the short circuiting of nervous energy looking for\r\nsomething to do.\r\n\r\nI have seen a number of these cases that had been operated on for\r\nvague discomfort--some whose appendices had been removed, some whose\r\nkidneys had been fastened up because they were slightly movable, some\r\nwhose gall passages had been examined for adhesions that were supposed\r\nto exist, or perhaps for a stone that it was thought might be found\r\nthere, and except where some actual organic lesion was found and\r\nrelieved, none of them was materially improved when seen several years\r\nafter operation. I have heard reports of cures of these cases by\r\nsurgeons who felt that the removal of an appendix presumed to show a\r\ncatarrhal process, or a hyperemia, or an adhesion at its tip, had\r\nmeant the cure of vague abdominal discomfort which had continued for\r\nmany years and made the patient profoundly miserable. But these\r\nreports were founded on the patient's condition at the end of\r\nconvalescence after the operation, and not on the condition that\r\nestablished itself some months, or perhaps a year, later. Operations\r\non the abdomen, except for very definite indications, have, in my\r\nexperience, always done more harm than good, and I have seen serious\r\nconditions--hernia, displacement of organs and disturbance of the\r\nperistalsis of the intestines--develop subsequent to them.\r\n\r\nI have in mind two typical cases. One was a physician whom I had seen\r\non a number of occasions, and who complained of vague discomfort,\r\nmainly in the right side of the abdomen, though never acute, never\r\naccompanied by fever, nor even by any disturbance of pulse when he was\r\nnot in an excitable mood. His bowels were not always regular, and he\r\nhad had some disturbance of circulation as the result of thrombosis of\r\nveins on that side after an {304} attack of typhoid fever. My opinion\r\nwas that his discomfort was entirely due to the disturbance of\r\ncirculation. There was probably some interference with the normal full\r\ncirculation to the large intestine, in its ascending portion, that\r\ngave him a feeling of uneasiness, or of consciousness of its function.\r\nEventually he became convinced that he was suffering from a chronic\r\nform of appendicitis. After considerable persuasion he convinced a\r\nsurgeon friend that his appendix should be removed, and the operation\r\nwas done. I saw his appendix afterwards. It was supposed to be\r\nthickened, but considering the normal limits of size of the appendix,\r\nI could not think that it was beyond them in any marked way. At most\r\nthere was but a slight catarrhal inflammation.\r\n\r\nFor a time after operation he was much improved. He felt confident\r\nthat all his trouble has disappeared, and he took some pains to\r\nimpress me with the supposed fact that in these vague cases of\r\ndiscomfort there was always some underlying organic lesion that needed\r\nsurgical treatment. During convalescence he had gained in weight, and\r\nwas looking very well. When I met him a year and a half later he said\r\nthat some of his discomfort had returned. He had grown thinner and was\r\nfeeling discouraged. Six months later he was about to submit to\r\nanother operation, this time for the breaking up of adhesions in the\r\nneighborhood of his gall-bladder. He had become convinced that this\r\nmust be the seat of the difficulty. After this operation he was sure,\r\nbeyond peradventure, that his trouble was gone never to return. Two\r\nyears later I found him preparing to have his right kidney sewed up. I\r\nhad known that his right kidney was slightly movable, but it did not\r\nmove sufficiently to cause any disturbance of kidney function, and\r\ncertainly not enough to justify serious surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nAfter this operation I met him once casually and he assured me that\r\nnow everything was surely all right. I have since heard that he\r\nsubmitted to an operation either for the breaking up of some adhesions\r\naround his stomach or in order to tuck up that organ for ptosis. It\r\nhad not been quite decided whether an adhesion caused a slight\r\nhour-glass constriction of the stomach, with some dilatation of the\r\nsplenic end of the fundus, or whether there had been some actual\r\nsagging. I am sure that after this operation, as after preceding ones,\r\nwith the strong suggestion that he ought to be better and an increase\r\nof weight during convalescence, he lost his vague abdominal discomfort\r\nfor a time, though I have no doubt that it either has or will return.\r\nWhen he gets something to so occupy his mind that he does not dwell\r\ntoo much on his discomfort, he will not increase it to the extent that\r\nmakes it intolerable. Then he will remember that most people have some\r\ndiscomfort, and he will learn to distract his mind, rather than allow\r\nit to dwell on the thought of his particular ailment until it becomes\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nIt has taken twelve years or more to develop this case to the point\r\nwhere it is as instructive as it now is, and it is a typical example\r\nof what may happen even to a physician. There are other cases in my\r\nnotes that are quite as instructive, two of them occurring in\r\nthoroughly educated men, clergymen who were of good intellectual\r\ncapacity, but who became too much occupied with themselves. One of\r\nthese had more operations done on him than my friend the physician. He\r\nfirst had his appendix removed, and was better for a time. Then his\r\nkidney was fastened up, and improvement once more took place. After\r\nthis he lost in weight considerably and suffered so much {305} from\r\nheadaches that a friendly surgeon suggested that there must be\r\nadhesions between his dura and his brain. Accordingly a trephining was\r\ndone, and these adhesions, real or supposed, were broken up. For a\r\ntime he seemed to be better. Then he had some urinary trouble. A long\r\nprepuce, though one that was never tight or adherent, and only\r\nrequired a little attention to cleanliness to keep it from giving\r\nbother, was removed. Some disturbance of his appetite led him to limit\r\nhis eating for a time, and then he suffered from constipation. This\r\nwas diagnosed by a specialist in rectal troubles as due to abnormally\r\ndeveloped valves in his rectum, and these were cut. He still\r\ncomplained very much of abdominal discomfort at times. This was\r\ndiagnosed as ptosis of his organs, and an operation was done to tuck\r\nthese up. After this he developed a large ventral hernia, which had to\r\nbe relieved by a subsequent operation.\r\n\r\nI had followed the case carefully during many years, seeing him at\r\ntimes, and I was always opposed to the idea of operation and fully\r\nconfident that none of the operations were really needed. He could not\r\nbe persuaded that what his case needed most was occupation of mind\r\nwith something besides his condition. Whenever I could persuade him of\r\nthis I had seen him gain in weight, get into much better spirits and\r\nbe almost able to take up his work again. Then he would become\r\ndiscouraged, and before long I would hear of another operation that\r\nwas planned, or was about to be performed. During the course of one of\r\nhis many progressive losses in weight as a consequence of depression\r\nof mind, he developed tuberculosis. He resisted this very well, but\r\neventually died rather suddenly of an empyema. A careful autopsy\r\nshowed nothing but the traces of former operations, and no reason why\r\nthey should have been done.\r\n\r\nAnother case: A friend, also a clergyman, had three operations done,\r\none of them circumcision, the second an appendectomy and the third on\r\na supposed floating kidney. None were indicated, so far as I could\r\nsee, by any definite symptoms, or justified by his condition. He had\r\nvague abdominal discomfort, and this continued to bother him in spite\r\nof treatment by various specialists, and his mind became so much\r\noccupied with it that he was ready to submit to anything in order to\r\nbe rid of his burden of discomfort. At no time was it an ache, nor did\r\nhe ever speak of it as a pain. He had some tendency to dilatation of\r\nthe stomach and at times, when much occupied with indoor work and\r\nneglecting muscular exercise, there was probably some delay of\r\ndigestion. His appetite was good whenever he would let it be; his\r\nbowels were regular whenever he was eating sufficient to stimulate\r\nthem to normal function; he slept well, except when unnerved by\r\nsomething, but the presence of this abdominal discomfort disturbed\r\nmost of his waking hours. He could stand it so far as it had gone, but\r\nhe was sure that it would become so much worse in the future that it\r\nwould be unbearable. He dreaded that cancer or some other awful\r\ndevelopment would come after a time.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the main portion of the discomfort in these cases\r\nis the dread of what may happen. It is a dread, just as misophobia or\r\nclaustrophobia or acrophobia or any of the other dreads that we\r\ndiscuss in the chapter on that subject. The constant occupation with\r\nthis dread apparently inhibits to some degree the flow of nerve\r\nimpulses to the abdominal organs, and digestion, already disturbed, is\r\nstill more impaired. Indeed, the whole {306} of the discomfort seems\r\nto be a consciousness of stomach and intestinal function rather than\r\nanything more serious. The stomach will take two or three pounds or\r\neven more of mingled liquids and solids at a meal and pass them on to\r\nthe intestines without forcing itself into the field of our\r\nconsciousness. Anyone who is aware what a thin-walled membranous bag\r\nthe human stomach is--what it most nearly resembles is perhaps the\r\nfamiliar bladder of the cow--may well be surprised that, though it is\r\nsupplied with many sensitive nerves, it gives so little sign of the\r\nload that is often placed in it. It may, however, be brought rather\r\npoignantly into the sphere of consciousness by concentration of\r\nattention on it.\r\n\r\nThe intestines function usually with the same lack of reflex. They\r\nproceed to pass on this quantity of food, store up two or three days'\r\nrations, digest what is nutritious and eliminate what must be\r\nrejected, without rising into consciousness. If either stomach or\r\nintestines once begin to attract attention, then it will be difficult,\r\nunless care is exercised to distract the mind from them, to replace\r\nand keep them back in the sphere of the unconscious once more.\r\nPeristaltic movements are constantly taking place in the digestive\r\ntract. Various things may interfere with peristalsis, and the\r\ndisturbance of it will almost surely cause some sensation. It may not\r\nbe serious, and digestive processes may continue, yet there may be\r\ndiscomfort. If there is delay in the passage of food, gas accumulates\r\nin the stomach, presses up against the diaphragm and interferes with\r\nthe heart action. This will give rise to many bothersome sensations,\r\nsome of which are felt in the heart region itself; others much lower\r\ndown on the left side, where it is rather hard to recognize just what\r\nthe real seat of them may be. A good deal of the abdominal discomfort\r\nof which people complain, is due to such functional disturbances,\r\nemphasized by the fact that digestive action has come into the sphere\r\nof consciousness and now attention is being concentrated on it, to the\r\ndetriment of digestion itself, as well as to the increase of the\r\nannoyance which the discomfort may occasion.\r\n\r\nOperations for abdominal discomfort are quite contra-indicated, unless\r\nthere are very definite localizing symptoms of some pathological\r\nlesion that can surely be relieved by operative intervention. To\r\noperate on general principles is sure to emphasize the patient's\r\nconcentration of attention on his abdominal discomfort, if it does not\r\nrelieve it, and in most of these cases it utterly fails. The strong\r\nsuggestion of an operation will relieve for the time being, just as\r\noperations for epilepsy seemed to relieve when that procedure was\r\nfirst introduced, though now, unless there are definite localizing\r\nsigns, there is no question of such an operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nToxic Factors.--_Tea_.--A very interesting phase of abdominal\r\ndiscomfort seems to be associated with the taking of nerve stimulants.\r\nI have frequently found that patients who complained of vague\r\nabdominal uneasiness, sometimes rising particularly at night to the\r\nheight of colicky feelings but always on the left side, were indulging\r\nto excess in tea or coffee. In one case, a woman was taking, she\r\nthought, about a dozen cups of tea a day. Just how much more than this\r\nshe actually was taking I do not know, for it is almost incredible the\r\namount of tea that middle-aged women who are alone may take. I once\r\nfound by actual count made for me, that a woman was taking almost a\r\nscore of cups of tea in each twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n{307}\r\n\r\nJust as soon as there is a reduction in the amount of tea taken in\r\nthese cases, relief is afforded the patient. This relief will not,\r\nhowever, be absolutely satisfactory because the craving for the tea\r\nstimulation makes the patients irritable, and it takes but very little\r\nto cause them to complain that they still have their old discomfort.\r\nIn the course of three or four days they realize that the root of the\r\ntrouble has been reached. If the discomfort has continued for a good\r\nwhile, a sort of habit seems to be formed, and the attention of the\r\nmind gives a sense of uneasiness, if not discomfort, in the left\r\nabdominal region. Usually it is in the upper left quadrant and seems\r\nto be stomachic in origin. The discomfort is apparently due to the\r\npresence of air, or gas, which is not properly expelled because of\r\nsome lack of co-ordination of muscles, and then the warmth of a room\r\nor of the bed at night, or the presence of some slightly irritant\r\nsubstance makes the discomfort more noticeable. In the patient's\r\nover-stimulated condition, there is inability to withstand it\r\npatiently. In none of these cases is there a fever, though in all\r\nthere is some disturbance of the pulse as if the heart's action were\r\ninterfered with and the organ resented it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee_.--In some cases the same vague abdominal discomfort occurs as\r\na consequence of taking too much coffee. This is seen in men more than\r\nin women. The tea topers are nearly all women, though my attention was\r\nfirst called to this vague discomfort, that made life miserable for a\r\ntea tester, who spent most of his day tasting tea, though drinking\r\nvery little of it. With regard to coffee, individual idiosyncrasy is\r\nan extremely important matter. Some men seem to be able to take five,\r\nsix or even more cups of coffee in the day without inconvenience; some\r\ncannot take even a small cup of coffee after six o'clock at night\r\nwithout being kept awake for several hours; others cannot take a large\r\ncup of coffee in the morning without having considerable discomfort,\r\nwhich is usually attributed to indigestion. I have known large, strong\r\nmen, who were much better for not taking any coffee, or at the most a\r\ntablespoonful of it in a cup of milk in the morning to satisfy the\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoose Kidney.--Movable kidney is responsible for many of these cases\r\nof abdominal discomfort. Where it exists to a marked degree it may be\r\nrelieved by operation. It occurs much more frequently in women than in\r\nmen because, for physiological reasons, the kidneys are normally more\r\nmovable in women and this is particularly true of the right kidney,\r\nwhich would otherwise perhaps be injured by pressure between the\r\npregnant uterus and the liver. It is probable that many of the cases\r\nof the kidney of pregnancy are really due to an abnormal fixity of the\r\nkidney to a particular place, so that the growing uterus interferes by\r\npressure with its circulation and its function. Slight movability of\r\nthe kidney, then, should not be considered pathological.\r\n\r\nI have seen a number of these cases. They seem to occur particularly\r\nin women who have lost weight. The fat around the kidney is somewhat\r\nabsorbed during the course of loss in weight, and this leaves this\r\norgan more movable and also less protected and consequently more\r\nliable to irritation. One sees it rather frequently in many unmarried\r\nwomen who have some strenuous occupation. Many of these young women\r\ncome back from their vacation at the end of the summer having gained\r\nfifteen or twenty pounds in weight. If there has been any kidney\r\nsensitiveness or movability before, {308} both have usually\r\ndisappeared. The kidney is well held in place because there is much\r\nmore fat within the abdomen, all the organs are better cushioned, yet\r\nwithout any interference with their function.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the year these patients, school-teachers,\r\nstenographers, and daily workers of various kinds, lose in weight.\r\nWhen they have lost ten pounds the kidney begins to be sensitive again\r\nand somewhat movable. By the time they have lost fifteen to twenty\r\npounds there is serious complaint in the right upper quadrant of their\r\nabdomen extending at times over toward the navel, and the kidney\r\nbecomes quite movable. At this time the treatment must consist in\r\nholding the kidney as firmly in place as possible, for dragging\r\ndownward will be followed by reflex symptoms in the stomach and\r\nintestines. Disinclination to food, loss of appetite, and even the\r\noccurrence of some nausea, as well as some constipation, are easily\r\ntraced to kidney reflexes. During the night there is no trouble,\r\nbecause while the patient is lying down the kidney falls into its\r\nproper position. On arising in the morning the kidney drops down out\r\nof place. If a corset is put on at this time the kidney may be forced\r\nstill further out of place, giving rise, after a couple of hours, to\r\nconsiderable discomfort. New shoes can be borne at first, but after a\r\ntime the pressure they produce shuts off circulation and causes\r\nintolerable discomfort. To a less degree this happens to the kidney if\r\nthus compressed and this explains the course of symptoms in many\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Treatment_.--If the corset is adjusted before the patient\r\nrises, and fits reasonably snugly, but not too tight, the contents of\r\nthe abdomen will all be kept in place, and the kidney will maintain\r\nits normal position. When the corset is not sufficient to retain the\r\nkidney in place, a simple pad, a towel or a napkin or, if there is\r\nmuch sensitiveness, something more elaborate, especially adapted to\r\nconditions, can be placed over the kidney, and when held firmly by the\r\ncorset will keep the kidney in its place. At first the kidney is\r\nusually sensitive to this on account of having been pressed upon\r\nduring the preceding weeks or months. The patient must bear some\r\nlittle inconvenience at first, must get accustomed to the new\r\nconditions in which the kidney is kept in place, and must not expect\r\ncomplete relief at once. Any improvement must be considered a step\r\nforward, and further amelioration can be confidently promised. As in\r\nall other cases of the use of apparatus or mechanical\r\naids--spectacles, false teeth or crutches--the patient must be content\r\nto grow used to the new order of things, before expecting satisfying\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThis is the palliative treatment. The natural treatment of many of\r\nthese cases is to have the patient maintain such weight as will hold\r\nthe kidney in place, because of the fat within the abdomen, without\r\nany necessity for external aids. This can be done more readily than is\r\noften thought to be possible. These patients insist that they lose\r\ntheir appetite when they settle down to work, but what they really\r\nlose is the habit of eating a definite amount at stated intervals.\r\nVery often it will be found that breakfast, which they took abundant\r\ntime to eat during vacation, is rushed. The luncheon suffers in the\r\nsame way and is small in quantity. They take only one good meal, and\r\none good meal is not sufficient to maintain normal weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Question of Operation_.--When a kidney is so movable as to deserve\r\nthe adjective \"floating,\" so that it moves considerably from its place\r\nand, perhaps, even sags and may be felt in the subumbilical region, it\r\nshould be fastened up {309} by surgical means. There is a choice\r\nbetween two evils. The fastening of the kidney in the loin does not\r\nrestore the normal condition, but puts it in an artificial condition.\r\nThe kidney supports are of such a kind that it was evidently meant to\r\nbe slightly movable. When it is fastened firmly in the loin, it is\r\nlikely to feel every jar, and certain post-operative cases that I have\r\nseen, in which firm adhesions had supposedly taken place, complained\r\nconsiderably of the discomfort occasioned by this. In a certain number\r\nof cases, even after the operation, the kidney is still somewhat\r\nmovable, because the adhesions yield and some of the old distress\r\nreturns. All this must be realized before there is any question of an\r\noperation. There must be not merely a little discomfort, but enough of\r\nactual ache and of reflex disturbance that can be traced directly to\r\nthe kidney to warrant the operation.\r\n\r\nNo floating kidney should be operated upon in a patient who has lost\r\nmuch in weight and has developed a sensitiveness of the kidney since\r\nthe reduction of weight. Definite efforts should first be made to\r\nbring about increase in weight, so as to see whether this will not\r\nrestore the previous condition of reasonable comfort. At times it is\r\nsaid that the disturbance of the stomach, that is reflex to such a\r\nfloating kidney, prevents the patient from taking and assimilating\r\nenough food to restore normal weight. This will be true if attention\r\nhas been called to the condition very seriously, and if the patient is\r\npersuaded that this is the reason why there is no appetite and poor\r\ndigestion. Ordinary palliative measures, such as a binder, or a\r\nspecially made corset, will be sufficient to prevent the kidney from\r\nproducing reflex disturbance of the stomach, and will exert a strong\r\nsuggestion to this effect under the influence of which the patient\r\nwill usually gain in weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intermittent Discomfort_.--The discomfort that comes with a loose\r\nkidney may be quite intermittent. I have known patients to be bothered\r\nby it for months, and then quite free from it for several years, only\r\nto have their discomfort renewed so that they become quite worried.\r\nSome definite local or mechanical condition can generally be found for\r\nthese variations in feeling.\r\n\r\nIn thin people a jolting ride over a rough road or stepping off a car\r\nwill occasionally be the beginning of the trouble, and as this also is\r\nlikely to cause a stone in the kidney to give its first\r\nmanifestations, there may be serious suspicion of a more grave\r\npathological condition than is really present. If this discomfort\r\ncontinues only the X-ray can absolutely decide the question.\r\n\r\nOnce the mechanical conditions which cause the discomfort are\r\nunderstood by the patient, the actual ache becomes much more easy to\r\nbear. Apprehension makes it almost intolerable. Attention exaggerates\r\nit, and makes diversion of mind difficult. Understanding helps all the\r\nconditions and lessens the pain, not actually but mentally, until\r\nafter a time very little attention is paid to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n{310}\r\n\r\nSECTION VII\r\n\r\n_CARDIOTHERAPY_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE HEART AND MENTAL INFLUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart is an organ so vitally important that we might expect it to\r\nbe carefully protected by nature from any interference with its action\r\nthrough mental influence, emotional conditions, or voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary feelings. As a matter of fact, it is extremely susceptible\r\nto mental influence, stimulant or depressive, and to emotions of all\r\nkinds. Psychotherapy, that is, the removal of inhibiting influences\r\noriginating in the mind, and the suggestion of favorable mental\r\ninfluences, is probably more important for the heart than for any\r\nother organ in the body. The law of reserve energy has its most\r\nnoteworthy applications with regard to it. When we are apparently so\r\ncompletely fatigued that we cannot do anything more, a purely mental\r\nstimulus may so enliven the heart as to give the body a new supply of\r\nstrength and energy. A man wandering through a desert, or swimming for\r\nhis life at sea, may be so exhausted as to be quite ready to give up\r\nentirely, and be brought to the conviction that he has absolutely no\r\nstrength left for further effort, when a flash in the distance, or a\r\nsound that indicates that help is near, or some other mental\r\nincitement, will give renewed energy. It is probably through the heart\r\nthat there comes to us most of our power to accomplish things when we\r\nare already so tired as to seem exhausted. On the other hand, it is\r\nthe failure of circulation in muscles, because of a slacking heart,\r\nthat produces the sense of exhaustion. Muscular work is easy or even\r\npleasant when we are in good spirits, while, whenever exertion is\r\nundertaken in the midst of discouragement, we cannot accomplish nearly\r\nso much as when conditions are so framed as to give stimulus and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nIf a perfectly normal heart can be so affected by mental conditions\r\nand emotions as to be seriously disturbed in its work on the one hand,\r\nor greatly stimulated into new activity on the other, it is to be\r\nexpected that a heart affected by disease will be similarly affected\r\nand probably even to a greater degree. It is clear, then, that our\r\ncardiac patients have to be guarded against unfavorable mental\r\nconditions, and have to have all their reserve energy called out for\r\nthem by encouragement and by the best possible prognosis for their\r\nreflection. This is especially true as regards the removal of the many\r\nunfavorable suggestions which, because of ignorance, have in the past\r\ngathered round most forms of heart disease.\r\n\r\n{311}\r\n\r\nEmotion and the Heart.--The mental and emotional influence over the\r\nheart's action was the truth that lay at the basis of the old fallacy\r\nwith regard to the physiology of the heart. The literature of all\r\ncountries testifies that the heart was long supposed to be the seat\r\nand origin of the emotions. Every one has experienced how the heart\r\njumps when something unexpected happens. People have fainted from\r\nexcess of joy as well as of grief. The physical side of emotion is so\r\ngenerally associated with some modification of the heart beat that it\r\nis no wonder that emotions were directly connected with the organ.\r\nWhen people are in depressed states the heart is apt to beat more\r\nslowly than usual, while when in states of exhilaration, even those\r\ndependent merely on mental factors, the pulse is more rapid.\r\nMelancholic states have occasionally been attributed to the slowness\r\nof the pulse, but the slow pulse seems to be a symptom connected with\r\nthe mental condition rather than a causative factor. In the maniacal\r\nconditions, the rapidity of the pulse, which is sometimes quite\r\nmarked, must probably be explained in the same way, as due to the\r\nmental excitement under which the patient is laboring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heart and the Nervous System.--Prof. Von Leyden ten years ago\r\nrecalled attention to the fact that the heart is literally the _primum\r\nmovens_ in man, and that before the central nervous system is laid\r\ndown, or there is any possible question of impulses flowing from\r\ncenter to periphery, the heart, or at least its embryonic\r\nrepresentative, is beating as constantly, regularly, rhythmically, as\r\nit is to do during all the subsequent life of the individual. Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes has expressed it poetically by stating that the angel\r\nof life sets this heart pendulum going and only the angel of death can\r\nbreak into the case and stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Primitive Heart Action_.--The original beating of the heart is\r\nentirely automatic, and quite apart from any nervous initiative or\r\nstimulus. The original bend in the primal blood vessel, which is to\r\nrepresent the heart in the course of development, begins to pulsate\r\nvery early in the chick and evidently does the same thing in all other\r\nliving things. Notwithstanding this fact that the heart is thus easily\r\ndemonstrated to be the _primum movens_, the first exhibitor of\r\nvitality, and might thus seem to be one of the organs or indeed the\r\none which should be safe from any nervous interference, later on\r\npowerful connections with the nervous system are made, and heart\r\nacceleration and inhibition become familiar phenomena. Every emotion,\r\nas we have said, has its influence on the heart and even a certain\r\namount of voluntary control may be acquired. Indian fakirs are said to\r\nbe able to cause the heart to slow and almost to stop. The curious\r\nphenomenon of suspended animation which they sometimes exhibit is said\r\nto be due to this. Certain of the well-developed muscular subjects who\r\nexhibit themselves at medical clinics are able to cause their hearts\r\nto miss a beat, but this is said to be rather a result of will-power\r\nover other muscles compressing the thorax, and interfering with the\r\nheart, than direct influence upon the heart itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence over Diseased Hearts.--Worry produces much more\r\nserious symptoms in heart patients than in others. Anxiety about the\r\nheart itself is often a source of serious detriment to a heart\r\npatient. Most people have such a terror of having anything the matter\r\nwith their hearts that the haunting thought of such calamity is likely\r\nto have a definite influence in preventing the development of such\r\ncompensation as will enable the heart to {312} do its work to the best\r\nadvantage. It used to be the custom to refrain from telling patients\r\nsuffering from tuberculosis that they had the disease. On the other\r\nhand, people with heart disease were usually informed of that fact.\r\nThe reason given for the latter course was that heart disease may in\r\nmany cases be the forerunner of sudden death, and the warning\r\nknowledge was supposed to enable a man to get his affairs in order. No\r\nworse policy for either disease could well have been imagined. The\r\npulmonary patient should be told at once, the heart patient should, as\r\nfar as possible, be saved the depressing knowledge of his condition.\r\n\r\nDr. MacKenzie, whose practically illuminating studies of heart disease\r\ngive him a right to express opinions with regard to it (and when those\r\nopinions concern the influence of the mind they are doubly valuable\r\nbecause of the absolute objectivity of his studies), has some rather\r\nstrong expressions with regard to the importance of modifying the\r\nmental state in heart cases. He says:\r\n\r\n  The consciousness of heart trouble has often a depressing effect on\r\n  people, whether the trouble be slight or serious. When such people\r\n  become convinced that the trouble is curable or not serious, their\r\n  condition at once becomes greatly improved. Cures by faith, whether\r\n  in drugs, baths, elaborate methods or religion, act by playing upon\r\n  the mental condition. But our employment of this element in\r\n  treatment should not be the outcome of blind unreasoning faith in\r\n  some rite or ceremony, bath or drug, but in the intelligent\r\n  perception of the nature of the symptoms. The reassurance of the\r\n  patient of the harmless nature of the complaint goes a great way in\r\n  curing him. The reassurance that with reasonable care no danger need\r\n  be feared is extremely helpful. Even in serious cases when there is\r\n  reasonable hope of recovery or a certain degree of recovery, the\r\n  encouragement of the patient may and does help forward his\r\n  improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart Remedies and Suggestion.--Probably the best evidence we have for\r\nthe influence of the mind over the heart in diseased conditions, that\r\nis, when there is definite organic change in the heart valves or\r\nmuscle, is to be found in the history of the many remedies that have\r\ncome and gone in heart therapeutics during the past generation.\r\nStrophanthus, for instance, was very popular a quarter of a century\r\nago, and it seems as though in many cases it not only replaced, but\r\nwas more efficient than digitalis. How few there are who use it now\r\nwith confidence, and how general is the impression that it does not\r\naffect the heart to any extent! The confidence with which the remedy\r\nwas given by the physician was conveyed to the patient and he \"took\r\nheart,\" as the expression is, and proceeded to get better. Even more\r\nstriking is the evidence afforded by other remedies. For a while it\r\nseemed that cactus provided a heart stimulant and regulator of value.\r\nConvalaria also gained a reputation as a heart remedy. Both are now\r\npractically abandoned. Here, once more, the real remedy, when these\r\nsubstances were employed, was, undoubtedly, the suggestion to the\r\npatient in connection with the regulation of his habits of life, so\r\nthat his heart got a chance to catch up with its work. There are other\r\nremedies with which we had similar experiences.\r\n\r\nEven digitalis has had phases of confidence and distrust in it, that\r\nare interesting to study in the light of what we now know with regard\r\nto the influence of the psyche on the heart. One hears at medical\r\nsociety meetings reports of the favorable action of digitalis within a\r\nfew hours of its administration. These are not examples of digitalis\r\naction, but of mental influence. {313} Any heart patient after the\r\nfirst visit of a physician in whom he has confidence is sure to\r\nbrighten up at once, heart action is ever so much better and symptoms\r\nof mental depression, and even of circulatory disturbance, disappear.\r\nIt is this that has made the study of even the efficiency of digitalis\r\nso difficult. There were times when most physicians employed it in\r\nrather large quantities for all forms of heart disease. In some heart\r\ncases it is absolutely contra-indicated. Fortunately many of the\r\npreparations of digitalis used in the past were quite inert, and so no\r\nharm was done. The results obtained were psychotherapeutic.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac Inhibition.--The importance of the role of the nervous system\r\nand of the mental influences which control it in all functions is well\r\nillustrated by what we have learned during the last half century with\r\nregard to inhibition in the animal organism. We used to think that\r\nwhile the nervous system sent down positive impulses--that is, nervous\r\nstimuli which brought about the accomplishment of certain\r\nactivities--it had nothing to do with the stoppage of those\r\nactivities. Such interference was supposed always to be due to\r\nexternal influences of various kinds, potent for the time, in the\r\norganism. We have learned, however, that inhibition is one of the\r\nimportant functions of the nervous system. The idea has now become so\r\nfamiliar that sometimes we are apt to forget how great is its\r\nsignificance. Lauder Brunton, in his article on \"Inhibition,\" set\r\nforth its role as we have come to know it.\r\n\r\n  The recognition of the part inhibition plays in vital phenomena is\r\n  undoubtedly one of the most important discoveries which have been\r\n  made in physiology since Harvey discovered the circulation of the\r\n  blood. It throws light upon an immense number of phenomena\r\n  previously inexplicable and enables us to form theories of a\r\n  satisfactory nature about many vital problems. It offers an\r\n  explanation of the nature of hypnotic states, which is at least as\r\n  satisfactory as that we have of the action of many drugs.\r\n\r\n  The nervous mechanism of the heart affords the best and most\r\n  commonly cited example of inhibitory action, and here it was first\r\n  studied by Weber and Claude Bernard in 1848. The cardiac ganglia\r\n  derived from the sympathetic preside over the movements of the\r\n  organ, and in response to the stimulus of the intra-ventricular\r\n  blood-pressure cause rhythmical contraction of the cavities. Their\r\n  action is, however, controlled by the pneumogastric nerve, through\r\n  which impulses of an inhibitory nature are constantly traveling and\r\n  acting as a restraining force.\r\n\r\nAs noted by Lauder Brunton, the late Professor Czermak had a small\r\nglandular tumor in close contact with the right pneumogastric nerve\r\nand he was able by pressure on this to compress the nerve to any\r\nextent he wished, and either \"to completely stop the heart or simply\r\nretard it.\" He often performed this experiment so that it is not\r\nnearly so dangerous as might be thought. We have some instances,\r\napparently too well authenticated to be doubted, in which the power of\r\nthe human will to inhibit heart action has been as strikingly\r\nmanifested as this mechanical disturbance of Professor Czermak.\r\nSometimes these stories of cardiac inhibition through the will are\r\ndismissed as unworthy of credence, and doubtless many of them are mere\r\nfiction, or have been exaggerated for sensational purposes, but some\r\nof them are very suggestive examples of the power of the will over the\r\nheart. If only a modicum of such power were to be employed, it would\r\nseriously hamper heart action, and it must be the aim of psychotherapy\r\nto prevent such inhibition.\r\n\r\n{314}\r\n\r\nAt least one instance of voluntary heart inhibition was observed by\r\nthoroughly trained and properly accredited scientists. A report of it\r\nhas been published. As a bit of documentary evidence, on a subject\r\nthat is usually considered so vague as to be scarcely worth\r\nconsidering, Dr. Cheyne's description of the remarkable power of\r\nColonel Tonshend over his heart should be in the hands of those who\r\nwish to influence hearts through minds and wills.\r\n\r\n  He could die or expire when he pleased, and yet by an effort, or\r\n  somehow, he could come to life again. . . . We all three felt his\r\n  pulse first: it was distinct, though small and thready, and his\r\n  heart had its usual beating. He composed himself upon his back and\r\n  lay in a still posture for some time. While I held his right hand.\r\n  Dr. Baynard laid his hand upon his heart, and Mr. Skrine held a\r\n  clean looking-glass to his mouth. I found his pulse sink gradually\r\n  till at last I could not feel any, by the most exact and nice touch;\r\n  Dr. Baynard could not feel the least motion in the heart, nor Mr.\r\n  Skrine discern the least soil of breath on the bright mirror. Then\r\n  each of us by turns examined his arm, heart and breath, but could\r\n  not by the nicest scrutiny, discover the least symptom of life in\r\n  him. We reasoned a long time about this odd appearance, and finding\r\n  he still continued in that position, we began to conclude that he\r\n  had indeed carried the experiment too far; and at last we were\r\n  satisfied that he was already dead, and were just ready to leave\r\n  him. This continued about half an hour. . . . As we were going away\r\n  we perceived some motion about the body, and, upon examination,\r\n  found his pulse and the motion of his heart gradually returning; he\r\n  began to breathe heavily and speak softly.\r\n\r\nNor must it be thought that the inhibitory faculty can act only in\r\nslowing the heart. Normally a certain amount of inhibition is\r\nexercised over the heart's action. If by any chance this should be\r\ndecreased then acceleration of cardiac activity may take place. Lauder\r\nBrunton called attention to that in discussing another phase of\r\npneumogastric function. He said:\r\n\r\n  Paralysis of the pneumogastric, of course, does away with its\r\n  action. And hence we have among other symptoms of this condition\r\n  increased rapidity of the contractions of the heart from withdrawal\r\n  of the inhibitory influence.\r\n\r\nIf slowing of the heart action can be produced through the mind by\r\nthis mechanism of inhibition, so also under other circumstances may\r\nacceleration occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nShock and the Heart--How large a role emotion plays in disturbing the\r\naction of a heart that is already diseased, is illustrated by the\r\nstory told in serious histories, on what seems good authority, of the\r\ndwarf of the French king, who was frightened to death by what he\r\nthought were the arrangements for his execution. While we take great\r\npains as a rule to impress upon sufferers from organic heart disease\r\nthe necessity for their avoiding every kind of over-exertion, or\r\nsudden movement of any kind, we do not always impress upon them the\r\neven greater necessity for the avoidance of shock and fright, and\r\nprofound emotions. It must not be thought that emotional shocks have a\r\ndeleterious effect only in advanced cases of heart trouble. Almost any\r\nphysician will readily recall examples where emotion had much to do\r\nwith the break in compensation which indicates that the heart has for\r\na time been overworked.\r\n\r\nA case in my own experience illustrates this: The patient, a student,\r\nhad suffered from severe so-called growing pains, undoubtedly\r\nrheumatic, when he was about fourteen, and probably had acquired a\r\nheart lesion at that time. {315} It did not, however, disturb him in\r\nthe slightest degree. The patient had never noticed any fatigue on\r\nrunning up stairs; he had no shortness of breath; there were no\r\nsymptoms pointing to his heart. One summer while his family were in\r\nthe country he came into town for the day, and missing the last train\r\nout, he went to the family home to sleep, though it had been closed up\r\nfor the summer. He let himself in without difficulty and was preparing\r\nto go to bed when he resolved to get a glass of water. There being no\r\ntumbler nearer than the dining-room, he went there. As he entered the\r\ndining-room he struck a match. With the flash of the light he found\r\nhimself looking into the barrel of a revolver and a hoarse voice said,\r\n\"Hands up!\" His hands went up. The next minute he was in the hands of\r\ntwo \"plain clothes\" policemen who had been watching the neighborhood\r\nbecause of recent burglaries. Noticing the light upstairs, they had\r\nmade their way in for the purpose of catching what they thought a\r\nburglar at work.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, who had never before fainted, collapsed almost at\r\nonce, and was unconscious for some minutes. The next day he was rather\r\nprostrated and tired on movement. By resting a good deal for the next\r\nweek this passed off to a considerable degree, but then his physician\r\nfound that he was suffering from a serious heart lesion, with a\r\ndecided break in compensation. I saw him several months later. His\r\nheart had never regained its old power, and his mitral valve was quite\r\nunable to fulfill its function. Just what the mechanism of the almost\r\nsudden break in compensation was after he had been for so long quite\r\nimmune from any effects of the rheumatism, is hard to say, but the\r\nlesson of the case is easy to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace of Psychotherapy in Treatment.--The role of psychotherapy, then,\r\nin heart cases consists in the recognition of the part that the mind,\r\nthe will and the emotions play in their influence over this important\r\norgan. These psychic factors may produce disturbed conditions of\r\nvarious kinds. The more experience the physician has with cardiac\r\ncases of all kinds, organic as well as functional, the more powerful\r\ndoes he recognize the influence of the mind over the heart to be. The\r\nexpression that a man is living on his will is no mere figure of\r\nspeech. Some cases we have cited seem to show that a favorable\r\nattitude of mind keeps up heart action, where an unfavorable attitude\r\nwould almost surely allow the heart to fail. It is this very potent\r\ninfluence then that must be used to as great advantage as possible in\r\nthe psychotherapy of cardiac patients.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most important phase of it is in prophylaxis. As far\r\nas possible we must save our heart patients from emotions. The effect\r\nof emotion on the heart is known. When that organ is already crippled,\r\nemotion may produce a serious strain on it. It is as important to save\r\nheart patients from joyful emotions as from those of contrary nature.\r\nMany a son who, after years of absence, thought to surprise a dear old\r\nmother by suddenly presenting himself to her, has learned to his cost\r\nthat an old heart may break from joy, almost as easily as from sorrow,\r\nand may be as unfavorably affected by the glad emotions as by terror\r\nor fright. We must also save heart patients from the unfavorable\r\ninfluence of a bad prognosis, and of too serious a diagnosis, both of\r\nwhich may be quite unjustified, for the rule is that the longer a man\r\nhas been studying the heart, the less likely is he to be confident in\r\nhis diagnosis, or unfavorable in his prognosis.\r\n\r\n{316}\r\n\r\nThe curative place of psychotherapy is in the obtaining, as far as\r\npossible, of placid easy lives for these patients. This does not mean\r\nthat they are to give up their occupations, for very often the\r\ninternal emotional life, which develops when they have nothing to do\r\nbut think about themselves, will be more serious in its effect upon\r\nthe heart than the ordinary vocation. Exciting incidents in life work\r\nmust, however, be avoided. If men are in occupations that require\r\nexposure to excitement, then it may be advisable to change their\r\noccupations. Brokers, speculators, actors, sometimes public speakers,\r\non whom appearances in public in spite of apparent placidity are often\r\na severe strain, may have to be guided into quieter paths of life. In\r\ngeneral, in every attempt to treat heart disease, and the neurotic\r\nsymptoms which develop in connection with it, the patient's mind must\r\nbe considered as one of the most important therapeutic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS IN HEART DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more carefully heart disease, and particularly individual patients\r\naffected by various heart lesions, have been studied in recent years\r\nthe more it has come to be appreciated that the most important element\r\nin the treatment of organic heart disease is the definite recognition\r\nof the difficulty of exact diagnosis of most cardiac conditions and\r\nthe unfortunate tendency to make the prognosis worse than it really\r\nis. Many heart affections are quite compatible with long life. In the\r\npast both of these problems of diagnosis and prognosis have been only\r\ntoo often solved unfavorably to the patient, to the serious detriment\r\nof his power of physical reaction against the ailment. Many a patient\r\nhas been seriously disturbed and even his power of compensation\r\nlessened by having a diagnosis of an organic affection of the heart\r\nmade with the usual prognosis, or at least strong suggestion of early\r\ndeath that goes with it, when there was no justification for such an\r\nunfavorable opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Attitude of Patient.--We do not pretend to cure tuberculosis,\r\nbut we do relieve its symptoms and bring about a remission in the\r\nprogress with a shutting in of the lesions. In heart disease something\r\nof the same kind can very often be accomplished. This does not mean\r\nthat in advanced cases of heart disease much good can be accomplished\r\nany more than in advanced cases of tuberculosis, though in both a\r\nchange of the mental attitude may lift the patient from what seems\r\nalmost a death-bed into renewed activity for a prolonged period.\r\nProbably heart disease is more serious in its prognosis than\r\ntuberculosis, yet undoubtedly the lives of many patients could be\r\nprolonged nearly as much as in the pulmonary affection and a large\r\namount of suffering saved through mental influence. We do not hesitate\r\nto change the occupation and the place of abode of the patient\r\nsuffering from tuberculosis. There is even greater reason for doing\r\nthis same thing when it seems advisable with patients suffering from\r\nheart disease.\r\n\r\nWith regard to heart disease, the best authorities are now agreed that\r\nit is better, as a rule, not to tell the patient himself unless it is\r\nabsolutely {317} necessary to do so in order to get him to take the\r\nprecautions that will prevent further deterioration of his cardiac\r\ncondition. The depression incident to the knowledge that one has a\r\nserious heart lesion is not reacted against, and especially not during\r\na threatening break in compensation, and a more favorable time must be\r\nwaited for to reveal his condition to him. The danger of sudden death\r\nin valvular heart disease is much less than is popularly supposed.\r\nOnly sufferers from aortic heart disease are likely to die without\r\nwarning, and this form of the disease is comparatively rare. The death\r\nof the patient suffering from mitral disease is likely to be\r\nlingering. Mitral disease is the commonest form of heart disease, and\r\nthe prognosis of it in ordinary cases is by no means so grave as is\r\nusually supposed. I have seen a patient still alive with a mitral\r\nmurmur who told the story of having had his affection originally\r\ndiagnosed as mitral regurgitation by Skoda, the distinguished Vienna\r\ndiagnostician, over forty years before. This patient at the time I saw\r\nhim was nearly seventy years of age, still had the mitral murmur, but\r\nhis apex beat was scarcely if at all displaced and there was neither\r\nenlargement of the ventricle nor apparently any degeneration of the\r\nauricle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apex Beat and Heart Murmurs.--In this regard an expression of\r\nProf. Carl Gerhardt of Berlin deserves to be recalled. That\r\ndistinguished clinician used to say that if the apex beat was not\r\ndisplaced there was no good reason for thinking that any heart\r\naffection which might be present was serious enough to require active\r\ntreatment. Heart murmurs have been made entirely of too much\r\nsignificance and any man of considerable experience is likely to have\r\nseen a number of patients who, because they had a heart murmur, had\r\nbeen seriously and needlessly disturbed by having a physician tell\r\nthem that they had heart disease, with an air of finality that seemed\r\nto the patients to say that they might prepare for the worst very\r\nsoon. Patients suffering from diseased hearts have to care specially\r\nfor themselves, but not to the extent of living such maimed lives as\r\nis likely to be the case if they are depressed by an unfortunate\r\nexaggeration of the seriousness of their condition.\r\n\r\nOur best authorities in* heart disease have at all times proclaimed\r\ntheir uncertainty as to the diagnosis of heart conditions from\r\nmurmurs, while mediocre men of comparatively slight experience have\r\nnot hesitated to declare their certainty in this difficult matter. It\r\nis not an unusual thing to hear of a supposed expert having declared\r\nupon the witness stand and under oath that he could tell whether a man\r\nhad heart disease by _listening_ to his heart, and some have even gone\r\nthe length of making their decisions in this matter while listening\r\nfor a few moments sometimes even above the clothing of the patient!\r\nNeedless to say, this is quite unjustifiable in our present knowledge\r\nof the status of heart affections and only men of small experience and\r\nover-confidence in themselves make any such declarations. The more\r\nexperience a physician has had in heart disease, the more careful he\r\nis not to make positive declarations. One or two examinations may very\r\neasily be deceptive unless there are signs quite apart from those in\r\nthe heart itself. Indeed, it is much more the state of the individual\r\nthan the state of the heart itself, or anything that can be found out\r\nabout it, except after a prolonged and repeated study, that enables us\r\nto make definite decisions. Probably no one during the nineteenth\r\ncentury had studied hearts more carefully than Prof. William Stokes,\r\nwhose books on the subject were so widely read. He wrote:\r\n\r\n{318}\r\n\r\n  We read that a murmur with a first sound, under certain\r\n  circumstances, indicates lesion of the mitral valves. And again,\r\n  that a murmur with the second sound has this or that value. All this\r\n  may be very true, but is it always easy to determine which of the\r\n  sounds is the first, and which is the second? Every candid observer\r\n  must answer this question in the negative. In certain cases of\r\n  weakened hearts acting rapidly and irregularly, it is often scarcely\r\n  possible to determine the point. Again, even where the pulsations of\r\n  the heart are not much increased in rapidity, it sometimes, when a\r\n  loud murmur exists, becomes difficult to say with which sound the\r\n  murmur is associated. The murmur may mask not only the sound with\r\n  which it is properly synchronous, but also that with which it has no\r\n  connection, so that in some cases even of regularly acting hearts,\r\n  with a distinct systolic pulse, and the back stroke with the second\r\n  sound, nothing is to be heard but one loud murmur.\r\n\r\n  So great is the difficulty in some cases, that we cannot resist\r\n  altering our opinions from day to day as to which is the first and\r\n  which the second sound.\r\n\r\n  To the inexperienced the detailed descriptions of such phenomena as\r\n  the intensification of the sounds of the pulmonary valves; of\r\n  constrictive murmurs as distinguished from non-constrictive; of\r\n  associations of different murmurs at the opposite sides of the\r\n  heart; of pre-systolic and post-systolic, pre-diastolic and\r\n  post-diastolic murmurs, act injuriously--first, by conveying the\r\n  idea that the separate existence of these phenomena is certain, and\r\n  that their diagnostic value is established; and secondly, by\r\n  diverting attention from the great object, which--it cannot be too\r\n  often repeated--is to ascertain if the murmur proceeds from an\r\n  organic cause; and again, to determine the vital and physical state\r\n  of the cavities of the heart. . . .\r\n\r\nThere are too many cases in which murmurs have no such serious\r\nsignificance as was often attributed to them when first studied, and\r\nyet it used to be almost a universal custom among physicians, and the\r\ncustom still obtains with many, to tell a patient rather emphatically\r\nwhenever a heart murmur was present, that he had heart disease. Above\r\nall, too much significance has been ascribed to murmurs in initial\r\ncases of heart disease and these are just the cases that should not be\r\ndisturbed by unfavorable suggestion. The louder the murmur the less\r\nlikelihood there is of there being heart disease in the ordinarily\r\naccepted sense of the term, that is, that the heart is so affected as\r\nto be incapable of doing its work properly, for where loud murmurs are\r\npresent this is almost never the case. A murmur that may be heard a\r\nfoot distant is usually associated with perfect compensation.\r\n\r\nIf this were remembered by those who examine hearts generally, there\r\nwould be much less disturbance of heart action by unfavorable mental\r\ninfluence. A great many more who are suffering from certain\r\nsymptomatic conditions of the heart not surely or necessarily\r\ndependent on organic lesions, are plunged into depression by\r\nunfortunate, premature or exaggerated expressions on the part of their\r\nphysicians. It is almost a rule to have men and even women patients\r\nsay that it makes no difference to them, that they should be told the\r\nexact truth as to what their condition is. The future has been\r\nmercifully hidden from us in most things and there is no doubt that\r\nthis plan is the better for human comfort and accomplishment\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThe truth is not easy to find and oftener in these cases lies on the\r\nside of favorable prognosis and refusal to think the worst than the\r\nopposite. In this there has been a great difference between the German\r\nand the Irish schools of medicine. The three great Irish physicians,\r\nGraves, Stokes and Corrigan, insisted on the place of the individual\r\nand upon how much depends upon the general conditions in pulmonary and\r\ncardiac disease. Our teaching in {319} America in this matter has come\r\nnot from the conservative British schools of medicine, but from the\r\nGerman school, and that has had a notable tendency to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of heart signs over the general condition.\r\n\r\nWhat a great distinction there is between this mode of looking at\r\nthese diseases and the German method was pointed out by Prof. Lindwurm\r\nof Munich, when he translated Prof. Stokes' work on the heart into\r\nGerman. Prof. Lindwurm said:\r\n\r\n  Thus our modern German works are to a greater or lesser extent only\r\n  treatises on the physical diagnosis of organic affections of the\r\n  heart. Stokes, on the contrary, resists this one-sided tendency\r\n  which bases the diagnosis solely on physical signs and disregards\r\n  the all-important vital phenomena; he lays less weight on the\r\n  differential diagnosis of lesions on the several valves and on the\r\n  situation of a sound than on the condition of the heart in general,\r\n  and especially on the question as to whether a murmur is organic or\r\n  inorganic, and whether the disease itself is organic or functional.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadbent on Cardiac Diagnosis.--What Stokes taught the\r\nEnglish-speaking world so emphatically in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century Sir William Broadbent was just as insistent about\r\nin the latter half. It is evident, then, that clinical experience has\r\nnot changed its viewpoint in these matters in spite of all our study\r\nof the heart in the interval. In his paper on \"The Conduct of the\r\nHeart in the Face of Difficulties\" he has many suggestions that will\r\nprevent the physician of less experience from taking too pessimistic a\r\nview of heart symptoms. He said:\r\n\r\n  Moreover, the heart has very special relations with the nervous\r\n  system; it reflects every emotion, beats high with courage, is\r\n  palsied by fear, throbs rapidly and violently with excitement, and\r\n  acts feebly under nervous depression; but it is not only through the\r\n  cerebro-spinal system that the heart is influenced, it is in\r\n  immediate relation with the vasomotor nervous apparatus, and in a\r\n  scarcely less degree with the sympathetic system generally.\r\n  Normally, afferent impulses are constantly flowing from the viscera\r\n  to the central nervous system and by this reflex process their blood\r\n  supply is regulated, and their functional activity is governed.\r\n  These afferent impulses when perverted by functional derangement or\r\n  disease may become serious disturbing influences.\r\n\r\n  The nervous system in a large and increasing proportion of people is\r\n  unduly sensitive and excessively mobile, and the reactions to\r\n  influences of every kind are exaggerated. In some a little emotional\r\n  excitement gives rise to palpitation, and a piece of bad news or the\r\n  bang of a door seems to stop the heart altogether. _There is in such\r\n  subjects no form or degree of cardiac disease which may not he\r\n  simulated_. [Italics ours.] Add a touch of hysteria on the lookout\r\n  for symptoms and for someone to give ear to the narration of the\r\n  unparalleled agonies of the sufferer, and the difficulties of the\r\n  heart, and it may be added of dealing with them, are complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypical Case.--We are prone to think that after the age of seventy the\r\nexistence of definite heart murmurs with some tendency to blueness of\r\nthe lips and of the fingers, with coldness of the hands, surely\r\nindicates the presence of a serious heart lesion. It is in old people,\r\nhowever, that such symptoms may be most deceptive. The outcome may\r\nprove that physical signs ordinarily presumed to be surely indicative\r\nof organic disease may be only signs of functional disorder, or at\r\nmost may represent certain organic affections for which even the old\r\nheart is thoroughly capable of compensation. One such instance in my\r\nown experience is so striking that I venture to give it in detail.\r\n\r\n{320}\r\n\r\nThis was the case of an old physician friend of some eighty years of\r\nage. His son had a summer lodge in the Adirondacks. Though for some\r\nsixty years the father had been living at the sea level in New York\r\nalmost constantly, he went up to visit the son and be with his\r\ngrandchildren at an elevation of nearly 2,500 feet. His heart began to\r\nbother him almost at once and he could not go up or down stairs or\r\ntake any exercise without considerable discomfort, marked shortness of\r\nbreath and a tendency to palpitation that was almost alarming. He\r\ncontinued his stay for several months in the hope that he would get\r\nused to the altitude, though there were always difficulties of\r\ncirculation manifested by blue lips and finger nails. He returned to\r\nNew York and placed himself under the care of a heart specialist who\r\nfound what appeared to be evident signs of heart deterioration of\r\nmuscular character complicated by valvular lesions. He consoled, the\r\nold gentleman by the reflection that a heart that had served his\r\npurposes so well for eighty years could not really be complained of if\r\nnow it should show some signs of deterioration. He also insisted that\r\nany mental work would be almost sure to be injurious because of the\r\ncalls upon the circulation that it would make.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was ordered South for the following winter with an\r\nabsolute prohibition of any mental work. He had planned to revise an\r\nhistorical work on which he had been engaged for many years and which\r\nhad served to keep him in good health perhaps more than anything else.\r\nThis was put away entirely and he proceeded to try to get well doing\r\nnothing. Almost needless to say with nothing to do he did not get\r\nwell. He had been an extremely busy man all his life, had worked at\r\nleast twelve to fourteen hours a day for most of the preceding fifty\r\nyears, and for him to do nothing would be quite as impossible as for a\r\nchild to be kept in utter physical inactivity. His heart palpitation\r\ncontinued and grew worse. He was waked up at night by starts that\r\nseriously disturbed him and usually kept him from sleep for hours. As\r\nhe said himself, after he had read the morning paper and gone to\r\nstool, there was nothing else for him to do all day except eat and\r\nsleep, and these incidents had never occupied any of his attention in\r\nthe past. In spite of the doctor's orders he had his manuscript sent\r\nto him and proceeded to work. At once he began to grow better. At the\r\nend of three months he was feeling better than he had felt for several\r\nyears. When I saw him, about his eighty-first birthday, he was looking\r\nbetter than he had for some time.\r\n\r\nAs he said himself in describing his case, his own experience had\r\ntaught him that the more fuss a heart made the less likelihood was\r\nthere of its having anything serious the matter with it, at least of\r\nsuch a character as would terminate life suddenly or unexpectedly. The\r\nserious heart lesions are those which give no symptoms, or but very\r\nslight ones, and the sudden deaths in heart disease usually come from\r\nthe development of insidious symptoms that do not betray themselves to\r\nthe patient until the fatal termination is on them. The more the\r\npatient himself has been disturbed by his heart, the less likelihood\r\nis there of its giving out suddenly. The subjective symptoms are\r\nusually due to the fact that the heart is actively overcoming external\r\ninterference, or resenting over-attention to it in its work. Certain\r\nit is, that the neglect of it, so far as that is consonant with\r\nreasonably regular life, is the very best thing and the most important\r\npart of any prescription given for symptomatic heart disease, whether\r\norganic or functional, is to forget it just as far as possible.\r\n\r\n{321}\r\n\r\nHeart Symptoms in the Young.--In young people particularly it is\r\nimportant not to suggest the possibility of heart disease until there\r\nare definite signs in the circulation apart from the heart which place\r\nthe diagnosis beyond all doubt. The psychotherapeutics of organic\r\nheart disease that is most important is that of prophylaxis. Patients'\r\nminds must be guarded as far as possible against disturbance from the\r\nthought that they have heart disease, for this of itself adds a new\r\nfactor which tends to disturb compensation and adds to the heart's\r\nlabor because worry interferes with the vasomotor mechanism. In this\r\nmatter it seems advisable to repeat once more that there must be a\r\ncomplete reversal of the customs that have existed until now with\r\nregard to tuberculosis and heart disease. Consumptives have from the\r\nvery nature of their disease a tendency to hopefulness which soon\r\nbrings about a favorable reaction against the bad news, but heart\r\npatients derive no advantage from the announcement and, indeed, if\r\nthey are of the nervous, worrying kind, the effect of it is likely to\r\nbe cumulative. A week after being told the worst a consumptive has\r\nreacted vigorously and hopefully, and if he has a fair share of\r\nimmunity, the scare will do good by making him take the precautions\r\nnecessary to increase his resistive vitality. At the end of the same\r\ntime a heart patient will be just realizing all the significance of\r\nthe unfavorable diagnosis and prognosis of his case.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that heart patients by knowing their condition will be\r\npreserved better from injuring themselves by over-exertion, but what\r\nwe have said elsewhere about the value of exercise in the treatment of\r\nheart cases shows how much patients may be injured by having their\r\nexercise too much reduced and their activity inhibited by the dread\r\nconsequent upon the announcement made to them. It is perfectly easy to\r\ninsist with them that they shall not do sudden things, or take violent\r\nexercise, or overdo activity, without disturbing them by the dread\r\nwords \"heart disease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCARDIAC NEUROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as all the authorities recognize, the attitude of mind toward\r\norganic heart disease is extremely important and when favorable is a\r\nmost helpful therapeutic factor, it is easy to understand that in\r\nneurotic conditions of the heart this is of even more significance.\r\nThe term \"heart disease\" is bound up with so many unfortunate and\r\npersistently unfavorable suggestions that it seems advisable not to\r\nuse it with regard to non-organic conditions, even though it may be\r\nassociated with the epithets functional or neurotic. For these the\r\nterm cardiac neuroses, which avoids the implication of heart disease\r\nin the ordinary sense, seems preferable. Many of the cardiac neuroses\r\nare quite trifling. Many of them endure for years without producing\r\nany serious effect or disturbance of the general health. Many\r\nfunctional disturbances of the heart action which are extremely\r\nannoying may disappear entirely with judicious regulation of life. The\r\none important condition in all of these cases is to be sure that the\r\npatient does not worry over the condition, for that {322} hampers\r\nheart activity and leads to functional disturbances of other organs\r\nwhich make the heart's work harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties.--There are many forms of cardiac neuroses. Indeed,\r\nfunctional heart affections are so individual that it is hard to\r\nclassify them. In every case it is extremely important to study the\r\nindividual and recognize just what are the special factors bringing\r\nabout the disturbance of heart action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Palpitation_.--In a certain number of the cases it will be found,\r\nindeed, that there is no real disturbance, but that in some way the\r\nheart action has been brought above the threshold of consciousness and\r\nhas become noticeable to the patient. It must not be forgotten that\r\nthe heart is an intensely active organ. Several gallons of blood are\r\npumped through it every minute and yet it accomplishes its work, as a\r\nrule, with such noiseless, frictionless regularity that most people\r\nknow nothing about it. When the action of the heart becomes conscious,\r\nit is usually spoken of as palpitation. Patients are sure to think\r\nthat this must mean serious over-action, though, as a rule, no sign of\r\nover-action or at most a slight exaggeration of the muscular sounds of\r\nthe heart will be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Missed Beats_.--A further stage of this cardiac neurosis is the\r\nmissing of beats. This occurs particularly in those whose attention\r\nhas been directed for some time to their heart action by the presence\r\nof palpitation. It may be due to nothing more than this\r\nover-concentration of attention. It may be due, however, to mechanical\r\ndisturbances, an over-distended stomach, constipation, or certain\r\nnervous factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrhythmia_.--A third stage of cardiac neuroses consists of\r\nirregularity of the heart action, in which not only are the beats\r\nmissed occasionally, but there may be certain heart sounds much less\r\nvigorous than others and the spaces between the sounds may be very\r\nunequal. This condition is usually said to be due to some serious\r\ncondition of the heart muscles, and undoubtedly it often is. There is\r\nno doubt, however, that great irregularity of the heart may occur\r\nentirely as a neurotic condition without any organic affection and\r\nfrom factors quite extraneous to the heart itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--There are three causative conditions for cardiac neuroses\r\nthat deserve careful study and that can be very much modified by\r\nchanging the attitude of the patient's mind toward his condition. The\r\nfirst of these is an over-attention to self such as is particularly\r\ninduced by a life without much exercise and devoted to things\r\nintellectual. The direct causation is probably intimately connected\r\nwith the second etiological factor in the production of cardiac\r\nneuroses. This consists of an absence of sufficient exercise for the\r\nheart itself, when it actually seems to disturb its own activity\r\nbecause adequate calls for exertion are not made on it to use up\r\naccumulated energy. Cardiac neuroses are seen particularly in those\r\nwho having had considerable exercise in earlier years, have settled\r\ndown to a sedentary life in which there are few calls made upon their\r\nmuscular system. The third etiological factor is the most important.\r\nIt is due to cardiac disturbance from the stomach and intestinal\r\ntract; this will be discussed in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis.--The prognosis in cardiac neuroses is always worse in the\r\npatient's mind than it ought to be. If then the physician shows that\r\nhe is uncertain as to the real significance of the affection, some\r\nhint of this uncertainty will be communicated to the patient with\r\nresultant unfavorable suggestion. The {323} more carefully neurotic\r\nheart affections have been studied, the better the prognosis becomes.\r\nMorgagni in the olden time, Stokes and Corrigan in the early\r\nnineteenth century, Broadbent and MacKenzie in our time, have all\r\nemphasized the necessity for favorable prognosis. Even extreme\r\nirregularity is quite compatible with long life without any symptoms\r\nof serious circulatory disturbance. MacKenzie has, in his very careful\r\nstudies of heart action, shown that extra systoles may cause marked\r\nirregularity in many forms without warranting unfavorable prognosis.\r\n\r\nArrhythmia may begin in comparatively early life, persist in spite of\r\ntreatment, and yet continue up to old age. Sir William Osler tells of\r\nthe case of the late Chancellor Ferrier of McGill University who died\r\nat the age of eighty-seven after having exhibited an extremely\r\nirregular heart action for the last fifty years of his life. He has\r\nseen several other patients who have had heart irregularity for many\r\nyears without the slightest disturbance of their general health. His\r\nexperience is not uncommon, and probably every physician who sees many\r\ncases of heart disease can recall a few of them. Ten years ago I saw a\r\nman past seventy suffering from distinctly irregular heart action,\r\nthough he gave the history of having had cardiac irregularity for some\r\nyears at least, and he is still alive, past eighty, and with his heart\r\nirregularity still present. I have a patient over seventy whom I know\r\nto have had irregular heart action for fifteen years, and he himself\r\nis sure that it has been present since he was about forty, at least.\r\nIt is cases of this kind, together with MacKenzie's recent studies of\r\nthe subject, that must be before the physician's mind when he makes\r\nhis prognosis for these patients. There must be no hesitancy about his\r\ndeclaration. Patients think that physicians are prone to deny the\r\nsignificance of heart trouble so as to avoid disturbing their\r\npatients. The slightest hesitation, then, will be surely looked upon\r\nas of ominous import.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Life and Cardiac Palpitation.--It is curious how many\r\npeople who give themselves to intellectual work and live an almost\r\nexclusively indoor life have subjective symptoms relating to their\r\nhearts. Many of the English literary men and women of the last century\r\nhad complaints of this kind. Sir Walter Scott described very vividly\r\nhis sensations as if his heart did not have room to accomplish its\r\nfunctions, and said that he used to feel within his chest a fluttering\r\nas if there were a bird there beating its wings against a cage too\r\nsmall for it. Other literary people have told of this sense of\r\noverfullness in the chest, as if somehow there were not room for all\r\nthe organs. This discomfort is mainly referred to the precordial\r\nregion. In oversensitive, nervous people it may be described as\r\npainful, though analysis of what they mean by the word pain will show\r\nthat they have only a persistent feeling of pressure which is\r\nuncomfortable and gives a sense of crowdedness in that region rather\r\nthan any genuine ache. Where the feeling is much dwelt on, however, it\r\nmay be exaggerated into pain, as, indeed, will any sensation, however\r\ntrivial, if attention is concentrated on it. On the other hand, in\r\npractically all of these cases, just as soon as the mind is strongly\r\ndiverted by any pleasant occupation, the sense of discomfort\r\ndisappears not to reappear again until the patient has time to think\r\nabout himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart Surveillance.--Prof. Oppenheim of Berlin has in his usual direct\r\nway expressed the power of the mind to influence the heart beat, and\r\nhe does {324} not hesitate to say that certain nervous people who have\r\nbeen watching their hearts overmuch, and continually thinking about\r\nthem, are capable of playing all sorts of tricks on themselves and\r\nsometimes even on their physicians, by this concentration of mind upon\r\ntheir heart and its action. Prof. Oppenheim in his \"Letters to Nervous\r\nPatients,\" writing to a patient complaining of irregular heart action,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  Whenever you succeed in controlling the action of your heart by\r\n  means of introspection, there flows from your brain to your heart a\r\n  current of innervation which disturbs the automatic movement of the\r\n  organ. You now know what you have to thank for the irregularity in\r\n  the action of your heart. I have frequently proved this to myself in\r\n  your case: if I succeeded in feeling your pulse without your\r\n  becoming aware of it, holding your attention by a conversation which\r\n  interested you, the action of your heart was always absolutely\r\n  regular. If, however, I tried it under your control, while your\r\n  attention was anxiously directed to your heart, its action at once\r\n  became irregular, and you experienced the very unpleasant sensation\r\n  of palpitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrritable Heart of Athletes.--A curiously interesting form of heart\r\nneuroses has appealed to me very much because I have suffered somewhat\r\nfrom it myself and owing to circumstances I think I have seen a larger\r\nnumber of patients suffering from it than usually come to a single\r\nindividual. I refer to the tendency to irritability of the heart which\r\nis so marked in men who have been athletes when they were younger, and\r\nhave taken a large amount of exercise during the years between fifteen\r\nand twenty-five. If these men later settle down to a sedentary life\r\nthey almost inevitably suffer from a marked sense of discomfort in the\r\nprecordial region because of palpitation, and are apparently much more\r\nliable than other people to have an intermittent pulse. Just what\r\nthese symptoms are due to is not always easy to discover, and in\r\ndifferent individuals there seem to be different accessory causes at\r\nwork. I have seen it particularly in professional men who while at\r\ncollege have been on the teams and have played such hard games as\r\nhandball, hockey on the ice, and the like. I do not refer only to\r\nthose who have played an occasional game, but who every day of the\r\ncollege year have had some severe muscular exercise.\r\n\r\nWhether this irregularity of heart action has not at least been\r\npredisposed to by over-exertion remains to be determined. Strenuous\r\nathletics produce curious heart symptoms. Missed heart beats and\r\nirregular heart action and even leakages at the valves are not unusual\r\neven in the best of hearts after severe exertion. A careful\r\nexamination of the hearts of those who took part in a Marathon run at\r\nHarvard some years ago showed that immediately after the race many of\r\nthem were irregular and some of them had leakages at the mitral valve\r\nwhich lasted from one to twenty-four hours. These were probably due to\r\nirregularity in the action of the papillary muscles as a consequence\r\nof the fatigue. I had occasion to examine the hearts of some\r\ntheatrical dancers a few years ago, immediately after they came off\r\nthe stage. One of them is one of the most successful of modern dancers\r\nand is able to occupy the better part of an hour in the severest kind\r\nof exertion before an audience. Her heart was not only very rapid\r\nimmediately after she left the stage, but there were missed beats and\r\na distinct disturbance at the mitral valve. It was hard to determine\r\nabsolutely, but the sounds at all the valves were impure and there\r\n{325} seemed to be imperfect closure or irregularity of action. In\r\nanother case there was a regular missed beat at every sixth or seventh\r\npulsation. This seemed to be due to an abortive systole. Usually\r\nwithin an hour regularity of heart action is restored and the valve\r\nsounds become normal. At times when the patient is run down for any\r\nreason, the cardiac disturbance may persist for many hours, or even\r\nuntil after long hours of sleep.\r\n\r\nThe patients I have mentioned seem to have developed their muscles to\r\na noteworthy degree and have enlarged and strengthened their hearts by\r\nthis exercise. Later on their occupation in life prevents them from\r\ntaking any severe exercise, or at least furnishes no opportunity for\r\nit, and they often settle down to existence that, beyond a short,\r\nquiet walk perhaps once a day, affords no exercise at all. Under these\r\ncircumstances the muscular development that they secured as young men\r\nand which kept them in such magnificent health during their adolescent\r\nyears seems to prove a positive detriment to good health, or at least\r\nto good feeling. The muscular system seems to crave to be kept up.\r\nOccasionally I have been sure that the intermittent heart action so\r\noften seen in these cases was due to the fact that the appetite, or as\r\nI should rather put it, the habit of eating, which they formed while\r\nthey were accustomed to taking vigorous exercise, remains with them\r\nduring their sedentary life and as a consequence they overeat,\r\nparticularly of proteid food materials. The large consumption of these\r\nmaterials gives rise to the presence of substances in the blood which\r\nmake all the muscles more irritable than usual, and this seems to add\r\nparticularly to the irritability of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dietetic Regulation_.--For many of these people a regulation of diet\r\nseems to be the best possible remedy. They must be made to eat less\r\nsubstantially, since they do not need the same amount of proteid\r\nmaterial to make up for muscle waste, now that there is no longer the\r\nold use of muscles. Some of them become very heavy. These, however,\r\nare mainly individuals who, besides eating abundantly of proteids,\r\nalso consume carbohydrates in large quantities. In these there is a\r\ndistinct disturbance of digestion and a tendency to dilatation of the\r\nstomach with gas which interferes with the heart action and brings on\r\nthe intermittent pulse so often seen in them. In a certain number,\r\nhowever, there are no accessory symptoms of indigestion, but the heart\r\nsymptoms are most prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exercise_.--For these people the only real relief is afforded by a\r\ncertain amount of exercise every day. They become ever so much more\r\ncomfortable just as soon as their physician insists that they shall\r\nhave an hour's walk at least every morning and every afternoon and\r\nthat this walk shall be brisk and always have some definite purpose in\r\nit, so that there is no mere sauntering or delaying on the way. Most\r\nbusiness men to whom this prescription of an hour's walk is given will\r\nreply that it is impossible. Most clergymen will say that their duties\r\nare such that they cannot arrange their hours for this purpose. As a\r\nrule, it is not difficult to show the business man, however, that if\r\ninstead of riding to his business, he should walk every day, and this\r\nwill probably only take twenty minutes to a half-hour longer than if\r\nhe goes by trolley or even by automobile, this walk will provide him\r\nwith a full hour of brisk exercise in the open air. The walk back from\r\nbusiness will provide the other hour, whenever golf or some other\r\ndiversion cannot be provided instead. In most cities men live from\r\nthree to five miles away from their {326} business, and it is not too\r\nmuch to ask them to take this walk. The muscular clergyman must be\r\nmade to understand that there shall be no trolley cars for his\r\nordinary clerical calls, or at least that none are to be taken unless\r\nhe has had his full two hours of brisk walk.\r\n\r\nThere is always the fear in the patient's mind that exercise, by\r\ncalling for heart exertion, is almost sure to make the condition\r\nworse. This fear of itself further hampers heart action. When exercise\r\nis first increased in those who have been living sedentary lives the\r\nheart action for a time is brought more and more into the sphere of\r\nconsciousness and any irregularity that is present is likely to be\r\nemphasized. A little persistence, however, soon shows that what the\r\nheart actually was craving was the opportunity to expend some of its\r\nenergy and it was this pent-up force that was disturbing its action.\r\nThere is often the fear in physicians' minds lest the advising of\r\nexercise should really do harm to the patient. They fear the presence\r\nof perhaps a fatty condition, or of some obscure muscular condition,\r\nor of some other heart lesion not easy to detect, yet likely to\r\nproduce serious symptoms. Stokes, who probably knew fatty heart\r\ndisease better than anyone else in the nineteenth century, outlined\r\nhis views of the therapy of it as follows:\r\n\r\n  In the present state of our knowledge the adoption of the following\r\n  principles in the management of a case of incipient fatty heart\r\n  disease seems justifiable:\r\n\r\n  We must train the patient gradually but steadily to the giving up of\r\n  all luxurious habits. He must adopt early hours, and pursue a system\r\n  of graduated muscular exercises; and it will often happen that,\r\n  after perseverance in this system, the patient will be enabled to\r\n  take an amount of exercise with pleasure and advantage, which at\r\n  first was totally impossible, owing to the difficulty of breathing\r\n  which followed exertion. This treatment by muscular exercise is\r\n  obviously more proper in younger persons than in those advanced in\r\n  life. The symptoms of debility of the heart are often removable by a\r\n  regulated course of gymnastics or by pedestrian exercise, even in\r\n  mountainous countries, such as Switzerland or the Highlands of\r\n  Scotland or Ireland. We may often observe in such persons the\r\n  occurrence of what is commonly known as \"getting the second wind,\"\r\n  that is to say, during the first period of the day, the patient\r\n  suffers from dyspnea and palpitation to an extreme degree, but by\r\n  persevering, without over-exertion, or after a short rest, he can\r\n  finish his day's work and even ascend high mountains with facility.\r\n  In those advanced in life, however, as has been remarked, the\r\n  frequent complications with atheromatous disease of the aorta, and\r\n  affections of the liver and lungs must make us more cautious in\r\n  recommending the course now specified.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important therapeutic suggestion which Sir William\r\nBroadbent has to make with regard to the cardiac conditions that have\r\ncome to occupy much of the patient's attention is of a negative\r\ncharacter. He says that \"patients suffering from these functional\r\nderangements of the heart usually make them a pretext for avoiding\r\nexercise and often for taking stimulants or drugs, whereas exercise\r\nand fresh air are what they need. The best way to prevent the\r\nexpenditure of superfluous energy on the part of the heart in the form\r\nof palpitation is to give it a fair amount of legitimate physiological\r\nwork to do.\" Personally I have found that most of the cardiac tonics\r\nseem to do harm, in the sense of increasing the subjective symptoms,\r\nexcept in cases where the patient is run down in general health\r\nbecause of failure to take sufficient food, when strychnin seems to be\r\nof avail and in the shape of nux vomica acts as an appetizer as well\r\nas a heart tonic. Sir William Broadbent has warned particularly with\r\nregard to the use of alcohol in these cases. {327} Most patients find\r\nthat for the moment palpitation is lessened by alcoholic stimulation.\r\nThey pay for it afterwards, however, by an increased sense of\r\ndiscomfort that sometimes lasts for 24 hours or more. As Sir William\r\nBroadbent declared, \"To relieve one attack of palpitation or fainting\r\nby alcohol is to invite another, while the terrible danger of dropping\r\ninto alcoholism is incurred.\"\r\n\r\nLest it should be thought that even Broadbent is a little\r\nold-fashioned and not quite to be trusted in the light of our\r\npresent-day knowledge, and above all lest it might be feared that\r\nthese older men made a better prognosis or emphasized the value of\r\nexercise more than is compatible with our recent discoveries in the\r\nphysiology and pathology of the heart, it seems well to give\r\nMacKenzie's opinion of these cases in full. This is all the more\r\nimportant because, as I have said, the influence of German teaching\r\nhas led to the formation of rather different opinions in America,\r\nespecially among our younger physicians. Prof. Martius in this country\r\nin his lecture for the Harvey Society gave quite a serious prognosis\r\nfor practically all heart irregularity. He almost went so far as to\r\nlay it down as a rule of diagnosis that whenever a heart beats\r\nirregularly there is something the matter with the heart muscle or\r\ngood reason to suspect a myocardial lesion of some kind. MacKenzie's\r\nview is very different to this and he warns particularly against\r\npermitting the influence of an unfavorable attitude of mind on the\r\npart of these patients. He says:\r\n\r\n  The most serious thing about these cases is that the consciousness\r\n  of having an irregularity sometimes makes a patient introspective\r\n  and depressed. He keeps feeling his pulse, and communicates his\r\n  doleful tale whenever he find a sympathetic ear.\r\n\r\n  As the process which gives rise to it in elderly people is the same\r\n  as that which produces the tortuous temporal arteries, no more\r\n  significance should be attached to the one symptom than to the\r\n  other. I have followed cases for many years, and watched them pass\r\n  through seasons of sickness and of stress, and have seen no reason\r\n  to attach any serious import to this symptom. In rare instances the\r\n  heart, from being occasionally irregular, has after many years\r\n  become continuously irregular for short or long periods, and in a\r\n  few the permanent establishment of the nodal rhythm has been the\r\n  means of hastening the end. But this is infrequent, and in cases of\r\n  cardio-sclerosis has only happened in advanced life, and the patient\r\n  should on no account be frightened by being warned of the possible\r\n  occurrence of this unlikely contingency. In younger and neurotic\r\n  people I have never seen it lead to any bad results. It may appear\r\n  in serious affections of the heart, as in febrile complaints, but it\r\n  does not of itself add to the gravity of the condition, though I am\r\n  not sure that when due to an acute infection of the heart, as in\r\n  pneumonia and rheumatic fever, it may not be a sign of invasion of\r\n  the myocardium by the diseased process.\r\n\r\n  If the patient is aware of the irregularity, he should be assured\r\n  that there is no cause for alarm. It is useless to attempt to treat\r\n  the irregularity itself. If in other respects the patient is well,\r\n  then there is no need of any special treatment. If the patient be\r\n  suffering from conditions which seem to promote irregularity, such\r\n  as worry, fatigue, dyspepsia, the treatment should be devoted to the\r\n  removal of the predisposing cause. In people with temporary high\r\n  blood pressure, who show extra systoles, I find plenty of healthy\r\n  exercise in the open air specially beneficial, though until they get\r\n  trained, the extra systoles may at times become more frequent by the\r\n  exertion.\r\n\r\nThis last remark of MacKenzie's is particularly important, for at the\r\nbeginning of an attempt to relieve the symptoms by insisting on more\r\n{328} exercise, the patient is almost sure to be disturbed by this\r\nsymptom of which he will often be conscious, and it takes a good deal\r\nof experience on the part of the physician to reassure him that\r\nbecause of the increased subjective symptoms at the beginning of the\r\ntreatment by increased exertion, he may not be doing harm rather than\r\ngood. As a rule, however, it is not long before the good results of\r\nthe exercise treatment of these cases begin to make themselves felt\r\nand the patient is reassured. Regulated exercise of body and\r\noccupation of mind are the two important factors even in the treatment\r\nof organic heart disease. They are extremely important even in the\r\ncases with alarming heart symptoms that occur in the very old, once\r\nthe acute symptoms have subsided. In all the functional heart\r\naffections exercise is the most important therapeutic resource we\r\nhave. It would seem that in the course of muscular exercise some heart\r\ntonic was manufactured, which in all but the cases of absolutely\r\nfailing hearts is the best possible therapeutic resource for the\r\nstimulation and steadying of the heart action. Such an internal\r\nsecretion would not be surprising in the light of all that we have\r\nlearned of the physiological nexus of organs in recent years.\r\n\r\nMany so-called cures for heart disease probably depend for their good\r\neffect much more on the graduated exercise that goes with them than on\r\nmany of the other remedial measures, though it is these latter that\r\nare usually vaunted most highly. We all now recognize how little value\r\nthere is in the Nauheim bath treatment for heart disease away from\r\nNauheim itself. The reason is because the resisted movements of the\r\nearly part of the cure and, above all, the graduated exercise of\r\nwalking up the hills around Nauheim, which are such important parts of\r\nthe treatment there, cannot be so well given with the baths at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCARDIAC PALPITATION AND GASTRO-INTESTINAL DISTURBANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgagni, whom Virchow greeted as the Father of Modern Pathology, made\r\na careful study of the pulse and especially of its irregularities. He\r\nhad learned from the most careful pathological studies that marked\r\nintermission and even more decided irregularity of the heart may be\r\npresent in life, though there may be absolutely no organic affection\r\nof the heart itself, either of the valves or of the muscle,\r\ndiscoverable at autopsy. In his opinion the most frequent cause for\r\nsuch irregularity is flatulency and disturbance of digestion\r\ngenerally. He went still farther, however, and seems to have\r\nunderstood very well that constipation was often one of the most\r\nimportant links in the chain of causes leading up to such heart\r\ndisturbance, itself either a cause or an effect of other digestive\r\nsymptoms. This idea deserves to be borne in mind when there is\r\nquestion of the significance of heart symptoms. What Morgagni thus\r\ndetermined by precise studies in pathological anatomy had been\r\nclinically observed by many of the distinguished old-time\r\npractitioners of medicine, who knew the fatal tendencies of organic\r\nheart symptoms, yet recognized that many cardiac cases associated with\r\ngastric symptoms did not have an unfavorable prognosis.\r\n\r\n{329}\r\n\r\nIn spite of the recognition of these conditions by old-time medical\r\ninvestigators, there has always been a tendency to fear that heart\r\nsymptoms in these cases might be due to a cardiac affection. This has\r\ninvariably been true for patients themselves to whom the heart\r\ndisturbance became conscious, but has often made physicians hesitate\r\nas to the diagnosis and rendered their prognosis more unfavorable than\r\nis justified by actual knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGastro Cardiac Arrhythmia.--What may be called the gastro-intestinal\r\ncardiac neuroses usually run a typical course. As a rule, with young\r\nfolks, the beginning of cardiac unrest is found in some stomachic\r\nsymptoms. The distention of the stomach with gas is said to be a\r\nmechanical reason for interference with the heart action. Whether this\r\nis really gas that has formed within the stomach, or whether it is to\r\na great extent, at least, gas which has been diffused from the vessels\r\nof the stomach walls in a disordered viscus, or in some cases at\r\nleast, air which has been swallowed because of certain gaspy habits of\r\nneurotic individuals, is hard to determine. In many cases the absence\r\nof all odor of decomposition, or of any disagreeable taste, makes for\r\nserious doubt whether the substance is really due to fermentation.\r\nCertainly the changes that take place in food in the stomach during\r\nthe course of an hour or two of digestion are not sufficient to\r\naccount for the volume of gas that exerts pressure upon the gastric\r\nwalls and is eructated in large mouthfuls. Fermentative processes are\r\nslow gas producers, as anyone with experience in the chemical\r\nlaboratory knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Cardiac Interference_.--Every physician has seen the young\r\nman who is sure that he has heart trouble when he is really suffering\r\nfrom indigestion. Many of the feelings of discomfort accompanied by\r\npalpitation and irregularity are really phenomena connected rather\r\nwith the stomach than the heart itself. The reason for this is not\r\nalways clear. In many cases there seems to be a mechanical\r\ninterference with the heart's action. This is due to the presence of\r\ngas in the stomach pressing against the diaphragm. In many cases the\r\ndistention of the stomach by a heavy meal, especially if the heart has\r\nbeen rendered sensitive by the taking of stimulants, will have the\r\nsame effect. This is particularly noticeable if the patients lie down\r\nshortly after the meal, when there is distinct discomfort in the\r\ncardiac region and noticeable irregularity of the pulse.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent phenomenon is a missed beat, or often simply a sense\r\nof discomfort in connection with the heart action that makes its\r\nbeating very noticeable. This palpitation, as it is called, is usually\r\nentirely subjective. There is nothing abnormal in the sensation\r\nproduced on the hand when the heart is palpated, nothing the most\r\ndelicate finger can detect in the apex beat and nothing uniform in the\r\nchange in the heart sounds produced in these cases. There is usually a\r\nsomewhat over-excited action of the heart, but this is not\r\ncharacteristically revealed by either palpation or auscultation. The\r\nrhythm is interfered with, but the arrythmia affects only an\r\noccasional beat, usually rather regularly spaced, and does not\r\ninterfere with the heart's rate nor with its action in any way. This\r\nrepresents the most familiar form of cardiac neurosis and may, of\r\ncourse, be due to such substances as tobacco, or coffee, or tea, where\r\nthese are taken in excess. Excess is always a matter of individual\r\nidiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\n{330}\r\n\r\n_Cardiac Reflexes_.--It is thought by some that this heart\r\nirregularity and palpitation is a reflex action due to irritation of\r\nthe gastric terminal filaments of the vagus nerve reflected back along\r\nthis nerve and affecting the heart. The doctrine of reflexes is not as\r\npopular, however, as it was, but there can be no doubt of the fact\r\nthat the vagus nerve has terminal filaments in all the large organs,\r\nyet is so extremely important to the heart that it has a definite\r\nphysiological meaning and doubtless is meant to act in such a way as\r\nto stimulate the heart when these important organs are overloaded or\r\nare laboring in their functions, and, on the other hand, to depress it\r\nor at least to inhibit it somewhat, whenever there is a tendency to\r\nsend too much blood to these parts. In any case, whether the positive\r\nfactor in the production of the heart trouble be mechanical, as it\r\nsurely often is, or whether it be reflex and due to the action upon\r\nthe vagus, it must not be forgotten that in all cases where heart\r\nsymptoms occur with considerable intervals of absolute freedom from\r\nthem and with large subjective elements in the case, the relation of\r\nthe stomach or the digestive organs in general to the heart may serve\r\nas their best explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gastric Dilatation_.--In dilatation of the stomach there is likely to\r\nbe an associated tendency to a cardiac neurosis. Unfortunately, enough\r\nof these cases have not been followed up so as to be sure what the\r\noutcome is and whether there may not really have been some affection\r\nof the myocardium with a premature breakdown of the heart. As a\r\nconsequence of the excessive irritation of the terminal filaments of\r\nthe vagus nerve in the stomach wall, or because of the mechanical\r\ninterference with the heart's action as a consequence of the dilated\r\nstomach pulling upon the esophagus and probably somewhat interfering\r\nwith the action of the diaphragm, an irregularity of the heart action\r\nis established and a sense of discomfort in the precordia develops\r\nthat is often very marked. These patients sometimes suffer from\r\npseudo-angina and still more frequently from cardiac irregularity.\r\nThis cardiac irregularity is sometimes quite marked, and yet in 24\r\nhours, as a consequence of the emptying of the stomach, will\r\ndisappear, so that only slight intermittency remains, which eventually\r\nsubsides. I have known a heart affected thus to be pronounced\r\nabsolutely without any lesion when examined by a competent heart\r\nspecialist within a month after it had been so irregular as to be\r\nquite alarming to both patient and physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upward Distention_.--There is sometimes a tendency for the stomach to\r\ndistend upward rather than to dilate downward and toward the left.\r\nPerhaps this is due to the fact that in certain individuals the\r\ngastric ligaments are much stronger and more unyielding than they are\r\nin others. One thing is sure--that there are great individual\r\ndifferences in these cases. In some that are without any demonstrable\r\ngastric dilatation, except that gastric tympany extends higher than\r\nusual, there is marked interference with the heart action. The\r\nphysician needs to see these cases when they are so irregular that\r\nthere would seem to be absolutely no doubt of the existence of a\r\nmyocardial lesion and then to examine them some months afterwards when\r\nthe stomach had been restored to good conditions, before he is able to\r\nrealize how much interference with heart action is consonant with\r\ncomplete return in a comparatively short time to the normal, at least\r\nso far as heart function goes. This is a very different opinion from\r\nthat held by many heart specialists and {331} especially certain\r\nGerman authorities, who insist that any irregularity of the heart must\r\nbe considered as probably representing a muscular lesion; but the\r\nevidence of careful observers may be adduced in support of it, and it\r\nis an opinion that very much reassures the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld-time Clinicians--Morgagni, Lancisi.--In this subject it has always\r\nseemed to me wise to recur to the opinions of some of the old-time\r\nclinicians who noted symptoms very carefully and studied out\r\nparticularly the connection of symptoms with prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morgagni_.--Morgagni, for instance, whose clinical remarks are always\r\nprecious, said:\r\n\r\n  Now that mention is made of the intermission of the pulse which\r\n  approaches more nearly to the nature of an asphyxia than even its\r\n  slenderness or weakness (for what else is the intermission of the\r\n  pulse but a very short asphyxia, or what is an asphyxia but an\r\n  intermission which lasts very long?) the causes of this disorder in\r\n  the pulse are not to be passed over without examination in this\r\n  place, as the greater part of physicians are very greatly terrified\r\n  thereby, often with good reason, yet frequently without any; as when\r\n  there is some cause of it in the stomach or intestines, which may\r\n  even vanish away of itself, or be easily removed by the physician.\r\n  For in what manner a palpitation of the heart may sometimes be\r\n  brought on by flatus distending these parts, and again carried off\r\n  by the dissipation of such flatus, I have already said; and in the\r\n  same manner, or one not very dissimilar, it is also evident, that an\r\n  intermission of the pulse has sometimes generated, and gone off of\r\n  itself, in many whom I have known. At another time, in these very\r\n  same viscera, there is a matter which produces the same effect, by\r\n  irritating their nerves, with which you know how easily the nerves\r\n  of the heart consent. And this matter is sometimes of such a nature\r\n  that it may readily be prevented from harboring itself there. Thus I\r\n  remember, when I attended to the cure of a young girl who had a\r\n  fever, and an intermission of the pulse was added to the other\r\n  symptoms contrary to my expectations, I was not at all deterred from\r\n  giving such a medicine as I had before determined upon, that the\r\n  stomach and intestines might be well cleansed; and even that I gave\r\n  it so much the more boldly; and that on the same day after these\r\n  parts had been deterged, the pulse returned to its former standard.\r\n  But you will read even in the _Sepulchretum_ that Ballonius had not\r\n  only seen this disorder of the pulse, but also that of a languid and\r\n  small stroke, removed in the same manner. \"According to the degrees\r\n  to which the purging was carried,\" says he, \"the pulse was\r\n  restored.\" And, indeed, there is an intermission of the pulse, that\r\n  is of a far longer continuance as that with which Lancisi says he\r\n  had been troubled \"for the space of six years\"; yet if this\r\n  intermission should be, as it was in him, \"from a consent with the\r\n  hypochondria,\" it may be entirely and perfectly taken away, by\r\n  perfectly restoring those parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lancisi_.--Lancisi was another distinguished clinical observer who\r\nmade special studies in neurotic heart disturbance. These studies are\r\nall the more interesting because he himself was a sufferer from this\r\naffection for many years. He was inclined to think that his heart\r\nintermittency was due to disturbance in his digestive organs and\r\nespecially those lying in the upper part of the abdomen. He attributes\r\nit himself to sympathy with these and said that it came _ex\r\nhypochondriorum consensu_, as it were a reflex from his hypochondriac\r\nregions. As Lancisi lived to a pretty good age in spite of noting this\r\nsymptom in early middle life, the significance of it will be well\r\nunderstood. It would be perfectly possible to gather a series of such\r\ncases from among the distinguished physicians of history, and as for\r\nour contemporaries and colleagues, at least one out of four of them\r\nwill tell you that at some time he has suffered from an affection of\r\nthis kind and has been much worried {332} about it, yet has recovered\r\nwithout incident and without any serious development.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Opinion.--The role of the stomach in disturbing the heart is\r\nonly less important than that of the nervous system itself. Of course,\r\nindividual peculiarities, as I have said, are extremely important.\r\nSome people seem to suffer very little cardiac disturbance from a\r\ndistended stomach, while in others all sorts of heart affections may\r\nbe simulated as the result of the mechanical interference with the\r\nheart action by the pushing up of the diaphragm. Sir William Broadbent\r\nin the article on \"The Conduct of the Heart in the Face of\r\nDifficulties,\" already quoted from, does not hesitate to say that\r\nheart symptoms secondary to gastric disturbance probably cause more\r\nsuffering than does actual heart disease. Expressions of this kind\r\nneed to be borne in mind when we reassure patients who have all sorts\r\nof queer, uncomfortable, often even painful, conditions in their\r\ncardiac region, \"Heart disease\" has been, perhaps, mentioned casually\r\nto them and as a consequence worry is adding a nervous element to\r\nhamper a heart already seriously disturbed by gastric distention. Sir\r\nWilliam Broadbent's own words are given because they carry so much\r\nweight in this matter:\r\n\r\n  The difficulties arising out of flatulent distention of the stomach\r\n  or colon or intestinal canal generally, will require some attention,\r\n  since they are the cause of most of the functional derangements to\r\n  which the heart is subject, and give rise to the heart complaints\r\n  which occasion in the aggregate perhaps more suffering than does\r\n  actual heart disease. The heart often tolerates a considerable\r\n  degree of upward pressure of the diaphragm, and it is not uncommon\r\n  to meet with stomach resonance as high as the fifth space, and to\r\n  find the apex beat displaced upwards and outwards to the fourth\r\n  space and outside the nipple line, without conspicuous symptoms. But\r\n  the heart behaves very differently in different subjects in the\r\n  presence of flatulent distention of the stomach. It partakes of the\r\n  general constitutional condition of the individual; in the strong,\r\n  therefore, it is vigorous; in the weak it cannot be anything but\r\n  weak.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis.--Nothing sends a young person sooner to a physician than\r\nthis cardiac unrest and functional disturbance. He comes all\r\na-tremble, as if to hear the worst. Even in middle age and in those\r\nwhose education might be expected to steady them somewhat in the\r\nmatter, even in physicians of long experience, there is a tendency so\r\nto exaggerate the condition and its possibilities of fatality as a\r\nconsequence of emotion that inhibitory action on the heart becomes\r\nnoticeable. It is a rule with very few exceptions that in these cases\r\nwhen the heart is complained of by young persons who have no history\r\nof rheumatism, the causative condition will be found in the stomach,\r\nor at least in the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nI know a number of physicians who have suffered in this way and who\r\nhave been badly frightened about themselves, yet who have had no\r\nserious difficulty once they took reasonable care of their diet, and\r\npaid attention above all to regularity of meals and slowness in\r\neating. Indeed, it is rare to find a physician of a nervous\r\ntemperament who has not had some trouble of this kind, and the demands\r\nmade on a busy professional man foster this. Some of them are sure\r\nthat if their cardiac uneasiness does not signify an actual heart\r\nlesion, valvular or muscular, at least it portends a premature wearing\r\nout of the heart. There are many evidences to show that this is {333}\r\nnot so. I have had a distinguished physician, now well past his\r\nseventy-fifth year, tell me of distinct irregularity in his heart\r\naction as a young man which had rather alarmed him, and as this had\r\nbeen preceded by an attack of acute articular rheumatism there seemed\r\nto be every reason to think that he was a sufferer not from functional\r\nbut from organic heart disease; yet he has lived well beyond the span\r\nof life usually allotted to man, has accomplished an immense amount of\r\nwork and is now in excellent general health almost at the age of\r\neighty. The case is all the more striking because, while rest and care\r\nof the health and regular life and conservation of energy are usually\r\nsupposed to be essential for these cases, this colleague is noted for\r\nhaving made serious inroads on the hours which should have been\r\ndevoted to sleep in order to accomplish certain medical literary work\r\nwhile devoting himself to the care of a most exacting practice.\r\n\r\nThat the good prognosis of these cases which I suggest is not forced\r\nand is not over-favorable nor the result of the wish to soothe\r\npatients may be judged from recent studies of the heart as well as\r\nfrom the older ones. In discussing extra-systole, MacKenzie in his\r\n\"Diseases of the Heart,\" [Footnote 28] says:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 28: \"Diseases of the Heart,\" by James MacKenzie, M. D.,\r\n  1910, Oxford Medical Publications.]\r\n\r\n  Dyspeptic and neurotic people are often liable [to suffer from\r\n  them]. That other conditions give rise to extra-systoles, is also\r\n  evident from the fact that they may occur in young people in whom\r\n  there is no rheumatic history and no cardiosclerosis and whose\r\n  after-history reveals no sign of heart trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is well to note the frequency of such annoying symptoms in those\r\nwho have gone through rheumatic fever, and where patients have a\r\nhistory of this it is well to be cautious, but even in these cases he\r\nsays that the trouble is often entirely neurotic and the one important\r\npreliminary to any successful treatment is to get the patient's mind\r\noff his condition, improve his general nervous state, and above all\r\nrelieve as far as possible the gastric symptoms that may be present.\r\n\r\nHe says further:\r\n\r\n  Some patients are conscious of a quiet transient fluttering in the\r\n  chest when an extra-systole occurs; others are aware of the long\r\n  pause, \"as if their hearts had stopped\"; while others are conscious\r\n  of the big beat that frequently follows the long pause. So violent\r\n  is the effect of this after-beat, that in neurotic persons it may\r\n  cause a shock, followed by a sense of great exhaustion. Most\r\n  patients are unconscious of the irregularity due to the\r\n  extra-systole until their attention is called to it by the medical\r\n  attendant. Both being ignorant of its origin, and its being\r\n  characteristic of human nature to associate the unknown with evil,\r\n  patient and doctor are too often unnecessarily alarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac Stomach Disturbance.--On the other hand, as a word of warning,\r\nit seems necessary to say here that later in life acute conditions\r\nmanifesting themselves through the stomach are often of cardiac\r\norigin. Most physicians have been called to see some old man who had\r\npartaken of a favorite dish which did not, however, always agree with\r\nhim and who suffered as a consequence from what at first was thought\r\nto be acute gastritis. The severity of the symptoms and the almost\r\nimmediate collapse without any question of ptomaine poisoning,\r\nhowever, usually make it clear that some other organ is at {334} fault\r\nbesides the stomach itself. The real etiological train seems to be\r\nthat a weakened heart sometimes without any valve lesion but with a\r\nmuscular or vascular degeneration hampering its activity is further\r\nseriously disturbed by the overloading of the stomach. The result is a\r\nfailure for the moment of circulation in the digestive organs with\r\nconsequent rejection of the contents of the tract, nature's method of\r\nrelieving herself of substances that cannot be properly prepared for\r\nabsorption. Unfortunately, the condition sometimes proves so severe a\r\nshock to the weakened heart that it stops beating, and the physician\r\nis brought face to face with a death from \"heart failure.\"\r\n\r\nIn these cases it is important to remember that the gastric\r\ndisturbance may so mask the heart symptoms as completely to deceive\r\nthe physician. The prognosis of these cases, however, is most serious.\r\nIt seems worth while to give a warning with regard to these cases,\r\nbecause anything that we may have to say as to the relations of the\r\nstomach and the heart and the possibility of lessening the cardiac\r\ndepression due to unfavorable mental influence when palpitation occurs\r\nas a consequence of gastric distention, has nothing to do with these\r\nacute cases in older patients where the condition is serious and the\r\nprognosis by no means favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The role of psychotherapy in this form of cardiac\r\ndisturbance associated with gastro-intestinal affections is, after the\r\ndifferentiation of neurotic from serious organic conditions, to give\r\nthe patient such reassurance as is justified by his condition. It is\r\nsurprising how many people are worrying about their hearts because\r\ntheir stomachic and intestinal conditions give rise to heart\r\npalpitation, that is to such action of the heart as brings it into the\r\nsphere of their consciousness, sometimes with the complication of\r\nintermittency or even more marked irregularity. The less the\r\nexperience of the physician the more serious is he likely to consider\r\nthese conditions and the more likely he is to disturb the patient by\r\nhis diagnosis and prognosis. Until there is some sign of failing\r\ncirculation, or of beginning disturbance of compensation, the\r\nattachment of a serious significance to these conditions always makes\r\npatients worse and removes one of the most helpful forms of\r\ntherapeusis, that of the favorable influence of the mind on the heart.\r\nOn the other hand, unless the patients' own unfavorable\r\nauto-suggestions as regards the significance of their heart symptoms\r\nare corrected, these people not only suffer subjectively, but bring\r\nabout such disturbance of their physical condition as makes many\r\nsymptoms objective.\r\n\r\nWhile there are serious affections in which heart and stomach are\r\nclosely associated, these are quite rare and usually manifest\r\nthemselves in acute conditions and in old people. In the chapter on\r\nAngina Pectoris attention is called to the fact that there are may\r\nforms of pseudo-angina due to cardiac neuroses consequent upon gastric\r\ndisturbance and without heart lesion. Broadbent has not hesitated to\r\nsay that these forms of angina cause more suffering or at least\r\nproduce more reaction on the part of the patient and are always the\r\nsource of more complaint than the paroxysms due to serious cardiac\r\nconditions which present the constant possibility of a fatal\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nWhere the stomach is the cause of the cardiac neuroses psychotherapy\r\nis an extremely important element in the treatment. The continuance\r\nand exaggeration of their symptoms is often due to a disturbance of\r\nmind consequent upon the feeling that they have some serious form of\r\nheart disease. Without {335} definite reassurance in this matter all\r\nthe experts in heart disease insist that it is extremely difficult to\r\nbring about relief of symptoms in these patients. Whenever the general\r\nhealth of the individual has not suffered from his heart affection, it\r\nis quite safe to assume that no organic disease of the heart is\r\npresent, no matter what the symptoms, for, as Broadbent and many other\r\nauthorities emphasize, gastric cardiac neuroses can simulate every\r\nform of heart disturbance. The older physicians insisted that what\r\nthey called sympathy with the hypochondriac organs might produce all\r\nsorts of heart symptoms. The patient must be told this confidently.\r\nThe slightest exaggeration of the significance of his symptoms can do\r\nno possible good and will always do positive harm.\r\n\r\nAfter reassurance, the most important thing is, of course, regulation\r\nof the diet and of the digestive functions generally. Unfortunately,\r\nregulation of the diet to many patients and even to many physicians\r\nseems to mean the limitation of diet. I have seen sufferers from\r\ncardiac symptoms have these increased by excessive limitation of diet.\r\nIf they are lower than they ought to be in weight they must be made to\r\nregain it. Above all, there must be no limitation of meat-eating\r\nexcept in the robust. Very often the heart seems to crave particularly\r\nthat form of nutrition that comes through meat. It is especially\r\nimportant that the bowels should be regular. Fast eating is very\r\nharmful. Occupation with serious business immediately after eating is\r\nalmost the rule in these cases.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements of the case need special study in each\r\nindividual patient. The needed suggestions can then be made. Above\r\nall, the patient is made to realize that his case is understood and\r\nthat it is only the question of a gradual acquirement of certain\r\nhabits, including proper exercise, that is needed for the restoration\r\nof his heart to normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANGINA PECTORIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two forms of this affection, known commonly as true and false\r\nangina, are characterized by pain or anguish in the precordial region\r\nwith reflected pains in other portions of the body. It used to be said\r\nthat whenever the precordial pain was accompanied by reflected pains\r\nin the neck, or down the arm, or, as they may be occasionally, in the\r\njaw, in the ovary, in the testicle, sometimes apparently in the left\r\nloin, this was true angina and the patient was in serious danger of\r\ndeath. We know now that false angina may be accompanied by various\r\nreflex pains and that, indeed, a detailed description of the anguish\r\nand its many points of manifestation is more likely to be given by a\r\nneurotic patient suffering from pseudo-angina than by one suffering\r\nfrom true angina. True angina occurs in most cases as a consequence of\r\nhardening of the arteries of the heart or of some valvular lesion that\r\ninterferes in some way with cardiac nutrition. The definite sign of\r\ndifferentiation is that in practically all cases of true angina, there\r\nare signs of arterial degeneration in various parts of the body.\r\nWithout these, the \"breast pang,\" as the English {336} call it, is\r\nlikely to be neurotic and is of little significance as regards future\r\nhealth or its effect upon the individual's length of life.\r\n\r\nBesides the physical pain that accompanies this affection there is, as\r\nwas pointed out by Latham, a profound sense of impending death. It\r\nused to be said that this was characteristic of the organic lesions\r\ncausing true angina pectoris. It is now well known, however, that the\r\nsame feeling or such a good imitation of it that it is practically\r\nimpossible to recognize the true from the false, occurs in\r\npseudo-angina. It is this special element in these cases that needs\r\nmost to be treated by psychotherapy and which, indeed, can only be\r\nreached in this way. Where there are no signs of arterial degeneration\r\nand no significant murmurs in the heart, it should be made clear to\r\nthese patients that they are not suffering from a fatal disease, but\r\nonly from a bothersome nervous manifestation. Especially can this\r\nreassurance be given if the angina occurs in connection with\r\ndistention of the stomach or in association with gastric symptoms of\r\nany kind. In young patients who are run down in health and above all\r\nin young women, the subjective symptoms of angina--the physical\r\nanguish and the sense of impending death--are all without serious\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential Diagnosis of True and False Angina.--In the diagnosis of\r\nangina pectoris the main difficulty, of course, lies in the\r\ndifferentiation between the true and false forms, that is, those\r\ndependent on an organic affection of the heart muscle or blood vessels\r\nand those resulting from a neurosis. The neurotic form is not uncommon\r\nin young people and is often due to a toxic condition. Coffee is\r\nprobably one of the most frequent causes of spurious angina, though\r\nthe discomfort it produces is likely to be mild compared with the\r\ngenuine heart pang. It must not be forgotten, however, that neurotic\r\npatients exaggerate their pains and describe their distress in the\r\nheart region as extremely severe and as producing a sense of impending\r\ndeath, when all they mean is that, because the pain is near their\r\nheart it produces an extreme solicitude and that a dread of death\r\ncomes over them because of this anxiety. Coffee and tea, especially\r\nwhen taken strong and in the quantities in which they are sometimes\r\nindulged in, may be sources of similar distress. Tobacco will do the\r\nsame thing in susceptible individuals, or where there is a family\r\nidiosyncrasy, and especially in young persons.\r\n\r\nFor the differentiation of true and spurious angina Huchard's table as\r\ngiven by Osler is valuable:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUE ANGINA\r\n\r\nMost common between the ages of forty and fifty years.\r\n\r\nMore common in men. Attacks brought on by exertion.\r\n\r\nAttacks rarely periodical or nocturnal.\r\n\r\nNot associated with other symptoms.\r\n\r\nVaso-motor form rare. Agonizing pain and sensation of compression\r\nby a vice.\r\n\r\nPain of short duration. Attitude: silence, immobility.\r\n\r\nLesions. Sclerosis of coronary artery.\r\n\r\nPrognosis: grave, often fatal.\r\n\r\nArterial medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUROTIC FORM\r\n\r\nAt every age, even six years.\r\n\r\nMore common in women. Attacks spontaneous.\r\n\r\nOften periodical and nocturnal.\r\n\r\nAssociated with nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\nVaso-motor form common. Pain less severe; sensation of distention.\r\n\r\nPain lasts one or two hours. Agitation and activity.\r\n\r\nNeuralgia of nerves and cardioplexus.\r\n\r\nNever fatal.\r\n\r\nAntineuralgic medication.\r\n\r\n\r\n{337}\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Angina and Psychotherapy.--One of the most frequent occasions for\r\nthe development of true angina is vehement emotion. The place of\r\npsychotherapy then in the affection will at once be recognized. A\r\nclassical example of the influence of the mind and the emotions in the\r\nproduction of attacks of angina pectoris in those who are predisposed\r\nto them by a pre-existing pathological condition, is the case of the\r\nfamous John Hunter. He was attacked by a fatal paroxysm of the\r\naffection in the board room of St. Thomas' Hospital, London, when he\r\nwas about to begin an angry reply with regard to some matter\r\nconcerning the medical regulation of the hospital. He had previously\r\nrecognized how amenable he was to attacks of the disease as a\r\nconsequence of emotion or excitement, and had even stated to friends\r\nthat he was at the mercy of any scoundrel who threw him into an attack\r\nof anger. Some of the deaths from fright or sorrow at a sudden\r\nannouncement of the death of a relative, or even the deaths from joy\r\nare due to angina pectoris precipitated by the serious strain put upon\r\nthe heart by the flood of terror or emotion.\r\n\r\nMen who are sufferers from what seems to be true angina pectoris must\r\nbe made to understand without disturbing them any more than is\r\nabsolutely necessary that strong emotions of any kind--worry, anger,\r\nexhibitions of temper, and, above all, family quarrels, must be\r\navoided. Not a few of the serious attacks of angina pectoris which\r\nphysicians see come as a consequence of family jars, owing to the\r\npersistence of a son or daughter in a course offensive to the parent.\r\nA part of the prophylaxis, then, consists in impressing this fact on\r\nmembers of the family and making them understand the danger. The\r\ndisposition that causes the family friction is, however, often\r\nhereditary and will, therefore, prove difficult of control. It is one\r\nof the typical cases of inheritance of defeats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Solicitude and Prognosis_.--The distinguished French neurologist,\r\nCharcot, had several attacks of what seemed to be true angina\r\npectoris. His friends were much disturbed by it. Physicians who saw\r\nhim during the attack feared that he was suffering from an incurable\r\nheart lesion. He himself, as his son, Dr. Charcot, told me, refused to\r\naccept this diagnosis, and preferred to believe that what he was\r\nsuffering from was a cardiac neurosis--and, of course, he had seen\r\nmany of them. He was unwilling to have a heart specialist examine him\r\nvery carefully for he did not wish to be persuaded of the worst\r\naspects of his condition.\r\n\r\nWhat he said in effect was, \"This is either a neurotic condition, as I\r\nthink it is, or it is an organic condition. If it is organic, my\r\nphysicians would be apt to tell me that I must stop working so hard,\r\nand I am sure that if I should do that I would do myself more harm\r\nthan good by having unoccupied {338} time on my hands. I want to go on\r\ndoing my work. If I am wrong some time I shall be carried off in one\r\nof these attacks. That will not be such a serious thing, for after all\r\nI must die some time and my expectancy of life cannot normally be very\r\nlong. I prefer, then, to go on with my work and think the best, for it\r\ndoes not seem that I could do anything that would put off the\r\ninevitably fatal issue if I am to die a cardiac death.\" He was found\r\ndead one morning, but he had passed into the valley of death without\r\nbeing seriously disturbed and without any of the neurotic symptoms\r\nthat so often develop in discouraged patients. Curiously enough, one\r\nof our most distinguished heart specialists in this country went\r\nthrough almost the same experience and preferred to live \"the brief\r\nactive life of the salmon rather than the long slow life of the\r\ntortoise.\"\r\n\r\nThe best possible factor in therapy is secured if patients can be\r\nbrought to the state of mind of these distinguished physicians who\r\ncalmly faced the future, refusing to disturb themselves or their work,\r\nbecause they feared that the worry that would come down upon them in\r\ninactivity would aggravate their disease. Where men are occupied with\r\nsome not too exacting occupation, that takes most of their attention\r\nand at which they have been for years, it is best to leave them at it,\r\nthough the harder demands of it must be modified. If they can be\r\nbrought to persuade themselves, as did the two physicians--though\r\nprobably only half-heartedly--that their affections may possibly be\r\nmerely neurotic and not true angina, it will always be better for\r\nthem. Death may come, and commonly will, suddenly, but, after one has\r\nlived a reasonably full life, that is rather a blessing (and not in\r\ndisguise) than the terror which it is sometimes supposed to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudo-Angina.--The neurotic form of angina is quite compatible, not\r\nonly with continued good health but with long life, and even after a\r\nlong series of attacks, some of them very disturbing in their apparent\r\nseverity, there may be complete relief for years, or for the rest of\r\nlife. Exaggeration of feeling due to concentration of attention plays\r\na large role in these cases, and it is evident that the dread of\r\nsomething the matter with the heart connected with even a slight sense\r\nof discomfort may readily become so emphasized as to seem severe pain,\r\nthough many people have similar feelings without making any complaint.\r\n\r\nIn spite of reassurances attacks of pseudo-angina are likely to worry\r\nboth patient and physician. The only working rule is that in younger\r\npeople discomfort in the heart region, even though it may be\r\naccompanied by some sympathetic pain in the arm or in the left side of\r\nthe neck, is usually spurious angina. Broadbent goes so far as to say\r\nthat this is true also in many older persons. His method of making the\r\ndifferentiation is interesting because so easy and practical that it\r\ndeserves to be condensed here. The earlier attacks of true angina are\r\npractically always provoked by exertion, while spurious angina is\r\nespecially liable to come on during repose. Any cardiac symptom or\r\npain that can be walked off may be set down as functional and due to\r\nsome outside disturbing influence, or to nervous irritability. When\r\npalpitation or irregular action of the heart, or intermission of the\r\npulse, or pain in the cardiac region, or a sense of oppression follows\r\ncertain meals at a given interval, or comes on at a certain hour\r\nduring the night, there need be little hesitation in attributing the\r\ndisturbance, whatever it may be, to indigestion in {339} some of its\r\nforms. Nightmare from indigestion, Broadbent thought, is not a bad\r\nimitation of true angina.\r\n\r\nIn Broadbent's mind acute consciousness of any heart disturbance lays\r\nit in general under the suspicion of being neurotic in origin. He was\r\ntalking to some of the best clinical practitioners in the world and\r\nsome of the most careful observers of our generation, when, before the\r\nLondon Medical Society, he said: \"The intermission of the pulse of\r\nwhich the patient is conscious and the irregularity of the heart's\r\naction--though this can be said with less confidence--which the\r\npatient feels very much, is usually temporary and not the effect of\r\norganic heart disease.\" This is particularly true, of course, in\r\npeople of a neurotic character, and Broadbent went on to say that\r\n\"speaking generally, angina pectoris in a woman is always spurious,\r\nand the more minute and protracted and eloquent the description of the\r\npain, the more certain may one be of the conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity to follow the case of a young woman who had a\r\nseries of attacks of angina pectoris some twenty years ago, so severe\r\nthat a bad prognosis seemed surely justified, and though at times the\r\nattacks were rather alarming to herself and friends, nothing serious\r\ndeveloped and for the past ten years, since she has gained\r\nconsiderably in weight, they have not bothered her at all. She used to\r\nbe rather thin and delicate, trying to do a large amount of work and\r\nliving largely on her nervous energy. At times of stress she was\r\nlikely to suffer from pain in the precordia running down the left arm\r\nand accompanied by an intense sense of the possibility of fatal\r\ntermination. With reasonably large doses of nux vomica, an increase in\r\nappetite came and a steadying of her heart that soon did away with\r\nthese recurrent attacks. These came back later several times when she\r\nneglected her general condition, but there never were any objective\r\nsymptoms that pointed to an organic lesion. After twenty years she is\r\nin excellent health, except for occasional attacks of a curious\r\nneurotic indigestion that sometimes produces cardiac disturbances. Of\r\ncourse, such cases are not uncommon in the experience of those who see\r\nmany cardiac and nervous patients.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of pseudo-angina, mental influence is all important.\r\nOf course, the conditions which predispose to the mechanical\r\ninterference with heart action that occasions the discomfort, must be\r\nrelieved as far as possible. The severity of the symptoms, however,\r\nare much more dependent on the patient's solicitude with regard to\r\nthem, they are much more emphasized by worry about them, than by the\r\nphysical factors which occasion them. Reassurance is the first step\r\ntowards cure. After relief has been afforded from the severer attacks,\r\nthe patient's solicitude as to the future must be allayed and the fact\r\nemphasized that there are many cases in which a number of attacks of\r\ncardiac discomfort simulating angina pectoris have been followed by\r\ncomplete relief and then by many years of undisturbed life. It is\r\nimportant to make patients understand that, in spite of the fact that\r\ntheir attacks occur during the course of digestion, as is not\r\ninfrequently the case, this constitutes no reason for lessening the\r\namount of food taken. Nearly always these attacks occur with special\r\nfrequency among those who are under weight, and disappear rather\r\npromptly when there is a gain in weight. Solicitude with regard to the\r\nheart must be relieved wherever possible and then with the regaining\r\nof general health the heart attacks will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTACHYCARDIA\r\n\r\nEtymologically tachycardia means rapid heart. There are two forms of\r\nrapid heart, that which is constant and that which occurs in\r\nperiodical attacks. It is for this latter that the term tachycardia\r\nhas been more particularly used, though occasionally the adjective\r\nparoxysmal is attached to it to indicate the intermittent character of\r\nthe affection. With regard to the persistent type of rapid heart\r\nsomething deserves to be said, however, because patients' minds are\r\noften seriously disturbed by them. Often it has existed for years,\r\nsometimes is known to be a family trait and probably has existed from\r\nchildhood, yet the discovery of it may be delayed until some\r\npathological condition develops, calling for the attendance of a\r\nphysician who may be needlessly alarmed and in turn alarm his patient\r\nby his recognition of it. The cause for this persistent rapid pulse is\r\nnot well known and is difficult to determine. Heredity, as has been\r\nsuggested, sometimes plays an important role in it. Certain families\r\nhave one or more members in each generation with rapid hearts.\r\nWhenever persistent rapid heart is a family trait the patient can be\r\nassured, as a rule, without hesitation, that the general prognosis of\r\nthe case is that of the lives of the rest of the family. Usually the\r\nsymptom seems to mean nothing as regards early mortality or any\r\nspecial tendency to morbidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Prognosis.--While a rapid pulse often and indeed usually has\r\nsome serious significance, it must not be forgotten that it may be an\r\nindividual peculiarity and be quite compatible with long life and hard\r\nwork. One of the first patients that I saw as a physician had a pulse\r\nbetween ninety-six and one hundred. As there was a slight tendency to\r\nirregular heart action also, I was inclined to think that there must\r\nbe some cardiac muscle trouble. There was apparently no valve lesion.\r\nHe told me that a physician ten years before had noted his rapid pulse\r\nand had made many inquiries about it which rather seriously disturbed\r\nhim. He had been an extremely healthy man during his fifty-five years\r\nof life and there seemed no reason to conclude, since his rapid pulse\r\nhad been in existence for ten years, that it meant anything serious.\r\nHe has now lived well beyond the age of seventy and still has a pulse\r\nalways above ninety. Contrary to what might be thought, he is an\r\nextremely placid, unexcitable individual, who, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, will probably live for many years to come. He has no\r\nfamily history of tachycardia, though there is a history of rather\r\nnervous irritable hearts in other members for two generations.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of this kind came under my observation about\r\nfifteen years ago in a clergyman whose pulse was never below ninety,\r\nand who on slight excitement, or after a rapid walk, or after a heavy\r\nmeal, would have a pulse of 120. He knew that it was a family trait,\r\nhis father having had it yet living to be past seventy. He gave a\r\nhistory of its having been recognized in his own person more than\r\ntwenty years before. His general health, however, was excellent. He\r\ntook long walks and, indeed, pedestrian excursions {341} were his\r\nfavorite exercise. He was able to go up flights of stairs rather\r\nrapidly without discomfort. He was the pastor in a tenement house\r\ndistrict so he had plenty of opportunity for such exertion. Infections\r\nof any kind, colds and the like, disturbed his pulse very much, if the\r\nordinary standard was taken, but it was not irregular and the increase\r\nin rapidity was probably only proportionate to the original height of\r\nthe pulse in his case. After all, as the normal pulse of sixty to\r\nseventy rises to between ninety and one hundred even in a slight\r\nfever, it is not surprising if a pulse normally above ninety should\r\nrise fifty per cent. to one hundred and thirty-five under similar\r\nconditions. He is now well past sixty, after over thirty-five known\r\nyears--and probably longer--of a pulse above ninety, yet he is in\r\nexcellent general health and promises, barring accident, to live\r\nbeyond seventy.\r\n\r\nSome ten years ago I first saw another of these cases of fast heart,\r\nwith a family history of the affection in a preceding generation. He\r\nwas a man who had not taken good care of himself and had been\r\nespecially over-indulgent in alcohol. This indulgence consisted not in\r\nrare sprees but in the persistent daily taking of large quantities of\r\nstraight whiskey. In spite of warnings, he has not given up this\r\nhabit; yet at the age of sixty-five he is apparently in good health\r\nand is able to fulfill the duties of a rather exacting occupation.\r\n\r\nPersistent rapid pulse often occurs in connection with some\r\ndisturbance of the thyroid gland. The larval forms of Graves' disease\r\noccur particularly in young persons, though they are sometimes seen in\r\nthose beyond middle life. They seem to be due to a lack of development\r\nof the thyroid in consonance with the rest of the tissues, though\r\noccasionally, especially after the menopause, they seem to be\r\nconnected with some degenerative process out of harmony for the moment\r\nwith other forms of degeneration. When they occur in young persons\r\nthey may, of course, represent the beginning of incipient Graves'\r\ndisease, but they are often only functional and the symptoms may pass\r\naway entirely. The rapid heart action may come and go, though usually\r\nthe attacks last for some days and oftener for a week or more at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nParoxysmal Tachycardia.--A rapid heart may not only exist continuously\r\nin an individual for many years without any impairment of general\r\nhealth or shortening of life, but there may be spasmodic attacks of\r\nthis condition with the pulse running up so high as to deserve the\r\nname of paroxysmal tachycardia; yet the patient may live for many\r\nyears and die from some affection not connected with his heart.\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case of this kind on record is that\r\nreported by Prof. H. C. Wood of Philadelphia. The patient was a\r\nphysician in his later eighties when he came under Dr. Wood's\r\nobservation. His first attack of paroxysmal tachycardia came in his\r\nthirty-seventh year. These attacks had apparently always been similar\r\nto those he then suffered and were abrupt in onset and the pulse would\r\nrise rapidly to 200 a minute. The original prognosis had been, of\r\ncourse, very unfavorable. The physician had outlived all the prophets\r\nof evil in his case, however. When large numbers of these cases were\r\nstudied, it was found that they always last more than ten years, and,\r\nwhile heart failure in such cases is reported, it is doubtful if this\r\noccurs with more frequency in these patients as the result of strong\r\nreflexes than in the general run of patients, for it must not be\r\nforgotten that there is a certain average number of deaths from\r\nso-called heart failure in people supposed to be in good health.\r\n\r\n{342}\r\n\r\nIn connection with these attacks of paroxysmal tachycardia, there\r\noften come intense feelings of depression and even local disturbances\r\nof circulation. It is probable that in many cases there is a serious\r\nfactor at work. MacKenzie has suggested that they are due to nodal\r\nrhythm of the heart in which the heart beat does not start at the root\r\nof the sinus as is usual, but in some other portion of the musculature\r\nand as a consequence there is serious interference with the regular\r\nrhythmic action. In a number of cases of heart failure, tachycardia\r\nbecomes a prominent feature and it is probably due to some such\r\ndisturbance as this. Such cases often look very serious for a time,\r\nyet frequently recover completely after a brief interval. This must\r\nnot disguise the fact, however, that many of these cases, especially\r\nwhere acute dilatation of the heart can be demonstrated, are extremely\r\ndangerous and may end in a sudden fatal termination. The patient seems\r\nso much prostrated that occasionally the physician may doubt whether\r\nit is worth while to put him to the bother necessary in order to\r\ndiagnose the acute dilatation of the heart. It always is, however. If\r\nit were nothing else but the occupation of the patient's attention\r\nwith the doctor's manipulations, as far as that is possible, the\r\neffect would be good, besides whatever irritation may be caused to the\r\nheart muscle itself by percussion of the heart area will probably do\r\nmechanical good.\r\n\r\nThe most important element evidently is that the patient shall not be\r\nallowed to lose courage or to think that nothing can be done for him.\r\nSomething must be done, and a combination of swallowing movements and\r\ndeep breathing, as far as that is possible, with counter-irritation\r\nthrough the chest wall should be carried out. Drugs also should be\r\nemployed and the aroma of strong coffee with the irritating effect of\r\nammonia upon the nostrils should be employed. These act upon the vagus\r\nso as to stimulate the heart, but above all they act upon the mind,\r\nand nothing so stimulates the heart as reawakened hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBRADYCARDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nBradycardia, or persistent slow pulse, is much rarer than the\r\npersistent rapid pulse discussed at the beginning of the chapter on\r\ntachycardia. Cases are, indeed, sufficiently rare to be medical\r\ncuriosities. Prof. Clifford Allbutt has called attention to the fact\r\nthat the status of bradycardia or brachycardia, as Osler (following\r\nRiegel because of the analogue tachycardia) prefers to call it, is\r\nvery different from that of tachycardia. In the latter, especially, in\r\nthe specific sense of the term, the symptoms occur paroxysmically,\r\nendure for a definite length of time and then there is a return to the\r\nnormal pulse rate. For this, or at least for the condition known as\r\nessential tachycardia, there is no well-defined cause and no definite\r\npathological lesion. Bradycardia or brachycardia, however, is usually\r\npresent as the result of some known physiologic or pathologic\r\ncondition; it endures as long as the cause continues to act and then\r\nceases, usually not to return unless the same cause gives rise to it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n{343}\r\n\r\nThere are some cases, however, of slow pulse that cannot be traced to\r\nany definite lesion and in which the pulse is much slower at certain\r\ntimes than at others, though without its being possible to trace any\r\ndefinite immediate cause. These cases seem to be physiological\r\nanalogues of tachycardia. In tachycardia there is an irritation of the\r\naccelerator nerves to the heart, in brachycardia of the inhibitory\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepressed Mental States.--Occasionally the reason for this can be\r\nfound, though it is rather vague. In depressed mental states, for\r\ninstance, a pulse between fifty and sixty is common. In people who\r\nsuffer from periodic fits of depression it is not unusual to find that\r\nin the early morning the pulse is not more than fifty-five. I have\r\nseen patients who were worrying about their hearts present records of\r\nearly morning pulse before they got up that were always below sixty.\r\nThis is probably in a certain number of people quite normal. I\r\nremember a series of observations made on the attendants in the\r\nCharite Hospital in Berlin in which it was clear that the normal\r\nGerman morning temperature at seven a.m. was below 97 F., while the\r\npulses were always below sixty. A reassurance of this kind is helpful\r\nto patients who have acquired the bad habit of taking their own pulse\r\nand have been disturbed by finding it so much below what they consider\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrative Case.--A number of cases of persistent slow pulse seem to\r\nbe congenital or produced by some definite pathological lesion, yet do\r\nnot prove serious for the patient. Some years ago I described one of\r\nthese cases in a paper read before the Section on Medicine of the New\r\nYork Academy of Medicine [Footnote 29] and I have had the opportunity\r\nto follow it for about fifteen years. Though the patient's pulse is\r\nusually below forty and even after a rapid walk does not rise above\r\nfifty, she is in reasonably good health and during those years has\r\nburied two husbands. When I saw her she was compelled to go up and\r\ndown stairs frequently and yet did not experience much difficulty.\r\nWhile patients suffering from palpitation would find it impossible,\r\nbecause of the discomfort produced, to make the journeys up and down\r\nstairs that she did, she felt only about as much respiratory\r\ndiscomfort as would come to a woman of her size. Her respirations were\r\nsomewhat hurried--22 to 24 to the minute--but her general health was\r\nvery good. Her urine was normal, her liver not enlarged, her ordinary\r\norganic functions were not disturbed and there was no sign of arterial\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 29: _The Medical News_, November 10, 1900.]\r\n\r\nWith the pulse rate as low as this one might expect to find the\r\npatient phlegmatic, slow of movement and not readily moved to emotion.\r\nOn the contrary, she has always been rather nervous and high-strung\r\nand inclined to be excitable. Her cardiac condition was first noted\r\njust after the first grip epidemic in this country, though her\r\nattention was not called to it during the course of the grip. It seems\r\nprobable that the heart condition was acquired as a consequence of\r\nsome irritative lesion affecting the inhibitory nerves to the heart\r\nthat developed at that time. After her heart condition had been\r\ndiscovered she was for a time a skirt dancer and frequently danced for\r\nthe amusement of her friends. She was always lively and active and\r\nafter her first husband's death, when it became necessary for her to\r\nearn her own living, she was on the stage for a time and danced\r\nwithout any embarrassment of either {344} heart or respiration. As a\r\nconsequence of running down in weight and general health, owing to\r\nconditions since her husband's death, she noticed that dancing proved\r\nexhausting to her and she gave it up.\r\n\r\nIn general, she considered herself quite as capable as any of her\r\nfriends for the ordinary duties and amusements of life. When I first\r\nsaw her her digestion had been somewhat disturbed by worries and\r\nunsuitable nutrition taken at irregular intervals and this, I think,\r\naccounted much more than her heart for her complaint of tiredness on\r\nexertion. Later, after her second marriage, when she was in better\r\ncircumstances, all her symptoms disappeared and even her heart rate\r\nrose so that it was seldom below forty, and after exertion always went\r\nto fifty. What was needed in her case more than anything was a change\r\nof environment, the satisfaction of mind that comes with freedom from\r\nworries and the cares of making her own living, and the improvement in\r\ndigestion due to regular meals of good, simple, nutritious food.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility with Health and Activity.--The above case is interesting\r\nas illustrating mental influence upon such a serious condition as\r\nbradycardia. Most people who suffer from it are likely to be\r\nover-depressed and this reacts to disturb digestion and also further\r\nto disturb the heart itself. What these patients need above all, then,\r\nis reassurance with regard to their condition. There are some striking\r\nexamples in history and in medical literature of bradycardia or\r\npersistent slow pulse in persons who are able to accomplish a large\r\namount of work and whose general health and capacity for\r\naccomplishment were not at all disturbed by this physical condition.\r\nAbove all, they were not depressed and did not lack initiative.\r\nNapoleon I, whose pulse is said normally to have been about forty,\r\nrising during the excitement of battle to fifty, is a typical example.\r\nMedical literature records a number of patients with congenital slow\r\npulse without any discernible heart lesion who lived long and\r\nsuccessful lives. One of these was a very successful English athlete.\r\nThe prognosis of these cases is not as bad as it might seem to be and\r\nthe mental state of the patient is more important than anything else\r\nin the treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n{345}\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII\r\n\r\n_RESPIRATORY DISEASES_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCOUGHS AND COLDS\r\n\r\n\r\nCough under most conditions is so completely a natural reflex due to\r\nirritation from material which demands expectoration that to talk of\r\nthe application of psychotherapeutics to its treatment would seem\r\nalmost an abuse of words. This is true if we think of the curing of an\r\nordinary catarrhal or bronchitic cough by suggestion. We know now,\r\nhowever, that, as a rule, we do not cure diseases, we only relieve\r\ntheir symptoms and thus enable nature to overcome the affection. The\r\nordinary cough remedies do two things: they cause more liquid to exude\r\ninto the lung tissues and thus soften and liquefy thick mucous\r\nmaterial so as to make it easier to expectorate, or they lessen\r\nirritation and soothe the cough by making the nervous system less\r\nreactive. This second function of our remedial measures directed\r\nagainst cough can at least be assisted very materially by\r\npsychotherapeutics. Direct suggestion may be of great help, while the\r\nfirst function, that of softening the cough by liquefying the sputum,\r\ncan be materially aided by certain suggestions to the patient of\r\nnatural means and ways by which his cough may be relieved, its\r\nsecondary symptoms modified, and its course abbreviated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCough and Suggestion.--Much of the coughing indulged in is quite\r\nunnecessary and might well be dispensed with. At many of the German\r\nsanatoria for consumption there is a rule that patients must not cough\r\nat dinner, and no coughing is heard in the refectory. Without such a\r\nrule the midday meal, if taken in common by the large number of\r\nconsumptives present, would be a pandemonium of coughing. Cough is\r\nlargely influenced by suggestion. Most of the respiratory reflexes\r\nfollow this same rule. To see another yawn tempts us to yawn; to hear\r\nanother cough tempts us to cough. In church or in a theater after an\r\ninterval of interest one cough will be followed by a battery of\r\ncoughs. People who have colds think they have a right to cough, and so\r\nthey often cough much more than is at all necessary. Of course, when\r\nmaterial accumulates in the lungs it must be coughed up, but not a\r\nlittle of the coughing might easily be dispensed with--it is\r\nunproductive coughing. A distinguished German medical authority who is\r\naccustomed to talk very plainly once said that it is quite as impolite\r\nand injustifiable to cough unproductively as to scratch the head\r\nunproductively. Only results justify either procedure.\r\n\r\nDry coughing, when persistent, is greatly a matter of habit acquired\r\nby yielding to slight irritation. When children scratch their heads we\r\ntrain them {346} not to, and the same thing should be done with regard\r\nto yielding to reactions from slight irritations of their lungs.\r\n\r\nEven when material has to be expectorated there is often much more\r\nfuss and effort made over it than is needed. Most men a generation ago\r\ninsisted on their right to expectorate in public because it was better\r\nfor them to rid themselves of offensive material than to retain it.\r\nThe difference between men and women in this respect has always been\r\ndistinctive. Women practically never expectorate in public, men do it\r\nfrequently, or rather, let us hopefully say, used to. It seems to be\r\nthought the exercise of a manly privilege to spit and the boy learns\r\nthe habit. It seemed almost a necessity in the past, yet now we have\r\ncome to a point where, by legal regulation, we prohibit spitting in\r\npublic and it seems likely future generations, not far off, will hold\r\nit as a rule that instead of the sexes being essentially different by\r\nnature in this respect, the habits formed by the enforcement of recent\r\nlegal regulations will show their essential similarity and we shall\r\nhave no \"expectorating sex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnnecessary Coughing Harmful.--Coughing, unless it is necessary,\r\nalways does harm. It irritates the mucous membrane, already rendered\r\nsomewhat hyperemic and tender by the inflammatory process at work, to\r\nhave the breath pass over it in such an expulsive way. This is one\r\ncase where nature's indications are not to be followed. It is like\r\nitchiness in eczema: it needs to be restrained. The cold will get\r\nbetter sooner, the inflammatory process will run its course with less\r\ndisturbance and in briefer time than if it was not disturbed in this\r\nway or disturbed only as little as possible. This is a point that is\r\nnot often explained to patients and most sufferers from colds are\r\ninclined to think that the more they cough the better, even though the\r\ncough, like the scratching in eczema, evidently produces a roughening\r\nand sensitizing of inflamed tissue. Of course, this principle of the\r\nlimitation of cough may be carried to excess and indeed sometimes is\r\nwhen opium is administered to quell coughing. This is not the idea,\r\nhowever, of the suggestion made here, which is only to restrain the\r\ncough within the limits necessary for the removal of material that\r\nshould be evacuated.\r\n\r\nThe history of most of the tuberculous patients who suffer from\r\nhemorrhage for the first time shows that they had been coughing\r\nunproductively, and then, after coughing in this way rather severely,\r\nthere came the flow of blood due to the rupture of a minute artery. In\r\nthese cases the tuberculosis process has been at work for some time\r\nand has prepared the tissue for this arterial rupture, but there is no\r\ndoubt, however, that the coughing itself, far from doing good, rather\r\nhelped in the destruction of lung tissue, or at least made it more\r\ndifficult for natural processes in the lungs to wall off the bacilli\r\nand prevent further damage. Practically every adult is in some danger\r\nof lighting up an acute tuberculous process in his lungs if he racks\r\nthem by coughing. There are many similar examples in nosology of this\r\npossibility of some habit predisposing to or favoring the development\r\nof disease.\r\n\r\nAfter measles and whooping cough tuberculosis is especially likely to\r\ndevelop. In both of these diseases, but especially in the latter,\r\ncoughing is an element of the affection that probably predisposes to\r\nthe implantation of the tubercle bacillus so commonly present in the\r\nair of our cities. The lesions produced in the extreme expulsive\r\nefforts of the paroxysm form favorable niduses for the micro-organism.\r\nChildren particularly, if at all encouraged, are likely {347} to cough\r\nmore than is good for them. On the slightest irritation they cough. It\r\nis almost impossible to restrain them from scratching when they are\r\nsuffering from eczema, yet we take rather elaborate means to do so,\r\nand quite as much must be done to prevent them from coughing when\r\nthere is no special reason for it. This does not refer to cases in\r\nwhich material is being abundantly expectorated. Elimination can only\r\nbe secured by a proper expulsive effort. Very often, however, children\r\nnotice how much solicitude their little dry cough arouses. They like\r\nto be the objects of attention. They are dosed with various cough\r\nremedies, more or less pleasant, whenever they cough. Instead of being\r\ntold that they should restrain their cough except when it is\r\nnecessary, they are rather encouraged to cough whenever there seems to\r\nbe the slightest occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflex Coughs.--There are a number of coughs that are said to be\r\nreflex because they are not induced by any lesion of the lungs or of\r\nthe larynx, or, indeed, of any of the air passages. In these cases\r\nsome pathological condition is often found in another organ or set of\r\norgans, usually one of those connected with the vagus nerves. The wide\r\ndistribution of these pharyngo-laryngo-esophago-pulmano-cardio-gastric\r\nnerves gives ample opportunity for reflexes. We hear much of reflex\r\ncough. There is a stomach cough and an intestinal cough, a uterine\r\ncough, an ear cough, etc. These coughs are always dry, though often\r\nvery irritating to patients, and especially may be a source of dread\r\nand disturbance of mind and health because they seem to signify some\r\nserious pathological condition. As a rule, these coughs can be\r\nrestrained to a great degree and frequently suppressed entirely by\r\nsuggestion and discipline. In many cases there is some temptation to\r\ncough consequent upon irritation of nerve endings communicated through\r\nsome devious paths to the nerve supply of the respiratory tract, but\r\nthis tendency is not very strong and can be easily overcome. It may be\r\nsaid that this is asking too much of human nature, and that, just as\r\nsneezing carries with it a certain satisfaction and so is apparently\r\nworth the trouble of indulging in, coughing should be permitted, at\r\nleast, if not encouraged, but the reasoning is fallacious.\r\n\r\n\r\nHabit Coughs.--An interesting cough that comes to the physician is\r\nthat in which there is absolutely no pathological reason to account\r\nfor it. There is an irritation of the mucous membrane somewhere along\r\nthe respiratory tract but it is very slight and somehow the habit has\r\nbeen acquired of yielding to the reflex that it occasions. I have seen\r\nthese coughs in children in cases where I was sure that they were\r\nnothing but tics. I have seen so-called hacking coughs in girls of\r\ntwelve to sixteen that were explained as ovarian, or sometimes as\r\npuberty coughs, that were really nothing more than habits. A slight\r\nhyperemia of the mucous membrane in the upper respiratory tract due to\r\nan ordinary cold began in a very slight degree the irritation, and\r\nthen the habit of coughing was not given up. Of course, I know the\r\ndanger of treating such cough as habit coughs. Tuberculosis in its\r\ninitial stage may exist for a prolonged period before it produces any\r\nincrease of secretion and at a time when none of the ordinary physical\r\ndiagnostic signs are present, except possibly a little prolongation of\r\nexpiration over the affected area. At this stage tuberculosis will\r\nsometimes produce gastric disturbance, and, as I have already said,\r\nthese are spoken of as stomach coughs when there really is something\r\nmuch more serious than them at work. When there has been no running\r\ndown in {348} weight, and, above all, no special opportunity for\r\ncontagion, then, if there are no physical signs in the lungs, these\r\ncoughs will be best treated as habits and gradually be made to stop by\r\nsuggestion. The limitation of coughing will do good in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoughs as Tics.--Some coughs are not really due to any difficulty in\r\nthe respiratory tract, but are caused by nervous irritability. There\r\nare certain habits in the matter of clearing the throat that sometimes\r\nbecome pronounced and apparently impossible to stop. As I have said,\r\nthese are tics rather than true coughs. Many of these neurotic coughs\r\nvery seriously alarm patients and also their friends. They are dry, as\r\na rule, rather harsh and inclined to be brassy. Occasionally they are\r\nonly what is known as \"hacks,\" as if the patient were trying to clear\r\nthe throat of some offending material. Of course, at no time must the\r\nsignificance of cough be made light of unless a careful investigation\r\nof the patient's condition has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis.--Names for these coughs should not be too readily accepted\r\nwhich, by satisfying legitimate curiosity and lessening proper\r\napprehension with regard to them, will stop further investigations.\r\nBesides stomach coughs, one often hears of intestinal and even uterine\r\nor ovarian coughs. In many cases the real condition is one of an\r\nincipient tuberculous condition and there may be no sign of this\r\nexcept a disturbance of the pulse and perhaps a slight variation of\r\nthe temperature range for the day (two degrees or more Fahrenheit in\r\nthe twenty-four hours). Such coughs should always be carefully\r\ninvestigated for the possibility of incipient tuberculosis. At once\r\nthe patient should be warned about coughing without necessity, since\r\nthis only tends to disseminate the tuberculous process and may help to\r\nbreak down nature's wall of protective lymph.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no disturbance of pulse or temperature and the patient\r\nis not under weight and there are no signs in the lungs, then the\r\ncough is merely a habit and partakes of the nature of a tic. Sometimes\r\nthese habits are rather difficult to break; always, however, much can\r\nbe done by suggestion, by a habit of self-control, by self-discipline,\r\nand by thorough persuasion of the patient. Drugs are likely to\r\ninveterate the condition if not allied with suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving Unfavorable Suggestions.--For the ordinary coughs and colds\r\nof the winter time there are many unfavorable suggestions that deserve\r\nto be eliminated. For instance, most people are sure that exposure to\r\nthe air will inevitably make their cold and cough worse. This is a\r\nrelic of the olden time when the confinement of patients to their\r\nrooms was supposed to be the best remedial measure for all respiratory\r\ndiseases. Tuberculosis patients were kept in and died without any\r\nchance. Now these patients, even while running a temperature, or\r\nsuffering from pleurisy, or the intercostal painful conditions that\r\nare often serious complications because of the irritability and\r\ndiscomfort produced, and which are so often supposed to be due to\r\ndrafts, are put out on the porch, or on the roof of a hospital, or\r\nallowed calmly to lie in bed between two open windows, without the\r\nslightest hesitation. They begin to improve under such treatment much\r\nsooner than if they were confined, and indeed the whole prognosis of\r\ntuberculosis has been completely changed by the modification of the\r\nold-time habit of confinement to that of perfectly free access of\r\nouter air and even cold air that has taken its place.\r\n\r\nThis principle of treatment must be applied for coughs and colds.\r\nWhile {349} patients are running a temperature they must not take\r\nexercise, they must not be allowed to work, above all they must not be\r\nallowed to get in crowds nor tire themselves in any way. The room in\r\nwhich they are, however, must be thoroughly aired, the window must be\r\nopen all night and, if possible, they must sit in the sun for several\r\nhours a day. This will cure a cough or a cold quicker than anything\r\nelse. Many coughs that hang on when treated by remedies of various\r\nkinds, yield at once if the patient is given an abundance of fluid\r\ndiet and gets freely into the air. There is no danger of catching\r\nanother cold, because a cold is not due to a low outdoor temperature,\r\nbut to dust and microbes, and is a real infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrational Remedies.--There are an innumerable number of supposed\r\nremedies for colds. Scarcely any one who has reached the age of forty\r\napparently feels that he or she is doing the whole duty to humanity\r\nunless they have some remedy for colds to recommend. Most of the\r\npopular remedies that are employed probably do as much harm as good\r\nand many of those that are very popular and are sometimes recommended\r\neven by physicians have no rational standing in present-day\r\ntherapeutics. Perhaps the most popular is a combination of quinin and\r\nwhisky. The effect of this is to give patients, who are unaccustomed\r\nto whisky and who are susceptible to quinin, about as uncomfortable a\r\ntwenty-four hours the day after they take the remedies as can be\r\nimagined. Quinin now has no possible specific therapeutic significance\r\nin the cure of the series of infections called colds. In the days when\r\nwe did not understand malaria and considered it in some way as an\r\nessential fever due to the absorption of miasmatic material, quinin\r\nseemed to have a specific influence upon several conditions.\r\nAccordingly it was employed in all sorts of fevers and, because it is\r\ncomparatively harmless, also in that short infectious fever which we\r\ncall a common cold. No physician now employs it (except in small doses\r\nas a general tonic) for febrile conditions, unless in malaria. There\r\nwe know that it acts by killing the plasmodium and is a real specific.\r\nWe do not think of it any more, however, as a general febrifuge and\r\nthere is no justification for its use in the slight infective\r\nconditions we know as colds.\r\n\r\nAs for the whisky, if taken in stiff doses as it often is, the\r\nreaction is likely to make the patient quite miserable the next day.\r\nIt seems to be the rule for him to think that if, notwithstanding the\r\ntaking of the quinin and whisky, he feels thus ill, he would have been\r\never so much worse without it. Colds, however, when left untreated so\r\nfar as drugs go but managed by natural means often run a mild course.\r\nSome of the reputation of quinin and whisky is due to the fact that\r\nnot infrequently persons suffer from chilly feelings that seem to\r\nportend a cold and take quinin and whisky and the cold does not\r\ndevelop. The remedies are then supposed to have aborted or to have\r\ninhibited the development of the cold. Anyone who has seen a number of\r\nthese cases treated expectantly, however, knows how often it happens\r\nthat the chilly feelings that seem to announce the cold pass off\r\nwithout incident after a good night's rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nRational Treatment.--The old rule of getting the emunctories at work\r\nmust be the basis of any rational therapy of colds. A mild opening of\r\nthe bowels, especially if there is some constipation, a hot drink on\r\ngoing to bed so that there is some sweating and perhaps the use of a\r\nmild diuretic will almost surely affect these cases favorably.\r\nPatients have to be careful, {350} however, next morning to stimulate\r\nthe circulation in their skin to activity so that the cutaneous\r\nmuscles shall react upon the capillaries and the capillaries\r\nthemselves tonically contract in order that there may not be too much\r\nblood near the surface of the body, or the patient may easily be\r\nchilled in cold weather. This chilling of the blood when much of it is\r\nnear the surface seems to lower its vitality and the patient easily\r\nreinfects himself or, if he goes into dusty or crowded places, catches\r\na fresh dose of infectious material. This is the process which is\r\ncalled catching a fresh cold.\r\n\r\nThe removing of the unfavorable suggestions of remedies that do harm\r\nrather than good and the giving of favorable suggestions founded on\r\nour present-day knowledge of what a cold is and just what we need to\r\ndo in order to benefit it, is the most important element in the\r\ntreatment. Above all, however, the patient must sleep in an airy room\r\nand must be sure that he is neither breathing his own expired air nor\r\nthat of anyone else. With thorough ventilation, however, and the\r\nstimulating effect of the cold air and the confidence due to proper\r\ndirections, colds rapidly get better.\r\n\r\nThere can be only one reason for keeping patients indoors who are\r\nsuffering from cold. That is, if they are suffering from fever, the\r\nbeing out involves exertion. In that case, of course, patients must\r\nrest and must avoid exertion, but there is no reason why they should\r\nnot have all possible fresh air. The unfavorable state of mind towards\r\nfresh air and especially night air in these patients was cultivated by\r\nthe profession up to a generation or two ago, but is quite unjustified\r\nby our present knowledge. Night air is probably a little better than\r\nday air because it is freer from dust. It is because of malaria that\r\nnight air was supposed to be detrimental, but we have found that the\r\nonly good reason for this was that the mosquito travels at night.\r\nThere are no other constituents of night air that produce any serious\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, patients suffering from colds need more sleep than other\r\npeople and above all need more sleep than they ordinarily take, for\r\nthis will increase their resistive vitality and enable them to throw\r\noff the infection. A good rule is to add two hours of sleep to the\r\nusual quota. The unfortunate habit of keeping people indoors and of\r\nkeeping fresh outdoor air away from them, because it is feared they\r\nwill catch a fresh cold, often seriously disturbs sleep and delays\r\nrecovery. In a word, many a cold that hangs on does so mainly because\r\nof unfortunate suggestions of one kind or another that have come to\r\noccupy a place in the supposed therapeutics of the condition. The\r\nremoval of these and the insistence on just as much recourse as\r\npossible to the therapeutic means at nature's command constitute the\r\nbasis of successful therapy of these very common infections, which\r\nprobably are the source of more morbidity in the community because of\r\ntheir wide diffusion and frequent recurrence than all the other\r\ninfectious diseases put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, in spite of all our efforts against it, remains in\r\nDefoe's striking phrase the \"captain of the men of death.\" Pneumonia\r\nhas preempted its {351} place in the statistics of mortality, but this\r\nis to a considerable extent because tuberculosis at the end\r\nmasquerades as an acute pneumonic exacerbation. Not less than one in\r\neight, probably more, of all those who die, die from tuberculosis. It\r\nis the most serious of diseases. In spite of its eminently physical\r\ncharacter it probably affords the best possible illustration of the\r\nplace of mental influence in therapeutics. We have had any number of\r\nnew cures for tuberculosis, introduced by serious physicians who were\r\nsure from the results they had secured that they had found an\r\nimportant new remedy. After a few years each of these cures in\r\nsuccession has been relegated to the limbo of unused remedies because\r\nfound inefficient. At the beginning they produced a beneficial\r\ninfluence because of the suggestion of therapeutic efficiency that\r\nwent with them. When this suggestion failed because the physician who\r\nadministered the remedy lacked confidence, the real place of the\r\nsupposed specific as merely another mind cure was recognized.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many of the remedies that have been introduced have not been\r\nmerely harmless drugs, but not a few of them have probably had rather\r\na detrimental physical effect than a beneficial influence. In spite of\r\nthis, the influence on the patient's mind has been sufficient to\r\nneutralize whatever of harmfulness there might have been and to arouse\r\nnew courage and new energy. The consequence of this has always been\r\nthat the patient was tempted to live more in the open air and to eat\r\nmore. _These_ are the two efficient remedies for tuberculosis. With\r\nthe additional life in the open air and increase of food his appetite\r\ngrew, for nothing so adds to appetite as the exercise of it, and with\r\nthe gain in weight there was a cessation of cough, a reduction of\r\nfever, a disappearance of night sweats and a definite increase in\r\nresistive vitality which gradually helped to overcome the disease.\r\nManifestly, then, the use of mental influence in tuberculosis is very\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS AND SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nThe most important element in any treatment of tuberculosis must be\r\nthe neutralization of unfavorable suggestions which are weighing upon\r\nthe patient and preventing him from using even the vital forces that\r\nhe has for resistance against the disease. The popular impression of\r\ntuberculosis, happily waning, is that it is an intensely fatal\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThough this is true in general, tuberculosis is by no means a\r\nnecessarily mortal disease in individual cases, and, indeed, a great\r\nmany more patients recover from tuberculosis than die from it. Papers\r\nread at the International Congress on Tuberculosis, in Washington, in\r\n1908, showed from careful autopsy records that practically all adults\r\neither actually had had at the moment of death, or had suffered\r\npreviously from tuberculosis. If there are not active lesions then\r\nthere are always healed lesions of tuberculosis in the body of almost\r\nevery human being who has passed the age of thirty. Most people have\r\nquite enough resistive vitality to enable them to recover from the\r\ndisease. It is only those who are placed in very unfavorable\r\ncircumstances during the initial stage of the disease, or who have\r\nsome serious drawback against them, who succumb to it. The fact that\r\nthe bacillus finds a lodgment in so many individual tissues shows that\r\nit is not insusceptibility that makes the difference {352} between\r\npeople, since we are all susceptible, but it is the lack of resistive\r\nvitality, and that most of us have, under ordinary circumstances, and\r\nall of us can have under favorable conditions, quite sufficient\r\nimmunizing power to prevent serious developments.\r\n\r\nEven in advanced cases it is perfectly possible for the progress of\r\nthe disease to be stopped and for many years of useful life to be\r\ngained. Probably patients who have gone beyond the incipient stage, in\r\nwhom there has once been a breaking down of pulmonary tissue never are\r\nentirely cured, but they may be so much improved that all their\r\nsymptoms disappear and they are able to follow an ordinary occupation\r\nfor many years. There is no disease in which the unfavorable prognoses\r\nof physicians have been more frequently disappointed than in\r\ntuberculosis. In any city hospital dispensary one finds many cases of\r\ntuberculosis turning up as relapses of previous conditions, with the\r\nstory that when they were seriously ill before, some prominent\r\nphysician, since dead, said they had only a few months to live. The\r\nfact that the physician who made the unfavorable prognosis has since\r\ndied himself adds greatly to the zest with which patients tell their\r\nstory. Neither the severity of the symptoms nor the amount of lung\r\ntissue attacked is quite sufficient to justify an absolutely\r\nunfavorable prognosis in the majority of cases of pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Incurable Cases.--Above all, it cannot be insisted on too\r\nemphatically that there is never a time in the course of the\r\ntuberculosis when a physician is justified in saying to a patient\r\nsuffering from any form of tuberculosis that his case is hopeless. One\r\nis never justified in saying \"You are incurable.\" Practically every\r\ntown of any size in this country has a number of cases in which\r\npatients were told by physicians that there was no hope, and yet they\r\nhave recovered to chronicle as often as they get the chance the fact\r\nthat they have outlived their physician. To say that no case of\r\ntuberculosis can be confidently declared incurable will seem to many\r\nan exaggeration. There are patients in whom the prognosis is so\r\nunfavorable as to be almost hopeless. There are never cases of which\r\nit should be said there is no hope. When patients are told, as they so\r\noften are, that they are incurable, absolutely no good is done and\r\nharm is inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity of Resistance.--When the disease has developed very rapidly\r\nin patients in whom there is no previous history of tuberculosis, and\r\nin whom there is no history of previous cases in the family, the\r\noutlook is always serious. These cases come as near being incurable as\r\nany the physician sees. But the most apparently hopeless of these will\r\nsometimes recover, contrary to all anticipation. In spite of the\r\nopposite impression so commonly accepted, the most helpful element in\r\nthese cases is the presence of a trace of tuberculosis in the family\r\nhistory. This always means the existence of some immunity against the\r\ndisease and there may be a turn for the better even when the case\r\nlooks absolutely hopeless and when it seems to just be verging on its\r\nfatal termination. Probably the most discouraging are the cases in\r\nwhich miliary tuberculosis is at work and conditions are about as\r\nunfavorable as possible. There are cases of this kind on record,\r\nhowever, with the most startling contradiction of anticipation, in\r\nwhich undoubted miliary tuberculosis produced high fever for weeks and\r\neven months, then gave rise to pleurisy, to peritonitis, to various\r\ncutaneous abscesses and to abscesses of bone, in which patients lost\r\none-third of {353} their weight or even more, and yet after the\r\nexternal lesions began to discharge freely, recovery occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlow Cases.--As for slow-running cases in which there is a distinct\r\nhistory of tuberculosis in the family, not even the most experienced\r\nphysician can state with any certainty that a fatal termination is\r\ninevitable and that recovery cannot occur. Some of the most expert\r\ndiagnosticians have been deceived in these cases. After half a dozen\r\nphysicians have given a man up, some gleam of hope has buoyed his\r\nfeelings and a turn for the better has come. Men with cavities in\r\nthree lobes, even in four lobes and occasionally it is said in all\r\nfive lobes, have survived acute stages, have recuperated to a\r\nconsiderable degree and have been able to return to work or at least\r\nto take up some useful occupation for a time. Where the lung lesion\r\nprogresses slowly it is surprising how small an amount of healthy lung\r\ntissue is needed to support life. Only those familiar with many\r\nautopsies on the tuberculous can appreciate this. Ordinarily we are\r\napt to think that when more than half the pulmonary tissue is involved\r\nso as to be of little or no use for respiratory purposes, death must\r\nbe inevitable. On the contrary, one-fourth the ordinary lung capacity\r\nwill serve and all of one lung may be quite out of commission and only\r\na portion of a single lower lobe be available, yet the patient may\r\nsurvive for a prolonged period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Specter of Heredity.--The most serious contrary suggestion that\r\npatients suffering from tuberculosis are likely to have is that their\r\naffection is hereditary and that, therefore, there is little hope of\r\nits cure. It is in the family strain and cannot be obliterated. This\r\nidea, fortunately, does not carry the weight it used to. It should,\r\nhowever, have no unfavorable influence at all and this needs to be\r\nemphasized. We discuss the subject more fully in the chapter on\r\nHeredity. We know very definitely now that the hereditary element in\r\ntuberculosis is so small that it is quite negligible. There are good\r\nauthorities who do not hesitate to say that heredity plays no role in\r\nthe causation of tuberculosis and does not even produce a\r\npredisposition. Some remnant of the old superstition (for\r\nsuperstition, from the Latin, superstare, means a survival from a\r\nprevious state of thinking, the reasons for which have disappeared)\r\nalways remains, and predisposition is the last rule of outworn\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nWe know now that contagion is the important element. The possibilities\r\nfor contagion vitiate all proofs of the predisposition idea.\r\nEspecially is this true when we recall that thirty years ago\r\npractically no one took proper precautions to prevent the\r\ndissemination of tuberculosis, and very few took them even fifteen\r\nyears ago. Even at the present time many tuberculosis patients cough\r\naround the house with open mouth, spreading tubercle bacilli all\r\naround them. We are caring for the sputum, but many other avenues for\r\nthe diffusion of the disease are open. Children acquire the infection,\r\novercome it, but retain the seeds of it in them and then in some\r\ncrisis in life, as after puberty, or when they are over-working and\r\nover-worrying, or during the first pregnancy, an opportunity is given\r\nto still living tubercle bacilli to find their way out of sclerotic\r\nconfinement. Other forms of contagion count in the absence of a case\r\nin the immediate family. We can trace the contagion only too easily,\r\neven if there is no consumptive member of the home circle.\r\nScrub-women, laundresses, those who are careless in their attendance\r\nupon the tuberculous, workers in dusty places or in factories, where\r\nthere are others who cough, all {354} these get the disease.\r\nPredisposition counts for so little that it is a vanishing factor.\r\n\r\nPatients can be assured at once then that they need not worry that the\r\nhereditary factor will make their affection less curable. On the\r\ncontrary, our recent careful studies in tuberculosis show just the\r\nopposite of the old false impressions. The children of parents who had\r\ntuberculosis are much more likely to possess resistive vitality to the\r\ndisease than those whose parents never had it. As we emphasize in the\r\nchapter on Heredity, the nations that have had the disease the longest\r\namong them are the most resistant to it. When the affection is newly\r\nintroduced into a tribe or race it carries off a great many victims.\r\nThis immunity, however, is not a function of heredity or of the\r\nincrease of resistive vitality by the inheritance of an acquired\r\ncharacter from the preceding generation, but tuberculosis takes the\r\nnon-resistant, weeds out all those who have not some immunity against\r\nit, and consequently those that are left possess some immunizing\r\npower. Tubercular heredity, then, instead of being a source of\r\ndiscouragement should rather be a source of hope. It is surprising to\r\nnote what a relief to many patients' minds is the explanation of this\r\nnewer view of heredity in tuberculosis; it lifts a burden from many\r\nand makes them eat and sleep better for days.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCING THE DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nFriends and especially near relatives sometimes come to a physician\r\nwhen there is suspicion that a young person is suffering from\r\ntuberculosis and ask that, if there is a ground for a positive\r\ndiagnosis, it shall not be communicated to the patient. They usually\r\nurge that they fear the discouragement will kill the patient. The\r\nyoung are not so easily killed and the reaction on being told the\r\ntruth and the facing of it bravely is such a magnificent help in\r\ntherapeutics that the physician should always refuse for the patient's\r\nsake alone, quite apart from any ethical obligations in the matter, to\r\nenter into any such arrangement. The assurance may be given that the\r\npatient's condition will be so stated that, far from the patient being\r\ndiscouraged after due consideration, he or she will look forward with\r\nconfidence to overcoming the affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nMental treatment is most valuable in the very early stage of incipient\r\ncases of tuberculosis. The time is past when the diagnosis of\r\ntuberculosis was made only after the recognition of definite physical\r\nsigns in the lungs and a considerable loss in weight.\r\n\r\nIn the _Medical News_ for April 9, 1904, I called attention to the\r\nquestion of \"Early Diagnosis of Tuberculosis\" from the pulse and the\r\ntemperature in these cases, and pointed out that a disturbance of\r\ntemperature need not necessarily be a febrile temperature of over 100\r\ndegrees, but that any increase of the normal daily variation of\r\ntemperature, usually considered to be about a degree and a half,\r\nshould suffice to arouse serious suspicion at least. If the morning\r\nand evening temperatures differ by two degrees, this would indicate\r\nthe presence of some pathological condition, usually tuberculosis. If\r\nin addition to this and the pulse disturbance there is any localized\r\narea of prolongation of {355} expiration, then tuberculosis is almost\r\ncertainly present, even though there may be no other physical signs,\r\nno cough, no tubercle bacilli in the sputum, nor any other signs of an\r\nactive process.\r\n\r\nIt is in these cases particularly that patients can be benefited. Very\r\noften they have a slight hacking cough, frequently repeated, with some\r\ndisturbance of appetite and of digestion and sometimes some loss in\r\nweight. Indigestion is recognized now as one of the early stages of\r\ntuberculosis. The cough in these cases, as has been said, is often\r\nspoken of as a stomach cough and is supposed to be due to the nervous\r\nreflex from the pneumogastric nerve carrying irritative impulses from\r\nthe stomach to the lungs. It is much more likely to be due directly to\r\nirritation of the terminal filaments of this same nerve in the lungs\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAVORABLE MENTAL ATTITUDE\r\n\r\nThe most important element in any cure or successful treatment of the\r\ndisease is a favorable attitude of the patient's mind. He must be told\r\nat once that consumption takes away only the \"quitters.\" People who\r\ngive up the battle or who, though still hoping, do not hope\r\nactively--that is, do not make the exertion necessary to get out into\r\nthe open air and to eat heartily--inevitably succumb to the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nEating.--Eating is often more a question of exertion than appetite or\r\nanything else for consumptive patients. They have no active appetite\r\nand they simply must force themselves to chew and swallow. Their\r\nfatigue from chewing is, indeed, likely to be so disturbing that it is\r\nadvisable to furnish patients as far as possible with such food as\r\nrequires no chewing. Milk and eggs and the thin cereal foods, like\r\ngruel, and rather thin puddings are the best for this purpose.\r\nPatients must be persuaded that they must take these whether they care\r\nfor them or not. Occasionally they may cough after a meal and vomit it\r\nup. The rule in the German sanatoria for consumptives is that whenever\r\nthis happens they must, after a short interval, repeat the whole meal.\r\nOnly rarely does it happen that a tuberculous patient vomits without\r\nsome such mechanical cause as coughing. They must be made to\r\nunderstand that any food that stays down does them good no matter how\r\nthey may feel toward it.\r\n\r\nThe actual state of affairs as regards their future must be put before\r\nthem. It is a question of eating or of death. They face these two\r\nalternatives. Eating is objectionable but, as a rule, death is more\r\nso. The kinds of food they do not care for, if they are good for them,\r\nmust be insisted on. Most people who think that they cannot take milk\r\ncan do so, if it is only presented to them insistently, with at first\r\nsuch slight modifications of taste as may be produced by a little\r\ncoffee, or tea, or vanilla, or by some other flavoring extract, which\r\nmodifies its taste. Butter and the meat fats will be taken quite\r\nreadily if it is only once made perfectly clear to patients that they\r\nmust take these or else lose in the conflict with the disease.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be repeated here that in many of these cases the\r\ndisinclination to eat is due to the fact that patients find it almost\r\nintolerably wearying to make the effort necessary for mastication.\r\nThis is particularly true if they are asked to eat meat frequently,\r\nand especially if asked to eat underdone beef, {356} which usually\r\nrequires vigorous chewing. Such meat is excellent for them once a day,\r\nbut it may be made much easier to take by chopping or scraping so that\r\npractically no exertion is required. Besides, it is by no means\r\nnecessary that these patients should eat much meat nor that they\r\nshould have to chew laboriously at their food. Raw eggs may be the\r\nbasis of the diet, especially eggs beaten up, and these will be found\r\nnot only to be very tasty, but eminently digestible. Their vegetables\r\nmay be taken in purees, so that they require very little chewing\r\neffort, though patients must be warned to mix starchy substances well\r\nwith saliva so as to facilitate their digestion. Their bread may be\r\ntaken in the shape of milk toast, or in some other soft form--bread\r\npudding for instance. All this helps, without demanding too much\r\neffort, to prevent loss of weight and to regain it when it has been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir and Comfort.--Next to food, the most important adjuvant is fresh\r\nair. Often patients find many objections to this. It is too cold for\r\nthem; they are shivery and become depressed. Most patients need to be\r\ndressed much more warmly than is the custom at present, and hands and\r\nfeet should be covered with woolen gloves and socks and even a woolen\r\nhood worn around the head if necessary. There is usually too much\r\ncovering worn on the chest and too little on the extremities. With\r\nfleecy wool garments next the body and sufficient clothing, properly\r\ndistributed, many a patient who complains of the cold will at once be\r\nmore comfortable. They must be made to understand that fresh air is\r\nabsolutely essential. Every extra hour they spend in the air is that\r\nmuch gained; every hour they spend inside is just that much lost in\r\nthe curative process. If they are uncomfortable, however, they become\r\ndiscouraged, and a discouraged tuberculous patient never resists the\r\nprogress of his affection. Not only does he not improve, but he\r\ninevitably retrogresses. It must not be forgotten, however, that the\r\nthin anemic patients who complain bitterly of the cold, when they\r\nfirst take up the habit of living outside, will grow used to it after\r\na time and then will from habit and the accumulation of a ten-pound\r\nblanket of fat be able to stand the cold much better than many healthy\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\nStimulating Examples.--Tuberculous patients need to have their courage\r\nkept up. It is true that the toxin of the tubercle bacillus has the\r\ndefinite effect of stimulating its victims so that they are likely to\r\nbe hopeful, but very often this hopefulness is vague and does not\r\ntempt them to eat and to live in the open air, the two things that\r\nmake their continued resistance to the disease possible. I find that\r\nthe knowledge of how bravely and how successfully other sufferers from\r\nthe disease resisted its invasion and succeeded in doing a good life's\r\nwork is the very best tonic that sufferers from tuberculosis can have.\r\nNeedless to say, there are any number of examples of heroes of\r\ntuberculosis who put to shame perfectly healthy people in the amount\r\nof work they succeeded in accomplishing in spite of the drawbacks of\r\ntheir disease. The unfavorable suggestion of the number of deaths from\r\nthe disease must be overcome by the contrary suggestion of the brave,\r\nbusy lives lived by those who suffered even the very severe form of\r\nthe disease and often accomplished the full term of existence in spite\r\nof their handicaps from tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Louis Stevenson_.--The best example in recent years is\r\nundoubtedly Robert Louis Stevenson. In spite of tuberculosis in severe\r\nform which prevented his living in the ordinary climates for the last\r\ntwenty years of his life, he succeeded in doing an amount of work that\r\nis simply marvelous and in {357} influencing his generation more\r\nwidely than most of the perfectly healthy writers who lived in his\r\ntime. There are over, 2,000,000 published words to the credit of\r\nStevenson, and, when we recall that most of this, owing to his\r\ncritical care, had been written over and over many times, some idea of\r\nthe vast amount of work he accomplished will be realized. Perhaps the\r\nclimax of his cheerful nature, the utter lack of discouragement in the\r\nface of what is usually the most depressing possible incident, is to\r\nbe found in his famous letter to a friend telling him, as he lies in\r\nbed, that he cannot write at any great length now but that he will\r\nwrite a long letter next week if \"bluidy Jock,\" his playful name for\r\nhemorrhage from the lungs, would only let him.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking illustrations of his insatiable appetite for\r\nwork and his complete refusal to admit that he was being conquered by\r\nthe disease has been recently told with regard to his unfinished\r\nnovel, \"St. Ives.\" He had been suffering from certain severe symptoms\r\nand had been forbidden to do anything at all, even to dictate brief\r\nnotes, or anything else that would make any extra work for his\r\nrespiratory organs. The ideas for chapters of \"St. Ives\" were in his\r\nhead and would work themselves out in spite of the doctor's\r\nprohibitions. He would not let the thought of his disease overcome\r\nhim, and so he dictated these chapters to a secretary in the sign\r\nlanguage, which he had learned so as to be able to communicate under\r\nsuch conditions. I know nothing that is more likely to make people\r\nrealize how a brave spirit can overcome every discouragement of body,\r\nand how much such a spirit is its own reward, since it secures for its\r\npossessor a prolongation of the life of the body that would surely be\r\nworn out by depression, by discouragement, and by worry. Undoubtedly\r\nStevenson's interest in his work literally gave him new life. It did\r\nuse up some nervous energy, but if his mind had been occupied by\r\nthoughts of his disease, and its probably fatal consequences, much\r\nmore of his precious store of nervous energy would have been exhausted\r\nin anxiety and worry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_J. Addington Symonds_.--After Stevenson probably the most striking\r\nexample among modern literary men is John Addington Symonds.\r\nComparatively early in life he found that he could not live in England\r\nowing to the inevitable advance of tuberculosis when he tried to do\r\nso. He took up his residence then at St. Moritz and other places of\r\nrather high altitude in Italy and continued his literary work. When we\r\nsee the row of books that we owe to Symonds' literary activity it is\r\nsurprising to think that he, too, like Stevenson, had to watch his\r\ntemperature, that every now and then there were discouraging\r\ndevelopments and incidents in his tuberculosis, and that a return to\r\nthe ordinary habitations of men away from the friendly altitudes of\r\nthe Italian Alps was always followed by a recrudescence of his\r\nsymptoms. Symonds' work was not merely literary, but his books are\r\nvaluable historical monographs on many subjects requiring much reading\r\nand diligent study and consultation of authorities. There are few men\r\nin perfect health and with abundant leisure who have succeeded in\r\naccomplishing as much as did this hero of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thoreau_.--There are other distinguished literary men of the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries the stories of whose tuberculosis\r\nhas a special interest and tonic quality. One of these is our own\r\nThoreau, another is Francis Thompson, the English poet, whose recent\r\ndeath has brought him even more publicity than did his great poems\r\nwhile he was alive. Both of them are typical examples of another phase\r\nof tuberculosis that is interesting to realize. {358} It is probable\r\nthat if Thoreau had lived the ordinary, practical, everyday life,\r\nwhich those who lived around him thought he should, he would have died\r\nof tuberculosis before he was thirty. He had no use for money beyond\r\nhis present needs and when he had made enough to keep himself very\r\nsimply he refused to earn any more. He had not time, as he said, to\r\nmake money. He wanted to live his life for itself and for the\r\ninterests higher than the material that there can be in it.\r\nAccordingly, he set himself to learn all about the birds and beasts\r\nand the trees and plants and the waters and their inhabitants around\r\nhis country home. He introduced the modern taste for nature study in\r\nits most beautiful way. He spent most of his time out of doors.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this out-of-doors life prolonged existence for many years\r\nbeyond what would have been his term. His biographers say that\r\nprobably his being out of doors in all sorts of weather laid the\r\nfoundations of \"the cold which settled on his lungs\" and eventually\r\ncarried him off. Those of us who know anything about tuberculosis, as\r\nit has been studied in recent years in the tuberculosis sanatoria, are\r\nnot likely to agree with such an opinion. Our patients in the\r\nAdirondacks live outside ten or twelve hours a day and then sleep with\r\ntheir windows open with the temperature sometimes down to zero during\r\nthe severest winter weather. Rain and dampness are not allowed to\r\ninterfere with the open air program. Colds that \"settle on the chest\"\r\nso that people die from consumption are not due to exposure to cold\r\nbut to the bacillus of tuberculosis. Where this once gains a foothold\r\nthe one hope of prolongation of life is out-door air and the more cold\r\nand stimulating that out-door air is, provided he can stand it without\r\ndiscouragement, the better for the patient. Thoreau is an example of a\r\nman whose life was prolonged by his out-door habits and by his refusal\r\nto live the humdrum, practical existence of other men, just to be like\r\nthose other men and measure his supposed success by their standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AS A THERAPEUTIC ASSET\r\n\r\nRecent interest in tuberculosis has taught us that the best possible\r\nasset for a tuberculous patient is character. Resistive vitality in\r\nthe physical order and character in the moral order seem to be\r\nco-ordinate factors. If a man will not give in in the fight, if he\r\ninsists on struggling on in spite of difficulties, discouragement and\r\nan outlook that seems hopeless, then he will almost without exception\r\nget over his tuberculosis, if there is any favorable factor in his\r\nenvironment. We talk much of immunity inborn and acquired to the\r\ndisease, but it seems to go hand in hand with a certain capacity to\r\nstand the debilitating symptoms of the disease without allowing one's\r\nmind to become depressed or one's disposition rendered despondent by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourage and Constancy.--The career of Dr. Trudeau to whom we owe so\r\nmuch of our knowledge of tuberculosis is a striking example of the\r\npower of character to enable even an apparently delicate organization\r\nto withstand the ravages of the disease. This is all the more striking\r\nbecause he was an advanced case when he finally reached an environment\r\nin which he could make head against the disease. The story of his own\r\npersonal struggle for life at Saranac, in which he both learned\r\nhimself and taught others what the modern {359} treatment of\r\ntuberculosis should be, is one of the best therapeutic documents of\r\nmodern times. Under circumstances that were quite apt to be\r\ndiscouraging to anyone of less character than he, with the bitter cold\r\nof the Adirondacks around him and quite inadequate heating facilities,\r\nso that even old-fashioned lamps were in requisition for heating\r\npurposes, he yet succeeded in winning back his own way to health and\r\nshowing others how it could be done. The struggle had to be kept up\r\nfor long, it had to be renewed again and again, our greatest American\r\nauthority on tuberculosis had to learn in his own person all the\r\nclinical details of the disease, but in the midst of it all he\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing a life work that will stand beside that of\r\nany man of his generation and will probably mean more in the history\r\nof American medicine than that of any of his supposedly more\r\ndistinguished colleagues in our large cities and large teaching\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of man whom tuberculosis does not take in spite of\r\nevery advantage that the disease may seem to have. Two others of our\r\nAmerican authorities on tuberculosis had almost the same experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersistence.--Recently I have been in correspondence with a young man\r\nwho illustrates the same power quite as strikingly. He went to Florida\r\nand soon found that the unfortunate fear of tuberculosis that has so\r\nunwarrantably come into many minds in recent years made it extremely\r\ndifficult--indeed, almost impossible--for him to live under such\r\ncircumstances as he hoped for when he went there. In any\r\nboarding-house he went to just as soon as there was question of his\r\nhaving tuberculosis the landlady would either insist on his leaving at\r\nonce or else plead with him to take his departure, lest her other\r\nboarders should desert her. He was coughing, he had some fever, his\r\ndisease was advancing in the midst of all this disturbance, physical\r\nand mental, and the outlook seemed hopeless. His picture of this\r\nselfishness of humanity, scared about nothing (for there is\r\npractically no danger if tuberculous patients take reasonable\r\nprecautions, as even nurses in sanatoria do not acquire the disease,\r\nthough living in the midst of it), constitutes one of the most\r\npoignant indictments of human nature in its worst aspect that I have\r\never had presented to me.\r\n\r\nFinally he made up his mind that there was nothing for him to do but\r\nto tent out and live by himself. Fortunately he was able to do that\r\nand just as soon as he was settled under circumstances where human\r\nnature did not bother him, nature began to do him good. He feared that\r\nhe would die during the first month in the tent, for he was having\r\nfever up to 102-1/2 and sometimes more every afternoon; but he laid in\r\na store of provisions which with the milk and eggs delivered to him\r\nevery day enabled him to stay in bed for a week, opening up the flap\r\nof the tent in the middle of the day. Then he went out and got another\r\nstock of provisions and stayed in bed for another week. His thoughts\r\nwere gloomy enough, he had only some old illustrated newspapers to\r\ngive him a few fresh thoughts every day, he had no one to visit him,\r\nbut he hung on and kept up his habit of rest and forced feeding in\r\nspite of disinclination. At the end of two weeks he had no temperature\r\nin the afternoon. At the end of the third week he made for himself a\r\nreclining chair and sat in the sun outside of his tent wrapped in a\r\nblanket. At the end of four weeks he had gained five pounds in weight.\r\nFrom that on all was plain sailing. It was his character that\r\nconquered his tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n{360}\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION AS TO SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\nBesides the value of suggestion for the general condition in\r\ntuberculosis many of its symptoms can be treated best by changing the\r\nmental attitude of the patient towards them and giving him a proper\r\nappreciation of their significance. Most symptoms are likely to\r\nproduce exaggerated reactions, especially in patients who are\r\nover-solicitous about themselves. Not a few of the symptoms are really\r\nnature's attempts at compensation, or the result of conditions which\r\nshow a natural disposition to bring about a cure. Fever, for instance,\r\nproduces lassitude and great fatigue on exertion, and patients are\r\nprone to think that this means weakness or exhaustion. It is really\r\nonly an indication of the necessity for rest, and is brought about by\r\nnature's refusal to supply all the demands of the muscles for\r\nnutrition, at a time when the febrile condition is burning up a lot of\r\nextra material. Far from being a disadvantage, weakness is a decided\r\nadvantage in this condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHemorrhage.--Probably no symptom that occurs in connection with\r\ntuberculosis is more influenced by the mental attitude than\r\nhemorrhage. It is a most disturbing incident. Even in quite small\r\namounts it upsets the patient seriously and, of course, in large\r\namounts it is a source of profound disturbance even to the most placid\r\nof patients. Excitement always adds to it. Probably no physical means\r\nthat we have at command can be depended on to control it. Ergot used\r\nto be popular, but such physiological action as it exerts, so far as\r\nwe know the drug, would seem to be likely to do as much harm as good.\r\n\r\nOther remedies have gradually lost favor in the hands of those who\r\nhave had most experience with the symptom and gallic acid and\r\nsupra-renal extract, the older and newer remedy, are now little\r\ndepended on. Two things are important--to secure lower blood pressure\r\nand lessened pulmonary activity. For these opium in some form is\r\nundoubtedly the best drug; and then a placid state of mind on the part\r\nof the patient must be secured as far as possible. The scare in these\r\ncases, in so far as it is relaxing, is rather favorable than\r\nunfavorable for the patient. In addition, it is necessary to insist on\r\nabsolute quiet and silence and then to allay all reactionary\r\nexcitement. It is important to make patients realize that while\r\nhemorrhage is a serious complication, it is by no means so serious as\r\nis usually thought.\r\n\r\nMany cases of tuberculosis that eventually run a slow course are\r\nushered in by hemorrhage, or have it as a very early manifestation. It\r\nis surprising how many people have had hemorrhage as a symptom and\r\nlive to tell of it thirty or forty years later. This was not due to\r\nany mistake of diagnosis, for a generation ago tuberculosis was more\r\nlikely to be missed when actually present than to be diagnosed when\r\nabsent. Indeed, this tendency for the cases in which hemorrhage\r\noccurred to run not so fatal a course as others was a fact that seemed\r\nto an older generation of physicians to require explanation. They\r\nsuggested that possibly the hemorrhage swept out with it some of the\r\nvirulent elements from the lungs and so lessoned the infection. From\r\nwhat we now know this is a doubtful explanation, but it seems not\r\nunlikely that a frank hemorrhage might reduce the amount of toxins in\r\nthe circulation and so in an early stage of the disease give nature a\r\nfresh start in resistive vitality.\r\n\r\n{361}\r\n\r\nWhat is much more likely, however, is that the occurrence of early\r\nhemorrhage made it easier for the patients to appreciate the\r\nseriousness of the affection and brought them to accept advice as to\r\nproper precautions. Under ordinary circumstances it is difficult and\r\nused to be even more so in the past to make the patient understand at\r\nthe beginning of the affection the necessity for giving up indoor\r\noccupations and living the outdoor life with the care for nutrition\r\nthat is so important if the case is to be improved. Hemorrhage scared\r\nthem into submission. In the old days it was the first positive\r\nsymptom of consumption. Now we have many others, and instead of\r\nfollowing the advice of over-solicitous relatives that we should not\r\ntell patients what is the matter with them, we tell them frankly and\r\nsecure such care of the health as will bring about improvement.\r\nProbably nothing illustrates so well the necessity for thus\r\ninfluencing the patients' minds into caring for themselves as the fact\r\nthat the hemorrhagic cases, as a rule, do better than the others. All\r\nof this can be used to make the minds of patients much less disturbed\r\nthan they would otherwise be by this alarming symptom.\r\n\r\n\r\nCough.--In the chapter on Coughs and Colds we have outlined how much\r\ncoughing may depend on suggestion, or habit, or on the tendency to\r\nyield to slight bronchial irritation when there is no real necessity\r\nfor it. Most tuberculous patients cough much more than is necessary.\r\nThis is always somewhat dangerous for them since it disturbs their\r\nlungs, has a tendency to distribute tubercle bacilli in their lungs,\r\nor in the air around them, and may by efforts at expulsion lacerate\r\naffected blood vessels and produce hemorrhage. Whenever cough is\r\nproductive it should be indulged in, for it removes material that\r\nshould not be allowed to accumulate. Unproductive coughing, however,\r\ncan usually be controlled by training.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly at the beginning of phthisis that the control of\r\ncoughing by suggestion is important. There are many little coughs,\r\n\"hacks\" as they are sometimes called, frequently repeated by those in\r\na very early stage of pulmonary tuberculosis and which are consequent\r\nupon irritation either of pulmonary nerves or of pulmonary tissues,\r\nbut that are quite unnecessary, as a rule, if a little attention is\r\npaid to suppressing them. As a warning sign they are excellent, but\r\nthe patient should be taught not to indulge in them. Coughing tends to\r\nprevent nature's curative reaction and the contraction of pulmonary\r\ntissues which may take place around a lesion. In beginning\r\nconsumption, even where there is but slight infiltration, we know from\r\nthe observation of the movements of the diaphragm either by the X-ray\r\nor directly by Litton's method that its excursions on the affected\r\nside are shortened. Coughing is in direct opposition to this setting\r\nof the lung at rest and therefore should be controlled; however, as\r\nour drug remedies are likely to disturb the stomach, whose healthy\r\nfunction is so important in these cases, the use of the mind in the\r\ncontrol of the cough is of the greatest value.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoracic Discomfort.--Complaints are often made by the tuberculous of\r\npains in the thorax. Ordinarily the discomfort is supposed to be due\r\nto the lung condition, and it is assumed that it is either actually in\r\nthe lung itself or in the pleura, or communicated from them by reflex\r\nto the muscles. In most cases, however, patients complain of pain on\r\nthe side that is either not affected at all or least affected. If they\r\nhave been told that the other side is suffering most from\r\ntuberculosis, they are prone either to think that now the {362} well\r\nside is being invaded or else that their physician is making a\r\nmistake, and both thoughts are seriously discouraging. The reason for\r\nthe pains on the well or the better side, however, are easy to\r\nunderstand. As far as possible, as can be readily demonstrated by the\r\nX-rays or seen in the observation of the so-called Litten's\r\nphenomenon--the excursions of the diaphragm--nature puts the ailing\r\nlung at rest and the diaphragm moves much less on that side than on\r\nany other. In order to make up for the lack of breathing in this side\r\nthe other lung does compensatory work. This over-stretches the muscles\r\nof the thorax on the well side and causes some over-work in them. The\r\nconsequence is a tiredness which may become fatigue; in damp weather\r\nthis may be even painful. Just why damp weather has this particular\r\neffect on muscles is not surely known. Muscular action is probably\r\naccomplished with more difficulty in damp weather because of the\r\nrelaxing effect of moisture on tissues and circulation. Reassurances\r\nmay be given them, then, that will keep them from thinking seriously\r\nof the significance of these pains except as an index of nature's\r\ncompensatory efforts. The painful conditions instead of causing\r\ndiscouragement will, then, be a source of encouragement. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that rubbing with some gentle stimulant, soap, liniment,\r\nor the like, will greatly improve the thoracic muscles in these cases,\r\nbut the rubbing must be done gently and by someone else beside the\r\npatient, for it is only beneficial if done from before, backwards, in\r\norder to help the return venous circulation which runs in that\r\ndirection in the external respiratory muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAltitude.--There is a marked difference between the amount of water\r\nwhich finds its way out through the lungs at varying altitudes. At sea\r\nlevel an ordinary patient will lose during the night about 300 cc,\r\nthat is, something more than half a pint of water, through his\r\nrespiratory tract. At an altitude of 5,000 feet, however, this amount\r\nis almost doubled, and at 10,000 feet is almost trebled. At 2,000 feet\r\nit is half as much again as it is at sea level. This copious giving\r\noff of water has a marked effect on the lungs. It constitutes one of\r\nthe reasons why altitude is a favorable element in the treatment of\r\ntuberculosis. Only beginning cases of tuberculosis, however, are able\r\nto stand the additional work thus put on them, though a slight\r\nelevation, up to 2,000 or even 3,000 feet, rather seems to be of\r\nbenefit to all cases. How far-reaching the effect of this extra loss\r\nof fluid is, is appreciated from the concentration of blood which\r\ntakes place and which produces a blood count of 8,000,000 red cells at\r\na mile of altitude in patients who, at the sea level, have no more\r\nthan 4,500,000. Such patients, of course, need much more water and\r\nfluids generally to be comfortable than when living lower down.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion and Treatment.--There are many accessory suggestions with\r\nregard to food that serve to confirm the patient in the idea that\r\nabundance and variety of food must be taken if the battle with the\r\ndisease is to be won. To patients who find milk difficult to take, it\r\nmust be explained that a copious amount of fluid in the system is\r\nneeded in order to make coughing easier. So milk serves a therapeutic\r\nas well as a nutritional purpose. In the same way it may be explained\r\nthat fats, such as bacon and cream, help to keep the bowels from\r\nbecoming constipated and constipation inevitably disturbs the\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nExplanations as to the advisability of being out of the city and in a\r\nportion of country not very thickly populated, in order to avoid the\r\npossibilities of secondary infection with other respiratory diseases\r\nand bacteria of various {363} kinds, will make a patient understand\r\nthe necessity for leaving town. It may be helpful, also, to insist on\r\nthe value of living at some elevation above sea level as an aid to\r\nexpectoration.\r\n\r\nCough is the symptom that many of these patients fear most, and a\r\npromise of any amelioration of it by a simple change of location helps\r\nthem to make the sacrifice of city life for a while. Some patients who\r\nhave been benefited by a stay in a sanatorium come back with a relapse\r\nof their symptoms. They dread to return to the sanatorium and think\r\nthey can care for themselves as well at home, since they know what the\r\nregulations are, though it may be evident to the physician that they\r\nare losing ground in their city environment. It is well worth while to\r\ngive them a careful explanation of what we know of the effect of\r\naltitude upon consumptives who have sufficient reactionary power to\r\nstand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Negative Suggestions_.--Some suggestions are valuable for the\r\nprophylaxis of complications. For instance, tuberculous patients must\r\nbe warned not to indulge in breathing exercises without the express\r\nconsent of the physician. So much is said in popular literature as to\r\nthe value of breathing exercises that many a patient suffering from\r\ntuberculosis thinks that, not only may they be indulged in with\r\nimpunity, but that they will surely do good and can do no possible\r\nharm. Nothing could be more erroneous. Many localized lesions have\r\nbeen diffused in this way and there is always danger that the strain\r\nwill cause hemorrhage. Patients must be warned also to avoid any\r\npossible condition in which they might have to over-exert themselves.\r\nBecause of the dust inevitably breathed during automobile riding, this\r\npleasure must be denied to tuberculous patients as a rule, but even\r\nwhen they have recovered sufficiently so that this may be permitted\r\nthey must be warned not to take long rides into the country lest the\r\nbreaking down of the machine should place them under the necessity of\r\nwalking a long distance. This idea should also be emphasized for\r\nrowing excursions, or trips by motor boat, for occasionally they lead\r\nto serious and exhausting exposure.\r\n\r\nOne negative suggestion should be given at the very initial stage to\r\nevery patient in whom the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been\r\nrecognized. This should be a warning to exercise the greatest care\r\nagainst permitting the development of constipation. Tuberculous\r\npatients must never strain at stool. Almost necessarily a certain\r\nnumber of tubercle bacilli are swallowed every day whenever pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis is at all active and they are constantly present in the\r\ndigestive tract. If tuberculous patients then strain at stool, little\r\nabrasions of the mucous membrane of the rectum are caused in which\r\ntubercle bacilli find a favorable nidus. Ischio-rectal abscesses are\r\ncommon among the tuberculous and rectal fistulas often give much\r\nbother. When a tuberculous patient develops such a condition, a period\r\nof depression and discouragement will follow, for there is a curious\r\ntendency to depression associated with all lesions of the rectum. A\r\npulmonary patient who has been doing well will often fail to make\r\nprogress for months after the development of even a small\r\nischio-rectal abscess.\r\n\r\n{364}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNEUROTIC ASTHMA AND COGNATE CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the consideration of its psychotherapy asthma may be divided into\r\ntwo forms--symptomatic and essential, or neurotic, asthma. Symptomatic\r\nasthma is a difficulty of breathing, the result of some interference\r\nwith the circulation, as by heart disease, or with the oxidizing power\r\nof the blood, as by kidney disease, or various blood conditions, or\r\nfrom direct interference with respiration from some pulmonary\r\naffection. Essential asthma is not dependent on any organic condition,\r\nbut is an interference with breathing without any distinct\r\npathological condition in the lungs themselves or in the general\r\ncirculation. There may be some emphysema, but not enough to account\r\nfor the respiratory difficulty. It is spoken of as neurotic asthma,\r\nand the most careful investigations made of individuals who have died\r\nduring a seizure has failed to give any sure pathological basis for\r\nthe affection. Certain accompanying phenomena are worthy of note. The\r\nmost interesting of these are Curschmann's spirals, which usually\r\noccur in the form of translucent pellets very characteristically\r\ndescribed by Laennec as pearls. They are evidently formed in the finer\r\nbronchioles and show that the affection extends to the terminal\r\nportions of the bronchial system. In connection with these the\r\nso-called asthma crystals first described by Charcot and Von Leyden\r\nand sometimes called by their combined names are often found. Besides,\r\nthere are a large number of eosinophiles in the sputum itself\r\nentangled within the filaments of the spirals and an eosinophila of\r\nthe blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--Not only are we ignorant of the reasons for these phenomena\r\nbut there is even some doubt as regards the mechanism of the\r\nrespiratory spasm itself. There is a general impression that the\r\nparoxysm is due to incapacity to inspire because of a paroxysmal spasm\r\nof the respiratory muscles. Gee in his \"Medical Lectures and\r\nAphorisms\" [Footnote 30] rather leans towards the explanation that\r\nsuffering is due not to any inability to fill the lungs but to\r\nincapacity to empty them when they have become over-distended with\r\nair. He tells the story related by Dean Swift of the old man whose\r\nbarrel-shaped chest was fixed in spasm so full of air that the patient\r\ncould not find room for the slightest additional breath. \"If I ever\r\nget this air that is in me out,\" the patient declared to the Dean, \"I\r\nwill never take another breath.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 30: Frowde, Oxford Univ. Press. 1908.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to differentiate symptomatic from neurotic or\r\nessential asthma. In symptomatic asthma the only assured treatment of\r\nthe condition must come through amelioration of the organic condition\r\ncausing the symptoms. Cardiac and renal asthma respond promptly to\r\nremedies which relieve critical conditions that may be present in the\r\nheart or kidneys. It must not be forgotten, however, that respiration\r\nis readily disturbed by mental influences. Where cardiac or renal\r\ndisease causes interference with respiration this is much emphasized\r\nby the patient's unfavorable mental attitude toward it, or much\r\nrelieved by keeping him from worrying over his condition. Even\r\nsymptomatic asthma, then, has a definite place in psychotherapeutics,\r\nthough {365} it would be serious not to recognize the underlying\r\nconditions and treat them. If the patient's attitude of mind is one of\r\ndiscouragement, the respiratory difficulties will continue to be a\r\nmarked symptom of the case, even though the proper remedies for the\r\nrelief of cardiac or renal conditions are administered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatic Picture.--What is likely to be one of the most disturbing\r\nexperiences of the young physician early in practice, especially if he\r\nhas not before seen a typical case, is to be called to a patient\r\nsuffering from a severe attack of asthma. Often the sufferer is\r\nsitting up in bed so as to get all the air possible, and, though the\r\nwindows are wide open, he is gasping for breath, usually pleading for\r\nmore air with a tense, anxious expression, starting eyes, and the\r\nsweat pouring from his forehead, while the accessory muscles of\r\nrespiration, deeply engaged in moving his thorax to move air enough to\r\nkeep him from stifling, emphasize his dyspnea. Occasionally a degree\r\nof cyanosis develops that is quite startling for the untrained\r\nobserver. Most of those who see the symptomatic picture for the first\r\ntime think that death is impending, and the patient himself, if he has\r\nnot had a series of attacks, will fear a fatal termination. It appears\r\nimpossible to believe that the next morning, within six or seven hours\r\nof this, the patient will, as a rule, be quite well and walking round\r\nin the enjoyment of apparent good health.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the worse these cases seem in their intensity and the more\r\nthe patient is anxious, the more surely are they merely of functional\r\nnervous origin; above all, the more complaints of lack of air and of\r\nfear of impending death that are made, the more likely is the patient\r\nto be all right within a few hours. Asthma looks as though it must be\r\ndue to some serious organic condition. Of course, in many cases of\r\ndifficult breathing, even with asthma-like attacks, there are\r\nunderlying serious conditions of heart and kidneys that are extremely\r\ndangerous. As a rule, however, these do not produce the woeful\r\npictures of purely neurotic asthma. Even when the basis of the asthma\r\nis an emphysema, which of itself is not dangerous and is quite\r\ncompatible with long life, the attacks, though frequent and severe,\r\nare usually not so serious looking as those in which absolutely no\r\npathological condition of the lungs, or heart, or kidneys can be\r\nfound, and, indeed, in which there is absolutely no organic change to\r\naccount for the extremely uncomfortable and even terrifying symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence.--In the medical literature of asthma there are\r\nabundant proofs that the attitude of mind of the patient towards his\r\naffection means very much. There is the story, thoroughly vouched for,\r\nof the two friends stopping at a little country hotel late at night.\r\nOne of them was a neurotic subject, who, whenever he remained for some\r\ntime in a stuffy atmosphere, was likely to have a severe asthmatic\r\nattack. The quarters assigned to them proved to be one of the cramped\r\nlittle rooms with a single small window that occasionally are found in\r\nthe attics of country inns in England. During the night the patient of\r\nasthmatic tendencies had one of his attacks and begged his friend to\r\nopen the window. The friend, suddenly roused from sleep, did not\r\nremember the position of the window and, the night being very dark, he\r\nfelt for it and finally found it. He could not raise the sash and he\r\ncould not move it either inward or outward and there seemed no way of\r\ngetting it open. His friend was insistently clamoring for air with\r\nthat tone of despair and {366} dread of impending death so\r\ncharacteristic of the young, inexperienced asthma sufferer. Unable to\r\nget the window open, the sympathetic companion finally took his shoe\r\nand smashed the glass. The relief was immediate. Scarcely had the\r\ncrash of the broken glass been heard before the patient gave an\r\naudible sigh of relief. When his friend went over to him he felt so\r\nmuch better that it was rather easy for the sufferer to persuade him\r\nthat nothing more would be needed and that he should go back to bed.\r\nIn the morning, when the friend awoke, his first glance, directed by\r\nthe sunlight that came streaming into the window, was toward the\r\nbroken panes of the night before. To his surprise it was not broken.\r\nWondering what had happened, he looked round the room to find that he\r\nhad smashed two panes in an old bookcase set into the wall, and that\r\nit was the breaking of the glass with the suggestion of free ingress\r\nof air that it involved and not any real provision of fresh air that\r\nhad cured his friend's asthma so promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestion_.--When much-vaunted cures for asthma are analyzed, many\r\nof them are found to depend more on suggestion than on any other\r\nelement. Various forms of cigarettes are used, comparatively innocuous\r\nin themselves, and certainly of no strong therapeutic action, yet they\r\nwork marvels in loosening the spasm that comes over the lungs in\r\nasthmatic attacks. Any sort of a cigarette will do at the beginning. I\r\nhave seen dried grape-vine stems work very well in the country,\r\nespecially in young women to whom the idea of smoking anything was\r\nstrongly suggestive. Cubebs cigarettes have the same effect on older\r\npeople. Doubtless there is some relaxing action in the smoke. This is\r\nnot enough, however, to account for the effect produced without mental\r\ninfluence. After cubebs have been tried for a period and begin to lose\r\ntheir efficacy, then other materials that produce a pungent smoke or\r\nhave a certain sensory action, as stramonium leaves, may be used, and\r\nwill also have the marvelous power of cubebs. After a time, however,\r\nthey, too, lose their efficacy, and, as a rule, each successive\r\ncigarette that is tried has less power than the first to control the\r\ndifficulty of breathing.\r\n\r\nThe more one hears of cures for asthma, and the longer one has\r\nexperience with these cases, the clearer does it become that there is\r\na large suggestive element in every successful treatment. If a piece\r\nof ordinary blotting paper be dipped in a strong solution of saltpeter\r\nand allowed to dry, it will, if touched by a lighted match, burn\r\nslowly without flame, but with the production of heavy, thick smoke.\r\nThe therapeutic elements in this are not very strong, but the\r\nsuggestive element, when a room gets full of it, is intense and is\r\ncumulative. Very probably the thick smoke, rich in nitrites, has some\r\ntendency to relax the spasm in the lungs which causes the asthmatic\r\nseizure, but after a time the remedy fails and something else has to\r\nbe tried. In many cases, when first used, it almost works a miracle.\r\nThis is the simplest type of suggestive treatment for asthma.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Shock_.--Any strong mental influence, especially if\r\naccompanied by the suggestion of assured relief, is likely to do much\r\nfor asthma of essentially neurotic character, and indeed is more\r\npowerful in dispelling the symptoms of the seizure than almost any\r\nother means that we have. Sometimes even things absolutely indifferent\r\nwhich produce a profound mental impression, prove curative. There are\r\nmany stories of men in the midst of a severe asthmatic seizure being\r\nsuddenly roused by the cry of fire, or an alarm of some {367} kind\r\nnear them, having the spasmodic conditions disappear as if by magic.\r\nOccasionally where attacks of asthma recurred regularly on successive\r\nnights for a considerable period, travel on a railroad train or\r\nanything else which occupied the attention much, prolonged the\r\ninterval between seizures and sometimes put an end to the series of\r\nattacks. The more one knows of asthma the more one realizes how much\r\nits occurrence depends on mental influences of many kinds in\r\nassociation with various reflex irritations, some of them very distant\r\nfrom the respiratory tract and comparatively trivial in their effects\r\non other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Control_.--Occasionally in elderly neurotic people\r\nover-fatigue induces an attack of asthma about the time that sleep\r\nbecomes deep. This usually occurs after the first hour or two of\r\nsleep. The inhibitory power of the nervous system over spasmodic\r\ncontraction of the lung tissues seems lost in deep sleep and then the\r\nasthmatic condition develops. The greater the effort to breathe the\r\nmore intense does the contraction become, until the antispasmodic\r\neffect of the presence of a lessened amount of oxygen and an abnormal\r\nquantity of carbon dioxide in the blood makes itself felt. In many\r\ncases these patients will be relieved of the tendency to such spasm by\r\ntaking a cup of coffee. This stimulates the general circulation and\r\nminimizes the reflex tendency which centers in their respiratory\r\ntracts. Such patients after taking an amount of coffee that would keep\r\nordinary people awake all night, sink in the course of half an hour\r\ninto a quiet, restful sleep and awake quite refreshed. This is not\r\nentirely suggestive, but suggestion plays an added role in the relief\r\nof all the symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--_Varied Cures_.--We do not mean to say that asthma is\r\nentirely amenable to suggestive treatment, but we emphasize the mental\r\ninfluences in its production and its cure. A new and almost infallible\r\ncure is announced nearly every year for asthma, as for tuberculosis.\r\nSometimes this is some new treatment for the nose, occasionally it is\r\na novel method of treating the throat, but reflexes from a great many\r\nother organs not at all in touch with the respiratory system have also\r\nbeen supposed to be productive of asthma, and their treatment has been\r\nfollowed by relief from this trying condition. Washing out the\r\nstomach, for instance, has been followed by prolonged cessation of\r\nasthmatic attacks. In children it is claimed that occasionally the\r\ncorrection of eye-strain by the proper glasses has cured neurotic\r\nasthma. There are those who have had cases where the relief of\r\nlong-continued constipation had a like therapeutic result and there\r\nare other and even more curious claims for curative effect in this\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Negative and Positive Suggestion_.--Any condition in the human body\r\nthat sets nerves in tension and requires constant inhibition may lead\r\nto such a cumulative effect of repression that reaction follows and\r\nexplosion takes place. In particularly susceptible individuals,\r\nirritable respiratory centers may be affected with consequent\r\nasthmatic seizures. The direct treatment of the respiratory tract to\r\nsecure ease of respiration often does away with the liability to\r\nasthma by direct prevention. If patients, especially young patients,\r\nare mouth-breathers the clearing out of the throat and nose so as to\r\ninsure normal breathing can naturally be expected to lessen any\r\ntendency to asthma. In the same way treatment of irritative or\r\ndegenerative conditions in the throat and larynx, as well as in the\r\nnose, may be considered directly curative. On {368} the other hand,\r\nthere is no doubt that many of the slight ameliorations of intranasal\r\nconditions suggested by enthusiastic specialists as curing asthma do\r\nnot have any direct therapeutic influence but owe their efficacy to\r\nthe strong suggestion of the operator's assurance on the patient's\r\nmind that this treatment has cured asthma in many cases and will\r\nsurely cure him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drugs and Suggestion_.--The medicines that are especially effective\r\nin asthma of neurotic origin are those which also have a large\r\nsuggestive influence because of their taste or their effects upon the\r\nsystem. Hoffman's anodyne is an efficient antispasmodic and is\r\nwonderfully effective in relieving the tendency to asthma. I have\r\nalways felt, however, though I have given it freely, that a large\r\nelement in its effectiveness was its particularly disagreeable taste\r\nand odor and then its excretion through the lungs with a certain sense\r\nof well-being allied somewhat to the intoxication that comes from the\r\ninhalation of ether. I have seen asthmatic tendencies in young women\r\ngreatly relieved by the use of valerian. Undoubtedly this remedy, like\r\nthe compound spirits of ether, is antispasmodic in action, yet to a\r\nmuch less degree than Hoffman's mixture, and over and over again I\r\nhave noted that in pill form, though given in large doses, it was not\r\nas effective as if given in liquid form when its nauseating smell\r\nadded distinctly to its suggestive influence. The drug itself does\r\ngood but it is distinctly helped by the influence upon the patient's\r\nmind of its taste and, above all, of its aroma. The elixir of ammonium\r\nvalerianate being particularly unpleasant is likely to be more\r\nbeneficial to these patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climatotherapy and Suggestion_.--The climatic treatment of asthma has\r\nreceived much attention. Change of scene and environment nearly always\r\ndoes good. Different patients, however, require very different\r\nconditions. Of two cases of neurotic asthma in which no diagnostic\r\ndifferences can be found, one will improve at the seashore or on a sea\r\nvoyage, while the other will be made worse by such a change though\r\nprobably the asthma will be improved in the mountains or in some dry\r\nclimate. Even moving from one part of a city to another has brought\r\ngreat improvement in asthma. Sometimes there were good reasons for\r\nthis, as, for instance, when an investigation showed that the patient\r\nhad previously been living above a bakery from which there came a good\r\ndeal of hot air and flour dust. Some people are actually improved by\r\nclose contact with human beings in rather crowded quarters. I have\r\nknown a settlement worker to experience great relief from asthma when\r\nliving in the slums. Where there is intense occupation of mind,\r\nespecially if combined with the suggestion that now the asthma ought\r\nto be better, seizures will be less frequent and less severe. All\r\nsorts of places in the mountains and by the seashore have acquired\r\nreputations as relieving asthma which were justified by many cured\r\ncases and yet they have lost this reputation. Whenever there are many\r\nsufferers together, the expectancy of relief seems to do great good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDUST ASTHMA, SEASONAL CATARRH, HAY FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nGrouped under the term \"hay fever\" there are probably as many\r\ndifferent affections as there are under the term \"chronic rheumatism.\"\r\nThere are {369} people who, in the springtime, as soon as the weather\r\ngets warm, suffer from what is popularly called hay fever. This is\r\noften called \"spring catarrh\" or \"rose cold\" and seems often to be\r\nassociated with the pollen of flowers. Then there are people whose hay\r\nfever, as it is called, develops about the first of June and continues\r\nto be bothersome until the middle of July, when there is a remission\r\nof symptoms, though in dry prolonged hot periods after that the\r\naffection may recur. It seems as if, at the beginning of the heated\r\nterm, the warm, dry dusty air irritates their nostrils very much,\r\nwhile after some weeks they gradually become used to this and the\r\nreaction is not so violent. Then there are the regular hay-fever\r\npatients whose affection occurs principally in haying time, during\r\nAugust and September, though most of them have not been near hay\r\npollen, and the disease is an affection of dwellers in cities rather\r\nthan in the country, of indoor livers more than of farming people, who\r\nmight be expected to suffer most from the supposed cause, hay pollen.\r\nEven where pollen is directly concerned in its causation it is\r\nprobably oftener the pollen of the rag weed rather than that of hay\r\nthat is responsible for it.\r\n\r\nThere are two elements in the disease apparently of equal importance.\r\nOne of these is a strictly local condition interfering with\r\nrespiration in some way, or with the circulation to the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nose and the lachrymal ducts. The other is an\r\nindividual over-sensitiveness so that there is an exaggerated reaction\r\nto irritation. Some of this is mental, that is, is due to expectancy,\r\nor to the persuasion that this reaction is sure to occur under certain\r\ncircumstances. As a consequence, attacks of hay fever are reported\r\neven after a distant view of a hayfield, or of rose cold due to the\r\nsight of an artificial rose, and of other recurrences that show the\r\npower of the mind to bring about at least a beginning of symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhile the first or physical element in the etiology of dust catarrh\r\ncan be treated successfully by various means, it is important to get\r\nthe mind of the individual in a favorable state so as to enable him to\r\nobtain better control over his vaso-motor system which is so much\r\ninfluenced by emotions and thoughts. It is this latter element in the\r\ncausation of the disease that has been successfully treated by the\r\nmany remedies that for a time have had reported success in the cure of\r\nhay fever yet afterwards proved to be of no benefit because they had\r\nlost their influence over the patients' minds.\r\n\r\nIn a review of Morell MacKenzie's book \"Hay Fever, with an Appendix on\r\nRose Cold,\" Dr. J. N. MacKenzie   [Footnote 31] has some paragraphs on\r\nhay fever which, though written twenty-five years ago, are worth\r\nrecalling for a proper understanding of the disease. He preferred to\r\ncall the disease rhinitis sympathetica or coryza vaso-motoria\r\nperiodica, names which are much better descriptive terms and have no\r\nunsubstantiated suggestions of etiology in them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: _American Journal of Medical Sciences_, 1886.]\r\n\r\n  According to our conception, the so-called nasal reflex neuroses,\r\n  whether taken singly or collectively, as the cause of the _ensemble_\r\n  of phenomena known as \"hay fever,\" may be regarded as the protean\r\n  manifestation of a morbid condition to which we have given the name\r\n  rhinitis sympathetica, and which is characterized by a hyperesthetic\r\n  condition of the vaso-motor nerve centers linked to a peculiar\r\n  excitability of the nasal cavernous tissue. For, if we inquire what\r\n  condition or conditions is common to them all, and what morbid\r\n  process is capable of producing them, either singly or in\r\n  combination; how phenomena apparently {370} so widely different in\r\n  character and anatomical sphere of operation may be traced to a\r\n  solitary source, we find the answer in certain more or less clearly\r\n  defined changes in the nasal apparatus and in a certain exalted\r\n  state of the sympathetic nervous system, to which latter we\r\n  instinctively turn as the organ most conspicuously concerned in the\r\n  evolution of purely reflex acts. In whatever relation the local\r\n  nasal affection and the condition of the sympathetic stand to each\r\n  other in the matter of cause and effect, they must both be regarded\r\n  as inseparable factors in the production of the phenomena under\r\n  consideration. It matters not to what hypothesis the path of\r\n  speculation may lead. Of this we can be reasonably sure, that in the\r\n  production of the characteristic symptoms of this disease, a certain\r\n  excitability of the nasal passages is necessary, plus an exalted\r\n  state of the central nervous system.\r\n\r\nDr. MacKenzie calls attention particularly to the erectile character\r\nof the tissues mainly involved in all these forms of dust catarrh and\r\ndwells on the role that mental influence always plays in the phenomena\r\nnoted in such tissues. This with the vaso-motor elements in the\r\naffection which are so largely also under the control of the emotional\r\nnature make it clear that the pathology of the affection must be\r\nconsidered from this standpoint and, therefore, its therapy also.\r\n\r\nDr. MacKenzie continues:\r\n\r\n  From our present knowledge of the disease, it seems difficult to\r\n  escape the conclusion that its pathology is intimately interwoven\r\n  with a morbid condition of the vaso-motor sympathetic, and probably\r\n  a hypersensitive state of the nerve centers themselves. When we\r\n  recall the fact that in the famous section of the sympathetic in the\r\n  neck by Claude Bernard, symptoms similar to, or closely allied to,\r\n  the phenomena of hay fever were produced; when we reflect upon the\r\n  results reached by Prevost in his experiments on the spheno-palatine\r\n  ganglion, is there not a clue to lead us through the labyrinth of\r\n  our difficulties to a rational solution of the question? . . .\r\n\r\n  . . .In the human body, wherever erectile tissue is found, it is\r\n  intimately related to reflex or sympathetic acts; there seems to be\r\n  connected with it a certain receptivity to reflex producing\r\n  impressions, a certain power of reflex excitability dependent upon\r\n  its structure and functions. It is thus peculiarly a tissue of\r\n  sympathy in which we may most satisfactorily study the mechanism of\r\n  purely reflex or sympathetic acts. Now it seems to us that, as the\r\n  nasal corpora cavernosa belong to this class of sympathetic tissues,\r\n  there will be little difficulty in explaining the role which they\r\n  play in the paroxysms of an affection which is probably connected\r\n  with, if not dependent upon, an excitation of the sympathetic nerve\r\n  centers, and in more clearly defining the intimate relation which\r\n  its erection bears to the reflex manifestations of the disease under\r\n  review.\r\n\r\nThese considerations explain the heredity of the affection in many\r\ncases, since it is dependent on defects that may be family traits, yet\r\nthey also enable us to understand how slight lesions of the nasal\r\nmucous membrane may be the center from which radiate the underlying\r\npathological conditions of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailroad Asthma.--There is a form of dust asthma which deserves\r\nspecial attention here because it is due to modern conditions and\r\nhelps to an understanding of the etiology. It occurs in sensitive\r\npersons when they travel on railroad trains in warm weather,\r\nparticularly if it has been dry for several days and dust is abundant.\r\nIt has been called railroad asthma or railroad catarrh by the English\r\nand the Germans, but the condition has no necessary connection with\r\nthe railroad. It occurs as a consequence of the infiltration into\r\nrailroad cars of fine dust during the passage of the train. {371} I\r\nhave seen it in those who had made long trips over dusty roads in\r\nautomobiles, though the dust of the railroad seems finer and more\r\npenetrating. It develops just as much at the end of a long train as if\r\nthe passenger spent most of the journey in the car next the engine and\r\napparently it makes no difference whether the engine burns hard or\r\nsoft coal. They use soft coal almost exclusively in England and\r\nGermany, but one sees cases of it here after travel on roads that burn\r\nhard coal and are especially cleanly in this respect. Soft coal adds\r\nsomewhat to the amount of dust and therefore this increases the\r\nirritation, but there is nothing specific about coal dust. It is\r\nsurprising how severe the symptoms may be. I have seen a patient who\r\nhad traveled continuously for four days across the continent who had\r\nso much photophobia when he alighted from the train, that he was\r\nalmost unable to open his eyes, and it was not until twelve hours had\r\npassed that he could open his eyes with any comfort, yet at the end of\r\ntwo days practically all the symptoms had passed off.\r\n\r\nProf. Fraenkel, professor of laryngology and rhinology at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, who was one of the first to classify the\r\ncondition among the affections related to \"hay fever,\" described\r\ncertain features of it very well in a clinical lecture reported in\r\n_International Clinics_, Vol. II, Ninth Series, 1899. As a rhinologist\r\nhe insists on the nasal conditions that underlie the affection yet\r\nsuggests that the nasal hyperemia may be due to reflexes of one kind\r\nor another. The basis of these is undoubtedly very often an emotional\r\ncondition of the patient, a dread of dust, an expectancy of symptoms\r\nand a consequent exaggerated reaction. Unorganized dust produces\r\nasthma, but organic materials bring more severe and lasting effects,\r\npartly because of the mental effect of odors and other sensory\r\nconditions in connection with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Personal Element and Power of Suggestion.--The history of these\r\nasthmas and other symptoms produced by odors and dust make it clear\r\nthat the more that is known about the disease the surer it becomes\r\nthat there is a large personal element, usually dependent on a certain\r\nframe of mind, in the cases. Some people are affected by one form of\r\nirritant, some by another, some by pollen, others by animal\r\nemanations, and not a few by a persuasion of the likelihood of\r\nsuffering from these things, since occasionally the sight of an\r\nartificial product produces a like result. Certain classes suffer much\r\nmore than others. Those who are much confined to the house and who are\r\nespecially prone to reflection upon themselves and their feelings form\r\nthe great majority of the patients. In old days the monks were\r\nfavorite victims, in modern times literary folk, students, and those\r\nwho have the time and the inclination for reading and introspection\r\nare particularly likely to suffer. How much the mental element may\r\naccount for in these cases is not clear, but it stands for much more\r\nthan has been thought and there seems no doubt that more relief of\r\nsymptoms is afforded by diversion of mind and change of dwelling quite\r\napart from external conditions than in any other way. It is important\r\nto remember that no specific dust but almost any kind of dust produces\r\nthese conditions in sensitive persons.\r\n\r\nDr. MacKenzie describes an interesting case in which all the symptoms\r\nwere produced by the presence of an artificial rose. The story is so\r\nstriking and he has told it so well that I prefer to tell it in his\r\nown words. I may say, however, that the clinical history of the case\r\nwas typical. About the end of {372} May or the beginning of June every\r\nyear the patient suffered from a coryza preceded for a few days by an\r\nindefinite sense of general depression with a disagreeable feeling of\r\nheaviness in the head. Sometimes there were chilly feelings and\r\ngeneral malaise. The catarrhal stage commenced with profuse watery\r\ndischarge from the nostrils, copious flow of tears with redness of the\r\nconjunctiva, itching of the puncta lacrymalia and photophobia. The\r\nexterior of the nose, especially at the tip, became intensely red and\r\ntoward the close of the attack the cuticle desquamated. There was a\r\nshort, dry, hacking cough relieved by sneezing, an intense tickling\r\nsensation in the throat, the voice became husky, the pharynx dry, the\r\nears stopped up and tinnitus occurred. Her attacks continued most of\r\nthe summer and were always brought on by the pollen of any plant and\r\nabove all by the smell of a rose. It was, indeed, an example and of\r\nthe most aggravated form. She was brought to Dr. MacKenzie in\r\nconsultation and I leave him to tell the rest of the story.\r\n\r\n  Decidedly skeptical as to the power of pollen to produce a paroxysm\r\n  in her particular case, I practiced the following deception upon\r\n  her, which still further confirmed me in that belief. For the\r\n  purpose of the experiment I obtained an artificial rose of such\r\n  exquisite workmanship that it presented a perfect counterfeit of the\r\n  original. To exclude every possible error, each leaf was carefully\r\n  wiped, so that not a single particle of foreign matter was secreted\r\n  within the convolutions of the artificial flower. When the patient\r\n  entered my consultation room, she expressed herself as feeling\r\n  unusually well. The evening before she attempted to wear some roses,\r\n  but had been obliged to remove them from her dress, as they had\r\n  produced a great deal of discomfort. Apart from this incident she\r\n  had been perfectly comfortable for several days and nights. Her\r\n  conjunctivae were normal, the nasal passages free, and there was\r\n  nothing to indicate the presence of her trouble. She conversed with\r\n  me for some time about her case and on general topics, speaking in\r\n  the most encouraging manner concerning the progress she was\r\n  apparently making toward recovery. I proceeded to remove the slight\r\n  slough from the cautery operation, which lay loose in the nostril,\r\n  and made an application to the mucous membrane, and all without\r\n  exciting the slightest tendency to reflex movements. After I felt\r\n  sure that such tendency was absent, I produced the artificial rose\r\n  from behind a screen, where it had been secreted, and, sitting\r\n  before her, held it in my hand, at the same time continuing the\r\n  conversation. In the course of a minute she said she must sneeze.\r\n  This sensation was followed almost immediately by a tickling and\r\n  intense itching in the back of the throat and at the end of the\r\n  nose. The nasal passages at the same time became suddenly\r\n  obstructed, and the voice assumed a hoarse nasal tone. In less than\r\n  two minutes the puncta lacrymalia began to itch violently, the right\r\n  and afterward the left conjunctiva became intensely hyperemic and\r\n  photophobia and increased lacrymation supervened. To these symptoms\r\n  were added, almost immediately, itching in the auditory meatuses and\r\n  the secretion of a thin fluid in the previously dry nasal passages.\r\n  In a few minutes the feeling of oppression in the chest began with\r\n  slight embarrassment of respiration. In other words, in the space of\r\n  five minutes she was suffering from a severe coryza, the counterpart\r\n  of that which the presence of natural roses invariably produced in\r\n  her case. An examination of the throat and nasal passages was then\r\n  made. The right nostril was completely obstructed by the swollen,\r\n  reddened, irritable, turbinated structures; the left was only\r\n  slightly pervious to the air current; both were filled with a\r\n  serous-looking fluid. The mucous membrane of the throat was also\r\n  injected, but did not exhibit the same amount of redness and\r\n  irritability found in the nasal passages. As the discomfort was\r\n  rapidly increasing, and as I considered the result of the experiment\r\n  sufficiently satisfactory. I removed the rose and placed it in a\r\n  distant part of the room. When told that the rose was an artificial\r\n  one, her amazement was great, and her incredulity on the subject was\r\n  only removed upon personal examination of the counterfeit {373}\r\n  flower. She left my office with a severe coryza, but also with the\r\n  assurance that her disease was not altogether irremediable. A few\r\n  days later she called to see me again, and on that occasion she\r\n  buried her nostrils in a large, fragrant specimen of the genuine\r\n  article and inhaled its pollen without the slightest tendency to the\r\n  production of reflex acts.\r\n\r\nThere is but one conclusion that can be drawn from this: that\r\nsuggestion plays a large role in the relief of the symptoms of the\r\ndisease. If patients once become persuaded that something will do them\r\ngood, then it surely does. It is true that this good effect will\r\nusually not persist, but that is because after a time conditions\r\nconspire to make the suggestion fail of its purpose. This does not at\r\nall imply that hay fever, or just catarrh as I prefer to call it, is\r\nimaginary. The relief of our most serious and fatal diseases with\r\nprofound pathological lesions, such as tuberculosis, may well be\r\nbrought about by suggestion. After all, just the same story is told\r\nabout consumption and its many remedies as of hay fever and its many\r\n\"cures.\" However, the most important therapeutic element so far\r\ndiscovered for the treatment of hay fever is evidently suggestion. If\r\nthe patient's mind can only be brought to a favorable attitude in\r\nwhich the discouragement incident to imperfect oxidation can be\r\ngreatly lessened, then relief of many of the symptoms will be afforded\r\nand under favorable conditions the patient will deem himself cured.\r\nUndoubtedly the large amount of attention given to hay fever, the\r\ngathering of these patients in particular localities, the repetition\r\nof the story of their symptoms to each other, the body of literature\r\nthat has gathered around hay fever and is read with such avidity by\r\nthose who are pleased to call themselves its victims, adds to the\r\nunfavorable suggestions and inveterates the symptoms, exaggerates the\r\nnasal hyperemia and makes the general condition worse.\r\n\r\nI am the more positive about the influence of suggestion, favorable\r\nand unfavorable, in the affection after having carefully noted the\r\nconditions in certain patients from year to year for a number of\r\nyears. I became interested in it because it is a family affection and\r\nseveral sisters as well as myself are sufferers from it. At the\r\nbeginning, when the real nature of the trouble is not recognized,\r\nthere is a year or two of considerable general discomfort, though not\r\nmuch local disturbance. Then comes the realization of what the\r\nrecurrent affection is and a period of distinct depression during its\r\ncontinuance. Eventually it begins to be appreciated that a number of\r\nlocal applications will lessen the symptoms from day to day and that\r\nthere need be no apprehension of serious sleep disturbance, or of any\r\nlasting effect upon the general health, the affection becomes quite\r\nbearable and, while still annoying, is no longer the object of\r\nparticular solicitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDYSPNEA--CAT AND HORSE ASTHMA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a class of cases of difficulty of breathing allied to asthma\r\nand often called by that name, the study of which throws light on the\r\norigin and the relief of neurotic asthma. These cases are usually\r\naccompanied by such a sense of oppression on the chest that breathing\r\nbecomes labored and, to some {374} extent at least, the accessory\r\nmuscles of respiration have to be called into play. The most typical\r\ncases are connected with the mental influence produced by the presence\r\nof some particular animal, the cat being the most frequent and the\r\nhorse not rare, or with emanations from these animals, when there\r\nseems to be some physical nexus between the animal and the symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCat Asthma.--The symptoms associated with cats are rather common, and\r\nthey occur at the sight or touch of the animal, but may be the result\r\nonly of its presence which in some way the patient is able to\r\nrecognize without sight of him. Shakespeare's expressions in a number\r\nof places, such as \"I could endure anything before but a cat\" and\r\n\"some that are mad if they behold but a cat,\" shows that the affection\r\nwas commonly recognized at that time and that the reason for it was\r\nconsidered unknowable, for Shakespeare says, \"There is no firm reason\r\nto be rendered why he cannot abide ... a harmless necessary cat.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Byron Bramwell in his \"Clinical Studies,\" Vol. I, page 107, has an\r\ninteresting paragraph with regard to these curious asthmatic\r\nconditions which develop in the presence of animals of various kinds.\r\nHe sums up many of the curious features of this affection as reported\r\nby various good observers. Many more people than we would be apt to\r\nthink are affected by it. He says:\r\n\r\n  In some persons the smell of a horse or of a cat produces an attack\r\n  of asthma. Some years ago I repeatedly saw a young gentleman who\r\n  invariably had an attack of asthma if he went near a stable or a\r\n  horse. He was so susceptible that he was unable to drive in a cab or\r\n  a carriage; when traveling from place to place, while sending his\r\n  traps from the station to the hotel in a cab, he himself was obliged\r\n  to walk.\r\n\r\nDr. Goodhart mentions a similar instance which occurred in the\r\npractice of Prof. Clifford Allbutt. Dr. Goodhart also mentions a\r\nremarkable case of \"cat asthma\":\r\n\r\n  I have known of two cases of cat asthma. In one of them the\r\n  existence of cats is the bane of life, for before accepting an\r\n  invitation she is obliged first to ask, \"Is there a cat?\"\r\n  [Footnote 32] An attack of urticaria and coryza followed by asthma\r\n  has been noticed to come on within ten minutes of having stroked a\r\n  cat. At other times, sitting in a room in which there was a cat,\r\n  without any actual contact with it, was sufficient to produce a bad\r\n  attack, beginning within ten minutes of entering the room.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: A case of this kind came under observation as this\r\n    book was nearly ready for the press. The patient, a young woman in\r\n    an office, had to refuse a vacation with a wealthy friend in\r\n    Florida, because she knew that friend could not be separated from\r\n    her pet cats, five in number, and the patient would have been\r\n    intensely miserable were she near them, so that even the joys of\r\n    Florida in the winter did not make up for the constant,\r\n    intolerable discomfort they would have caused her.]\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of this intolerance of a cat. One of them takes on\r\nthe character of a dread and is discussed in the chapter on Dreads.\r\nThe other is accompanied by dyspnea or asthma with a sense of\r\ndiscomfort and tightness of the chest that cannot be overcome. It is\r\nnot merely an imagination, for sometimes even when they cannot see the\r\ncat, or at times when friends have been careful to exclude cats from\r\nthe room, these people become impressed with the idea that a cat is\r\nnear and a search usually shows that their impression is true, though\r\njust what was the means through which they came to know it is\r\ndifficult to understand.\r\n\r\n{375}\r\n\r\nDr. Weir Mitchell's review of the subject of \"Cat Asthma and Allied\r\nConditions\" in a paper read before the Association of American\r\nPhysicians brought out many curious details. There is no doubt about\r\nthe power to recognize the presence of the unseen cat. Besides the\r\nrespiratory oppression, some patients develop urticarial lesions and\r\noccasionally even conjunctivitis and a catarrhal condition of the\r\nnasal mucous membrane. These seem to be due to the direct irritant\r\neffect of animal emanations. As the symptoms of rose cold or hay fever\r\nhave sometimes developed after the sight of an artificial rose, or\r\neven, it it said, the picture of a hay field, so, in some of these\r\ncases, the sight of a picture of a cat has produced at least some of\r\nthese symptoms. Probably the most interesting feature of the affection\r\nis that the large cats, the tiger and the lion, do not have any effect\r\non the patient. There seems to be no doubt, then, that the mind plays\r\nan important role in the matter and that relief must be secured\r\nthrough mental influence.\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases a careful searching of the past of the patient\r\nwill show that there has been some terrifying incident connected with\r\nthe cat. In one case in my own experience the patient's earliest\r\nrecollection, and the first time that death was brought home to her,\r\nwas when a favorite bird was killed by a cat. Ever after that she had\r\na horror of the animals, the family cat had to be disposed of, and her\r\nfamily never had another. She used to suffer from a severe dyspnea at\r\nthe sight of a cat and was sure that she could recognize its presence\r\nwithout having seen it. She mentioned a number of occasions on which\r\nthat had been true. The very idea of living where a cat could come\r\nnear her was appalling. She was sure that she was even waked by the\r\nmere propinquity of a cat if by any chance one got into her room at\r\nnight, though without any noise.\r\n\r\nA change in her material circumstances compelled her to teach in\r\nprivate families. Under these circumstances her cat detestation made\r\ndifficulties for her. I suggested, since she had had no feeling toward\r\ncats before the bird incident, that probably her symptoms were due to\r\nsuggestion and an acquired habit of mind and that she might by\r\ndiscipline overcome them. She was sure that would be impossible. With\r\ndetermined effort, however, and practice in withstanding her feelings\r\nin the presence of cats she finally learned to overcome practically\r\nall of her feelings so that though it still requires an effort she can\r\neven pick up a cat and stroke it. I have had several other patients\r\nwith less marked forms of the affection who have by self-discipline\r\novercome their feelings to a great degree. It is always well to search\r\nthe past of these patients in order to find out whether there may not\r\nbe a dominant idea derived from some unfortunate experience, which\r\nacts as an auto-suggestion in the production of their symptoms of\r\nconstriction of the chest and sometimes even the recurrence of the\r\nswelling of the mucous membrane of the nose that produces difficulty\r\nof breathing. Whenever this can be found, contrary suggestion can be\r\ngiven and the patients can be persuaded to try, by frequently repeated\r\nauto-suggestion, to relieve themselves of the trouble.\r\n\r\nOccasionally these curious manifestations of a catarrhal or asthmatic\r\ncharacter in the presence of cats occur in people who like cats. Dr.\r\nTaylor in his \"Types of Habit Neuro-Psychoses\" published in the\r\n_Proceedings of the Massachusetts Medical Society_, 1896-98, tells the\r\nstory of a young woman in whom he saw conjunctivitis developing while\r\nshe was fondling a cat. In many cases {376} besides the hyperemia of\r\nthe nose and of the respiratory mucous membrane generally there is\r\nmarked injections of the ocular conjunctiva. It is rather difficult to\r\nunderstand the phenomena of asthmatic attacks in connection with cats\r\nand other animals in terms of a habit formed, because at some time\r\nasthmatic or hyperemic manifestations occurred in association with the\r\nhandling of these animals and that then, somehow, suggestion works to\r\nreproduce the same symptoms in the presence of the animals later; but\r\nthis is undoubtedly the only rational explanation that we have for\r\nmany of these cases. It represents the most helpful explanation, so\r\nfar as treatment is concerned, for by means of suggestion either in\r\nthe waking state or in the first stage of hypnosis, in many cases\r\nrelief can be brought to these patients. Repeated profound hypnotism\r\nis a vaunted remedy for these conditions in the hands of professional\r\nhypnotists, but serious physicians who have tried hypnotism do not\r\nrecommend it. It helps for a time but relapse follows. Only continued\r\nsuggestion and a carefully cultivated habit of self-discipline and\r\ncontrol succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorse Asthma.--The cases of dyspnea in connection with horses are not\r\nless interesting. Occasionally, even when all aversion is absent,\r\nemanations from horses are capable of producing a curious effect on\r\ncertain individuals. How much of this is psychic is not clear. I was\r\nonce consulted with regard to a patient who suffered from asthma\r\nwhenever she went to a dance. It mattered not how careful she was in\r\nnot exposing herself to night air, or in wrapping herself up warmly;\r\ninvariably a few hours after her return home, she was wakened from\r\nsound sleep by an attack of difficult breathing that required the\r\nopening of windows and the use of the accessory muscles of respiration\r\nin order to satisfy her air hunger, and even then her symptoms were\r\nquite alarming to herself and her friends. At first, her asthma was\r\nthought to be due to sudden changes of temperature in going out into\r\nthe air after the dancing, and various devices were tried to lessen\r\nthe shock of the cold to the respiratory mucous membrane. None of them\r\nhad any effect. Then it was thought that the dust of the ball-room\r\nmade the difference and so she was forbidden to dance. After a time it\r\nwas found, however, that if she went out in the evenings to social\r\nfunctions, whether she danced or not, or though she avoided completely\r\nbeing in dusty rooms or where many people were moving, she still had\r\nthe attacks a few hours after she returned home.\r\n\r\nFinally it was noted that these attacks of asthma also occurred on\r\nseveral occasions after she had been out riding during the day in a\r\ncarriage. Then one evening after a rather long intermission free from\r\nattacks, in spite of directions and her fears, she went to a ball, but\r\nowing to circumstances went and returned by trolley instead of, as\r\nusual, in the family carriage. That night she had no attack of asthma.\r\nExperiments were made then and it was found that whenever she rode\r\nbehind horses she suffered from an attack of asthma during the\r\nfollowing night. The attack was evidently not due to suggestion. The\r\nstory illustrates the necessity for carefully analyzing all the\r\ncircumstances of an asthma patient and making sure that some one of\r\nthese curious and unusual conditions are not at work, for if they are,\r\nthe only possible curative treatment is by influencing the patient's\r\nmind, first by demonstrating the cause of the affection and then by\r\ntraining in self-control to reduce the reaction.\r\n\r\n{377}\r\n\r\nRecently I have been consulted with regard to a physician who has\r\ndeveloped in a rather curious manner a sensitiveness to the presence\r\nof horses. As an interne at a hospital during an epidemic of\r\ndiphtheria he took a dose of diphtheria antitoxin for immunizing\r\npurposes. The amount injected was 750 units, the remainder of the dose\r\nof 1,500 units contained in the phial being given to the nurse who had\r\ncharge of the cases. She suffered absolutely no ill effects, so that\r\nthe manifestations in his case were entirely due to idiosyncrasy and\r\nnot to anything in the serum itself. Within fifteen minutes after\r\ntaking the injection the mucous membrane of his nose became so\r\ncongested as to make it impossible for him to breathe through his\r\nnostrils and the mucous membrane of his soft palate was seriously\r\ndisturbed in the same way. His face became much swollen, the edema\r\naffecting particularly his eyelids and his lips and hundreds of wheals\r\nappeared all over the body. Fortunately the edema did not affect the\r\nlarynx, or the issue might have been fatal, or would surely have\r\nrequired intubation. His pulse became extremely rapid and weak, there\r\nwas marked dyspnea, and whenever the patient sat up there was fainting\r\nor a distinct tendency to it.\r\n\r\nUnder active stimulation and elimination the symptoms rapidly passed\r\noff so that the only noticeable edema the next morning was in the\r\neyelids and lips, which, however, also disappeared within twenty-four\r\nhours. Up to this time the physician had never been bothered by any\r\ntendency to hay fever or to asthma and there is no history of either\r\nof these affections in his family. Thereafter, however, though quite\r\nwithout his anticipating it, and, indeed, the first symptoms were\r\nincomprehensible, he became extremely sensitive to emanations from\r\nhorses. When he rides behind a horse for some distance his\r\nconjunctivae become injected, the nostrils become congested and\r\ndifficulty of breathing sets in with a sense of constriction of the\r\nchest. These subside as soon as he gets away from the presence of the\r\nhorse and has washed himself thoroughly. He suggests that he has\r\nbecome sensitized to horse serum and, as it did not exist before his\r\nexperience with diphtheria serum, he, of course, connects that\r\nincident with the present tendency. It is easy for such a case to have\r\nits real significance entirely missed and, of course, treatment by\r\nprophylaxis, the most efficient form, would then be out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Forms.--Apparently at times human emanations or some peculiarity\r\nof odor seems to influence asthmatic conditions. I have been told by a\r\ngood observer--a physician--of two brothers who had an attack of\r\nasthma whenever they visited each other. At first this was attributed\r\nto something in the air or some other condition of the visit. After a\r\ntime it was found to occur under varying circumstances, but that the\r\none essential was the association with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The more one knows about asthmatic conditions the more\r\ndoes it become clear that special study of individual cases is\r\nextremely important for any definite knowledge of the causation in a\r\nparticular case. Without a knowledge of the cause the treatment is\r\nvery unsatisfactory and in the meantime the unfavorable suggestion of\r\nthe recurrence of the attacks acting upon the patient sometimes\r\ndisturbs the general health. To remove this unfavorable influence must\r\nbe the first care of the physician and then if the real cause can be\r\nfound, favorable suggestion and modifications of the mode of life,\r\nwith self-discipline and control of the mental attitude and of the\r\n{378} nervous system, may greatly aid in the reduction not only of the\r\nnumber of attacks and of the severity of the symptoms, but finally\r\nlead to complete eradication of the affection.\r\n\r\nMental control to some degree can be obtained and it has even been\r\nsuggested that if the emanations from an animal cause physical\r\nsymptoms, gradually increased dosage of them, beginning with very\r\nsmall amounts, that is, short periods of association with the animals\r\nin question, may gradually lead to the production of an immunity to\r\nthem as it does even to the much more serious results of snake poison.\r\nCertainly some patients seem to have succeeded in bringing relief to\r\nthemselves by this means and it is worth while remembering in the\r\ntherapy of the affection, if for no other reason than the strong\r\nsuggestion that goes with it.\r\n\r\n{379}\r\n\r\nSECTION IX\r\n\r\n_PSYCHOTHERAPY IN THE JOINT AND MUSCULAR SYSTEM_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPAINFUL JOINT CONDITIONS--PSEUDO-RHEUMATISM.   [Footnote 33]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 33: The position here taken, that acute articular\r\n  rheumatism never leaves a mark after it, is entirely due to the\r\n  observation that whenever cases were seen in which sequelae were\r\n  noted, there always seems to the writer to be question of something\r\n  else besides simple acute articular rheumatism--a complication.\r\n  Subsequent pathological investigation may show that occasionally\r\n  acute articular rheumatism does to some extent disorganize joint\r\n  tissues. Personally, however, I have the feeling that there are a\r\n  number of different kinds of acute arthritis, probably three or\r\n  four, and that most of them leave no pathological condition in the\r\n  tissues. Perhaps we shall be able to differentiate the severer forms\r\n  and recognize them from the beginning, as we have already done with\r\n  regard to scarlatinal, gonorrheal, influenzal and other so-called\r\n  rheumatisms. For practical purposes it certainly seems better to\r\n  emphasize the fact that chronic rheumatism following an attack of\r\n  simple acute arthritis is so rare as to be negligible.]\r\n\r\nMany painful conditions in connection with joints give rise to more or\r\nless continuous or frequently repeated discomfort, which often leads\r\npatients to think that there are serious pathological factors at work,\r\nor that some progressive disease condition has obtained a hold of\r\nthem. Many of these painful conditions are due entirely to local\r\ncauses: to over-exertion, to the wrong use of muscles, to the exercise\r\nof joints under unfortunate mechanical conditions and the like. Just\r\nso long as people are assured that an ailment is local, is not likely\r\nto be followed by serious impairment of function, that the discomfort\r\nof it is only temporary, and, above all, just as soon as they get rid\r\nof the notion of a progressive constitutional malady, they are content\r\nto bear even annoying pain without much complaint, and, what is more\r\nimportant, without such discouragement and worry as may impair the\r\ngeneral health. Unfortunately, it is the custom to call most of these\r\nvague painful conditions \"rheumatism,\" unless there is some other\r\npatent cause for them. Especially is this done if the symptoms happen\r\nto be worse in rainy weather, or in damp seasons. Rheumatism is always\r\nthought of as a progressive constitutional disease, and the very idea\r\nof it produces an unfortunate sense of depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nExaggeration of Significance.--Toothache, for instance, unless it is\r\nallowed to nag for a long time, awakens no dreads and consequently\r\nfails to produce the corresponding depression and discouragement, seen\r\nso often in connections with conditions much less painful, but\r\nassociated with the thought of the possibility of serious\r\ndevelopments. _\"Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\"_ what is not well\r\nunderstood is always exaggerated, was Cicero's summing up of the\r\ntendency of the human mind to make the significance of misunderstood\r\nthings greater than they really are. It is particularly true of\r\npainful {380} conditions of the body, and the tendency must be\r\ncombated if patients are to be relieved. This must be done not alone\r\nbecause along this way lies relief of suffering, since not a little of\r\nthe discomfort is due to the mental concentration consequent upon the\r\ndread, but because, also, the discouraged state of mind interferes\r\nwith the trophic influences that go down from the central nervous\r\nsystem to the periphery to keep it in good health and to restore\r\nfunction when there is anything out of order. In a word, the\r\nexaggeration of significance so likely to influence such patients for\r\nill must, as far as possible, be removed for their immediate relief as\r\nwell as ultimate cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nRheumatism, Gout, Catarrh.--There are three words in popular medical\r\nlanguage which can be made to include more diseases and explain more\r\nsymptoms than any others. Their meaning has become so indefinite that\r\nthey now convey very little information, though they are much\r\nused--and abused. They are: rheumatism, gout and catarrh. Curiously\r\nenough all three of them when their etymology is studied mean the same\r\nthing as far as their derivation goes. Catarrh from [Greek text] the\r\nGreek word to flow down and rheumatism from [Greek text] the Greek\r\nverb to flow are terms that correspond exactly in etymology to gout,\r\nwhich is probably derived from _gutta_, the Latin word for\r\ndrop--referring to the excess of secretion that is supposed to occur\r\nin the disease. All of these have for their basic idea, in etymology\r\nat least, an increase of secretion. A generation or two ago, the word\r\nrheumatism included a host of disparate painful affections, and was\r\neven more sadly abused than now, though its abuse has not ceased. The\r\nword catarrh is now at its acme of abuse. Gout has been pushed\r\nsomewhat into the background by the other two. Any one of these three\r\nterms carries with it, in the popular mind, a connotation of\r\nprogressive constitutional involvement which is not justified by\r\nanything that physicians know with regard to these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Uric Acid Diathesis.--The usual supposedly scientific explanation\r\nof a decade ago for many of these vague pains and aches classed as\r\nchronic rheumatism was that they developed on the basis of an excess\r\nof uric acid in the system. Advance in chemistry has completely\r\nobliterated the significance of the observation on which the theory of\r\na uric acid diathesis, as it was so learnedly called, as an\r\nexplanation for these conditions was founded. After uric acid there\r\ncame for a time the theory of an excess of lithic acid, the so-called\r\nlithemia or American disease of a few years ago. These are, however,\r\nmerely pseudo-scientific hypotheses and the more physicians know of\r\nchemistry the less they talk about them. Many practitioners, however,\r\ncontinue to accept this universal explanation which makes diagnosis so\r\neasy and which is supposed to be so suggestive for treatment. There\r\nare various remedies that are claimed to reduce the uric acid content\r\nof the blood or the system, and then there are various changes of diet\r\nthat are supposed to do the same thing. These two systems of treatment\r\nand the combination of them have constituted the main therapeutic\r\nresource of many physicians for these so-called rheumatic cases,\r\nthough their success has been anything but what they hoped for.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet Tinkering.--Tinkering with diet has been particularly harmful in\r\nthese cases. Over and over again I have seen patients who had lost\r\nconsiderably in weight because they had had all the supposed\r\nacid-forming elements removed from their diet. In many physicians'\r\nminds this seems to include most of the starches, as well as the\r\nfruits and many meats. Without any {381} potatoes, with only a limited\r\namount of bread, with a warning as to red meats, and occasionally even\r\nsome distrustful remarks with regard to butter, it is not surprising\r\nthat the patients lost weight, that muscles became weaker, that\r\npainful conditions became severer, and that, above all, the patients'\r\nminds became less capable of bearing whatever discomfort is present.\r\nBesides, constipation intervenes with its train of consequences and\r\npatients become miserable, lose sleep often because of insufficient\r\nnutrition and actual clamoring on the part of their gastrointestinal\r\ntract for food. I have seen a man who was not much over normal weight\r\nto begin with lose twenty-five pounds, nearly one-sixth of his weight,\r\nwhile being dieted for vague pains (worse on rainy days) that were\r\nreally due to his occupation, but that had been diagnosed as\r\n\"rheumatic,\" consequent upon the uric acid diathesis, for which coal\r\ntar products were prescribed over a long period and his diet\r\nstrenuously regulated. This has become as much of an abuse as the\r\nold-time purgings and bleedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrregular Treatment.--As we have said, this group of cases constitutes\r\nthe most frequent and abundant source of profit for quacks and\r\ncharlatans and irregular practitioners generally. The naturapath, the\r\nosteopath, whom we have already mentioned, for to these cases he owes\r\nmost of his success in appealing to legislatures for recognition, the\r\nirregular electropath, many supposed diet specialists, and even the\r\nspecial shoemaker, have reaped a rich harvest from these patients. The\r\nreason why they have done so is that, as a rule, they have at once\r\nreassured the patients that their condition was not seriously\r\nprogressive and have promised them certain relief from their ailment.\r\nUsually various local measures, such as St. John Long's liniment of\r\none hundred years ago and many of its successors, or the\r\nmechanotherapy and the massage and the manipulation of the osteopaths\r\nof the present day, have been employed with consequent restoration of\r\ncirculatory disturbances to normal conditions and, in general, the\r\nsetting up of better mechanical employment of muscles than was\r\npossible before. If so-called chronic rheumatism is to be treated\r\nsuccessfully and this opprobrium of medicine, as it has been called,\r\nis to be removed, it can only be done by a careful analysis of the\r\nills of each individual patient and a definite determination as to\r\njust what local pathological condition is at work and not by a\r\nslip-shod diagnosis of rheumatism with immediate recourse to a\r\nsupposed or assumed theoretic diathesis for the explanation of its\r\netiology.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferentiation of Joint Conditions.--The local conditions that give\r\nrise to painful conditions of joints are most diverse in character.\r\nThere was a time when all of the infectious joint affections had the\r\nterm rheumatism applied to them. Even at present it is not unusual to\r\nhear of scarlatinal or gonorrheal or influenzal rheumatism. What is\r\nmeant, of course, is that the microbes of these specific diseases have\r\nfor some reason found a lowered resistive vitality in one of the\r\njoints, or perhaps several of them, and have set up an inflammatory\r\ndisturbance. These specific arthritises are now definitely separated\r\nfrom the rheumatism group and it seems clear that in the near future\r\nwe shall have rheumatism itself divided up into a series of diseases.\r\nBy this I mean that even where there is the redness, the swelling and\r\nthe fever of true inflammation of joints, it is not always due to one\r\nmicrobe, but to various microbic agents, and so we shall have various\r\nforms of rheumatism. At present we are prone to speak of many of the\r\nneuritises as rheumatic, but it is probable that {382} here a series\r\nof varying microbic infections will be found, some of them much more\r\nserious than others, most of them capable of complete cure, though\r\nsome of them will tend to leave pathological conditions in nerves that\r\nare more or less crippling.\r\n\r\n\r\nPainful Joint Affections.--These pains and aches occur particularly in\r\nthe old and those who have been hard muscle workers, in those who have\r\nbeen exposed much to the elements and especially in the subjects of\r\nold injuries. All of these conditions, one way or another, have left\r\ntheir mark upon tissues so that the nerves do not receive proper\r\nnutrition, especially when there is considerable exertion or in rainy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons why rainy weather produces this effect.\r\nThe humidity of the atmosphere lessens evaporation. This disturbs heat\r\nconditions in the tissues, for evaporation is the most important\r\nelement in heat dissipation. This leads to the accumulation of heat in\r\nthe parts and conduces to congestion. Any tissue of lowered vitality\r\nwill be affected by this and nerves become oversensitive. Besides, it\r\nseems probable that the fall in the barometer with the lessened\r\npressure from without makes a difference in the circulation. There is\r\na general feeling of depression in wet weather and apparently the\r\ncirculation is not so active. It is particularly slow at the surface\r\nof the body and in the terminal portions, so that the hands and feet\r\nare likely to be cold. Just as soon as the barometer goes up somewhat\r\nthese conditions cease to be active and there is restoration of the\r\ncirculation to its previous condition. Besides, it seems not unlikely\r\nthat dampness produces some relaxation of muscles, so that it is more\r\ndifficult to make them contract, and consequently they are used at a\r\ngreater mechanical disadvantage and painful tiredness more readily\r\nensues. All sensitive tissues become more sensitive in rainy weather,\r\nthough in the case of toothache or neuralgia, for instance, we do not\r\nthink of connecting this with the word rheumatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classes of Sufferers_.--In persons who are over-thin or over-stout\r\ncomplaints of joint discomfort are not uncommon. In the first case\r\nthey are due to the fact that muscles working around joints are not\r\nstrong enough to accomplish their normal purposes. In the other cases,\r\nowing to the weight of the body, the muscles are overstrained. In a\r\nnumber of stout people the muscles do not increase proportionately to\r\nthe size of the frame, much of the extra weight being in the shape of\r\nadipose tissue that constitutes a grievous burden. In people who run\r\nrapidly to either of these conditions of disturbed nutrition--thinness\r\nor stoutness--complaints are particularly likely to be heard. Familiar\r\nexamples are often seen in the tuberculous who have lost weight\r\nrapidly or in convalescents from typhoid fever who are much thinner\r\nthan they were before they took to their beds. On the other hand,\r\nthose who gain in weight rapidly after typhoid fever or some other\r\nsuch pathological incident, or who, as the result of careful\r\nsanatorium treatment, put on twenty pounds in the initial stage of\r\ntuberculosis, may have similar discomforts to complain of in and\r\naround their joints.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity of Rheumatism.--The strongest unfavorable suggestion which\r\nmost patients have is that their ailment, whatever it is, is\r\nhereditary and therefore not amenable to treatment. Nothing is more\r\namusing to one who knows the present-day status of opinion in biology\r\nwith regard to heredity than the frequent declaration that rheumatism\r\nis hereditary. Probably {383} nothing is commoner than to have a\r\npatient who is suffering from some vague, painful condition in muscles\r\nor joints, especially if that condition is worse on rainy days,\r\ndeclare that it must be rheumatism because father or mother suffered\r\nfrom rheumatism. I took the trouble to analyze in more than a dozen\r\ncases the rheumatism that was supposed to exist in the preceding\r\ngeneration, and found that it consisted of everything from pains due\r\nto old injuries and especially dislocations or fractures, through the\r\nvarious deformities connected with flatfoot, up to and including the\r\nworst manifestations of arthritis deformans. The condition in the\r\nparents supposed to be hereditary is never genuinely rheumatic.\r\n\r\nThere is just as much sense in talking of hereditary pneumonia as of\r\nhereditary rheumatism. Perhaps there is an hereditary lack of\r\nresistance in the pulmonary tissues of some people that predisposes\r\nthem to pneumonia. It must not be forgotten that a century ago, or\r\neven less, it was not uncommon to hear that certain people had\r\nhereditary tendencies to lung fever. We know now that these were\r\ntendencies to tuberculosis and not to true pneumonia. We know,\r\nbesides, that tuberculosis itself is not hereditary and that probably\r\neven the predisposition to it is not specifically hereditary.\r\n\r\nAs can be readily understood, the question of heredity in rheumatism\r\nis extremely important for psychotherapy, since the persuasion that\r\ntheir affection is inherited always produces an unfavorable effect\r\nupon patients' minds. In the old days, when tuberculosis was\r\nuniversally considered to be hereditary, a patient was likely to think\r\nhimself the victim of an hereditary condition which could not be cured\r\nand which inevitably led to a fatal termination. Something of the same\r\nidea, though the immediate outlook is not so gloomy, is likely to\r\nfollow the persuasion that rheumatism is hereditary. The question of\r\nheredity, of course, is bound up with that of rheumatism being a\r\nconstitutional disease dependent on hyperacidity or some other\r\npathological condition of the blood. Acute rheumatism, that is, acute\r\narthritis, is an acute, infectious disease due to a microbe. This\r\nought to dispose of any question of heredity in it. Chronic rheumatism\r\nis supposed to be related to acute rheumatism and to represent, as it\r\nwere, a low-grade enduring condition such as in sudden accessions\r\ngives rise to acute rheumatism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo-called Chronic Rheumatism.--In these cases it is always a question\r\nwhether the condition which causes the pain and discomfort is genuine\r\nchronic rheumatism or not. I am one of those who doubt whether we have\r\nany genuine, definite symptom-complex that should be termed chronic\r\nrheumatism. I have seen many ailments called chronic rheumatism. Any\r\npainful condition in the neighborhood of the joint that is worse on\r\nrainy days is likely to be labeled rheumatism and, because the\r\nsalicylates are supposed to be a specific for rheumatism, treated with\r\nlarge doses of these drugs. These relieve the pain, as do any other\r\ncoal tar products, but it is hard to understand how they are ever\r\nsupposed to do any good for the underlying pathological conditions.\r\nThe most noteworthy characteristic of acute rheumatic arthritis is\r\nthat it leaves no mark upon the joints that were affected by it. These\r\nget completely better and the patient has no disability, no deformity,\r\nand there usually remains not even the slightest sign of there having\r\nbeen a serious inflammatory condition within the joints.\r\n\r\nIn this it resembles pneumonia rather strikingly. True lobar pneumonia\r\n{384} clears up completely and the man has no symptoms once he has\r\ncome through the convalescence. There are certain diseases affecting\r\nthe joints, especially the arthritises in connection with various\r\ninfectious diseases and the arthritis which accompanies acute\r\narthritis deformans, in which there are serious sequelae and sometimes\r\neven complete disorganization of the joint. It is by these\r\nafter-effects alone that we are sometimes able to differentiate\r\ngenuine rheumatic arthritis from these other very different affections\r\nwhich resemble it so closely. Just the same thing is true of\r\npneumonia. There are pneumonias that run a course at the beginning\r\nstrikingly like true lobar pneumonia but which do not have a frank\r\ncrisis and in which the lungs are seriously affected afterwards. We\r\nknow now that in these cases it is not an uncomplicated pneumococcus\r\npneumonia that has been at work, but either some other infection or\r\nelse true pneumonia with a complication. Very often a dormant\r\ntuberculosis causes true pneumonia to run a different course from that\r\nwhich it ordinarily follows, and this, as a complication, leaves its\r\nserious mark upon the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Recurrence_.--In some cases there seems to be a tendency for the\r\n\"rheumatic\" disease to recur. This also is true of pneumonia. This\r\ndoes not so much indicate, however, any loss of special tissue\r\nvitality as a certain loss of vital resistance to a particular\r\nmicrobe. Certainly this tendency is not sufficient to make us think of\r\nchronic rheumatism or use that term any more than we would, under\r\nsimilar conditions, talk of chronic pneumonia or of chronic\r\ndiphtheria, though both of these affections have a tendency to leave a\r\nlack of resistive vitality. In a number of cases, subacute rheumatism\r\nruns a course that is very bothersome and annoying and that is quite\r\nintractable, with relapses and sequelae, but even this is entirely\r\ndifferent from the ordinary idea of chronic rheumatism. It is probable\r\nthat these cases, like the pneumonias that do not end by crises, are\r\ncomplicated by some other condition in the joint that leads to\r\nreinfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnclassified Forms.--It is possible that in a certain number of cases\r\nfor which as yet we have no name but rheumatism, there is a virulence\r\nof the microbic factor that brings about some joint disorganization.\r\nThis, however--and the cases are very rare--is probably an affection\r\nto which the name of rheumatic arthritis will not be given when we\r\nknow more of the disease and its cause. There are probably many forms\r\nof acute rheumatic arthritis due to varying microbes which will\r\neventually be divided into groups, as we have made groups in the\r\ntyphoid series of diseases and in the scarlet fever group and hope to\r\ndo with other diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Individual Case and Reassurance.--The main role of psychotherapy\r\nin these affections is to set patients' minds at rest as far as\r\npossible, by pointing out exactly what is the matter with them and\r\nkeeping them from worry, discomfort, and even interference with their\r\nphysical condition by over-solicitude. It is important to know every\r\ndetail of the patient's occupation, of his habits, of his environment,\r\nof his exercise, and, above all, of his individual peculiarities of\r\nstructure in the neighborhood of joints, so as to decide exactly what\r\nis the matter with him, and not be satisfied with the easy but\r\nunscientific diagnosis of rheumatism, which may mean much but usually\r\nmeans nothing.\r\n\r\nUnless such reassurance is given, and especially if the ordinary drug\r\ntreatment for so-called chronic rheumatism is persisted in, after a\r\ntime these {385} patients, unimproved by salicylate treatment, wander\r\noff to all sorts of irregular practitioners and form the greater part\r\nof the lucrative clientele of quacks and advertising specialists in\r\nthe cure of chronic diseases. More probably than any other class of\r\ncases do they support the irregulars. Osteopathy has particularly\r\nappealed to a great many of these patients. It has done it in two\r\nways. The first and most important probably by its effect upon the\r\nmind of the patients. Osteopaths immediately proceed to reassure the\r\nsufferers that their affection is not rheumatism, but some local\r\ncondition dependent upon either a subluxation of the vertebra which,\r\naccording to the founder of osteopathy, constitutes the basis of\r\nninety-five per cent. of all the ills to which human nature is heir or\r\nupon some joint or muscle condition which can be corrected by\r\nmanipulation or massage. These patients have, as a rule, been\r\nsuffering a good deal before this from the thought that they were\r\nafflicted with a progressive constitutional condition which would\r\nalmost inevitably cripple them. Often they have seen patients who were\r\nsuffering from arthritis deformans in its worst forms and advanced\r\nstages; they have heard this called rheumatism and they have concluded\r\nthat it was only a question of time when they would be in the same\r\ncondition. There is no good reason to speak of such conditions as\r\nrheumatic. They are entirely local, the hope of relief between attacks\r\nis by properly applied massage and passive movements which facilitate\r\nthe blood supply in the neighborhood, and the best applications at the\r\ntime of discomfort are the various rubefacients which stimulate the\r\ncirculation in the parts, call the blood to the surface, and prevent\r\nthat congestion in the neighborhood of small nerves which is the cause\r\nof the aches or pains. These affections take on a much more serious\r\ncharacter in the minds of patients as soon as the word rheumatism is\r\nmentioned. To tell them that the condition is entirely local, has no\r\ntendency to spread, has nothing to do with any constitutional\r\ncondition, and can be relieved by local measures and the improvement\r\nof the general health, will often bring the patient a good measure of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION IN TREATMENT OF SO-CALLED RHEUMATISMS\r\n\r\nHow much the treatment of these so-called chronic rheumatisms depends\r\non suggestion, in spite of the apparent improbability of anything so\r\nmaterially discomforting being under the influence of the mind, is\r\nbest appreciated from a consideration of the many inert materials that\r\nhave been used for the cure of rheumatism. There is, of course, no\r\nmore virtue in red flannel than in any other colored flannel, but many\r\npeople suffer from rheumatism or rheumatic discomfort whenever they do\r\nnot wear red flannel and are sure that it means much for them. Then\r\nthere are all sorts of supposed electrical contrivances that do not\r\ngenerate an ion of electricity. They are effective only through the\r\nappeal they make to the mind. Some men wear electric belts and\r\nattribute their freedom from rheumatic pains to them. Others wear\r\nso-called electric medals or electric shields or electric insoles. Any\r\nnumber of people in this country wear electric rings on the little\r\nfinger of one hand and get marvelous relief from it for their chronic\r\nrheumatism. Some have noted good results from even less likely\r\nobjects. There are thousands in this country who carry horsechestnuts\r\nas a preventive against rheumatism, and some of {386} them,\r\nintelligent men and women, are persuaded it lessens their pains and\r\naches.\r\n\r\nIn another place I have told the story of the woman who was a sufferer\r\nfrom rheumatism and who found great relief from carrying a\r\nhorsechestnut. As her husband was also a sufferer, she wanted him to\r\ncarry one, too, and when he would not, she carried one for him. It is\r\nto be hoped that her conjugal tenderness in this matter had as good an\r\neffect on him as she was sure the propinquity of the horsechestnut had\r\non her.\r\n\r\nThe patients' occupations must be regulated by proper advice and\r\ndetailed directions, and distractions of various kinds must be\r\nprovided to keep their minds from becoming concentrated on certain\r\nportions of their body, emphasizing whatever discomfort is present and\r\npreventing nature's curative processes. Finally, local treatment of\r\nvarious kinds must be employed suitable to each individual case, that\r\nwill remove all mechanical difficulties, disperse congestions, relieve\r\nfatigue and over-tiredness, and make conditions favorable for the\r\nhealthy, normal use of joints and muscles.\r\n\r\nMany painful affections of joints, sometimes complicated by\r\nimmovability, are really psycho-neuroses. Sir Benjamin Brodie once\r\nsaid that four-fifths of the joint troubles that he saw among the\r\nbetter classes were hysterical. Sir James Paget thought this an\r\nexaggeration, but confessed that he saw many of them and among all\r\nclasses of people. One-fifth of those that he saw in hospital and in\r\nprivate practice were entirely neurotic. He emphasized the fact that\r\nthey must be looked for not only among women but that they are often\r\nfound in men and that they are by no means confined to those who are\r\nnervously inclined, the silly young women or the foolish old women,\r\nbut that they may be found in special circumstances among the most\r\nsensible people. They are often initiated by an injury which makes it\r\nquite difficult to differentiate them from real joint affections.\r\nUsually, however, there is no redness, nor swelling nor heat with\r\nthem, though sometimes one of these symptoms at least may occur with\r\nthe redness. The connection between the trivial accident and the large\r\nreaction is usually hard to find and causes a suspicion as to the real\r\nprocess at work. Often, too, there is a delay of several days or\r\nsometimes weeks after the accident before the neurosis declares\r\nitself. In the meantime it has been getting on the patient's mind.\r\n\r\nIn general, it must be remembered the patient's attitude of mind in\r\nthese cases of pain around joints and in muscles is extremely\r\nimportant. They have furnished a goodly proportion of the patients on\r\nwhich quacks and charlatans have fattened. Greatrakes in the\r\nseventeenth century, Mesmer and Perkins, St. John Long, the early\r\nelectrotherapeutists, the blue glass faddists, all the various\r\nliniment makers, many of the manufacturers of blood purifiers, and\r\nEddyism and mental healing besides osteopathy in our day have all\r\nbenefited these sufferers for a time and the patients have often been\r\nmen and women of education and influence in their communities and have\r\nexerted their influence for the benefit of their supposed benefactors.\r\nThe methods of treatment come and go. The promise of the physician or\r\nthe healer and the confidence of the patient are the only factors that\r\nare common to all the supposed \"cures.\" If people stay at home without\r\nthe air and exercise they should have, if they nurse their ills and\r\nconsider that they are sure to get worse, because they labor under\r\nhereditary or constitutional ailments, nothing will benefit them.\r\n{387} If they are convinced that their disease is only local and begin\r\nto go out to see their friends once more, a change comes over the\r\nwhole aspect of their disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOLD INJURIES AND SO-CALLED RHEUMATISM\r\n\r\n\r\nAs people advance in years, it is a common experience that tissues\r\ninjured years before are the source of no little discomfort and are\r\nparticularly prone to be bothersome during changeable seasons and in\r\nrainy weather. A bone broken when the patient was young may twenty or\r\nthirty years later continue to give warnings of the approach of change\r\nin the weather and be a source of annoyance. A dislocation, especially\r\nif complicated in any way by considerable laceration of the tissues in\r\nthe neighborhood of the luxated joint, is sure to be a source of\r\ndiscomfort of this kind. These painful conditions are generally more\r\nnoticeable when patients are run down, or when they have been recently\r\naffected by exhausting disease of any kind, during convalescence from\r\nsevere ailments or injuries, or when they are undergoing a special\r\nmental strain. These conditions, like nearly all others worse in damp\r\nweather, are sometimes grouped under the term rheumatism and have been\r\ntreated by internal medication. Almost needless to say, such treatment\r\nis sure to fail or to be of only temporary anodyne benefit. As\r\nrheumatic remedies are usually coal-tar products they may even be\r\ndistinctly harmful, especially for old patients. It has been shown\r\nthat the salicylates, for instance, are much less rapidly eliminated\r\nin the elderly than in the young, in those with defective circulation\r\nor kidney insufficiency than in the well. Their accumulation in the\r\nsystem causes anemic tendencies and disturbs nervous control.\r\n\r\nJust what is the underlying pathological condition in these cases is\r\nnot easy to say. In the case of luxations with laceration of tissues\r\nthere has undoubtedly been such a disturbance of venous and lymphatic\r\ncirculation by the break in continuity of tissues and the resultant\r\nscar tissue, that lymphatic if not also venous congestion occurs\r\nwhenever there is any circulatory disturbance. For the maintenance of\r\nnormal nutrition of nerve endings a constant flow of blood past them\r\nand a proper action of the lymphatic channels to carry off waste\r\nproducts is essential. It is easy to understand how much these may be\r\ndisturbed in the injuries under consideration. When a bone is broken\r\nthere is usually laceration of the surrounding tissues. Owing to the\r\nfixation required to procure proper bony union, the circulation to the\r\npart is much more defective than usual and so the repair of torn lymph\r\nand venous vessels is not as complete as would otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\nThis seems to explain why such injuries are especially called to the\r\nattention of the patients in damp weather. It is not so much during a\r\nrain storm as some hours before it, about the time when the barometer\r\nbegins to drop, that these old injuries become sensitive. Indeed, it\r\nis often said that old persons who have suffered one of these injuries\r\nearlier in life carry a barometer around with them.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the lesions called sprains, especially those of the\r\nankles and {388} wrists, though also of other joints, are often really\r\nbreaks of small bones, or at least laceration of ligaments and other\r\nstructures. These may long afterward prove a source of pain and\r\ndiscomfort, worse always in unsettled weather, or after the feet have\r\nbeen wet, and may seem to be due to some constitutional condition,\r\nthough they are merely local. These occur more commonly in women than\r\nin men and the condition needs careful investigation and must not be\r\nput under the vague diagnosis of rheumatism, or the patient will\r\nprobably not be improved by the treatment suggested. In all these\r\ncases the general condition must be looked to, and it must not be\r\nforgotten that fat may not mean health, and that increased weight may\r\nbe a prominent factor in the production of symptoms in these cases,\r\nespecially when individuals live a sedentary life.\r\n\r\nThere is an important therapeutic method for the prophylaxis of these\r\nconditions that has been attracting attention and yet probably not all\r\nthe attention it deserves in recent years. Prof. Lucas-Championniere\r\nof the University of Paris has pointed out that when fractures and\r\ndislocations are treated by the open method with easily removable\r\napparatus and the employment of massage within a few days after the\r\nfracture, the subsequent discomfort of these lesions is much lessened.\r\n\r\nIt seems worth while to emphasize this treatment by manipulations and\r\nmassage, because it represents a psychotherapeutic factor in the\r\ntreatment of these injuries. The hiding away of a limb or a joint for\r\ndays and perhaps weeks, while they wonder whether it is getting better\r\nor not is most discouraging to patients. To have the physician see it,\r\nto have him declare that it is getting on well, to have the evidence\r\nof their own senses that conditions are gradually improving, is of\r\nitself a valuable factor for that satisfaction of mind which conduces\r\nto the regular functioning of tissues. Repair undoubtedly goes on\r\nbetter under such circumstances. Besides, the lack of constriction or\r\nat least its rather frequent periodic relaxation, the airing of the\r\nskin, the regulation of the circulation by massage and manipulation,\r\nall react upon the mind and prevent it from inhibiting trophic\r\nimpulses and encourage it to stimulate them in every way.\r\n\r\nAs to the after-effects of fractures and dislocations as with regard\r\nto all this series of vague pains and aches, the patient's attitude of\r\nmind is of great importance. As they get older their aches and pains\r\ngrow worse, partly because circulation is more defective and partly\r\nbecause they are prone to be much more in the house and the nerves of\r\npatients who are much within doors are always more sensitive than\r\nthose of people who are much in the open. If their attention becomes\r\nconcentrated on their pains and aches, because of lack of diversion of\r\nmind, then the condition may become a source of serious annoyance.\r\nWhen these painful conditions develop patients are almost sure to keep\r\nmuch to themselves and to nurse their ills, and consequently to\r\nincrease their discomfort. The circulation to the affected parts must\r\nbe stimulated by local treatment, by rubbings, by the milder\r\nliniments, by massage and manipulations, and by local hydrotherapy.\r\nDouches, as hot as can be borne, on the limb followed by cold,\r\nespecially if patients are otherwise in good health, will do much to\r\nrelieve the stagnant circulation.\r\n\r\nActive and vigorous movement while the affected part is supported at\r\n_skin pressure_ (there must be no constriction) is even more valuable\r\nthan {389} massage, liniments or douches in the treatment of all these\r\npainful conditions of joints in which there is any scar-tissue.\r\nWonderful results may be obtained in an old sprain of the wrist, knee\r\nand ankle by covering in the part completely (taking care to surround\r\nthe limb) with strips of adhesive strapping simply laid on at skin\r\npressure, but following exactly every fold or angle of the part, and\r\nthen with the part completely covered in this way to urge immediate\r\nand constant exercise. The maintained pressure prevents any tendency\r\nto venous congestion or exudation and favors absorption of fibrous\r\ntissue, and exercise, which should be immediate, is now possible\r\nthrough the support furnished by the strapping. The re-assumption of\r\nnormal active movement molds the old scars, strengthens the muscles\r\nand ligaments and improves the patient's general condition. The relief\r\nafforded _is immediate_, and the cause of relief, a simple mechanical\r\ndevice, is apparent. Rheumatism is forgotten as the old crutch is\r\ndiscarded and the patient is able to use the limb with confidence.\r\n\r\nRecent sprains or bruises treated in this way recover perfectly and do\r\nnot leave old scar tissue to be a future seat of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMUSCULAR PAINS AND ACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever exposure to cold causes a period of discomfort in almost any\r\norgan, except the teeth and certain definite nerves (for neuralgia has\r\nbeen taken out of the rheumatism group in recent years) we are sure to\r\nhear the word rheumatism employed in connection with it. To add to the\r\nconfusion, the various \"specialists\" have taken to assuring their\r\npatients that local manifestations in the eyes, in the ears, and in\r\nthe nose, for which they can find no good reason, especially if they\r\nare worse in damp weather, are signs of the rheumatic diathesis.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our supposed knowledge of the uric acid diathesis\r\nbecame widely diffused, and it is not surprising in the light of the\r\nwidespread acceptance of this theory, that muscular pains of all kinds\r\nshould have the word rheumatic attached to them, and that patients are\r\nsure that the discomfort is only one manifestation of a severe\r\nconstitutional disease, which they cannot but infer will probably make\r\nstill more serious trouble for them in years to come, since it seems\r\nto be dependent on conditions beyond their control, such as heredity\r\nand general constitutional traits and their special mode of nutrition,\r\nrather than on local or passing conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal and Constitutional Conditions.--It cannot be repeated too often\r\nthat it is this persuasion as to the constitutional character of the\r\ndisease that has in recent years proved a very unfavorable suggestive\r\nelement in these cases. Patients think themselves the victims of a\r\nserious diathesis, a deep-seated pathological condition, and attribute\r\na host of feelings to it that are sometimes rather seriously\r\ndisturbing but are really only sensory manifestations of various kinds\r\nin the organs and in the skin and muscles, which would be attributed\r\nto simple local causes--fatigue, faulty mechanical conditions,\r\netc.--but for the concentration of attention on them.\r\n\r\n{390}\r\n\r\n_Individual Cases_.--The careful study of these cases is thus\r\nextremely important. They are eminently individual and not to be\r\ngrouped together. The exact diagnosis of the various conditions from\r\nwhich each patient is suffering is of itself a precious factor in\r\npsychotherapeutics. The precise recognition of the condition present\r\nis of immediate avail in helping him to dismiss many of his symptoms,\r\nor at least to keep him from thinking as much of them as he did before\r\nor inevitably will if the older ideas as to the constitutional nature\r\nof his affection are allowed to remain.\r\n\r\nNearly every large group of muscles in the body may be the subject of\r\nthese painful conditions. In recent years, perhaps, the muscles most\r\naffected in this way are those that pass around the ankle and give so\r\nmuch discomfort in cases of flatfoot, or beginning flatfoot\r\n(euphemistically called weak foot), when the plantar arch is yielding.\r\nThe manifestations are not only in and around the ankle, but occur in\r\nthe calf muscles and even above the knee. These painful conditions\r\nalways develop unless the arch is supported. Until recent years it was\r\nrare to discover a bad case of flatfoot in which the patient had not\r\ntaken many rheumatic remedies and had not come to the conclusion that\r\nhe was the subject of an incurable and probably hereditary\r\nconstitutional disease. Flatfoot is likely to cause considerable\r\ndeformity in the old, the toes becoming bent and twisted up, and the\r\nsubjects of it complain very much of their feet. Flatfoot runs in\r\nfamilies. When the father and mother have complained of what they\r\ncalled rheumatism in their feet which got worse every year, then the\r\nson and daughter, when they have their first manifestation, conclude\r\nthat they are inevitably bound by the stern laws of heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation Aches.--Flatfoot is taken, however, only as an extreme and\r\ntherefore striking illustration. Whenever a particular group of\r\nmuscles has to do an excessive amount of work, practically always\r\nthere is a development of an uncomfortable condition worse on rainy\r\ndays and therefore likely to be called rheumatic. Over-use of the arm\r\nat any occupation, in writing, in the use of a file, at an\r\nironing-board, in sewing, or at anything requiring repeated movements,\r\nwill produce it almost inevitably. Especially is this true if the\r\noccupation is carried on without such careful attention to muscular\r\naction as enables the muscles to do their work to the best advantage.\r\nThese painful conditions are much more likely to occur in run-down\r\nindividuals of nervous temperament, above all if they have been or are\r\nsubject to worry. Men who have lost money and now have to do hard\r\nphysical work, after previously having lived sedentary lives, and\r\nwomen whose previous source of support has been withdrawn and who have\r\nto work for a daily wage after former gentle conditions of living, are\r\nespecially likely to suffer in this way. The conditions develop on a\r\nneurotic basis or an exhausted nervous system.\r\n\r\nOther groups of muscles may also be the subject of these painful\r\nconditions. The large group in the loins, called the lumbar muscles,\r\nwhich are so important for stooping, for the erect posture and for\r\nlifting, are so commonly the subject of discomfort that a special name\r\nhas been applied to their affection--lumbago. In the leg the large\r\ngroup of muscles supplied by the sciatic nerve are likely to be\r\naffected, and this affection is so common in men who have to bend the\r\nknee and flex the hip at their work that it, too, has received a\r\nspecial name--sciatica. Besides the arm muscles the groups of muscles\r\naround the shoulder girdle are often unfavorably affected and though\r\nwe have not invented {391} a name to cover their conditions, it is so\r\ncommon that we think of it as a separate entity almost in the same\r\nmanner as we think of lumbago and sciatica. In the neck the group of\r\nmuscles that rule the movements of the head, especially those at the\r\nside may be affected and the special name of torticollis has been\r\ngiven. Practically all of these affections are thought of at times as\r\nrheumatic and the ordinary rheumatic treatment is given for them.\r\nThere is no doubt that the salicylates will relieve the pain almost at\r\nonce, but so will any other coal-tar product and phenacetin,\r\nacetanilid or even antipyrin may be used with good effect. There is no\r\nevidence, however, that these drugs make the underlying condition\r\nbetter and, indeed, after patients have tried them for a while, unless\r\nthe affection is merely passing, they try some other physician and\r\nperhaps are treated the same way with a different form of the drug.\r\nThese are the cases that make their way around to a number of regular\r\npractitioners of medicine and then eventually go to some irregular or\r\nquack and sometimes obtain relief where the regulars have failed.\r\n\r\nWhen the irregular succeeds it is always because he has done three\r\nthings. First he has persuaded the patient that it is not rheumatism,\r\nwith all the unfavorable suggestion that goes with that word, that is,\r\nthe matter with him; secondly, he has treated the local condition;\r\nand, thirdly, he has diverted the patient's mind. Local treatment is\r\noften the real secret of his success, though the psychotherapeutic\r\nelement is not without distinct benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMode of Occurrence.--These muscular conditions present themselves\r\nunder two forms, acute and chronic. The acute condition occurs almost\r\nsuddenly and is accompanied by spasmodic pain and acute discomfort.\r\nMuscles go into spasm to avoid the movement that would necessarily\r\nbring pain with it. A typical example is found in torticollis in which\r\nthe patient wakes up some morning to find a stiffness in the muscles\r\nof his neck with limitation of movement much more pronounced on one\r\nside, and this usually gets worse as movements are attempted during\r\nthe day. This spasmodic painful condition usually lasts for some days\r\nand suggests all sorts of topical applications and often requires\r\nanodyne drugs. A similar acute condition may be observed in some cases\r\nof lumbago. In this the pain in the loins comes on suddenly, usually\r\nduring movement, often in the midst of lifting something that one has\r\nbeen able to lift without difficulty before. This pain is so sudden,\r\nso unexpected, usually comes entirely without warning and seems so\r\nmysterious in its origin, that it is no wonder the Germans speak of it\r\nas _Hexenschuss_--\"witches' shot\"--a remnant of the superstition that\r\na witch, by means of the evil eye or some other maleficent power, or\r\nby sticking pins in a wax image of a victim that had previously been\r\ndevoted to the devil, might produce effects upon the person at the\r\npart where the thought was directed or the pin inserted.\r\n\r\nThese painful conditions, especially when acute, are, as a rule the\r\nconsequence of exposure to dampness, or to a draft blowing directly on\r\nthe part, usually in damp and changeable weather, and often when the\r\npatient has been sweating just before. The train of events that brings\r\nabout the painful condition is not difficult to understand. There is a\r\ndisturbance of the normal smooth-running, indeed almost frictionless,\r\nmechanism by which muscles glide over one another. There are\r\npractically a series of joints in all muscular groups so as to permit\r\njust as free a play as possible of muscles over one another. Each\r\nmuscle is covered with a glistening membrane so familiar {392} from\r\nour dissecting room days, which secretes a substance resembling a\r\nsynovial fluid, to enable muscles to move upon each other without\r\nfriction. When, because of exposure to drafts or the evaporation of\r\nmoisture on the surface, there is a disturbance of the circulation in\r\nthese intermuscular planes, the secretion which prevents the friction\r\nof muscle movements is disturbed. The blood is driven from the surface\r\nand some congestion and consequent heat accumulation occurs in the\r\nmuscles, affecting particularly their contiguous layers. As a result,\r\nthe muscle surfaces are no longer smooth and the muscles now have not\r\nas free play over one another as before. It is not surprising that,\r\nowing to this, sensitiveness occurs and some spasm develops. This,\r\nhowever, is thoroughly conservative in character since nature's idea\r\nis to set the part at rest so as to allow the normal condition to be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThis is the pathological condition that underlies these so-called\r\nmuscular rheumatisms which develop suddenly. It is important to note,\r\nhowever, that these conditions develop nearly always in people who\r\nhave been over-using or wrongly using the groups of muscles which\r\nbecome thus affected. The history of a torticollis patient will\r\nusually show that there is some contortion of the muscles of the neck\r\nfamiliarly practiced by him. Sometimes it will be found that the\r\npatient has the habit of sitting on a particular easy chair in a\r\nspecial relation to the light and that in order to accommodate himself\r\nto his chair and the light in his reading, the head has to be placed\r\nin such position that the neck muscles are constrained. It is this\r\nthat predisposes the patient to the development of the condition which\r\nseems to be so acute and yet is really only an exacerbation of a\r\nchronic condition. Lumbago will develop in men who have been stooping\r\nmuch, especially for heavy lifting, or in women who scrub or have to\r\nstoop much while cleaning, dusting and the like.\r\n\r\nSome interesting muscle pains occur as a consequence of the jostling\r\nmovements of various modes of transit. They are particularly\r\nnoticeable if an uncomfortable position has been maintained for a\r\nnumber of hours. People who travel on railroad trains often come with\r\nthe story that they _must_ have caught cold on the trip for they have\r\nbeen sore and achy in many of their muscles since. I have known people\r\nwho went on a crowded excursion and had to stand for several hours\r\nconfident that, standing in the drafty aisle of the car on their way\r\nhome, they had acquired rheumatism. All that had happened was\r\nover-tiredness of muscles on the jolting train which required constant\r\nbalancing and unaccustomed muscular exertion. On board sea-going\r\nvessels people often suffer from pains in the loins and in various\r\ntrunk muscles, due to the roll of the vessel, especially while they\r\nare asleep. These, too, are likely to be attributed to drafts, or to\r\nsome form of rheumatism, or at least to the catching of cold. I have\r\neven seen people sure, because of pains in their loins, that they must\r\nbe developing some kidney trouble. After a time they get used to the\r\nswinging motion of the vessel and then their achy muscle tiredness is\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nOne now sees affections of the same kind in connection with the\r\nautomobile. People who ride for many hours, especially if the riding\r\nis rapid and over a rough road and they are not used to it, are likely\r\nto develop pains and aches which they may attribute to the catching of\r\ncold or to rheumatism or to something of that kind. The muscles of the\r\ntrunk are especially likely to {393} suffer. The abdominal muscles may\r\nbe quite sore and then later the lumbar muscles develop aches. The\r\narms suffer if they are held in unusual positions because of the\r\njolting. The discomfort may be relieved by any of the coal-tar\r\nproducts, though gentle rubbing with a stimulant such as soap\r\nliniment, always in the direction of the return circulation in the\r\nmuscle, will help to relieve the painful condition. The salicylates\r\nare often given for these conditions and relieve the discomfort but\r\nbecause of their value as anodynes, which they share with the coal-tar\r\nproducts, and not because of any genuine antirheumatic effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--Counter-irritation of various kinds, especially the milder\r\nforms, always seems to do good. The underlying therapeutic principle\r\nseems to be that the attraction of blood to the surface lessens the\r\nhyperemia or at least diverts the circulation and permits the\r\nrestoration of function and encourages the reintegration of normal\r\nconditions. Rubbings are especially helpful if accompanied by rather\r\ndeep pressure from the periphery of the circulation towards the\r\ncenter. The leg muscles must be rubbed upward, the arm muscles upward,\r\nthe neck muscles downward, the trunk muscles generally in the\r\ndirection of their return circulation. This would seem to indicate, as\r\nmight be expected, that it is the venous circulation especially that\r\nis disturbed in the tired condition of the muscles, that a venous\r\ncongestion with interference with the nutrition of nerves accounts for\r\nthe aches; hence, a mechanical helping of the circulation is of\r\nbenefit. There are some whose opinion is not to be put aside lightly,\r\nwho think that the rubbing alone is the most important part of these\r\nexternal treatments and that the liniments and counter-irritants are\r\nonly of secondary importance. Indeed, some consider that the tingling\r\nof the surface is mainly beneficial in making the patient feel that\r\nnow that part of the body at least _ought_ to be better.\r\n\r\nLiniments for these conditions, however, though introduced on merely\r\nempirical grounds, are very old and have the testimony of many\r\ngenerations as to their therapeutic efficiency. Whenever that is the\r\ncase, it is a serious question to doubt the conclusions that have been\r\narrived at. The experience of a single generation, and, above all, of\r\na small group or school of men, no matter how learned or how\r\nscientific they may be, is often fallacious. The experience of many\r\ngenerations, however, even though no good reason for the benefit\r\nderived from the treatment they suggest can be found, is almost\r\ninevitably correct. After all, though it is usually forgotten, the use\r\nof mercury, of iron, of quinin and of most of the tonics depends on\r\nnothing better than empiricism. In our day the liniments have been\r\nneglected, more perhaps than was proper, considering how many\r\ngenerations of physicians found them beneficial.\r\n\r\nWhere it is a neurosis rather than a real disturbance of the\r\ncirculation, however, that is involved, the use of a counter-irritant,\r\nby attracting attention more and more to the part, may really do more\r\nharm than good. In nervous people it must be remembered that local\r\nneurosis may occur almost anywhere in the body and that subjective\r\ndiscomfort alone in these cases must not be taken to signify a\r\npathological condition, unless the localization is such as to indicate\r\nthat a particular group of muscles is affected. The differential\r\ndistinction between a pure neurosis and a discomfort due to a true\r\npathological condition in the intermuscular planes is, that in the one\r\ncase a group of muscles is affected, while in the other a locality is\r\ncomplained of, and {394} while local tenderness is likely to be a\r\nmarked source of complaint in the neurosis it is comparatively slight\r\nas a rule in the muscular condition.\r\n\r\nFor the more chronic soreness and discomfort of muscle groups,\r\nmanipulations with massage are of great importance. Undoubtedly the\r\ndiscomfort and soreness is due in most cases to a disturbance of the\r\nvenous or lymphatic circulation of the parts. This interferes with the\r\nnutrition of nerves and leads to nerve sensitiveness from lack of\r\nnutrition, or actual nerve irritation from pressure upon sensitive\r\nnerve endings while in a state of congestion. These conditions may be\r\nrelieved by gentle manipulation and by massage, provided always these\r\nmeasures are not painful. These encourage the circulation and very\r\nsoon tend to restore functions. Just as soon as the pain of these\r\nremedial measures or of any mechano-therapy becomes noticeable, it is\r\nnot likely that they are doing any good. Pain, of course, must be\r\njudged from conditions and not from the patient's complaints, which\r\nmay be due to fear lest pain should be inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that local treatment, gentle, simple, yet directed\r\nwith the proper therapeutic purpose so as to create a favorable\r\nexpectancy in the patient's mind, will do much for these conditions,\r\nwhich have in many ways been the opprobrium of modern medicine. The\r\nrule has almost been to call them rheumatism, because they were worse\r\nin rainy weather. The word rheumatic instinctively calls up in most\r\nphysicians' minds some cut-and-dried formula of internal medication.\r\nSo these patients go the rounds of the regular practitioners in\r\nmedicine taking a series of these formulae in succession and, as a\r\nrule, not getting any better. Then they go to an osteopath or to a\r\nnaturapath, or some other kind of path, have some local massage and\r\nmanipulations performed, which restores the circulation of the part,\r\nto some degree at least, and as a consequence they are encouraged to\r\nlook for further relief. Not a few of them find the relief they look\r\nfor, and it is these cured patients that in many parts of the country\r\nhave insisted on securing for the osteopaths legislative recognition\r\nand actually obtained it for them in many cases, just because the\r\nregular physicians have neglected methods of cure ready to hand, but\r\nnot made use of, because drugs are allowed to occupy their attention\r\ntoo exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisuse, Atrophy and Pain.--I have seen a striking example of atrophy\r\nand pain due entirely to disuse in the upper part of the leg as the\r\nconsequence of a fall. No bone was broken, the man was laid up for\r\nnearly a month from the wrench, and then continued to be somewhat halt\r\nfor many years. After nearly twenty years his attention became\r\nconcentrated on this limb and then he spared it more and more in his\r\nwalking, tilting his pelvis and merely swinging that leg, until there\r\nwas a difference of nearly two inches between the size of the thighs.\r\nOf course, under these circumstances any use of the limb brought\r\nfatigue and pain with it. To walk was painful, and he had some\r\ntwitchings at night. There was no disturbance of sensation, however,\r\nanywhere and no reaction of degeneration. His knee jerk was slighter\r\nthan on the other side, but it was present and the weakness was due to\r\nthe loss of power in the muscles. It was only weak in proportion to\r\nthe atrophy of the muscles. This atrophy was not trophic in the sense\r\nof any failure of nerve impulses from the central nervous system, but\r\nwas due to disuse, that is, it did not come from any nervous lesion,\r\ncentral or peripheral, nor from any disturbance of circulation, but\r\nfrom the dwindling of muscles that inevitably {395} comes when they\r\nare not employed for their proper purpose. Power to use depends on\r\ncontinuance of function.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of remedies had been employed in his case, but he did not\r\nimprove until he was made to understand that there was no bone lesion,\r\nno lesion of nerves or muscles, and that what he needed to do was to\r\nre-exercise his muscles gently but persistently and confidently back\r\nto their normal strength. This was accomplished by exercise and\r\nresisted motion, with care never to fatigue the muscles, but at the\r\nfirst sign of tiredness to stop, taking up the exercises at first\r\ntwice, and then three and four times a day.\r\n\r\nAs can be readily understood, these curious atrophic muscular\r\nconditions from disuse occur more frequently in the legs than in the\r\narms. They may, however, occur in the upper extremities and are noted\r\nsometimes in the trunk. After all, certain of the stooping postures of\r\nmen as they get old are due to lack of use of the large muscles at the\r\nback with consequent atrophy of them to the extent that makes standing\r\nup straight an effort very fatiguing and even painful. To attempt to\r\nstraighten an old man by means of braces will lead to the development\r\nof painful conditions of tiredness if the correction is emphasized. In\r\nthe arms the atrophic conditions are not so noticeable because the\r\narms may be used without having to do the hard work required of the\r\ntrunk and leg muscles in holding the man erect. It is the fear of the\r\nstrain put upon them by this weight that makes the disuse continue,\r\nsince there has come into the mind the thought that the muscles cannot\r\nbe used to bear the weight and the burden is thrown on other muscles\r\nwith unfortunate results.\r\n\r\nMany of these atrophies from disuse are cured by mental influence of\r\none kind or another. They are the best sources of profit and\r\nreputation of the \"healers.\" Once the patients become persuaded that\r\nthey can use a group of muscles if they will, they begin to improve,\r\nand it is only a question of six or eight weeks until they are so much\r\nbetter that they persuade themselves that they are as well as ever. It\r\nis easy to understand that if a person who has been lame for five to\r\nfifteen years, vainly going to physicians of all kinds, is cured by\r\nsome new form of treatment, all the non-medical world is perfectly\r\nsure that there must be much in the new method of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION MUSCLE AND JOINT PAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one variety of painful conditions of muscles and joints,\r\noften spoken of as muscular rheumatism or as chronic rheumatism and\r\nfrequently the source of so much discomfort that patients feel that\r\noccupations must be given up, even at a great sacrifice. These deserve\r\na special chapter. They occur in persons who have some occupation\r\nwhich requires them to use a particular group of muscles a great\r\nnumber of times during the day. They are most frequent in the arms,\r\nbut they may be seen in the muscles of the neck, they occur very often\r\nin the legs and are not at all infrequent in the muscles of the trunk.\r\nWhenever a patient comes complaining of a painful condition in a\r\nparticular group of muscles, careful inquiry must be made as to his\r\n{396} occupation, with details of the movements required. These pains\r\nare, of course, as are all human discomforts, worse on rainy days and\r\nin damp seasons, so that this has come to be known as rheumatic\r\nweather. It is easy to assume without further inquiry that they are\r\nrheumatic and this has been done frequently in the past.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any occupation involving frequent and habitual use\r\nof muscles which may not be the source of discomfort if the actions\r\nnecessary for it are done in such a way as not to use the muscles to\r\nthe best mechanical advantage. In other words, there are a whole group\r\nof occupation fatigues which may take on a character of painful\r\ndiscomfort if the individual has not been properly trained in the use\r\nof his muscles. This refers not only to the use of muscles in the\r\naccomplishment of rather difficult tasks, but especially for those\r\nthat require nice co-ordination for their accomplishment, though they\r\nmay not demand the exertion of much muscular energy. In other words,\r\nwhat we have to deal with are rather painful occupation-neuroses than\r\nmuscular fatigue in its proper sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters' Ache.--Perhaps the most typical example of these is the\r\npainful conditions that may develop in connection with writing.\r\nWriters' cramp is well known and consists in a contraction of muscles\r\nwhich makes it increasingly difficult to hold the pen properly for\r\nwriting and may eventually make it impossible to do so. This is\r\naccompanied by a certain amount of distress, but the writer's\r\ndiscomfort that is much more common than writers' cramp does not occur\r\nin the fingers, but in the large group of muscles just below the elbow\r\nand may extend even to the shoulder. The pain is of a vague achy\r\ncharacter and as it is worse on rainy days and in damp weather, the\r\ntemptation to think of it as rheumatism is very great. It occurs in\r\npeople who write very much and rapidly, but especially those who write\r\nin a bad position. Now that the typewriter has come in much less is\r\nheard of it than before among reporters, but it used to be common with\r\nthem. There is very little hint that it is due to writing, unless one\r\nmakes careful inquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gowers' Rule_.--Its occurrence can be lessened to a great extent by\r\nfollowing Sir Wm. Gowers' directions as to writing. Gowers was a\r\nparliamentary reporter before becoming a physician and he learned the\r\ndifficulties of much writing and studied out the causes of the\r\ndiscomfort as well as of the cramp and of the best methods to avoid\r\nit. His rule is to sit on a rather high chair before a rather low\r\ntable so that the elbow swings free of the table and the writing is\r\nwhat is called free-hand. The extent to which Gowers demands this\r\nfreedom of the elbow carried may be best appreciated from his\r\ndirection that the writing must be done in such a way that if a second\r\npen were fastened to the elbow, it would write exactly the same thing\r\nthat is written by the pen held in the hand. There must not be any\r\nmovements of the fingers nor of the muscles of the forearm. All the\r\nmovements required from writing must be accomplished from the\r\nshoulder. Just as soon as sufferers from vague aches and discomforts\r\nfrom much writing learn this method of writing, their aches disappear\r\nto a great extent. My own experience in the matter, when, as a medical\r\nreporter, I often wrote ten thousand words a day, taught me the value\r\nof the suggestion. During one winter I suffered so much from\r\ndiscomfort in the shoulder that I was sure that I had a progressive\r\nrheumatic affection. Just as soon as I learned to write properly the\r\ntrouble was minimized to such {397} a degree that I realized that it\r\nwas merely a question of faulty writing. I have noted over and over\r\nagain, as is true in my own case, that if there has previously been\r\nany injury in the arm, this discomfort is much more likely to develop\r\nthan otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation Pains and Habitual Muscle Movements.--What is true for\r\nwriting is true for any habitual movement of groups of muscles\r\nrequiring careful co-ordination. I have seen it in marked form in the\r\nmakers of cigars and the strippers of tobacco. I have seen it in men\r\nwho do much filing and whose working bench is so high, that pressure\r\ndirect from their shoulders cannot be brought into play to supply any\r\nforce that is needed in carrying on the filing process. If such a\r\nseries of movements as filing is to be accomplished with comfort, then\r\nthe arms must be held straight, the force being applied from the\r\nshoulders and not by the exertion of the muscles of the forearm, which\r\nare meant only to guide and not to supply the needed pressure. The\r\nSloyd methods of working at benches are particularly important for\r\nworkmen if they are not to develop these curious painful conditions\r\nwhich are due to habitual wrong use of muscles, and not to any\r\ndiathesis. Any and every form of work must be looked at from this\r\nstandpoint. Women often iron at a table or ironing board placed too\r\nhigh for them, and as a result apply the pressure necessary through\r\ntheir forearm muscles. If they are at all of nervous constitution they\r\nwill suffer rather serious discomfort from this after a time and this\r\nwill always be worse in damp weather. I have known women ready to give\r\nup because of the discomfort thus occasioned, who found that they\r\ncould work without muscle discomfort for much longer periods, if the\r\nironing board was placed low enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arm and Shoulder_.--The occupation aches and discomforts in the arm\r\nand shoulder are very frequent and their variety presents an\r\ninteresting study in the individual and his history. I remember once\r\nhaving three cases present themselves at a dispensary service of the\r\nPolyclinic Hospital on the same day, all presumably suffering from\r\nrheumatism. One of them was a motorman suffering from the occupation\r\npains that so often come to those who use their arms overmuch, and the\r\npains seen so frequently, for instance, in baseball pitchers. These\r\npains are always worse on rainy days and in damp weather. There is of\r\ncourse a large individual element as the basis of these. Why can one\r\nman pitch nearly every day all season and not suffer with his arm\r\nwhile another man cannot? We can no more tell the reason for this\r\ndifference than we can tell why one man is right-handed and another\r\nleft-handed. One individual has a store of nervous energy that serves\r\nhim very well. Another has a store of nervous energy that serves him\r\nwell enough for his left hand but not for his right hand. The mystery\r\nwould seem to be the original endowment of nerve force according to\r\nthe individual's constitution. The motorman who suffers severely from\r\nputting on the brake of a heavy car will probably never be able to\r\ncontinue his occupation with comfort to himself unless his sore arm is\r\ndue to some temporary condition, easily recognizable.\r\n\r\nA second of my patients with rheumatism complained of his shoulder. He\r\nhad been first easily fatigued, then it was painful when he moved\r\nmuch, most so on rainy days, and finally he had practically lost power\r\nin it entirely. His occupation was that of finisher in a molding\r\nworks. He lifted a heavy hammer many hundreds of times a day with his\r\nright arm, striking quick short {398} blows and using mainly his\r\ndeltoid muscle in the lifting process. It was just his deltoid that\r\nwas affected and the nerve supply had evidently given out. The third\r\nman complained not of his right hand, but of his left and of his\r\nforearm, not his shoulder, having lost power especially on the ulnar\r\nside of his hand. He was a stonecutter, who held a chisel firmly in\r\nhis left hand, grasping it mainly with the under or ulnar side of his\r\nhand, and consequently overusing the group of muscles supplied by his\r\nulnar nerve, leaving that structure open to pathological conditions.\r\n\r\nThere was just one feature in the history of all three that was the\r\nsame. They did not drink alcohol to excess often, but they did take\r\nsome whiskey straight every day. The easiest explanation seemed to be\r\nthat there was a neuritis set up in the nerves, which their\r\noccupations caused them to use so much, and that, as a consequence,\r\nthe low grade neuritis finally developed to such a condition as to\r\nmake further use of the muscle supplied by the affected nerves\r\npractically impossible. Just why alcohol will select certain nerves\r\nand not others upon which to exercise its deteriorating influence and\r\nwhy lead usually affects an entirely different set we do not know. In\r\nthe ordinary man of sedentary occupation who walks occasionally, as\r\nhis only exercise, his most used nerve is his anterior peroneal. Those\r\nof us who are not used to walking much, know how soon this nerve\r\ncomplains of fatigue when we take some forced ambulatory effort. It is\r\nthis nerve then that with most people is affected by alcohol. But any\r\nnerve that is overused will apparently be affected the same way, and\r\nas many outdoor workers take some whiskey straight pretty regularly,\r\nit is not surprising to find that some of them have an idiosyncrasy\r\nand develop a low grade alcoholic neuritis.\r\n\r\nAlcohol, however, is not the only substance that acts thus\r\ninsidiously. I was once asked to treat a painter who was suffering\r\nfrom intense tired feelings in his right forearm. They were always\r\nworse on rainy days, and he had been treated for rheumatism without\r\navail. He had no signs at all of wrist-drop, there were no suspicious\r\nsigns on his gums and he had never suffered from constipation or\r\nanything like lead colic. It seemed far-fetched, then, to say that his\r\nmuscles were fatigued mainly because of the irritating presence of\r\nlead in the nerves supplying his right forearm. He slipped on the ice,\r\nhowever, and sprained his wrist, and the next day turned up with a\r\ntypical lead wrist-drop. This fact of having lead poison develop\r\nshortly after an accident is not unusual, just as a sprained ankle may\r\nsometimes be the signal for an outbreak of alcoholic neuritis in the\r\nlower leg which has been preparing for some time, the accident itself\r\nbeing at least partially accounted for in many cases by the\r\nawkwardness of muscles with disturbed nerve supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leg Occupation Pains_.--What is true of the arm is also true of the\r\nleg. If a man uses his leg muscles very much and especially at any\r\nmechanical disadvantage, he usually suffers painful discomfort that is\r\nalways worse on rainy days. Before the invention of the electric\r\ndental engine, dentists used to suffer from this and the profession\r\ntalked about the \"dentist's limp.\" This was also more painful in damp\r\nweather and many of them were treated for rheumatic conditions, though\r\nit was really only over-fatigue.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurosis and Neuritis.--There are many cases of painful conditions in\r\nthe limbs where it becomes difficult to diagnose between a neurosis\r\nand a neuritis. The usual differential characteristic of tender points\r\nalong the course of the {399} nerve cannot be used in many patients\r\nwith confidence, because they are prone constantly to respond to the\r\nquestion \"is that tender\" in the affirmative. Besides in a neurosis\r\nthere always seems to be a hypersensitiveness of the nerves involved\r\nthat may simulate the tenderness of neuritis. In a number of obscure\r\ncases I have felt that the condition was a real neuritis when the\r\ndevelopment of a corresponding condition on the other side, or relief\r\non one side followed by development on the other, has led to the\r\ndiagnosis of neurosis. Of course, a double neuritis may well occur in\r\nthe same nerve on both sides of the body under certain toxic\r\nconditions. Double sciatica nearly always indicates glycosuria.\r\nDiabetes may cause double neuritis in any other much used pair of\r\nnerves. Alcoholic neuritis may manifest itself on both sides.\r\nOrdinarily, however, the transference of symptoms or their spread to\r\nthe other side of the body means a neurotic condition.\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases where it has been difficult to distinguish\r\nbetween neuritis and neurosis, a change of occupation or some strong\r\ndiversion of mind for a considerable period or a change of residence\r\nhas proved the beginning of a cure. I have seen what was considered by\r\nexperienced physicians to be a chronic low-grade neuritis of quite\r\nintractable form clear up completely as the result of the young woman\r\nbeing compelled to take up a wage-earning occupation, when it had\r\nalways seemed before as though life was going to be smooth and there\r\nwas no necessity for her to labor. I know of cases of so-called\r\nneuritis that had been very obstinate to treatment that were cured by\r\nEddyite treatment. What really happened in these cases was that a\r\ngroup of muscles used considerably more than usual had produced a\r\npainful tired condition referred to a particular nerve. Just as soon\r\nas the mind's inhibitory action was taken off them by the persuasion\r\nthat there was nothing the matter with them the patient proceeded to\r\nget well, gradually progressive use bringing back the normal trophic\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscomforts of Bursae.--In any consideration of painful conditions in\r\nand around joints, especially in connection with occupations, the\r\nquestion of the formation and of the inflammation of bursae must be\r\ninsisted upon because many of these inflammatory incidents are\r\nconfused with joint affections and not infrequently treated as if they\r\nwere due to constitutional disturbance. Practically everybody is\r\nfamiliar with housemaid's knee. Most people know that bunions are\r\ninflammations of the bursae which form over the metacarpo-phalangeal\r\njoint of the big toe whenever there is pressure and irritation of it.\r\nVery few realize, however, that frequently repeated irritations, when\r\npressure is exerted over other joints and bony projections, will\r\nproduce a bursa, and then, if the irritation continues and an\r\nopportunity for infection occurs, there is bursitis. Some of these are\r\nmistaken for other conditions and often have been thought by the\r\npatient to be serious developments of one kind or another with regard\r\nto which there has been much solicitude. An interesting case of this\r\nkind in my experience was that of an Italian organ-grinder who\r\nsuffered from the occupation bursa which so often forms over the\r\nanterior superior spine of the ilium because of the frequently\r\nrepeated rubbing of the hand and arm as it passes this region while\r\nturning the handle of his instrument. It had finally become inflamed,\r\nand the Italian was much disturbed and he feared that it was\r\nappendicitis.\r\n\r\nOther bursae are not commonly seen in America. I have seen bursae over\r\n{400} the elbows of miners, and in one case saw one of these inflamed\r\nso that miner's elbow became a concrete entity. This case had been\r\ntaken for an acute inflammatory arthritis with the suspicion of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPAINFUL ARM AND TRUNK CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCervical Ribs.--Some interesting cases with painful conditions of the\r\narms develop as a consequence of the presence of cervical ribs. It\r\nwould be more or less naturally expected that trouble of this kind\r\nwould occur early in life, but, as a matter of fact, many of the\r\npatients are well on toward thirty or even beyond middle life when the\r\npainful symptoms develop. Cases are practically always at the\r\nbeginning diagnosed as rheumatism because the first symptom is likely\r\nto be pain followed by weakness. Even when this quite fruitless\r\ndiagnosis is not made, the affection is often declared to be rheumatic\r\nneuritis, though it is really a traumatic neuritis and entirely a\r\nlocal condition, as are so many of the painful conditions spoken of as\r\nrheumatism. Usually the pain is referred to the inside of the arm and\r\nis described as resembling slight toothache at first and even severe\r\ntoothache after a time. It will often be many months or even several\r\nyears after the first symptoms before wasting of muscles occurs, but\r\nthis practically always follows after a time and even at this stage\r\nsome physicians still talk of rheumatic neuritis as affecting the\r\ntrophic nerve fibers and causing the muscles to waste. Almost a\r\ndifferential diagnostic sign in the case of cervical ribs is that\r\nraising the arms above the head nearly always relieves the pain.\r\nPatients usually learn this for themselves because they have been\r\ntempted to place their arms in many positions in order to get relief.\r\nThe reason for it is easy to understand as the elevation of the arms\r\nchanges the relative position of tissues in the neck and so relieves\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe direct reason for the late development of the disease is probably\r\nthe ossification of the cervical rib and the pressure of this hard,\r\nbony substance upon the roots of the brachial plexus. When the disease\r\noccurs as early as the age of 30 there is likely, for some reason, to\r\nhave been a preceding loss of weight. Patients are run down and then,\r\neither because there is a precocious calcification as a consequence of\r\ndeterioration of tissue, or because the loss of substance in the\r\nmuscles in the neighborhood makes the nerves more likely to be pressed\r\nupon, the first symptoms develop. There is only one way definitely to\r\ndecide the diagnosis. That is to have a careful skiagraph, or, in case\r\nof negative results, several of them taken, in order to determine the\r\npresence or absence of cervical ribs. Not all the cases of cervical\r\nribs give symptoms and in one recently published series of 26 cases\r\njust one-half presented symptoms and the other half did not, but all\r\nthese vague cases of pain in the arm, especially if any tendency to\r\natrophy manifests itself, should be examined from this standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Local Conditions_.--The subjective symptoms in these cases often\r\ninclude {401} much more than pain. There may be numbness and the hands\r\noften feel cold, though they do not become blue. As a rule, indeed,\r\nthe arms are more affected than the hands, though not infrequently one\r\nof the hands becomes more sensitive to injuries than the other and, as\r\na rule, both hands do not heal well after injury. Even scratches take\r\na long time to heal and slight abrasions cause skin lesions that are\r\nmore or less indolent for some time before healing. Any fresh injury,\r\neven of slight degree, puts back healing much more than would\r\nordinarily be the case. In fact, most of the so-called tendency not to\r\nheal is local rather than constitutional. When a patient complains\r\nthat though his or her tissues used to heal rapidly now they are very\r\nslow to heal, it is well to think of nephritis or diabetes but it is\r\nespecially important to know the local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleural Adhesions.--Another interesting cause of pains in the arms is\r\nthe possible contraction of adhesions of the pleura and surrounding\r\ntissues at the apices of the lungs and the spreading by continuity of\r\na low-grade inflammation even to the lower roots of the brachial\r\nplexus. A certain number of cases of this kind have been reported in\r\nwhich there seems to be no doubt of the diagnosis. In these, the early\r\nsymptoms were pains or aches in the arm followed by some weakness of\r\nmuscles and even some trophic disturbances. Ordinarily the condition\r\nhas been very acute as, for instance, a pneumonia when the first\r\nsymptoms were noticed. In the course of the exudation and the\r\ncontraction of the inflammatory exudate the brachial plexus is\r\ninterfered with. This, like the cases referred to the presence of a\r\ncervical rib, emphasizes the necessity for thoroughly studying local\r\nconditions in order to understand the meaning of painful conditions in\r\nthe arms. It is easy to say the word rheumatism, while it requires\r\ntime and careful investigation to find the real pathological factor at\r\nwork; but the difference in the value of the two diagnoses for both\r\npatient and physician can be readily understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Conditions.--Besides these, there are the various conditions\r\ndiscussed in other chapters of this section--old injuries, breaks and\r\ndislocations, so-called sprains with laceration of tissues, and any\r\nserious pathological condition that has affected the tissues deeply.\r\nAn old periostitis, for instance, will leave an arm rather easily\r\nliable to the development of various painful conditions. Of course, a\r\ntuberculous process anywhere in the arm will produce a like effect. An\r\narm that has had a lead neuritis will often be uncomfortable in rainy\r\nweather for long after and a crutch palsy may, in the same way, leave\r\nthe arm sensitive. The musculo-spiral palsies that occur from lying on\r\nthe arm when drunk, or that are seen sometimes in coachmen who wrap\r\nthe reins around their arms--a Russian custom--or the nerve conditions\r\nseen in patients who have suffered from an anesthetic nerve-pressure\r\ndisturbance, may all be at the bottom of subsequent painful\r\nconditions, worse in rainy weather. The only sure rule is to\r\nindividualize the cases and make an exact diagnosis. The etiology will\r\nprobably suggest itself if the history is carefully taken.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the most important treatment is to disabuse the\r\npatient's mind of the idea that there is rheumatism, or any other\r\nconstitutional ailment present, and to make him realize that the\r\ntrouble is entirely local. After this, the strengthening of the\r\naffected muscles must, as far as possible, be secured by local\r\nmeasures and exercises.\r\n\r\n{402}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLUMBAGO AND SCIATICA\r\n\r\n\r\nAny affection involving discomfort, pain, ache, or disability of the\r\nlarge muscles in the lumbar regions is likely to be called lumbago,\r\nnot only by patients but by physicians. Any condition that makes it\r\npainful to use the upper part of the lower limb and especially the\r\ngroup of large posterior leg muscles just below the nates is called\r\nsciatica. These are commonly supposed to be typical \"chronic\r\nrheumatisms.\" Anything in this region that is the source of discomfort\r\non rainy days and comes especially to the working man who has been\r\nexposed to the elements, or that follows a wetting or the wearing of\r\ndamp clothes, is confidently classified as a chronic rheumatic\r\ncondition. Almost needless to say any such conclusion as to the\r\nheterogeneous groups of symptoms that occur in these regions, far from\r\nadding to our knowledge, rather confuses the situation. There is an\r\nassumption that we know something about them when we call these\r\nconditions either lumbago or sciatica, but unless each individual case\r\nis carefully investigated and its conditions studied so as to get at\r\ntheir true etiology, it is almost impossible to treat them\r\nsuccessfully. While the general practitioner of medicine of the\r\nregular school often fails in his treatment of them, these affections\r\nare among the most fruitful sources of revenue for the irregular\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly for pains and aches in the back that St. John\r\nLong's liniment proved so efficacious about a century ago. So-called\r\nlumbago and sciatica patients were among the most frequent callers on\r\nPerkins in the days of the famous tractors and many of them received\r\ngreat relief. In our own time these constitute a class of patients who\r\ngo from physician to physician and who finally are cured or relieved\r\nby some irregular practice which we know contains nothing especially\r\nremedial, but the advocates of which somehow succeed in persuading\r\nthese patients that they must be better than before. Most old people\r\nhave some aches and pains in either the lumbar muscles or the large\r\nmuscles at the back of the thigh. Many of them are relieved by\r\nmassage, but still more of them find relief in the rubbings and\r\nmanipulations of the osteopaths, and they are great advertisers of the\r\nrelief that has been afforded them and they have helped much in\r\nsecuring such state recognition as has come to the systems they\r\nthought curative in their cases. Eddyism has been helpful to a certain\r\nnumber of them. Fads of various kinds catch still others. Evidently\r\nthese intractable cases deserve to be studied from the standpoint of\r\nwhat mental influence can do for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions Mistaken for Sciatica or Lumbago.--Needless to say, a large\r\nnumber of conditions occur which may be called sciatica or lumbago,\r\nbut which are due to the most varied causes. An affection of any of\r\nthe joints in this neighborhood will produce pain to which is often\r\nadded tenderness and occasionally swelling, and nearly always\r\ndisability. Disease of the lower part of the lumbar spine due to\r\ntuberculosis is often in its earlier stages called lumbago. Indeed,\r\nwithout careful investigation showing that there is a special point of\r\ntenderness, some irregular fever and that the muscles are in spasm\r\n{403} to protect the underlying joints from use, it is difficult to\r\ndecide just what is the affection in a particular case. I have seen\r\nthree physicians diagnose a one-sided tenderness and pain in muscles\r\nwith disability as lumbago, when the course of the disease proved that\r\nit was tuberculosis of the sacro-iliac joint. Any of the bones or\r\njoints in this neighborhood may give rise to pain, tenderness and\r\nspasm of muscles and it is important not to make the facile diagnosis\r\nof lumbago, unless careful investigation has eliminated all underlying\r\norganic conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are other conditions not infrequently mistaken for lumbago or\r\nsciatica which are interesting. Needless to say unless they are\r\ndefinitely recognized there will be no relief afforded for any\r\ndiscomfort of a permanent character, though the coal-tar products will\r\ngive temporary surcease of pain. Occasionally internal hemorrhoids\r\nproduce an achy discomfort in the lower part of the back that is\r\ndescribed as lumbago, and unless the physician is careful to\r\ninvestigate he may tentatively accept that diagnosis. Proper\r\nregulation of the bowels and the use of gluten suppositories will\r\noften practically cure the condition, though there will be relapses\r\nwhenever constipation returns. Chronic posterior urethritis sometimes\r\nsimulates painful conditions very low down in the back or in one hip\r\nor the other. Usually in that case there is a chronic inflammatory\r\ncondition in the seminal vesicle on the side to which the symptoms are\r\nreferred. Occasionally over-distention of the seminal vesicles, as\r\nseen in widowers who have been accustomed for many years to regular\r\nevacuation of them, may cause so much pain and disability in the\r\nregion of the hip on one side as to be mistaken first for lumbago and\r\nthen even for tuberculous hip joint disease. Artificial emptying of\r\nthe seminal vesicle by milking through the rectum will usually afford\r\nrelief. In all of these cases as soon as the exact diagnosis is made,\r\nthe patient's mind is relieved of a serious burden of anxiety and it\r\nis usually not difficult to bring a great measure of relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Injuries and Discomfort_.--Many of the painful conditions\r\ndescribed as lumbago are due to old injuries, to wrenches and sprains\r\nin this region due especially to heavy lifting and to the laceration\r\nof ligaments from over-exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Typhoid Spine_.--Protracted cases of typhoid are sometimes followed\r\nby pain in the lumbar or sacral regions, developing usually after a\r\nslight jar or shock, sometimes after a fall or even following a severe\r\ninjury, which are really the result of the physical condition of the\r\npatient. Stiffness, aching discomfort on movement and sometimes\r\ntenderness on pressure are present. Often there are associated\r\nneurotic symptoms of various kinds. This used very commonly to be\r\nconsidered rheumatism and occasionally one still sees cases so\r\nlabeled. On the other hand, much more serious conditions, as Pott's\r\ndisease, abscess of the liver, or some form of spondylitis, may be\r\nsuspected. Absence of temperature is almost the rule and usually is\r\nthe pathognomic differential against these. The whole condition is\r\nusually a neurosis though there may be some perispondylitis. The\r\ntreatment is to increase the patient's nutrition, which has usually\r\nsuffered to a marked degree, and get the mind off the condition in the\r\nback. Concentration of attention on it will make it very\r\nuncomfortable, so that even heavy doses of opiates will scarcely\r\nrelieve the discomfort, and this emphasis of attention will further\r\ndisturb the mind and develop neurotic {404} symptoms. Diversion of\r\nattention, gentle movements, plenty of air, and regulation of the\r\nfunctions of the body will bring about a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nStooping Occupations.--Occupations are especially important in lumbago\r\nand people who have to stoop much, above all those who do hard work in\r\na stooping position--lifting, pushing, sawing, planing, and the\r\nlike--are particularly prone to suffer. Miners working where the\r\nheight of the vein does not permit them to stand up are commonly\r\nsubject to it. Any one who has to assume, or has the habit of\r\nassuming, a stooping posture for long hours may suffer from lumbago.\r\nConstrained position predisposes more than hard work. Tailors, though\r\nin a sedentary occupation, often suffer from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIATICA\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--What has been said of lumbago applies to a great extent\r\nalso to sciatica. There are a number of different affections which\r\nhave come to be grouped under the term sciatica. Here, much more\r\nfrequently than in the lumbar region, the cause of the pain is a true\r\nneuritis. This may be of many forms. Occasionally it is syphilitic in\r\norigin; whenever the sciatica is double it commonly develops on a\r\nbasis of diabetes, while in many cases it is of an infectious nature.\r\nThere is no special reason to think that there is a rheumatic\r\ninfection of the nerve, though inasmuch as rheumatic arthritis is\r\nprobably due to infections by many different kinds of microbes, it may\r\nwell be that some of these play a role in sciatica. There is no good\r\nreason, however, why the word rheumatism or the term chronic\r\nrheumatism should be applied either to lumbago or to sciatica.\r\nCertainly there is no reason in any definitely known etiology of the\r\naffections. Each individual case must be studied carefully. Always\r\nthese are local and not constitutional conditions, and usually\r\nsomething in the patient's occupation, or in his habits of life, helps\r\nus to understand the development of sciatica or lumbago and gives the\r\nmost valuable hints for treatment.\r\n\r\nMen who shovel much and who bend one knee as they stoop in shoveling\r\nwill often suffer, though more frequently in the leg which they do not\r\nbend than in the other. The same thing is true for men who use one\r\nfoot to run a lathe or a small printing press, or anything of that\r\nkind. They must be taught to alternate in the use of their limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pressure_.--Occasionally direct pressure upon the nerve is the cause\r\nof the disturbance. I once was asked to see in consultation an elderly\r\nlady who had complained very much, first of discomfort and then\r\nnumbness in her legs, until finally she lost all power in them below\r\nthe knees. The affection was considered to be some sort of creeping\r\nparalysis. I found that her favorite chair, an old-fashioned cushioned\r\neasy chair, allowed her to sink down so that the edge of the wood seat\r\nframe pressed upon her just where the sciatic nerve comes closest to\r\nthe surface. As soon as the habit of sitting on this chair was changed\r\nher numbness and inability to use her limbs began to disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic Neuritis_.--In both lumbago and sciatica one underlying\r\nfactor is often present. This is the consumption of undiluted whiskey\r\nin considerable quantities. Outdoor workers are prone to take an\r\noccasional glass of whiskey, especially in the winter time, and a\r\ncopious quantity of malt liquors in the summer. Both of these\r\npredispose to the development of a low-grade {405} neuritis in\r\nsusceptible individuals. Alcohol is said to have an idiosyncrasy for\r\nthe anterior tibial nerves. That only means, as a rule, however, that\r\nthese nerves are more frequently affected by alcoholic neuritis than\r\nothers in the body. The reason for this special location of the\r\naffection is that in people who stand and walk much, this constituting\r\ntheir main form of exercise, these nerves are much used. They are\r\nprobably in such people (that is, if the intensity of impulses that\r\npass through them be taken into account) the most used nerves in the\r\nbody. It is this that makes them most susceptible to alcohol. In\r\npeople who stoop much or who have to work hard in stooping postures,\r\nthe nerves in the lumbar region and those that make up the sciatic\r\ntrunk are over-used. This makes them more susceptible to pathological\r\ninfluences than others, hence the tendency for neuritis to develop in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intrapelvic Causes_.--Sciatica may be due to various pathological\r\nconditions within the pelvis. Women with fibroid tumors are\r\nparticularly likely to suffer from it. Their removal by operation does\r\nnot always assure against the occurrence of sciatic troubles. I once\r\nsaw an obstinate case of sciatica in which there was a story of a\r\nfibroid having been removed years before and, though there were no\r\nsigns of any recurrence of the growth of another, there were some\r\nadhesions in the region, and there was an obstinate constipation\r\nparticularly likely to have as one symptom an accumulation of fecal\r\nmaterial in the rectum until it was very hard. The keeping of the\r\nbowels open meant more than anything else for the relief of the\r\nsciatica. This patient subsequently died from what was diagnosed by a\r\nwell-known French surgeon as rupture of the bowels. This was probably\r\ndue to the adhesions that occurred after the old operation, done\r\nwithout any regard to the possible development of such a sequela, some\r\ntwenty years ago. The sciatica was undoubtedly connected with the\r\ngroup of disturbed conditions within the pelvis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position at Work_.--In this case, as in others that I have seen, the\r\nposition assumed while at work seemed to have been an appreciable\r\nfactor in the production of the pain in the limb. The lady made her\r\nliving by writing and often wrote on a board resting on her knee--a\r\nfeminine, not a masculine habit. This brought pressure to bear upon\r\nthe right limb a little more than the other and then, when she crossed\r\nher knees in order to put the writing board on top of the knee, this\r\nside seemed to be used more than the other.\r\n\r\nThis question of the position in occupation, even though sedentary, is\r\nvery important. I have seen a strikingly typical case of the so-called\r\n_neuralgia paresthetica_, the achy condition of the outside of the\r\nthigh with some anesthesia and paresthesia, occur in an old lady who\r\nstill retained the girlish habit of sitting on her foot while she did\r\ncrocheting. I have often seen achiness of muscles of the trunk develop\r\nin persons who read much in a cramped position because of the reading\r\nlight being too low or otherwise wrongly placed for group reading.\r\nWhenever a patient has to stand much on one foot while doing\r\nsomething, it is important to remember that there should be\r\nalternation in the use of the limbs; otherwise sciatica and lumbar\r\npains will often develop, usually on the side corresponding to the\r\nlimb that is kept rigid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--_Mental Persuasion_.--The patient must be made to realize\r\nthat his affection is not rheumatism, but is due to local conditions.\r\nJust as soon as a patient's mind is relieved by being made to\r\nappreciate that certain habits in his occupation, or certain local\r\nconditions that can be corrected, {406} are responsible for much of\r\nhis discomfort, then that discomfort is much easier to bear. Even in\r\ncases where actual neuritis has developed, or where there have been\r\nchanges in the intermuscular planes bringing considerable disability,\r\nthe aches caused by these will be much more bearable if the patient's\r\nmind is set at rest as to the real significance of the condition. No\r\ncondition should be called rheumatic unless at some time in the\r\nhistory of it there was an acute inflammatory condition with Galen's\r\nclassical symptoms--_tumor, color, rubor_ and _dolor_. Pain alone is\r\nnever sufficient to justify the diagnosis. Painful disability is\r\nusually due to local causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Acute Symptoms_.--For acute symptoms, the coal tar\r\nproducts may be used and usually afford distinct relief. They include\r\nall the old-fashioned salicylates as well as certain more recent\r\ncompounds, such as aspirin. Phenacetin, however, though usually not\r\nthought of in this connection, is an excellent remedy for the\r\ndiscomfort. These drugs should be used freely so as to give relief\r\nfrom the painful condition. The fact that they afford relief, however,\r\nshould not be taken as an argument that the condition is rheumatic.\r\nRheumatism, as we know it, is an acute infectious disease and there is\r\nno reason in the world for saying that the salicylates or cognate\r\ndrugs are specifics in this affection. They relieve the pain, but just\r\nin the same way they would relieve the pain of toothache or of any\r\nother painful condition. After the acute symptoms are removed, the\r\ncondition that remains may be treated in various ways, by massage, by\r\nlocal applications, and by such manipulations as will restore the\r\nnormal circulation of the part. Care must be taken, however, to\r\ndistract the patient's mind from the local condition after a time, or\r\nmental influence, by interfering with the capillary circulation, may\r\ninveterate the symptoms. It is not good to keep patients at rest,\r\nthough rest, of course, is always indicated if there is much\r\ndiscomfort. Sometimes, however, the discomfort is really due to the\r\nfact that muscles have not been used for some time and so are easily\r\nfatigued and may ache even under ordinary use. In this case, a gradual\r\nrestoration of the muscles to normal strength by progressively\r\nincreased exercise is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counter-Irritation and Its Suggestive Value_.--Personally, I have\r\nfound the use of turpentine particularly efficacious in connection\r\nwith suggestion. The old-fashioned system of ironing seems to do more\r\ngood than any ordinary application of turpentine. For this a piece of\r\nflannel wrung out in warm water has some turpentine scattered over it\r\nand then is placed on the affected loins or back of the thigh and\r\ncovered by another piece of flannel, and a hot flat-iron is rubbed\r\nover it. The physical effect is a considerable hyperemia, but the\r\neffect upon the patient's mind is especially interesting, the\r\nunusualness of the mode of application adding decidedly to the effect.\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that there are some people who are\r\nover-susceptible to the influence of turpentine, and its use is\r\nfollowed by a rash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lumbar and Sciatic Psychoneuroses_.--Many cases of lumbago and\r\nsciatica are really psychoneuroses. They develop exactly as\r\npsychoneurotic conditions do in the abdomen or in joints. Not\r\ninfrequently there is some accident or injury, some sprain or strain,\r\nor exposure to dampness or draft, that serves as the occasion. The\r\nGermans group all these occasions together under the word \"insult.\"\r\nThe \"insult\" produces little physical effect but after some days or\r\nsometimes weeks, the slight discomfort present secures the center of\r\n{407} attention and then the patient suffers from what seems to be\r\nsevere pain and often inability to move or use muscles. Even when\r\nthere is true sciatica or lumbago, that is, a genuine low-grade\r\nneuritis of the lumbar or sciatic nerves, most of the symptoms may\r\ncome from the associated psychoneurosis. This is proved to be so by\r\nthe fact that such patients are often cured, for the time being at\r\nleast, by some shock or fright or sudden excitement, that makes them\r\nmove, forgetful of the pain and inability from which they suffered\r\njust before. Besides, such cases are often cured by inert remedies of\r\nmany kinds, by local applications that have no specific effect, and by\r\nvarious methods of treatment which cannot be responsible for the\r\nrecovery. The amelioration of the condition is due to the mental\r\ninfluence accompanying the methods of treatment and the reassurance of\r\nthe patient's mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diversion of Attention_.--Almost anything that produces a continuous\r\nsuccession of sensations on the surface of the affected area that\r\nattract and hold the attention of the patient may prove a valuable\r\ntherapeutic suggestion and even eventual relief from symptoms that\r\nhave proved obstinate to more rational treatment. Liebault, the\r\nwell-known founder of the Nancy school of hypnotic therapeutics, tells\r\nin his \"Therapeutique Suggestive,\" that he has frequently cured\r\nlumbago by the simple recommendation of a rather stiff piece of paper\r\nto be applied over the patient's loins. The rationale of this\r\ntreatment seems to be that the patient's attention is attracted to the\r\nskin surface by the sensations constantly produced by it and attention\r\nis distracted from other feelings deeper in the muscles. It often\r\nhappens that after an acute lumbago has run its course, there is left\r\na chronic achiness only partly physical and largely psychoneurotic.\r\nSome of it is undoubtedly due to the habit, formed during the acute\r\nperiod, of keeping the muscles quiet, in order to avoid the spasmodic\r\npain that occurs on movement. Patients cannot, as it were, let go of\r\ntheir muscles, and their discomfort is largely due to holding them in\r\na cramped position. The sensation produced by the paper on the\r\ncutaneous nerves distracts the attention and brings about relaxation\r\nof the muscles with decrease of discomfort and gradual relief of all\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThe paper acts as a constant source of suggestion for the cure of the\r\npsychoneuroses when the affection is purely psychoneurotic. The mind\r\nhas become concentrated on the idea of pain and discomfort in this\r\nregion and needs another thought to occupy itself with so as to\r\nneutralize this. Wearing the paper with the assurance, for instance,\r\nthat because of its impermeability to air it keeps the part more\r\nthoroughly protected from variations of temperature and from such\r\npossibilities of transudation as have before been possible, serves to\r\nlift patients out of themselves and affords relief. Whenever the\r\nsensation produced by the paper is noted, there is a renewal of the\r\nsuggestion and its curative effects. There are many plasters that have\r\nobtained the reputation for curing lumbago. It is doubtful whether any\r\nof these have sufficient medicaments on them to be of any serious\r\npharmaceutic significance. They are mostly rubber plaster. The\r\npresence of this and the consciousness of the sensation produced by it\r\nacts as favorably as does Liebault's sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Agents_.--It must not be forgotten, however, that a large\r\nsheet of adhesive plaster firmly applied may act as a mechanical\r\ntherapeutic agent, somewhat in the same way that strips of adhesive\r\nplaster relieve the pain of pleurisy, or are helpful in a sprained\r\nankle or a knee. The muscles may be {408} held rather firmly together\r\nand so there is no necessity for constant attention to prevent\r\nspasmodic pain. Undoubtedly some of the newer large-sized adhesive\r\nplasters produce an excellent effect in this way. If, besides, the\r\npatient has the feeling that they must be doing him good because of\r\nmaterials in their composition, the psychoneurotic elements are more\r\nreadily relieved. The old idea was that such plasters drew out the\r\npathological elements to the surface whence they were dissipated.\r\nThere is no truth underlying this thought.\r\n\r\nIn the old days blisters were applied rather freely to these regions\r\nand the actual cautery was often employed. Both of these therapeutic\r\nprocesses are likely to do good in chronic cases, but much more from\r\ntheir psychic than their physical effects. The actual cautery is not\r\nused nearly so much as it ought to be in chronic muscular and neurotic\r\nconditions, for the mental effect of its application and the\r\ndistraction of attention to the skin surface while the cauterized\r\nareas are healing are excellent remedies.\r\n\r\nThere are other counter-irritant procedures of the same kind that have\r\nbeen used with reported successes in many cases. Hot needles, for\r\ninstance, if pushed deeply into the muscles, often have an excellent\r\neffect. Some years ago a distinguished surgeon insisted that both\r\nlumbago and sciatica might be cured in many cases by the insertion of\r\nneedles deeply into the muscles. He argued that what happened was that\r\nthese needles brought about an equilibrium of electricity in the\r\nmuscular structures which had somehow been disturbed. Deep injections\r\nof water into the muscles also do good. Stretching of nerves has been\r\napplied with reported success. After a time all of these measures\r\nfail, however, because somehow after the novelty of the treatment\r\nwears off for the physician, the patient's mind is not sufficiently\r\nimpressed and then the former results are not secured. Where there are\r\nactual neuritic processes present they will almost surely fail. So\r\nmany of these cases are almost pure psychoneuroses, however, that it\r\nis little wonder that anything which produces a strong impression on\r\nthe mind and leaves after it some condition that attracts attention\r\nand so furnishes favorable suggestion will almost surely cure even\r\nchronic conditions for which all sorts of physical remedies, employed\r\non rational grounds, have failed.\r\n\r\nAnything that modifies the circulation, even to a slight degree, or by\r\ncausing a reaction in the local vaso-motor state, alters previous\r\nconditions, tends to enable the patient to control the affected part.\r\nThese psychoneurotic conditions in large muscles help us to understand\r\nwhat happens in organic diseases. There is a physical element that\r\nmust be modified, but unless a strong influence is brought to bear\r\nupon the mind so as to arouse all its capacity for control, the cure\r\nwill not come. Anyone of a dozen things, however, may be used in this\r\nway and often when one fails another will succeed. In obstinate cases\r\nof lumbago and sciatica if necessary a number of these forms of\r\ntreatment should be used successively.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypnotism_.--How much pure psychotherapy may mean for many of these\r\nobstinate cases of lumbago and sciatica can be appreciated from the\r\nmany reports of cures by hypnotism or by suggestion in a light\r\nhypnoidal state, or occasionally, under favorable circumstances, even\r\nin the waking state. One of these cases, indeed, is responsible to\r\nsome extent for the French interest in hypnotism which attracted so\r\nmuch attention in the last quarter of the {409} nineteenth century.\r\nProf. Bernheim of the University of Nancy had seen a case of sciatica\r\nin which every therapeutic means at his command had failed. As the\r\nresult of disuse the leg was emaciated and possessed little muscular\r\npower. It looked as though the man would never be able to regain the\r\nuse of it properly. Dr. Liebault succeeded in curing the patient by\r\nlight hypnotic sleep, in which the suggestion that he would be better\r\nwas given while the physician stroked the limb. After the first seance\r\nthe patient was able to use the leg better and the discomfort was\r\ngreatly decreased. Further seances with Dr. Liebault brought further\r\nimprovement until finally the condition was cured. Prof. Bernheim, who\r\nknew how intractable these cases are, had the case called particularly\r\nto his attention and naturally wanted to learn more about the method\r\nby which it had been brought about. Liebault's methods had been quite\r\ncontemned by the regular faculty before. After a series of experiences\r\nunder Dr. Liebault's direction Prof. Bernheim became enthusiastic over\r\nthe use of hypnotism as a curative agent and this led to the\r\npublication of his well-known work \"De la Suggestion et ses\r\nApplications dans la Therapeutique.\"   [Footnote 34] It was the\r\ninterest aroused at Nancy that led Charcot to take up hypnotism, and\r\nwhile he came to very different conclusions, there is no doubt that\r\nthe work at Nancy meant much for our knowledge of suggestion in both\r\nwaking and hypnotic state in therapeutics.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 34: On Suggestion and its Applications in Therapeutics.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPAINFUL KNEE CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the painful knee conditions of which patients complain are not\r\ndirectly due to true pathological conditions either of the knee joint\r\nitself or of its neighboring structures, but rather to affections of\r\nother portions of the leg that set a special strain upon the knee and,\r\nabove all, to various kinds of foot disturbances. The erect position\r\nis maintained principally by a nice balance of nervous and muscular\r\nenergy in the knee joint and its surrounding structures. Any irregular\r\nsensory or motor impulses to the knee-joint or to the muscles of the\r\nthigh will disturb the absolute equilibrium of the flexors and\r\nextensors and will make standing painful or even impossible. Whenever\r\na morbid condition requires a different use of the muscles and tendons\r\naround the knee from that to which they are accustomed, fatigue\r\nreadily ensues, and aches and even tenderness in muscles and tendons\r\ndevelop as the result of the over-exertion. These collateral\r\nconditions must not be overlooked in the diagnosis and treatment of\r\npainful knee conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiological Factors.--Even a slight sore on one foot will give rise to\r\nconsiderable achy fatigue of the knee of the opposite leg, because,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, we stand much more on that leg, use it\r\nmore in walking, and spare the other because of the pain induced by\r\nuse of the foot. Above all, throwing more weight on the other leg\r\ncauses us to use muscles a little abnormally with consequent soreness.\r\nThis painful fatigue is most likely to be felt around the knee, though\r\nit may extend to the hip and even the lumbar {410} region of the well\r\nside if the foot continues to be spared for a number of days.\r\nParticularly will this be true if there is anything the matter with\r\nthe big toe, on which so much of the use of the foot depends. An\r\ningrowing toenail will not infrequently give so much discomfort to the\r\nwell knee and hip as to make the patient sure that there must be some\r\nrheumatic or other condition at work in these joints. The serious\r\naffection of the joint which the patient apprehends is found to be no\r\nmore than a sympathetic fatigue induced by having to use his feet, or\r\none of them, a little differently from usual, perhaps because of some\r\ncondition that leads him to spare them. To call the patient's\r\nattention to this is of itself therapeutic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inequality of Legs_.--The effort required for standing and the\r\naccurate balance of the muscles involved in it is such that any\r\nmechanical disturbance of the feet or legs or even a trivial\r\npathological condition causes painful fatigue. It must not be\r\nforgotten, for instance, that the presumption that human limbs are of\r\nexactly the same length is not confirmed by accurate measurements.\r\nThere is an average difference of probably half an inch in length\r\nbetween the limbs of normal persons, and there may be even a\r\ndifference of more than an inch before deformity is said to be\r\npresent. The longer limbs are likely to do more work and are,\r\ntherefore, more subject to fatigue and consequent complaint. One of\r\nthe reasons why we can distinguish persons by their gait even at a\r\ndistance is that the difference in the length of their limbs makes\r\nnoteworthy characteristics in their walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_High Heels_.--People who are used to walking in a natural manner and\r\nwho don a pair of high-heeled shoes for the first time are sure to\r\ncomplain of pain in the calf and knee, because the high heels require\r\nthem to hold the knee more rigid and in a somewhat different position\r\nfrom that required when the persons stand under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. It is the unusual in muscular effort that gives rise to\r\nthe extreme fatigue which becomes positive pain if it is allowed to\r\ncontinue. It is curious how small a raising of the heel will cause\r\ndiscomfort. Over and over again I have known the careless putting on\r\nof rubber heels to be responsible for pains around the knee, which in\r\ndamp weather were the source of so much discomfort that it was hard to\r\npersuade the patient that he was not suffering from rheumatism or some\r\nserious incipient pathological condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unusual Occupations_.--Joint pains often develop after the patient\r\nhas been doing something quite unusual and putting an unaccustomed\r\nstrain upon his muscles. I have often seen dispensary patients whose\r\nknee pains began after there had been a family moving. In the course\r\nof the removal of household goods, both men and women are likely to\r\nhelp in hanging pictures, in taking them down, in moving heavy\r\nfurniture and other occupations of this kind which make them extremely\r\ntired. If there is any tendency to relaxation of joint structures the\r\ntiredness may manifest itself as a sense of painful discomfort. The\r\nknees are particularly likely to suffer if there is a relaxed\r\ncondition anywhere in the leg. It must be remembered that the laxity\r\nof tissue which predisposes a patient to weak or flat feet will have a\r\ntendency to produce some looseness of fiber, at least, also in the\r\ntissues around the knee. The patient may not have a wabbling knee, nor\r\nmay he be able to overextend the limb, but still there will usually be\r\nsome noticeable relaxation of the tissues which will help in the\r\nproduction of the painful condition by {411} making exaggerated calls\r\nupon the muscles in order to keep the joint in proper position in\r\nspite of the over motion in it.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance is most frequent in waiters, store clerks, tailors'\r\ncutters and fitters, bench men in the trades, and in all those who\r\nhave to spend much time on their feet. I have seen many such ready to\r\ngive up their occupations, though they had no other resource and the\r\nfuture looked very blank, indeed, away from their work. It was\r\ndifficult at first to persuade them that a slight yielding of the arch\r\nhad so changed mechanical conditions in the use of the muscles of the\r\nleg as to produce such pains. But as soon as they were put in a\r\ncondition where their arch was not allowed to sink, they were at once\r\nrelieved of their discomfort to a great extent. The question of\r\ntreatment is discussed more fully in the chapter which follows on Foot\r\nTroubles.\r\n\r\nAn interesting set of painful conditions around the knee develops in a\r\nclass of people in whom it might least be suspected of being due to\r\nover-exertion connected with their occupations. These are lecturers,\r\nclergymen, teachers, and others who, for several hours each day, are\r\non their feet in a position from which, as a rule, they do not move,\r\nbut stand almost perfectly quiet. A distinguished laryngologist has\r\npointed out that not infrequently men who come to be treated for the\r\nchronic laryngitis, which is known as clergymen's sore throat, but\r\nwhich is seen so frequently in those who have to talk in the open air,\r\nauctioneers, cart-tail orators about election time, and in lecturers\r\nto large audiences who do not know how to use the voice, also complain\r\nof grievous discomfort from painful knee conditions which often makes\r\nthe ascent or descent of stairs a painful task. He attributes the\r\nsimultaneous occurrence of these conditions to some blood dyscrasia,\r\nuric acid, or the like, affecting the two most used sets of muscles\r\nand organs, the legs and the vocal cords. Whenever I have seen this\r\ncondition--and circumstances have brought me into intimate personal\r\nrelations with many clergymen and lecturers--the trouble at the knee\r\nhas been due to some yielding of the plantar arch, while the laryngeal\r\ncondition, if present, was due to an erroneous mode of using the voice\r\nconsequent upon lack of proper training.\r\n\r\nSufferers of this kind must be warned not to stand absolutely\r\nimmovable while addressing an audience. Some men stand without moving\r\nduring a whole hour's lecture. This is unfortunate, for it obstructs\r\nthe return circulation through the tense muscles, for the venous\r\ncirculation was intended to be helped by muscular contraction. Many a\r\nman finds, as he comes down from pulpit or platform, that his knees\r\nare stiff and sore, though a moment before he knew nothing about it.\r\nThe failure to notice any discomfort before is of itself an example of\r\nthe influence of the mind over the body for the relief of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated Lumbar Discomfort.--The painful condition around the knee\r\nwhich develops when high heels are worn is almost sure to be\r\naccompanied by pains, or at least a tired feeling, in the back. If we\r\nconvince the patient that the trouble is due merely to a derangement\r\nof the mechanism involved in maintaining the erect posture we shall\r\nhave scant need of medicine or even of local treatment. But as the\r\npain is much worse on rainy days, owing to the relaxation of the\r\nmuscles, we must be careful to remove the patient's suspicion that the\r\npain must have a rheumatic origin. The restoration of normal\r\nmechanical conditions with the removal of the cause will prevent the\r\n{412} recurrence of the affection, and if some discomfort remains, the\r\npatient will not worry, and the muscles will gradually grow accustomed\r\nto the strain upon them. Of course, these conditions of discomfort are\r\nmore common in those who are not naturally strong, who are run down,\r\nwho are under-weight, or whose neurotic tendency will make any\r\nirritation seem worse than it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavy and Light Patients.--Two classes are likely to suffer more than\r\nothers from these conditions. They are the people who are overweight\r\nand the people who are underweight. Those who are overweight exert\r\nmuch more effort to maintain the erect posture than ordinary people,\r\nand, besides, in most adipose persons the distribution of weight is\r\nsuch that a disproportionate amount of it is carried forward of the\r\nnormal center of gravity. High heels cause a further tilting forward\r\nthat has to be counter-balanced, and that, at least at the beginning,\r\ngives rise to muscular discomfort. In people who are underweight the\r\nnutrition of the muscles has suffered, and, as a consequence, they are\r\nnot able to support the frame as well as before. In them the\r\nadditional effort necessitated by the tilting tendency of high heels\r\nis particularly felt because such people are nearly always among the\r\nneurotically inclined.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscle Disuse.--Sometimes treatment of these conditions seems to lead\r\nup to the disuse of certain muscles and the over-use of others. I\r\nfollowed for several years an interesting case of this kind in which\r\nthe course of the affection was so typical as to deserve to be\r\nrecalled. A fuller account of the case occurs in my paper on\r\n\"Rheumatism versus Muscular and Joint Pains\" in _The American Journal\r\nof the Medical Sciences,_ August, 1903.\r\n\r\nIn that case the joint symptoms caused by the pinching of a loose\r\ncartilage within the joint occurred suddenly on two or three\r\noccasions, so that a surgeon deemed it wise to put the knee in\r\nplaster. As a consequence, some atrophy of the muscles of the leg\r\noccurred, and a halt became habitual in the gait. Through this halting\r\ngait, the muscles of the back on the same side were also spared and\r\nthus became somewhat atrophied. Painful conditions developed in the\r\nmuscles of the other side of the back from the over-use necessary to\r\ncompensate for the condition on the less-used side. All of the muscles\r\non the affected side became painful, apparently because of the\r\natrophic condition to which they were reduced.\r\n\r\nThe young man, though with the best of good will, was utterly unable\r\nto conquer the tendency to halt in his gait, and so the muscles\r\nremained under-exercised and were used at a mechanical disadvantage,\r\nwith the usual painful result. He went to at least two prominent\r\northopedic surgeons, who assured him that all he needed was confidence\r\nin himself to walk straight, and that then the normal condition of the\r\nmuscles and absence of pain would result. But their directions were\r\nabsolutely without result. He went through the hands of masseurs, of\r\nosteopaths, of rubbing quacks of all kinds, and suffered at least two\r\nattacks of artificial eczema as a consequence of the use of turpentine\r\nliniments, but he remained after it all in what he considered to be an\r\nintensely miserable condition. These cases are practically always\r\ncured by definite exercise of the muscles of the affected limb so as\r\nto bring them back to their normal tone. It requires special attention\r\nfor this purpose, however, and the patient's mind must be brought to\r\nunderstand that at first the unaccustomed use of muscles will cause\r\ndiscomfort, but that this will disappear after a time. These patients\r\nare persuaded that they must be \"cured\" to get well.\r\n\r\n{413}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFOOT TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more physicians see of affections of the feet and of painful\r\nconditions of the legs due to foot troubles the more they realize that\r\nthe human faculty of the erect position becomes the source of many\r\ndiscomforts unless care is taken of the muscular apparatus of the\r\nlegs. There are few people engaged in standing occupations who do not\r\nsuffer from their feet. These achy sensations are especially\r\nbothersome if the patient is run down in health, or is in the midst of\r\nworry or irritation from physical or mental stress. Even under\r\nfavorable conditions there are few who reach old age without serious\r\nfoot troubles or without, at least, some deformity of the feet, which,\r\nby preventing or limiting exercise, have an important influence upon\r\nthe general health. Careful analysis of the conditions that develop\r\nwill convince an observer that yielding of the joints of the foot has\r\nmuch to do with the deformities and that the wearing of unsuitable\r\nshoes rather than any internal pathological condition is responsible\r\nfor the foot troubles that are so common.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoot Deformities in All Classes.--An Englishman who visited this\r\ncountry, and who had ample opportunity to observe our people, declared\r\nafter seeing the bathers at Newport, that there were two interesting\r\npeculiarities of American masculine anatomy--the deformity in their\r\nfeet and the appearance of having swallowed a watermelon whole and\r\nretained it within them. The latter condition has doubtless much to do\r\nwith the causation of the former. Inactive lives, overeating, and the\r\noverweighting of flaccid limbs that are not capable of bearing even\r\ntheir normal burden, complicated by tight and ill-fitting shoes, give\r\nrise to the deformities of the toes that are so common--hammer toes,\r\nover-riding toes, bunched toes, twisted toes, bent toes. Examples of\r\nmost of these are sure to be seen wherever we observe our men and\r\nwomen bathing. The Englishman's observation was of our so-called\r\nbetter class--at least, our leisure class. Ordinarily, it is assumed\r\nthat clerks, waiters, and others, who have to stand upon their feet\r\nare the principal sufferers from foot deformities. They are, but they\r\nare not alone, and a goodly proportion of the population suffers in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Factors.--The most important deformity in these cases is a\r\nyielding of the arch of the foot with consequent flattening of the\r\ninstep and lengthening of the foot. This overstretches especially the\r\nflexer tendons which run underneath the arch, produces bunions, and\r\ngives occasion for the development of corns. The pull upon the flexor\r\nlongus hallucis which runs along the inside border of the foot, gives\r\nrise to the bunion by pulling the big toe outward--in the direction of\r\nleast resistance. The pressure upon the tendons of the flexor longus\r\ndigitorum pedis causes the smaller toes to bend somewhat, and this\r\ngives rise to projecting angular points on which corns readily form.\r\nBesides, the imperfect action of the muscles of the foot consequent\r\nupon the fall of the arch gives rise to plantar corns and callouses\r\nthat are often painful. The living cushion of muscle which is the best\r\nprotection against injury, while walking or running, has its vitality\r\ninterfered with by {414} the fall of the arch and the consequent\r\nblocking of the return circulation through the thin walled veins. This\r\ngives rise to cold feet and, in those who stand much, to the tender\r\nfeet that are now so much complained of and for which so many foot\r\npowders and appliances are advertised.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfusion of Rheumatism and Foot Troubles.--Most foot troubles are\r\nreflected up the leg because muscles have to be overused or used at a\r\nserious mechanical disadvantage. This combined discomfort of foot and\r\nleg is readily referred to rheumatism. Some of the pains produced by\r\nyielding of the arch are in the ankle, some are in the calf, some in\r\nthe tissues around the knee, and some even in the muscles and tendons\r\nabove the knee. It is much easier to say \"rheumatism\" than to\r\ninvestigate carefully and differentiate the conditions that may be\r\npresent. Out of forty successive patients who came to the dispensary\r\nof the Polyclinic Hospital of New York complaining of rheumatism,\r\neighteen were suffering from flatfoot. Out of twenty-four who thought\r\nthey had rheumatism in the feet or legs eighteen proved to be cases of\r\nflatfoot. Of the others, one was suffering from that rare disease\r\nmeralgia paresthetica, two were suffering from sciatic neuritis, one\r\nwas suffering with sub-acute joint trouble consequent upon pinching of\r\na cartilage within the knee joint, and one had a painful condition\r\nconsequent upon an old dislocation of the ankle due to a fall,\r\naccompanied by considerable laceration of the soft tissues. Analyses\r\nof the cases left no room for the so-called chronic rheumatism which\r\nhad so easily covered all the cases at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt was not unusual to see patients who had consulted many physicians\r\nand taken all sorts of internal and external remedies for the\r\nrheumatism that they supposed was causing their discomfort, yet who\r\nhad nothing more than flatfoot. Their condition had become so bad that\r\nsome of them had actually given up occupations that required them to\r\nstand. Merely following the advice to wear flatfoot braces in their\r\nshoes relieved these patients almost as if by magic. There was no need\r\nto measure them particularly; all they needed was an ordinary set of\r\nflatfoot braces. Some of them needed only a pair of good shoes, but\r\nthe metal braces were advised to make sure that there would be a firm\r\nsupport for the arch of the foot. No wonder the \"magic shoe-maker\" had\r\nsuch success in New York a few years ago.\r\n\r\nNearly always the shoes worn by dispensary patients are of the worst\r\nkind, considering the condition. The patients' feet are often cold,\r\nand they think this is nature's demand for heavy shoes, so they buy\r\nheavy shoes and large sizes so as to be sure they will not hurt their\r\nfeet. This clumsy footgear allows the arch to drop still further\r\nbecause no proper support is furnished, and the foot-trouble becomes\r\nmore poignant. Then working people nearly always wear older shoes on\r\nrainy days, and this makes two elements for discomfort instead of one.\r\nThe yielding arch is already a source of discomfort which is more\r\nnoticeable in rainy weather because any affection around a joint is\r\nmore bothersome at such times. The support that a new pair of shoes\r\naffords to the arch is lacking when what are so aptly termed \"sloppy\r\nweather shoes\" are worn, and the consequence is that the patient is\r\nparticularly miserable in damp weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Disease Suggestions.--Of the cases in my experience of\r\nso-called rheumatism in the legs, over one-half are due either to\r\nflatfoot or to the incipient yielding of the arch which is called weak\r\nfoot. Rheumatism is {415} most commonly held accountable for the\r\ncondition, though gout comes in for its share of blame with quite as\r\nlittle justification. Occasionally some even more serious pathological\r\ncondition is appealed to. I have seen the tendency to passive\r\ncongestion in the feet with slight swelling around the ankle\r\nconsequent upon the yielding of the arch called kidney trouble in\r\nspite of the fact that there was nothing in the urine to justify any\r\nsuch diagnosis. I have even known the coldness of the feet, which is\r\nlikely to be a symptom of the disturbed circulation consequent upon\r\nthe yielding of the arch, attributed to heart disease. As we shall\r\nsee, most of the curious deformities of the old that make locomotion\r\nso difficult and so painful are due to a breaking down of the arch\r\njust after middle life and then to a progressive deformity of the\r\nfoot. The mechanics of the support of the body are sadly interfered\r\nwith when the arch yields, for bones are pushed out of place and\r\nligaments and tendons are lengthened in order that the foot may\r\naccommodate itself to the new conditions. In nearly all these cases\r\nthe patients are prone to say that they are sufferers from rheumatism.\r\nThis diffuses and inveterates the notion which is a source of many\r\nunfavorable suggestions, that rheumatism is a curious progressive\r\ncrippling disease which begins insidiously but advances remorselessly\r\nand eventually leaves its victim a prey to deformity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGout and Flatfoot.--Bunions consist originally of an enlargement of a\r\nbursa over the proximal end and the inner side of the big toe in order\r\nto protect the bone and joint from friction. If the irritation is\r\ncontinued, the proximal end of the first phalanx may enlarge, though\r\nusually this is preceded by a series of attacks of more or less acute\r\ninflammation of the bursa, when the bunion is said to \"become\r\nsensitive.\" I have seen these attacks called gout so often that I feel\r\nsure that much of the gout reported in this country is nothing more\r\nthan bunions. There is true gout, and it is probably almost as\r\nfrequent with us as it is in England, but many of the so-called cases\r\nare really flatfoot associated with development of the bunion that so\r\ncommonly occurs as the arch yields.\r\n\r\nI was once asked to see a physician's wife who was thought to be a\r\nsufferer from gout. Long ago Oliver Wendell Holmes said that, as the\r\nshoemaker's children are likely to wear the worst shoes of the\r\nvillage, so the doctor's family is likely to take the least medicine,\r\nthat is, be subjected to the least formal medication. The physician\r\nhad seen the more or less acutely swollen and red enlargement of the\r\nbase of the big toe, and heard his wife complain of the severe pain\r\nassociated with it, and had suggested the possibility of gout. After\r\nrest in bed and the administration of salicylates and colchicum, the\r\npain subsided and the redness and much of the swelling disappeared.\r\nThis was a typical illustration of one event following another without\r\ncausal relation. The succession of events was taken as a therapeutic\r\ntest of the diagnosis of gout, and the patient was advised to regulate\r\nher diet so as to prevent the further accumulation of urates or uric\r\nacid in her blood. She was warned about eating red meat, about taking\r\nacid fruits, and about the acid fermentation of starchy vegetables.\r\nThe main result of eating only white meat is apt to be simply a\r\nlimitation in the amount of meat eaten, because white meat is less\r\nsavory and after a time palls on the appetite. In the same way fruit\r\nwas largely eliminated and sweets were taken out of the diet and\r\nvegetables were limited.\r\n\r\n{416}\r\n\r\nAs she did not escape recurrent attacks of soreness in her bunion,\r\nwhile at the same time there were achy feelings in her foot, she took\r\nup the careful study of the dietary for gouty patients which she found\r\nin the books in her husband's library. So many things have seemed\r\npossibly deleterious for gouty people that it is not surprising that\r\nafter a time nearly everything worth eating except a few cereals and\r\nmilk and eggs had to be eliminated and she began to suffer from\r\ninanition. Then, after a time, came constipation, due to the\r\ninsufficient amount of residue in her intestines, and this, partly by\r\nphysical action but largely by mental suggestion, still further\r\ndiminished the appetite for food, and a loss of over twenty pounds in\r\nweight was the result. The weakening of the general muscular system\r\nconsequent upon this loss emphasized the trouble with the foot and the\r\npainful condition at the base of the big toe became more marked.\r\n\r\nThe supposed necessity for more exercise in the open air led her to\r\nwalk long distances and in order to prevent her feet from hurting her,\r\nas she thought, she wore roomy shoes, distinctly too large. This is\r\none of the common mistakes of people whose feet bother them, and it is\r\njust the wrong thing to do, since a snug, well-fitting shoe provides\r\nboth support and protection. It is not surprising that the attacks of\r\nsub-acute bursitis became more frequent and more painful.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I saw her, and, as I feared to disturb the family\r\nharmony by suggesting that the whole trouble was a bunion and\r\nflatfoot, I compromised by saying that, while there might be some\r\ngout, there was undoubtedly flatfoot, and if she would wear the proper\r\nsort of shoe and stop limiting her diet so strenuously, and cease\r\nsuggesting to herself that she had a progressive gouty affection that\r\nwould lead to deformity and decrepitude, she would soon be much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIt required tact to make her look favorably on this advice, after all\r\nthat she had gone through during months of limited diet and enforced\r\nexercise. Though not quite convinced, she was ready to try the new\r\nmethod. She began to be better as soon as she was fitted with a pair\r\nof shoes that supported her arch and as soon as her increased\r\nnutrition began to make itself felt. At the end of two weeks she was\r\nable to give up the remedies for constipation that she had been using\r\nfor nearly a year, while at the end of four weeks she had regained ten\r\npounds of weight and felt much better.\r\n\r\nSeveral years have passed since I saw her professionally and\r\noccasionally I hear from her only to be told what a great measure of\r\nrelief it afforded her and how much better she has been as a\r\nconsequence of a few simple directions with regard to her feet. I have\r\nseen at least a dozen of cases of so-called gout in educated people\r\nwhich followed almost exactly the same course and yielded promptly to\r\nthe same treatment. The hardest symptom about these cases to cure is\r\nthe cherished mental conviction that they are the victims of\r\nconstitutional disease, either gout or rheumatism, to which all their\r\nsymptoms are attributed. They are cases for psychotherapy more than\r\nany other form of therapeutics and need for a considerable period to\r\nhave repeated assurances of the entirely local character of their\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nBunions and Flatfoot.--The etiology and preventive treatment of a\r\nbunion has always seemed to me to bear a closer relation to a flat\r\nfoot than to anything else. The flatfooted man has nearly always a\r\ntendency to bunions. The {417} explanation of this is not difficult if\r\none traces the relation between the tendons that run around the arch\r\nto the big toe. The usual etiological explanation, however, is that in\r\nyouth short shoes were worn which initiated a tendency to divert the\r\nbig toe inward toward the other toes. But there are many reasons\r\nagainst this explanation. Anyone who tries will find that it is\r\npractically impossible to wear shoes that are so short that the big\r\ntoe is crowded back. Women are more apt to shorten their shoes than\r\nmen, yet women suffer both from flat feet and from bunions much less\r\nthan men. The reason for this seems to be that the forward position\r\nwith the elevation of the heel of the shoe supports the arch and gives\r\nthe shoe a shape more fitted to the normal foot than is found in the\r\nmasculine flat-heeled shoe. Besides, this form of shoe maintains its\r\nshape better, and then, too, women are not so prone to wear old\r\nso-called comfortable shoes as are men.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the formation of the bunion in many cases seems to\r\nbe, that the large toe, instead of lying straight along the inner edge\r\nof the foot, is pushed or pulled toward the other toes. If this\r\nprocess began from the wearing of pointed shoes, especially if such\r\nshoes did not have a straight line on the inside, conditions within\r\nthe foot would soon tend to emphasize it. If the adductor hallicis\r\nonce gets the habit of contracting rather strongly, as it is likely to\r\ndo through the irritation set up by the yielding of the arch, it will\r\nbe hard for its opposing muscles to counteract it. More important than\r\nthis, however, is the fact that the tendon of the flexor longus\r\nhallucis runs along the inner border of the foot and is particularly\r\naffected by the yielding of the arch. For it works at a decided\r\nmechanical disadvantage under the new conditions and is stretched in\r\nsuch a way as to pull forcibly and constantly upon the big toe,\r\nnecessarily turning it more and more outward as the arch continues to\r\nyield. The dropping of the arch makes the distance from the heel to\r\nthe toe longer than before and the tendon pulls the toe as far outward\r\nas possible to compensate for this, as the distance to its insertion\r\nis thus made somewhat shorter.\r\n\r\nThe yielding of the arch lengthens the foot and puts the tendons of\r\nall the flexors on the stretch. All of them have a tendency to bend\r\nthe toes, and as this action is constant, gradually the tendons of the\r\nextensors become over-stretched and these muscles are not capable of\r\nexerting their full force in overcoming the action of the flexors. The\r\nflexor longus digitorum has a tendency to cause a bending of the small\r\ntoes, and as it also runs across the foot it pulls the toes somewhat\r\ninward, that is, toward the big toe. This crowding leads to hammer\r\ntoes and over-riding. The big toe, however, is maintained in a state\r\nof extension by its firm, full contact with the sole of the shoe and\r\nwith the floor when walking barefoot. The one direction in which it\r\ncan yield rather readily is outward toward the other toes because this\r\nshortens the distance between the end of the toe and the heel. The\r\npressure put upon the flexor longus hallucis will have a tendency to\r\ncause this, for it is over-stretched by the yielding of the arch and\r\nkeeps constantly pulling on the big toe until that member has a\r\ndistinct flexion outwards.\r\n\r\nThis makes the metacarpo-phalangeal joint prominent and then nature\r\nproceeds to protect it by a water cushion, a special bursa due to the\r\nformation between layers of connective tissue of a pocket in which\r\nsome serum is constantly present. One can scarcely admire enough this\r\nprovision of nature by {418} which she protects prominent bony points\r\nwhenever they are subject to much irritation or to such use as would\r\ncause injury to important structures below. If continued pressure\r\ncontinues to be irritating, however, the water cushion proves\r\nunavailing and an inflammation of the overlying skin occurs with\r\noccasionally a spreading of infectious agents from the surface into\r\nthe serum pocket below. This serum is such a good culture medium that\r\nan acute abscess is likely to form--the acute bursitis of the\r\nsurgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRarer Foot Troubles.--Besides bunions, a number of other deformities\r\nof the feet occur as a consequence of the yielding of the arch. All\r\nthe toes are likely to bend rather acutely, and the points of them are\r\npressed against the shoe, while the knuckles, so to speak, are made\r\nprominent and are more likely to be subject to corns than would\r\notherwise be the case. Besides, the displacement of the big toe toward\r\nthe little toes leads to a crowding of the toes together, and this\r\ngives rise to soft interdigital corns and to a lowered resistive\r\nvitality which may be the predisposing factor to slight infections of\r\nvarious kinds that will make the patients miserable. Such affections\r\nmay appear negligible, a matter for the chiropodist, and not deserving\r\nthe physician's attention; but they mean so much for the comfort of\r\nthe patient and the prevention of exercise through sore feet reacts so\r\ndeleteriously on the general health that these minor ailments become\r\nimportant and merit careful attention. Dr. Emmet tells the story of\r\nthe old family servant, always grumpy and complaining, who, when he\r\nhad the many blessings of life pointed out to him, confessed that the\r\nLord had been very good to him, but said, \"The Lord knows He takes it\r\nout of me in soft corns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hammer Toes--Clam Toes_.--Nature has provided a wonderful mechanism\r\nin the arch of the foot and the anatomical relations of the toes to\r\nsupport the weight of the body firmly, gracefully, and comfortably;\r\nyet any yielding of any part of it leads to a disturbance of its\r\ndelicate mechanical relations and, consequently, to ever-increasing\r\ndeformity. Hammer toes are typical examples of what such a disturbance\r\nmay lead to. One of the toes becomes pressed downward between two\r\nothers. This over-stretches the extensor muscles and tempts the\r\nunbalanced flexors to contract. As the extensor muscles become, after\r\na time, unable to work in the constantly bent toes, they atrophy to\r\nsome extent and then the flexor muscles pull the toe farther and\r\nfarther down until there is no possibility of its being straightened\r\nat all. Now, if the flexor tendons are cut and the toe straightened\r\nthe atrophic extensor muscles will not hold it in that position, and\r\nwhen the flexors grow together the old condition will reassert itself.\r\nIn the meantime, muscle changes in the neighboring toes have also\r\ntaken place. With no resistance on one side of them, they become bent\r\nsidewise over the hammer toe, and so their muscles on one side are\r\noverstretched and on the other side become contracted. After a time it\r\nis impossible to correct this series of deformities which are being\r\nconstantly increased and emphasized by the weight of the body above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent-day Shoes.--In recent years we have heard much more than\r\nheretofore about foot troubles. As the old-fashioned shoes were\r\ncarefully made by skilled shoemakers to fit the feet of one individual\r\nand not to conform to some supposed ideal pedal extremity, they\r\nsupported the feet much better than do the modern cheap machine-made\r\nshoes. These custom shoes lasted a long time, and, after they were\r\nonce molded to the foot, the wearer was not {419} disturbed for many\r\nmonths by the process of having to become accustomed to another shoe.\r\nThe many advertisements in quite recent times of foot powders and\r\nother artificial relief for the foot show that people are suffering\r\nmuch more than before, or, at least, are less able to bear the\r\ndiscomfort. These powders, however, are not likely to do good in the\r\nlong run, since they tempt the wearers to stand the discomfort against\r\nwhich they do furnish a certain amount of soothing. It is much better,\r\nhowever, for the sufferer to find the cause of the discomfort and to\r\nremove it if possible, for otherwise it will lead to constantly\r\ngrowing displacement of bones and muscles and may eventually even\r\nbring on actual and ever-increasing deformity.   [Footnote 35]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 35: How much deterioration of the tissues of the foot may\r\n  be brought about by improper footwear and, above all, by sedentary\r\n  life and the substitution of the trolley car for the exercise of\r\n  walking, is well illustrated by the functions that are lost. The\r\n  child can use its adductor and abductor muscles for the toes quite\r\n  as well as for the fingers. Those who go barefooted retain those\r\n  muscular powers. Some time we will be able to influence young folks'\r\n  minds enough to keep them from sacrificing all the more delicate\r\n  muscular powers of their feet to the fashion of small or curiously\r\n  shaped shoes. Armless men learn to use their feet almost as hands,\r\n  they write, pick up small articles, oven play musical instruments.\r\n\r\n  Some people have special muscular faculties, as, for instance, the\r\n  power to displace certain tendons and bring them back with a snap\r\n  which makes a distinct sound. The Fox sisters, to whom we owe the\r\n  origin of modern spiritism, confessed that this was the way they\r\n  produced their spirit rapping. Some mediums can, it is said,\r\n  dislocate the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis onto the edge of\r\n  its grove and then bring it back with a snap. Others can produce\r\n  partial toe dislocations which by muscular power are suddenly\r\n  reduced with a dull noise like the sound of a gloved hand rapping\r\n  beneath the table.]\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--The most important means of prophylaxis in these cases\r\nis to have patients who must assume the standing position for some\r\nhours each day, exercise their legs rather vigorously. If teachers,\r\nlecturers, and the like, have to stand for a long time, it is\r\nimportant that on the way to and from their occupations they should\r\nnot have to stand up in cars nor assume cramped and uncomfortable\r\npositions. It would be better for them to walk rapidly for several\r\nmiles rather than ride in a standing or a constrained position. If\r\nthey are convinced of the necessity for exercise, there is much less\r\nlikelihood of the development of the severer discomfort that is\r\nsometimes very discouraging. It is particularly difficult to make\r\nwomen understand this; yet, once they have found how much relief is\r\nafforded by vigorous exercise, they are likely to overdo it and thus\r\nrun the risk of incurring ills quite as serious as those consequent\r\nupon not taking enough. In nervous people the nagging discomfort of a\r\nyielding arch will sometimes (just as eye strain does) produce reflex\r\nheadaches, constipation, lack of appetite, and apparently predispose\r\nto the frequent recurrence of migrainous headaches. I have, in not a\r\nfew cases, seen these conditions relieved by rational treatment of the\r\nfoot condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCirculatory Disturbances Due to Flatfoot.--An interesting direct\r\nconsequence of flatfoot is the disturbance of the venous circulation,\r\nwhich is likely to bring about some swelling of the feet and nearly\r\nalways considerable coldness and numbness, particularly in the winter\r\nand, above all, on damp days during cold weather. The swelling of the\r\nfeet makes the patient think--sometimes at the suggestion of his\r\nphysician--of kidney trouble or heart trouble, and sometimes it is\r\nhard to persuade him that there is nothing serious the matter with\r\nthese important organs. The disturbance of the circulation further\r\nleads to numbness, to some anesthesia, and to paresthesia. Corns and\r\nespecially callouses grow more readily between the toes, and patients\r\nwho are prone to read about such ailments may conclude that they are\r\nsuffering from hypesthesia {420} and hyperesthesia due to some serious\r\nprogressive organic nervous disease. I once had a woman patient\r\ndiscourse learnedly to me about these things who was sure that she had\r\nthe beginning of some incurable spinal disease. Locomotor ataxia was\r\nthe least she might expect from her description of her feelings. What\r\nI found was flatfoot. Raising her arch cured her.\r\n\r\nThe cold feet and the numbness, to call them by simple Saxon names\r\nwhich will not disturb patients, may sometimes keep them awake. In the\r\nchapter on Insomnia we suggest that the best thing for this is to\r\nsecure a return of the circulation either by exercises, or by wearing\r\na flatfoot brace during the day, or by putting the feet in water as\r\nhot as can be comfortably borne and keeping them there for a quarter\r\nof an hour. Of these means exercise is the best. Raising up on the\r\ntoes after the shoes are off and coming down on the outside of the\r\nfoot strengthens the muscles, pulls the bones of the arch firmly\r\ntogether and encourages the circulation. For beginning flatfoot this\r\nis a curative measure and it is the natural mode of treatment for the\r\ncoldness and numbness of the feet. Rubbing, also, is good for the feet\r\nin order to restore the circulation, but patients are inclined to rub\r\ndownwards while they should rub upwards in order to help the hampered\r\nvenous circulation. The thin-walled veins are more likely to be\r\ncompressed by any disturbance of tissues than are the firm-walled\r\narteries, and it is to help the veins that our remedial measures must\r\nbe directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Consequences.--The secondary consequences of flatfoot are\r\ninteresting. It is surprising how many people who frequently suffer\r\nfrom sprains of the ankle have some yielding of the arch as a\r\npredisposing factor to that condition. Two classes seem to suffer\r\nfrequently from sprained ankle--those with yielding arches and those\r\nwith high insteps. Apparently there is weakness in the excess in both\r\ndirections. Very flatfooted people apparently do not suffer so\r\nfrequently from sprained ankles as those in whom there is only an\r\nincipient yielding of the arch. They seem to have learned to walk more\r\ncircumspectly. Perhaps, too, their well-known tendency to toe outward\r\nlessens their liability to turning on their ankle. The effects of\r\nsprains of the ankle in people with weak foot last, as a rule, longer\r\nand leave more weakness after them than they do in ordinary cases.\r\nThis, of course, might be expected, but it is surprising how often the\r\nsignificance of beginning flatfoot fails to be noticed even by the\r\nphysician. I have seen rather frequently cases of so-called chronic\r\nrheumatism in which there is a series of stories of sprained ankle\r\nbecause of the assumed weakness of the ankle from supposed rheumatism,\r\nwhen the whole case can be summed up in a yielding arch.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises.--If the arch has not yielded much, it is often unnecessary\r\nto prescribe flatfoot braces or arch supports of any kind, unless\r\nperhaps at first. After the first soreness has passed off, exercises\r\nmay be employed to strengthen the muscles. As we have said, the\r\npatient should rise on his toes and then come down slowly on the\r\noutside of his feet. He may be instructed to sit with his feet--not\r\nhis legs--crossed, the feet resting on their outer edges. He may be\r\nshown how even various slight movements of his toes, almost without\r\nmoving his shoes at all, will strengthen the muscles that pass around\r\nthe arch, which, thus strengthened, will hold the bones of the arch\r\nfirmly together and prevent further yielding. There is, at the present\r\nday, a tendency to recommend too freely the wearing of flatfoot braces\r\nor arches. After all, these are {421} only crutches and should not be\r\nworn unless absolutely necessary. If the arch can be strengthened--as\r\nit can be in many cases--so as to bear the body weight without\r\ndiscomfort, then this is much the better treatment. If the arch is\r\nrestored the feet are in a more natural condition, while artificial\r\nsupport leaves the muscles without that exercise which will preserve\r\ntheir functions. Flatfoot braces may be necessary, but only if\r\nabsolutely necessary should they be advised, and palliative measures,\r\nsuch as exercise, manipulations, and rubbings, should be given a fair\r\ntrial after the unfavorable suggestions as to his foot condition have\r\nbeen removed from the patient's mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignificance of Foot Troubles.--We have devoted much space to foot\r\ntroubles--more, perhaps, than will seem justified to the minds of many\r\nphysicians. We have done so, however, because of the firm conviction\r\nthat the feet are the source of more discouragement and depression of\r\nmind than any other part of the body. Life very often takes on another\r\naspect when foot troubles are relieved. In the old, progressive\r\ndeformities of the feet consequent upon mechanical disturbance are\r\nprobably the source of more discomfort, and by their interference with\r\nexercise and outing, the cause of more ill-feeling and even\r\ndisturbance of health than any other single factor. Even life may be\r\nshortened by the confinement or limitation of movement consequent upon\r\nbad feet. Above all, the idea that any constitutional trouble, or\r\nhereditary disease, is at the bottom of their affliction must be\r\nremoved, and then these patients are encouraged to live their lives\r\nmore fully and with more happiness for themselves and others. Hence\r\nthis long chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nARTHRITIS DEFORMANS\r\n\r\n\r\nArthritis deformans has unfortunately been called by several names\r\nbesides the descriptive term which, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, is the most suitable for it. We do not know its cause. We\r\ndo not well understand even the predisposing factors in its causation.\r\nHence, the term arthritis deformans, which declares simply that it is\r\nan inflammatory condition of the joints producing deformities, exactly\r\nfits it. It has often been spoken of by such names as \"rheumatic\r\narthritis,\" or \"rheumatoid arthritis,\" and, above all, by the\r\nunfortunate term \"rheumatic gout.\" Many of the worst suggestions that\r\nattach to the word rheumatism are founded on these ill-chosen\r\ndesignations. Arthritis deformans was supposed to be connected with\r\nrheumatism or with gout, or perhaps to be due to a combination of the\r\ntwo. In a majority of the cases there is no history of either true\r\ngout or rheumatism to be obtained from the patient, and where a\r\nrheumatic or gouty history does occur, it is either quite indefinite\r\nor it is clear that arthritis deformans developed in a gouty or\r\nrheumatic subject, that is, following genuine gout or rheumatism, just\r\nas it might develop in any other individual without any causal\r\nconnection between it and the other affections.\r\n\r\nSupposed under the old theory to be a constitutional, probably a\r\nblood disease, patients who saw the ugly, crippling deformities\r\nproduced by it and {422} then heard the word rheumatism used in\r\nconnection with it were prone to think of this as the terminal stage\r\nof all the severe rheumatic conditions. As a matter of fact no\r\nevidence that we have shows that the disease has any connection with\r\nchemical modifications of nutrition or metabolism; nor, above all, has\r\nthe so-called uric acid diathesis or any other superacidity of the\r\nblood any etiological connection with it. It has always seemed to me\r\nto be clearly a nervous arthropathy, as the lesions are almost without\r\nexception more or less symmetrically distributed. The joints that\r\nsuffer are commonly the smaller ones in corresponding positions on\r\nopposite sides of the body, and they run a definite atrophic course\r\nsometimes with the preceding phase of hypertrophy that is so\r\ncharacteristic of the trophic lesions of an affection produced by a\r\ndisease or defect of the nervous system. This symmetrical distribution\r\nconstitutes the best possible evidence that arthritis deformans is not\r\na nutritional disease and, above all, is not due to chemical changes\r\nin the blood.\r\n\r\nThe affection exists in at least three forms and there is a growing\r\npersuasion that there are even more varieties of it that will have to\r\nbe separated by clinical observation.\r\n\r\nThere is a good study of the three types of the disease in _Guy's\r\nHospital Reports_, Vols. 56-57, London, 1902. The article is entitled\r\n\"Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis,\" but there seems no reason for applying\r\nthe word rheumatoid to the group, especially since there is no proved\r\nconnection with rheumatism and no similarity, except in the case of\r\nacute deforming arthritis in which at the beginning it may be\r\ndifficult to differentiate the two affections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEBERDEN'S NODES\r\n\r\nThe most familiar form is named Heberden's nodes, from the great\r\nEnglish physician who first made a special study of it. The affection\r\nis characterized by an enlargement of the sides of the distal\r\nphalanges with small, hard nodules, \"little hard knobs\", as Heberden\r\ncalled them, developing at these points. They are more frequent in\r\nwomen than in men. Evidently neither hard work nor exposure nor\r\nexcesses in eating or drinking occasions them. They occur in all\r\nclasses, the poor and rich, manual workers as well as professionals.\r\nIt is rare to find them on one hand alone, though it is not at all\r\nrare to find them affecting solely the little fingers of each hand. I\r\nhave seen several cases where surgical intervention had been attempted\r\non one little finger because of the deformity produced when the node\r\noriginally appeared. When I asked if there was not some trace of a\r\nsimilar condition on the other hand I was told there was not, yet I\r\nhave been able to show that the first signs, at least, of a\r\ncorresponding growth already existed on the little finger of the other\r\nhand. In the two cases in which my attention was called to a slight\r\nenlargement on one side before anything developed on the other, my\r\ntentative prophecy that corresponding nodosities would grow on the\r\nother side was fulfilled during the following years.\r\n\r\nWhile this form of the disease is a true arthritis deformans it seems\r\nto be entirely separate from the progressive forms which we shall\r\nspeak of later. The nodes increase in size and occasionally develop on\r\nall of the fingers, but usually never spread beyond the phalangeal\r\njoints. There is a tradition in the {423} medical profession of\r\nEngland, where this affection has been observed with care for some two\r\nhundred years, that sufferers from these nodes commonly live to long\r\nlife. This is not founded on any theory, but is an actual observation.\r\nThere is also a tradition, though I cannot vouch for its truth, that\r\nthe people who are thus affected have some sort of immunity to\r\ntuberculosis, or at least good resistive vitality against a rapidly\r\nrunning tuberculous process.\r\n\r\nI have had at least a score of Heberden's nodes cases under\r\nobservation for more than ten years and some of them for nearly twenty\r\nyears, and have been surprised at the slowness with which the process\r\ndevelops. A year often makes no change in the size of the nodes, and I\r\nhave seen cases where after five years the photograph showed no\r\ndifference. The lesions are often exquisitely symmetrical so that the\r\nquestion of the origin of the affection in the spinal cord constantly\r\ncrops up, for that is the symmetrical influence in the body. There\r\nare, however, no other symptoms that point to involvement of the cord\r\nin any way. Most of these patients have suffered more from worry about\r\nit than from their affection. It is another case of \"having many\r\ntroubles most of which never happen.\"\r\n\r\nSome of my patients are physicians, and all of them have consulted\r\nother, some many other, physicians. As a consequence, many of them\r\nhave taken to various diets, especially eliminating certain foods and\r\nliquids with the idea that this might stop the progress of the\r\ndisease. I have never known any change of diet or any abstinence from\r\nliquids or solids that seemed to make the slightest difference, though\r\nI have seen a number of cases that were considerably worse than they\r\nwould have been if the diet had not been tinkered with to such an\r\nextent as seriously to disturb nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe main disturbing feature of the affection is the dread of the\r\ndevelopment of serious crippling conditions in the hands or in the\r\nlarge joints.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, after a time the nodes cease to grow, and then a period of\r\nremission sets in that lasts for many years and there may be no\r\nrecrudescence of the affection. This remission is delayed if the\r\npatients allow themselves to run down in general health. It is\r\napparently hastened by getting the patients up to normal weight and\r\nremoving any factors that disturb their general health. If the\r\npatients' minds are properly disposed, the neurotic symptoms that\r\nsometimes develop as the result of over-solicitude about their\r\ncondition are done away with, the patients are more comfortable, and\r\neven the progress of the disease is inhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE PROGRESSIVE ARTHRITIS\r\n\r\nThe second variety of the affection is a general progressive arthritis\r\nwhich usually begins with fever, redness, and swelling, involving\r\nespecially the smaller joints. The diagnosis of the disease can almost\r\nbe made on the fact that its favorite locations are the jaw and the\r\njoints of the spine. It is a much more serious affection than\r\nHeberden's nodes. In its beginning it often simulates acute\r\nrheumatism. It occurs particularly in people who are run down for any\r\nreason, in young women who have recently come to the country and are\r\nworking as domestics, in young men who have recently changed their\r\noccupation from indoors to outdoors and are not used to the\r\ninclemencies of the weather. On the other hand, it occurs rather often\r\nin young persons of {424} both sexes used to living and working out of\r\ndoors who take up an occupation in a damp interior.\r\n\r\nThe fever usually runs a lower course than that of genuine acute\r\narticular rheumatism, the pain is not favorably affected by\r\nsalicylates, and the duration of the disease is generally longer. This\r\naffection always leaves its marks on the joints and there are always\r\nrecurrences. It is, indeed, the confusion of this quite distinct\r\ndisease with acute articular rheumatism that has given the latter\r\naffection the bad name it has in many minds as a producer of\r\ndeformities. Arthritis deformans or general progressive arthritis is\r\nalways a crippling disease; acute articular rheumatism has for its\r\nsurest diagnostic sign, when the complete history of the case is\r\nknown, the fact that it leaves no mark after it except, unfortunately,\r\nthat so often seen in the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS\r\n\r\nThe third type of arthritis deformans is the chronic slow running type\r\nwhich involves many joints before the process is complete. One form of\r\nthis, commonly seen in old men, called osteoarthritis, is often\r\nconfined to the hip joint, and often produces considerable deformity.\r\nAnother form is more common in women. It begins in middle life by\r\ndeformities in the terminal joints of the fingers and the\r\ncarpo-metacarpal joints of the thumbs. Bony outgrowth takes place\r\nuntil the joints become almost or quite useless. It spreads from the\r\njoints primarily affected to the elbows, the knees and occasionally\r\ninvolves other joints. The disease has no favorable course, but is\r\nprogressive, and there is great discomfort, marked disability, aches\r\nand pains particularly in rainy weather and, finally, the patient may\r\nbecome quite helpless.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Stage.--An early symptom associated with arthritis\r\ndeformans of chronic character is likely to be a distinct loss of\r\nmuscle power, which may be the first symptom in cases that have no\r\nacute beginning. The patient notices that he is unable to hold a\r\nsatchel as he did before, or that quite unaccountably it drops from\r\nhim. There may be a loss of control over muscles and especially small\r\nmuscles that attracts the patient's attention. He finds that he cannot\r\nhold a book as he used to, or that it is difficult to pick up small\r\nobjects. He finds it hard to turn a door handle or to pull a cork,\r\nalthough the pulling action may be perfect, but the ability to insert\r\nthe corkscrew is lacking. These symptoms are prone to be intermittent.\r\nThey are most noticeable when the patient is tired, or after a damp\r\nday, or a succession of damp days, when he is not feeling well. It\r\nwill usually be found that a joint, the affection of which is missed\r\nunless it is carefully looked for, that between the radius and ulna\r\nhas become affected, and as a consequence there is a difficulty in\r\nsupination. The lesions are different from those which occur in lead\r\npoisoning but at the beginning the symptom complexes may easily be\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nThis form of arthritis deformans, in its earlier and its later stages,\r\nis a source of unfavorable suggestion as regards other affections. Its\r\nfirst symptoms may be thought neurasthenic, and if it is so called,\r\nthose who hear the diagnosis and see the later developments will\r\nconclude that neurotic symptoms {425} can lead to serious sequelae. On\r\nthe other hand, the painful tiredness that is always worse in damp\r\nweather may be termed rheumatism and be a correspondingly unfavorable\r\nsuggestion. Patients who develop aches and pains as a consequence of\r\noccupations, or through the relaxation of joint tissues, are most\r\nuneasy because of the confusion of the later stages of this disease\r\nwith rheumatism. This must be recalled by the physician if he would be\r\nsuccessful in treating such pains and aches; for not a little of the\r\ndiscomfort is due to an exaggerated mental impression of their\r\nsignificance. This of itself often proves sufficient to keep the\r\npatients from the exercise that would relieve many of their secondary\r\nsymptoms, at least, and serve to make their discomfort more bearable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse of Chronic Arthritis.--The course of chronic arthritis\r\ndeformans is always interesting. It is never as serious as the\r\nprognosis at the beginning seems to indicate, and it always has\r\nintermissions which, in most cases, become favorable remissions with\r\nsuch improvement that the patients feel encouraged, though they never\r\nget entirely well. Six rather typical cases have been under my eyes\r\nfor from five to fifteen years. In all of them the course was slow and\r\nthe progress of the disease vague at the beginning; and it was\r\ndifficult to say how the affection began, or what was its cause, and\r\napparently nothing would stop its advance. After a time all of them\r\nbecame discouraged and began to go the rounds. Almost without\r\nexception the physicians told them that they were incurable, and\r\nnearly all of them received unfavorable prognoses either directly from\r\nthe physician or from hints sometimes dropped to friends, or from the\r\nattitude of the physician toward them. Much of this discouragement\r\nproved unjustified by the actual progress of the disease for many\r\nyears. While they got but scant encouragement from regular physicians,\r\nnearly all of them received hopeful suggestions from irregulars and\r\nwere, as a rule, for the time being, somewhat bettered by the\r\ntreatments suggested by these, no matter what they were.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these six cases, as was to be expected under the\r\ncircumstances, went through a period of intense discouragement, with\r\nloss of appetite, partly from confinement to the house, partly from\r\nthinking so much about themselves, partly from lack of exercise and,\r\nin general, from their morbid mental condition. As a consequence of\r\nthe loss of appetite, or, at least, of failure to eat in the midst of\r\ndiscouragement, severe constipation developed in five of the six cases\r\nand this further complicated the situation. They ran down very much in\r\nweight, and this emphasized the apparent size of the hypertrophic\r\nnodosities in their joints and weakened their muscles to such an\r\nextent that even under good conditions they found it difficult to\r\nmove. After a time, usually many months, sometimes a couple of years,\r\nsomething happened to make them realize that while they were crippled\r\nand were going to be deformed, they still might find much in life that\r\nwas not to be despised. Then they began to pick up in weight, their\r\nmuscles got firmer, their nodosities seemed to disappear because the\r\nsoft tissues around them filled out, though in most cases some of the\r\nmaterial previously laid down actually was or seemed to be reabsorbed,\r\nperhaps as a consequence of the patient's better metabolism.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Additions.--All of these patients are now in much better\r\nphysical and, above all, in much better dispositional states than they\r\nwere during the first year or two at the beginning of their disease.\r\nWhile they allowed {426} themselves to run down in weight they were\r\nsupremely miserable, with many neurotic pains and aches that were\r\nextremely hard to relieve, they had tendernesses and sorenesses on\r\nrainy days, usually attributed to their rheumatic conditions but\r\nreally due to intense depression of the nervous system, with a\r\nconstant tendency to exaggerate slight pains and aches into torments,\r\nand in general were invalids, a burden to themselves and others. They\r\nhave improved to a noteworthy extent so as to become cheerful,\r\nreasonably happy in their power to help others, interested in many\r\nthings and, in at least two of the cases, accomplishing more actual\r\ngood for those around them than they probably would if their lives had\r\ncontinued to be the conventional existences that they had been before\r\ntheir arthritis came to them. This reminds one of Dean Stanley's\r\nfamous expression that life looks different when viewed from a\r\nhorizontal position. He used the expression with reference to fatal\r\nillness, but it might well be applied to any ailment that makes people\r\nthink seriously and keeps them from occupations only with frivolous\r\nthings. One of these patients is a source of consolation to many\r\nfriends, who are much better in health than she is, who bring their\r\ntroubles to her, and who marvel at her power to make the best of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis for cure is extremely unfavorable, but the prognosis for\r\na reasonable amount of happiness and a large amount of usefulness is,\r\nin my experience, excellent and though, of course, new habits will\r\nhave to be formed and new ways of looking at life assumed, if this can\r\nbe quietly and persuasively made clear to the patient early in the\r\ncase, much of the more or less inevitable suffering that the patient\r\nwill have to endure may be lessened.\r\n\r\nThe older the patient, as a rule, the better the prognosis in these\r\ncases. As with regard to diabetes, tuberculosis and many another\r\naffection, every year after fifty adds to the prospect that the\r\npatient's ordinary span of life will not be much shortened and that\r\nthe symptoms will not be severe. Occasionally the disease develops in\r\npatients who have been extremely healthy until they were well past\r\nsixty. I have in mind particularly a patient who did not begin\r\nseriously to suffer from the disease until she was sixty-eight. Then\r\nfor two or three years she was very miserable, mainly because she had\r\nbeen very active and she feared that the disease would cripple her. It\r\ndid bring about a considerable limitation of her activity. Ten years\r\nhave passed, however, and she is still able to be about, and, though\r\nnow well on the way to eighty, in good weather she still attends to\r\nvarious duties that take her outside of her home and occupies herself\r\nwith many interests.\r\n\r\nI was never able to tell her that she would be better. I assured her\r\nfrom the beginning, however, that she would never be so much worse as\r\nshe imagined, and that she would never be actually crippled. During\r\nthe early stages of the disease, her discouragement and, above all,\r\nthe diminution of activity, the lack of exercise and occupation of\r\nmind and the over-occupation with herself, made her not only mentally\r\nmiserable but seriously interfered with many bodily functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of arthritis deformans the most important object is\r\nthe general health of the patient. Owing to the confinement, the\r\npains, which {427} are often worse at night, cause disturbance of\r\nsleep which reacts upon the general health. As a result of depression\r\nand discouragement, patients are prone to loss of appetite. This is\r\nsometimes looked upon as a symptom of the disease, but it is not a\r\ndirect symptom except during the acute stage when there is fever, and\r\nis due rather to the changed conditions in which the patients live and\r\nthe mental influences that surround them. If the patient loses in\r\nweight, as is so often the case, the effects are likely to be more\r\nserious, for the remission is delayed and is less complete in its\r\nconsequences. Above all, it is important not to disturb the diet of\r\nthe patient in such a way as to interfere with nutrition. Owing to the\r\nsupposed rheumatic element, meat, or at least red meat, is\r\noccasionally taken out of the diet by the recommendation of the\r\nphysician. Whenever this is done, harm results. There is a definite\r\ntendency to anemia, which will be emphasized by an exclusively\r\nvegetable diet, especially in those accustomed to eat meat freely. As\r\na rule, there is much more need to encourage the patient to eat than\r\nto limit the diet in any way. Patients must rather be advised to take\r\na generous mixed diet and to consume about as much meat and the same\r\nvarieties as before. Tinkering with the diet has never been known to\r\ndo any good for arthritis deformans and often does harm. The drinking\r\nof large quantities of water seems to do more than almost anything\r\nelse to help these patients into a better frame of body and mind.\r\nTheir neurotic symptoms are, as a rule, even more important than their\r\njoint symptoms, and if the neurotic symptoms can be cured, as they\r\nusually can without much difficulty, the patients feel much better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystematic Exercises.--As soon as the acute stage has passed patients\r\nshould be encouraged to take some systematic exercise in spite of the\r\ndiscomfort that is associated with it. Unless muscles are moved\r\nregularly deformities in bad position will result and there will be\r\ncrippling which can be avoided in most cases. It is sometimes\r\ndifficult to secure exercises for the small muscles that are involved\r\nand definite occupations are better than artificial exercises. For the\r\nfingers, for instance, I find that the best thing is knitting. By this\r\nI mean using the old-fashioned knitting needles for the making of\r\nstockings, wristlets, jackets, and the like. Crocheting is also of\r\nsome use, but it does not give employment to as many of the small\r\nmuscles as knitting. If the knitting is done with old-fashioned yarn\r\nfrom which the lanolin has not all been extracted, some of this\r\nsubstance comes off on the fingers during the movements associated\r\nwith knitting. This seems to do good by rendering the joints more\r\nsupple and the muscles more easy of movement. At least the suggestion\r\nis very helpful to the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectricity and Mechano-therapy.--Electricity has been much praised,\r\nbut whatever good it accomplished has always seemed to me to be\r\nconfined to the exercise afforded the muscles. Its use, however,\r\nserves to keep up the patient's hope.\r\n\r\nMechano-therapy often does good and some of the Zander machines are\r\nlikely to be useful. Pulleys and weights for the shoulders and arms\r\nhave their place and resisted movements serve to restore muscles to\r\nfunction which they had lost during the time when the joints were\r\nworst. Their use helps to bring the joint into the most available\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSomething that has distinct hope in it must always be done for these\r\npatients. For this local treatment means more than anything else.\r\nUnfavorable {428} suggestions keep flowing in upon him from the\r\nfailure of medicine, and serve to concentrate his attention on his\r\ncondition and make him think that nothing can benefit him. Often the\r\nphysician finds that his patient has been to someone else, who did\r\nsome simple thing that brought relief of symptoms, at least for a\r\ntime, and restored his confidence to such a degree that he felt much\r\nbetter for a time at least. These ailments are emphasized by advancing\r\nyears and, though we cannot prevent decay of tissue, we can keep the\r\npatient's mind from inhibiting still further the functions of the\r\nimpaired tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Condition.--The patient's general condition must be made as\r\ngood as possible. For this outdoor air is the most important factor.\r\nIt increases impaired appetite, makes sleep more restful and easy, and\r\ngives one of the best occupations of mind that can be obtained. Of\r\ncourse, changes in the weather will bring discomfort. Where it is\r\npossible, such patients must be sent to climates as equable as\r\npossible. Such a change of climate during December, January and\r\nFebruary will often make them very comfortable, and the distraction of\r\nmind, with the possibility of getting out in the mild climate, will\r\ndiminish their sensitiveness and be more powerful factors in the\r\ndissipation of their aches and pains than the climate itself. Where\r\npeople cannot be sent away from home, the securing of corresponding\r\ndistractions means a great deal. The one thing necessary for the\r\nphysician is to keep the patient from brooding upon himself and his\r\nills and to find other occupations of mind for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOCCYGODYNIA\r\n\r\nCoccygodynia, or, as it is sometimes called, coccydynia, is a painful\r\naffection of the coccyx or bony end of the spinal column. It usually\r\nresults from trauma, as a fall on the buttocks on an icy pavement, or\r\nparticularly a fall in coming down stairs in which the main portion of\r\nthe impact is on the seat. Occasionally it follows horseback riding.\r\nIt is said to be on the increase among women who ride astride.\r\nOccasionally it is reported after severe labor, particularly when the\r\nhead of the child was very large, or after first labor when the coccyx\r\nhas been beforehand bent inward somewhat abnormally and is pushed out\r\nby the oncoming head. It seems to develop with special frequency in\r\nnervous people who have to sit much, particularly if they sit on\r\nunsuitable chairs. The chair seat with the ridge in the center which\r\nhas been introduced in recent years is sometimes blamed. Occasionally,\r\non the other hand, it is said to come from sitting on heavily\r\ncushioned chairs, particularly leather chairs which do not allow of\r\nmuch transpiration and cause a feeling of uncomfortable heat.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, so many different causes suggested, sometimes of\r\nquite opposite or even contradictory effects, that it seems evident\r\nthat the main element in the disease is some predisposition to\r\nsensitiveness in this region which is exaggerated and emphasized by\r\nthe cause that is blamed. It occurs particularly in women, though it\r\nis occasionally seen in delicate or neurotic men. Sufferers from it\r\nsometimes find it impossible to sit for any length of time. {429} Even\r\nlying down, especially if they lie on their backs, becomes a source of\r\npain. Various operations, such as the reposition in place of the bent\r\ncoccyx, or even the removal of the tip of the coccyx, have been\r\nsuggested. Some reported cures are to be found in the literature.\r\nThese are mainly surgical cures, however, that is to say, the patient\r\nrecovered from the operation, was seen for a month or two afterwards,\r\nand was then on a fair way to complete recovery. Some of us who have\r\nhad to treat these cases afterwards for painful conditions apparently\r\ndue to the scar of the operation, or to a neurotic condition closely\r\ncorresponding to the old coccygodynia, are not so confident of the\r\nvalue of an operation, though probably in purely traumatic cases\r\nsurgical intervention is of value.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the sufferers are women who have little to do, who have\r\nmuch time on their hands to think about themselves, and who usually\r\nreceive abundant sympathy from friends and relatives. In one case\r\nunder my observation the death of a husband and the discovery that his\r\nestate was much less than had been anticipated, so that his widow had\r\nto take up a wage-earning occupation, did more in a short time than\r\nall the treatment that had been employed before to relieve her\r\ndiscomfort. She had been quite unable to move around at times,\r\nespecially in rainy weather, and was something of an invalid during\r\nall the winter, but now she was able to go out to work every day and\r\nhad very little trouble. Her affection originally dated from a fall on\r\nan icy sidewalk and her fear to go out in the winter seemed to be\r\ndependent on the dread of another fall. She realizes now that\r\npractically all her former trouble was due to over-attention to a\r\ndiscomfort which is still present, but which she is now able to\r\nforget, except at times when she is alone after there have been\r\nworries and troubles that have reduced her power to control her\r\nnerves. In young girls an injury to the coccyx by a fall on the\r\nbuttocks will often leave tenderness for months or even years, but if\r\nattention is distracted from this and the patient is not allowed to\r\nconcentrate her mind on it and does not hear of the awful\r\npossibilities of coccygodynia--a mouth-filling Greek name in which we\r\nmap out our ignorance, and which seems to carry with it such a weight\r\nof pathology--she will probably recover completely.\r\n\r\nCoccygodynia often resembles hysterical coxalgia or the hysterical\r\narthritises, and seems sometimes to be due to the fact that there is a\r\nnatural or traumatic abnormal mobility of the coccygeal vertebrae\r\nwhich, owing to concentration of attention, has developed into a\r\nneurosis analogous to the corresponding condition in a joint. There\r\nare undoubtedly cases in which a real pathological lesion exists, but\r\nthese are comparatively few. In this, as in other joint and bone\r\naffections with vague pains likely to be worse on rainy days, the word\r\nrheumatism is often mentioned, but it has no proper place. Treatment\r\nthat will put the patients into good general condition--never local\r\nunless there is objective indication--outdoor air and exercise with\r\nreassurance of mind and distraction of the attention are the important\r\ntherapeutic agents. Patients with much time on their hands do not\r\nreadily get well, while those who are busily occupied seldom suffer\r\nfor long.\r\n\r\n\r\n{430}\r\n\r\nSECTION X\r\n\r\n_GYNECOLOGICAL PSYCHOTHERAPY_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMENTAL HEALING IN GYNECOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nAll physicians are convinced of the good that has been done by the\r\nextension of the application of surgery to women's diseases during the\r\npest generation. On the other hand, there are probably very few,\r\nexcept the ultra-specialists, who are not quite sure that there has\r\nbeen too much surgery in gynecology, and that many a woman has been\r\noperated on without sufficient reason and without definite\r\nindications. In suitable cases surgery is sometimes life-saving and is\r\noften the only means of relief for suffering that is seriously\r\ndisturbing the general conditions and is making life unbearable. Its\r\nvery possibilities of good, however, have led to abuses. From the\r\nabuse of a thing, the old Latins used to say, no argument against its\r\nproper use can be derived, and this is eminently true of gynecological\r\nsurgery. It will not belittle the great benefit that operative work\r\nhas been to state how much of auxiliary good may be accomplished by\r\nthe use of psychotherapy in gynecology.\r\n\r\nMany a woman who is operated on is benefited only for the time being,\r\nand her old symptoms return after a time. Dr. Goodell, one of our\r\nfirst great gynecologists, used to warn his students insistently that\r\nwomen had many organs outside of the pelvis. The individuality in\r\ngynecology is extremely important. Some women suffer what they\r\ndescribe as excruciating pain or unbearable torture from pathological\r\nconditions that other women do not notice at all. Very often these\r\nwomen either have no real interest in life and are so self-centered\r\nthat they emphasize their feelings by dwelling on them, or else their\r\nattention has been attracted to some sensation not necessarily\r\npathologic and then by concentration of mind on it they so disturb\r\nvasomotor conditions and the nutrition of nerves that the condition\r\ndoes become a veritable torture and apparently demands surgical\r\nintervention. It is possible to cause a hyperemia in the skin by\r\nthinking about certain portions of it, and the genital organs are\r\nparticularly prone to be influenced by mental states. If for any\r\nreason a woman gets her mind on her genital tract and becomes\r\npersuaded that there is a pathological condition in it, symptoms will\r\ndevelop until an operation seems inevitable. But the operation will\r\nbring relief only for a while, and then her mind will find something\r\nelse to dwell on and produce similar symptoms.\r\n\r\n{431}\r\n\r\nPlace of Psychotherapy.--To fail to try to sway the mind by all the\r\nmethods and auxiliaries outlined in the earlier chapters of this work\r\nbefore suggesting an operation to a woman is to neglect a most\r\nimportant means for relief in many gynecological cases. There is\r\nscarcely any pathological condition from which women may suffer that\r\ndoes not become worse as the result of the depressing influence of\r\nmuch thinking about it, and that is not made better by a change in\r\ntheir mind that makes them realize the possibility of being well\r\nagain. The most important preliminary to operation is the promise of\r\ncomplete relief through surgery. The acme of suggestion is reached in\r\nthe preparation for operation with its constant encouragement and then\r\nthe congratulations after the operation. Then come the weeks of\r\nconvalescence during which the same strong suggestion is constantly at\r\nwork making the patient sure that she must be better. All this serves\r\nto add tone to the system, invigorates the appetite and puts patients\r\nin the best possible mental attitude to bring about a favorable\r\nresult. Indeed, the ten or fifteen pounds in weight that such patients\r\ngain during their convalescence, especially when they have been under\r\nweight before, is often the most beneficial result of their hospital\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIf the same patients had been given the same promise that they would\r\nsurely be cured, and then had been removed from depressing home\r\ninfluences and bothersome trials and labors, and been told that what\r\nthey needed for complete recovery was to gain in weight; if they had\r\nthen been visited by friends who congratulated them on the fact that\r\nnow at least they were going to be better and their symptoms were\r\ngoing to disappear, and if they had gained the fifteen pounds that\r\ncame in convalescence after their operation, most of them would have\r\nrecovered quite as completely as by the operation from many of their\r\nvague gynecological difficulties. This is, of course, true only of\r\ncases where there are not very definite indications for surgical\r\nintervention. But in a certain number the symptoms are so vague that\r\noperation is decided upon rather with the hope than the assurance of\r\nbenefit; and it is particularly in these that psychotherapy is useful\r\nand must be given a thorough trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pain Relief_ .--It is often set down as a maxim of gynecologic\r\npractice, that pain which cannot be relieved except by recourse to\r\ndangerous or habit-forming drugs is an indication for operation. Pain,\r\nhowever, is a relative matter and, as we have shown in the chapter on\r\nPain, its intensity depends not a little on the patient's attitude of\r\nmind towards it. When there is discouragement and depression, pain\r\nbecomes insufferable, and what was borne quite well at the beginning\r\nmay now prove intolerable. Whenever occupation of mind can be secured,\r\nhowever, pain is diminished in intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReputed Remedies and Suggestion.--Probably the most striking indirect\r\ntestimony to the value of mental influence and especially of\r\nfrequently repeated suggestion in gynecology is found in the recent\r\nhistory of various much-advertised remedies that have been sold in\r\nenormous quantities for all the ills of women. The composition of\r\nthese remedies is not, as is popularly supposed, a great mystery. They\r\nhave all been analyzed and their ingredients are well known. As a\r\nrule, they contain only simple tonic drugs that have absolutely no\r\nspecific effect on the genital organs, but that are stimulating to the\r\ngeneral system. There has been much surprise at the definite evidence\r\n{432} furnished by expert investigators, that the principal ingredient\r\nin most of them--certainly their most active element--is the alcohol\r\nthey contain, which, until the passage of the pure food and drug law,\r\nwas in such considerable quantities that practically each\r\ntablespoonful of these favorite remedies for women was equal to half\r\nan ounce of whisky. No wonder that this gave an immediate sense of\r\nwell-being which rose in most of those unused to alcohol to a feeling\r\nof exaltation. The patient was sure beyond contradiction that she\r\ncould feel the effects of the medicine! Of the after effects, the less\r\nsaid the better, but there is no doubt that many women acquired the\r\nalcohol habit through indulgence in these nostrums.\r\n\r\nIllusory as was this sense of well-being, it sufficed in many cases to\r\nrelieve women of discomfort that had become so serious, to their minds\r\nat least, that they feared an operation would be necessary.\r\nUndoubtedly many of the testimonials given to such remedies are\r\nfounded on actual experiences of this kind in which patients were sure\r\nthat they were cured of serious ills. Where alcohol is not the chief\r\ningredient of these remedies, some other tonic stimulant is employed,\r\nand it has proved sufficient to make the patients feel, or at least\r\nsuggest to themselves, that they must be better. This has given them\r\ncourage to take more exercise and get more out into the air, and\r\nconsequently relieves them of many physical symptoms that had\r\ndeveloped because they thought they were the subjects of some serious\r\nailment and must be solicitously careful of their health. The idea of\r\ncare for the health in many persons' minds seems to be to do as little\r\nas possible of external, useful work and to occupy themselves\r\nprincipally with their internal concerns. They stay in the house too\r\nmuch and in so doing disturb nearly every physical function. Perfectly\r\nwell people, if confined with nothing to interest them, become\r\nshort-circuited on themselves and develop all sorts of symptoms,\r\nphysical and mental.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind as a Factor in Gynecological Affections.--A gynecologic\r\nincident of any kind may become to many women such a center of\r\nattention that it is impossible for them to distract their minds from\r\nit, and every symptom or feeling that can by any stretch of thought be\r\nconnected with the genital system becomes greatly exaggerated. Young\r\nwomen, whose menstruation has been perfectly regular, may have it\r\ndisturbed by fright, grief, a change of environment, getting the feet\r\nwet, or something of that kind. At immediately succeeding periods\r\ntheir fear of bad effects will of itself influence unfavorably the\r\nconditions in their genital system. They have always had more or less\r\ndiscomfort, but now this discomfort becomes difficult to bear because\r\nof the fear that there may be further serious consequences of the\r\ndisturbing incident in their menstrual life. It occupies all their\r\nattention; instead of deliberately trying to disregard it, they fear\r\nthat, if they should do so, they would be allowing some progressive\r\ncondition to gain a hold on them which would lead to serious results.\r\n\r\nOne is apt to see this condition in young married women who have had a\r\nmiscarriage in their first pregnancy and who fear that there will be\r\nserious results from it. If they have been much disturbed by the\r\nmiscarriage, they may lose in weight, and then a number of subjective\r\nsymptoms in their genital life will appear. Though their menstruation\r\nappears regularly, lasts the usual time, and is neither more scanty\r\nnor more profuse than before, and {433} though their physical\r\nconditions are normal as ever, they suffer from bearing down pains and\r\nfeelings and backache just before menstruation begins; their ovarian\r\nregions become sensitive and, if they are constipated, their right\r\novarian region is likely to become tender, and they develop a set of\r\nsymptoms that seems to call for surgical interference. If, however,\r\nthey are put in conditions where they have some other occupation\r\nbesides themselves and their ills, it is surprising how the case will\r\nclear up. They gain in weight, their subjective symptoms disappear and\r\nespecially they lose the persuasion, so common among them, that any\r\nbetterment of their symptoms is due to their getting used to the\r\npathological condition present and not to any real improvement of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--In the treatment of gynecological conditions such as are\r\nnot necessarily indications for operation, the most important\r\nconsideration is to reassure the patient's mind and secure the\r\ndiscipline of self-control. If patients are under weight this\r\ncondition must be corrected. If they are in an unfortunate environment\r\nit must be modified, as far as possible. If they are without\r\noccupation this must be provided for them. Dominant ideas and morbid\r\nauto-suggestion must be overcome--not always an easy task, yet always\r\npossible if patience, tact, and skill are exercised. They must be made\r\nto realize that the women of the past, before the development of\r\nmodern gynecology, not only lived useful lives without any of the\r\nmodern gynecological operations, but that most of them were quite\r\nhappy in so doing. Even though many of them had physical symptoms, the\r\nlack of unfavorable suggestion as to the significance of these\r\nprevented mental exaggeration, and morbid dwelling on them was not\r\nallowed to produce such a deterioration of the physical condition as\r\nto emphasize the pathological conditions. This does not mean that\r\nwomen may not have to be operated on, and, when that is necessary, the\r\noperation should be determined on and performed with no more delay\r\nthan is proper to put the patients into suitable physical condition.\r\nBut many operations that are undertaken without definite indications\r\nmerely because the women complain, and it is hoped that an operation\r\nwill somehow prove of relief, would be replaced with much more final\r\nsatisfaction and relief by properly directed psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nThere are many minor pathological conditions such as slight cystic\r\nenlargements, hyperemias with tenderness, slight displacements of the\r\novary, slight dislocations of the uterus or twistings of it that can\r\noften be successfully treated the same way. After all, what is\r\nconsidered the normal condition of the feminine internal organs is\r\nonly an average reached from observation and many deviations from this\r\naverage cannot be considered abnormal. Many a woman living practically\r\nwithout symptoms, or certainly without such symptoms as to justify an\r\noperation, has pathological conditions of her internal organs worse\r\nthan those for which operations are sometimes suggested because\r\nover-sensitive women complain of their symptoms. The rule must be\r\nfirst to relieve the over-sensitiveness and then to determine whether\r\nan operation is necessary or not. Pain alone, unless it is of a\r\ndisabling character or reacts upon the physical health, is not a\r\nsufficient indication for operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n{434}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC STATES IN MENSTRUATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne does not need to be a physician to be familiar with the curious\r\npsychic states which develop or are accentuated during the menstrual\r\nperiod. Practically all the peculiarities of the individual are\r\nemphasized at this time and if there are any special neurotic\r\nconditions or psychic anomalies these become quite marked. All the\r\ndreads, for instance, are more noticeable at this time. Women who at\r\nall times feel uncomfortable on looking down from a height are likely\r\nat this time to be quite overcome by fear and be unable to approach\r\nany position from which they might look down for a distance. Women who\r\nare afraid of horses, yet conquer their dread sufficiently to ride\r\nbehind them, cannot do so, or only with great difficulty, during the\r\nmenstrual period, and the same is true of the dread of cats or other\r\nanimals. Misophobia, the dread of dirt, may be particularly emphasized\r\nat this time and servants are puzzled as to what has come over a woman\r\nwho was not so punctilious in the matter a short time before.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrritability.--Dr. Charcot, the famous French nerve specialist, used\r\nto say that for a day or two before menstruation and during the first\r\nday or two of their period many women were not quite responsible. This\r\nis not merely an exaggeration of French contempt for women, for\r\nMoebius, the distinguished German neurologist, insisted that there is a\r\ncertain physiological mental disturbance with distinct hampering of\r\nthe faculty of judgment (Schwachsinn) normally associated with\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nFew physiologists or gynecologists agree with these extreme views, but\r\nthere is no doubt that many of the troubles which business men\r\nexperience with women in their employ begin with hasty words spoken at\r\nthese periods when the real reason for the irritability is not known.\r\nThe consciousness of this on the part of some women saves them from\r\nmuch undesirable friction by making them more careful at these\r\nperiods. Many a domestic misunderstanding begins at these times and is\r\nunfortunately allowed to continue because the real reason for it--the\r\ninstability of disposition due to menstruation--is not recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of Inhibition.--There is no doubt that, except in women of the\r\nmost stable physical and psychic character, a notable lack of\r\ninhibition characterizes all their actions at this time. To think that\r\nthis is universal, however, would be a mistake. Healthy women deeply\r\noccupied with something they like often pass through menstruation\r\nabsolutely undisturbed, and this is particularly true of the mothers\r\nof families. In spite of its exaggeration, it is well to keep the\r\ngreat French specialist's expression in mind, for it helps to explain\r\nmany things that produce much suffering in the world. This is\r\nparticularly true now that women are working more and more out of\r\ntheir homes at occupations which often make strenuous calls on them\r\njust at periods of the month when they should have more rest than\r\nusual. The consequence often is the development of a highly neurotic\r\ncondition in which psychic {435} symptoms are likely to be prominent\r\nas well as a tendency to exaggerate the significance of their feelings\r\nwhich is disturbing to the patient and may even disturb the physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nExaggeration of Sensitiveness.--The most striking feature of this is\r\nthe tendency to exaggerate the meaning of physical symptoms which they\r\nhave often borne with for a good while without much inconvenience, but\r\nwhich now appeal to them as of serious significance. Any uncomfortable\r\nfeeling is likely to be dwelt on to such an extent as to be called an\r\nunbearable ache or even an excruciating pain, and the patient is prone\r\nto connect it with some serious pathological process in the region in\r\nwhich it is felt. If a woman has been reading about some special\r\nailment, or, above all, has been listening to the tale, usually\r\nneither plain nor unvarnished, of a friend's medical woes, she is\r\nalmost sure to think that there must be something seriously wrong with\r\nherself. Many a supposed chronic indigestion had its origin in nothing\r\nmore than the uncomfortable feelings in the stomach region during\r\nmenstruation, which call attention to that organ and then, by morbid\r\nintrospection, lead to the exaggeration of various sensations that\r\nhave always been present but have hitherto been disregarded.\r\n\r\nIt is a good rule to neglect symptoms that develop during the\r\nmenstrual period and not to treat them directly until it is plainly\r\nseen that they persist afterwards; for symptomatic treatment at this\r\ntime will cause an over-attention to the condition. And we should be\r\ncareful not to suggest to a woman at this time that her symptoms may\r\nbe due to some pathological condition in an important organ. Such a\r\nsuggestion will almost surely be accepted seriously and dwelt on so\r\nmuch as to become an auto-suggestion that may lead to the disturbance\r\nof the function of the organ in question because of the surveillance\r\nover it. The diagnosis must be put off until menstruation is over in\r\norder that the exaggeration of this period may be eliminated. If this\r\nwere more commonly done and if women were advised to counteract their\r\nfeelings at this time as far as possible by occupations of interest to\r\nthem, there would be much less need of medication. As between rest and\r\nstrenuous work during the menstrual period, work is probably always\r\nthe better. Rest with nothing to do emphasizes morbid introspection to\r\nsuch a degree as to make even ordinary feelings unbearable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Symptomatic Conditions_.--It is interesting to note how often\r\naffections that are always present give symptoms only during the\r\nmenstrual period or just before it. Many women, however, suffer\r\nconsiderably about the time of the menstrual period from an extremely\r\ntired, painful condition of the leg below the knee which is really due\r\nto flatfoot. At other times it gives them little annoyance. Old\r\ndislocations and sprains are particularly likely to give bother at\r\nthis time. All the occupation pains and aches are emphasized.\r\nTiredness becomes a torment. This extreme over-sensitiveness extends\r\nto physical ills of all kinds, even those that are trivial. For\r\ninstance, corns and bunions become almost unbearable, especially if\r\nthere is any change of the weather with moisture in the air about the\r\ntime of menstruation. Teeth become sensitive and often will ache when\r\nthere is little that the dentist can find the matter with them. Women\r\nare often suffering from teeth that are supposed to be quite\r\nintractable because of over-sensitiveness, while in reality it is only\r\nat these certain times that the over-sensitiveness is present.\r\n\r\n{436}\r\n\r\nOver-reactions.--Even habitual actions which are accomplished without\r\nmuch difficulty at other times are likely to be a source of annoyance\r\nabout this period. If a young woman has to call out figures or read\r\noff lists of names, she soon becomes hoarse, her voice becomes husky\r\nand it requires more effort to accomplish her work than at other\r\ntimes. Complaint of sore throat is common about this time, and if\r\nthere have been any recent changes in the weather this is almost sure\r\nto be a premonitory symptom of menstruation. Singers and elocutionists\r\nare likely to find their occupations particularly trying at this time\r\nand actresses are seldom without considerable physical discomfort that\r\nmakes playing difficult and unsatisfactory. This happens in all\r\noccupations requiring frequently repeated use of particular muscles.\r\nPiano-players and typewriters find that their fingers become sensitive\r\nat this time. This sensitiveness of the ends of the fingers may become\r\nso marked as to prevent these usual occupations, or at least may\r\nrequire their limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Basis of Psychic States.--The physical basis of these\r\ntroubles is probably more responsible for them than has been thought,\r\nthough the mental state renders the individual more susceptible to\r\nannoyances of any and every kind. Careful weighing seems to show that\r\nthere is a gain in weight amounting sometimes to three to five pounds\r\ntoward the end of the menstrual month. This is accompanied by a sense\r\nof fullness that is perhaps an actual plethora, as if nature were\r\nmanufacturing a superabundance of blood in anticipation of the loss.\r\nThis produces a systemic hyperemia. It is well known that hyperemic\r\nareas are more sensitive than tissues in ordinary condition and this\r\nseems to be the case in menstrual life. This renders the nervous\r\nsystem more active and irritable and the nerve endings more sensitive.\r\nWith the menstrual loss this physical condition is relieved and then\r\nthere is a return to normal with a loss of weight only partly due to\r\nthe actual blood loss and somewhat to increased excretion in\r\nperspiration, in transpiration through the lungs and through all the\r\nemunctories.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment--To know that these psychic disturbances are likely to occur\r\nat the time of menstruation is to be prepared for them so as to lessen\r\ntheir effect upon one's self and others. They are much relieved by\r\nthis frank recognition and the patient understands that with the\r\nbetterment of the psychic condition by such reassurance the physical\r\nsymptoms are lessened. Many a woman gives up her occupation at such\r\ntimes who would be much better if she bravely clung to it and resisted\r\nthe temptation to be moodily occupied with her condition. Above all,\r\nshe needs to be in the air. Oxidizing processes within the body are\r\nslower and while much exercise is not beneficial and may be often\r\nharmful, riding in the air, sitting in the air, above all, sleeping\r\nwhere there is an abundance of fresh air is all-important. Every form\r\nof exertion will be reflected in increased irritability. Shopping,\r\nballs and parties will disturb the woman's mental equilibrium and make\r\nit more difficult for her to stand whatever physical discomforts she\r\nmay have, and also make it hard for her to pursue her ordinary\r\noccupation if this is somewhat exacting. Even these, however, must not\r\nbe given up if the sacrifice involves the throwing of the patient back\r\non self and increases introspection. Diversion of mind and\r\ntemporizing with symptoms are the basis of therapy at the menstrual period.\r\n\r\n{437}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAMENORRHEA\r\n\r\n\r\nNo feature of menstrual difficulty shows so clearly the influence of\r\nthe mind over bodily function, and especially over those genital\r\nfunctions that are supposed to be involuntary and spontaneous, as\r\namenorrhea. Almost any kind of mental trouble may produce a cessation\r\nof the menstrual functions. Profound grief or a severe fright nearly\r\nalways does. Every physician of large experience has seen cases of\r\nwomen who have missed their period because they were disturbed by a\r\nfire, or a runaway, or an automobile or railroad accident within a\r\nshort time before their menstruation should normally occur. Even\r\nslighter shocks may have a similar effect, and a profound shock of any\r\nkind will seriously disturb menstruation. The most frequent effect is\r\nto inhibit it, but it may be anticipated or delayed, and where there\r\nis a tendency to too profuse a flow, it may produce menorrhagia.\r\n\r\nEvery physician knows that much less serious mental influences than a\r\nprofound shock or fright may somewhat disturb menstruation and, in\r\nyoung women at least, this disturbance is nearly always in the\r\ndirection of lessened flow and amenorrhea. Home-sickness, for\r\ninstance, will often have this effect. Many of the foreign-born\r\ndomestics who come to this country have serious disturbances of their\r\nmenstrual flow, usually a diminution, during the first three or four\r\nmonths after they arrive in America. This may, of course, be due in\r\npart to change of climate, change of food and change of habits of\r\nlife. These girls while in their European homes have often been\r\naccustomed to be much more out of doors and to have more exercise in\r\nthe open air than they have here.\r\n\r\nThat the mental state has much to do with menstruation may be\r\nappreciated from the fact that serious changes of her state of life\r\nmay be accompanied by amenorrheal symptoms even when the patient stays\r\nin the same climate and under conditions not different physically from\r\nthose under which she has lived. Country girls who come to the city\r\noften suffer from such symptoms. Young women who enter convents\r\nsometimes have these symptoms for some months, and this is so well\r\nrecognized as to be expected in a certain number of cases. Indeed,\r\nthere is danger that it should be attributed too much to the change of\r\nmental state, and that other factors, such as incipient tuberculosis,\r\nor disease of the ductless glands, or anemic states, which are\r\nresponsible for it, may fail to be appreciated because of the ready\r\nexplanation afforded by the mental factor. General experience shows\r\nthat the attitude of mind of a patient toward menstruation, the\r\nexpectancy of it at a particular time, and a good general physical\r\ncondition that predisposes to it, are quite as important for its\r\nregularity as the specific physiological conditions which naturally\r\nbring it about.\r\n\r\n\r\nFright and Amenorrhea.--Fright particularly may disturb menstruation\r\nin many ways. Occasionally the disturbance of menstruation consequent\r\nupon shock lasts for months or even years. At times when a woman\r\nbetween thirty-five and forty is seriously frightened, especially by\r\nterror that endures {438} intensely for some hours, the sort that is\r\nsaid to blanch the hair in a single night--and there are\r\nwell-authenticated instances--menstruation never recurs or if it does\r\nrecur it is vicariously from some other portion of the body than the\r\ngenital tract. Among my notes is a case of a woman frightened by a\r\nrevolver which a maniac had flourished for hours at her while she\r\ndared not make a move nor a sign. Her menstruation stopped completely\r\nfor a time and then came back irregularly and usually from the ear.\r\nThe bleeding was from the pierce in the lobule which had been made for\r\nearrings, and before it started a large swelling of this would come on\r\nin the course of an hour, often not subsiding for days. In another\r\ncase a woman who was frightened during menstruation by an insane\r\nperson flourishing a knife near her had for several years after an\r\nextremely irregular menstruation, and usually only the molimina in the\r\ngenital tract, while the bleeding was from the nose. Deep emotion can\r\nvery seriously affect menstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudocyesis.--The mind may bring about a cessation of menstruation in\r\nanother way without any other factor interfering and in spite of the\r\nfact that physiological conditions would all seem to be favorable to\r\nits regular occurrence. We have many cases in medical literature in\r\nwhich married women anxious to have children have concluded that they\r\nwere pregnant, and have had complete cessation of their menstruation\r\nfor months with all the symptoms of beginning pregnancy, so as to\r\ndeceive even careful physicians. The best known historical instance is\r\nthat of Queen Mary, the eldest daughter of Henry VIII of England, who,\r\nnearly forty when she married Philip II of Spain, was very anxious to\r\nhave children. Not long after her marriage menstruation stopped and\r\nall the ordinary symptoms of beginning pregnancy developed. Her\r\ncondition was widely heralded throughout the kingdom; then, after a\r\ntime, to the intense disappointment of the Queen and her friends, it\r\nproved that she was not pregnant but that her mental attitude had\r\nproduced the series of symptoms that proved so deceptive. These cases\r\nof pseudocyesis are so likely to occur that a physician in dealing\r\nwith a woman, who being rather well on in years when she marries is\r\nanxious to have children, must be on his guard and he must always take\r\ninto account the possibility of a pseudo-pregnancy and must be careful\r\nnot to be deceived by symptoms that would ordinarily indicate beyond\r\ndoubt the beginning of pregnancy. Even experts have been deceived in\r\nsuch cases, and it is in them that accurate rules for the certain\r\ndetection of pregnancy are most needed.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms have reference not only to the uterus, but also at\r\ntimes to other organs. They are not merely subjective, but sometimes\r\nbecome so objective as almost to demonstrate the diagnosis of\r\npregnancy, and yet a mental condition is the only source of the\r\nchanges. For instance, cases of false pregnancy have been reported in\r\nwhich, besides the gradual enlarging of the abdomen with many of the\r\nsigns of pregnancy accompanying that phenomenon, there has been an\r\nenlargement of the breasts and even the secretion of milk. In a few\r\ncases the enlargement of the abdomen has been accompanied by\r\npigmentation and the areola of the nipple has also become pigmented.\r\nThis is not surprising, since corresponding changes take place in\r\nconnection with fibroid tumors, and the deposit of pigment is not a\r\nsymptom of pregnancy, but only a result of the congestion which takes\r\nplace in these structures during their enlargement.\r\n\r\n{439}\r\n\r\nAmenorrhea from Dread.--In some cases all the symptoms of pregnancy\r\ndevelop, or at least there is complete cessation of menstruation, as a\r\nconsequence of nervousness and dread of the occurrence of pregnancy.\r\nUnmarried women who fear that they may have become pregnant by\r\nindiscretion, sometimes become so worried over their condition that,\r\nwithout any physiological reason, they miss one or more periods and\r\nthus add to their nervous state and further inhibit menstruation,\r\nthough usually two months is the limit of such amenorrhea and the\r\nmenstrual flow commonly makes its reappearance shortly before or after\r\nthe time of the third period. Occasionally, however, in the case of\r\nanxiously expectant married women further symptoms of pregnancy may\r\nappear and the case becomes more complicated. Every physician of\r\nconsiderable experience has seen such patients, and doubtless much of\r\nthe harvest which advertisers reap from drugs that are supposed to\r\nproduce abortion comes from nervous young women who are not really\r\npregnant, but have inhibited their menstruation by worry, and who take\r\nthese medicines with confidence and have the menstrual flow restored\r\nby trust in their efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuctless Gland Disease.--Of course, in many cases of amenorrhea there\r\nare serious underlying constitutional conditions which may or may not\r\nbe amenable to treatment, but the possibilities of which must always\r\nbe thought of. One case of amenorrhea I saw in recent years proved to\r\nbe due to a beginning acromegaly. There was no sign of enlargement of\r\nthe hands, though there had been a coarsening of the face which was\r\nattributed to growth and to the fact that the girl was taking much\r\nhorseback exercise in all weathers. She had a headache for which no\r\nremedy seemed to be of any avail, and when the amenorrhea developed it\r\nwas naturally thought that the headache must be due to gynecologic\r\nconditions. Nothing was found on investigation, however, and\r\neventually the gradual development of the symptoms of acromegaly\r\nshowed what was really the basic cause. Occasionally diseases of other\r\nductless glands, as the thyroid, may have amenorrhea as one of the\r\nfirst symptoms. It is seldom that any serious thyroid condition\r\ndevelops without disturbance of menstruation, but this is less\r\nfrequently in the direction of diminution than toward profusion and\r\nprolongation. In some cases, however, one or more periods is missed in\r\nthe early development of the disease. In this, however, others of the\r\ncharacteristic tripod of symptoms--rapid heart, tremor,\r\nexophthalmes--are sure to be present even though the enlargement of\r\nthe thyroid is not noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuberculosis.--But more important than these causes of amenorrhea is\r\nthe early development of tuberculosis. In some cases, even before\r\nthere is any cough that calls attention to the condition, or when the\r\ncough has been considered to be one of those myths now fortunately\r\npassing, \"a cold that hangs on,\" the cessation of menstruation may\r\ndepend entirely on the weakness and anemia due to the growth of\r\ntubercle bacilli in the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nInanition Amenorrhea.--Sometimes indigestion, or what is supposed to\r\nbe indigestion, may be at the root of the amenorrhea. In many cases it\r\nreally is not true indigestion that is present, but a disinclination\r\nfor food which has increased to such a degree as to bring about a\r\nlowered state of nutrition. In nervous young women and, above all, in\r\nnervous spinsters beyond forty, disturbances of menstruation\r\nconsequent upon lack of nutrition are not infrequent. Often their\r\nindigestion is considered to be a reflex from their genital {440}\r\norgans, when, on the contrary, whatever disturbance of their genital\r\norgans is present is due to the inanition which has developed because\r\nthey have not been eating enough. Many of these women literally starve\r\nthemselves, and they, must be persuaded to eat once more and taught\r\nwhat to eat, and their weight must be watched until it gets up to what\r\nis normal for their height.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy and Treatment.--The treatment of amenorrhea on\r\npsychotherapeutic principles will be readily understood from the fact\r\nthat there is a distinct psychic element in practically all the cases\r\ntouched on in this chapter. This psychic element is generally\r\nappreciated and admitted. If a woman is accustomed to connect certain\r\nphysical incidents with disturbances of menstruation, then those\r\ndisturbances are almost sure to recur. As a rule, many an incident\r\nsaid to be disturbing to the function would probably have no influence\r\nupon it but for the dread connected with it and the anticipation of\r\nsome interference. In all cases of amenorrhea, then, the patient's\r\nmind must be put into a favorable state and suggestions must be made\r\nthat will lead to the expectancy of menstruation at the next regular\r\nperiod. If the mind can cause menstruation to cease, as is clear from\r\nexperience, any inhibition from this source must be removed and its\r\npower set to bring relief to these patients. Drugs should not be\r\nneglected, and general physical conditions must be improved, but if\r\nthe patient's mind continues to be unfavorably affected towards her\r\nmenstruation, its satisfactory return will be delayed until somehow\r\nmind as well as body are co-ordinates for the resumption of the\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThe best testimony to the value of psychotherapy in amenorrhea is\r\nfound in the success of many of the remedies used for the condition,\r\nwhich, in the successive phases of medical development, have included\r\nall sorts of home treatments, many types of quack medicines, and\r\ninnumerable proprietary combinations. Many of these have acquired a\r\nreputation for efficacy not justified by any direct pharmaceutic\r\neffects which we now know them to possess. From the familiar gin and\r\nhot water, through the various combinations of aloes and the tonic\r\nremedies of a later time, only the most general and obvious effects\r\ncould have been produced by the medicines, yet apparently specific\r\nreactions have followed them in the menstrual cycle. But this was\r\nbecause the mind of the patient was prepared by the taking of the\r\nremedies and unfavorable suggestions as to menstruation were removed.\r\nAbove all, with amelioration of the general health, constipation being\r\nrelieved, the appetite restored and the whole tone of the system\r\nimproved, nature became capable of taking up once more the menstrual\r\nfunction. What was accomplished by indirect psychotherapy in the past\r\ncan now be done much better by direct mental suggestion, when at the\r\nsame time various remedial measures in other therapeutic departments\r\nare employed as auxiliaries. But the physician must be sure that the\r\nmind of the patient is properly disposed or remedies may fail and\r\nsymptoms continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDYSMENORRHEA\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically every woman of menstrual age has more or less discomfort\r\nduring menstruation. In most cases this does not rise beyond a heavy\r\ndepressed {441} feeling shortly before menstruation begins, followed\r\nby a sense of weight and discomfort in the back and then some\r\nsensations more or less acutely uncomfortable due to congestion in the\r\npelvis, which begin to be relieved with the commencement of the flow\r\nand then gradually disappear. Even in otherwise healthy women, various\r\nachy feelings of distention are often felt in the neighborhood of the\r\novaries, but these would scarcely be described as pain, unless the\r\npatient is over-sensitive. The effect upon the disposition is more\r\nmarked and more universal. Some women are inclined to be irritable and\r\nhard to get along with for a few days before their menstruation and\r\nsometimes during the whole of its course. The frank recognition of\r\nthis fact by them and a consultation of the calendar when they find\r\nthat everything seems to be going against them and that everybody is\r\nlacking in sympathy, usually leads to an appreciation of the fact that\r\nthe trouble is in themselves rather than in those around them, and\r\ntheir condition becomes more bearable. It is curious, however, to note\r\nhow often this is forgotten, with consequent give-and-take of\r\nirritation in their environment that makes the nervous and mental\r\ncondition worse and emphasizes the physical symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe term dysmenorrhea, from the Greek, means difficult menstruation\r\nand is usually associated with painful conditions in connection with\r\nthe menstrual flow. It may be applied, however, to various\r\nuncomfortable feelings, to superirritability, to fatigue, to lack of\r\nenergy, or even to more vague discomforts at this period. The\r\ndiscomforts are usually spoken of as pains, especially after the\r\npatient has been dwelling on them for some time and has been reading\r\npatent medicine advertisements that tell of how women suffer in\r\nsilence, but analysis often shows that they are sensations of\r\npressure, of compression, of achy distress at most, and sometimes only\r\nof unusual feelings--paresthesiae--that having got over the threshold\r\nof consciousness, through concentration of attention upon them, are\r\noccupying the center of the stage of mental activity to the exclusion\r\nof all serious interests.\r\n\r\nThe serious difficulties of menstruation are due to definite\r\npathological conditions such as displacements of the uterus,\r\naffections of the uterine mucosa and of the ovaries. There are,\r\nhowever, many cases where the trouble is merely functional, dependent\r\non conditions that can be easily corrected without serious surgical or\r\neven lengthy medical treatment, and where the patient's attitude of\r\nmind towards the trouble is the most important factor in the medical\r\naspect of the case. As a matter of fact, many of the discomforts and\r\neven serious pains complained of in connection with menstruation are\r\ndue rather to the patient's incapacity to bear even slight discomfort\r\nwith reasonable patience and without exaggerated reaction than to the\r\nactual pain inflicted by whatever disturbance of function and tissue\r\nmay be present. People differ very much in their power to stand\r\ndiscomfort and what seems quite trivial to one becomes unbearable\r\ntorture to another. With this in mind it is possible to relieve many\r\nwomen who suffer from dysmenorrhea from their discomforts so that they\r\nshall only have to bear what is every woman's heritage in the matter.\r\nSuccessful management of these cases will save them from the supposed\r\nnecessity of being operated on, which is likely to be constantly\r\nsuggested to them in an age when women so often talk of their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of pain suffered from any cause is dependent on two\r\nfactors, the pathological condition and the power of the individual to\r\nwithstand {442} discomfort. When we are irritated, when we are very\r\ntired, when we have fever, when we suffer from want of food or lack of\r\nsleep or any other condition that exhausts vitality, even slight pains\r\nbecome hard to bear. In relieving pain it is as important to remember\r\nthis lessened capacity to stand discomfort as it is to get at the\r\ncause of the discomfort itself. This habit of standing discomfort with\r\nreasonable patience is one of the best remedies for lessening\r\nsuffering, especially when it is known that the discomfort is only\r\ntemporary and the end of it is in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Condition.--In the treatment of suffering incident to the\r\nmenstrual period, then, the correction of all conditions that may\r\nincrease nervous irritability and make patients less capable of\r\nstanding pain should be the first care. Young women who are thin and\r\nanemic, especially if they are more than ten per cent. under weight,\r\nare likely to suffer much at their menstrual periods for two\r\nreasons--through their lack of power to withstand discomfort and owing\r\nto the fact that their ovaries and the uterus itself are especially\r\nsensitive, probably through lack of nutrition consequent upon their\r\ngeneral condition. In these cases local treatment is not as necessary\r\nas improvement of the patient's general condition and the raising of\r\nher general bodily tone.\r\n\r\nThe bowels must, of course, be regulated, partly for the sake of the\r\ngeneral condition and the fact that it is very hard to have a regular\r\nappetite unless there is a daily evacuation, and partly also because\r\nthe presence of an accumulation of fecal material in the lower bowel\r\nis likely to produce congestion in the pelvic region. This added to\r\nthe normal congestion due to the menstrual function may cause undue\r\npressure upon sensitive nerves in the ovaries and uterus. Indeed a\r\nregulation of the function of the bowels is immediately followed by a\r\nlessening of the menstrual discomfort as well as by a general\r\nimprovement. Many women find that the taking of a gentle purge a day\r\nor two before the menstrual period serves to make that period a source\r\nof less discomfort than it would otherwise be, and undoubtedly the\r\nsuggestive value of such a remedy persuades many women that their\r\ndiscomfort should be lessened.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goodell's reminder that women have many organs outside of\r\ntheir pelvis is important in dysmenorrhea. Almost any ailment that\r\ndrains a woman's strength and brings a series of irritations to bear\r\nupon her nervous system will be reflected in her genito-urinary system\r\nand will cause discomfort during the menstrual period. Over and over\r\nagain the physician finds that the true source of the menstrual\r\ndiscomfort is not in the essentially feminine organs, but in the\r\ndigestive organs or occasionally even in such distant organs as the\r\nlungs, and that proper attention to these brings relief during the\r\nmenstrual period. Just as soon as they realize that this is not a new\r\naffection but only a reflex from their other ailment, whatever it may\r\nbe, they stand it with much better spirit and their complaints\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has seen the difference between the reaction to menstrual\r\nmoliminia when patients are in good condition and when they are\r\notherwise run down will realize how much a matter of over-reaction to\r\nsymptoms dysmenorrhea may be. Teachers who begin the school year,\r\ninvigorated by their vacations, scarcely notice their periods, but at\r\nthe end of the course, when run down by months of hard teaching work\r\nand especially by the confinement of the winter, they find the strain\r\nextremely hard to bear. In many of these cases an examination by a\r\nspecialist seems to reveal something that might be {443} benefited by\r\noperation. There may be various uterine displacements, sensitive\r\novaries, perhaps slightly enlarged yet often not distinctly\r\npathological, but just as soon as the physical condition is made\r\nnormal, the symptoms given by these conditions completely disappear.\r\nWomen who have nothing particular to do, who talk much about\r\nthemselves and their ills, who have had friends operated on and heard\r\nmuch talk about the subject, are soon convinced that only an operation\r\nwill do them good. Once _that_ suggestion is implanted in their minds,\r\nthe hypnotic dread of the operation and the morbid attraction of being\r\na center of interest and commiseration will make them exaggerate their\r\nsymptoms to such a degree that operation becomes almost inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoral Fiber.--It is often said that modern women, as the result of\r\ncivilization, refinement, and city life, are of laxer physical fiber\r\nand therefore cannot stand the ills that their grandmothers bore with\r\nequanimity and considered as nothing more than what was to be expected\r\nin this imperfect existence. Most physicians must feel, however, that\r\nthe increased laxity is not so much of the physical as of the moral\r\nfiber. We have not weaker bodies than our forefathers, but weaker\r\nwills. This is especially so with those who have much time to think\r\nabout themselves, and, therefore, is more true, of women than of men,\r\nthough in our generation men also have become very introspective. I\r\nhave seen--and I am sure that my experience is a common one among\r\nphysicians--delicate women who seemed unable to stand any trial or\r\nhardship successfully, placed by unfortunate conditions--such as the\r\nsudden death of a husband, or his failure in business--in\r\ncircumstances that were extremely hard to stand up bravely against.\r\nNot only did they stand it, but they had better health, they had less\r\ncomplaint of pains of all kinds, particularly in this matter of\r\ndysmenorrhea, than they had before.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain and Occupation of Mind.--The more claims a woman has on her\r\nattention the less likely is she to be bothered at her monthly\r\nperiods. If she does not _have_ to get up in the morning because there\r\nare no insistent obligations upon her, she is likely to lie in bed and\r\nworry about herself and by concentrating her attention on her ills\r\nwill make them worse than they are. But if she has to be up and doing,\r\nif household cares cannot be put off, if she has to earn her living by\r\nworking every day, she not only succeeds in doing it, but often also\r\nforgets her ills to a great extent in her occupation. Of course, there\r\nare pathological conditions that cannot be put off in this way, and if\r\nthere are serious uterine changes, or if an infection has spread along\r\nthe tubes to the ovaries, there will be symptoms that cannot be\r\ndistracted away. Even where there are minor pathological conditions,\r\nhowever, occupation of mind will make pain less annoying and even make\r\nit quite negligible. We know our own experience with toothache. This\r\nis a real pain and with a real pathological condition of the most\r\nmaterial kind. The congestion of the sensitive dentine or the\r\nirritation of an exposed nerve filament causes about as severe pain as\r\nit is given to mortals to bear. Even with toothache, however, we can\r\nby occupying ourselves with friends, or with a pleasant book, or a\r\ngame of cards, or the theater, so diminish the annoyance consequent\r\nupon the pain as to be comparatively comfortable. If anything\r\ncompletely occupies our attention as, for instance, a fire or an\r\naccident, or bad news from a friend, then it may be hours afterwards\r\nbefore we realize that we were suffering from a toothache. Since this\r\nwill happen with a dental nerve, why should it not {444} happen to\r\nbranches of the genital nerve? There is no reason why one should be\r\nmore sensitive than the other, and whatever reason there is is rather\r\nin favor of the dental nerve giving more bother, since it is nearer\r\nthe center of the nervous system and these nerves are usually said to\r\nbe more sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Women.--With regard to painful menstruation, the habits of\r\nmany country people, and of the European peasantry generally, furnish\r\nvaluable indications of the power of work to dissipate discomfort.\r\nDuring my medical student days in Vienna I had the opportunity to know\r\nrather well a group of women who were engaged in working on a\r\nbuilding. They carried up the bricks and mortar for the men and worked\r\nthe windlasses by which heavy materials were carried to the different\r\nstories, and they mixed the mortar and prepared the building materials\r\ngenerally. These women, living constantly in the air and working very\r\nhard, had almost no symptoms of menstrual difficulty. They never laid\r\noff at this time except in a few cases in which subinvolution after\r\npregnancies and genital infections had left conditions that made it\r\nhard to understand how they worked at all.\r\n\r\nI learned in addition from them, for most of them came from the\r\ncountry, that the women who work so commonly in the fields in central\r\nEurope have little difficulty with menstruation and practically do not\r\nknow that it is coming on them until the show indicates its presence.\r\nI had known before how true this was for the Irish peasant women. This\r\nseems to be the normal healthy condition, and the state of mind of\r\nthese women aids this satisfactory state of affairs. They rather look\r\ndown upon women who complain at this time as being of such inferior\r\nhealth as to be despised. Doubtless if they were persuaded, as so many\r\nseem to be, that a woman must expect to have a serious time, or at\r\nleast a great deal of discomfort about this period, they would have\r\nit, too. Of course, they have some difference of feeling at this time.\r\nThey feel more tired in the evenings, and they awake in the morning\r\nless rested, but that is no more than the changes in the weather bring\r\nto men.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Brittany and Normandy many of the women rake for\r\nshellfish. Their custom is to wade into the water and, standing with\r\nthe water often above the knee and waves sometimes washing as high as\r\nthe waist, to rake all day for the shellfish that they are seeking.\r\nThey do not lay off from this occupation, as a rule, when their\r\nmenstruation is on them, but continue as if nothing were the matter,\r\nand there are very few complaints of menstrual troubles among them.\r\nSuch occupation would seem to be positively counter-indicated, but\r\nlong years of experience have shown them that there is no need of\r\ninterruptions in their work and as they need every centime that they\r\ncan obtain in this way for the support of their families, they\r\ncontinue even in very cold weather, when it would seem inevitable that\r\nthis must produce serious results.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for a young woman, who, while her family was in\r\ngood circumstances, was a severe trial to everyone for a week more or\r\nless, every month, to become quite free from trouble for herself and\r\nothers when, owing to a change in the family circumstances, she has\r\nhad to take up some occupation for a living. I have notes of cases of\r\nthis kind in which the pain was so severe that, after several years of\r\nmedication and external applications, it was decided to dilate the\r\ncervix uteri in the hope of affording relief. The relief thus\r\nafforded, however, was only temporary. A little later in life, {445}\r\nhowever, the necessity of earning a living has in some cases quite\r\nfreed these young women from the torments that sent them so frequently\r\nto their physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need the report of many more of such gynecological conditions which\r\nget better as a consequence of occupation of mind without any other\r\ntreatment. We have any number of reports of benefits derived from\r\noperation, but not infrequently these reports refer only to a few\r\nmonths after the operation, when the strong mental suggestion of the\r\nperformance of the operation and the general betterment of health\r\nconsequent upon care during convalescence are still acting upon the\r\npatient, and she has the benefit of the gain in weight and strength\r\nthat usually follows because of hope, appetite, exercise in the air,\r\netc. Not infrequently in these cases there are, later on, sad relapses\r\ninto painful conditions quite as severe as before, while, on the other\r\nhand, some change in the circumstances of the individual, or some\r\nintense preoccupation of mind a few years after, brings lasting cure,\r\nthus showing that it was the mental state which was at the root of the\r\ncondition rather than any bodily affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpasmodic Dysmenorrhea.--There are two forms of dysmenorrhea that have\r\nbeen the subject of much study. One of them consists of cramp-like\r\npains which occur some time before menstruation, are relieved if the\r\nflow is copious, but continue if it is scanty. This affection has\r\noften been attributed to mechanical obstruction. Nearly twenty years\r\nago Dr. Champneys in his Harveian Lectures on Painful Menstruation\r\ndiscussed this subject, and showed that the mechanical explanation\r\nwhile very simple and popular was probably not correct. His conclusion\r\nwas that the dysmenorrhea was more frequently due to conditions\r\noutside of the uterus than in that organ. He recommended plenty of\r\nhealthy exercise between the periods and especially riding if the\r\npatient were not a working woman, regular activity of the bowels with\r\nepsom salts as probably the most valuable single remedy, and then a\r\nnumber of drugs such as guiacum and sulphur that are not specifics but\r\nhave a general effect. In his experience castoreum, a strongly\r\nsuggestive remedy, gave more relief than anything else. He advised\r\nagainst local treatment unless there was a very definite reason for it\r\nand frankly expressed the opinion that the complaints were often due\r\nmore to an incapacity to stand the slight discomfort that is more or\r\nless inevitably associated with the congestive state that precedes\r\nmenstruation than to any pathological lesion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMembranous Dysmenorrhea.--This affection like membranous colitis\r\nremains one of the mysteries of pathology and etiology. There is no\r\ndoubt, however, that there are large nervous elements in its\r\nproduction and that it is worse at times of worry, while mental\r\nfactors of many kinds influence its occurrence and also its relief. In\r\nhis Harveian Lectures Dr. Champneys discussed the questions connected\r\nwith it very well and his monograph is a classic on the subject. Many\r\ndrugs have seemed successful and then have failed. Castoreum has done\r\ngood in this as in spasmodic dysmenorrhea. A number of gynecological\r\nmethods of treatment have been successful when first applied, when\r\nphysician and patient were both confident of their value, and then\r\nlater has failed. Probably nothing does more good than getting the\r\npatient's mind off her condition, securing such occupation as will not\r\npermit of introspection to any extent, though of course treating\r\nsurgically whatever requires operation. It must not be forgotten that\r\nwhile many of those suffering from the disease {446} complain of pain,\r\nnot a few sufferers from it have no symptoms of this kind and their\r\ncondition is discovered more or less by accident. After this there is\r\nlikely to be much more discomfort from it. All this must be borne in\r\nmind in its treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor Ovarian Lesions.--In many cases there is vague discomfort in the\r\novarian region about the time of menstruation, and the ovary is found\r\nto be somewhat enlarged or perhaps dislocated. In these cases if there\r\nis continued complaint of pain, operation will almost surely be\r\nadvised and frequently cysts are found. This is considered to be\r\njustification enough for the removal of the ovaries or at least for\r\ntheir resection. It is doubtful, however, whether ovarian cysts in the\r\nmajority of cases are really a pathological condition. Those who are\r\nengaged in spaying cattle think it almost if not quite normal for\r\ncysts to exist in the ovaries. Whether this is not also true of women\r\nwe have not the data to determine. In a number of the patients who are\r\noperated upon for this condition there is a relapse of symptoms, and\r\nthere seems to be no doubt but that whatever good is accomplished\r\ncomes from the expectation of relief followed by the weeks of rest and\r\nquiet in bed and very often the gain in weight which succeeds the\r\noperation. Whether something of this kind would not follow from the\r\nsimpler procedure of improving the general health is an open question.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes insisted that the general health will not improve in\r\ngynecological cases unless the offending pathological condition is\r\nremoved. This is true if the patient is persuaded that there is some\r\npathological condition present which must be corrected or else she\r\nwill not be better, and if favorable suggestion cannot be used to\r\nadvantage. If, however, these patients understand from the beginning\r\nthat probably the local condition, which gives the symptoms, is due\r\nrather to their general health than to a definite lesion, there is\r\nmore probability of improvement. It is surprising how many of these\r\ncases are relieved by an improvement of the general health, by the\r\nrelief of constipation, by the decrease of congestion by laxatives,\r\nand by the persuasion that there is nothing which will go on to\r\nserious developments (this is the most disturbing of dreads) but only\r\na condition that will probably get no worse and the symptoms from\r\nwhich may yield to general treatment.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of many so-called remedies for women's diseases is due\r\nto their success in lifting the veil of discouragement and, by\r\nalcoholic and other tonic stimulation, helping the women into a better\r\ngeneral condition and a more favorable frame of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Individual.--In all cases of dysmenorrhea, then, it is important\r\nnot to be influenced too much by the complaints (for here, as\r\nBroadbent insists with regard to angina pectoris, the more complaint\r\nwe have the less serious the condition will often be), but to\r\ninvestigate the patient's condition and, where there is not some\r\ndefinite and serious pathological lesion, to analyze the beginning and\r\nthe development of the individual case and eliminate the neurotic\r\nelements. Often the menstrual difficulty is due to suggestion, as the\r\npatient has been in contact with others who were sufferers and caught\r\nher complaint from them by psychic contagion. Special investigation is\r\nneeded as to her occupation of mind. This must be provided for her.\r\nNothing else will save her from herself. Travel may do it, exercise\r\nmay be helpful, but an occupation in which she is deeply interested,\r\nespecially if it involves {447} association with other people, is the\r\nbest basis of psychic treatment. Improvement of the general health and\r\nthe relief of various symptoms are auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion.--After consulting with many women physicians,\r\nwith many women who have lived active lives, with many superiors of\r\nreligious orders in consultation about their religious women, I cannot\r\nbut conclude that painful menstruation is ever so much oftener a\r\nresult of mental and nervous states than of organic disturbances.\r\nUnfortunately a tradition has now been established that women suffer\r\nmuch at this time, so many of them give in to their feelings,\r\nexaggerate their discomfort, dwell on their sensations, affect the\r\nblood supply to the genital organs through the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem, actually produce functionally pathological hyperemia where\r\nonly physiological was present (the simile of the blush makes this\r\neasy to understand), and finally set up a condition that is actually\r\npainful, though there was only some discomforting sense of compression\r\nand congestion before. We have been educating young girls in disease,\r\nnot in health. Plato pleaded for the opposite. After these 2,400 years\r\nwe might take it up seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMENORRHAGIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the influence of the mind in producing painful menstruation and\r\na much diminished menstrual flow is well recognized, the connection\r\nbetween the mind and an increased menstrual flow is not so generally\r\nappreciated. Usually profuse menstruation (especially when it reaches\r\na height where it would properly be called menorrhagia) is considered\r\nto be due to some serious pathological condition. Its most frequent\r\ncause is undoubtedly subinvolution of the uterus after pregnancy, or\r\nan overgrowth of the uterine mucosa because of some pathological\r\ncondition--usually an infection. While menorrhagia is often attributed\r\nto colds or to getting the feet wet (and undoubtedly the disturbance\r\nof the circulation consequent upon wet feet is an active factor in the\r\nproduction of an increased menstrual flow) there is no doubt that in\r\nmost cases there is some more distinctly local cause at work. Another\r\nimportant cause of profuse menstruation is the presence of a fibroid\r\ntumor or other neoplasm which brings an increased blood supply to the\r\nuterus and a consequent greater elimination at the menstrual epoch.\r\n\r\nIn most cases of subinvolution a curettage, at least, will have to be\r\ndone. Often the use of extremely hot douches, that is, just as hot as\r\ncan be borne, may accomplish much. Such quantities as a quart or two\r\nare useless; several gallons should be taken, and that not in the\r\nawkward cramped postures in which douching is sometimes done and in\r\nwhich it cannot be expected to accomplish its purpose, but in the\r\nreclining position and to be followed by an hour or two of rest with\r\nthe hips elevated. This treatment will be more effective if women do\r\nnot get the idea that an operation will surely have to be done on\r\nthem. Operations are now so much spoken about that some women\r\napparently do not feel that they have had quite all the experience\r\nthat is coming to them in life unless they have at least one to their\r\ncredit. If they can be made to realize that, in the past before the\r\ndays of operative gynecology, most such cases recovered of themselves\r\nand that now if courage is {448} resumed, appetite strengthened\r\nthrough the will, constipation relieved, an abundance of outdoor air\r\nsecured (exercise is not so necessary), recovery will probably be more\r\ncomplete than after an operation, there would be much less need of\r\noperations than at present.\r\n\r\nThe material conditions based upon pathological changes which usually\r\nproduce menorrhagia hardly seem amenable to influence by the patient's\r\nstate of mind, yet experience demonstrates that much can be done for\r\nthese patients by setting their minds at rest, by improving their\r\ngeneral condition, by soothing their worry as to what the profuse flow\r\nmeans. Many nervous patients have quite normal menstruation, as\r\nregards the length and quantity of flow, until some serious\r\ndisturbance occurs in their mental state. I have had patients who for\r\nmonths would have a perfectly normal menstrual flow of three to five\r\ndays to whom a serious mental disturbance always brings a profuse\r\nmenstruation. The arrest of a woman by mistake just before or at the\r\nbeginning of her menstrual period will often cause a greatly increased\r\nflow and great weakness will follow. Women approaching the menopause\r\nalready have a tendency to an increased flow though not beyond the\r\nbounds of what might be considered normal, and at this time almost any\r\nshock will produce profuse menstruation and lead to prostration. If\r\nthe secondary anemia from this is not overcome during the interval\r\nprofuse menstruations may succeed each other for many months.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for reassuring these women, therefore, becomes evident.\r\nMost of us have seen women who were worried at having a slightly\r\nincreased menstruation, and who had been told that they had a fibroid\r\ntumor which was producing the increased menstruation, and which would\r\nhave to be removed if it continued to bring on this serious condition.\r\nSuch a suggestion inevitably leads to a series of more profuse\r\nmenstruations during the following months. Such women worry over their\r\nstate and dread an operation. They do not eat well and, even though\r\nthey do not lose much in weight, they often become distinctly anemic.\r\nThis anemia adds to the tendency to a freer flow and as a consequence\r\nthe menstrual period is lengthened in time and increased in amount.\r\nThis soon brings them to operation, though very often there has been\r\nno increase in size of the fibroid tumor and there is no more reason\r\nfor operation than there was when they were first examined.\r\n\r\nI have had under observation during the last two years a patient in\r\nwhom the diagnosis of a fibroid brought this unfortunate result. Her\r\nmenstruation had been profuse and prolonged before but now it became\r\nstill longer and lasted nearly fifteen days each month. As she lost\r\nmuch in weight, was run down in strength, became self-centered, stayed\r\nmore at home, and took less exercise, the resultant depression in her\r\ngeneral condition emphasized the menorrhagia. As soon as it was made\r\nclear to her that her case had but one indication for operation--the\r\nloss of blood and that the fibroid was so small that it might well be\r\nallowed to remain until after her menopause, when involution would\r\nprobably prevent further unfavorable action, she took heart, began to\r\nexercise, ate more heartily, her marked constipation was relieved, she\r\nslept better and in three months her menstruation was almost normal.\r\nFor many months she had no menorrhagia.\r\n\r\nI have seen other cases in which amelioration of symptoms came just as\r\nsoon as the patient learned that, by improvement in the general\r\nhealth, there {449} was a possibility of lessening the tendency to\r\nhemorrhage and thus of putting off the necessity for operation for a\r\ntime at least, if not until such natural changes occurred in the\r\nsystem as to lessen the danger from the growing tumor. I have in mind\r\nthe wife of a physician whose menopause was delayed for some ten years\r\nas a consequence of a good-sized fibroid growth. She had it when she\r\nfirst came to me, and I watched the case for some seven years, and she\r\nabsolutely refused to entertain the idea of operation. I set her mind\r\nat rest as to the seriousness of the growth provided the bleeding was\r\nnot injurious and no infective conditions occurred through the\r\nintestinal walls to complicate the condition and cause adhesions.\r\nWhenever she worked hard, or whenever she was much worried, she would\r\nhave alarming flooding. Under ordinary circumstances, however, when\r\nthings did not go awry, she had a menstruation somewhat more profuse\r\nthan normal and of five or six days in length. This continued from her\r\nfiftieth to her fifty-fifth year, and then gradually subsided. She is\r\nstill alive at the age of sixty and, though she has had many trials\r\nand hardships at the end of her life, she is healthy and considers\r\nherself much better off than if she had had an operation. I doubt\r\nwhether this is true, that is, if the operation had been done twenty\r\nyears ago. But, after watching such a case and realizing that\r\noperations on fibroids are more often fatal than any other of the\r\ngynecologic operations that do not involve serious conditions, a\r\nphysician is justified in tiding women over the time to their\r\nmenopause and then letting nature dispose. Infective incidents\r\npointing to the formation of adhesions are a contraindication to this\r\npolicy, however.\r\n\r\nThe sufferer in this case was one of the most patient of women. She\r\nhad had to suffer much in mind and in body as the result of being left\r\nalmost destitute after a life of luxury, yet she seldom complained.\r\nOne might almost think her indifferent to hardship if one did not know\r\nher well. She was not at all a stoic but she never allowed her\r\nimagination to run away with her, she bore the ills of the day without\r\nthinking of what was going to come next week and she worried as little\r\nas possible under the circumstances. The ordinary woman, nervous and\r\nexcitable, would have broken down under the strain that was placed\r\nupon her but she promises to live to a good age and her trials have\r\nnot hurt her vitality nor spoiled her disposition and she looks the\r\nworld in the face with surprising cheerfulness. This state of mind\r\nmodifies even fibroid menorrhagia favorably.\r\n\r\nFibroids have been reported \"cured\" by so many different\r\nremedies--local applications, acupuncture, hot needles, electricity in\r\nvarious forms, even internal treatment, which afterwards proved quite\r\nunavailing--that it is manifest that the mind plays a large role in\r\ncontrolling the symptoms.\r\n\r\nBefore operation it is important to put the minds of these patients\r\ninto an attitude of confidence, for operators who make it a point to\r\nsecure the confidence of their patients, or who for some reason have\r\ntheir full faith, have better results in these cases than others of\r\nequal surgical skill.\r\n\r\nIn unmarried women the development of a small fibroid with its reflex\r\ndisturbances is sure to be followed by excessive reaction in many\r\nways. Nervous symptoms are likely to be marked and the increase in\r\nmenstruation is usually much more profuse as a consequence of the\r\nsolicitude than because of the fibroid. Some of these tumors which,\r\nthough of small size, are so situated with regard to the nervous and\r\ncirculatory systems of the uterus as to produce {450} profuse\r\nmenstruation even in women of phlegmatic disposition. In these\r\npatients operations will be necessary whenever the loss of blood makes\r\nit clear that the drain on the system is producing serious effects.\r\nThere are cases, however, in which the menorrhagia is not due directly\r\nto the fibroid, but rather to its effect upon the general system and\r\nthis may be lessened very much by reassurance, by regulation of the\r\ngeneral health, by resumption of exercise and toning up of appetite\r\nand, above all, by relief of the constipation which so often\r\ncomplicates these cases. Fibroids may or may not continue to grow. The\r\nremoval of one is no guarantee that others will not form, nor that\r\nothers are not present in very small form which will develop later. As\r\na rule, there can be no question of the removal of the uterus unless\r\nconditions are serious.\r\n\r\nIf in spite of general treatment and the calming of the patient as far\r\nas possible profuse menstruation continues, it is an indication for\r\nsurgical intervention. Psychotherapy may readily be abused in these\r\ncases, but it has a distinct use, and its application is more\r\nfrequently successful than has been thought; but it must be\r\ndeliberately employed. When, however, menorrhagia is a symptom of some\r\nserious progressive condition, psychotherapy will do harm rather than\r\ngood. I have known women whose menstruation was stopped and then\r\nrecurred and even became profuse reassured that this was only a\r\nsymptom of the menopause when it was the first symptom of a cancer. In\r\nsuch cases there must be no temporizing or reassurance, but a careful\r\ndetermination of the actual condition must be made and immediate\r\noperation done if it seems necessary. Psychotherapy may have a place\r\nin incurable cancer, but in other cases it has none at all except to\r\ncalm the patient for operation where surgery may be of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MENOPAUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the phase of feminine sexual life which involves the cessation\r\nof menstruation is physiological and not morbid, it is so commonly\r\nassociated with physical and mental symptoms difficult to bear that,\r\npractically always, it sends the woman to a physician. This is as true\r\nof the artificial menopause induced by removal of ovaries as it is of\r\nthe normal process by which, in the course of time, ovarian function\r\ncomes to an end and changes are brought about in the system consequent\r\nupon the absence of ovarian secretion. The ovaries, like many other\r\norgans, have two functions. One, that of ovulation, is so prominent\r\nthat the other, the internal secretion, has been too much neglected.\r\nHow important this is, however, may be judged from the change that\r\ncomes over feminine nature after its cessation. Much of the\r\nemotionality of woman disappears, not a few of her special sex\r\nqualities are modified and even masculine physical peculiarities may\r\nassert themselves. The physical effects of the ovarian internal\r\nsecretion may be inferred from the definite tendency to grow stout\r\nwhich results from its suppression by the menopause. Certain changes\r\nin the organism are inevitable then, and the only hope of therapy is\r\nto keep them from disturbing life processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeutralizing Unfavorable Mental Attitude.--Psychotherapy can do more\r\n{451} for the troubles of the menopause than any other treatment. The\r\nsymptoms of the change of life in the long ago, if we can trust\r\ntraditions, were not so troublesome as they are now. Only rarely did\r\nwomen suffer from it as they are supposed to suffer at the present\r\ntime. Women are so persuaded that there is to be much suffering, or at\r\nleast prolonged physical discomfort, as to make it difficult for them\r\nto be quite themselves. They are prone to think that their physical\r\nsymptoms are noted, and that their condition is a subject of remark.\r\nThis adds to the difficulty of bearing in patience whatever symptoms\r\nare present. The introspective attitude of our time has reacted upon\r\nsuch affections as occur in the menopause, and, by creating an\r\nabnormal susceptibility of mind, has added much not only to its\r\npossibility but also to its actuality of suffering. Drugs or other\r\nremedial measures will modify the conditions only partially and\r\ntemporarily. The mental prophylaxis of suggestion must alter the state\r\nof mind both before and during the progress of the condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Suggestion.--After the menopause women are less disturbed by\r\nemotional strains and troubles of any kind than before. They settle\r\ndown into more placid, easy-going lives. They are not subjected to the\r\nmonthly interruption of their routine of work or amusement, everything\r\ncomes a little easier to them, and they are not, to use the word in\r\nits physiological sense, so irritable--that is, so responsive in\r\nreaction. They are not so likely to respond to slight irritations, and\r\nare often physically and mentally more content with life. This must be\r\ninsisted upon, for, at the present time, unfavorable suggestion with\r\nregard to the menopause is the universal rule. Women look for the\r\nworst from it, and their expectation makes conditions less tolerable\r\nthan they really are. Most women dread it as if it were the beginning\r\nof the end of life, the first descent into old age, while it is often\r\nthe dawn of a larger and broader life free from sexual and other\r\nirritations, and with better possibilities of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinite Prescriptions.--These patients are best reassured by being\r\ntold that every woman who has lived to the age of fifty has gone\r\nthrough a similar experience and that they have all, with rare\r\nexceptions, revived with health of both body and mind. It is more\r\nimportant to insist on the patients cultivating a certain gaiety of\r\ndisposition, to plan for regular diversions two or three times a week,\r\nto see that they are not too much alone and that they find abundant\r\noccupation of mind and body, than to try to combat their manifold\r\nsymptoms by drugs or local measures. Of course, their physical\r\nfunctions must be kept normal. It is surprising, however, how much\r\nimprovement can be brought about in the menopause symptoms by definite\r\nprescriptions as to the time to be spent in the open air--at least two\r\nor three hours a day--with regard to having a definite diversion of\r\nsome kind in mind two or three days ahead to which they look forward\r\nwith pleasure, and by convincing them that whenever they allow\r\nthemselves to dwell much on their condition, their symptoms of\r\ndiscomfort will become so severe as to be intolerable, while when they\r\nare occupied with other things they will find them quite easy to bear.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, mothers of families with many cares and diversions of mind,\r\nwith little time to think of themselves, do not suffer much at this\r\nperiod, or at least not nearly so much as do those who are without\r\nthese diversions. The more time a woman has to think about herself at\r\nthis period, the worse for {452} her. Her irritability of mind will be\r\nreflected upon her physical condition and make it worse. In the olden\r\ntime mothers of families went through it and no one knew about it, or\r\neven noticed that there was anything the matter with them except\r\npossibly a little increased irritability at certain periods. Neither\r\nmenstruation nor the menopause is necessarily connected with more than\r\npassing discomfort, if the patient is in good health. This is\r\nperfectly true if symptoms are not brooded over, if there is not too\r\nmuch expectancy of evils, and the feelings and manifestations which do\r\nnot deserve the name of symptoms are taken as a matter of course. Best\r\nof all, let the woman keep her mind well occupied with many\r\nduties--with care for others, the helpless, the ailing, around her,\r\ninstead of with herself and her passing ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Insanity.--There are few women who go through this period\r\nwithout the hideous thought that possibly they may go crazy. This is\r\nespecially likely if, as a consequence of the exaggerated desire for\r\nseclusion that many women have at this time, they do not get out into\r\nthe air nor exercise as much as they should. As a consequence, they\r\nsuffer from constipation, from lack of appetite, and capriciousness of\r\ntaste for food, and they may have a series of symptoms that, when\r\ndwelt on during the hours of solitude, very seriously disturb the good\r\nfeeling that is so important for the normal accomplishment of\r\nphysiological functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversion of Mind.--This tendency to withdraw from social relations\r\nwith their friends and from the occupations that take them out of\r\ndoors and which are often a helpful diversion of mind is one of the\r\nworst symptoms of this time and must be strenuously combated. It\r\nsuperinduces a series of physical symptoms which are attributed to the\r\nmenopause but are really due to lack of air, to inactivity, to absence\r\nof interest and the consequent opportunity provided for unfortunate\r\nauto-suggestion and introspection. These superadded physical symptoms\r\ncan be readily relieved by directions for rational living and then the\r\ngenuine menopause symptoms may be so diminished as to be scarcely\r\nnoticeable. It is impossible for the ordinary human being to stay much\r\nin the house, to lie down a large part of the time, eat irregularly\r\nand let the bowels become sluggish without having many symptoms of\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Treatment.--The treatment, not of the menopause but of the\r\npatients passing through the menopause, then, must consist, first, in\r\nputting them in as good physical condition as possible and keeping\r\nthem in it; second, in maintaining such normal natural habits of life\r\nas will enable them to keep up this physical condition without\r\ndisturbance; thirdly, in putting off solicitude with regard to the\r\nmenopause and realizing that it is a normal natural process with a\r\ndefinite place in human life and not at all representing a terminal\r\nstage of human existence. Nature meant that the mature woman, formed\r\nby precious experience, with sympathies broadened by years, should be\r\nable to devote herself without sexual irritation to the many things\r\nthat naturally come to her at this period. There is a place in life\r\nfor the grandmother and even for the grandaunt, though a French\r\nvisitor recently declared that he thought there must be no\r\ngrandmothers in America since all the women seemed to dress in the\r\nfashion of the young girl. If this submission to natural conditions is\r\nrecognized and accepted there are long years of happiness and\r\nhelpfulness in store for the woman of middle age and the menopause may\r\nbe welcomed as an important step towards a larger development of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n{453}\r\n\r\nSECTION XI\r\n\r\n_PSYCHOTHERAPY IN OBSTETRICS_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION IN OBSTETRICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no department of medicine is favorable or unfavorable mental\r\ninfluence more important than in obstetrics. Unfortunately,\r\nunfavorable suggestion has here played a serious role and must be\r\ncontrolled, modified, neutralized. Suggestion is valuable in its every\r\nphase, during the course of pregnancy, in labor itself, in\r\n_post-partum_ convalescence, and with regard to nursing. Many women in\r\nour time are prone to persuade themselves that labor is a more serious\r\nincident than it usually proves to be and the consequence is an\r\nunfortunate suggestion of pain to come that so exaggerates\r\nsensitiveness as to make the actual suffering seem more than it really\r\nis. Sympathy expressed for women in pregnancy and in anticipation of\r\ntheir labor is sure to do more harm than good. Pain instead of being\r\nlessened by sympathy is increased and capacity to bear it is\r\ndiminished. Anything that calls attention more particularly to the\r\npain removes distracting conditions that might modify it favorably.\r\nAnimals have the admirable instinct of withdrawing to some quiet\r\ncorner when they are in pain, preferring to be alone. In this they\r\nfollow nature and imitation of them is worthy of consideration, at\r\nleast so far as the avoidance of opportunities for the expression of\r\nsympathy is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Health.--Women must keep up their normal health and\r\nstrength during pregnancy. By not taking sufficient exercise and by\r\nbeing too much indoors, many women develop a morbid mental state in\r\nwhich every discomfort is less bearable than it was before. Lack of\r\nair and of exercise, furthermore, makes them prone to constipation,\r\nmakes their sleep less restful, and reduces the appetite. For the sake\r\nof the being within them, they force themselves to eat, but this often\r\nserves only to make them obese, without improving their general\r\nhealth. If a woman in her ordinary condition, who was accustomed to\r\ngoing out-of-doors several hours every day and having reasonable\r\ndiversion of mind and exercise of body, were to adopt the habits of\r\nlife that many pregnant women form, she, too, would become morbidly\r\nintrospective, fearful of the future, irritable over little things,\r\nrestless at night, and even have certain physical symptoms, such as\r\nconstipation, tired feelings, loss of {454} appetite, etc. Many of the\r\ndiscomforts and symptoms of which women complain during pregnancy are\r\nreally due to unfortunate habits and to their mental attitude toward\r\ntheir conditions, rather than to any specific influence of pregnancy\r\non the general health. As a rule, women who live naturally are in\r\nsomewhat better physical health during pregnancy that at other times.\r\n\r\n\r\nObesity and Pregnancy.--It is important that women should not become\r\nobese during pregnancy. The woman who is taking too much fat in her\r\ndiet and accumulating fat is likely to have a fat baby, and with these\r\nthere is more difficulty in labor itself, and the infants have less\r\nresistive vitality than if they were unencumbered with useless adipose\r\ntissue. Her will must overcome the tendency to lassitude and the\r\nproneness to inactivity that comes over her, and she must feel that\r\nlabor and her condition after it are dependent on normal, healthy life\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelayed Labor and Suggestion.--One phase of maternal impressions or of\r\nsuggestion for the mother's mind that I have always been interested in\r\nhas been that of the possibility of preventing delay in parturition by\r\nfrequent suggestion of the time that delivery should be expected.\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that expectation has some influence on the\r\ntime of delivery. We do not know just why, after the uterus has\r\ntolerated the presence of the fetus for nine calendar months, it\r\nshould then refuse to do so any longer and contract and expel it. Any\r\nnumber of theories have been suggested and even now our best\r\nobstetricians are not agreed as to the reason for this action on the\r\npart of the uterus. In some cases this contraction does not take place\r\nnormally. The due term of labor is past and as a consequence fetuses\r\ngrow too large within the uterus, greatly increasing the difficulties\r\nof parturition and adding to the risk of both mother and child. It is\r\nthe custom to announce with pride the birth of twelve- and\r\nfifteen-pound babies, but it is doubtful whether nature intended that\r\ngrowth to this extent should take place before birth. There is in\r\nthis, as in other phases of pride with regard to children, a curiously\r\nperverted feeling.\r\n\r\nMany obstetricians feel that the babies who weigh much more than the\r\naverage of seven pounds have probably been delayed in the uterus for a\r\nlunar month beyond the time when they should, or at least could have\r\nbeen normally born. It is a question whether this delay would have\r\noccurred if the mother's expectation of the birth had been directed to\r\na date a month ahead of that on which her mind became fixed as the\r\ntime of labor. Parturition usually takes place about the period of the\r\nrecurrence of the menstrual molimina, or at least of that monthly\r\ncyclic feeling which many women experience, though there is no flow.\r\nIt is not always easy to say at which of two monthly periods the birth\r\nshould be expected. While physicians have warned patients of the\r\npossibility of the child being born at the first of the two possible\r\nperiods, they have been inclined to dwell on the fact that it will\r\nprobably be delayed until the later term. Women themselves are more\r\nprone to take the later than the earlier termination of their\r\npregnancy. Both physician and patient are timorous of the ridicule\r\nthat may follow if they make premature announcements. Whether we have\r\nnot in this way created a tradition tending to delay parturition by a\r\nlunar month in many cases, is a problem that requires careful study.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of as early a period as is compatible with the data\r\nprovided, so as to create a definite expectancy in the mother's mind,\r\nseems well worth {455} deliberate attention. This is a role that\r\npsychotherapy has to play in lessening the dangers and the\r\ndifficulties of parturition. With most healthy women, as indeed with\r\nmost sensible normal women in life as regards all things, no\r\nsuggestion is needed and nature will take her course promptly and\r\nproperly. It is the nervous women, over-anxious about themselves,\r\noften of lax physical fiber because of their nervous condition, that\r\nneed this phase of psychotherapy. It is in them that the unfavorable\r\nor mistaken suggestion may be emphasized to such a degree as to delay\r\nlabor for a lunar month or even more.\r\n\r\n\r\nVomiting of Pregnancy.--One of the dreaded complications of pregnancy\r\nis serious prolonged vomiting. We know now that this is of two kinds,\r\ntoxic and neurotic. The toxic variety may be associated with kidney\r\nchanges, but is more commonly the consequence of certain rare forms of\r\ndegeneration of the liver. The pathological picture after death is not\r\nunlike that of phosphorus poisoning. These cases are due to some\r\nserious disturbance of metabolism or to the absorption of some little\r\nunderstood poison. They are probably always fatal. The cases of\r\nneurotic vomiting are rather common. They are exaggerations, of the\r\nordinary familiar vomiting of pregnancy which is exhibited by nearly\r\nall women at the recurrence of the menstrual times in the early\r\nportion of pregnancy. In some of these cases, however, the vomiting is\r\nso persistent and so prolonged that the patient's nutrition suffers\r\nseverely, and there seems to be danger of a fatal termination.  The\r\ncondition has received the unfortunate name of \"pernicious vomiting.\"\r\nIn these cases there is sometimes question of the advisability of\r\nterminating the pregnancy lest the woman should die. Unfortunately\r\nthis question has been so commonly discussed that most prospective\r\nmothers are likely to know something about it, so that when vomiting\r\nbegins they are fearful lest they should have to lose their child.\r\nThis becomes an obsession in some minds and an unfavorable suggestion\r\nthat helps to maintain the vomiting.\r\n\r\nA number of remedies have been highly recommended for this at various\r\ntimes. Nearly every alterative drug has had its period of popularity.\r\nIn the older time nitrate of silver was said to be efficacious. Small\r\ndoses of ipecac were highly recommended at one time. Small doses of\r\ncocain were suggested, and the painting of the back of the throat with\r\ncocain. Small doses of morphin had a vogue; codein had its turn after\r\nits introduction, and heroin also had a time of popularity. Oxalate of\r\ncerium was highly recommended. Any obstetrician of experience will\r\nremember many other remedies that have been supposed to be\r\nefficacious. Various gynecological procedures have been suggested: the\r\ntouching of the _cervix uteri_ with a mild caustic, with iodin or with\r\nnitrate of silver, slight dilatation of the cervix, sometimes the\r\napplication of a tampon with just enough glycerin to produce a\r\nreaction, but not enough to terminate the pregnancy. Occasionally\r\nlocal applications over the stomach region, a mustard leaf, or certain\r\nplasters, or finally even a piece of sized paper bound on over this\r\nregion have been known to be followed by the cessation of the\r\nvomiting. When as many different remedies are recommended and seem for\r\na time to be successful and then later prove to be inefficacious, it\r\nis reasonably clear that it is not the remedies but the effect\r\nproduced by these on the mind that is the important therapeutic\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nMany obstetricians of wide experience now teach that most of these\r\ncases of vomiting in pregnancy are merely neurotic and are to be\r\ntreated entirely {456} as if they were hysterical. The patient's mind\r\nis to be distracted from her condition; she is to be assured that even\r\nsevere vomiting is quite common in pregnancy, that it is annoying, but\r\nnever serious in its consequences, that it always ends without\r\nunfortunate incident for mother or child, and that there need be no\r\nsolicitude. Above all, no hint of the possibility of the necessity for\r\nthe termination of the pregnancy, if vomiting continues, should be\r\ngiven. Some physicians are entirely too solicitous in the matter and\r\nhave by their anxiety made the neurotic condition of their patients\r\nworse. Some men see what they call a \"pernicious vomiting\" in every\r\nhundred labors. A well-known obstetrician in New York has had 3,000\r\nbirths without seeing a single case. He is known for his placidity and\r\nlack of over-anxiety. In the great obstetrical clinics in Europe\r\nvomiting to the extent that will put mother or child in danger is\r\nextremely rare. The greatest obstetrician of the later nineteenth\r\ncentury reports 100,000 obstetrical cases with only one artificial\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nIn foreign obstetrical clinics these cases in recent years have been\r\ntreated expectantly, without any active interference, especially with\r\npregnancy, and the results have been much more satisfactory than any\r\nother method of treatment. There are a number of cases on record now\r\nin which pregnant women have lost from twenty to forty pounds as the\r\nresult of vomiting for weeks, yet after a time the attack has passed\r\nand they have carried the child to full term. Where vomiting has\r\noccurred and relief has once been afforded by the termination of\r\npregnancy, it is very unlikely that succeeding pregnancies will pass\r\nwithout corresponding conditions in which no remedy will prove\r\neffective, except the dreaded obstetrical intervention for the\r\ntermination of the pregnancy. It is extremely important then that\r\nthese cases should be treated conservatively and that from the very\r\nbeginning there should be nothing to arouse the patient's solicitude\r\nwith regard to herself or above all to give her any hint of the\r\npossibility of obstetrical intervention being necessary in her case.\r\nFor some women the knowledge that a consultation has been held to\r\ndiscuss such a possibility will of itself prove a persistent\r\nunfavorable suggestion, that will surely prolong the vomiting.\r\n\r\nThis may seem a rather strong opinion from one who is not in practical\r\ntouch with obstetrics. It has been the growing opinion, however, among\r\nthe great German obstetricians for the last generation. Ahlfeld, in\r\nthe _Archiv fuer Gynaekologie_ (Band 18 Heft 2 page 310) said that he\r\nhad seen [in a very large obstetrical practice] three cases of\r\nso-called pernicious vomiting (_unstillbaren Erbrechen_) in all of\r\nwhich the patients wanted an abortion because they had previously\r\nlearned the success of this method of treatment, but all of them\r\nrecovered without incident and carried their children to term. Kronig,\r\nten years ago, in his monograph on \"The Significance of Functional\r\nNervous Diseases for Diagnosis and Treatment in Gynaecology\"\r\n[Footnote 36] said: \"The excessive vomiting of pregnant patients has\r\nfor a long time seemed to be a genital reflex neurosis. We thought\r\nthat the growing uterus irritates certain nerve tracts which are\r\nconnected with the mucous membrane of the stomach. We owe it to\r\nKaltenbach that this opinion was overturned and _hyperemesis\r\ngravidarum_ set down as the result of a functional neurosis,\r\nhysterical in character. A large number of gynaecologists have\r\naccepted this opinion in recent {457} years (men of all nations) among\r\nothers Calderini, Charpentier, Schaeffer, Klein, and Graefe.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 36: Ueber die Bedeutung der Funktionellen Nervenkrankhelten\r\n  fuer die Diagnostik und Therapie in der Gynakologie von Dr. B.\r\n  Kronig. Leipzig, 1902.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWinkel and the leading obstetricians of Germany, especially the\r\ndirectors of obstetrical clinics in the large cities, must be quoted\r\nas of the same opinion, since Winkel has collected the statistics of\r\n100,000 pregnancies in the large German clinics in which 6,555\r\nobstetrical operations were performed and in only one case was\r\nartificial abortion produced. German opinion is rather strong in the\r\nassertion that a number of cases of abortion in the practice of an\r\nobstetrician indicates over-hastiness in coming to conclusions as to\r\ndanger, or leaves him open to the suspicion of yielding too readily to\r\nthe wishes of mothers who would prefer not to carry their children to\r\nterm. The suggestion of the possible necessity for abortion has done\r\nmuch to make the hysterical vomiting of these patients continue until\r\nthis remedy is employed. Insistence from the very beginning that\r\nvomiting, though it may injure both mother and child, never\r\nnecessitates abortion--one out of 100,000 cases is practically\r\nnever--would be the best possible contrasuggestion.\r\n\r\nKronig thinks that the vomiting of pregnancy is an especially\r\nfavorable subject for suggestive treatment. He inclines to the opinion\r\nthat the remedies that have been reported to do good and so many of\r\nwhich have subsequently proved unavailing have really owed whatever\r\nsuccess they have had to the suggestion that went with them. Bumm, in\r\nhis text-book of obstetrics (Grundriss zum Studium der Geburtshuelfe\r\nvon Dr. Ernst Bumm, Wiesbaden, 1902), accepts Kaltenbach's and\r\nAhfeld's conclusions and thinks that the consideration of\r\n_hyperemesis_ as an hysterical neurosis is well supported by the\r\nsuccess and failure of our therapeutics. All sorts of remedies, any\r\nnumber of drugs, all manner of gynecological procedures short of\r\nabortion, though also including abortion, have been reported as doing\r\ngood. All of them even including abortion have failed in a certain\r\nnumber of cases. Evidently suggestion plays a large role. Hypnosis\r\noften proves an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcessive Salivary Secretion.--Bumm considers that the excess of\r\nsecretion of saliva which is so often noticed in pregnancy is of the\r\nsame nature and should be treated rather by suggestion than by any\r\nparticular remedy, though remedies should be tried because of certain\r\nhelpful physical effects, and then the psychic element that goes with\r\nthem. The less importance given to the symptom, the less attention it\r\nattracts, the more its passing trivial character is emphasized, the\r\nsooner it will subside. Solicitude causes it to persist and even\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion in Labor.--When the subjects are normal, expectancy has\r\nmuch to do with the severity of labor pains. In recent years so much\r\nfuss has been made and so much said and written about woman's burden\r\nand travail in the pains of childbirth, that preliminary dread and\r\nanxious attention have wrought young women up to such a poignancy of\r\nexpectation as to make these pains worse than they really are. In the\r\nold days child-bearing was as much a matter of course as the husband\r\ngoing out to his daily work, and the taking of the dangers and\r\nfatigues of it was a simple matter of duty. Labor was then {458}\r\ncomparatively easy and, while never pleasant, was also never an\r\nover-uncomfortable process. The effect of unfortunate suggestion has\r\nbeen to make it seem ever so much worse than it really is. Multiparae\r\nfurnish the best proof of this. A healthy woman who has already had\r\nmore than one child does not dread labor pains very much, or only to a\r\nslight degree, because the previous maternities have lessened the\r\nphysical pain to be experienced, though a healthy woman's tissues are\r\nso thoroughly resilient that nature is able to bring about a return to\r\nnormal conditions so complete that it is not always easy to decide\r\nwhether a woman has given birth to a child or not. Of course, there\r\nare many cases in which tears reveal the former labor, but there are\r\nothers in which it is not so, and the renewal of the birth process\r\nmust, therefore, be nearly if not quite as painful as before,\r\nespecially if it is recalled that succeeding children are usually\r\nlarger. In spite of this in multiparae, labor has lost most of its\r\nterrors because real knowledge of its comparative ease has replaced\r\nthe previous unfavorable suggestion, and instead there has come a\r\nproper appreciation of what will have to be borne, and of the positive\r\npleasure of the relief when it has been borne successfully.\r\n\r\nHealthy women of the lower classes have so little difficulty in labor\r\nthat they are quite frank to confess that it means scarcely more than\r\na few severe muscular pains during an hour or so. Some of them mind it\r\nso little that up to within half an hour of the birth of the baby they\r\noccupy themselves with other things and succeed effectually in\r\ndistracting their pains away.\r\n\r\nIn their article on \"Hypnotism and Suggestion in Obstetrics\" Drs.\r\nAuvard and Secheron   [Footnote 37] suggest that hypnotism can be\r\nemployed with advantage during labor, but it is more difficult to\r\nproduce it then than in the normal condition. Its only advantage is\r\nanesthesia, and this can be obtained during the preliminary pains in\r\nmany cases. It is frequently impossible to produce complete\r\nanesthesia, however. To replace hypnotism they advise that suggestion\r\nin the waking state be used and they even suggest the employment of\r\npseudo-choloroform or other like means. This method they consider more\r\nadvisable than hypnotism, for there are no inconveniences and many\r\nreal advantages. The nervous condition of the patient after hypnotism\r\nduring labor is sometimes far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 37: \"L'Hypnotisme et la Suggestion en Obstetrique,\"\r\n  Paris, 1888.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNature's Methods.--In obstetrics and labor we have been finding in\r\nrecent years that we have not trusted nature enough, have not looked\r\nsufficiently to the woman herself for assistance in its difficulties,\r\nand have made her too much a passive rather than an active factor.\r\nPractically all of the dangers that have accrued to the woman in\r\nchildbirth, certainly many times more than have come from any other\r\nfactor, have been due to well-meant but unfortunate attempts to help\r\nher while preventing her from helping herself. Before the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century most of the puerperal fever was due to\r\ninfection from over-zealous but unclean attendants. Now men are\r\nproudly reporting hundreds of cases of delivery without even a vaginal\r\nexamination. Above all, we have failed to take advantage of the\r\noccupation of mind that could be used to save women much of the\r\nanxiety and suffering of labor. If the parturient woman were allowed\r\nto change her position, as she does so naturally and frequently in a\r\nstate of unsophistication, and to help actively, as she can {459} in\r\nmany postures, in the delivery of her child, it would mean much in\r\ndiverting her mind from pain which is emphasized by inactivity. The\r\nrule of having the woman lie on her back has been unfortunate in many\r\nways and has required much more external interference than if other\r\npositions were adopted, while the pains have been more unbearable\r\nbecause that is actually the position in which the woman suffers most\r\nand in which she can do least to lessen them.\r\n\r\nI was once told by an Irish grandmother the story of nearly one\r\nhundred deliveries without accident of any kind, in which the only\r\nrule had been not to touch the woman, but to allow her to change her\r\nposition and, above all, to facilitate her in getting on her knees in\r\na stooping bent-over posture so as to help herself. The upper mattress\r\nwas doubled over completely and the woman was encouraged to kneel on\r\nthe lower straw mattress, which was so arranged that it could be\r\nchanged completely, or destroyed immediately after labor. This seemed\r\nold-fashioned and unscientific twenty years ago, when I heard the\r\nstory, but I have been interested recently in reading Professor King's\r\naddress on \"The Significance of Posture in Obstetrics.\"   [Footnote\r\n38]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 38: _Bulletin of the Lying-in Hospital_, Vol. V, No. IV.]\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor King is sure that there are many advantages in following\r\ncertain natural inclinations of the mother to change her position and\r\nthat this helps her in many ways. Above all, as the psychotherapist\r\nsees at once, it will occupy her mind, keep down anxiety and lessen\r\npain in many natural ways, besides encouraging concentration of\r\nattention on muscular effort instead of on painful sensation. The\r\nwhole article is well worth reading, for in it he suggests that\r\ncertain obstetrical operations, even version, would not be so often\r\nnecessary, if the woman were sometimes allowed to assume the squatting\r\nposition in the course of birth. His illustrations make very clear the\r\nhelp that changes of position are in the mechanics of many\r\ndifficulties of labor. The pressure of the patient's thigh on the\r\nabdomen, when she was allowed to assume a squatting position, enabled\r\nhim, in a case in which the woman had been in labor twenty-eight\r\nhours, in which ergot had been given by the midwife, in which the\r\nwaters had been discharged and the uterus was tetanically contracted\r\naround its contents, to deliver the child without instrumentation and\r\nwithout further delay. In five minutes the arm (for it was an arm\r\npresentation) began to recede, and in twenty minutes the child was\r\ndelivered, head first, and mother and infant both did well. Other\r\ncases with similar results have been reported by obstetricians quite\r\nas distinguished as Professor King. Many other experienced obstetrical\r\nteachers have expressed themselves to the same purpose in recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostures after Labor.--Allowing changes of position after labor also\r\nhas its advantages. There is often retention of urine and this can be\r\nrelieved by allowing the woman to assume the usual position. It may be\r\nimpossible owing to the swelling and hyperemia in the neighborhood of\r\nher urethra for the woman to pass water, and yet if she is allowed to\r\nsit in the usual position upon a commode, she will in most cases pass\r\nher water in a few minutes without difficulty and the risks attending\r\ncatheterization will be obviated. The power to urinate is due in these\r\ncases partly to the pressure of the thighs upon the abdomen which\r\nhelps the bladder to contract and undoubtedly also to the suggestive\r\ninfluence that the position has.\r\n\r\n{460}\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING\r\n\r\nThe attitude of mind of a woman toward her milk supply is important,\r\nas the flow of milk is closely subject to mental influence. The\r\npresence of the child and the consequent exercise of maternal instinct\r\ndoes more to bring about the prompt, healthy flow of milk than\r\nanything else. Sometimes women in the later months of their first\r\npregnancy upon seeing a mother nursing her child have felt the flow of\r\nmilk to their breasts not rarely with such painful overdistention of\r\nthe milk ducts as to require artificial relief. On the other hand, a\r\nfright may stop the flow of milk or make it scanty and a mother's\r\naversion to a child may prevent her being able to nurse it. The sight\r\nof the father of the child in a state of intoxication may have a\r\nsimilar result.\r\n\r\nHow much milk supply may be dependent on the state of mind, or at\r\nleast the state of the nervous system, can be realized from the\r\nanimals from which we obtain milk. Any serious disturbance is likely\r\nto interfere with the milk supply. When a cow's calf is taken away the\r\nanimal will often refuse for a time to give milk. If a cow is scared,\r\nas by the attack of a wild animal, or by being hit though only\r\nslightly injured by an engine, it will often not have milk for several\r\ndays or even longer. There is an impression prevalent among farmers\r\nthat if a cow takes a dislike to a particular person they are not\r\nlikely to \"give down\" as much milk as would otherwise be the case.\r\nThis may be only a curious farmer tradition, that has no basis in\r\nfact, although it is supported by so many observations reported from\r\nmany different countries that it is apparently to be taken as of\r\nscientific value.\r\n\r\nIn modern times many fashionable women do not nurse their children\r\nbecause they have not the proper supply of milk. It is easy to see how\r\nthis can be brought about through suggestion from many sources and the\r\nsight of others neglecting their duty in this matter. Most fashionable\r\nwomen would rather not nurse their children, and yet many of them feel\r\na bounden duty in the matter. Some of these, however, having heard\r\nthat many mothers of the better class are not capable of nursing their\r\nchildren, easily persuade themselves that they come in this category,\r\nand so their whole attitude of mind toward nursing is one of extreme\r\ndoubt. Knowing as we do how the mental state influences nursing we are\r\nnot surprised when these women prove not to have sufficient milk in\r\nthe early days of the nursing. If they are to have it they must look\r\nforward with confidence to nursing their children and they must be\r\nready and willing to take such food and secure such fresh air as will\r\nput them in the best possible condition for this function, always with\r\nthe thought that nothing can be better for a child than to be nursed\r\nby its own mother. Nature has made exactly the form of food suited for\r\nthe particular child, and it matters not how healthy a wet nurse may\r\nbe, her milk is not likely to be so suitable. Much depends on the\r\nnutrition of the child during this early susceptible period of its\r\nlife and there is more that passes over with the milk than merely the\r\nfood elements. It is well recognized now that the reason why nurslings\r\nare protected from most of the so-called children's diseases and the\r\ncontagious diseases generally, is that, as a rule, their mothers {461}\r\nhave had these diseases, have acquired an immunity to them and this\r\nimmunity is transferred to the child so long as the nursing process is\r\ncontinued. This has been shown to be true over and over again in\r\nanimals and holds good for human beings.\r\n\r\nProfessor Von Leyden, the distinguished professor of medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, points out that we are not quite sure as yet\r\njust what may happen to the human race from the very general refusal\r\nof mothers to nurse their children and the almost universal\r\nsubstitution of the bovine mother; whether in times to come certain\r\nbovine traits, at least as regards susceptibility to disease, may not\r\nbe stamped upon the human race, cannot be determined until this\r\nexperiment in ethnology, now being conducted on so large a scale, has\r\nbeen carried to some definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this view is groundless, but there is no doubt that milk is\r\nmore than merely a food and that during the period after birth when\r\nthe child's nervous system is being formed, the perfectly adapted\r\nmother's milk is more likely to be the proper food than anything that\r\nhuman ingenuity can elaborate. We have heard much in recent years of\r\nthe tendency of education and civilization to lower the birth-rate and\r\nto make women less fitted for maternity and for such maternal duties\r\nas nursing, but stronger than any deterioration of the physical\r\nconstitution by the mental development is the unfortunate unfavorable\r\neffect of mental suggestion upon such functions, by which the\r\npreparation of the organism for their fulfillment is greatly\r\ninfluenced. It is in this respect that the women of to-day differ from\r\nthe woman of the past much more than in mere physical development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMATERNAL IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Maternal impression\" is accepted as a specific designation to signify\r\nthe real or supposed influence of emotion and especially serious\r\ntrouble, which may affect the mother's mind during pregnancy and be\r\ntransferred to the child _in utero_, with the production of\r\ndeformities or mother's marks. There used to be an almost\r\nsuperstitious belief in the power of the maternal impressions to\r\ninfluence unfavorably the child _in utero_. With the newer\r\ndevelopments as to the influence of the subconscious and subliminal\r\nthere might well occur in some minds an exaggeration of these ideas\r\nwith the production of much mental suffering at least, if not of more\r\nserious results.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaternal Impressions in Old Literature.--The belief in the influence\r\nof maternal impression on the child _in utero_ is so strongly fixed\r\nthat to most people it will seem paradoxical to question the whole\r\nsubject. The evidence for it, however, is quite trivial, and none of\r\nit rises above the grade of what may be explained by coincidence. But\r\nthere are many apparently insuperable difficulties, from the\r\nstandpoint of our modern scientific knowledge, with regard to the\r\nwhole subject. If we take up the medical books and the popular\r\nscience, or rather pseudo-science, and the folk stories of a century\r\nago we find overwhelming evidence for the belief in maternal\r\nimpressions. More recent {462} literature has but few examples, and\r\nthe more the details are studied the less is the evidence of any kind\r\nthat the mother's mind influences her unborn child. There is really no\r\nmore reason why a child should he marked within its mother's womb than\r\nthat it should be marked while nursing at the breast if something\r\nshould happen to the mother at that time. This latter effect strikes\r\none at once as absurd; the former, as we shall see, is exactly of the\r\nsame nature.\r\n\r\nMany of the older stories of maternal impressions are reported on no\r\nbetter grounds than the vomiting of snakes and the like, even live\r\nmice, which used to be found in old-time medical literature. It is\r\ntrue that there was usually no such morbidity about the stories of\r\nmaternal impressions, but men wanted to find some explanation for the\r\nproblem of the occurrence of deformities and markings and the maternal\r\nimpression idea seemed satisfactory and inviting by its very mystery.\r\nThe belief that animals could live for some time in human stomachs is\r\nnow relegated to the limbo of old-time credulous traditions. Maternal\r\nimpressions are on the same path and in twenty-five years they will be\r\nas great curiosities in serious medical literature as the gastric\r\nfauna of two generations ago. Under these circumstances prospective\r\nmothers who are anxious over possibilities and who have dreads of all\r\nkinds about their unborn children should be reassured and informed as\r\nto the scientific status of this important question.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother and Child Distinct Beings.--There is no direct connection\r\nbetween the mother and her unborn babe. No nerves run in the cord and\r\nnone pass from the uterine tissues to the placenta. It is easy to\r\nunderstand the influence of mind on body under ordinary circumstances,\r\nat least the mystery has a rational explanation. The central nervous\r\nsystem rules the nutrition of the body. To cut off the nerve supply\r\nhas as serious an effect as to cut off the blood supply. Owing to the\r\nexistence of a chain of neurons, that is, a succession of nervous\r\nelements, instead of one continuous nerve fiber from center to\r\nperiphery, it is possible for one of the neurons of the chain to be so\r\ndisturbed that the conducting apparatus is interrupted and impulses do\r\nnot flow. Hence, if a strong impression is produced on the mind with\r\nregard to a particular part of the body the neurons leading to it may\r\nbe so disturbed that trophic nerve impulses do not flow down, the\r\nblood supply of the part may be disturbed through the vaso-motor\r\nsystem and consequent changes may take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absence of Circulatory Connection_.--Since no nerves pass, as we have\r\nsaid, from mother to babe, disturbances acting on the mother's mind\r\ncan at most only influence the blood supply to the baby. Most people\r\nthink that there is a direct blood supply from mother to child and\r\nthat the mother's blood literally flows in the baby's veins. This is\r\nnot true. The baby's blood is an entirely independent structure,\r\noriginating in the child's own body, and always maintaining a distinct\r\nand quite different composition from that of the mother. The baby's\r\nblood has a higher specific gravity, and it has, in normal condition,\r\nnearly double as many red corpuscles to the cubic millimeter as the\r\nmother's blood. If the blood supply is disturbed by mental influences,\r\nthen it is not the baby's blood nor its circulation that is disturbed,\r\nbut only the circulation through the maternal part of the placenta\r\nwhere an exchange of gases and nutrient elements between mother's and\r\nbaby's blood takes place. It is {463} impossible to conceive that\r\nduring this passage through a membrane of nutrient elements, soluble\r\nproteids, gases, etc., mental influences should also pass over.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposed Examples of Maternal Impression.--The stories that are told\r\nwould lead us to believe that somehow definite changes in the mother\r\nare reproduced in the babe. One case, which in a circle of friends\r\nthat I knew very well made many a convert to the idea of maternal\r\nimpressions, was that of a young woman at whom, during an early stage\r\nof her first pregnancy, her husband playfully threw a tiny frog. He\r\ndid not know that she had a mortal dread of frogs. She was seriously\r\nfrightened and put up her hand to ward off the animal, and as the\r\nclammy thing struck her palm she felt a shiver go through her. When\r\nher baby was born a curious growth that had some pigment in it and\r\nthat, by a stretch of the imagination, might be considered to resemble\r\na frog was in the baby's hand--the same hand, by the way, as that\r\nwhich the mother used to ward off the animal. The lack of any nervous\r\nconnection and of any direct blood connection between mother and child\r\nmakes the story simply absurd as an illustration of maternal\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nIn recent years such stories have come from more and more distant\r\nparts of the country. Kansas was the principal source of them until a\r\ngeneration of great editors arose there. Texas was then their favorite\r\nlocation, but Texas has in recent years become so progressive and so\r\nclosely connected with the rest of the world that, in spite of its\r\nsize, it does not produce so many of these wonders. A generation ago\r\nthe announcement of the birth of six children at once in Austria, or\r\nsomewhere else in Central Europe, would usually be followed by a\r\nreport from Texas announcing seven at a birth. Maternal impression\r\nstories grew luxuriantly for the benefit of the news-gatherer in dull\r\nseasons. A standing type of them is that of the farmer cutting hay on\r\nhis farm who puts his fingers too far into the hay cutter and has them\r\ntaken off. His wife binds up the bleeding stump. She is pregnant at\r\nthe time. When her baby is born--usually two or three months\r\nlater--just the same fingers are missing on the same hand of the\r\nchild. Now the mechanism by which such maternal impression could be\r\ntransferred to the child is incomprehensible. There is no connection\r\nbetween the two, and the old metaphysical axiom (_actio in distans\r\nrepugnat_) that all action between bodies at a distance from one\r\nanother, that is without some connecting link between them, is absurd,\r\nholds as good in modern times as it did in the Middle Ages. Surely a\r\ntendency-to-amputation is not carried over from mother's blood to\r\nbaby's blood through the membrane in the placenta just as are the\r\ngases for respiration and the nutrient elements for food. If it is, we\r\nhave a greater mystery than ever to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod of Occurrence.--The infant in the uterus is fully formed before\r\nthe tenth week of pregnancy and at a time when women are usually\r\nalmost unconscious of the fact that they are pregnant. Such\r\nimpressional changes as we have referred to, if produced after this,\r\nmust be in the nature of backward growth or an inversion of trophic\r\ninfluences or a great perversion of embryonic life. They have nothing\r\nto do with the formation of the child, since that is completed. They\r\nare as much accidents as if the child should fall after it was born.\r\nWe know how fetal limbs are amputated through the formation of\r\namniotic bands, but that maternal impressions should influence the\r\nformation of these bands is of itself ridiculously absurd. That it\r\nshould {464} influence them in a directive and selective way so that\r\ncertain limbs may be amputated at a certain point reaches a climax of\r\nabsurdity. A distinguished physician of our generation once said that\r\none might as well hope to absorb a pencil case in one's vest pocket by\r\nmedicine as to try to bring about absorption of fully formed\r\nconnective tissue by drugs. We cannot think of any mental influence\r\nbringing about such absorption, yet to credit maternal impressions\r\nwith the production of fetal amputations not only supposes the\r\ndirective formation of connective tissue within the uterus, quite\r\nbeyond the domain of the influence of the mother's nervous system, but\r\nalso assumes the direction of the anomalous action of that connective\r\ntissue in its mutilating procedures in a very exact and definite way.\r\n\r\nSome curious things have been explained on the score of maternal\r\nimpressions and it is this very exaggeration that is perhaps the best\r\nproof of how coincidence, imitation, and other factors play a role\r\nthat has exaggerated the idea of maternal impressions into a causative\r\nfactor. A typical illustration is the case cited years ago, half in\r\njoke, perhaps, half in earnest, by a distinguished professor of\r\nobstetrics. It occurred in the days when the elder Sothern was playing\r\nLord Dundreary to crowded houses and when Dundrearyisms were the\r\ncurrent witticisms and Dundreary ties and Dundreary clothes and\r\nDundreary whiskers were all the rage. A young woman who was recently\r\nmarried became much taken with the actor and went to see him over and\r\nover again, secured an introduction to him, and showed the liveliest\r\ninterest in him and the performance. Their acquaintance, however,\r\nremained merely that of chance friends. Some months after it began,\r\nnot more than five or six at the most, a boy was born to her.\r\nAccording to the story this boy, when he began to walk some years\r\nlater, developed that little skip in his gait which proved so taking\r\nto those who crowded the theaters to see Sothern as Lord Dundreary.\r\n\r\nBy this time the play had lost something of its vogue and most people\r\ndid not recognize the curious halt in the gait, but it was very clear\r\nto the mother and her friends. It was set down as due to a maternal\r\nmental impression. Mental transfer seems ludicrous in this case. It is\r\nmuch more likely that the mother was hysterical, and, wishing in a\r\nmorbid way to attract attention to herself and her child, taught the\r\nboy the little skip, or perhaps some curious little skip once taken by\r\nthe child attracted the mother's attention because of her memory of\r\nSothern, and her surprise at the act impressed the peculiar action\r\nupon the boy's mind, who proceeded to attract further attention by\r\nrepeating it. It is cases like this with their _reductio ad absurdum_\r\nof the whole process that have quite discredited the belief in\r\nmaternal impressions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Figures and Coincidences.--The occurrence of mothers' marks in\r\nconnection with various external incidents of pregnancy are only\r\ncoincidences. Most young mothers dread lest something should happen to\r\ntheir children. About once in a thousand times an infant is marked in\r\nsome way. Nine hundred mothers rejoice over the fact that their baby\r\nis not marked in spite of the fact that they feared it might be,\r\nninety-nine of them never gave the matter any thought and one of them\r\nfinds to her sorrow that her foreboding has come true. Occasionally a\r\nmother who has not dreaded such a result finds that her offspring is\r\nmarked. Then she recalls all the happenings of her pregnancy and picks\r\nout something to which she thinks she may attribute the accident.\r\n{465} There must be some reason for it and she finds it. Sometimes she\r\nbegins by saying that it must be because she was frightened at such a\r\ntime, or fell down at such a place, or saw such a thing, and then a\r\nweek later she tells the story with circumstantial additions which\r\nmake it very clear to her friends that she knows exactly the reason\r\nand that she had thought about it before and feared it might be so,\r\nthough the whole matter was hazy until it had been talked over a\r\nnumber of times.\r\n\r\nCoincidences have been the most serious detriment in drawing\r\nscientific conclusions in every department of medicine. Most of our\r\ndiseases are self-limited and any medicine that was given being\r\nfollowed by recovery seemed to be the cause of that recovery and the\r\nmore strictly self-limited a disease the greater the number of\r\nremedies. When stories of maternal impressions are analyzed it is\r\nfound that a great many mothers have had forebodings as to their\r\nchildren being marked and their dreads have not come true. A few have\r\nfeared and have realized their worst fears. Many women whose children\r\nare marked can recall no event in the course of their pregnancy which\r\ncould have marked their child and they ask the doctor what he thinks\r\nmust have been the reason. But unintelligent mothers can always find\r\nsome cause by searching out unpleasant details of their experience\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntrauterine Nutrition and Nursing.--To explain the occurrence of a\r\nfrog-like appearance or a mousey patch on a baby as due to its mother\r\nhaving been frightened by one of these little animals while nursing\r\nwould be the height of absurdity. But it is no more absurd than the\r\nsupposition that mental impressions in the late months of pregnancy\r\ncan have the effects that are popularly ascribed to them. If a mother\r\nsuffers from severe fright, or even if she has a fit of intense anger\r\nor other profound mental disturbance, her milk may disagree with her\r\ninfant. Every physician has seen nursing infants made sick by the\r\nchange in the milk superinduced by strong mental emotions in the\r\nmother. This, however, could have nothing to do with the production of\r\na special lasting physical mark on the outside of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaternal Solicitude and Superstition.--The wonderful stories that are\r\ntold are nearly all in the older literature and are much more\r\nreasonably explained on the score of coincidence than on that of any\r\npossible direct connection of cause and effect. Mothers, then, may be\r\nreassured and made to understand that the better their own health, the\r\nless they worry about their condition, the more likely is their\r\npregnancy to terminate favorably with a perfectly healthy offspring.\r\nThis is the source of so much concern in the little world of\r\nchild-bearing that it is worth while taking it seriously and making\r\nmothers understand that the old notions in this matter are but\r\nsuperstitions. Superstitions are not always nor exclusively religious,\r\nthey are survivals from a previous state of knowledge, the reasons for\r\nwhich are now known to be false. Maternal impression, that is, the\r\nbelief in the power of the mother's mind over the unborn child, is a\r\nsuperstition that we must now dismiss.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Maternal Influences.--Every now and then a sensational\r\nnewspaper has an article on how mothers will tend to make their\r\nchildren physically handsomer by gazing at beautiful works of art,\r\nbeautiful scenes in nature, and seeing only handsome (one feels like\r\ninserting well-dressed in the category, also) people during pregnancy.\r\nThe reading of good books {466} containing moral lessons of the\r\nhighest quality are supposed to have something of the same influence\r\non the child's character. There is no doubt at all that the more\r\ncarefully and simply and beautifully and healthily the mother lives,\r\nand the more her mind possesses itself in peace and happiness, the\r\nbetter will be her own nutrition and consequently that of her\r\noffspring, and, all things considered, this will contribute to the\r\nperfection of the infant's body and so give the best instrument for\r\nthe expression of its soul. That these supposed favorable influences\r\nhave any more direct power than this over the state of the infant that\r\nis to be is doubtful. It is worth trying for, but if the indefinite\r\ninfluence for good emphasizes, as it apparently does in many minds,\r\nthe presumed direct and definite influence for evil, then it is not\r\nworth dwelling on.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology of Deformities.--But if these curious deformities and\r\nmarkings are not due to maternal impressions, what, then, is their\r\ncause? To the question for many of the minor marks and slight\r\ndeformities--naevi vascular and pigmentary, extra fingers, slight\r\novergrowths, special peculiarities of bone and soft tissues--no\r\nsatisfactory answer can be given. We must simply say that as yet we do\r\nnot know. It is a good thing to say we do not know. Long ago Roger\r\nBacon declared that the principal reason why man did not advance in\r\nknowledge more in spite of the amount of their work was that they were\r\nafraid to say \"I do not know,\" and accepted inadequate reasons and\r\ninsufficient authority in order to avoid this humiliating expression.\r\nOn the other hand, there are many deformities and markings, the\r\nreasons for which have been found, and the more important they are the\r\nmore we know about them, as a rule. Besides, with the advance of our\r\nknowledge of embryology we are getting to know more and more about\r\nthese difficult problems and many things that were mysteries before\r\nare now clear. In addition to observation we have experiment and this\r\nis making observation more thoroughly scientific.\r\n\r\nThe more we know of the intricacies of the development of animals and\r\nhuman beings, the greater is our surprise that deformities do not\r\noccur even more commonly than they do. All the openings of the human\r\nas of the animal body gradually close in with the production of the\r\nfinished form. The slightest interference with growth in the\r\nneighborhood of these openings, which involve nearly all of the front\r\nof the body, leaves various deformities. Nature has surrounded the\r\ndeveloping embryo with fluid so that it is saved from jars of all\r\nkinds and from contact with other tissues that would disturb growth.\r\nCell is laid on cell as brick is laid on brick in the building of a\r\nhouse, and the predetermined plan in the immense majority of cases is\r\nfollowed without accident to the minutest detail. That more mishaps do\r\nnot occur, considering the delicacy of the process and the perfection\r\nof the finished structure, is hard to understand.\r\n\r\nThere are many factors likely to intrude in every pregnancy that may\r\nlead to the production of unfortunate results. Literally millions of\r\ncells are growing with apparent freedom from constraint in many\r\nportions of the fetus, yet all are directed with definite purpose\r\ncorresponding to other cells and are destined to meet in due course of\r\ntime. Each one of them or at least each group seems to be independent\r\nin its growth. Each growing cell doubles by dividing every few hours,\r\nyet all are co-ordinated to a definite end. We admire the men who\r\nbegin at the two ends of a tunnel far distant from one another and\r\nwork without any communication except through the engineer's plans\r\n{467} made long before, and yet make two bores that can be depended on\r\nto meet with but a few inches of divergence. The bridges of tissue\r\nthat are built across the openings of the body jut out to meet one\r\nanother in this way and in more than ninety-nine out of every one\r\nhundred cases there is not the slightest divergence. Many things may\r\noccur to disturb conditions--not connected with mental influences, but\r\nwith distinctly physical factors--missteps, trips, jars on stairs or\r\ngetting off and on cars, on the sidewalk, etc. These, and not the\r\nmythical factors that make up so-called maternal impressions, are the\r\ncauses of deformities and mothers' marks.\r\n\r\n\r\n{468}\r\n\r\nSECTION XII\r\n\r\n\r\n_GENITO-URINARY DISEASES_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPROSTATISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem impossible to include prostatic hypertrophy, or the train\r\nof symptoms connected with it, among those affections likely to be\r\nbenefited by mental treatment. The history of this affection, however,\r\nand especially of its treatment in recent years since it has come to\r\nbe the subject of special study, has furnished many examples of the\r\nvalue of suggestion in the relief of many of its symptoms. Many forms\r\nof treatment have been exploited for a time, attracting attention\r\nbecause of the cures attributed to them, and have then been relegated\r\nto the limbo of unsuccessful remedial measures. A striking example of\r\nthe place of suggestion came with the development of organo-therapy\r\nsome fifteen years ago. The succession of events illustrated well how\r\nmuch persuasion and a favorable attitude of mind might mean even in so\r\npurely physical an affection as interference with urination by\r\nenlargement of the prostate.\r\n\r\nIt was at a time when thyroid medication for myxedema having proved\r\nsuccessful the medical journals were full of reports of other\r\nsuccessful phases of organo-therapy. The spleen and the bone marrow\r\nwere being used in the anemias, the ductless glands in various\r\nnutritional diseases and even extract of heart for heart disease. Just\r\non what general principle it was assumed by some German investigator\r\nthat possibly extract of prostate from animals might be of benefit in\r\nthe treatment of prostatic hypertrophy is hard to understand. The\r\nGerman physician, however, gave an order to the butcher to send him\r\nprostates and as furnished they were administered to the patients. A\r\nnumber of patients began at once to improve on the treatment. They\r\nwere able to empty their bladders much better than before, the\r\nresidual urine was decreased, the tendency to fermentation was\r\ndiminished and, above all, the patients' general symptoms were much\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe success was so marked that the German investigator published his\r\ncases and, with the public mind interested in organotherapy, they\r\nattracted wide-spread attention. He was asked how to obtain the\r\nmaterial and only then did he take the trouble to investigate just\r\nwhat the butcher had been sending him. The description furnished the\r\nbutcher by the doctor was that he wanted an organ lying below and\r\nsomewhat in front of the bladder of the bull. It was found on careful\r\ninquiry that the abattoir attendants following these directions had\r\nsupplied not prostates but seminal vesicles. As soon as this was found\r\nout some of the therapeutic suggestions failed. A number of cases,\r\n{469} however, continued to improve. German medical journals made fun\r\nof the whole proceeding and most people will consider the ridicule\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nShortly before this time, however, we had had a very similar\r\nexperience with another pair of organs. In spite of the fact that\r\nwhatever we know about Graves' disease would seem to indicate that\r\nthat affection is due to an increased thyroid secretion in the system,\r\nat the time of the organo-therapeutic fads, thyroid extract was\r\nreported as having been used successfully in the treatment of this\r\naffection. The name signed to the report was that of a trustworthy\r\nEnglish clinical observer. A few practitioners of medicine got similar\r\nresults, but most of them failed entirely to get his successes and\r\nsome of them were sure that their patients were rather harmed than\r\nhelped by the new medication. An investigation of just what material\r\nwas being employed in the English cases showed that the butcher was\r\nsupplying thymus and not thyroid glands. Suggestion did the rest, for\r\nthymus has proved to be quite ineffective, and the treatment was\r\nentirely expectant but acted on a favorable state of mind. Anyone who\r\nhas had much experience with Graves' disease knows how amenable to\r\nsuggestion the patients are. It would seem evident from the foregoing\r\nstory of organo-therapy for prostatic hypertrophy that sufferers from\r\nprostatism are probably as prone to suggestion as patients with\r\nGraves' disease. This is all the more surprising as the two affections\r\nare so different in their etiology. Graves' disease being undoubtedly\r\na ductless gland disease, while prostatism is due entirely to\r\nmechanical obstruction.\r\n\r\nWe have abundant additional evidence of the role of psychotherapy in\r\nprostatism. Some years ago a well-known American surgeon suggested\r\nthat removal of the testicles would reduce the enlarged prostates. And\r\nmuch improvement was seen after castration in those who previously\r\nsuffered from prostatism. The subject was carefully studied.\r\nExperiments were made on animals and the results seemed to prove that\r\ncastration in them constantly produced prostatic atrophy. The fallacy\r\nprobably came from the fact that at the time so little was known about\r\nthe prostate in comparative anatomy and, above all, with regard to the\r\nprostate in dogs, that it was impossible to come to any sure\r\nconclusion as to reduction in weight and size after removal of the\r\ntesticles. A number of prostatic cases were treated by different\r\nsurgeons and with excellent results. Then after a time the number of\r\nsupposed successes dwindled or proved to be failures and now no one\r\ndoes the operation. The only explanation that is at all satisfactory\r\nin these cases, is that the rest in the hospital, the favorable\r\nsuggestion of reported cures and of an experimental demonstration on\r\nanimals led many patients, some of them even physicians, to secure a\r\nbetter control over their bladders.\r\n\r\nIt took a good deal of persuasion as a rule to bring men, even men\r\nwell beyond seventy, to consent to the sacrifice of their testicles,\r\nbut once they did, the sacrifice brought a favorable suggestion to\r\nwork and so it was not long before they were able to make their\r\nbladder act much more efficiently against the obstacles presented to\r\nits contraction. Some could be persuaded more easily to sacrifice a\r\nsingle testicle, but in these cases the mental influence was less and\r\nthe reported cures fewer. After a time the operation of vasectomy was\r\nsuggested as a substitute for the removal of the testicles. For a time\r\neven this in the hands of certain operators gave excellent results.\r\nAlmost any other operation in the genito-urinary tract performed with\r\nthe definite persuasion {470} on the part of the patient that he would\r\nbe better after it would probably have acted just as favorably. The\r\nwhole story of these series of incidents in the surgery of the last\r\ndecade of the nineteenth century ought to be a clear demonstration of\r\nhow valuable for therapeutic purposes is mental influence oven in\r\nprostatism, and how much we should try to secure its favorable\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion.--Since enlargement of the prostate has become\r\na familiar subject of discussion and men know and hear much about it\r\nevery now and then, one has to reassure a man but little beyond fifty\r\nthat he is not suffering from this affection. Just as soon as a man\r\nbegins to urinate frequently during the day and to have to got up once\r\nat night he begins to wonder how soon he will be likely to suffer from\r\nfurther symptoms of enlarged prostate. If he is of the nervous kind\r\nhis worrying will soon give him additional symptoms that will confirm\r\nhis suspicions. Probably one of the most familiar of phenomena, even\r\nto the non-medical man, is the ease with which worry and excitement\r\ncauses frequent urination. Probably no system of organs in the body is\r\nso likely to be disturbed by the mind as the urinary system with the\r\nexception, of course, of the allied tract, the genital system, but the\r\ntwo are so one in union and sympathy that they cannot be separated in\r\npractice. The prostate is rather a genital than a urinary organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urinary Worries_.--When a man begins to worry about the possibility\r\nof bother from enlarged prostate and recalls that frequent urination\r\nis one of the symptoms of it, it will not be long before this symptom\r\ndevelops. Occasionally his first wakings to urinate at night or in the\r\nearly morning are only due to passing conditions, either he drank\r\nfreely shortly before bedtime or perhaps he did not drink enough. In\r\nthe one case the bladder is rather full; in the other a concentrated\r\nurine, especially with the patient lying on his back, makes itself\r\nfelt over the sensitive area at the base of the bladder, waking him\r\nup. The rest of the symptoms may develop as a consequence of\r\nsolicitude over a few such incidents.\r\n\r\nPractically all men who reach sixty have some tendency to more\r\nfrequent urination than before. Their bladder does not hold as much\r\nfluid with comfort and they are likely to have to get up in the early\r\nmorning. This does not necessarily mean any enlargement of the\r\nprostate nor any pathological change. The physiological change that\r\ntakes place seems to be rather conservative than otherwise. Old\r\nmuscles are less capable of extension and thorough reaction than they\r\nwere earlier in life and in order that the bladder may not be\r\nover-distended nature makes it more sensitive than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Emptying the Bladder_.--In the study of these cases individual\r\npeculiarities in the emptying of the bladder must be remembered. There\r\nare some men who cannot urinate if anyone is near them, and who even\r\nhave to step into a closed toilet if they are to succeed in emptying\r\ntheir bladders when others are in the room. Some who find no\r\ndifficulty in the presence of others in open urinals find it difficult\r\nor impossible to urinate when it is expected of them. Under worry and\r\nexcitement urination may become urgent or imperative, but on the other\r\nhand some men find it very difficult to empty their bladders under an\r\nemotional strain. Now that much more is written publicly with regard\r\nto symptoms from enlarged prostate and much more is heard of the\r\naffection, many old men got worried and lose some of the power that\r\nthey had over their bladder before, not so much because of their\r\nenlarged prostate as from the {471} psychic loss of control over their\r\nbladder. The viscus consists of a series of muscles, the fibres of\r\nwhich must be rather nicely coordinated and controlled in order to\r\nsecure that complete contraction necessary for thorough emptying. A\r\ncertain amount of residual urine occurs occasionally at least in many\r\nother persons besides those who have prostatic obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Question of Operation_.--In recent years there has been a\r\ntendency to suggest operation even on comparatively small prostates\r\nwhen symptoms referable to them are noted. Operations on the prostate\r\nhave become much more easy and successful, and there has been the same\r\nsort of feeling about them among surgeons as there was when operations\r\nfor affections, real or supposed, of the ovaries came into general\r\nvogue twenty years ago. I have seen patients in whom an operation for\r\nthe removal of the prostate had been suggested, though the only\r\nsymptoms were somewhat increased frequency of urination during the day\r\nand the necessity for rising two or three times at night. Such a\r\nsuggestion, by calling the patient's attention strongly to his\r\ncondition, emphasizes the irritability of the vesical tissues and is\r\nalmost sure to bring about a considerable increase in the symptoms.\r\nThe first principle of any treatment of irritability of the bladder\r\nshould be the setting of the patient's mind as free as possible from\r\nsolicitude. Any over-attention is sure to lead to reflexes and often\r\nto what seems to be even imperative urination, though with a little\r\ncare and discipline much can be done for the relief of such symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for operation must be judged entirely from the symptoms\r\nof the individual patient and not from any hard and fast rule with\r\nregard to the size of the prostate. Prostates are eminently individual\r\norgans, at least as individual as the human nose, and their projection\r\ninto the rectum is dependent on the relations of other tissues in the\r\nneighborhood as well as on mere size. Men have been known to live with\r\ncomparatively few or no symptoms for many years, though at autopsy\r\nthey proved to have what would ordinarily be considered a\r\npathologically enlarged prostate.\r\n\r\nOperations upon the prostate are valuable and indeed often afford the\r\nonly avenue of relief from an intolerable condition. The results are\r\nnot so encouraging in all cases, however, as to make recourse to\r\noperation advisable until a thorough trial of palliative measures has\r\nbeen made. It is surprising how often the confident suggestion of\r\nassured relief when accompanied by the same amount of rest in bed and\r\nthe special care that is required for an operation, brings about a\r\ndisappearance of symptoms that seemed inevitably to demand surgical\r\nintervention. There may be much residual urine, there may even be, as\r\na consequence of this, some fermentation with cystitis, and yet a\r\ncourse of rather simple remedial measures may serve to bring about a\r\nperiod of prolonged freedom from vesical symptoms. If these patients,\r\nhowever, have heard much of the trials and sufferings of a catheter\r\nlife, the solicitude aroused with regard to their condition is\r\nsufficient of itself to disturb their urination to a marked degree.\r\nUnfavorable suggestion is particularly serious in its effects in these\r\ncases, while favorable suggestion frequently repeated will enable the\r\npatient very often to regain bladder control when the developments\r\npresent might seem to put that almost out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition Suggestions.--An important suggestion for treatment in\r\nprostatism with residual urine seems to be to teach the patient to\r\nurinate lying down, {472} especially with the hips somewhat elevated.\r\nThis seems to be the element that proved capable of making many\r\ndifferent operations, castration, the removal of one testicle,\r\nvasectomy, and other suggestions appear curative. My own experience is\r\ntoo limited to make my opinion of much weight; but I have seen certain\r\npatients greatly relieved of prostatic symptoms and their residual\r\nurine much diminished by the advice to urinate leaning well out of\r\nbed, lying prone with the head lower than the body. A small stool is\r\nbrought to the side of the bed, a pillow placed on it and the patient\r\nleans over face down on this with the shoulders considerably lower\r\nthan the pelvis. This allows gravity to assist rather than hamper the\r\nemptying of the bladder and after men have become a little used to it\r\nthey are quite satisfied to take the trouble. Personally I feel sure\r\nthat more generally applied this would put off the necessity for using\r\na catheter a good deal and even save some cases from operation that\r\nnow seem to need it. The principle is exactly the same as that by\r\nwhich patients suffering from bronchiectasis avail themselves of the\r\nhelp of gravity and get rid of the nocturnal accumulation of material\r\nin their dilated bronchi. They can thus be saved much trouble and\r\nexhausting effort.\r\n\r\nSo much, as we have said, is written in recent years with regard to\r\nprostatic symptoms that a body of unfavorable suggestion has been\r\ncreated. This must be neutralized as far as possible by calling the\r\nattention of patients who have initial symptoms of vesical disturbance\r\nto the ease with which mental influences act upon the urinary\r\nfunctions. Solicitude and anxiety will add to symptoms and may even\r\nbring about their continuance when the original, local and passing\r\ncondition which has caused them has ceased. Very often if the\r\npatient's mind can be properly disposed a marked relief of symptoms\r\nwill follow, especially if, at the same time, remedial measures of\r\nother kinds are employed to lessen the irritation that is being set\r\nup. While prostatism seems to be due to such purely mechanical\r\ndifficulties that mental influences can mean very little, the history\r\nof the therapeutics of the condition for the last twenty years shows\r\nus clearly that if strong mental influences are aroused they bring so\r\nmuch relief that many patients consider themselves cured. This\r\npsychotherapy will not do away with the necessity for operation in\r\nmany cases, but it will cure many of the sufferers from milder\r\nsymptoms and will in not a few cases bring such relief as will prepare\r\nthe patients to undergo operation, if it should be necessary, with\r\nmore assurance of favorable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSEXUAL NEUROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything that disturbs the sexual sphere in either sex, no matter how\r\ntrivial it may be, becomes a source of worry and depression quite\r\nbeyond its real importance. It is not unusual for men and women to\r\nbecome so worried over some trifling affection of their sexual organs\r\nthat they become convinced that serious pathological conditions are\r\ndeveloping and that there is little hope of anything like a complete\r\ncure. This is particularly true of young patients, but holds also for\r\nthose of older years. Slight discomforts are exaggerated into nagging\r\naches and pains which produce extreme depression of spirits.\r\n\r\n{473}\r\n\r\nIt is important, then, for the physician to recognize this and to\r\ntreat the patient's mind by reassurance while conducting whatever\r\nother therapeutics may be required. There is danger always in these\r\ncases of either making too little or too much of the affection. If too\r\nmuch is made of it, an unfavorable influence is produced in the\r\npatient's mind and the discouragement leads to so much inhibition or\r\neven actual physical disturbance that the affection will not improve.\r\nIf too little is made of it, patients get discouraged and are prone to\r\nthink that the physician does not understand their cases. Then they go\r\nto the advertising specialist in men's diseases who works upon their\r\nfears and makes them feel much worse than before, though in the end he\r\nmay lift the cloud of anxiety from their minds and pretend to have\r\ncured them. He always leaves them, however, with the impression that\r\nsomething serious has been the matter, and this acts as a nightmare\r\nand a source of dread in after time.\r\n\r\nIn men the unfavorable suggestions occur particularly as a consequence\r\nof affections of the external organs. In women the same suggestions\r\nare likely to make themselves felt with regard to the internal genital\r\norgans. We all recognize the exaggeration of feeling and even physical\r\nreaction that takes place with regard to slight sexual ailments in the\r\nmale, because it is easy to recognize just exactly what pathological\r\nconditions are present and how trivial they may be and yet produce\r\nserious depression and all kinds of symptoms, reflexly referred to\r\nmany other organs. There is a tendency to listen to the complaints\r\nfrom women more seriously because the actual pathological condition\r\ncannot be determined and there is always the fear that some serious\r\naffection may be at work. It must not be forgotten, however, that the\r\ncomplaints of pains and aches, the disturbance of sleep, of digestion\r\nand of the intestinal function, the mental and physical lassitude and\r\nthe over-reaction to irritation which occur in both sexes as a\r\nconsequence of sexual affections may be due entirely to mental\r\nsolicitude and not to any real pathological change.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrivial Afflictions--Varicocele.--It is curious what a little thing\r\nwill sometimes set off the explosion of a train of sexual symptoms.\r\nEvery physician has probably had some young man come to him with the\r\nlook and the tone that there was something the matter that he knew was\r\nserious and would affect all his after life. The patient then goes on\r\nto say that he wants to know all and is brave enough to face it, and,\r\nthough he has lost sleep for two or three nights and is not looking\r\nwell for the present moment because his health has been disturbed by\r\nthe loss of sleep, still he has the strength to know the worst and it\r\nis to be told him and he will bravely battle on in spite of the\r\nsuffering that must come. Or he will submit to a serious operation if\r\nit is necessary for his relief. With a prelude like this, the\r\ninexperienced physician might expect strangulated hernia or some\r\npreliminary symptoms of brain tumor, but what he usually finds is a\r\nvaricocele, and a small one at that. By chance the patient has\r\ndiscovered it and slept none the following night, went round in an\r\nagony of dread next day meaning to go to a physician, but too fearful\r\nto be told the worst, losing another night's sleep and then finally\r\ncoming to a friend to be told all the ill that is in store for him.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for alarm in these cases; they merely illustrate the\r\nrole of the mind disturbing the body. Nearly one-fourth of the male\r\nworld carries its {474} varicocele around with it and never bothers\r\nabout it. A few sensitive individuals are annoyed by a sense of weight\r\nand a feeling of distention from congestion in connection with it. In\r\na few, because of special pathological conditions or congenital\r\ndefects, the varicocele becomes so large that it has to be supported\r\nby a special bandage. In people who ride horseback, in athletes, and\r\nthose who indulge in severe exercise, this sort of a bandage may be\r\nnecessary or at least may make the wearer more comfortable even in\r\nslighter forms of the affection. Severe cases may be much relieved by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn first discovery of his varicocele nearly every young man, because\r\nof concentration of attention on it, is so much annoyed that he thinks\r\nhe must wear a bandage. After a time, however, he often finds that the\r\nbandage itself is a source of more annoyance than the varicocele, and\r\nthen he learns to forget it and its feelings--and that is all about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this succession of events that takes place so often\r\nwith regard to varicocele, because it is typical of the effect that an\r\naffection of the sexual organs has upon the mind. It exerts an\r\nunfavorable influence entirely disproportionate to the physical cause\r\nthat is at work. If, as sometimes happens, a young man hesitates to\r\nconfide in some one capable of undeceiving him with regard to the\r\nsupposed significance of his affection, he may work himself into a\r\ndecided nervous condition and lose much weight before he discovers his\r\nmistake. This physical running down confirms his exaggerated notion of\r\nthe significance of the affection. He is sure that it constitutes the\r\nreason why he is losing weight and declining in health and he rather\r\ncongratulates himself on the fact that he discovered the cause so\r\nshortly before the serious effects began.\r\n\r\nIf under these conditions he places himself in the hands of any of the\r\nmen who advertise themselves as curing \"men's diseases,\" or as\r\nrelieving the \"awful\" symptoms that are likely to follow varicocele,\r\ninstead of being reassured he will be told that he has come just in\r\ntime and that while his cure will require a long time and will cost a\r\ngreat deal of money, yet it can surely be effected. In nothing can men\r\nor women be more easily imposed upon than with regard to affections\r\ninvolving their sex organs. They lose their power of judgment and\r\ntheir control over their feelings and so plunge sometimes into\r\nprofound depression. Every year we have a number of suicides among\r\nyoung men, the most important element in whose depression is due to\r\nunrelieved occupation of mind with the thought that they are suffering\r\nfrom some incurable sexual disease which will unsex them, and that\r\neven death is to be preferred to the alternative of being recognized\r\ngenerally--as they are sure they will be--as sexual defectives.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these young men are suffering from only some slight ailment\r\nthat could be easily cured if they were frank about their state of\r\nmind and described their symptoms to a reputable physician. Oftener\r\nthan not their supposed ailment is something so common as to be of no\r\nsignificance, so far as any serious results may possibly be\r\nanticipated, and their only real ailment is the mental condition which\r\nhas developed because of concentration of mind on this one phase of\r\norganic life and the consequent inevitable exaggeration of symptoms\r\nand feelings. It is sometimes not easy to disabuse them of their\r\nunfortunate notions, but there is probably no set of cases in medicine\r\nwhere psychotherapeutics means more than it does with regard to the\r\ncurious {475} neurotic and psychic conditions which develop in those\r\nwho are suffering from any sexual ailment, real or imaginary.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Prepuce.--Much has been said in recent years about the influence\r\nof a long prepuce in the male in producing various reflexes the\r\neffects of which may be seen in serious disturbance of even distant\r\norgans. The kidneys are sometimes said to be thus reflexly affected,\r\nand occasionally the digestion and the bowels--even, sometimes, mental\r\nprocesses are said to be influenced unfavorably by the diffusion of\r\nreflexes from the irritation consequent upon this sensitive structure\r\nbeing too long. A whole system of nosology exists in some minds due to\r\nan over-long prepuce. There are, of course, cases in which\r\ncircumcision should be performed. There is a larger number of others,\r\nhowever, in which the redundant prepuce is neither adherent nor\r\nconstricted and is only slightly longer than it should be.\r\nOccasionally something arouses the attention of the possessor of the\r\nredundant tissue and he gets the idea that it is the source of reflex\r\nirritation even for distant parts of his organism. It is an\r\ninteresting study in suggestion to see how symptoms develop in various\r\norgans as a consequence of the cultivation of this thought. Urination\r\nbecomes frequent, the patient even wakes at night to urinate and the\r\nurine, as in many neuroses, becomes more abundant and of lower\r\nspecific gravity--the typical nervous urine of the hysterical, and\r\nthere may be much worry and emotional disturbance.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms, however, are not effects of the long prepuce, but are\r\nresults of the neurotic influence of concentration of mind on it. It\r\nwill often be advisable, in young men particularly, to have\r\ncircumcision performed, but in most cases this is unnecessary, and if\r\nthe patient can be made to understand how the symptoms have developed\r\nhe will learn a precious lesson in not interfering with his functions\r\nby over-attention to them. Of course, there are many surgeons who will\r\ncontinue to hold, as they seem to now, that nature was quite at fault\r\nin the production of this organ and that it should be removed in\r\nnearly every human being. The majority of men, however, have lived\r\ntheir lives quite well and happily without such intervention and there\r\nare certain inconveniences attached to the condition which remains\r\nafter operation that may in their way be quite as bothersome as the\r\nsymptoms due to the long foreskin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychic Impotence.--An important sexual neurosis, at least in the eyes\r\nof sufferers from it, is what physicians have come to know as psychic\r\nimpotence. Young married men, because of over-anxiety with regard to\r\nthemselves for a number of reasons, but without any physical factor to\r\ndisturb them, find it impossible to complete the sexual act. Naturally\r\nthis creates a serious disturbance of mind. The patient will either\r\nhurry to a physician at some place on his wedding tour, or his wedding\r\ntour will be shortened and he will return to consult a friend. He\r\npresents a lively picture of despair. He has not been sleeping, his\r\nappetite is disturbed, he feels lassitude and weakness, and if he has\r\na lively imagination he is inclined to think that the fatal\r\ntermination of some serious nervous disease of which he has heard, and\r\nwhich is accompanied by the symptom of sexual impotence, is impending\r\nover him. His condition is quite pitiable, though largely imaginary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reassurance_.--The treatment of the condition is not so difficult as\r\nit might seem if the patient has a reasonable confidence in his\r\nphysician. If he {476} goes to an advertising \"specialist,\" as\r\noccasionally happens, because he concludes that the ordinary physician\r\ncannot know all the details of these intricately complex nervous\r\ndiseases, he is sure to suffer severely in general health before cure\r\nis obtained. His morbid ideas will be fostered because he is ready to\r\npay any amount of money in order to stop the progress of the presumed\r\nserious disease. An investigation of these \"specialists\" in New York,\r\nmade a few years ago by a committee of the New York County Medical\r\nSociety, showed to what an extent the terrors of these unfortunate\r\npatients are exploited for monetary reasons.\r\n\r\nA physician of even a little experience in these matters, however,\r\nrecognizes at once the entirely neurotic character of the case and by\r\nreassurance soon enables the young man to dispel many of his worst\r\nterrors. His general health can be regulated, his constipation, which\r\nso frequently exists, is relieved, and he can be told, what is very\r\ntrue, that the excitement consequent upon the preparations for his\r\nwedding and the exhaustion due to the overwork so frequently necessary\r\nin order to enable him to take the time off for his wedding journey,\r\nhave made him so nervously irritable that the ordinary mechanism of\r\nthe sexual act, which is extremely delicate and requires nice\r\nco-ordination for proper function, has been disturbed. Just as soon as\r\nthis fatigue and the over-excitement of mind consequent upon the\r\nunfortunate experience are mitigated his potency will return. This\r\nassurance can be given almost at once.\r\n\r\nHis fears, however, will delay his recovery. His dread of incapacity\r\nwill become an obsession. Probably the most effective means of\r\ntreating this is to forbid him to attempt the sexual act for a\r\ndefinite length of time, say two or three weeks. This must be\r\nimpressed upon him. There is a good reason for insisting that he shall\r\nnot irritate his already excited sexual system by such attempts.\r\nUsually at the end of a week or ten days he will come back with a\r\nsmiling look of confidence in himself and his physician, to confess\r\nthat he has violated the injunction, but that he was not disappointed\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subconscious Obsession_.--In most of these cases the young men have\r\nbeen victims of sex habits of some kind or of drug addictions, and\r\nthey have heard that occasionally individuals who have had such\r\nexperiences may suffer from sexual impotence later in life. This is a\r\nstrong suggestion to them and in some cases becomes a haunting\r\nobsession, and produces the unfavorable effect upon the organism. It\r\nis necessary to remove this obsession before a cure can be effected.\r\nThe patient's confidence must be obtained and the physician's\r\npersonality and persuasive powers used to change his point of view.\r\nOccasionally I have seen cases in which the patients themselves seem\r\nto be scarcely aware of this strong suggestion or obsession at work in\r\nthem. It seemed to be more or less subconscious. An idea with regard\r\nto the evil effects of the old habit had been implanted and remained\r\nin their minds, occasionally making itself felt but more often\r\napparently lying dormant. In these cases it is important that the\r\nphysician should make this underlying factor clear to the patient. In\r\nsome of these cases hypnosis is necessary. Usually the hypnoidal\r\ncondition, with suggestions in the waking state, is all that is\r\nnecessary and ordinary suggestions will often effect the purpose\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganic Impotence.--Certain forms of sexual impotence are really\r\npreliminary signs of serious organic nervous disease. Sometimes it is\r\nthe first {477} symptom of paresis or of locomotor ataxia. Oftener it\r\nis a very early symptom of syphilitic spinal myelitis. In practically\r\nall of these cases, however, there is a history of syphilis and the\r\npresence of this should always be a warning not to think of functional\r\nor psychic impotence until the possible influence of the syphilis\r\nitself or of some of the parasyphilitic diseases is thoroughly\r\nexcluded. Unfortunately, not a few people who have had syphilis are\r\nnervous and anxious about themselves and by their very anticipation of\r\npossible developments may auto-suggest themselves into a state in\r\nwhich these symptoms will develop. It is cases of neurasthenia that\r\ndevelop after secondary syphilis in persons who have been studying\r\nsyphilis and its possible effects, which present the most difficult\r\nproblems in diagnosis that come to the nerve specialist. Many\r\nsimulated symptoms are unconsciously developed and this makes\r\ndifferential diagnosis extremely hard. As a rule, the psychic\r\nimpotence is merely functional and patients need reassurance more than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nNocturnal Emissions.--One of the sexual neuroses that gives rise to a\r\nhigh degree of solicitude centers around the question of involuntary\r\nseminal emissions. Young men who are living normal healthy lives and\r\nwho are in robust health with no indulgence of sexuality are likely to\r\nexperience more or less regular involuntary emissions. If for any\r\nreason they become nervous or anxious about their sexual functions,\r\nespecially at times when they are under much mental strain, these\r\nphenomena of emptying the seminal vesicles may occur rather\r\nfrequently. If they have been reading some of the literature, or\r\nhearing some of the exaggerated notions that are often expressed with\r\nregard to the evil effects that may come from this, they are likely to\r\nsuffer much mental anxiety over it. Occasionally they lose sleep,\r\nfrequently they feel so wearied and worried the day after the\r\noccurrence as to be disturbed at their work, sometimes they are sure\r\nthey are so tired that they are unable to fulfill their ordinary\r\nduties, and I suppose every physician has known young men who were\r\neven sure that the loss of the seminal fluid was seriously interfering\r\nwith health, hampering many physical functions and bringing them to an\r\nuntimely grave. They had no appetite and in consequence of not eating\r\nenough they were constipated and then a whole round of physical\r\ntroubles, headache, lassitude, over-fatigue, to which they are almost\r\nsure to add loss or disturbance of memory, began to annoy them.\r\n\r\nIn those cases it is not the physical effect of any loss of seminal\r\nfluid that is the disturbing factor of their health, but their worry\r\nover the losses. Just as soon as their minds can be taken off the\r\nsubject, the supposed physical effects begin to disappear. So long as\r\nthe solicitude continues the emissions themselves increase in number\r\nand the condition is made worse. These patients must be taught that in\r\nevery normal healthy man in whom there is no regular occasion for the\r\nemptying of the seminal vesicles, nature provides for an evacuation\r\nabout every ten days or two weeks. In some it is more frequent than\r\nthis. In those who are much indoors and in whom oxidation processes\r\nare low this emptying takes place more frequently. In those who lead a\r\nsedentary life with the consumption of much proteid food the same\r\nthing seems to be true. Any anxiety about it is sure to cause frequent\r\nrepetition of the evacuation processes. Over-solicitude about the\r\nbladder will have just the same effect. If the patient will take his\r\nmind off the subject, will eat normally, will get out in the air more\r\nthan before, tiring himself thoroughly {478} if he is young and\r\nvigorous, and will not allow the sexual side of his being to be\r\nexcited by stories or pictures, plays or voluntary thoughts, his\r\naffliction will soon disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis_.--Certain directions are helpful and by occupying the\r\npatient's mind will overcome certain physical factors that underlie\r\nthe affection. It is important that the bladder should not be allowed\r\nto be full, above all, not to be over-distended at night. Some care\r\nshould be exercised in not taking too much to drink shortly before\r\ngoing to bed and the bladder should be faithfully emptied before\r\nretiring. The weight of a large amount of urine in the bladder\r\npressing down upon the seminal vesicles situated below and behind it\r\ncauses them to contract rather easily. This is particularly true if\r\nthe patient sleeps on his back and occasionally in certain\r\nover-irritable patients for a time at least an arrangement may have to\r\nbe made by means of small pillows that will prevent him from sleeping\r\non his back. On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that too\r\ngreat abstinence from fluid will cause the urine to be more\r\nconcentrated and this will irritate the bladder and either wake the\r\npatient up at night, which of itself is undesirable, or else will\r\ncause congestion in the prostatic region which will irritate the\r\nseminal vesicles to the point of evacuation. While five or six glasses\r\nof water a day should be taken besides the ordinary fluid taken at\r\nmeals, the only regulation necessary is of the amount of fluid taken\r\nin the evening after the last meal, that is, if more than three hours\r\nintervene before retiring for the night.\r\n\r\nBesides the physical conditions in the bladder, an accumulation of\r\nfecal material in the rectum may cause irritation of the seminal\r\nvesicles. It is important, moreover, to remember that thoroughly free\r\nmovements of the bowels, by preventing to a great extent the\r\nreabsorption of material from the intestines which may prove irritant\r\nwhen excreted through the kidneys and when present in the bladder, is\r\nof itself an excellent therapeutic measure in cases of irritability of\r\nthe genital organs. The setting of the patient's mind to thinking\r\nabout his rectum, his bowels, and his bladder instead of his genital\r\ntract is an excellent psychotherapeutic measure that will soon bear\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of various foods, condiments and drinks enters into\r\nthe underlying condition which produces frequent emissions. We have\r\nalready suggested that the use of a large amount of proteid materials,\r\nespecially in people who live a sedentary life, often predisposes to\r\nthis condition. An abundance of the carbohydrates, however, by\r\nsupplying more heat than is necessary may have a like effect. Certain\r\nspices seem to predispose to irritability of the sexual system. Red\r\npepper has always seemed to those who saw much of these cases to be\r\nparticularly at fault. Mustard, curries, peppers generally, however,\r\nand even other spices seem to have a corresponding effect. As a rule,\r\nyoung folks suffering from this disturbance or from the tendency to\r\neroticism in other ways should be warned about this irritation of\r\nspices. In neurotic individuals tea and especially coffee has the same\r\neffect. Probably this is only an indirect influence of tea upon the\r\nnerve centers, making them more irritable, but coffee, by raising the\r\nblood pressure, seems to have a direct unfavorable effect.\r\n\r\nAll alcoholic drinks are contraindicated in these cases and must be\r\nforbidden. Certain of them seem to be more harmful than others.\r\nAccording to French tradition warm wine or mulled ale as it is used in\r\nEngland is {479} especially likely to excite sexuality. Warm alcoholic\r\ndrinks of any kind are absorbed more rapidly than are cool drinks,\r\nwhich is the main reason in modern times for having these liquids\r\ncooled so that they will not be absorbed too rapidly and disturb the\r\nequilibrium. Champagne also has, by tradition, a special effect,\r\nsometimes said to be due to the increased hyperemia of the stomach\r\ninduced by the carbonic acid gas and the consequent more rapid\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of spices and alcoholic drinks has a good effect in\r\nitself. It acts constantly as a suggestion to the necessity for care\r\nand guard over one's self. Besides the exercise of self-denial\r\nnecessary to keep away from the use of such substances, especially\r\nunder present social conditions, is of itself a good training that\r\nstrengthens the will against certain tendencies to indulgence in\r\nsexual thoughts which predispose to the frequent emptying of the\r\nseminal vesicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Erotic Dreams_.--Very often these nocturnal seminal emissions are\r\nassociated with erotic dreams. Patients are inclined to attribute the\r\noccurrence of these dreams to some fault of their own or to consider\r\nthat they are at least in some way responsible for them. This thought\r\noften becomes a source of serious worry, making their condition worse.\r\nA study of this question has convinced me that in most cases there is\r\npractically no responsibility in the matter. Pressure on the seminal\r\nvesicles by an over-full bladder, or a distended rectum, leads to the\r\nproduction of nervous stimuli around which the erotic dream-ideas\r\ngather. A straightforward explanation of this will relieve many\r\npatients' minds, and keep them from bothering about the subject in\r\nsuch a way as to make their genital tract even more sensitive than it\r\nis because of their concentration of attention on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual Mental Troubles.--In our generation sex occupies a great deal\r\nof attention. Sexual tendencies are emphasized by suggestive reading\r\nof all kinds and by forced attention to sex matters. Most of the\r\nsuccessful novels deal with the so-called sex problem, our plays are\r\nto a great extent sex problem plays and our newspapers are full of sex\r\ncrimes and sexual divagations of many kinds. This acts as a strong\r\nincitement to sexuality and represents exactly the opposite of what\r\nnature intended in the matter. As a consequence, all the tendencies to\r\nover-solicitude with regard to sexual affections and all that\r\ninstability of mind and over-reaction to all forms of irritation that\r\ncomes in the midst of sexual excitation are noted. This seriously\r\ndisturbs the minds of many patients and makes their health as well as\r\ntheir morals worse than they should be. The neurotic conditions seen\r\nin those who occupy their leisure with erotic subjects are fostered by\r\nthis unfortunate over-attention to sexual matters. For general\r\nprophylaxis the physician needs to throw all the weight of his\r\ninfluence toward the correction of unfortunate tendencies in our\r\npresent-day life and healthier subjects of thought should be\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\nWe often hear it said in our time that the great fact of life is sex.\r\nIndeed, this has been insisted on _ad nauseam_ in recent years. There\r\nis no doubt that without the sex element the race would not continue\r\nunder the present dispensation. If sexual feelings did not mean so\r\nmuch to the generality of men and women it is doubtful whether\r\nmarriage would be the success that it is, though so much is said\r\nnowadays about its failure. The analogy with all the beings lower in\r\nthe scale than man shows how imperative and prominent {480} in life\r\nthis instinct is and how much it signifies. Those who insist so much,\r\nhowever, on sex as the one great fact of life seem to forget that\r\nthere are many other natural functions of quite as much importance to\r\nthe individual at least, if not to the race. Without eating neither\r\nthe individual nor the race could go on. Neither would the race go on\r\nwithout eliminating waste products. If there is one thing that our\r\nconsideration of the problems of psychotherapy has made clear it is\r\nthat whenever any of these animal facts of life is made much of and\r\noccupies attention to the exclusion of higher ideas, there is sure to\r\nbe trouble. It matters not how apparently automatic and completely\r\nspontaneous a function may be, if exaggerated attention is given to\r\nit, it is sure to be disturbed in its functions and cause serious\r\ntroubles in the organism.\r\n\r\nThere is no need further to illustrate this with regard to such\r\nphysiological necessities as feeding and excretion. At present the\r\nworld is much occupied with sex problems because, unfortunately, its\r\nattention has been focused on this subject. Physicians, particularly\r\nif they are paying attention to nervous patients, are likely to know\r\nmany individuals who have food problems, diet problems, digestion\r\nproblems, bowel problems, and many others of similar nature because\r\nthey have been focusing their attention on these functions of their\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished psychiatrist of our generation, certainly the\r\nman whose works have done most to open up new vistas for us in mental\r\ndiseases and who has added not only new knowledge but new\r\npossibilities of development, visited this country not long since and\r\nsaid, \"Oh! here in America you are sex mad.\" He added, \"I knew that we\r\nwere madly following sex problems in Europe, but I thought that in\r\nthis country, with so many other things to occupy the minds of men and\r\nwomen, you were not bothered so much with sex problems.\" What he said\r\nrepresents the impression of nearly every thoughtful foreigner who is\r\nsurprised to find that wealth and luxury have brought to us this same\r\ndegenerate interest in things sexual that occupies the so-called upper\r\nclasses and their imitators in Europe.\r\n\r\nLivy, the Roman historian, said long ago, \"Whenever women become\r\nashamed of the things they should not be ashamed of, it will not be\r\nlong before they will begin not to be ashamed of the things they\r\nshould be ashamed of.\" Whenever in history men and women have occupied\r\nthemselves, not with the rearing of families, but with the suppression\r\nof families to as great an extent as possible, sex problems have\r\nalways become emphasized. The woman who is a mother, and especially\r\nmany times a mother, usually has no trouble at all about sex problems\r\nand no tendency to have \"affinities.\" With her there is usually no\r\nquestion of sex as the central factor of life nor of any other of the\r\ncurious nonsense that has been talked about this matter as the result\r\nof giving sex a place of importance that it does not deserve. Until\r\nthere is a reform in this matter we can look for many \"neurotic,\r\nerotic and tommy-rotic\" tendencies, as they have been called, due to\r\nover-attention to one set of organs. Any organic system in the body\r\nwould be disturbed by such attention, but the sexual system is\r\nparticularly susceptible to suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs thus emphasized is the result of interfering with\r\nan animal instinct. It will make itself felt properly and secure the\r\ndue exercises of function if allowed to pursue the even tenor of its\r\nway under reasonable {481} control, but if it is fostered, thought\r\nabout, discussed, excited in various ways, pampered by indulgence and\r\nperversion, it runs away with nature. The gourmet who constantly\r\nthinks about food, plans new modes of exciting the appetite, studies\r\nsavors and odors in order to satisfy a palate that has been\r\nartificially stimulated, gets a certain animal enjoyment out of his\r\nfood that other people do not; but he usually overeats, loses his\r\nappetite, and with it any real satisfaction in eating, and suffers\r\nfrom indigestion as a consequence of indulgence, so that the suffering\r\nmuch more than compensates for any slight additional pleasure that he\r\nhas enjoyed. Besides, man is an essentially intellectual being, and\r\noccupation with the things of sense, that will manage themselves very\r\nwell if let alone, takes up just so much of the precious time that\r\nshould be devoted to other things to attain that satisfaction that\r\nmakes life well worth living. Sexuality cultivated with the degree of\r\nattention that certain people devote to feeding, becomes a pest, ruins\r\nintellectual effort, hurts initiative, leads to the most serious\r\ndisappointments in life and is the most fruitful cause of despondency\r\nand suicide that we have besides being the origin of many social evils\r\nthat still further complicate life.\r\n\r\nOne great modern nation has debauched its literature to such an extent\r\nthat probably the major portion of its books treat of sex and sex\r\nproblems. Practically all of its esthetic expression has been\r\nseriously hurt by the same fault. Its painting, its sculpture, its\r\ndramatics, its art of all kinds, have all gone the same road. The\r\nresult is seen in the lowered moral fiber of its people. A recent\r\ncensus report showed that the nation has reduced some 20,000 in\r\nnumbers and that this was only the beginning of the race suicide. They\r\nhave been thinking, talking, writing, painting, chiseling, acting sex\r\nproblems, but in the only phase of life in which sex really counts it\r\nhas been so pushed into the background or perverted that there it is\r\nfailing utterly to accomplish its one legitimate purpose. The younger\r\ngeneration as they grow up are given the idea that they are missing\r\nthe most wonderful thing in life unless they have memorable sex\r\nexperiences. These experiences must be varied in order to satisfy the\r\nartificial appetite that has been created. As a consequence, family\r\nlife and the real meaning of love and the affection of man for woman\r\nrooted in the depths of their nature is spoiled by mere animal passion\r\nand its passing expression.\r\n\r\nNature's own attitude with regard to over-attention to sex matters\r\nmust not be forgotten. The purely sexual organs have been pushed into\r\nthe background to as great an extent as possible and are intimately\r\nassociated in both sexes with one of the two ugly excretory functions,\r\nurination, and placed in close relationship with the structures which\r\nsubtend the other--defecation. Evidently nature intended that they\r\nshould be the subject of as little attention as possible.\r\nUnfortunately, the paying of attention to them to any great extent\r\nlessens somewhat of the disgust naturally aroused by the excretory\r\nfunctions with which they are associated. Nature has provided as far\r\nas possible for deterrence from over-interest. One might expect that\r\ncleanliness and the cultivation of the feelings of refinement would\r\nserve as auxiliaries in the repression of sex indulgence. The lessons\r\nof history are that usually the great bathing nations have been most\r\nsexually divagant. Among the Greeks and the Romans the ugliest sex\r\nhabits and proclivities found a place--among peoples who devoted\r\nthemselves to the cleanliness of the body. The classes {482} who bathe\r\nmost are often those with the strongest tendency to sexuality.\r\nRefinement instead of lessening the tendency to sexual indulgence\r\nrather increases it.\r\n\r\nEducation and the development of intellectuality, far from being a\r\nbarrier to sexual divagations, seem to predispose to the exaggeration\r\nof the significance of sex in life, unless the individual has a\r\nwell-balanced character or has been thoroughly grounded in ethical\r\nprinciples. The ugly stories of Greek love at a time when the Greeks\r\nwere at the climax of culture, as well as what we know about the\r\nrelations of the freedmen to their masters among the Romans during the\r\nclassical period, is all confirmed by the revelations of corresponding\r\ntendencies in recent generations among the intellectual classes even\r\nat the universities. Development of mind apparently does not\r\nneutralize to any extent these sexual tendencies. Evidently the rule\r\nof life for health's sake must be to push sexuality as much into the\r\nbackground of the mind as nature has put the sex organs in the human\r\nbody. Reason does not protect knowledge but increases suggestion. Only\r\nabsorbing occupation of mind with other subjects that will bring about\r\nneglect of these functions, as of all other physiological functions,\r\nleaving them to nature, serves to keep them in their proper place and\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSEXUAL HABITS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was emphasized in the preceding chapter, sexual symptoms are\r\nusually the subject of so much worry and disturbance of mind and\r\nbecome the center of so much unfavorable suggestion, that the only way\r\nto ameliorate the conditions which develop is by securing relaxation\r\nof the attention and diversion of mind. Mental influence is much more\r\nimportant than any other remedies that we have at our command in these\r\ncases, not only for their relief but for their ultimate cure.\r\n\r\nA state of depression of mind similar to that which develops in\r\npatients frightened by seminal emissions is often seen in those who\r\nhave for some time indulged in the habit of self-abuse. Rather\r\nfrequently a physician, especially if he is known to be interested in\r\nnervous diseases, has to listen to the story of a patient who is sure\r\nthat his health is completely undermined and that his future is the\r\ndarkest possible, because of this habit in younger days. Usually the\r\npatient is a young man who has been reading some of the literature of\r\nthe advertising \"specialists\" who distribute reading matter which\r\npictures appalling and almost irretrievable effects from such sexual\r\nhabits. The consequence is that the patient is in highly nervous\r\ncondition, has lost his appetite, is not sleeping well, is avoiding\r\nsociety, because he fears that some one may recognize his condition\r\nand its cause, and he is really in a pitiable state. Such patients are\r\nusually sure that little can be done for them. Sometimes they have\r\nalready been through the hands of several \"specialists,\" particularly\r\nof the mail-order variety, and the literature provided for them and\r\nthe letters written to them have all helped to make them worse and\r\nmuch more solicitous about themselves.\r\n\r\n{483}\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some of the exaggerated notions with regard to the\r\neffect of these habits that are so widely diffused by the exploiters\r\nof the young have been adopted by moralists with the idea that they\r\ncan thus deter youth from certain practices and scare the victims of\r\nsuch habits out of them. It is extremely doubtful, however, whether\r\nself abuse of itself, unless practiced in very early years or indulged\r\nin to a degree that is possible only in those of unbalanced mind, ever\r\nworks anything like the serious harm that is claimed. Certainly\r\nphysicians who are most familiar with its results are not ready to\r\nconfirm the opinions usually advanced as to the awful harmfulness of\r\nthe practice. Personally, I have had a number of patients confess to\r\nme that they had indulged in the habit to some extent for twenty years\r\nand longer and yet had never suffered anything more than passing\r\nphysical discomfort. It is unfortunate, then, that the exaggerations\r\nof the quack should by receiving the approval of the well-intentioned\r\nmoralists, be emphasized so as to add to the neurotic disturbance of\r\nmind which makes these patients so miserable and for a time may\r\nseriously interfere with their health. Occasionally even suicides are\r\nreported in which the underlying motive seems to have been the dread\r\non the part of a young man that a sexual habit has so undermined his\r\nhealth that cure is impossible and that physical and mental\r\ndeterioration to a marked degree is inevitable. The opinions of\r\nconservative physicians tend to show that there is no good reason for\r\nthinking that in normal healthy persons such habits ever have the\r\nserious effects thus set forth.\r\n\r\nPatients can be assured that whatever evil effects follow the practice\r\nwill not remain after it has been given up. There are no serious\r\nenduring sequelae, with one or two exceptions in very special cases,\r\nthat perhaps should be noticed. Most men of considerable experience in\r\nthe matter are now decidedly of the opinion that self-abuse does not\r\nproduce any more serious consequences than the same amount of ordinary\r\nsexual intercourse. It is possible for sexual intercourse indulged in\r\nexcessively, as it sometimes is in early marital life, to produce the\r\nsame feelings of exhaustion, lack of control over the vasomotor system\r\nand disturbance of the gastro-intestinal tract which are noted in\r\nself-abuse. In both cases the symptoms promptly disappear upon proper\r\nregulation of life. This is a very different opinion from that which\r\nused to be expressed in this matter and it is given only after due\r\ndeliberation and consultation of many authorities both in writing and\r\norally. Its expression, far from taking away one of the best deterrent\r\nmotives against the practice, rather forces an appeal to the manliness\r\nof the individual. The motive of fear never accomplishes much, while a\r\nfrank statement of the real condition may be greatly helpful.\r\n\r\nWhile the habit of self-abuse as indulged in by the ordinary\r\nindividual practically never has the awful consequences that have been\r\nsometimes pictured as resulting from it even long after its cessation,\r\nthere is no doubt that it is productive of many physical symptoms\r\nduring the time of its indulgence. There is almost sure to be a\r\ndiscouraging lassitude and a tendency to exhaustion after even\r\ncomparatively small efforts. While this is true for ordinary muscular\r\nefforts it is also true for other bodily functions that involve\r\nmuscular activity. In recent years we have learned that of the stomach\r\nfunctions the motor is more important than the chemical. In the bowels\r\nthe motor function is extremely important. There are likely to be\r\ndisturbances, then, in the gastro-intestinal tract as a consequence of\r\nthe muscular condition that {484} develops in those patients. Probably\r\nmore important even than the physical, however, are the psychic\r\nresults of the habit. The patient feels discouraged and cast down at\r\nhis inability to conquer himself and is likely to avoid such exercise\r\nand diversion of mind as would make normal healthy function possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Disturbances.--It is the custom to say that mental\r\ndeterioration almost surely follows the habit. Those familiar with\r\nmental cases often see self-abuse practiced with serious results by\r\nyoung folks whose mentality is deteriorated. In these cases the\r\npractice was indulged in with great frequency and with direct physical\r\nconsequences, such as loss of sleep, of appetite and the like. It is\r\nnot the habit, however, that has caused the mental deterioration. The\r\nyoung patients are going crazy, but not because of self-abuse. Their\r\nhabit of self-abuse had originated and become exaggerated because they\r\nwere already mentally unbalanced. Their extreme indulgence in it is\r\nespecially due to their lack of control over themselves, because they\r\nare not possessed of strong will power with regard to any thing. A\r\nvicious circle is formed and the insane young man gradually deepens\r\nhis insanity by hurting his physical condition through over-indulgence\r\nin the habit and all this further lessens his self-control; but were\r\nit not for the original mental weakness the habit would not have been\r\nindulged in to so great an extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect on Prostate.--There is one phase of the ill effects of\r\nself-abuse that it is well to recall as having the confirmation of men\r\nof large experience and conservative views. There is a definite\r\nimpression among specialists in genito-urinary diseases that\r\nenlargement of the prostate in some cases is due to the frequently\r\nrepeated irritation and the prolongation of that irritation of the\r\nprostate during the practice of self-abuse. When such men as Bangs and\r\nKeyes are agreed on a subject of this kind, then even though in a\r\ncertain number of cases the changes in the prostate leading to its\r\nenlargement are evidently inflammatory, it is well to consider that\r\nthe functional over-activity of the gland superinduced by the practice\r\nmay lead at least to an enlargement of the glandular elements with the\r\nconsequent interference with urination which so frequently comes in\r\nold age.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Factors.--Besides mental elements that predispose to the\r\nformation of sexual habits there are physical factors that are\r\nimportant in these cases. They must be particularly looked for and\r\ntreated carefully if found, or there can be little hope of relief for\r\nthe conditions. The most prominent of these is the existence of a long\r\nforeskin, especially if its opening is small, thus leading to the\r\nretention of urine, the deposition of urinary salts with the formation\r\nof preputial concretions or so-called calculi. These are intensely\r\nirritant, cause frequent itching and thus predispose to these sexual\r\nhabits. Even where the preputial opening is free and allows egress of\r\nurine without residue, the accumulation of smegma often causes\r\nconsiderable irritation and if the most scrupulous cleanliness with\r\ncleansing at least once a day is not maintained, irritative conditions\r\narise, especially in hot weather, that may give occasions for sex\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the habit is sometimes seen in extremely early\r\nyears. The youngest case I ever saw occurred in a child not quite\r\nnineteen months old whose mother said that for several months she had\r\nnoticed certain curious actions that she could scarcely understand\r\nuntil finally the truth dawned on her. Then she was morbidly sensitive\r\nabout it, sure that the habit was due {485} to a fault of her own and\r\nit was some time before she consulted a physician. This was her fourth\r\nchild and, strange as it may seem, it was only at the conception of\r\nthis child that she first knew what sexual pleasure was. She feared\r\nthat her feeling had been in some way sinful and that as a consequence\r\nof her sin this curious habit had developed in such early years in her\r\nbaby boy. As is usually the case in these instances, I found that the\r\nprepuce was very tight indeed, having scarcely more than a pinhole\r\nopening in it. During urination this ballooned and there remained in\r\nthe pouch-like process at the end of the penis a certain amount of\r\nresidual urine after every urination. From this urinary salts had been\r\nprecipitated and had formed scaly concretions which remained in the\r\npreputial pouch and were extremely irritant. As a consequence of this\r\nirritation the baby had been very itchy and it was in the endeavor to\r\nrelieve the itching by the natural process of scratching that the\r\npleasure of the sensations aroused had been discovered and the sexual\r\nhabit had been formed.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently in young men a condition resembling this to some\r\ndegree at least is found and then, of course, the question of its\r\nremoval must be taken up at once. It is surprising how often in youths\r\nin their late teens concretions are seen. The constant irritation\r\nmakes it practically impossible for the patient to keep his hands from\r\nthe parts, and so circumcision is absolutely necessary. Not\r\ninfrequently when the preputial condition is not nearly so bad this\r\noperation may also be at least advisable if not necessary. The matter\r\nof cleanliness must be attended to, preferably after getting up in the\r\nmorning and not before going to bed at night, for the reaction after\r\ncold water may cause congestion of the organ. After a time the\r\nfrequent use of cold water seems to make the parts much less reactive\r\nto irritation of any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Effects.--The super-excitation of nerves consequent upon the\r\nmore or less general erethism that is induced, lessens resistive\r\nvitality. Victims of the habit are more liable to colds, to various\r\ninfectious diseases, and are subject to fatigue and lassitude, with\r\nincapacity to work to their full power. They lose control over their\r\nvasomotor system to some extent as a result of this systemic erethism.\r\nThey blush easily, they perspire easily, there is a tendency in many\r\nof them to flash as if of heat and cold, they become pale under\r\nexcitement or anger more than formerly, they are likely to suffer from\r\ncold hands and feet, and the surface of the body is inclined to be\r\ncold and as a consequence patients are tremulous. This represents a\r\nwaste of nervous energy and as a consequence sleep may be disturbed\r\nand digestion interfered with.\r\n\r\nIt is important, therefore, to consider these cases as really needing\r\nmedical care. For their treatment the most important consideration is\r\nprophylaxis, not alone of the habit itself, but of each of the acts.\r\nProphylaxis of the habit is an ethical question that we can scarcely\r\ndo justice to here. Prophylaxis of the acts requires consideration of\r\nthe physical and moral factors that predispose to their commission.\r\nWhile the habit may have secured such deep control that the patient\r\nalmost despairs of relief from it, when care is taken to remove\r\nphysical and moral predispositions the conquest of the habit becomes\r\ncomparatively easy. Over and over again I have seen cases that have\r\nlasted for years in which the patients were surprised at the ease with\r\nwhich they were able {486} to drop the habit just as soon as they took\r\nthe measures necessary to prevent predisposing conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking the Habit.--Once physical factors predisposing to it are\r\nremoved, the habit is not so hard to break as it would seem to be from\r\nthe suggestions to that effect made in sensational literature. It is\r\nneither so deleterious in its physical effects nor so deteriorating as\r\nregards character as is usually stated. Anyone with a reasonable\r\namount of firmness can break it off if he really resolves to. Over and\r\nover again I have seen patients quite surprised at the ease with which\r\nthey were able to avoid the practice for weeks once they made up their\r\nminds in the matter. Indeed this is one of the unfortunate features in\r\ncompletely conquering the habit. It is comparatively so easy to break\r\nit off when the mind is made up that there comes the feeling that now\r\nit must be absolutely facile to keep away from it. This is, however,\r\nnever true. Relapses are extremely easy. If the patient allows himself\r\nto read vicious books, or suggestive literature of any kind, or\r\npermits himself an indulgence in the reading of several columns of the\r\naccount of a sex murder trial, or goes to see a sex problem play with\r\nits suggestions, or exposes himself to sexually exciting conditions of\r\nany kind, he will be almost sure to lapse into the old habit.\r\n\r\nRelapses are almost inevitable. But it is easier to break the habit\r\nthe second time than it was the first and it becomes increasingly easy\r\nif the patient keeps up the effort of regulating his life so as to\r\navoid the occasions of the habit. Relapses are quite as sure to occur\r\nas with regard to alcoholism if occasions for the taking of liquor are\r\nnot sedulously avoided. The patient always seems to need a\r\nconfidant--someone to whom he can go for help and who assures him of\r\nthe ability that he has to overcome himself if he only will. The\r\npractice of confession in the Roman Catholic Church makes it\r\ncomparatively easy for serious people of that faith to overcome the\r\nhabit. The physician must be taken into confidence in the same way and\r\nfor a time, at least once a week, the patient may have to be perfectly\r\nfrank with regard to his condition in order to have the help afforded\r\nby such confidences. The physician can often, particularly at the\r\nbeginning, make the physical conditions such as to help in the\r\nbreaking of the habit. Bromides taken to the extent of a dram or more\r\na day are almost a specific for superirritability of the nervous\r\nsystem, and if taken for two or three weeks the patient will usually\r\nhave little or no difficulty in overcoming the habit. They are not of\r\nmuch avail after this time unless the patient's character has been\r\naroused to determined helpfulness in the matter.\r\n\r\nIn obstinate cases it may be necessary to have a patient come every\r\nday, or at least every second day, for some time and give an account\r\nof how he has succeeded in resisting his habit in the interval. At\r\nleast he must be asked to report whenever there is a lapse. It is\r\nsurprising how much the anticipation of having to tell someone else of\r\na drop back into the habit means in helping the patient eventually to\r\novercome it. Very slight motives serve to cause relapses, but almost\r\nany external personal aid, if pursued with confidence, will avail\r\neffectually to break it. I talk from an experience of many cases and\r\nknow how much can be accomplished even though patients insist that\r\nthey have tried all the resources of their will power and of prayer\r\nwithout avail. They have really not tried, they have not willed in\r\nreality; sometimes they {487} have reached a point where they cannot\r\nwill without the moral support of another personality. This can be\r\nreadily supplied to them by a firm, sympathetic physician whom they\r\nrespect. It will take time to overcome the tendency to relapse\r\nwhenever the will is relapsed, but the habit itself can be broken\r\nwithout much difficulty in a few days.\r\n\r\nCertain times are particularly dangerous for relapses into the habit.\r\nThese are just before going to sleep at night and before getting out\r\nof bed in the morning. At these times the mind must be occupied or\r\nelse the patient will almost surely find his habit recurring. Often\r\nthe habit of reading in bed, properly supported by pillows and with\r\nabundant light at an angle that makes reading easy, seems to be good\r\nfor these patients, because they may read until their eyelids get\r\nheavy, then pull the chain of their light to extinguish it and turn\r\nover to sleep. In the morning prompt rising after waking is important.\r\nBed clothes that are too heavy and too great warmth of clothing\r\npredispose to sexual excitation and must be avoided. The room should\r\nbe cool rather than warm and the mattress rather hard.\r\n\r\nThe more tired the patient is the less liability will there be to\r\ndifficulty in these matters. But air is even more important than\r\nexercise in giving the tiredness which superinduces deep sleep. A\r\nlessening of the normal amount of oxygen seems to relax the inhibitory\r\npower of the higher centers over the sexual centers in the cord.\r\nPeople who are drowned, those who are hanged, and those whose supply\r\nof oxygen is shut off by the inhalation of the heavier gases are\r\nlikely to have involuntary seminal emissions. These are probably\r\nconsequent upon the shutting off of the air.\r\n\r\nThe important element in the treatment is to make the patient feel\r\nthat, if he really wants to, he can conquer in this matter. The old\r\nmotives of fear, and especially fear of physical consequences, were\r\nquite unworthy, and inasmuch as they had any effect rather produced a\r\ndeterioration of character than a strengthening of it. The patient\r\nmust understand that if he is a man he can overcome it. Religious\r\nmotives will help much. I do not know that I have ever seen a case\r\nwhere religious motives were not the most important element in the\r\ncure, but that may be due to the conditions in which I have been\r\nplaced. I have seen a number of these cases in men and women because\r\nclergymen have sent them to me in order that they might be helped in\r\nthe work of reform, and while there are many relapses and some had\r\napparently given up the effort in despair of their power to overcome\r\nthemselves, nine out of every ten of those who have seriously faced\r\nthe problem have succeeded in overcoming themselves, and as a result\r\nhave a better knowledge of their own characters and more respect for\r\nthemselves. They are better men in every way than if their improvement\r\nhad come about through selfish fear of physical consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Cure.--After the habit of self-abuse has been conquered the\r\nseminal vesicles will have a tendency to evacuate themselves rather\r\nmore frequently than before and as a consequence they will nag at\r\ncertain sexual nerve endings. They are used to having their contents\r\nemptied and distention is followed by rather ready evacuation. During\r\nthe course of this evacuation sexual thoughts are awakened in dreams\r\nand this may lead to dream states in which there seem to be lapses\r\ninto the old habit. This constitutes a serious difficulty in getting\r\nrid of the habit entirely in young and vigorous men. They may even\r\nbecome disheartened by it. It should be explained to them that they\r\nmust let {488} contrary habits form gradually and permit nature to\r\naccommodate herself to the new state of affairs. The bromides are a\r\nuseful adjunct for body and mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supposed After-effects_.--At times a patient suffering from some\r\nexhausting or serious disease, consumption, heart disease or the\r\nvarious forms of Bright's disease, will be discouraged by remembrance\r\nof the fact that in earlier years he allowed himself for some time to\r\nfall into the habit of self-abuse. If he has read, and very few men\r\nhave not, some of the literature issued by the advertising\r\n\"specialists\" and has heard the unfortunately exaggerated ideas\r\ncommonly entertained with regard to the influence on health of this\r\nhabit, he will become more or less disheartened by the idea that he\r\nthus undermined his constitution and that one reason why he is not\r\nable to react better against his affection is that he seriously\r\ndiminished his resistive vitality. This idea must, of course, be\r\novercome or it will act as a constant source of unfavorable\r\nsuggestion, lessening appetite, tending to disturb sleep, banishing\r\npeace of mind to some extent and thus inhibiting the patient from\r\nreleasing such stores of vital energy for his recovery as would surely\r\nbe in his power under favorable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFemale Habits.--The habit is more rare in women than in men, but when\r\nit occurs is a little harder to break. In men it usually develops in\r\nyouth, but oftenest in women who are past thirty-five and unmarried.\r\nIn these cases it is much harder for the patient to regain\r\nself-control, because the class of women patients who acquire such a\r\nhabit have less character, as a rule, than the men who fall into the\r\nsame condition. In all sex matters, once passion is aroused or habit\r\nformed, the woman is likely to lose control of herself more than is\r\nthe man. Even in women, however, it is not only possible, but under\r\nfavorable circumstances, quite easy to secure a break in the habit,\r\nthough relapses are more frequent than in men. Certain occupations\r\nseem particularly to favor the development of the habit. These are\r\nmainly sedentary occupations that can be followed without the\r\nnecessity for such attention as to prevent the mind from wandering off\r\ninto thoughts that may prove provocative of sexual sensation.\r\nDressmakers seem particularly likely to suffer from the affection, and\r\nthose who run sewing-machines are predisposed by the movements\r\ninvolved in their occupation to the development or, at least, to the\r\npersistence of the habit.\r\n\r\nFor women even more than men religion and the motives it supplies are\r\nthe most efficient factors for the ultimate cure of the habit. In\r\ngeneral, the greater difficulty of overcoming it in them is due in no\r\nsmall degree to the fact that they live indoors much more than men,\r\noften have sedentary occupations, and are more frequently alone. These\r\nafford opportunities for introspection and for the harboring of\r\nthoughts that lead to relapses into the habit. Besides, women are more\r\nprone to read novels and stories relating to sex problems and the\r\ndetails of sex murder trials and the like which constitute\r\never-recurring sources of mental erethism. If their habits can be\r\nmodified, especially if they can be made to realize the necessity for\r\nbeing out in the air as much as possible, and for keeping their\r\nwindows open at night, as well as for thorough cleanliness--for every\r\ngynecologist notes the necessity for this and how frequently it\r\nhappens that neglect of it leads to irritability of the external\r\norgans that is of itself a serious factor--then it would be no more\r\ndifficult for women to overcome the habit and get beyond the relapses\r\nthan it is for men. {489} Sometimes we have to overcome a morbid dread\r\nof touching themselves even for cleansing purposes which allows the\r\naccumulation of irritant material and predisposes to relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual Perversion.--Sexual perversions are sometimes considered as\r\ndifferent from sexual neuroses, but such they really are. They are\r\noftener due to habit than to anything deeper. Much has been said about\r\nthe unfortunate natural inclination of some people to indulge in\r\nsexual perversion, but such talk partakes of the nature of similar\r\nremarks with regard to habits of other kinds. The alcohol habit, for\r\ninstance, is formed by many men as the result of their environment and\r\na weakness of character, with lack of resolution to support themselves\r\nin self-denial when they are tempted to drink. In recent years it has\r\nbeen only too often the custom to excuse or to justify many of these\r\ncases. There are a few persons in whom, owing to weakness of\r\ncharacter, alcoholism is more or less inevitable if occasions for\r\nindulgence occur. And in the same way there has been much maudlin\r\nsentimentality wasted on sexual perverts, as if most of these men\r\ncould not avoid the actions that the rest of humanity abominates.\r\nThere are, perhaps, a few individuals who because of a failure on the\r\npart of nature to define sex in them properly--as if she had not quite\r\nmade up her mind which sex they should belong to--are more to be\r\npitied than held to account for their delinquencies in this matter.\r\nCompared to the whole number of sexual perverts, however, these are\r\nvery few. Under the protection of the pity awakened for these, a large\r\nnumber of others find quasi-justification for their acts.\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows much about these patients realizes that their story\r\nis, as a rule, very different from what it would be if they were\r\ninevitably impelled to the commission of the acts in question. Many of\r\nthem had the greatest abhorrence for it at the beginning, were\r\nattracted to it out of curiosity and morbid sexualism, because they\r\nhad allowed themselves to think and read and dream about sex matters\r\novermuch. They are usually idle people who do not take life seriously\r\nand who have an inordinate curiosity about sex subjects. At the\r\nbeginning the commission of the perverted sexual act was associated\r\nwith an intensely deterrent rather than an attractive feeling, but\r\ngradually this was overcome and a contrary habit has been formed. It\r\nis difficult to break this habit and to get away from the morbid\r\nsexual ideas that have been allowed to develop and grow strong in\r\nconnection with it.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is somewhat different from that held by many men who are\r\nrecognized as authorities on this subject and who find many excuses in\r\nthe nature of their patients for these perversions. If it is recalled,\r\nhowever, that whenever wealth has brought luxury to a people and\r\nluxury has brought over-refinement, such sex perversions have been\r\nparticularly noted, it will be realized that not nature, but the ways\r\nof men are responsible for their development. Whenever men pay much\r\nattention to their bodies, exercise for the sake of their muscles,\r\nbathe not for cleanliness but for luxury, sex perversions become\r\ncommon in history. The story of Greek love is well known.\r\nCorresponding conditions developed at Rome under similar\r\ncircumstances. According to good authorities, the English universities\r\nbecame tainted with it a generation ago. Our athletic clubs in this\r\ncountry have rightly or wrongly fallen under suspicion in this matter,\r\nthough the tendency to exaggeration with regard to such things, and\r\npopular credulity in such matters must be recalled. {490} Some\r\nconfirmatory evidence undoubtedly there was. Sexual perversions then\r\nwould seem to be due in most cases to definite conditions and our\r\nknowledge suggests readily what should be the prophylaxis.\r\n\r\nIn the course of some studies with Professor Magnan at L'Asile Ste\r\nAnne in Paris I saw a number of these curious cases of sexual\r\ndivagations, exhibitionism, sex perversions and similar conditions.\r\nSome of his cases were clearly curious examples of natural tendency,\r\nat least, to mental hermaphroditism. Occasionally men of normal\r\ndevelopment otherwise have a woman's waist and woman's torso above the\r\nwaist, and many womanly coquettish ways that point to this curious\r\nmixture of sexes. Occasionally women are lacking in all the sex\r\ncharacteristics of the upper portion of the body, have no breasts and\r\nhave the hirsute characteristics of men on the face and even on the\r\nchest. In such cases one may be tempted to let one's pity override\r\none's better judgment and feel that resistance to the temptations to\r\nindulge in perverted sexual feelings may be so difficult for these\r\npeople as to be almost impossible. Even in such cases, however, under\r\nMagnan's gentle tutelage, under his faithful care and sympathy, men\r\nand women lost most of the tendency to commit unnatural acts and\r\ncertainly found it easier to live normal lives than before.\r\n\r\nFor the majority of these sexual perverts, however, it is as with\r\nregard to drug addictions, alcoholism, and obesity, just a question of\r\nwilling not to indulge in certain appetites that serves to help them.\r\nThere is no doubt that it is a difficult matter to break a habit that\r\nhas become a second nature, and it is almost impossible that it should\r\nbe accomplished without a number of relapses. If the patient really\r\nwishes to correct the evil habit, however, this is perfectly possible.\r\n\r\nThe talk of a third sex with homo-sexual inclinations is quite beside\r\nthe mark. Certain of this class have a weakness of intellect and of\r\nwill that is at the root of their trouble, but not a few of them pride\r\nthemselves on their intellect and will power in most other things and\r\nmust not be permitted to deceive themselves as to their weakness and\r\nits significance. It is not nature but self that is at fault and the\r\ndisease can be completely eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n{491}\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII\r\n\r\n_SKIN DISEASES_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY IN SKIN DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place of mental influence in the treatment of skin diseases will\r\nbe best realized from the role that we know the mind plays in the\r\nproduction of various skin manifestations. There is a whole series of\r\nskin affections which depend to a considerable extent on mental\r\nconditions, worries, anxieties, shocks, frights and the like, and a\r\nnumber of skin affections that have been labeled hysterical which\r\noccur in nervous persons, due to over-attention to self and their\r\nconditions. It has been well said that it is possible to make the feet\r\nwarm by thinking about them. Certainly attention to any part of the\r\nskin surface causes a tingling and hyperemia may follow. Blushing is\r\nan illustration of mental influence on the skin, and anything that\r\nwould tend to make this endure for some time would give rise to\r\nerythematous conditions. We know the creepy, uncomfortable, hot\r\nfeelings that come over us in times of suppressed excitement when we\r\nare waiting for something to happen; and, on the other hand, there is\r\na pallor and tremor that accompanies fright or fear, which points to\r\nmental influences over the vasomotor system in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrticarias.--Certain skin diseases, especially those allied to the\r\nurticaria group, are prone to occur in connection with excitement and\r\nworry. In the chapter on Neurotic Intestinal Affections attention is\r\ncalled to the fact that many patients who suffer from intestinal\r\nidiosyncrasies and have excessive reactions to special kinds of food,\r\nas cheese, strawberries, or the like, sometimes also suffer from skin\r\nlesions and intestinal disturbance through worry or excitement. While\r\npreparing for examinations or undergoing some physical trial or\r\nsuffering from worry or anxiety such persons may have urticaria or\r\neven wheals on the skin. There may be some dietary disturbance to\r\naccount for them, but they would not occur, or at least would not be\r\nso serious and annoying, but for the disturbed mental condition. Under\r\nthese circumstances dermatographia is a common manifestation. It used\r\nto be considered a symptom of many physical conditions, but will occur\r\nin almost any nervous person during the course of an examination by a\r\nstrange physician or when some important medical decision is pending.\r\n\r\n\r\nEczema.--Not only these passing conditions of the skin, however, but\r\nmore lasting affections have been connected with mental disturbance.\r\nProbably every skin specialist has noted in a number of his cases that\r\na first attack of eczema came after a period of worry or excitement,\r\nor sometimes followed directly on a fright. When relief from the\r\ncondition has been brought about {492} by treatment, relapses occur\r\nduring periods of business worry or family anxiety or mental stresses\r\nof one kind or another. Cabinet crises in England are found to be\r\nlikely to be followed by the recurrence of eczematous conditions in\r\nolder members of the Cabinet or by first attacks in some of those\r\nwhose skin has been irritated by some internal condition. Unless\r\nbusiness worries can be removed or family anxieties allayed the cure\r\nof eczema becomes a difficult matter. Men or women who worry about\r\ntheir eczematous condition apparently prolong it. This is particularly\r\ntrue if they have little to do and are likely to be much occupied with\r\nthemselves and their condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerpes.--Herpetic conditions resemble urticaria in their response to\r\nmental conditions. Herpes preputialis and herpes progenitalis occur\r\nparticularly in people who worry over the possibility of some\r\ninfection of the genitals. The lesions are likely to be indolent until\r\nthe state of mind with regard to them is relieved by reassurance as to\r\ntheir comparatively innocuous character. Even herpes zoster is prone\r\nto come on after a period of worry and anxiety. It is due to\r\ninfection, but the infection becomes more possible after a lowering of\r\nresistive vitality in the nervous system. This is particularly true as\r\nregards herpes facialis. It has been noted again and again that facial\r\nneuralgia is most likely to occur after fright, deep emotion, or\r\nprolonged anxiety. Treatment of these cases will only be successful if\r\nthe mental state is set right. This is particularly true with regard\r\nto Bell's palsy. Patients who worry much about it and who fear that it\r\nmay have lasting results are likely to prolong its course and to put\r\noff complete cure for a good while.\r\n\r\n\r\nVasomotor Disturbance.--There is a series of skin affections connected\r\ndirectly with the vasomotor system of the skin which are largely under\r\nthe influence of emotional or mental factors. These represent\r\nparticularly the milder forms of Raynaud's disease and the parallel\r\nforms of Weir Mitchell's disease. In the one case there is a spasm of\r\nthe arterioles causing what the French call \"dead fingers,\" and in the\r\nother paralysis of the vasomotor system with venous congestion in the\r\nparts. They are seen particularly in persons of highly nervous\r\norganization and especially after periods of emotional strain or\r\nstress. There is a series of affections related to these,\r\ncharacterized by numbness, paresthesiae, going to sleep of the fingers\r\nor members, tingling, and even milder forms of itchiness--sometimes\r\ndignified as pruritus--which are largely due to mental factors. Some\r\nphysical condition will need to be corrected, but they will only\r\ndisappear if the mind is set at rest and if the patient is kept from\r\noccupying his attention much with them. Concentration of attention\r\nwill make them chronic.\r\n\r\n\r\nScurvy.--Scurvy is not usually thought of as a skin disease, though it\r\nhas many local manifestations on the skin and mucous membrane. It is a\r\ndeep nutritional disturbance of such nature that it would seem the\r\nmind could have but little influence over it. When scurvy was common,\r\nhowever, it was often noticed that any change of attitude of mind in\r\naffected persons brought amelioration or deterioration of condition.\r\nScurvy develops with special virulence during discouragement; it gets\r\nbetter with the dawn of hope. It has been known to be much improved by\r\nthe prospect of a naval engagement when all the sick men wanted to get\r\ninto the fighting. The famous case of the Siege of Breda in 1625 is\r\noften quoted. The city was about to capitulate because so many of the\r\nsoldiers were suffering from the disease. The Prince of Orange, {493}\r\nhowever, sent word that a new and powerful remedy had been discovered\r\nthat was sure to cure the affection, and that he had secured some of\r\nit and it would not be long before they would all be well. What he\r\nsent was a remedy that had been used with indifferent success for\r\nscurvy when taken in large doses. He could send only enough to give a\r\nfew drops to each patient. This small dose was wonder-working in its\r\neffect and proved to have the healing virtue of a gallon of the\r\nliquor. Most of the patients got better and surrender was put off.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarts.--A striking evidence of the influence of the mind upon the skin\r\nis given by what we know of warts. All sorts of charms have been not\r\nalone suggested for them but found to work in certain cases. Lord\r\nBacon in his \"Natural History\" tells the story of the charming away of\r\nwarts and exemplifies it by his own experience. When he was about\r\nsixteen a number of warts--at least 100--came out upon his hands. One\r\nof these had been there from childhood. The manner of their cure he\r\ndetails as follows:\r\n\r\n  The English Ambassador's lady, who was a woman far from\r\n  superstition, told me one day she would help me away with my warts;\r\n  whereupon she got a piece of lard with the skin on, and rubbed the\r\n  warts all over with the fat side; and amongst the rest that wart\r\n  which I had from my childhood. Then she nailed the piece of lard,\r\n  with the fat towards the sun, upon a post of her chamber window,\r\n  which was to the south. The success was that within five weeks'\r\n  space all the warts went away, and that wart which I had so long\r\n  endured for company. But at the rest I did not marvel, because they\r\n  came in a short time, and might go away in a short time again; but\r\n  the going away of that which had stayed so long doth yet stick with\r\n  me.\r\n\r\nLucian, the Greek satirist, tells that warts were cured by magic in\r\nhis time. Carpenter in his \"Human Physiology,\" page 984, says: \"The\r\ncharming away of warts by spells of the most vulgar kind belonged to\r\nthose cases which are real facts, however they may be explained.\" Dr.\r\nHack Tuke in his \"Influence of the Mind Upon the Body\" says: \"In\r\nvisiting a county asylum some years ago my attention was directed to\r\nseveral of the patients who were pestered with warts and I solemnly\r\ncharmed them away within a specified period. I had quite forgotten the\r\ncircumstance until on revisiting the institution a few months\r\nafterwards I found that my practice had been followed by the desired\r\neffect and that I was regarded as a real benefactor.\" This feature of\r\nthe method of removing warts, setting a date before which they shall\r\ndisappear, is noted in most of the successful charms. Dr. Tuke tells\r\nof a case in which a gentleman on shaking hands with a young lady\r\nnoticed that she had many warts. He asked her how many she had; she\r\nreplied about a dozen, she thought. \"Count them, will you,\" said the\r\ncaller; and taking out a piece of paper he solemnly took down her\r\ncounting, remarking: \"You will not be troubled with your warts after\r\nnext Sunday.\" Now it is fact that by the day named the warts had\r\ndisappeared and did not return.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Pigmentation.--Pigmentation occurs very commonly as the\r\nresult of neurotic conditions. Dr. Champneys, in his article on\r\n\"Pigmentation of the Face and Other Parts, Especially in Women,\" in\r\nSt. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, Volume XV, has illustrated this\r\nvery thoroughly. The pigmentations of women during the phases of\r\ngenital life, menstruation, pregnancy, the menopause and the fact that\r\neunuchs are usually fair and fat, while deep pigmentation in the white\r\nrace is usually associated with sexual irritability, all make\r\ninteresting studies in this subject. From comparative {494} anatomy\r\nand physiology the influence of the nervous system over pigmentation\r\nhas been very well illustrated. Bruecke in 1851 established the\r\ninfluence of the nerves on the color of the chameleon and of the frog,\r\nand there have been many confirmations of his work. Pouchet, in 1876,\r\nin the _Journal de l'Anatomie et de Physiologie_ proved that fish\r\ngained the power of changing color by practice and lost it by disuse.\r\nThe influence in most cases, animal and human, which produces\r\npigmentation is exerted by the nervous system through the vascular\r\nsupply. The duskiness that sometimes comes with emotion, the pallor\r\nthat accompanies strong mental disturbance, as well as the blushing\r\nstates, show that the vasomotor system can be influenced in every\r\npart. Pigmentation often seems only a consequence of local continuance\r\nof such disturbance. Many of the feminine patients in whom even deep\r\ndiscolorations around the eyes occur in connection with menstruation\r\nare typical neurotic individuals. It is worry in combination with the\r\nphysical disturbance that produces the pigmentation. There are some\r\ncases on record where emotional states have caused loss of pigment in\r\nthe negro or other colored races, or in the hair, as when, in\r\nwell-substantiated cases, people's hair has become white in a single\r\nnight. In every case of pigmentary disturbance, then, the individual\r\nmust be carefully studied and as far as possible all emotional\r\ndisturbance must be eliminated. Without this other treatment usually\r\nfails.\r\n\r\n\r\nPruritus.--Pruritus in the old is often a bothersome symptom. All\r\nsorts of remedies, internal and external, are recommended for it and\r\nsuccesses are reported with them. Whenever there are many remedies for\r\na symptom complex, it usually means that the suggestive element in all\r\nof them is large. For pruritus the influence of the patient's mind is\r\nextremely important. Often it will be found that these old patients\r\nare getting out scarcely at all, but are living in close confinement\r\nin their rooms, the air of which is scarcely ever changed. I have\r\nknown even the keyholes to be stuffed and arrangements made by which\r\nthe cracks between the door and the frame were rendered impervious to\r\nair. In these cases the most important feature of any treatment is to\r\nsecure a proper amount of air. Sir Henry Thompson, the great English\r\nsurgeon, in his advice how to grow old successfully, written when he\r\nhimself was over 80, suggested that the cells of the skin needed an\r\nair bath every day. He advised that men should make all their toilet\r\narrangements for the day without any garments on. Washing, the\r\npreparation of clothing, shaving, and whatever else was done in the\r\nearly morning was to be accomplished after the night clothes were\r\ntaken off and before other clothes were put on. He lived to be well\r\nabove eighty and was sure that this practice had been of help to him.\r\nStimulating rubbings, if done gently and without the production of too\r\nmuch reaction, will always benefit these people.\r\n\r\nIf old people have no interest, nothing that attracts their attention,\r\nand if they once develop pruritus their mind gets concentrated on\r\ntheir cutaneous sensations and it will be impossible to relieve them\r\nby any treatment until their minds get occupied with something else.\r\nAnyone who wants to sit in a chair for a few minutes and think about\r\nhis cutaneous sensations will soon realize how vividly these can be\r\nbrought to mind and how annoying they can become. To sit and think of\r\na portion of the body is to want to scratch it before long. Scratching\r\nproduces a flow of blood to the surface that adds to the itchy\r\nfeeling. The only way to get away from it is to get the mind {495}\r\noccupied with something else. Of course, where circulation is weak\r\nbecause of failing heart or disturbed because of arteriosclerosis,\r\ntreatment directed to these conditions should be employed, but the\r\ninfluence of the mind on blushing and skin feeling must not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen pruritus develops in the old in connection with phases of\r\narterial degeneration--its most intractable form--it is important to\r\nremember that diversion of mind is the most important therapeutic\r\nagent that we have. The old have few diversions. They have given up\r\ntheir ordinary occupations, they are often no longer interested in\r\nreading, friends whom they used to know have died, and they are left a\r\ngreat deal to themselves. Under these circumstances anything the\r\nmatter with them brings about a concentration of attention. This is\r\neven more true if they have been very well in earlier life and have\r\nhad practically no experience with sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical Cutaneous Conditions.--There are certain cracks of the skin\r\nwith ulcerative lesions which occur in hysterical patients in the\r\nneighborhood of the knuckles that represent a phase of unfavorable\r\ninfluence of the mind. When these patients begin to worry or be\r\nanxious they know that these skin lesions will follow. Expectancy\r\nseems to make it certain that the lesions will come and attention adds\r\nto their chronicity. It has been noted that \"chapped hands,\"\r\nespecially when accompanied by deep cracks in cold weather, are made\r\nworse by anxiety or worry. In many neurotic patients it is impossible\r\nto treat such conditions satisfactorily unless the patient's mind can\r\nbe put at ease. It is surprising how intractable these conditions can\r\nbe, but that is usually because all the physician's attention is\r\ndevoted to the skin instead of a considerable portion of it being\r\ngiven also to the patient's mental and nervous condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtefact Skin Lesions.--Of course artefact skin lesions produced by\r\nthe application of carbolic acid or nitric acid or ammonia or some\r\nother chemical irritant, or by rubbing with pumice stone, or with the\r\nthumb as schoolboys make what in my schooldays were called \"fox\r\nbites,\" are skin lesions connected with a special state of mind and so\r\ndeserve a mention here. The physician finds them under the most\r\nunexpected circumstances at times and in patients apparently above all\r\nsuspicion of their self-infliction. They can only be prevented by\r\nchanging the patient's state of mind, though this is scarcely what is\r\nordinarily thought of in psychotherapy. Where skin lesions are\r\natypical it is well to bear in mind the possibility of this curious\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind in Dermatotherapy.--I have had old dermatologists assure me\r\nthat they felt that the mind influenced materially the course of many\r\nforms of skin disease. Younger dermatologists are prone to be\r\nlocalists; as they get older the treatment of the patient's general\r\ncondition is felt to be more important; after twenty years of\r\nexperience they realize the place of psychotherapy in the treatment of\r\ntheir cases. What is said here is only meant to be suggestive, but\r\ncertainly sufficient data are supplied to make it quite sure that the\r\nmind greatly influences skin conditions and must always be treated if\r\nsuccess, especially in chronic cases, is to be secured. I have seen\r\nconfidence in a particular physician or remedy do much for even the\r\nmost sloughing and obstinate psoriases. Eczema follows the same law.\r\nIf psychotherapy can help in the treatment of conditions that are so\r\noften intractable, it must surely not be neglected in other cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n{496}\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV\r\n\r\n_DISEASES OF DUCTLESS GLANDS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDIABETES\r\n\r\n\r\nDiabetes is an affection of metabolism definitely recognized as due to\r\nserious organic changes, though existing in several forms. We are not\r\nas yet absolutely sure whether there may not be quite different\r\norganic diseases in the various forms. Of one thing clinical\r\nexperience has given us assurance, that the condition of the patient's\r\nnervous system is extremely important. While certain forms of diabetes\r\nare due to pancreatic changes and others perhaps to changes in the\r\nliver or other abdominal organs, the nervous system itself can affect\r\nthe consumption and excretion of sugar within the body. Certain\r\ninjuries, especially, as pointed out by animal experiments, irritation\r\nof the floor of the fourth ventricle may produce passing diabetes. The\r\nsymptom may also occur in connection with states of the nervous\r\nsystem. Glycosuria, or the passage of sugar in the urine, may occur\r\nsimply as alimentary glycosuria; and while this is usually due to an\r\nexcess of sugar in the diet, the glycosuria itself is predisposed to\r\nby neurotic conditions in the patient. Diabetic patients are made\r\nworse by worry of any kind and particularly by solicitude about\r\nthemselves and their ailment. Hence, the place that psychotherapy has\r\nin the treatment of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion.--In most cases of diabetes, however, probably\r\nthe most important factor in the production of symptoms is the serious\r\ndisturbance of mind. The patient has an incurable disease and is\r\nfrankly told so. For the physician the word \"incurable\" means only\r\nthat his remedies are as yet inefficient in preventing certain\r\nnutritional or metabolic disturbances, and that these will be likely\r\nto continue in spite of all he can do. For the patient \"incurable\"\r\nmeans that he has a disease for which the doctor confesses that he can\r\ndo nothing--which is not true--and that it is almost surely\r\nprogressive, while the many reports of death from diabetes of which he\r\nhears only confirm the impression that he has not long to live and\r\nthat most of the time remaining will have to be spent in irksome care\r\nof himself and almost superhuman self-denial.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this train of unfavorable suggestions, the history\r\nof practically every case of the milder form of diabetes in older\r\npeople contains a period in which, shortly after the discovery that\r\nthey had the disease, they suffered more severely from it than at any\r\nother time. As a rule, the discovery was accidental. The occurrence of\r\na succession of boils, the development of a {497} carbuncle,\r\noccasionally an intractable eczema or a great itchiness of the skin,\r\nor an irritation of the external urinary organs, the occurrence of\r\ncramps at night, or neuralgia pains, have led to an examination of the\r\nurine and the finding of a considerable quantity of sugar. As a rule,\r\nthe patients are at once put on a diet containing little starch and no\r\nsugar, and after a short time most of the bothersome symptoms of the\r\ndiabetes have ceased. Their own worry, however, the strictness of the\r\nregimen, the craving for starches, the decrease in weight from the\r\nlimitation of diet, have made them profoundly miserable. Their\r\nfeelings have been translated into the definite conclusion that the\r\ndisease must still be making progress since they feel so miserable,\r\nand they have suffered more from their mental state than from their\r\ndiabetes.\r\n\r\nThis is as true of physicians themselves when they are sufferers from\r\ndiabetes as of ordinary patients. Indeed, it seems that physicians\r\nmake themselves more profoundly miserable because of their supposed\r\nknowledge of the disease than other people do. I have had the\r\nconfidences of more than a dozen physicians who were sufferers from\r\ndiabetes, and all of them admitted that they had suffered more from\r\ntheir scare over the disease and from trying to maintain a sugar-free\r\ndiet than from the effects of their ailment. The lowering of nutrition\r\nreacts upon the nervous system, already laboring under the strain of\r\nthe persuasion that an incurable disease is present, and the\r\nconsequence is a whole series of nervous and often mental symptoms,\r\nespecially of the depressive kind, that still further disturbs\r\ndigestion, interferes with peristalsis, causes constipation or\r\nalternate constipation and diarrhea, leads to wakefulness at night,\r\ninability to concentrate attention and a constant state of worry. All\r\nthis reacts upon the system and further increases the diabetes, that\r\nis, the inability to use sugar properly, and adds to its elimination\r\nthrough the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Suggestion.--Just as soon as these patients realize that\r\npeople have often had considerable quantities of sugar--two per cent.\r\nor more--in their urine for years without serious consequences and\r\nthat most diabetics die, not from the affection itself, but from\r\nintercurrent disease, the reassurance of mind which ensues makes their\r\nnervous system cease to be a factor in the further disturbance of\r\nmetabolism and they are able to consume more starch and sugar without\r\nincreasing the amount of sugar in their urine. This is not true, of\r\ncourse, for the severe diabetes that attacks young people. These run a\r\nrather rapid course and usually end in from one to two years in\r\ndiabetic coma or some complication connected directly with the\r\ndiabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDanger of Over-treatment.--To strive to keep the urine of diabetic\r\npatients free or nearly free from sugar is practically always sure to\r\nproduce a serious effect upon general nutrition and to disturb the\r\npatient's mind and nervous system. Very often, however, an attempt of\r\nthis kind is made. Doctors who suffer from diabetes are too prone to\r\nwatch their urine carefully from day to day and this only emphasizes\r\ntheir solicitude about themselves, impairs their digestion, and\r\nproduces such preoccupation of mind that all their functions are sure\r\nto be disturbed. After a time they learn that their general condition\r\nis a more important question than the amount of sugar in their urine.\r\nIf they can maintain their weight with reasonable freedom from the\r\nsecondary symptoms of diabetes, then the primary symptom--the amount\r\nof sugar in the urine--may be almost or quite neglected.\r\n\r\n{498}\r\n\r\nInterval Treatment.--Van Norden has pointed out that if diabetic\r\npatients are occasionally made to observe for a couple of weeks at a\r\ntime an absolute diet, these intervals seem to form a new\r\nstarting-point for metabolism and enable the patient to increase his\r\npower of utilizing sugar and consequently to diminish his pathological\r\nelimination of it. Patients look forward with interest to these\r\nperiods, provided that in the intervals they are allowed a certain\r\namount of starch; and each one of them seems a landmark on the road to\r\nrecovery. There is a strong element of suggestion in this that acts\r\nvery favorably and greatly influences the actual power of such\r\nintermissions to help nature recover her lost metabolic faculties.\r\nThis is certainly a better method of treatment than the attempt to\r\nkeep up an absolute diet which so easily produces the other evil of\r\nnervousness that adds to the diabetes, so that there is question of\r\nchoosing between two evils, and the lesser evil includes particularly\r\nthe reassurance of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Individual in Diabetes.--While diabetes is a question of\r\nglycosuria and usually of hyperglykemia, and the consumption of any\r\nform of cane sugar or of starch convertible into it, will usually\r\nincrease the diabetic tendency, not all the forms of starch which may\r\nchange into cane sugar have the same effect in all individuals or\r\nundergo the same modifications. Some patients, for instance, stand\r\nmilk better than others and may take large quantities of it so that\r\nthere is less craving for starchy foods. Most patients can take\r\npotatoes better than bread even when there is the same equivalent of\r\nstarch in each. Those who have been accustomed to potatoes from their\r\nearly years sometimes stand them well and may be able to take them\r\nalmost with impunity. I have noted in several cases that the Irish and\r\nScotch, accustomed to oatmeal from their early years, seem to be able\r\nto take notable quantities of this food when suffering from diabetes\r\nwithout having a marked increase of sugar in the urine.\r\n\r\nThere are forms of sugar that satisfy the craving of patients for\r\nsweets and may be taken in considerable quantities without seriously\r\ndisturbing metabolism. Honey is one of these, its sugar occurring in\r\nthe form of mannite, and there are other substances related to it that\r\nprobably can be employed to advantage. It must not be forgotten that\r\nwhat seems to be sugar in the urine of certain patients, that is,\r\ngrape sugar, has proved on more careful investigation to be one of the\r\nother chemical forms of sugar. We have a number of cases of pentosuria\r\non record in which patients were excreting penatomic sugar, but had\r\nnot glycosuria, though their urine responded to the ordinary tests for\r\nthis. It seems well not only to be sure of the diagnosis in these\r\ncases, but to use what we have learned to make patients feel that\r\ntheir condition though not curable is by no means hopeless. Care must\r\nbe exercised to take advantage of every possible individual\r\npeculiarity for reassurance, for the extension of the diet in any\r\npossible way, and for the satisfaction of the cravings which are so\r\nlikely to come to these patients. Some of their craving is really due\r\nto the suggestion that they cannot have a particular article of diet.\r\nWhenever any human being knows that he cannot have a thing, the liking\r\nfor it grows by suggestion and then it may become an obsession. To be\r\nallowed even small quantities of it is often enough to enable patients\r\nto overcome this and at least put them in a better state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Condition.--The most important element in the treatment of\r\n{499} the less severe cases of diabetes is exercise in the open air.\r\nWhatever the ultimate solution of the mystery of diabetes may be,\r\nthere is no doubt but that the muscles are an important factor in our\r\ndisposal of sugar within the body. The material which is burned up in\r\nthe muscles during movement is a form of sugar derived directly from\r\nthe starch and sugar ingested. When diabetics exercise freely much\r\nmore of their sugar is consumed within the body and much less of it\r\neliminated through the kidneys than when very little or no exercise is\r\ntaken. It is interesting to note the difference in the amount of sugar\r\nin the urine when patients are taking abundant exercise and when they\r\nare taking practically none. Even on a much more liberal diet the\r\npercentage of sugar is likely to be less in the exercising patient.\r\nOne of the results of the diabetic scare is likely to be almost a\r\ncessation of muscular exercise. This is partly due to the fact that\r\none of the results of diabetes in many cases is a sense of fatigue in\r\nthe muscles on comparatively little exertion. Indeed, this is\r\nsometimes the first symptom that is noted and that calls the attention\r\nof the patient to the fact that there is something seriously wrong\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThis occurs when there is a serious disturbance of sugar metabolism so\r\nthat the patient who consumes large amounts of starch and sugar is\r\nexcreting most of it. Just as soon as the diet is made a little more\r\nrigid and the sugar metabolism improves, then exercise can be taken\r\nand will benefit the patient. This is particularly true of women\r\nsuffering from diabetes whose depression on being told that they are\r\nsuffering from an incurable disease tempts them to remain within\r\ndoors; the frequent tendency to urination further adds to their\r\ndisinclination to go out. Under these circumstances they lose their\r\nappetites, do not sleep well, and become highly nervous, thus\r\nincreasing their diabetic tendency. If they are required to go out and\r\ntake exercise in the open air and rather long riding or walking\r\nperiods every day, their general health will at once improve and the\r\ndiabetes will become more manageable. I have seen this happen without\r\nexception even in patients well beyond middle age, and I am convinced\r\nthat it is the diversion of mind as well as the salutary tiredness and\r\nthorough oxidation consequent upon outdoor exercise that is the best\r\npossible remedial measure for these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolicitude.--It is important that diabetic patients should not be\r\nbothered by frequent reports upon their urine. Their improvement and\r\nthe reduction of the amount of sugar excreted is at best but slow, and\r\nis subject to many variations. While improvements, especially at the\r\nbeginning, are sources of great encouragement, the deteriorations that\r\nare likely to be rather more frequent are prone to overweigh the good\r\neffects and eventual discouragement results. It is not from the urine\r\nbut from the general condition that the improvement in the diabetic\r\ncondition is to be judged. So long as the patient feels strong, gains\r\nin weight (when they do not belong to the obesity type of diabetes),\r\nthe diabetes itself is almost sure to be improving, even though there\r\nmay be discouraging periods as regards the amount of sugar eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDangers of Rigid Diet--There are more dangers in a rigid diet than in\r\na certain amount of liberty in the consumption of starches and sugars.\r\nThe craving for these becomes so strong as to make life intolerable to\r\nmany people unless a certain amount of these substances is allowed. It\r\nis rather easy to manage limitation while it is almost impossible to\r\nbe sure that {500} patients will practice absolute denial. Besides,\r\nthe almost complete absence of starches and sugars, even though their\r\nplace is supplied by the fats, always seems to predispose patients to\r\nthe development of the acid intoxication which results in the coma\r\noften so serious an incident of diabetes. It is for this reason\r\nparticularly that mild diet regulations are clinically more judicious\r\nthan the absolute denial which on chemical and physiological grounds\r\nseems to be the scientific ideal. A rather good therapeutic method is\r\nto have the patients maintain a rigid diet for some ten, fifteen or\r\ntwenty days and then leave them practically without restrictions for\r\nthe rest of the month. Continuous restriction of diet becomes\r\nappalling. Looking forward to a period when they can eat as other\r\npeople do relieves the tedium, and makes it much easier to keep the\r\nrestrictions. The mental influence of this moderate treatment is very\r\nfavorable and encourages the patients in the thought that after all\r\ntheir disease is not so serious. This is the most important element in\r\npsychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGRAVES' DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nGraves' disease, sometimes called Basedow's disease, though the Irish\r\nphysician has a right to the name by priority, is often called\r\nexophthalmic goitre, because this term is descriptive of the two most\r\nmarked symptoms. It must not be forgotten, however, that there are\r\ncases in which there is no exophthalmos and even no goitre, at least\r\nno enlargement of the thyroid gland that can be demonstrated\r\nexternally. It is said that in these cases there must be an\r\nenlargement of the thyroid bound down by fascia and concealed by other\r\nstructures of the neck so that it does not appear externally. It is\r\nprobable, however, that there are cases of true Graves' disease\r\nwithout enlargement of the thyroid yet with the characteristic tremor,\r\nrapid heart and the mental symptoms of the affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--The symptoms of the affection often develop after a period\r\nof excitement or worry, or at critical times in life, if sorrow or\r\nmisfortune proves a burden. Responsibility sometimes has a like\r\neffect. I have seen a woman patient on several occasions in the last\r\nfifteen years develop marked symptoms of Graves' disease when she was\r\nplaced in a position of responsibility involving worry, while in the\r\nintervals when pursuing a simple ordinary life without trouble of mind\r\nno symptoms were present. Occasionally a fright seems to be at least a\r\npredisposing cause for the development of the symptoms. Emotional\r\nstrains, mental stresses, play a large part in occasioning Graves'\r\ndisease, though the cause of it is probably deeper in some structural\r\ndefect. In recent years nearly all the medical attention has become\r\nconcentrated on the idea that the disease is primarily due to\r\nhyperthyroidization. More detailed study, however, has shown that\r\nother ductless glands are probably also concerned in the etiology. The\r\nadrenals particularly seem to be associated closely with the thyroid\r\nand Graves' disease may be due to some disturbance of the\r\nco-ordination between these glandular systems. The thymus gland is\r\nusually {501} persistent in these cases and this must represent\r\nsomething in the affection and at one time the use of thymus substance\r\nfor therapeutic purposes seemed to confirm this idea. The parathyroids\r\nhave also been called into question and their use in therapeusis seems\r\nto justify this to some extent, though probably we know too little\r\nabout them to be able to say anything definite in the matter.\r\n\r\nEven though the affection may be due directly to hypersecretion of the\r\nthyroid, it is possible that the mental and nervous state may be\r\nclosely concerned in the etiology. Some patients have had an enlarged\r\nthyroid for years, without any symptoms of Graves' disease. Then\r\nduring a time of stress and worry or anxiety and responsibility\r\nsymptoms of the affection develop. The circulation of the thyroid is\r\nunder the control of the cervical sympathetic. It is possible that\r\nthis may be affected by states of mind to such an extent as to cause\r\nan increase of the circulation in the thyroid and as a consequence\r\nmore of the thyroid secretion may get into the blood stream and\r\nproduce its effect. Under these circumstances anything that would\r\nallay the excited mental condition and thus neutralize the unfavorable\r\neffect of the cervical sympathetic would cure or at least relieve\r\nGraves' disease.\r\n\r\nThe affection is about five times as frequent among women as it is\r\namong men. This has sometimes been attributed to the fact that there\r\nseems to be some more or less direct correlation between the sex\r\norgans in women and the ductless gland systems. It has often been\r\npointed out that the thyroid is likely to be engorged at the time of\r\nmenstruation and, indeed, there are those who have attributed some of\r\nthe symptoms of tremulousness, irritability, and tiredness at this\r\ntime to over-functioning of the gland. In women who have borne a child\r\nthe thyroid is usually somewhat enlarged. Good authorities in\r\nobstetrics have insisted that they could pick out of a group of women\r\nin evening dress, those who had borne children, from the appearance of\r\ntheir necks. Probably this is an exaggeration, but there is no doubt\r\nthat the thyroid is intimately related to the genital functions in\r\nwomen. It has been said that a direct connection could be traced\r\nbetween disappointments in love or in sexual matters and the\r\ndevelopment of Graves' disease. To put much stress on this would\r\neasily lead to mistaken conclusions, though it represents a principle\r\nthat should be recalled in certain cases of the affection. The\r\nfrequency with which slighter disturbances of the thyroid occur in\r\nconnection with the common genital incidents of female life and their\r\ncomparative insignificance for health or strength, should make for the\r\nholding of a not too serious prognosis in the affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology.--There are four cardinal symptoms of the disease:\r\nrapid heart action, tremor, enlargement of the thyroid, and\r\nexophthalmos. At least two of these are largely dependent on mental\r\ninfluences. There are certain accompanying symptoms that are of\r\nimportance and supposed to be connected directly with the disease,\r\nthough oftener they can be traced to the influence of the state of the\r\npatient's mind upon the organism. Emaciation is common. It is due to\r\nthe fact that the appetite is likely to be seriously disturbed by\r\nanxiety and solicitude. Anemia develops as a consequence and there may\r\nbe slight fever which is sometimes inanition fever. Attacks of\r\nvomiting and diarrhea occur intermittently and sometimes there is\r\nconstipation. The disturbance of eating consequent upon the affections\r\nseems largely {502} responsible for these. The disturbance of the\r\nvascular system gives rise to flashes of heat and cold and often to\r\nprofuse perspiration. Certain of the symptoms of the menopause can be\r\ncompared rather strikingly with those of Graves' disease and have been\r\nattributed to the disturbance of the external secretion of the ovaries\r\nwhich are now known to act as ductless glands as well as genital\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the enlargement of the thyroid and the\r\nexophthalmos, all of the symptoms of Graves' disease are of a kind\r\nthat can be produced in states of excitement with nothing more present\r\nthan a functional neurotic condition. It is true that the tremor is\r\ncharacteristic and differs from that of hysterical patients, being\r\nfiner and at the rate of a little more than eight to the second. The\r\nrapid heart action, however, and the disturbance of the general\r\ncirculation which causes flushing and pruritus and the sense of\r\nnervousness, as if the patients were in a constant state of fright,\r\nare always characteristically neurotic. The changes in disposition,\r\noften in the line of irritability, sometimes with severe mental\r\ndepression, seem in many cases to be only a mental reaction to the\r\npatient's solicitude. The weakness of the limbs which sometimes\r\namounts to a giving away of the legs, is connected with the tremor,\r\nbut seems to be neurotic rather than of any more serious character. In\r\nspite of all our study of the affection its place among the neuroses\r\nmust still be reserved for it, at least as regards many cases, and its\r\ntreatment must be conducted with that idea in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis.--The disease is easy to recognize when fully developed. At\r\nthe beginning of cases, however, and in certain abortive types of the\r\naffection which the French have called _formes frustes_, the diagnosis\r\nmay be difficult. Usually the first symptom is tremor and this of\r\nitself will often serve, especially in association with general\r\nsymptoms of nervousness, to make the diagnosis. Tremor with\r\ntachycardia puts the case beyond doubt, as a rule, though of course it\r\nmust not be forgotten that hysteria may simulate rather closely this\r\nmuch of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe abortive types of the affection are important because they\r\nmasquerade as forms of psychoneurosis, hysteria, and the like, though\r\nthe patients are not suggestible, have very definite, not variable,\r\nsymptoms and get better and worse according to the variations in the\r\nunderlying affection. Occasionally they seem to be associated with\r\ncertain other forms of neurotic conditions, especially those with\r\nvascular disturbances. There may be tinglings in the ends of the\r\nfingers, occasionally with suffusion, erythromelalgia--Weir Mitchell's\r\ndisease--and even a tendency to the white \"dead fingers\" as the French\r\ncall them, of Raynaud's disease. It seems not unlikely that further\r\nstudy will show that many of these affections involving disturbances\r\nof the vasomotor system are connected in some special way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis in Young Patients.--Some of the cases, especially in young\r\npeople, are likely to seem quite discouraging and apparently to\r\njustify even a serious operation. I have in mind a young woman seen\r\nsome fifteen years ago when she was about seventeen. The prominence of\r\nthe eyes, the enlargement of the thyroid, the tremor and the rapid\r\nheart were all marked. The symptoms had been growing worse for over a\r\nyear and the outlook was serious. Ten years later I saw her in another\r\ncity in perfectly normal health, married and happy and the mother of\r\ntwo healthy children. The only trace {503} apparently of the\r\ndisturbance of the thyroid to be noted in the family was that her\r\nchildren got their teeth very late, her first child, a boy, not\r\ncutting his first tooth until after he was fifteen months old. In\r\nevery other way, however, the boy was perfectly well, rugged and\r\nstrong, having passed through his summers without any serious\r\ndisturbance and not being a particularly nervous or excitable child.\r\nSuch complete relief from symptoms after the condition had been so\r\ngrave would ordinarily have seemed quite out of the question. It\r\nemphasizes the fact that for Graves' disease as it occurs among young\r\ngrowing people, where perhaps the thyroid does not grow in proper\r\nproportion to the rest of the body, but for some reason overgrows, the\r\nprognosis of the case may seem to be much worse than it really is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The story of the various methods of treatment that have\r\nbeen reported as successful for Graves' disease serve to show very\r\nwell how much the affection must depend upon psychic and neurotic\r\nconditions, for most of them have been positive in action at the\r\nbeginning when their suggestive influence was strong, and quite inert\r\nafter they had lost their novelty and their power to influence the\r\nmind. Sometimes even slight operations as on the nose, the removal of\r\npolyps, or of a spur on the septum, or an enlarged turbinate, have\r\nbeen found to bring relief of the symptoms of Graves' disease even in\r\nmarked cases. Operations upon the tonsils have had a like effect and\r\neven shortening of the uvula has been reported as curative. A\r\ngeneration ago applications of iodin to the goiter were reported to\r\nhave good effects. In lancing the goiter, sometimes evidently a cyst\r\nwas punctured, but sometimes the lance was only followed by a slight\r\nissue of blood, yet the affection was favorably modified. More serious\r\noperations have followed by complete relief of symptoms for a time,\r\nthough relapses are not infrequent and occasionally the patient was\r\nnot relieved, though apparently all the conditions present were\r\nsimilar to those of other patients in whom the operation produced\r\nexcellent results.\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of Graves' disease demonstrates interestingly\r\nthe power of suggestion. About fifteen years ago a distinguished\r\nEnglish observer announced that he was getting good results in the\r\ntreatment of Graves' disease by the administration of thyroid\r\nsubstance. At that time our present theories with regard to\r\nhyperthyroidization as the etiology of the affection had not been\r\nformulated, though some vague connection between the thyroid secretion\r\nand the symptoms had been accepted. A number of patients were improved\r\nby taking thyroid. Other observers found, however, that not only were\r\ntheir patients not improved, but they seemed to be worse as the result\r\nof the thyroid feeding. The English physician therefore was asked to\r\nsay exactly how he obtained his material and prepared it for his\r\npatients. Organo-therapy was then new and it was found that the orders\r\ngiven to the butcher for thyroid had been filled by him according to\r\nthe directions by furnishing portions of a large gland situated in the\r\nneck of the calf. This was the thymus, and not the thyroid. Thymus was\r\nthen deliberately used for a while and there were some reported good\r\nsuccesses while the treatment was new and strongly suggestive. After a\r\ntime it proved to be of no avail.\r\n\r\nA number of biological remedies were tried after this. Personally,\r\nafter having made some studies of the parathyroids while in Virchow's\r\nlaboratory, I resolved to try material from those glands. The first\r\ntwo patients to whom {504} the material was given, with a careful\r\nexplanation of the theory on which it was administered, proceeded to\r\nobtain relief from their symptoms and an intermission in their\r\ndisease. Just as soon as I purposely omitted to explain to patients\r\nhow much might be expected from this new remedy and failed to make\r\nsuggestions founded on the parathyroids, no improvement was noted. In\r\nthe first two cases this had been more or less necessary in order to\r\ndetermine whether the patients could stand the doses suggested, which\r\nbegan very low and were gradually increased. The material seemed to\r\nhave no ill effects, however, and a definite dosage could be used\r\nwithout the necessity of taking patients into one's confidence.\r\n\r\nA number of serums of one kind or another were reported as beneficial\r\nfor Graves' disease. It was admitted that they did not benefit all the\r\ncases, but that in certain cases they did much good. Practically all\r\nof these were strikingly more efficient in their discoverers' hands\r\nthan when used by anyone else. Thyroids were removed from animals and\r\nafter some time serum from these animals, supposed to be of lower\r\nthyroid content, was injected into human beings with the idea of\r\nreducing the hyperthyroidization or perhaps neutralizing it by some\r\nsubstance present in the serum. One very interesting observation on\r\nmost of these cases deserves remark. The animals deprived of their\r\nthyroids, such as goats and sheep, lived on absolutely unhurt by the\r\noperation, and as one experimenter expressly noted, sold for more\r\nmoney after being kept for a year under observation than they had cost\r\nhim before dethyroidization.\r\n\r\nMost of our biological remedies for Graves' disease then are strongly\r\nreminiscent of the therapy of the affection in older times. It was\r\nparticularly for Graves' disease, or at least for nervous symptoms\r\nclosely resembling Graves' disease--those of fright, nervousness,\r\nirritability and tremor--that various more or less terrifying\r\nprocedures and particularly deterrent substances were employed in\r\nmedicine. These patients, for instance, were cured by the touch of a\r\nhanged criminal, and particularly by the touch of their goiter to the\r\nmark on his neck. It was especially for them that _Usnea_, the moss\r\ngathered from the skull of a criminal who had been hanged, was of\r\nbenefit when administered internally. Mummy as a remedial substance\r\nremained in common use until well on into the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century in England.\r\n\r\nIn older times a dead snake wrapped around the neck was said to be an\r\nexcellent remedy for goiter and especially those cases of goiter that\r\ncaused symptoms of fright and nervousness. Evidently anything that\r\nproduces a strong effect upon the patient's mind may prove helpful.\r\nPerhaps the suggestion enables the mind to control the cervical\r\nsympathetic and by that means the circulation in the thyroid gland,\r\nthus lessening the amount of blood that flows through and therefore\r\nthe amount of secretion that is carried out. There is no doubt but\r\nthat the sympathetic is largely under the influence of the emotions\r\nand that through it very important effects may be worked out in\r\nvarious structures. There seems no other possible explanation for the\r\nuniformly reported success of remedies when their suggestive power is\r\nstrong and their failure quite as invariably later even in the same\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Operations_.--In recent years operations for the removal of portions\r\nof the enlarged thyroid have become popular and some very successful\r\nresults have been reported. Those of us who know how easy it is to\r\ninfluence the minds of {505} patients in Graves' disease favorably\r\nhesitate as yet to pronounce definitely with regard to the indication\r\nfor operation except under such conditions of pressure in the neck or\r\nprojection of the eyeballs as may lead to serious symptoms. Not all\r\nthe operators have been as successful as some who made a specialty of\r\nthe affection. I have personal information which shows a number of\r\nunsuccessful cases after operation and the records of conservative\r\nsurgeons as published indicate this. Unfortunately, a great many cases\r\nhave been reported within a few months as cured; if they were\r\ncomparatively without symptoms, surgical intervention is considered to\r\nhave been eminently successful. For, be it noted, very few are\r\nentirely without symptoms, even after operation.\r\n\r\nDr. William H. Thompson in his book on \"Graves' Disease\" points out\r\nthat even so good an operator and so thoroughly conservative a surgeon\r\nas Kocher reports cases of Graves' disease as cured, which are still\r\nexhibiting symptoms that would make the medical clinician hesitate to\r\nagree with him and, indeed, rather lead him to expect that under the\r\nstress of worry and excitement there may be redevelopment of the\r\nsymptoms. As the number of cases operated upon has increased there has\r\nbeen a growing feeling that relapses might be expected in certain\r\ncases even after removal of large portions of the thyroid gland. The\r\nfact of the matter is that we do not understand as yet what is the\r\nunderlying pathological significance of the symptoms grouped under the\r\nterm Graves' disease. When there are severe symptoms, as extreme\r\nexophthalmos, greatly enlarged thyroid pressing upon the important\r\nneck structures, or serious disturbance of nutrition, an operation is\r\nalways needed; but as yet we cannot be sure that it will produce even\r\ncomplete or lasting relief.\r\n\r\nMany patients have been greatly benefited by operation, some of them\r\nperhaps permanently, but we need more of the after-history of these\r\npatients covering a long period of time, to be sure that the results\r\nflow entirely from the operation. There was a time when operations\r\nwere reported as doing quite as much good for epilepsy as they are now\r\nfor Graves' disease. As we have pointed out, a number of operative\r\nprocedures that had nothing to do with the underlying basic pathology\r\nof the disease have proved the occasion for considerable improvement\r\nor sometimes what might be called a cure for a prolonged period. We\r\ncan be sure, as a rule, that patients will be benefited immediately\r\nafter operations. The rest, with care, the strong suggestion, the\r\naroused feeling of expectancy, the confidence in the surgeon, all this\r\nwould do much of itself. It remains to be seen how much more than this\r\nthe operation does.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Condition_.--The treatment of patients suffering from Graves'\r\ndisease consists largely in having them take up some occupation that,\r\nwhile reasonably absorbing, does not make too great a demand upon\r\nthem. Often when they complain most of their symptoms they are below\r\nnormal weight and the first indication is to have them brought back to\r\nit. I have seen such cases over and over again almost entirely without\r\nsymptoms when they were up to normal weight and with a good many\r\nsymptoms when they were below normal. It would be easy to theorize as\r\nto why this is so, but the observation is the most important\r\nconsideration for practical purposes, and we are not yet in possession\r\nof enough scientific knowledge with regard to the thyroid or {506} its\r\npossible connection with other organs that have an internal secretion,\r\nto be able to say anything definite about it.\r\n\r\nAfter weight and nutrition the most important indication is sleep. It\r\nis impossible for patients to get along with less than eight or nine\r\nhours of sleep. Most of them are much better if they have nine or ten\r\nevery night. Late hours are particularly prejudicial to them. They are\r\ntired if they have been on their feet all day and they should be\r\nencouraged to take more sleep than others. Sleep is one of the most\r\nimportant considerations for sufferers from the abortive forms of\r\nGraves' disease and they must be encouraged to take it in the quantity\r\nthat they need. This can only be decided by their feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diversion of Mind_.--Much more than other nervous people these\r\npatients need encouragement and require diversion of mind. They are\r\nprone to be discouraged, rather tired, and easily tempt themselves\r\ninto a routine in which there is little recreation and no diversion.\r\nFor them more than for most other patients it is necessary to\r\nprescribe that twice every week they shall have some engagement\r\ndifferent from their ordinary routine to which they look forward for\r\nseveral days. This looking forward to a break in the routine does much\r\nto make life more livable for them and must be encouraged in every\r\nway. As to what the diversion is to be must depend entirely on the\r\ncharacter of the individual. Some find complete diversion of mind in\r\nthe theater or even in vaudeville. Others are bored by this after a\r\nwhile and need other recreations. I have known people who were bored\r\nby the theater find an evening a week spent in helping a poor person\r\nor an afternoon devoted to a visit to a hospital ward or to an ailing\r\nfriend an excellent diversion. Some of those who do not care for the\r\ntheater like music and are helped by it. As a rule, however, one must\r\nbe careful about the indulgence of music for neurotic people since it\r\nseems to exert a serious emotional strain on many of them and as the\r\nphrase goes \"takes a good deal out of them.\" This is particularly true\r\nfor younger people who have a passion for music. Older people may be\r\ntrusted more in this matter and the attendance on concert and opera,\r\nwhich is looked upon as a social duty by some, giving them an\r\nopportunity to greet friends and to display their gowns and jewels, is\r\na harmless diversion of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Treatment_.--Graves' disease is, then, as we have said,\r\nespecially likely to be influenced by the patient's state of mind.\r\nNothing disturbs patients more than the declaration sometimes made by\r\nphysicians that their condition is incurable or that they will have to\r\ndoctor for it for many years. This must be avoided because our present\r\nknowledge does not justify any such positive declarations. Most cases\r\nof Graves' disease, while not particularly amenable to treatment by\r\nspecific drugs, are very much improved if the patient's general health\r\nis brought up to the best standard and if all sources of worry and\r\nemotion are eliminated, as far as possible. Nothing is more serious\r\nfor them, however, than the suggestion that they will not get well.\r\nProbably no one has ever seen a mild case of Graves' disease that did\r\nnot improve so much as to be practically well after the lapse of some\r\ntime. Recurrences take place, but if all sources of worry and\r\nirritation of the digestive tract and over-tiredness are removed, then\r\npatients will stay free from their symptoms for surprisingly long\r\nperiods. Old people do not have these {507} favorable remissions so\r\nmuch as the young, but under twenty there can be, as a rule, definite\r\npromise of decided improvement and sometimes of results that seem like\r\ncomplete cure. For patients under thirty there is every reason to\r\nthink that if they are in a run-down condition when the disease is\r\nfirst noted remissions of symptoms can be looked for lasting for long\r\nperiods, during which they will be comparatively well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diet Suggestions_.--The changes in diet necessary to bring\r\nimprovement in Graves' disease are different for individual patients.\r\nProf. Mendel, in Berlin, found in his extensive experience that meat\r\ndoes not seem to be disposed of well by these patients and acts\r\nsomewhat as an irritant. He reduces the meat taken and usually allows\r\nit at but one meal. If patients get on well as vegetarians, meat is\r\ngradually eliminated from their diet. On the other hand, there are\r\npatients who seem to develop Graves' disease during a vegetarian diet.\r\nVery often it will be found that there is an intermittent constipation\r\nand diarrhea in these cases, and that the bowels will act much better\r\nif a certain amount of meat is given, and then the symptoms of Graves'\r\ndisease remit, as a rule. As in most of the major neuroses, as is\r\nknown so well in epilepsy, any irritative condition of the digestive\r\ntract will surely revive neurotic manifestations and make many of the\r\nmajor neuroses much worse than they were before.\r\n\r\n\r\n{508}\r\n\r\nSECTION XV\r\n\r\n_ORGANIC NERVOUS DISEASES_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY OF ORGANIC NERVOUS DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we know that the basis of many nervous diseases is an\r\nobliteration of certain cells of the brain or of the spinal cord, or\r\ncertain tracts of the central nervous system through which impulses\r\nmust pass if they are to be effective as motion, sensation or function\r\nin some other form, we realize that we cannot recreate these portions\r\nof highly organized tissue and that therefore organic nervous diseases\r\nare beyond the action of any remedies we now know or may even hope to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nThe development of pathology has shown us that once there has been\r\nserious nephritis or cirrhosis of the liver certain portions of the\r\nglands are destroyed and therefore there cannot be any question of\r\ncure. There is no possibility of redintegration of destroyed tissues\r\nwhen they are of highly organized character, and so the patient will\r\nalways be maimed. One might as well talk of causing an amputated\r\nfinger to grow again as talk of curing diseases that involve\r\ndestruction of specialized cells. When this first dawned on modern\r\nmedicine as the result of the careful study of pathology a period of\r\ntherapeutic nihilism developed during which physicians trained in the\r\npathological schools were prone to distrust drugs entirely, or at\r\nleast to a very great degree. The effect of this wave of nihilism has\r\nnot entirely disappeared in our time, though we have learned that even\r\nwhere serious damage to an organ has been done by disease we may still\r\nhope to compensate for defect of tissue by stimulation of other organs\r\nand to replace its function by certain physiological remedies or\r\nbiological products; and if we can do nothing more, we can at least\r\nalleviate the symptoms which develop as a consequence of the organic\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature's Compensation.--Physicians are prone to forget nature's\r\nwonderful powers of compensation. Apparently even some regeneration\r\nmay take place in diseased organs of highly organized type if the\r\npatient's general condition is kept up to its highest point of\r\nnutritive efficiency. How far this may go we do not know, but\r\nobservations show some marvelous examples of unexpected regeneration.\r\n\r\nThese counteracting processes can be stimulated sometimes by drugs,\r\nbut oftener they can be best brought into play by keeping the patient\r\nin just as good condition of body and favorable condition of mind as\r\npossible for a prolonged period, so that nature accustoms herself to\r\nthe defect and her powers of compensation have full play.\r\n\r\n{509}\r\n\r\nUnfavorable Suggestion.--What is true of organic diseases of all kinds\r\nis especially true of organic nervous diseases, and in spite of the\r\nfact that most of these are essentially incurable, so much can be done\r\nfor patients that their condition is made more tolerable and indeed\r\nsome of them improved to such an extent that they consider themselves\r\nquite relieved of their organic affection. One of the most serious\r\nburdens that the patient laboring under an organic nervous disease has\r\nto suffer is the consciousness drummed into him by successive\r\nphysicians, by his reading, and by every possible means of suggestion,\r\nthat his malady is incurable. This makes every symptom as severe in\r\nits effects as it can possibly be. Hope does not buoy up and\r\ndiscouragement weighs down every effort of the organism to compensate\r\nfor the serious defect under which it is laboring. Nothing can be done\r\nfor the disease itself, but much can be done for the patient. Many of\r\nthe symptoms from which the patient suffers most are really due to his\r\nown discouragement, to that sluggish condition which develops in his\r\nbody as a consequence of his lack of hope, to the absence of exercise\r\nand of air and of diversion of mind consequent upon the gloom that\r\nsettles over him when he is told that his condition is incurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adventitious Symptoms_.--If the adventitious symptoms that are always\r\npresent in cases of organic nervous disease are eliminated, if the\r\nconditions which develop from the unhygienic condition in which the\r\npatient lives because of his discouragement and retirement are\r\nremoved, as a rule he feels so much better that it is hard to persuade\r\nhim that some change has not come in his underlying nervous disease\r\nand that a process of cure is not at work. It is because of this that\r\nirregular practitioners so often succeed in apparently doing much more\r\nfor these patients than the regular physician. The irregular does not\r\ninsist on the incurability of the disease, but, on the contrary, he\r\npromises a cure. He then proceeds to relieve many bothersome symptoms\r\nthat are quite extraneous to the underlying disease, but thus makes\r\nthe patient ever so much more comfortable than before, gives a\r\ncheerful air to his life for a time, makes him sleep better as a\r\nconsequence and it is not surprising that the patient thinks that his\r\ndisease has been bettered, if not cured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestive Prophylaxis.--While we are optimistic just as far as\r\npossible since genuine nervous disease has declared itself, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that we can by suggestion and warning often prevent\r\nor delay the development of nervous degenerations. This, too, is\r\npsychotherapy and must be employed wherever it seems advisable.\r\n\r\nPost-syphilitic nervous conditions of so many kinds are likely to\r\ndevelop that it is important to warn the patients who are sufferers\r\nfrom this disease from taking up the more strenuous forms of\r\nexistence. This may seem an exaggerated view of the condition, but it\r\nis amply justified by the results of the opposite rule of life in\r\nalmost any physician's experience in city practice. A man who has had\r\nsyphilis must be warned of the danger, one may almost say likelihood,\r\nif he takes up any of the professions in which there is much mental\r\nstrain and nervous worry, that he will almost surely not live out the\r\nnormal span of life without some serious nervous incident. Locomotor\r\nataxia, and, above all, general paralysis develop, as a rule, in men\r\nwho, having had syphilis, have some occupation in life that calls for\r\nconsiderable mental strenuosity, and involves excitement and worry.\r\nActors, brokers, soldiers and sailors, speculators of all kinds,\r\nrace-track gamblers, these are the classes from {510} which victims of\r\nparesis and locomotor ataxia are particularly recruited. People who\r\nhave suffered from syphilis and who live the ordinary unemotional life\r\nof a teacher, or a merchant, or a writer, do not, as a rule, develop\r\nthe postsyphilitic and parasyphilitic conditions.\r\n\r\nPrecocious apoplexy is especially likely to occur in patients who have\r\nhad syphilis and who have then spent themselves at very hard work. I\r\ndoubt if hard work alone, without some such antecedent condition, ever\r\nproduces this result. Of course, it is not alone syphilis, but other\r\nserious conditions which affect the nervous system that ought to be\r\nguarded against in this same way. If there has ever been any affection\r\nof the kidneys, as a complication, for instance, of scarlet fever,\r\nthen it has always seemed to me to be the duty of the family physician\r\nto warn such patients that their kidneys are more prone than those who\r\nhave not suffered from such an incident to break down under any severe\r\nstrain that may be put upon them by worry, especially worry following\r\na period of strenuous work. In these cases the affection of the\r\nkidneys nearly always makes itself felt in the nervous system, and\r\nespecially in the brain, and so this warning has a proper place here.\r\nWhere there has been severe cerebro-spinal meningitis this warning\r\nseems also to be needful, though here our records have not been kept\r\nwith sufficient care to enable us to speak positively of the necessity\r\nfor the warning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--It is important to remember that as physicians we do not\r\ntreat disease but patients. We _care_ for patients, that is the real\r\netymological significance of the Latin _curare_, we do not cure\r\ndiseases in the modern sense that has come to be given to that term,\r\nof completely removing the _materies morbi_ and setting the patient on\r\nhis feet once more just as well as he was before his illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relieving Incurable Disease_.--A new cure for locomotor ataxia, for\r\ninstance, is announced every now and then, and the evidence for its\r\nbeneficial action is the testimony of patients who have been relieved\r\nof many symptoms that they thought connected directly with their\r\nspinal affection. All sorts of remedies have been employed with\r\nannounced success. One man builds a particular kind of shoe for them\r\nand has a number of witnesses to his skill in curing them. Another\r\ndoes some slight operation on their nose or their throat or their\r\nurethra and straightway the patient feels so much better that he talks\r\nconfidently about being cured. All the characteristic symptoms of the\r\naffection remain. Their knee-jerks are gone, their pupils do not react\r\nnormally, they have some incoordination in their walk, but a number of\r\nother symptoms have disappeared and their walk is probably much\r\nimproved because of their confidence and a certain amount of practice\r\nthat they have gone through. The new hope born of confident assurance\r\nthat they could be relieved gives them an appetite, makes their\r\ndigestion better. This lessens the sluggishness of their bowels, gives\r\nthem confidence to get out and see their friends, life takes on a new\r\nhope, they sleep better and it is no wonder they talk of having been\r\nhelped or even cured.\r\n\r\nThere is a definite relation between the nervous affection in these\r\ncases and many visceral symptoms. There is no doubt, for instance,\r\nthat certain cases of intractable dyspepsia are associated with tabes\r\nand that in nearly the same way obstinate constipation frequently\r\ndevelops. Notwithstanding the connection of these symptoms with an\r\nincurable condition of the spinal cord {511} that is no reason for\r\nthinking that they cannot be relieved even though no improvement of\r\nthe spinal-cord lesions is expected.\r\n\r\nFrequently, indeed, gastric dyspepsia is due more to worry over\r\ndiscomfort somewhere in the stomach region than to any real\r\ndisturbance of the digestive functions. It may then be considerably\r\nameliorated simply by the assurance that the trouble is local and is\r\nlocalized outside of the stomach itself, though there may be some\r\nsympathetic irritation of the gastric nerve supply. Probably Dr. Head\r\nand those who have studied reflexes so enthusiastically would not\r\nagree with this explanation of the relief of the gastric symptoms in\r\nsome of the cases they have described, as due rather to suggestion\r\nthan to the local treatment, and, as a matter of fact, we are not\r\nquite sure which factor may be the more important. Counter-irritation\r\nprobably plays quite an important role in the relief of discomfort,\r\nbut I am sure that the suggestive influence of acute sensory feelings\r\nat the surface produced by counter-irritation serves to divert the\r\nmind from the duller ache or the functional disturbance below.\r\nHowever, Dr. Head's paragraph should be given in his own words, for it\r\nfurnishes a scientific basis for one aspect of these cases.\r\n\r\n  Throughout the study of cases of nervous diseases, evidence of the\r\n  relation between pathological condition of certain viscera and\r\n  sensory disturbances in the superficial structures of the body is\r\n  constantly manifested. For instance, a man with caries of the spine\r\n  suffered from a girdle sensation round the area of the eighth dorsal\r\n  segment. At the same time he was greatly troubled by flatulent\r\n  dyspepsia which was untouched by drugs. It was, however, greatly\r\n  relieved by counter-irritation applied to the maximum tender point\r\n  of the eighth dorsal area in the eighth space and mid-axillary line.\r\n\r\n_Optimistic Suggestions_.--Our most prominent neurologists have in\r\nrecent years insisted on the necessity for encouraging patients and\r\nfor not permitting them to brood upon the worst side of what is to be\r\nexpected from their ailment. Patients are entirely too prone to read\r\nup about their disease and the worst symptoms of the extreme cases\r\nimpress their minds and are constantly recurring as suggestions of\r\npossible ills to come. Prof. Oppenheim in his \"Letters to Nervous\r\nPatients\" states in a striking way the optimistic view that it always\r\nseems advisable to give a patient in the initial stages of a serious,\r\nincurable or even progressive nervous disease. That letter is worth\r\nquoting:\r\n\r\n  I cannot conceal from you the fact, which you have already\r\n  ascertained from other sources, that you show the premonitory\r\n  symptoms of a disease of the spinal cord. This admission is not,\r\n  however, as you fear, synonymous with the sentence \"the beginning of\r\n  the end.\" There is no reason for you to despair. We doctors regard\r\n  and welcome it as a marked advance in our scientific knowledge that\r\n  we are now in a position to diagnose a nervous disease of this kind\r\n  in its first commencement. This is undoubtedly a great gain for the\r\n  patient, as on account of this knowledge a judicious, experienced\r\n  physician may, at least in many cases, by the timely regulation of\r\n  the mode of life and the prescription of certain remedies, arrest\r\n  the progress of the disease or retard its development. This advice\r\n  may, however, and should as a general rule, be given without the\r\n  patient himself being made aware of the diagnosis, for the ideas as\r\n  to the nature of this disease which prevail in lay circles, and\r\n  indeed among many doctors of the old school, arise from the\r\n  knowledge of the disease in its advanced and fully established form,\r\n  since it was only in this completely developed stage that it was\r\n  recognized. Then, indeed, its very noticeable symptoms were obvious\r\n  even to the uninitiated. This picture, sad enough indeed in itself,\r\n  was rendered still gloomier by {512} the misery and despair which\r\n  popular fancy has associated with the conception of locomotor\r\n  ataxia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arteriosclerosis_.--Even with regard to so serious a disease and, of\r\ncourse, absolutely fatal in its progress as arteriosclerosis, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that much can be done for the patients and especially\r\nfor the nervous symptoms that develop in connection with the\r\ncondition. For the progressive hardening of the arteries on which the\r\nnerve symptoms depend absolutely nothing can be done. A man is as old\r\nas his arteries, and we cannot bring back the years even though the\r\npatient has become prematurely old. For the symptoms so frequently\r\nseen in connection with arteriosclerosis, the paresthesia, the\r\nburnings, the numbness, the pruritus, the pains around joints and the\r\ndifficulties in connection with them, even for the intermittent\r\nclaudication which develops, much can be done. Above all, the patient\r\nmust not be allowed to cherish the notion that his disease is not only\r\nincurable, but that nothing can be done for it. It is inevitable and\r\nprogressive, but then according to one definition, life is a\r\nprogressive disease and every day brings us nearer death. \"Life is a\r\ndangerous thing at best,\" as an American humorist once said, \"and very\r\nfew of us get out of it alive.\"\r\n\r\nThese patients can be relieved of many physical symptoms, they can be\r\nencouraged, their attention can be diverted from their symptoms, and\r\nit is concentration of mind on them that often makes them intolerable,\r\nwhile occupation with something, especially if it is interesting, will\r\noften prove an efficient remedy for the discomforts complained of. Old\r\npeople who have no interests, who have retired from business, who did\r\nnot have the opportunity when young to acquire tastes in art and\r\nliterature, above all, those who have no interests in children, no\r\ngrandchildren nor close relatives near them, are likely to become\r\ncentered on their ills in the midst of their arteriosclerosis, and\r\nthis more than the advancing degeneration of arteries itself is at the\r\nroot of their symptoms. The ideal old age is that which is passed in\r\nthe midst of younger people, with an occasional happy hour during the\r\nday with children in whom one is deeply interested. This is the best\r\npsychotherapeutic factor that we have.\r\n\r\nProf. Oppenheim has given the optimistic side of arteriosclerosis so\r\nsuggestively that most patients suffering in this way should have the\r\nopportunity to read it. It occurs in his \"Letters to Nervous\r\nPatients\":\r\n\r\n  An eminent physician for whom I have much esteem has told you that\r\n  your troubles, especially your vertigo, are caused by calcification\r\n  of the arteries. You, sir, heard in this your death sentence, and\r\n  since then the encyclopedia has revealed to you all the sufferings\r\n  and terrors with which you may expect to be overtaken.\r\n\r\n  I would, however, explain to you, as the result of the most careful\r\n  examination and the most absolute conviction on my part, that your\r\n  anxiety is unfounded.\r\n\r\n  Since you have a certain amount of information and scientific\r\n  knowledge, I may speak to you upon this matter almost as a\r\n  colleague. One is certainly justified, when a man of your age\r\n  complains of vertigo, in suspecting calcification of the arteries to\r\n  be the cause of the trouble, since it constitutes the common senile\r\n  change, and vertigo forms one of its most frequent symptoms.\r\n  But--apart from the fact that in senile calcification of the vessels\r\n  this vertigo is frequently a temporary and not always a serious\r\n  sign--one is by no means justified in assuming that the appearance\r\n  of this symptom in later life is in itself, and without further\r\n  evidence, the sign of such a cause. This is an error which in my\r\n  experience is {513} far too frequently made, to the detriment of the\r\n  patient. It is first of all essential to closely examine and analyze\r\n  the symptom in itself. . . . Two years ago, after having overloaded\r\n  your stomach, you had a real attack of vertigo, which was repeated\r\n  several times during the day, until, by vomiting and diarrhea, the\r\n  contents of your stomach were evacuated. Since that time the fear of\r\n  vertigo has overpowered you. In my experience it is neither new nor\r\n  uncommon to find that a man who has shown his intrepidity and his\r\n  contempt of death on many a battlefield, who is a hero in war, may\r\n  be overcome by some dread of illness, by some anxiety, or even by\r\n  some pain, and may be distressed by it in a way that is in sharp\r\n  contrast to his whole personality. Your remembrance of that vertigo\r\n  is so lively that the mere idea of it suffices to reawaken the\r\n  symptom, or at least an imitation of it which very nearly approaches\r\n  the reality. That this idea is present in your case is quite certain\r\n  from the consideration of your symptoms. You admit that you almost\r\n  never have vertigo at home, but as soon as you leave the house, and\r\n  especially if you find yourself alone in the street far from home,\r\n  the remembrance of the vertigo comes over you, puts you into a state\r\n  of anxiety, and is followed by a sensation of tottering and swaying,\r\n  so that you have to stand still; and at last it has gone so far that\r\n  you no longer venture to go out alone. And so the hero of X sits\r\n  like a timid woman in his arm chair, making life bitter for himself\r\n  and for those around him.\r\n\r\n  Even were I to find that signs of arterial calcification were\r\n  present, I should still be satisfied that your vertigo is not due to\r\n  this cause, but that it is a vertigo of recollection and of fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL APOPLEXY\r\n\r\n\r\nCerebral apoplexy is an extremely serious organic disease that seems\r\nsurely to be an affection for which psychotherapeutics can mean little\r\nor nothing. When an artery has burst in the brain and blood is either\r\nactually flowing out or has flowed out in damaging quantities into the\r\ndelicate brain tissues, seriously injuring and perhaps destroying some\r\nof them forever, no amount of mental assurance will do any good for\r\nthe organic lesions that have been produced. All that can be hoped is\r\nthat the hemorrhage will not prove fatal and that the powers of nature\r\nwill be sufficient to deal with it, and though not able to cure it in\r\nthe sense of restoring tissues to former conditions, will compensate\r\nfor the lesion in some way and dispose of its products so effectually\r\nthat but little interference will result with nerve functions within\r\nthe skull.\r\n\r\nThere is no pretence that by psychotherapy or any appeal to mental\r\npowers anything can be done for the underlying pathological process.\r\nAnd it may be frankly said that no remedy of any kind, physical or\r\nmental, will avail much, while some of those that have been suggested\r\nare just as likely to do harm as good. Position, with the head\r\nelevated and quiet of mind and body are the only remedial measures\r\nthat promise definite help. Excitement greatly increases the danger.\r\nReassurance does more than anything else to lessen blood pressure and\r\nlessen also the danger of a hemorrhage producing fatal effects. In\r\nnervous, excitable people the first stroke is often fatal.\r\nOccasionally the phlegmatic have three or more ruptures of brain\r\narteries before death supervenes. Psychotherapy, then, has a definite\r\nrole even at the time of the apoplexy.\r\n\r\n{514}\r\n\r\nThe Mind Before and After.--Much can be accomplished for the patient\r\nby proper attention to his state of mind both before and after\r\ncerebral hemorrhage. There are many symptoms which point to the\r\npossible occurrence of the rupture of a cerebral artery, and older\r\npeople are likely to know something about these and to dread them so\r\nmuch that to some extent they may by worrying precipitate the evil\r\nthey fear. Many people, having read vaguely about apoplexy, having\r\nseen a case or two of it perhaps, and having heard of others, develop\r\na dread of its occurrence in themselves that makes them miserable.\r\nFinally, the shock of a cerebral hemorrhage is very great and its\r\nafter-effects likely to be very disturbing. It affects the whole\r\npersonality and often makes a strong, vigorous, healthy man a decided\r\nhypochondriac. All of these associated mental states may be greatly\r\nbenefitted by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nA number of neurotic symptoms are always added to whatever\r\nmanifestations of mind and the somatic system may develop as a\r\nconsequence of the cerebral apoplexy, and these are treated more\r\neffectually by mental reassurance than in any other way. Besides,\r\napoplexy confines people to the house who have often been vigorous and\r\nactive before, and this confinement with deprivation of exercise and\r\nair and consequent disturbance of appetite and digestive functions,\r\nacts as a serious factor in the production of neurotic symptoms. Tears\r\nand hysterical manifestation are not uncommon, and for these\r\npsychotherapy is the most important remedial measure.\r\n\r\nIn the period preceding true apoplexy there may be such symptoms as\r\npersistent headache with peculiar sensations in one hand. These\r\nsensations are variously described as creepy feelings or as of \"pins\r\nand needles,\" and occasionally as if the fingers and sometimes the arm\r\nwere asleep. The group of symptoms known as paresthesia are rather\r\ncommon as premonitory symptoms of cerebral apoplexy. When these are\r\ncombined with headache patients often become seriously disturbed and\r\nbegin to dread the occurrence of apoplexy. While these are premonitory\r\nsymptoms of cerebral hemorrhage in those whose arteries are\r\ndegenerated, patients must be made to understand that just because the\r\nfingers or hand or arm go to sleep occasionally, even though there may\r\nbe complaint of headache, these are not indications of impending\r\napoplexy unless other objective symptoms are present. Subjective\r\nsymptoms alone can never mean much as regards organic disease. It is\r\nparticularly neurotic individuals who are likely to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of their subjective sensations, who are also prone to be\r\nso solicitous about apoplexy that they work themselves into a state of\r\nfear with regard to it. Even children have their hands go to sleep\r\nrather frequently, and at all ages if the arms or legs are placed in\r\ncertain positions or under certain conditions of pressure, they are\r\nlikely to develop that numbness which ends in the prickly \"pins and\r\nneedles\" feeling that is spoken of as \"going to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosing Arterial Sclerosis.--Unless, then, some of the arteries at\r\nthe periphery of the body show signs of such degeneration as to\r\nindicate advanced arteriosclerosis, any subjective symptoms, no matter\r\nhow bothersome, must not be allowed to depress the patient. Usually\r\nthey mean nothing at all, and would pass quite unnoticed but for the\r\npatients' nervousness about themselves. If the temporal arteries are\r\nnot prominent and visibly thickened and tortuous, and this may be seen\r\nat a glance, the patient may be assured almost without more ado. If\r\nhis radial arteries on careful observation show no signs {515} of\r\ndegeneration, then it is extremely doubtful if there is sufficient\r\narterial change in the brain to justify a fear of arterial rupture. In\r\nexamining the radial artery it must not be forgotten that the pulse of\r\nnervous people, especially such as have exerted considerable mental\r\ncontrol over themselves in order to come and see a physician about\r\nwhat they think is a serious condition, is likely to be of high\r\ntension. When the artery is rolled under the finger, then it may seem\r\nthat there is some thickening in its walls, though it is only\r\nheightened blood pressure from emotion that causes the feeling. This\r\nhigh blood pressure may, of course, of itself be an indication of\r\ndanger whenever there is heart or kidney disease, but it often occurs\r\nas a passing event in nervous patients whose vasomotor control is so\r\ncapricious that arterial tension and blood pressure may change at very\r\nshort intervals as the result of excitement.\r\n\r\nIt may not be easy to obliterate the pulse in the usual way in many of\r\nthese cases and as a consequence the illusion of a thickened artery\r\nmay remain even when the vessel is quite normal. The important rule is\r\nto ascertain whether the artery is tortuous. Whenever there is\r\nthickening of the arterial wall the artery is lengthened as well as\r\nthickened. If the artery is not lengthened the degenerative changes in\r\nit are so slight, as a rule, as to be negligible. Indeed, the very\r\nbeginning of arteriosclerosis may thus be diagnosed. When this cannot\r\nbe found, patients may be completely reassured that their suggestive\r\nsymptoms have no significance as regards any possibility of cerebral\r\nhemorrhage from the ordinary causes of advancing years and arterial\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Differentiation_.--Occasionally such paresthesiae as have been\r\ndescribed especially when associated with headache, point to an\r\nintracranial growth, or to a developing syphilitic brain lesion, and\r\nthese must be carefully eliminated, but they constitute quite separate\r\nproblems which always present other accompanying symptoms that make\r\ndiagnosis possible once a suspicion as to the nature of the lesion is\r\naroused. Above all, these occur in much younger patients than are, as\r\na rule, the subjects of cerebral apoplexy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms.--_Dreads--Dizziness_.--There are other symptoms of which\r\npeople have heard as preliminary signs of brain hemorrhage which\r\noccasionally disturb them to a great degree and set up a set of dreads\r\nthat may be difficult to banish. Probably the one that is spoken\r\noftenest of is dizziness. There is no doubt that under certain\r\ncircumstances this may be a symptom of impending cerebral hemorrhage,\r\nespecially if it is accompanied by headache and by objective signs in\r\nthe arteries, but dizziness by itself is not enough to justify any\r\nanxiety in even elderly people. If, when a man stoops over and then\r\nstraightens up rapidly everything becomes black before him and he must\r\nimmediately take hold of something to keep himself from falling, it is\r\nprobable that a pathological condition of his cerebral arteries is\r\npresent. This interferes with brain circulation and may have seriously\r\nimpaired the elasticity of the arteries which is so necessary to\r\novercome the rapid variations of the influence of gravity on the blood\r\ncurrent when there are sudden changes of position. Fits of dizziness\r\nthat come on immediately on rising in the morning, or that attack the\r\npatient when he sits up suddenly in bed may have the same serious\r\nsignificance. None of these signs are significant, however, unless\r\nthere are, as we have said, objective signs in the arteries.\r\n\r\n{516}\r\n\r\nBut dizziness may come from many other causes besides degeneration of\r\narteries. A very common cause of it is the presence of gas in the\r\nstomach which interferes with the heart action mechanically and so\r\ndisturbs the circulation. The column of blood to the head is more\r\neasily affected than the rest of the circulation because it must be\r\npumped up directly against gravity when we are in a standing position,\r\nand so any, even a slight, interference with the heart action is felt\r\nat once in this portion of the body. Besides, the brain is extremely\r\nsensitive to changes of circulation and even a slight disturbance of\r\nthe blood supply to it may cause dizziness. There occurs also\r\nundoubtedly a feeling of dizziness that is entirely subjective. The\r\npatient for some reason loses confidence in himself and has a feeling\r\nof dismay, as if he could not support himself. Such a patient may\r\ncomplain that when he comes down stairs, at the first step or two,\r\nparticularly of a high stairs, he has the dread that he may pitch\r\nforward. Such people have never actually fallen, but they have to\r\ngrasp the railing and they have a dread of some accident of this kind.\r\nThis is, however, rather a form of akrophobia than a true dizziness.\r\nProf. Oppenheim has dwelt on vertigo as a dread (see preceding\r\nchapter).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vertigo_.--Besides, there are pathological conditions that cause\r\ndizziness yet have no connection at all with the dizziness that is a\r\npremonitory symptom of apoplexy. Meniere's disease, for instance, even\r\nin its milder forms, causes at times a vertigo that is extremely\r\nannoying and that frequently gives rise to the fear that a serious\r\nbrain lesion is either actually occurring or is impending. I have seen\r\neven comparatively young patients suffer so much from this dread that\r\nlife became miserable to them and they were unable to do their work\r\nproperly. A few words of explanation and reassurance literally work\r\nwonders for such patients. In one case the young woman assured me over\r\nand over again that my explanation meant a new lease of life for her.\r\nShe still has occasional dizziness, but now she knows that it is due\r\nto her accompanying ear trouble and it does not worry her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Motor Symptoms and Over-solicitude_.--Besides dizziness, there are\r\nother symptoms of which patients complain and which may indicate that\r\nan apoplexy is impending or may mean only that a patient is occupying\r\nhimself too much with himself and his symptoms. Not infrequently when\r\nthere is degeneration of arteries in the brain there will be slight\r\nweaknesses of the limbs or awkwardness in the use of them.\r\nOccasionally women will complain of the fact that they do not button\r\ndresses as they used to. Sometimes men will complain that they do not\r\nbutton their collar or their suspenders at the back with facility, or\r\nthat they are awkward and grow fatigued easily in such strained\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms may be indicative of some disturbance in the motor\r\nareas of the brain, but it must not be forgotten that all of these may\r\nbe simulated by nervousness, especially if the person knows the\r\nmeaning that is attached by doctors to these symptoms. In this matter\r\nparticularly a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. We are only just\r\ngetting a generation of trained nurses to the age when they are likely\r\nto suffer from dread of apoplexy and some of them are over-anxious\r\npatients because of their knowledge without the balance of complete\r\npractical experience with the meaning of such symptoms. Doctors\r\nthemselves are prone to be disturbed by such thinking more than {517}\r\nalmost anyone else. The delusion of thinking apoplexy is not at all\r\nuncommon in elderly physicians. In men it is important to insist that\r\nobjective symptoms are the only details of real value and that\r\nsubjective feelings are utterly illusory. If this cannot be brought\r\nhome to them they make themselves extremely miserable and may even\r\nhelp to precipitate through worry the fatal complications they dread.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--There is no doubt but that heredity plays an important\r\nrole in apoplexy. In certain families most of the members terminate\r\nexistence by rupture of an artery in the brain, sometimes at\r\ncomparatively early ages. Apparently the resistive vitality of their\r\narteries is only sufficient to enable them to maintain themselves for\r\na limited length of time against blood pressure. They are destined to\r\nhave arterial degeneration that will predispose to arterial rupture\r\nsometime before they are sixty. Father, grandfather and\r\ngreat-grandfather had their apoplexies from fifty-five to sixty-five\r\nand the son must realize that he probably will go the same way. Even\r\nthe delay of a year or two is important. Anything that will save the\r\nwear and tear of existence may bring about such a delay and it is not\r\nby drugs, nor even by dietetic precautions, so much as by attention to\r\nthe patient's state of mind that this decided benefit can be best\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Over-indulgence_.--People with such an unfortunate heritage should be\r\nmade to understand reasonably early in life that they must save\r\nthemselves from as much arterial wear and tear as possible. There are\r\ncertain occupations involving intense emotion and excitement that are\r\nbarred to them if they want to live out their lives, even to the\r\nextent usual in the family. There are three causes that weaken\r\narterial walls. When the question of causation of aneurism is\r\ndiscussed it is usually said that it is especially the devotees of\r\nthree pagan deities--Venus, Bacchus and Vulcan--who suffer from this\r\nform of arterial trouble. Just this same class suffer particularly\r\nfrom the tendency to early arterial rupture in the brain. Under the\r\nhead of devotees of Vulcan, the hard workers, must now also be placed\r\nthe advocates and exemplifiers of the strenuous life, who are\r\nperpetually doing, though often it is hard to see what they\r\naccomplish; the money-getters, who are really overworking as much as\r\nthe forced laborers of olden time. People with an apoplectic heredity\r\nshould not take up such professions as that of the actor, the broker,\r\nthe speculator of any kind, the lawyer absorbed by the strain of trial\r\nwork, perhaps not even that of the surgeon. Physicians generally are\r\nnot long lived because of the irregularity of their hours of eating\r\nand sleeping and the responsibility of their professional life.\r\n\r\nMany men will not be guided by such considerations and insist on\r\nliving their lives in their own way in spite of the possibility of the\r\nfamily inheritance shortening their career in the late fifties. More\r\nthan one has said that he would prefer to have the life of the salmon\r\nrather than that of the turtle. The strenuous life alone appeals to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  \"Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.\"\r\n\r\nThis would be an admirable response if what these men accomplished\r\nduring their lives amounted to anything. Most of these who run out\r\ntheir existences in the midst of excitement, however, only do harm by\r\nadding to the swarm of speculators in life, or accomplish very little\r\nbecause of the intense {518} excitement under which they labor. It is\r\nthe quiet lives, doing a few things and doing them well, outside of\r\nthe strenuous current of the bustle of existence, that accomplish most\r\nfor mankind. The others may attract attention for the moment, but they\r\nsoon pass out, often having done rather harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life-direction_.--It is perfectly possible for the physician to make\r\nthis clear to a young man with a dangerous heredity and perhaps change\r\nthe current of life so as to make it effective in simplicity and\r\nserious patient work. The young man will usually be quite impatient to\r\nthink that anything thirty years ahead should be expected to influence\r\nhis decision as to how or what he shall do with life, yet this motive\r\nadded to others may help to get at least some of this and the next\r\ngeneration from wasting their lives in an over-strenuous existence\r\nthat at most merely accumulates money, often accumulates it only in\r\norder to lose it, with consequent disappointment and worry, and\r\nfrequently leaves no real accomplishment but only the problem of the\r\ndisposal of accumulated wealth for future generations. Where large\r\nwealth is left to the succeeding generation there is usually little\r\nuse to give any advice with regard to the possibility of early\r\napoplexy, because excitements of other kinds than those of business,\r\nof the heart rather than the mind, are likely to wear out existence\r\neven before the time when the family life of arteries ordinarily,\r\nthough precociously, runs itself out.\r\n\r\nCertain people have what is called the _apoplectic habitus_, that is,\r\nthey are short in stature, rather stout, with short necks and florid\r\ncomplexions. It seems not unlikely that the mechanical arrangement\r\nwithin their bodies by which the distance from their heart to their\r\nbrain is so much shorter than in ordinary persons is responsible for\r\nthe tradition so generally accepted that there is a definite tendency\r\nin such people for apoplexy to occur at a comparatively early age.\r\nSuch people should be warned gently but firmly of the danger that they\r\nincur if they subject themselves to a life of excitement or emotional\r\nstress or permit themselves to get into circumstances in which they\r\nwill worry much. It may seem as though a warning of this kind would\r\nprecipitate the worry of mind that it is meant to ameliorate, but in\r\npresent-day publicity such people are likely to have heard of the\r\nmeaning of their particular constitution of body and consequently\r\nworry about it, but usually after it is too late to do any good. In\r\nthis matter, as in heart disease, the warning must come before there\r\nare any symptoms, or else must not be used at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Certain Abuses_.--In most of these cases definite warnings with\r\nregard to habits of life and indulgence in stimulants and narcotics\r\nshould be given. Both Prof. Von Leyden and Prof. Mendel of Berlin\r\ninsist that for patients in whom there is any likelihood of the\r\ndevelopment of early apoplexy indulgence in alcoholic liquors is\r\nalmost sure to be serious, but in addition to this generally accepted\r\nwarning, both of them also insist that smoking has a tendency to\r\nproduce serious, premature degeneration of arteries, especially in\r\npeople who already have tendencies in that direction. Overeating and\r\nhigh living in general without moderate exercise causes a plethora of\r\nthe circulation that must be avoided. On the other hand, violent\r\nexercise, running especially to catch trains or cars, haste in the\r\nascent of stairs or hills, heavy lifting, straining at stool, and the\r\nlike, are particularly prone to have serious consequences for such\r\npeople. This warning is all the more needed because many a short,\r\n{519} stout man acquires the idea that gymnastic work and various\r\nexercises indoors may help him to reduce his weight and restore the\r\nactivity of his earlier years. This is practically always a delusion\r\nand indoor gymnastic work is always of dubious value.\r\n\r\nWhat these people need is not more muscle and the wearing off of fat\r\nbut more air and the burning of it off by increased oxidation. Such\r\npatients must be taught to lead tranquil lives without any of the\r\nexcitement and strenuosity that, after all, accomplishes so little.\r\nThe sacrifice when first suggested, appears too great a one to make,\r\nbut after a few years patients instead of feeling that it was a\r\nsacrifice at all pronounce it to be a blessing in disguise and are\r\nproportionately grateful to their physician. Life for many of these\r\npeople may be prolonged not for a few years of hustle-bustle, but for\r\nmany years of good work in quiet and peace, without hurting others by\r\ncompetition, but helping many because there is time in their\r\nconsiderate lives to see something of the sorrow and suffering around\r\nthem and to relieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Change of Occupation_.--In the matter of prophylaxis it is\r\nparticularly important to insist on the fact that when men have worked\r\nat hard manual labor when they are young and then, about middle life,\r\nhave turned to intense intellectual labor, such as the management and\r\nadministration of important affairs, they are a little more liable\r\nthan are the general average of humanity to have an apoplectic seizure\r\nat sixty or a little later. Apparently inurement to a particular kind\r\nof labor when young makes for the capacity to stand it longer than\r\nwould otherwise be the case. In this matter, however, the most\r\nimportant factor is heredity. Men who come from long-lived families\r\nare likely to live long--indeed far beyond the ordinary term of human\r\nlife. Even in them, however, certain of these directions are helpful\r\nin securing the full measure of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Stroke.--After a stroke of apoplexy when it becomes clear\r\nthat nature is about to reassert her control over the circulation in\r\nthe brain and dispose of the remains of the old hemorrhage,\r\npsychotherapeutics is more important than anything else that we have\r\nfor the treatment of these patients. As a rule, they have been active,\r\nvigorous men who are stricken and who suffer more from doing nothing\r\nand waiting to get better than from any pain they have to undergo.\r\nThey know that another stroke may come at any time. It is no wonder\r\nthat introspection plays its part, that every feeling that they have\r\nbecomes exaggerated in significance, that their appetite fails them,\r\nthat their bowels become sluggish, that they do not sleep, or that\r\nafter having fallen asleep they wake up and then for hours lie awake\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lack of Air and Exercise_.--As they usually have no exercise of any\r\nkind, do not get out into the air, and have very little diversion of\r\nmind, it is easy to understand that neurotic or hysterical symptoms\r\ndevelop, that they lose all confidence of recovery and make themselves\r\neven worse than they are by dwelling on their condition. The only way\r\nthat this group of symptoms can be treated is by favorable suggestion,\r\nby encouragement, by mental reassurance and by occupation of mind.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that the condition of affairs which developed in a\r\nfamily immediately after the occurrence of an apoplexy usually makes a\r\nvery unfavorable environment for the treatment of these cases. It is\r\npractically impossible for those who come to visit the patient or for\r\nthe members of the {520} family for some time to wear anything but the\r\nresigned air that indicates that they fear the worst.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sympathetic Care_.--After the stroke at once when survival is assured\r\ncomes the question of the management of the patient. A devoted\r\ndaughter seems to be able to do more for an apoplectic father than\r\nanyone else. Somehow her youth appeals to him sympathetically, and he\r\nhas not that feeling of sadness mixed with a little envy that comes so\r\nreadily to all men when they find themselves slipping out of life\r\nwhile their contemporaries and friends and relatives are left behind.\r\nIt is as if the idea of his daughter being young and strong, even\r\nthough he has lost vitality, docs not touch him poignantly because he\r\nhas always expected that she should have health and strength after he\r\nwas gone. On the other hand, a daughter is not always a good nurse for\r\na mother. Just why, is hard to say. A hired nurse must take, as a\r\nrule, the place close to the mother which, in the case of the father,\r\nso naturally falls to the daughter. These ideas may be founded on too\r\nfew cases to generalize very much about, but I have discussed them\r\nwith many physicians, including some women physicians, and they agree\r\nwith them, in general principle at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trained Attendance_.--As a rule, then, the first thing that has to be\r\ndone for a patient who has had apoplexy and who is beginning to\r\nrecover, is to have trained attendants near him who talk\r\nprofessionally to him and reassure him and do not make him feel\r\nconstantly the possibility of an approaching end. If his improvement\r\nhas begun his family must not be allowed to bother him, his affairs\r\nshould not be talked over and, as far as possible, some occupation of\r\nmind should be secured for him. He needs new interests at once. These\r\nmust be gradually awakened and he must be made to feel as early as\r\npossible that though he may be more helpless than before and most of\r\nhis ordinary occupation in life may be cut off, there are still many\r\ninterests in life which he may thoroughly enjoy. I shall never forget\r\nhearing Thomas Dunn English, the dear old poet to whom in his earlier\r\nyears we owed \"Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,\" say at an alumni dinner of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania that he used to think that all the good\r\nthings of life were somehow contained in its first eighty years, but\r\nthat now since he had past his eightieth birthday (he was at the time\r\nin his eighty-third year) he was beginning to agree with Bismarck, who\r\ndeclared under similar circumstances that he had found many interests\r\nin the second eighty years of life. At the time English was quite\r\nblind, was almost completely deaf, had been seriously ill for several\r\nmonths, and had suffered a rather severe stroke some years before; and\r\nyet he made the best speech at the dinner that evening and had the\r\nyoungest heart of us all--joyous, uplifting, encouraging, optimistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outlook_.--Men who have been great workers are prone to think that a\r\nstroke of apoplexy means the end of all serious work. Of course, it\r\nmeans nothing of the kind for the majority of patients. Many men find\r\nnot only enjoyment in life after their recovery from even a serious\r\nstroke, but also possibilities of accomplishment sometimes better than\r\nthey had done before. It has even been known that men who had been\r\noccupying themselves with things scarcely worth while, with the mere\r\naccumulation of money without any purpose, were awakened to a sense of\r\ntheir responsibilities to life and to their fellowmen by a stroke and\r\nplanned in the after years institutions or aids to {521} existing\r\ninstitutions that did much to make life more livable for others.\r\nNothing makes a man face life in a better mood to do really effective\r\nservice for mankind than the prospect of possibly soon having to go\r\nout of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Encouraging Examples_.--On the other hand, many men have been able in\r\nspite even of a severe stroke to go on after a time with the work they\r\nhad been at before and, though feeling its effects, accomplish the\r\nbest achievements of their lives. A typical example is the case of\r\nPasteur, the great French bacteriologist, to whom we owe most of our\r\nmodern preventive medicine and to whom Lord Lister frankly attributes\r\nthe germ idea of the antiseptic theory. When little past fifty,\r\nPasteur after years of hard work and worry suffered from a severe\r\nstroke of apoplexy followed by several of slighter character. It\r\nseemed absolutely the end of his labors. For more than a year he was\r\nable to do nothing. For all his after life he was seriously lame as a\r\nconsequence of his stroke. In spite of this, which would seem to\r\npreclude the possibility of great intellectual work, Pasteur's most\r\nimportant discoveries were developed after this time and he continued\r\nfor over twenty years to be the leader of biological science. Had he\r\ndied at the age of fifty or given up his work we would scarcely know\r\nhim for the great scientist that he afterwards proved.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to be able to tell the stories of such lives as\r\nexamples to patients who are dispirited and downhearted after a\r\nstroke. Of course, men must be prevented from doing hard work or from\r\nworrying during the time immediately following the hemorrhage of the\r\nbrain, and, indeed, for some months. Work and worry, though worry much\r\nmore than work, might easily hasten a recurrence of the seizure. It\r\nhas always seemed to me, however, that it is impossible to keep the\r\nhuman mind utterly unoccupied. Men must think about something during\r\ntheir waking hours, and if they have not some interests close at heart\r\nthey worry about themselves. Of the two things, worry is much harder\r\non the tissues, raises blood pressure more, disturbs the circulation\r\nof the brain to a greater degree than does work. Anything that a man\r\nwill interest himself in, then, should be allowed to him, provided, of\r\ncourse, that he is kept from getting into the state of mind which\r\nprecipitated the rupture of the artery in his brain. It is a change of\r\nmental occupation above all that is needed and this is secured by\r\ndeliberate attempts to interest his mind in various ways and keep him\r\nfrom dwelling on himself and his ills. This injunction cannot be\r\nrepeated too often.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Change of Mental Interest_.--I have already insisted in the chapter\r\non Diversion of Mind that so far as we know at the present time\r\ndifferent portions of the brain are occupied with different subjects\r\nin which we may interest ourselves. When a man by business worries,\r\noccupation with financial affairs, or with political troubles, has\r\napparently worn out one portion of his brain, he may still use other\r\nportions to decided advantage. Hence the necessity for finding new\r\ninterests for the apoplectic after their attack. The best interests\r\nfor them are those associated in some way with their fellows, because\r\nthese are accompanied by feelings of consolation, of encouragement, of\r\ndesire to live and do good to others. These do more to take men out of\r\ntheir moodiness, their morbid introspection, and their\r\nself-centeredness, than anything else. With the help of a good nurse,\r\nherself of broad interests, this must become the main purpose of the\r\nphysician's treatment.\r\n\r\n{522}\r\n\r\n_Misplaced Sympathy_.--After the first few days, when the shock is\r\nover, a strong, healthy man who has been suddenly taken down with\r\napoplexy, then rendered helpless as a consequence of the lesion in his\r\nbrain, rather resents the sympathy and, above all, the frequent\r\nexpression of the feelings of his friends towards him. Time is needed\r\nfor him to recover, there is no way of hastening it, he is already\r\nimpatient at the delay and words of sympathy do him very little good\r\nand often add to his impatience. He is to be taken absolutely with\r\nprofessional calm, made to understand that time is the most important\r\nelement in his cure, provided he will not worry and will have patience\r\nto wait and to help as far as he can. I nearly always feel that it is\r\nbetter for these patients to be away from home as soon as they can be\r\nmoved with safety. This enables them to avoid without much difficulty\r\nwhat they are apt to consider the intrusive and obtrusive sympathy of\r\nfriends. Especially is this true of business friends, themselves in\r\ngood health, who come to offer their condolences.\r\n\r\nTheir hysterical condition is largely influenced by the fact that they\r\nare indoors and have so little diversion of mind. Just as soon as\r\npossible they must get out of doors. Over and over again I have found\r\nthat patients did not care to expose themselves to the inquisitive\r\ngaze of neighbors and preferred to stay in the house, though the\r\nouting would be of much benefit to them. Hence the necessity for\r\ngetting them away from home, among people whom they can observe\r\nwithout attracting too much attention themselves and, above all,\r\nwithout being the subjects of such obtrusive pity as will disturb\r\nthem. None of us likes to be pitied and least of all the strong,\r\nvigorous man who often has had nothing the matter with him all his\r\nlife and is now suddenly stricken. It requires years of experience to\r\nenable one to take sympathy properly and without resenting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outings and Human Interests_.--When patients care for carriage riding\r\nI have found that the city park is an excellent place for patients\r\nsuffering from the effects of apoplexy, who require outdoor air and\r\ndiversion of mind, yet without exercise or much exertion. The children\r\nin the park, if they play around, serve as a better diversion of mind\r\nthan almost anything else for elderly people thus stricken, for they\r\nseem to renew their youth at the sight of the little ones.\r\nGrandchildren make the best possible consolers even when they seem to\r\nprobe deep into old wounds by asking questions and by talking about\r\ndeath. The talk of death from young lips has not the same disturbing\r\neffect as from older people. The games of children interest the old\r\nonce more, and if there is occasional music and the chance to see the\r\npassing throng of carriages and motor cars and the pleasure boats and\r\nall the rest there is refreshment and reinvigoration in it all that\r\nsoon brings back to the patient deep, satisfactory, even dreamless\r\nuninterrupted sleep at night, and appetite and strength. At first\r\nthere will usually be some objection to being thus treated as an\r\ninvalid, but only a few days of experience are needed to convert even\r\nthe most morbid to the idea that this outing will do them good. As a\r\nrule, friends must be warned not to spoil the effect of it by fearing\r\nlest the patient should be lonely and so go to the park to entertain\r\nhim. If the drive, the lake and the children, as well as the\r\npassers-by, do not suffice to give the patient sufficient diversion of\r\nmind, the visits of friends will not have any favorable effect. As a\r\nrule, it is better for them to see the {523} patient at home and even\r\nthat not too often unless they are of his immediate family.\r\n\r\nWhere people are able to go away and, above all, where they can have\r\nsome pleasant companionship, a seaside resort is an ideal place for\r\nthose recovering from apoplexy. The long ride in a wheel-chair on the\r\nboardwalk at least several hours in the morning and afternoon soon\r\nacts marvelously. There is constant diversion of mind at any season of\r\nthe year, for there are lots of people to be seen in all sorts of\r\ncostumes and the shops and the shows and the passing throng all have\r\ntheir interests. Then the sea air is bracing and tempts to\r\nsleepfulness and just as soon as sleep improves courage comes back. I\r\nhave known patients so hysterical that they were crying every day and\r\nthat seemed to have given up all hope, improve so much in two weeks at\r\nAtlantic City that it seemed little short of marvelous. What is\r\nneeded, however, is not a stay of a few weeks but of several months.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis of Strokes.--While, of course, any single stroke may be\r\nfatal and no one can tell anything about the prognosis of a rupture of\r\na brain artery, there are many favorable things that can be said to\r\npatients, and they are so prone to think of all the unfavorable things\r\nthat this better side should be presented to them at once. The\r\nphysician is tempted to present the worst side of the case lest it\r\nshould be thought that he did not realize how serious the condition\r\nwas. All the seriousness of it may be impressed upon friends, but the\r\npatient must be told all the possibilities of good. I have always felt\r\nthat the tonic quality of hope was worth more in preventing further\r\ndamage and in encouraging the beginning of repair than any drug that\r\nwe have. If patients have been unconscious, just as soon as\r\nunconsciousness disappears, they should be told that very probably\r\nthis is the beginning of recovery and that the great majority of\r\npeople who have a stroke recover. The more rapidly the symptoms\r\ndisappear the better is the ultimate prognosis. Many a man who has had\r\na stroke has done years of good work afterwards and very few men who\r\nrecover fail to accomplish something that is of supreme satisfaction\r\nto them. They have a new outlook on life as a consequence of the near\r\nvision of death.\r\n\r\nThose who have had one stroke usually die in a subsequent one, though,\r\nof course, some intermittent disease such as pneumonia or some organic\r\ncomplication may anticipate the second stroke. Those who have had two\r\nstrokes and survive are often much worried by the old tradition that a\r\nthird stroke is always fatal. I am reasonably sure that many old men\r\nhave not survived their third stroke when they felt its premonitory\r\nsymptoms and knew just what was coming from their previous experience,\r\nbecause they had given up hope on account of this old tradition.\r\nIgnorant people or those of the lower classes who have not heard this\r\naxiom often survive their third stroke and I have seen a man who had\r\nsuffered from seven apoplectic seizures.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplications.--Occasionally a patient, especially if of the educated\r\nclasses, may be much worried by the fact that while one side is\r\ndistinctly lamed after his stroke, yet there is also a pronounced\r\nweakness on the other side of the body. This sometimes gives rise to\r\nthe rather appalling thought that there was perhaps a simultaneous\r\nrupture on both sides of the brain. It needs to be explained to such\r\npatients that this slight weakness, sometimes quite distinct, however,\r\non the side opposite that which is most affected is extremely {524}\r\ncommon. Ordinarily the rupture of an artery on one side of the brain\r\ncauses a paralysis on the other side of the body. This paralysis or\r\nloss of control over muscular action is due to disturbance of the\r\nmotor tracts of nerves through which muscular action is controlled and\r\ndirected by the brain, and these normally cross to the other side on\r\nthe way to the periphery. In nearly everyone the tracts remain\r\nuncrossed to some slight extent. In some so much of the pyramidal\r\ntract remains uncrossed that there may be decided weakness on the same\r\nside as the lesion in the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much can be done for organic nervous disease by attention to the\r\nindividual patient and by favorable suggestion is illustrated in\r\nlocomotor ataxia. This is, of course, an absolutely incurable disease.\r\nWe know definitely that certain tracts of nerves in the spinal cord\r\nare entirely obliterated and their functions can never be restored.\r\nOccasionally the disease gives rise to severe localized pains called\r\ncrises, for which even our strongest anodyne remedies are of little\r\navail. As a rule, the patient grows more and more helpless and though\r\nhe may live for twenty or thirty years after the beginning of the\r\ndisease, and usually dies from some intercurrent affection rather than\r\nfrom any direct effect of his disease, the condition is burdensome and\r\nthe outlook is most unfavorable and depressing. It is for locomotor\r\nataxia, however, that the irregular practitioners have succeeded,\r\napparently, in working wonders. Some of them, indeed, have made quite\r\na reputation for the cure of the disease. This was not because they\r\ndid the impossible and cured genuine cases, but because individual\r\npatients can, in many cases, be so much improved by attention to\r\nparticular symptoms, and so much can be done to make life more livable\r\nfor them, that it is no wonder that so many of them are ready to\r\nproclaim that they have been cured, though only certain symptoms, are\r\nbettered and their underlying disease remains in essence unchanged.\r\n\r\nOne thing that constantly happens in the progress of locomotor ataxia\r\nis a yielding of joint capsules and attachments so that there is more\r\nmotion permitted in joints than is possible in the normal individual.\r\nAs a consequence of this relaxation of tissues around the hip joint\r\nthe leg may be stretched up along the trunk when the patient is lying\r\ndown, the foot being placed over the shoulder almost as a gun is\r\nplaced at carry-arms. Patients often walk with a distinct \"back knee\"\r\nbecause of the yielding of the tissues around the knee-joint. The\r\nankle nearly always yields and a specially severe form of flat foot\r\ndevelops. This causes muscles to act at a disadvantage and produces\r\ngreat fatigue and even a painful muscular condition when the patient\r\nstands much on the feet. This form of flat foot is hopeless so far as\r\ncure is concerned, but it can be greatly relieved by the wearing of\r\nflat-foot braces or even, to a greater degree, by the wearing of\r\nspecially fitted shoes. This does not seem much to do for a patient\r\nsuffering from the serious organic nervous disease of locomotor\r\nataxia, and yet a lot of patients for whom properly fitting shoes\r\n{525} were made, thought themselves so much improved and relieved by\r\nthis simple measure that they allowed themselves to be persuaded that\r\ntheir locomotor ataxia was cured. In some cases, where the brunt of\r\nthe disease was borne by the feet, this relief really did so much to\r\nafford the patients freedom from most symptoms of their affection that\r\nthey thought themselves on the road to recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue of Favorable Suggestion.--If once the idea of the awful\r\nhopelessness of their cases is removed from locomotor ataxia patients\r\nthey will suggest their own betterment so powerfully that they easily\r\npersuade themselves that their affection is considerably improved. It\r\nis evident, then, that the regular physician must take advantage of\r\nthis wonderful power for the relief of human suffering and depression\r\nthat proves so helpful to the irregular. We cannot cure the tabes of\r\nthe spinal cord. We cannot re-create the nerve tracts that have been\r\nobliterated. We realize that there is no use trying to do so any more\r\nthan there would be in trying to make an amputated finger grow to its\r\nfull size again. We can treat the patient, however. We can remove many\r\nsymptoms that sometimes bother him more than those necessarily\r\nconnected with his spinal affection. We can relieve annoyances of all\r\nkinds that add to his misery and as a consequence we can give him\r\nhope, keep him from brooding about himself and thus perform the proper\r\nfunction of a physician. We shall not forget that we can only rarely\r\ncure, but we can almost always relieve pain and we can always help the\r\npatient in some way. The ataxic patient needs consolation, and this\r\ncan be given without in any way deceiving him. The loss of sight seems\r\nan irreparable ill to those who see, yet the blind are quite happy,\r\nare much more cheerful than many seeing people, and have learned to\r\nstand their affliction not only with equanimity but really without\r\nmuch depression. In the olden times, before proper care was taken of\r\nthe blind, they had little occupation, they had nothing to do with\r\ntheir hands, the future was blank and they suffered severely from\r\ndepression. As a rule, they did not go out enough and their bodily\r\nhealth suffered and the disturbance of their functions still further\r\nheightened their depression. All of this happens now with the ataxic\r\npatient. A host of symptoms not at all necessarily connected with his\r\nspinal affection develop and prove sources of annoyance. Many of them\r\ncan be removed entirely, all of them can be ameliorated. If, while\r\ndoing this, we succeed in impressing a discouraged patient's mind with\r\nour power to benefit in spite of an underlying incurable disease, we\r\nhave another triumph of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving Unfavorable Suggestions.--The general experience with those\r\nsuffering from locomotor ataxia has been that the depression\r\nconsequent upon the announcement that they have the disease and the\r\nstigma that is supposed to attach to it in our day leads them to a\r\ngreat extent to avoid going out into the air. This adds woefully to\r\ntheir depressed condition. Take a healthy man, let him stay inside a\r\ngreat part of the time without any exercise, seeing no new faces,\r\nwithout any interests in life, and at the end of three months he will\r\nhave a set of neurotic symptoms on a basis of depression that will\r\nmake him supremely miserable. This will be true even though he has not\r\nthe threat of an incurable disease hanging over his head. He must be\r\nmade to realize that every neglect of any law of health in his\r\ncondition is even more serious in its effect upon him than it would be\r\nwere he in good health. Above {526} all, it must be made clear to him\r\nthat while his neglect of hygiene may perhaps not shorten his life, it\r\nwill greatly add to the mental suffering, much more unbearable in its\r\nway than the physical suffering which he will have to endure during\r\nthe progress of his disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreating Accessory Symptoms.--Nearly every ataxic patient who is not\r\ndirectly and almost constantly under the care of a physician, is a\r\nsufferer from two conditions that are so constantly present that they\r\nare sometimes thought to be consequences of the primary affection.\r\nThese are loss of appetite with consequent loss of weight and\r\nconstipation. Almost without exception neither of these symptoms or\r\nsyndromes are at all connected with the locomotor ataxia. They are the\r\nresult of the unhygienic life that the patient is living and of the\r\ndepressed state of his mind and lack of diversion. They are mutually\r\nconnected, for a man who does not eat enough will not have regular\r\nmovements of his bowels, and constipation reacts to produce further\r\ndepression. A vicious circle in pathogeny is formed and the patient is\r\nlikely to get into a very debilitated and depressed condition. Both of\r\nthese troublesome symptoms may be corrected to the manifest\r\nimprovement of the patient by proper advice and ordinary care for his\r\nwell being.\r\n\r\nAppetite is largely a function, as the mathematicians say of something\r\nthat depends on something else, not of exercise, as is often thought,\r\nbut of fresh air. In the tuberculosis sanatoria patients with fever\r\nare not permitted to take exercise, yet if they are out in the air\r\nmost of the day and if their rooms are well aired at night, they can\r\neat heartily and digest their food well. Of course, appetite is\r\nlargely a psychic matter and the thoroughly discouraged man will have\r\nno care for food in spite of abundance of air. A little persuasion,\r\nhowever, of the necessity for making the best of a bad job will\r\nusually arouse even a locomotor ataxia patient in the early stages of\r\nhis disease to the necessity for eating a reasonable amount. If he has\r\nsuffered from gastric crises and fears that eating normally may\r\nprecipitate these, he must be persuaded that this is not the case,\r\nthat the presence of food, or its amount, or quality, has nothing to\r\ndo with the initiation of these painful attacks so far as we know, and\r\nthat even though at the beginning of his affection before his\r\nlocomotor ataxia was recognized, his gastralgia may have been declared\r\nby his physicians, as is so often the case, to be connected with some\r\nform of gastritis or indigestion, that idea may now be given up and he\r\nmay eat plentifully with confidence that it will not increase his\r\npains. On the contrary, limitation of food seems to have a distinctly\r\nunfavorable effect in increasing the number and severity of these\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThe same thing must be made clear to him as to intestinal and rectal\r\ncrises. It seems likely that tendencies to constipation by irritating\r\nperipheral nerve endings may have some effect in bringing about the\r\nexplosion in sensory nerves which have been called intestinal or\r\nrectal crises. In general, however, these are dependent on spinal and\r\nnot peripheral conditions, and no thought of any connection must be\r\nallowed to disturb the consumption of a proper amount and variety of\r\nfood. It seems clear that when patients are much run down, have lost\r\nconsiderable in weight and are in a generally depressed condition,\r\ntheir nervous system is much more irritable than it would otherwise be\r\nand they are likely to suffer more frequently from crises of various\r\nkinds. Once a patient is made to understand that his general {527}\r\nnutrition may affect not only the course but the occurrence of\r\nsymptoms in the disease, as a rule it is not difficult to get him to\r\neat enough and to do so with the definite feeling that it is going to\r\ndo him good. Even though it should be necessary to use tonics, and\r\noften they will have to be prescribed, it is clear that this treatment\r\nof the patient's general condition is the physician's first duty,\r\nthough it does not and cannot affect the specific disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Complications.--There can, of course, be no doubt that the\r\ncrises of locomotor ataxia represents extremely poignant attacks of\r\npain. But on the other hand, anyone who has seen many of them is prone\r\nto think that not a few of them are really attacks of pain resembling\r\nthose which occasionally develop in hysterical subjects. The pain of a\r\ngastric neurosis may, indeed, so simulate the gastric crises of\r\nlocomotor ataxia as to make what is only a case of hysteria seem\r\nbeyond doubt one of locomotor ataxic. Locomotor ataxia patients are\r\nprone to think much about themselves and to fear the recurrence of\r\nthese painful crises once they have had experience with them. As a\r\nconsequence they sometimes suffer from what are pseudo-crises, that\r\nis, from neurotic painful conditions which simulate genuine crises\r\nmainly in the amount of reaction they produce in the patient. True\r\ntabetic crises yield more readily to ordinary anodyne drugs than do\r\nthese pseudo-crises. Nearly always the true crises are associated with\r\nand exaggerated by neurotic symptoms due to the depression of the\r\npatient, the yielding to his feelings, the conclusion that his pain is\r\ninevitable and is going to be worse each time, while successive crises\r\nare, as a matter of fact, often milder until they disappear for good,\r\nand this element in the case must always be borne in mind. Much can be\r\ndone for the relief by psychotherapy, that is, by making the patient\r\nsee the realities of his condition, suggesting to him that succeeding\r\ncrises are less painful and that if his general condition is as good\r\nas it should be he becomes better able to stand the pain of his crises\r\nand the shock of them is not so disturbing to his system.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Attitude.--Prof. Oppenheim, in one of his \"Letters to Nervous\r\nPatients,\" advising a patient suffering from an incurable organic\r\nnervous disease, evidently locomotor ataxia, though that is not\r\nexplicitly stated, outlines emphatically the favorable side of that\r\ndisease. This is absolutely needed. Ever so many unfavorable\r\nsuggestions with regard to his affection find their way to the\r\npatient. The very fact that it is pronounced absolutely incurable is\r\ndisheartening. Prof. Oppenheim's words, then, may be a precious help\r\nand to have them repeated from time to time renews the suggestion:\r\n\r\n  Now, however, we neurologists know that that disease frequently runs\r\n  a very mild course, that a man showing certain early symptoms of\r\n  such a disease may for ten to twenty-five years and even longer\r\n  retain his capacity for work and enjoyment. This for a man of thirty\r\n  to forty years is almost tantamount to the expectation of a whole\r\n  normal lifetime. But on the other hand, what danger to the peace of\r\n  mind, what destruction of happiness in life may be caused if the\r\n  knowledge that such a disease has begun to develop is imparted to\r\n  the patient without being combined with the consoling information as\r\n  to the nature and course of the benign forms of this trouble! In\r\n  unceasing anxiety and fear, in daily expectancy of some fresh\r\n  symptoms, of some increase or aggravation of his troubles, does the\r\n  poor man waste his life; and I have frequently found that this\r\n  wretched apprehension and excitement cause a nervousness and mental\r\n  depression which in their effects are much more momentous than is\r\n  the commencing spinal disease.\r\n\r\n  From this miserable condition I desire to protect you, and I would\r\n  ask you to {528} take this advice deeply to heart: do not bear\r\n  yourself as one who is condemned; as one who, affected by a\r\n  progressive, incurable disease, will soon fall a victim to\r\n  paralysis. On the strength of my own experience I give you the\r\n  assurance that your condition of health will not necessarily in ten\r\n  years' time be essentially different from what it is at present. But\r\n  I would also strenuously exhort you to observe all the precautionary\r\n  rules laid down for you, to avoid all unaccustomed strain or\r\n  indulgence such as can only be undertaken with impunity by a man in\r\n  full vigor and absolute soundness of health. I would advise you also\r\n  to be thoroughly examined once a year by an experienced physician.\r\n  But apart from these restrictions, you should as far as possible\r\n  feel yourself and bear yourself like a healthy man, remaining\r\n  attached to your work, and not withdrawing yourself from the\r\n  pleasures of social intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelearning Muscular Movements.--Perhaps the most interesting evidence\r\nof how much may be done for organic nervous disease in spite of the\r\nfact that the underlying lesion is absolutely incurable, may be\r\nobtained from what is accomplished by Frenkel's method of treating\r\nlocomotor ataxia. As is well known, by reteaching the movements\r\nnecessary for walking, ataxic patients regain control of the movements\r\nof their limbs to a marked extent. As a consequence, bed-ridden\r\npatients are enabled to walk once more even though they may have to\r\ncarry a cane and be supported, and patients who have had to use two\r\ncanes get along with only one, or may even eventually be able to walk\r\nwithout any artificial support.\r\n\r\nJust how the improvement is brought about we are not quite sure. It\r\nseems probable that the eyes become trained to replace the muscle\r\nsense to a noteworthy degree, but there is in addition apparently a\r\nre-education of the muscle-sense. Perhaps there is also a transfer of\r\nthe function of certain degenerated nerves to other tracts than those\r\nin which muscle impulses originally traveled. The improvement in\r\nmuscular control originally obtained is a striking illustration of how\r\nmuch nature is able to compensate for even organic lesions and is a\r\nlesson in the necessity for never ceasing to try to do something even\r\nwhen the case seems hopeless. Certainly locomotor ataxic patients\r\nwould seem the least likely to be benefited by training in movement\r\nand yet this movement therapy for tabes has had some wonderful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe story of how this mode of treatment came into existence is\r\ninteresting and instructive as an illustration of how happy chance in\r\nour time, as so often with regard to drugs in the past, came to assist\r\nthe rational development of therapeutics. A German professor wished to\r\ndemonstrate to his class the varying inco-ordination of a series of\r\ntabetic patients. Some of them had their main inco-ordination in the\r\nlegs, others in their hands. He went over the cases in his wards so as\r\nto arrange the demonstration for the next day. He told each patient\r\nthat he would ask him to perform a particular set of movements before\r\nthe class which would illustrate strikingly a particular phase of\r\nmuscular inco-ordination. His patients were interested in the\r\nannounced demonstrations and during the afternoon they went over the\r\nmovements that they were expected to perform. They practiced them as\r\nassiduously as their condition permitted for the exhibition. As a\r\nconsequence the most striking features of their inco-ordination\r\ndisappeared. After having practiced the movement for a certain length\r\nof time they could do it ever so much better than before. The special\r\nfeature of the professor's demonstration was spoiled, but a great\r\ncontribution to our knowledge of nature's compensatory powers {529}\r\nwas made and fortunately the hint of its significance for treatment\r\nwas taken and developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of Favorable Suggestion.--How much can be accomplished for the\r\nrelief of the general symptoms of locomotor ataxia and for the placing\r\nof patients in an attitude of mind that makes most of their symptoms\r\nof vanishing importance, can be judged from some recent experiences\r\nwith a new cure for the disease. This consisted only of some rather\r\nconventional treatment of the urethra by applications and dilatation,\r\nyet patients were relieved so much of the symptoms of locomotor\r\nataxia, or at least persuaded themselves that they were, that both in\r\nthis country and in Europe the discoverer of the new \"cure\" soon had\r\nscores of patients. The active therapeutic agent undoubtedly was the\r\nfact that patients who had been told that their disease was incurable\r\nand who had settled down in a state of discouragement and apathy in\r\nwhich their power over their muscles, their general health and their\r\nstrength and vitality were at the lowest ebb, and their tendencies to\r\ndiscomfort emphasized and made poignant by the supposed hopelessness\r\nof their situation, became aroused to new vitality by the promise of\r\ncure and then, under the repeated suggestion of a treatment said to be\r\nsure to cure them and that had cured others, became so much better,\r\nthat is, released so much latent energy, that they felt better, ate\r\nbetter, walked better, got out more and had their general health\r\nimproved, and all to such a degree that their disease seemed cured.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting illustration of what would seem to be the power of\r\nsuggestion over the symptoms of tabes occurs in a recent article in\r\nthe Archivos Espanoles de Neurologia Psyqiuatria y Fisioterapia of\r\nMadrid   [Footnote 39] on the improvement of tabes dorsalis by\r\nantidiphtheritic serum. It is quite impossible that the serum should\r\naffect favorably any of the underlying lesions of the disease any more\r\nthan that these should be ameliorated by the wearing of shoes of\r\nspecial character or operations on the urethra. The patient in this\r\ncase, however, was distinctly improved in many ways _after_ the\r\nantidiphtheritic serum was injected. There were some interesting\r\nsensory manifestations, pains in the arms and legs after the\r\ninjection, but these were removed by santonin or methylene blue. Both\r\nof these drugs are eminently suggestive in their action, so that one\r\nwould be prone to think the pains rather neurotic than actual. After a\r\ndozen injections had been given, the patient's sensations improved,\r\nhis power to pick up small things was better, and the sense of walking\r\non carpet had disappeared to a marked extent and he was able to walk\r\nmuch better than before and without support. Probably any attention\r\ngiven to him to the same degree would have produced like results.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 39: Tomo 1 No. 7, July, 1910.]\r\n\r\nWe have had previous examples of this kind in the history of the\r\ntreatment of locomotor ataxia. Certain drugs when given in the past\r\nwith the definite promise of cure and pursued for a good while with\r\nfrequently repeated favorable suggestions, have often seemed to\r\nbenefit patients, though subsequent experience has shown their total\r\nlack of value to modify the disease. Nitrate of silver was one of\r\nthese in the old days and many locomotor ataxia patients acquired an\r\nargyria as a consequence of the amount of silver absorbed and\r\ndeposited in the skin. Arsenic was another and some of the aluminum\r\n{530} compounds were also used. When we recall the suspension\r\ntreatment and its reported good effects--and failure, the\r\nover-extension treatment with the same history and many others in the\r\npast, the real place of the mental in the therapeutics of tabies is\r\nrevealed. Once this is practically realized, we find that we have\r\nready to hand and easy to use, the one really efficient factor in all\r\nthese treatments--that is, the influence on the patient's mind. It is\r\nfor the physician to devise thoroughly professional ways and means of\r\nusing that in each particular case so that his patients may be\r\nbenefited as much as possible. Certainly it would be foolish for us to\r\nleave to the irregular practitioner the use of this extremely valuable\r\nremedial measure, when we may do so much good with it, for the relief\r\nof symptoms at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPARESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nParesis would seem to be one of the affections so inevitable in its\r\ncourse, so positively helpless as regards any medication, and so\r\nhopeless in its absolutely sure termination in idiocy and death, that\r\nnothing can possibly be done for it through the patient's mind, yet it\r\nis probably one of the diseases for which most can be accomplished by\r\npsychotherapy. Mental treatment for it naturally divides itself into\r\nthree periods: that of prophylaxis, that of the early stage and that\r\nof the severer stage with remissions. Prophylaxis is much more\r\nimportant than is usually thought. It is very generally known at\r\npresent that paresis is usually a parasyphilitic disease, that is, an\r\naffection not due directly to syphilis, but which develops by\r\npreference and perhaps exclusively in a soil prepared for it by an\r\nattack of syphilis. As a consequence of the diffusion of this\r\nknowledge men who have suffered from syphilis sometimes become\r\nsupremely fatalistic as regards the development of locomotor ataxia or\r\nparesis in their cases. Worry is a prominent feature in the causation\r\nof paresis, and it is, therefore, extremely important to neutralize\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI have had university graduates tell me their histories and ask\r\nwhether I thought they had suffered from syphilis, and when I replied\r\naffirmatively have seen a look of despair come into their faces. One\r\nof them, a graduate of a large eastern university, said, after hearing\r\nmy opinion, though it was given with every assurance that my\r\nexperience with Fournier in Paris taught me the absolute curability of\r\nthe disease, \"Well, there are three men of my class who have already\r\ndeveloped paresis, and I suppose I will go the same way.\" With a\r\npersuasion like this haunting him night and day, exhausting nervous\r\nenergy and making his central nervous system less and less resistive,\r\nit would be almost a miracle if paresis did not develop. It is\r\nparticularly in those who have had nervously exhaustive\r\noccupations--brokers, speculators, actors, and the like--that paresis\r\ndoes develop. The strain upon their nervous systems seem to be so\r\ngreat that the syphilitic virus still remaining in their system has a\r\npeculiarly degenerative effect upon nervous tissue. A man may be in\r\nthe least worrisome of occupations, however, and if he is constantly\r\nbrooding over the possibility of the coming of the hideous specter of\r\nparesis, {531} he puts himself in the condition most likely to\r\nencourage the development of the pathological changes that underlie\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--As a rule patients who have had syphilis and who dread\r\nthe development of paresis should be warned with regard to their\r\noccupations in life. After a patient has had tuberculosis which\r\ndeveloped in particular surroundings, if it is at all possible, we no\r\nlonger permit him to go back into the surroundings in which his\r\ndisease developed. We are coming, more and more, to apply the\r\nprinciples of preventive medicine and this is as important in paresis\r\nas in anything else. Even though there may be many monetary or\r\neconomic reasons in favor of certain occupations, the danger may\r\noverweigh these. Those who have had syphilis should be warned of the\r\nrisk they run if they continue in occupations that require much mental\r\nexcitement or the strain of anxiety and the speculative factor of\r\nuncertainty with the inevitable occurrence of disappointments. It is\r\nunjustifiable to permit a patient whose central nervous system is\r\nsubjected to the deteriorating influence of the virus of syphilis,\r\nstill in his body even after ten years, to submit to the nerve-racking\r\nirritation of occupations which require all the vigor of a healthy,\r\nundisturbed organism to survive their wear and tear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Worry_.--One of the symptoms which neurotic patients are\r\nsure must be a preliminary sign of paresis is a disturbance of memory.\r\nPatients have heard that paresis causes memory disturbances and\r\nfearing the development of the disease, they disturb themselves very\r\nmuch by finding real or supposed defects of memory. Most of them have\r\nhad only a very vague idea of the sort of memory they possess and\r\ncannot tell whether it is worse than before, but finding a certain\r\ndifficulty in recalling things they conclude that it is deteriorating.\r\nOccasionally their supposed defect of memory is founded on nothing\r\nmore serious than the fact that they are paying so much attention to\r\nthemselves, that they cannot concentrate their attention enough on\r\nwhat they wish to remember so as really to impress it on their\r\nmemories. It is curious how persistent some patients are in making\r\nthemselves believe they have serious lacunae in their memory when\r\nthere are only certain conventional disturbances of it. The paretic\r\nhas defects of memory, but he is, as a rule, quite unconscious of\r\nthem. He has to have them pointed out to him. Patients who are\r\nsupremely conscious of their supposed defects, by that very fact show\r\ntheir possession of good intellectual faculties.\r\n\r\nTremor is another symptom that may develop in the midst of the\r\nsolicitude of those who dread paresis. The power to hold the limbs in\r\na given position is due to a very nice balancing of flexor and\r\nextensor muscles. There are many people, especially those a little\r\nawkward in the use of their muscles, who lack this power to some\r\nextent. To stand without swaying is rather a difficult task in one who\r\nis nervous or anxious about himself. Patients who are worrying about\r\nparesis and its possible development will almost surely disturb their\r\npower over their muscles and cause at least a slight tremor or\r\nswaying.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in all of these cases a series of dreads, or mental\r\nobsessions which interfere with various functions which may cause\r\ntremor, or some stuttering, or at least some apparent difficulties of\r\nspeech and which will surely revive any old-time difficulties of this\r\nkind, may develop in nervous persons and must not be allowed to pass\r\nas signs of developing paresis. The {532} diagnostic tests, of course,\r\nconsist in the knee-jerks, the pupillary reactions, the difference in\r\ndisposition, the delusions of grandeur, and, in general, the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of a physical degeneration running parallel\r\nwith a mental deterioration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prophylactic Reassurance_.--The first point in psychotherapy, then,\r\nis to give just as much reassurance as can be given. Probably not one\r\nout of a thousand of those who have suffered from syphilis afterwards\r\ndevelops paresis. Nearly always there is something in the history\r\nbesides syphilis that seems to be an essential etiological factor. A\r\ngreat many of the people who develop this disease have some hereditary\r\ntaint of mental incapacity at least, if not of actual insanity. Very\r\noften there is a personal or family history that indicates some mental\r\nunevenness or at least some lack of intellectual vigor. When people\r\nare sanely intellectual and have no unfortunate hereditary tendencies\r\nthey can be almost completely assured as to the possibility of the\r\ndevelopment of paresis, provided they take reasonable care of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alcohol_.--It is still an unsettled question whether alcoholism has\r\nanything to do, even in a subsidiary capacity, with the etiology of\r\nparesis. Probably it helps to predispose nerve tissues to degeneration\r\nby lowering their resistive vitality to the direct pathogenic action\r\nof the virus of syphilis. It seems clear, besides, that men who have\r\nacquired syphilis sometimes take to over-indulgence in alcohol, at\r\nleast to a greater degree than would otherwise be the case, because of\r\nthe discouraging dread that develops as a result of their worry over\r\nthis constitutional taint. A warning in this matter of indulgence in\r\nintoxicants is important because there are many nerve specialists who\r\ninsist that alcoholism is probably one of the prime factors in\r\nparesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnconclusive Diagnosis.--When the first symptoms of paresis have\r\ndeveloped so that the physician is almost certain that the disease is\r\npresent--the cumulative experience of recent mistakes on the part of\r\nthe most careful experts seems to show that he can never be entirely\r\ncertain--then it is important not to announce the worst to the\r\npatient, but to let him learn the reality of his condition gradually,\r\nso that all the awfulness of it does not overwhelm him. What have\r\nseemed typical cases of paresis, so diagnosed by excellent\r\nauthorities, have occasionally proved to be something else, or, at\r\nleast, to be wayward and very irregular forms of that disease with a\r\nlong course and marked remissions. There are forms of paranoia in the\r\nmiddle-aged which sometimes exhibit symptoms so strongly simulant of\r\nparesis as to deceive even the expert. There are forms of nervous\r\nweakness--neurasthenia--some of which are really cases of mental\r\nexhaustion or incapacity--the modern psychasthenia--which often lead\r\neven experienced physicians to think of and sometimes to diagnose\r\nparesis. There are cases of dementia praecox that only time can\r\ndifferentiate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis.--_Seeing the Worst_.--There is a tendency in most\r\nphysicians to see the worst side of the story rather than the better.\r\nThis is not because of any desire to be a harbinger of evil tidings,\r\nnor, as is sometimes said, to show the patient, should he get better,\r\nfrom what a depth of affliction he has been rescued, but it is rather\r\ndue to the very natural tendency existing in most of us to look on the\r\nworst side of things. Besides, we have found by experience that if\r\npatients are to be aroused to the necessity of care for themselves\r\nthey must be scared a little, and so we have formed the habit, not of\r\nconsciously {533} and deliberately telling the worst, but of stating\r\nthe unfavorable possibilities of a group of symptoms, in order that a\r\npatient may take due precautions and that he may realize, if the worst\r\ndoes happen, that we were not ignorant of it. If he gets better he is\r\ncorrespondingly grateful for this. If the unfavorable happens and we\r\nhad not warned him, he is more or less justifiably resentful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Consoling Hesitancy of Final Judgment_.--Patients suspected of\r\nsuffering from paresis can then without any violation of truth be\r\nreassured that their cases may not be incurable until the epileptiform\r\nincidents of the disease bring on that happy obscuration of mentality,\r\nthat either takes away all the terror of the disease or lessens so\r\nmuch its awful significance that the patient is spared the worst.\r\nThere are cases of reported cures in the literature even after what\r\nseemed to be characteristic epileptiform attacks had occurred.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be sure, in any case, of the future course of an affection\r\nexhibiting symptoms resembling paresis. The patient can always be\r\ngiven the advantage of this doubt then and the awful word incurable or\r\neven the diagnosis paresis need not be mentioned to him. It is\r\nperfectly possible, as a rule, to take other means to prevent\r\nunfortunate incidents from tendencies to violence or serious loss from\r\nfoolishness, without overwhelming the patient with an absolutely\r\nunfavorable prognosis, and the diagnosis of paresis, involving as it\r\ndoes, now that so much more is popularly known of the disease than\r\nbefore, the dread of inevitable idiocy. In this way much of the\r\ndepression that constitutes so large a part of the really sane period\r\nof the early stage of paresis and which inevitably hastens the course\r\nof the disease may be avoided. On the other hand, failure to announce\r\nabsolutely the diagnosis of paresis until there can be no particle of\r\ndoubt, can do no harm and will do good to the patients themselves, as\r\nwell as save their anxious friends from the trial of having to think\r\nof the awful possibilities of the disease. A single sensible member of\r\nthe family may be selected as the confidant and the situation saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRole of Psychotherapy.--While it is important that someone closely\r\nconnected with the patient should know the doctor's suspicions, he\r\nshould be bound to absolute secrecy as regards the patient himself and\r\nespecially as regards women friends and relatives. The attitude of\r\nmind assumed by women relatives, and especially those nearest and\r\ndearest, is sure to be communicated to the patient, if not directly at\r\nleast indirectly and inadvertently, and makes for anything but relief\r\nfrom the depression that is sure to be his if he has any gleam of\r\nunderstanding of his condition. Indeed, so much of pain and suffering\r\nis needlessly inflicted on relatives of paretic patients in the early\r\nstages of the disease by a premature announcement of the diagnosis\r\nthat it is especially important to insist on care in this matter. The\r\nfamily will usually clamor to know just what is the matter, but it is\r\nthe physician's duty to care for his patient and save the sufferings\r\nof the patient's family, regardless of their unwitting insistence.\r\nOnce the disease has developed and the patient's mind becomes affected\r\nit may be thought that psychotherapy is no longer of value. As a\r\nmatter of fact, these patients as a rule become more childlike and are\r\nmuch more affected by suggestion than in their normal states. All this\r\nis worthy of careful attention on the part of the physician who feels\r\nthat it is his duty to treat patients and not merely their disease.\r\n\r\nThe psychic care of the patient is the most important element in any\r\n{534} scheme of therapeutics during the longer remissions of paresis,\r\nwhich are sometimes so complete that it is difficult to understand\r\nthat the patient, who is now as sensible as he ever was, only a few\r\nmonths before was doing the most foolish things under the influence of\r\nhis delusions of grandeur and probably within a few months will be\r\nquite as insane as before and perhaps hopelessly demented. The brevity\r\nof these remissions in most cases seems to depend directly on how much\r\nthe patient is persuaded that his disease will return without fail and\r\nrun its inevitable course. It is well worth while to lengthen these\r\nremissions by setting the patient's mind just as much at rest as\r\npossible. Instead of the attitude which is so often assumed of\r\nabsolute assurance on the part of the physician that the old condition\r\nwill inevitably return, it is advisable always to give the opinion\r\nthat the previous mental derangement was paranoiac rather than\r\nparetic, or was perhaps only a passing syphilitic condition and that\r\nthe ultimate outlook is not as hopeless as might be thought. This\r\nopinion is thoroughly justified by certain surprising results in a\r\nnumber of recently reported cases. Some patients whose symptoms have\r\nbeen diagnosed as paresis by excellent diagnosticians, have, after a\r\ntime, experienced a cessation of their symptoms which looked very much\r\nlike a remission occurring in the midst of the inevitably progressive\r\nparetic degeneration and then to the surprise of their physicians have\r\nnot exhibited any further symptoms of the affection. Syphilis of the\r\nnervous system sometimes simulates paresis to such an extent as to\r\ndeceive the most expert, and proper antisyphilitic treatment will\r\nsometimes produce results that are little short of marvelous. It is\r\nbeyond all question, then, for the good of the patient suspected of\r\nparesis that his physician should give him the benefit of every doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY AND PSEUDO-EPILEPSY\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the major neuroses generally, very much more\r\ntherapeutic benefit can be secured than in any other way that we know\r\nby reassuring the patient's mind, by careful regulation of his life\r\nand by such modifications of his occupation as will take him out of a\r\nstrenuous existence, so likely to be harmful to a nervous system\r\nlaboring under these serious handicaps. In recent years we have come\r\nto realize that epilepsy, for instance, is more favorably influenced\r\nby a simple outdoor life in the country without worries and cares,\r\nwith carefully regulated exercise in the open air and special\r\nattention to the digestive tract, than by any formal remedial measures\r\nor drug treatment. The fewer the emotional storms the less likelihood\r\nof repetitions of attacks of epilepsy. No medicine is so effective in\r\nprolonging the intervals between attacks as this placing of the\r\npatient in favorable conditions of mind and body. Our experience with\r\nthe colony system has emphasized the fact that drug treatment is quite\r\na subsidiary factor in this general care for the patient. The most\r\nimportant element in this treatment is the effect on the {535}\r\npatient's mind and the consequent gain in poise and in resistive\r\nvitality against emotional explosions which are so often the immediate\r\noccasion of attacks. This lessens their number and it is well known\r\nthat frequent repetition is likely to be associated with that\r\ndeterioration of the physical nature and mental condition which is\r\nmost to be dreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influences.--When living a quiet placid life without worry\r\nabout himself or his concerns, the number of the epileptic attacks\r\ngoes down in a noteworthy degree and the intervals between them become\r\nlonger and longer. After years of quiet country living epileptics who\r\nhad two or three attacks a week have scarcely more than one a month,\r\nif, indeed, that often, and their general condition is greatly\r\nimproved. We have had many remedies for the affection, only a few of\r\nwhich have proved to be really therapeutic. The remainder have had\r\ntheir effect through the mental influence that went with them, the\r\nassurance of relief and the confidence that it aroused.\r\n\r\nFirst attacks of epilepsy are not infrequently the result of an\r\nimmediately preceding fright or sudden emotion of some kind or other.\r\nGowers tells the story of a sentinel posted near a graveyard who was\r\nvery much disturbed by his proximity to the dead and who, during the\r\nnight, saw a white goat run past him, jump over a low wall and\r\ndisappear. He was sure it was a ghost. He had his first attack of\r\nepilepsy shortly after. Children not infrequently have their first\r\nattack after a scare from a dog or a rough-looking stranger who has\r\ncome near them. After the affection has established itself attacks of\r\nepilepsy follow vehement mental disturbances of any kind. Sometimes\r\nafter a long interval of freedom from attacks a sudden strong emotion\r\nis followed by a fit and then the epileptic habit is reestablished. In\r\norder to be as free as possible from the affection patients must be\r\nprotected from emotional storms.\r\n\r\n\r\nPower of Suggestion.---A strong proof of the favorable influence of\r\nsuggestion upon epilepsy was given when operations for epilepsy became\r\ncommon about twenty years ago. A number of patients were operated on\r\nby trephining, even though almost nothing else was done except to open\r\nthe dura and examine the brain, for often no definite pathological\r\ncondition to justify surgical intervention was found. But these\r\npatients did not suffer from attacks of epilepsy for months and\r\nsometimes years afterwards. Many surgeons reported these cases as\r\ncured, as they apparently were when discharged from the hospitals, for\r\nno attacks had recurred; but physicians had to treat them later when\r\ntheir epilepsy redeveloped. The surgical procedure, as indeed might\r\nhave been expected from the findings, had given only temporary\r\nbetterment. The real therapeutic factor at work had probably been not\r\nany definite change within the skull, but the suggestive influence of\r\nthe operation, the period of rest with favorable suggestion constantly\r\nrenewed, and the confidence of recovery inspired during convalescence.\r\nEven in cases where adhesions were found between the dura and\r\ncalvarium and these were broken up, the relief afforded was usually\r\nbut temporary. The succession of events, the relief afforded and\r\nsubsequent relapse, probably represented the same influence of\r\nsuggestion as in the preceding cases with perhaps a slight physical\r\nbetterment in addition.\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the psychotherapeutics of epilepsy is to\r\nrelieve the patient as far as possible from the haunting dread of\r\ninsanity, which, especially if he has read much of the disease, is so\r\nlikely to hang over him as {536} a pall because of the absolutely bad\r\nprognosis which often occupies so prominent a place in older\r\ntext-books and articles on epilepsy. There is no doubt that in a great\r\nmany cases epilepsy is a progressive degenerative disease and that a\r\nstate of lowered mentality will eventually develop. There are many\r\ncases, however, in which epilepsy is only a series of incidents which\r\ndoes not seem to affect the intellectual life and which is quite\r\ncompatible not only with prolonged existence, but with mental\r\nachievements of a high order and, above all, with a personality that\r\nmay be commanding in its power over others. This knowledge, which\r\nunfortunately is not usually given in text-books because they are\r\nstudies in the pathology rather than in the psychology of epilepsy, is\r\nextremely important for the epileptic. This view is of special\r\nsignificance for those sufferers from the disease who are well\r\neducated and in whom mentality means so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Individual in Epilepsy.--In epilepsy, indeed, the individual\r\ncounts much more than his ailment, and even in severe cases of\r\nepilepsy there are individuals to whom the recurring convulsions are\r\nonly annoying occurrences of life, somewhat dangerous because of the\r\nrisks encountered during unconsciousness, but without any ulterior\r\nsignificance for degeneration of character or intellectual power. As a\r\nmatter of fact, there are many men in history who were epileptics and\r\nwho yet succeeded in great work of many kinds, even purely\r\nintellectual, unhampered by this condition, and some of them have\r\nproved to be leaders in achievement. In his paper read before the\r\nNational Association for the Study of Epilepsy and the Care and\r\nTreatment of Epileptics, at its eighth annual meeting. Dr. Matthew\r\nWoods discussed what certain famous epileptics had accomplished in\r\nspite of epilepsy. He takes three typical examples--Julius Caesar,\r\nMohammed and Lord Byron--the founders, respectively, of an empire, a\r\nreligion and a school of poetry--with regard to whom there is\r\nconvincing evidence that they were epileptics. A fourth name, that of\r\nNapoleon, might easily have been added. Greater accomplishments than\r\nthese epileptics made in their various departments are not to be found\r\nin the history of the race.\r\n\r\nMany other names of epileptics distinguished for achievement might\r\nwell have been added to the list. The argument that would be founded\r\non their lives is not that epileptics are necessarily or even usually\r\nof high intelligence, but that some of them, at least, retain in spite\r\nof the major neurosis, or even serious brain disorder, whichever it\r\nmay be, all their intellectual qualities undisturbed. Lombroso,\r\narguing from the other standpoint, has pointed out that there is a\r\nclose relation between genius and insanity, and he sets down epilepsy\r\nas one of the forms of insanity (mental un-health) often associated\r\nwith extraordinary mental qualities. A study of this subject is\r\nextremely reassuring to the epileptic who is prone to think from\r\ntraditions with regard to the disease that his fate is almost sure to\r\nbe a gradual lapse into imbecility. No epileptic is likely to be at\r\nall worried over the suggestion that epilepsy and genius are allied,\r\nfor since he has the one he is quite willing that the other shall\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--Reassurance is especially important when patients develop\r\nepilepsy in adult life. There is an unfortunate social stigma attached\r\nto the disease which adds to the unfavorable suggestions that are\r\nlikely to run with it. This probably cannot be overcome, for it is a\r\nheritage, not alone of many {537} generations, but of many centuries.\r\nOur better knowledge of epilepsy, however, should gradually take the\r\ndisease out of the sphere of suspected mystery in which it has been\r\npopularly placed and set it among the diseases to which human nature\r\nis liable, but which is surely as physical in its character as any\r\nother. If a favorable attitude of mind on the patient's part can be\r\nsecured there is less necessity for many of the disturbing drugs that\r\nare used and there seems to be no doubt that even in producing the\r\neffect of these, such as it is, suggestion of a favorable character\r\nplays a large role. Over and over again in the history of the\r\naffection we have had remedies introduced which have seemed to be\r\nquite efficient in producing longer intervals between attacks, making\r\nthe patient less nervous and putting him in better physical health.\r\nAfter a time, however, these have proved to be quite useless, or at\r\nmost of but very slight value. It was suggestion that gave them their\r\napparent value, and this suggestion must be used without the drugs\r\nwhenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe bromides have done good in the treatment of epilepsy, but they are\r\nthe only drugs that maintain the reputation they first had. All the\r\nothers accomplished whatever benefit they conferred on the patient,\r\nand some of them for a time seemed to excellent authorities of large\r\nexperience to give marvelous results, through their influence over the\r\npatient's mind. Nothing can produce more confidence in the physician\r\nwho is using suggestion for epilepsy than this fact. Even the\r\nbromides, unless used carefully, easily do more harm than good and\r\nthey have often worked mischief. Favorable suggestion cannot do harm.\r\nAt the present time those of largest experience in the treatment of\r\nepileptics, the directors of farm colonies, as Dr. Shanahan of Craig\r\nColony, insist that diet, hygiene, especially hydrotherapy, are of\r\nmuch more importance than drugs, but that the patient's attitude of\r\nmind towards himself and his malady and the future of it is even more\r\nimportant. He must have occupation of mind so as not to worry about\r\nhimself. He must have recreation so as to relieve the gloom so likely\r\nto come in the disease. He must have outdoor air and proper exercise,\r\nwhich these patients are so prone to neglect.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the subject most in recent years agree that the\r\ngreat majority of cases of epilepsy are not primarily due to acquired\r\ncauses, but to some congenital defect, so that there is an inherent\r\ninstability of the nervous system. This makes the patient liable to\r\nexplosions of nerve force, figuratively represented as boilings over\r\nof nervous energy, when not properly inhibited. Once such a paroxysm\r\noccurs it is likely to happen again, and very often it brings on\r\ngradual degeneration of the nervous system and of mentality. In many\r\ncases, however, this degeneration can be delayed or even completely\r\nkept off by putting the patient under favorable conditions. These\r\npatients need, above all, to realize that they cannot live the\r\nstrenuous life nor even the ordinary busy life of most people. They\r\nare as cripples compelled to limit the sphere of their activities. If\r\nthey will but take this to heart, however, and not attempt too busy\r\noccupations, they may live quite happy lives for many years, and if\r\nmentally content and without worrying anxieties they will have so few\r\nattacks as to incur only to a slight degree the dangers inevitably\r\nassociated with fits of unconsciousness. To get the epileptic's mind\r\ninto a condition of satisfaction with his condition must be the main\r\nportion of the treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n{538}\r\n\r\nPSEUDO-EPILEPSY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a large and important field of psychotherapeutics in a class\r\nof cases so closely related to epilepsy that it is often extremely\r\ndifficult to make the differential diagnosis between the two varieties\r\nof seizure. Fifteen years ago, while I was at the Salpetriere, there\r\nwas much discussion of a variety of attack called hystero-epilepsy, in\r\nwhich the patients' symptoms were such that it was difficult if not\r\npractically impossible to decide whether the case was true epilepsy or\r\nmerely hysteria. Personally I do not think there is any third,\r\nintermediate variety deserving a separate term. The attacks are either\r\nhysterical, or, to use a less objectionable name, neurotic, or they\r\nare genuinely epileptic, that is, due to some as yet not well-defined\r\nchange in the brain, and therefore not likely ever to be completely\r\nrelieved. To decide whether a given case is neurotic or epileptic,\r\nhowever, is sometimes quite out of the question until long and careful\r\nstudy of it has been made. It is true that such signs as full loss of\r\nconsciousness, biting of the tongue, the so-called epileptic cry,\r\ninvoluntary urination, dangerous falls and the like in the midst of an\r\nattack, have often been declared to be signs of true epilepsy, but\r\nthere are cases in which one or other of these signs has been present,\r\nyet the subsequent course of the affection has shown them to be\r\nfunctional and not organic in origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Simulation of Epilepsy.--Nearly every physician who has\r\nreasonably large experience with neurotic patients has seen cases in\r\nwhich there were recurrent attacks of loss of consciousness that came\r\non sometimes at most inopportune moments, that rendered the patient\r\nquite incapable of caring for himself for the moment, yet lacked many\r\nof the signs of true epilepsy. Teachers sometimes complain of a\r\ncomplete lapse of memory that begins without warning and then recurs\r\nat intervals, making their work very difficult. Preachers sometimes\r\nbring the story of having lost the thread of their discourse and\r\nforgetting absolutely what they were talking about, there being a\r\ncomplete blank for some seconds at least. Occasionally such lapses are\r\nassociated with falls that resemble fainting spells and seem to be\r\naccompanied by complete loss of consciousness. Usually after them\r\nthere is a distinct tired feeling and an inclination to sleep, though,\r\nas a rule, there is a more marked tendency to want to get away from\r\nobservation. Some of the cases are much more severe than those\r\ndescribed and the conclusion that they are true epilepsy seems\r\ninevitable, yet they recover so completely that this conclusion is\r\nnegatived.\r\n\r\nOccasionally such attacks occur only when the patient has been\r\nstrenuously exerting mind or body for a much longer period than usual.\r\nIn teachers it is likely to occur toward the end of the year or in the\r\nmidst of the hard work about examination time. In students this same\r\nperiod is likely to be a favorite starting point for the attacks and\r\nthey recur oftener at this time than at others. Very often there is a\r\nstory of some digestive disturbance in connection with the attacks. At\r\ntimes it seems possible to trace them to some interference with the\r\ncerebral circulation through a distended stomach pressing upward\r\nthrough the diaphragm and interfering with the heart action. In such\r\ncases stomach resonance will sometimes be found as high as the fifth\r\nrib {539} and the apex beat may be pushed out to the nipple line or\r\nbeyond it. This may be true though there are no signs of valvular\r\nlesions and no symptoms or physical signs of dilatation or hypertrophy\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Suggestive Element_.--Analysis shows the real course of the\r\ntrouble in these cases. The sufferer is usually following a sedentary\r\noccupation, not getting much exercise or diversion and prone to\r\nintrospection. Many symptoms of themselves of no importance have been\r\nemphasized by concentration of attention on them. Especially is this\r\ntrue of any heart irregularity. The patient has dreaded for some time\r\nlest the feeling of pressure in the precordia and of discomfort in the\r\nheart might not sometime interfere with him in the midst of his\r\nteaching or preaching duties. Some day when he is feeling much worse\r\nthan usual, in the midst of his work, there comes over him the feeling\r\nthat now his intellect is going to stop action because there is\r\nsomething the matter with him. The sudden concentration of his\r\nattention on this with the fear of the consequences and the\r\nuncomfortable feeling that he will not be able to go on with his flow\r\nof ideas, cuts off the thread of what he is thinking about and puts\r\nbut one single object before him--this possibility of failure of\r\nmental action. Usually the first attack is only such an interruption\r\nas is thus indicated. The fear of subsequent attacks, the worry over\r\nwhat has happened, the dread that some serious mental affection or\r\nnervous disease is at work emphasizes introspection and subsequent\r\nattacks are even more likely to be serious, and especially to last\r\nlonger than the first.\r\n\r\nThe more the cases are studied the more the conclusion comes that in\r\nmany of these instances it is nothing more than auto-suggestion that\r\nis responsible for the mental lapse. It is true that some physical\r\ncondition may be the occasion, though the mental state is the active\r\nimmediate cause. Suddenly concentrated attention on the dread of\r\nmental interruption inhibits mental action and what was dreaded\r\nfollows almost necessarily. It is a sort of auto-hypnotism in which\r\nthe patient's train of thought is interrupted by a momentary or longer\r\nhypnotic state the causes of which can be traced. Even when there is a\r\nreal organic lesion of the heart, the lapses of memory and even of\r\nreasoning power that occasionally occur, have often seemed to me to be\r\ndue rather to the patient's dread than to any real physical condition.\r\nI cannot think that there is a sufficient interruption of the cerebral\r\ncirculation, even though only for a moment, to cause such a lapse. It\r\nis a question of nerve interferences rather than of blood supply. If\r\nthe blood were diverted, even though only for a moment, or if there\r\nwas a stoppage, the consequences would be more serious and more\r\nlasting than they are.\r\n\r\nWhat evidently happens is some disturbance of neurotic connections\r\nwithin the brain brought on by sudden dread or emotion. The will has\r\nlost control or has seriously disturbed the conducting apparatus. The\r\nbest proof that this is what happens and that it is not the result of\r\norganic change is found in the fact that when the physical occasion,\r\nthat is, the digestive disturbance or the heart palpitation which is\r\nthe initial factor in these states, is relieved, the attacks do not\r\ntake place. Patients in whom they have occurred even for years cease\r\nto have them. This improvement does not begin, however, until their\r\nsolicitude over their condition has been lessened by a confident\r\ndeclaration to them that they are suffering from merely functional and\r\nlocal reflex conditions apart from the brain itself. Usually it needs\r\nto be made clear {540} to them, too, that their anxiety in the matter\r\nmeans much more for the continuance of the attacks than any physical\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAlmost invariably patients somewhat resent this suggestion. Their\r\nresponse to this explanation of their ailment usually is that the\r\nattacks come on them when they are not particularly expecting them and\r\nthat there is first some physical symptom which might readily be taken\r\nfor a sort of aura to a genuine epileptic attack and then the attack\r\nitself comes on. It is this preceding symptom, pain or discomfort, or\r\nwhatever else it may be, that provokes the suggestive element and\r\nbrings about the state of quasi-hypnosis, which is the main part of\r\ntheir attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Syncopal Attacks.--Some of the cases of pseudo-epilepsy are\r\nvery mild, though if the word epilepsy has been mentioned there\r\nnaturally arises a feeling of dread in patient and friends with\r\nconsequent unfavorable suggestion. A type not infrequently seen has\r\nfor its main symptom a period, usually of but short duration, in which\r\nthere is an intense tired feeling so that even the eyelids droop and\r\nrequire effort to lift them. During such attacks the respirations may\r\nslow down to fifteen or below, though usually the pulse is inclined to\r\nbe rapid. The feeling of fatigue is almost entirely subjective, in the\r\nsense that, if patients are required to do something, they are able to\r\naccomplish it by a little urging, though a moment before they were\r\nsure that they could not. Such attacks are invariably functional, have\r\nno organic basis and do not deserve the name of epilepsy. If called\r\nhysterics this will cause the patient, who is often a woman, to rouse\r\nherself and so gradually overcome them. They are really a loss of\r\nconfidence in one's power to do things and a passing astasia-abasia.\r\nThe use of the word hysterics may cause the patient to lose the\r\nsympathy of her friends, though she may need it; for often there is an\r\nunderlying pathological condition not in the nervous but in the\r\nsomatic system. Sometimes the patients are anemic, sometimes they have\r\nan abortive form of Graves' disease, and sometimes they are low in\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nThese conditions give the indication for treatment. What is needed is,\r\nof course, improvement of the general condition, but, above all, a\r\nrestoration of the patient's confidence in herself. Once it is made\r\nclear to her that the attacks are largely subjective, that is, are due\r\nto a feeling of prostration because of the fear that she is unable to\r\ndo something, then the intervals between the attacks will gradually\r\ngrow longer. It is important that long hours of sleep should be\r\nadvised with plenty of fresh air, and that whatever disturbances of\r\nthe digestive system are present should be carefully treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudo-Epilepsy and the Menopause.--A number of these cases of\r\npseudo-epilepsy occur at the menopause. They seem particularly likely\r\nto occur in women who have not much to occupy themselves with.\r\nChildless women who have no cares and enjoy every luxury sometimes\r\nseem to have these pseudo-epileptic attacks as equivalents for the\r\nflushings of the ordinary menopause. During \"a rush of blood to the\r\nhead\" they lose control of themselves. Occasionally mothers who have\r\ntwo or three daughters and who get their menopause late in life, that\r\nis, well after fifty, are especially likely to suffer in the same way.\r\nThe solicitude of those near them seems to eliminate some of their\r\npower of inhibition and makes them think overmuch of themselves. If\r\nthen they keep much at home, as women at this time are prone to do,\r\nhave few {541} diversions of mind, little fresh air and exercise,\r\nthere is an accumulation of unused nervous energy which dissipates\r\nitself in explosive attacks very like epilepsy. It is with regard to\r\nthese that the term hystero-epilepsy almost seems justified. Just as\r\nsoon as occupation and diversion of mind and relaxation of the\r\nsolicitude of friends for them is secured they begin to get better.\r\n\r\nThe differential diagnosis of these cases is made from the absence of\r\ncertain of the pathognomic signs of true epilepsy. The tongue is not\r\nbitten, involuntary urination does not take place, and when the\r\npatient falls she does not hurt herself as a rule, though occasionally\r\nthe fall may result in accidental abrasions or bruises, but these are\r\nquite trivial. If stress is laid upon the fact before these patients\r\nthat they do not present any or all of the symptoms of epilepsy, some\r\nof them are likely to occur a little later. Slight abrasions on the\r\ntongue will be noted and the sputum will become a little bloody. Even\r\nvery cleanly women will sometimes wet themselves. It is not a\r\ndeliberate attempt at deception, but their curious psycho-neurotic\r\ncondition causes suggestion to act upon them. Their attacks are really\r\nauto-hypnotic and during these the remarks made by the physician occur\r\nas suggestions and then are accomplished. If the suggestions in this\r\nmatter have been carelessly made by previous physicians the attacks\r\nwill so closely simulate true epilepsy that it will often be almost\r\nimpossible to differentiate them with assurance.\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary diagnosis of these cases, as well as of all other\r\ncases of pseudo-epilepsy, we must, as far as possible, avoid the use\r\nof the word epilepsy, even of hystero-epilepsy. The unfavorable\r\nsuggestion attached to such terms will have the worst possible effect.\r\nThere is no need to fear that the patient will be any less taken care\r\nof, if the disease is called by some other name, for instance,\r\nneurotic paroxysms or nervous attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCure by Suggestion.--Such patients are often cured by remedial\r\nmeasures of one kind or another that are administered with the\r\nconfident declaration that they will get well. A number of cases of\r\nepilepsy which were really of this character have been reported cured\r\nby Eddyism. A number also have been very favorably influenced by\r\nosteopathic treatment. Needless to say, the reports of such cured\r\ncases have not been diminished in significance by the publicity\r\nbureaus of these various cults. Mental healing has relieved a number\r\nmore. Usually this relief has been afforded these cases after they had\r\ntried regular physicians who had treated them in the ordinary way with\r\nbromides, without doing anything more than causing them to miss a few\r\nattacks for a temporary period of relief, if even that, giving them\r\nbromism and further increasing their solicitude about themselves by\r\nunconsciously emphasizing their ideas as to how serious epilepsy can\r\nbe. The cures of these cases are not due to the various treatments to\r\nwhich the patients proclaim their debt of gratitude, but to the\r\nconfident assurance given them that their condition is not serious,\r\nand will be cured. After analysis of their attacks has shown them to\r\nbe neurotic and not genuinely epileptic, the regular medical\r\npractitioner can readily do as much and even more; for psychotherapy\r\nhas much more to do in affording relief in these cases than any other\r\nform of treatment. It must be applied with confidence and the results\r\nare often most favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n{542}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS AGITANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a chronic affection of the nervous system having for its most\r\ncharacteristic symptom a tremor, but with marked muscular rigidity and\r\nweakness. It is much more common in men than in women, in almost the\r\nreverse proportion of Graves' disease. It is usually a disease of the\r\nold, but may occur in early middle life and has been known to develop\r\neven early in the twenties. In the old days when malaria was a common\r\ndiagnosis for many different conditions, paralysis agitans apparently\r\nfollowed malaria so often that there was thought to be some connection\r\nbetween the two diseases. The more we have learned of malaria the less\r\nlikely this seems to be. Continuous exposure to cold for long periods\r\nand to dampness during the daily occupation for years, or repeated\r\nsevere wettings, have been considered as causative elements. None of\r\nthese physical factors, however, has been as directly connected with\r\nthe occurrence of the affection as various emotional conditions, and\r\nthe thought is suggested that even in cases of severe exposure the\r\nworry and fright and solicitude incident to the fear in an elderly\r\nperson that this exposure will have serious consequences, is an\r\nimportant etiological element.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychic Factors.--_Fright_.--Practically all the authorities agree\r\nthat mental conditions are prominent factors in the production of the\r\ndisease. Serious business cares and worries and anxieties have often\r\nlong preceded its development. Fright is mentioned by nearly all those\r\nwho write on the subject as at least an occasion for the development\r\nof paralysis agitans if not a cause. One of my own most interesting\r\ncases occurred in the sheriff of a county of the Southwest who had\r\nearned for himself the deep enmity of an Indian by arresting him. Not\r\nlong afterwards one Sunday morning when the sheriff quite unarmed came\r\nround a corner he found the Indian just in front of him wildly drunk\r\nand armed with a rifle. At once the rifle went to the Indian's\r\nshoulder, but he did not want to kill his man without having his\r\nrevenge by torturing him, so he did not pull the trigger, but\r\nannounced to him in vigorous though broken English that he had him now\r\nand was going to kill him. The sheriff tried to parley and for a\r\nmoment the Indian permitted him to do so, apparently in order to\r\nprolong the agony. They were not more than two yards apart at the\r\nbeginning, and the sheriff took his only chance and jumped and knocked\r\nthe gun up. It went off just as he did so, the bullet singeing his\r\nhair. He succeeded in arresting the Indian and throwing him into jail,\r\nbut the next day a tremor developed in the arm which had grasped the\r\nrifle. This spread and finally became typical of paralysis agitans. He\r\nwas a man only slightly past fifty and there had been no preliminary\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Control of Symptoms.--Many similar cases following fright or\r\nvehement emotion have been reported, so that it is easy to understand\r\nthe feeling that the affection has a large psychic element in it,\r\nthough evidently from its persistency and its continued development,\r\nthere is some underlying pathological condition. The tremor may be\r\ncontrolled in voluntary {543} movements, while emotion exaggerates it.\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that concentration of will and the\r\ndefinite effort to control the symptoms enables the patient to rid\r\nhimself of them to a great degree for a time at least. It has been\r\nnoted frequently that when a consultant physician is called the\r\npatient will be better for the day of the consultation than he had\r\nbeen for months before. The visits of particular friends will often\r\narouse a sufferer to such efforts as greatly lessen his rigidity,\r\ndecrease his tremor and make him capable of getting around better than\r\nbefore. The state of mental depression that commonly develops in these\r\ncases exaggerates the symptoms, adds neurotic and even physical\r\nconditions that develop from lack of exercise and air, and makes the\r\npatient's general state much worse than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathology.--Our scanty but growing knowledge of the pathology of\r\nparalysis agitans makes it clear that the disease is, in typical\r\ncases, probably due to an overgrowth of connective tissue, the\r\nneuroglia cells, in the central nervous system. Just what causes this\r\novergrowth of connective tissue is not clear. It is an exaggeration of\r\na normal senile process. Apparently one of the processes of age in man\r\nis a decadence of the vitality of important higher tissues with a\r\ncorresponding increase of vitality in the lower or connective tissues.\r\nWhen Flourens declared at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences\r\nthat such an overgrowth of connective tissue was natural with\r\nadvancing years, he added that this probably accounted for the\r\nslowness with which older men come to conclusions. The old members of\r\nthe Academy did not accept this new-fangled doctrine with equanimity.\r\nThey were inclined to think that their conservatism and deliberateness\r\nwere due to greater poise of intellect.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that at least a comparative overgrowth of\r\nconnective tissue is characteristic of the brain in advancing years.\r\nIn some people this occurs to a greater extent and is more precocious\r\nthan in others. Just what causes are responsible for individual\r\ndifferences we do not know. Paralysis agitans is seen often in those\r\nwho have worked hard most of their lives, but, on the other hand, may\r\noccur in those who have lived sedentary lives, and in people of all\r\noccupations. Over-indulgence in alcohol, though this is often thought\r\nto predispose to the disappearance of the parenchyma of organs and to\r\nthe overgrowth of connective tissue, does not seem to have any place\r\nin the etiology of this affection. Its occurrence is a part of that\r\nmystery by which the equilibrium of different kinds of cells in the\r\nbody is maintained or diminished. In a mild way paralysis agitans\r\nrepresents such a change in the central nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influences.--With an overgrowth of connective tissue as the\r\npathology of the disease there would seem to be no question of any\r\nrelief of its symptoms or any benefit to be derived from\r\npsychotherapy. Anyone who has much to do with cases of paralysis\r\nagitans, however, knows that they are extremely susceptible to mental\r\ninfluences. Whenever there is anything that interests them, any\r\nbusiness that they feel they must do, any special event that they look\r\nforward to, they will for days at a time be so much improved in\r\ngeneral symptoms as to be greatly encouraged themselves and make their\r\nfriends feel hopeful with regard to them. When they give in to their\r\ncondition, however, and make no special effort at self-control and\r\nstimulation their symptoms increase very much. Their rigidity\r\nparticularly increases, their {544} tremor becomes more marked and\r\nvarious inconveniences associated with these two cardinal symptoms are\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of Treatment.--_The Vibrating Chair_.--It is interesting to\r\nrecall some of the forms of treatment which have been reported as\r\nbeneficial in paralysis agitans, because they illustrate how much the\r\ninfluence of the patient's mind has over his bodily condition and how\r\nmuch the interest aroused in any new and particularly in any unusual\r\nform of treatment has in mitigating symptoms and how often it seems to\r\nbring about remissions in the progress of the disease. Twenty years\r\nago Charcot suggested the use of a mechanically vibrating arm-chair.\r\nHe had noticed that patients who travelled by rail seemed to have\r\ntheir symptoms improved for the time at least by the shaking up in the\r\ntrain. This treatment undoubtedly made patients much less rigid and\r\nmuch less tremulous. The improvement lasted sometimes for hours and\r\nsometimes for days. It was tried rather extensively and everywhere\r\nwith reported good results, when first tried at least. After a time it\r\nwas found that it failed to have the desired effect. Apparently\r\nwhatever therapeutic value it had was due to the interest aroused in\r\nthe patient's mind and the consequent effort that was made to control\r\nhis muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Suspension Treatment_.--When the method of treatment by\r\nsuspension became popular for cases of locomotor ataxia, the idea came\r\nto try the same thing for paralysis agitans. Accordingly suspension\r\napparatuses of many kinds were used with reported good results.\r\nPatients were suspended by the neck for some minutes and some of them\r\ngot used to the treatment and could stand it for a prolonged period.\r\nThe effect was always a distinct mitigation of symptoms. The rigidity\r\nparticularly became much less marked, but the tremor also was lessened\r\nand besides certain secondary symptoms were bettered. Constipation was\r\nimproved, partly because patients were more cheerful, ate more\r\nheartily and, above all, were willing to make some effort in order to\r\nget out regularly into the air. There was a variety in life, different\r\nfrom the solitary sitting at home into which these patients so often\r\ndrift. Sleep was better at night and the subjective sensations of heat\r\nand cold were lessened. Patients were encouraged to think of\r\nimprovement and used all their available nervous energy. In the same\r\nway when overstretching of the spinal cord by forcibly bending of the\r\nbody at the hips was tried with reported success in tabes it was also\r\napplied to paralysis agitans with similar improvement of symptoms.\r\nBoth methods of treatment have gone out for both these affections and\r\nevidently their observed therapeutic efficiency at first was entirely\r\ndue to their effect upon the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psychic Elements and Other Remedies_.--When organo-therapeutics\r\nbecame the fad paralysis agitans was treated also by this method. Some\r\ncases were treated with reported good results by thyroid. Later when\r\nthe parathyroids attracted attention they were administered with\r\nreported good success in even very severe cases. I think that there is\r\na report of some cases of paralysis agitans being improved by\r\ninjections of diphtheria serum. In other words, anything that was\r\ngiven to a patient with the promise that he would be better after it\r\nand that produced a definite effect upon his mind was likely to do him\r\ntemporary good. If the remedy had some special theory behind it, if\r\nthere was a story of some new scientific significance for the material\r\nemployed or the method of giving it, then this improvement was sure to\r\ntake place. {545} In the drug treatment of the disease the same\r\nprinciples applied. Earlier, when nitrate of silver was the main\r\nrecourse for organic nervous diseases, cases were reported improved by\r\nits administration. When the alterative properties of arsenic became a\r\ntherapeutic fad this produced good effects. Atropin had for some time\r\na reputation of relieving patient's symptoms. After a time all of them\r\nceased to be used to any extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Frenkel Method_.--In recent years the application of the Frenkel\r\ndirected movement method, modified somewhat from its application in\r\ntabes, has attracted attention in the therapeutics of paralysis\r\nagitans. It is interesting to note how often a mode of treatment that\r\nhas been applied successfully to one of these diseases has also proved\r\nsuccessful with the other. The two diseases are, of course, very\r\ndifferent in etiology and pathology; but have one thing in common. The\r\ncontrol over muscles has been lost to some degree in both cases in the\r\nprogress of the disease, and a special effort of attention is required\r\non the part of the patient in order to regulate movement. Anything\r\nthat will arouse the patient to make this special effort will relieve\r\nthe symptoms for a while and in tabes may bring about a lasting\r\nimprovement, because the habit becomes easier after a time, though\r\napparently this does not occur in paralysis agitans, except perhaps in\r\nthe younger patients. It might very well be expected, then, that\r\nFrenkel's method in many cases would do good in paralysis agitans and\r\nit has proved to be another adjunct in the treatment of the affection.\r\nIt must be used with great care not to exhaust the patient, but this\r\nis true also in tabes. The real source of its therapeutic quality\r\nseems to be the patient's interest in it and if this cannot be aroused\r\nit usually fails to do good. The success of these various mechanical\r\nmethods makes it easy to understand why these patients often improve\r\nfor a time under osteopathic treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psychotherapy_.--It is clear, then, that the most important aid for\r\nthese cases is the arousing of mental interest in some form of\r\ntreatment that promises to be of benefit to them. New forms of\r\ntreatment cannot always be invented and mental occupation must be\r\nsecured by interest in other things. Patients suffering from paralysis\r\nagitans are prone to allow themselves to give up efforts to do things\r\nin which their interest would be aroused. They must be encouraged to\r\ndo many things. Carriage riding, automobiling, train excursions,\r\nbecause of the effort required to resist vibration, are all helpful.\r\nThey must not be allowed to drift into vacuous habits in which they\r\nmake no effort for themselves. They can thus be made much more\r\ncomfortable and most of their symptoms can be relieved to a marked\r\ndegree. This requires constant attention and ever-renewed efforts to\r\narouse the patient's mind and to have him make such efforts as will\r\novercome rigidity and control the tremor to some extent; but with care\r\nan amelioration of the condition can always be brought about and can\r\nbe maintained, at least to the extent of making the patient much more\r\ncomfortable than would otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n{546}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHEADACHE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the improvement in the general health of the community,\r\ndue to more hygienic living, more healthy food and better ventilation,\r\nheadache, instead of decreasing, has increased to a great degree. Any\r\nnumber of headache cures are advertised in the daily papers, in the\r\nstreet cars, on the signboards, even in medical journals, and besides\r\nthese nearly every druggist has his own special preparation for\r\nheadache, so it would seem as though literally many millions of doses\r\nof these headache cures must be taken every week. It would seem as\r\nthough there must be some special unhygienic factor at work to produce\r\nheadaches at a time when all other pathological conditions are being\r\nreduced in number and severity.\r\n\r\nA study of the patients who are especially affected by headache seems\r\nto furnish evidence as to the special factor that has led to the\r\nincrease of the affection. It occurs much more frequently in women\r\nthan in men. It is complained of particularly by those who have less\r\nregular occupation, and the notable increase has come with the\r\nopportunity for leisure on the part of large numbers of the community\r\ndue to the growth of wealth.\r\n\r\nA feeling of discomfort in the head to which much attention is paid\r\nwill become such a painful condition as to deserve the name of ache,\r\nif it develops in those who have no serious occupation in life and no\r\ninterests that demand peremptory attention. With the noise of many\r\nchildren around them in the olden times women suffered comparatively\r\nlittle from headaches. Most of our grandmothers scarcely knew what it\r\nwas to have a headache. Now most business men are likely to say the\r\nsame thing. Very rarely do they suffer from headache. When they do,\r\nthere is some specific reason and when this is removed the headache\r\ndisappears. There are many women of leisure who have regular headaches\r\nfor which they must have some remedy at hand or the pain becomes\r\nintolerable, but there are few women strenuously occupied with\r\nbusiness affairs or with interests in which their attention is\r\nabsorbed who find themselves under any such necessity.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that certain conditions predispose to headache. The\r\nprincipal of these is having sufficient time to advert to certain\r\nuncomfortable feelings in or around the head. Few people who stop to\r\nthink of what their head feelings are but will find there is some\r\nunusual sensation somewhere in or outside the head which if dwelt upon\r\nbecomes emphasized into an ache. If the mind can be diverted it\r\ndisappears. If there has been some injury of the head or some\r\npathological conditions set up by congestion or anemia, the feelings\r\nmay become emphasized and occupy the center of attention, and even\r\nafter the injury has disappeared or the pathological condition been\r\nameliorated some sensations remain which with advertence produce achy\r\nfeelings of discomfort. This is the history of a great deal of the\r\nincrease of headache in our time. There are, of course, real headaches\r\ndue to definite pathological conditions, but the great majority of\r\nheadaches complained of {547} are the result of over-attention to\r\ncertain sensations, some of them normal, some of them only slightly\r\nabnormal, which are emphasized by concentration of attention on them\r\nuntil they become a torment.\r\n\r\nTwo main classes of headaches come to the physician for treatment. One\r\nclass is seen in patients who suffer from real and even acute pain\r\nthat cannot be distracted by diversion of mind, that is usually worse\r\nwhen they try to sleep, as toothache is, and is evidently due to\r\ndefinite physical disturbance. In the second class are the many queer\r\nfeelings about the head called headaches, though the patient suffers\r\nrather from annoyance than from pain. It is said that the Chinese in\r\nolden times put criminals to a lingering death by fastening them in\r\nsuch a way that a drop of water fell every minute on their heads. It\r\nwas impossible to avoid the falling drop, and its constant recurrence\r\nbecame an awful torture. Any feeling that engrosses consciousness will\r\nbe followed by the same sense of torment. The constant exercise of\r\nfunction of any nerve without rest is of itself physically disturbing\r\nto a serious degree. This must be realized with regard to many forms\r\nof headache which, though trivial in origin, are the source of bitter\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention Headaches.--Professor Oppenheim, in his \"Letters to Nervous\r\nPatients,\" has a paragraph with regard to headache that is worth\r\nrecalling for the benefit of patients who suffer from low-grade\r\nheadaches. Doubtless these were at the beginning real aches due to\r\nsome local condition. They are now due merely to exaggeration of more\r\nor less normal feelings within the head which have come into the realm\r\nof the conscious because of the attention attracted to them when the\r\nintracranial affection was first noted. Professor Oppenheim says:\r\n\r\n  Your headache also I ascribe to this source. Originally it may have\r\n  been a real headache, the result of your nervous shock. There is no\r\n  one who has not at some time had a transient feeling of pain in the\r\n  head or in some other part of the body, quite apart from those\r\n  caused by injuries or painful diseases. Out of a thousand various\r\n  kinds of causes I will mention only an extremely common one: the\r\n  pains which result from straining muscles or nerves. Every sudden\r\n  awkward movement may in this way cause pain in different parts of\r\n  the body, but very specially so in nervous persons, in whom the\r\n  mechanical excitability of the nerves--that is, their sensitiveness\r\n  to pressure and strain--is usually exaggerated. As a rule, however,\r\n  this pain is quite transient. But here again the law of which I have\r\n  been already speaking comes into force: under the stimulating\r\n  influence of introspection the tiny, perishable seed-grain of pain\r\n  grows into the firm, strong, enduring tree of neuralgia or\r\n  psychalgia.\r\n\r\nThe first condition for the successful treatment of headache, then,\r\nmust include the recognition of the possibility of some rather simple\r\npathological condition being exaggerated by over-attention to a\r\ndisturbing affection, or of some affection, now past, having produced\r\na suggestion that, in a mind given to introspection, continues to have\r\ninfluence even to the inveteration of sensations for which there is no\r\nlonger a physical cause.\r\n\r\nThese patients insist that their medical status is that of real pain.\r\nHysterical patients describe a sensation as if a nail were being\r\ndriven into the forehead--the so-called clavus hystericus. In nervous\r\npeople the sense of pressure increases from one of mere discomfort to\r\na positive pain, as a consequence of attention to it. In most cases of\r\nheadache, however, what is most needed is a distraction of the\r\nattention from the ailment. Over and over {548} again I have found\r\nthat when all remedies failed the deliberate search for an occupation\r\nof mind that would interest the patient during many hours of the day\r\nwas the only thing that promised relief and in many cases the relief\r\nafforded was so complete that patients were effusive in their\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power of Distraction_.--The proof that these so-called headaches are\r\nreally not aches is found in the comparative ease with which many of\r\nthem may be suppressed. Almost any interesting occupation will make\r\nthe sufferer forget them entirely and they will not return immediately\r\nafter the occupation ceases, but usually only when the patient is\r\nalone and attention is once more directed to this symptom. These queer\r\nfeelings about the head that are often raised to the dignity of\r\nheadaches by attention and auto-suggestion may be distracted away\r\ncompletely. That they are not pain is shown by the fact that the\r\nordinary remedies which ease pain so promptly often fail to relieve\r\nthese or soon cease to have any effect on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lack of Distractions_.--The apartment hotel system has multiplied the\r\nvictims of headaches. When a woman has nothing in the world to do\r\nexcept get her clothes fitted and attend to what she calls her \"social\r\nduties,\" it is no wonder that her head bothers her. Blood is\r\nconstantly going to the brain and interchange of nutritive elements is\r\ntaking place, yet there is no real function of cells and no\r\nconsumption of material, or at least function is so slight that\r\nconsumption of material must be trivial. There is no reason why these\r\nwomen should get up in the morning. Their breakfast is brought to\r\ntheir rooms, and some of them do not get around until eleven o'clock.\r\nWomen used to have a morning occupation in going out to market or else\r\nin planning the household day with housekeepers, but of course there\r\nis no more of that. In olden times, too, many of them had religious\r\npractices. Now women are likely to be unemployed until the afternoon,\r\nwhich must be occupied at most with so-called social duties that may\r\nbe done if one wishes to do them, but that may be put off for many\r\nreasons and there are constantly recurring reasons for not making any\r\nspecial exertion. Also, the rooms these women live in must be kept at\r\na high temperature because the poorer the air that we breathe the\r\nhigher must be its temperature for comfort, while stimulating fresh\r\nair may be quite low in temperature and yet produce only a brisk\r\nreaction instead of chilly feelings.\r\n\r\nChildren used to be the best possible remedy for these non-occupation\r\nheadaches, but either there are no children any more or there are but\r\none or two and these are largely cared for by _bonnes_ at home and by\r\nvarious schools once they have reached the age of three. The old idea\r\nthat children should not leave home until six put upon the mother the\r\nburden of their early education, but since the coming of the\r\nkindergarten she is relieved of responsibility of this and the mother\r\nof one or two children might now almost as well be childless as far as\r\nany serious occupation from care of her children is concerned.\r\n\r\nIf patients are told all this bluntly there will be a vigorous protest\r\nfrom most of them, for to them their pains are very real. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that a pain in the mind is often worse than in the body.\r\nSome of these women save themselves from having their unused mental\r\nfaculties disturb them from very lack of something to do, by becoming\r\ninterested in charities, in clubs, in social movements of various\r\nkinds, in art and in literature. It is {549} not to these that I\r\nrefer. On the contrary, if women have nothing else to do I would\r\ninsist that they find some cause or movement in which they may become\r\ndeeply interested. Their interest will save them from self-annoyance,\r\nthough it may not exactly add to the gayety of nations in its effect\r\nupon other people. As a physician, however, I am only interested for\r\nthe moment in the good of particular patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource of Pain.--I would not be understood as saying that all\r\nheadaches are not real aches nor pains in the most literal sense of\r\nthe word, for some of them are agonizing tortures. With regard to all\r\nheadaches, however, even the most genuine variety, there are certain\r\nconsiderations that are of value from the standpoint of\r\npsychotherapeutics. The most important of these is assurance as to the\r\nsource or location of the pain. Most people think that it is the brain\r\nitself that is suffering pain and not a little of their suffering is\r\ndue to the fact that they dread the effect of such pain upon the\r\ncerebral tissues and its possible consequences upon their mental\r\nstate. These people will be much relieved to be told at once that the\r\nbrain tissue itself is not sensitive, that when exposed it may be\r\ntouched with impunity without causing any pain. It is the structures\r\nsurrounding the brain that are sensitive. As a rule the lesion that\r\ncauses pain is not progressive and all dreads with regard to serious\r\nafter effects may be put aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nPressure Headaches.--It is important to insist on the fact that, as a\r\nrule, headaches and pains in the head are not due to the brain, but to\r\nextraneous structures within the skull. It is true that brain tumors,\r\ngliomatous and cystic and, above all, the overgrowth of the pituitary\r\nbody in acromegaly give rise to agonizing pains. The cause of these\r\nheadaches is undoubtedly pressure. It is not the pressure upon the\r\nbrain tissue itself, however, that is the underlying cause of the\r\npain, but pressure upon the sensitive structures connected with the\r\nbrain. The same thing is true with regard to congestive headaches.\r\nPain is produced not because vascular congestion presses on sensitive\r\nbrain tissues, for we have no reason to think that any such exist, but\r\nbecause the congested brain exerts pressure upon sensitive filaments\r\nin its integuments. Neuralgia may be unbearable and yet it is borne\r\nwith more equanimity, and less dread of results, because it is felt to\r\nbe in a comparatively unimportant structure. One of the most serious\r\nelements in severe headache is the fear of lasting results in the\r\nbrain tissues, that may lead to disturbance of mentality or to injury\r\naffecting mental processes. Patients find their pain much more\r\nbearable as soon as they are assured that headaches do not lead to\r\nmental disturbances and that, as a rule, even the growth of a tumor\r\ndoes not disturb mentality.\r\n\r\nIn the relation of the brain to the intellectual faculties that are so\r\nclosely associated with it, we must remember that direct connection\r\nbetween the two has not been demonstrated and that the relations of\r\nthe brain and the mind are almost as mysterious as they ever were.\r\nThere are some who still think that the frontal convolutions are\r\nespecially concerned in carrying out mental operations. All that we\r\nknow about them in pathology, however, is that they are the silent\r\nconvolutions. When a lesion occurs in other portions of the brain we\r\nsee the effect of it practically always without delay, in some way,\r\neither in the sensory or motor functions of the body. Large lesions in\r\nthe frontal region, however, often give no sign. Large tumors have\r\nbeen found {550} pushing frontal convolutions from their ordinary\r\npositions without any noticeable effect upon the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nHard Study and Headache.--It is worth while to impart this knowledge\r\nto patients who suffer from headaches, because it at once improves\r\ntheir outlook on life. I have known hard students--men who had spent\r\ntwenty or thirty years in work at a special subject--live in constant\r\ndread that sometime their minds would give way because they frequently\r\nsuffered from headaches, or at least from some uncomfortable\r\nsensations in their heads, which they feared as a portent of ultimate\r\nmental breakdown. The assurance that such a thing is utterly unlikely\r\nand quite apart from the physician's ordinary experience, not only\r\nrelieved their anxiety and made their headaches more bearable, but in\r\na dozen of cases in my note-books the headache has gradually\r\ndisappeared as certain habits of life were corrected and modified, as\r\ntheir habits of eating were varied, as bodily functions were\r\ncontrolled and as diversions of mind were introduced into lives that\r\nhad before been too unvaried for healthy functions.\r\n\r\nI do not think that I have ever seen a case, and I have been closely\r\nin touch with hard students for over twenty years, where I felt that\r\nthe cause of a headache was mental overwork. I have known men who at\r\nthe age of seventy or over have taken but four or five hours of sleep\r\nand who have worked at their favorite subjects for the better part of\r\nhalf a century. They never complained of headaches. Of course, there\r\nare others whose physical and mental power is less and who cannot be\r\nexpected to stand a strain that for large-minded men is only the\r\nnormal exercise of function. It has not been the mental work that they\r\nwere doing, however, that was the source of whatever central nervous\r\ndisturbance was to be found in lesser minds, but worry and anxiety and\r\ndread over what they were doing, anxiety as to what they were going to\r\ndo that constituted the real pathological agents at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Local Conditions_.--A striking case that impresses patients much more\r\nthan the physician's declaration and is more likely to be remembered\r\nand is therefore of psychotherapeutic value, is that of Von Buelow, the\r\nGerman musician. He suffered for many years from excruciating\r\nheadaches. They were so severe as almost to drive him crazy. His only\r\nrelief was morphine and he and his friends lived in the midst of no\r\nlittle dread that sometime or other either the pain or the process\r\nwhich caused it would bring about a deterioration of mentality. After\r\nhis death an autopsy was made. It was found to be a small nerve fiber\r\npinched by a scar in the dura as a consequence of an injury received\r\nwhen Von Buelow was very young. Many other stories of this kind have\r\nbeen told.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that in many cases the pain is not within the\r\nskull itself or at least its cause is not and other sources should be\r\ncarefully looked for. The connection of the eyes with headache has\r\nbeen so well worked out, owing to the initiative of S. Weir Mitchell,\r\nthat nothing more need be said of it. One feature perhaps deserves to\r\nbe mentioned. While strain of accommodation is a frequent source of\r\nheadache and is at once looked for by ophthalmologists, there seems no\r\ndoubt that some headaches, much fewer than accommodation cephalalgias,\r\nare due to muscle difficulties, that is, a lack of balance among the\r\nexternal muscles of the eye, whose full pathological significance has\r\nperhaps not yet been worked out. Headaches are {551} frequently due to\r\nsinus troubles, especially to disturbances in the frontal sinus and to\r\nintranasal difficulties. These must be eliminated before the patient\r\ncan be helped. Sometimes these nasal and sinus difficulties are signs\r\nof a deeper constitutional disturbance, due to lack of fresh air and\r\nexercise and are relieved promptly by the establishment of hygienic\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongestion Headaches.--Some headaches require changes of habit and\r\npersuasion of the necessity for arranging the day's work so as to give\r\nproper intervals for relaxation. Much experience with persons whose\r\nabsorption in their work causes them to miss a meal or delay taking it\r\nfor seven or eight hours from the last time of eating has shown me\r\nthat this disturbance of the routine of vegetative life is\r\nparticularly likely to be followed by headache. This headache is not a\r\nmere dull ache and is much more than a sense of discomfort; it is\r\noften an excruciatingly painful condition that usually does not come\r\non until toward the end of the day and then may seriously disturb\r\nsleep. An interesting thing about this class of headaches is that\r\nnearly always they are increased by lying down. Often only a faint\r\npreliminary symptom of it is apparent when the patients go to bed,\r\nthough they may be wakened after two or three hours of disturbed\r\nslumber by a headache that prevents further sleep, and pass the\r\nremainder of the night in painful wakefulness.\r\n\r\nUsually it becomes impossible to continue lying down. The head must be\r\nraised and much relief is afforded by sitting up. The headache does\r\nnot disappear at once but it will gradually pass away and sleep may be\r\nresumed after a half an hour of sitting up, though the sleeper will\r\nhave to be in a sitting posture. Older people get up and sit in an\r\narm-chair. I have found that placing a chair with a rather long back\r\nbeneath the mattress, the mattress slanting along the chair back at an\r\nangle of about forty-five degrees and then an arrangement of three or\r\nfour pillows above that, will enable these patients to get to sleep\r\nbetter than anything else. The ordinary remedies for headache afford\r\nsome relief, but even very large doses of the coal-tar products will\r\nnot relieve the pain entirely unless some arrangement is made for\r\nkeeping the head quite high and immovable.\r\n\r\nThe headache is evidently due to congestion. The reason for it is\r\nperhaps the failure of the blood to be recalled from the brain to do\r\nits usual physiological work at the digestive tract, with a consequent\r\ndistention of arterioles in the brain so that a little later they do\r\nnot react to prevent congestion. Usually with the headache there is\r\nsome digestive disturbance, a feeling of unrest, flatulency with\r\nperhaps acid eructations. Accordingly the headache is often attributed\r\nto digestive disturbance. But both would rather seem to be effects of\r\nthe same cause--the failure to supply the digestive apparatus with the\r\nproper amount of material to work on at the time when it expects it,\r\nwhile the mental absorption naturally attracts blood to the head. We\r\nknow from delicate experiments made in physiological laboratories that\r\nat times of mental work there is an appreciably larger amount of blood\r\nin the head. A proof of the connection between the lack of a meal and\r\nthe headache seems to be the fact that with most people even a glass\r\nof milk and a cracker, taken at the time when the meal is normally\r\neaten, is sufficient to prevent the otherwise inevitable headache.\r\n\r\nWhenever some such simple explanation as this for a headache is found\r\nand the patient made to realize its truth on his own observation, the\r\n{552} significance of the headache at once dwindles and it becomes\r\nmuch easier to bear it. Before the very real pains of it were\r\nemphasized by the dread of the consequences that would result from it.\r\nIf it was really a brain ache patients would find it hard to\r\nunderstand how under its influence even serious changes might not take\r\nplace in the brain. This is only a rational suggestion, but it is\r\nmental healing of the best kind.\r\n\r\nMany of the aches which are spoken of as headaches are really forms of\r\ntenderness associated with the integuments of the skull. Certain of\r\nthe muscles particularly are likely to suffer from achy feelings which\r\nare spoken of as headaches. This is true of certain feelings of\r\ndiscomfort in the frontal region and also of those that occur on the\r\noccipital region. External applications of many kinds relieve\r\nheadaches in these regions, particularly in the frontal region. It is\r\neasy to understand that such applications do not affect the contents\r\nof the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Occipital Aches.--Occasionally I have found that people who\r\ncomplained of a sense of weight at the back of the head, with some\r\nmuscular tenderness, were sleeping on pillows that were too high. They\r\nwere over-exerting these muscles and this gave a sense of fatigue,\r\nwhich when much attention was paid to it, became such an ache or at\r\nleast discomfort as is often found in the occupation neuroses. I have\r\nseen schemata according to which headache complained of at the top of\r\nthe head meant digestive disturbance, headache in the anterior portion\r\nof the head was referred to the eyes or the brain, and headache at the\r\nback of the head spinal exhaustion or severe neurasthenia, but these\r\nare at most very uncertain and I do not think that the tabulation of\r\ncases justifies any such diagram of absolute causes and effect.\r\nUsually there is some local condition that calls particular attention\r\nto a special part of the head and then the attention being\r\nconcentrated complaint is made of that part.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Head Discomfort.--Usually a headache, accompanied by a localized\r\nsense of pressure or weight or constriction, occurs in highly neurotic\r\npeople or those inclined to think much of themselves and whose\r\nattention becomes concentrated on some part. At all times we have\r\nsensations streaming up to our consciousness from every portion of the\r\nbody and anyone who wants to think about them, or a particular set of\r\nthem, can make them sources of considerable discomfort by\r\nconcentration of attention. Sometimes there are special conditions\r\nthat predispose to these localized sensory disturbances. I have known\r\ntight hats to produce such effects. It is sometimes surprising how\r\ntightly hats are worn. Nervous people are prone to overdo everything,\r\nand they overdo the pulling down of their hats. At times the wearing\r\nof a heavy hat will be the root of the trouble. I have known nervous\r\nmen accustomed to wearing high hats all their lives who began to\r\ncomplain of headache when they were in the midst of busy worries and\r\ntroubles of late life, find considerable relief by abandoning their\r\nhigh hats.\r\n\r\n\r\nToxic Headaches.--There are headaches that are due to the taking of\r\nstimulants, as is well known from common experience. The mistake is\r\noften made, however, of thinking that only alcoholic stimulation will\r\ncause a severe headache. Tea and coffee headaches may be quite as\r\nsevere. Whenever people complain much of headache it is important to\r\nrevise their dietary as to the consumption of tea and coffee. Of\r\ncourse, the headaches following {553} alcoholic stimulation are\r\nusually recognized as such, though occasionally a man accustomed to\r\ntaking much alcohol without any such after effects is surprised in the\r\nmidst of the worry incident to business stresses to find that he is\r\nhaving headaches. These are due to the combination of stimulants and\r\ncongestion consequent upon an excess of alcohol with the increased\r\nbrain work that is demanded, or even with the same amount of brain\r\nwork from a tired brain. Gradually stopping the alcohol will do more\r\nto relieve these headaches than anything else. To advise the sudden\r\nstoppage of regular quantities of spirits that have been taken for\r\nsome time, will sometimes produce an anemic headache and defeat the\r\npurpose of the advice.\r\n\r\nWhen for some other reason tea or coffee or alcoholic stimulants are\r\nsuddenly omitted after they have been taken to excess for some time,\r\npatients' complain of a headache. Some of this is probably imaginary,\r\nor at least is due to the idea that their craving for the stimulant,\r\nwhatever it may be, must have a local manifestation, and the head\r\nsensation is exaggerated as a consequence. Tea and coffee cravings may\r\nhere give more trouble than the longing for alcohol. Sometimes there\r\nmay be a real disturbance of the circulation from the lack of the\r\nheart stimulant to which the system is accustomed and therefore an\r\nuncomfortable feeling in the head from brain anemia. This can be\r\novercome by not cutting off the stimulant, whatever it may be, all at\r\nonce, but by bringing about its gradual cessation. These patients,\r\nhowever, are very prone, even with the best of good will in the\r\nmatter, to deceive themselves and find an excuse for not having their\r\nfavorite tipple, be it tea or coffee or alcohol, taken from them, so\r\nthat they readily create symptoms by auto-suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect Mental Treatment.--For both congestive and anemic headaches\r\nmental treatment is important. For those suffering from the congestive\r\nkind the physicians's business is not so much the cure of any one\r\nattack of headache (for this can be accomplished by various now rather\r\nfamiliar anodyne drugs as a rule), but the discovery and removal of\r\nthe cause for the recurring attacks. These will be found in some habit\r\nof the patient which must be corrected. Drugs are seldom needed for\r\nthe underlying condition which occasions the headache, for when it is\r\ndue to such organic affections as brain tumors or other intracranial\r\nlesions, drugs can accomplish very little. In less serious conditions\r\nbenefit may be obtained by having the patient change his attitude\r\ntowards certain important details of his life, such as eating,\r\nsleeping, attention to business or to study and the like, so as to\r\nprevent the mistakes of daily habit that predispose to headache.\r\n\r\nWith regard to anemic headaches, especially those which occur in\r\npersons who are very much run down in weight, the most important\r\nelement of treatment is to bring about an increase in weight. This can\r\nbe accomplished much better through the mind than in any other way.\r\nAppetite is a function of the will, and patients should have an\r\nincrease of diet dictated to them and then be persuaded to follow\r\nthat. I have seen many a headache disappear among teachers, and\r\nreligious workers particularly simply as the result of this measure.\r\n\r\nAs regards headaches for which no definite cause can be found mental\r\ntreatment is the only efficient remedy. Practically nothing but a\r\nchange of mental attitude towards the affection and its underlying\r\ncauses, whether these {554} be neurotic or psychic, will bring about\r\nrelief, and each patient is a problem quite distinct from any other.\r\n\r\nThere is no pretense that this use of mental healing for headache is\r\nnew or even modern. Many stories show that in olden times headaches\r\nwere often relieved by this means, and that suggestion was looked upon\r\nas an important element in the treatment for their relief. In the\r\nchapter on Great Physicians in Psychotherapy the quotation from Plato\r\nwith regard to Socrates curing the headache of his young friend\r\nCharmides illustrates this very well.\r\n\r\nIn the old stories of Greek medicine there are a number of references\r\nto headaches cured by suggestion or at least by mental influence. Miss\r\nHamilton, in her book on \"Incubation,\" [Footnote 40] tells the story\r\nof Agestratos and his headaches and how they were cured at Epidaurus.\r\nAgestratos had a combination of headache and insomnia, the description\r\nof the ailments having a strangely modern air. Just as soon as he came\r\nto the Temple at Epidaurus he fell asleep and had a dream. The God of\r\nMedicine, AEsculapius, whose cult was practiced assiduously at\r\nEpidaurus, came to him in his sleep and promised him the cure of his\r\nheadache and at the same time taught him wrestling and advised its\r\npractice. When day came he departed cured, and continued to practice\r\nwrestling. Not long after he competed at the Nemean Games and was\r\nvictor in the racing. The suggestion that his headache would get\r\nbetter had come to him and at the same time he had been given a\r\nsuggestion that provided him with occupation of mind and body. Many of\r\nthe people who suffer from persistent headaches need this advice more\r\nthan anything else. Probably every physician has had the experience of\r\nheadaches being cured by some interesting exercise, especially if\r\ntaken in the open air. The important factor is the change of mental\r\nattitude, though changes in exercise, diet, amount of sleep and the\r\nlike are helpful auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 40: London, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{555}\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI\r\n\r\n_NEUROSES_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nNERVOUS WEAKNESS (NEURASTHENIA)\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia, from the Greek roots, _neur_, meaning nerve, and\r\n_sthenos_, strength, joined by the negative particle _a_, turning\r\nstrength into weakness, means nothing more than nervous weakness. To\r\ntell a patient that he or she is nervously weak, or is suffering from\r\nnervous weakness is usually not satisfactory, but it may be absolutely\r\ntrue and may represent the limit of our knowledge with regard to the\r\nparticular case. To tell them that they are sufferers from\r\nneurasthenia is satisfying as a rule, because then they have a nice,\r\nlong, and imposing word with which to talk to their friends about\r\ntheir ailment. To discuss with friends one's own nervous weakness is\r\njust a little absurd; to talk over neurasthenia and its symptoms,\r\nhowever, adds importance to those symptoms and makes them seem\r\nmanifestations of some interesting underlying condition.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of symptoms always does harm, but the internal\r\ncomplacency with its constant auto-suggestion of the underlying\r\nnervous disease is still more harmful. Neurasthenia seems to most\r\npeople to signify a new and serious disease of the nervous system\r\nwhich has developed as the result of our high-pressure civilization\r\nand the modern strenuous life, and, therefore, has a special interest\r\nand an exaggerated importance. All of this makes for an unfavorable\r\nattitude of mind towards the affection and encourages the\r\nintensification of symptoms by attention to them. The opposite state\r\nof mind in which symptoms would be given their proper value by the\r\nterm nervous weakness would act as a constant source of favorable\r\nsuggestion. I believe that if the word neurasthenia must be used, it\r\nshould be translated for the patient and the absolutely functional\r\ncharacter of the affection insisted on in order to neutralize its\r\nsuggestive influence.\r\n\r\nProbably the most serious objection to the use of the word\r\nneurasthenia comes from the number of organic affections having vague\r\nnervous symptoms, including especially tiredness, a certain incapacity\r\nto do what was readily done before with tired feelings and a general\r\nfeeling of unfitness, that have come to be grouped under this head. In\r\nthis it resembles the word rheumatism rather strikingly. The\r\ndiagnostic general principles seem to be: tired feelings equal\r\nneurasthenia; achy feelings (especially if worse on rainy days) equal\r\nrheumatism. So whenever either word is used, patients are apt to think\r\nof cases they have known which were labeled by one of these two terms,\r\n{556} rheumatism or neurasthenia and ended by developing some serious\r\ncondition. The unfavorable suggestion consequent upon this has made\r\nmany patients miserable and has prevented them from using their\r\nnervous energy to relieve their condition.\r\n\r\nThe use of the word neurasthenia has another decided disadvantage in\r\nthat the facile recourse to it often keeps the physician from\r\nexamining his patient sufficiently to detect an underlying\r\npathological condition. The term can be made to cover so much that it\r\nhas done great harm in this way. I feel, therefore, that in the\r\ndiscussion of what can be done for patients suffering from nervous\r\nweakness we should first of all describe and set aside a number of\r\nforms of disease that have sometimes masqueraded as \"neurasthenia\" and\r\nthat have given the affection stronger unfavorable suggestiveness. Sir\r\nWilliam Gowers, whom no one would suspect of either minimizing the\r\nsignificance of the word or of the affections that have come to be\r\ngrouped under it, nor of wishing to attract attention by differing\r\nfrom others, has in one of his recent smaller medical works\r\n[Footnote 41] emphasized both of these unfortunate connotations of the\r\nword. Because his expressions as applied to other medical terms that\r\nare too general in their significance, will help physicians to get at\r\nthe real meaning of them I venture to quote his opinion at some\r\nlength:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 41: \"Subjective Sensations of Sight and Sound, Abiotrophy\r\n  and Other Lectures,\" Philadelphia, 1904.]\r\n\r\n  The history of the word \"neurasthenia\" is noteworthy. ... I have to\r\n  confess to the authorship of two words. One, \"myotatic,\" was always\r\n  a puny infant, and I doubt whether it still maintains an independent\r\n  existence. The other, \"knee-jerk,\" instantly attained universal use,\r\n  and indeed, I think has seemed to most persons to have sprung\r\n  spontaneously from the thing itself, without suggestion--perhaps the\r\n  greatest compliment a word can pay its author. But the general use\r\n  at once achieved by \"neurasthenia\" was in spite of a strong\r\n  objection to it which was felt by many. The Royal College of\r\n  Physicians of London could not include it in their \"Nomenclature of\r\n  Disease,\" and yet it is now one of the most common of medical words\r\n  in every language. It would be instructive in more than one way to\r\n  have a careful study of the forces which have influenced its career,\r\n  but that I cannot attempt. We must, I think, admit that not only is\r\n  it a satisfying word to those who suffer, but it has a certain\r\n  convenience which has also compelled many to employ it who at first\r\n  objected. If I may be pardoned for a partial paradox, its\r\n  convenience is not the less real because this rests on features that\r\n  are illusory. Remember that the word is a name which should have\r\n  little meaning, even to those who use it. You may employ it to\r\n  collect the symptoms of the case under a general designation, but do\r\n  not let it cover them as a cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia and Melancholia.--A serious mistake of diagnosis, though\r\nit is often not a mistake of knowledge but of medical judgment, is the\r\nconfusion, apparent or real, of neurasthenia with melancholia. The\r\nword melancholia has come to have a definite serious significance, as\r\nit should, in the minds of many persons and as a consequence\r\nphysicians sometimes hesitate to use it, and employ instead the\r\nall-embracing term neurasthenia, or neurasthenic depression. It is\r\npopularly well known that melancholies are likely to commit suicide if\r\ntheir condition is serious, while neurasthenia is not at all connected\r\nwith the idea of suicide. As a consequence, patients are often not\r\nguarded as they otherwise would be and so we have suicides every {557}\r\nmonth of so-called neurasthenics who were really sufferers from\r\nmelancholia. This sad state of affairs reflects in two ways to the\r\ndetriment of medicine. First, it leaves melancholies without due\r\nprotection. Second, it leads many of the neurotic patients whose\r\nailments have been labeled neurasthenia and who read the stories of\r\nthese supposed neurasthenics, to think that they, too, are tending\r\ntoward suicide and so they are less capable of reacting against their\r\nneurotic condition and in general are much worse for the unfortunate\r\ndread of some such fatal termination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia Simulation by Organic Disease.--Neurasthenia is\r\nespecially a dangerous term since, like other words of this kind with\r\nwide connotation, many quite disconnected diseases may in early stages\r\nsimulate it and give rise to the thought that there is only a\r\nfunctional nervous disease present, when the symptoms are really a\r\nmanifestation of an underlying organic disease, heightened somewhat by\r\na nervous organization or by worry on the patient's part. So-called\r\nneurasthenia in the old must always be looked upon with suspicion.\r\nNeurasthenia in the young may be a purely functional nervous disease,\r\nthough it is probable that in most cases the nervous system is\r\ncongenitally defective, or at least is unable to perform the functions\r\nwhich have been assumed by the patient. If a nervous organization has\r\nstood the strain of the trials of early and middle life, which are\r\nusually severe enough to try out individuals from the physical side,\r\nif they are in moderate circumstances, or from the mental side if they\r\nare wealthy, it will not, as a rule, be overborne by the burdens put\r\nupon it by age unless some organic disease has come to seriously\r\ndisturb it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neurasthenia and Arteriosclerosis_.--There are many serious\r\nconditions that masquerade as neurasthenia. Perhaps the most important\r\nis precocious arteriosclerosis. That a man is as old as his arteries\r\nis now recognized as an absolutely sure maxim of internal medicine. In\r\nmany people the arteries wear out before their time and in all there\r\nis an inevitable wearing out in the course of years. With the\r\nbeginning of degeneration of the arteries there are likely to be many\r\nsymptoms that closely resemble neurasthenia. In the elderly these are\r\nnearly always symptoms of defective circulation because of lack of\r\nelasticity in the arteries and their failure to accommodate themselves\r\nto the variations of pressure in the circulation as the consequence of\r\nchanges of position, variations in the barometer, heat and cold, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nIn these cases a study of the blood pressure will give the\r\ndifferential diagnosis when the actual thickening of the arteries\r\ncannot be felt, but it must not be forgotten that nervous excitement\r\nmay greatly heighten blood pressure on occasions so that a number of\r\nobservations have to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neurasthenia and Bright' s Disease_.--Other general diseases almost\r\ninevitably produce nervous symptoms. It is curious how often a severe\r\nexacerbation of Bright's disease, which has been in existence for some\r\ntime but has given no specific indication, is preceded by a series of\r\nneurotic symptoms thought to be due to nothing more than neurasthenia.\r\nMen of thirty-five to forty-five, the favorite time for the occurrence\r\nof the severe forms of Bright's disease, begin to complain of\r\ntiredness, especially on waking in the morning, of inordinate fatigue\r\nin the evening, of some stomach symptoms and occasionally a tendency\r\nto diarrhea. All of these are ascribed to a neurasthenic condition.\r\nEarly in these cases an examination of the urine should be made {558}\r\nas a routine practice, because if there is nothing in it the patient\r\nwill be just that much more reassured, while if it contains any\r\npathological elements he need know no more about it than his physician\r\ndeems proper, yet the real nature of the case and its indications will\r\nbe appreciated. Without this a physician will often find himself\r\nsuddenly confronted by serious symptoms in a patient when nothing of\r\nthe kind was anticipated because the condition was thought to be\r\nentirely functional.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the symptoms of Bright's disease seem to develop\r\nsuddenly, as it were a storm in the organism out of a clear sky. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, there have been for some time before more or\r\nless indefinite symptoms pointing to some serious process at work,\r\nwhich if valued at their proper worth might have led to a much earlier\r\ndiagnosis of the impending nephritis. Such patients are labeled as\r\nneurasthenics for months and at times even years before the serious\r\nconditions develop which make the recognition of their ailment\r\ncomparatively easy. One case of this kind has come under my\r\nobservation that is interesting in its lessons. A medical student had\r\nduring the first year of his course exhibited every now and then what\r\nseemed to be neurotic symptoms. He was inclined to complain of\r\nheadache for what seemed very slight reasons, and of pains and aches\r\nwhenever there was a change in the weather and especially a fall in\r\nthe barometer. He often had stomach symptoms and was anxious about his\r\nheart; in general he was looked upon as one of the nervous,\r\ncomplaining kind. During the course of a lesson in clinical pathology\r\nin his fourth year, he was asked to furnish a sample of urine which it\r\nwas supposed would be normal, for comparison with an abnormal sample\r\nthat was being investigated in the laboratory. To the surprise of the\r\nprofessor and to his own consternation, his urine was loaded with\r\nalbumin. Up to that time there had been absolutely no objective\r\nsymptoms and only the vague indefinite subjective symptoms mentioned.\r\nThe next day his feet swelled. Even this for a time was considered to\r\nbe rather an index of the neurotic tendency in him to react to very\r\nslight causes. It was hoped that the albuminuria was functional, as\r\nthe examination was made in the full tide of digestion, and that it\r\nwould pass off. Subsequent examinations, however, showed not only\r\nalbumin but also casts. There was a slight intermission of symptoms\r\nand then an exacerbation. Within a month after the chance examination\r\nof his urine and its unexpected result he had a convulsion. Two weeks\r\nlater, altogether six weeks after the albumin was first discovered, he\r\ndied in nephritic coma.\r\n\r\nSuch cases are not so rare as they are thought, though they are seldom\r\nso fulminant. There is a story told of a professor at one of our\r\nAmerican medical schools who, some twenty years ago, took a sample of\r\nhis own urine in order to demonstrate the normal characteristics of\r\nhealthy urine, and to his utter surprise he found albumin and casts in\r\nit. Within six months he was dead from Bright's disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nervous Diarrhea and Organic Disease_.--Other internal conditions may\r\nbe called neurotic when they are really due to definite pathological\r\nentities. For instance, in three cases I have seen what had been\r\npronounced by several physicians to be chronic diarrhea of nervous\r\norigin, proved to be due to quite other and serious pathological\r\nconditions of internal organs. In one of them a chronic diarrhea of\r\nseveral years' standing finally culminated in death in {559} early\r\nmiddle age from nephritis. After the event, there seemed to be no\r\ndoubt but that the diarrhea, which no ordinary means of treatment had\r\nsucceeded in benefiting more than temporarily, was really due to the\r\neffort of the intestinal mucosa to supplement the defective work of\r\nthe kidneys. In this case apparently one of the strongest evidences\r\nthat the affection was of nervous origin was the fact that whenever\r\nthe patient was away from home, eating rather plentifully of a varied\r\ndiet, his intestinal condition was better than when he was eating much\r\nmore simple and unvaried food at home. The change of scene and\r\nsurroundings proved a tonic to his kidneys and perhaps also to his\r\nskin, thus saving his intestines some of the extra work they had\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neurasthenia and Diabetes_.--Another serious disease that may in its\r\nearlier stages be mistaken for neurasthenia is diabetes. There is no\r\ndoubt that some patients have been passing sugar for a long time\r\nbefore any sure symptom can be noted in their general health, or,\r\nindeed, before there is anything to call attention to the possibility\r\nof glycosuria. In many of these cases, however, there is a feeling of\r\nmuscular tiredness and a sense of inadequacy for occupations which\r\nwere before easy, that may be attributed to neurasthenia. When this\r\nmuscle tiredness changes to crampy feelings that should be enough to\r\nlead to an examination of the urine.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly one of the reasons why neurasthenia is sometimes called\r\nthe American disease and is thought to be more frequent among us than\r\nit is in Europe is this confusion with the beginnings of serious\r\norganic disease because of failure to examine patients carefully in\r\norder to detect underlying organic conditions. In recent years this\r\nneglect has become rarer and the consequence has been a reduction in\r\nthe numbers of so-called neurasthenia cases. Our morbidity statistics\r\nof twenty years ago, for instance, seemed to show that we had only\r\nhalf as much diabetes to the population as they had in Europe. One of\r\nthe reasons for this was undoubtedly the ease with which the diagnosis\r\nof neurasthenia might be made at the beginning of diabetes, and that\r\nthe terminal stages of the affection were often masked by the\r\ndevelopment of the tuberculosis so frequent in diabetic conditions or\r\nof albuminuria with symptoms pointing to Bright's disease. Even at the\r\npresent time it would be quite possible to reduce the number of\r\nneurasthenia cases by more careful attention to diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimulated Neurasthenia Due to Over-attention.--While there is danger\r\nof confusing neurasthenia on the one hand with more serious disease\r\nthere is a distinct liability on the other hand to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of certain minor symptoms by employing the word when it\r\nis only over-attention of mind to certain portions of the body that\r\nconstitutes the disease in its literal sense. If something has\r\nparticularly attracted a patient's attention to some part of his\r\nanatomy and if his attention is concentrated on it and allowed to\r\ndwell long on it, his feelings may be so exaggerated as to tempt him\r\nto think that they are connected with some definite pathological\r\ncondition and he may even translate them into serious portents of\r\norganic disease. If a patient once begins to waste nervous energy on\r\nhimself because of solicitude with regard to these symptoms then it\r\nwill not be long before feelings of tiredness, incapacity for work, at\r\ntimes insomnia and certain disturbances of memory are likely to be\r\nnoted. Then the neurasthenic picture seems to be {560} complete. This\r\nis the process so picturesquely called \"short-circuiting\" by which\r\nnervous energy exhausts itself upon the individual himself instead of\r\nin the accomplishment of external work. Many of the worse cases of\r\nso-called neurasthenia have their origin in this process. It is true\r\nthat this set of events is much more likely to occur among people of\r\nlowered nervous vitality, but under certain conditions it may develop\r\nin those who are otherwise in good health up to the moment when the\r\nattention happened to be particularly called to certain feelings. The\r\nphysician can start these patients off anew after improving their\r\nphysical condition, if he can only bring them to see how much their\r\nconcentration of mind upon themselves is the cause of their symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said, though to some it will doubtless seem an\r\nexaggeration, that we human beings are a regular boiler factory of\r\nsensations which, fortunately for our sanity, mental and physical, we\r\nhave learned to neglect to a great extent. Wherever our clothing\r\ntouches us, wherever the air touches us, wherever shoes or belts\r\nconstrict us, there are definite sensations. These continue, but\r\nattract no attention unless they exceed a certain limit to which we\r\nare accustomed. Habit in this matter is very different in different\r\nindividuals. After men and women have grown used to tight shoes or\r\ntight corsets these no longer produce disturbance. The chance visitor\r\nin a boiler factory or loom room of a cotton mill thinks he could not\r\nlive in such din. But after a time people get so used to the din that\r\nsilence and quiet may even become oppressive to them. City dwellers\r\nfrom the slums, especially children, find the peace of the country\r\ndisturbing when they are first taken for vacations.\r\n\r\nOver-attention to sensations, often scarcely abnormal, is indeed the\r\nreal source of many of the symptoms that can so readily be exaggerated\r\ninto pathological portents when attention is directed to them. Every\r\nportion of our body is connected with the central nervous system.\r\nEvery square inch of surface touched either by clothing or the\r\nmovement of the air producers a sensation at every moment of our\r\nwaking life. Ordinarily we pay no attention at all to these\r\nsensations. We can recognize their presence by turning our attention\r\nfor the moment to any portion of the body and recognizing at once that\r\nthere are sensations coming from it, though the moment before we did\r\nnot notice them. If we think of the point of our big toe on the right\r\nfoot we find, though we were totally unaware of it a moment before,\r\nthat a certain pressure is being exerted in it. If we continue to\r\nthink of it queer feelings develop in it. We may get a sense of\r\nnumbness that proceeds up along the tendons that lead to it. We can\r\nfollow them up to the insertion of the muscles in the shin. If we\r\ndwell on the subject we have curious prickly sensations and numb\r\nfeelings, all of which were there and were neglected a minute before\r\nbut now are acutely felt.\r\n\r\nThis same thing is true of all the manifold sensations that come\r\nstreaming into the brain. We learn almost to enjoy them though we are\r\npaying no attention to them. To be without them would mean very often\r\na fright lest there should be something the matter. Usually we think\r\nof the outside of our body as the main source of sensation. It must\r\nnot be forgotten, however, that our viscera have also certain\r\nsensitive nerves and while these are not as closely distributed as\r\nthose on the surface they are there and their presence is often a\r\nsource of pleasure or at least of satisfaction, but may be the source\r\n{561} of poignant discomfort. We are constantly disregarding ordinary\r\nmessages from these, too. Something may easily call our attention to\r\nthese sensations, however, and then we may translate them into\r\npathological terms though they are really only physiological.\r\nOrdinarily man may put a couple of pounds of food and drink into his\r\nstomach and not feel it at all. If anything particularly calls\r\nattention to our stomachs, however, and we dwell on it, then this\r\nweighty feeling may seem to indicate serious indigestion because of\r\nthe discomfort that is produced. This is what nervously weak persons,\r\nthe so-called neurasthenics, are constantly doing. It is this habit\r\nthat by suggestion and training they must be taught to break.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to the substitution of one neurotic symptom for\r\nanother whenever by psychotherapy and mental discipline one condition\r\nis overcome. Often the substitution is of something just as bad or\r\neven worse. I have known cases where people when properly persuaded\r\ngave over paying too much attention to their stomachs and then\r\nproceeded to pay too much attention to their sleep with the result\r\nthat insomnia developed. On the other hand, I have known patients to\r\nget over insomnia and then develop a series of complaints of queer\r\nfeelings in their head which they usually spoke of as headache, though\r\nwhen asked to describe them carefully they confessed that they were at\r\nmost a sense of pressure or of unusual feeling in some part of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThese curious substitutions take place particularly if for any reason\r\nspecial attention is called to another part of the body, either by\r\naccident or by some therapeutic manipulation or remedial measure. I\r\nhave known a patient who complained of headache and was advised to\r\ntake up exercise in the open air, do much stooping and lifting while\r\ncleaning snow from the sidewalk, develop a tired condition in the\r\nlumbar muscles and straightway this was thought to be rheumatic.\r\nLiniment was employed and the counter-irritation which developed\r\nattracted the patient's attention to that portion of the body for a\r\nweek. The headache was no longer complained of, but lumbago was\r\nconsidered to have developed. I have known a person who suffered from\r\nheadache develop what seemed to be a retention of urine for which\r\nunfortunately the doctor thought it necessary to use a catheter and\r\nafter this there was no complaint of the headache, but the patient\r\nbecame almost unable to hold any amount of urine in her bladder and\r\ncould not go out for social or other duties because of the fear of\r\nimperative urination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHOREA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis twitching affection, so familiar that it need not be described\r\nparticularly, is sometimes classed as a pure neurosis, sometimes as a\r\nnervous disease with perhaps some organic basis and sometimes is\r\nplaced among the ailments related to rheumatism and attributed to some\r\npathological condition of the circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--Two elements must be considered in the problem of the\r\netiology {562} of the disease--the predisposition and the direct\r\noccasion. The affection occurs particularly in nervous children who\r\nare made to occupy their intellects too much while their muscular\r\nsystems are kept quiet for long hours. Often a preceding running down\r\nin weight is noticed, though sometimes the child only fails to\r\nincrease in weight as it should in proportion to its growth. It occurs\r\nquite frequently among chlorotic girls just before or about the time\r\nof puberty. Anemia generally seems to predispose to it, but the\r\naffection may occur among children who seem to be in excellent\r\nphysical health, though usually a distinct nervous heredity is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Immediate Causation_.--Fright is one of the most frequent immediate\r\ncauses or occasions of the development of chorea. Mental worry of any\r\nkind may have the same effect. Scolding has produced it; a sudden\r\ngrief has seemed to be the occasion; a slight injury, and still more,\r\na severe injury, or a surgical operation, even a slight one, may be\r\nthe forerunner of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathology.--No definite lesions have been found to which the disease\r\ncan be attributed, though a careful search has been made for them.\r\nEndocarditis is an extremely common accompaniment. It is probably\r\npresent in three-fourths of the cases that have come to autopsy. Osler\r\nfound it in sixty-two out of seventy-three cases in the literature.\r\nThe association of the affection with rheumatism is insisted on by the\r\nFrench and English particularly, and certainly in a considerable\r\nnumber of cases there is a history of preceding or coincident\r\nrheumatism, that is, an acute rheumatic arthritis. Often these attacks\r\nare concealed under such names as \"growing pains\" or \"colds in the\r\njoints\" but it is not hard to elicit a history of a red and swollen\r\njoint with some fever. In children mild cases may occur of genuine\r\nacute rheumatism with the involvement of but a single joint and that\r\nnot severely. These mild forms are often found in the history of cases\r\nof chorea.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the heart affection is often responsible for the\r\nsymptoms and it is probably through the endocarditis that whatever\r\nconnection there is between chorea and rheumatism exists.\r\n\r\nAll the elements in the disease point to the influence of the mind\r\nover it. The predisposition is caused by over-use of the mind at a\r\ntime when many claims are being made on the nervous system because of\r\nthe growth of muscles. There must, as a rule, be a pathological basis,\r\nnatural or acquired, that is, something that tends to produce a defect\r\nin the circulation, but even without this certain children suffer from\r\nthe affection. If the patient is an object of solicitude or of\r\ncuriosity at home or at school, the symptoms rapidly become worse. At\r\nany time the consciousness of observation makes them worse. The\r\nsymptoms do not occur during sleep, or at times when the patient's\r\nmind is much occupied with some absorbing interest. They lessen just\r\nto the degree that the patient's own attention is not called to them\r\nor the consciousness not allowed to be concentrated on them. Chorea\r\noften occurs in bright, intelligent children and always seems worse in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The story of the therapeutics of chorea in recent years\r\nstrongly confirms the idea of the place of mental influence in the\r\ncure of the disease. We have had a whole series of remedies,\r\nintroduced with a promise of cure by distinguished authorities, used\r\nfor a time with apparent success by many physicians, and then\r\ngradually falling into innocuous desuetude. It was recognized that any\r\nremedy would have to be used over a rather {563} prolonged period, at\r\nleast from five to ten weeks. It was appreciated, also, that the\r\npatient must be kept quiet, both in mind and body, emotional\r\ndisturbances especially being avoided, that all physical functions\r\nhave to be set right and that the nutrition particularly must be\r\ncorrected if in anything it is abnormal. Where all this is done\r\npatients recover without any remedy quite as promptly in most cases as\r\nwith any of the supposed specifics. Expectant treatment, supplemented\r\nby symptomatic treatment, has proved in many institutions to give\r\nexcellent results without the necessity of troubling the patients with\r\nmore or less dubious drugs. It was important that the patient should\r\nbe given certain medicine and impressed with the idea that this\r\nmedicine was expected to do them good, a suggestion automatically\r\nemphasized at every dose, but it is probable that few men of\r\nconsiderable clinical experience now hold the notion that we have any\r\ngenuinely curative remedy for chorea, though we have certain tonic,\r\nalterative remedies which, in conjunction with the setting of the mind\r\nat rest, help to put the patient in a condition where the affection is\r\ngradually overcome.\r\n\r\nThe most important object in the treatment of chorea must be its\r\nprevention or its early recognition, and its immediate treatment; then\r\nthere is little likelihood of relapses and, above all, the condition\r\ndoes not last long. Children who have had an attack of acute articular\r\nrheumatism or who have suffered from growing pains or any other of the\r\nrheumatic simulants of childhood should be watched carefully during\r\ntheir growing period and at certain critical times in early life. They\r\nshould be especially regarded immediately after being sent to school.\r\nThe first sign of involuntary twitchings should be taken to mean that\r\nthe children are overborne and a period of rest from anxiety and study\r\nand over-exercise should be afforded them. Of course, all this\r\nwatchful care must be exercised without attracting the little\r\npatient's attention, or the very purpose of the care will be defeated\r\nand the mind disturbed.\r\n\r\nRest does not mean that patients should be kept absolutely in bed even\r\nafter chorea has frankly developed, but that there should be hygienic\r\nrest. Long hours of sleep, interesting occupations without much\r\nexercise, a period of lying down in the afternoon, but, above all,\r\nsuch occupation of mind with simple pleasant things as keeps their\r\nattention from themselves. Visitors should not be allowed to see them;\r\nabove all, they should not be conscious objects of over-solicitous\r\ncare on the part of father and mother or the relief of symptoms will\r\nbe delayed and the condition will be made worse. As a rule, children\r\ndo not worry about themselves nor their physical ailments, but they\r\ncan be made to do so by seeing the over-anxiety of others. A good\r\nnurse of sympathetic nature with power to interest the child, is\r\nbetter than its mother for a constant companion, though family life,\r\nthe playing with brothers and sisters and the regular routine of home\r\nis the best possible mental solace and occupation. Grandmothers are\r\nuseful adjuvants in the treatment late in the affection. At the\r\nbeginning their over-solicitude nearly always does harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHabit Following Chorea.--In certain nervous children after the chorea\r\nitself has subsided there remains a habit of twitching that often is\r\nalmost more intractable than the chorea itself. This is particularly\r\nlikely to be manifest in children who have an unfortunate nervous\r\nheredity or in those whose {564} nervous systems have been impaired by\r\npreceding infections disease as anterior polio-myelitis, syphilis or\r\none of the forms of meningitis. Occasionally it is seen in children\r\nwithout nervous heredity, but they are usually children surrounded by\r\nsolicitous relatives, made the centre of pathological interest and\r\nconstantly fussed about. The habit is not surprising and would remind\r\nthe observant physician of the whoop that by habit sometimes clings to\r\nchildren in any cough that they may have for months after they have\r\nhad whooping cough. Often it will be found that these children are\r\ncapricious eaters, that they take tea and coffee, that their diet\r\ninstead of being the simple nutritious food that they should have\r\nconsists of many things that their mothers obtain to tempt their\r\nappetites and that the children can really have anything they crave\r\nfor and get it much oftener than is good for them. To continue any\r\nform of presumedly specific treatment in these cases does no good. If\r\narsenic is used over long periods, or any of the salicylates because\r\nof the supposed connection of chorea and an underlying rheumatic\r\ndiathesis they will certainly do harm. The patients' diet can be\r\nregulated, nerve stimulants of all kinds must be denied them, and\r\ntheir appetites must be brought into order by the proper care of a\r\nnurse who will not yield too readily to their caprices, and then the\r\nsolicitous environment must be changed. These cases represent a good\r\nmany of the so-called prolonged choreas and are really habits or tics\r\ndue to concentration of mind and a certain hysterical tendency to\r\ncontinue to attract attention which may be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout any good reason in the etymology or the history of the word,\r\nthe term \"tics\" has now been generally accepted to signify certain\r\ninvoluntary movements, frequently recurrent, of which, by habit,\r\ncertain persons usually of diminished nervous control, become the\r\nvictims. For the psychotherapeutist, however, they have an interest\r\nquite beyond that which they have for the ordinary student of nervous\r\ndiseases. They represent the possibility of the formation of habits in\r\nthe nervous system, originally quite under the control of the will,\r\nbut which eventually become tyrannously powerful and quite beyond\r\nmanagement by the individual. They deserve to be studied with\r\nparticular care because it is probable that they represent objectively\r\nwhat occurs also on the sensory side of the system, but which not\r\nbeing manifest externally, is spoken of as entirely subjective. If\r\nnerve explosions of motor character can, through habit, get beyond the\r\ncontrol of the patient, it is not unlikely that sensations, primarily\r\nof little significance, may, in persons of low nervous control, become\r\nby habit so likely to be repeated as to make the patient miserable.\r\nHence the study of tics as here presented.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the studies of Gilles de la Tourette, we realize that\r\nthere is an essential distinction between involuntary movements of\r\nvarious kinds, and that spasms and tics must be separated from one\r\nanother. Tics consist of various movements of the voluntary muscles.\r\nProbably the most familiar {565} is that of winking. Everybody winks\r\nboth eyes a number of times a minute quite unconsciously, though the\r\nunconscious movement accomplishes the definite and necessary purpose\r\nof keeping the conjunctiva free from irritant particles. When this\r\nsame movement is done more frequently than is necessary, or is limited\r\nmore to one eye than to the other, or is repeated exaggeratedly in\r\nboth eyes, then it is a tic. There are many other facial tics. Most of\r\nthem represent movements of the lips or of the nose or of the skin of\r\nthe forehead and all of them are identical with movements that are\r\noccasionally performed quite voluntarily. There are movements of the\r\nlips as in sucking, or smacking sounds may be made, or such movements\r\nof the features as are associated with sensations of taste or smell.\r\nSometimes changes of facial expression may be tics and without any\r\nreason there may be recurring expressions of emotion, of joy, or\r\ngrief, or fright, or even pain. Sometimes the tics affect structures\r\nthat are internal, as various motions of the larynx accompanied by the\r\nproduction of grunting or sighing sounds or sometimes even of\r\nparticular words. In children the tendency is prone to manifest itself\r\nin the utterance of forbidden words, usually vulgar, sometimes\r\nindecent.\r\n\r\nBesides these facial and throat tics any of the voluntary muscles of\r\nthe body may be affected. There may be the gestures that accompany\r\ncertain mental states, or there may be twisting or turning movements\r\nas if the patient were in an awkward position and wanted to get out of\r\nit, or as if the clothes were hampering movement and there was an\r\neffort to relieve some discomfort. The head may be lifted and lowered,\r\nor may be twisted from one side to the other and, indeed, various\r\nnodding tics are extremely common. Almost any ordinary movement may,\r\nin nervous people, come to be repeated so frequently as to be a tic.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the convulsive or quasi-convulsive movements\r\nassociated with respiration are likely to become the subject of tics.\r\nYawning, for instance, involuntary to some degree, usually a reflex\r\nwith a physical cause, but so readily the subject of imitation, may\r\nbecome so frequent as to be repeated a couple of times a minute and\r\nthis repetition kept up for many days. Sneezing may also become a tic,\r\nthough it is usually a definite reflex due to palpable physical\r\ncauses. Hiccoughs may easily become the subject of a tic. The\r\noccurrence of a persistent hiccough is in popular medicine a sign of\r\nunfavorable prognosis in serious diseases, especially such as involve\r\nthe abdominal region. In connection with neurotic affections of the\r\nabdomen, however, hiccoughs are not uncommon and are of no serious\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties of Tics.--There are many more tics than are ordinarily\r\nsupposed. Indeed, there are few of us who escape them entirely. Nearly\r\nall the curious phrases that people interlard so frequently into their\r\nconversation, usually quite unconscious of them, or of the ridiculous\r\nsignificance they often have, must be placed under the tics. Some men\r\ncannot say a dozen words without interpolating \"don't you know.\"\r\nOthers use some such expression as \"in that way.\" I once knew a\r\ndistinguished professor of elocution who by actual count used this\r\nphrase forty times in an hour. Some say \"hum\" or \"hem\" every sentence\r\nor so. Whenever there is a bit of obscurity in their thought these\r\nvoluntary but unconscious expressions are sure to pop out. No one who\r\nhas had much experience in public speaking ever succeeds in keeping\r\nentirely out of such bad habits. It is curious how phrases will insist\r\non repeating {566} themselves. One year one set of words, or a pet\r\nphrase, or mode of expression, creeps unconsciously here and there\r\ninto an address. Then either because the speaker has been reading\r\ndictated copy, or because some good friend has the courage to tell him\r\nof it, he finds out the bad habit and suppresses it.\r\n\r\nWord formulas senselessly repeated are only one of many forms of tics\r\nthat public speakers are prone to indulge in. Gesture which begins as\r\nan artificial adornment of speech, very appropriate in itself, after a\r\nwhile may settle down into certain forms that not only often lack\r\nelegance but that are really disturbing to an audience. Of these\r\ngestures and movements men are often quite unconscious. They have\r\nbecome habitual and in the absorption of mind with the thought and the\r\nwords, they are reproduced quite involuntarily though they are all\r\noriginally voluntary movements. Nearly every public speaker needs a\r\nmentor to correct him of such faults. It is rather difficult to break\r\nsome of these habits and it requires no little concentration of effort\r\nand attention to be successful in eradicating them. It can be done,\r\nhowever, provided the habit is not too inveterate, and this is the\r\nbest evidence that tics of other kinds can also be eradicated if the\r\npatient really takes the matter in hand and is not of a weakened will.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teachers' Habits_.--Indeed it is almost impossible for public\r\nspeakers and teachers not to acquire certain habits irritating to\r\ntheir auditors at first but amusing as they grow used to them, and\r\nstudents particularly learn to look kindly at the ridiculous side of\r\nmany of them. I remember an old professor of literature who used to\r\nlecture at some length on each of the important contributors to\r\nEnglish prose and poetry. We soon observed that whenever he came to\r\ntheir deaths he took out his handkerchief and blew his nose. This was\r\nas inevitable and as invariable a rule as the laws of the Medes and\r\nthe Persians. It was, as it were, his tribute of sympathetic\r\ncondolence with humanity for the loss of a brilliant contributor to\r\nEnglish literature.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the effort to break up these habits will seriously\r\ninterfere with modes of thought and habits of expression, for the time\r\nbeing at least. A professor at a certain university had a habit every\r\nnow and then of plucking at a button on his coat. His students could\r\ntell when his hand was going to find this object of its occupation and\r\nknew from experience that he would twist it a certain number of times.\r\nHe was not what would ordinarily be called a nervous person. One day\r\nhe happened to take off his coat shortly before a lecture and one of\r\nthe students surreptitiously removed the button. At the end of the\r\nfirst few minutes of his lecture his hand went up to find the button\r\nas usual but failed. For the moment there was a hesitancy in his\r\nspeech; then he tried again. A little later his hand went up\r\nunconsciously and was disappointed; then he stammered and lost the\r\nthread of his discourse. The last half hour of that lecture was\r\nseriously impaired because of the absence of that button.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricks of Speech_.--There are many other curious tricks of speech\r\nthat are really tics. Women often indulge in them and sometimes even\r\npretty women spoil their appearance by bad habits. All of us know the\r\npretty woman who talks very fast, but who every now and then projects\r\nher tongue a little beyond her teeth. Occasionally there is a tendency\r\nto wrinkle the nose or the forehead. Most of us have seen the woman\r\nwho sets her face into a definite smile of a particular kind whenever\r\nher company manners are in {567} use, though there is a vacancy behind\r\nthe smile that is rather disturbing. Some people have habitual\r\nmovements of the fingers that are really tics, and even positions\r\nassumed on sitting down that are very ungraceful, or that are very\r\nnoticeable, sometimes partake of this character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fussiness_.--A very common form of tic that is quite difficult to\r\ncontrol is that tendency to be doing something with some of their\r\nmuscles which characterizes many men. They must handle a pencil or a\r\nknife, or they must swing on their chair or tilt back on it, or keep\r\none of their limbs swinging over the other, or twirl their moustaches\r\nor stroke their beards, or rumple their hair, and they cannot find it\r\nquite possible to sit still. The difference between men and women in\r\nthis regard is remarkable. Women are conceded to be much more nervous\r\nthan men, but men are ever so much more fidgety than women. The author\r\nof \"The Life of a Prig\" in his book \"The Platitudes of a Pessimist\"\r\nhas some striking paragraphs with regard to this subject. He says:\r\n\r\n  To look nearer home, the British bar affords splendid examples of\r\n  nervous fidget. Observe barristers pleading a cause. How they\r\n  torture a piece of red-tape, how they twirl their eye-glasses or\r\n  spectacles, and how they hitch at their garments, as if they\r\n  momentarily expected them to desert their finely proportioned\r\n  figures. But worse than the Queen's Counsellors, and even worse than\r\n  the domestic peripatetic, is the villain who is abandoned to a\r\n  performance vulgarly known as \"the devil's tattoo\"--drumming with\r\n  the fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Writers' Tics_.--Writers, and above all writers for the daily press\r\nand such as have to do their writing in a rush and therefore get\r\nnervous and anxious about it, are especially prone to develop tics,\r\nthough others who write leisurely may do so. Some of these are curious\r\nand others are only expressions of nervousness common to all people.\r\nMany of them chew their nails, some of them bite at their fingers\r\nround the nails and make them sore, many of them chew the ends of\r\ntheir pens and find it practically impossible to keep a pen with a\r\nlong handle to it. Some of them run their hands through their hair\r\nuntil it is in a greatly rumpled condition, some of them pluck at\r\ntheir eyebrows. I have one patient who when he is going through a\r\nparticular nervous strain plucks out the middle portion of his right\r\neyebrow so that he has a distinct bald spot at this point.\r\n\r\nThe tradition in newspaper offices is that these curious expressions\r\nof the tendency of the body to occupy itself with something while the\r\nmind is occupied are more or less inevitable in nervous people. They\r\ncontinue for many, many years. They are only habits, however, that it\r\nwould have been rather easy to break in the beginning, though they\r\nbecome extremely difficult to modify after they have once secured a\r\nfirm hold. Occasionally I have fastened a piece of adhesive plaster\r\nover a much battered eyebrow, but that made it difficult for the man\r\nto go on with his work. His hand would go up involuntarily time after\r\ntime and while plucking at his eyebrow would not disturb in the\r\nslightest his train of thought, just as soon as his fingers touched\r\nthe unusual object a serious distraction occurred and work was not\r\nonly slower, but much more difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Games_.--The tendency to the formation of curious habits of\r\nassociated movements can be seen very well in most games where skill\r\nis combined {568} to a certain degree with chance. It is most\r\nnoticeable, perhaps, in bowling. Few men are able to restrain\r\nthemselves from making some special movement just as the ball strikes\r\nthe pin. This is sometimes a motion of the head, oftener it is a jerk\r\nof the trunk, sometimes it is an associated movement of the arms,\r\noccasionally it is a kick or a stamp. In billiards the same movements\r\nare noticeable if a man is much interested in making a difficult shot.\r\nUsually there is some movement of the body or of the hands or of the\r\nhead that would indicate his desire to move the ball in a particular\r\ndirection. Women who play these games do not usually have these\r\nassociated movements to such a marked degree and this may be due\r\neither to their better restraint to movement in general, for as we\r\nhave said men do not acquire the habit of self-restraint in small\r\nmatters of deportment as women do, or to the fact that such associated\r\nmovements might disarrange their clothes. Perhaps, also, they are not\r\nas much interested in the games as a rule as are the men. Of course,\r\nsimilar associated movements may be seen in outdoor sports that\r\nrequire skill yet have an element of chance in them. For it is, as it\r\nwere, to overcome this that the additional movement is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Children's Tics_.--Some tics consist of some very curious habits.\r\nOccasionally children hear some obscene or vulgar expression and\r\nrepeat it. The repetition of it produces such a look of shock to\r\npropriety on the part of some of the other little ones who happen to\r\nbe present that they repeat it in the spirit of bravado and then\r\ncontinue to utter it until it becomes a habit that is hard for them to\r\nbreak. After all, the use of blasphemy later on in life is really a\r\ntic, a habit of uttering words no longer expressive of any particular\r\nfeeling, as a rule, unless in exceptional circumstances but just the\r\nresult of a tendency for the speech organs to repeat certain words.\r\nThey tell a good story of the Rev. Sydney Smith who, wishing to break\r\nan acquaintance of the habit of indulging in expletives, interlarded\r\nhis speech with \"fire tongs and sugar tongs\" every ten words or so and\r\nwhen his auditor protested that that added nothing to the significance\r\nof what he said the Rev. Sidney suggested that that was also true of\r\nvarious blasphemous expressions that his acquaintance was accustomed\r\nto use.\r\n\r\nAt the Salpetriere they tell the story of a little boy who had the\r\nhabit of saying the French word which the corporal in Victor Hugo's\r\n\"Les Miserables\" made use of when anyone told him that it was because\r\nWellington was a greater general than Napoleon that the French Emperor\r\nwas defeated at Waterloo. Nothing seemed to be able to break the boy\r\nof the habit of interjecting this word into conversations sometimes in\r\nwhich he had no part and sometimes toward which he was expected to\r\ntake only a respectful and childlike attitude of silence. He was sent\r\nto the Salpetriere. The ordinary remedies had failed entirely. One day\r\nhe was allowed to go outside of the hospital, or rather stole out of\r\nthe gate and played marbles with some street gamins in front of it.\r\nDuring the game he used the word in question and they proceeded to\r\ngive him a good thrashing. It is Charcot who tells that this broke him\r\neffectually of the habit.\r\n\r\nOne of the childish customs that sometimes disturbs parents very much\r\nbecause it seems to be such an unaccountable lapse into barbarism,\r\nthough it is really nothing more than a tic in the strict sense of the\r\nword, is the habit that some children acquire of removing portions of\r\nhardened material {569} from their nose and then putting it into their\r\nmonth. Refined parents are apt to be so seriously disturbed by this\r\nthat they fear for the child's mentality. Really the habit is not\r\nnearly so rare as is usually thought by some grown-ups who have\r\nforgotten about their own and others' childhood. In country places the\r\nhabit is very common. It is not alone the dull children who do it but\r\nsome very bright ones. Indeed, the tendency to the habit is so common\r\nthat one wonders whether there is not something in nature that tempts\r\nto it. Parents who are fearful lest their children may be seriously\r\nhurt in health by the awfully insanitary habit may be reassured that\r\nafter all a certain amount of the drainage of the nose is normally\r\ncarried off through the posterior nares to the stomach and that no\r\ndanger to health seems ever to have resulted from the practice. As a\r\nrule, the habit can be broken rather easily by a little judicious care\r\nand insistence, though I know of cases where relapses occurred and the\r\nhabit continued surreptitiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Motor Tics_.--Motor tics frequently develop as a consequence of some\r\ninjury to a nerve or some intense overuse of it. Winking habits follow\r\nan herpetic involvement of the superior branch of the fifth nerve.\r\nBell's palsy is sometimes followed in the face by a tendency to\r\ntwitching on the unaffected side that makes the patient quite\r\nuncomfortable. Herpes zoster is sometimes followed by a catching of\r\nthe breath, probably due to a little spasm in the muscles supplied by\r\nthe nerve thus affected. Some of the yawning tics have this origin.\r\nAny neuritis may in the course of its betterment be followed by this\r\ncurious tendency to explosion along the nerve that has been affected,\r\nas if the pathological process had more seriously interfered with\r\ninhibition than with the actual function of the nerve. Examples of\r\nover-exertion followed by twitchings are not rare. A scrubwoman who\r\nhas seen better days and now has to carry a heavy bucket and use her\r\nright hand much with the brush may develop a twitching of the right\r\narm. A janitor's wife who sweeps much may have a tendency to\r\ntwitchings of the fingers as a consequence of the unusual exertion of\r\nholding the broom. Twitchings in the limbs of men who work at a foot\r\nlathe or other machine requiring foot power are not unusual though\r\nthey are more often seen in the leg on which the workman habitually\r\nstands than in the other one and it seems to be oftener a strain on\r\nmuscles than actual over-exercise that precedes the development of\r\nthese tics.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity.--Heredity plays as large a role in tics as it does in\r\nstuttering and other functional nervous disturbances. Occasionally the\r\ndirect inheritance of some habit will be found, though there is nearly\r\nalways more than a suspicion that a trick of speech or of act, which\r\nconstitutes the tic, was learned by imitation rather than transferred\r\ndirectly. Besides, it is a case of a similarly constituted nervous\r\nsystem reacting in the same way to a similar environment, rather than\r\nany definite tendency existing by heredity in the nervous system. It\r\nis surprising what close observers children are and how easily they\r\nlearn to imitate any habitual action of father or mother or, for that\r\nmatter, of nurses or those who are close to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Treatment.--The most important element in the psychotherapy of\r\ntics is their prophylaxis. They run in families, not by any inevitable\r\nhereditary influence, but as a consequence partly of imitation and of\r\ncorresponding tendencies resulting from certain weaknesses in the\r\nfamily. Wherever they are known to be likely to occur, parents should\r\nbe warned of the {570} possibility and the first symptom of any motor\r\nhabit should be considered the beginning of a tic. As we have said,\r\nthey are likely to begin in muscles that have been overstrained for\r\nany reason, especially when patients are run down. They are often seen\r\nafter herpes and certain facial neuralgias.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no tic, no matter how long or how serious, that can\r\nnot be eradicated, or greatly modified, if the patient will take the\r\ntrouble and if the treatment is conducted so as gradually to get rid\r\nof it. Peculiar movements cannot be done away with at once. They can\r\nbe lessened in intensity and in frequency and then gradually the\r\npatient will be encouraged by their becoming less noticeable than\r\nbefore to make renewed efforts. The habit must be gradually undone and\r\nthis will take as long as it did to form it originally. The exercise\r\nof contrary muscular movements carefully carried out, and of gentle\r\nrepression with definite times of exercise during the day, gradually\r\nincreasing the length of the intervals of repression, in the end\r\nproves successful. Only a determined struggle will effect a cure. It\r\ndepends on the patient's will. Like a drug addiction, or a tendency to\r\novereat, or a craving for alcohol, it must be gradually overcome and\r\nthen care must be exercised to prevent relapses; for when the\r\ncondition is somewhat better, to relax vigilance and give up effort\r\nwill allow the old condition to reassert itself with startling\r\nrapidity. People suffering from severe tics will often give up.\r\nWithout the patient's hearty co-operation cure is impossible. With\r\ngood will its gradual diminution gives the patient a confidence in\r\nself and an uplift in character that is extremely valuable, not only\r\nfor physical but for mental conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSTUTTERING, ATAXIA IN TALKING, WALKING, WRITING, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of speech called stuttering has usually been considered\r\nrather as an unfortunate lack of control over the organs of\r\narticulation, somewhat corresponding to muscular awkwardness of any\r\nother kind, than as a pathological condition deserving the physician's\r\nattention. If anything was done for it formally, the first effort of\r\nthe parents or the teacher was to correct the supposed bad habits and\r\nthis failing the affection was relegated to someone who claimed to\r\nproduce wonderful results by some special method. Perhaps, even\r\noftener, stuttering was considered one of those affections,\r\nfortunately decreasing in number, that the child may be expected to\r\noutgrow. Often there was noted an hereditary element which was\r\nsupposed to indicate incurability.\r\n\r\nStuttering deserves special treatment in a work on psychotherapy\r\nbecause it illustrates very strikingly one phase at least of mental\r\ninfluence over bodily function. While in the study of the etiology of\r\nthe disease much has been made of anatomical features, nerves and\r\nmuscles and anatomical anomalies of the speech organs and the\r\nrespiratory tract, the sufferers from stuttering are certainly quite\r\nup to the average both in the physiology and anatomy of these regions.\r\nThey are of all ranks and conditions of life, of all sizes and build,\r\nand it is evident that the trouble is not physical, but mental. They\r\n{571} pay too much attention to their speech and to the co-ordination\r\nof the many muscles engaged in speech production and the consequence\r\nis that they impair their power to use these organs. Practically all\r\nthe cures recommended contain some element which distracts the\r\nattention from the speech to something else and so permits the\r\nfunction of the speech organs to proceed undisturbed.\r\n\r\nA number of conditions develop in nervous individuals that resemble\r\nstuttering. There are disturbances of swallowing, disturbances of\r\nwalking (astasia abasia), neurotic disturbances of writing, and of\r\nother uses of the hands and of the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\nState of Mind.--It is perfectly clear to anyone who has closely\r\nobserved the ways of stutterers that the state of mind is extremely\r\nimportant in these cases and indeed probably constitutes the\r\nunderlying factor in the speech disturbance. Stuttering and all speech\r\ndefects are much worse when the patient is laboring under excitement.\r\nThis is so amusingly true that the impotence of a stutterer to say a\r\nword when he wants very much to say it is a commonplace in the cheap\r\ndrama and never fails to raise a laugh. In ordinary conversation with\r\nfriends the stutterer may have little difficulty. As soon, however, as\r\nhe begins to talk with those with whom he is unfamiliar his speech\r\ndefect becomes noticeable. When the others present are entire\r\nstrangers and, above all, strangers whom he wishes to impress\r\nfavorably, then his stuttering becomes pronounced. The mental element\r\nis the most important factor. Just as soon as consciousness of the\r\ntask supervenes his power of co-ordination fails and stuttering\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n\r\nStuttering in Complex Activities.--There are many actions that become\r\nhabitual and people are thus saved from the necessity of constantly\r\nperforming them under the control of the will and the consciousness.\r\nWalking is a typical illustration of this and is seldom disturbed by\r\nconsciousness, but there may be a stuttering in the gait of sensitive\r\npersons if they become overconscious when passing people who are\r\nwatching them. Talking is even a more striking example of elaborate\r\nco-ordination without conscious effort. We have to bring into play\r\nmore than a score of muscles whose movements are nicely and accurately\r\nco-ordinated, or else the effort at articulate speech is a failure. We\r\nhave to change the positions of most of these muscles many times every\r\nminute, yet we do it without a thought of how it is done and most of\r\nus accomplish it with ease and perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stuttering Walk_.--Stuttering, after all, comes most naturally under\r\nthe head of dreads in the classification of the psychoses. Stuttering\r\nis not a physical difficulty so much as a nervous apprehension, and\r\nthere may be a stuttering in any co-ordination as in speech. I have a\r\npatient under observation who, if people are looking at her, finds so\r\nmuch difficulty in walking because of a trembling that comes over her\r\nthat she fears she may not be able to keep from falling. Boys at\r\nschool whistle a certain air that requires a little halt in the gait\r\nto keep time with it, as their schoolgirl friends go by, and it is\r\nimpossible for these not to drop into the peculiar gait indicated by\r\nthe time of the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stuttering Writing_.--There are many men who become so nervous about\r\nwriting their signatures that they cannot sign while anyone is\r\npresent. There are others whose penmanship becomes very irregular, or\r\nat least exhibits many signs of nervousness, whenever they think\r\nsomeone is watching them. Most of {572} the difficulties seen in\r\nspeech may, indeed, be exhibited in writing. The same difficulty in\r\nbeginning, the same elision of letters under stress of excitement, may\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nWriter's cramp is, after all, much more of the nature of a stuttering\r\nin writing than a real cramp. Over-action, added motions, and,\r\nfinally, incomplete power to act as desired are seen in both cases. It\r\nmight be expected that this would not affect so simple and familiar a\r\nset of motions as those required for a personal signature, but it\r\ndoes, as many cases illustrate. A typical example was the treasurer of\r\na large trust company who had to sign a number of bonds, some thirty\r\nthousand. At the rate of 200 an hour, over three a minute, as he did\r\nthe first day with others making it easy for him, it looked as though\r\nhe could complete the task, huge as it was, in a month. At the end of\r\na week, however, the rate had fallen to 120 an hour and, toward the\r\nend of the second week, one a minute on the average was all that could\r\nbe accomplished. At the end of the month his signature, while\r\nretaining certain of its original characteristics, had become very\r\ndifferent from what it was at the beginning and signing had become an\r\nextremely difficult matter. He had to take a rest from business for\r\nseveral weeks after accomplishing this apparently mechanical\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional Ataxia.--Dr. S. Weir Mitchell in his article on \"Motor\r\nAtaxia from Emotion\" in the May number (1910) of _The Journal of\r\nNervous and Mental Disease_, discusses some cases in which inability\r\nto write even a signature came as a consequence of nervousness and\r\nemotional disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn one of Dr. Mitchell's patients, other manifestations of ataxia\r\noccurred as the result of the consciousness that people were watching\r\nthe patient. At times he is compelled to leave a dinner table, since\r\nwith strangers it is almost impossible for him to eat. If there are\r\ntwo or three at the table with him, however, and especially if he is\r\nworried about himself, he may become almost helpless, requiring both\r\nhands to get a cup of coffee or a glass of water to his mouth. A\r\npatient of mine with like symptoms has described to me equivalents of\r\nvarious kinds to his own difficulties in his sisters. One of them\r\ncannot play the piano before strangers, though an excellent musician.\r\nThe other cannot crochet with any success if any but intimate friends\r\nare present. How much of this family trait is due to suggestion or\r\npsychic contagion would be hard to say. The state that comes over\r\namateur actors and which makes them forget their lines, stammer in\r\ntheir speech, walk awkwardly, and trip easily, are really\r\nmanifestations of this same incapacity to control even familiar sets\r\nof actions when there is great self-consciousness and over-attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence.--The correction of these conditions comes through\r\nsoothing the mind of the patient and getting him or her not to be so\r\nself-conscious as to disturb action by thought about it. It is easy to\r\nsay this and extremely difficult to do it. In certain nervous\r\norganizations it is quite impossible to overcome the tendency to this\r\nataxia or inco-ordination of voluntary movements. Much can be\r\naccomplished, however, by proper training and discipline in all cases,\r\nand, while the patient can never be completely cured, great\r\nimprovement may be brought about by patient habituation under\r\nfavorable circumstances. In Dr. Mitchell's cases the taking of a glass\r\nof whiskey or of wine sometimes stimulated the patient so that\r\nco-ordination became possible where it was impossible before. In\r\nnearly all cases of writer's cramp {573} and writing difficulties the\r\npower to write is restored for a time by such stimulation. Strong\r\ncoffee will sometimes serve the purpose as well as alcohol. It is easy\r\nto understand, however, how dangerous is the resort to such\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Practice in Self-Control_.--The excitement and nervousness incident\r\nto appearance before an audience which make thought and speech so\r\ndifficult and action so awkward and so exaggerated gradually disappear\r\nas the individual becomes habituated to appearing in public. In most\r\npeople there is never a complete loss of self-consciousness with\r\nentire freedom from nervousness, but the conditions are much improved\r\nso that there is no noticeable interference with ordinary actions and\r\nspeech. Whenever there is some reason for additional excitement,\r\nhowever, as when a new play is being put on, or when some special\r\naudience is being entertained, there is a reappearance of many of the\r\nold symptoms due to a self-consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nStuttering in the Young.--The prognosis of stuttering when it develops\r\nat a certain period is much better than at others. The stuttering of\r\nthe very young can usually be overcome by a little careful training,\r\nif it is taken early and treated patiently by a competent teacher. Not\r\ninfrequently a certain amount of stuttering develops at puberty when\r\nthe voice changes, partly due to the inability of muscles and nerves\r\nto co-ordinate so easily as before upon the rapidly-enlarging vocal\r\nchords and larynx, and partly to that greatly increased\r\nself-consciousness amounting almost to painful bashfulness which\r\ndevelops in boys about this time. Breathing exercises and especially\r\nslow expiration is an excellent thing in these cases and distracts\r\ntheir attention from themselves and their speech.\r\n\r\nThe chest has usually developed rather rapidly at this time and the\r\nmuscles have to some extent lost control over it, and it will be found\r\non careful observation that the breathing is particularly superficial,\r\nthat the descent of the diaphragm is quite limited and that the use of\r\nthis important muscle of respiration requires practice in order that\r\nit may be controlled properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Women.--Perhaps the most interesting thing about stuttering is that\r\nit is ever so much rarer in women than it is in men. Something less\r\nthan one-fourth as many women suffer from it as men and this is true\r\nfor all periods of life. Women are usually more bashful and\r\nself-conscious than men, but this rarely goes to the extent of\r\ndisturbing their speech faculties. Ungallant observers have suggested\r\nthat the sex quality of ready speech is too profoundly seated in\r\nnature to be disturbed by mere bashfulness, but there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that the breathing of women has much to do with the difference\r\nbetween them and men in the matter of speech defects.\r\n\r\nWhen stuttering occurs in women the defect is much less tractable and\r\nis usually dependent on a more serious disturbance of the psyche or of\r\nthe central nervous system. The prognosis of cases of stuttering in\r\nwomen is not so good as in men, but remarkable cures are sometimes\r\neffected by mental treatment of the self-consciousness which causes\r\nthe speech defect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrection of Respiratory Defects.--This last point, the correction of\r\nall pathological conditions in the respiratory tract, is especially\r\nimportant. Many stutterers are for one reason or another mouth\r\nbreathers. If they are mouth breathers because they have adenoids,\r\nthese must be removed. This must {574} be done early in life,\r\ncertainly not later than the third or fourth year, or else there will\r\ncome a serious deformation of the chest and that chicken-breastedness,\r\nwhich is not undesirable in itself, but which hampers to some extent\r\nthe action of the diaphragm because that muscle cannot act as well in\r\nthe deformed as in the natural chest. Not all who are chicken-breasted\r\nhave any defect of speech, nor any tendency to stutter, but when there\r\nis a natural tendency to a lack of inco-ordination because of\r\nsub-normal nervous ability the presence of such a deformity makes the\r\nprospect of cure much less favorable than would otherwise be the case.\r\nIf the mouth-breathing is due to stoppage of the nostrils, this must\r\nbe relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRealization of Allied Conditions.--A helpful suggestion for stutterers\r\nis found in the recognition of the fact that there are so many\r\nconditions allied to stuttering and so many people afflicted with\r\nthem. Under the heading Neurotic Esophageal Stricture stuttering in\r\nswallowing is treated of. In the chapters on urinary symptoms\r\nstuttering in urination is discussed. Any set of muscles requiring\r\ncareful co-ordination may thus be disturbed. The stutterer is apt to\r\nlook upon his affliction as a very special individual annoyance. When\r\nhe learns that in practically every set of muscles requiring nice\r\nadjustment for function like difficulties may occur, that in every\r\naction requiring careful co-ordination of muscles there may be a\r\nsimilar disturbance, and yet that in most of them careful mental\r\ndiscipline, especially training in self-control, proves a source of\r\nrelief, he takes new courage to face the struggle necessary to\r\novercome the self-consciousness which is the root of most of these\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nA striking form of inability to co-ordinate muscles so as to enable\r\nthem to perform their ordinary function is aphonia, or mutism,\r\nsometimes spoken of as hysterical mutism. After some sudden emotion or\r\nfright or accident a neurotic person proves to be quite unable to\r\ntalk. He cannot utter a sound. In Prof. Raymond's clinic at the\r\nSalpetriere I once saw the classical case described by Charcot and\r\npresented at his clinics several times. It was a man whose wife had\r\nrun away from him and been taken back three times. Each time on her\r\ndisappearance he had an attack of aphonia, inability to utter a sound\r\nof any kind. It lasted for from several weeks to a few days. The cases\r\nare much commoner in women. After a disappointment in love or a scare\r\nthe patients become unable to speak. Sometimes they can whisper but\r\ncannot phonate. The affection is entirely functional or neurotic, and\r\nif the patient's mind is properly predisposed speech returns without\r\ndifficulty or delay. A little massage of the muscles of the throat or\r\nof the tongue by means of a tongue depressor or the use of Politzer's\r\nbag in the nose with the assurance that after proper swallowing\r\nmovements the ability to speak will return, have proved successful.\r\nOccasionally hypnotism is recommended for these cases, but many of\r\nthem are too highly neurotic to be readily susceptible to hypnotism\r\nand, besides, suggestion in the waking state proves just as effective.\r\n\r\nAfter several days of speechlessness it seems little short of\r\nmarvelous to make a patient talk readily after a little massage of the\r\nthroat. It is all dependent, however, upon confident assurance and the\r\nsuggestion to talk. The physician himself must possess absolute\r\nconfidence in his power to bring this about, for the slightest sign of\r\ndoubt or hesitation will make it impossible {575} to influence the\r\npatient and will completely destroy his psychotherapeutic efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neurotic Esophageal Stricture_.--A rare but interesting form of\r\nneurosis, which should be studied in connection with stuttering\r\nbecause of the light shed on both by their relations to each other, is\r\nthat seen in the sufferers from so-called neurotic esophageal\r\nstricture. These patients are unable to swallow solids except after\r\ndetermined deliberate effort and occasionally the discomfort caused by\r\nthis effort leads them to eat much less than is sufficient for their\r\nnutrition. The physician is sometimes tempted to overcome the\r\nspasmodic closure or partial closure of the esophagus by bougies and\r\ndilators, and these the patients learn to pass by themselves. I have\r\nnever known any of these cases to be benefited more than temporarily\r\nby this treatment and I have seen two that were made distinctly worse.\r\nForcible dilatation by concentrating attention on the affected parts\r\nhampers the proper flow of nervous impulses and the ordinary reaction\r\nto these which should occur.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate how closely related to stuttering this spasmodic closure\r\nof the esophagus is, it is necessary to see these patients swallow\r\nwhen they do not know that they are under observation. For when they\r\nare on exhibition for the physician, when their condition is\r\nintensified by the excitement of the occasion and by the definite\r\npurpose to make the doctor appreciate how serious is their case, they\r\nswallow with more difficulty. Nearly always they have more difficulty\r\nin eating in public than with friends, and it is only with those with\r\nwhom the patient is on a footing of perfect familiarity that the best\r\nswallowing power is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn sufferers from esophageal stricture of the neurotic type the\r\nmuscles by an unfortunate perversion of nerve force contract in front\r\nof the bolus instead of behind it. This contraction may be so complete\r\nas to prevent even the swallowing of liquids. Usually, however,\r\nliquids can be swallowed without much difficulty. Such patients, then,\r\nif they become much run down in weight, must be fed on milk and eggs\r\nand ice cream and the gruels and soups until they gain in weight.\r\nWhile they are much under weight their condition is distinctly worse\r\nand their power of co-ordination much less. It is, however, not hard\r\nto make them gain in weight. This gain in weight acts as a strong\r\nsuggestion which persuades them that they are getting better and this\r\nof itself soon helps them to control their muscles. Local treatment\r\ndoes harm rather than good. Ice in small pieces swallowed shortly\r\nbefore a meal seems in some patients to have the effect of making the\r\nmuscles less prone to follow the inco-ordinate nervous action and thus\r\nrenders swallowing much easier. In some, and especially in nervous\r\npeople, warm liquids have the same effect, while ice produces further\r\nirritation. Acids nearly always increase the spasmodic condition.\r\nSucking a piece of hard candy for some time before a meal, especially\r\nif it is not too sweet nor flavored with acid, helps some people.\r\n\r\nNearly all of them when carefully questioned prove to have special\r\nfoods that are more difficult of deglutition than others. Not\r\ninfrequently these idiosyncrasies for food are found to follow ideas\r\nwith regard to their digestibility. If the patient is hurrying for any\r\nreason and suddenly becomes conscious that he is not masticating\r\nsufficiently, swallowing at once becomes much more difficult.\r\n\r\n{576}\r\n\r\nThe main element in the treatment, however, must be as far as possible\r\nto get the patient's mind off his condition. The more attention he\r\ngives to it the worse it will be. No treatment that we have will cure\r\nit any more than stuttering can be cured, though a deliberate effort\r\nto form a habit for the control of the swallowing muscles will often\r\ndo much to lessen the discomfort and the inability to swallow.\r\n\r\nIt is important in all these cases to be sure that there has been no\r\nincident in childhood which might have caused the production of scar\r\ntissue in the esophagus with a consequent stricture. Sometimes it is\r\nmany years before this manifests itself and, as in the case of the\r\nurethra, even ten to twenty years may pass before serious trouble\r\ncomes. When the first symptoms are noticed, the actual stricture may\r\nbe so slight as scarcely to be possible of diagnosis by the bougie.\r\nOccasionally the first symptom of a cancer of the esophagus is an\r\ninability to swallow, and cancers of the esophagus have been known to\r\noccur in quite young people, especially young men. I remember seeing a\r\ncase at autopsy in Vienna where the first symptom had been the\r\ndifficulty of swallowing and the man, at the recommendation of\r\nfriends, swallowed a glass of beer with some black peppers in it and\r\nthese stuck in his esophagus and produced death. Such cases are\r\nexceptional but must not be forgotten. Neurotic esophageal stricture\r\nis entirely benignant and its prognosis altogether favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The treatment of stuttering presents the best example that\r\nwe have of the influence of the mind over neurotic difficulties of any\r\nand every kind. Many forms of treatment have been announced as\r\nsuccessful, most frequently in the hands of men who have themselves\r\nbeen stutterers and who have helped themselves by them. This would\r\nseem to make it clear beyond all doubt that discoveries in direct\r\ntherapeutics had been found. As a matter of fact, however, when a\r\nreview of all the methods is made, they are seen to be so different\r\nfrom one another and founded on such essentially diverse principles\r\nthat the only common connecting link to be found is in the occupation\r\nof mind with something else besides speech which all these methods\r\nrecommend. We have had successful cures announced by surgery, by\r\ndiscipline, by making speech more difficult by obstacles of various\r\nkinds, by special positions of the tongue--up against the palate or\r\ndown against the floor of the mouth--by associated movements, by\r\nrhythmic speech, by special control of the muscles of respiration, and\r\nof many other structures much less related to speech. The interesting\r\nphase of all this is the uniform success claimed by different\r\nspecialists using many different methods.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of history cures have been suggested. That idea,\r\nstill held among the non-medical, that the sufferer from a difficulty\r\nof speech is tongue-tied and needs to have the frenum cut, is as old\r\nas the history of medicine. Galen suggested cauterization of the\r\ntongue. Aetius, the first prominent Christian physician of whom we\r\nhave any record, divided the frenum of the tongue. So did Paul of\r\nAEgina. Of course, in the Renaissance, when the old medical classics\r\nwere revived, this became a favorite method of treatment. Hildanus is\r\nsure that it accomplishes great things. This idea has never been\r\nentirely given up, and recurs from time to time in the practice of\r\nthose who do not reason much, but who look for some ready explanation\r\nand, above all, some direct method of treatment. Much more {577}\r\nserious surgical intervention has been suggested from time to time,\r\nhowever. Velpeau advised division of the extensor muscles of the\r\ntongue. Of course a number of surgeons have quite properly insisted on\r\nthe removal of the tonsils, uvula, polyps in the nose and other\r\nobstructions of respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singing in Treatment_.--A number of the stuttering cures employ\r\nsinging as a method of training in forthright utterance. Few people\r\nstutter when they sing. Most people can be given confidence in\r\nthemselves and their power to talk right on by being shown that as\r\nsoon as they try to follow a set of notes there is little or no\r\ndifficulty in utterance. The teaching of singing, then, is of distinct\r\nvalue in many cases. Taking advantage of this a number of those who\r\ncorrect stuttering endeavor to introduce a certain rhythm into speech.\r\nSo long as the rhythm can be maintained stuttering does not occur. As\r\nKussmaul has pointed out the rhythmus acts as an efficient\r\nwill-regulator, so that nerve impulses go down regularly and are not\r\ninterrupted by consciousness and by the sudden starts and stoppages\r\ndue to fear and tremor and mental uneasiness. Undoubtedly the lesson\r\nof this method of teaching is extremely important as an index of how\r\nstuttering may be relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regulation of Respiration_.--A number of systems to correct\r\nstuttering depend on the regulation of breathing. It has been shown\r\nover and over again, and notably by Prof. Gutzman of Berlin,\r\n[Footnote 42] that one of the most important differences between\r\nstutterers and those who talk naturally is that the normal individual\r\ntalks during expiration as may be seen in Fig. 23, while the stutterer\r\nbegins at the end of inspiration or at least where normally on the\r\nrespiratory curve expiration is just about to begin, but instead of\r\npermitting his diaphragm to go up as in ordinary expiration, the\r\nstutterer makes it sink lower and lower in a forced inspiration.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: See my translation of one of his clinical\r\n    lectures In _The International Clinic_ for July, 1899.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Normal Diaphragm Curve in Normal Breathing.\r\n  Expiration as we Talk Normally.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Curve in Diaphragm Before and During Talking\r\n  by a Stutterer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attention to Something Besides Speech_.--The attention must be\r\ncentered on something besides speech itself. This is the important\r\nelement in any method of treating stuttering. If it is allowed to\r\noccupy itself with that {578} nothing will save the individual from\r\ngetting tangled in the efforts that he makes to co-ordinate the\r\ncomplex movements necessary, though if he would only allow them to\r\nproceed automatically, as do the rest of mankind, there would be no\r\ndifficulty at all. Washington Irving, so ready with the pen, could not\r\nutter two successive sentences at a banquet without having to sit\r\ndown, with expression absolutely inhibited from excitement.\r\nExpression, thought, utterance--all may be inhibited by overconscious\r\nattention, which may also disturb all other complex activities.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting methods of treatment for stuttering are those\r\nwhich involve the use of various hindrances to speech and which would\r\nseem to be least likely to make it possible for a person already\r\nlaboring under speech difficulties to talk with more ease. The secret\r\nis, of course, that the added impediments so distract the attention of\r\nthe patient that he is unconscious of the co-ordination necessary for\r\nspeech and so accomplishes it without difficulty. It is because of\r\nover-attention to himself that the disturbance occurs. These methods\r\ndeveloped very early in history. We all know the tradition of\r\nDemosthenes overcoming his impediment by placing pebbles in his mouth.\r\nOne of the most earnest advocates of a similar method, who had himself\r\nsuffered very seriously from stuttering was the Rev. Charles Kingsley,\r\none of the most distinguished of English literary men. He cured\r\nhimself, or at least greatly relieved his symptoms, by keeping a cork\r\nfast between his back teeth.\r\n\r\nThere have been many other curious suggestions for the cure of\r\nstuttering. What was known as the American method had great vogue in\r\nthe early part of the nineteenth century. It was probably invented by\r\nYeats of New York, though it came to be known as the Leigh method.\r\nYeats, himself a physician, seemed to fear that he might fall into\r\nprofessional disrepute if he advertised the method in any way, so he\r\nhad his daughter's governess, a Mrs. Leigh, open an institute for the\r\ncure of stuttering in which this method was practiced and it proved to\r\nbe very successful. The entire secret of it was to have the patient\r\nraise the tip of the tongue to the palate and hold it there while\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of treatment that attracted considerable attention\r\nconsisted mainly of just exactly the opposite maneuver, that is,\r\nkeeping the tongue as far as possible firmly placed on the floor of\r\nthe mouth during speech. It is evident that neither of these\r\nsuggestions does anything more than occupy the patient's attention\r\nwith an additional activity, so that his speech function may be\r\nallowed to proceed automatically of itself, as it will if not\r\ndisturbed by attention to it and by conscious attempts to regulate the\r\nvarious activities of it. Instruments were invented to help the\r\npatients to secure various positions of the tongue. Itard, for\r\ninstance, during the second decade of the nineteenth century invented\r\na golden or ivory fork to be placed beneath the tongue, so as to\r\nsupport it.\r\n\r\nAfter the various methods of managing the tongue, the most popular\r\ncurative maneuver has been that of regulating the breathing. During\r\nthe nineteenth century there were at least a dozen different methods,\r\nall of which had a number of reported successes, of treating\r\nstuttering by means of breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nVery simple methods of diverting the attention from speech are quite\r\n{579} sufficient in many cases to bring improvement. For instance, the\r\ninsertion of extra letters that are themselves easy to say between\r\nwords or preceding consonants that are hard to utter has been a\r\nfavorite method among the specialists in stuttering. Johann Mueller, as\r\nI said, suggested an e. Others have suggested an n. Occasionally\r\nstutterers themselves form the habit of using an m or a to and find\r\nthat it aids their facility in uttering difficult sounds over which\r\nthey would otherwise halt and stutter. A combination of these methods,\r\nas, for instance, an e between all words and the placing of an easy n\r\nbefore the most difficult sounds, has been repeatedly revived as an\r\ninfallible method of treatment.\r\n\r\nAll this serves to show that in patients whose functions are being\r\ninterfered with by over-attention diversion of mind must be the main\r\nremedy. If this can be secured, the function they are disturbing will\r\nbe allowed to proceed unhampered. What will prove effective for one\r\npatient will fail with another, however. After the patient gets used\r\nto a particular form of diversion another must be tried. Simple\r\nmethods are sometimes sufficient to secure good results. The one thing\r\nis not to be discouraged and to proceed from one effort to another,\r\nsatisfied even if relief is obtained for a while, for after relapse\r\nanother method of treatment may always be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestion for Stuttering_.--There are many systems to train people\r\nout of the spasmodic inco-ordination that constitutes stuttering. All\r\nof these systems have their successes, but, as is well known, all of\r\nthem have their failures. When the patient has confidence in the\r\nteacher and his method there is practically always quite a remarkable\r\nimprovement, at the beginning. This improvement is more noticeable\r\nduring the first month than at any other time. Not infrequently after\r\nthis there is a tendency for patients to drop back into old habits,\r\napparently discouraged, as a consequence of loss of confidence. It is\r\nthe mental element that means more than anything else. It is the old,\r\nold story that we have to repeat with regard to every chronic ailment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distraction of Mind_.--Each inventor is sure that his method is the\r\nbest and his \"cured cases\" support his claim. Others who try his\r\nmethod, however, never succeed as well as he does and those who are\r\ninterested invent methods of their own. I have on my desk, as I write,\r\nsix different, infallible--to their authors--methods of treating\r\nstuttering. I am sure that none of them succeed absolutely, that is,\r\nnone of them will cure every case and most of them will not succeed\r\nbeyond a moderate degree, except where the enthusiasm and the\r\nconfidence of the inventor or an immediate disciple of his is behind\r\nthem to make them efficient. There are all sorts of elements in these\r\ncures, but most of them depend on their power to distract the patient\r\nfrom his over-attention to himself and what he is doing when he talks,\r\nso as to permit without hindrance the automatic movements which are so\r\nnecessary for the complex function we call speech. Those who have\r\nspent most time in treating stutterers confess that the effect\r\nproduced upon the patient's mind is an extremely important part of the\r\ntreatment and that, if this cannot be secured, failure is almost\r\ncertain. If the patient has no confidence that he can be cured and by\r\nthis particular method, failure is inevitable from the very beginning\r\nand just as soon as a patient loses confidence improvement ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n{580}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTREMORS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo types of tremors come to us for treatment: those that are quite\r\ninvoluntary and occur when muscles are at rest, and those that are\r\nassociated with voluntary movements. The most common type of\r\ninvoluntary tremor is that seen in paralysis agitans to which a\r\nspecial chapter is devoted. After this, though coming for treatment\r\nmuch less frequently, is senile tremor which may, however, also be\r\nincreased by voluntary movement. The tremors associated with voluntary\r\nmovements are spoken of as intentional tremors. They may occur as the\r\nresult of organic disease of the nervous system and the most\r\ncharacteristic type is that seen in multiple sclerosis. They are more\r\nfrequent, however, with functional diseases of the nervous system and\r\nwith emotional disturbances of various kinds. They are especially\r\nfrequent as the result of dreads. Usually the idea of tremor is\r\nassociated only with the head and the hands. Tremors may occur in\r\nother parts of the body, however, and tremors of the legs are\r\nparticularly important. A familiar type is the tremor and unsteadiness\r\nof the legs which occur as a consequence of the dread of heights when\r\na person unused to such situation attempts to walk across a narrow\r\npath a great distance above the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenile Tremor.--The most common of the involuntary tremors is that\r\nassociated with old age. It develops in practically all very old\r\npeople, but it comes to some who are comparatively young. Its\r\noccurrence at the age of fifty-five usually gives the sufferer a\r\nsevere shock which is emphasized by the attitude of mind of friends\r\ntoward the affection. They seem to be always sure that it is the index\r\nof rapidly advancing age and that it is practically a signal of\r\napproaching dissolution. As a matter of fact, when unassociated with\r\ngross pathological lesions, the senile tremor has no such\r\nsignificance. When associated with definite lesions it is the\r\nprognosis of the special condition and not any supposed significance\r\nof this particular symptom of tremor that expresses the genuine\r\noutlook in the case. Many people who live to a very old age develop\r\ntremor before they are threescore. Most of those who live to be eighty\r\nor more have some tremor that develops about or just after the age of\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Significance_.--Senile tremor is supposed to be due to, and in most\r\ncases probably is the result of, an overgrowth of connective tissue in\r\nthe central nervous system which disturbs the ordinary conduction of\r\nnerve impulses, rendering them wavering and uncertain. This seems to\r\nindicate that it will not be long before the advancement of this\r\nsclerotic process will make serious inroads on the vigor of the\r\nindividual. As a matter of repeated observation, however, the ordinary\r\ninvoluntary tremor of old people may last twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reassurance_.--The main principle in the treatment of tremors of the\r\nold is to make the patients realize that the symptom has no such bad\r\nprognosis as is usually attributed to it. Of course, they will find\r\nthis out for themselves after a few years, but what they need is\r\nassurance at the beginning lest during the period of depression\r\nconsequent upon the conclusion that the end is not far {581} off,\r\nwhich seems to be forced on them by their fears and the foolish\r\nsympathy of friends, their resistive vitality should be so lowered as\r\nto permit the invasion of some serious disease. In spite of\r\napprehensions on the part of themselves and friends, tremor is rather\r\na good sign than a bad one. It indicates the formation of connective\r\ntissue in the central nervous system, but this is always a slow\r\nprocess and is usually quite benign. As a matter of fact, most\r\nsclerotic processes are so chronic as to be compensatory in their\r\naction for many other degenerations. Those in whom tremor develops\r\nearly often seem to be better protected against rupture of cerebral\r\narteries, as if the growth of connective tissue was a conservative\r\nprocess here also. Information of this kind helps patients not to\r\nborrow trouble because of their condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntention Tremors.--The tremors that occur in association with\r\nvoluntary movements are often very troublesome and may be difficult to\r\nmanage. The worst cases are entirely functional. They are typical\r\nneuroses and often develop as a consequence of some serious crisis\r\nthrough which the nervous system has passed. In older people they\r\nsometimes pass over into paralysis agitans or a close simulant of that\r\naffection. The incident of the Texas sheriff and the Indian related in\r\nthe chapter on Paralysis Agitans illustrates how these tremors may be\r\ninduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremors from Fright_.--Frequently the tremors have no direct\r\nconnection with any action, though they may be the result of fright. A\r\nlittle girl bitten by a dog and much shocked may, for some time\r\nafterwards, be quite unable to stand when she sees a dog on the\r\nstreet, so disturbing is the tremor that comes over her. Tremors of\r\nthe same kind have been connected with horses after the patient had\r\nbeen run down in the street, and, in one case that I saw even when the\r\npatient was only thrown out of a carriage during a runaway.\r\nOccasionally fright by a burglar may cause a distinct tremulousness\r\nthat supervenes whenever the patient thereafter is wakened suddenly at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence of Dread.--Tremors of all kinds can be made worse by the\r\ndread of them. In the chapter on Dreads we discuss the disturbance of\r\nfunction by dreads and especially the tendency to exaggeration of\r\npathological conditions of any kind when the patient's mind becomes\r\nconcentrated on it. Steadiness in any position is due to a nice\r\nbalancing of extensor and flexor muscles requiring the sending down of\r\na continuous stream of impulses. The equilibrium is attained and\r\nmaintained in spite of the fact that, as a rule, the flexor muscles\r\nare stronger than the extensors and better situated to exert their\r\nmechanical force. If anything happens to disturb this balance even to\r\na slight degree, the mind becomes attracted to it and there is a\r\ncorresponding result as in stuttering, or other complex function when\r\nsurveillance is too great. It is important to remember this at the\r\nbeginning of all cases of tremor, for the patient nearly always\r\nexaggerates his tremor by attention to it and can be made so much\r\nbetter by reassurance and diversion of mind that he is much encouraged\r\nand his general health usually improves, making him feel, even though\r\nhis affection is organic, that he is being cured.\r\n\r\nTremors may occur in connection with almost any set of actions\r\nrequiring special co-ordination of muscles, but they are especially\r\nlikely to occur when a feeling of dread disturbs the control over\r\nmuscles. A typical example of this is noted in shaving. There are many\r\nmen who cannot shave without trembling so as to cut themselves. The\r\nfeeling that they have a sharp instrument in their {582} hand with\r\nwhich they may cut themselves sets up the tremor. There are others who\r\ncannot shave because they dread that while using the instrument over\r\nthe important organs of the neck, and especially the blood vessels,\r\nthey may be tempted to cut their throats. This is, of course, purely a\r\ndread and not a tremor. Some men find both the dread and the tremor\r\nmuch worse at times when they are tired and worried, and can shave\r\nvery well at other times. Some men can shave very well when they are\r\nnot under observation, but if anyone is looking at them they tremble\r\nand cut themselves. The safety razor usually does away with these\r\ntroubles, large or small, but if it should happen that by particularly\r\ninexpert use they cut themselves even with a safety razor, especially\r\nin the throat region, the old dread and tremor reassert themselves and\r\nshaving becomes almost as difficult as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-consciousness.--Almost any position or action in which a man\r\nfeels himself under observation may cause one of these tremors. As a\r\nconsequence this particular set of actions may become the source of so\r\nmuch discomfort as to produce an intense sense of fatigue. It may,\r\nindeed, become quite impossible of accomplishment. Some teachers\r\ncannot do demonstrating work on a blackboard before a large unfamiliar\r\nclass, at least not without serious efforts to control themselves,\r\nthough they may be facile demonstrators before a small class. I have\r\nknown men, however, who practically could not do blackboard work at\r\nall because of nervousness. Their writing went all askew and very\r\noften their thoughts would not follow one another in such order as to\r\nmake demonstrations possible. Sometimes they were good talkers, so\r\nlong as they did not turn their backs to the class and feel the eyes\r\nof all on them. The same thing is true of such religious services as\r\nMass in the Catholic Church, where some of the clergymen have this\r\nfeeling. I know of priests who have not said Mass publicly for years\r\nand others who can only say it in a small chapel before a few people\r\nbecause of the intense discomfort of the fatigue caused by this state\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stage Fright_.--It is not alone the hands and the arms that tremors\r\nare likely to affect, for they may also occur in the legs. A typical\r\nand familiar case is the tremor that occurs upon the first appearance\r\nbefore large audiences of orators or actors or clergymen. Owing to\r\nexcitement, they are unable to make flexor and extensor muscles\r\nexactly balance each other and the consequence is a tremulous movement\r\nthat may be complicated by some swaying. Some people never lose this\r\nin spite of long experience in public appearance. Young people may\r\nhave it upon being introduced to persons of whom they think a great\r\ndeal. This passes off with years, as a rule, but in some it persists,\r\nand any excitement causes tremor of the legs and swaying movements.\r\nThe effort to control this is often severe and causes intense fatigue.\r\n\r\nAny set of movements requiring even slight co-ordination of muscles\r\nmay be the subject of disturbance by a tremor. Since the writing of\r\nthe book on Pastoral Medicine, a text-book of medical information\r\nmeant to be of assistance to clergymen,  [Footnote 43] I have had some\r\nrather interesting tremors associated with the performance of clerical\r\nduties brought to my attention. One of these is a trembling of the\r\nlegs which makes standing at a high altar almost impossible. Another\r\ntroublesome tremor is that associated with the giving of communion.\r\n{583} Most priests find no difficulty in the performance of the rite.\r\nSome of them are much worried and anxious about it, however, and\r\ndevelop a slight tremor. Others become so nervous in performing the\r\nceremony that they cannot succeed in placing the Host on the tongue of\r\nthe communicant without certain false movements. These may cause them\r\nto touch the lips or the cheeks of the recipient and after this has\r\nhappened a few times the giving of communion becomes practically\r\nimpossible for them. Occasionally the men thus affected have no other\r\nnervous symptoms and often they are very intelligent, strong-minded\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 43: O'Malley and Walsh, \"Pastoral Medicine.\" Longmans, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Health.--Tremor patients always complain more of this\r\nsymptom when they are in a run-down condition. One of them is a\r\nwealthy merchant who, when he can be persuaded to take a vacation,\r\ncomes back with nearly all the manifestations of his tremor latent or,\r\nat least, well under control. Another is a broker who at the end of a\r\nlong winter of excitement and worry is at his worst, but who after a\r\nvacation in the North Woods is quite well again. Slight symptoms of\r\nthis kind are not unusual in teachers, especially women, though I have\r\nseen them also in men, and are much more complained of at the end of\r\nthe year when the individuals are in poorer general condition than at\r\nany other time. The symptom itself is annoying because of the notice\r\nthat it attracts, but their dread that it may have some serious\r\nsignificance, indicating the development of a progressive lesion of\r\nthe central nervous system, constitutes the worst part of their\r\nailment. When the intentional tremor is intermittent and occurs only\r\nat times of excitement, or when the patients are under observation,\r\nthey can be reassured that it is merely neurotic and that no ulterior\r\ndevelopment is to be anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The treatment of these conditions consists first in\r\nbringing the patient's health up to its normal condition as far as\r\nthat is possible. Many of the sufferers from tremors are under weight.\r\nWhenever they are, a definite, determined effort must be made to bring\r\nthem up to it. This must be done even though they insist that they\r\nhave never been heavier and that to be rather underweight is a family\r\ntrait. In many cases it will be found that this family trait, instead\r\nof being due to some inevitable hereditary tendency, is only the\r\nresult of family habits in the matter of eating. Many of these people\r\ndo not eat substantial breakfasts. Their tremor, too, is likely to be\r\nworse in the early morning than at any other time during the day,\r\nunless, of course, they have become overtired during the day, when the\r\ntremor will reassert itself with vigor. Most of them are much less\r\ndisturbed in the afternoon than before. The drug treatment of the\r\naffection consists mainly in the use of nux vomica, but, not in the\r\nsmall doses of five or ten drops so often employed, but, according to\r\nthe size of the individual, beginning with fifteen or twenty minims,\r\nthirty or forty drops, and gradually increased to physiological\r\ntolerance, when the dose should be set somewhat below that.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Control_.--The main treatment must consist, however, in\r\nenabling the patient to secure psychic control over himself and his\r\nmuscles. This is not an easy matter. Most of them are quite\r\ndiscouraged, but their attitude of mind must be changed and the real\r\nsignificance of their affection made clear to them. As a rule, they\r\nhave either heard or read or been told by a physician that their\r\nintentional tremor is significant of a serious pathological lesion of\r\nthe central nervous system. Some of them have heard of multiple\r\nsclerosis {584} and are much disturbed. They must be reassured and it\r\nmust be made clear to them that their disease is really due to\r\nover-consciousness and consequent lack of control. A good deal of\r\nreassurance can be given by telling them of patients who suffer from\r\nailments not unlike theirs, showing how multiform the affection is. A\r\nman who has trouble with his signature may be told about the man who\r\nfinds it difficult to drink when under observation, then, as a rule,\r\nhe will better realize the neurotic character of his affection. With\r\nhysterical women this method must be used with care or the story of\r\nanother patient will act as a suggestion and the physician will\r\nsubsequently be treated to an exhibition of the symptoms which he has\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Self-Discipline_.--Persistent quiet discipline is the one thing that\r\neventually does any good. When patients are first told of this and are\r\npersuaded to attempt it, they make such a determined effort to\r\novercome the affection that they make themselves more conscious of it\r\nthan before with the result that their tremor and spasmodic movements\r\nare emphasized. It is the old story of the man trying to stand so\r\nstraight that he falls backwards. It must be made clear to them that\r\ndiscipline, to be of any value, must be carried out as much as\r\npossible without consciousness of it and with all available artificial\r\naids. The man who has trouble with his signature may be shown that he\r\ncan overcome much of the tendency to tremor and spasm of the forearm\r\nmuscles that are at the root of his difficulty by sitting at a higher\r\nchair, so that his arm swings free of the table and so that, in\r\nGowers' phrase, if a pen were attached to his elbow it would write the\r\nsame thing as the pen in his hand. The man who trembles as he drinks\r\nmay be taught for a time to raise a cup to his lips while resting his\r\nelbow on the table and bringing his head well down. Nearly always\r\nmethods of performing particular actions that require less effort can\r\nbe found, until the habit of over-consciousness and loss of control is\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypnotism and Waking Suggestion_.--Occasionally hypnotism is\r\neffective in these cases, but there is likely to be a relapse unless\r\nthere is some discipline before and after its use. Suggestion in the\r\nwaking state is often very effective. Patients need to be talked to\r\nand even though intelligent they need to be reminded at regular\r\nintervals for some time that their ailment is merely functional and\r\nnot organic. Nearly always it will be found that they trace its\r\nbeginning to some pathological event: occasionally there has been a\r\nsevere accident, but sometimes only a slight accident seems to them a\r\nsufficient explanation. Sometimes it follows an attack of pneumonia,\r\noftener still typhoid fever. In these cases the patients become\r\nconvinced that this is one of the marks left after the accident or\r\ndisease and so it is rather hard to persuade them that they can be\r\ncured. All such impressions, which act as auto-suggestions for the\r\ncontinuance of their tremor and lack of control, must be combated,\r\notherwise there is very little hope of improvement. The preceding\r\ndisease is not the direct cause, though the weakness consequent upon\r\nit may predispose to the tremor. Overhaste in attempting to resume\r\ntheir occupations before their strength has returned is often the real\r\ncause. It is the patient's mind more than his body that needs to be\r\nset in order, but this will not be possible unless the physical\r\ncondition is normal and thorough reassurance can be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n{585}\r\n\r\nDISORDERS OF THE PSYCHE\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII\r\n\r\n_PSYCHO-NEUROSES_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPSYCHO-NEUROSES (HYSTERIA)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the derivation of the name indicates, psycho-neuroses are\r\nfunctional nervous affections dependent on states of mind. They are\r\nnot necessarily originated by the mind, though they may be. Their\r\nspontaneous occurrence as pure psychic phenomena, however, is rather\r\nrare. There is practically always some slight physical cause. This may\r\nbe severe, for all diseases have neurotic accompaniments that disturb\r\nthe nerves involved and exaggerate the original symptoms. In most\r\ncases the patient has no serious interest to divert his or her mind\r\nfrom this occupation with self, and as a consequence the particular\r\nfeeling fills up the whole of consciousness, and as it is painful to\r\nbegin with, the pain, following Cajal's law of avalanche, may become\r\nalmost intolerable.\r\n\r\nIt is of primary importance to remember, however, that there is\r\npractically always a physical basis for these curiously interesting\r\naffections which are so difficult to treat and which have so often\r\nproved the despair of physicians. While the attitude of mind must be\r\nchanged, the physical state itself must be corrected. These two things\r\nmust be secured at the same time, however, for attention to the\r\nphysical state without correction of mental attitude will usually only\r\nemphasize the condition by calling further attention to the symptoms.\r\nThis is especially true of local treatment. The mind must, above all,\r\nbe treated and diversion of attention secured. Psycho-neuroses may\r\noccur in connection with sensory or motor nerves. The patient may\r\neither complain of intense pain in some part of the body for which\r\nthere is but a very slight basis, or may be unable to move certain\r\nmuscles, or there may be a combination of sensory and motor symptoms\r\nwith complaint of pain on movement. The painful conditions are most\r\nimportant because they prove a source of worry and anxiety to the\r\npatient's friends, as well as often of such annoyance at unsuitable\r\nhours as deprives those near them of rest to a degree that may\r\nundermine health.\r\n\r\n{586}\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF NEUROTIC SIMULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery possible painful condition is simulated by these psycho-neurotic\r\nconditions. They occur probably with more frequency in the abdomen\r\nthan elsewhere; they may be thought to be colicky in nature and, as a\r\nrule, some accumulation of gas will be found. This gas is sometimes\r\nswallowed air and sometimes gaseous products that have been diffused\r\napparently from the blood in the intestinal walls. This always\r\nproduces discomfort but nothing like the discomfort that the patient\r\ncomplains of. The condition if treated by carminatives will nearly\r\nalways be emphasized rather than relieved. Local treatment by heat\r\nwill help oftener, but may exacerbate it. When chronic constipation is\r\npresent, calomel in divided doses is suggestive as well as medicinal.\r\n\r\nThere may be gastric crises that recall those of tabes, and there may\r\nbe vesical and rectal crises of a similar nature. I have seen a\r\npatient complain of every symptom of stone in the kidney. At the\r\nbeginning the pains were vague, but after she had been to several\r\nphysicians and had been asked certain questions intended to elicit\r\npathognomonic signs of stone these questions were answered in the\r\naffirmative. Her attacks became strikingly like renal colic. After a\r\nconsultation, at which two physicians and a surgeon were present, she\r\nwas operated upon for stone in the left kidney. No trace of it was\r\nfound. But after this she was well nearly a year. Then she had another\r\ncrisis of pain in the early morning hours, a time when her painful\r\ncondition always came on, apparently because it attracted more\r\nattention and caused more disturbance at this time, and now all the\r\nsymptoms pointed to the right kidney. She was treated on the principle\r\nthat it was a neurosis, was made to gain some fifteen pounds in\r\nweight, has since then had no attacks, has not passed any stones, and\r\nthere seems no doubt but that the whole case was merely neurotic.\r\nDuring her attacks instead of having suppression of urine, she had a\r\nfree flow of urine and no blood. It is not unlikely that the physical\r\nbasis of the attacks was that condition of the kidney which allows\r\nurine to flow through very freely during neurotic conditions and which\r\nsomehow got into the sphere of her consciousness and being\r\nover-attended to became extremely painful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretory Neuroses.--Lying between the pain and motor neuroses and\r\ndependent on psychic elements to some extent at least, there is a\r\nseries of neuroses that have as their principal symptoms an increase\r\nor decrease of secretion. Occasionally, of course, they are\r\ncomplicated by motor neuroses, especially in connection with the\r\nviscera. There are various stomach affections, represented by an\r\nincrease or decrease in stomach secretion, and accompanied by pain,\r\ndiscomfort, and decrease or increase of peristalsis. There are biliary\r\nneuroses accompanied by increase or inhibition of biliary secretions.\r\nThere are gastric neuroses associated with vomiting, often very\r\nintractable, in which there seems to be sometimes a hypersecretion of\r\ngastric juice and sometimes a lessened secretion. All of these occur,\r\nas is said, spontaneously, but there will usually be found a history\r\nof some exhaustive work or worry during the weeks or months just\r\nbefore. Apparently nervous control is lost and then the secretory\r\nneurosis manifests itself sometimes in conjunction with painful or\r\nmotor affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Vomiting.--Persistent vomiting occurs in these cases but is\r\nnot {587} so serious as it seems and patients do not lose weight, as\r\nmight be expected. There is sometimes even a probability that some of\r\nthe food ingested finds its way through the pylorus and is used for\r\nnutrition, though the vomiting may come on not long after ingestion.\r\nPractically always nature asserts herself and stops the vomiting when\r\nserious conditions seem about to develop. The solicitude of relatives\r\nmay be calmed by this assurance, and just as soon, as a rule, as they\r\nshow less anxiety about the patient, the first symptoms of improvement\r\nwill be noted. The fasting girls exploited in the newspapers, in\r\nconnection with these neurotic conditions are often frauds and\r\ninvestigation has shown on a number of occasions that they were\r\nobtaining food surreptitiously. It must not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat, even though these cases have been discredited, we have a number\r\nof cases on record of men and women who have taken absolutely nothing\r\nnutritious and only water for from ten to forty or even fifty days.\r\nUntil at least ten days have passed in one of these gastric neuroses,\r\nthen, there is no need for urgent solicitude, and this of itself, when\r\nproperly explained, makes an excellent favorable suggestion for these\r\npatients, and, above all, for their friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimulant Appendicitis.--Some of these abdominal psycho-neuroses may\r\nsimulate serious pathological conditions that, in recent years, have\r\ncome to be looked upon as surgical. I have seen a number of cases,\r\nespecially in women who have been constipated for some time, in which\r\nthere was considerable discomfort in the right lower abdominal segment\r\nand occasionally surgeons thought that an operation should be\r\nperformed. Usually in these cases there is no localized tenderness and\r\nno mass of any kind to be felt in this region. Sometimes tenderness is\r\ncomplained of, though when the patient's attention is diverted even\r\ndeep pressure may be made without their wincing. Whenever there is no\r\nhistory of an acute attack, no temperature and no increase in pulse\r\nrate, unless there are very definitely localized symptoms, the\r\nquestion of operation is always to be answered in the negative.\r\nDisturbances of the pulse may mean little. The history must guide. I\r\nhave seen these cases operated on, improved for a while, but relapse\r\nafterwards just as soon as there was a resumption of their\r\nconstipation. As a rule, when the appendix has been removed, either\r\nbecause its function has something to do with the inhibition of\r\nputrefactive processes in the lower bowel, or because as the result of\r\nthe operation and consequent adhesions, the colon was not so active in\r\nits peristalsis, the constipation seemed to be worse than before,\r\nunless special care was exercised. If there is relapse after an\r\noperation the patients' attacks are almost sure to be more frequent\r\nthan before and their discomfort likely to be more pronounced.\r\n\r\nLest it be thought that such cases are mainly confined to women or\r\nthat the most striking cases occur only in women, I may say that the\r\nmost interesting case of this kind I ever saw was in a young, vigorous\r\nGerman soldier. He was admitted to Koenig's clinic in Berlin with a\r\nstory of abdominal tenderness and pain, the tenderness being located\r\nin the right iliac region. There seemed even to be some distention of\r\nthe abdomen after a time and the development of greatly increased\r\ndiffuse tenderness. The pulse was considerably disturbed, but there\r\nwas only a slight rise in temperature, and for a time it was thought\r\nthat this might be a case of appendicitis without fever. A surprising\r\nfeature of the case was the presence in the right iliac region of\r\n{588} a scar which, on careful investigation, proved to be double.\r\nApparently the patient had been opened twice before in this region.\r\nHis history was carefully investigated. He had had a fall from a horse\r\nabout two years before and afterwards had considerable abdominal\r\ndiscomfort. He was quite sure that something serious had happened\r\nwithin his abdominal cavity as the result of the fall and his\r\nattention was concentrated on his right iliac region. At the time of\r\nthe accident his symptoms were considered to be a psycho-neurosis or\r\nperhaps an exaggeration of symptoms with malingering tendencies.\r\n\r\nShortly after his term of service expired, however, some acute\r\nsymptoms developed and there was swelling, or at least tympanitic\r\ndistention of the abdomen with disturbance of the pulse, and he was\r\noperated on in the hospital and his appendix removed. There proved to\r\nbe nothing the matter with it and no pathological condition was found\r\nwithin his abdomen. He seemed to recover completely. After six months\r\nhe was admitted to another hospital with the same symptoms. He seemed\r\nto have the habit of swallowing air which found its way beyond his\r\npylorus, or else gas leaked from the blood vessels in the walls of his\r\nintestines, producing a symptom-complex not unlike the tympanitic\r\ndistention consequent upon general peritonitis. Once more this was\r\ntaken to mean very probably a ruptured appendix and another operation\r\nwas done. This operator went through the old scar, but to his surprise\r\nfound no appendix and found everything within the abdomen normal. The\r\nthird time the patient came to Koenig's clinic and, owing to his\r\nmilitary record, his hospital experience was available and a third\r\noperation was not done. Instead, according to the story current at the\r\ntime, the patient was tattooed with the legend \"no appendix here.\" The\r\ncase is interesting as an example of the extent to which an abdominal\r\npsycho-neurosis may simulate a ruptured appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudo Biliary Colic.--A similar state of affairs to that with regard\r\nto the appendix has developed in all that concerns the gall bladder\r\nand the biliary tract generally. Any complaint of discomfort in the\r\nright upper quadrant of the abdomen, if persisted in, is almost sure\r\nsooner or later to be diagnosed as due to a calculus. Now that\r\noperations for gallstones are more common than they used to be, it is\r\nprobable that almost as many gall bladders are found without\r\npathological conditions as appendices without justifiably operative\r\nlesions. In treating individuals who have a history of recurrent\r\nsymptoms of intestinal reaction to various foods complicated by\r\nurticaria, it is important to remember that there may probably be\r\nlesions corresponding to those in the skin in portions of the\r\nintestinal tract which may functionally involve either the appendix or\r\nthe biliary passages. Some of these cases are extremely difficult to\r\nhandle because often there is pain, definite tenderness and some fever\r\nwith the attacks, and very localized symptoms. The history, however,\r\nwill be helpful. Operation will not relieve the patient from liability\r\nto recurrence. There are, however, other cases where the discomfort is\r\nmuch more vague, where there is no tenderness, no disturbance after\r\njolting rides and where there has never been any severe pain. These\r\nshould not be set down as biliary calculi without further\r\ndevelopments. The possibility of a stone being present should not be\r\nhinted to the patient until some definite pathognomonic sign is\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Simulated Conditions.--There are many painful conditions of the\r\n{589} head that are psycho-neurotic. Many forms of headache are due to\r\nsensations of pressure or tension or constriction, usually in the\r\nexternal integuments of the skull, which are dwelt on and then become\r\npainful achy conditions. This is particularly true of so-called\r\nheadaches in the back of the head. As we emphasize in the chapter on\r\nHeadache, probably most of the headaches of patients who have not much\r\nto occupy themselves with, are due rather to queer feelings in the\r\nhead emphasized by the concentration of attention on them than to real\r\npains. Earache may occur in the same way. Nearly always when one has\r\nbeen out in the wind, there is likely to be an uncomfortable sensation\r\nin the ear. By attention to it this may readily be exaggerated into an\r\nearache. Occasionally the physical basis of an ache in the region of\r\nthe ear seems to be an unconscious performance of Valsalva's\r\nexperiment while blowing the nose when catarrhal conditions are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of painful conditions of the arms and legs may develop in\r\nthe same way. Unusual tiredness, or some special exertion of the\r\nmuscles, may produce a sense of fatigue readily exaggerated by\r\nattention to it, into severe pain. This condition is not a voluntary\r\nsimulation, but is due to lack of diversion and a certain inborn\r\ntendency in these people to pay attention to anything that is the\r\nmatter with them. Very seldom does the physical condition need much\r\ntreatment, though nearly always something can be done for it with\r\nadvantage, but the mental state needs alteration and, above all, the\r\npatient needs to be diverted from over-concentration of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotor Neuroses.--As has been said, beside painful conditions, various\r\nforms of motor trouble may develop. These usually consist of inability\r\nto move certain groups of muscles. They have sometimes been spoken of\r\nas hysterical palsies or paralyses. The word hysterical, by its\r\nderivation connected with the Greek word for womb, apparently\r\nindicates that these conditions are limited to women. It is well known\r\nnow that they are extremely common among men and especially among\r\nyoung men and have absolutely nothing to do with the genital system.\r\nAs with painful psycho-neurotic conditions, there is practically\r\nalways a physical basis. This sometimes requires careful questioning\r\nto locate exactly. There is some injury of the muscles of a particular\r\nregion, or some over-use of them, or some employment of them under bad\r\nmechanical conditions with over-fatigue, and then attention to this\r\nleads to incapacity to use the muscles or inability to co-ordinate\r\nthem properly.\r\n\r\nNeurotic palsies, to use a term that carries much less unfavorable\r\nsuggestion with it than the word paralysis or the word hysterical, may\r\noccur in any limb or group of muscles. They may occur in the legs with\r\nthe production of complete paraplegia. One well-known form,\r\nastasia-abasia, inability to stand or to walk, affects the muscles of\r\nthe trunk as well as of the lower limbs. These conditions often remain\r\nfor long periods in spite of treatment, frequently recur, are often\r\ncalled by all sorts of names and continue to be a source of annoyance\r\nto the patient, until a definite successful effort is made to change\r\nthe patient's mental state to one of less attention to the particular\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThere is, it seems to me, an unfortunate tendency to think that our\r\nobservations upon these cases are comparatively recent. Sir Benjamin\r\nBrodie, nearly a century ago, insisted that at least four-fifths of\r\nthe female patients among the higher classes of society supposed to\r\nsuffer from diseased joints were really sufferers from neurotic\r\nconditions, or, as they called them then, {590} hysteria. Sir James\r\nPaget, in his Clinical Lectures and Essays, thinks that Brodie has\r\nexaggerated the proportion, for in his own practice, though, of\r\ncourse, he includes his hospital cases and the poor as well as the\r\nrich, he found less than one-fifth suffering from neurotic joints. The\r\nhip and the knee, which are the most frequent seats of genuine\r\npathological conditions, are also most frequently the subject of\r\nneuroses. Next in order, but much more rarely, the metatarsal and\r\nmetacarpal joints are affected and then the elbow and shoulder. In Sir\r\nJames Paget's chapter on Nervous Mimicry or Neuro-Mimesis, he cites a\r\nnumber of cases which show how clearly psycho-neurotic affections were\r\nrecognized in his time. He tells the story of a young man who had been\r\noverworking for examinations and who \"after a three-hours'\r\nmathematical cram, fainted and when he rallied set up a very close\r\nmimicry of paraplegia which lasted many weeks.\" He insists that \"such\r\nmimicry is found not only or chiefly in the silly selfish girls among\r\nwhom it is commonly supposed that hysteria is rife, but even among the\r\nwise and accomplished, both men and women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the differential diagnosis of psycho-neuroses from definite\r\norganic conditions, the most important element is the patient's\r\nprevious history and a knowledge of the condition of the nervous\r\nsystem. Where this is known the diagnosis is comparatively easy, but\r\nwhen the patient is seen for the first time it may often be extremely\r\ndifficult. It is, above all, important not to jump to conclusions, for\r\nevery nervous specialist knows of cases in which the diagnosis was\r\nconsidered to be surely a neurosis, yet a fatal termination showed\r\nthat a serious organic condition was at work. It must not be forgotten\r\neither that neurotic patients may develop serious organic disease in\r\nthe midst of their neurotic symptoms and care must be taken not to\r\nmiss the significance of special symptoms. When the patient is not\r\nwell known, the presence of certain stigmata, as they have been\r\ncalled, enable the physician to recognize the probability that a\r\nneurotic condition is present. Patients who are subject to neuroses\r\nare likely to have certain areas of the skin surface and of the\r\npalpable mucous membranes more or less sensitive than normal. There\r\nare likely to be spots of hyperesthesia or hypesthesia or even\r\ncomplete anesthesia somewhere on the skin. These should be carefully\r\nlooked for and in serious cases an examination of the whole skin\r\nsurface should be made. Not infrequently anesthesia or a decided lack\r\nof sensitiveness to irritation will be found in the throat or in the\r\nnose. Occasionally the conjunctiva is much less sensitive than usual.\r\n\r\nThese used to be called hysterical stigmata. The word hysteria carries\r\nan innuendo of imaginativeness or occasionally of affection of the\r\nsexual organs that is unfortunate. It would be better, therefore, not\r\nto use the term in any way. The presence of these areas of\r\nhyperesthesia, hypesthesia and anesthesia indicates that association\r\nfibers are abnormally connected in the brain for the moment at least,\r\nand that as a consequence there is over-attention to certain portions\r\nof the body with lack of ordinary attention to others. This will\r\naccount very readily for the occurrence of painful conditions in\r\ncertain cases and palsies in others. When over-attention is paid,\r\nthere may be a {591} hyperesthesia corresponding to that seen in the\r\nskin in any organ of the body. When, for any reason, there is a\r\ndisturbance in a particular part, there may be a lack of motility due\r\nto nervous influences, just as there is a lack of sensation. In all of\r\nthese cases the one essential element is to correct the nervous state\r\nthrough the mind as far as possible. Experience has shown that this\r\ncan be done in nearly all cases. It must be the principal effort of\r\nthe physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong Mental Impression.--In the treatment of these affections two\r\nperiods are to be considered, one during, the other after the attacks.\r\nDuring the attack a strong impression must be made upon the patient's\r\nmind so as to divert the concentrated attention. We have well\r\nauthenticated stories of the various expedients resorted to by\r\nphysicians who were confident of their diagnosis in order to secure\r\nsuch a strong mental impression. I once knew an old physician who was\r\nsummoned to a childless wife whose adoring husband was in manifest\r\nagonies of solicitude over her and whose mother and mother-in-law had\r\nbeen caring for her for days with all anxiety, walk into the room of\r\nthe patient, take one of her hands in his, slap her on the cheek, tell\r\nher to get up and walk and she would have no more of that supposed\r\ninability to walk which had caused the family so much anxiety. He\r\nsucceeded. It can be imagined what would have happened had he not\r\nsucceeded. We know of cases where an alarm of fire or a burglar scare\r\nor some sudden emotion has produced a like result. We cannot prescribe\r\nthese things, however, and at the most, after one or two successes in\r\na particular patient, they would fail.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that we can do as a routine practice is to relieve by\r\ndirect treatment the slight physical condition that is usually present\r\nand then try and influence the patient's mind. If a thorough\r\nexamination is made in the course of which the physician is able to\r\nshow the patient that he understands the condition and that he can\r\ndemonstrate for himself and them that there is nothing serious the\r\nmatter with important organs, he can make them feel that their pain or\r\ndisability is entirely due to concentration of attention on a\r\nparticular nerve or set of nerves. With many patients this will\r\nsucceed, not at once, but after two or three seances of positive\r\nsuggestion, even in the waking state. If the patients are bothering\r\ntheir relatives very much it may be necessary to give some opium as an\r\nadjuvant. As a rule, the needle had better not be used, but a\r\nsuppository given. This is not nearly so attractive to the patient's\r\nmind as the use of the needle and is not likely to be called for so\r\noften. Every physician has had the experience that after giving opium\r\ntwo or three times, either per rectum or hypodermically, almost\r\nanything can be given, provided the patient is persuaded that the drug\r\nis being given again. A reasonably large dose may be used the first\r\ntime, but certainly after the second or third time a much smaller dose\r\nwill produce the same effect and often a simple gluten suppository,\r\nprovided it looks like the other, will work just as well as an opium\r\nsuppository.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Treatment.--The after treatment of these cases is directed\r\nmainly to such alterations of the mental attitude and physical\r\ncondition as shall prevent {592} recurrences. The general condition of\r\nthe patient must be improved in every case where there is indication\r\nfor this. Many of these patients are under weight for their height.\r\nThey must put on weight. Weir Mitchell's success with the \"rest cure\"\r\nconsisted to a great extent in his power to cause these patients to\r\nput on weight. This supplies reserve energy, but, above all, replaces\r\ndiscouragement by hope and buoyancy. Gain in weight can be\r\naccomplished mainly by two methods. First, by seeing that the patient\r\ngets an abundance of air and, secondly, by dictating how much shall be\r\neaten. In this matter details are important and it may be necessary to\r\nsuggest the actual diet for each meal. This must be liberal and must\r\nconsist of simple but particularly nutritious materials. Patients'\r\ndislikes need not be taken into much account, their likes are often\r\nhelpful. When there is insistence on lack of appetite and decided\r\nobjection to chewing, eggs and milk should be given in increasing\r\nquantities, until five or six eggs and some twelve glasses of milk are\r\ntaken every day. Besides this, a good portion of meat should be eaten\r\nat one meal with some vegetables. By firm insistence, day after day,\r\nit will not be hard to get patients whose appetites are seriously\r\ninhibited to take this amount of food. To secure this, a good, firm,\r\nsensible nurse is invaluable. Appetite, as we have emphasized in the\r\nchapter on Appetite, is largely a matter of will, and anything that is\r\neaten, provided it stays down, will do good unless there is organic\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of exercise is important in these cases, but not\r\nnearly so important as an abundance of fresh air. Patients must not be\r\nallowed to overtire themselves. Riding in an open carriage or on the\r\ntop of a bus, especially where there are distracting scenes and many\r\nhuman interests, is particularly beneficial. Automobiling is often\r\nlikely to be more tiresome than is good for these patients when they\r\nare run down, though it is one of the best of therapeutic measures for\r\nthose who are physically capable, that is, up to weight, even though\r\nthey may complain of feeling weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diversion of Mind_.--It is in these cases particularly that diversion\r\nof mind is of prime importance. Many of these patients have either no\r\nserious interest or at most certain interests with which they may\r\noccupy themselves if they wish, but that are not engrossing and\r\nattention to which may be put off whenever they care to. Duties that\r\nare inevitable and that call for the occupation of so much time that\r\nthe patient has little opportunity to think of herself are often the\r\nsalvation of these patients. As I mention in the chapters on\r\nOccupation and Diversion of Mind, I have seen a number of cases and I\r\nam sure that every physician of reasonable large experience has seen\r\nsimilar cases, where women, particularly, who in the midst of\r\nprosperity have been constantly suffering from some form of\r\npsycho-neurosis, great or small, have, after some sudden turn of\r\nfortune, been completely relieved from their nervous symptoms by\r\nhaving to devote themselves seriously to some occupation for a\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nOccupation, particularly with children, with the weak and the ailing,\r\nwith the poor and those who are unable to help themselves, is\r\nspecially likely to be helpful to such patients when they are women.\r\nSuch interests affect them deeply and by the sympathy they arouse\r\nthrough contact with real physical suffering, they prevent\r\nover-attention to themselves. I have seen the care of a cancer\r\npatient, and especially of a relative affected by cancer, do more for\r\n{593} a psycho-neurotic sufferer than all that doctors had been able\r\nto accomplish in years. It is often difficult to find occupation and\r\ndiversion of mind for these patients, but this is the therapeutic\r\nproblem the physician must solve if he is going to secure relief from\r\npresent conditions and prophylaxis against further attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOldtime Cures.--Many of the remedies for obscure abdominal conditions\r\nshow how well the real character of the affection was duly recognized\r\nand appreciated in the past. It is in these cases particularly that\r\nthe pillulae micarumpanis, the bread pills, of the olden times, were\r\nso commonly used with good effect. We have quoted examples in other\r\nchapters. Many of the drugs that are employed with reported success\r\nfor these affections have a strong suggestive element in them.\r\nValerian probably is a good tonic and yet there is no doubt that the\r\nsuggestive quality of its nauseating smell and the almost inevitable\r\neructations that occur after to emphasize it, are helpful in curing\r\ncertain internal psycho-neuroses. Another drug that has been much used\r\nin the same way is asafetida, whose disgusting taste and odor have\r\nbeen excellent auxiliaries. Fresh pills of quinine and red pepper\r\nuncoated and therefore producing definite effects on the taste before\r\nswallowing and on the mucous membrane of the stomach after swallowing,\r\noften prove the best remedy for persistent vomiting or for enduring\r\nnausea. A drop of nux vomica, taken every half hour with the definite\r\nwarning that the patient must by no means take more, and that the\r\nbottle must be carefully protected lest anyone else should be\r\npoisoned, is often very efficient. These remedies have a slight\r\nphysiological action and a large psychic action, but that exactly\r\ncorresponds with the etiology of the affection for whose treatment\r\nthey are employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDominant Ideas.--During the attack it is often possible to find either\r\nfrom the patient or from friends that there is some dominant idea\r\nwhich is bringing about the mental short-circuiting that leads to the\r\nconcentration of attention. From the oldest times it has been\r\nrecognized that in young women a disappointment in love may prove to\r\nbe the occasion for a psycho-neurotic or, as they used to call it,\r\nhysterical attack. This is, however, not a specific cause. It is the\r\ndisappointment much more than the sex element in the case, as a rule,\r\nthat produces the unfavorable effect. It was easy to conclude that the\r\nsex factor was extremely important in older times when women's sphere\r\nof activity was largely limited to the home, and marriage was the one\r\nlegitimate object of their ambition. Now that we have had more\r\nexperience with the business woman, we know that serious\r\ndisappointments of any kind have a tendency to initiate\r\npsycho-neurotic conditions in susceptible and especially suggestive\r\nindividuals. A failure to secure promotion in a store, or to secure\r\nsome position that is eagerly sought for, a loss of money in business,\r\netc., especially when they have been preceded by weeks or months of\r\nsolicitude and worry over the event that now happens, may lead to the\r\ndevelopment of a psycho-neurosis.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly notable with regard to educational interests of\r\nvarious kinds. Young women readily overdo application to study, or,\r\nrather, anxiety over it, and as a result get into a state of mind in\r\nwhich a failure to pass an examination, or to secure promotion, or\r\neven the failure to win a prize, may give rise to a highly nervous\r\ncondition in which tears and laughter come unbidden and in {594} which\r\nfurther developments may bring on a typical psycho-neurotic attack.\r\nAll sorts of pains and aches and motor incapacities may occur in these\r\nstates. The supreme occupation with the single idea present in their\r\nminds at all times, waking and sleeping, while they try to study, or\r\nwhen they read or even when they are supposed to be diverting\r\nthemselves, finally precipitates a nervous explosion along nerves that\r\nhave been irritated for some reason, though the pathological condition\r\npresent may be quite insufficient of itself to explain the affection\r\nthat ensues. These are the popular nervous breakdowns, not difficult\r\nto treat once their real character is diagnosed.\r\n\r\nSorrows of various kinds may produce a like effect. Worry or anxiety\r\nabout the serious illness of a near relative, especially an inevitably\r\nfatal illness, such as cancer or tuberculosis or the disturbing mental\r\naffections, may have a similar result, but usually not in those who\r\nare occupied with the actual care of the patients. The mental states\r\nconstitute the psychic elements underlying the neurotic condition that\r\ndevelops.\r\n\r\nAlmost needless to say, successful treatment must include a faithful\r\nattempt to lessen the significance of the mental state that is so\r\nimportant in the case. Usually the mere obtaining of the patient's\r\nconfidence is enough to lessen greatly the irritation produced by the\r\nmental condition. A sorrow shared is halved. It is, above all,\r\nsecretive individuals who become depressed over their sorrows. While\r\nthe patient who insists on constantly sharing them with everyone\r\nbecomes a nuisance, it is always a little dangerous not to have a\r\nconfidant to whom worries and anxieties are entrusted. If they are\r\nkept to one's self they are nearly always exaggerated--they are seen\r\nout of proper perspective and have a much more depressing influence.\r\nCalm, judicious reasoning with the patient over the significance of\r\nthe condition as presented, is often of great help.\r\n\r\nOften these ideas, so potent for mental and bodily disturbance, are\r\nalmost entirely unconscious or exist in the patient's subconsciousness\r\nand are recalled only under such special conditions as remove the\r\nbonds of the patient's occupation with himself or herself at the\r\npresent time and allow memories to come back without interference.\r\nThere are many curious stories of such cases. A child is frightened or\r\nvery much disturbed by having a cat kill a favorite bird. The cat\r\nbecomes a deterrent object. Gradually this deterrence grows. As a\r\nconsequence, there may develop one of those intense dreads of cats\r\nwhich makes life miserable if near that animal. There may even be\r\nphysical effects produced by the continued presence of a cat in the\r\nsame room. Often in these cases the beginning of this mental attitude,\r\nor at least its occasion in the incident of the killing of the bird is\r\nforgotten, or at least not consciously referred to as an etiological\r\nelement in the dread.\r\n\r\nPatients have been known to develop states of mind which made them\r\nobject to certain figures or names because of earlier associations\r\nwith them that were unpleasant. There is the story of a man who would\r\nnever take a car with an odd number though this was sometimes a source\r\nof annoyance and delay and who could not explain to himself or his\r\nphysician how this objection had developed, until his memory was\r\nsearched and it was found that, years before, he had witnessed the\r\ndeath of a child under the wheels of a car with an odd number. He had\r\ncompletely lost the sense of the direct influence of this, but it\r\nexisted in subconscious memory and proved the source of much {595}\r\nannoyance to him, for if with a friend he were not able to avoid\r\ntaking an odd numbered car he would feel quite miserable during the\r\nride. Frights of various kinds may produce this same effect. I have in\r\nmy notes the case of a man who is unable to sleep at night without a\r\nlight in his room, because of a fright. Once while asleep in the dark,\r\nhe awoke conscious that someone was in the room and sat up and\r\ndemanded who was there. The answer was a revolver shot and a bullet,\r\npassing not far away from him, pierced the head of the bed. As he sank\r\nback the burglar leaped from the window and escaped. He realized that\r\nthis was the cause of his fear of the dark, but lesser incidents might\r\neasily become subconscious yet continue their influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsycho-Analysis.--In recent years Freud has suggested that in many\r\npuzzling cases of psycho-neurosis, where, so far as is known, there\r\nseems to be no dominant idea bringing about the concentration of\r\nattention, careful analysis of the patients' memories will bring out\r\nthe fact that there is a subconscious idea as the underlying\r\nsubstratum of these affections. Freud has developed what is called the\r\nprocess of psycho-analysis in order to bring out these ideas which are\r\nsometimes exerting their influence unconsciously to the patient. The\r\nsubconscious is one of the fads of the hour, so that Freud's\r\nannouncement attracted much attention. Psycho-analysis, however, is\r\nnot advanced so confidently even by its inventor as a positively\r\ncurative measure, as it was at the beginning. It has been found that\r\nafter the dominant idea in the subconsciousness has been found and\r\nneutralized with a consequent amelioration of the psycho-neurotic\r\nsymptoms, there may be a relapse, when another dominant idea will have\r\nto be found, and that there seems to be the possibility, in some cases\r\nat least, of an almost endless succession of such ideas to account for\r\nfurther and further relapses.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly psycho-analysis has its place in psychotherapy and is of\r\ngreat value in certain cases. There is no doubt, however, in my mind\r\nthat in most of these cases reported as cured after psycho-analytic\r\nmethods had been employed, what really happened is that the patient's\r\nmind became diverted to another idea--that of marvelous cure through\r\nmind searching which relieved the previous concentration of mind\r\nunderlying the psycho-neurosis. These are the cases that used to be\r\ncured by hypnotism. Before hypnotism was developed they were cured by\r\nmesmerism. Before mesmerism they were cured by magnets or by the\r\nLeyden jar, and during the past century they have been cured by\r\nelectrical methods or by osteopathy or by Eddyism. Many of the cures\r\nwere effected by stroking and touches, the use of Perkins' tractors,\r\nor Greatrakes' methods, or anything else that attracted attention very\r\nstrongly. They were given a new idea which occupied them very much and\r\nso saved them from that preoccupation with themselves and their\r\nfeelings and whatever slight ailment might be present that was the\r\nphysical occasion for psycho-neurotic symptoms. This happened with\r\npsycho-analysis. When it was absolutely new and the operator had great\r\nconfidence in it, this confidence was imparted to the patients, with\r\nthe consequent cure or decided amelioration of their psycho-neurosis,\r\njust as that used to be brought about by our previous method of\r\ntreating such cases by some strong suggestion.\r\n\r\nAs I emphasize in the chapter on Dreams, the examination of the dreams\r\nin order to get a hint of the dominant idea, is particularly\r\ninteresting, because it represents a return to the oldest methods of\r\nsuggestion of which we have record. {596} The fact that sexual ideas\r\nseem to represent a great many of the dominant ideas in these cases is\r\nof interest for a similar reason. It represents the tendency\r\nconstantly recurring to refer most nervous ailments, as indeed most\r\nother ailments, to something pathological in the sexual or genital\r\nsphere. The old idea embodied in the word hysterical exemplifies this\r\nvery well. The \"vapors\" or \"tantrums\" or fits which were supposed to\r\nbe due, to some extent at least, to suppressed sexuality by medical\r\nwriters of three or four generations ago, have come back to us under\r\nanother form and with other terms. Psycho-analysis gives occasion for\r\ninstruction in so far as it helps the patient to get rid of old\r\npersuasions and exploded ideas as to disease and diet and the various\r\nfunctions of the body and the mind that have often almost\r\nunconsciously been acquired and secured a dominance. It is surprising\r\nhow often it will be found that people are taking too much or too\r\nlittle water at meals, too many or too few vegetables, too much or too\r\nlittle of salt or of other condiments as the result of habits and\r\nnotions acquired when they were young and under influences that they\r\nmay now forget. In the same way habits of life with regard to bathing,\r\nclothing and the like may be the source of unfavorable conditions in\r\nmind and body that need only to be discovered to be corrected. Their\r\ncorrection will often bring about the relief of symptomatic conditions\r\nthat have proved quite obstinate to treatment. We have emphasized this\r\nin the chapters on the Individual Patient and the necessity for\r\nacquiring just as much knowledge as possible about both his\r\noccupations and his mental attitude in order to be able successfully\r\nto treat chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n{597}\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII\r\n\r\n_DISORDERS OF MIND_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMENTAL INCAPACITY (PSYCHASTHENIA)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have come to realize that many of the so-called\r\nnervous diseases, or if they do not deserve the serious name of\r\ndisease, nervous symptom-complexes, are really due to a deficiency of\r\nvital energy. Some people have a store of energy that enables them to\r\naccomplish many different things successfully. Some become exhausted\r\nfrom a few trivial occupations. What is noteworthy in the cases to be\r\ndiscussed in this chapter is that they show always certain symptoms of\r\nmental tiredness or, at least, of lack of capacity for affairs.\r\nPatients complain, for instance, that they cannot make up their minds\r\nso as to reach decisions because they doubt so much whether the\r\ndecision they come to will be right or wrong. Others dread the outcome\r\nof any and every act and feel that something is hanging over them.\r\nSlight sources of irritation become so exaggerated by thinking about\r\nthem and dwelling on their possibilities that they may even disturb\r\nsleep and appetite and, as a consequence, the general health. Fears\r\ncome over patients lest various things should happen and they dread\r\nmicrobes, or infections, or dirt in general, or the approach of\r\ninsanity, and all to such a degree as to incapacitate them for their\r\nordinary occupations.\r\n\r\nMany of these patients become quite incapable of willing effectively.\r\nThey not only lose initiative, the power to undertake new enterprises,\r\nbut they find it difficult to make up their minds as to details of the\r\nordinary affairs of life. As we have stated elsewhere in Professor\r\nGrasset's expressive formula, these patients say that they cannot do\r\nthings, their friends say \"they will not,\" and the physician, taking\r\nthe middle course, which, as usual in human affairs, has much more of\r\ntruth than either of the extremes, says \"they cannot will.\"\r\n\r\nFor these states Janet of Paris suggested the word psychasthenia. It\r\nis formed on the model of the word neurasthenia and unless it is used\r\nwith discretion will have all the objections that attach to that other\r\nterm. Above all, it shares the tendency pointed out by Sir William\r\nGowers with regard to neurasthenia of being \"too satisfying. Men are\r\napt to rest on it as they would not on its English equivalent.\r\nPhysicians, if they do not actually think that they have found the\r\nmalady from which the patient is suffering, have an influence exerted\r\non them of which they are often unconscious, which lessens the\r\ntendency to go farther in the search for the whole mental state.\" Much\r\nmore can be said in defence of psychasthenia, however, than of\r\nneurasthenia, for the substitution for it of the translation of the\r\nGreek words of {598} which it is composed--\"mind weakness\" would be\r\nalarming. While it is important, then, to realize that the term may\r\neasily be made too general and prove, as such words as rheumatism has\r\ndone in our time and malaria did in the past, a cloak for ignorance\r\nand an excuse for incomplete investigation for diagnostic purposes, it\r\nrepresents a satisfactory answer to the patient's question as to what\r\nis the matter without committing the physician to such definitely\r\ndetailed opinions as to the patient's condition as would surely prove\r\nunfavorably suggestive.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychasthenia, Natural and Acquired.--There are two forms of the\r\nmental incapacity that underlies many of the curious symptom-complexes\r\nthat have been studied under the term psychasthenia. One is natural,\r\nthat is, inherent in the special character of the individual, and the\r\nother acquired through disease or exhausting labor, worry, or anxiety.\r\nSome people are born without sufficient mental energy to do the work\r\nthey attempt to accomplish. This is true, also, in the physical order.\r\nIt is often pitiable to see young men who have not the physical\r\nstrength necessary for athletic exercises, or the dexterity required\r\nfor them, faithfully trying to accomplish by effort what others do\r\nwith ease. When there is some natural defect in the way they will\r\nusually fail, no matter how much they strive. Just in the same way\r\nsome persons are not able to accomplish certain more serious purposes\r\nrequiring special mental ability or power which they attempt. Their\r\nbrothers, their friends, their schoolmates, may have the ability, and\r\nthey cannot understand why they should not have it, but the fact\r\nremains that they are not possessed of it and if they try to make up\r\nfor this defect by overwork they simply break down.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential Diagnosis.--Each of the two forms of mental incapacity,\r\ncongenital and acquired, must be carefully differentiated and treated\r\nfrom a special standpoint. With regard to congenital lack of mental\r\ncontrol, all that the doctor can do is to counsel against the\r\nassumption of duties and responsibilities that are too heavy for the\r\npatient. Some people have not enough nervous energy to run a business\r\nwith many details, and some even find it difficult to try to do things\r\ninvolving much less responsibility. There is no use for a man five\r\nfeet in height, weighing one hundred pounds, to try to be a stevedore.\r\nThere is no use for men of delicate muscular build to try to make\r\ntheir living at heavy manual labor; they simply wear themselves out in\r\na very short time. This inadaptability is recognized at once. Just the\r\nsame thing is true with regard to many nervous systems, but the\r\nrecognition is not so easy or immediate. Some cannot stand the strain\r\nof intricate business details or the burden of responsibility in\r\nimportant transactions. They must be taught to be satisfied, then,\r\nwith quiet simple lives without what is for them, excessive\r\nresponsibility and without strenuous business worries. A country life\r\nwith regular hours, plenty of open air and as little responsibility as\r\npossible, is the ideal for them.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult problem in this matter is the question of\r\ndiagnosis. As a rule, the history is the most helpful for this. The\r\npatient tells of having found difficulty all his life whenever\r\nanything of special significance was placed on his shoulders. He is\r\none of those who were born tired and remain so all their lives. It has\r\nbeen the custom to blame these people; they are rather to be pitied.\r\nIf they are born in circumstances that allow of their {599} living\r\nquietly in the country, they accomplish a certain amount of work quite\r\nsuccessfully and live happy, contented lives. If they are born in the\r\ncity where the hurry and bustle around them and the insistence of\r\nfriends that they must take up responsibilities becomes poignant, they\r\nget discouraged and even despondent. It is from this class of patients\r\nthat the \"ne'er-do-wells\" of modern life are recruited. They form the\r\nunder-stratum of trampdom, the scions of good families with the\r\nwanderlust, the willing but incapable. Certain of them become vicious\r\nand criminal, either because they do not want to work or because their\r\nmentality is perverted in some way. Such patients cannot be treated\r\nwith any hope of their becoming successful exemplars of the strenuous\r\nlife, but they may be directed into the less exacting occupations of\r\ncountry life and so live quiet, useful and happy lives. For the\r\ncongenital class we can do little except to prevent them from trying\r\nto do things that are beyond their mental capacity and helping them to\r\nsee just what their limitations are.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Exhaustion_.--Many disturbances of mental energy are acquired.\r\nThese may be either functional or organic. For the organic variety we\r\ncannot do much, since it is dependent on changes in organs that are\r\npermanent. We can, however, usually predispose the patient's mind to\r\nthe recognition of the fact that he should no longer try to devote\r\nhimself to occupations that constitute a special drain on his nervous\r\nenergy. The man, for instance, who is already suffering from\r\narterio-sclerosis must be warned that worry and work will surely\r\nhasten the process and that his nervous symptoms cannot be cured, but\r\nmust be palliated. He must be advised to lessen his mental strain and\r\nto take up something which, while occupying his mind, does not make\r\ninsistent calls on his vitality. In this matter it must be remembered\r\nthat when a man over fifty develops nervous symptoms, as a rule there\r\nis no question of functional trouble but of organic change and usually\r\nheart or arteries or kidneys are at fault.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have come to realize that typhoid fever often makes\r\nserious inroads upon a patient's vitality which can only be retrieved\r\nby care, not alone for some months but, if possible, even for some\r\nyears, not to put an overstrain on the vital energy. Certain other\r\ndiseases produce an even more lasting effect. A sufferer from\r\nwell-developed tuberculosis will probably never be able to go back to\r\nthe strenuous city life. If he attempts to do so, not only is there\r\ndanger of a recurrence of his tuberculosis, but there may even be a\r\ndevelopment of neurotic symptoms. Syphilis is another disease that\r\nleaves patients in a condition in which it is dangerous for them to\r\nassume the serious responsibilities of an exacting occupation and\r\nespecially anything that involves excitement and worry. Syphilitic\r\npatients should be warned of the danger of pursuing vocations that\r\nmake such demands upon them. It is the actor, the broker, the\r\nspeculator, and the strenuous business man generally, who is likely to\r\nsuffer from parasyphilitic conditions, tabes, paresis and the like,\r\nmuch more than those who follow occupations that make less demands on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctional Mental Incapacity.--In a large number of cases the\r\nincapacity to do things because of lack of mental energy is due to\r\nfunctional disturbances of the nervous system. These are the most\r\nimportant for the psycho-therapeutist because much can be accomplished\r\nfor them. Nearly always the patient can be benefited by advice and\r\nsuggestion, and very often some {600} unfavorable factor at work,\r\nusing up his mental energy to no purpose, will be discovered. In order\r\nto do good, however, careful study of the individual patient is the\r\nmost important element. The most frequent functional disturbance of\r\nthe nervous system, leading to exhaustion of mental energy, is\r\nover-attention to one's self and to one's occupations. Men can do many\r\ncomplicated things quite naturally and easily, but when they carefully\r\nwatch themselves doing them, accomplishment is not so ready and the\r\ntask is double. They tire much easier, for, as a rule, what they are\r\ndoing could be accomplished automatically and they are using up energy\r\nattending to it. This is probably one of the commonest causes for the\r\nrather frequent development of that state called nervous exhaustion in\r\nour time. People watch themselves too closely and by so doing they not\r\nonly use up energy unnecessarily in the surveillance, but also they\r\nhamper their powers to do things and so consume additional energy in\r\novercoming this inhibition.\r\n\r\nMorbidly introspective people watch almost ceaselessly everything they\r\ndo. They not only watch themselves work and worry about it, but they\r\nwatch themselves play and grow solicitous that it will do them good;\r\nthey watch themselves divert themselves to see if it is giving them\r\nreal recreation and so spoil the diversion; they watch themselves eat\r\nand disturb their appetite, and watch themselves digest and hamper\r\ndigestion; they even try at least to watch themselves sleep and so\r\ninterfere with sleep. Many of the cases of insomnia are really due to\r\nthis over-attention. They fear they will not sleep, they worry about\r\nit, they keep themselves awake hoping that they will sleep, and in the\r\nmore serious cases even during sleep itself they are so solicitous\r\nthat their dreams become very vivid and a form of unconscious\r\ncerebration goes on with surveillance of themselves. They do not rest\r\neven in sleep. They wake feeling not rested, they get up with a\r\nconsciousness that they are beginning a long day without being\r\nproperly refreshed and they exhaust enough energy to complete a good\r\npart of the day's work in wondering whether they will be able to go on\r\nwith their occupation for the day, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inhibitory Surveillance_.--People become afraid that they cannot or\r\nthat they may not do things well and set a guard over themselves. This\r\nis illustrated very well in the doubts about accomplishment because of\r\nwhich they keep going back to see what they have done and how it was\r\ndone, though usually it was accomplished quite well without any\r\nconscious attention. Dreads form another phase of this attitude of\r\nmind. For those who are affected with them they make a thing hard to\r\ndo before it is begun, and harder to accomplish after it has been\r\nentered upon because of the suggestion that it may lead to some\r\nserious results, or they even inhibit their activities to a marked\r\nextent by their solicitude with regard to them. They worry about\r\nthings before the event and thus consume energy uselessly. Worry has\r\nbeen defined as anxious solicitude about what we have to do next week\r\nat the same time that we occupy ourselves with what we are doing now\r\nand have to do in the next hour or two. The solicitude about next week\r\nis quite useless, as a rule, until the time comes, and it merely\r\ndisturbs what we are doing now, making it harder to do and making\r\nerrors in it almost inevitable, and so preparing ourselves for\r\ndiscouragement because of mistakes that have been made and still\r\nfurther adding to the difficulty of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n{601}\r\n\r\n_Inhibition of Automatism_.--These introspective people disturb\r\nthemselves by over-attention to things that need no attention, that\r\nare accomplished automatically, and that are not done nearly so well\r\nif they are attended to. Not only is it true that it is harder to do\r\nwork that ought to be accomplished automatically if much attention is\r\ngiven to it, but also nature resents the surveillance. Not only the\r\nbrain does not work so well if watched to see whether perhaps it is\r\nworking too much, or whether there are too many feelings in our head\r\nwhile we are doing things, but even the stomach resents being watched\r\nand does not do its work as well. The same thing is probably true for\r\nevery one of our organic functions. In the chapters on the heart we\r\ncall attention to the fact that surveillance makes a perfectly healthy\r\nthough nervous heart miss beats. There is a dual waste of nervous\r\nenergy then. We are employing our attention watching things done that\r\nneed not be watched, and by that fact we are inhibiting natural\r\nprocesses and requiring that more energy shall be put into them for\r\ntheir accomplishment, and even then accomplishing them with\r\ndiscouraging imperfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Short-Circuit_.--The reflex mental process that particularly\r\naffects many individuals in our time and makes it hard for them to do\r\ntheir work, has been well described under the figure of a\r\nshort-circuit in an electrical dynamo. The short-circuit diverts the\r\ncurrent so that instead of acting outside the dynamo and performing\r\nuseful work, it is discharged within the machine, brings about\r\ndeterioration of its elements and soon leads to a reduction in the\r\namount of electrical energy that that particular dynamo can develop.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation Fibers Diversion.--Prof. Michael Foster in the Wilde\r\nLecture for 1898, \"The Physical Basis of Psychical Events,\" [Footnote\r\n44] has many valuable suggestions with regard to the mechanism of\r\nmental operations on the neuron theory. He has particularly dwelt on\r\nthe function of the association fibers in connection with mental\r\noperations, or with the raising of sensation to the plane of\r\nmentality. A portion of the brain that is originating impulses,\r\ninstead of sending them down to the periphery, through the projection\r\nfibers, to lead to the accomplishment of external work, may have its\r\nmessages diverted through the association fibers to other portions of\r\nthe brain and thus do harm rather than good.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 44: _Proceedings of Manchester Literary and Philosophical\r\n  Association_, 1898.]\r\n\r\nOccurrence of Psychasthenia.--It must not be thought that these\r\ncuriously interesting conditions occur only among people of low\r\nintellectual caliber, or in those of narrow intellectual interests,\r\nmere specialists who may have acquired a reputation for doing one\r\nthing well. They are frequent among the most intellectual classes.\r\nBrain workers of all kinds, unless they are careful to vary the\r\ninterests of life, unless, as suggested in the chapters on Occupation\r\nof Mind and Diversion of Mind, they have a hobby besides their usual\r\noccupations, are likely to suffer in this way. As a matter of fact,\r\nmany intellectual people have had what are called nervous breakdowns\r\nof this kind. A biographical dictionary shows any number of them. Dr.\r\nGould's Biographic Clinics furnish many documents for the study of\r\nthese conditions. A typical instance, told by the sufferer himself,\r\nthe distinguished Sir Francis Galton, is of special significance for\r\nthe psychotherapeutist. I {602} quote because it illustrates the fact\r\nthat such breakdowns do not portend a short or subsequently listless\r\nlife, for Sir Francis, a most successful scientific investigator,\r\nlived well beyond fourscore years in the full possession of health of\r\nmind and body.\r\n\r\n  It was during my third year at Cambridge that I broke down entirely\r\n  in health and had to lose a term and go home. I suffered from\r\n  intermittent pulse and a variety of brain symptoms of an alarming\r\n  kind. A mill seemed to be working inside my head; I could not banish\r\n  obsessing ideas; at times I could hardly read a book, and found it\r\n  painful to look at even a printed page. Fortunately I did not suffer\r\n  from sleeplessness, and my digestion failed but little. Even a brief\r\n  interval of mental rest did me good, and it seemed as if a long dose\r\n  of it might wholly restore me. It would have been madness to\r\n  continue the kind of studious life that I had been leading. I had\r\n  been much too zealous, had worked too irregularly and in too many\r\n  directions, and had done myself serious harm. It was as though I had\r\n  tried to make a steam-engine perform more work than it was\r\n  constructed for, by tampering with its safety-valve and thereby\r\n  straining its mechanism. Happily the human body may sometimes repair\r\n  itself, which the steam-engine cannot.\r\n\r\nThe physician with experience in such cases would be much more apt to\r\nsay, \"Happily we can learn to control our mental energy and not let it\r\ngo to waste by foolish persistence at one set of ideas constantly, nor\r\nbe dissipated in surveillance of functions that work automatically if\r\nleft to themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiological Factors.--This form of mental incapacity develops\r\nparticularly in people after they have gone through a prolonged period\r\nof hard work and then have come to a time when they are much freer\r\nthan they were before. They are prone to think that they exhausted\r\ntheir nerve force during the preceding period of labor and that now\r\nthey are paying for it. Almost invariably what is really happening is\r\nthat they now have much more time to occupy themselves with themselves\r\nand about themselves and to worry over their ills, real and imaginary.\r\nThis is the typical nervous breakdown, as it used to be called, of\r\nelderly retired merchants or bankers. They have looked forward all\r\ntheir lives to a time when they could enjoy themselves doing nothing.\r\nThey retire from business and then their troubles begin. It is no\r\nwonder that the old proverb, \"A machine rusts out much sooner than it\r\nwears out\" should have been so often quoted with regard to this\r\ncondition. A man who has been working busily at something all his life\r\ncannot stop all at once and do nothing. He cannot learn to occupy\r\nhimself with trivial things. Commonly, he has few, if any, interests\r\napart from his business and he very soon wears the novelty off these\r\nand then introspection comes to make him exaggerate the significance\r\nof every feeling that he has, every stiffness that occurs, every\r\nmuscle twinge due to change in the weather, until he becomes supremely\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these patients are simple, practical, common-sense,\r\nbusiness men, and it is hard for the physician to think that there is\r\nnothing more than a functional neurosis present. It is even more\r\ndifficult for the patient to be made to appreciate that his ills are\r\nmainly due to his own over-attention to himself in this idleness that\r\nhe has looked forward to with so much pleasure. Ordinary medicines\r\nfail to relieve and the regular professional man seldom succeeds in\r\ndoing these patients much good. They constitute the richest material\r\nfor the quack and the charlatan. Much occupied with their ills they\r\ntell their friends all about them. Whenever a strong impression is\r\nproduced {603} on their mind by a promise to cure them with some new\r\nwonderful remedy they are favorably influenced, often get better and\r\nthen are walking advertisements for the particular quack who has\r\nhappened to benefit them. It is this class of people that has given\r\nmore trouble to legislative committees of medical societies than any\r\nother. Some of them appeal to legislators whenever a bill for the\r\nadmission of some new form of practitioners of medicine comes up with\r\nthe story of how much benefit they derived from the treatment. Since\r\nthey have been successful business men their word carries weight. It\r\nis curious how little the making of money, though often presumed to be\r\nso, is a test of real intelligence. It is often the man of one idea\r\nwith no intellectual breadth who is the best money-getter.\r\n\r\nThese conditions develop almost entirely in predisposed individuals\r\nwho, for some reason, are trying to overdo the energy they possess,\r\nand who, as a consequence, have lost a certain control over\r\nthemselves. At times, of course, they occur in persons who have so\r\nlittle occupation of mind that thoughts of various kinds along these\r\nlines become insistently suggestive and cannot be thrown off because\r\nthe patients' interests are not sufficiently deep or sufficiently\r\nvaried to occupy their attention. The rational treatment of them,\r\nthen, must be founded on a careful study of individual cases, the\r\nrecognition of the special cause, and also the occasions at work in\r\neach case, a neutralization of unfavorable suggestion and a provision\r\nof such favorable suggestions and occupation of mind as will enable\r\nthe patient to rid himself of the annoyance occasioned by these and\r\nthe physical symptoms that so often develop as a consequence. In a\r\ncertain number of cases a history of corresponding or equivalent\r\naffections in preceding generations will be found. In many patients,\r\nhowever, there is no such history, though there is usually the story\r\nof symptomatic mental conditions of one or other of the types\r\nmentioned, earlier in life. When in good health physically the patient\r\nhas very little bother from them. When run down in weight or when\r\nworried or anxious about business or from the stress of important\r\nresponsibilities these symptoms may become bothersome mentally and\r\nphysically. Often it will be impossible to obliterate them entirely,\r\nbut always they can be greatly improved and the patient can be made to\r\nrealize that they are not seriously significant, that in mild form\r\nthey are rather common and that, above all, they are not so peculiar\r\nto the individual as he is likely to think, with consequent increase\r\nof the unfavorable suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHALLUCINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nHallucinations Differentiated from Illusions and\r\nDelusions.--Hallucinations are vivid impressions on the consciousness\r\nwhich appeal to their subject as strongly as if they were really the\r\nresult of sensory impressions, though those who experience them know,\r\neither at the moment, or on investigation afterwards, that they had no\r\nobjective reality, that is, were not due to any external physical\r\ncause. Illusions are deceptions of the senses, due to the imperfection\r\nof the senses or the conditions in which the perception occurs. {604}\r\nDelusions are mental states in which ideas are accepted, or\r\nconclusions drawn, or information assumed to be gained, though the\r\nwhole process is mental and has no relation to reality. (For\r\nillustrations of illusions see chapter with that title in the\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\nHallucinations lie in between illusions and delusions as a mode of\r\ndeception. They are mental occurrences, but they seem to come from the\r\nsenses and probably the best explanation for them is that a previous\r\nsensory impression is vaguely aroused and then finds its way into the\r\nconsciousness as if it were coming through the senses. It has been\r\nsuggested that they might be due to a reversal of the nervous process\r\nby which a sensation reaches the brain. The external object produces\r\nthe sensation, this travels along a nerve causing a perception, this\r\nperception is stored in the memory, and then, when very vividly\r\nreawakened, causes impulses to travel backward along the nerve to the\r\nperiphery with the production of a feeling very like sensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequency.--While hallucinations are often supposed to be only\r\nincidents in the life of the insane, or at least of those who are in\r\nthe danger zone near mental disequilibration, carefully collected\r\nrecent observations show that many perfectly sane people have\r\nexperienced them, and some of them have been much disturbed by them\r\nfor fear they portended loss of mental control or some developing\r\npathological condition. A certain number of men and women have seen\r\nthings that either had no existence or existed only for them and for\r\nthe moment, and that evidently were due to some state of mind rather\r\nthan to their senses. They have heard things that were not said or\r\nthat were not audible to others, or that were only reproductions of\r\ntheir memory of previous sounds and quite naturally such mysterious\r\nmanifestations disquiet them. It was the rule in the past to dismiss\r\nsuch phenomena without serious consideration, or at most to consider\r\nthat they were only subjective manifestations not worth discussing, or\r\nto go to the opposite extreme and say that they were due to mental\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nOf course, as a rule, hallucinations are an index of mental\r\ndisturbance. No matter how apparently sane the patient, this must be\r\nthe first thought and must be carefully excluded before proceeding\r\nwith the case. The subject of hallucinations is larger than that,\r\nhowever, and it is a mistake to brush it aside in every case as if it\r\nwere either very serious or of no importance and that in either case\r\nnothing can be done to relieve solicitude about it. Physicians can\r\noften do much, first to prevent hallucinations by getting at the\r\nphysical causes of them; second, to prevent them from disturbing\r\npatients seriously by showing them how common are such experiences and\r\nby indicating their possible physical significance; third, by securing\r\nsuch mental discipline and control as will render their recurrence\r\nmuch less frequent; and, fourth, they can make the almost inevitable\r\nunfavorable effect upon the mind of the patient and then reflexly upon\r\nhis body, much less than it would otherwise be, by sympathetically\r\ndiscussing and entering into the details of them enough, at least, to\r\nexplain their significance or throw some light on their origin in\r\nphysical conditions.\r\n\r\nHallucinations of vision, the seeing of things and persons that have\r\nno real existence at the time and place they are seen, are usually\r\nconsidered to be rather uncommon and to occur only in those whose\r\nmentality is seriously disturbed. Careful studies of the subject,\r\nhowever, show that at least one in ten {605} of educated people\r\nconsulted have had some hallucinations of vision. Either they have\r\nwakened up, or they have dreamt that they waked in the early morning,\r\nand have seen some one whom they knew, but knew to be at the moment at\r\na distance, standing near them. Such visions have gradually faded away\r\nor suddenly disappeared. Occasionally these persons have in full light\r\nhad some appearance, wraithlike or otherwise, some manifestation that\r\nappeals to vision, yet that they knew at the time or learned\r\nafterwards was non-existent.\r\n\r\nMany people are backward about confessing that they have had such\r\nexperiences, for they fear that it will make them ridiculous or even\r\ncause them to be suspected of disturbed mentality. Just as soon as it\r\nis made clear to them that their admissions will be taken as evidence\r\nfor a phenomenon to be discussed seriously, many more than would\r\notherwise be thought confess to such hallucinations. Most of these, it\r\nmay be said at once, are quite sensible people, a great many of them\r\nbelong to the educated classes; all of them are trustworthy witnesses\r\nas far as good will goes, and the circumstances of their\r\nhallucinations are such in many cases that there cannot be a mere\r\nmistake, or error of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which hallucinations occur may be appreciated from\r\nthe investigation made some years ago at the instance of the Congress\r\nof Experimental Psychology. The following question was put to 17,000\r\npersons, mostly residents of Great Britain, and answers received:\r\n\"Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely awake, had a\r\nvivid impression of seeing or being touched by living beings or\r\ninanimate objects, or of hearing a voice, which impression, so far as\r\nyou could discover, was not due to any external physical cause?\" The\r\nanswers showed that 655 out of 8,372 men and 1,029 out of 8,628 women\r\nhad experienced a sensory hallucination at some time in their lives.\r\nSome of them had had a number of them. That is, one out of ten in the\r\neducated classes has had some hallucination, and nearly one out of\r\nevery eight women. An analysis of the statistics, however, brings out\r\nsome interesting suggestions. There were nearly twice as many\r\nhallucinations related as having occurred during the year before the\r\nquestion was asked as in the preceding years. There was a definite\r\nreduction in the number that had occurred in all the preceding years,\r\nexcept the fifth and tenth, and these were evidently due to\r\nuncertainties of memory, so that five- and ten-year periods seemed\r\nabout the length of time that had passed since the event.\r\n\r\nIt is evident then that in spite of the fact that an hallucination\r\nwould seem to be very important and surely startling enough to be well\r\nremembered, it is yet easily forgotten, since even a year's interval\r\nmade so much difference in the number that were remembered. The\r\ncommittee, after considering this easy forgetfulness in the matter,\r\nconsidered that to arrive at the actual total of visual hallucinations\r\nexperienced by this group of 17,000 persons during the ten-year period\r\nin question, the numbers in the table should be multiplied by four.\r\nThat means that probably very nearly one in three people have had an\r\nhallucination of some kind within ten years. The great majority of the\r\nvisual hallucinations consist of apparitions of human figures. Other\r\nforms that are seen are so few, as Mr. Podmore has insisted in his\r\n\"Telepathic Hallucinations, The New View of Ghosts,\"   [Footnote 45]\r\nthat they are almost negligible. A frank {606} discussion of these\r\ndetails with a person who is much disturbed by having experienced an\r\nhallucination is the best possible remedy for the physical and mental\r\ndisturbance that may result.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 45: The Twentieth Century Science Series, New York, 1910.]\r\n\r\nSir Francis Galton, well known for his investigation of many subjects\r\nand who may well be called the father of biometrics or statistical\r\nbiology, in his \"Memories of My Life\"   [Footnote 46] tells of his own\r\ninvestigations of the visions of sane persons. The fact that he\r\ndelivered a lecture on this subject at the Royal Institution of London\r\nshows how seriously his studies were made and how much value\r\nscientists placed on them. Galton's well-recognized training in the\r\ncareful weighing of evidence and his ability to strip phenomena of\r\neverything that might divert their significance from what they really\r\nwere, add to the worth of his conclusions. Those who care to study the\r\nsubject further will find his discussion in the _Proceedings of the\r\nRoyal Institution_ (London, 1882).\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 46: New York, 1909.]\r\n\r\nThere are few people beyond middle age who have not had one or more\r\ncurious experiences in the matter of visions or appearances. Mostly\r\nthese have been vague and have not proved a disturbing element in the\r\nminds of the subjects. Many more than are thought, however, have seen\r\nvisions vividly and with a detail that makes it almost impossible for\r\nthem to believe that what they saw was merely an externation of ideas\r\nalready in their mind. In this matter it must not be forgotten that\r\nthe dreams of many people, especially nervous people, often present\r\nthemselves with marvelous vividness of detail. They see people or\r\nplaces in their dreams and reason about them quite rationally.\r\nOccasionally a dream will bring back details that have been forgotten.\r\nThe dreaming state seems in some people to have wonderful power over\r\nthe subconscious. Things that are not remembered at all in the waking\r\nstate sometimes come back in dreams, and only then are recalled by the\r\nindividual as representing past events in his life. He is apt to\r\nwonder where the details could possibly come from, since he had before\r\nno conscious memory of them. This same thing holds for the day-dreams\r\nor sudden visual appearances that come when the attention has been\r\nwrapped in something else.\r\n\r\nA typical example of such visual hallucinations is the following\r\nincident told by a prominent London physician of himself:\r\n\r\n  One afternoon at tea time, before a meeting of the Royal Society,\r\n  Sir Risdon Bennett (1809-1891, a well-known physician. President of\r\n  the College of Physicians in 1876, and a fellow of the Royal\r\n  Society), drew me apart and told me of a strange experience he had\r\n  had very recently. He was writing in his study separated by a thin\r\n  wall from the passage, when he heard the well-known postman's knock,\r\n  followed by the entrance into his study of a man dressed in a\r\n  fantastic medieval costume, perfectly distinct in every particular,\r\n  buttons and all, who, after a brief time, faded and disappeared. Sir\r\n  Risdon says that he felt in perfect health; his pulse and breathing\r\n  were normal and so forth, and he was naturally alarmed at the\r\n  prospect of some impending brain disorder. Nothing, however, of the\r\n  sort had followed. The same appearance recurred; he thought the\r\n  postman's knock somehow originated the hallucination. ... I heard\r\n  the story at length, very shortly after the event, told me with\r\n  painstaking and scientific exactness and in tones that clearly\r\n  indicated the narrator's earnest desire to be minutely correct.\r\n\r\nThose who are especially interested in this subject will find any\r\nnumber of similar stories, some apparently rich with meaning, most of\r\nthem quite {607} meaningless, in the volumes of transactions of the\r\nEnglish Psychic Research Society, in F. W. H. Myers' \"Human\r\nPersonality,\" in Podmore's \"Naturalizing the Supernatural,\" in\r\nFlammarion's \"The Unknown,\" or many other books published in recent\r\nyears. It is quite easy to get sufficient material to bring\r\nreassurance to any patient that visual hallucinations, at least, mean\r\nnothing serious for the mind or body of the individual having the\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\nHallucinations in the Past.--It must not be thought, however, that\r\nthis subject of hallucinations is new. Literature is full of it and\r\nfrom the earliest times we find traces of it. Egyptian, Babylonian and\r\nChaldean writers mention them. Nor indeed is the scientific\r\nconsideration of the subject new. Aristotle speaks of them and it is\r\nevident that many of the old writers thought of them as psychic\r\nincidents on some physical basis, or at least due to some\r\npredisposition in the individual or in some special state of his\r\nsenses. Two generations ago Johann Mueller, the great German\r\nphysiologist, discussed the whole subject at length in a monograph,\r\nand considered it of so much importance for physicians that he\r\nintroduced a resume of it into his great text-book of physiology. His\r\nexplanation of the occurrence of visual hallucinations is not only a\r\nstriking illustration of the thoroughly scientific character of his\r\ntreatment of the subject, but it serves to show how well men\r\nconsidered these subjects long before the present fad for the study of\r\nabnormal psychology or mental influence came in. His discussion of the\r\nsubject is sufficient of itself to make any patient understand his\r\nhallucinations and keep them from bothering him better than anything\r\nelse I know:\r\n\r\n  The subjective images of which we are speaking have sometimes,\r\n  however, both color and light; different particles of the retina, of\r\n  the optic nerve, and of its prolongations to the brain, being\r\n  conceived as existing in special states of action. This happens\r\n  rarely in the state of health, but frequently in disease. These are\r\n  the true phantasms which may occur to the sense of hearing and other\r\n  senses as well as to that of vision. The process by which\r\n  \"phantasms\" are produced, is the reverse of that to which the vision\r\n  of actual external objects is due. In the latter case particles of\r\n  the retina thrown into an active state by external impressions, are\r\n  conceived in that condition by the sensorium; in the former case,\r\n  the idea of the sensorium excites the active state of corresponding\r\n  particles of the retina or optic nerve. The action of the material\r\n  organ of vision, which has extension in space, upon the mind, so as\r\n  to produce the idea of an object having extension, form and relation\r\n  of parts, and the action of such an idea upon the organ of vision so\r\n  as to produce a corresponding sensation, are both equally wonderful;\r\n  and hence the spectral phenomena or visions are not more\r\n  extraordinary than the ordinary function of sight. (Vol. II, p.\r\n  1393, Eng. transl., 1842.)\r\n\r\n\r\nApparitions and their Explanation.--In spite of suggested explanations\r\non physical grounds, some of these apparitions that appear to people\r\nseriously disturb them. They cannot get them out of their minds. They\r\nare sure that they portend evil. Hence worries, and the more nervous\r\nthe people are and the more worried already, the more likely is such a\r\nthing to recur and then to be made much of. Only through their minds\r\ncan these people be treated, and it must be made clear to them not\r\nonly how common are hallucinations, but that there is an easy psychic\r\nexplanation of most of them. Sir Arthur Mitchell, K. C. B., in his\r\nbook \"About Dreaming, Laughing and Blushing,\" [Footnote 47] tells a\r\nstory and then gives his explanation of it in such a way as to\r\nilluminate many of these occurrences:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 47: Longmans, London, 1900, page 21.]\r\n\r\n{608}\r\n\r\n  Perhaps I should illustrate how I think that apparitions may be\r\n  nothing more than dream hallucinations. A. B., a gentleman of\r\n  culture and strong character, called one hot day, after a hearty\r\n  lunch, on an ecclesiastic in a high position, who happened to be\r\n  engaged in his library at the time of the call. A. B. was shown into\r\n  a room opening off the library, and requested to wait. He sat down\r\n  beside a table, and with his elbow resting on it, he leant his head\r\n  on his hand. While in this position he saw a man in clerical costume\r\n  come through the door communicating with the library, without any\r\n  opening of the door. A. B. was absolutely certain that he had seen\r\n  an apparition, and was surprised and hurt when I expressed a doubt.\r\n  He called on me to explain, and I said that it was at least possible\r\n  that he had been asleep for some moments, that if he had slept at\r\n  all, however short the dream of the sleep, he must have had a dream,\r\n  if I am right in thinking that there is no dreamless sleep, and that\r\n  thus what he regarded as an apparition might be nothing more than a\r\n  dream hallucination. He assured me persistently that he was\r\n  continuously wide-awake, but I assured him that these moments of\r\n  sleep often occurred without any consciousness that they had\r\n  occurred. He refused to be deprived of his ghost, and I refused to\r\n  believe in the supernormal when the normal was sufficient.\r\n\r\nSuch wraith-like appearances are supposed to occur especially in\r\nconnection with the deaths of persons at a distance. Startling stories\r\nare told, particularly of those who are very near relatives, husbands\r\nand wives, mothers and sons, and, above all, twins, who have been very\r\nclosely associated with one another during life. There are a large\r\nnumber of stories of this kind, however, that have been collected by\r\nthe Psychic Research Society and other agents with strong evidence in\r\ntheir favor, in which the appearances have had no ulterior\r\nsignificance at all and have evidently been mere figments of the\r\nimagination, the externation of images from memory so vividly that\r\nthey seem to be the reseen. Reassurances in this matter are the best\r\npossible source of relief from the sense of impending ill for many\r\npatients. The physician who wishes to relieve such symptoms must\r\nfamiliarize himself with some of the many stories that have been\r\ninvestigated and that serve to prove that these and like appearances\r\nmust not be taken as significant of anything more than a definite\r\ntendency, that exists in human nature at moments of day dreaming or\r\nwhen one's attention is suddenly turned from a book in which one has\r\nbeen absorbed, to see externally what is really passing through the\r\nimaginative memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Disappearance.--A very interesting commentary on some of these\r\nappearances is to be found in Mark Twain's story of a disappearance,\r\nwhich could probably be duplicated many times if experiences in this\r\nline were collected and collated. Mr. Clemens, sitting on the porch of\r\nhis residence one day, saw a stranger of rather peculiar appearance\r\ncome up the walk toward the front door and he expected to hear him\r\nring the bell and have the servant come to the door and usher him in,\r\nand then perhaps be called to see him. About the middle of the walk,\r\nhowever, the stranger disappeared and Mr. Clemens was quite surprised\r\nto come to himself, rub his eyes and conclude that he had had one of\r\nthese curious visions or hallucinations, in which the Psychic Research\r\nSociety would surely be interested. He had plainly seen the stranger\r\nenter the gate, come up the walk, and then disappear. He was so\r\nimpressed by the disappearance that he roused himself to go into the\r\nhouse to get his notebook, so as to make notes of what had happened\r\nbefore the details escaped him. To his surprise he found the stranger\r\nin conversation {609} with the servant in the house. There had simply\r\nbeen a lapse in Mr. Clemen's vision of him. He had had a disappearance\r\nphenomenon instead of an appearance. The story will be found to amuse\r\npatients who complain of appearances disturbing them, though Mr.\r\nClemens always told his disappearance story very seriously, and it is\r\nas interesting a psychic phenomenon as any told of the wraith-like\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--Considering how frequent are such phenomena, the physician\r\nmust be prepared to treat those who are disquieted by them. A\r\nwraith-like appearance, for instance, will disturb many people very\r\nseriously and often for days, sometimes for weeks, make them nervous,\r\nexcitable, and impair their appetite, disturb their digestion and\r\nsleep and often such unfortunate occurrences are prone to come just\r\nwhen they are run down in weight and when they need the help of every\r\nfactor that makes for improvement of health. Simply to dismiss such an\r\nappearance as if it were quite imaginary, that is, non-existent in\r\nsome form of reality, or quite baseless and trivial, serves no good\r\npurpose, for, as a rule, the persons concerned are deeply impressed\r\nwith what they have seen. The only way to remove the unfavorable\r\nimpression produced by it is to discuss it straightforwardly on the\r\nbasis of what we have come to know as the result of recent\r\ninvestigations and the collation of the literature which has been\r\npublished by the various psychical research societies and authorities\r\non the subject. We know now that while occasionally such wraith-like\r\nappearances seemed to have a definite significance, because of\r\nsomething that happened simultaneously or shortly afterwards, this is\r\nmere coincidence and there are literally thousands of such cases in\r\nwhich a well authenticated wraith-like appearance was followed by no\r\nserious consequence, was never shown to mean anything beyond a curious\r\npsychic phenomenon, and was evidently merely due to some personal\r\nsubjective influence, some externation of an image in the memory,\r\nunusual, but not at all unique, or even very rare, and evidently due\r\nto a curious peculiar externalizing power with which certain\r\nintellects are gifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuditory Hallucinations.--Hallucinations of hearing are more common\r\nthan those of vision. Many people have had the experience of waking up\r\nthinking that someone was calling them. A great many people are sure\r\nthat they have, at some time or other, heard a voice when no one was\r\nnear enough to them to have said anything. They have even recognized\r\nthe voice. Some people, when thinking deeply about a person, have the\r\nvoice of that person occur to them so clearly that they cannot quite\r\nmake out whether they have actually heard it or whether it has only\r\nbeen very vividly reproduced in their memory. Such experiences are so\r\ncommon as to be well known, though many people hesitate to tell the\r\nstories of them, for hearing voices is rightly looked upon as a\r\nfrequent preliminary symptom of insanity.\r\n\r\nHallucinations of hearing are the most common early symptom of\r\ninsanity. The hearing of voices must always arouse suspicion at once.\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that a great many recognizedly sane\r\npeople who have remained so for life, have thought that they heard\r\nvoices. Of course, we have no definition for insanity, and it is\r\ndifficult to draw the line. We have no definition for health either,\r\nyet we have a practical working standard for the recognition of it, as\r\nalso for insanity. These hallucinations then, both of vision and\r\nhearing, deserve to be discussed seriously, and in {610} nearly every\r\ncase, even though there is some mental disturbance, the physician can\r\nin this way benefit his patients and keep them from being overmuch\r\ndistressed by their hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThere is an expression in such common use that it is evidently the\r\nresult of an almost universal experience, according to which men\r\nsometimes explain, after having acted in a particular way, that\r\n\"something told them to.\" What they mean, of course, is that a\r\nconclusion formed in their minds the reasons for which they could not\r\nunderstand, but which yet had force enough to cause them to follow it\r\nto a practical application. When we hear of Socrates being advised in\r\nlife by a demon, a so-called familiar spirit, we are apt to wonder\r\nwhether by this term is meant anything more than just this curious\r\nfeeling of aloofness from ourselves that we sometimes have when we are\r\ntrying to make up our minds, or, indeed, not infrequently when we are\r\ndeeply engaged in any intellectual occupation. As discussed in the\r\nchapter on Unconscious Cerebration, our minds seem in a certain way to\r\nact independently of us. Occasionally they draw us to conclusions\r\nquite different from those which we previously expected to reach.\r\nThere seems to be a something within us that works quite of itself and\r\nbeyond our will. Whether under these circumstances there may not\r\noccasionally come so vivid a feeling of this power within us\r\nimpressing itself upon us, that it seems to come from without, must\r\nalways be taken into account in the effort to get at the real\r\nsignificance of these curious hallucinations. Only thus are we able to\r\ncome to the relief of patients who are bothered by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation by Sound Reproduction_.--Auditory hallucinations are\r\nprobably not more than reproductions of sounds heard before recalled\r\nvividly and apparently heard again at moments when attention is not\r\nattracted to actual auditory sensations and we are in receptive mood.\r\nSome of them are very startling because they are apparently warnings\r\nof future events, as is proved by their fulfillment. These, however,\r\ndo not seem to be more than coincidences noted with regard to similar\r\nevents connected with Premonitions, Dreads and Dreams (see chapters on\r\nthese subjects). There is, for instance, a well authenticated story\r\npublished by the English Psychic Research Society of a woman who was\r\nabout to take a dose of what she thought was some ordinary home\r\nremedy, when she distinctly heard a voice telling her to taste it. The\r\ndose to be taken was a tablespoonful, and when she tasted it she found\r\nthat by mistake she had placed her hands on a bottle containing a\r\nrather strong poison and a tablespoonful of it would almost inevitably\r\nhave killed her. Unfortunately, such occurrences are so rare and the\r\nreason for them is so hard to find that their consideration as\r\nanything more than coincidences seems out of the question. Every\r\nmedical journal almost brings the story of someone who has taken a\r\ndose of medicine that proves fatal, and there is no warning. If such\r\nwarnings came with definite frequency, it would be easier to\r\nappreciate their significance.\r\n\r\nThere are similar stories with regard to other warnings. There is the\r\nstory of the young man who in a storm drove under a shed for\r\nprotection. Just as he did so he heard his mother's voice--she had\r\nbeen long dead--distinctly say \"Drive out!\" Ho drove out at once in\r\nthe teeth of the storm, so deeply impressed was he, and was scarcely\r\nbeyond the entrance when the shed fell, crushing everything within it.\r\nSimilar warnings of impending {611} accidents are rather frequent in\r\ncertain people's minds, yet it is hard to think of them as anything\r\nelse than premonitions. These somehow take on the character of\r\nauditory hallucinations in certain sensitive minds. Compared to the\r\nwhole number of accidents, however, such incidents are extremely rare\r\nand follow no law, and while there are those who like to think that\r\nperhaps such phenomena are due to the solicitude of some being in the\r\nother world, this is extremely doubtful. In that case, as St.\r\nAugustine suggested, they would be much more frequent and have a\r\nclearer significance than is at present the rule. St. Augustine,\r\ndiscussing the possibility, was sure that he would have had\r\ncommunications from his mother. Most men would re-echo his feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincidences.--Most of these stories as they have been analyzed by\r\ncareful investigators are indeed such trivial unmeaning things that it\r\nwould be too bad to let people be bothered by them. They have\r\noccurred, however, from time immemorial. Veridical warnings are a\r\ncommonplace in the literature of all countries. Undoubtedly some may\r\nsuggest the action of a Higher Power, but the more one knows of the\r\nconditions in which they happened, the people to whom they came and\r\ntheir ultimate effects, the less will they seem providential. It is\r\nevident that under certain conditions they may be produced even at\r\nmoments when men are not particularly excited and when they think that\r\nthey are perfectly calm and self-possessed. Each story must be\r\ndiscussed in its own merits. The only thing to do, then, is not to\r\nmake too light of them and, above all, not to treat them as merely\r\nimaginary or as utterly illusory; for they are often natural\r\nphenomena, the reasons for which and the conditions of their\r\nproduction we do not as yet fully understand. If patients can be\r\nbrought to this viewpoint, they may even become interested in\r\nsearching out just what it was that caused each particular\r\nhallucination. Over and over again it has been found that a moonbeam\r\nor a peculiar unexpected reflection of the sun, or the light shining\r\nthrough an unnoted aperture, or any or several of these in connection\r\nwith a mirror has been the main cause of the wraith-like appearance.\r\nWhen they happen during the day it is sometimes at the moment of\r\npassing from very bright light to a darker hall that the occurrence\r\ntakes place and evidently there is some physical occasion for the\r\nappearances in the eye itself. Unusual noises of various kinds are\r\nresponsible for the auditory hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDangers of Serious Considerations.--There is one serious aspect of\r\nthese hallucinations and supposed warnings--they tend to paralyze\r\naction. If a person allows himself to become firmly persuaded that\r\ndoubts and premonitory possibilities must be weighed and solved before\r\nhe may dare to act with assurance, then action becomes almost\r\nimpossible. Premonitions may serve to bring people into danger, or at\r\nleast keep people from having such presence of mind as will enable\r\nthem to get out of it, as they otherwise would. Doubts lead to\r\ninaction and make a state of mind that is eminently miserable. The\r\npatient's one hope is to put aside resolutely such hallucinations if\r\nthey rise to the level of a disturbing doubt or a paralyzing\r\npremonition and to discipline himself against being influenced by\r\nthem. In many persons this is a difficult matter, but it represents\r\nthe only efficient path to the regaining of mental health and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n{612}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDREADS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any discussion of the influence of mind over body, favorable and\r\nunfavorable, too much emphasis cannot be placed on the hold that\r\ndreads have over a great many people and how much they mean, not alone\r\nfor the mental state, but also for the physical sense of well-being or\r\nof ill-feeling in the individual. The expression attributed to the old\r\nhermit who had lived to the age of one hundred and had spent some\r\nsixty years of existence in the solitude of the desert, with all the\r\nopportunities for introspection that this afforded, is the best\r\nillustration even in our day of what dreads signify in life: \"I am an\r\nold man,\" he said to the young solitary who came to him for advice,\r\n\"and I have had many troubles, but most of them never happened.\" We\r\nare nearly all of us, or at least those of us who spend most of our\r\ntime in sedentary mental occupations, prone to fear that something\r\nuntoward is preparing for us and in many cases to dread lest some\r\nserious ailment or other is just ahead of us. We are afraid that\r\ncertain feelings, though we like to call them symptoms, due to some\r\ntrivial cause or other as a rule that deserves no notice, may mean the\r\ninsidious inroads of a constitutional disease destined to shorten\r\nexistence. A little fatigue, over-tiredness of particular muscles, the\r\nstraining of joints, the discomforts due to overeating and\r\nundersleeping, that are meant as passing warnings of nature for the\r\nnecessity of a little more care in life, are exaggerated into symptoms\r\nthat have a more or less serious significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE DREADS\r\n\r\nBesides these rather vague dreads, however, there are certain special\r\ndisquietudes peculiar to individuals, even more groundless, if\r\npossible, than the generic apprehension just spoken of and that have\r\nbeen dignified in recent years by the name of phobias. Phobia means\r\nonly \"fear\" in Greek, but the term is much more satisfying to nervous\r\npeople than the shorter but too definite English term, dread, or fear.\r\nThere is acrophobia, or the fear of looking down from a height;\r\nclaustrophobia, or the fear of narrow places, as the dread of walking\r\nthrough a narrow street because of the sense of oppression that comes\r\nwith the shut-inness of it. Then there is agoraphobia, market-place\r\ndread, or the fear to cross an open space because one has, as it were,\r\ngrown accustomed to be near buildings and misses their presence. There\r\nare many others, indeed as many as there are dislikes in human nature,\r\nfor any dislike apparently may be exaggerated into a dread. I mention\r\na few at the beginning of the alphabet and some of special\r\nsignificance. There is aerophobia, dread of the air, a symptom\r\nsometimes mentioned in connection with hydrophobia; aichmophobia, the\r\ndread of pointed tools; ailurophobia, the dread of cats; anthrophobia\r\nor the dread of men; pathophobia or the fear of disease, microbophobia\r\nor bacillophobia; kenophobia or the dread of emptiness; phthisiophobia\r\nor the dread of consumption; zoophobia or the dread of animals;\r\nsitophobia or the dread of food, and even phobophobia, the dread of\r\n{613} dreading. Neuropsychologists seem to take a special pleasure in\r\ninventing some new phobia or at least giving us a fine long Greek name\r\nfor a set of symptoms by no means new and that might well be explained\r\nin simpler terms. The most familiar examples are: the fear of\r\nlightning, which is more frequently brontophobia, the fear of thunder.\r\n\r\nThese learned words are all formed on the same etymological principle\r\nas hydrophobia, but they are entirely psychic in origin, while\r\nhydrophobia, as it is well to explain to patients who think of the\r\nword phobia in connection with their symptoms, is, of course, a\r\nmisnomer for an infectious disease--rabies--which develops as the\r\nconsequence of a bite of a rabid animal, and the principal symptom of\r\nwhich is not fear of water, but the impossibility of swallowing any\r\nliquid because of spasm of the esophageal muscles.\r\n\r\nAlmost any function of the body may become the subject of a dread or\r\nphobia that may interfere even seriously with it. Any disturbance of\r\nany function is likely to be emphasized by such dreads. The French\r\nhave described the basophobia, which makes the patients suffering from\r\nbeginning tabes dread so much walking that it becomes a much greater\r\neffort than it would otherwise be and often interferes with walking\r\nrather seriously. Then there is the fear of tremor which exaggerates a\r\ntremor due to some organic cause, but yet not necessarily of grave\r\nimport, nor likely to increase rapidly. Many of the hysterical palsies\r\nare really due to dreads, consequent upon some incident, motor or\r\nsensory, which produced a profound effect upon the patient's mind. A\r\npatient who has been surprised by a digestive vertigo while descending\r\na stairs, even though nothing more happened than the dizziness which\r\nrequired him to grasp the balustrade, will sometimes develop a fear of\r\nvertigo that will actually make it difficult for him to go down stairs\r\nwithout such an effort of will as is very exhausting. Even the\r\nslightest functions may be thus disturbed. Pitres and Regis described\r\nsome ten years ago what they called the obsession of blushing, or\r\nerythrophobia, the fear of turning red. Patients make themselves\r\nextremely miserable in this way. Only training and self-control will\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\nThese names are long and mouth-filling and consequently satisfying,\r\nand most people who are suffering from a particular phobia are almost\r\nsure to think that they have a very special affliction. When the word\r\ndread is used instead of the word phobia they are less likely to\r\nmisunderstand the character of their affection and to realize that it\r\nis not a disease but only an unfortunate mental peculiarity that needs\r\ncontrol and discipline, and not fostering care. Neurasthenia only\r\nmeans nervous weakness, as we have pointed out, but most people are\r\nrather rejoiced when informed that they have so high-sounding a\r\ndisease as neurasthenia, while to be told that they are nervously weak\r\nor suffer from nervous weakness seems quite a come-down from their\r\ninteresting Greek-designated affection. Most psychiatrists feel that\r\nit is better not to give the long Greek term, but to state in simple\r\nshort Saxon words just what is the matter with the patient. They are\r\nsuffering from the dread of a height, or the dread of a narrow street,\r\nor the dread of open spaces, or the dread of dirt, or of cats, or of\r\nwhatever else it may be. This makes it easier for them to begin to\r\ndiscipline themselves against the state of mind into which they allow\r\nthemselves to fall with regard to these various objects, and mental\r\ndiscipline is the only therapeutic adjuvant that is of any avail in\r\n{614} lessening these conditions. With reasonable perseverance most\r\npeople can, if not cure themselves of these affections, at least\r\ngreatly lessen the discomfort due to them. A consideration of\r\nparticular dreads brings out the specific suggestions that may be made\r\nwith regard to each and the directions that may be helpful to the\r\npatients. Probably the commonest is acrophobia, so that the detailed\r\nconsideration of it shows the indications for other dreads.\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Heights.--Almost without exception men have a sort of\r\ninstinctive dread of looking down from a height. In most people this\r\ncan be conquered to such a degree that almost anyone, if compelled by\r\nnecessity, can learn to work on a skyscraper and continue to do good\r\nwork without much bother about the height, though he may have to go up\r\nten to twenty stories, or even more. When he takes up the work at\r\nfirst every workman finds it difficult. It gives most of us a trembly\r\nfeeling even to sit in our chair and think of looking down from such a\r\nheight. To see pictures of men standing on the iron frames of\r\nskyscrapers twenty or thirty stories up in the air looking down 300 to\r\n500 feet below them gives one a series of little chilly feelings in\r\nthe back and in many people a goneness or sense of constriction around\r\nthe abdomen that is almost a girdle feeling. To sit at a window\r\nopposite where a skyscraper is going up and to see the men lean over\r\nthe edge of a beam calling directions of various kinds to workmen\r\nbelow will give most people, even those who are not nervous or\r\nespecially sensitive, creepy feelings with sometimes a little catch in\r\nthe breath and an iciness in the hypochondria. It would seem\r\nabsolutely impossible that we should ever be able to perform these\r\nfeats of looking from a height, yet experience shows that most of us,\r\nafter a little training, learn to do it without difficulty.\r\n\r\nEven the men who work most confidently have some creepy feelings\r\nreturn to them whenever they stop and think about this and let their\r\neyes wander to the distance below them. It is not difficult for us to\r\nwalk across a plank raised a foot or two from the ground, though to\r\nwalk across the same plank at a height of ten feet may be quite a\r\ntrial and at thirty feet may become quite impossible. This is all due\r\nto lack of confidence on our part and there is no reason in the world\r\nwhy, if the plank is amply wide for us at two feet from the ground, it\r\nshould not be just as wide and safe at 30 or 60 or even 100 feet. This\r\nis what the men who have learned to work on skyscrapers have\r\ndisciplined themselves to. They have learned to disregard the wide\r\nvacant space around them and the yawning chasm beneath their feet;\r\nthey keep their eyes fixed on something in the immediate vicinity,\r\nexcluding thoughts of all that might happen if they should lose their\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physical Basis_.--There is a physical basis in many of these cases\r\nthat constitutes the underlying occasion, at least, for the\r\ndevelopment of the psychic dread. Our eyes have grown accustomed to\r\nbeing fixed on near objects. Whenever they are not so fixed we get a\r\nfeeling of trepidation. Even those who have done a little day-dreaming\r\nknow that sometimes when they have been looking into space, objects\r\naround them have suddenly seemed to be transferred to a long distance\r\nand at the same time a curious sense of insecurity came over them.\r\nAnyone can get this feeling experimentally by making two large dots on\r\na piece of paper about two inches apart and then gazing between the\r\ndots into vacancy beyond the paper as it were, until the dots have a\r\ntendency to become four because of the fact that each eye sees {615}\r\neach of the dots on a part of the retina not corresponding to that on\r\nwhich the other eye sees it (see Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25. (Two solid black dots about 1/2 inch\r\n  diameter and 4 inches apart.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment is successfully performed the dots begin to float\r\nbefore the eyes, then they may coalesce into one or become three, but\r\nany number up to four may readily be seen. This will give the sense of\r\ninsecurity that comes from the eyes not having any fixed object to\r\nlook at and illustrates the discipline of the eyes that must be\r\nlearned in order that looking down from a height may not be productive\r\nof the usual dread.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dread of Small Heights_.--It is often thought that acrophobia, or the\r\nfear of a height, concerns only great heights and that ordinary\r\nelevations produce no discomfort. I have had patients, however, who,\r\nwhen compelled by circumstances over which they had no control or at\r\nleast by social obligations that were hard to break, to sit on the\r\nfront row of even a low balcony, have been extremely uncomfortable.\r\nThere was a sense of tightness and oppression about the chest that\r\nmade it difficult for them to breathe, that disturbed their heart\r\naction and gave them a general sense of ill-feeling. I have had a\r\ncuriously interesting series of cases in clergymen who found it trying\r\nto say Mass or conduct services or to preach from the step of a high\r\naltar. One would be inclined at first to make little of their\r\ndescription of their utter discomfort. There is no doubt at all,\r\nhowever, of their real torture of mind and of the extreme effort\r\nrequired to enable them to support themselves in the trying ordeal.\r\nThey are often so exhausted because of the effort required that only\r\nwith difficulty can they do anything else during the day.\r\n\r\nTo most people such a state of mind is inexplicable. There are deeply\r\nintellectual men who, in my experience, are quite disturbed by\r\napparently so simple a thing as having to say Mass on an altar that\r\nhas three or four steps to it and is elevated five or six feet above\r\nthe surrounding floor. As for higher altars, like the main altar of a\r\ncathedral, they usually find it quite impossible to conduct services\r\nunless they are in company with others, when their feelings are much\r\nrelieved. This same thing is true of agoraphobia in some people. To go\r\nalone across an open place or square is agony, but even the company of\r\na little child is sufficient to relieve them to a great degree. I told\r\na distinguished American prelate of this curious dread in priests so\r\noften called to the physician's attention, and he said that he had\r\nnever heard of it. To his surprise some of his clergymen present at\r\nthe table told him that there were two examples of it in brothers in\r\nhis own diocese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Discipline_.--The lesson of the many men who, by discipline,\r\nhave succeeded in conquering the aversion and the dread of heights\r\nthat everyone has to some extent at least, shows the possibility there\r\nis for even those who are extremely sensitive in this matter to so\r\nlessen their timidity and the uncomfortable oppression that comes over\r\nthem, as to make it possible to accomplish whatever is in their line\r\nof duty. It is no more difficult for the sensitive clergyman to learn\r\nby practice and discipline to walk with confidence on a reasonably\r\nhigh altar or platform, than it is for the workman to learn to {616}\r\nwalk a beam on the top of a twenty-story building without a thought of\r\nthe dangers of his position, or at least putting the thought away from\r\nhim so that it does not interfere with his work. At the beginning he\r\ncannot do it, but he disciplines himself to form a habit that makes it\r\neasy. Yielding to his feelings makes it difficult to withstand the\r\ndiscomforts that come to him. After an accident on a high building, as\r\na rule, men have to be sent home for the day to get their nerves\r\nsettled by the night's sleep before they can work with sufficient\r\nconfidence, and yet accomplish their usual amount of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo-called Misophobia--Dread of Dirt.--Misophobia, or the fear of dirt,\r\nhas grown much more common in recent years, and the spread of the\r\nknowledge of the wide diffusion of bacteria has added to the\r\nunreasoning dread that possesses these people. Some of them wash their\r\nhands forty to fifty times a day, and one young man who was brought to\r\nme with the worst looking hands, because of irritation from soap and\r\nwater, that I have ever seen, seemed to be always either just plunging\r\nhis hands into water or wiping them dry. These people make themselves\r\nsupremely miserable. They do not care to shake hands with friends and,\r\nabove all, with physicians, and they invent all sorts of excuses so as\r\nto wait outside of doors till someone else opens them so as to avoid\r\ntouching the knob or door pull, \"which\" with a poignant expression of\r\nrepugnance they tell you \"is handled by so many people.\" When the\r\npatients are women, getting on and off cars becomes a nightmare to\r\nthem, because they do not want to touch the handle bars and unless\r\nthey do they find it difficult to ascend and descend. The curious\r\nexcuses they offer for their peculiar actions in avoiding the touch of\r\nobjects around them are interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaustrophobia.--This sort of dread seems quite irrational to most\r\npeople and many would probably conclude that individuals thus affected\r\ncould not possibly be quite in their right minds, or must surely be\r\nrather weak-minded. On the contrary, many of the people who are\r\naffected by these curious dreads are above the average in intelligence\r\nand sometimes also in their power to do intellectual work. A typical\r\nexample, for instance, of claustrophobia, or the fear of closed\r\nspaces, is found in the life of Philip Gilbert Hamerton. He was a\r\ndistinguished painter and essayist, editor and novelist. Few men of\r\nhis generation were able to do better intellectual work than he. His\r\nbook on \"The Intellectual Life\" was more read perhaps than any work of\r\nits kind in the last generation. He was not a profound thinker, but he\r\nwas a very talented practical man. The fact that besides being a\r\nwriter whose books sold he was a painter whose works were in demand,\r\nshows a breadth of artistic quality that is quite unusual. His was not\r\nthe sort of genius, however, that is so often supposed to be allied to\r\ninsanity, for he was rather a worker who obtained his effects by\r\nplodding, than a brilliant genius that got his thoughts by intuition.\r\n\r\nIn a word, in spite of the fact that he was just the sort of man that\r\none would not think likely to be affected by a phobia, he had a series\r\nof attacks of claustrophobia, some of which were intensely annoying to\r\nhim and seriously disturbing to his friends. His wife has described\r\nsome of them in his \"Life and Letters.\" Once after crossing the\r\nEnglish Channel, he had a severe attack in the railroad carriage on\r\nthe way up to London. He had not been nervous {617} on the voyage and\r\nhad not been seasick. He was returning from a vacation and was in the\r\nbest of health and spirits, yet suddenly the feeling of inordinate\r\ndread that he was shut in came over him and he could scarcely control\r\nhimself or keep from plunging out of the window in order to get into\r\nthe open. His wife says that \"His hands became cold, his eyes took on\r\na far-reaching look, his expression became hard and set and his face\r\nflushed.\" He seemed \"as if ready to overthrow any obstacle in his way;\r\nand indeed it was the case, for, unable to control himself any longer,\r\nhe got up and told me hoarsely that he was going to jump out of the\r\ntrain. I took hold of his hand and said I would follow him, only I\r\nentreated him to wait a short time, as we were near the station. I\r\nplaced myself quite close to the door of the railway carriage and\r\nstood between him and it. Happily the railway station was soon\r\nreached, when he rushed from the train and into the fields.\" His wife\r\nfollowed him like one dazed, and almost heart-broken. After half an\r\nhour he lessened his pace, turning to her and said, \"I think it is\r\ngoing.\" For two hours they continued to walk, at the end of which\r\nGilbert said tenderly in his usual voice, \"You must be terribly tired,\r\npoor darling. I think I could bear to rest now. We may try to sit\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Cats.--One of the most interesting of dreads, very frequently\r\nseen and producing much more discomfort than could possibly be\r\nimagined by anyone who had not seen striking cases of it, is the dread\r\nof cats which has been dignified and rendered more suggestively\r\nsignificant by the Greek designation ailurophobia. While the great\r\nmajority of individuals suffering from this unreasoning dread of cats\r\nare women and usually of a delicate nervous organization, it must not\r\nbe thought that it is by any means confined to them or has any\r\nnecessary connection with hysterical symptoms. One of the most\r\nstriking cases of this dread of which I know personally occurs in a\r\nlarge, rather masculine-looking woman, who cannot abide being in a\r\nroom with a cat, and who is quite unable to do anything while one of\r\nthese animals is within sight. Yet she is not at all what would be\r\ncalled timorous and she has more manly than womanly characteristics in\r\nevery way. She once proceeded to thrash within an inch of his life a\r\nsmall burglar who entered her house and she rather prides herself on\r\nbeing able to protect herself. Nor is this dread necessarily\r\nassociated with any other disturbances of mind or nervous system. Some\r\nof the patients I have seen, who confess to suffering from it, were\r\nthoroughly sensible, brave little women, able to stand suffering well,\r\nnot at all hysterical in nature, and who in the midst of worries found\r\ntime to be thoughtful of others and not to have that selfishness\r\nwhich, even more than physical symptoms, is so apt to characterize\r\nhysterical patients.\r\n\r\nI have had men confess to me their dread of cats, and while, as a\r\nrule, they were of delicate constitution and inclined to be nervous\r\nand did not have the phobia to an inordinate degree, there was no\r\ndoubt that they were extremely uncomfortable whenever a cat was near\r\nthem. On the other hand, some of them were vigorous, husky men with\r\nstrong aversions. One of the most marked cases of ailurophobia that\r\nwas ever brought to my attention was in an army officer who had\r\nexhibited bravery in battle on many occasions, and what requires much\r\nmore strength of mind, calm fortitude in difficult campaigning, yet\r\nfor whom a cat had many more terrors than the battery of an enemy or\r\neven an ambuscade of Filipinos. More cases of this particular {618}\r\naversion seem to occur in clergymen than in other men, yet one of the\r\nworst cases I ever saw was in a priest of great moral courage, who had\r\nserved a pest-house over and over again in smallpox epidemics.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said about such a dread is that it exists, that it is\r\nunreasoning, that some patients have been known by discipline of mind\r\nto overcome the abhorrence to a great degree but never quite entirely.\r\nIn this regard, however, it must not be forgotten that there are many\r\nthings abhorrent to human nature that seem impossible to overcome the\r\naversion for, yet discipline does much to relieve them. For instance,\r\nthe handling of dead bodies so familiar to physicians brings with it\r\nan aversion that we never quite get over and which resumes most of its\r\noriginal strength with disuse, but that can be overcome to such an\r\nextent as to make pathological work produce very little aversion. Even\r\nVirchow, after all his years of occupation with pathological material,\r\nconfessed toward the end of his life, that whenever he was away from\r\nhis work for a few months his aversion had to be overcome anew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spectator on Dreads_.--There might be a tendency to think that\r\nthese curious dreads came only as the result of the individualistic\r\nover-occupation with self and the introspective sophistication of the\r\nmodern time, but the dread is not confined to our time nor special to\r\nit in any way, for we find Shakespeare talking of those who cannot\r\nbear a harmless, necessary cat. A number of other writers of different\r\nperiods refer to it. As in so many other things _The Spectator_\r\nreflects his time in this and so we have a letter with regard to the\r\ndread of cats. It would not have been a subject for discussion in one\r\nof these popular communications only that the writer felt that a good\r\nmany people would realize how like it was to things that they\r\nthemselves knew of. In number 609 the following letter, supposed to be\r\nfrom a correspondent, seems worth giving in full, because it touches\r\non other subjects in which uncontrollable, unreasoning feeling plays a\r\nrole:\r\n\r\n  I wish you would write a philosophical paper about natural\r\n  antipathies, with a word or two concerning the strength of\r\n  imagination. ... A story that relates to myself on this subject may\r\n  be thought not unentertaining, especially when I assure you that it\r\n  is literally true. I had long made love to a lady, in the possession\r\n  of whom I am now the happiest of mankind, whose hand I should have\r\n  gained with much difficulty without the assistance of a cat. You\r\n  must know then that my most dangerous rival had so strong an\r\n  aversion to this species, that he infallibly swooned away at the\r\n  sight of that harmless creature. My friend, Mrs. Lucy, her maid,\r\n  having a greater respect for me and my purse than she had for my\r\n  rival, always took care to pin the tail of a cat under the gown of\r\n  her mistress, whenever she knew of his coming; which had such an\r\n  effect that every time he entered the room, he looked more like one\r\n  of the figures in Mrs. Salmon's wax-work than a desirable lover. In\r\n  short, he grew sick of her company, which the young lady taking\r\n  notice of (who no more knew why than he did), she sent me a\r\n  challenge to meet her in Lincoln's Inn Chapel, which I joyfully\r\n  accepted; and have, amongst other pleasures, the satisfaction of\r\n  being praised by her for my stratagem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cat Fear and Furs_.--This dread of cats is sometimes exhibited to a\r\nsurprising degree under rather unexpected circumstances. For instance,\r\nit is not unusual, since the fashion for the longer-haired furs came\r\nin, to find that some of these patients cannot wear certain supposedly\r\nelegant furs, since they are really dyed catskin. At times this is not\r\nsuspected until other possible causes for the discomfort have been\r\neliminated. Some women cannot even bear to be near catskins in muffs\r\nand other such furs, though the imitation {619} may be so good as to\r\ndeceive any but an expert, and they apparently had no suspicion at the\r\nbeginning of the presence of cat fur near them. I have been told by a\r\nphysician the story of a man, poignantly sensitive to cats, who\r\npurchased a fur-lined coat and found it quite impossible to wear it\r\nbecause of the sensations it produced in him, though he had no\r\nsuspicion of any connection between cats and the fur when he purchased\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recognition of Presence_.--Why this dread of cats occurs and, above\r\nall, the reason for the ability to know that a cat is near when the\r\nanimal is concealed and others are not at all aware of its presence,\r\nor that its fur should produce a disagreeable sensation, is not easy\r\nto decide. Its discussion is suggestive for other forms of dreads, for\r\nthere are probably like refinements of sensation, normal and abnormal,\r\nconnected with them. Much has been said about this as a reversion to\r\npowers possessed by man in a savage state when there was necessity for\r\nguarding against animal attacks. Unfortunately for any such\r\nsupposition as this, these people, who are most fearful of cats, that\r\nis, of the ordinary domestic animal, have no uneasiness in the\r\npresence of the huge cats in the menageries--the lions and the tigers.\r\nIt is with regard to these that such a specialization of scent would\r\nbe particularly valuable for men. There seems no doubt but that it is\r\nan odor or a sensation allied to an odor, though perhaps below the\r\nordinary threshold of recognition as such, that enables these people\r\nto detect the presence of a cat. Dr. Weir Mitchell in his article on\r\n\"Ailurophobia and The Power to Be Conscious of the Cat as Near While\r\nUnseen and Unheard,\" in the _Transactions of the Association of\r\nAmerican Physicians_, 1905, discusses odor in this connections as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  To be influenced by an olfactory impression of which (as odor) the\r\n  subject rests unconscious, may seem an hypothesis worthy of small\r\n  respect and beyond power of proof. Nevertheless it seems to me\r\n  reasonable. There are sounds beyond the hearing of certain persons.\r\n  If they ever cause effects we do not know. There are rays of which\r\n  we are not conscious as light or heat, except through the effects to\r\n  which they give rise. There may be olfactory emanations\r\n  distinguished by some as odors and by others felt, not as odors, but\r\n  only in their influential results on nervous systems unusually and\r\n  abnormally susceptible. No other explanation seems to me available,\r\n  and this gains value from certain contributory facts.\r\n\r\n  We must admit that all animals and human beings emit emanations\r\n  which are recognizable by many animals and are in wild creatures\r\n  protectively valuable.\r\n\r\n  This delicate recognition is commonly lost in mankind, but some\r\n  abnormal beings like Laura Bridgeman and a perfectly normal lad I\r\n  once saw, have possessed the power of distinguishing by smell the\r\n  handkerchiefs of a family after they had been washed and ironed. In\r\n  this lad I made a personal test of his power to pick out by their\r\n  odor from a heap of clean handkerchiefs mine and those of others,\r\n  the latter two belonging to his father and mother.\r\n\r\n  I have seen a woman, well known to me, who can distinguish by mere\r\n  odor the gloves worn by relatives or friends. This lady, who likes\r\n  cats as pets, is able to detect by its odor the presence of a cat\r\n  when I and others cannot.\r\n\r\n  Two French observers believe that they have proved the sense of\r\n  olfaction to be nine times more acute in women than in men.\r\n\r\n  So far as the present paper might serve in evidence, I should be\r\n  inclined to say that the sense of smell was keener in women than in\r\n  men, but as to this there is extreme diversity of opinion and the\r\n  whole question awaits further investigation.    [Footnote 48]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: This question of the varying acuteness of smell in\r\n    different people is very interesting to the psychotherapeutist for\r\n    diagnosis and therapy. We have a number of striking cases of very\r\n    acute olfactory power. This is what might be expected since\r\n    animals whose respiratory and smell apparatuses are very like our\r\n    own show extreme differences. The extent to which human power to\r\n    recognize odors can go is marvelous. In his \"Thinking, Feeling,\r\n    Doing,\" Prof. Scripture says: \"I have a case--reported by a\r\n    perfectly competent witness who lived for years with the person\r\n    mentioned--of a woman in charge of a boarding school who always\r\n    sorted the boys' linen after the wash by the odor alone.\"\r\n    Personally, I have sometimes wondered whether this power, like\r\n    that of feeling in the blind, could not be developed. The blind\r\n    are supposed actually to bring about an evolution in their nerves\r\n    of feeling. No such thing happens, however. An examination of them\r\n    by means of an esthesiometer shows that their nerves are no better\r\n    developed than those of other people, though they may be able to\r\n    recognize much minuter differences between the \"feel\" of things\r\n    and may be able to read raised type, which the seeing cannot. This\r\n    is all due to a training of their attention to note slight\r\n    differences in sensation, however, and not to improvement in the\r\n    nervous apparatus. ]\r\n\r\n{620}\r\n\r\nDread of the Dark.--The discipline suggested with regard to overcoming\r\nthe dread of heights must be applied to any of these dreads if\r\npatients are to be made comfortable. They can form the opposite habit\r\nand by refusing to yield to their fears can do much to lessen them.\r\nNearly everyone who is unaccustomed to sleeping in a dark house alone\r\nhas dreads that come over him when he first tries to do it. Every\r\nnoise is exaggerated in significance and the creaking of stairs and\r\nrattling windows and doors and the wind through the trees are all made\r\nsignificant of something quite other than what they are. Nearly\r\neveryone knows, however, that this can be overcome simply by refusing\r\nto pay any attention to the idle fears that come over us as a\r\nconsequence of the tension due to loneliness, and after a time,\r\nsleeping in a strange room and a strange house in the dark is not a\r\ndifficult matter. It is harder for some people to accomplish than\r\nothers, but it is impossible for none. Here is the lesson that all the\r\nsufferers from dreads must learn. Gradually, quietly, persistently,\r\nthey must resist the dreads that come over them, must deliberately,\r\nwithout excitement, do the opposite to that suggested by their\r\napprehension, until habits are formed that enable them to accomplish\r\nwithout discomfort what was before a source of even serious\r\nill-feeling.\r\n\r\nThe dread of darkness that so many people have is usually supposed to\r\nbe cowardice. It is not, however, in most cases, but is due to\r\nidiosyncrasy or to certain special physical factors in the\r\nenvironment. If children have been brought up so that when they were\r\nsmall a light has been constantly shining in their eyes, even though\r\nonly a dim light, it will often be difficult to accustom them to be\r\nquite comfortable in the dark. Much depends on habit in this matter. I\r\nhave known men, who, when they came from Ireland, feared the darkness\r\nof the coal mines very much and their dread was increased by the awful\r\nhorror of possible ghostly appearances, since so many accidents had\r\ntaken place where they worked. After some years, however, they were\r\nquite placid about it and would calmly go into the mine as fire bosses\r\nat three and four in the morning, long before others were to go in,\r\nexamining absolutely dark passages by the mile, with no human being\r\nnear them and with the creaking of the pillars, the dripping of water,\r\nthe rumbling of the sides and the occasional fall of a small particle\r\nfrom the roof, besides the noises of rats to add to the disturbing\r\nfactors. Like going up on a high building, one may get entirely\r\naccustomed to it so as scarcely to notice it at all.\r\n\r\nWhen the fear is allowed to take hold of one, however, and no effort\r\nis made to overcome it, it may prove quite seriously disturbing. The\r\nunaccustomed, however, means more than anything else in this matter.\r\nSometimes, {621} indeed, people have a dread of the dark that seems to\r\nbe inborn and that apparently cannot be overcome, that, like the fear\r\nof cats or of lightning, may be quite beyond rational control. Hobbes,\r\nthe English philosopher, was so perturbed by darkness that he kept a\r\nlight in his bedroom all night. I know this to be the case in a\r\nclergyman who had been quite undisturbed about darkness until he was\r\nawakened one night by a burglar. He demanded \"who's there?\" and\r\nreceived as answer without further parley a bullet that fortunately\r\nstruck only the head of the bed, but so close that it singed him. The\r\nburglar escaped, but the clergyman was never afterwards able to sleep\r\nwithout a light. Rousseau, the French philosopher, was also much\r\nafraid of darkness. Ordinarily it is presumed that superstition has\r\nsomething to do with this fear and that the victim of it has ghosts in\r\nmind or at least dreads spirit manifestations. Neither Hobbes nor\r\nRousseau, however, was likely to be timorous about ghostly visitants.\r\nIt was with them a physical idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nAssociated with dread of darkness is the fear of finding some one in a\r\ndark room whose presence may startle us. Sir Samuel Romilly, famous\r\nfor his labors for the reform of the English criminal law, and who\r\nmust be considered one of the great humanitarians of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, had this dread to an acute degree. It went so far that\r\nwhenever he slept in a strange place he carefully examined all the\r\npossible hiding-places in the room and in wardrobes or closets\r\nconnected with it and, as a last precaution, never failed to look\r\nunder the bed. He did this even when he was in his own house.\r\n[Footnote 49] This, however, is not so unusual, even among men, as\r\nmight be thought. Most women who sleep alone want to investigate under\r\nthe bed and in a hotel closets and wardrobes and even bureau drawers\r\nare likely to be examined. Habit in this regard may make one quite\r\nmiserable and over-solicitous. I have had patients whose sleep was\r\nseriously disturbed by the remembrance that they had not looked under\r\nthe bed and who feared to get up and light a light to do so lest there\r\nshould be someone there. Indeed, the idea of putting their feet on the\r\nfloor before the light had come to reassure them seemed quite out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 49:  Curiously enough. Sir Samuel Romilly, in spite of his\r\n  dread of the dark, committed suicide and went prematurely into the\r\n  darkness of the beyond, apparently without his usual tendency to\r\n  precaution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDreads Connected with Water.--Strange as it may seem, water\r\nconstitutes a source of dread for some people. We have the records of\r\nit in the peculiarities of great men and it is not unusual to meet it\r\nin common life. Dropping water is a source of disturbance for most\r\npeople. It is quite impossible for the majority of men and women to go\r\non writing or reading with any comfort if water is dropping near them.\r\nDropping water, when one is trying to go to sleep, is one of the worst\r\nof awakeners. The Chinese are said to put people to death in horrible\r\ntorture by having a drop of water fall at regular intervals on their\r\nheads. Robert Boyle, the great father of chemistry and a very sensible\r\nman in many ways, is said to have been thrown into convulsions by the\r\nsound of water dropping from a faucet. The splashing of water on some\r\npeople is a poignant source of torture. I have had a woman patient who\r\ncould not go to services where there was a sprinkling of water, for it\r\nseriously disturbed her and gave her a sense of depression that would\r\nnot be overcome for some time. Peter the Great, though the father of\r\nthe {622} Russian navy, and though he passed many years of his life in\r\nHolland, used to shudder at the sight of water, and if, when out\r\ndriving, his carriage passed near a stream or over a bridge, he would\r\nclose the windows and be overtaken with terror that brought the\r\nperspiration out all over him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Death.--The fear of death is one of the dreads that bothers\r\nyoung as well as old, and, curiously enough, as its inevitable\r\napproach becomes more certain, men are prone to dread it more. Long\r\nago Sophocles said:\r\n\r\n  None cleave to life so fondly as the old,\r\n\r\n-- and this has remained true for all the centuries since. A young man\r\nis quite ready to throw his life away, but the old man hesitates and\r\neven in the midst of suffering, if it is not absolutely continuous,\r\ncraves that death shall not come. Sophocles' great rival, the elder\r\nGreek dramatic poet AEschylus, had said:\r\n\r\n  How far from just the hate men bear to death\r\n  Which comes as safeguard against many ills,\r\n\r\n-- but his message was only for those with the character to face the\r\nworst. One may reason with the dread of death, however, and patients\r\ncan be given motives from philosophy, literature, religion and\r\nexperience that will help to relieve, though it will not entirely cure\r\nthem. Shakespeare said in \"Julius Caesar\":\r\n\r\n  Cowards die many times before their deaths.\r\n  The valiant never taste of death but once,\r\n\r\n-- and people may be aroused to appreciate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fear of Early Death_.--Many fear that if they have shown symptoms of\r\ndelicacy of constitution at some time in life or suffered severely\r\nfrom some serious disease, that they are not likely to live long and,\r\nabove all, that they are almost sure not to be able to accomplish\r\nanything worth while in life. The old proverb is \"a healthy mind in a\r\nhealthy body.\" This is, however, the ideal. There are very few ideals\r\nrealized in life. Just because a man has a weak body is no argument at\r\nall that his mind may be weak and some of the world's finest work has\r\nbeen accomplished by men whose bodies were always delicate.\r\nMetchnikoff is the apostle of old age to our generation, but it is he,\r\nalso, who has pointed out that many distinguished workers in science,\r\nin poetry, in art, men who have left a precious heritage in succeeding\r\ngenerations, were delicate all their lives. He cites such typical\r\nexamples as Fresnel, the great French physicist; Giacomo Leopardi, the\r\ndistinguished Italian poet; Weber and Schumann, the great German\r\nmusicians, and Chopin, the Polish composer and pianist, all of whom\r\ndid work that the world would not willingly miss, in spite of delicacy\r\nof health and weakness of body which shortened their lives.\r\nIntellectual power is not dependent on bodily energy and\r\naccomplishment is not a question of years of work, but intensity of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to add many other names to those mentioned\r\nby Metchnikoff. Naturally his thoughts recurred to men of distinction\r\non {623} the Continent, but in English-speaking countries we have a\r\nnumber of typical examples of strong minds doing fine work in weak\r\nbodies. Robert Louis Stevenson is the best remembered by our\r\ngeneration. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, delicate all of her life, a\r\nneurasthenic during the precious adolescent years that are supposed to\r\nmean so much for future accomplishment, always an invalid to some\r\ndegree at least, did some of the best work that was given to any woman\r\nto do during the nineteenth century. J. Addington Symonds, the\r\nhistorian of the Renaissance and of Italian literature, is another\r\nstriking example of a man who had to do his work under great physical\r\ndifficulties, yet who left a long bookshelf of large volumes after him\r\nas the product of the hours that he could cheat from caring for his\r\nhealth. Henry Harland, whose recent death all too young was a blow to\r\nthe English-speaking world, is another striking example. The names of\r\nsuch men and women and their stories must be made familiar to people\r\nwho are themselves delicate in health and who fear for their future\r\nand, above all, are despondent about the possibility of ever doing\r\nanything worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Insanity.--People who have relatives who are already\r\nsufferers from such severe forms of insanity as require asylum\r\ntreatment are often likely to be much disturbed over the possibility\r\nthat they themselves should become insane. Of course, there is no\r\ndoubt but that these people are much more liable to suffer from\r\ninsanity than others, but their worrying over the matter is sure to do\r\nthem harm rather than good. There are quite enough sources of worry in\r\nlife without the additional one of dread of a future event that may\r\nnot occur, and this must be made as clear to them as possible. The\r\npeople who have no obligations on them, who have nothing to do that\r\nthey feel they have to do, are especially likely to suffer from such\r\nobsessions. The best possible relief for them is afforded, not by the\r\neffort not to worry about their dread, which usually has exactly the\r\nopposite effect and emphasizes their fear by the constant effort which\r\nthey make to put it aside, but by getting something else to interest\r\nthem. This must not be merely a passing interest, if possible, but a\r\nserious attraction of some kind that fully occupies the mind. A hobby\r\nis an excellent thing for this, but alas! a hobby must be cultivated\r\nfor many years, as a rule, to become powerful enough to bring relief\r\nin such serious matters.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the thought of the insane asylum or the sight of an\r\ninstitution of this kind passed even at a distance in the train is\r\nenough to give some people a fit of depression that may last for some\r\ntime. The thought of going to visit their ailing relatives is enough\r\nto make them even more depressed. I have sometimes found that in\r\nchosen cases, especially among women and those of sympathetic\r\ndisposition, the apparently heroic remedy of making them visit their\r\nrelatives in the asylum was excellent for them. It is the usual rule\r\nfor people who are themselves sane to consider that it is the greatest\r\nhardship of asylum confinement for the patients to be associated with\r\nthose whom they recognize to be insane. Exactly the opposite effect is\r\nthe usual result. To be among people, many of whom are more irrational\r\nthan themselves and some of whom are quite beside themselves, proves a\r\nstimulus and an encouragement. Contentment has been defined by a cynic\r\nas the feeling that things might be worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n{624}\r\n\r\nDREADS OF MEN OF GENIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insane are particularly prone to suffer from dreads, so that some\r\npeople argue from their dreads to the thought of insanity. It is quite\r\na mistake, however, to think of dreads as necessarily connected with\r\ninsanity in any way. They are irrational though they will commonly be\r\nfound to be dependent on some special physical condition. This is\r\nusually some exaggeration of attention to a sensation natural enough\r\nin itself but disturbing when dwelt on to such a degree that it\r\nproduces a much greater reaction in these individuals than in other\r\npeople. These dreads have existed in all sorts of people. It is said\r\nthat they are more frequent in the highly intellectual, especially in\r\nthe class known as geniuses, and they are often said to represent the\r\ndefinite evidence of a relationship between genius and insanity. I\r\nhave always felt, however, that they are quite as common among\r\nordinary people who have no genius and no signs of it as among the\r\nso-called geniuses. They are not so much spoken of by ordinary people,\r\nhowever, because they are rather ashamed of them. Genius, on the\r\ncontrary, is quite willing, as a rule, to exploit its peculiarities\r\nfor the benefit of the public, or what is even more true, its\r\npeculiarities are remembered and commented on as details of history.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind the following paragraph from Dr. Dorland's book on\r\n\"The Ages of Mental Virility\"   [Footnote 50] deserves to be\r\nrecalled. He has gathered a number of examples that are very\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The Century Co., New York, 1908]\r\n\r\n  Fear has played an important role in the development of the\r\n  antipathies of the great--fear that was often groundless in its\r\n  origin and inexplicable in its manifestation. The unaccountable fear\r\n  of dogs is not so common as ailurophobia, although it is said that\r\n  De Musset cordially detested them, and Goethe despised them,\r\n  notwithstanding, forsooth, he kept a tame snake. Much more frequent\r\n  is the fear of spiders, centipedes, and other insects. Charles\r\n  Kingsley, thorough naturalist though he was, entertained an\r\n  unconquerable horror of spiders, even the common house spider;\r\n  Turenne became weak when he saw a spider; while the author of the\r\n  \"Turkish Spy\" once asserted that he would far prefer, with sword in\r\n  hand, \"to face a lion in his desert lair than to have a spider crawl\r\n  over him in the dark.\" Lord Lauderdale, on the contrary, while\r\n  declaring that the mewing of a cat was \"sweeter to him than any\r\n  music,\" had a most intense dislike for the flute and the bag-pipe;\r\n  and Dr. Johnson was so fond of his cats that he would personally buy\r\n  oysters for them, his servants being too proud to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are curious contradictions to be found in these matters.\r\nMontaigne confesses that he did his best writing and was in the best\r\nhumor for keeping at his Essays while stroking his favorite cat with\r\nhis left hand, his other being occupied with his writing. This would\r\nbe seriously disturbing to many people, but apparently occupied\r\ncertain distracting sensory tendencies and enabled him to concentrate\r\nhis mental energies. To many people the very thought of doing anything\r\nlike this would put all ideas for writing out of their mind. Other of\r\nMontaigne's peculiarities are quite as interesting. He always refused\r\nto sit down with thirteen at table, his liking for odd numbers was so\r\ngreat that he made all sorts of excuses in order not to use {625} even\r\nnumbers and his aversion for Friday made the quota of work that he\r\ncould do on that day much less than any other day of the week.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSESSIONS\r\n\r\nThere are many curious obsessions that disturb people and that are\r\noften extremely difficult of explanation even by themselves. Dr.\r\nJohnson, one of the most sensible men in many ways in his time in\r\nEngland, could not, it is said, pass a post on the street without\r\ntouching it. At least if he did so he felt that somehow he had omitted\r\nto do something that he ought to have done and it would make him\r\nuncomfortable. There are many people who have some idea that it is\r\nlucky to touch posts as they pass along and the number of people who\r\ndo things like this is larger than might be imagined. Many people put\r\nthemselves out of the way in order to avoid letting a post come\r\nbetween the person with whom they are walking and themselves because\r\nit is said to be unlucky. Most of them will laugh at it, but still\r\nthey continue the practice in spite of the bother it may occasion\r\nthem. Occasionally there is some incident in their past life which\r\naccounts for such obsessions, though the patients themselves are\r\noccasionally not quite conscious of them. Dr. Boris Sidis tells the\r\nstory of a man who could not take a car with an odd number.\r\nPsycho-analysis showed that he had once seen a child run down by an\r\nodd-numbered car.\r\n\r\nIn such cases there has been a long series of suggestions that have\r\ncreated a dominant state of mind. The only way to overcome this when\r\nit becomes a serious annoyance is to undo the influence of the\r\nsuggestions by a continued series of counter-suggestions, and by such\r\ndiscipline of mind as will prevent the former suggestion from exerting\r\nitself. The cure can be accomplished in this way, though, as a rule,\r\nthe patient will need the help of someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGOTTEN FRIGHTS AND DREADS\r\n\r\nDreads founded on terrifying or seriously disturbing incidents of the\r\npast, the details of which at times have gone out of the patient's\r\nmind, are not infrequent. It is probable that many of the unreasoning\r\ndreads have some such foundation and occasionally, if patients'\r\nmemories are carefully searched, the whole story can be reconstructed.\r\nAll that is needed, as a rule, is to get the patients interested in\r\nconjunction with the physician in tracing the origin of their\r\naffliction and not infrequently an interesting story will turn up.\r\nHypnosis used to be considered of great value for such\r\nreconstructions, but unfortunately patients then become so suggestible\r\nthat it is often difficult to decide how much of what is brought out\r\nby questioning is due to the suggestive quality that cannot well be\r\nkept out of questions, and how much to a true redintegration of\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nFrights in children may for a time be forgotten and yet the memory of\r\nthem may come back, or a dread connected with them develop, that will\r\nmake the patient profoundly miserable. One of my patients slipped and\r\nfell on a smooth steel plate at the head of a coal breaker and was\r\nonly saved by good fortune from falling a long distance. This happened\r\nwhen he was a {626} boy of ten. There were times when the memory of\r\nthis recurred so vividly as to set him all atremble and he could not\r\nlook down from a height without something of the feeling of goneness\r\ncoming over him that he felt at the time of the accident. The calling\r\nof his attention to the fact that his memory probably exaggerated the\r\ndanger he had been in as a boy led him to go back and have another\r\nlook at the conditions in which he had fallen some thirty years\r\nbefore. He found that they were not so dangerous as he thought and\r\nthat while he would have been scratched and his clothes would probably\r\nhave been soiled and torn, he would not have been seriously injured.\r\nThis has greatly diminished his dread of heights.\r\n\r\nVarious physical manifestations may be due to dreads which are often\r\nsupposed to be the result of some physical process in the nervous\r\nsystem. Occasional fits of trembling, for instance, are, in sensitive\r\npeople, due to more or less forgotten memories of dangers or frights.\r\nOccasionally even slight convulsive seizures may follow such recurrent\r\ndreads. Not a few of the cases of so-called hystero-epilepsy in the\r\nborderland between hysteria and epilepsy but always one or the other,\r\nare due to such mental states rather than to any physical conditions.\r\nSuch incomplete memories are sometimes spoken of as subconscious. The\r\nword subconscious has been so much abused, however, that I prefer not\r\nto use it. The reminiscences have been obscured by an accumulation of\r\nother facts but may with an effort of attention and concentration of\r\nmind be recalled. Hypnosis, or the milder form of it spoken of as the\r\nhypnoidal state, may enable the patient to recall them more vividly by\r\nenabling him to concentrate his attention, but there are always risks\r\nthat suggestion will vitiate the old story in these cases. With care\r\nall the details can usually be recalled and the patient is thus given\r\nrenewed confidence in himself and his own powers and does not learn to\r\nlean on someone else in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nThe most important psychotherapeutic factor for the relief of the\r\ndiscomfort due to dreads is the knowledge that there are so many and\r\nsuch different varieties of them and that so many people suffer from\r\nthem. Many of those afflicted are inclined to think that their cases\r\nare almost unique. To have them know that there are all forms and\r\nphases of these curious aversions is to make them laugh a little at\r\ntheir own because they laugh so readily at others, and it gives them\r\nnew courage for the attempt to conquer them. The aversion cannot be\r\nentirely overcome, but it can be prevented from seriously influencing\r\nsleep or appetite or occupation. This is after all the important\r\nfeature of the case from the standpoint of psychotherapy. Besides,\r\npatients are encouraged not only to take up, but, above all, to\r\ncontinue, the practice of that mental discipline and self-control\r\nwhich will enable them to lessen their natural aversion, if not to\r\nremove it entirely. I have many cases in which patients' aversions\r\nhave been entirely overcome. Curiously enough, there are rather often\r\nrelapses when the patients are run down in weight, or are in an\r\nirritable condition from worry or emotional stress, and then something\r\nof the former mental discipline has to be reinstituted to make them\r\nonce more free from disturbance.\r\n\r\n{627}\r\n\r\nI have sometimes found that the recommendation to patients suffering\r\nfrom dreads to read Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" has\r\nproved an excellent therapeutic agent. This is particularly true when\r\nthe patients are women, for it is likely to bring them close to the\r\nsad lives of the Shelleys. The circumstances in which the book was\r\nwritten add to the appeal. \"Frankenstein\" itself is interesting, so\r\nthat the mood created by this combination of interests is excellently\r\ntherapeutic. It will be recalled that in \"Frankenstein\" the inventor\r\nseeking to make a man does make an automaton that is able to move and\r\nto talk, but that then haunts its inventor, demanding of him a soul.\r\nIt proves a plague to him, but he cannot escape from it. Fly where he\r\nwill his creation follows him and bothers the life out of him, killing\r\na friend, strangling his bride, and making existence intolerable. The\r\nsymbol is complete and to the point. The things that bother us in life\r\nare to a great extent of our own invention. The dreads that make so\r\nmany people miserable are practically always without any groundwork in\r\nreality, figments of our imagination without the soul of real life,\r\nbut capable, as was Frankenstein's monster, of making their creators\r\nintensely miserable and with them, to an even greater degree, their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHEREDITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many false and, indeed, from a scientific standpoint,\r\nutterly groundless notions with regard to heredity which, as a result\r\nof the popularization of science, have become widely diffused, that\r\nnotions about inheritance are a most copious source of dreads and\r\ndiscouragement and even produce inhibition of resistive vitality\r\nagainst disease on the part of many patients. At first it seemed to me\r\nas though the subject should be treated in the chapter on Dreads. It\r\nis so much more important than the other dreads, however, and there\r\nare so many people with so many different notions as to the evil\r\ninfluence of heredity that it seems advisable to devote a special\r\nchapter to it in which to provide contrary suggestion. Many patients\r\nare constantly suggesting to themselves that, because they are\r\nsuffering from certain symptoms due to real or supposed hereditary\r\nconditions, there is little or no hope of their recovery or of any\r\neffective relief. In the old days, when tuberculosis was considered to\r\nbe hereditary, it was almost hopeless to try to rouse patients into a\r\nstate of vital resistance to their disease because of this overhanging\r\ndread. Such a prepossession of mind must be overcome.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that has been said about the power for evil of\r\nheredity, and in this as in every other phase of pseudo-science, the\r\nreason why there are false popular notions is because the medical\r\nprofession first cherished them and then they spread popularly, we now\r\nknow that it means comparatively little in pathology. The false\r\nnotions will continue, however, to be popularly diffused probably for\r\nanother generation, at least, and will have to be combated. Their\r\nforce must be lessened, for they are a heavy incubus on the patient's\r\nmind, imposing a burden on vitality that inhibits normal, vital\r\nreaction. This can only be done by a frank and complete statement of\r\n{628} our present knowledge of heredity, which is even yet not nearly\r\nso definite as we would like to have it, but which contradicts\r\nentirely most of the older impressions. In the matter of disease what\r\nwe know of heredity, instead of being a source of distress and\r\ndiscouragement for patients, provides rather new incentives for\r\nvigorous reaction, since nature helps rather than hampers the effort\r\nof the individual to throw off disease from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Impressions and Expression.--Probably the commonest expressions\r\nthat the physician hears from his patients, though we hear many\r\nstereotyped phrases in our time when patients so freely discuss their\r\nills and their physicians' opinions among themselves, are such as: \"My\r\nfather suffered from rheumatism, and I suppose I must expect to be\r\nbothered by the same ailment.\" \"My mother died of heart disease and I\r\nthink I have a weak heart; I suppose that we have weak hearts in the\r\nfamily.\" \"I have had three relatives die of cancer in the last three\r\ngenerations, so I presume that cancer is in the family, or at least we\r\nare much more liable to cancer than the generality of people.\" And,\r\nfinally, what used to be the commonest of all, but fortunately we have\r\nchanged that at least, though we sometimes hear it still:\r\n\"Tuberculosis runs in our family, my mother and an uncle died of it\r\nand one of my brothers is suffering from it, so I suppose I must just\r\nmake up my mind that I, too, am sure to get it.\" Even the rarer\r\naffections, like kidney disease, liver disease, various nervous\r\ntroubles, stomach and intestinal disturbances of many kinds,\r\nflatulence, constipation or diarrhea, are all supposed to be\r\nhereditary and patients explain their ill feelings by an appeal to the\r\nsupposed principle of heredity and its application to themselves and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nIn many chapters in this book the subject of heredity has been\r\nconsidered with regard to specific affections. We have no evidence at\r\nall, or the evidence is so trivial as to be quite negligible, that\r\nanything acquired by the individual, be it for good or evil, is ever\r\ntransmitted to the next generation. That acquired characters are not\r\ntransmitted is now almost a universally accepted principle among\r\nbiologists. The more a biologist knows of recent biological research\r\nand investigation the more will he be likely to consider this\r\nprinciple of the non-transmission of acquirements as definitely\r\nsettled. According to this, then, no disease is ever transmitted to\r\nthe next generation. This is such a complete reversal of former\r\nopinions, such an open contradiction of popular beliefs, that the\r\nsubject merits thorough discussion from this newer standpoint for\r\nmedical applications. We must not forget that popular medicine, even\r\nwhen egregiously wrong, is founded on opinions held by the medical\r\nprofession aforetime and, indeed, on this subject of heredity many of\r\nthe medical profession still cling to the former opinion.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, which used to furnish the most serious argument in this\r\nmatter, has now come to be the best possible explanation that we have\r\nfor the fallacy of the transmission of anything acquired. The disease\r\nfollowed families so constantly that it seemed impossible to explain\r\nit unless the principle of its heredity was conceded. Now that we know\r\nits contagiousness, however, it is comparatively easy to explain its\r\noccurrence in families. When we recall how carelessly people coughed\r\nand even expectorated around the house, while children crept on the\r\nfloors and carried the germs of the disease to their mouths on their\r\nhands, the wonder is, not that so many members of the family acquired\r\nthe disease seeing the manifold opportunities for contagion, but that\r\n{629} any of them ever escaped. We know now that practically every\r\nadult above the age of thirty either has or has had tuberculosis.\r\nCareful autopsies show us remains of the disease even in the bodies of\r\nthose who, without any history of tuberculosis, die from other\r\ndiseases. One out of eight of the population dies of tuberculosis, but\r\nthe remaining seven are quite capable of resisting the disease and so\r\nwe find healed lesions at autopsies in this proportion of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily History Favorable.--It is certain, then, that tuberculosis is\r\nnot hereditary. On the contrary, as we have learned more about the\r\ndisease in recent years, it has been recognized by specialists that\r\npatients who have a family history of tuberculosis are notably less\r\nlikely to succumb to the disease early than those who have no such\r\nhistory. An acute case of tuberculosis with considerable loss of\r\nweight has a very unfavorable prognosis unless there is a history of\r\nthe disease in the preceding generation, when at once the outlook\r\nbecomes more hopeful. This newer view is confirmed by what we have\r\nlearned from the ethnological pathology of the disease. Peoples\r\nexposed to the disease for the first time rapidly succumb to it. This\r\nis practically true for all the infectious diseases. Our American\r\nIndians succumbed in large numbers not only to tuberculosis but also\r\nto smallpox and even to measles when each was first introduced among\r\nthem. The same thing was true in the South Sea Islands. Where nations\r\nhave been exposed to the disease for some time they have acquired not\r\nan immunity, but at least they possess a greater resistive vitality to\r\nits ravages and while they still may be susceptible they are not so\r\nsubject to the fatal forms of the disease, and even if they acquire it\r\nthey live on for many years.\r\n\r\nMany people may insist that this immunity or comparative immunity to\r\ntuberculosis and increased resistive vitality against the disease is\r\ntransmitted and illustrates the principle of heredity. The reaction of\r\nthe system to the disease increases in each generation and this\r\nincrease is an acquired character which passes down with the family\r\nstrain. This immunity should be viewed from another standpoint,\r\nhowever. Certain families possess a resistive vitality to the disease;\r\nothers lack it. The resistant families do not succumb to it, and\r\npropagate themselves. The others gradually die out. What caused the\r\nresistant families originally to possess this quality we do not know.\r\nWe have no trace of its being acquired. Like so many other characters\r\nby which men differ from one another, we do not know the beginning of\r\nit. Once it comes in as a family trait it is transmitted. In\r\nsuccessive generations we have no evidence that it is stronger, only\r\nthe danger is recognized from experience and better precautions are\r\ntaken; the consequence is that the original resistive vitality has a\r\nbetter chance to make itself felt and so the family is preserved. This\r\nis as true with regard to the conquest of the tendency to excess in\r\nthe taking of toxic substances, as alcohol and opium, as with regard\r\nto disease. It is not the transmission of an acquired character, but\r\nthe descent of a family trait the origin of which we do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereditary Syphilis.--Many physicians will protest that, at least, we\r\nhave ample evidence for the transmission of syphilis by heredity. We\r\nhave for many years talked of hereditary syphilis as if it were\r\nabsolutely sure that its transmission by inheritance took place. There\r\nis no doubt, of course, that the disease is conveyed from mother to\r\nchild. If a mother is actively syphilitic, {630} then her child will\r\nsurely have syphilis when it is born. This, however, is no argument\r\nfor the hereditary transmission of syphilis. We know now that if a\r\nmother is tuberculous, in an active stage of that disease, her child\r\nwill almost surely have the disease, but this is a question of\r\ncontagion not of inheritance. If a mother with active tuberculosis\r\nnurses her child she is likely to give it tuberculosis. Usually the\r\nidea is that the milk is not infective unless there are tuberculous\r\nlesions in the breasts, and in cattle it is well known that such\r\nlesions in the milk apparatus inevitably bring tubercle bacilli into\r\nthe milk. The demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the blood of\r\npatients in the active stage of the disease is now much more frequent\r\nthan used to be the case and there seems no doubt that the bacillus\r\ncan pass through glandular structures into the secretions.\r\n\r\nIn the same way syphilitic nurses are likely to infect nurslings,\r\nthough, of course, in this case there are usually syphilitic sores on\r\nthe nipples which directly communicate the disease. It is almost\r\nimpossible for a syphilitic woman to nurse a child, if she is in an\r\nactive stage of the disease, without the production of such infective\r\nsores on her nipples. When children are born with syphilis it means\r\nonly that in the process of feeding the child through the placental\r\ntissues, a mother has infected her child quite as she might infect it\r\nby nursing afterwards, in case she acquired syphilis after the birth.\r\nLesions corresponding to those on the nipple occur in placental\r\ntissues and can be demonstrated without much difficulty. Congenital\r\nsyphilis, however, can always be traced to contagion and the being\r\nborn with the disease or having the manifestations of it occur shortly\r\nafter birth is no argument for heredity at all. It merely emphasizes\r\nthe danger of contagion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mothers of Syphilitic Children_.--But there are some cases in which\r\nthe child who shows symptoms of syphilis after birth is born from a\r\nmother who never had any manifestations of syphilis and therefore it\r\nhas been supposed that the infection must have come from the sperm,\r\nand that in these cases, at least, there is a true heredity. It is\r\nperfectly possible, however, that syphilitic infective material may\r\naccompany the spermatozoon and so bring about the occurrence of\r\nsyphilis in the offspring. Even this would be infection, however, and\r\nnot heredity. Much more frequently it would seem that the disease in\r\nthe infant was contracted from the mother while suffering from a\r\nlatent form of syphilis, rather than from the paternal contributory\r\nparticle to its existence. The mother gives no sign of the disease,\r\nbut Colles' Law is that the mother of a syphilitic child may, without\r\ndanger to herself, be allowed to nurse her own infant even though she\r\nherself has never had any symptoms. This can only mean that she is\r\nthoroughly protected against the disease. We would not think for a\r\nmoment of allowing an ordinarily healthy women to nurse a syphilitic\r\nchild. Such immunity in the mother of the syphilitic child can only\r\ncome, so far as the present state of our knowledge goes, from her\r\nhaving had the disease. It has been said that as the result of the\r\nintimate communication with her child in utero she has acquired an\r\nimmunity by the passage across the placental membrane which separates\r\nmaternal and fetal blood of protective substances of various kinds due\r\nto the reaction against the disease already beginning in the child. As\r\na matter of fact, however, there is no evidence of any such reactive\r\nsubstances in the blood of the child which after birth proceeds to\r\nhave a series of acute lesions that are, as a rule, indicative {631}\r\nof almost complete lack of resistive vitality. Maternal immunity is\r\nevidently due to the occurrence of the disease in some form within the\r\nmaternal tissues which produces the usual protection against the\r\ndisease in a briefer time than usual. This certainly seems to be a\r\nmore satisfactory explanation than that of a transmission of an\r\nimmunity from the child to the mother which the child itself does not\r\npossess. It is easier to understand the transmission of an infection\r\nthat does not manifest itself externally than of an immunity which\r\nthere has been no time to acquire. Both explanations leave a mystery,\r\nbut the mystery in the second case can be explained more in consonance\r\nwith what we know about syphilitic transmission and immunity than in\r\nthe other case. It does away with the transmission directly from the\r\nfather almost completely, of course, leaves practically no ground for\r\nthe heredity of syphilis, but it accords much better than older\r\nexplanations with biological principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Late Lesions and Heredity_.--Many physicians will be likely to insist\r\nthat the late developments of syphilis in children, in which not only\r\nthree or five years afterwards, but even fifteen or twenty years after\r\nbirth, there are syphilitic manifestations, are beyond all doubt\r\nexamples of heredity. In the last twenty-five years, however, our\r\nideas with regard to the after-effects of syphilis have been entirely\r\nmodified by what we have learned of such diseases as locomotor ataxia,\r\nparesis and the like. These are undoubtedly parasyphilitic diseases in\r\nmost cases, yet they not infrequently develop from ten to twenty years\r\nafter any manifestation of syphilis and they seem to occur, by\r\npreference almost, in cases where the preliminary symptoms have been\r\nvery mild. In not a few cases, indeed, the symptoms of syphilis have\r\nbeen so transient in these patients that the true significance of them\r\nwas missed until the later developments showed their real character.\r\nKrafft-Ebing, at the International Medical Congress at Moscow in 1897,\r\ndetailed some experiments that he had made on paretics in Vienna. They\r\nwere patients in whom no history of syphilis could be found, yet they\r\nwere suffering from typical paresis. As they were in the ultimate\r\nstage of the disease it did not seem unjustifiable to inoculate them\r\nwith syphilis, and in most cases it was found that they would not take\r\nthe disease, showing that they were probably protected by a previous\r\nattack, though there was no history of it.\r\n\r\nThe development of the late symptoms of syphilis in the second\r\ngeneration can then be much more satisfactorily explained on the basis\r\nof a mild infection with very few primary symptoms, almost lacking in\r\nsecondary symptoms, yet followed by subsequent symptoms of great\r\nseverity consequent upon the deterioration of vitality produced by the\r\ndisease. As for the manifestations in the third generation, they are\r\nnot directly syphilitic, but are, whenever they occur, due to\r\nconditions consequent upon the degeneration that had been effected in\r\nthe preceding generation and which directly weakened the offspring--on\r\nthe same principle that weak parents give birth to weak children, and\r\nstarving parents cannot have strong, healthy children--but not because\r\nof any direct influence of the disease. It is worth while to discuss\r\nthis subject from this standpoint, since it disposes of the only\r\nsupposed evidence left for the hereditary transmission of disease that\r\nwe now have, though only a few years ago most diseases were supposed\r\nto be hereditary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity in Cancer.--With regard to other diseases, the evidence for\r\nany inheritance has been founded entirely on coincidence. All the\r\nhuman race {632} dies and must die some way, and so in families a\r\ncertain number will die of the same disease. The argument for heredity\r\nin cancer is extremely weak. When all the relatives of a person\r\nafflicted with cancer as far out as the third generation are taken\r\ninto account, only about one in five of them are found to have\r\nsuffered from cancer. When we remember, however, that more than one in\r\nthirty of all those who die, die of cancer and that the death-rate of\r\nthis disease is greater than that of typhoid fever, smallpox, scarlet\r\nfever, measles, and all other infectious diseases put together, it is\r\neasy to understand how large a role coincidence plays in any such set\r\nof statistics, and how little the significance of the occurrence of\r\ncancer in different members of the same family means, unless possibly\r\nthere is an occasional element of contagiousness which must not be\r\nleft out of the reckoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity in Other Affections.--Other ailments present much less\r\npossibility or probability of any element of heredity. For instance,\r\nover-indulgence in meat or drink may readily bring about various\r\nailments of the gastro-intestinal tract. These are, of course,\r\ndefinitely acquired conditions, some of them temporary and some\r\npersistent, that will continue to give trouble so long as the patient\r\ncontinues to produce irritation of them. They may, of course, lead to\r\npermanent pathological conditions. To say that any of these are likely\r\nto be inherited would be quite as absurd as to say that a corn could\r\nbe inherited, or the permanent deformities produced in toes by wearing\r\nbadly-fitting shoes could be transmitted to the next generation. We do\r\nnot think for a moment that because a man has lost a finger his\r\nchildren are likely to be born without a finger, and still less if by\r\nsome accident or abuse he has been deprived of the use of an arm or\r\nleg, that that is likely to be transmitted to the next generation. Yet\r\npeople calmly talk of the heredity of similarly produced conditions\r\nwithin the body, and even physicians are not entirely free from the\r\nsuperstition, for such it is, of the influence of heredity in\r\nproducing pathological conditions.\r\n\r\nHabits of various kinds, physical and mental, are calmly accepted by\r\nmany people as influenced by or having their origin in heredity. Under\r\nAlcoholism and Drug Addictions we have discussed this phase of the\r\nsubject, but a word or two more may make it clearer. A tendency to\r\nform the same habits may be a family trait and descend from one\r\ngeneration to another. That a specific habit should be the subject of\r\nheredity or transmission is as much out of the question as that a\r\nfacility for doing anything should be transmitted. The son of an\r\nacrobat must practice quite as faithfully as did his father in order\r\nto secure his father's skill. He may inherit from his father that\r\nparticular constitution of body, that specific combination of muscle\r\nand sinew and bone that enables him to become an acrobat by practice,\r\nthough with a different kind of body it would be impossible, but his\r\nfather's acquired facility influences in no way the son's ability. We\r\noften hear of a man being the descendant of a series of generations\r\neach of whom has gone to the university, as if that somehow assured\r\nhim a readier and better facility for education, but we know very well\r\nthat this is not true and that the boys straight from the soil are\r\noften the best students and far ahead of the scions of long-time\r\nacademic families.\r\n\r\n\r\nInheritance of Defects.--Acquired characters are not transmitted,\r\nthough family traits are the subject of inheritance. Disease is not\r\nhereditary, but {633} defect is. Crossed eyes occur very commonly in\r\nfamilies and are evidently a subject of transmission. Family noses are\r\noften very peculiar and may be traced for many generations. The\r\nHapsburg lip has been noted in sixty per cent. of the Hapsburgs since\r\nthe family came into prominence in the thirteenth century. Features of\r\nall kinds are inherited, as anyone who has ever spent some time in a\r\nfamily portrait gallery where the ancestors were genuine and the\r\npaintings reasonably true to life, knows very well. Certain features\r\nof European families can be traced for many generations. The tendency\r\nto have six toes or to have an extra finger runs in certain families.\r\nSo small a thing as a patch of white hair in a particular part of the\r\nhead may be the subject of hereditary transmission. Moles on a\r\nparticular part of the body are inherited. All these, however, are\r\ncharacters with regard to the acquisition of which we know nothing,\r\nbut that have somehow found their way into the family strain and have\r\nbecome subjects of transmission from generation to generation. They\r\nprovide no evidence, however, as to the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation.--What is even more surprising in biology, however, is that\r\nthere is another marvelous force at work quite as incomprehensible in\r\nits way, perhaps even more so, than that of heredity. This is\r\nvariation. All creatures have a tendency to vary from their parents. A\r\nvery small proportion of the offspring resemble parents so closely as\r\nto be quite similar. The great majority of them, however, have\r\nnoteworthy, individual, distinctive qualities. Occasionally these\r\nqualities may be traced to the less immediate ancestors and then we\r\ntalk about reversion. Occasionally there appears in a child some trait\r\nor anomaly supposed to be remotely ancestral and it is spoken of as\r\natavism. Whenever there is a tendency of the offspring of exceptional\r\nparents to regress toward the racial average, we talk of regression.\r\nTall parents often have tall children, some of them may, by a special\r\ntendency of heredity, be taller even than themselves. Most of them\r\nwill be shorter, however, and tend to regress toward the racial\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nFew people understand what a wonderful power among living things is\r\nexerted by this very opposite of heredity--variation. All the\r\npossibility of improvement not only in humanity but among all living\r\nthings is dependent on variation. It does not seem difficult to\r\nunderstand how offspring resemble parents. They are of them, therefore\r\nthey are like them. When we analyze the problem of heredity, however,\r\nand find that the connecting link between offspring and parents is\r\nalways only a single cell of less than one one-hundredth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, the mystery of heredity looms up in all its immensity. This\r\nminute bit of protoplasm, so small that it requires a rather strong\r\npower of the microscope to see it, somehow contains compressed within\r\nitself all the qualities that characterize the parent and are to be\r\ntransmitted to the offspring. Among animals, the color of the eyes and\r\nhairy covering, the form and height of the animal, its generic\r\ncharacteristics, and its individual characters--all are contained\r\nwithin this minute spherule. The white blaze on the horse's hind leg,\r\nthe black blotch on the puppy's face, the white lock on a human head,\r\nare all carried over from one generation to another with all the other\r\nqualities in this small package. That is the mystery of heredity.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added another mystery quite as great and even more\r\n{634} difficult to understand--variation. This tendency to vary is the\r\nbasis for whatever evolution there is in the world. Some living things\r\nvary in such a way as to be better suited to their environment than\r\nthey were before and then these outlive others because more favorably\r\nsituated, and natural selection brings about a maintenance of the\r\nfavorable variation. Instead, then, of patients being impressed with\r\nthe unfavorable influence of heredity, they should rather be made to\r\nfeel the weight of the idea that whatever evil tendencies the parent\r\nhas the child is more likely to have less of them than more, so that\r\nvariation tends to make the race better. We have had too much stress\r\nlaid on the heredity of unfortunate qualities and entirely too little\r\nmade of the variation tendency, which is constantly lifting the race\r\nup. It is, of course, only what happens in everything else,\r\nunfavorable are likely to have more weight than favorable suggestions,\r\nand unless these latter are emphasized their influence becomes\r\nswamped. This has happened with regard to variation. It is quite as\r\nimportant a biological element as heredity and it makes for the\r\nremoval of unfortunate qualities, yet it has never become a popular\r\nidea and is little appreciated even by physicians.\r\n\r\nPatients who are worried about their heredity will, after a frank\r\ndiscussion of our present knowledge of heredity and its co-ordinate\r\nfactor of variation, lose most of their dread of this specter of\r\nsupposed evil influence which so often proves the source of\r\ndiscouragement and failure to react properly against pathological\r\nconditions. There is probably no phase of modern biology in which the\r\nso-called popularization of science has done more harm by providing an\r\nabundant source ol unfortunate suggestions. Whatever influence\r\nheredity has in relation to disease is favorable to the human race. It\r\nis true that this is exerted by the elimination of the unfit, yet the\r\nvery consequence of this is that the children of parents who have\r\nsuffered from a particular disease are likely to have greater average\r\nresistance to it than the generality of mankind, since their parents\r\npassed the age up to reproductive activity without succumbing to it.\r\nFor cancer, tuberculosis and syphilis this teaching is of special\r\nvalue and is probably more effective than any other single means could\r\nbe to prevent the ravages of the disease if it should occur, since it\r\nkeeps the patient from interfering with his own resistive vitality by\r\nthe discouraging conviction that there is no possible hope for him\r\nbecause his parents also suffered from the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPREMONITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA state of mind that disturbs many people seriously, sometimes even\r\nproducing physical results, because of the burden of dread that hangs\r\nover them, is that in which attention is paid to premonitions of evil.\r\nThere are two of these general conditions to be considered. In the one\r\nthere is a definite feeling that some special evil, occasionally very\r\nparticularly outlined in the mind, as a railroad accident, fire, or a\r\nstreet accident of some kind, is to occur. In another mental condition\r\nthere is a generic premonition of evil, {635} as if the worst were\r\nsure to happen and the patients must be constantly preparing for it.\r\nOccasionally this takes on some such form as an assurance of early\r\nbreakdown in health, or of death at an untimely age, or of some\r\ncrippling infirmity. This represents, of course, only one form of lack\r\nof control over the mind, but it is surprising how much physical\r\nsuffering it may occasion. Only those who have had much to do with\r\npatients who suffer from this state of mind realize it. Sympathetic\r\nknowledge of the conditions that bring it about and of the real\r\nsignificance of premonitions will do more to help patients than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then newspapers tell the story of someone who had an\r\nimpending sense of danger, perhaps of a particular form of accident or\r\nmisfortune, which he could not shake off and which finally came true.\r\nSometimes it is a fire that was anticipated, though without any reason\r\nexcept the dread, and precautions that eventually proved life-saving\r\nto the patient were taken, or at least friends were told of it so that\r\nthe person seemed actually to have had some warning beforehand of the\r\ndanger that was to come. Sometimes it is the story of a railroad\r\naccident, which some particularly fortunate individual escaped,\r\nbecause of a premonition that made him take another train or make a\r\nhappy change of cars. Nothing is said of the times when premonitions\r\nfailed, nor of the disappointments of such dreads. Most people laugh\r\nat the stories, but a few individuals become seriously impressed with\r\nthe possibility of such warnings and then make themselves miserable by\r\nhaving frequent premonitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--As to the origin of these premonitions it is hard to say.\r\nThey occur more frequently on dark days than in bright weather and are\r\ncomplained of much more in spring and fall than during the cold brisk\r\nwinter or during the summer time. A succession of very hot days,\r\nhowever, brings a series of premonitions, especially with regard to\r\naccidents by heat, that is not surprising since the newspapers have\r\nmany accounts of sunstrokes and there is every suggestion of the\r\npossibility of danger of this kind. How large a role suggestion plays\r\nin the matter can be realized from the fact that after some\r\nparticularly serious railroad accident many people have premonitions\r\nthat they may be hurt and occasionally they put themselves to\r\nconsiderable inconvenience in choosing the car in which they will sit,\r\nif the last serious preceding accident of which they have heard\r\nhappens to have brought death mainly in a particular car of a train.\r\nIt is always suggestible people who are likely to have premonitions.\r\nThe thought comes very simply at first, they dwell on it a little\r\nunwillingly, then they find it impossible to banish it and finally it\r\nmay become a positive obsession. The soil and the seed for suggestion\r\nare both needed to produce premonitions.\r\n\r\nRoyce suggests that many of the supposedly fulfilled premonitions are\r\nreally only pseudo-presentiments and represent an instantaneous and\r\nirresistible hallucination of memory, which may give rise to the\r\nimpression that there has been a previous dream or other warning\r\npresaging the facts, though no such phenomenon actually took place. In\r\nother words, there would be an auto-suggestion consequent upon the\r\nhearing of other fulfilled presentiments that sometime some such thing\r\nmust also occur to us, and then when a happening that reminds us of\r\nsomething in the previous stories of {636} presentiments comes there\r\nis the sudden responsive feeling \"why, this is what I saw or must have\r\nseen in my dream.\"\r\n\r\nPodmore suggests an illusion of memory magnifying or rearranging the\r\ndetails of a recent dream or premonitory impression, so as to make it\r\nfit into the happenings. Dreams are so vague that unless they have\r\nbeen written down we are not quite sure of them an hour after they\r\noccurred and a day or two later we have only the merest hint of what\r\nthey were. If this can be made to have any connection with a casualty\r\nof any kind that happens subsequently we may very readily recreate the\r\ndream with its details concordant to the event. Certainly no reliance\r\ncan be placed on a story of a dream fulfilled unless the dream was\r\ntold before the happening.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremonitions of Death.--Certain premonitions are common and are\r\nfrequently brought to the physician's notice. Among old people it is\r\nnot unusual to find that a premonition of death will hang over them\r\nfor days, seriously disturbing them and their friends, hampering often\r\na healthy reaction against disease and always lowering resistive\r\nvitality. Many of them have heard stories which make them credit the\r\nbelief that such premonitions are likely to come true and therefore\r\nthey cannot shake them off. They have heard stories of people who have\r\nbecome convinced that they were going to die at a particular time on a\r\nparticular day and whose conviction has been proven by the event. Like\r\nall the other premonitions, whatever truth there may appear to be in\r\nthem, is due entirely to the fact that nearly everybody has\r\npremonitions and occasionally, therefore, one of them must come true.\r\nThose that are fulfilled create such an impression that they are\r\nremembered, while those that fail are forgotten, until, though it is\r\nnot realized, it becomes true that fulfilled premonitions represent\r\nexactly that much misunderstood principle that the exception proves\r\nthe rule. The rule is that premonitions fail. Exceptionally, however,\r\na premonition comes true. Instead of proving that premonitions mean\r\nanything, the rarity of their fulfillment proves the rule of their\r\nnon-significance and demonstrates that they are merely coincidences.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersuasion of Short Life.--Much mental suffering occurs in nervous\r\npeople as a consequence of a premonition or persuasion which comes to\r\nthem in middle life that they are destined not to live very long. This\r\nis a commoner impression than is usually thought and comes to nearly\r\neveryone at some time in life. Especially is it likely to come to\r\nthose who have suffered some severe illness and who know how weak they\r\nwere during their convalescence and, in spite of their thorough\r\nrecovery of strength, cannot quite persuade themselves but that an\r\nailment which made them so weak must surely have sapped their vitality\r\nso as to make long life for them impossible. It is, of course, one of\r\nthe vague dreads that men always seem to be harboring, but there are\r\ntimes that it becomes so prominent and so influential in the\r\nproduction of depressive feelings that it is worth while to have the\r\nmeans at hand to counteract it as far as possible. In the last ten\r\nyears I have made it a practice to ask, not only all my patients but\r\nmost of my acquaintances above 70 years of age whether they had ever\r\nexperienced such a premonition. I have particularly asked what were\r\ntheir feelings with regard to the hope of long life for them when they\r\nwere in their forties and fifties. Without exception I have been told\r\nby all those who had the education and leisure to {637} be at all\r\nintrospective, that they had felt sure that they would not have long\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMost of the men consulted took out life insurance in such a way as to\r\nbenefit their families after their death rather than themselves during\r\nlife. Indeed it seems not an unusual thing for men to have some\r\nexperience with an ailment between 40 and 55 which makes them realize\r\ntheir mortality much more than the deaths of their friends around them\r\nhad succeeded in doing. Premonitions and impressions, then, of this\r\nkind evidently mean nothing, so far as the prospect of long life is\r\nconcerned. Practically everyone has them, and since, of course, the\r\ngreat majority of men do not live to die of old age, it would seem\r\nthat their premonition of comparatively short life was fulfilled.\r\nOccasionally a man will be found at the age of fifty unwilling to take\r\nup further work or develop his business because of the dread that has\r\ncome over him that he may not live long enough to make it worth the\r\nwhile. Where there is serious kidney or heart trouble such an\r\nabstention from business is commendable, but in many cases it leaves a\r\nman without occupation or with insufficient occupation and he becomes\r\nshort-circuited on himself with more serious results from worry than\r\nwould have come from work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublication of Fulfilled Premonitions.--The publication of fulfilled\r\npremonitions has always seemed to me to be an especially fertile\r\nsource of premonitions for other people. Every now and then someone\r\ngoes to bed in a hotel having communicated to friends the idea that he\r\nfears there may be fire before morning. I do not suppose that one out\r\nof ten people who sleep in a strange hotel fail to have some such\r\nthought, they do not consider it a premonition, however, but only a\r\nsuggestion for the taking of proper precautions so as to know where\r\nexits and fire escapes and other means of escape are situated, so that\r\nin the excitement of the fire they may not have to do any thinking,\r\nbut may have already made up their minds what they shall do. This sort\r\nof premonition, if we call it by that name, has a definite useful\r\npurpose. Occasionally it seems marvelously provident. The other makes\r\nits possessor toss sleepless a portion of the night, does no good and\r\nmuch harm. If, however, the premonition has been communicated to\r\nsomeone else and then a fire should occur, the reporting of the\r\nfulfilled premonition comes to a lot of weak-minded people as a\r\nconfirmation of their worst fears. It is, of course, only a question\r\nof coincidence in a succession of events by no means connected in any\r\ncausal relation, yet by the unthinking set down as showing the\r\npossibility of such premonitions being supremely significant. If we\r\nhad all the stories of unfulfilled premonitions also published then\r\nthe true significance of the others would be clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Unfulfilled Premonition.--There is an excellent story of a strong\r\nbut unfulfilled premonition told by Carl Schurz in his\r\n\"Recollections,\" which seems to me such a good antidote to the\r\ninfluence of supposed premonitions, that every physician should know\r\nits details for their psychotherapeutic value with patients prone to\r\nbe troubled in this way. The ease with which the depression consequent\r\nupon the premonition was relieved as soon as another forcible\r\nsuggestion that the danger was past took possession of him, shows how\r\nsuch states of mind can be altered with no more real reason for the\r\nalteration than there was for the original depression.\r\n\r\n{638}\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the battle of Chancellorsville General Schurz awoke\r\nwith the absolute persuasion that at last his time had come and he was\r\nto be killed that day. He had never had such a premonition before. He\r\nhad heard of many cases in which such premonitions proved the\r\nforerunner of death. He realized how ridiculous was the idea that he\r\nshould know anything about what the future held for him, even vaguely,\r\nand he tried to shake it off. He found it impossible to do so. He\r\nthought that after he took up the routine work of the day the force of\r\nthe premonition would be lost. It was not, but, on the contrary,\r\nseemed to increase in power over him. Finally the idea became so\r\nimperative that he sat down and wrote letters of farewell to his wife\r\nand friends, telling them that he had been tempted to do so because of\r\nthis premonition of danger. When he went into battle--and it may be\r\nrecalled that the Eleventh Corps did some fighting at Chancellorsville\r\nthat day--he was sure that now the end was not far off. It did not\r\ntake away his courage, however, and though he was well in the zone of\r\ndanger, he issued his orders and kept his troops well in hand as we\r\nknow from the history of the battle.\r\n\r\nFinally his aide-de-camp, riding toward the front of the line beside\r\nhim, was killed by a cannon ball. All in an instant the thought came\r\nover him that this was the only danger that was likely to be near him\r\nfor the day. The burden of premonition lifted from him as if the fact\r\nthat a friend had been killed beside him gave him an assurance that he\r\nhimself was not to be taken. There was absolutely no reason for his\r\nthinking so, but his feelings of solicitude with regard to himself and\r\nhis fate faded completely and at once. He continued in the thick of\r\nthe fight and of danger and was untouched. He himself called attention\r\nto the fact that if his premonition had come true, as well it might in\r\nthe midst of the very serious danger which he faced, it would have\r\nseemed a strong confirmation of the impression that premonitions have\r\na meaning other than that of coincidence. It was, however, a\r\nmagnificent example of a failed premonition quite as striking as any\r\nof the stories that are told about premonitions that came true.\r\n\r\n\r\nRole of Coincidence.--This must be remembered in many of our arguments\r\nin medical and other scientific matters. Most diseases are\r\nself-limited, therefore anything that is given as a remedy for them\r\njust about the time that nature has succeeded in conquering the\r\nvirulence of the disease and bringing about the cure of the patient,\r\nseems to be curative. Such cures, often remedies of supposed wonderful\r\npotency, come and go in medicine by the hundred every ten years. Such\r\ncurious doctrines as that of the influence of maternal impressions in\r\nproducing deformities and defects in the unborn child are founded on\r\nnothing better than these coincidences. They are often very startling,\r\nbut the rule by which they must be judged is the number of times in\r\nwhich in spite of similar conditions no premonition takes place.\r\nLiterally thousands of people go to bed every night who are to be\r\nwaked by the danger of fire before morning and yet have no premonition\r\nof it. Literally millions of people have gone to bed in recent years\r\nwithout any premonition of earthquake, yet have been wakened before\r\nmorning with their houses tumbling around them. If a few people have\r\npremonitions in these cases it is easy to understand that it is\r\ncoincidence and not anything else, for these are exceptions, and this\r\nagain is a case of the exception proving the rule.\r\n\r\n{639}\r\n\r\n\r\nPremonitions and Superstitions--Thirteen.--Occasionally premonitions\r\nare connected with certain events that are themselves, even though\r\nhappening quite accidentally, supposed to be portentous. How many\r\npeople, for instance, feel quite uncomfortable if they sit down\r\nthirteen at a table. The very fact of the gathering of thirteen is\r\nsupposed to be a spontaneous or automatic premonition that is a\r\nforewarning of evil that has to come to some of them. Unfortunately,\r\nthis superstition continues to have a vogue and an influence over\r\npeople's minds because stories are told that are supposed to confirm\r\nit. Needless to say, when these stories are true, they are merely\r\ncoincidences. Out of any baker's dozen of people who sit down to\r\ndinner it is not surprising if one should die or be killed during the\r\nyear. Some of the stories, however, are merely sensational inventions\r\nworked up to be given to the public because a number of people are\r\ninterested in this sort of thing. Probably one of the stories that has\r\ngone the rounds most and that has served to confirm many people in\r\ntheir uneasiness over the number 13 is that which is told as happening\r\nto Matthew Arnold and some friends, supposedly the year the great\r\nEnglish litterateur died.\r\n\r\nThe story runs that just as Mr. Arnold and his friends were about to\r\nsit down to the table it was discovered that there were thirteen\r\npresent. According to the old tradition in the matter it is the one\r\nwho first gets up from table under these circumstances that is likely\r\nto be affected by the malignant influence. When the end of the dinner\r\nhad arrived, by previous arrangement Mr. Arnold and two very healthy\r\nfriends, brothers, arose simultaneously. According to the widely\r\ndiffused newspaper account of years afterward, Mr. Arnold himself died\r\nwithin the year and one of the brothers was lost in the wreck of an\r\nEnglish passenger vessel off the coast of Australia in six months,\r\nwhile the other brother committed suicide before the end of the year.\r\nCareful investigation of the details has shown, however, that the\r\nstory was made out of whole cloth. Mr. Arnold himself, who was\r\nsuffering from heart trouble towards the end of his life, was not\r\nlikely to take part in any such arrangement because of the constant\r\ndanger, well-known to himself, of sudden death in his case. This might\r\nhappen at any time and might seem to confirm the superstition. The\r\ndates of the story, moreover, are all wrong. Matthew Arnold's death\r\nand the loss of the English passenger vessel in Australian waters,\r\nreferred to, do not occur within five years of each other. The story\r\nhas gone round the world. The correction will never reach so far. The\r\nstory is startling; the explanation commonplace. Many people will\r\ncontinue to believe that here, at least, was one striking confirmation\r\nof their superstition.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how the force of this \"13\" superstition has continued in\r\nspite of education and enlightenment. Most passenger vessels now built\r\nhave no staterooms numbered thirteen. On certain streets in large\r\ncities one finds the number 12-1/2 (until this year it was so on my\r\nown) substituted for thirteen. Sometimes one finds \"twelve a\" or\r\nsomething similar. In the large hotels, where they have immense\r\nbanquet halls with the tables numbered so that guests may be able to\r\nfind their places, I have often noted that there was no table number\r\nthirteen. It is said that in some of the new skyscraper buildings\r\ntwenty stories and more in height there has been question of skipping\r\nthe thirteenth floor as a designation, because while most {640} people\r\nwould be quite undisturbed about it, some do not care to have an\r\noffice on the thirteenth floor, giving as an excuse that clients or\r\npatrons do not care to come to the thirteenth floor. In automobile\r\nraces men are willing to risk their lives by going a hundred miles an\r\nhour on roads never intended for such performances, but they refuse to\r\nrace behind the fell number thirteen. This, after all, can be readily\r\nunderstood. The slightest thing that takes away a man's complete\r\nconfidence in himself may be serious in an automobile going as fast as\r\nthese. Men must not think of fear or they lose some of their power and\r\ncontrol over themselves and their machine. They must simply forget\r\neverything except the task before them.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the thirteen superstition is one form of acceptance of\r\npremonitions. That of itself should be enough to enable sensible\r\npeople to throw them off. Above all, it must be remembered that such\r\nsupposed malignant influence, when allowed to affect people, impairs\r\ntheir presence of mind and may thus lead up to the accident or mishap\r\nwhich it is supposed to foreshadow. This is the serious feature of\r\nsuch premonitions and dreads. Unless people can be persuaded sensibly\r\nto be rid of them they handicap themselves whenever they are placed in\r\ndanger that causes them to recur to the thought of the premonition or\r\ndread. While there is absolutely nothing but coincidence in even the\r\nsupposed true stories, and many of the stories are merely sensational\r\ninventions, yet people need to be persuaded to rid themselves of the\r\nincubus that settles over them because of such ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremonitions and Telepathy.--There are many people who think that\r\npremonitions have something to do with telepathy. Somehow the future\r\nevent is supposed to be able to send some message to specially\r\nsusceptible minds. Either that, of course, or there is some being in\r\nanother world whose interest is sufficient to convey some inkling of\r\nthe future. A little consideration of this subject, however, shows the\r\nutter lack of rationality in any such opinion. Future events, having\r\nas yet no existence, cannot in any way influence intelligence. Such\r\nfuture events, when dependent on human free will, are quite impossible\r\nof being foretold and, as has been said, no being except the Creator\r\nHimself knows anything about them. It would be only from Him, then,\r\nthat information might be supposed to come and it would be hard to\r\nthink such information would be so vague and indefinite as to leave\r\nroom for doubt and, besides, often defeat its purpose of protection by\r\nseriously disturbing patients and lessening their presence of mind.\r\nThere is no reasonable explanation by which a human being can be\r\nsupposed to obtain knowledge of a future event unless there is a\r\ncomplete overturning of the ordinary laws of nature and then it would\r\nbe reasonably supposed that no doubt of the significance of the event\r\nwould be left.\r\n\r\nNearly all of us have premonitions that fail. Only a few especially\r\nintrospective people who are constantly afraid of what will happen to\r\nthem, and who are sure that the worst is always preparing for them,\r\nhave their premonitions come true more than once or twice in life. The\r\nstriking fulfillments of a few premonitions could be paralleled by an\r\nendless number of just as striking failures, only that most people\r\ndismiss the idea completely from their minds as too foolish to be\r\nfurther talked about. It is quite the same with dreams. All the world\r\ndreams and there would be a serious violation of the theory of\r\nprobabilities if some dreams did not come true. The great {641}\r\nmajority of mankind, especially after the age of thirty, is fearful\r\nlest something ill is going to happen to them and their premonitions\r\nare rather frequent. If some of these did not come true then the\r\nmathematics of coincidences as based on the theory of probabilities\r\nwould prove false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPERIODICAL DEPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFits of periodical depression, familiarly known as \"the blues,\" occur\r\nin the experience of practically everyone. In some people they are\r\nonly slight and passing. In others they last for hours and make the\r\nindividual quite miserable. In still others, without actually running\r\ninto melancholia, they produce serious discouragement and continuous\r\ndiscomfort which persists even for days and makes life intolerable.\r\nThey come and go quite unaccountably. During their occurrence all\r\nvitality is lowered, appetite lessened, aches and pains are\r\nemphasized, sleep may be disturbed, exercise becomes distasteful, and\r\nthey usually present an interval when health is at a low ebb.\r\nOrdinarily when described as \"the blues\" they have no definite\r\nconnection with any known physical cause. They are passing incidents\r\nwhich seem to recur at irregular intervals. When connected with\r\nphysical ills they are thought of directly as symptoms of these ills.\r\nAll forms of disease may be associated with such fits of depression\r\nand many physical symptoms seem to be due to the fact that during\r\nthese periods there is a distinct lowering of physical vitality so\r\nthat the nerve impulses which ordinarily enable functions to be\r\nperformed without interference are interrupted, or at least are\r\ninhibited, to a noteworthy degree. While to a certain extent the\r\ncondition is a mental disease, it may be modified by the correction of\r\nphysical derangements, by stimulation and, above all, by suggestion\r\nand a change in the point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerious Pathological Conditions.--Of course, such periodical fits of\r\ndepression are associated with various serious progressive ailments\r\nand then are primarily physical, and are only secondarily psychic.\r\nFrom the standpoint of psychotherapy it is important to remember that\r\ncertain serious organic lesions may show their first signs in the\r\npatient's mental state. It is not unusual, for instance, for the\r\ndisposition of a patient suffering from kidney disease to change so\r\nmaterially that the attention of friends is called to the change\r\nbefore any physical symptom of the nephritis has been noted. Sometimes\r\nfor a year there will be a progressive clouding of what had previously\r\nbeen a rather happy disposition. Decisions will be made more slowly\r\nthan before. The judgment will be impaired. There are some striking\r\nexamples of this in history, of which the unfortunate Athenian\r\ngeneral, Nicias, put to death for incapacity that was undoubtedly\r\npathological, is one. Pleasures will be taken half-heartedly; men who\r\nhave been bright and jovial will now become saturnine. Men who have\r\nbeen the life of parties will try to hold the place they acquired\r\nbefore, though all around them will perceive how difficult it is for\r\nthem to maintain the role they have set for themselves. Whenever there\r\nis a notable change in disposition, it is well not to attribute it to\r\nsome passing mental condition and, above all, not to dismiss {642} it\r\nas a peculiarity unamenable to treatment, but to look for the\r\nunderlying pathological basis of the new condition.\r\n\r\nIn this way physical disease will sometimes be discovered long before\r\nit otherwise would be. This must be particularly noted when there have\r\nbeen a series of worries. Occasionally it seems enough to many people\r\nto ascribe a change of disposition to the troubles that have come over\r\na patient. If a business man fails or passes through a crisis in his\r\naffairs in which failure is very near, or he has many business worries\r\nover a prolonged period, these are sometimes thought to be quite\r\nenough to explain a change of disposition. They are, but not to the\r\ndegree that is often noted, for, in excess, melancholic tendencies are\r\nalways pathological, that is, they have some basis in a serious mental\r\nor physical change. If there is an insidious nephritis already at\r\nwork, its symptoms will be much exaggerated and its progress\r\naccelerated by the worries and disquietude of such a time. If a wife\r\nloses her husband, or an only son, or a favorite child, the occurrence\r\nof a prolonged period of depression should lead to a careful\r\ninvestigation of physical conditions and of the underlying mental\r\nstate in the hope of guarding against serious developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heart Disease_.--Periods of depression are also common in heart\r\ndisease and are often the first symptom of the beginning of a break in\r\ncompensation. This effect is not so simple and direct, however, as in\r\nthe case of the kidneys. Probably the first physical symptom of a\r\nbreak in compensation, where there is real valvular heart disease, is\r\na decrease in the amount of urine. This points to an insufficient\r\nelimination of the products of metabolism and to the retention in the\r\ncirculation of toxic substances. The reason for this is the lessened\r\ncirculation through the kidneys because of the diseased heart. There\r\nis also a lessened circulation through the brain. This impairs the\r\nfunction of the brain and quite naturally leads to mental depression,\r\nslowness of decision, and unwillingness to occupy one's self with many\r\nthings. Besides, because of the lessened function of the kidney the\r\ncirculating blood not only does not nourish so well but it tends still\r\nfurther to depress the brain cells by the toxic substances that are in\r\nit. Depression in such cases is rather to be expected and at the\r\nbeginning is not continuous but comes in ever longer periods with\r\nshortening intervals as the disturbance of the circulation progresses.\r\nAt first, like other diminutions of function, it is conservative in\r\norder to spare the heart work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Respiratory Affections_.--Very curiously an affection of the lungs\r\nhas exactly the opposite effect and is likely to create in the patient\r\nan artificial sense of well-being. _Spes phthisica_, the\r\ncharacteristic hope of consumptive patients, is well known, and has\r\nbeen described by many a careful observer from Hippocrates and Galen\r\nto our own time. A lessened amount of oxygen in the blood produces a\r\ncertain sleepiness, but this seems to be preceded by a period of\r\nslight excitation. The most familiar example of this occurs at the\r\nbeginning of the inhalation of laughing gas. Practically the only\r\ndirect physical effect of the inhalation of nitrous-dioxide is to shut\r\noff our oxygen and it is a slight period of deoxygenation that\r\nproduces the anesthesia by this agent. Whether we have not in this the\r\nexplanation of the feeling of the consumptive, so that often on the\r\nday before his death he plans a number of things that he is going to\r\ndo next year, may require more careful {643} investigation, but the\r\nsuggestion may serve to show how much disposition, both lively and\r\nserious, depends on physical factors as well as on the natural state\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL STATES OF DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite apart from these serious ailments, however, there are passing\r\nphases of depression that come to nearly everyone after adult life is\r\nreached that are likely to be somewhat more frequent as years go on,\r\nbut that are not entirely unknown even in early years. They are more\r\nlikely to come to those who feel that life has been somewhat of a\r\nfailure and that they have accomplished very little in spite of all\r\nthat they have tried to do. Not infrequently they come, however, to\r\nthose who in the estimation of other people have made a magnificent\r\nsuccess of life. The rich man, after he has made his fortune, unless\r\nhe continues to engross himself with some time-taking and\r\ninterest-claiming work, may be the subject of repeated attacks of\r\nmental depression. Social leaders among women who begin to feel\r\nsomething of the emptiness of social striving, after they have made\r\nwhat is called a success in society and at the time when they are the\r\nenvy of many on the social ladder below them, are particularly likely\r\nto be subject to attacks of \"the blues.\" The only men and women who\r\nare free from them to a great extent, and even they not absolutely,\r\nare those who are busily engaged with some occupation not entirely\r\nselfish in which they can see that what they are doing is\r\naccomplishing something for the people around them.\r\n\r\nVery often an attack of depression is ushered in by some small\r\ndisappointment. As a rule, however, this is not the causative factor\r\nbut is only an occasion which makes manifest the depressed state that\r\nhas existed for some time and that now declares itself openly. In the\r\nsame way only a slight occasion is necessary apparently to dispel\r\nclouds that hang over a person in the milder attacks of depression,\r\nbecause, for some time before, relief has been preparing itself and a\r\nlivelier phase of existence has been gradually coming on. Relief can\r\nbe promised with absolute assurance, but freedom from relapse cannot\r\nbe assured and the only true source of consolation that is helpful is\r\nthe frank recognition of the fact that these are successive phases of\r\nexistence quite as likely to be periodic as certain physical facts in\r\nlife. Depression is likely to be a little more manifest in the morning\r\nthan at other times, partly because the interests of the day have not\r\nyet come to occupy the mind, but mainly because the physical life as\r\nindicated by the pulse and the temperature is lower during the morning\r\nhours than in the afternoon and evening. Just as soon as people\r\nrealize the physical nature of certain dispositional changes they give\r\nmuch less depressive significance to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation of Mind.--The most important feature of the treatment of\r\ndepression of mind is to secure somehow such occupation as will catch\r\nthe attention and arouse the interest. This is not always an easy\r\nmatter. How effective it is, however, can be best judged from what one\r\nnotes of the effect of such things as physical pain or great\r\nsolicitude for someone else besides themselves. I have known a mother,\r\nwhose fits of \"the blues\" were getting deeper and the intervals\r\ngrowing shorter to be roused from her condition when all means had\r\nfailed by the elopement of a daughter who had been partly pushed into\r\nleaving because things had become so unpleasant around home {644}\r\nduring her mother's depression, and any change seemed welcome. On the\r\nother hand, I had a doctor friend who felt quite alarmed about his\r\ngrowing depression and who even had some fears lest, if it continued\r\nto deepen, he might commit suicide. He was completely lifted out of\r\nhis increasing depression by the occurrence of pneumonia in his boy of\r\nsixteen. The pneumonia did not end by crisis but by lysis and for\r\nweeks he had very little sleep. He confessed that the intense\r\npreoccupation of mind had completely driven away his blues and had\r\neven done much to relieve him of various digestive symptoms to which\r\nhe had previously attributed his depression.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I have known men who, in the midst of prosperity,\r\nfound life dull and rather hard to bear, and who just as soon as a\r\ncrisis in their affairs compelled them to pay attention to other\r\nthings than themselves and the state of their feelings, grew better\r\nmentally and physically. It seems almost a contradiction in terms to\r\nsay that it is the man of little occupation, as a rule, or at least of\r\noccupations that are not insistent, who is likely to be troubled with\r\ninsomnia, while the very busy man, especially the man busy not about\r\none or two narrow interests, but about a number, is seldom so\r\nbothered. Nothing contributes more to the depression of mind than loss\r\nof sleep or supposed loss of sleep. Even women who, while living in\r\nease and comfort, had much to complain of as regards depression, often\r\nlose entirely their tendencies to \"the blues\" or have fits of them at\r\nmuch longer intervals, when necessity compels them either to earn\r\ntheir own living or, at least, to occupy themselves much more with\r\nabsolutely necessary duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Provision of Occupation_.--It is a hard matter to create such\r\noccupation of mind as will be satisfactory. Patients have to be tried\r\nby various suggestions. The tendency to periodic fits of depression\r\ndeep enough to be called to the physician's attention is much more\r\nnoticeable in recent years than it used to be, and seems to me at\r\nleast to bear a corresponding ratio to the decrease of home life. Home\r\nduties usually mean joys and of late there has been a neglect of the\r\njoys of life while seeking its pleasures. Certain phases of city life\r\nare responsible for much dissatisfaction with existence and depression\r\nof spirits. Most of the women who live in apartment hotels have\r\npractically no serious occupation of mind. They need not get up if\r\nthey do not feel quite right or quite rested--and who after the age of\r\nforty ever does feel quite all right in the morning hours unless sleep\r\nhas been in the open air? Nothing is so likely to start a day of\r\ndepression than failure to get up promptly, lounging around with forty\r\nwinks here and there, reading in bed, and the like. If breakfast is\r\ntaken in bed, then some reading indulged in, and then some sleeping,\r\nand only an hour or two of dawdling around comes before lunch, that\r\nmeal is not properly enjoyed and the afternoon is started badly;\r\nunless there is some special diversion of mind depression is almost\r\nsure to get the upper hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Place of Children in Psychotherapy_.--Where there are children the\r\ninterests are much more urgent and there is little time for such\r\npreoccupation with self as gives one \"that tired feeling.\" We are very\r\ninteresting to ourselves, but just as soon as we have no other subject\r\nto occupy us than ourselves we soon grow very tired of the subject.\r\nChildren are the best interest that one can think of, for women\r\nparticularly. When they have none of their own an interest in orphan\r\nasylums, in day nurseries, in various children's {645} institutions,\r\nand, above all, in the adoption of a child, will do more than anything\r\nelse to relieve the tendency to blues. Of late years the adoption of\r\nchildren has been much less frequent than used to be the case in\r\nchildless families, and doctors see the result in mental depression.\r\nChildren are a great care, but they are a great blessing to women, and\r\nwhile the present trend of social life eliminates them as far as\r\npossible, this elimination, beginning with their relegation to nurses\r\nwhen they are infants, to nursemaids as they grow a little older, and\r\nthen to the kindergarten up to six years of age, far from adding to\r\ncomfort rather increases the discomfort of many mothers. Nature takes\r\nher revenge. The reason why the mothers of past generations could\r\nstand the suffering that they must have borne with patience before\r\ngynecology developed to relieve them, was that they had their children\r\naround them, and their minds and their hearts and their hands were so\r\nfull that they had no time to think of themselves, to brood over their\r\nills, and consequently these troubled them much less than would\r\notherwise have been the case.\r\n\r\nDelicate mothers really interested in their children undoubtedly\r\nsuffer very little compared to delicate women who are alone in life,\r\nand what is thus true of the mother is true also of those who have the\r\ncare of children. It is not alone a satisfaction of the maternal\r\ninstinct, but it is an occupation of mind and heart with cares for\r\nlittle ones. Other people's children serve just as good a therapeutic\r\npurpose, if only their necessities are imposed on the attendant. The\r\nreason why women in religious orders have such happy peaceful lives\r\nand are happier in spite of a routine of life that would seem to be\r\nfatal to happiness, is that their minds are filled with the interests\r\nof others, every moment of their time is occupied, and, above all,\r\nthey have to care for children, the ailing, the poor, sometimes the\r\nvicious, who make many demands on them, many calls on their sympathies\r\nand keep them from thinking about themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occupation with Living Things_.--After occupation with human beings\r\nthe most important therapeutic factor against periods of depression is\r\noccupation with living things of various kinds. Horseback riding is an\r\nexcellent remedy for the blues and the outside of a horse in the old\r\naxiom is literally very good for the inside of man or woman. There is\r\na sympathy between man and animal that in itself means much, but the\r\nmost important element is the absolute impossibility of preoccupation\r\nwith oneself and one's little troubles and worries while one is trying\r\nto manage a somewhat restive animal. If the horse, however, is old and\r\nvery quiet--so that one can throw the reins on his neck and allow him\r\nto jog on for himself, then horseback riding may mean very little.\r\nWhere the care of the animal is entirely taken off the rider's\r\nshoulders by a groom who brings him to a particular place and takes\r\nhim afterwards, then, also, much of the benefit of horseback riding is\r\nlost. Care for other animals as well as the horse is of great service\r\nand especially is this true if the owners feel the duty of exercising\r\nthe animals. Many a downhearted person finds that to take an animal\r\nout for a stroll will do much to lift the clouds of depression.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of children from the families of the\r\nbetter-to-do classes, pet dogs have grown in favor mainly because of\r\nthis influence. They awaken sympathies and so keep people from\r\nthinking too much about themselves, For many an elderly woman who is\r\nalone in the world her dogs or her {646} cats or a combination of both\r\nare the best possible remedies for depression. At times it will be\r\nfound necessary to prescribe them. There is no better way to get an\r\nelderly person to go out at certain times than to have them feel that\r\ntheir pets need exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garden Cures_.--After animals the next best thing is the care of a\r\ngarden. Here once more human sympathies with living things are aroused\r\nand it is easier to cultivate a forgetfulness of self while\r\ncultivating flowers and plants. Growing plants do not arouse the\r\ninterest that growing animals do, but still they have advantages over\r\nthings that do not vary, and their growth is a subject of day-to-day\r\ninterest and the effect on them of vicissitudes of the weather arouses\r\nfeelings of solicitude which help to dissipate the little insistent\r\ncares for self that depress. The care of a garden is the very best\r\nthing for the \"pottering old.\" Younger people are too impatient to get\r\nmuch benefit out of a garden, but after middle life many an hour of\r\ndepression will be saved in the care of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intellectual Occupations_.--It might be expected that intellectual\r\noccupations would serve to brush away \"the blues\" for educated people.\r\nThey are perfectly capable of doing so, but they must be of the kind\r\nthat grip attention and must be undertaken seriously, usually with an\r\nappeal quite apart from mere cultural interests. Hobbies of various\r\nkinds, especially the making of collections, even of such trivial\r\nthings as stamps, will often serve the purpose of distraction from\r\ngloomier thoughts. Unfortunately, a hobby cannot be created all at\r\nonce and usually does not take a strong enough hold to be available\r\nfor mental therapeutic purposes unless it was acquired when the person\r\nwas comparatively young and has been indulged in for many years.\r\nReading and study utterly fail unless there is some end in view apart\r\nfrom the reading and study itself. The reading of novels and\r\nnewspapers is particularly likely to be a failure. The gloomier\r\nthoughts obtrude themselves in the midst of the reading and very often\r\nwhat is read proves suggestive of melancholic thoughts and all the\r\ntime the mind and the person are not occupied seriously enough to push\r\naway the state of depression which exists. The mind must be\r\ninterested, not merely occupied superficially, or the depression will\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that the reading of books that concerned human\r\nsuffering might have a similar appeal to that to be obtained from real\r\ntouch with human suffering. This is true to a certain extent when the\r\nbooks concern real and not fictitious suffering. For this reason the\r\ntrials and hardships of travelers at the North and South poles or in\r\nthe heart of tropical Africa--Nansen and Peary and Stanley and\r\nLivingston--have all been excellent therapeutic agents. The stories of\r\nmountain climbers have something of the same effect. Adventures in\r\nAlaska and in the Far North, especially, come in the same category.\r\nNovels, however, even though they use the same material, soon fail to\r\nhave a corresponding effect. Even when the novel does touch the\r\nemotions deeply it is prone to make the reader forget the suffering\r\naround him and does not prove a good diversion from his own feelings.\r\nIn his play, \"The Night Asylum,\" Maxim Gorky, the Russian novelist and\r\nplaywright, brings this out very well. One of his characters, a young\r\nscrubwoman, wears her fingers to the bone during the day for a\r\nmiserable pittance and sleeps in a squalid night lodging house, yet\r\nthis comparatively young creature, {647} crouched near the only light\r\nin the room, sheds tears over the imaginary sufferings of the\r\nfictitious people that she reads about, while the real human suffering\r\naround her fails entirely to arouse her sympathy or affect her\r\nemotions, except to anger her if lodgers come in between her and the\r\nlight or when the complaints made by some of those who are suffering\r\naround her annoy and distract her from her reading.\r\n\r\nIn younger folks, study, provided there is some definite object to be\r\nattained by it, is often helpful. Correspondence schools are of value\r\nby setting a definite purpose before the mind. In a number of cases I\r\nhave found that the suggestion to make translations from a foreign\r\nlanguage when the patient knew that language even tolerably well,\r\nafforded excellent relief from that over-occupation with self which\r\nwas the real cause of the depression. There are many people who know\r\nenough French to be able to translate fairly well and there are many\r\narticles and books a translation of which may at least be submitted to\r\neditors and often proves available for publication. To have some such\r\nend as this in view is of itself one of the best means that can be\r\nprovided for these people to relieve their tendency to depression.\r\nOccasionally even the suggestion to write stories may prove helpful.\r\nOne hesitates to add to the number of story-writers in this country,\r\nbut it may be remembered as a last resort. I know at least two people\r\nsaved from themselves by even a very moderate success as writers of\r\nshort stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Consolation from History_.--Perhaps the most serious thing about\r\ndepression is the feeling of those afflicted by it that they are\r\nsingular in this respect and that other people who seem gay never have\r\ndepressed states. There is probably no one who has not periods of\r\ndepression. They may not be very deep and \"the blues\" may be only of\r\na light tinge, but they are there. The higher the intelligence, as a\r\nrule, the more tendency there is to feelings of discouragement and\r\ndepression at intervals when one is not occupied. Those who have the\r\nartistic temperament and the striving after the expression of the\r\nbeautiful as they see it, whether it be in art or in letters or in the\r\nbetterment of humanity, usually suffer more than others because they\r\nrealize poignantly their failure to reach their ideals. This is well\r\nillustrated by the experience of writers and artists. As a rule, most\r\nmen and women look forward to the completion of any intellectual work\r\nwith confidence that after it is finished they will have a period of\r\nrest and peace. Commonly just the opposite is true. The completion of\r\nany work leaves one with a sense of dissatisfaction with what has been\r\ndone, for no man of real intelligence ever thinks that he has so\r\nrealized his ideals as to be satisfied, and only the foolishly\r\nconceited fail to feel the many defects that there are in their work.\r\n\r\nThere is abundance of evidence, however, that it is not alone artists\r\nand writers who thus feel the hollowness of life and the tears there\r\nare in things. Many of the men who have accomplished great things in\r\nscience and in politics have been prone to times of depression.\r\nVirchow told me there were moments when life seemed very empty to him\r\nand that he had to shake off feelings of depression in order to be\r\nable to go on with his work. At one time in the sixth decade of his\r\nlife he suffered considerably from what we would now call neurasthenic\r\nsymptoms, gave up his medical work and spent a long time with\r\nSchliemann in the Troad. His presence was valuable to the excavator in\r\nhis work at Troy, and the change gave Virchow back his health.\r\n\r\n{648}\r\n\r\nEven more striking is what we know of Von Moltke, who seemed in many\r\nways to have an ideally happy life. He had had the fulfillment of all\r\nhis desires or, at least, the fruition of all his hopes, and the\r\nsuccessful accomplishment of what he worked for beyond what is usually\r\ngiven to man. He had come to be one of the most highly respected men\r\nof Europe and was the subject of veneration on the part of his own\r\nGerman people and of intimate affection from his sovereign, who loaded\r\nhim with honors. He was a man who had probably no enemies and many,\r\nmany firm friends. It was said that \"he could keep silence in eleven\r\nlanguages\" and so he had avoided most of the pitfalls of life. His\r\ndomestic life was ideally happy and his letters to his wife for over\r\nfifty years read like those of a lover, before all his great battles\r\nhis last thought and written word was for her, after them his first\r\nthought and message was for her. In spite of this, towards the end of\r\nhis life, when the question of reincarnation was a subject of\r\ndiscussion in Berlin and it was brought particularly to his attention,\r\nhe declared that looking back on his career, in spite of all its good\r\nfortune, there seemed to him to be so many chances in life, so many\r\npossible sources of failure, so many springs of discouragement, that\r\nhe would prefer not to have to live again. Surely, if anyone, he might\r\nbe expected to be ready to take the chances of re-incarnation after\r\nsuch happy experiences of life, yet he was not. Such an expression\r\ncould only come from a man who had looked depression often in the\r\nface, who had shaken off the blue devils and who knew that even the\r\njoy of success was followed by the gloom of uncertainty as to the\r\nfuture and solicitude as to the real significance of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literature and Life_.--We have many examples of this tendency to\r\ndepression that come to the literary man in the lives and letters of\r\ndistinguished writers that have been published so frequently in recent\r\nyears. Perhaps one of the most striking is to be found in the life of\r\nRobert Bulwer Lytton, the second Lord Lytton, so well known as a\r\ndiplomatist in European circles and throughout the English-speaking\r\nworld as a poet, under the pen name of \"Owen Meredith.\"   [Footnote\r\n51] It might be thought that Lytton would be one of the men safely\r\nharbored from storms of depression and discouragement, for his life\r\nseemed ideally situated to enable him to get the best out of himself\r\nwithout worry or dissipation of energy in occupation with mere\r\npersonal matters. His father had made a distinguished success as a\r\nliterary man and a politician, had been raised to the peerage and the\r\nson began life with every possible advantage. He made a distinguished\r\nsuccess in literature so that he even converted his father to praise\r\nhim and as a diplomatist he occupied nearly every important post in\r\nEnglish diplomacy and had hosts of friends all over the world.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 51: Personal and Literary Letters of Lord Lytton,\r\n  edited by Lady Betty Balfour. New York, 1909.]\r\n\r\nIt is all the more surprising, then, to have many passages in his\r\nletters refer to periodic attacks of depression. He says, for\r\ninstance, \"My physical temperament has a great tendency to beget blue\r\ndevils and when those imps lay siege to my soul they recall those\r\nwords of Schopenhauer's and say to me 'thou art the man.'\" Perhaps the\r\nprice that the artistic temperament pays for the satisfaction that it\r\ngets out of life in other directions is this occasional tendency {649}\r\nto depression because achievement does not equal aspiration. Certainly\r\nthe price often seems excessive to those who have to pay it. In the\r\nsame letter to his daughter, Lytton continues:\r\n\r\n  When my blue devils are cast out, and I recover sanity of spirits,\r\n  then I say to myself just what you say to me in your letter--that\r\n  the main thing is not to do but to be; that the work of a man is\r\n  rather in what he is than in what he does; that one may be a very\r\n  fine poet yet a very poor creature; that my life has at least been a\r\n  very full one, rich in varied experiences, touching the world at\r\n  many points; that had I devoted it exclusively to the cultivation of\r\n  one gift, though that the best, I might have become a poet as great\r\n  at least as any of my contemporaries, but that this is by no means\r\n  certain to me for my natural inclination to, and unfitness for, all\r\n  the practical side of life are so great that I might just as likely\r\n  have lapsed into a mere dreamer; that the discipline of active life\r\n  and forced contact with the world has been specially good for me,\r\n  perhaps providential, and that what I have gained from it as a man\r\n  may be more than compensation for whatever I may have lost by it as\r\n  an artist.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to think of a man of this kind becoming so depressed\r\nby the death of a son that all the world and the meaning of life took\r\non a somber hue for him. In 1871 Lord Lytton lost a young boy by a\r\nvery painful illness which had probably been more painful for\r\nsympathetic onlookers than for the patient himself. The incident\r\nproved sufficient, however, to make the father think that there could\r\nnot be a beneficent Providence ruling over the world. He felt sure\r\nthat somehow God's power must be shortened, if such suffering, for\r\nwhich he could see no reason, had to be permitted. He was much\r\ndepressed after this and never was quite the same in his outlook upon\r\nthe world and the significance of life. It was easy to understand that\r\nthis was due rather to his character than his intellect, but it\r\nillustrates forcibly how much a deeply intelligent man may be affected\r\nby something that seems after all, only the course of nature.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes surprising to find from the life stories of men how\r\noften those who would be thought least likely to suffer from\r\nperiodical depression were victims of it. Few Americans in our time\r\nhave apparently had a more satisfying career than that of James\r\nRussell Lowell, a successful author as a young man, then a successful\r\neditor, a teacher whom his students appreciated very much, and in\r\nlater life the subject of many honors and such honors as provided him\r\nwith splendid opportunities for the exhibition of his special genius.\r\nHe would seem to be the last who should suffer from depression. His\r\npost as Minister to Spain gave him an opportunity which he took\r\nmagnificently to study the great Spanish authors and to store up\r\nmaterial for writing about them. As Minister to England few men were\r\nso popular. He was constantly in demand for occasional addresses and\r\nhis special style enabled him to respond to these demands with\r\nbrilliant success. Here in America no great occasion was complete\r\nwithout Lowell. In spite of all this that would surely seem ample to\r\nsatisfy the aspirations of any man, Lowell was often depressed and\r\nsometimes even talked about the possibility of suicide. Life seemed at\r\ntimes very empty to him. The story of the lives of such men, if made\r\nfamiliar to patients, proves a source of consolation, for it makes\r\nthem realize that they are not alone in their experiences, that\r\ndepression at some times is the lot of man, and that very few people\r\nare without the sphere of its influence.\r\n\r\n{650}\r\n\r\nDepression an Incident, not a State.--This suggestion may, in the case\r\nof some of those inclined to longer periods of depression, lead to\r\nindulgence in the luxury of being depressed and so putting off the\r\ndoing of things. It must be pointed out, however, that just inasmuch\r\nas depression has this effect it is pathological. It seems to be\r\nnatural to man to suffer from periods of discouragement and depression\r\nwhich keep him from devoting himself too persistently to lines of work\r\nthat may be insignificant and make him take cognizance of the real\r\nvalues of what he is doing. Depression, however, that continues after\r\nthe recognition of this takes place is morbid and must be actively\r\nresisted. Just inasmuch as depression precedes and prepares patients\r\nfor a reaction, it is an incident in practically all lives. Indulged\r\nin as a luxury, it is abnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestive Treatment--The most important thing for patients who suffer\r\nfrom periodic depression is to make them understand that this state of\r\nmind, far from being personal to them or very rare, or even uncommon,\r\nis an extremely frequent experience of men and women. There are\r\ncertain men and a few women eminently occupied with the external life,\r\nbusy with many things, though often they are trivial enough, and even\r\nwhen they are important, significant only in a financial or a social\r\nway, but meaning nothing for the great realities of life, who seem\r\nduring their younger active years to escape the periodical attacks of\r\ndepression that come to most people and come almost without exception\r\nto people who think seriously. Some of the best thoughts and\r\ninspirations of men come to them as the result of the serious mood\r\nthat follows an attack of depression. A butterfly existence lacks\r\nthese sources of inspiration. Far from being objectionable then,\r\nattacks of depression, if not allowed to proceed too far, and if kept\r\nfrom paralyzing activity, prove to be intervals when life values are\r\nseriously weighed and when a proper estimation of such values is come\r\nto. Men are prone without such interruptions to get too interested in\r\ntrivial concerns that seem to them important because they are occupied\r\nwith them to the exclusion of other ideas, but that prove to be of no\r\nreal import when seen on the background of a certain hollowness that\r\nthere is in human life, if lived merely for its own sake.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of periodical depression is a part of the mystery of\r\nlife and it affords us a better opportunity to get a little closer to\r\nthe heart of the mystery than almost anything else. It is out of such\r\nperiods that men have risen \"on stepping-stones of their dead selves\r\nto higher things\" and have even risen to the highest that there is in\r\nlife. Geniuses have nearly always had deep periods of depression, but\r\nin the midst of them have read new meanings into life and have read\r\nthe lessons of humanity in their own souls better than at any other\r\ntime. Depression throws a man back on himself and makes him think\r\ndeeper than in his mind--in what has been called his heart. \"The\r\nfascination of trifles obscures the good things in life\" are words of\r\nold-time wisdom and men are weaned from this by fits of depression\r\nthat are really moods of precious dissatisfaction with their work\r\ninasmuch as it falls short of the best accomplishment. Without\r\nperiodic depression, apparently, a man never gets as close to the\r\nheart of life as he otherwise would. Far from being an unwelcome\r\nvisitant, it should be rather welcome as a stimulus to the possibility\r\nof further study of self and the realities of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n{651}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINSOMNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the minds of many people insomnia is one of the most serious ills\r\nto which human nature is heir. Most of this quite false impression is\r\ndue to the sensational cultivation of dreads with regard to insomnia\r\nby newspapers and in general conversation. If we were to credit such\r\nimpressions, there is a certain number of unfortunates who, for some\r\nunknown reason, find it impossible to sleep and who, night after\r\nnight, drag out the weary hours wooing sleep that does not come, until\r\nwhen daylight dawns they are in despair, distracted by lack of rest.\r\nThis is presumed to occur night after night, until finally the\r\nworn-out mind succumbs to the intolerable anguish of being kept\r\nconstantly on the rack of wakefulness and the patient becomes insane\r\nor saves himself from that by suicide. No wonder, then, that many a\r\none of these patients takes to the use of habit-forming drugs to\r\nproduce sleep. These, though effective only to a small degree, soothe\r\nhim for the time, but finally render him such a wreck that there is\r\nnot even will power enough for him to take his own life and end his\r\nintolerable suffering.\r\n\r\nSuch gruesome pictures of the awful effects of insomnia run rife and\r\nproduce dreads in the community until just as soon as the ordinary\r\nnervous supersensitive person loses an hour or two of sleep two or\r\nthree nights in a month, he begins to conjure up the specter of\r\ninsomnia with its awful terrors and still more awful possibilities,\r\nand begins to bewail the fate that has chosen him as an unfortunate\r\nvictim. This exaggerated dread that slight losses of sleep, for which\r\nthere are often excellent reasons, will develop into an incurable\r\ncondition of persistent wakefulness has more to do than any other\r\nsingle factor with the production of the state called insomnia which\r\nis, however, never half as bad as it is pictured.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolute Sleeplessness.--A certain number of patients insist that they\r\nsleep very little at night and some tell their friends and even their\r\nphysicians quite ingenuously that they sleep none at all, and that\r\nthis has been the case with them for a prolonged period. Practically\r\nevery physician has heard such stories, and at the beginning of his\r\nprofessional career has usually wondered how the patients continued to\r\nlive and enjoy reasonably good health in spite of the lack of\r\nabsolutely necessary brain cell rest. After the physician has the\r\nopportunity to investigate some of these stories he understands them\r\nbetter. Patients in hospital, who insist that they are wakeful all the\r\nnight, prove usually when faithfully watched by a nurse to be wakeful\r\nfor an hour or two at the beginning of the night and then to sleep for\r\nhours at a time, and all of them sleep for intervals more or less\r\nprolonged, though they may wake a number of times during the night and\r\nmay think that they have not been asleep because they hear the clock\r\nregularly or some other recurring noise. It is improbable that\r\npatients ever spend several nights in succession without sleep and\r\ntheir story is only an index of the persuasion that they are under\r\nthat they do not sleep, though they are having so many thoroughly\r\nrestful intervals that their brain cells suffer but little from {652}\r\nthe need of sleep. _Indeed, the principle source of nervous wear and\r\ntear for them consists in their persuasion that they do not sleep and\r\nthe resultant impelling suggestion that a breakdown must before long\r\nbe inevitable._\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual Differences.--There are too many safeguards in nature's\r\nordinary dealings with human beings for us to think that people can\r\npass many nights absolutely without rest. Brain cells may apparently\r\nbe very wakeful, they may be quite ready to take up at once and\r\nseemingly without a break trains of thought interrupted sometime\r\nbefore, yet somehow they succeed in obtaining their needed rest. In\r\nthis matter, as is well known, though it needs to be emphasized again\r\nfor the benefit of nervous individuals, different people have very\r\ndifferent needs. Some require many continuous hours of sleep or they\r\nsoon begin to have symptoms of nervous exhaustion. Others live on only\r\nwith snatches of sleep at intervals, or with interrupted sleep during\r\na limited portion of the twenty-four hours, yet enjoy good health for\r\nmany years. A few seem to be able to live in health and strength with\r\nbut a few hours of sleep. It may possibly be thought that those who\r\nare living their lives with a small amount of sleep are drawing drafts\r\non their future vital powers, and that what they make up in intensity\r\nof activity now by shortening sleep, they will discount by shortness\r\nof life. How utterly untrue this impression is, however, will be best\r\nunderstood from the fact that many of the men who have worked hardest\r\nand slept the least number of hours in the day, have lived to be\r\neighty or even ninety years of age and some of them have even been\r\ncentenarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nCell Rest.--The great differences in the brain cells of different\r\nindividuals in what concerns sleep becomes more readily intelligible\r\nwhen we recall the extreme differences as regards the need of rest of\r\nthe various cells in the same individual. While the brain cells seem\r\nto require for healthy life, as a rule, nearly one-third of the time,\r\nand a man who is constantly taking much less than eight hours of sleep\r\nis probably hindering rather than helping his productiveness,\r\nespecially if his work is intellectual, there are cells in the body\r\nthat need no such amount of rest as this. Peristaltic movements occur\r\nin the digestive tract almost constantly, with only short intervals,\r\nand these cells get their rest between their movements. Pulmonary\r\ncells and tissues must do the same thing, and are able to do it\r\nwithout any special strain being put on them. The extreme example of\r\nthe lack of need for prolonged rest is found in the heart. Two-fifths\r\nof every second the cells of this organ have a rest during the\r\ndiastole, but during the remaining three-fifths of every second for\r\nall of life they must not only be ready to work but actually engaged\r\nin it or serious symptoms ensue. The cells in the brain that subtend\r\ncardiac and respiratory activity must be even more able to do without\r\nrest, since their action is ceaseless during life. By analogy with\r\nthese it is not difficult to understand that the brain cells which are\r\ninvolved in consciousness should on occasion be able to stand\r\nprolonged periods of activity, or at least of wakefulness. Persistent\r\nwakefulness does not appeal to us as so surely destructive after this\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolicitude Over Sleep.--For those who are much disturbed by the loss\r\nof even slight amounts of sleep and who are prone to complain rather\r\nbitterly if they are not able to get more than five or six hours a\r\nnight, I find it a useful preliminary to any more formal treatment of\r\ntheir so-called insomnia {653} to recall the examples of some of the\r\ngreat workers who succeeded in accomplishing marvelously good work\r\nthough they took much less sleep than the amount the patient secures,\r\nyet seems to think inadequate. In spite of such lack of sleep, these\r\nworkers lived to advanced old age. There are many well-authenticated\r\nillustrations of this in recent times. Perhaps the most striking\r\ntestimony to the power of the human mind to continue work without\r\nrequiring the refreshment of sleep, except for very short periods, is\r\nthat of Humboldt, the great traveller, scientist writer and diplomat.\r\nMax Mueller, in his autobiography tells the story. It was when he\r\nhimself was about forty. Humboldt said to him: \"Ah! Max, when I was\r\nyour age I had time to accomplish something, now I find that I must\r\ntake at least five hours of sleep every night.\" At the moment\r\nHumboldt was over eighty. Mueller said to him: \"But, Your Excellency,\r\nhow much sleep, then, did you take when you were my age?\" \"Oh!\" he\r\nsaid, \"I used to turn the light down, throw myself on the lounge for a\r\ncouple of hours, and then get up and go on with my work again.\"\r\nHumboldt, after a life full of the hardest kind of work of many kinds,\r\nlived well past ninety in the full vigor of his intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nThere are many other examples that might readily be quoted. The\r\ntraditions of the University of Berlin contain many illustrations of\r\nmen who did very little sleeping, yet succeeded in accomplishing an\r\nimmense amount of work and lived far beyond the Psalmist's limit.\r\nVirchow, whom I knew very well, did not take more than four or five\r\nhours of sleep on most nights in the year. He would be in the Lower\r\nHouse of the Prussian Legislature, which, like the House of Commons,\r\nholds its meetings late at night, until one A. M. or later and would\r\nbe at his laboratory shortly after seven. There was a tradition at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin in my time there of one of the older professors\r\nin the theological department who went to bed only every alternate\r\nnight. He had a forty-eight-hour day for work with a seven-hour break.\r\nHe lived to the age of eighty-five. I know one of our most\r\ndistinguished workers in medicine here in America who was so busy and\r\nso tired at the end of his day that he could not write his book. He\r\nwould fall asleep on his chair at his desk to wake up only when the\r\nmilkman came in the morning. He had constructed for himself a special\r\nstool without back or sides, shaped like a bench, so that whenever he\r\nfell asleep on it he fell off. The fall would wake him up and he would\r\nthen go on with his work for some hours. He did this sort of thing for\r\nmany years, and yet he is alive and in the full possession of\r\nintellectual health at the age of eighty-three. He learned this\r\nexpedient from a German professor of medicine who told him of it and\r\nat the same time told him that it was no uncommon practice among\r\nGerman professors. Indeed, most of the famous long-livers of the\r\nnineteenth century were also well known for the small amount of sleep\r\nthey required, and apparently there is no need of being anxious lest\r\nloss of sleep should prove serious, unless one is adding to whatever\r\ndetriment to health it may be by worrying about it find so setting two\r\ndamaging factors at work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nProbably the most important immediate assurance that can be given to\r\nthose who come complaining of insomnia is that practically no one has\r\never {654} been seriously hurt by the wakefulness called insomnia.\r\nPatients suffering from brain tumors, from serious disturbance's of\r\ncerebral circulation that give objective signs, from various organic\r\ndiseases, as of the heart or liver, or certain constitutional\r\ndiseases, have been made worse by the wakefulness induced by their\r\naffections. In the cases where there were no definite objective signs\r\nand wakefulness was the only symptom we have no cases on record of\r\nserious injury resulting. Men have come complaining of wakefulness for\r\ndays or weeks and sometimes, though it is strange to understand it,\r\nfor months or even years, and yet have lived their lives without\r\nserious developments and have neither gone into insanity nor into any\r\npremature loss of vitality, much less a fatal termination. It is not\r\nsubjective symptoms but objective signs that are of value for the\r\ndiagnosis of the serious organic conditions. This reassurance lifts a\r\nload from patients' minds at once and does more than anything else to\r\nrelieve them of the burden of solicitude which is the main factor in\r\nthe continuance of their insomnia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestive Treatment.--The psychotherapy of sleep consists in changing\r\nthe patient's attitude of mind toward his sleep. It is quite\r\nimpossible for him to sleep normally and regularly if he worries much\r\nabout it and if the afternoon and evening hours are mainly spent in\r\nwondering whether he will sleep, anxious as to when he is going to\r\nsleep like other people, marvelling how long he will last in health\r\nand sanity if his tendency to wakefulness continues. There is no\r\nfactor so strong in insomnia as getting one's self on one's mind. It\r\nweighs as an intolerable burden, an incubus that is sure to keep its\r\nsubject awake. Insomnia is a mental and not a physical ailment in much\r\nmore than nine out of every ten cases. It is not the brain but the\r\nmind that is at fault. Patients must be made to realize that if they\r\ngo quietly to bed, confident that if they do not sleep the early part\r\nof the night they will sleep later, and that in case they should lose\r\nconsiderable sleep, so long as they lie quietly for eight hours in\r\nbed, their physical organism is not likely to come to any serious\r\ntrouble. They must be quiet, peaceful and unworried. They must not\r\nbegin to toss at the first sign of not going promptly to sleep for by\r\nso doing they may put off completely the possibility of falling to\r\nsleep. Finally they must prepare for sleep by passing a quiet evening,\r\nas a rule, occupied with diversions of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThere are many factors which inhibit sleep that must be removed or at\r\nleast obviated. These are very different in different individuals and\r\nthe suggestion of getting them out of the way helps a great deal in\r\nmaking people realize that they are better prepared for sleep than\r\nbefore. They have been keeping themselves awake by contrary\r\nunfavorable suggestions. They must be taught to aid themselves in\r\ngoing to sleep by a series of favorable suggestions attached to the\r\ndoing of certain things that are helpful and, above all, avoiding acts\r\nof various kinds that have an unfavorable suggestive influence. In\r\nthis way an accumulation of suggestions can be secured that will prove\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs.--Of course, patients must be warned with regard to the taking\r\nof drugs. Certain drugs may be taken for an occasional loss of a\r\nnight's sleep, where the loss of sleep is regular and frequent,\r\nhowever, drugs are sure to do more harm than good. Opium leads to a\r\nserious habit, chloral is dangerous because it must be increased, most\r\nof the coal-tar somnifacients produce {655} serious after results and\r\ntheir physical effect is in the end probably more deleterious than\r\nwould be the loss of the sleep which they are supposed to counteract.\r\nThis is true for even the vauntedly least harmful of them, and it is\r\nimportant to make patients understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Conditions to be Inhibited.--In the treatment of insomnia two\r\nsets of inhibitory conditions are particularly to be looked to, those\r\nexternal to the patient, and those internal. Unless every possible\r\nobstacle is removed there can be no assurance of the relief of\r\nsleeplessness, while very often the careful regulation of a few\r\nconditions that are disturbing the patient will bring sleep fully and\r\npromptly. It is curious what small annoyances will sometimes prove\r\ndisturbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Pillow_.--I have found patients who had heard somewhere the idea\r\nthat it was natural for man to sleep without a pillow. The pillow in\r\nthis theory was supposed to be an added refinement of men in a state\r\nof luxury, but a real degeneration opposed to nature, and the many\r\npresumed benefits of sleeping on a perfectly level mattress with the\r\nhead no higher than the rest of the body was emphasized. While in\r\nordinary health these patients had found that after the preliminary\r\ndiscomfort of getting used to sleeping without a pillow, they were\r\napparently the better for it. People will feel better for almost\r\nanything if they are only persuaded that they ought to. After a\r\ncertain length of time, however, worry or work had a tendency to keep\r\nthem more or less wakeful and then insomnia came on, that is, for\r\nseveral hours at the beginning of the night they did not go to sleep\r\nand became very much worried about it.\r\n\r\nIn several of these cases I have found one of the most helpful\r\nadjuncts to more direct treatment of their wakefulness was the\r\nrestoration of the pillow. Just how the hygienic theory of pillowless\r\nsleep originated, or on what it is supposed to be founded, I do not\r\nknow. The only theory of sleep that seems to have many adherents at\r\npresent is that it is due to brain anemia. With the head a little\r\nhigher than the rest of the body the force of gravity tends to help in\r\nthe production of this brain anemia. The experience of mankind seems\r\nto confirm this. Certainly, from the earliest records of history men\r\nhave slept with something under their head, even though they could\r\nfind nothing better than a log or a stone. To sleep without a pillow\r\nis, owing to the conformation of the head and neck and shoulders,\r\nalmost inevitably to sleep mainly on the back. From the anatomical\r\nrelations of the internal organs it is easy to understand that\r\nsleeping on the side is more comfortable and healthy than sleeping on\r\nthe back and hence most people naturally take this position.\r\nRelaxation is much more complete and comfort is greater. What the\r\nmajority of men do is almost surely dictated by instinct, and instinct\r\nis the most precious guide we have in the natural functions of life.\r\nWe are not so differently formed from the animals that the analogy\r\nfrom their habits should not have some weight for us. Patients should\r\nthen be advised always to sleep with a reasonably firm pillow, not too\r\nlow, so that the head is a little higher than the body and the lateral\r\nposition perfectly comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Too high Pillow_.--There is an abuse in the other direction of too\r\nhigh a pillow that deserves to be noted. Occasionally the physician\r\nhears complaints of waking up with tired feelings in the large muscles\r\nof the back of the neck near their insertion into the occiput. This is\r\nsometimes complained of {656} as an occipital headache. Not\r\ninfrequently it will be found that these people are sleeping on\r\npillows that are too large, or that they pile up several of them. Most\r\nphysicians have found in their experience that having the head quite a\r\nlittle higher than the rest of the body materially aided sleep,\r\nespecially in elderly people. This is true even when there is no\r\ndistinct heart lesion, but this favorable position is best secured not\r\nby means of one or more high pillows, but by raising the head of the\r\nbed, or by the insertion of bolsters beneath the mattress, so that\r\nthere is a gentle slope upward from the hips to the head. High pillows\r\nshould, as a rule, be discouraged, especially in young folks where the\r\nassumption of the strained positions which they cause, may encourage\r\nvarious deformities in the anatomy of the head and shoulders so that\r\nstoop shoulders or a craned neck result. On the other hand, before\r\nattempting to give drugs to elderly people, the arrangement of the\r\nmattress so as to put the head a foot, or even more, higher than the\r\nbody should be tried and will often be found to give relief where\r\nother things fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discomfort Due to Cold_.--In order to sleep well patients must be\r\nthoroughly comfortable in bed. In recent years as the very hygienic\r\npractice of having a window in the sleeping apartment open has become\r\na rule among intelligent people, sleeping rooms have been much colder\r\nthan they used to be. Care must be taken lest the active factor in\r\ncausing wakefulness should be cold. Over and over again I have found\r\nthat patients who complain of wakefulness, in the latter part of the\r\nnight particularly, that is, in the early morning, were awakened by\r\nthe increasing cold because they were insufficiently clothed. Whenever\r\nthe sleeping room becomes very cold, then, the patient should not\r\nsleep between cotton or linen sheets which are likely to induce\r\nsensations of chilliness, but in a light woolen nightgown. It is\r\ncurious what a difference in the patient's feelings is produced by the\r\ntouch of wool to the skin in cold weather as compared with cotton.\r\nThin, anemic patients are especially likely to suffer from chilliness.\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that some stout people, in spite of\r\nan accumulation of fat, are really anemic. Their red blood corpuscles\r\nand hemoglobin are distinctly below normal. These constitute some of\r\nthat large class of stout women in whom reduction cures fail because\r\nof the anemic tendency. They must be as carefully protected from cold\r\nas thinner persons, yet they need fresh air for their comfort and\r\nhealth almost as much as tuberculosis patients. The experience of\r\nsanatoria in the Adirondacks and at altitudes generally shows that for\r\nquiet, undisturbed sleep, if the room becomes distinctly cold during\r\nthe night because of an open window, a hood or night-cap and gloves,\r\nas well as the wearing of woolen underclothing, even to stockings, is\r\nalmost indispensable. In older times, when houses were not well\r\nheated, many persons very sensibly wore night caps. Now that a return\r\nto cold fresh air in the sleeping room has come many will have to\r\nresume the old night-cap habit in spite of cosmetic objections to it.\r\nThese may seem little things, but they count very much in relieving\r\ndisturbed sleep. The curious thing about them is that patients\r\nthemselves seldom realize that certain common-sense regulations are\r\nmore important for sleep than formal remedies. They want to be \"cured\"\r\nof their insomnia, not relieved by suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cold Feet_.--A large number of people have their sleep at the\r\nbeginning of the night seriously disturbed by cold feet. Some cannot\r\nget to sleep for {657} an hour or more, because their feet are cold.\r\nIf the patients become worried over this loss of sleep, a real\r\ninsomnia may develop. It is for these people that the old-fashioned\r\nwarming-pan was invented and it should not be forgotten that the\r\nsymptom can be relieved very promptly by means of a hot-water bag or a\r\nhot brick wrapped in flannel at the foot of the bed. An excellent\r\npractice for very sensitive persons, is to have the sheets warmed\r\nthoroughly for a couple of hours before bedtime. This is especially\r\nimportant in damp weather.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished English surgeon. Sir Henry Thompson, who lived well\r\nbeyond eighty years of age (when surely he would seem to have some\r\nright to do so), wrote a little book on how to be well and grow old\r\nand describes a habit which he had acquired and that I have often\r\nrecommended to patients and friends as well as used myself with\r\nadvantage when there is a tendency to cold feet, either habitually or\r\noccasionally. It is, moreover, useful whenever there is a tendency to\r\ninsomnia because some exciting occupation has preceded going to bed.\r\nBefore retiring Sir Henry used to sit beside his bath tub and let the\r\nhot water flow into it over his feet, gradually becoming warmer and\r\nwarmer, until he could no longer stand the heat. A temperature well\r\nabove 120 degrees may be borne with comfort after a while, though at\r\nthe beginning it would seem entirely too hot. The feet are kept in the\r\nhot water at least five minutes. When taken out they should be\r\nthoroughly red and show evidence of a good deal of blood having been\r\nattracted to them. If they are now carefully wiped and rubbed\r\nvigorously there will usually be no further tendency to cold feet that\r\nnight and sleep will come naturally. Sir Henry said that when he had\r\nbeen out at meetings where he had to make an address or had to take\r\npart in business of any kind that inclined to make him wakeful, he\r\nfound this an excellent method of preparing himself for immediate\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the worst forms of cold feet are found\r\namong those suffering from flatfoot. The dropping of the arch\r\ninterferes with the return circulation and also with lymphatic\r\ncirculation. These individuals feel very tired because of their foot\r\ncondition, yet their cold feet often disturbs their sleep at the\r\nbeginning of the night. The only effective relief for this is afforded\r\nby proper treatment of the feet. (See the chapter on Foot Troubles.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lack of Air_.--On the other hand, occasionally it happens in spite of\r\nall that has been said in recent years about fresh air in sleeping\r\nrooms, windows are hermetically sealed and even then people cover\r\nthemselves with many thicknesses of bed clothing and are too warm. I\r\nhave found over and over again that where people could not be\r\npersuaded to leave a window open all night (and when they are old and\r\ndeeply prejudiced in the matter I do not insist, for the suggestion of\r\npossibly catching cold would almost surely keep them awake), the\r\nthorough airing of rooms before retiring made a great difference in\r\nthe sleep of elderly people. When patients are young, I simply insist\r\non the window being wide open for some time before they go to bed and\r\nslightly during the night, except in extreme cold weather. Many a\r\npatient who complains of waking several times during the night and\r\nbeing awake for some time on each occasion will begin to have longer\r\nperiods of sleep without a break if such a change in the ventilation\r\nof the room is effected. {658} Anyone who has seen fever patients who\r\nhad been restless, disturbed and wakeful, sink into a quiet slumber\r\nafter the room has been thoroughly aired and the temperature of it\r\nreduced ten or fifteen degrees, will realize how helpful this same\r\nmethod of treatment will be in nervous, wakeful irritability.\r\n\r\nHow important air is for the obtaining of the power to sleep for many\r\nhours every day can be best understood and appreciated from the habits\r\ninsisted on for patients in tuberculosis sanatoria as a result of\r\nexperience. When there is any tendency to a rise in temperature in\r\nthese patients they are kept absolutely without exercise. They are\r\neither in bed or on a lounging chair all day, but they are out in the\r\nair or at least close to an open window. As a rule, they sleep some in\r\nthe morning and then they sleep again in the afternoon. This would\r\nordinarily be fatal to sleep at night in even healthy people taking\r\nconsiderable exercise and therefore presumably tired and more likely\r\nto sleep than these patients who had made no exertion during the\r\ntwenty-four hours; but it is not often, after patients have been for\r\nten days or two weeks at the sanatorium, that there is any complaint\r\nof lack of sleep at night. This is true in spite of the fact that\r\npatients are often wakened by coughing during the night, yet after a\r\ncomparatively short interval they go to sleep again and sleep until\r\nmorning. This is not true when patients do not pass most of their time\r\nin the open air and when their rooms are not well aired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep at Sea.--I know nothing that is more effective in doing away\r\nwith insomnia than a sea voyage. The passengers sit on their lounging\r\nchairs all the morning in the open air, usually sleeping for some\r\ntime, often for several hours. During the afternoon this is repeated.\r\nIn spite of this extra sleep they turn in, not long after ten, and\r\nsleep well until morning. There is practically no exercise and the air\r\nusually excites such an appetite that five and even six meals a day\r\nare consumed. There is no disturbance of digestion unless some special\r\nexcess is indulged in, and, above all, sleep is rather favored than\r\nimpaired by the large amount of food taken. This experience which is\r\nso common, is very valuable as indicating just what is the best\r\npre-requisite for sleep. It is not exercise and tiredness to such a\r\ndegree that one fairly drops from fatigue, but such an oxidation of\r\nall tissues by the breathing of pure air that there are no toxic waste\r\nproducts left in the system to act as excitants for disturbance of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold Water.--In summer, when wakefulness is due to heat, a cool bath,\r\nor at least a rub down with cold water and going to bed without drying\r\nis an excellent method of inviting sleep. Under these circumstances\r\nthe sheet acts as a soothing cool pack and people who have been\r\nwakeful for hours before, or at least have found considerable\r\ndifficulty in getting to sleep, sleep promptly. The mechanism of\r\nsleep-production is easy to understand. There is less blood to go to\r\nthe brain when the little capillaries at the surface are pretty well\r\nextended and after the application of cool water the reaction which\r\nfollows the closing of the capillaries in response to cold leaves them\r\nof sufficient size to accommodate a large amount of the blood of the\r\nbody. Of course, in both cases there is the suggestive value of a\r\nproceeding of this kind so well calculated to predispose the patient's\r\nmind to go to sleep without solicitude.\r\n\r\n{659}\r\n\r\nDiet.--As has already been outlined in the hints that precede, the\r\nfirst thing in the treatment of insomnia is to remove any causes that\r\nmay be at work in producing wakefulness. Among the most common of\r\nthese in our modern life is the taking of coffee or tea, important in\r\nthe order mentioned. Every physician has frequent experiences of\r\npeople who complain of insomnia, yet who take a cup of coffee late at\r\nnight. A large proportion of humanity cannot do this with impunity and\r\nexpect to go to sleep promptly. Occasionally one finds that patients\r\ncomplaining of sleeplessness are taking three to five cups of coffee a\r\nday. This must be stopped. A physician may be told by such patients\r\nthat they cannot get along without their coffee. I have only one\r\nanswer for this and it is meant to show patients that if they want to\r\nsleep they must take the means to secure it and, above all, must\r\nremove all disturbing factors. I tell them that if they cannot do\r\nwithout coffee they may continue to do without sleep. If they want to\r\nsleep they must give up coffee or at least must limit the amount. I\r\nhave found it comparatively easy to get people to limit coffee-taking\r\nby the suggestion that there should be one tablespoonful of strong\r\ncoffee taken to a cup of hot milk. This gives the taste, or rather the\r\naroma of coffee, for coffee has properly no taste to speak of, and\r\nwhile, at first, patients crave the stimulation they have been\r\naccustomed to, it takes but a few days to overcome this craving\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nUsually it is easy to get people to confess that they are taking too\r\nmuch coffee. For some reason not easy to understand it is harder to\r\nget them to acknowledge that they are taking too much tea. Coffee is\r\ntaken with a certain amount of deliberation. Tea may be and often is\r\ntaken at odd intervals for friendliness' sake and sometimes patients\r\ndo not know how much they are taking. Six or seven cups a day may be\r\ntheir usual quota, yet they do not realize it and at first are\r\ninclined to answer that they take it only two or three times a day,\r\nforgetting the little potations between meals. Tea is not so prone to\r\ncause wakefulness as coffee, yet the toxic irritant principle in both\r\nis the same and when the amount of tea and its strength are\r\nsufficient, the same results follow. The tea habit must always be\r\ngiven up if there is complaint of lack of sleep, especially early in\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThere is a very common persuasion that the eating of food in any\r\nquantity shortly before going to bed, and especially the eating of\r\ncertain materials, will keep people awake. It is well known, however,\r\nthat there are a great many people who can eat anything and sleep well\r\nafter it and young children sleep best when their stomachs are full.\r\nThere are undoubtedly idiosyncrasies in this matter that must be\r\nrespected, but many patients are deceiving themselves. They are eating\r\ntoo little and their wakefulness is more due to the mental state than\r\nto anything else. As this contradicts a very prevalent impression, I\r\nmay say that it is said deliberately and only after much experience\r\nwith people inclined to be over-solicitous about their diet and their\r\nhealth generally and who were actually producing wakefulness or at\r\nleast very light dreamful sleep, by their elimination from their diet,\r\nand especially from their evening meal, of many nutritious substances.\r\nI make it a rule to insist with patients that if it is more than five\r\nhours since their last meal they must take a glass of milk and some\r\ncrackers or a cup of cocoa and something to eat before going to bed.\r\nThis is particularly important if they have been out in the air much\r\nbetween their last meal and bedtime.\r\n\r\n{660}\r\n\r\nThe Evening Hours.--The use of the hours after the evening meal is an\r\nextremely important factor with regard to insomnia. If the patient\r\ntries to read the paper or some conventionally interesting magazine or\r\nbook, thoughts of the possibility of his not sleeping will surely\r\nobtrude themselves and he will fail to get to sleep when he lies down.\r\nAs a matter of fact, he will have so disturbed himself as to\r\npredispose to insomnia. Some quiet occupation, interesting yet not too\r\ninteresting, that diverts the mind from the thoughts about itself and\r\nabout sleep possibilities, yet does not excite it, is the best\r\npossible auxiliary and preparation for sleep. Prof. Oppenheim has, as\r\nusual, said this very well in his \"Letters to Nervous Patients,\" to\r\nwhich we have turned so often:\r\n\r\n  A great deal depends upon the right use of the evening hours. On no\r\n  account let yourself occupy them with anxious forebodings about the\r\n  night. But, on the other hand. It is not at present wise to take up\r\n  your mind with too exciting thoughts, as the strong after-impression\r\n  of feeling and fancy may counteract the tendency to sleep. You must\r\n  find out for yourself whether a quiet game (cards, halma, chess, or\r\n  patience), the reading of a serious or an amusing book, the perusal\r\n  of an illustrated paper, or a chat with a friend will be most\r\n  certain to give you that tranquillity of mind through the vestibule\r\n  of which you will pass into the temple of sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect Sleep Suggestions.--Many plans are suggested by which people\r\nare supposed to be able to get to sleep. A favorite and very old\r\nsuggestion is that of counting sheep go over a fence or something of\r\nthat kind that is merely mechanical, yet takes the mind from other\r\nthoughts. As a rule, any plan involving mental occupation that is\r\nmeant to produce sleep is likely to react and do harm rather than\r\ngood. Sleep must not be wooed deliberately but must be allowed to come\r\nof its own sweet will. It is extremely important that exciting\r\nthoughts and bothering interests be put aside, not at the moment when\r\nwe want to go to sleep, but some considerable time before. This is not\r\nalways an easy matter and often requires careful planning. It is worth\r\nwhile doing it, however, in order to secure sleep promptly and not\r\nallow a prolonged period to pass while one is lying awake, for if\r\nnervous irritability ensues wakefulness is still further prolonged and\r\nthe patient may begin to toss and so disarrange the bedclothing and\r\ndisturb himself as to prepare for several hours of sleeplessness which\r\nwould not have occurred if there had been an appropriate interval\r\ngiven to preparing the mind for sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiminishing Solicitude.--Patients must not be too anxious for sleep.\r\nIf they worry themselves over the possibility of not sleeping then\r\nthey will almost surely disturb their sleep, or at least delay its\r\ncoming. The ideal state of mind is not to bother one's head about it,\r\nto lie down habitually at a given hour, compose one's self to sleep\r\nwith assurance and then wait its coming without solicitude. Many\r\npeople will say this is not easy to do, but habit makes it easy. Most\r\nof our animal life is lived by habit. We are hungry at certain times\r\nby habit. Our bowels move at a particular time by habit. We can sleep\r\nby habit. If we try to use our intellect solicitously with regard to\r\nany of these habitual functions we do much more harm than good. The\r\nmore anxiety there is about sleep the more likely it is to be\r\ndisturbed. When the habit of sleep at a particular hour has been\r\nbroken the best way to regain it is to lie down at that particular\r\nhour and then wait patiently for {661} the advent of sleep. If\r\nimpatience gets the better of us sleep is kept off and will not come\r\nfor hours. If the patient can lie down feeling \"Well, if I do not\r\nsleep now I will to-morrow morning\" then there is usually little\r\ndifficulty about sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dread of Consequences_.--Many people who suffer from insomnia fear\r\nthat their loss of sleep will injure their intellectual capacity or\r\nmake them prematurely aged, or drain their vitality so that they will\r\nnot have health and strength of mind and body when they grow old. This\r\nadds to their solicitude about themselves and inveterates their\r\ncondition. There is only one answer to this dread, which has no\r\nfoundation in what we know of actualities, and that is, to tell them\r\nthe experience of certain persons which absolutely contradicts such a\r\nnotion. One distinguished physician who, at the age of seventy-five,\r\nis writing books that are attracting widespread attention and is doing\r\nan amount of work that many a younger man might envy, has told me of\r\nall that he suffered from insomnia between the ages of thirty and\r\nfifty-five. His mental productivity was much hampered at that time by\r\nhis wakefulness and anxiety with regard to it. He feared the worst as\r\nregards advancing years, yet he is in the full possession of mental\r\nand bodily strength well beyond the Psalmist's limit. His is not an\r\nexceptional case, for there are many others in my own personal\r\nknowledge. Virchow once told me of years when he suffered from\r\ninsomnia, yet he lived to be well past eighty and then died, not from\r\nnatural causes, but from an injury. A man who accomplished an immense\r\namount of work in his day in the organization of a great university\r\nsuffered from insomnia in his younger years to such a degree that his\r\nfriends and even he himself feared for his mental stability,\r\neventually overcame this symptom completely and went on to years of\r\ngreat active work, dying in the end, not from his head, but his heart.\r\nWe have records of a number of such cases. Few of the hard students of\r\nthe world went through life without having some bother from insomnia.\r\nIt is well-known, however, that many of the great thinkers,\r\ninvestigators and discoverers in philosophy and in science have lived\r\nlong lives well beyond the age of the generality of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Diversion.--The main thing is to banish the thoughts of one's\r\nordinary occupation as far as that can be accomplished without\r\nlaboring so intently at this as to give the mind another bothersome\r\noccupation. Many people find that a game of cards just before going to\r\nbed takes their thoughts off business and worry almost better than\r\nanything else. Something like this is needed in many people. Most\r\npeople must not write for some time before retiring, because writing\r\nproves so absorbing an occupation, as a rule, that the mind becomes\r\nthoroughly awake and then remains so for some time afterwards. Reading\r\nis better, but the reading must be chosen with proper care. An\r\nexciting story, for instance, may serve to keep one awake for hours,\r\nas everyone knows who has tried and found himself still reading at\r\nthree in the morning after having begun an interesting book. The\r\nreading of works of general information, of travels, of description of\r\nplaces, where it is comparatively easy to stop at any place, of short\r\nstories which do not hold the interest beyond a brief period, is much\r\nbetter. Osler's recommendation to have a classic author beside one's\r\nbed to be read for a few minutes every night after retiring as a\r\npreparation for sleep is an excellent remedy for the milder forms of\r\ninsomnia, as well as a stepping-stone to scholarship.\r\n\r\n{662}\r\n\r\nWilliam Black in one of his books has a description of an old man who\r\nhad suffered from insomnia very severely until he discovered a plan of\r\nhis own to enable him to get to sleep. This consisted in reading the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica. He began at the beginning and read straight\r\nahead, article after article, and volume after volume. He never even\r\nby any chance departed from this routine either to look up cross\r\nreferences, or read anything further about men who were mentioned in\r\nthe article he was going through at the moment and whose names\r\noccurred in another volume. He read straight on until his eyes got\r\nheavy and then he went to sleep. At the time he was introduced into\r\nthe story he had already read the whole work through twice and was, I\r\nthink, at \"D\" on the third reading. He had had considerable bother\r\nabout getting to sleep before he adopted this plan, but it proved an\r\nalways efficient somnifacients. There is a story about an old American\r\nfarmer who said that he read the dictionary over and over again for\r\nthe same purpose. The stories were short and disconnected, but they\r\nnever bothered his sleep, while his wife and daughters were sometimes\r\nkept up more than he thought was good for them by their interest in\r\nthe story paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Early Morning Wakefulness.--With regard to the\r\ndisturbance of sleep in the early morning hours there are certain\r\ninstructions to patients that have always seemed to me extremely\r\nimportant. Most of the patients who complain of wakefulness in the\r\nearly morning hours are really suffering from hunger at that time.\r\nThis is especially true with regard to those who stay up rather late\r\nat night. They have their last regular meal about seven or a little\r\nearlier, they get to bed at eleven or even later, and some of them,\r\nfollowing the old maxim that eating before sleep is likely to disturb\r\nit, go to bed on an empty stomach. Whenever more than four hours have\r\npassed since the last meal the stomach is quite empty, and after the\r\npreliminary fatigue has worn off and the sleep has become lighter and\r\nthe lack of nourishment more pronounced a vague sense of discomfort in\r\nthe abdominal region wakes them, though most of them do not realize\r\nthat they are disturbed by a craving for food. In a large number of\r\nthese cases I have found that the recommendation of a glass of milk\r\nand some crackers, or some simple cake, just before retiring does more\r\nthan anything else to lengthen sleep and prevent what has been\r\nlearnedly called matutinal vigilance.\r\n\r\nAfter emptiness of the digestive tract, the most prominent cause of\r\nwakefulness in the early morning is anxiety about the hour of rising\r\nor about some engagement that has to be kept in the early morning. I\r\nhave known patients who worked themselves up so much thinking over the\r\nnecessity for rising at a particular hour to catch a train, that they\r\nwere awake for several hours before they needed to be. Some are much\r\nmore inclined to this over-anxiety than others. If they move to the\r\ncountry where trains have to be caught regularly, their sleep may be\r\nseriously disturbed by this circumstance. If the trouble becomes acute\r\nthey must simply change their residence. If it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat they stay, then they must have someone to wake them at a definite\r\ntime. This must be someone on whom they can absolutely depend,\r\notherwise the old solicitude will reassert itself. This seems a small\r\nmatter, yet I have known serious cases of neurasthenia with annoying\r\ndigestive symptoms due to nothing else than this morning wakefulness\r\nconsequent upon overanxiety with regard to trains and other morning\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\n{663}\r\n\r\nHabits.--In the correction of troubles of sleep one of the\r\ndifficulties that the physician has to contend with when patients have\r\ngrown accustomed to staying up late and finally have so disturbed\r\ntheir sleep mechanism that symptoms of insomnia develop, is the\r\ndeclaration that there is no use for them going to bed early since\r\nthey cannot sleep. If a man has been accustomed for a long period to\r\ngo to bed between midnight and 2 a. m. and his habits are suddenly\r\nchanged so that he goes to bed at ten or even eleven, it is very\r\nlikely that for some time after retiring he will not sleep. If he\r\ngrows over-anxious he may toss and become somewhat feverish and then,\r\neven when the accustomed time for sleep comes, he may not secure it.\r\nBesides, the depression consequent upon failure to sleep when he has\r\nfulfilled his physician's directions and when he knows that this is\r\nconsidered an important adjuvant in his treatment, acts as a\r\ndistinctly discouraging factor. Under these circumstances it is\r\nimportant to recall to him that one habit can only be removed by the\r\nmaking of another. It may be necessary to send him to bed for awhile\r\nonly an hour earlier than before until he has grown accustomed to\r\ngoing to sleep somewhat sooner, and then this habit, in turn, be\r\nchanged to an earlier hour so as to secure all the sleep that is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn a word, insomnia is not a definite affection to be treated by\r\ngiving one or the other of one's favorite drugs, or if these should\r\nfail trying still others, but it is a condition of mind very often\r\npredisposed to by certain conditions of body. If this condition of\r\nmind can be adjusted by careful attention to the correction of\r\nwhatever may be physically out of order, then there is every reason to\r\nlook for definite improvement very soon and complete cure without any\r\ndelay. Insomnia is not the awful ailment that it is sometimes\r\npictured, nor all that it appears to the excited imagination of the\r\nyoung person who loses a few hours' sleep; but a manifold condition to\r\nbe dealt with very differently in different individuals, according to\r\nthe indications of the case. If the patient's confidence can be\r\nsecured that means more than almost anything else that can be done. If\r\na little patience is exercised in obtaining such definite details of\r\nthe mental state and of certain physical factors as may seem quite\r\ntrivial to the patient yet are really predisposing elements for his\r\naffection, the therapeutics become comparatively simple. It is the use\r\nof tact and judgment in this matter that means most, however, and then\r\nvery few drugs will be required. Between the habits consequent upon\r\nthe opiates and certain of the serious hemolytic conditions due to the\r\nabuse of coal-tar products, this is a consummation that may well be\r\nworked for assiduously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOME TROUBLES OF SLEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain annoying incidents in connection with sleep annoy those\r\naffected by them so much as to arouse them very completely from sleep\r\nand make them wakeful for a time. Nothing disturbs most people so much\r\nas the thought that some passing incident, a little out of the common,\r\nis quite individual and peculiar to them. If they are at all nervous\r\nthey are likely to think that it portends some serious ailment, either\r\npresent or about to {664} develop. Nothing reassures them more than to\r\nlearn that these incidents are not so uncommon as they imagine, indeed\r\nthat many of them are quite frequent, and, above all, that many people\r\nwho have had them are still alive and well beyond threescore and ten,\r\nand laughing at the fears of their earlier years.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting.--Perhaps one of the most annoying of these incidental\r\ntroubles is starting in sleep. It occasionally happens that just about\r\nthe time a person is dozing off he suddenly starts and, almost before\r\nhe realizes it, is fully awake, his heart beating emphatically and\r\nthere may even be a little feeling of oppression on the chest. The\r\ncause is not the same in all cases and individual differences are\r\nworth investigating. In most people this starting means that there is,\r\nfor the moment, some mechanical interference with the action of the\r\nheart and that a systole has been delayed and has been pushed through\r\nwith more force than usual because of this delay. A full stomach will\r\noccasionally cause this, especially if patients lie on their left\r\nsides. In some people even a drink of water taken just before retiring\r\nwill be sufficient weight to cause this interference with heart\r\naction. An accumulation of gas in the stomach will do it by pushing up\r\nagainst the diaphragm. Where there is a distinct tendency to the\r\naccumulation of gas in the stomach I have sometimes been sure that the\r\nexpansion of the gas consequent upon the cozy warmth of the patient in\r\nbed, or its greater effect upon the stomach because the relaxation of\r\nsleep affected even the stomach walls slightly, was the cause of it.\r\nIt happens more frequently in the old than it does in the young, but\r\nit is observed at all ages and patients are usually quite disturbed\r\nabout it, as, indeed, they are likely to be with regard to anything\r\nthat affects their hearts.\r\n\r\nThe thought that this forcible beat must mean some serious\r\npathological condition will obtrude itself on many people, and if it\r\ndoes sleep is sure to be disturbed. Even though there may be no\r\ndiscoverable lesion of the heart, these patients often, though they\r\nare physicians, will worry lest some underlying condition should be\r\ndeveloping. The first patient who ever described this symptom to me\r\ntold me of it while I was a medical student and he is still alive and\r\nin good health, though he is past seventy. At the time I went over him\r\nrather carefully with the idea that there might be an organic heart\r\nlesion, but found none. The prognosis of these cases is always\r\nfavorable, for there are many who suffer yet live long. I have found\r\nif to occur particularly in elderly people when they were a little\r\novertired on going to bed, or in anemic young people when they had had\r\nsomewhat more exertion than usual during the day. Unless there is\r\nreally some demonstrable heart lesion the start does not mean anything\r\nand patients can be reassured at once. They should be counselled\r\nagainst lying on the left side, though in some of them it will occur\r\neven while lying on the right side and then the mechanism of its\r\nproduction seems to be the gaseous over-distention of the stomach.\r\nPatients may be told at once that it occurs in a large number of\r\npeople and then, instead of lying awake and worrying about it as they\r\noften do, they learn simply to place themselves in a more comfortable\r\nposition and go to sleep again without solicitude. They would learn\r\nthis for themselves in the course of time, but the physician's\r\nreassurance will enable them to anticipate the lessons of experience\r\nand they will thus be saved worrying.\r\n\r\nAt times this starting from sleep seems due to some unusual noise. In\r\n{665} certain nervous states even slight noises produce an exaggerated\r\nreaction and there seems to be a surprising, almost hypnotic, acuity\r\nof hearing just at the moment when all the other senses are going to\r\nsleep. Any of the small noises that sound so loud in the stillness of\r\nthe night may serve to wake the patient so thoroughly after a\r\npreliminary doze that sleep is disturbed for some time. As a rule,\r\nhowever, such noises would not disturb people if they were in normal\r\nhealthy condition, or at least the disturbance would be only\r\nmomentary. The solicitous effort that some people make to get away\r\nfrom every possible noise is an attempt in the wrong direction. We\r\nhave heard of people building special houses, or noise-proof rooms in\r\nthe center of houses where they hoped it would be impossible to be\r\ndisturbed. What is needed is not so much an effort to secure\r\nabsolutely noiseless surroundings, which is almost impossible in any\r\ncircumstances, be it city or country, but to change the patient's\r\nphysical condition so that slight noises are not reacted to so\r\nexplosively. There are many general directions for this and certain\r\ndrugs, as the bromides, are of distinct service. On the other hand,\r\nthe taking of cinchona products seems often to emphasize it.\r\n\r\nI have found that two classes of nervous patients particularly were\r\nlikely to be disturbed by these starts in their sleep. The first class\r\nis perhaps the larger. They are the patients who do not eat enough.\r\nThey will usually be found to be underweight and to be nursing some\r\nthought with regard to their digestion, or some supposed idiosyncrasy\r\ntowards food that is keeping them below the normal weight for their\r\nheight. Nothing makes sleep lighter than a certain amount of hunger.\r\nThis hunger may be disguised so completely, or so covered up by the\r\npatient's persuasion that more food cannot be taken without serious\r\ngastric disturbance, that it may pass utterly unnoticed. When such\r\npatients are disturbed early in the night, it usually means that\r\nbesides taking a not quite sufficient amount of food they are taking\r\nmore tea or coffee or some stimulant than is good for them. I say some\r\nstimulant because in several cases that I investigated rather\r\ncarefully the cause seemed to be the alcohol taken with one of the\r\nlargely advertised patent medicines, a supposed digestive tonic,\r\nconsisting mainly of dilute alcohol, and really about as strong as\r\nwhiskey. When the tendency to be startled occurs in the early\r\nmornings, then people need to eat something simple just before they go\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nThe other class of cases who are likely to start at night in their\r\nsleep are those who do not get out into the air enough during the day\r\nor who sleep in rooms insufficiently ventilated. At the beginning of\r\nthe night the lack of ventilation makes the sleep light and easily\r\ndisturbed. After a certain number of hours have been spent in a badly\r\nventilated room the patient sinks into a rather deep sleep, which is\r\nlikely to be dreamy, however, and then he is rather hard to waken, but\r\nwakes not feeling rested, but on the contrary often heavier and more\r\ntired than on retiring. In these cases an investigation of the amount\r\nof air the patient is allowing to enter his sleeping room or that his\r\ncircumstances provide him with is extremely important. As for those\r\nwho do not get out enough during the day, it is easy to understand\r\nthat their sleep may be light. To them, as a rule, it will be a\r\nsurprise to find how much depth is added to their sleep by an\r\nadditional hour or two in the air. Commonly, people who do not get out\r\nmuch during the day are shivery and {666} suffer from cold, especially\r\nin the winter time, and so they are likely to keep their rooms rather\r\ntightly closed. In this case they have two reasons for a tendency to\r\nbe wakeful, which is emphasized if there are noises near them or if\r\nthere is anything that disturbs their sleep.\r\n\r\nIn young children, of course, it must not be forgotten that starting\r\nin sleep may be due to the twitching pains of a beginning tuberculous\r\njoint disease. At times the children are so young, or the symptoms so\r\nvague and the tenderness, if there is any, so deep, that the real\r\nsignificance of this may not be recognized. The most successful\r\ntreatment for these starting pains in children that has thus far been\r\nfound, forms a striking commentary on what we have just been saying\r\nwith regard to fitful sleep when ventilation is insufficient or when\r\nthe patient has not been out of doors enough during the day. The\r\nchildren from the New York hospitals who in recent years were taken\r\ndown to Sea Breeze during the autumn and winter and made to live in\r\nwards, the windows of which were constantly open so that the\r\ntemperature was often below fifty, so that doctors and nurses had to\r\nwrap themselves up warmly and sometimes cover their heads and their\r\nhands, had all been sufferers from these starting pains before this\r\nexperience, but gradually they lessened in frequency until after a few\r\nmonths the crying of a child at night because of these pains was\r\nextremely rare. The lesson is evident, and abundance of air not only\r\ncures tuberculous conditions, but also makes the nervous system so\r\nmuch less irritable that starting pains do not so easily affect it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoise.--Slight noises often make it impossible for nervous people to\r\nsleep. This is much more a question of personal sensitiveness and\r\nanxious expectancy and over-irritability than anything else. One\r\ndistinguished physician whom I knew was extremely sensitive to noise\r\nand would be awake for hours if wakened up early in the night by the\r\nslamming of a door or a call in the street or anything of the kind. He\r\nsuffered from insomnia to a noteworthy degree and found to his\r\nsurprise that he could sleep better on a train than anywhere else.\r\nAfter he had lost two or three nights of sleep he actually used to\r\nmake arrangements to take a berth on an express train going out of his\r\ncity, ride until the morning and then come back. He usually slept well\r\namidst all the noise and jar of the train, though he would be quite\r\nsleepless at home as the result of even slight noises. I have known\r\npeople suffering from insomnia who took a long ocean trip on a slow\r\nvessel and who slept well amidst all the noises of shipboard, but were\r\nlight sleepers after landing, and felt that they missed the noise and\r\nbustle. Of course, in these cases the rocking movements sometimes\r\npredispose to sleep. It is not the custom now to rock infants to sleep\r\nand a very definite agreement seems to have been come to among\r\npediatrists to forbid the practice as harmful. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that the instinct of the race in the matter was not at fault.\r\nRocking seems to relax a certain tension of muscles that of itself\r\nprevents the brain anemia which is the physiological basis of sleep.\r\nIt is extremely difficult for nervous people to relax themselves\r\ncompletely, and the rocking movements, by tending to help them in this\r\nmatter, are excellent predisposing factors. A rocking chair or a\r\nhammock furnish abundant proof of this.\r\n\r\nNoise in general, as regards its relation to sleep, is an extremely\r\nindividual matter. Habit plays the largest role in the matter. We all\r\nknow the {667} stories of men who have gone to great expense in order\r\nto build noise-proof rooms and yet have found afterwards that they did\r\nnot sleep well. The rustle of the bedclothes as their thoraxes rose\r\nand fell in respiration was enough to disturb them when they allowed\r\nthemselves to become over-sensitive about noise. We all know how\r\nimpossible sleep becomes with a rustle of a mouse in the wastepaper\r\nbasket, or the scratching of one on the wainscoting. On the other\r\nhand, anyone who has lived in a large city where past hundreds of\r\nthousands of homes the elevated trains thunder every few minutes all\r\nduring the night, or the trolley goes rolling by within a few feet of\r\nthe bed, knows, too, that a great many people become accustomed to\r\nnoises so as to be utterly undisturbed by them, though at the\r\nbeginning any such insensitiveness to noise seemed out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI remember having a patient who insisted that he could not sleep so\r\nnear the elevated. At the end of a week he had lost so many nights of\r\nsleep that he was almost in despair. If he did get sound asleep he\r\nsaid he used to hear the thunder of the elevated train coming toward\r\nhim in his dreams and he would begin to pull his feet up so as to get\r\nthem out of the way of the train, yet always with the feeling that he\r\ncould not get them quite far enough, until his knees were almost to\r\nhis chin. Under the influence of a little bromides, two hours more of\r\noutdoor air than he had been accustomed to before, and some\r\nreassurance that noise need not disturb sleep at all if taken\r\nphilosophically, he learned in the course of two weeks to sleep quite\r\npeacefully and now has lived for ten years where the elevated passes\r\nwithin ten feet of his window, which is wide open for seven months in\r\nthe year and always at least slightly open, except in the most stormy\r\nweather. It is a question, then, of the individual much more than his\r\nsurroundings. The problem is to predispose the mind to sleep and then\r\nthe senses will not disturb it except under special circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, noises usually disturb people very little at\r\nnight. The most surprising things can happen between 12 and 3 o'clock\r\nand attract no attention. Burglars calmly blow up a safe in a hotel\r\nconfident that if there is no one awake when the explosion occurs\r\nthere will be no investigation, because even though people wake up at\r\nthe noise, they will wait for its repetition in order to see what it\r\nmeans, will not get up to investigate, especially in cold weather, and\r\nusually promptly go to sleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLying Awake.--There are many people to whom lying awake carries with\r\nit a sense of discouragement and dread. They seem to forget that lying\r\nawake and occupation with pleasant thoughts may be made a very\r\nagreeable pastime by those who are not over-anxious to sleep and who\r\nlet the pleasant thoughts that may be suggested by the environment or\r\nthe noises that are heard flow through consciousness. Everyone knows\r\nhow pleasant it is or may be to listen to the rain patter on the roof\r\nof a country house, or to hear the murmur of the ocean or of the wind\r\nthrough the trees when there is not too much anxiety about to-morrow\r\nand to-morrow's occupations and the necessity for sleep to be ready\r\nfor them. Stewart Edward White, in his series of essays on \"The\r\nForest,\" has a chapter on Lying Awake at Night that can well be\r\nrecommended to the attention of those who complain bitterly of an hour\r\nof sleeplessness. Of course, in his case the lying awake is in the\r\nmidst of the forest with all the witchery of wind in the trees and the\r\n{668} unusual sounds of forest life, while ordinary lying awake is in\r\nthe rather monotonous environment at home, but still there is much\r\nthat can be said for his insistence that in peaceful brooding,\r\nfaculties revive while soft velvet fingers are laid on the drowsy\r\nimagination and you feel that in their caressing vaster spaces of\r\nthought are opened up. The impatience that comes to so many almost at\r\nonce if they fail to go to sleep promptly only serves to keep them\r\nawake just that much more surely.\r\n\r\nVery often, as suggested by Mr. White, this wakefulness occurs just\r\nwhen a good night's rest is surely expected. There is sometimes even a\r\npreliminary period of drowsiness. Then some little noise that\r\nordinarily would not be noticed at all floats into the consciousness\r\nwith a vigor that indicates that one sense is thoroughly awake. The\r\nvery surprise of it wakes up the other senses with a start and then\r\ncomes the thought that there is to be no sleep for some time. If this\r\nis resented, the period of wakefulness will be all the longer. If,\r\nwhen it has proved to be inevitable, one sits up quietly, reads a book\r\nfor a time, plays a quiet game of solitaire, it may be on a board kept\r\nbeside the bed for such purposes, or in some quiet way succeeds in\r\nbothering away the thought of insomnia, then almost surely sleep will\r\ncome after a time, quietly and restfully, and the lost period will not\r\nprove harmful. If nature does not want to sleep she must not be forced\r\ninto it, but gently led and after a time the wakefulness will\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Terrors.--One of the troubles of sleep that is more often called\r\nto the attention of the physician than almost any other, is the\r\nso-called \"night terrors\" of children. Little ones wake with a scream,\r\nsit up in bed, evidently terrified, usually trembling, and ready to\r\nseek refuge from something that has seriously disturbed them. Under\r\nDreams we have called attention to the fact that usually these terrors\r\nare due to a dream. Sometimes the dreams are the ordinary experience\r\nof supposed falling in sleep, from which the patients wake very much\r\nstartled, or they are repetitions of exciting scenes through which\r\nthey have passed, or of stories that they have heard, or, above all,\r\nplays that they have seen. Ghost stories, for instance, told shortly\r\nbefore they go to bed will often disturb children. Fairy stories and\r\nthe ordinary myths of childhood, usually with a happy ending and\r\nwithout any serious terrors in them, are not so likely to disturb\r\nthem. Melodramatic theatrical performances to which children lend\r\nthemselves and their attention with great concentration of mind, have\r\nnearly as much effect on them as if they passed through the actual\r\nscenes. Every physician knows how much a fright is likely to disturb a\r\nchild and cause it to wake many a night afterwards in a state of\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespiratory Interference.--It is particularly important to remember\r\nthat any interference with breathing will almost surely wake the child\r\nin a seriously startled condition. Adults are often affected by this\r\nsame sort of dream, due very often to some pathological condition in\r\nthe throat around which a series of dream ideas collect with somewhat\r\npoignant results. I have known a man suffering from elongated uvula\r\nwake up thinking that he was suffocating because, as he thought, he\r\nhad nearly swallowed his tongue, or at least had been trying to do so.\r\nThe sensation was so startling that it brought him to his feet at\r\nonce. I have known a patient traveling a long five-days' railroad\r\njourney and suffering severely from train catarrh, come to the {669}\r\npersuasion that he might suffocate during sleep because his nose was\r\ncompletely stopped up and he had not the habit of sleeping with his\r\nmouth open. As a result his sleep was as much disturbed by his mind as\r\nhis breathing. If these affect adults so strongly, it is easy to\r\nunderstand why children should be so frightened by them. Children who\r\nare mouth-breathers from adenoids or nasal obstruction, and still more\r\nthose whose nasal breathing apparatus is not completely stopped up,\r\nbut who are frequent intermittent mouth-breathers, are especially\r\nlikely to be troubled in this way. The neurosis known as nervous\r\ncroup, due to a spasm of the vocal cords, occurs oftenest in this\r\nclass of children and is an associated phenomenon to that of night\r\nterrors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleeping in the Light.--The habit of accustoming children to sleep\r\nwith a light in the room nearly always lessens the depth of their\r\nsleep. They are more easily wakened and their sleep is not so\r\nrefreshing. Besides, if they do not grow accustomed to the dark when\r\nthey are young, they may always retain a dread of the dark and will\r\nrequire some light in the room where they sleep. Nature intended that\r\nthe eyes and the optic nerve should have as complete a rest as\r\npossible and even with the lids lowered some light stimulus, if it is\r\npresent, finds its way to the nerve fibers. Hence the desirability of\r\nhaving as far as possible an absolutely dark room. For some very\r\ntimorous children, this may seem impossible. Many mothers will recall\r\nhow awful the dark seemed to them and what shadowy shapes loomed up in\r\nit. It will usually be found on inquiry, however, that in these cases\r\nthe children, after having been accustomed to sleep with some light\r\nand after having had all sorts of exciting pictures shown them and\r\nstories told them, were asked to sleep in the dark. From the very\r\nbeginning they should be accustomed to sleeping in the dark and then\r\nit has none of the terrors thus pictured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams, that is, thoughts and illusions and mental phenomena of\r\nvarious kinds that occur during sleep, have always been interesting to\r\nthe psychologist, and have usually been related to physicians by\r\npatients either because they were thought to have a significance\r\nrelated to disease, or because something in them disturbed the\r\npatient's mind. This is almost as true in the modern time as it was\r\nlong ago. It is curiously interesting to note that the very latest\r\ndevelopment of psychotherapy includes the use of hints obtained from\r\ndreams in order to determine the origin of psycho-neurotic conditions\r\nand certain of the minor psychic disturbances, and also as a\r\nfoundation for treatment. The oldest stories of therapeutics that we\r\nhave are those of patients waited on by the priest physicians of the\r\nolden times in the temples, who were supposed to be greatly helped by\r\ninformation obtained from the patient's dreams. It is interesting to\r\nread such recent studies as that of \"Incubation in the Old Temples,\"\r\nby Miss Ingersoll, with the thought in mind that we are once more\r\nanalyzing dreams in order to accomplish a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n{670}\r\n\r\nDreams are so often a source of disturbance of mind for patients, lead\r\nto such disturbed sleep, or even so affect the bodily health that it\r\nis important for anyone who wants to influence patients through their\r\nminds to know the significance attributed to dreams by the most recent\r\nstudies of them. This is all the more important because dreams are\r\nsuch a universal phenomenon. From our earliest years we dream. The\r\nnight terrors of children are probably due to dreams and show that\r\neven as early as the age of three we dream vividly. Doubtless some of\r\nthe terrifying dreams of childhood are similar to those that we\r\nexperience later. Dreams of falling, dreams of being cold, of being\r\nout of breath, with vivid repetitions of exciting scenes through which\r\nthey have gone during the day, or which they have seen in picture or\r\nbeen told in story, form the substance of these dreams. Children are\r\nlikely to be much disturbed by them. They wake in a terror of anxiety,\r\nin cold sweat, and crying bitterly because of their dream visions.\r\nOlder people are not so much disturbed at the moment, but often brood\r\nover dreams and may be seriously affected by them.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, however, to persuade many people that their dreams\r\nhave no special significance, either of present or of future evil, and\r\nto many the fact that they dream much becomes a suggestion of\r\nwakefulness that disturbs sleep and makes them quite unequal to the\r\nnext day's work, because they have the feeling that, as they have been\r\ndreaming all night, they must be quite tired. Tiredness in nervous\r\npeople is often a matter of the mental state rather than of physical\r\nexhaustion or genuine mental weariness. The actual place of dreams in\r\npsychology, then, becomes an important consideration in\r\npsychotherapeutics.\r\n\r\nOur real advances in the knowledge of the significance of dreams have\r\ncome from the study of the dreams that are common to most people.\r\nThese show us exactly how and why dreams occur and just what their\r\nmeaning is. Probably the most familiar dream common to all the human\r\nrace is that of falling from a height. Everyone has been wakened with\r\na startled sense of intense relief that the sensation of falling was\r\nillusory. The waking came just before the bottom was reached. There is\r\na tradition that if one ever did strike the bottom in one's dream it\r\nwould be the end and that death would result as surely as if the fall\r\nwere real. So far we have had no one come back to tell us of that, and\r\nthe tradition is reasonably safe from direct contradiction. It serves\r\nwithout any reason, however, to disturb timorous people and make them\r\ndread to fall asleep again. Often this dream-falling so seriously\r\naffects sensitive individuals that they do not get to sleep for an\r\nhour or more and occasionally those with an inclination to insomnia\r\nmay even suffer for the rest of the night from the effect of it. It is\r\nimportant to explain, then, what we know about the causation of the\r\ndream. In nearly all cases the subject on waking finds himself on his\r\nback, and then the inclination is at once to turn over to the side\r\nwith a sigh of relief. Commonly the dream occurs rather early in the\r\nnight, when a rather heavy meal has been taken shortly before\r\nretiring. The weight in the stomach, particularly if considerable\r\nliquid has been taken, seems to press upon the abdominal aorta and\r\ninterferes, to some extent at least, with the circulation to the legs.\r\nThis deprives little nerves at the periphery of the body of some of\r\ntheir nutrition and causes a tingling feeling in them. This is quite\r\ndifferent from pressure {671} on nerves, which gives the sensation\r\ntermed \"being asleep\" to a limb. This tingling feeling resembles that\r\nwhich we experience when going down rapidly in an elevator. It is the\r\nfalling sensation. This sensation tries to force its way into the\r\nconsciousness and in this process does not completely wake\r\nconsciousness up, but brings about an association of ideas connected\r\nwith falling--hence the dream of being on a height and of falling\r\ntherefrom out of which we wake so startled. The whole process instead\r\nof being injurious is really conservative. It is important that the\r\naorta should not be pressed upon and this is the mode by which\r\nawakening is brought about and the position shifted so that further\r\ninterference is stopped, though we ourselves are quite unconscious of\r\nthe real purpose that has been accomplished. An explanation of this\r\nkind usually makes people who suffer from such dreams and have been\r\ndisturbed by them much more tolerant of the phenomenon and more ready\r\nto go to sleep again, since evidently nature can be trusted to care\r\nfor them even during sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter the sensation of falling probably the commonest dream that\r\nhumanity has, at least in the civilized state, is that of being out in\r\nsome public place without sufficient clothing. Usually we wake just to\r\nfind that some portion of our anatomy has been exposed to the air and\r\nthat it is cold. It is this sensation gradually forcing its way into\r\nconsciousness that has gathered around it a group of ideas that form\r\nour dream.\r\n\r\nAmong men, a familiar dream is that of running for a car, or away from\r\nsomething, or to catch someone, and finding that it is almost\r\nimpossible to move. We are so out of breath that we are scarcely able\r\nto drag one foot after another and, indeed, sometimes we seem to be\r\nactually rooted to the spot. We cannot move at all. When we wake after\r\nthis dream we find that, because of a cold in the head, our nose is\r\nstopped up by the secretion and that our mouths are shut and\r\nconsequently we were getting no air. When that sensation tries to\r\nbreak into the consciousness there gather around it certain familiar\r\nideas usually associated with being out of breath and hence we have\r\nthe dream of trying to run without being able to move.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequency of Dreams.--Nervous people often complain that they dream\r\nall night or else very frequently, and that as a consequence their\r\nsleep is not restful. It is probable that there are always ideas in\r\nthe mind and that literally we dream without ceasing. These ideas,\r\nhowever, do not get into our consciousness except just during the\r\nprocess of waking. All those who have investigated the subject of\r\ndreams are practically agreed on this. In subsequent paragraphs we\r\nquote a number of good observers on this subject. Certainly this is\r\nwhat we should expect from what we all know about day-dreaming. We can\r\nnever catch ourselves during the day without finding some thought\r\nwandering through our minds. If we want to understand dreaming during\r\nsleep this day dreaming is instructive. We jump from one idea to\r\nanother, apparently without a connection; yet there is always some\r\nconnecting link. We have just read in the paper of someone in Cairo,\r\nand we think of old Egypt, and then of old Babylonia, and the Code of\r\nHammurrabi, and the laws of the Medes and the Persians, and Xenophon\r\nand our school days, and of an old schoolmaster now a missionary in\r\nJapan, and of Japanese art and of an American artist much influenced\r\nby it, and of one of his great windows in a church in New York and of\r\nsocial work in connection with that church, {672} and of settlement\r\nhouses and then Hull House, Chicago, and then of the Adamses in\r\nMassachusetts, and so on.\r\n\r\nThus, also, do our minds go flitting round apparently during the\r\nnight. We remember only such things as are brought into our\r\nconsciousness directly and emphatically during the process of\r\nwakening. During our day dreaming we recall only those things which\r\nfor some reason led us to think consciously about them and then follow\r\nout our thoughts to definite conclusions. It is an interesting study\r\nto follow back our day dreams through their wanderings to the origin.\r\nAs a rule, however, we lose track of the connections and after a time\r\nremember only some of the wonderful transformations and\r\ntransmigrations of thought; and so it is in our dreams.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the frequency of dreaming. Sir Arthur Mitchell in his\r\nbook \"Dreaming, Laughing, and Blushing\" (London, 1905), insists on the\r\ngreat probability of the constancy of our dreaming during sleep. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  It seems to me that there is no such thing as dreamless sleep.\r\n  During the whole continuance of sleep, the mind, I believe, is\r\n  occupied with a certain kind of thinking which works round what I\r\n  have called hallucinations. I do not expect to be able to prove the\r\n  correctness of this opinion as to the persistence of dreams all\r\n  through sleep, but I think that it can easily be shown to be\r\n  possibly correct. I go further, and say that many things show that\r\n  it is probably correct. I may not be able to prove absolutely its\r\n  correctness, but it is proper to bear in mind that it is quite as\r\n  difficult to prove absolutely that it is not correct. My difficulty\r\n  is frankly avowed. Many things, however, are taught in biology as\r\n  being certainly true. In regard to which a like avowal could be made\r\n  but is not made. There is what has been called a \"conjectural\r\n  biology.\"\r\n\r\n  We do not and we cannot remember much of what we have been thinking\r\n  about while we are awake. This is unquestionably true in a large\r\n  sense. But, nevertheless, we do not doubt that we have been thinking\r\n  continuously. We do not suppose that at any time all thinking had\r\n  ceased, though we may be completely unable to recall what it was\r\n  about.\r\n\r\nHe shows further that many writers on dreams and careful students of\r\nthe subject in the past have come to the same conclusion. Robert Dale\r\nOwen, for instance, deliberately endeavored to find out whether he had\r\nalways been dreaming just before he awoke. After months of observation\r\nhe records that in every instance he was conscious of having dreamed.\r\nHazlitt, a century ago, tried the same thing for a prolonged period\r\nand notes that whenever he was waked, and immediately recollected\r\nhimself as to possible dreaming, he was always aware that he had been\r\ndreaming. Sir Arthur Mitchell himself has tried this same experiment\r\non himself and for a considerable time has scarcely ever failed to put\r\nto himself this question about dreaming when he awoke and always got a\r\nsatisfying affirmative answer. Personally, for several years, I have\r\nbeen interested enough in this subject to recur frequently to it\r\nimmediately on awaking and I cannot say that I have ever, under those\r\ncircumstances, failed to find that there had been some vague dream\r\nfancies at least running through my mind before I was fully awake.\r\nThis opinion as to the constancy of dreaming during sleep has many\r\nauthorities in its support. Sir Arthur Mitchell has quoted a number,\r\nsome of them distinguished physicians, who add the weight of their\r\ntestimony to this view:\r\n\r\n  It is not a new thing to hold that there is no sleep without\r\n  dreaming--in other words, that dreaming goes on unceasingly all\r\n  through sleep. I have stated my own {673} opinion strongly, but the\r\n  same opinion has been nearly as strongly expressed by others. Sir\r\n  Benjamin Brodie, for instance, may be said to express it when he\r\n  writes, \"I believe that I seldom if ever sleep without dreaming.\"\r\n  Sir Henry Holland expresses it still more plainly when he says: \"No\r\n  moment of sleep is without some condition of dreaming.\" Goodwin says\r\n  much the same thing when he asserts that \"sleep is not a suspension\r\n  of thought\"--in other words, that dreaming is sleep-thinking. Dr.\r\n  John Reid still more clearly holds the opinion, though he does not\r\n  furnish me with a short apt quotation. Hazlitt, too, may be taken as\r\n  holding that there is no such thing as dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n Descartes and his followers may, perhaps, be regarded as holding that\r\n the mind is unceasingly at work in sleep--even in the \"profoundest\r\n sleep,\" though \"the memory retains it not,\" and Isaac Watts says that\r\n \"the soul never intermits its activity,\" and that we may \"know of\r\n sleeping thoughts at the moment they arise, and not retain them the\r\n next moment.\"\r\n\r\n  Hippocrates, Leibnitz, and Abercrombie have also been quoted as\r\n  holding that there is no dreamless sleep, and so far as they express\r\n  themselves on the subject they appear to do so.\r\n\r\nA strong weight of opinion in all ages favors the view that during\r\nsleep dream-thoughts are constantly running through our mind, though\r\nwe recollect only those which are impressed upon us at the moment of\r\nawaking. We do not even recall those unless, for some reason, we have\r\npaid special attention to them. That is just exactly what is true of\r\nday dreaming. After it is over we have no idea at all of the thoughts\r\nthat occupied our minds for hours, though we are all aware that at any\r\ngiven moment, if we turned our consciousness inwards we found that\r\nthere was something that we were thinking about.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort Duration of Dreams.--This view of the constant occurrence of\r\ndreams during sleep is confirmed by other things that we have come to\r\nknow as to dreams and dream states. Probably the most interesting of\r\nthese is with regard to the length of dreams. As our memory of dreams\r\nis only such as we have from the thoughts of sleep getting into our\r\nconsciousness just at the moment of awaking, dreams are never as long\r\nas they sometimes seem to be. As a matter of fact, they occupy but a\r\nfew moments, though in that time a long story may seem to unroll\r\nitself. Probably nothing gives more assurance to people who are\r\npersuaded that they are losing much rest because of their dreams than\r\nthis explanation of the brevity of the phenomena. Nervous people wake\r\nfrequently. Whenever they wake they find themselves dreaming. As a\r\nconsequence, they acquire the persuasion that they have been dreaming\r\n\"all the night long,\" and it is not hard for them to suggest to\r\nthemselves in the early morning that they are not rested. Nervous\r\npeople seldom feel rested in the early morning, it is their worst\r\ntime, and with the occurrence of dreams as a suggested reason for\r\nthis, they exaggerate the feeling of tiredness with which they get up.\r\nA frank discussion of this question of the duration of dreams is often\r\nthe best possible therapeutic auxiliary for such cases. It gives them\r\na new series of suggestions and, above all, relieves them of\r\nunfavorable suggestions.\r\n\r\nProf. Maury of the University of Paris tells a striking story of a\r\nvery brief dream of his own which shows how short may be the time\r\noccupied by what seems surely a long dream. He had been reading before\r\ngoing to bed a very striking book on the Reign of Terror. He dreamt\r\nthat he himself was arrested during the Terror, taken to prison, that\r\nhis name was called on the list of the condemned, that he was carried\r\nto the guillotine, fastened to the {674} board, pushed beneath the\r\nknife and that he woke just as the knife struck his neck. Of course he\r\nawoke with the usual sense of thankfulness and relief that comes at\r\nsuch times. When he awoke he found that a light curtain rod had fallen\r\nfrom the bed above him and had struck just across his neck. His dream\r\nevidently had all come to him during the extremely short time\r\nnecessary for him to become fully awake after the rod had hit him. His\r\nmind was occupying itself with the history that he had read before\r\ngoing to bed. When the rod struck him the long story of his arrest and\r\nimprisonment, the journey to the place of the guillotine and the\r\npreparations for execution, all came to him as a series of rapid ideas\r\nduring his coming to consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that most of our dreams are not much longer than this.\r\nOne of my earliest recollections is of an old gentleman coming into\r\nthe country school during my first year as a pupil and telling us the\r\nstory of a dream of his of the night before quite as brief as that of\r\nProfessor Maury. He had fallen asleep after dinner in his chair and,\r\nhaving a cold that stopped up his nose and his mouth being shut, he\r\nhad the usual dream of being out of breath from running. It took him\r\nback to the story of the massacre of Wyoming, near the scene of which\r\nthe school was situated. He dreamt that for hours he had been running\r\naway from the Indians and seemed at last utterly unable to escape them\r\nbecause he was out of breath. He made such efforts in his chair that\r\nhis wife awakened him and then he found that he had been asleep\r\naltogether only a very few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignificance of Dreams.--Many people are quite sure that their dreams\r\nhave a definite significance quite apart from any mere wandering of\r\nthe mind or the suggestion of half-waking and the ideas that gather\r\nround sensations not fully in the consciousness. A number of people,\r\nfor instance, have dreams of events that are happening at a distance\r\nat the moment that they dream. The Psychic Research Society of England\r\nhas gathered a number of these and it is indeed difficult to\r\nunderstand many of them. There seems no doubt, however, that in many\r\ncases there is an illusion of memory, by which, after an event, dreams\r\nthat might be taken to refer in some vague way to the happening, are\r\nclothed with a wealth of detail which appears to make them wonderful\r\npremonitory representations of future events or repetitions of\r\nsimultaneous events. One of the most familiar of this form of dreams\r\nis what has been called a phantasm of the dying. People dying at a\r\ndistance seem to have some wonderful power of making themselves appear\r\nto very near friends, especially brothers and sisters, and, above all,\r\ntwins, and to friends with whom they have been very intimately\r\nassociated. Occasionally such phantasms are seen during waking hours,\r\nor what are supposed to be waking hours, though it must not be\r\nforgotten that dreams may come very easily and almost unconsciously in\r\nshort naps, but much more frequently in what are known to be dreams.\r\n\r\nNearly always these partake of the nature of the ordinary dream, as\r\ncan be seen by a careful analysis of their conditions, and are mere\r\ncoincidences occupying a very brief space of time. A typical example\r\nof this is to be found in one of the stories told by Camille\r\nFlammarion, the French astronomer, in his book \"The Unknown.\" A young\r\nman who had fallen in love with a young woman was deeply grieved to be\r\nparted from her by the injunction of parents. Separated by a long\r\ndistance, they kept up a clandestine {675} correspondence for more\r\nthan a year. For a considerable period, however, he had not heard from\r\nher, and he was beginning to be anxious lest anything had happened to\r\nher. One night she appeared to him in a dream in his room in white\r\ngarments with a pale face and, placing her cold hand in his, she bade\r\nhim good-bye. He awoke with a start. He found it difficult to sleep\r\nand was very anxious about her. The next day he learned that she had\r\ndied the night before and concluded that his dream was a last message\r\nfrom her. The end of the story, however, as it is told, spoils this\r\nnice sentimental conclusion. When he awoke he found he had in his hand\r\na glass of ice water which had been standing on the table beside him.\r\nThe grasping of this had awakened him. During the awakening process\r\nthe thoughts of her in his mind gathered round the cold sensation in\r\nhis hand and gave him the dream of her and the last farewell.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances in which dreams of future events seem to come\r\ntrue. Indeed, so many of these stories have been told that it is hard\r\nto persuade some people that dreams have no meaning and can have no\r\nmeaning. By this we mean that they can by no possibility represent\r\nprophetic foresight. What patients need to be made to understand is\r\nthat dreams represent only straggling sensations trying to get into\r\nour consciousness, just barely succeeding, and then arousing trains of\r\nideas unconnected in themselves, but which we connect afterwards when\r\nwe recollect our dreams. This whole subject has been studied so\r\nthoroughly in Maury's work on _\"Le Sommeil et les Reves\"_ about the\r\nmiddle of the last century and Freud _\"Ueber den Traum\"_ and Sante de\r\nSanctis' _\"I Sogni\"_ Turin, 1899, at the end of the century, that\r\nthere can be no further doubts about the matter for those who are open\r\nto conviction. Most people, however, want to believe that their dreams\r\nmean something. They like to think that they are in some way picked\r\nout from the multitude and that their dreaming has a significance more\r\nthan is accorded to other people. It is, indeed, this\r\nself-centeredness that makes for the belief in premonitions and\r\nprophetic dreams and, as in all cases, these feelings work out their\r\nown revenge.\r\n\r\nIf they will listen to reason, however, most people may be rather\r\nreadily convinced that their dreams cannot have any serious\r\nsignificance. In the chapter on Premonitions we have already called\r\nattention to the situation that exists with regard to the possibility\r\nof future events giving information of themselves in advance of their\r\nhappening. Simultaneous events may perhaps in some way give warnings.\r\nThe possibility of action on the mind at a distance, especially where\r\nminds are involved, has been discussed and admitted. The cases in\r\nwhich it is supposed to have happened are, to my mind, all dubious and\r\nare mere coincidences. For future events, however, there is no\r\npossible physical explanation. When we turn to explanations in the\r\nborderland between spirit and matter we find nothing satisfactory. The\r\nfuture event exists nowhere. No spirit even knows it; it is dependent\r\non human free will. To the Creator it is known only as a contingent\r\npossibility dependent on free will. The information does not come from\r\nHim, for then there would be more design in these incidents. Such\r\ndreams would effect some serious purpose, while usually they have but\r\nminor significance in the stories as told and they often concern only\r\nthe most trivial things.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus true of premonitions can readily be applied to dreams.\r\n{676} There is no reasonable source of information with regard to\r\nfuture events. What, then, are we to say of the dreams that come true?\r\nThere is no doubt that dreaming is extremely common. Probably, as was\r\nsaid, we never sleep without dreams. There are a billion dreams at\r\nleast, probably many billions of dreams every night, then, in this\r\nlittle world of ours. When these are startling they cling to us. It\r\nwould be surprising if some of them did not come true. Indeed, it is\r\ninevitable, according to the theory of probabilities, that some of\r\nthem will connect themselves directly with future events. We have a\r\nfew thousands of such startling coincidences in the history of the\r\nrace. Out of these have been made all the data supposed to underlie\r\nthe teaching that dreams have a prophetic significance. It is much\r\neasier to understand with regard to dreams than even with regard to\r\ntelepathy coincidence explains all the supposedly wonderful warnings\r\nof events that actually happen after we have had apparently\r\npremonitory dreams.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of a premonition that did not come true, the\r\nsubject of which was sure that it was a waking premonition and not a\r\ndream, though it seems more likely that it was as suggested by the\r\nnarrator a sleep vision, is told by Sir Arthur Mitchell in his\r\n\"Dreaming, Laughing, Blushing\" (London, 1905). A number of scientists\r\nwho discussed the story declared that if it had only come true it\r\nwould have been one of the most startling manifestations of\r\npremonition and of the clairvoyant power of dreams, or at least of\r\ntheir telepathic significance, that we have ever had. It involved so\r\nmany distinguished scientists that there could have been no doubt\r\nabout it. It was so detailed and those details were known to so many\r\nauthorities in science, that it would have carried great weight and it\r\nwould have been extremely difficult to have people accept it as a\r\nmere coincidence. It is easy to see now after the event that, if it\r\nhad been fulfilled, it would have been, in spite of its startlingness,\r\na mere coincidence. Since it was not fulfilled, however, it represents\r\none of the best evidences that we have for the insignificance of\r\npremonitory or telepathic dreams.\r\n\r\n  Sir William T. Gairdner, K. C. B., whose interesting typhus delirium\r\n  experience appears in the paper by Professor Coates on \"Sleep,\r\n  Dreams and Delirium\" (_Glas. Med. Jour.,_ Vol. xxxviii, 1892, pp.\r\n  241-261), has written to me about his dreams generally, and he\r\n  concludes his letter with the narrative of a dream, which, as he\r\n  correctly says, \"if it had only fulfilled itself, might have become\r\n  famous.\" He prefaces the narrative by this statement: \"In all my\r\n  individual experience, now extending over more than the usual term\r\n  of life, I have never met with anything suggestive in the remotest\r\n  degree of telepathy or second sight, or of dream prophecies or any\r\n  other fact bearing on the marvellous.\" He then goes on to tell the\r\n  dream to which I have referred. \"In crossing the Atlantic In 1891,\"\r\n  he says, \"in delightful weather and perfect bodily health, and\r\n  without a shade of anxiety on my mind so far as I was aware (in\r\n  waking consciousness), I was suddenly aroused in the very early\r\n  morning, say, three or four a. m., out of a perfectly sound, and, as\r\n  I should call it, dreamless sleep, by the apparition of a telegram\r\n  written on the usual paper, and presumably from home, in these\r\n  words: 'Miss Dorothea died at ----,' all the rest being blurred and\r\n  indistinct, but these words having a startling distinctness and a\r\n  vivid sense of reality. I was not, I think, in the least degree\r\n  alarmed at first, and certainly had no superstition about it on\r\n  discovering that it was only a dream; but, failing to get any more\r\n  sleep, I rose early, took my bath as usual, and went on deck, where\r\n  I had to repeat the story of my dream to each one of some three or\r\n  four companions who were on board, of whom I will only mention Sir.\r\n  John Batty Tuke, Professor Young of Owens College, and Professor\r\n  {677} Cunningham, then of Trinity College, Dublin. Any of these\r\n  gentlemen will confirm my saying that I attached no special\r\n  importance to this dream in the way of a scare or a superstition,\r\n  but in this way it got abroad to a certain extent within a small\r\n  circle on board in such a way as would have ensured it a widespread\r\n  fame had it only come true. In discussing the matter at breakfast I\r\n  remarked (alluding to telepathy) that the telegram was clearly,\r\n  judging from its terms, not from my wife or any member of my\r\n  immediate family, and could only have been despatched by a servant\r\n  or some one with whom I could not be supposed to be in telepathic\r\n  rapport. From this point of view it clearly refuted itself, and yet\r\n  the effect upon my mind was such that, upon arriving at New York, I\r\n  at once despatched a telegram announcing my arrival and making\r\n  inquiry, the reply to which showed that the family were pursuing a\r\n  quite undisturbed course at St. Andrews.\"\r\n\r\n  Sir William describes himself as aroused out of sound sleep by the\r\n  apparition of a telegram, but I think this only means that he became\r\n  suddenly awake on seeing the telegram during sleep. He does not say\r\n  whether he knew in his dream that he was a passenger on a great ship\r\n  on the mid-ocean, but he says that the telegram was written on the\r\n  usual paper by which I take it that he means the paper used here on\r\n  shore.\r\n\r\n  If it happened that the death of Miss Dorothea took place about the\r\n  time of the appearance of the telegram to so distinguished a man as\r\n  Sir William in his sleep, I scarcely think there would be any more\r\n  startling record of a so-called telepathic message. But most happily\r\n  the death did not take place, so that the story of the dream will be\r\n  forgotten. Tens of thousands of similar dream stories have that\r\n  fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Dreams.--There is an old tradition that to tell our dreams\r\ncauses them to come back, or at least to recur in some other form.\r\nThis tradition is so old and so universal that probably there is more\r\nin it than might at first be thought. This emphasizing of certain\r\nforms of unconscious cerebration probably encourages their repetition,\r\nor, at least, the repetition of further processes of the same kind.\r\nThere seems to be no doubt, too, that the reading of certain kinds of\r\nimaginative writing and the looking at exciting pictures sometimes\r\nleads to dreams about them. Certainly children should not be told\r\nterrifying stories and the more nervous they are and the more affected\r\nthey are by such stories, which to some people make renewed\r\ntemptations to tell them, the more should they be avoided.\r\n\r\nAny physician who has had much experience with city children,\r\nespecially in New York City, is likely to know how exciting, tragic\r\nand, above all, melodramatic scenes serve as the basis for disturbing\r\ndreams and night terrors. They will not, of course, in vigorous,\r\nhealthy and strong-minded children, but these are the ones who are\r\nmost prone to play out of doors and so are likely to be less bothered.\r\nJust the nervous, old-fashioned, delicate children who prefer the\r\ntheater to sports of other kinds, are likely to be most affected in\r\nthis unfortunate way. The scenes become so real to children that they\r\nimpress them very deeply and are readily rehearsed in the unconscious\r\ncerebration of sleep. Many a child sees in its dreams someone, often a\r\nnear relative, fastened on the carriage of a sawmill and inevitably\r\napproaching a buzz-saw, or fastened inextricably to the rails while an\r\nexpress train thunders down on them. That they should wake up with a\r\nstart and a scream of terror and lose most of their night's sleep and\r\ndisturb that of others, is not surprising. It is well known how\r\nwitnessing actual danger, as of an automobile accident, or a railroad\r\nwreck, disturbs a child's imagination for long after; and its theater\r\nexperiences are almost as actual as the reality.\r\n\r\n{678}\r\n\r\nMany of the colored supplements of Sunday newspapers seem to be\r\nparticularly undesirable literature for children in this respect,\r\nthough, of course, there are many other reasons why children should\r\nnot be encouraged to look at them. It is not unusual for the\r\nnewspapers to give lurid pictures of wonderful dreams or things that\r\nhappen in dreams. This is undoubtedly a suggestion that acts in\r\ncausing nearly all children, but especially those of nervous\r\norganization, to dream much more than would ordinarily be the case. It\r\nrecalls the old warning about telling dreams. These sets of pictures\r\ncertainly serve to develop the imagination of the child along\r\nundesirable lines. Possibly some of them which emphasize the fact that\r\nafter eating certain very undesirable foods, dreams are much more\r\nlikely to come than at other times may not be without their\r\nprophylactic sanitary value, but this is a doubtful advantage compared\r\nto the psychic harm that they bring. I am not of those who would limit\r\nthe fairy stories and other pleasant essays in imagination which\r\ndelight children so much and form a desirable part of their education,\r\nbut artistic effort that is terrifying or deterrent, whether with pen\r\nor brush, should be kept away from them until after their mental\r\ncontrol is well established. Children will probably dream anyhow, and,\r\ntherefore, should have a pleasant fund of imaginative material as a\r\nbasis for their dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDISORDERS OF MEMORY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany patients suffering from various nervous symptoms insist that they\r\nare losing their memory or that it is becoming notably deficient in\r\nsome ways. If they are a little on in years they are sure that their\r\nmemory is not as good as it used to be and that they now forget many\r\nthings that were formerly remembered without difficulty. Especially\r\nare they likely to assert that the names of people and certain words\r\nwill not come to them when they want them, that they often have to\r\nseek for facts and dates that should be quite familiar, that they fail\r\nto remember acquaintances and the like. These symptoms of which they\r\ncomplain are often sources of considerable worry and serve to\r\nemphasize in them the idea that there is something serious the matter\r\nwith their general health, or some pathological condition developing\r\nin their brain. They have heard much of loss of memory as a sign of\r\ndegenerative nervous diseases and they are prone to think that their\r\nown special loss of memory, be it real or imaginary, must be a\r\nforerunner, or perhaps even an early symptom, of some important\r\norganic lesion.\r\n\r\nThis idea of progressive memory disturbance as a preliminary of\r\nnervous breakdown often becomes so firmly fixed as to be of itself a\r\nprofound source of anxiety to patients, and an almost unspeakable\r\ndread. So it is important to make them understand what the real nature\r\nof their condition is and what their loss of memory, supposed or real,\r\nis due to. As a matter of fact, what many of these patients need is\r\nnot treatment for a diseased memory, but reassurance from what we know\r\nabout the psychology of memory, that their troubles are only quite\r\nnatural incidents in the life history of their particular memory {679}\r\nfaculty. Many a man who is worrying about his supposed loss of memory\r\nor, at least, impairment of it in some way, is not suffering from a\r\ntrue pathological condition, but is usually the victim only of some\r\nfunctional disturbance of the nervous system with the neurotic anxiety\r\nand heightened introspection that accompanies such a condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons for Memory Difficulties.--Nervous patients particularly\r\ncomplain that they do not remember what they wish to as easily as they\r\nused to a few years before. They say that it is much more difficult\r\nfor them to impress things upon their memories and, in addition, that\r\nit is much easier for them to forget. There are three quite natural\r\nreasons for these phenomena as far as they actually exist, which\r\nshould be pointed out to these patients. The first and most important\r\nis that they are incapable of that concentration of mind which they\r\nhad in earlier years and which enabled them to give themselves up so\r\ncompletely to the consideration of a particular subject that it could\r\nnot help but be impressed on their minds. They are now so much\r\noccupied with many other things, and, above all, most of these\r\npatients are so preoccupied with themselves that they cannot hope to\r\nhave the concentration of mind that was comparatively easy when they\r\nwere younger and is now impaired, but which is so necessary for the\r\nenduring remembrance of things. Secondly, their over-anxiety to\r\nremember things sometimes acts as an inhibitory motive in securing\r\nthat deep, impression that will enable them to remember details very\r\nwell. Thirdly, their supposed impairment of memory is due to a false\r\njudgment with regard to themselves. They are not comparing their power\r\nof memory now with what they used to have, but owing to anxiety about\r\nthemselves they have taken to comparing themselves with others and,\r\nafter all, the faculty of memory acts very differently for different\r\npeople and it is well known that what one man remembers with ease\r\nanother recalls with difficulty, or only because of special attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attention and Memory_.--The first of these causes for supposed\r\nimpairment deserves to be discussed further. It is often said that as\r\nwe grow older our memory is not so retentive as it used to be, and\r\nthat while we remember the events of boyhood and the things we learned\r\nin the early years of school life, our recollection of recent events\r\nand things learned in later years is much less vivid. This is all very\r\ntrue, but the reason usually given, that in the meantime our memories\r\nhave failed in power is inconclusive. What we learned in early\r\nchildhood came to us with the surprise of novelty and for this reason\r\nwe paid close attention, it was new and impressed us with its\r\nimportance, it was dwelt upon for long periods and often, because\r\nthere was little else to think about, has been frequently recalled\r\nsince and, of course, is indelibly impressed upon our memories. The\r\nsame thing is true with regard to early acquaintances. We got to know\r\nthem so well that, of course, we cannot forget them. What we have\r\nlearned in later life, however, has come in the midst of many other\r\nthings, has not been dwelt on very long, has not been often recalled\r\nand, of course, occupies much less place in the memory than the things\r\nof earlier life. That is not, however, because of any defect in\r\nmemory, but because of lack of attention and repetition that means so\r\nmuch for memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Age and Memory_.--It is often said that people do not learn so\r\nreadily when they get older. This is, of course, a truth of common\r\nexperience, but {680} it is not because of dullness of the faculty of\r\nmemory, but failure to concentrate the attention sufficiently for\r\nmemorizing. I have known old men who could learn things just as well\r\nas any young man and indeed better than most of them. They were men\r\nwho had been accustomed all their lives to concentrate attention on\r\nthe subject they had in hand and who did not allow the cares and\r\nworries of life to intrude on their studies. Cato learning Greek at\r\neighty is often quoted as an exceptional example, but I have had some\r\ndear old friends who could learn things quite as readily as younger\r\nmen and whose minds were just as bright and clear. Whenever they\r\ndevoted as much attention to anything that they wanted to remember as\r\nthey did when they were younger men, I am sure that they remembered\r\nquite as well. It is a question of attention and not of any loss of\r\nfaculty that makes the difference between the memory of the young and\r\nthe old until, of course, senile impairment actually comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Solicitude and Memory_.--Everyone who has had to depend much on his\r\nmemory knows that over-anxiety with regard to the recollection of\r\nanything may seriously inhibit the power to recall it. Public speakers\r\nknow that to hesitate is to be lost. If they want a particular name or\r\nword which they know often escapes them, they must with confidence\r\nbegin the sentence in which it is to occur, though perhaps wondering\r\nall the time whether the word will be on hand or not for them to use\r\nit. Occasionally it will not come, but as a rule it turns up just in\r\ntime. If they allow themselves to be disturbed by the thought that the\r\nword or expression may not come, then they know the hopeless vacant\r\nblank that stares them in the face when they want it. They have to\r\nmake a circumlocution in the hope that it may turn up. Some let it go\r\nat that, but many start another sentence in the hope to tempt it to\r\ncome and often it will eventually come, but sometimes it persistently\r\nrefuses to come. That is not a loss of memory but a failure of neuron\r\nconnections. There are some of us who know that certain words will\r\nalways do that with us. Archimedes has bothered me for years and his\r\nname will often not come when I want it. Then there are certain words\r\nwith regard to which transposition is likely to take place. We\r\ninvoluntarily and unconsciously substitute one word for another. We\r\ncall one man by another's name. We have done it before and we know\r\nthat we are likely to do it again. Somehow the connections in memory\r\nexist along these wrong lines and are constantly mismade. The name of\r\nsomething a man has written comes up instead of his name. This\r\nheterophemia is often noted in men of excellent memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeculiarities of Memory.--Memory is an illusive and elusive function\r\nat best. All of us have had the sensation of having a word, and\r\nparticularly a name, on the tip of our tongues. We often know the\r\nfirst letter and sometimes the first syllable of it. What memory\r\nbrings to us, however, may not always be the first syllable of a word\r\nor name, though we are prone to think it must be, and we may go\r\nlooking for it in the dictionary of names only to discover after a\r\ntime that we are many letters away from its beginning. Very often we\r\nhave to give up seeking in sheer inability to get a hint of it and\r\nthen of itself it will come a little later. Sometimes it will come\r\nwhen we no longer want it. As a rule, words that have escaped us once\r\nin this way are prone to do so again. Over and over again the\r\nexperience will be that {681} a particular word or group of words\r\nescapes our memory, or at least fails to be at our command, as most\r\nother things are. Those of us who are not much given to introspection\r\ntake no notice of these difficulties which are common-place\r\nexperiences enough, but the man or the woman who is looking for\r\nsymptoms, who is prone to believe for some reason or other that his or\r\nher memory is failing, will take these hints of the more or less\r\nnatural fallacy of memory as confirmations, strong as direct proof of\r\nthe fact that memory is seriously deteriorating.\r\n\r\nSuch pauses and lapses of memory are much more likely to occur if we\r\nare nervous and over-anxious about possible loss of memory. I was once\r\nasked to attend for a few hours before the time fixed for his oration\r\none of the greatest orators of this country, who was about to talk at\r\na university commencement. What surprised me was that this practiced\r\nspeaker, who had often appeared before very large audiences, took a\r\nvery light meal in considerable trepidation, immediately after asked\r\nto have certain books brought to him and certain facts looked up for\r\nhim, took notes in a hurried, feverish way and generally displayed all\r\nthe over-excitement of the schoolboy about to make his first oration.\r\nHe was a magnificent occasional speaker, often called upon, yet he\r\nassured me that it was always thus with him and that the reason for it\r\nwas that in spite of previous preparation--and the finish of his\r\norations made it clear that he had devoted much thought to them\r\nbeforehand--certain of his facts and names and dates had the habit of\r\nslipping from him in the midst of the development of his theme, unless\r\nhe had refreshed his memory with regard to them immediately before,\r\nand that he feared that sometime he would find himself in the midst of\r\nan address with an absolute blank before him and that he would be\r\ncompelled to sit down in disgrace. He had never done so and never did\r\nin the many years that he, lived afterwards, though always with this\r\ndread, never trusting his memory as most people do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Name Memory_.--There are certain circumstances in which memory may\r\nfail and yet no significance of a pathological nature can be\r\nattributed to the fact. All of us probably have had the disturbing\r\nexperience of undertaking to introduce two friends whom we had known\r\nfor many years and yet having to ask at least one of them for his name\r\nbefore we could make the introduction. It is not that we did not know\r\nthe name, but at the moment we were utterly unable to recall it. After\r\nthis has happened once or twice it is prone to happen again, because\r\nwhen we set about introducing people the thought of the previous\r\nunfortunate occurrences of this kind comes to our mind and acts as an\r\ninhibition of memory, making it impossible for us to recall names. Not\r\ninfrequently if we are brought to the pass of having to ask one of the\r\nparties for his name we have to ask the other, though it was on the\r\ntip of our tongue a moment before, because in the meantime the\r\ndisturbance of mind incident to having to ask has interfered with the\r\ntrain of recollection. Men have been known to forget their own names\r\nunder circumstances of great excitement and such a forgetting is not\r\npathological, but only a physiological disturbance of function because\r\nof secondary trains of association set to work in the brain which\r\ndisturb ordinary recollection. Of course, some people have an\r\nexcellent memory for names and never have such experiences, but they\r\nare very rare, though practice in recalling names does much to keep\r\n{682} people from such embarrassing situations. On the other hand,\r\nthere are some people especially gifted with name memories. Napoleon\r\ncould recall all his soldiers' names.\r\n\r\n\r\nFatigue and Memory.--Occasionally it happens quite normally that when\r\nwe are very tired certain portions of our memory at least become vague\r\nand indefinite and may even fail to respond to any excitation on our\r\npart. Under these circumstances we seem to be able only with\r\nconsiderable effort to exert the effort necessary to bring about such\r\nconnections of brain cells as will facilitate recollection and\r\nreproduction and we may fail entirely. In a foreign country it is, as\r\na rule, much more easy to talk the language in the morning when we are\r\nfresh than in the evening when we are tired. Especially is this true\r\nif we are asked to pass from one foreign language to another, which\r\nalways requires a special effort. Everyone who has traveled must have\r\nhad the experience that on crossing the frontier suddenly to be\r\naddressed in German after he has been talking French for weeks, may\r\nquite nonplus the traveler, even though he knows German as well or\r\neven better than French. This is especially true if much depends on\r\nthe answers, if he has been addressed by a railway official or customs\r\ninspector. Apparently there must be a momentary wait until some\r\nshifting operation takes place in the brain before the German memory\r\ncan get to work to establish the connections necessary to enable him\r\nto talk German. After a man has been talking to a number of people in\r\none foreign tongue he is likely to be quite lost for words for a\r\nmoment if he has to use another. The effects of fatigue and excitement\r\nand unusualness upon memory then must be remembered in order to be\r\nable to reassure patients who pervert the significance of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nRibot gives an excellent personal illustration of this peculiarity of\r\nmemory in his \"Diseases of Memory,\" which is worth recalling here. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  I descended on the same day two very deep mines In the Hartz\r\n  Mountains, remaining some hours underground in each. While in the\r\n  second mine, and exhausted both from fatigue and inanition, I felt\r\n  the utter impossibility of talking longer with the German inspector\r\n  who accompanied me. Every German word and phrase deserted my\r\n  recollection; and it was not until I had taken food and wine, and\r\n  been some time at rest, that I regained them again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSensations and Memory.--Just as soon as people compare their memories\r\nwith others, as they do when they worry and begin to grow\r\nintrospectively self-conscious, they find noteworthy differences and\r\nbecause of differences they will be prone to think that their memory\r\nis pathologically defective when it is only different, or, still more,\r\nthat because they are not able to remember some things, as others do,\r\ntheir memory must be failing. It is well known that some people have a\r\ngood memory for things seen, others for things heard, and still others\r\nonly for things in which they have taken actual part. These are spoken\r\nof as visual, auditory and action memories. Memories for things seen\r\nare divided into special classes. Some people remember forms very\r\nwell, while others remember colors. It is evident that our memories\r\nare somehow dependent on the special mode in which sensation affects\r\nus and that our acutest sensations are the sources of our longest and\r\nbest memories. Color vision defectives are not affected much by colors\r\nand easily forget them. The tone-deaf have no memory for tunes. Every\r\nsense defect affects the memory. Sense defects are often unconscious.\r\nTheir effect on memory may {683} only be noted when introspection\r\nbegins to bring out the special sensation and memory qualities of the\r\nindividual. Nature, not disease, may be the basis of some memory\r\ntroubles thus brought to recognition. All these curious phenomena with\r\nregard to memory need to be recalled whenever there is question of a\r\nsupposed deterioration of it, for it is not easy to decide such a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimits of Normal Forgetfulness.--Curious instances of forgetfulness\r\nmay occur in the experience of men with excellent memories, which,\r\nwhen they happen to persons morbidly inclined to test their every act,\r\nare interpreted to signify something much more serious than they\r\nreally mean. Nearly everyone has had more than once the experience of\r\ntelling a story to a particular group of people and then forgetting\r\nall about having told it and coming back a few days later to tell it\r\nover again. Occasionally a teacher hears the same lesson a week apart\r\nand yet does not remember that he went over it before, though the\r\nclass is almost sure to do so. A man may repeat a lecture that he has\r\ngiven before to the same audience without realizing it. The story has\r\nbeen told more than once of a clergyman delivering the same sermon on\r\ntwo Sundays in succession and, though such lapses are very rare, they\r\ndo not necessarily indicate a failing memory, but may only mean a lack\r\nof concentration of attention on the part of the human mind. Prof.\r\nRibot in his \"Diseases of Memory\" tells the story of one such case in\r\nwhich the subject was quite alarmed lest it should indicate that he\r\nwas beginning to suffer from some serious memory disturbance due to\r\nbrain disease, though there was no ground for his fears:\r\n\r\n  A dissenting minister, apparently in good health, went through the\r\n  entire pulpit service one Sunday morning with perfect\r\n  consistency--his choice of hymns and lessons and extempore prayer\r\n  being all related to the subject of the sermon. On the Sunday\r\n  following he went through the service in precisely the same manner,\r\n  selecting the same hymns and lessons, offering the same prayer,\r\n  giving out the same text, and preaching the same sermon. On\r\n  descending from the pulpit he had not the slightest remembrance of\r\n  having gone through precisely the same service on the preceding\r\n  Sunday. He was much alarmed and feared an attack of brain disease,\r\n  but nothing of the kind supervened.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention not Memory.--When patients come with complaints of the loss\r\nof memory, the most important thing is to analyze their symptoms\r\ncarefully. This will usually enable us to give patients ample\r\nreassurance. I have known men who were convinced that they were losing\r\ntheir memories because of their failure to recall important details in\r\ntheir business affairs in the midst of much hurry and bustle in the\r\nwinter time, find that when they were living a simpler life in the\r\ncourse of travel or life in the country during the summer time under\r\nconditions different from the ordinary, their memory could be\r\nabsolutely depended on for trains and travel details and all important\r\nmatters to which they were now devoting attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nCultivating Looseness of Memory.--Many people complain of loss of\r\nmemory in the sense that they do not now remember when things took\r\nplace as well as they used to. For instance, I have had men of fifty\r\ntell me that they were sure that their memories were growing weaker\r\nthan they used to be because a number of times within a year they had\r\nfound that events which they thought had taken place only a year or\r\ntwo ago really dated four or {684} five or even more years in the\r\npast. Some are considerably disturbed by this. As a matter of fact it\r\nis only another instance of lack of attention. Most of what we read in\r\nnewspapers attracts so little of our serious attention that it is no\r\nwonder that we do not recall with exactness when events took place.\r\nEvents crowd each other out of memory. Newspaper reading is, indeed,\r\nthe best possible cultivation of looseness of memory that we could\r\nhave. We do not expect to remember what we read. We would probably\r\ngrow distracted if we did. At the end of the day if you ask a man what\r\nhe read in the morning paper he will have no idea at all, unless\r\nsomething especially startling or particularly interesting to him has\r\nturned up. After a week we could no more separate Monday's from\r\nTuesday's news of the week before than we could recall a random list\r\nof events, having heard it but once. We cultivate looseness of memory\r\nwith great assiduity. Let us not be surprised if, to some extent, we\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemories Individual.--People are often much worried over children's\r\nmemories and may communicate this worry and anxiety to the children\r\nthemselves, making them solicitous. It is probable that our memories\r\nare like our stature. They are what they are. By thinking we cannot\r\nadd a cubit to the one nor facility to the other. The training of the\r\nmemory is a very small element compared to the natural faculty. It\r\nmust not be forgotten, however, that many distinguished men have been\r\nnoted for rather bad memories when they were young and yet these\r\nfaculties have developed quite enough to enable them to accomplish\r\ngood work afterwards. The memory is, after all, a comparatively\r\nunimportant faculty in itself and other intellectual faculties surpass\r\nit in significance. It is the faculty that first develops, however,\r\nand so a child is often thought to be intellectually slow when it has\r\nnot so bright a memory as its companions, though a little later its\r\nother faculties may develop so as to put it on a plane above its\r\nfellows. Memories, too, are very individual and may not retain any of\r\nthe ordinary subjects, while they may be very attentive for certain\r\nspecial lines of thought. This form of the faculty is better, for the\r\nencyclopedic memory is usually of little use and, except in high\r\ndegrees, encourages superficiality rather than real knowledge.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, few of our greatest thinkers have had what would\r\nbe called brilliant memories and it would almost seem as though the\r\ndiversion of mental energy to this faculty rather disturbed the\r\ndevelopment of the others. Many a distinguished man has been rather\r\nnotorious as a child for bad memory, so that in the early days when\r\nmemory was the only faculty called upon at school he was set down as a\r\ndunce. Perhaps the most striking example of this was Sir Isaac Newton,\r\nwho was actually called a dunce, and yet the world would welcome a few\r\nother such dunces. Thomas of Aquin, the great medieval writer on\r\nphilosophy and theology, who still influences philosophy so much, was\r\nso slow as a young man that he was called by his fellow pupils \"the\r\ndumb ox.\" His great teacher, Albertus Magnus, recognized the depth of\r\nmind that his fellow students could not see and declared that the\r\nbellowings of that \"ox\" would be heard throughout the world. Sir\r\nWalter Scott was spoken of as a very backward child. This is all the\r\nmore surprising to those who know and appreciate the wealth of\r\ninformation that he put into his Waverley Novels. Goldsmith, than whom\r\nwe have no more brilliant writer in English, seemed not only a dunce\r\nas a child, but all his {685} life, so far as outward appearance went,\r\nwas a numbsknll. This was due to a lack of readiness rather than any\r\nlack of wit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTricks of Memory.--Some tricks of memory may be very disturbing to\r\nthose who are over-occupied with themselves and with the possibility\r\nof losing their memory. For their consolation it is well for the\r\nphysician who hears their complaints to have at hand some stories that\r\nillustrate certain of these curious tricks of memory. I had been\r\ntrying to persuade a literary woman for some time that it was not her\r\nmemory that was playing her false, but merely her habit of attention\r\nand lack of concentration of mind on things because she is occupied\r\nwith a great many interests, when one day she came to me with what she\r\nthought was absolutely convincing proof that her memory was going. She\r\nhad read a passage in a newspaper the day before which she liked very\r\nmuch, but after reflection it sounded strangely like some of the\r\nthings that she had thought along these lines herself. It was a\r\nquotation, but there was no indication to tell whence it came. A\r\nlittle inquiry, however, showed that the quotation was from an article\r\nof her own written only two years before. Here was definite proof of a\r\nfailure of memory. Strange as it may seem, however, this experience is\r\nquite common. I feel sure that there is not a single writer for\r\nperiodical literature who has not had similar experiences. Anyone who\r\nwrites much editorially, where the articles are unsigned, finds it\r\nrather difficult two or three years later, as a rule, to be absolutely\r\nsure which editorials are his. Occasionally it happens that even by\r\nthe time the proof comes back for monthly periodicals, say six weeks\r\nor two months, some at least of what was written may seem quite\r\nunfamiliar. This will be particularly true if phases of the same\r\nsubjects have been treated in successive articles and thus repetitions\r\nare caused.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of good warrant for such occurrences in the lives of\r\ndistinguished writers. Scott once heard a song in a drawing-room that\r\nhe did not care for very much and he said rather contemptuously, \"Oh!\r\nthat's some of Byron's stuff.\" His attention was called to the fact\r\nthat he was the author of the stuff himself. Carlyle confessed to\r\nFroude when Froude went over some of the passages of Carlyle's own\r\nautobiography with him, that he had quite forgotten some of the things\r\nwritten down there. Manzoni, the distinguished Italian writer, whose\r\n\"I Promessi Sposi\" has probably been more read throughout Europe than\r\nany novel written during the nineteenth century, except possibly some\r\nof Scott's, tells some stories of his own lapses of memory and, above\r\nall, of having once quoted a sentence of his own to confirm something\r\nthat he was saying, though he confessed that he did not know by whom\r\nthe quotation had been written.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory and Low Grade Intelligence.--There are many people who complain\r\nof their memory and of their inability to recall many things which\r\nothers recall without difficulty. They are prone to think that this is\r\nsome defect in them and not infrequently, as a consequence of\r\ncomparisons, they persuade themselves that their memory was better and\r\nthat it has lost some of its qualities. Until they became familiar\r\nwith some of the feats of memory possible of performance by others,\r\nthey were quite satisfied, but now they find in every instance of\r\nforgetting a new symptom of an increasingly deficient memory. I have\r\nfound in these cases, that setting before such people some of the\r\ncuriosities of memory, and especially the fact that memory is by no\r\n{686} means necessarily connected with profound intelligence, so that,\r\nindeed, its presence is quite compatible with a low grade of\r\nintelligence or even with what is practically idiocy, will do much to\r\nrob these gloomy forebodings of their terrors with regard to their own\r\nsupposed deterioration of intellect. Ribot, in his \"Diseases of\r\nMemory\"   [Footnote 52] has an excellent passage in which he sums up a\r\nnumber of these peculiarities of memory that are likely to be\r\nespecially consolatory to people of ordinary memory who are worrying\r\nabout themselves.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: International Scientific Series,\r\n    D. Appleton & Co., New York.]\r\n\r\n  It has long been observed that in many idiots and imbeciles the\r\n  senses are very unequally developed; thus, the hearing may be of\r\n  extreme delicacy and precision, while the other senses are blunted.\r\n  The arrest of development is not uniform in all respects. It is not\r\n  surprising, then, that general weakness of memory should co-exist in\r\n  the same subject with evolution and even hypertrophy of a particular\r\n  memory. Thus certain idiots, insensible to all other impressions,\r\n  have an extraordinary taste for music, and are able to retain an air\r\n  which they have once heard. In rare instances there is a memory for\r\n  forms and colors, and an aptitude for drawing. Cases of memory of\r\n  figures, dates, proper names, and words in general, are more common.\r\n  An idiot \"could remember the day when every person in the parish had\r\n  been buried for thirty-five years, and could repeat with unvarying\r\n  accuracy the name and age of the deceased, and the mourners at the\r\n  funeral. Out of the line of burials he had not one idea, could not\r\n  give an intelligible reply to a single question, nor be trusted even\r\n  to feed himself.\" Certain idiots, unable to make the most elementary\r\n  arithmetical calculations, repeat the whole of the multiplication\r\n  table without an error. Others recite, word for word, passages that\r\n  have been read to them, and cannot learn the letters of the\r\n  alphabet. Drobisch reports the following case of which he was an\r\n  observer: A boy of fourteen, almost an idiot, experienced great\r\n  trouble in learning to read. He had, nevertheless, a marvelous\r\n  facility for remembering the order in which words and letters\r\n  succeeded one another. When allowed two or three minutes in which to\r\n  glance over the page of a book printed in a language which he did\r\n  not know, or treating of subjects of which he was ignorant, he\r\n  could, in the brief time mentioned, repeat every word from memory\r\n  exactly as if the book remained open before him. The existence of\r\n  this partial memory is so common that it has been utilized in the\r\n  education of idiots and imbeciles. It is worth noting that idiots\r\n  attacked by mania or some other acute disease frequently display a\r\n  temporary memory. Thus, an idiot in a fit of anger told of a\r\n  complicated incident of which he had been a witness long before, and\r\n  which at the time seemed to have made no impression upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining Memory.--In recent years in many departments of therapeutics\r\ntraining has been found to be of value. This is especially true with\r\nregard to nervous defects. Probably one of the greatest surprises that\r\nnervous specialists have had in the last twenty-five years in the\r\ndomain of therapeutics came from the introduction of Frenkel's methods\r\nof retraining the muscles in locomotor ataxia. This idea of retraining\r\nhas been found useful in such distinct departments as the use of the\r\neye muscles, the co-ordination of the muscles of speech, so as to get\r\nrid of stuttering and stammering, and the muscles of the hand for\r\nwriting. We are only just beginning to realize that retraining can be\r\nof great value in psychic affections also. Patients may be disciplined\r\nagainst their dreads and tremulousness due to over-apprehension and\r\nagainst even certain defective uses of their intellect. Urbantschitsch\r\nof Vienna showed that by training defective hearing it might in many\r\ncases be very much improved. What he accomplished, however, was not\r\n{687} any better use of the external auditory apparatus, but a more\r\nintense attention of mind which enabled the patient to catch and\r\nunderstand sounds which had hitherto been so vague that their\r\nsignificance was lost.\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases of complaint of loss of memory I have\r\ndeliberately set patients to retrain their memories and have at least\r\nrelieved their apprehensions if I have not always succeeded in\r\nincreasing their actual memory power. It has even seemed, however,\r\nthat in old people some actual improvement of the memory faculties was\r\nthus brought about. Under the head of Occupation of Mind I have\r\nreferred to the exercise of memory in younger people as representing\r\nan excellent form of mental diversion. When the idea first suggested\r\nitself it seemed as though patients would not take to it at all, and\r\nyet I have found that with a little persuasion they become much\r\ninterested and find a great deal of pleasure in their gradually\r\nincreasing power to recall the great thoughts of great authors in the\r\nliteral original words. A reference to that chapter will tell more of\r\nmy experience. This made me more confident of the possibilities there\r\nwere of making people understand that if they were losing their\r\nmemories they could bring them back by proper exercise. In this way\r\nmany of the modern evils of lack of attention and of failure of\r\nconcentration of mind can be corrected.\r\n\r\nMy rule now is to tell patients who come complaining of loss of memory\r\nthat if there is any real loss of memory it is due to their improper\r\nuse of the faculty, or perhaps to their failure to exercise it\r\nsufficiently, for the proper performance of function depends on\r\nadequate exercise. They are then instructed to take certain simple\r\nclassical bits of literature and commit them to memory. At the\r\nbeginning such short poems with frequently repeated rhymes of the\r\nmodern poets as are comparatively easy to learn are set as memory\r\nexercises. Later Goldsmith's \"Traveler\" and \"Deserted Village\" are\r\nsuggested. Then passages from Shakeaspeare are given. Just as soon as\r\nthe patient finds that he can commit to memory as he used to, if he\r\nonly gives himself to the task, a change comes over his ideas with\r\nregard to the loss of memory. For many of these people the occupation\r\nof mind is an excellent therapeutic measure. Besides selections can be\r\nmade in such a way as to keep before their minds the thoughts they\r\nmost need in the shape of memory lessons. It is a discipline of memory\r\nthat revives it and also a constant exercise in favorable suggestion.\r\n\r\nGregor in the _Monattschrift fuer Psychiatrie und Neurologie_, Band\r\nXXI, has detailed some of his experiences with the retraining of the\r\nmemory of patients suffering from Korsakoff's Psychosis--alcoholic\r\nneuritis with psychic disturbances, especially of memory. The patient\r\nwas required to learn words and then after a certain length of time\r\nwas tested to see if he could learn a similar series with fewer\r\nrepetitions than at first. The memory increased in capacity with the\r\nexercises and there was evidently a definite gain in the faculty. In\r\nthis disease patients have also lost the power to some degree at least\r\nof recognizing objects. After exercises in recognition they are much\r\nmore capable in this matter, however, and it is evident that in every\r\nway the memory can be improved. This experience, with a serious form\r\nof disease that gravely impairs the memory, shows how much can be\r\naccomplished in circumstances far more unfavorable than are those\r\nwhich usually bring patients to the physician complaining of\r\ndeficiencies of memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{688}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC CONTAGION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term psychic contagion is often thought of as merely figurative.\r\nIt is, however, quite literal. Many minds are influenced by what they\r\nsee happening round them and induced to imitate the activities of\r\nothers. The term psychic contagion is so thoroughly descriptive of\r\nwhat happens that it deserves the place that it has secured.\r\n\r\nEverywhere and at all times we find historical traces of psychic\r\ncontagion compelling people to perform in crowds or groups the most\r\ncurious and inexplicable and sometimes the most horrible things. Even\r\nin the old myths before the times of the Trojan War, we have the story\r\nof hysteria spreading among the daughters of King Proteus, so that the\r\nfamous old physician, Pelampus, had to administer white hellebore in\r\ngoat's milk in order to relieve them. It is probable that this rather\r\nheroic remedy with its definite effect upon the bowels produced such a\r\nrevulsion of feeling as to cure the hysteria. Anyone who has read the\r\nawful tragedy that Euripides has written in the _Bacchae_ will have\r\nhad brought home to him a typical example of psychic contagion. The\r\nqueen mother in the midst of one of the Bacchic orgies kills her own\r\nson in the frenzy that has come from the religious excitement\r\nexaggerated by the association of a number of women in the religious\r\nrites of the god Bacchus. It is well understood that this was not a\r\ncase of drunkenness, but of psychic intoxication.\r\n\r\nPhrygian Bacchantes are described as overcome from time to time by\r\nparoxysms of curious uncontrollable automatic movements with or\r\nwithout disturbance of consciousness. This represents the earliest\r\nform of what came to be known afterwards as St. Vitus Dance when it\r\nspread among a number of people. Such manifestations were not at all\r\nuncommon in the East in the earlier days and they have continued\r\nduring all history. In Hindustan epidemics of automatic movements,\r\nevidently choreic in character, have been known for many centuries\r\nunder the name of _lapax_. Outbreaks of this kind were common in the\r\nMiddle Ages and Paracelsus has described them as happening early in\r\nthe sixteenth century. At any time the occurrence of an hysterical\r\nseizure in a crowded hall, and especially in a schoolroom, will lead\r\nto other hysterical manifestations. A case of chorea will induce\r\nimitative movements in susceptible bystanders that may be quite\r\nuncontrollable. Tics of various kinds are readily picked up by\r\nchildren and special care must be exercised to prevent their spread.\r\nIn general the state of mind is extremely important in all these\r\nconditions and they can be influenced favorably only through the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nContagions Trifles.--Perhaps the extent to which psychic contagion\r\ninfluences us can be seen better in little things than anywhere else.\r\nEveryone knows how contagious yawning is. Again and again observations\r\nhave been made while actors were yawning upon the stage. Nearly\r\neveryone in the theater begins to yawn in a few minutes and, in spite\r\nof the most determined {689} efforts, every now and then even the most\r\nserious-minded elderly gentleman in the audience finds himself\r\nunconsciously joining in. It seems foolish and to an onlooker appears\r\nalmost prearranged. It is only necessary, however, to yawn a few times\r\nin a street car, especially at night, to have many imitators. Nearly\r\nthe same thing is true of all respiratory phenomena. Sighing, for\r\ninstance, is quite contagious. Coughing is often as much the result of\r\nimitation as anything else. At certain pauses in church services a\r\npreliminary cough is heard and then some scattering coughs here and\r\nthere, like the musketry of scouts, and then a whole battery of coughs\r\nis let off, especially if it is in the winter time, because nearly\r\neverybody within hearing is tempted to cough. To talk about yawning or\r\ncoughing or sighing before some people is almost sure to produce a\r\ntendency to these manifestations. These apparently trivial happenings\r\nhelp to explain many phenomena of human imitation in more serious\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMost of the phenomena associated with expression are liable to be\r\ninitiated as the result of imitation. Laughing, for instance, is\r\nparticularly contagious among young folks and is especially likely to\r\nbe insuppressible when they wish to be particularly solemn. At\r\nreligious services it takes but little to make people laugh and\r\ngiggle, no matter how much they may wish to be dignified and\r\nreverential. A few giggling girls will sometimes disturb a serious\r\nservice. Extremes are particularly prone to meet in this matter and\r\nthe sublime easily becomes the ridiculous. A titter will set off even\r\nthe best intentioned of young folks in spite of resolutions to the\r\ncontrary. Crying has something of the same contagious nature, though\r\nit is not quite so strong, but among women tears are particularly\r\nlikely to evoke tears. The epidemic of curious manifestations of\r\nexpression, usually of an hysterical nature, that we know by tradition\r\nto have spread in communities in the Middle Ages and much later, are\r\nonly typical examples of this tendency for modes of expression to be\r\ncontagious to an exaggerated degree.\r\n\r\nExpectoration is largely dependent on imitation, sometimes conscious,\r\nof course, but often quite unconscious. In the recent crusade\r\norganized to prevent the spread of tuberculosis the question of\r\nexpectoration as a diffusing agent of the bacilli has given a new\r\nimportance to observations on this subject. It is recognized that we\r\nhave \"a spitting sex\" and that men spit from force of habit, boys\r\nimitate them, while women and girls almost never spit. There is no\r\nreason in the world why when men and women are engaged in the same\r\noccupations there should be any difference in this regard between\r\nthem, yet employers know how hard it is to keep corners and by-places\r\nin the rooms where men work free from expectoration, while no such\r\ndifficulty is found where women work. We have a spitting sex because\r\nof psychic contagion, and in spite of the fact that there are serious\r\ndangers connected with the habit. What is true of spitting may also be\r\ntrue of other habits relating to the respiratory passages. Hawking and\r\nblowing the nose more frequently than is needed are spread by psychic\r\ncontagion and certain habits in these matters that are injurious to\r\nthe respiratory apparatus often require considerable effort to break.\r\n\r\n\r\nFads and Health.--Enlightened as we think ourselves, we have many more\r\nexamples of psychic contagion in the present than we would perhaps\r\ncare to admit, unless the facts were called to our special attention.\r\n{690} At a particular period in the modern time it becomes the fad to\r\ndo things in a special way. We write alike, we build our houses after\r\na common type. We take our recreation in a particular fashion.\r\nBicycling comes in and goes out; roller skating attacks nearly every\r\none of the young folks and then is abandoned. There are fashions in\r\neverything and fashions, after all, are recurring instances of psychic\r\ncontagion. The mental influence spreads from one to another. It may be\r\nthat a particular fashion, as in houses or in clothes, is especially\r\nugly. That makes no difference. After a time taste revolts against it,\r\nbut in the meantime the psychic contagion is enough to overturn the\r\ncanons of taste. There are fashions in literature, or at least what is\r\ncalled literature. The nature novel comes and goes, then the novel of\r\nadventure has its place, then the detective novel, after a time the\r\nlittle-country prince or princess and their romance comes into\r\nfashion. After a time we realize that these are passing fancies, but\r\nin the meantime they have influenced many people.\r\n\r\nSome of these fashions bring conditions that are deleterious to\r\nhealth. The moving-picture show in places that almost never have a\r\nstime of sunlight in them and are, in their way, quite as bad,\r\nespecially for respiratory troubles, as the dust-laden atmosphere of\r\nthe roller-skating rink, become the fad of the moment in spite of\r\nknowledge or ignorance of hygiene. Just now we are in the midst of a\r\nfad for fresh air, that, unfortunately, goes and comes with the\r\ncenturies and we have no guarantee that people will not learn again to\r\nlive in closely sealed houses. High heels come and go, as do corsets\r\nof various kinds, more or less injurious, in spite of the admonition\r\nof the physician. In fact, one of the most interesting studies in\r\npsychic contagion is the history of the fashions. A particular\r\nfashion, especially in its exaggerated forms, will probably look well\r\non about one-fifth of the women at a given time. About four-fifths of\r\nthem, however, adopt it in spite of the fact that on three-fifths it\r\nemphasizes certain qualities that it would be well to keep in the\r\nbackground. It is woman's principal desire to please, yet this is\r\ncompletely perverted by the psychic epidemic of fashion which causes\r\npeople to follow after others quite as much as did the medieval people\r\nin various fads that attracted attention and have come down to us.\r\n\r\nOur enlightenment, at least in as far as that word means general\r\ndiffusion of the ability to read, has rather added to the power of\r\npsychic contagion. People accept ideas from others almost as\r\nunconsciously as they catch disease from those suffering from it. The\r\npsychology of advertising shows how easy it is to make people accept\r\nthings just by insisting on them and by frequent repetitions of\r\nstatements. The psychology of the proprietary medicine business in\r\nmodern times is about as typical an example of psychic contagion\r\ninduced deliberately as one could well imagine. Those who stop to\r\nreason do not fall victims. Most people, however, do not stop to\r\nreason. They have not the mental resistive vitality to render them\r\nimmune to the influence of certain irrationalities and so literally\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on perfectly useless,\r\noftentimes harmful drugs, which people had become persuaded through\r\nthe psychic contagium of printer's ink were sure to do them good. The\r\npsychology of the mob has been studied somewhat in recent years and it\r\nshows how clear it is that men follow after one another in doing\r\nfoolish things even more than in doing wise ones. Psychic contagion is\r\na prominent factor in life, it always has been, is now, and evidently\r\nalways {691} will be, and must be reckoned with by anyone who wishes\r\nto recognize the principles that underlie psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuicide Contagions.--It is with regard to much more serious things\r\nthan fashions, however, that psychic contagion is most manifest. For\r\ninstance, there is no doubt that suicide is frequently the result of\r\nsuch psychic influence. Seldom does it happen that a very queer\r\nsuicide is reported without there being certain imitations of it more\r\nor less complete in various parts of the country afterwards. There is\r\nno doubt that the reporting of suicides has a serious effect in this\r\nmatter. Perhaps the most striking example of this that we have ever\r\nhad in America was the well-known suicidal epidemic at Emporia,\r\nKansas, which reached its height just about the middle of June, 1901.\r\nTwo or three well-known people in town committed suicide at the end of\r\nMay and the beginning of June. A veritable epidemic of suicide broke\r\nout as a consequence. Nothing seemed to stop it and the authorities\r\nwere much disturbed. Finally it was agreed that the most potent\r\ninfluence in bringing about the imitation of the epidemic was the\r\npublication of the details of the suicides in the papers. The Mayor of\r\nthe city, after consulting with the Board of Health, decided to issue\r\nthe following proclamation:\r\n\r\n  I have consulted the Board of Health, and if the Emporia papers do\r\n  not comply with my request I shall have a right to stop, and I will\r\n  stop summarily, the publication of these suicide details, under the\r\n  law providing for the suppression of epidemics. There is clearly an\r\n  epidemic in this city, and although it is mental, it is none the\r\n  less deadly. Its contagion may be clearly shown to come from what is\r\n  known in medicine as the psychic suggestion found in the publication\r\n  of the details of suicides. If the paper on which the local Journals\r\n  are printed had been kept in a place infected with smallpox, I could\r\n  demand that the Journals stop using that paper, or stop publication.\r\n  If they spread another contagion--the contagious suggestion of\r\n  suicide--I believe the liberty of the press is not to be considered\r\n  before the public welfare, and that the courts would sustain me in\r\n  using force to prevent the publication of newspapers containing\r\n  matter clearly deleterious to the public health.\r\n\r\n\r\nMurder.--In almost the same way murders prove contagious. Especially\r\nis this true of murder and suicide together. These occur notably in\r\ngroups. A man who is downhearted and for whom the future looks blank,\r\nwill, out of a sense of pity for those who are dependent on him,\r\nmurder them and himself; then the brutal story is reported and another\r\ntottering intellect gives way and a similar story has to be told\r\nwithin a few days. A mother who is melancholic about her health and\r\nincludes her children in her gloomy outlook makes away with them and\r\nherself. Within a few days a similar story is reported because of the\r\ninfluence of psychic contagion. Very often there are distinct\r\nimitations of the methods employed in the first case. Often, however,\r\nit is only the idea itself that has proved contagious. There is no\r\ndoubt that this suggestion brings about subsequent cases when\r\notherwise such an awful thought might not occur. The connection is too\r\nclear for us to doubt the reality of it or to think that it is mere\r\ncoincidence. As in Emporia, doubtless the suppression of the\r\ndescription of such events would have a beneficial effect. There are\r\nmany disequilibrated minds, apparently just tottering on the verge of\r\nan insane act of this kind, that are pushed over by the suggestion\r\nfurnished by the details of another story.\r\n\r\n{692}\r\n\r\nPlace of Psychic Contagion.--The physician who would treat nervous\r\npatients successfully and use psychotherapeutics to advantage must\r\nrecognize the place that psychic contagion has in influencing the\r\ngenerality of mankind. We know that direct suggestions are profoundly\r\ninfluential. It must be constantly kept in mind, however, that\r\nindirect suggestion, suggestion that does not come by any formal\r\nmethod, but that is represented by the examples of those around, also\r\nhas great weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable Influence.--Fortunately it is not alone for evil that\r\npsychic contagion is manifest. People in a crowd stand fatigue better\r\nthan when alone. Soldiers marching in step do not notice their\r\ntiredness to such a degree and even forget their sore feet. People\r\nsuffering from hunger, so long as there is a good spirit among them,\r\nwill help each other to bear it. The accidents in coal mines in recent\r\nyears in which men have been imprisoned for considerable periods have\r\nshown that in groups they stand the hardships of confinement and of\r\nlack of food and water better than they do when alone, men live\r\nlonger, they do not suffer so much or at least their suffering is not\r\nso insistent, and they bear up better.\r\n\r\nThis has been particularly noticed in the cures at various watering\r\nplaces. The very air of the place takes on a favorable suggestion that\r\nis helpful to patients. The routine, the hopefulness of those who are\r\ncompleting the cure, the stories of improvement, the evident\r\nbetterment, all these things combine to give a psychic contagion of\r\nhealth. Health is, in this sense, quite as contagious as disease. This\r\nmust be taken advantage of just as far as possible for the advantage\r\nof patients. On the other hand, ideas are contagious for ill and\r\npatients may derive from their environment notions that prove\r\nauto-suggestive and against which it is extremely difficult to work.\r\nIdeas derived from the general feelings of those around, without any\r\ndirect suggestion, may become obsessions. The physician, therefore,\r\nmust be ready to secure prophylaxis against psychic contagion and then\r\nby counter-suggestion relieve the patient, who has become afflicted by\r\nit, of the resulting disturbance of mind. It must not be forgotten\r\nthat, instead of being less susceptible as education and civilization\r\nprogress, people really become more susceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychology of the Mob.--The most interesting instance of psychic\r\ncontagion is the tendency just hinted at for crowds to run away with\r\nthe sober judgment of serious sensible people that happen to be among\r\nthem and do things that may be extremely regrettable. A mob always\r\nfollows the suggestions of the worst elements in it unless perchance\r\nthere is some extremely strong character who asserts himself and\r\nimposes his views on the rest. The tendencies to panic, to cowardly\r\nflight, sometimes to destructiveness, that come over crowds represent\r\nthe power of psychic contagion to override reason. An alarm of fire\r\nwill, if a few persons lose their heads, lead to the most serious\r\nconsequences. Persons trample over one another, pull and maul one\r\nanother, sometimes even pulling out hair or pulling off ears in their\r\ninsane efforts to escape what is often an imaginary danger, though a\r\nfew moments before they were rational beings and they will be quite\r\nreasonable a short time after. It is possible, however, to overcome\r\neven the worst tendencies in human nature by the suggestive power of\r\ndiscipline. Fire drills in schools enable children to get out in a few\r\nminutes without confusion when without them the most serious results\r\ncould be looked for. Discipline and training, {693} following commands\r\nand observing tactics, helps an army almost more than the individual\r\ncourage of soldiers. The suggestive influence of the thought that now\r\nis the time to do something that has often been done before at the\r\nword of command is enough to enable the soldier to control his panicky\r\nfeelings. The difference between the trained soldier and the raw\r\nrecruit is great, but it consists only in this mental discipline and\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention.--Evidently, then, in the many circumstances in life in\r\nwhich psychic contagion manifests itself it is perfectly possible to\r\novercome its influence by such discipline and mental training as gives\r\nthe individual control over himself. In children corporal punishment\r\nis often not effective in breaking up habits and tendencies and the\r\nmotive of fear often lessens self-control and makes conditions worse.\r\nIn older people the fear of punishment is likely to be forgotten,\r\nwhereas the suggestion of discipline will assert itself powerfully.\r\nPsychic contagion can be neutralized by psychotherapy, but its force\r\nin life must be recognized and its unfavorable influence guarded\r\nagainst. While it concerns mainly the less serious things of life, it\r\nmay affect the most serious and imitation leads even to such serious\r\ncriminal acts as suicide and murder. The modes of psychic contagion,\r\nthen, must be constantly under surveillance.\r\n\r\nWith this before us it is extremely interesting to realize how\r\nunfavorably suggestive for human health and happiness are our\r\nnewspapers. They are constantly suggesting disease and suicide and\r\nmurder and sex crimes and crimes against property, by giving all the\r\ndetails available with regard to these subjects. Such news can do no\r\ngood, only excites morbid curiosity which requires still further\r\nsatisfaction in the same line, and keeps thoughts with regard to these\r\nthings constantly before the mind. We have had many burglaries and\r\nholdups and stealings of various kinds as a consequence of boys and\r\neven girls seeing the pictures of crimes in the moving-picture show.\r\nThe saturation of mind with disease and crime produced by daily\r\nreading of unsavory and sensational newspaper accounts is sure to\r\nproduce evil effects. There seems to be consolation for some people in\r\nreading of the crimes and punishments of others because they feel\r\nthat, bad as is their own state, there are others who are worse. This\r\n_schadenfreude_, \"harm-joy\" as the Germans call it, is not satisfying\r\nto think of for human nature and it has an inevitable reaction through\r\nthe unfavorable suggestion of these crimes.\r\n\r\nI have found over and over again that the prohibition of reading the\r\nnewspapers for a time did many nervous people much good. This is\r\nparticularly true for sufferers from such forms of psychasthenia as\r\nbring down on them dreads and premonitions of evil in fears for the\r\ndevelopment of disease and in general a sense of instability with\r\nregard to the future, lest dreadful things should happen to them. At\r\nfirst patients object strenuously and seem to be deprived of a great\r\nsatisfaction. After a time, however, they are invariably persuaded of\r\nthe fact that the absence of mental contact with human misfortune, in\r\nthis morbid way, is doing them good and that their dreads and\r\npremonitory feelings of evil drop from them.\r\n\r\n{694}\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX\r\n\r\n_DISORDERS OF WILL_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nALCOHOLISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years so much has been said about addiction to alcohol as a\r\ndisease rather than as a habit that the treatment of it frankly as a\r\ndisease in psychotherapeutics, even though there be not entire\r\nreadiness to agree with those who emphasize exclusively the\r\npathological interest of these cases, will not seem surprising. It is\r\nwith regard to the various habits, drug and alcoholic, occurring in\r\nneurotic subjects that psychotherapy proves most effective and has\r\nsecured some of its real triumphs. As a matter of fact, it has long\r\nbeen conceded that all of the so-called cures for alcoholism are\r\ndependent for their success upon the mental effect produced upon the\r\npatient. Most of them emphasize the necessity for building up the\r\nphysical condition of the patient as a necessary preliminary to any\r\nlasting cure. There is no doubt that the powers of resistance of a man\r\nwhose physical health has been seriously impaired by over-indulgence\r\nin alcohol and the lack of food and irregular sleep and exposure to\r\nthe elements that so frequently accompany it, will not be sufficient\r\nto enable him to break off the alcohol habit, nor afford him the\r\nability to inhibit the craving for stimulants, that he would have in a\r\nstate of health. On the other hand, even in good health, unless his\r\nmoral character is braced up, there will surely be a return to his old\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Resume of Cures.--We have had many different cures for\r\nalcoholism exploited during the last half century. The older method of\r\nthe first inebriate asylums founded in this country was to give a man\r\na disgust for liquor, as it was then called, by putting a small amount\r\nof alcohol into practically everything that he consumed. This did not\r\ngive him enough to satisfy his craving, but it did create in him an\r\nintense distaste for it by constantly keeping the flavor before him.\r\nThere was a drop or two of whiskey in his tea, there was some whiskey\r\nin his milk, there was a taste of it in the water that he drank, there\r\nwas some of it mixed even in the gravy of his meat, and he always had\r\nweak brandy sauce on his dessert. The consequence was, in most cases,\r\nsuch a complete disgust for liquor that men were sure that they would\r\nnever touch it again. Of course, in the meantime they were fed well\r\nand heartily, they were kept in an environment free from temptations\r\nto excessive indulgence in alcoholic drinks, they had brought home to\r\nthem what a mess they were making of their lives and their health,\r\nthey had time to reflect what ruin they were bringing on themselves\r\nand their families and usually they {695} recognized that they were\r\nthe kind of men who must stay away from alcohol absolutely, for whom\r\nthere could be no such thing as a moderate indulgence in stimulants.\r\nThis, with the intense distaste for alcohol, amounting almost to\r\nnausea at the sight of it, acquired from the system in vogue, started\r\nthem well on the road to reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moral Cures_.--It was the moral elements in the cure, however, that\r\nwere the most important, though its inventors were sure that the\r\nphysical elements played the largest role. The physical disgust for\r\nalcohol consequent upon having its taste constantly recur in\r\neverything at table passed off in a few weeks or at the most a few\r\nmonths. It was then that the moral uplift came in and had to be\r\neffective if the patient was to be preserved for the future from his\r\nold habit. If he was of a weak and flabby character, if,\r\nunfortunately, he was placed in circumstances where temptations were\r\nfrequent, if, owing to the enforced absence in the inebriate asylum\r\nhis business affairs had become involved and he was subject to many\r\nworries, then almost surely he dropped back. As a result his case was\r\neven more hopeless than before and, indeed, second cures were seldom\r\nof much benefit, for the man's confidence in himself was gone.\r\n\r\nAll in all, however, this old-time, simple method probably produced as\r\nlarge a proportion of \"real cures\" as any other method, even the much\r\nadvertised and discussed scientific discoveries of modern times. All\r\nof us have heard stories of men who had seemed to be hopeless\r\ndrunkards, who were thus reformed and hundreds of men who appeared to\r\nbe drifting into hopeless inebriety were reformed to such an extent\r\nthat they became not only useful members of society and supports to\r\ntheir families where they had before been a drain, but even became\r\nleaders in the work of uplifting the character of others to resist the\r\ntemptation of over-indulgence in stimulants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modern Cures_.--Of late we have had a number of \"cures\" for\r\nalcoholism widely exploited by well-directed advertising in the hands\r\nof men who realized what a fortune there was in this sort of thing and\r\nwho actually have made immense sums of money out of them. Needless to\r\nsay these \"cures,\" though supposed to be secret, did not long remain\r\nso. Perhaps the most famous of them, the one whose institutes were\r\nfound all over the country, was said to have used only two drugs,\r\nstrychnin and apomorphin. The strychnin was given as a needed and\r\nwell-chosen tonic for the physical condition of the patients who came\r\nto the institution usually in a rather seriously broken down\r\ncondition. When patients began the treatment they were distinctly told\r\nthat if they wanted whiskey at any time they could have it, but that\r\nthe next injection of the \"cure\" after they took the whiskey would\r\nshow how directly opposed to alcohol the ingredients of it were, by\r\nproducing vomiting and prostration.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the patients came in perfectly confident of the effect of\r\nthe remedy they had heard so much of. The strychnin injections made an\r\nexcellent tonic for these nervous wrecks, bracing them up at once so\r\nthat they felt better from the very beginning and this betterment was\r\nconfirmed by the growing assurance from the physician and the patients\r\naround them that now, at last, they were to be relieved of their\r\ndegrading habit. To those whose craving for alcohol returned in spite\r\nof the favorable condition in which they were placed and the\r\nstimulation of the strychnin, which made up so well, as a {696} rule,\r\nfor the absence of their accustomed alcohol, whiskey was actually\r\nallowed. When the next time for their injection came, however, these\r\npatients who had been given whiskey on their request did not now\r\nreceive an injection of strychnin but instead a small injection of\r\napomorphin. The apomorphin acted promptly in making the stomach\r\nrelieve itself and produced a complete and immediate sense of\r\nprostration. The limpness and discomfort of seasickness is as nothing\r\ncompared to the state that, as a rule, develops after such treatment.\r\nAnyone who has ever had to handle, in a hospital, a wildly drunk,\r\nlong-shoreman, whose brute strength in his irrational condition made\r\nhim a dangerous object for patients and physicians, who has seen even\r\nlarge doses of morphin fail to produce quiet, and then has felt bound\r\nfor the patient's sake as well as those around him, to administer a\r\ntenth of a grain of apomorphin with the result of having an eminently\r\ntractable patient in a few minutes, will have a good idea of what\r\nhappened to the poor alcoholic who got apomorphin instead of\r\nstrychnin.\r\n\r\nAfter that the inebriate knew that any further indulgence in liquor\r\nwould be followed by this extremely unpleasant result and so he had a\r\nnew argument for avoiding it. After a month or six weeks of careful\r\ntreatment, the preliminary rest that would restore physical health and\r\nstrength being followed by a course of exercise in the open air with\r\nplenty of good food, pleasant surroundings, and hope constantly held\r\nout to them, it is no wonder that these patients went out of the\r\nsanitariums as a rule confident that their habit was conquered for\r\ngood. In many cases this proved to be true. It was soon found,\r\nhowever, that there were many relapses. This hurt the prestige of the\r\n\"cure\" and the gradual diffusion of this idea spoiled its\r\neffectiveness. It still continued to do good, however, and though it\r\nhas been modified in various ways, and, indeed, in various parts of\r\nthe country is said to be applied quite differently, there are still\r\nmany reformations worked by these cures every year and they\r\nundoubtedly do good. The secret of its success, however, is not any\r\nmarvelous drug or other mode of treatment that is employed, but is\r\nbecause the victims of alcoholism are given an opportunity to retrieve\r\ntheir physical condition and then to brace up their moral characters\r\nso as to resist their craving for alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mental Influence_.--Other so-called cures and treatments have\r\nfollowed almost exactly similar lines. The main element in the cure\r\nhas been the producing in the mind of the patient a definite idea that\r\nhe can stay away from liquor if he really wishes to and then helping\r\nhis run-down physical condition so that he craves stimulants less than\r\nbefore. Whenever such \"sure cures\" are used on the worst forms of\r\nalcoholic patients as we see them in the large general hospitals of\r\nour greater cities, the bums of the streets, the drunkards of a score\r\nof years or more, they have practically no effect. The man must have\r\nmoral stamina, he must have some character left, besides, as a rule,\r\nhe must have some good reasons in worldly interest to help him to\r\nbrace up and then he may get away from alcoholism if he sincerely\r\nwills to reform. The important element, however, is the will to do so.\r\nIf he is firmly convinced that he cannot stay away from liquor, if he\r\nfeels in spite of all that has been done for him that he cannot resist\r\nhis craving, then, of course, he will not reform. Men, however, who\r\nhave sunk to the lowest depths, who, according to their own and\r\nothers' testimony, have scarcely drawn a {697} sober breath for ten or\r\neven twenty years, sometimes have something happen to them, often it\r\nseems very trivial to everyone but themselves, that stiffens their\r\nrelaxed moral fiber, that wakens their sense of manhood, that serves\r\nquite beyond expectation to give them a new purpose in life, and they\r\nreform and never drink again.\r\n\r\nIt is this successful phase of the cure of alcoholism, however it may\r\nbe explained, that is most interesting. It represents the most\r\nencouraging aspect of the whole question. Probably nothing more\r\nharmful has ever been done than the public proclamation that\r\nalcoholism is often an hereditary disease against which it is hopeless\r\nto struggle, and that the poor victims of it are to be pitied and not\r\nblamed. Except in those of low mentality, whether of intellect or\r\nwill, or in the actually insane, there never was a case of alcoholism\r\nthat did not deserve at least as much blame as is usually accorded to\r\nit. This is said after making due allowances for temperament. It is\r\nquite clear that for one man alcohol has no attractions at all, while\r\nfor another the craving for it is almost an insuperable temptation. It\r\nis idle to say that these two contrasted men are equally free as to\r\nwhether they shall take alcohol or not. Of course they are not equally\r\nfree. If the man who has no craving for alcohol prides himself on his\r\npower of resistance against the vile habit, he is simply fooling\r\nhimself. He probably knows nothing about the real nature of the\r\ntemptation of alcohol. The Spaniards have a proverb: \"He who doesn't\r\ndrink wine and doesn't smoke, the devil gets by some other way.\" There\r\nis probably something else with regard to which the non-alcoholic has\r\nquite as little freedom as the poor victim of alcoholism and the great\r\nlaw of compensation comes in to make up to both of them, for their\r\nfailings. Man has the defects of his virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposed Inheritance.--No man is such a slave to the habit, however,\r\nthat he cannot correct it if he will. We have heard much about the\r\ninheritance of this disease. We have heard even more about its\r\nessentially morbid character, though people used to think it a moral\r\ndefect. It must still be considered a moral defect, however, even\r\nthough we all concede that there is an element of the pathological in\r\nit. We are getting away entirely from the ordinary idea of inheritance\r\nof disease. There is no inheritance of acquired characters. The fact\r\nthat a man's father acquired the drinking habit because he was placed\r\nin circumstances where it was easy for him to indulge himself and\r\nbecause he did not have the moral stamina to resist, is no reason why\r\nhis son should have an unconquerable or even a very strong craving for\r\nalcohol. One might as well say that because a father lost a finger\r\nwhen he was young his son would be born without that finger. Alcohol\r\ndestroyed certain cells in the father's body and injured certain\r\nothers, but produced no change deep enough to lead to hereditary\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contagion More than Heredity_.--Perhaps some tendency to take alcohol\r\nruns in a family, that is, perhaps there is lessened resistance to the\r\ncraving for stimulants that awakens in every human being if it is once\r\naroused. This is what is true in tuberculosis. Some people have less\r\nresistive vitality to it than others. Careful autopsies show that\r\npractically every man who lives to be over thirty has or has had\r\nliving tubercle bacilli in his tissues. Seven-eighths of us are\r\nthoroughly able to resist them. The other eighth succumbs. Their lack\r\nof resistive vitality may in some degree be due to hereditary taint,\r\n{698} but that is doubtful and we know that they acquire the disease\r\nby contact with others who have it already and, as a rule, it is able\r\nto work its ravages because they are not living in conditions that\r\nwould help them to resist it. If they live in the free open air and\r\nhave plenty of good, simple food, the disease will not run its fatal\r\ncourse, but nature will cure it. If the craving for alcohol is lighted\r\nup by association, aroused by indulgence, rendered strong by\r\nenvironment and by exposure to temptations of all kinds with regard to\r\nit, then the resistive power of the individual is so lowered that the\r\nalcoholic habit rules him instead of his being able to command it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inherited Resistance_.--The most curious fact that has come out in\r\nour studies of heredity in recent years has been that far from\r\nheredity working its will in causing degeneration and deterioration of\r\nmankind, immunity, for the race at least, is acquired in the course of\r\nsubjection to disease and to various morbid habits. Nations, for\r\ninstance, that have been subjected to diseases for long periods no\r\nlonger display the susceptibility to them which they formerly\r\npossessed. After a disease has been endemic among a people for many\r\ngenerations that people gradually becomes quite insusceptible to its\r\neffects and suffers much less from it than before.\r\n\r\nJust this same thing is true of alcoholism. Nations that have been the\r\nlongest in a position to be subject to the temptation to use alcohol\r\nin its stronger forms suffer least from the ravages of alcoholism. The\r\nsouthern nations of Europe using wine daily and knowing well the\r\nprocess of distillation to help them to make stronger drink for many\r\nhundreds of years, now exhibit much less tendency to over-indulgence\r\nin strong drink than the northern nations whose ancestors have only in\r\ncomparatively recent times been subjected to the temptation of craving\r\nfor strong alcoholic liquors. The attitude of any nation toward\r\nalcohol is a function of the length of time that nation has had a\r\nchance to procure strong drink easily. Our American Indians\r\ndiscovered, as has every people at some time, that intoxicating liquor\r\ncould be made by allowing solutions of starch and sugar to ferment. It\r\nwas only with the coming of the European, however, that they were\r\nprovided with \"fire water\"--strong drink--in quantities. Its effect on\r\nthem is a matter of history. Two things the white man brought his\r\nIndian brother to which the Indians were unaccustomed and that\r\ngradually obliterated the original inhabitants of this\r\ncountry--infectious diseases and strong alcoholic liquors. They proved\r\nequally fatal because of Indian susceptibility to them.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it is clear that just such an immunity to\r\nthe effect of alcohol is produced in a people exposed to its effects\r\nin concentrated form for a long time as with regard to an infectious\r\ndisease when they have been correspondingly exposed to it. Heredity,\r\nthen, instead of playing a role that brings about deterioration in the\r\nrace, on the contrary, carries on the higher qualities and gives us,\r\nas might be expected in the course of evolution, a better, that is, a\r\nmore resistant, race. Most of what is commonly said as to alcoholism,\r\nand unfortunately most of the recent so-called popular scientific\r\narticles on this subject, seem to point to just the opposite\r\nconclusion to this. Men are supposed to be condemned by heredity to an\r\ninevitable craving to take alcoholic drinks that, in certain of them\r\nat least, cannot be overcome by any natural power of resistance. At\r\nthis stage of our western civilization this is not true for anyone, as\r\nthe more susceptible families have been long {699} since eliminated\r\nand it is a personal weakness and not a family characteristic that\r\nleads people to indulge this appetite to their own destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unfavorable Suggestion of Heredity Idea_.--An alcoholic patient, or\r\neven a man with only a moderately strong tendency to take alcohol to\r\nexcess, who harbors any such notion as this, has a serious impediment\r\nto the full exercise of his will in overcoming the difficulties that\r\nhe encounters in any attempt at reform. In going counter to so much\r\nthat has been written and still more that has been said and generally\r\naccepted on this subject I feel it necessary to quote a good recent\r\nauthority on the matter and so here insert these passages from \"The\r\nPrinciples of Heredity\" by Dr. Archdall Reid.   [Footnote 53] He says\r\n(p. 157):\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 53: Author of \"The Present Evolution of Man,\" \"Alcoholism,\"\r\n  \"A Study in Heredity,\" etc. Chapman and Hall, London, 1905. ]\r\n\r\n  Formerly all the world believed in the transmission of acquirements,\r\n  and consequently all the world was constantly finding conclusive\r\n  evidence of its constant occurrence. To-day there is hardly a rag of\r\n  that evidence left, and, with rare exceptions, only certain French\r\n  medical observers are able to discover fresh evidence. It is a\r\n  remarkable fact, however, that the problem of evolution--of\r\n  adaptation--has excited singularly little interest in France, and\r\n  it is equally curious that these French observations relate almost\r\n  entirely to laboratory work which it is not easy to repeat. In Great\r\n  Britain or Germany, you may cut off the tails of a thousand dogs, or\r\n  amputate the limbs of a thousand men, or observe the non-infected\r\n  offspring of a thousand tuberculous patients, and get no evidence of\r\n  transmission.\r\n\r\nWith regard to alcohol Dr. Reid in the same volume insists on the\r\nproposition that alcohol does not cause degeneration of a race,\r\ncreating, as is claimed, ever more and more a tendency for people to\r\ntake it because their immediate ancestors have taken it, but, on the\r\ncontrary, there is a distinct evolution against it, and that what is\r\nhereditary, not by acquisition, but by family trait, is an immunity\r\nagainst the disease which eventually protects the nations that have\r\nbeen longest exposed to the effects of alcohol from the evil\r\nconsequences of the substance. He says (p. 196):\r\n\r\n  How, then, has alcohol affected the races that have used it? Are the\r\n  Jews and the races inhabiting the South of Europe the most\r\n  degenerate on earth? Are North Europeans only less degenerate? Are\r\n  the races that have never used alcohol, the Terra del Fuegians, the\r\n  Esquimaux, and the Australian blacks, for instance, mentally and\r\n  physically the finest in the world? We have only to state the\r\n  proposition to see its absurdity. There is no evidence that the\r\n  hereditary tendencies of any race have been altered by alcohol\r\n  circulating in the blood and acting directly on the germ plasm. Once\r\n  again the sufferings of the peoples have produced no effect, but the\r\n  deaths among the peoples have produced an immense effect. Every race\r\n  that has had experience of alcohol is temperate in the presence of\r\n  an abundant supply in proportion to the length and severity of its\r\n  past experience of the poison. The South Europeans and the Jews are\r\n  the most temperate peoples in the world. West Africans also are very\r\n  temperate. North Europeans are not drunken. Those savages, and those\r\n  only, who have had little or no experience of alcohol--Esquimaux,\r\n  Red Indians, Patagonians, Terra del Fuegians, Australian blacks--are\r\n  beyond all the peoples the most drunken on earth.\r\n\r\nLest it should be thought that this discussion of the subject is only\r\nof significance with regard to nations and does not touch the\r\nindividual, and, therefore, has but little significance for the\r\nproblem that we are treating here. Dr. Reid's succeeding paragraph\r\ndeserves attention:\r\n\r\n{700}\r\n\r\n  Stated in this brief and direct way, the thesis is apt to excite\r\n  incredulity. It is sharply opposed to popular beliefs, though that\r\n  need not trouble us. Popular notions on abstruse points of science\r\n  are occasionally erroneous. Of more importance is the fact that a\r\n  mass of statistics purporting to prove that the children of\r\n  drunkards tend to be degenerate has been compiled, especially by\r\n  medical men in charge of lunatic asylums. But no \"control\"\r\n  observations appear to have been made. We know that many drunken\r\n  parents have normal children; certainly, therefore, parental\r\n  drunkenness is not invariably a cause of filial degeneration. We\r\n  know also that many temperate parents have defective children. There\r\n  is nothing to show that the proportion is greater in the one case\r\n  than in the other. Even were it established that the proportion of\r\n  defective children is higher in the case of drunken parents, it\r\n  would still have to be proved that the relation is one of cause and\r\n  effect. People who have an inborn tendency to mental defect, who are\r\n  abnormally depressed, nervous, restless or irritable, are often so\r\n  constituted as to find solace in drink. Their children are liable to\r\n  inherit their inborn mental defects with spontaneous\r\n  variations--that is, to inherit the defect to a greater or lesser\r\n  extent. The unborn child of a drunken and pregnant mother is\r\n  practically another drunken person, as liable, or more liable to\r\n  suffer from the effects of drink; but in such a case the resulting\r\n  defect, though a mere acquirement, is tolerably certain to be\r\n  regarded as a congenital (i. e. inborn) defect by the medical man\r\n  who sees it. Mere acquirements, also, are the defects due to the\r\n  ill-treatment, want and neglect to which the children of drunken\r\n  parents are particularly exposed. Indeed, were it fully established\r\n  that drunken parents, other than pregnant mothers, tend to have an\r\n  excessive number of their children \"congenitally defective,\" it\r\n  would still be a question whether the filial defects were not mere\r\n  acquirements. Prof. Cossar Ewart's observations on diseased pigeons\r\n  renders this not unlikely. All these sources of error render the\r\n  success of a statistical inquiry peculiarly difficult, if not\r\n  impossible, but there is no indication that they ever occurred to\r\n  the minds of the compilers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarnings as Suggestions.--I have a case in my notes in which a rather\r\nprominent professional man insists that he is quite sure that the\r\nalcoholism from which he suffered during the ten years between\r\ntwenty-five and thirty-five was entirely due to suggestion. As a boy\r\nof sixteen he had gone off to boarding school, but not until his\r\nmother had taken him aside, told him that his father had drunk himself\r\nto death, had done it by secret tippling, and that they had found that\r\nfor many years he had been accustomed to have whiskey near him in his\r\noffice and take it rather frequently. He had never tasted spirituous\r\nliquor at this time and his mother begged him not to, for she felt\r\nsure that if he did his father's craving would awaken in him and would\r\nbecome uncontrollable. The day that he went away his father's eldest\r\nbrother took him aside and said practically the same thing to him. A\r\nmaiden aunt was not quite so emphatic, but she, too, pleaded with him\r\nto understand all the dangers. For his first year at school he did not\r\ntouch liquor, but in his second year he tasted it once or twice but\r\nhad no particular craving aroused in him. By chance when he was home\r\nat Christmas time some college mates who were visiting him gave his\r\nmother the impression that he belonged to a rather jovial set. Once\r\nmore he was warned by mother and uncle. Above all they told him never\r\nto keep strong drink near him because that was what his father used to\r\ndo. During his college years the fear of this hung over him. He\r\nresented it and probably took more liquor than he would have so far as\r\nactual craving went. After getting out into active life once more he\r\nsuggested himself into the habit of taking an occasional glass of\r\nwhiskey by himself. After a time he was constantly taking too much.\r\nFor {701} ten years he hurt all of his prospects, broke his mothers\r\nheart, and was looked upon as a hopeless alcoholic. Then one day the\r\nthought came to him that it was not that he craved alcohol so much,\r\nbut that his thoughts turned on it constantly and at first he dreaded\r\nit overmuch, then wondered what attraction there could be and then\r\nacquired a habit by suggestion. Once this train of thought worked\r\nitself out in his mind, he quit spirituous liquors for good. For ten\r\nyears he has not touched them, he does not care for them, they do not\r\nconstitute a temptation.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that many warnings may so preoccupy the mind\r\nwith regard to a danger as to constitute temptations by suggestion.\r\nThis is eminently true of alcoholism, the drug habits, sex habits and\r\nthe like, in spite of the foolish present-day notion that information\r\nand warning must necessarily be helpful. In all these, teaching may be\r\nsuggestively harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--The most important part of the treatment of alcoholism\r\nthrough mental influence is by prophylaxis, and that, to be effective,\r\nmust begin very early. Just as with regard to overeating, as I have\r\npointed out in the chapter on Obesity, it is extremely important not\r\nto permit children to acquire habits with regard to alcohol when they\r\nare young. During the growing years the system, indeed one may say all\r\nthe systems of the body--the nervous, the muscular, the digestive and\r\nthe mental systems--are all more or less unstable. Deep impressions\r\nmay be produced on them then, and if children are allowed, much less\r\nencouraged, during their growing years (and this includes practically\r\nall the years up to twenty-five) to indulge in alcohol, then one can\r\nlook for the development of a craving very hard to eradicate later in\r\nlife. Many of them will be able to conquer the desire thus awakened,\r\nbut a great many of them will not. We have some very definite evidence\r\non this point and some of it collected here in America is very\r\nvaluable. Dr. Alexander Lambert of New York made a study of over 250\r\ncases of alcoholism seen in the wards at Bellevue Hospital, paying\r\nspecial attention to the age at which the patients remembered they had\r\nbegun the use of alcoholic liquors. If anyone doubts the influence of\r\nyouth in this matter, then his statistics should be read:\r\n\r\n  Of 259 instances where the age of beginning to drink was known, four\r\n  began before six years of age; thirteen between 6 and 12 years;\r\n  sixty between 12 and 16; one hundred and two between 16 and 21;\r\n  seventy-one between 21 and 30; and eight only after 30 years of age.\r\n  Thus nearly seven per cent. began before 12 years of age, or the\r\n  seventh school year; thirty per cent. began before the age of 16;\r\n  and over two-thirds--that is, sixty-eight per cent.--began before 21\r\n  years of age.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Smith Williams, commenting on Dr. Lambert's study of this\r\nsubject in his article on \"The Scientific Solution of the Liquor\r\nProblem,\"  [Footnote 54] states emphatically the conclusion so\r\ninevitable from these statistics that more than anything else\r\nalcoholism is the result of habits and occasions created in early\r\nyears. He adds some remarks that are worth noting for those who are\r\ninterested in the prevention and cure of alcoholism, not only in\r\nparticular cases, but also for the community:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: _McClure's Magazine_, February. 1909.]\r\n\r\n{702}\r\n\r\n  In the light of such facts, it is clear that the drink problem is\r\n  essentially a problem of adolescence. The cumulative effects of\r\n  alcoholic poisoning frequently fail to declare themselves fully\r\n  until later in life; but the youth who does not taste liquor till\r\n  his majority minimizes the danger of acquiring the habit in its most\r\n  insistent form; and the man who does not drink until he is thirty is\r\n  in no great danger of ever becoming a drunkard. As to the man who\r\n  has passed forty--well, according to the old saw, he must be either\r\n  a fool or his own physician. His habits of mind and body are formed,\r\n  and if he becomes a drinker now he can at most curtail by a few\r\n  years a life that is already entering upon the reminiscent stage. As\r\n  factors in racial evolution, the youth of each successive\r\n  generation, not its quadragenarians, are of interest and importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The conclusions that naturally flow from the historical\r\nintroduction to this chapter which show mental influence as the basis\r\nof all cures, simplify very much the treatment of alcoholism on\r\npsychotherapeutic principles. There is no doubt that moral means are\r\nthe only really effective remedies in this matter. They fail often,\r\nnot because of any lack of power, but because of lack of co-operation\r\non the part of the patient. There are men whose mentality and\r\nresponsibility is breaking down, and who are on the way to the insane\r\nasylum for various causes, who cannot be thus influenced. They are,\r\nhowever, not alcoholics, but incipient insane patients likely to go to\r\nexcess in any line. There is no pretense that psychotherapy will cure\r\nmental disorder that rises to the height of real insanity. On the\r\nother hand, just as after several relapses of tuberculosis due to the\r\nfoolishness of the patient, further improvement by sanatorium\r\ntreatment is usually out of the question, so each relapse of the\r\nalcoholic patient makes it increasingly difficult to bring about\r\nnoteworthy improvement. There are examples, however, which demonstrate\r\nthat even after seventy times seven relapses men may still encounter\r\nsomething that rouses their dormant wills to real activity and then\r\ntheir alcoholism is a thing of the past, for good and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sanitarium Question_.--There always comes the question whether these\r\ncases need to be sent to a sanitarium or can be treated at home. The\r\nanswer to this question is the same for alcoholism as it is for\r\ntuberculosis or, indeed, for any of the exhaustive diseases. It all\r\ndepends on the individual's physical condition and his circumstances.\r\nIf tuberculosis is discovered, as it should be, at a very early stage\r\nin the disease--not when the patient is coughing up bacilli in large\r\nnumbers and already has many physical signs in his lungs, but when he\r\nhas a slight unproductive cough and over-rapid pulse and some\r\nprolongation of expiration at one apex--then he may be cared for at\r\nhome, if the physician is confident that he can make his patient feel\r\nthe absolute necessity for following instructions and can make him\r\nrealize the seriousness of his condition in spite of the few symptoms\r\nthat are present. If his environment is unfavorable, in a crowded\r\ntenement house or where an abundance of fresh air cannot be readily\r\nobtained, the patient may have to go to a sanitarium for proper\r\ntreatment even at this early stage, or at least he will have to change\r\nhis living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis question has received a very different answer in recent years\r\nfrom what used to be given to it. Formerly the physician hesitated to\r\nsay \"tuberculosis\" to his patient until the disease was well advanced\r\nand then he advised the distant West or some other change of climate,\r\nthough, as a rule, this brought only a palliation of symptoms, the\r\ncase being too far advanced, and {703} the fatal termination came in\r\nthe course of two or three years. Now the careful physician diagnoses\r\ntuberculosis much earlier, detects the disease in its incipiency, and\r\nis able to treat the patient at home quite successfully, if conditions\r\nare at all favorable. It is true he has to make him give up fatiguing\r\noccupations, and especially those in dusty places; he has to insist on\r\nhis living out of doors a good part of the day, even though there\r\nshould be no better means of securing this than the roof or a\r\nfire-escape, and on keeping his windows open all night. He has to\r\nwatch his nutrition carefully and see that he gains in weight. If all\r\nthis can be accomplished, however, there is no reason why a\r\ntuberculosis patient in the incipient state should not get better at\r\nhome almost as well as he would at a sanitarium. The only difference\r\nbetween the two methods of treatment is that in a sanitarium the\r\npatient realizes that his one duty in life is to care for his health\r\nand he does not bother about other things, as he is likely to do if he\r\nremains at home.\r\n\r\nIf this precious development of teaching with regard to tuberculosis,\r\nwhich is founded on such thorough-going common sense and the\r\napplication of good therapeutic principles to the treatment of the\r\ndisease, be transferred to the sphere of alcoholism, then the answer\r\nto the question whether there shall be sanitarium treatment or not is\r\npractically arrived at. If the patient is in an early stage of his\r\nalcoholism, if the pathological character of his tendency to take\r\nintoxicants has been recognized and made clear to him early, then\r\nthere is little difficulty in treating him at home. The crux of the\r\nproblem is just that which occurred with regard to tuberculosis years\r\nago. The physician does not take the early symptoms of the affection\r\nseriously enough. He does not want to disturb his patient's equanimity\r\nby the suggestion that he is in the incipient stage of alcoholism any\r\nmore than a few years ago the family physician cared to suggest the\r\nawful thought of tuberculosis until the condition had reached a\r\nserious stage. But this is the essential preliminary to the successful\r\ntreatment of alcoholism just as it is to the successful treatment of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIt is almost useless to send advanced cases of tuberculosis, in which\r\ncavity formation has already occurred, to a sanitarium. The course of\r\ntheir disease may be delayed for a while, but scarcely more than that.\r\nTheir resistive vitality has been so overcome by the ravages of the\r\ndisease that their ultimate cure seems beyond hope, yet not\r\ninfrequently wonderful results are obtained even in these cases. Just\r\nthis same thing is true with advanced cases of alcoholism. No one can\r\ndo anything with them, though careful treatment in a sanitarium may,\r\non a number of occasions, afford them opportunity to brace up and be\r\nthemselves, i.e., their better selves, for several months. Just as\r\nwith tuberculosis, however, even the quite advanced cases will\r\nsometimes be so much bettered by sanitarium treatment that, though\r\ntheir prognosis seemed absolutely hopeless and was so pronounced by\r\ngood authorities, all the symptoms are relieved and the patients get a\r\nnew lease of life that may last for many years.\r\n\r\nIn the same way some apparently hopeless cases of alcoholism will\r\nbrace up after sanitarium treatment and have many years of useful\r\nsober life without a break. In alcoholism, as in tuberculosis, the\r\nwill of the individual is the all-important consideration. Someone has\r\nsaid that tuberculosis takes away mainly the quitters. Those who have\r\nthe courage to insist that they {704} _will live_ in spite of\r\neverything being apparently against them, pull through crises that\r\nseem absolutely hopeless and survive for years. Robert Louis Stevenson\r\nbravely doing his work, living on in spite of fate and disease, is the\r\ntypical example. Alcoholism completely overcomes only the quitters. If\r\na man wants to give up drinking even when he seems practically a\r\nhopeless wreck from the effects of alcohol, he can do so if he has a\r\nphysician in whom he has confidence, who will relieve him from\r\ndepressing symptoms due to previous excess, who will lift him up and\r\nstrengthen him by food and stimulation, and, above all, by faithful,\r\nunending, never discouraged assurance that he can conquer the craving\r\nwhich has such a hold of him, if he only persists a little and does\r\nnot give up the struggle. The victory is worth while and it is not\r\nhard to lift a man up if he has any remnants of character left.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Confidence_.--In the treatment of alcoholism, then, just two things\r\nare necessary. One of these is that the patient has confidence in\r\nhimself, the other that he has confidence that his physician can help\r\nhim over the hard spots on the road. There is no doubt that many drugs\r\ncan be used that will lessen the patient's irritability, increase his\r\nnerve force, stimulate organs which are depressed by the reaction\r\nagainst over-stimulation, arouse appetite and correct disturbed\r\nfunctions. All these things must be done. It is no use laying down any\r\nset of rules as to how they shall be done, for they must be done\r\ndifferently in individual patients. It is not alcoholism that is\r\ntreated nor the effects of alcoholism, but an individual alcoholic\r\npatient, and a set of symptoms that are very different in every\r\nindividual. The more physiological disturbance can be relieved by\r\nproper drug, dietetic, hydropathic and remedial measures, the more\r\nchance is there for the patient to get over his habit without trouble.\r\nEvery ill feeling that he has tempts him to think of alcohol. Above\r\nall, he must be made to sleep, his bowels must be thoroughly\r\nregulated, and he must be made to eat heartily. For stimulation full\r\ndoses of nux vomica, not less than thirty drops three or four times a\r\nday or even oftener, are probably best.\r\n\r\nFor cases of alcoholism in the earlier stages there is but little\r\ndifficulty. Those who try the effect of favorable suggestion, of\r\nconfident assurance, of constantly repeated encouragement on\r\nindividuals who have begun to be afraid that they cannot break the\r\nhabit, will frequently have the most gratifying results. The important\r\npoint to remember is that men are suffering from alcoholism who are\r\nindulging in alcohol every day and to whom it has become more or less\r\nof a necessity, though even as yet its effect upon their business is\r\nnot marked and they are not known, even among their acquaintances, as\r\ndrunkards. Whenever a man must have three or four whiskeys a day or he\r\ncannot do his business and his appetite fails him and he does not\r\nsleep well, he is an alcoholist. He has the cellular craving that\r\nlater may become an absolute tyrant. If we can educate the community\r\ngenerally to realize this as we are gradually educating them to the\r\nknowledge that tuberculosis must be caught in its incipient stage and\r\nthat pulmonary consumption begins in very mild symptoms after a person\r\nhas been exposed to it, we shall have little difficulty in curing\r\ntuberculosis or in treating alcoholism successfully by suggestion.\r\n\r\nFor alcoholism, as for the drug habits and also the sex habits, moral\r\ninfluences are all-important. Hence the necessity for exercising them\r\n{705} frequently. It is probable that the best way to break any of\r\nthese habits is to have the patient come regularly to the physician's\r\noffice, at least once, and at the beginning twice a day. In cases of\r\nalcoholism the method of giving for the first week, at least, the dose\r\nof the stimulant drug which replaces the alcoholic stimulation\r\ndirectly to the patient is often of great service. It seems a good\r\ndeal to ask the patient to come three times a day just to get a drug\r\n(tonic), but it is comparatively easy to resist the craving for liquor\r\nfor four or five hours, that is, until the doctor is seen again, while\r\nsometimes twenty-four hours will seem a long while. The personal\r\nelement in this matter is extremely valuable. It is this that has made\r\nthe efficiency of all forms of cures, and it is only this that can be\r\nsuccessfully used.\r\n\r\nHow much can be accomplished for even the worst forms of drunkenness\r\nand under extremely unfavorable circumstances once a really strong\r\nimpression is made on the individual's mind and his will is aroused to\r\nhelp himself seriously may be readily learned from the lives of any of\r\nthe great temperance advocates. Their experience is illuminating. It\r\nshows clearly that strong personal influence will do more than\r\nanything else for these sufferers. Sometimes their efforts are\r\nsupposed to affect only certain classes of individuals who have\r\ncharacter but who, for some reason, have fallen into an unfortunate\r\nhabit. A little investigation will show, however, that they affect all\r\nclasses and kinds of individuals and, indeed, may reform a whole\r\ncommunity. The story of Father Matthew is very interesting in this\r\nregard because there is some striking testimony as to his reformation\r\nof whole neighborhoods that had been given over to drink before and\r\nthat among a people especially emotional and susceptible. The movement\r\nthat he initiated still lives in the temperance societies of the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples everywhere which help by prophylaxis in youth\r\nand the moral force of association in later life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter-Treatment.--In alcoholism the most important feature of the\r\ntreatment is what has come to be known in our time as the\r\nafter-treatment. This department of therapeutics has taken on great\r\nimportance in recent years in every form of disease. For early and\r\nmiddle life most diseases have a definite tendency to get better,\r\nthough many of them leave distinct pathological tendencies. The\r\nafter-treatment, then, has become much more important than the cure\r\nfor the patient during the existence of the acute or sub-acute stage.\r\nEven in children's diseases it is now generally recognized that while\r\nmeasles and whooping cough are not dangerous affections as a rule,\r\nthey may prove the forerunners of tuberculosis, because of the\r\nweakened pulmonary resistance consequent upon their invasion. For\r\nscarlet fever, the possibilities of injury to the kidneys after the\r\ngreat irritation to which they have been subjected, is now recognized\r\nand convalescence is prolonged. In typhoid fever we realize that not\r\nweeks but many months of convalescence are needed to put the patient\r\nbeyond the risk of various degenerative processes that may be serious.\r\nThere is even question in the minds of many observant physicians\r\nwhether the weakness incident to typhoid fever may not, if a premature\r\nreturn to work is allowed, prove a potent cause of precocious\r\narterio-sclerosis.\r\n\r\nIn a word, after-treatment has become one of the most interesting\r\nsubjects of modern therapeutics. It will not be surprising, then, if\r\nwe insist that the after-treatment of the alcoholic is the most\r\nimportant part of the remedial methods to be employed. If a man who\r\nhas suffered from tuberculosis because {706} he was working in one of\r\nthe many dusty trades and living in a badly ventilated tenement house\r\nis restored to health or at least has all his symptoms disappear as a\r\nconsequence of sanitarium treatment, it is almost needless to say that\r\nhe must not be allowed to return to the conditions in which his\r\ndisease originally developed. If he does, he is absolutely certain to\r\nhave a relapse. This phase of tuberculosis has been much discussed in\r\nrecent years. It is often said that it is impossible to keep working\r\npeople from a return to their occupations. Just so far as that is\r\nimpossible, so far will any real hope of keeping their tuberculosis in\r\nabeyance be reduced. They are much more likely to suffer from the\r\ndisease, as a rule, after their return from the sanitarium than they\r\nwere before they originally contracted it, because apparently some of\r\ntheir immunity has been destroyed by the invasion of the bacillus.\r\n\r\nIt is only recently that we have thus planned for the after-treatment\r\nof tuberculosis. If we are to be successful in the after-treatment of\r\nalcoholism, at least some of this same thoughtfulness must be\r\nexercised. The victims must be discouraged from going back into the\r\nconditions in which their habit developed. It is comparatively easy,\r\nespecially at the beginning of his alcoholism, to stimulate a man back\r\nto normal physical condition, to reduce his craving for intoxicants,\r\ngive him back his appetite and set him on his feet again. The\r\naffection is quite curable. If a man returns to the conditions in\r\nwhich it originally developed, however, it will develop again quite as\r\ninevitably as tuberculosis does under similar conditions. We do not\r\nblame the sanitarium if, after having given a man a new lease of life\r\nin spite of tuberculosis, he resumes the unsanitary life in which his\r\ndisease originally developed and has a relapse. It is not the fault of\r\nthe system of treatment for alcoholism if men relapse, but the blame\r\nis upon them that they do not take their danger of relapse seriously\r\nenough, permit themselves to get into an unfavorable environment, and,\r\nas a consequence, suffer once again from their affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Religious Motives_.--More and more we are realizing the place of the\r\nhigher motives of life in the reform of alcoholic patients. Religious\r\nmotives probably form the best possible source of suggestions that\r\nenable a patient to lift himself out of the slough of despond of\r\nchronic alcoholism. Many of the best workers for the reform of the\r\ndrunkard were themselves drunkards for many years. The motive of\r\nhelping others is particularly important in its effects upon any\r\nalcoholic. Some motive apart from himself is more helpful than any\r\nappeal to his selfishness or even to what he can do for his children\r\nand his wife. It is the newer motive that appeals most strikingly. In\r\nrecent years certain church movements have done much for alcoholic\r\npatients. In this they are only repeating the effect of other great\r\nchurch movements and the effect of the lives of apostles of temperance\r\nin recent generations. Without these higher motives cure is probably\r\nimpossible in many cases. With them it not only becomes possible but\r\neven comparatively easy in the most hopeless-looking cases.\r\n\r\nIn the light of what we have heard recently of the success of the\r\nEmanuel movement in the treatment of alcoholism, it is interesting to\r\nrecur to what was said in this relation by Prof. Forel of Zurich on\r\nthe treatment of alcoholism, in a communication read to the South\r\nGerman Neurologists and Psychiatrists at its meeting in Freiburg over\r\ntwenty years ago. Prof. Forel, who is not what {707} would be called a\r\nparticularly religious-minded man, insisted that \"an inebriate asylum\r\ncan only with great difficulty be successful without religious\r\nauxiliaries, since most inebriates, and especially at the beginning of\r\ntheir reformation, are entirely too weak to get along without\r\nreligious consolation. To secure this, however, the nicest tact is\r\nrequired in order to permit the practice of all the different nuances\r\nof faith that men have, in peace and comfort. This can only be secured\r\nif in practice faith is subjected to charity for one's neighbor as the\r\nbasis for religion.\"\r\n\r\nMany such expressions have been used before and since in practically\r\nevery country in Europe. The assertion that physicians have failed to\r\nrecognize the part that religion plays in such cases is entirely\r\nwithout foundation and can only be made by those who are quite\r\nignorant of our medical literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDRUG ADDICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been said with regard to alcoholism finds ready\r\napplication to the treatment of drug addictions. At the very beginning\r\nit must be realized that there is no specific remedy that will enable\r\nthe patient to overcome his craving for a drag to which he has become\r\nhabituated. There is no method of treatment that will infallibly and\r\nwithout serious and prolonged and determined effort on his part enable\r\nhim to overcome his craving. The first and most important thing in any\r\nsystem of treatment is the patient's good will. If the patient is not\r\nready to give up the drug, then nothing that a physician can do for\r\nhim will make him do so, or will turn him against it; above all,\r\nnothing will make the process of cure so easy that there will be no\r\ntrouble involved or only a passing period of struggle required to\r\naccomplish it. There have been many claims made in this matter. We\r\nhave wanted such remedies and methods of treatment so much that it has\r\nbeen rather easy to persuade us sometimes that they have been\r\ndiscovered. It is like the question of specifics in medicine. For\r\ncenturies men devoted themselves to trying to find a specific remedy\r\nfor each disease. It was thought they must exist in nature. Now we\r\nknow that they probably do not exist, though those who claim to\r\ndiscover them find an easy livelihood exploiting the credulity of\r\nthose who still cherish the belief in them. Scientific students of\r\nmedicine have practically given over the search for them in order to\r\ndevote themselves to strengthen the patient to resist the disease\r\nrather than spend more time trying to find something to give him that\r\ncures it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreating the Patient rather than the Habit--This principle holds with\r\nspecial force with regard to drug addictions. We do not treat the\r\npatient's habit, but we treat the patient. He must be braced up, must\r\nbe made to understand that if he wants to quit the habit, no matter\r\nhow slavishly he is addicted to it, he can do so. He must be told of\r\nmen who had habits like his, often of longer duration and to a greater\r\ndegree, yet gave them up when firmly resolved and properly stimulated.\r\nIt is not hard to find such examples, since medical and even ordinary\r\nliterature abound with them and every physician's experience furnishes\r\nhim with instances. The first and {708} most absolutely necessary\r\npreliminary of the treatment is to lift up the patient in his own eyes\r\nand make him understand that, low as he has sunk, his case is not\r\nhopeless, that his degradation is not at all uncommon nor so rare as\r\nhe might think, and that men and women have succeeded in lifting\r\nthemselves out of conditions worse than his. The psychotherapeutist\r\nmust, above all, not be of those who insist that human nature is\r\ndegenerating and that people are much weaker physically and morally\r\nthan they used to be, though of course he must be thoroughly aware\r\nthat drug habits are more frequent than they were and are quite\r\nalarmingly on the increase. This is not due to any deterioration in\r\nhuman nature, however, but mainly to the excitement of modern life and\r\nits inevitable reaction, the strenuousness with which men now take\r\nexistence and the consequent craving for artificial relief from\r\nover-activity, and then, above all, the facility with which the\r\nhabit-forming drugs can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--This last point accounts for the frequency of drug\r\nhabits in our time more than anything else. Men have always been ready\r\nto do something for the sake of novelty and excitement. Everyone is\r\ncurious to experience for himself the effects produced by drugs that\r\ncan make people such slaves to them. We hear too often of the intense\r\npleasure that the drug habitue gets from his use of drugs. The\r\ncuriosity thus aroused constitutes the suggestion that has led many to\r\ntry the effect, confident that he or she would be able to resist any\r\ncraving just before it became seriously tyrannous. Psychiatrists agree\r\nthat one of the worst elements in modern social conditions is the\r\nimpression generally maintained that there is such intense pleasure in\r\nthe taking of drugs. A clear statement of the reality of the case is\r\neminently desirable. It is not positive pleasure that the drug habitue\r\nhas, but mere negative pleasure, as a rule. His \"dope\" does not so\r\nmuch add to his good feeling as take away the bad feelings that he has\r\nbecause of depression or ennui at the beginning and later because of\r\nthe craving for the drug.\r\n\r\nPhysicians to whom many drug habitues have told their experience\r\nfrankly are not at all inclined to think that the usually accepted\r\nopinion of pleasure in drug taking is true. It is not that it is\r\nheaven to have the drug so much as it is hell to be without it. The\r\npatient's system has learned to crave it so much because of the\r\nsurcease of painful consciousness of self it gives and this it is that\r\ncompels these unfortunates to go back to ever-increasing doses. The\r\npleasant side is a very dubious affair at all times, accompanies only\r\nthe earliest steps of the formation of the habit at most, and usually\r\nwhatever agreeable feelings there are are accompanied by such a\r\nnightmare of solicitude and anxiety as a background that the pleasure\r\nis more poignant than agreeable. As a prophylactic against the\r\nformation of drug habits this aspect of the experience of drug\r\nhabitues deserves to be emphasized and knowledge of it widely\r\ndiffused. Of course, the morphin fiend brightens up after his dose of\r\nmorphin, his eye lightens, his expression becomes happy, and his\r\nnerves get steadier, but that is only because the depression in which\r\nhe was sunk before has now been stimulated away, the struggle with his\r\nworst feelings is over and the consequent reaction has developed. Of\r\ncourse, the cocain-taker is pitiably helpless and downcast without his\r\n\"dope,\" but it is only by contrast with this previous state that his\r\nsucceeding condition can be said to be pleasant or agreeable, even to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n{709}\r\n\r\n_Favorable Suggestion_.--One of the most helpful sources of favorable\r\nsuggestion for these patients is to be found in the stories of cured\r\ndrug habitues. These may be used tactfully to bring confidence to\r\npatients that they, too, can be broken of their habit if they are\r\nwilling to take the pains to do so. De Quincey, taking his thousand\r\ndrops of laudanum a day, represents one of the most encouraging\r\nexamples of this since he succeeded eventually in breaking away from\r\nhis habit. Coleridge succeeded, also, in breaking his habit more than\r\nonce, but unfortunately returned again and again, and illustrates the\r\ndanger of the almost inevitable tendency to relapse, if the patient\r\npermits himself to think that now that he has once conquered the habit\r\nhe is too strong ever to let it get hold of him again. If he ventures\r\nto think complacently of his self-control and that consequently he may\r\nwith impunity--always for some good reason--take a dose or two of his\r\nfavorite drug in order to tide him over some crisis of mental worry or\r\nsome spell of physical pain, relapse is certain. The tendency of\r\npatients to fool themselves in this way is too well known to need\r\nspecial emphasis, but it is as well to say that there is scarcely a\r\nsingle cured case that does not relapse. The relapse is due not so\r\nmuch to craving for the drug, as to the memory of its previous effects\r\nin relieving discomfort and the unfortunate confidence that the\r\npatient has developed that now, knowing the dangers, he will be able\r\nto resist the formation of the habit before it gets a strong hold of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how even highly intelligent patients will slip back into\r\ntheir old habits, sometimes deeper than before, on this reasoning, in\r\nspite of the lessons of experience, even their own as well as others.\r\nLike the drunkard, they persuade themselves that just this once will\r\nnot count, and when it would have been comparatively easy for them to\r\nsay no they yield once or twice and make self-denial for the future\r\nincreasingly difficult. This is especially true if patients have the\r\ndrug near them, so that it is not difficult for them to have recourse\r\nto it. Hence doctors and nurses are not hard to cure of such habits,\r\nas a rule, provided they are away from their professional duties, but\r\nthey almost inevitably relapse when they go back to work. Every time\r\nthe relapse is due to the fact that tired feelings, because of\r\nirregular hours or some physical pain, prompt them to seek relief and\r\nthey yield to the temptation of taking the old drug, sure that they\r\nneed it, only for the moment. They will all assert that they could\r\njust as well resist as not, that, indeed, had not the drug been so\r\nhandy, they would not have taken it, and that if anyone had been near\r\nto help them by a word in the matter even then they would not have\r\nindulged in it.\r\n\r\nIf patients are to be kept from relapsing, all this must be set before\r\nthem frankly. After they have been told once or perhaps twice or\r\nperhaps many times and yet relapse into their habits, they must simply\r\nbe told it again a little more emphatically, more encouragingly, up to\r\nseventy times seven, if necessary. Patience is needed more than\r\nanything else in taking care of these cases. Over and over again their\r\nconfidence in their power to overcome their habit, if they really wish\r\nto do so, must be reawakened. Without this confidence in themselves\r\nsuccess is hopeless. It matters not how often they have relapsed, they\r\ncan still break off the habit, and if they will not fool themselves\r\ninto over-confidence in their power to keep away, they need never be\r\nslaves to the habit again. There will be quite as many disappointments\r\nin {710} treating drug addiction as in the treatment of alcoholism.\r\nThose who have most experience insist that there are even more, but\r\nthere are some wonderfully encouraging examples of men and women who\r\nhave broken from their habit, even after a number of bad relapses, and\r\nhave for many years lived absolutely without any of their drug and,\r\nthough still not over-confident in their power to resist if once they\r\nshould yield (such confidence, it cannot be repeated too often, is\r\nalways fatal), do actually keep away from the drug without any other\r\nbother than the necessity of living a regular hygienic life and\r\nexercising a little self-control.\r\n\r\nIn drug addictions as in alcoholisms, the question of sanitarium\r\ntreatment comes up in every case. Much more rarely than in the case of\r\nthe alcohol habit is it necessary to send a drug habitue to a\r\nsanitarium. Here once more, however, the patient's circumstances and\r\nthe possibility of diversion of mind with reasonable freedom from\r\ntemptations to take the drug and from ready access to it, are the most\r\nimportant considerations. If a patient really wants to break off the\r\nuse of a drug, it can be done gently and without much bother in the\r\ncourse of three or four weeks. I have seen cocain fiends who have\r\ntried many remedies and many physicians completely cured in five or\r\nsix weeks without serious trouble. The important thing is perseverance\r\nin the effort and in the treatment and the definite persuasion of the\r\npatient that it is not only perfectly possible to get rid of the\r\nhabit, but that it is even easy with good will on his part. If certain\r\nother milder stimulants are supplied for a time so that all the\r\nsymptoms due to the physiological effects of the excessive use of the\r\ndrug are minimized, the physical trial need not be severe. The\r\npatient's mind, however, must be occupied. Time must not be allowed to\r\nhang heavy on his hands and all physical symptoms must be treated\r\npromptly. Drug addictions are indeed more curable than alcoholism and\r\nthe danger of relapse is not quite so imminent. The social temptations\r\ndo not exist for drug habitues as they do for alcoholics. As I have\r\nsaid, however, in the cases of nurses and physicians almost a\r\ncorresponding state of affairs obtains and in them the danger of\r\nrelapse is great.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Treatment.--It is quite as important for drug victims as it is\r\nfor alcoholics that the case should be taken under treatment early.\r\nEvery physician knows how curiously easy it is for some people, indeed\r\nfor most people, to acquire a drug habit. I have seen one of the\r\nsolidest men I ever knew, with plenty of character that had been tried\r\nby many a crisis in life, recommended cocain for a toothache when he\r\nwas past fifty years of age and in the course of ten days acquire a\r\nthorough beginning of the cocain habit, so that he was taking several\r\ngrains a day. He had no idea that he was unconsciously slipping into a\r\ndrug habit. When the druggist refused any longer to supply the cocain\r\nsolution without a prescription he was quite indignant. It was not\r\nuntil he had forty-eight hours of nervous symptoms and craving that he\r\nrealized that he had created a need for stimulation of his nervous\r\nsystem by the mere taking of cocain by application on his gums. This\r\nhabit was broken up at once and there has never been any tendency to\r\nits recurrence. He had his warning, fortunately, without evil effects.\r\n\r\nIf the cocain habit can be formed as unconsciously as this, there\r\nshould be little difficulty in treating it. It is not a profound\r\nchange in the organism, but only a habit. It is not the habit itself\r\nthat is hard to break, but the effects {711} upon the nervous system\r\nof the patient are such as to create a series of symptoms that can\r\nonly be soothed by the drug. It is these symptoms of depression,\r\nirritation, sleeplessness, lack of appetite, constipation and the rest\r\nthat it is the physician's duty to treat in order to help the patient.\r\nThe patient breaks the habit by his will-power when properly persuaded\r\nand when it is made clear to him that it is neither so difficult as he\r\nthought, nor is he so likely to fail in the matter as he has imagined,\r\nand as has perhaps been suggested to him even by physicians. The\r\nmental treatment consists in making him realize that he can do it and\r\nthat if he wants to get rid of his habit he must do it for himself.\r\nWith this must come the assurance that every annoying symptom will be\r\nmet, that he need not recur to his favorite drug for this purpose,\r\nthat his appetite will be gradually restored and that, though perhaps\r\nfor a week he will have considerable inconvenience to bear, after that\r\nit will be plain sailing. Usually three days can be set as the term at\r\nwhich his craving ceases to be so disturbing as to make the\r\npossibility of his relapsing into the habit a positive danger. As in\r\nalcoholic and sex habits, the patient to be helped in breaking the\r\nhabit should be seen once a day at least, usually oftener. If he can\r\nbe made to understand that whenever the old tendency seems about to\r\nget the upper hand is the time to see his physician, and if something\r\nphysical as well as moral is done for him, the breaking of the habit\r\nis comparatively simple.\r\n\r\nThis method of treatment looks too simple to be quite credible to\r\nthose who have so often tried and failed in the cure of drug habits.\r\nIt is not the doctor, however, who fails, but the patient. We cannot\r\nput new wills into a patient, but we can so brace up even an old and\r\ntottering will as to make it possible for the worst victims of drug\r\nhabits to reform. The doctor, too, easily becomes discouraged. He has\r\nnot confidence enough in his own methods to make assurance doubly sure\r\nfor the patient as to his cure. This is what many of the pretended\r\nspecific purveyors of drug habit cures have as their principal stock\r\nin trade. They assure patients with absolute confidence, while the\r\nphysician only too often says the same thing, but half-heartedly. A\r\nhalf-hearted physician makes a hesitant patient, and success is then\r\nvery dubious from the beginning. Every patient can be cured. They may\r\nrelapse, but then they can be cured again. This is the essence of the\r\npsychotherapy of drug habits, but it is also the only successful\r\nelement in any treatment of the drug habit that is really effective.\r\nSpecifics come and go. Sure cures cease to have their effect. The only\r\nreally effective element in any cure is the absolute trust of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Drugs and the Drug Habit\" (Methuen, London) Dr. Harrington\r\nSainsbury, Senior Physician to the Royal Free Hospital of London, has\r\nemphasized all these points that can only be touched on very briefly\r\nhere. He has called particular attention to the fact that the victim\r\nof one drug habit is rather prone to acquire another if by any chance\r\nhe should once begin to take another habit-forming drug. The original\r\ndrug habit has broken down the will. It is not so much the craving for\r\na particular drug as the lack of will power that proves unfortunate\r\nfor the patient. He suggests \"incidentally, if this explanation hold\r\ngood, it proves the solidarity of the will that it works as a whole\r\nand not by compartments.\" He has dwelt on recoveries from the most\r\ndiscouraging depths and insists \"we must teach that {712} no one is\r\never so enslaved by a habit as to be incapable of relief--this alone\r\nis _right_ teaching, justifiable moreover by records well\r\nsubstantiated of recoveries from desperate plights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity and Unfavorable Suggestion.--As to the suggestion, sometimes\r\nencountered, of the influence of heredity and its all-powerful effect\r\nin making it practically impossible for the son of a man who has taken\r\ndrugs to keep from doing the same thing, we must recall very\r\nemphatically here the principles discussed elsewhere. So far as\r\nconcerns heredity, opium and the other drugs are exactly in the same\r\nposition as alcohol in their effect upon the human race. Instead of\r\nbeing justified in saying that by heredity individuals of succeeding\r\ngenerations are rendered more susceptible to them, just the opposite\r\nis true and, if anything, an immunity is produced. This is not only\r\nracial and general but is personal and actual. In recent years we have\r\ncome to realize that individuals born of tuberculous parents who care\r\nfor themselves properly are much better able to resist the invasion of\r\nthe tubercle bacilli than those who come from stocks that were never\r\naffected by the disease. They are the patients who, in spite of the\r\nfact that their disease reaches an advanced stage, sometimes live on\r\nfor years with proper care. Just this is true for drug addictions so\r\nfar as we know anything about it. The whole subject is as yet obscure,\r\nbut heredity rather favors than hurts the patient in these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereditary Resistance.--Instead of being discouraged by the fact that\r\nhis father took a drug to excess and that therefore he is weaker\r\nagainst this than other people, a man should rather be encouraged by\r\nthe thought that a certain amount of resistance to the craving has\r\nprobably been acquired by the particular line of cells through which\r\nhis personality is manifested. Dr. Archdall Reid has said that \"the\r\nfacts concerning opium are very similar\" (to those that concern\r\nalcohol). Then he continues:\r\n\r\n  That narcotic has been used extensively in India for several\r\n  centuries. It was introduced by the English into China about two\r\n  centuries ago. Quite recently the Chinese have taken it to Burma, to\r\n  various Polynesian Islands, and to Australia. There is no evidence\r\n  that the use of opium has caused any race to deteriorate. Indeed it\r\n  happens that the finest races in India are most addicted to its use.\r\n  According to the evidence given before the late Royal Commission on\r\n  Opium, the natives of India never or very rarely take it to excess.\r\n  When first introduced into China it was the cause of a large\r\n  mortality; but to-day most Chinamen, especially in the littoral\r\n  provinces, take it in great moderation. On the other hand. Burmans,\r\n  Polynesians and Australian natives take opium in such excess and\r\n  perish of it in such numbers that their European governors are\r\n  obliged to forbid the drug to them, though the use of it is\r\n  permitted to foreign immigrants to their countries. In exactly the\r\n  same way alcohol is forbidden to Australians and Red Indians in\r\n  places where It is permitted to white men.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter-Cures.--I have said so much about the after-cure of alcoholism\r\nthat applies directly to drug addictions also, that it does not seem\r\nnecessary to repeat it here. Patients must be warned that if they\r\nbecome overtired, if they lose sleep, if they are subject to much\r\nexcitement, if they put themselves in conditions of anxiety and worry,\r\nif any form of recurrent pain develops--headache, toothache,\r\nstomach-ache--they are likely to be tempted to take up their old\r\nhabit. If they are in a position where they can easily get the drug it\r\nis almost inevitable that something will happen to make them feel that\r\n{713} they are justified in taking one or two doses and from this to\r\nthe reestablishment of the habit is only a small step. Often these\r\npatients need a change of occupation. Some of them are over-occupied,\r\nsome of them have not enough to do. In either case it is the doctor's\r\nduty to know enough about his patient to be able to give directions.\r\nWe do not treat a drug addiction with the hope of curing it, but we\r\ntreat a patient suffering from a particular drug habit and we try so\r\nto modify that patient's life that after we have succeeded in getting\r\nhim away from his habit, which is never difficult, he will not relapse\r\ninto it. The after-cure is the more important of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSUICIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the gradual increase of comfort in life and its wide\r\ndiffusion--far beyond what people enjoyed in the past--there has been\r\na steady progressive increase in the number of suicides in recent\r\nyears. It is as if people found life less worth living the more of\r\nease and convenience there was in it. This increase in suicide is much\r\ngreater (over three times in the last twenty years) than the increase\r\nin the population. Surprising as it may seem, prosperity always brings\r\nan addition to the number of suicides. Stranger still, during hard\r\ntimes the number of suicides decreases to a noteworthy degree. It is\r\nnot those who are suffering most from physical conditions who most\r\nfrequently commit suicide. Our suicides come, as a rule, from among\r\nthe better-to-do classes of people. While suicide might seem to be\r\nquite beyond the province of the physician, it is a duty of the\r\npsychotherapeutist to prevent not only the further increase of\r\nsuicides in general but to save particular patients from themselves in\r\nthis matter. A careful study of the conditions as they exist,\r\nmoreover, will show that he can accomplish much--more than is usually\r\nthought--and that it is as much a professional obligation to do so as,\r\nby the application of hygienic precautions and regulations, to lessen\r\ndisease and suffering of all kinds and prevent death.\r\n\r\nThe same two modes of preventive influence that we have over disease\r\nin general can be applied to suicide. The physician can modify the\r\nmental attitude in individual cases and thus save people from\r\nthemselves and then he can, by his influence in various ways upon\r\npublic opinion, lessen the death rate from suicide. For this purpose,\r\njust as with regard to infectious disease, it is important for him to\r\nappreciate the social and individual conditions that predispose to\r\nsuicide, as well as the factors that are more directly causative. The\r\nmore he studies the more will he be convinced that what we have to do\r\nwith in suicide is a mental affliction not necessarily inevitable in\r\nits results and that may be much influenced by suggestion. Indeed,\r\nunfavorable suggestion is largely responsible for the increase in\r\nsuicide that has been seen in recent years. Favorable suggestion might\r\nbe made not only to stop the increase, but actually to reduce the\r\nsuicide rate. For this purpose it is important to know just what are\r\nthe conditions and motives that predispose to suicide and, above all,\r\nto realize that it is not the result of insufferable pain {714} or\r\nanguish, but rather of the concentration of mind on some comparatively\r\ntrivial ailment, or exaggeration of dread with regard to the\r\nconsequences of physical or moral ills.\r\n\r\nSuicides are often said to be irrational; in a certain sense they are.\r\nNo one who weighs reasonably all the consequences of his act will take\r\nhis own life. This irrationality, however, is nearly always functional\r\nand passing, not of the kind that makes the commission of suicide\r\ninevitable, but only produces a tendency to it. This tendency is\r\nemphasized by many conditions of mind and body that the physician can\r\nmodify very materially if he sets about it. Many of the supposed\r\nreasons for suicide are founded on the complete misunderstanding of\r\nthe significance of symptoms and dread of the future of his ailments,\r\noften quite unjustified by what the individual is actually suffering.\r\nIndeed, the desperation that leads to suicide is practically always\r\nthe result of a state of mind and not of a state of body. It is\r\nexactly the same sort of state of mind which sometimes proves so\r\ndiscouraging in the midst of diseases of various kinds as to make it\r\nimpossible for patients to get over their affections until a change is\r\nbrought about in their ideas. This makes clear the role of\r\npsychotherapy with regard to suicide, and there is no doubt that many\r\npeople on the verge of self-murder can be brought to a more rational\r\nview and then live happy, useful lives afterwards. For this purpose,\r\nhowever, it is important that the physician should come to be looked\r\nupon as a refuge by those to whom the thought of suicide has become an\r\nobsession.\r\n\r\nA well-known social religious organization not long since established\r\na suicide bureau, that is, a department to which those contemplating\r\nsuicide may apply with the idea that they would there find consolation\r\nand perhaps some relief for their troubles and thus the idea of\r\nsuicide might be dissipated. Many a suicide would be avoided if the\r\nreasons that impelled to it had been known to one or two other people\r\nbeforehand, so that some relief might have been afforded to what\r\nseemed an intolerable condition. This suicide bureau is said to have\r\ndone much good. There is no doubt that the mere act of giving one's\r\nconfidence to another is quite sufficient of itself to diminish to a\r\nmarked degree a burden of grief and trial. If anything in the world is\r\ntrue, it is that sorrows are halved by sharing them with another,\r\nwhile joys are correspondingly increased. The fact that there is\r\nsomeone to whom they might go, who would look sympathetically at their\r\nstate of mind, who would appreciate the conditions, who had been\r\naccustomed to dealing with such cases, would be enough to tempt many\r\npeople from that awful introspection and concentration of mind on\r\nthemselves which, more than their genuine sufferings and trials,\r\nwhatever they may be, make their situation intolerable.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a suicide bureau, however, in the office of\r\nevery physician who really appreciates the genuine responsibilities of\r\nhis profession. More than any others we have the opportunity to\r\nalleviate physical sufferings, to lessen mental anguish and to make\r\nwhat seemed unbearable ill at least more or less tolerable.\r\nUnfortunately in recent years the change in the position of the\r\nphysician in his relations to the family has somewhat obscured this\r\nfact in the minds of the public. The old family physician occupied to\r\nno slight extent the position of a father confessor, to whom all the\r\nfamily secrets were told, from whom indeed, as a rule, it was felt\r\nthat they should not be kept; to whom father went with regard to\r\nhimself and mother, to whom mother {715} went with regard to all the\r\nfamily as well as herself, to whom the boy confided some of his sex\r\ntrials and the girl some of the secrets that she hid from almost\r\neveryone else, so that to go to him for anything disturbing became the\r\nfirst thought. We must restore something of this old-fashioned idea of\r\nthe doctor's place in life if all our professional duties are to be\r\nproperly fulfilled. If those contemplating suicide learn to think of\r\nus as persons to be appealed to when all looks so black that life is\r\nno longer tolerable, we shall soon be in a position to confer\r\nincreased benefits on this generation that needs them so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Factors.--As a rule there is a physical element as the basis\r\nfor nearly all suicides. With the unfortunate, unfavorable suggestion\r\nthat has come from the supplying of details of pathological\r\ninformation--the half-knowledge of popular medical science--without\r\nthe proper antidote of the wonderful compensatory powers of the human\r\nbody for even serious ailments, a great many nervous people are\r\nharboring the idea that they have or soon will have an incurable\r\ndisease. Physicians have abundant evidence of this. All sorts of\r\neducated people come to us to be reassured that some trivial digestive\r\ndisturbance does not mean cancer of the stomach, or, when they are\r\nbetween forty and fifty, come to make sure that some slight\r\ndisturbance of urination is not an enlarged prostate. Brain workers of\r\nall classes come over and over again to be reassured that they are not\r\nbreaking down because of organic brain disease, of which they show\r\nabsolutely no sign. Sometimes they have been making themselves quite\r\nmiserable for a long period by such thoughts. It is easy to\r\nunderstand, then, how many less informed people, yet provided with the\r\nopportunities of quasi-information that modern life affords, are apt\r\nto think the worst about themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_So-called Insomnia_.--The correction of such preconceived notions\r\nwill always greatly alleviate the mental sufferings of these patients.\r\nFor this purpose there are many chapters of this book which point out\r\nhow various symptoms and syndromes that are often amongst the factors\r\nin the production of suicide may be managed. Perhaps one of the most\r\nfrequent of these is so-called insomnia. Most people are insomniac,\r\nmainly because they are overanxious about their sleep. A few of them\r\nare wakeful because of bad habits in the matter of work and the taking\r\nof air and exercise. Essential insomnia is extremely rare and\r\nsymptomatic; insomnia is not mental, but is usually due to some\r\ndefinite physical condition that can be found out and, as a rule,\r\ntreated successfully. There is always some other symptom besides loss\r\nof sleep. If men will live properly and rationally there is no reason\r\nwhy insomnia should be a bane of existence, nor even any reason why\r\nthe morphin or other drug habit should be formed which is so likely to\r\ncome if inability to sleep is treated as if it were an independent\r\nailment. In the forms in which it incites to suicide it owes its\r\norigin to a nervous superexcitement with regard to sleep in people\r\nwhose daily life in some way does not properly predispose them for the\r\ngreatest of blessings on which there is no patent right. Additional\r\nsuggestions as to these insomniac conditions are made in the chapters\r\non Insomnia and Some Troubles of Sleep which make it clear that\r\nsuicide, because of insomnia is due to a delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Headache_.--Persistent supposedly incurable headache is another\r\nprominent feature of the stories of suicides and here once more we\r\nhave to deal rather {716} with a delusion of over-attention of mind\r\nand concentration of self on a particular part than a real physical\r\nailment. Most of the so-called headaches that are supposed to be so\r\nintractable are really not headaches but pressure feelings and other\r\nqueer sensations in the head originally perhaps partaking of the\r\nnature of an ache but continued through over-advertence. Severe pain\r\nwithin the head occurs in cases of congestion and brain tumor, and\r\nwithout the head in cases of neuralgia, but most of these are only\r\ntemporary and long-continued headaches are rather neurotic than\r\nneuritic or due to any real disturbance of the nervous system. This is\r\ndiscussed in the chapter on Headaches. People commit suicide who have\r\nfor a long time been sufferers from headache because they fear that\r\nthey may go crazy. There is absolutely no reason in the world to think\r\nthis probable, and in the one case of continuance of severe\r\nintermittent headaches for years already mentioned--that of von Buelow,\r\nthe Austrian pianist and composer, in which we have the autopsy\r\nrecord--it was found, after a long life, that his severe intracranial\r\nheadaches were due to the pinching of a nerve in the dura and not to\r\nany organic change in the brain itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Factors.--While physical factors enter into the suicide problem\r\nto a marked degree, it would be a great mistake to think that physical\r\nconditions or material circumstances are the main causes or occasions\r\nin suicide. It is supposed, as a rule, to be due to depression\r\nproduced by incurable disease, oppressive weather, financial losses\r\nand the like. There is no doubt that these are contributing causes,\r\nbut the physical conditions have very little influence compared with\r\nthe attitude of the patient's mind toward himself. As a rule, it is\r\nnot those who are in absolutely hopeless conditions who turn to this\r\nsupposed refuge of a voluntary exit from life in order to get out of\r\ntrouble, but rather those who are momentarily discouraged and who have\r\nnot sufficient moral stamina to face the consequences of their acts.\r\nThere was a time when it was considered brave to fight a duel and\r\ncowardly to refuse to do so. Looking back now, we know that they were\r\nthe real brave men who dared to refuse when a barbarous civilization\r\nwould force them into a false position and who, in spite of disgrace,\r\nventured to be men and not fools. There are those who used to say that\r\nit was brave to take one's own life rather than bring disgrace on\r\nloved ones, but the mitigation, if there be any, of the disgrace that\r\nsuicide brings with it, comes from that lowest of all motives, pity\r\nfor the survivors, and the cowardly suicide leaves to others the\r\nthankless task of making up for his faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suicide and the Weather_.--An investigation of suicide records shows,\r\nas we have said, that it is not nearly so often bodily or material\r\nhardships that lead men to it as mental states. These mental states\r\nare not mental diseases, but passing discouragements in which men are\r\ntempted beyond their strength and do irretrievable things for which\r\nthere is no rational justification. It is not in dark damp weather\r\nthat men commit suicides most, though this was supposed to be a\r\ncommonplace in our knowledge of suicide. Recent investigations show\r\nthat quite the contrary is true. Professor Edwin T. Dexter of the\r\nUniversity of Illinois published a very important study of this\r\nquestion in a paper entitled \"Suicide and the Weather.\"   [Footnote\r\n55] He followed out the records of nearly 2,000 cases of suicide\r\nreported to the police in the City of New York {717} and placed beside\r\nthem the records of the weather bureau of the same city for the days\r\non which these suicides occurred. According to this, which represents\r\nthe realities of the situation, the tendency to suicide is highest in\r\nspring and summer and the deed is accomplished in the great majority\r\nof cases on the sunniest days of these seasons.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 55: _Popular Science Monthly_, April, 1901. ]\r\n\r\nHis conclusions are carefully drawn and there is no doubt that they\r\nmust be accepted as representing the actual facts. All the world feels\r\ndepressed on rainy days and in dark, cloudy weather, but suicides\r\nreact well, as a rule, against this physical depression, yet allow\r\ntheir mental depression to get the better of them on the finest days\r\nof the year. Prof. Dexter said:\r\n\r\n  The clear, dry days show the greatest number of suicides, and the\r\n  wet, partly cloudy days the least; and with differences too great to\r\n  be attributed to accident or chance. In fact there are thirty-one\r\n  per cent. more suicides on dry than on wet days, and twenty-one per\r\n  cent. more on clear days than on days that are partly cloudy.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus brought out with regard to the influence of weather can\r\nbe still more strikingly seen from the suicide statistics of various\r\nclimates. The suicide rate is not highest in the Torrid nor in the\r\nFrigid zones, but in the Temperate zones. In the North Temperate zone\r\nit is much more marked than in the South Temperate zone. Civilization\r\nand culture, diffused to a much greater extent in the North Temperate\r\nzone than in the South, seem to be the main reason for this\r\ndifference. We make people capable of feeling pain more poignantly,\r\nbut do not add to their power to stand trials nor train character by\r\nself-control to make the best of life under reasonably severe\r\nconditions. With this in mind it is not surprising to find that the\r\nleast suicides occur in the month of December, when the disagreeable\r\nchanges so common produce a healthy vital reaction, though the many\r\ndamp dark days that occur would usually be presumed to make this the\r\nmost likely time for suicides. On the contrary, it is the month of\r\nJune, the pleasantest in the North Temperate zone, that has the most\r\nsuicides. It is important to remember this in estimating the role of\r\nphysical influences on the tendency to suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Factors that Restrain Suicides.--_War_.--A most startling\r\nlimitation of suicide is brought about by war. For instance, our\r\nSpanish-American war reduced the death rate from suicide in this\r\ncountry over forty per cent. throughout the country and over fifty per\r\ncent. in Washington itself, where there was most excitement with\r\nregard to the war. This was true also during the Civil War. Our\r\nminimum annual death rate from suicide from 1805 (when statistics on\r\nthis subject began to be kept) was one suicide to about 24,000 people,\r\nwhich occurred in 1864 when our Civil War was in its severest phase.\r\nThere had been constant increase in our suicide rate every year until\r\nthe Civil War began, then there was a drop at once and this continued\r\nuntil the end of the war. In New York City the average rate of suicide\r\nfor the five years of the Civil War was nearly forty-five per cent.\r\nlower than the average for the five following years. In Massachusetts,\r\nwhere the statistics were gathered very carefully, the number of\r\nsuicides for the five-year period before 1860 was nearly twenty per\r\ncent. greater than for the five-year period immediately following,\r\nwhich represents the preliminary excitement over the war and the\r\nactual years of the war. This experience in America is only in\r\naccordance {718} with what happens everywhere. Mr. George Kennan in\r\nhis article on \"The Problems of Suicide\" (_McClure's Magazine_, June,\r\n1908), has a paragraph which brings this out very well. He says:\r\n\r\n  In Europe the restraining influence of war upon the suicidal impulse\r\n  is equally marked. The war between Austria and Italy in 1866\r\n  decreased the suicide rate for each country about fourteen per cent.\r\n  The Franco-German War of 1870-71 lowered the suicide rate of Saxony\r\n  8 per cent., that of Prussia 11.4 per cent. and that of France 18.7\r\n  per cent. The reduction was greatest in France, because the German\r\n  invasion of that country made the war excitement there much more\r\n  general and intense than it was in Saxony or Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Cataclysms_.--Even more interesting than the fact that war\r\nreduces the suicide rate is the further fact that a reduction of the\r\nnumber of suicides takes place after any severe cataclysm. The\r\nearthquake at San Francisco, for instance, had a very marked effect in\r\nthis way. Before the catastrophe suicides were occurring in that city\r\non an average of twelve a week. After the earthquake, when, if\r\nphysical sufferings had anything to do with suicide, it might be\r\nexpected that the self-murder rate would go up, there was so great a\r\nreduction that only three suicides were reported in two months. Some\r\nof this reduction was due to inadequate records, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that literally hundreds of lives were saved from suicide by the\r\nawful catastrophe that levelled the city. Men and women were homeless,\r\ndestitute, and exposed to every kind of hardship, yet because all\r\nthose around them were suffering in the same way, everyone seemed to\r\nbe reasonably satisfied. Evidently a comparison with the conditions in\r\nwhich others are has much to do with deciding the would-be suicide not\r\nto make away with himself, for by dwelling too much on his own state\r\nhe is prone to think that he is ever so much worse off than others.\r\n\r\n  If life were always vividly interesting, as it was in San Francisco\r\n  after the earthquake, and if all men worked and suffered together as\r\n  the San Franciscans did for a few weeks, suicide would not end ten\r\n  thousand American lives every year, as it does now.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual Restraints.--_Religion_.--It seems worth while to call to\r\nattention certain factors that modify the tendency to suicide and\r\nlimit it very distinctly, because it is with the limitation of it that\r\nthe physician must be mainly occupied. There seems to be no doubt that\r\ncertain religious beliefs, which affect the individual profoundly and\r\noccupy his thoughts very much, furnishing, both by tradition and\r\nheredity as it were, sources of consolation for evils in this life by\r\nthe thought of a future life, notably lessen the suicide rate. All\r\nover the world the Jews who cling to their old-time belief have\r\nperhaps the lowest suicide rate of any people. This is true in spite\r\nof racial differences. People who retain the confidence in prayer,\r\nthat used to characterize members of all religions a century or more\r\nago, are likely to be able to resist the temptation to suicide. This\r\nis true particularly for the more or less rational suicide. Oppenheim\r\nhas recalled attention to the power of prayer against depression and\r\nin the insane asylums of England its efficiency in this way is well\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that Roman Catholics the world over have much less\r\ntendency to suicide than their Protestant neighbors living in the same\r\n{719} communities. It is true that where the national suicide rate is\r\nhigh many Catholics also commit suicide, but there is a distinct\r\ndisproportion between them and their neighbors. The suicide rate of\r\nProtestants in the northern part of Ireland, as pointed by Mr. George\r\nKennan, is twice that of Roman Catholics in the southern part. He\r\ndiscusses certain factors that would seem to modify the breadth of the\r\nconclusion that might be drawn from this, but in the end he confesses\r\nthat their faith probably has much to do with it and that, above all,\r\nthe practice of confession must be considered as tending to lessen the\r\nsuicide rate materially. It is the securing of the confidence of these\r\npatients that seems the physician's best hope of helping them to\r\ncombat their impulse and Mr. Kennan's opinion is worth recalling for\r\ntherapeutic purposes:\r\n\r\n  In view of the fact that the suicide rate of the Protestant cantons\r\n  in Switzerland is nearly four times that of Catholic cantons, it\r\n  seems probable that Catholicism, as a form of religious belief, does\r\n  restrain the suicidal impulse. The efficient cause may be the\r\n  Catholic practice of confessing to priests, which probably gives\r\n  much encouragement and consolation to unhappy but devout believers\r\n  and thus induces many of them to struggle on in spite of misfortune\r\n  and depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disgrace as a Restraint_.--It is curious what far-fetched motives,\r\nthat appear quite unlikely to have any such influence, sometimes prove\r\nable to affect favorably would-be suicides and prevent their\r\nself-destruction. Plutarch tells the story, in his treatise on \"The\r\nVirtuous Actions of Women,\" of the well-authenticated instance of the\r\nyoung women of Milesia. Disappointed in love, they thought life not\r\nworth living. Accordingly there was an epidemic of suicide among the\r\nyoung women and it even became a sort of distinction to prefer death\r\nto matrimony. Some perverted sense of delicacy entered into the\r\nfeeling that prompted the suicides, as if sex and its indulgence were\r\nsomething belittling to the better part of their nature. The\r\nauthorities in Milesia must have been psychologists. They issued a\r\ndecree that the body of every young woman who committed suicide would\r\nbe exposed absolutely naked in the market-place for a number of days\r\nafter her death. This decree, once put into effect, immediately\r\nstopped the suicides. The young women shrank from this exposure of\r\ntheir bodies, even though it might be after death, and the suicide\r\nfashion came to an end.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought perhaps that this incident represented ancient\r\nfeeling and that a similar condition in the modern times would not\r\nhave a corresponding effect. It so happens that something similar has\r\nbeen tried. In some of the cities of South Central Europe in which the\r\nsuicide rate is almost the highest in the world, it was decided about\r\na generation ago by the Church authorities of the towns that suicides\r\nwould not thereafter be buried in the cemeteries near the bodies of\r\nthose who died in the regular course of nature, but must be interred\r\nin a separate portion reserved for themselves. Strange as it may seem,\r\njust as in the case of the young women of Milesia, this proved a great\r\ndeterrent to suicide. The suicide rate was reduced one-half the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it only takes some reasonably forceful\r\ncountervailing notion to set a train of suggestions at work that will\r\nprevent suicide. If those contemplating suicide are made acquainted\r\nwith some of these curious facts we know, then the notion of suicide\r\nloses more than half its terrible {720} attraction by being stripped\r\nof all of its supposed inevitableness. Almost any motive that attracts\r\nattention, even apparently so small a thing as disgrace after death,\r\nmakes these people realize the littleness and the cowardice of the\r\nact.\r\n\r\n\r\nFavoring Factors.--_Psychic Contagion_.--A prominent factor in\r\nsuicides that must constantly be borne in mind is the influence of\r\nexample or, as we have come to call it learnedly in recent years,\r\npsychic contagion. It is discussed more in detail in the chapter on\r\nPsychic Contagion, but its place here must be emphasized. It has often\r\nbeen noted that certain peculiar suicides are followed by others of\r\nthe same kind. If a special poison has been used, others obtain it and\r\nput an end to their lives in that way. Even such horrible modes of\r\ndeath as eroding the jugular vein by drawing the neck backward and\r\nforward across a barbed-wire fence have been imitated. If the story of\r\njumping off a high building is told with lurid details, special care\r\nhas to be taken in permitting unknown people to go up to the same\r\nplace for some time afterwards. The imitative tendency is evidently a\r\nstrong factor. Plutarch's story of the young women of Milesia brings\r\nthis out, and it has been noted all down the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn any discussion of the prophylaxis of suicide the effect of\r\nnewspaper descriptions of previous suicides must be looked upon as\r\nvery important. The influence of suggestion of this kind on people who\r\nhave been thinking for some time of suicide is very strong. There\r\ncomes to them the impelling thought that the suicide's miseries are\r\nover and they wish they were with him. From the wish to the resolve\r\nand then to the deed itself are only successive steps when suggestion\r\nis constantly prodding the unfortunate individual. If we are going to\r\nreduce the suicide rate materially or, indeed, keep it from increasing\r\nbeyond all bounds, this question must be squarely faced. Accounts of\r\nsuicides are not news in the ordinary sense of the word and while they\r\nmight find a place for legal and other purposes in a few lines of an\r\nobituary column, the present exploitation of them by the papers makes\r\nthem a constantly recurring source of strong suggestion to go and do\r\nlikewise. These suggestions come to persons already tottering on the\r\nedge of disequilibration in this matter, and it is like tempting\r\nchildren to do things that they know are wrong, but that look\r\nirresistibly inviting when presented under certain lights. The very\r\nfact that their death will produce a sensation and will give them so\r\nmuch space in the newspapers attracts many morbidly sensation-loving\r\npeople. Physicians must work as much for this prophylaxis as we have\r\nfor the prevention of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Suicides.--Probably the worst feature of the suicide statistics\r\nof recent times in all countries is the great increase of self-murder\r\namong children. Arthur MacDonald in discussing the \"Statistics of\r\nChild Suicide\"   [Footnote 56] has shown that there is a special\r\nincrease of young suicides everywhere. In France there are nearly five\r\ntimes as many suicides at the end of the nineteenth century as there\r\nwere at the beginning of it. In England there is almost as startling\r\nan increase. Though the statistics are not as well kept, child suicide\r\nhas increased not only in proportion to the increase of suicide among\r\nadults, but ever so much more. In Prussia the condition is even worse.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 56: \"Statistics of Child Suicide,\" _Transactions of American\r\n  Statistical Association_, Vol. X., pp. 1906-1907. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n{721}\r\n\r\nThe French child suicide rate is especially interesting and\r\ndisheartening. In the Paris Thesis for 1906 Dr. Moreau discusses the\r\nsubject of suicide among young people and shows how rapid has been the\r\ngrowth of the number of such suicides in the last 100 years. The first\r\nstatistics available for the purpose that, in his opinion, are exact\r\nenough to furnish a basis for scientific conclusions, are from 1836 to\r\n1840. Altogether during that period in France there were 92 suicides\r\nunder the age of seventeen years, 69 of whom were boys and 23 girls.\r\nIn 1895 this number had increased to such a degree that in a single\r\nyear there were almost as many suicides (90) as there had been in five\r\nyears, only fifty years before. In 1895 the proportion of suicides\r\nless than ten years of age was a little more than one in twenty of the\r\ntotal number of suicides in France. There are countries in Europe in\r\nwhich the suicide rate among such children is even higher than it is\r\nin France. In every country it has gone on increasing and the awful\r\nthing is that the suicide rate is increasing more rapidly among\r\nchildren than it is among adults, though among adults it doubles every\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes at Work_.--The causes for the increase in suicide among\r\nchildren were pointed out even by Esquirol, the great French\r\npsychiatrist, nearly a century ago. They are the same to-day, only\r\nemphasized by the conditions of our civilization. He attributed it to\r\na false education which emphasizes all the vicious side of life, makes\r\nworldly success the one object of life, does not properly prepare the\r\nchild for constancy in the midst of hardships, nor make it appreciate\r\nthat suffering is a precious heritage to the race, that has its reward\r\nin forming character and fixing purpose. He thought that there were\r\ntwo very serious factors for the increase of suicide among children\r\nnot usually realized. They were in his time literature and the\r\ntheater. He said: \"When the theater presents only the triumphs of\r\ncrime, the misfortunes of virtue, when the books that are in common\r\ncirculation because of the low price at which they are issued, contain\r\nonly declarations against religion, against family ties and duties\r\ntowards our neighbor and society, then they inspire a disdain of life\r\nand it is no wonder that suicide rapidly increases even among the very\r\nyoung.\" He was commenting on the case of a child of thirteen who had\r\nhanged himself, leaving this written message: \"I bequeath my soul to\r\nRousseau and my body to the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCowardice of Suicide.--Of course, the strongest motive for dissuasion\r\nfrom suicide is the utter cowardice of the act. As a rule, the man who\r\ncontemplates suicide is not a sufferer from inevitable natural causes,\r\nbut one who for some foolish act has put himself into what seems to\r\nhim an intolerable position out of which escape without disgrace is\r\nimpossible, and he is afraid to face the consequences of his own acts.\r\nIt is from the fear of mental worry and of the condemnation of others\r\nrather than from any dread of physical suffering and pain that men\r\ncommit suicide. The suicide leaves those who are nearest and dearest\r\nto him to face the battle of life alone, with all the handicaps that\r\nhave been created by their foolishness. Running away in battle is as\r\nnothing compared to the cowardice of the suicide. The deserter is\r\ndeservedly held in deepest dishonor, and if there is some little pity\r\nfor the suicide, it is because of the supreme foolishness of his act\r\nand the feeling that it only can have been dictated by some defect of\r\nmental equilibrium. A frank recognition of these conditions in their\r\nreal significance probably will do more than anything {722} else to\r\nmake the prospective suicide realize the true status of his act better\r\nthan anything else.\r\n\r\nMen sometimes seem to persuade themselves that it is a brave thing\r\nthus to face death. The shadowy terrors of what may come after death\r\nare too little realized to deter a man from his act when compared with\r\nthe real disgrace that he is so familiar with and that he has often\r\nwitnessed in actual life. It is the man, as a rule, who has most\r\ncondemned others when something has gone wrong, who has found no\r\nsympathy in his heart for the slips of his fellows, who discovers no\r\ncourage in himself when he has to face disgrace. He does not realize\r\nthat for most men there are so many extenuations of any evil that a\r\nman may do, that the large-minded man is ready to forgive and\r\neventually to forget almost anything that happens. \"To know all is to\r\nforgive all,\" and the more we know of men the readier we are to\r\nforgive them. Little men do not forgive and cannot forget the failings\r\nof their fellows and they think that everyone else looks upon men's\r\nfailings in the same way. It is only the small, narrow man who\r\ncontemplates suicide as a refuge from disgrace, and the fact that he\r\ncan complacently plan the abandonment of others not only to the\r\ndisgrace which he himself is not ready to face, but to all the\r\nsuffering consequent upon it, is the best proof of his littleness of\r\nsoul. The utter pusillanimity of suicide is the best mental antidote\r\nfor the temptation to it.\r\n\r\nBesides, the thought that deterred Hamlet may well be urged:\r\n\r\n                                          There's the rub;\r\n  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come.\r\n  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\r\n  Must give us pause;\r\n       . . . who would fardels bear,\r\n  To grunt and sweat under a weary life;\r\n  Cut that the dread of something after death.--\r\n  The undiscovered country, from whose bourn\r\n  No traveller returns.--puzzles the will;\r\n  And makes us rather bear those ills we have.\r\n  Than fly to others we know not of?\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that this is the argument of a coward, but such\r\ncowardice is as reasonable as the dread of touching a wire that may be\r\ncarrying a high charge of electricity. Besides it is only such an\r\nargument that will properly suit the man who, in his cowardice, is\r\nready to let others bear the brunt of his disgrace, flying from it\r\nhimself.  [Footnote 57]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 57: Is life worth living? How old this argument as to\r\n  suicide is can perhaps best be appreciated from the fact that it is\r\n  discussed very suggestively in a papyrus of the Middle Kingdom the\r\n  date of which is probably not later than 2500 B. C, which is now in\r\n  the Berlin Museum and is recognized to be the most ancient text of\r\n  its kind that has been preserved in the Nile Valley. I have referred\r\n  to this in the initial historical chapter. I think that I have more\r\n  than once turned men's thoughts from the serious contemplation of\r\n  suicide--always a dangerous thing--by discussing with them this\r\n  fact that men have at all times in the world's history argued just\r\n  the same way on these subjects. Men prefer not to resemble the dead\r\n  ones, and a motive is all that is needed. ]\r\n\r\nThere has sometimes been an erroneous tendency to confuse suicide and\r\nheroism, but Chesterton, in \"Orthodoxy,\"   [Footnote 58]\r\nhas well expressed the difference:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 58: \"Orthodoxy\" by Gilbert K. Chesterton, New York, John\r\n  Lane Co., 1909. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130]\r\n\r\n{723}\r\n\r\n  A soldier surrounded by enemies, if he is to cut his way out, needs\r\n  to combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness\r\n  about dying. He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a\r\n  coward, and will not escape. He must not merely wait for death, for\r\n  then he will be a suicide, and will not escape. He must seek his\r\n  life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life\r\n  like water and yet drink death like wine. No philosopher, I fancy,\r\n  has ever expressed this romantic riddle with adequate lucidity, and\r\n  I certainly have not done so. But Christianity has done more: it has\r\n  marked the limits of it in the awful graves of the suicide and the\r\n  hero, showing the distance between him who dies for a great cause\r\n  and him who dies for the sake of dying. And it has held up ever\r\n  since above the European lances the banner of the mystery of\r\n  chivalry: the Christian courage, which is a disdain of death; not\r\n  the Chinese courage, which is a disdain of life.\r\n\r\nThe feature of incidents in life that bring with them disgrace and\r\npunishment which needs to be insisted on for those to whom the thought\r\nof suicide comes, is that the sensation which the revelation of such\r\nacts causes is but a passing phase of present-day publicity, and that\r\nafter all it is not even a nine-days' wonder, but a two- or\r\nthree-days' wonder, and then it is forgotten and replaced by something\r\nelse. The facing of the condemnation for the moment may seem an\r\nextremely severe trial. The world's blame, however, is largely a\r\nbogey, a dread that is phantom-like and that disappears, or at least\r\ndiminishes, to a great degree as soon as it is bravely faced. Besides,\r\nas practically every man who has been carrying around a guilty secret\r\nwith him for years is free to confess, there is an immense sense of\r\nrelief once the worst is known. At last the effort at concealment, the\r\nnervous tension, the fear of the moment of exposure are all past and a\r\nnew set of thoughts can be allowed to come. Those may be unpleasant\r\nand yet they are not so bad as the dread of discovery that hung over\r\nthe unfortunate. If a man can be braced up to meet exposure, usually\r\nhe will find in a very few days that there are sources of consolation\r\nthat make it much easier for him to live than he thought possible\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\nReal Suffering a Tonic.--Probably the best remedy for a man or a woman\r\nwho talks of suicide and seems to fear lest the temptation should\r\novercome them is, if possible, to give them an opportunity to see some\r\nreal suffering. I have on a number of occasions had the opportunity to\r\nnote the effect on a discouraged man or woman of the sight of a cancer\r\npatient suffering severely, yet bearing the suffering patiently,\r\nwishing that the end might come, yet ready to wait until it shall come\r\nin the appointed order of nature. Suffering, like everything else,\r\nbecomes much more bearable with inurement to it. The old have learned\r\nthe lesson of not only not looking for pleasure in life, but of being\r\nquite satisfied with their lot if no pain comes to them, and they even\r\ngrow to consider that they have not much right to murmur if their pain\r\nis not too severe. It is not among those who have to suffer severe\r\npain that one finds suicides as a rule. It is true that young, strong,\r\nhealthy persons who suddenly find that pain is to be their lot for a\r\nprolonged period may grow so discouraged and moody over it as to take\r\ntheir lives. The patients that I have seen suffering from incurable\r\ndiseases have expressed no desire at all that their life should be\r\nshortened, except during the paroxysms of their pain, unless they feel\r\nthat they are a serious burden on others when they may express the\r\nwish to be no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuthanasia.--Every now and then there is a discussion in the\r\nnewspapers {724} of the justifiableness of euthanasia, that is, the\r\ngiving of a pleasant death to those who are known to be incurably ill\r\nand who are doomed to suffer pain for most of what is left of their\r\nexistence. The question usually discussed is whether patients have the\r\nright to shorten their own existence and then, also, whether their\r\nphysician might have the right or, even as some people say, the duty,\r\nto lessen human suffering by abbreviating existence for such incurable\r\ncases. The discussion has always seemed to me beside the realities of\r\nthings, because physicians do not see many patients, I might almost\r\nsay any patients, who really want to shorten their lives or would want\r\nto have them shortened. I have known many physicians die of cancer,\r\nbut very seldom is it that one tries to shorten his own existence, or\r\nthat even his best friend in the profession would consider that he was\r\njustified in doing this for him. This, it seems to me, should be the\r\ntest of the problem. It is true that not infrequently, in the midst of\r\ntheir paroxysms of pain, patients wish they were dead, but there come\r\nintervals of surcease from discomfort to some degree at least that\r\nmake life quite livable for a time again and even occasionally there\r\nis real happiness in these intervals, deep, human, natural happiness\r\nin heroic forbearance and example.\r\n\r\nWe can recall AEsop's fable of the old man who, gathering wood for the\r\nfire in the winter that he needed so much, finds the burden of his\r\nlabor and the wood too much for him and calls loudly for death to come\r\nto him. Promptly Death makes his appearance and asks what the old man\r\nwants. \"Oh! nothing,\" is the reply; \"only I would like you to help me\r\nto carry this bundle of sticks.\" This is the attitude of mind of\r\npractically all who have grown old in suffering. They have learned to\r\nbear with patience, and that patience gives even something of\r\nsatisfaction. After all, it is not so often the pleasant things in\r\nlife that we look back on and recall with most satisfaction as the\r\ndifficulties and trials. Virgil said long ago, _\"Forsan et hoc olim\r\nmeminisse juvabit\"_--perhaps at some future time we shall recall\r\nthese, our trials and pains, with pleasure. It is the conquering of\r\ndifficulty that means most for men and even the standing of pain is\r\nnot without an aftermath, if not of pleasure, at least of broad human\r\nsatisfaction. When we talk about euthanasia, then, it would be well to\r\nask some of these old people whether they want it or not. Seldom will\r\nthe answer be found to be that which is so often presumed, by those in\r\ngood health and strength, to be inevitable under such conditions.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have all seen incurable cancer patients who were\r\napproaching their end inevitably and with the fatal termination not\r\nfar off, have hours and days of alleviation of suffering and even of\r\nenjoyment that made up for the prolongation of life almost in the\r\nmidst of constant agony. The distinguished New York surgeon who had\r\nthe pleasure a few years ago of listening once more to his favorite\r\nsinger and fairly seemed to get renewed life from the inspiration of\r\nher voice and who for days after had the pleasant consciousness of\r\nsmooth running life in improvement so characteristic of convalescence,\r\nis a typical example of what may happen under such circumstances. I\r\nshall not soon forget Dr. Thomas Dunn English, the well-known author\r\nof \"Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,\" saying at an Alumni dinner of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, that, like Bismarck, he used to think that\r\nall the joys of life's existence were in the first eighty years of\r\nlife, but of late years he had found {725} that many of them were also\r\nin the second eighty years of life. He was at the time 83. He made the\r\nmost joyous and happiest speech on that occasion. He was quite blind,\r\nwas almost deaf, had been reported dying some months before, and had\r\ngone through prolonged suffering, yet he was by his cheeriness and\r\nwhole-hearted gaiety on that occasion a joy and inspiration to all the\r\nyounger men at the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nDread of Suicide.--There are patients who come to the physician worked\r\nup because they fear they may commit suicide. Every now and then the\r\nthought comes to them that some time or other they will perhaps throw\r\nthemselves out of a window, or be tempted to drop in front of a\r\npassing train, or over the side of a steamboat, or impulsively take\r\npoison. Some nervous people become quite disturbed by these thoughts.\r\nEvery physician is sure to have some patients who must be reassured,\r\nevery now and then, that they are not likely to commit suicide. Their\r\nnervousness over the fear of this may serve to make them supremely\r\nmiserable and it evidently becomes the doctor's duty to reassure them.\r\nIt is not difficult to do this, as a rule, provided the physician will\r\nbe absolutely confident and unhesitating in his declaration that there\r\nis no danger that they will commit suicide, since it has almost never\r\nbeen known that patients who dread it very much and, above all, those\r\nwho dread it so much that they take others into their confidence in\r\nthe matter, take their own lives. The very fact that the thought\r\nproduces so much horror and disturbance in them is the best proof that\r\nthey will not impulsively do anything irretrievable in this way.\r\n\r\nProf. Dubois has discussed this subject in his usual thoroughly\r\npractical way and his words serve as an authoritative confirmation of\r\nwhat has been already said, though as a matter of fact the expressions\r\nand experience of nearly every nervous specialist thoroughly justify\r\nthe position here assumed. Besides, it must be realized that this\r\nconfident assurance is the best possible prop that doubting patients\r\ncan have with regard to the actions they dread, and by positive\r\ndeclarations the physician will accomplish more than in any other way.\r\n\r\n  There are patients who are subject to strange obsessions. They are\r\n  afraid that they will throw themselves out of the door of a car, or\r\n  climb over the parapet of a bridge. They are afraid that they will\r\n  throw their relatives out of a window, or will wound somebody with a\r\n  knife or a gun. There are some with a strong impulse to open their\r\n  veins. But if there is a certain attraction in such things, it is\r\n  really a phobia. It tends to make one shrink back and not to act.\r\n\r\n  Nothing quiets these patients like the frequently repeated statement\r\n  that they will not do anything. It is necessary to show them the\r\n  vast distance there is between the impulse toward suicide and murder\r\n  and the phobia which, however distressing it may be, is a safeguard.\r\n  One must keep at this education of the mind with imperturbable\r\n  persistence and use the most forceful and convincing arguments that\r\n  one can think of to correct the judgment of his patient, in order to\r\n  make the strings of moral feeling and reason vibrate in unison.\r\n\r\n  It is through lack of courage and perseverance that we err in the\r\n  treatment of these psychoneuroses. We wait too long to distinguish\r\n  the morbid entities that bear on a certain etiology or a different\r\n  prognosis. We do not see clearly enough the bond which unites these\r\n  different affections.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to some physicians as though they would be assuming too\r\nmuch responsibility in giving patients such positive assurance that\r\ntheir dreads {726} will not be fulfilled, but as a matter of fact the\r\nexperience of physicians is quite sufficient to justify the confident\r\nstatements here suggested. It is true that occasionally a person who\r\nafterwards commits suicide talks the matter over and hints at the\r\npossibility of taking his own life. He does not, as a rule, speak of\r\nit with dread, however, but as one of the alluring solutions of his\r\ndifficulties that he sees ahead of him. He is much more likely to\r\nwrite a letter to his physician telling him that all his arrangements\r\nare made and that by the time this letter reaches him he will be\r\nalready dead. The prospective suicide is usually quite secretive about\r\nthis purpose, not only to friends, lest he should be prevented from\r\naccomplishing it, but even with his physician, in whom he has had\r\nabsolute confidence and to whom he has told practically everything\r\nelse. The patients who fear the possibility of committing suicide, who\r\ntell how much they dread the horror of it, and who rush to consult the\r\nphysician to help them against themselves, show by the very fact the\r\nunlikelihood of action on their part.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Physician and Suicide.--By mental influence, then, the physician\r\nmay lessen the tendency to suicide in the individual and in the\r\ncommunity. To do this is to save suffering and to help in the solution\r\nof one of the most serious social problems in modern times. It can\r\nonly be accomplished by a sympathetic attitude towards the whole\r\nsubject and a tactful understanding of each individual case. Every\r\neffort in the matter, however, is well worth while, for there is no\r\nmore hideous blot on our modern civilization than the startling\r\nincrease of suicide. It is particularly important to bring about\r\nimprovement in this regard among young suicides, and fortunately it is\r\nhere that the influence of the physician for good is likely to be most\r\nfelt. The saving of life is the noblest part of the mission of the\r\nphysician and nowhere, perhaps, can this be accomplished more\r\nsuccessfully than with regard to some of these patients whom a rash\r\nresolution, due to a momentary fit of depression and a sense of\r\nsuffering exaggerated out of all proportion to their actual pain, is\r\nhurrying out of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGRIEF\r\n\r\nGrieving would seem at first glance to be one of the conditions for\r\nwhich the physician, especially if the etymology of the name of his\r\nprofession be taken strictly, should not be called upon to minister,\r\nnor his remedies be expected to relieve. Grief is usually supposed to\r\nbe due to moral ills and, therefore, at most to come under the care of\r\nthe alienist, with the feeling that even he can accomplish very little\r\nfor what is an affective rather than a true mental disorder. There is\r\nno doubt at all, however, that grieving, especially in the excess that\r\nshows it to be pathological, is always associated with certain\r\nphysical and mental conditions for which the physician can accomplish\r\nmuch. Indeed more often than not the physical condition of the\r\ngrief-stricken person is a prominent factor in the production of the\r\nstate of feeling which causes grief to be exaggerated, while, on the\r\nother hand, this state of mind {727} itself reacts upon the physical\r\nbeing so as to make it more sluggish in all its functions, and as a\r\nconsequence a vicious circle of cause and effect is formed affecting\r\nunfavorably both the mental and physical conditions. It is when\r\npatients are run down in health that grief becomes extremely difficult\r\nor apparently impossible to bear and grief itself still further brings\r\nabout a deterioration of health that makes the mind's reactionary\r\npower against its gloomy feelings still weaker than they were.\r\n\r\nViewed in this way, grief is an ailment that should properly come to\r\nthe physician for treatment and with regard to which that important\r\nprinciple is eminently true that the physician cannot always cure, but\r\nhe can nearly always relieve, and he can always console his patients.\r\nOn the one hand, an improvement in the general health always make\r\ngrief easier to bear because it increases the resistive vitality of\r\nboth mind and body. On the other, any diversion of mind that lifts the\r\nburden of grief even to some degree, releases new stimuli and physical\r\npowers for the restoration of bodily function to the normal and this\r\nbrings about an immediate lessening of the depressive condition. In a\r\nword, for the vicious circle of unfavorable influences ever pushing\r\nthe victim farther into depression, a virtuous circle, in the Latin\r\nsense of the word virtue, meaning courage, favoring strength, must be\r\nformed, that brings about an immediate improvement in the patient's\r\nmental and physical well-being. This is not a pretty bit of theory but\r\nis the result of the experience of every physician who has ever taken\r\nseriously the problems of caring for the grief-stricken.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural and Pathological Grief.--It is, of course, not easy to\r\ndistinguish between grief that may be called morbid in the sense of a\r\nmelancholy, that is, more than natural--a true mental disease--and\r\nthat which represents only an affective state accompanied by\r\ndepression from which there will be complete reaction. A mother loses\r\na favorite, it may be an only son, and is plunged into grief. For\r\ndays, even weeks, she refuses to take any interest in life, she thinks\r\nmoodily about the awful affliction that has come to her and how blank\r\nthe future is, and she cannot be aroused to attend either to her own\r\naffairs or to the duties of life around her. Such a grief is, in many\r\ncases, not more than the normal depression incident to such a loss. If\r\nafter months, however, the mother still continues to refuse to take\r\ninterest in life and the things around her, especially if, besides,\r\nshe now talks of having been visited with this punishment because of\r\nsome unpardonable sin in her own life, or because the Deity has been\r\noffended beyond all hope of propitiation, then the case verges over\r\ninto one of true melancholy in which the mental depression is not\r\nmerely a symptom of a passing condition, but partakes of the nature of\r\na mental disease, or is the consequence of a profound neurotic\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that there is always the danger that\r\nexaggerated grief, as it seems for the moment to be, may be only the\r\nfirst symptom of a true melancholic condition. Only too often friends\r\nand physicians have been deceived by this. Some of the sad cases of\r\nself-destruction and a few cases of homicide and suicide have followed\r\na condition that seemed to be only abnormal grief for the loss of a\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiology.--The cause of exaggerated, prolonged grief is, in a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the cases, a melancholic tendency, that is,\r\na failure on the {728} part of the mind to react against depression.\r\nThe weakness of mind that predisposes to this may be inherent or\r\nacquired. Sometimes no special loss is needed to produce melancholia\r\nin susceptible individuals, while occasionally it is precipitated by\r\nsome misfortune, inasmuch as this is a mental disease, very little can\r\nbe done directly, and yet the patient can be helped and diversion of\r\nmind may bring a good measure of relief. More often, however, the\r\nreason for persistent grieving is that before the disturbing loss came\r\ninto the life of the individual there had been a serious deterioration\r\nin health. This was due to the conditions preceding the unfortunate\r\nevent. Wives sometimes have worn themselves out physically and\r\nmentally while nursing husbands, or mothers their children, and this\r\nhas produced a lack of physical force which prevents them from\r\nreacting with healthy mentality against the subsequent shock of loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis..--For the melancholic tendency prophylaxis cannot be\r\nspecial, but must be general. We cannot prevent people from suffering\r\nserious losses, but we can foresee the possibility of a loss proving\r\nvery depressing, and can, therefore, try to keep the individual in\r\nreasonably good physical condition. If this is done the subsequent\r\ndepression will be much less than it otherwise would be. Very often\r\nthere is little or no recognition of the fact that there is a definite\r\ntendency in some patients to too great an inclination toward\r\nmelancholic thoughts, and it is not until an exaggerated manifestation\r\nof it comes that the danger is realized. It is not easy to make\r\npatients realize the dangers, but where the physician talks with\r\nassurance and points out definite things to do in order to prevent\r\nserious developments, patients, or at least their friends, can be made\r\nto appreciate the dangers.\r\n\r\nThe best demonstration that I know of the value of work as a remedy\r\nfor grief is my experience with members of religious orders. For them,\r\nas a rule, there is no interruption in life no matter what the loss\r\nmay be. Their work goes on the day after the funeral just as before.\r\nThis is the most precious possible arrangement, time and occupation of\r\nmind are the two factors that will dull the edge of grief and while\r\nhumanly we may resent the consolation that is thus brought by such\r\nconventional things as the passage of time and humdrum occupations,\r\nthey represent nature's resources. Above all, patients must be given\r\nsomething to do and if that something concerns other suffering human\r\nbeings, there is every reason to expect relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment.--The most important element in the treatment of grief cases\r\nis to prevent physical running down as far as possible and to build up\r\nthe physical condition. Depression that comes to patients who have\r\nlost considerable weight, even though it may show some of the signs of\r\nmelancholia, is always hopeful. Where patients are twenty or thirty\r\npounds under weight the recovery of weight up to the normal condition\r\nwill often mean the relief of their depressed condition. The one hope\r\nlies in this physical improvement. Mental treatment by diversion of\r\nmind must, of course, be practiced. This does not mean getting the\r\npatients interested once more in trivial things, but to be successful\r\nit means arousing the deeper feelings of their nature. Above all, the\r\nsolace of tears will often save depressed and grieving persons from\r\nthemselves. An interest in the sufferings of other people that awaken\r\ntheir sympathy will do the most to end exaggerated grieving over their\r\nown loss. The self-centeredness of their grief is the principal reason\r\nfor its exaggeration. {729} It is because of overestimation of their\r\nown importance and of the importance of their loss that these people\r\nsuffer severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Motives of Consolation_.--The main resource of the physician who\r\nwould employ psychotherapy for the treatment of those who are grieving\r\nbeyond the limit of what is normal, is to supply motives by which they\r\ncan understand the real significance of their loss. Very often,\r\nespecially in young folks, there is no proper estimation of values in\r\nlife and no recognition of the fact that human life was evidently not\r\nmeant for happiness since that comes to but few, while suffering and\r\npartings are inevitable. They come to all, and apparently will always\r\ncontinue to do so. It is the young or, at least, those under middle\r\nage, who are most likely to be affected by exaggerated depression over\r\nlosses and disappointments. Older folks have grown more accustomed to\r\nsuch incidents. These patients must be made to see how many motives\r\nthere are to take their grief philosophically and while permitting\r\nthemselves the luxury of sorrow, not to let this interfere either with\r\ntheir physical condition or their mental state to such a degree as to\r\nprevent them from taking the proper interest in their duties in life.\r\n\r\nThe ethical motives that may be urged to keep people from grieving\r\nover-much are many, but there is sometimes the feeling in the\r\nphysician's mind that it is scarcely his business to emphasize them in\r\nany way. It is supposed that to the clergyman must be committed the\r\ntask of consoling people for losses in life. This has always seemed to\r\nme a serious mistake. As physicians we know how much the mind\r\ninfluences the body and since it is our duty to care for the body, we\r\nmust, above all and first of all, care for the mind as far as we can.\r\n_Mens sana in corpore sano_ is a very old motto and is usually taken\r\nonly in the sense that to have a healthy mind one must have a healthy\r\nbody. In its Latin form, however, it might very well also be taken to\r\nmean that to have a healthy body one must have a healthy mind. Since\r\ngrief has an untoward influence on the body, physicians are bound to\r\nlearn what to do for it in any and every possible way and to exercise\r\nevery faculty they have for its relief. This is all the more true\r\nbecause in recent years many persons have no regular religious\r\nattendant who would come to offer them consolation or to whom they\r\nwould go in their trouble. It is not at all with the idea of\r\ninfringing on the rights of the clergy or invading his territory that\r\nI would insist not only on the right of the medical man, but even his\r\nduty, to afford consolation to the mind as well as relief for the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Family Physician_.--In older times the family physician was a\r\nfriend of the family to whom people turned in all troubles where he\r\nmight possibly be of aid, with just as much confidence and as promptly\r\nas they did to their religious attendant. Unfortunately, in the\r\nprogress of medicine, though still more because of the social\r\nvicissitudes that have taken place in recent years, this relationship\r\nof the family physician has been largely diminished, but that\r\nconstitutes only one more reason why every physician, to whose\r\nattention the grief of a patient for any loss is presented as a cause\r\nof ill-health, should know all the means and be ready to employ them\r\nfor the amelioration of the condition. As a matter of fact, there is\r\noften a feeling on the part of patients that it is more or less the\r\nbusiness of the clergyman to afford consolation and that the\r\nperformance of his duty in this matter is somewhat conventional, not\r\n{730} as if he performed it less thoroughly because of this, but as if\r\nthe feeling of the routine practice detracted from its effectiveness.\r\nSome of the motives for consolation advanced by the clergyman, then,\r\nlose in significance, in some persons' minds at least, because of this\r\nfeeling, while motives presented by the physician rather gain in\r\nweight because of the impression that he is a thoroughly practical\r\nman, deeply interested in life's problems from a common-sense\r\nstandpoint, and who knows the motives for consolation because he has\r\nrealized that losses are inevitable, suffering unavoidable, and grief\r\nsure to come, though somehow we must learn to bear up bravely under\r\nlife as we find it.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have always done this in the past, but in more recent years\r\neither they have lost the habit, or have considered it unworthy of\r\ntheir profession, or else, perhaps, only too often they themselves\r\nhave had no motives to offer that might seem sources of consolation\r\nfor those in suffering and especially those who are grieved for the\r\nloss of friends. If life were a mere chance, if there were not an\r\nevident purpose in it, if, as Lord Kelvin insisted, science did not\r\ndemonstrate (not \"suggest\" but \"demonstrate\" is the word he used) the\r\nexistence of a Creator and a Providence, Who, while caring for the\r\nhuge concerns of the universe, can just as well employ Himself with\r\nthe little details of human life, then there would be some reason for\r\nphysicians thinking that their science kept them from seeking\r\nconsolation from the ordinary motives. Even if they occupy an advanced\r\nagnostic position, however, they may still find sources of consolation\r\nthat, if not so effective as those attached to the old beliefs, at\r\nleast will provide something for the forlorn to take hold of, that\r\nwill mitigate their grief and sense of loss and make the present and\r\nthe future look not all too blank.\r\n\r\nFew men have been so thoroughly agnostic as Prof. Huxley, yet on the\r\ndeath of his wife he found that some of the thoughts of the old\r\nbeliefs might prove a source of consolation. Huxley had loved his wife\r\nvery dearly and their separation by death meant very much. The epitaph\r\nthat he wrote for her sums up his doubts yet plucks out of them\r\nsomething to console, expressed in old Scriptural language:\r\n\r\n  And if there be no meeting past the grave.\r\n  If all is darkness, silence, yet 'tis rest.\r\n  Be not afraid, ye waiting hearts that weep.\r\n  For God still giveth His beloved sleep;\r\n  And if an endless sleep He wills, so best.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attitude Toward Death_.--The ordinary attitude of people toward death\r\nis a very curious one. Death is the one absolutely certain thing in\r\nlife after birth, yet most of us live our lives without much regard to\r\nit, and whenever it comes and under whatever circumstances, at\r\nwhatever age, it is always a shock to us. No matter how old people are\r\nit always comes a little before it is expected. When death comes it is\r\nalways a shock and all that can be said of it is what Hamlet resents\r\nwhen the commonplace consolations for the loss of his father, who also\r\nlost a father and so on all down the course of history, are offered to\r\nhim. Perhaps, however, as much the reason for his resentment was the\r\nperson who offered the consolation as the form of the consolation\r\nitself, which, after all, exhausts nearly all that we can say in this\r\nmatter for grief for near and dear ones:\r\n\r\n{731}\r\n\r\n  King.\r\n    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\r\n    To give these mourning duties to your father:\r\n    But, you must know, your father lost a father;\r\n    That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound\r\n    In filial obligation, for some term\r\n    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere\r\n    In obstinate condolement, is a course\r\n    Of impious stubbornness: 'tis unmanly grief:\r\n        . . . Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\r\n    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature.\r\n    To reason most absurd, whose common theme\r\n    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\r\n    From the first corse, till he that died to-day,\r\n    \"This must be so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death and Pain_.--One of the most effective consolations in our day\r\nfor all classes of people, quite apart from religious affiliations or\r\nbeliefs, is the sociological import of death and suffering in the\r\nworld. Life, without suffering and death in it, would be a riot of\r\nselfishness. Men, as a rule, would not care for others at all, the\r\nweak would go to the wall, the individuals who possess less efficiency\r\nthan others would simply have to make out as best they could, and bad\r\nas social conditions are now, they would be intolerably worse. As it\r\nis the young and strong and vigorous have very little of true\r\nsympathy. Nothing makes a man feel for others like having gone through\r\nsome suffering himself. On the other hand, nothing makes him feel the\r\nimpotence of struggling ceaselessly for vain success and the futile\r\nrewards of life than to lose near and dear friends whose share in that\r\nsuccess and joy over the rewards would constitute their only real\r\nvalue and justification. As a man grows older and has gone through\r\nsome of the sufferings and has had to bear the losses of life, he\r\nlearns more and more to feel for others, he is ready even to make\r\nsacrifices that others may not have to suffer as he has suffered, he\r\nhas charity for them for the sake of his own suffering and that of\r\nnear and dear ones, and things are much better than they could\r\npossibly be without suffering and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Therapy by Example_.--Many men have taken losses so seriously as to\r\nthink that life held no more for them, and have foolishly given up\r\ntheir occupations, yet have found that Time, the great healer, could\r\nwork his marvels in their case as well as in most others and that new\r\ninterests and, above all, their life work, could arouse them to a\r\nsense of duty and bring them back to the old routine of life. Dr.\r\nMumford, in his \"Sketch of Sir Astley Cooper,\" tells the story of how\r\neven that veteran surgeon gave up everything at the death of his wife\r\nand yet found, after a year of idleness, that he had to come back to\r\nthe old life again. Dr. Mumford says: \"Sir Astley Cooper was an\r\nemotional man. In 1827 his wife died, and the event prostrated him\r\nwith grief. He felt that all the interests of life were over for him.\r\nHe fell into an acute physical decline, sold his town house, threw up\r\nhis practice and other professional employments, and retired to his\r\ncountry place to pass his last days. Within a year of the sad event he\r\nhad returned to town, taken another house, resumed practice with\r\nincreased vigor, and married again. He was then sixty years old, he\r\nlived on until 1841, and died in his seventy-fourth year.\"\r\n\r\n{732}\r\n\r\nA typical example of how much a strong man whose diplomatic ability\r\nhad stamped him as one of the large men of his generation may yet be\r\nafflicted beyond measure by a loss of this kind is to be found in the\r\nlife of the second Lord Lytton. I have told it somewhat in detail in\r\nthe chapter on Periodic Depression. After the death of his boy Lord\r\nLytton, who for more than a week of anguish had watched unceasingly at\r\nthe death-bed of his dying son, came to the conclusion that God was\r\nnot in His world or, at least, that the arm of Providence was\r\nshortened if such (as it seemed to him) needless suffering was\r\npermitted. The boy had probably suffered much less than the bystanders\r\nthought and much less than he seemed to, for in these cases nearly\r\nalways there is a merciful deadening of the senses that to a great\r\nextent eliminates suffering, but Lord Lytton could not understand and\r\nrefused ever to look at life from the same standpoint afterwards. This\r\nis, of course, only what happens in many cases, but it represents an\r\nexaggeration of grief since death and suffering have always been in\r\nthe world and sometimes they will come to those near and dear to us,\r\nmuch as we may resent it.\r\n\r\nNeither profound intelligence nor the sympathetic genius of the poet\r\nor artist is sufficient to safeguard men against the severer forms of\r\ngriefs for loss. Louis, the distinguished French physician (to whom we\r\nin America are indebted so much as the Master of the Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia schools of diagnosis, and, above all, for his teaching of\r\nthe differentiation between typhoid and typhus fever), suffered so\r\nmuch from the loss of his son that he could scarcely be consoled.\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was so much affected by the death of his wife\r\nthat he put into her coffin the only manuscript copy of his poems that\r\nhe possessed. It is interesting to learn that some years later he had\r\nthe coffin exhumed and took out his manuscript at the urging of\r\nfriends, and published the poems. Many other examples of this kind\r\nmight be given, for exaggeration of grief affects all classes and\r\nconditions in life. They are practically always pathological, usually\r\non a basis of somewhat disturbed mentality, though often the real\r\nunderlying and predisposing condition is the physical exhaustion that\r\nhas preceded the loss and which makes patients unable to bear the\r\nstrain of it after weeks of care, solicitude, anxiety and neglect of\r\neating and sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDOUBTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years the attention of physicians has been called to the\r\nfact that many people are made profoundly miserable by an\r\nunconquerable tendency to doubt about nearly everything that has\r\nhappened to them, or is happening, or is about to happen. This is not\r\na new phenomenon, but introspection has emphasized it, leisure gives\r\nmore opportunity for it, and so physicians hear more of it now than\r\nthey did in the past. This doubting tendency sometimes makes serious\r\ninroads on the peace of mind of sufferers from it because they cannot\r\nmake up their minds to do things, even to take exercise, to eat as\r\n{733} they should in quantity or quality, and to share the ordinary\r\nlife around them sufficiently to get such diversion of mind as will\r\nkeep their physical functions normal. The state used to be described\r\nas a neurasthenia (nervous weakness), but in recent years has come\r\nbetter to be designated as in the class of psychasthenias (lack of\r\nmental energy). It is always a mental trouble in the sense that it is\r\ndifficult for these patients to make up their minds about things, yet\r\nit is not a mental disease in the ordinary sense of the term, and\r\nthese people are often eminently sane and thoroughly intellectual when\r\ntheir attention has been once profoundly attracted. They may even,\r\nunder favorable circumstances, be active and useful helpers in great\r\ncauses, yet there is always to be observed in them a certain\r\nnoteworthy difference in mentality from the normal. The physician can\r\ndo more for an affection of this kind than is usually thought, and he\r\nis probably the only one who can thoroughly appreciate and sympathize\r\nand, therefore, be helpful in the condition.\r\n\r\nSufferers are often laughed at by their friends and relatives and are\r\nlikely to be the subjects of at least a little ridicule if they take\r\ntheir troubles to their physician. As a matter of fact, however,\r\ndoubting is a typical case for psychotherapeutics and not only can\r\nmuch be done for its relief, but it can be kept from disturbing the\r\ngeneral health, which it is prone to do if neglected, and by mental\r\ndiscipline and acquired habits of self-control, the doubting habit may\r\nbe almost completely eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nExaggeration of Ordinary State of Mind.--The first thing absolutely\r\nnecessary to impress upon the minds of these victims of their own\r\ndoubts is that their condition is by no means unique, it is not even\r\nvery singular, but is only an exaggeration of that hesitancy and\r\ntendency to put off making decisions that practically every person\r\nfinds in a lifelong experience. This frame of mind is rather\r\ncultivated by education and by a large accumulation of knowledge. The\r\nless one knows the easier it is to come to decisions about difficult\r\nproblems and to form conclusions without hesitancy. The young man will\r\ndecide anything under the sun, and a few other things besides, almost\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation, and after but slight consideration.\r\nTwenty years later he looks back and wonders how he did it, and having\r\ndone it, how he succeeded in turning the practical conclusions to\r\nwhich he came to advantage. The scholar is eminently a doubter and a\r\nhesitater, and we recognize that he loses certain of the qualities\r\nthat would make him a practical man of affairs, though he gains so\r\nmuch more that broadens and deepens life's significance that there can\r\nbe no doubt about the value of his liberal education.\r\n\r\n\"Hamlet\" is just the story of one of these doubters and hesitaters. He\r\nsaw his duty clearly and that duty was imperative. In spite of\r\ncumulative evidence, however, he refused to go on to the performance\r\nof that duty, urging to himself now one and now another reason of\r\ndelay, until finally he wonders whether it would not be worth the\r\nwhile to take his own life, rather than try any longer to solve the\r\nproblems that lie around him demanding solution. When he finally does\r\nsomething, his hand is forced and circumstances have so arranged\r\nthemselves that instead of one clean-cut punishment for a great crime,\r\nthere is the tragedy that involves six lives, including his own. The\r\nplay seems to involve such exceptional characters and to be written\r\naround such an unusual set of circumstances that it might be thought\r\n{734} that it would prove uninteresting for men and women generally.\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, \"Hamlet\" is the most popular of\r\nShakespeare's plays and probably the most popular play, both for\r\nreaders and auditors, that was ever written. There are commentaries by\r\nthe hundred on it in nearly every modern language. Men have been more\r\ninterested in this figment of Shakespeare's imagination than in any\r\nman that ever lived. Caesar and Napoleon have not attracted so much\r\nattention. Only Homer and Dante have been perhaps more written about\r\nthan Hamlet.\r\n\r\nShakespeare has emphasized the condition of Hamlet by showing us an\r\neminently well educated man. His deep interest in literature, and\r\nespecially in dramatic literature and all that relates to the stage,\r\ncan be appreciated very readily from his speech to the players. No one\r\nbut a man of profound critical ability and deep intellectual interests\r\ncould have so summed up the actors' relation to the drama. Of course,\r\nthis is Shakespeare himself talking and unthinking people have said\r\nthat this was a purple patch fastened on the play because it gave the\r\nauthor an opportunity to express his views with regard to actors and\r\ntheir ways. Instead of that, it is of the very essence of the\r\ndevelopment of Hamlet's character and shows us the scholarly amateur\r\nwho knows so much about many things that he has become quite unable to\r\nmake up his mind about the practical problems that lie before him.\r\nJames Russell Lowell says that Shakespeare sent Hamlet to Wittenberg,\r\nthough Wittenberg was not founded until centuries after Hamlet\r\nexisted--and Shakespeare probably knew that very well--because\r\nWittenberg in Shakespeare's time, on account of its connection with\r\nLuther and the religious revolt in Germany, had the widespread repute\r\nof occupying men's minds with doubts about many of the things that had\r\nbeen deemed perfectly settled before, and its popular reputation\r\nserves to give an added hint as to the character of Hamlet as the\r\ndramatist saw it.\r\n\r\nOnce those who are perturbed by doubts learn that the reason for the\r\nuniversal human interest in Hamlet is that there is a large capacity\r\nfor doubt of self in every man and woman, that we all put off making\r\ndecisions whenever possible, sometimes refuse to open letters when\r\nthey come if we fear that they will contain some disturbing news, put\r\noff writing letters because we have to state ideas definitely,\r\napparently hope that the day and the night will bring us counsel and\r\nthat somehow the decision will be made for us without the trouble of\r\nmaking up our minds, then they lose their sense of discouragement over\r\ntheir condition and appreciate that they are suffering only from an\r\nexaggeration, probably temporary and quite eradicable, of a state of\r\nmind that comes to practically every human being.\r\n\r\nThis is the important thing, because on it can be founded the only\r\nreally hopeful therapy of the condition. Doubting is a habit that may\r\nbe increased by yielding to it, but that can be diminished to a very\r\ngreat extent by constant discipline, which refuses to permit doubts\r\nand hesitancy and bravely makes decisions, even though there may be\r\nthe feeling that they may prove to be wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtent of Affection.--If such discipline is not instituted, then the\r\nlengths to which the doubting hesitant habit may go are almost\r\nincredible. I have had patients tell me that they doubted about nearly\r\neverything in the past. A very dear friend once confided to me that it\r\nwas always a source of bother {735} to him that he was not quite sure\r\nwhether he was married or not. His marriage I knew had been a public\r\nceremonial, and he had led his bride down the aisle to the strains of\r\nthe \"Wedding March\" in quite conventional style, but he was hesitant\r\nof speech, especially under excitement, and he was not sure that he\r\nhad ever said \"I will\" to the question of the clergyman, for there was\r\na constriction at his throat at the moment and he could utter no\r\nsound. The absence of any audible sound from the groom is not so\r\nunusual as to attract attention and, of course, his intention and his\r\nbodily presence and everything else gave the assent without the\r\nnecessity for the word, but he could not get out of his mind the\r\nthought that possibly he was not married and at times it gave him\r\npoignant discomfort. He was a thoroughly intelligent man, a teacher\r\nand a writer, with no abnormalities that attracted attention, and his\r\ntendency to doubt was only known to very near friends who laughed at\r\nit and had no idea at all of the annoyance that it often gave its\r\nunfortunate victim.\r\n\r\nI have a clergyman friend who has had some serious scruples with\r\nregard to his ordination. He is a Catholic priest and at a certain\r\npart of the ceremonial of ordination it is considered necessary for\r\nthe candidate for orders to touch at the same moment the paten, the\r\nsmall metal plate on which the Host is placed, and the chalice. This\r\nclergyman is not sure that he had done this simultaneously. As a rule,\r\ngreat care is exercised in seeing that all the details of the\r\nordination ceremonies are carried out very exactly and as there are a\r\nnumber of attendants on the altar whose duty it is to see that the\r\nabsolutely necessary details are properly fulfilled, it is quite\r\nimprobable that any mistake in this matter was made. The young\r\nclergyman, however, had not made an act of conscious attention at the\r\nmoment when he was supposed to do this, and consequently he could not\r\nbe sure afterwards whether he had done it or not. He thought of it as\r\nthe very essence of his ordination and he feared that all his\r\nsubsequent acts as a clergyman might be impaired by this negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrivial Doubts.--It is not alone with regard to important things,\r\nhowever, that people may doubt and are disturbed by doubts, but with\r\nregard to every trivial thing in life, if they permit the habit to\r\ngrow on them. Doubting is, after all, one of the phobias, that is to\r\nsay, it is the fear that something may happen if the decision they\r\nmake is wrong, that causes people to hesitate so much. There is a\r\ntendency in all of us which, if undisciplined, may make us put off the\r\ndoing of things until the last moment. It is easy to resolve the night\r\nbefore that we will do certain things the next day, but when the next\r\nday comes we find excuses to put them off. I have already suggested as\r\na symptom that some people put off the opening of letters. There are\r\nprobably more who do this than anyone has any idea of. Delay in\r\nanswering letters is probably much more often due to hesitancy of\r\ndecision than to actual laziness. We doubt as to what we should say\r\nabout certain things, and we do not care to take the trouble of making\r\nup our minds, and we fear if we do make up our minds it may be wrong,\r\nso we adjourn the whole matter to another time and keep on adjourning\r\nit. Many people are quite ready to confess that they do not do things\r\nuntil they have to, though few are ready to acknowledge that it is due\r\nto hesitancy or doubting about themselves and their decisions.\r\n\r\n{736}\r\n\r\nOf course, the man who doubts whether he has locked the door of his\r\nhouse after he gets to bed can only satisfy himself by getting up and\r\nactually investigating the state of affairs. Then there is the man who\r\ndoubts whether he has locked his safe at the office. He may get his\r\ndoubts just as he reaches the foot of the elevator and then if he is\r\nwise he will go back and determine the matter. If he is wise with\r\nexperience he will also deliberately determine while he is there\r\nwhether the office window is closed and locked and will make a\r\nconscious act when he comes out as to the locking of the office door.\r\nIf he does not do all this he will have further doubts on the way up\r\ntown and at his home during the evening which will make the doing of\r\nanything else a matter of discomfort and he will spoil the restfulness\r\nof his after-dinner hours. Some men conquer their first doubt, make\r\ntheir way home only to be beset by so many doubts that at the end of\r\nan hour they go back to their office and determine whether the safe is\r\nlocked or not. Finding it locked they may forget to notice other\r\nthings about the office and then they will surely have doubts about\r\nthese, and they may have to go back again and see about them.\r\n\r\nThen there is the man who doubts whether he posted a letter or if he\r\ndid post it, who doubts whether it found its way down to the bottom of\r\nthe mail box, or whether it may not have caught on a projecting screw\r\nor bolt or some portion of the upper part of the box and so fail of\r\ncollection; he may go back several times to determine this. Doubts\r\nabout even more trivial matters than this, however, annoy some people.\r\nI have known widows on whom the responsibility of managing the\r\nfinancial affairs of the household had been thrown for the first time\r\nafter their husbands' death, who constantly doubted whether they could\r\nafford to spend this or that, though they were regularly saving money\r\nfrom their income. Over and over again they would have to go over all\r\ntheir recent expenditures to decide whether they could afford certain\r\nexpenses. Such little things as the sort of paper to use in their\r\ncorrespondence, the wages they paid their servants, the amount of\r\nwaste in the food in the household, all aroused in them doubts and set\r\nthem to calculating once more just what was the relation of their\r\nincome to expenditure, all to no purpose, for they would have the same\r\ndoubts the next week or month.\r\n\r\nThen there are people who doubt whether their friends really think\r\nanything of them. They think that though they treat them courteously\r\nthis may be only common politeness and they may really resent their\r\nwasting their time when they call on them. They hesitate to ask these\r\npeople to do things for them, though over and over again the friends\r\nmay have shown their willingness and, above all, by asking favors of\r\nthem in turn, may have shown that they were quite willing to put\r\nthemselves under obligations. They doubt about their charities. They\r\nwonder whether they may really not be doing more harm than good,\r\nthough they have investigated the cases or have had them investigated\r\nand the object of their charity may have been proved to be quite\r\ndeserving. They hesitate about the acquisition of new friends, and\r\ndoubt whether they should give them any confidence and whether the\r\nconfidences that they have received from them are not really baits.\r\nThis is, of course, a verging on suspicion as well as hesitancy and\r\ndoubt, but the stories of how these people try to conquer themselves,\r\nyet have to make decision after decision, each one requiring time and\r\na certain resolution of mind, are quite {737} pitiable. It gets worse\r\nrather than better unless a definite discipline of opposition and\r\ncontrol is organized.\r\n\r\nWhat ordinary people do habitually and easily and without any effort\r\nof mind, these people must waste time and mental energy over so that\r\nit is extremely difficult for them to accomplish anything. Training of\r\nmind, as of hand, consists in making certain actions so habitual that\r\nthey are accomplished quite automatically. If we have decided that we\r\nare to get up at a certain hour we get up at that hour and do not have\r\nto make up our minds about it again, though this is one of the actions\r\nin which we all have the most lapses and the most need of renewal of\r\nresolution and habit. We make up our mind what we are going to eat and\r\ngradually acquire the habit of eating a certain quantity and a certain\r\nvariety at meals and then we do not have to make up our minds about it\r\nevery time. We go out, to do whatever must be done in our occupation\r\nquite automatically and there is no need of wasting mental energy over\r\ndecisions about it. It is this that the doubter cannot do. He or she\r\ncalls every trifling act before the supreme court of last decision,\r\nthe bar of intellect, to decide whether it is worth while doing,\r\nwhether it is to be done or not, how it is to be done, and then there\r\nis a doubt whether after it is done it may not prove to be quite the\r\nwrong thing to have done. This adds so much to the friction of life\r\nthat all the surplus energy is used up in the settling of trivial\r\nmatters, and nothing worth while is accomplished.\r\n\r\nSir James Paget once expressed all the realities of the situation of\r\nmany of these people in a few terse phrases. It is probably the best\r\nexplanation of its kind that we have and it deserves to be in the\r\nnotebook and often before the mind of physicians who treat neurotic\r\npatients. Sir James said: \"The patient says 'She cannot'; her friends\r\nsay 'She will not'; the truth is she cannot will.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression, of course, applies to many other phases of so-called\r\nnervous disease besides doubting and especially to the psychasthenias.\r\nIt represents, indeed, the keynote of many of these puzzling\r\naffections. The fact that it was uttered more than half a century ago\r\nshows how much better these affections were understood two generations\r\nbefore ours than we are likely to think, and how well physicians then\r\ngot to the heart of them. From this to the re-education of will, that\r\nmental discipline and relearning of self-control which constitutes the\r\nessence of the treatment of them, is but a short step.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis.--_Serious Occupation_.--Of course, the real way out of\r\nthe trouble is to have to do certain important things that occupy the\r\nmind and require the doing of many other things as subsidiaries which\r\nmust be accomplished in order to carry out the greater resolution. Men\r\nwho have important affairs on their hands seldom are bothered by\r\ndoubts and hesitancy. Women who have not much to do make mountains out\r\nof the molehills of their little occupations and every trifle must be\r\nadjudged. The larger interests must be cultivated, the smaller ones\r\nmust be turned over to the automaton which every one of us can develop\r\nin our persons if we only set about it resolutely. Each thing that\r\ncomes up must be settled at once and action must replace\r\ncontemplation. The Hamlet in us all must be put down and resolution\r\nmust not be allowed to be sicklied over with the pale cast of thought.\r\nWe must do {738} things and not think about them too much. The\r\ndoubters can learn this lesson. They will never be entirely without\r\nhesitancy, but they can remove many of their difficulties, and live to\r\naccomplish much in spite of their make-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Treatment.--The physical treatment of the doubting state\r\nconsists, of course, in bringing the individual's physical condition\r\nas near as possible up to the normal. When the state occurs in people\r\nwho are under weight its betterment is rather easy. The special\r\nfeature of the physical condition that needs seeing to is an ample\r\nsupply of fresh air. People who live in ill-ventilated places, or who\r\ndo not get out into the air enough, are almost sure to suffer from the\r\ntendency to avoid the making of decisions. The man of decision usually\r\nis a vigorous outdoor-air individual. Even the perfectly healthy man\r\nwho has been in the house for some reason for days together gets into\r\na state of mind where the making of decisions becomes objectionable.\r\nHe wants to push things away from him. In individuals who already have\r\na natural tendency this way this is greatly exaggerated by\r\nconfinement. Arrangements must be made, therefore, that will ensure\r\ngetting out for some time, not once but twice every day. The regular\r\nmaking of decisions for this purpose is of itself a good mental\r\ndiscipline. It must not be omitted even for rain or snow, unless there\r\nare additional reasons of some kind. An abundance of fresh air in the\r\nsleeping-room is extremely important and must be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Treatment.--The mental treatment consists in diversion of mind.\r\nUsually the doubters have no interests that appeal to them deeply and\r\nin which they have to make prompt regular decisions. If possible,\r\nthese must be secured. They must form habits of doing things regularly\r\nand of making up their minds to do them, and then not have to repeat\r\nthe adjudication and resolution. In recent years people realize, quite\r\napart from its religious significance, the value of what older\r\nreligious writers called examination of conscience. Regularly before\r\nthey go to sleep these people must be told to call up what they have\r\ndone during the day and to note their faults in the matter of putting\r\noff doing things and making decisions slowly. They must, however, not\r\nonly realize their faults, but they must make up their mind to correct\r\nthem during the following day. They must not leave the arrangement of\r\nwhat they shall do next day to chance, but must decide just how and\r\nwhen they shall do things and then, as far as possible, keep to this\r\nprogram. The program must, of course, be sensible and considerate.\r\nThis preliminary arrangement can be made to mean much more than might\r\nbe thought. Some people thus learn to correct entirely their tendency\r\nto doubt whether they should do things or not and lessen greatly the\r\ndifficulties they have in making decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY AND WILL POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of science (meaning by that term knowledge with regard\r\nto physical nature in contradistinction to philosophy or the relation\r\nof nature to man) in modern times has brought about in some minds a\r\nhesitant, if {739} not frankly contradictory attitude towards the\r\nquestion of free will. There are many scientists who not only doubt\r\nthe existence of free will, but insist that there cannot be such a\r\nthing. For them, man like the animals is determined to do things from\r\nwithout rather than from within. The stronger motive compels him.\r\nThere may be a weighing in the balance of motives, but that is a\r\nquestion of intellect and not of will. It is true that the stronger\r\nmotive may be one that is less alluring to nature or to sense than\r\nsome of the others which clamor for a hearing, but it is eventually\r\nthe stronger motive that compels. A man may desire something that does\r\nnot belong to him very much, but the consciousness that it does not\r\nbelong to him and that to take things that do not belong to him is\r\nunworthy of him will override his covetousness and so he remains\r\nhonest if he has been trained to regard things that way. After all,\r\nthe old maxim, \"Honesty is the best policy,\" is founded on some such\r\nreasoning as this, since only one who is at heart dishonest would\r\nconsider men as swayed by the thought that to be honest is the most\r\nprofitable, instead of being the right, and therefore the only proper\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThe argument for free will that appeals to most men is the\r\nconsciousness that we are free and that at any given moment we can do\r\na thing or not do it, just as suits us. If two things are presented\r\nto us we can do that one which seems right to us to do, or we can do\r\nboth of them, or we can permit ourselves to be led into the wrong,\r\nthough always acknowledging to ourselves that it is the wrong and\r\nfeeling downcast, or at least disturbed, that we should let ourselves\r\nbe led away from higher motives. Even in this case the determinist\r\ninsists that we are determined from without by motives due to our\r\ntraining, to our education along certain lines with the influence of\r\nthe environment in which we live, to the special sentiment that we\r\nhave within us as a consequence of the influences of preceding life.\r\nSuch determination, however, does not come from without us, but from\r\nwithin. It is the result of the formation of our wills in a particular\r\ndirection. The argument is, therefore, a begging of the question. A\r\nman may have formed the habit of doing evil things and then finds it\r\neasy to do them without compunction. On the other hand, the exercise\r\nof his will in doing what he considers right, in spite of the fact\r\nthat it may not be pleasant at the moment, is a training of the will\r\nfounded on its essential freedom. There is an essential distinction\r\nbetween right and wrong, and we have it in our power, as many a man\r\nhas done, to follow the right even though it costs our life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBad Temper.--A typical example of supposed determinism, which proves\r\nexactly the opposite of what is sometimes urged, may be noted with\r\nregard to exhibitions of temper. As Clouston declares in his\r\n\"Unsoundness of Mind\" (Methuen, London, 1911), \"an uncontrollable\r\ntemper is in many cases very like and nearly allied to an unsoundness\r\nof mind. It is certain that bad temper may gradually pass into\r\ntechnical insanity and that a considerable number of persons who are\r\npassing or have passed into insanity exhibit as the most marked\r\nsymptom morbidness and violence of temper. 'It's just temper. Doctor,'\r\nis one of the most common remarks that I have heard made to me by\r\npatients' friends. I think that it is quite certain that in most cases\r\nmuch might be done in youth to establish a reasonable control over\r\ntemper where it is inclined to be uncontrolled, so preventing serious\r\ndiscomforts in life both to its possessor and to others. In many cases\r\nI am satisfied that {740} this education would have the effect of\r\npreventing unsoundness of mind also, arising out of uncontrolled\r\ntemper.\" There are many examples in the literature of hagiology\r\nparticularly, from which it is clear that men have learned to control\r\neven violent tempers and by self-discipline and training in\r\nself-control have even become rather quiet, gentle individuals. The\r\ntruth of such examples is attested too well to be discredited. This\r\nquestion of training, then, is extremely important.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the consciousness of freedom to which an\r\nappeal is made in this argument for free will is shared with us by the\r\ninsane even in the performance of many acts that we know are compelled\r\nin certain ways. Insane persons reason themselves into a peculiar\r\nstate of mind, in which they represent to themselves that they have\r\nbeen persecuted, for instance, by a particular person and then they\r\nbecome persecutors in turn and do harm. As they see their act, it is\r\noften a species of self-defense. They themselves have no\r\nconsciousness, or, at most, a very dim and hazy realization of the\r\ninner compulsion to which they are subjected at the time of the act\r\nand sometimes talk quite rationally and discuss the motives which\r\nimpelled them to do things, just as if they were free. We recognize,\r\nhowever, the distinction between this delusion of the insane and the\r\nrational state of mind of the sane. We have no definition for\r\ninsanity, that is, no formula of words, which will absolutely include\r\nall the insane and at the same time exclude all the sane, but we have\r\na practical working knowledge that enables us to judge rather well\r\nbetween those who are compelled to do things by delusions, and those\r\nwho do them from motives that are rationally weighed and that\r\ninfluence a will that is free to follow them as it pleases. We hold\r\nthe rational man responsible for his acts because he knows he was free\r\nnot to do them. We punish him partly because he should not have done\r\nthem and partly because we want him not to do them again, and we know\r\nthat punishment will help him to keep from committing crime, because\r\nit will support his free will against his inclinations, when the time\r\nof trial comes again.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we are conscious of our own responsibility. We know that\r\nwhen we do wrong we are worthy of blame. We know that when we allow\r\ncovetousness to lead us into the appropriation of what does not belong\r\nto us we are deserving of punishment, because we need not have done\r\nit, but we yielded to unworthy motives. We know that while anger may\r\nbe blind we can control it, at least those of us who are fully in\r\npossession of our intellectual and voluntary powers, so as to keep\r\nfrom doing violence, even in the heat of it. This dealing with\r\nourselves is the best proof that we have of our recognition of our\r\nfreedom of will. We are responsible, and what we genuinely do not will\r\nto do is not accomplished. Our will may be bent by many attractions,\r\nbut we know that these motives are not compelling unless we allow them\r\nto be. When a child tells us that he did something because he could\r\nnot help it, we either feel sorry for him because he is not yet in\r\npossession of his full faculties or else we laugh at this excuse.\r\nThere is a tendency to admit this excuse as having a meaning, but only\r\nby those who themselves come into court with hands assoiled in some\r\nway and who are looking for pardon from others for offenses, and who,\r\nabove all, want to feel that they can pardon, or at least excuse,\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have seriously impaired the idea of responsibility\r\nin {741} the minds of the general public by a foolishly sentimental\r\nmercifulness to criminals. If a man under indictment for murder can\r\nshow that he has ever previously in his life acted even slightly\r\nirrationally, or if he has been peculiar in certain ways, provided, of\r\ncourse, he has money enough to pay for the opinions, there will be an\r\nabundance of expert testimony to declare that he is irresponsible and\r\nshould not be punished. As a consequence, in many cases justice fails.\r\nWe are reaping the harvest of this pseudo-scientific invasion of law.\r\nHuman life is cheaper in no country in the world than it is in\r\nAmerica. Our murder rate is going up by leaps and bounds, while that\r\nof Canada remains almost stationary, and the reason is that while nine\r\nout of ten of all our murderers do not receive the death penalty and\r\nmany of them escape serious punishment of any kind, nearly as large a\r\nproportion of Canadian murderers are punished by death. A man may have\r\nhis responsibility somewhat impaired and yet retain sufficient free\r\nwill so that he deserves to be punished for serious crimes. It is hard\r\nto decide in certain cases, but in most cases the decision is not\r\ndifficult if, with the right sense of justice, morbid sentimentality\r\nis put aside.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59, the following lengthy citation  is from an article on\r\n    \"Responsibility and Punishment,\" in the _American Journal of\r\n    Medical Science_, 1909.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  While the doctrine of free will is so clear it is still true that\r\n  the question of responsibility for actions, and above all for\r\n  criminal actions, is not so simple as many people used to proclaim\r\n  it in the past. No two men are free to perform an act or not to\r\n  perform it in quite the same way. Familiar examples are ready to\r\n  hand: One man finds no difficulty at all in resisting the\r\n  inclination to take spirituous liquor to excess; another finds it a\r\n  most difficult feat, often apparently impossible for him to refrain\r\n  from indulging to excess almost whenever the opportunity offers, or\r\n  at least whenever he gets a taste of liquor. This difference between\r\n  the two men is founded in their very nature. It would be utterly a\r\n  mistake to praise the one for his abstinence or to blame the other\r\n  under certain circumstances for his indulgence. Between these two\r\n  classes there are others quite different individually. Some of them\r\n  have a slight tendency, and, fearing the worst, do not indulge in\r\n  it; some of them have a marked tendency which they are able to\r\n  resist under most circumstances without very much difficulty once\r\n  they have made up their minds; some are sorely tempted, fall\r\n  occasionally, yet never become habitual drunkards. For each of these\r\n  men there is a different responsibility, and so far as they are to\r\n  be punished a different punishment must be meted out, for it is our\r\n  effort in the modern time to make the punishment fit the criminal\r\n  and not the crime.\r\n\r\n  This same thing holds true for many other forms of crime. Some men\r\n  readily lose sight of the distinction between mine and thine, and\r\n  possess themselves of their neighbors' goods almost without\r\n  realizing that they have done wrong. They are rare, and we have been\r\n  accustomed to call these people kleptomaniacs. Between these and the\r\n  man who hesitates to steal, even when starving or for his starving\r\n  children, there are many degrees of inclination and disinclination\r\n  toward stealing. The same thing is true to a more noteworthy degree\r\n  with regard to anger. Anger, the old saw says, is a brief madness.\r\n  In America we say very frankly that a man who is very angry is mad.\r\n  In this brief madness he may be led to do things which he would not\r\n  do at all in his sober senses. Some men easily get into one of these\r\n  awful fits of anger in which their responsibility is lessened, while\r\n  others have a calm phlegmatic disposition from which they are\r\n  scarcely aroused even by the worst forms of abuse or injury, or even\r\n  physical suffering.\r\n\r\n  It is evident in all these cases that in order to measure how much\r\n  of punishment ought to be meted out for acts committed it is more\r\n  necessary to know the individual than his act. This often becomes an\r\n  extremely difficult matter, for {742} after the commission of crime\r\n  every effort is made to make out as little responsibility as\r\n  possible for the criminal. The easiest way to do this has been to\r\n  use the insanity plea. As already stated, we have no definition of\r\n  insanity. It is easy to understand then that there will be a\r\n  disagreement among physicians as to who is or is not insane, and the\r\n  result is almost sure to create doubt which tends to obscure the\r\n  principles on which are based the proper punishment of crime. Now\r\n  this system is founded on certain wrong principles as regards the\r\n  administration of Justice. While it is difficult to decide with\r\n  regard to a man's insanity or sanity, it is not difficult to decide\r\n  with regard to his punishment when the ordinary purposes of\r\n  punishment are kept well in view.\r\n\r\n  The old idea of punishment used to be that of revenge. A man had\r\n  done a wrong, and what would ordinarily be held a wrong had to be\r\n  done to him in order that the scales of Justice should be maintained\r\n  level. At the present time we have no such idea at all. Punishment\r\n  has two main purposes--the prevention of further disturbance of\r\n  social order by the particular criminal, and the deterrence of\r\n  others from like acts. If a man takes away the life of another we do\r\n  not take away his because thus Justice will be obtained, but we take\r\n  it away to prevent him from ever doing anything of the same kind\r\n  again. A man who has committed murder is more likely to do it again\r\n  than another. He has committed one breach of social order; we shall\r\n  prevent him forever from committing another of the same kind. This\r\n  is the very best deterrent to such crimes that there is. It will be\r\n  said, of course, that these men could not refrain from doing their\r\n  acts. It is doubtful, however, whether this contention is true in\r\n  the great majority of cases, and the proper punishment of such as\r\n  occur furnishes the best possible motive to help others from the\r\n  commission of like acts.\r\n\r\n  This holds true for children at a time when their sense of\r\n  responsibility for their acts is as yet undeveloped. They can be\r\n  taught, even very early in life, by properly applied punishment,\r\n  that need not be severe, that they must not do certain things, and\r\n  then they will not do them, or at least, will do them much less.\r\n  This is true not only for perfectly rational children, but also for\r\n  those that are to some degree irrational. Punishment is of great\r\n  importance in the training of children of low grade intelligence,\r\n  and there is scarcely any child, however wanting it may be in\r\n  intellect, that cannot be disciplined into conduct that makes it\r\n  much less bothersome than would ordinarily be the case. This is well\r\n  known and it is also well known that the attempt to manage such\r\n  children without punishment would be extremely difficult, not to say\r\n  impossible. They do not reason about the thing, they are not quite\r\n  responsible for their acts; but they do connect punishment with what\r\n  they have done, and are in many cases deterred from doing it again,\r\n  especially while they realize that authority is near them and that\r\n  punishment is inevitable. These are the principles on which the\r\n  adjudication of punishment for crime must be measured. There is\r\n  nothing else that can be done if society would preserve itself and\r\n  its members from those who are irresponsible even in minor degrees.\r\n\r\n  In this matter practical experience is well worth the while. The\r\n  lower order of creatures, the animals, we do not consider\r\n  responsible for their acts in the same way as human beings. We know\r\n  the value, however, of punishment in deterring them. A dog, for\r\n  instance, by being whipped a few times when he is young, can be\r\n  taught not to steal things to eat, and taught that there is an\r\n  inevitable connection between the taking of such things and the\r\n  infliction of such punishment. I shall not soon forget my first\r\n  lesson in philosophy from a dear old professor, who, talking of the\r\n  memory of animals, demonstrated that they had a memory, from the\r\n  ordinary experience of mankind with regard to them. \"If a cat does\r\n  something naughty in your room,\" he said, \"you rub its nose in it,\r\n  and it will not do it again.\" The cat had no idea that it was doing\r\n  wrong. According to its way of life it was not doing wrong. It\r\n  learned, however, from sensory experience that it must not do this\r\n  sort of thing under special circumstances, and after the lesson has\r\n  been once thoroughly learned there is no more trouble of this kind.\r\n\r\n  Individuals who are of less mental stability than normal require,\r\n  indeed, more careful discipline than average men. The rational may\r\n  be managed by sweet reasonableness. The defective child must be made\r\n  to realize that certain actions {743} will surely be followed by\r\n  painful punishment, though, of course, the main purpose of modern\r\n  care for such children is to watch over them so diligently as to\r\n  prevent them getting into mischief. This is after all what we do\r\n  with the animals, and we realize the necessity for it. Defective\r\n  human beings approach the animal in their lessened power to resist\r\n  impulses, and they must be treated in the same way. If we were to\r\n  save the animals in an excess of tenderness toward them, because we\r\n  held to the notion either that they did not know any better or else\r\n  could not resist their impulses, and then permitted them to do\r\n  things without punishment, we should either have to get rid of\r\n  animals entirely, or else life would be one continuous readjustment\r\n  of things to animal ways. Since defectives occur in the general\r\n  population, it must be realized that far from being less rigid with\r\n  them in the matter of meting out punishment for things they do that\r\n  are harmful to others, we must be even more strict with them.\r\n  Otherwise, we will have to take the bitter consequences of our own\r\n  foolishness.\r\n\r\n  It does not make so much difference if the thoroughly rational\r\n  individual occasionally escapes punishment for something done, but\r\n  whenever the subrational escapes, he is encouraged to do it again.\r\n  More than that, the example of his punishment is needed for others.\r\n  So far as possible, punishment must inevitably follow crime in the\r\n  world, in order to impress the subrational and deter them from\r\n  yielding to impulses. Far from being less deserving of punishment in\r\n  every sense in which a modern penologist cares to inflict\r\n  punishment, these individuals are more impressed by it, and, above\r\n  all, need to be more impressed by it. When the subrational know that\r\n  they can do things without being severely punished for them, they\r\n  will always abuse that state of affairs. The thoroughly rational man\r\n  may be depended on to do his duty as a rule without the need of\r\n  punishment hanging over him. This is not true for the others, and\r\n  hence the greater increase in crime, and above all in murder, which\r\n  has made human life cheaper in this than in any other country in the\r\n  world, as the direct consequence of recent abuses in our penal\r\n  system.\r\n\r\n  It has become very clear now that in recent years we have come to\r\n  take entirely too lenient a view in these matters, and that many\r\n  criminals who deserved to be punished, both because in this way they\r\n  would be prevented from future crime and others deterred by the\r\n  knowledge of their punishment, have been allowed to escape Justice.\r\n  The tendency is toward too great mercifulness, which spoils the\r\n  character of the nation, just as leniency to the developing child\r\n  spoils individual character. Men may very well be insane, in the\r\n  broad meaning of that term, in the sense that they have done\r\n  irrational things, but then there is almost no one who has not. The\r\n  responsibility of most men for a definite action is quite clear in\r\n  the sense that if they are punished they will not do it again, or\r\n  will be less likely to do it again, while if they are not punished\r\n  their escape becomes a suggestion to themselves and to others to\r\n  repeat such acts. It is for the subrational that we most need to\r\n  insist on punishment. The cunning of the insane is proverbial, and\r\n  this extends also to the subrational, and many of these folk realize\r\n  that their difference from others, their queerness, as their folks\r\n  call it, is quite enough to make a verdict of insanity in their case\r\n  assured with the present lax enforcement of law. If the present\r\n  state of affairs continues in this matter, we are simply allowing\r\n  ourselves to be led by the nose by these cunning people into the\r\n  perpetuation of a state of affairs in which they may do what they\r\n  like because we have become foolishly oversensitive in the matter of\r\n  inflicting punishment.\r\n\r\n  On the principle that punishment deters, a man who has killed\r\n  another man, even under conditions that seriously impaired his\r\n  responsibility for the act and with evidence of previous lowered\r\n  mentality, must never again be free to live the ordinary life of\r\n  men. He must be under surveillance, and should be confined for life\r\n  in an institution for the criminally insane. For the subrational\r\n  such a sentence, if known to be inevitable, would usually be more\r\n  deterrent than even imprisonment in an ordinary prison for life with\r\n  all the possibilities for freedom which are presented by executive\r\n  clemency, pardoning boards, and the like. It is absurd to say that a\r\n  man may have such an attack of mental unsoundness as will lead him\r\n  to do so serious an act as taking away human life, and then be\r\n  expected to get over his mental condition so as not to be likely to\r\n  do the same thing again. {744} Every alienist knows that this is not\r\n  true. Such acts, when really due to mental instability, occur either\r\n  in depressed or maniacal conditions, and these, as is now well known\r\n  from carefully collected statistics, inevitably recur, or in\r\n  weakened toxic conditions in susceptible subjects, and a return to\r\n  the old mode of life may at any time bring recurrences.\r\n\r\nIt is in the treatment of disorders of the will of various kinds that\r\nthe physician is brought to realize how much harm is done by the\r\nteaching that determinism and not free will rules life. It is true\r\nthat we often find cases in which men and women cannot use their wills\r\nor at least seem not to be able to use them. They are lacking in some\r\nessential quality of human mentality. We find many human beings,\r\nhowever, doing things that are harmful for them and that are so\r\ninveterated by habit that it is extremely difficult to get away from\r\nthem. In every case the sane person can conquer and break the habit,\r\nno matter how much of a hold it may have obtained.\r\n\r\nWe have heard much of the born criminal and of the degenerate and his\r\ninevitable tendencies, but most of the theories founded on this phase\r\nof criminal anthropology have gradually been given up as a consequence\r\nof more careful and, above all, more detailed observation. Many\r\ncriminals bear the stigmata of so-called degeneration. Many of them\r\nhave irregular heads, uneven ears, some fastened directly to the cheek\r\nand some with the animal peak, many have misshapen mouths and noses,\r\nbut, on the other hand, many people having these physical qualities\r\nare good men and women, perfectly capable of self-control, honest,\r\nefficient members of society, and it is evident that the original\r\nobservations were founded too exclusively on the criminal classes,\r\ninstead of on the whole population. It is important, then, to get away\r\nfrom the notion of irresponsibility in these cases.\r\n\r\nWhile men are free, yet each in a different way and the freedom of\r\ntheir wills is as individual as their countenances, it must not be\r\nforgotten that the freedom of the will is a function of the human\r\nbeing, and, like all other functions, can be increased or decreased by\r\nexercise or the lack of it. The old idea of \"breaking the will\" was as\r\nmuch of a mistake as that other old-fashioned notion contemporary with\r\nit of \"hardening\" children by exposing them to inclement weather and\r\nsevere physical trials. The will may be strengthened, however, by the\r\nexercise of it and if not exercised it may not be expected, by\r\nanalogy, at least, to be as weak and flabby as muscles would be under\r\nsimilar circumstances. The training of the will by self-denial and\r\nself-control is extremely important. When there is an hereditary\r\ninfluence, a family trait and not merely an acquired character, by\r\nwhich the will rather easily passes out of control, there is all the\r\nmore need for the training of it in early youth. Without such training\r\nmen may find it impossible to make up their minds to deny themselves\r\nindulgence of many kinds, but this is not because they have not free\r\nwill, but because this function has never been exercised sufficiently\r\nto enable them to use it properly. A man who attempts to do gymnastic\r\nfeats without training comes a cropper. A man who is placed in\r\ncircumstances requiring hard muscle exertion will fail if his muscles\r\nhave not been trained to bear it. The same thing will happen with the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this training of the will has been neglected to a\r\nconsiderable extent in modern education, and, above all, in modern\r\nfamilies, where the presence of but one or two children concentrates\r\nattention on them, {745} over-stimulating them when young, leading to\r\nself-centeredness and, above all, discouraging self-denial in any way\r\nand preventing that development of thorough self-control which comes\r\nin the well-regulated large family. Besides, unfortunately it is just\r\nthe neurotic individuals who most need thorough training in\r\nself-control and whose parents suffer from the same nervous condition\r\n(for, while disease is not inherited, defects are inherited), that are\r\ndeprived of such regular training in self-control because of the\r\ninability of their parents to regulate either themselves or others\r\nproperly. Here is the secret of the more frequent development of\r\nneurotic symptoms in recent years. It is not so much the strenuous\r\nlife as the lack of training of the will so that the faculty of free\r\nwill can be used properly. Lacking this, hysterical symptoms,\r\nunethical tendencies, lack of self-control become easily manifest. The\r\ntraining that would prevent these should come early in life, and when\r\nit does not it is very difficult to make up for it later. Just as far\r\nas possible, however, it is the duty of the psychotherapeutist to\r\nsupply by suggestions as to training and discipline for the education\r\nof the will that has unfortunately been missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n{746}\r\n\r\nSECTION XX\r\n\r\n_PSYCHOTHERAPY IN SURGERY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY IN OLD-TIME SURGERY\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgery, a name derived from chirurgy--handwork--might seem to be\r\ndependent almost entirely on mechanical and technical skill, yet there\r\nhas always been the conviction that the patient's attitude of mind\r\ntowards an operation is almost as important a factor in the success of\r\nsurgery as the surgeon's skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstrology in Surgery.--From the earliest history of surgery we, find\r\nthat astrology was mainly employed in order to determine what days\r\nwere likely to be favorable, and what unfavorable, for the practice of\r\nsuch surgical procedures as were in vogue at that time. Certain\r\nconjunctions of the planets were declared to be particularly\r\nunfavorable, and some of them, indeed, were declared almost absolutely\r\nfatal; others were said to be especially favorable. As astronomical\r\nand anatomical knowledge grew, more and more details were added in\r\nthis matter. Definite portions of the body were supposed to be under\r\nthe occult influence of certain constellations. It was only with\r\ncareful reference to these constellations then that surgical\r\nprocedures or, indeed, the application of remedies of any kind, might\r\nbe undertaken. All remember the picture in old almanacs of a man with\r\nthe signs of the zodiac around him, and the indications that referred\r\ncertain of these signs and the corresponding constellations to the\r\ndifferent parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venesection and the Stars_.--When venesection became a frequently\r\nused remedy, the question of the favorable and unfavorable influence\r\nof the stars was an important element in it. In old Babylonia, noted\r\nfor its knowledge of astronomy, which was then called astrology\r\nwithout any of our derogatory meaning in the word, certain positions\r\nof the planets were absolute contraindications for the performance of\r\nvenesection. Indeed, astrology often furnished the best possible\r\nexcuses for the failure of what were thought to be absolutely specific\r\nremedies. When the remedies did not succeed, their failure was\r\nattributed to their being taken at unfavorable times and not to the\r\nremedies themselves. These astrological ideas continued to influence\r\nmedicine, and, above all, surgery, down almost to our own time.\r\nGalileo and Kepler made horoscopes, and Mesmer wrote a thesis on the\r\ninfluence of the stars on human constitutions. In fact, very few\r\nimportant patients of the seventeenth and even eighteenth centuries\r\nwere treated medically or surgically without due reference to the\r\nstars at the time. All this had a profound influence on {747} the\r\npatient's mind. He felt that every precaution was being taken to\r\npreclude the possibility of failure and assure favorable results, and\r\nhe, therefore, submitted to the operation absolutely confident that so\r\nfar as human knowledge could go, everything was favorably disposed in\r\nhis regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Influence in Old Hospitals.--It is rather interesting to\r\nrealize how much the history of medicine illustrates the profound\r\nattention that was given in the old times to the question of the\r\noccupation of patients' minds as an eminently helpful factor in the\r\ntreatment of disease and, above all, in convalescence. In the great\r\nhealth resorts, the temple hospitals like that at Epidaurus, or even\r\nthe city hospital, the AEsculapeum at Athens, the question of\r\nrecreation of mind was evidently considered very important. At Athens,\r\nthe two city theaters, the larger one seating perhaps 50,000, and the\r\nsmaller, Odeon, were not far from the hospital. At Epidaurus, a\r\ntheater seating probably 12,000, in which the great Greek classic\r\nplays were given; a Stadium, seating nearly 10,000, in which athletic\r\ncontests were conducted, and a Hippodrome, seating 6,000, in which\r\nanimal performances might be witnessed, were all in connection with\r\nthe temple hospital. Outdoor sleeping apartments were provided; that\r\nis, the patients slept under a colonnade, and, in general, the mental\r\nand physical hygiene of modern times was thoroughly anticipated. All\r\nof this was considered particularly important for convalescents.\r\nPatients were occupied, while in bed, with various interests. Just as\r\nsoon as they could be moved, their minds were occupied with all sorts\r\nof interests external to themselves, and especially such as had the\r\nreadiest appeal to humanity. (See bird's-eye view, facing p. 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMedieval Hospitals and the Mind.--It is not difficult to trace the\r\ndevelopment of similar conditions in the hospitals of the Middle Ages.\r\nWhile we are inclined to think of these older hospitals as surely\r\nlacking in everything that we have developed in our modern hospitals,\r\nthey prove, on the contrary, to have anticipated most of our hospital\r\nimprovements. They were of single story construction, with large\r\nwindows high up in the wall so that there could be no drafts, with a\r\nbalcony on which patients could sit in the sun, with arrangements for\r\nprocuring privacy rather easily by means of sliding partitions, with\r\ntiled floors, and, above all, with pictures on the walls, some of them\r\nthe products of the brush of the great artists of the old time and\r\nwhich would serve to occupy patients' minds. Probably nothing is worse\r\nfor patients who are convalescing from illness or operation than to be\r\nleft to their own thoughts. Often they must not be talked to overmuch,\r\nor permitted the exertion of conversation or of reading, yet they must\r\nhave some occupation of mind. The frescoes painted directly on the\r\nwalls of the old hospitals were eminently psychotherapeutic in this\r\nrespect, and we shall probably have to imitate them. Besides, the\r\npatients had the opportunity every morning to hear Mass, which was\r\nsaid at an altar at an end of the ward, and certain religious\r\nexercises were conducted by the sister nurses each afternoon. How much\r\nof consolation this was to believing patients at a time when all were\r\nbelievers is rather easy to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedieval Surgeons and Mental Influence.--Some of the insistence on\r\nthis favorable state of mind for operations during the Middle Ages is\r\nextremely interesting. One of the great surgeons of the fourteenth\r\ncentury was Mondeville, whose text-book has recently been published in\r\nboth France and {748} Germany. I have translated in \"Old-time Makers\r\nof Medicine\"   [Footnote 60] some of his emphatic expressions, which\r\nshow how important he deemed it to keep the patient in as favorable a\r\nstate of mind as possible before and after operations. He went so far\r\nas to suggest that someone should be deliberately called in to tell\r\nhim jokes. He said, \"Let the surgeon take care to regulate the whole\r\nregimen of the patient's life for joy and happiness by promising that\r\nhe will soon be well, by allowing his relatives and special friends to\r\ncheer him, and by having someone to tell him jokes, and let him be\r\nsolaced also by music on the viol or psaltery. The surgeon must forbid\r\nanger, hatred, and sadness in the patient, and remind him that the\r\nbody grows fat from joy and thin from sadness. He must insist on the\r\npatient obeying him faithfully in all things.\" He repeats with\r\napproval the expression of Avicenna that \"often the confidence of the\r\npatient in his physician does more for the cure of his disease than\r\nthe physician with all his remedies.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 60: Fordham University Press, 1911.]\r\n\r\nMondeville was but one of the great surgeons of the medieval period\r\nwho dwelt on this. It would not be hard to find corresponding\r\nexpressions in the books of such men as Guy de Chauliac, Hugh of\r\nLucca, Theodoric, or even earlier among the great Arabian physicians\r\nand surgeons. Rhazes, for instance, declared that \"physicians ought to\r\nconsole their patients even if the signs of impending death seem to be\r\npresent, for the bodies of men are dependent on their spirits.\" He\r\nconsidered that the most valuable thing for the physician to do was to\r\nincrease the patient's natural vitality. Hence his advice: \"In\r\ntreating a patient, let your first thought be to strengthen his\r\nnatural vitality. If you strengthen that, you remove ever so many ills\r\nwithout more ado. If you weaken it, however, by the remedies that you\r\nuse, you always work harm.\" Another of his aphorisms seems worth while\r\nquoting: \"The patient who consults a great many physicians is likely\r\nto have a very confused state of mind.\" For him a confused state of\r\nmind evidently meant a lessened tendency to recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical Lesions Influenced.--The King's touch in England, which so\r\noften proved beneficial for scrofulous patients, illustrates very well\r\nhow much strong mental influence may avail even in cases where surgery\r\nseems surely indicated. Many cases of epilepsy were also greatly\r\nbenefited by the King's touch, and, indeed, in this matter there are\r\nprobably many more cases of the cure of epilepsy, or at least relief\r\nof the worst symptoms of the affection, reported as following the\r\nKing's touch than after operation in the modern time. In both sets of\r\ncases we are now confident that the good effects produced came through\r\nthe minds of the patients. When, during the eighteenth century,\r\nMesmerism began to attract attention, investigators and experimenters\r\non the subject were able to show that many pains and aches could be\r\ngreatly benefited by psychic treatment. The painful conditions\r\nfollowing fractures and sprains proved to be particularly amenable to\r\nmental influence exerted in this special way. As we approach the\r\nmodern time, there comes to be a definite recognition of the fact that\r\nthe mind may produce many pains and aches which seem due to purely\r\nphysical conditions that might be expected to yield only to physical\r\ntreatment. A corresponding recognition of the power of the mind to\r\nlessen and even suppress actual physical pain is almost a corrollary\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n{749}\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie declared, as I have quoted in the section on\r\n\"Diseases of the Muscular and Articular System\" that a large\r\nproportion of the painful joint conditions that he saw among his\r\nbetter-to-do patients were of the hysterical or neurotic type. Sir\r\nJames Paget thought this expression of Brodie an exaggeration, but\r\nacknowledged that one-fifth to one-fourth of all his cases in both\r\nhospital and private practice were due to hysteria. In those days most\r\nof the painful conditions were considered to belong rather to surgery\r\nthan to medicine, so that these opinions represent very well the\r\npractice of medicine in these cases during the early nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century great practical surgeons, and especially\r\nthose who have taught us how to treat individual patients rather than\r\ntheir diseases--for it is quite as true in surgery as in medicine that\r\nthe patient is more than his disease--have made distinct contributions\r\nto the department of psychotherapy in surgery. Dr. Hilton's great book\r\non \"Rest and Pain\" is full of psychotherapy. His cases illustrate the\r\nfact that when patients' minds and bodies are set at rest, all sorts\r\nof serious conditions proceed to get better. The rest of mind, the\r\ncessation of worry, the presence of a feeling of confidence in\r\nrecovery, is quite as important as the physical measures. Young\r\nsurgeons particularly probably could not do better than follow the\r\nadvice of the old Scotch surgical professor at Edinburgh who suggests\r\nto his pupils that they should read Hilton's \"Rest and Pain\" at least\r\nonce a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMENTAL INFLUENCE BEFORE OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch may be done during the preparation for operation to put the\r\npatient in the most suitable condition for the manifestation of\r\nhealthy reaction of tissue and of normal convalescence. Many patients\r\ndo not come for operation until their health has been somewhat\r\nimpaired at least by the condition requiring operation. Not\r\ninfrequently a good proportion of this impairment of health is due not\r\nso much to the lesion that is present as to the worry over it and the\r\nanxiety and solicitude which its development has occasioned. If the\r\nlesion is in connection with the digestive tract, this is particularly\r\nlikely to be true, and nutrition will often have been sadly interfered\r\nwith, not so much by direct influence of the pathological condition as\r\nby the unfavorable mental influence developing in connection with it.\r\nWe know now that it is perfectly possible for an indigestion which is\r\nentirely above the neck to make rather serious inroads upon the health\r\nof the patient, by producing dislike for food or at least such loss of\r\nappetite as leads to considerable reduction in weight. In such cases\r\nthere are often complications, such as tendencies to constipation,\r\nthat still further impair health or at least reduce vitality and\r\ntherefore hamper that healthy reaction which should occur after\r\noperation in order to assure normal convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessory Neuroses.--In many of these cases, even where there is a\r\ndefinite lesion present, the patient can be brought up to normal\r\nweight, or at least his condition can be greatly improved by medical\r\ntreatment accompanied {750} by such attention to his state of mind as\r\nwill neutralize its unfavorable influence. If he can be made to\r\nunderstand that a definite effort to increase weight and to bring back\r\nhis strength will be of assistance in recovery from the operation, and\r\nthat the reestablishment of certain habits of eating and caring for\r\nhimself will do much to help in this, very desirable changes for the\r\nbetter in his general health may be brought about. This is illustrated\r\nvery well by what happens in certain incurable cancer cases. The\r\npatients often have lost considerable weight, even thirty to forty\r\npounds, before an operation is decided on, and then when the operation\r\nis performed their cancer is found to be inoperable. After the\r\nexploration the patient is not told this, but is mercifully spared and\r\nis assured that now he ought to get better, since an operation has\r\nbeen performed. Such patients have been known to gain twenty, thirty,\r\nand in one case I believe over forty pounds as the result of the\r\nmental influence of this suggestion and the resumption of former\r\nhabits of life to some extent at least, consequent upon the\r\nneutralization of the unfavorable state of mind into which they had\r\nsunk before through over-solicitude about themselves. If even the\r\ndepressing effect of the toxins of cancer can thus be overcome, it is\r\neasy to understand how much can be accomplished when there is no such\r\nphysical factor at work.\r\n\r\n\r\nDominant Ideas.--As a general rule, it must be recognized that\r\npatients may be, and indeed frequently are, besides their definite\r\npathological conditions, under the influence of dominant ideas which\r\nmust be recognized and as far as possible neutralized. Some of them\r\nhave persuasions with regard to food and the amount that they can eat,\r\nothers have removed many important nutritious articles from their diet\r\nand are quite sure that any attempt on their part to take such\r\narticles is sure to be followed by indigestion, and still others have\r\nhabits with regard to the amount and the kind of fluids that they take\r\nat meals and between meals and, above all, the lack of fluids in their\r\ndiet which need to be overcome. Unless such ideas are counteracted\r\nthere is difficulty even in convalescence, and very often they have\r\nbrought patients into physical conditions in which whatever\r\npathological condition is present is emphasized by that over-attention\r\nwhich the nervous system is so prone to give to even slight sensations\r\nwhen the organism is in a state of lowered nutrition.\r\n\r\nIn not a few of these cases the bringing of the patient up to the\r\nnormal condition of weight and health, and the removal of the\r\ninfluence of dominant ideas, will perhaps also remove many of the\r\nindications for operation. There are many patients, and especially\r\nsuch as are reasonably educated and have some leisure, who get certain\r\nof their organs on their minds and produce symptoms or emphasize such\r\nsymptoms as are present until it seems as though an operation is the\r\nonly thing that can lift their burden of discomfort and permit them to\r\ngo on again with their work. We have all known of physicians who felt\r\nsure that they ought to be operated on for such conditions as gastric\r\nulcer or duodenal ulcer, though subsequent developments in the case,\r\nwhen they were persuaded to put off operation and made to reform\r\ncertain ill-advised habits, proved that no such lesion as they\r\nsuspected had ever been present. Indeed, some of these physicians and\r\neven surgeons have insisted so much that surgical friends occasionally\r\nhave operated on them and have found nothing to justify the operation.\r\n\r\n{751}\r\n\r\nSome of these states in connection with discomfort of various kinds in\r\nthe abdomen have been discussed in the chapter on Abdominal\r\nDiscomfort, and some illustrations of useless operations given. We\r\nmust not forget that there is a constant stream of pathological\r\nsuggestion in the air at the present time, not only in medical\r\njournals, but even in the secular press, and that this concentrates\r\nthe attention of patients on comparatively slight discomforts and\r\nleads to the exaggeration of them until even an operation seems a\r\nwelcome relief for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperative Persuasions.--While surgical operations are in practically\r\nall cases mutilations, they are absolutely necessary under certain\r\ncircumstances, are often, indeed, life-saving, and there is no doubt\r\nthat they have saved mankind a great deal of discomfort. Surgeons are\r\nagreed, however, that they are not to be performed unless they hold\r\nout a definite promise of physical relief. It is extremely important,\r\nthen, that patients must not become persuaded of the need of an\r\noperation in their cases unless surgical intervention is really\r\nnecessary. This is as true for physicians and even surgeons\r\nthemselves, as I have said, as it is for the general public. Women are\r\nmuch more susceptible than men to operation suggestions, and since it\r\nhas become fashionable to talk about _their_ operations, not only has\r\nthe deterrent idea of surgical mutilation been greatly lessened, but\r\nthere has actually developed in many of them a morbid fascination for\r\na similar experience with all its attraction of attention and promised\r\noccupation of mind for the woman of leisure.\r\n\r\nThis phase of the necessity for favorable mental influence has been\r\nespecially emphasized in the chapters on Gynecology. Unless,\r\ntherefore, there are very definite indications, operations must not be\r\nperformed, for they will relieve, as a rule, only for the time being,\r\nand further operations may have to be done to no purpose. Any\r\nphysician of reasonably large experience has seen such cases. Patients\r\nget the idea of an operation as their one hope, and then nothing less\r\nthan that will produce such diversion of mind as will bring relief of\r\nsymptoms. It is important in these cases that such patients should not\r\nhave operations suggested to them. Once the suggestion takes hold,\r\nthey do not use their reserve energy in such a way as to help out\r\neffectively other remedies that may be given. They distrust all\r\nremedial measures, think that at most they can be only palliative, and\r\nso do not add to other forms of therapeutics the power of\r\npsychotherapy to cure them.\r\n\r\nBesides the abdominal conditions, there are certain tuberculous\r\nconditions with regard to which this seems to be particularly true. I\r\nhave seen enlarged cervical glands disappear without discharge when\r\npatients have taken up the outdoor life, and, above all, when they\r\nhave gone out of the city and have lived the regime proper for those\r\nin whom tubercle bacilli are growing. If such patients, however, once\r\nbecome persuaded that their glands must be operated on, they are\r\nlikely to need, if not active intervention, at least the discharge of\r\nmaterial from their tuberculous lesions before they get well.\r\nOperations of a radical character for tuberculosis used to be much\r\nmore popular than they are now, when we are likely to think that\r\nnature can do more for tuberculous lesions in nearly all cases than\r\nthe most skillful surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFractures and the Mind.--In such surgical conditions as fractures and\r\ndislocations, a change has come about in the mode of treatment, at\r\nleast in many hands, that seems entirely physical in its effect, yet\r\nhas undoubtedly {752} exerted important psychic influences favorable\r\nto recovery which deserve to be noted. In dislocations and fractures,\r\nand particularly the latter, it was the custom in the past to do the\r\nfractured limb up in bandages and then leave it until knitting of the\r\nbones, or, in dislocations, healing of the soft tissues, had taken\r\nplace. Apparently it was forgotten that this eminently artificial\r\ncondition was not conducive to that healthy reaction of tissues for\r\nreparative purposes which must be expected in these cases. Circulation\r\nwas not so good because of the constrictive effect of the bandages;\r\nvitality not so high because of failure of nervous activity in\r\nabsolute immobility; the return venous circulation was somewhat\r\nhampered because there were no contractions of muscles; and all the\r\nconditions were distinctly unfavorable, though nature was expected not\r\nonly to maintain the health of the part, but bring about the added\r\nfunctions of repair. In spite of the more or less unfavorable\r\nconditions, nature was able, as a rule, to do so. Prof. Lucas\r\nChampionere reintroduced the older method of treating fractures and\r\ndislocations more openly and of even using certain manipulations,\r\npassive movements, and massage in order to encourage the circulation\r\nand the natural vitality of the limb.\r\n\r\nThere is another phase of the influence of this mode of treatment that\r\ndeserves to be recalled. When the fracture is hidden away for many\r\ndays and the patient is not absolutely sure whether it is getting on\r\nwell or not, solicitude or anxiety is awakened in some minds that\r\nprevents, or at least delays, normal healthy repair. It is well known\r\nby surgeons that fractures do not heal so well after accidents in\r\nwhich there has been considerable shock, or in which the simultaneous\r\ndeath of a friend seriously disturbs the patient's mind. Nor do\r\nfractures heal so well if the patient is worried about business\r\naffairs or seriously disturbed over family matters. Among sensitive\r\npatients, a state of mind not unlike that produced by worry or shock\r\nmay develop as a consequence of the dread that the fracture may not\r\nheal properly, or that there may be deformity, or that when the\r\nsurgeon removes the bandages he may find it necessary either to break\r\nit again or do something that would involve considerable discomfort.\r\nThese patients need reassurance. If the surgeon sees the broken limb\r\noccasionally, and, by manipulation and passive movements such as may\r\nproperly be used, assures himself as to its condition, the patient's\r\nmind is much better satisfied and that inhibition of trophic processes\r\nwhich otherwise sometimes occurs is prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncisions and Suggestion.--Something of this same psychotherapeutic\r\ninfluence is noted with regard to the healing of incisions when these\r\nare not left without inspection too long. The newer surgical customs\r\nof comparatively few dressings, so that the wound may easily be\r\ninspected and the patient may be completely assured with regard to it,\r\nhas undoubtedly had a good influence in bringing about more rapid\r\nrepair. Air is the best environment for a healing as well as a healthy\r\nskin, and mental trust is best for the patient's power of repair. In\r\nvigorous individuals such repair will occur anyhow. It is in those of\r\ndelicate health, neurotic disposition, and psychoneurotic tendencies,\r\nthat reassurances are needed. Often their physical condition is such\r\nthat they need every possible aid in bringing about complete repair.\r\nTheir state of mind, then, must be noted carefully, and any inhibitory\r\nideas that may be present because of over-anxiety as to how the\r\nincision is getting on must be removed. This does not mean that\r\npatients' whims should be yielded {753} to in the matter of\r\nover-solicitude about their condition, but that proper care should be\r\ntaken to prevent inhibition of trophic influences through unfavorable\r\nmental states just as far as is possible. Most surgeons of experience\r\ndo these things in the proper way by instinct from the beginning, or\r\nby a tactful habit, which develops in their surgical experience of\r\nadapting themselves to individual patients. It is well to realize,\r\nhowever, that such mental attitudes are extremely important and must\r\nbe deliberately treated by the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudo-rabies.--Certain conditions usually treated of as surgical have\r\nmental relations that are very interesting. There seems no doubt that\r\nin a certain number of cases pseudo-rabies occurs; that is, persons\r\nare bitten by a dog, become seriously disturbed over the possibility\r\nof rabies developing, and after brooding over this for a time their\r\nmind gives way and there is either a neurosis simulating many symptoms\r\nof true rabies, or a state of collapse from fright in which even death\r\nmay take place. These cases are not frequent. Their occurrence is\r\ntaken by some of those who are opposed to animal experimentation as a\r\nproof that rabies is always some such delusion, and that it is due to\r\nthe exaggeration of the significance of dog-bites by the medical\r\nprofession that the symptom complex known as rabies has come into\r\nexistence. This is, of course, nonsense, and many true cases of rabies\r\noccur. Since, however, these other cases provide the opportunity for\r\nargument in the matter, it is all the more necessary that they should\r\nbe recognized for what they are. When a patient has been bitten by a\r\ndog that has not died from rabies within three weeks after the bite,\r\nthere is practical certainty that the animal did not have and could\r\nnot communicate rabies. The cases of hydrophobia with long incubation\r\nperiods are rather dubious, and the general impression now is that\r\nthere has been subsequent infection. Patients who are in the midst of\r\noverwhelming dread of the development of rabies must be taken\r\nseriously and their cases treated by mental influence. Suggestion,\r\ninstruction, and the neutralization of wrong ideas by reference to\r\nauthorities in the matter, must be used to overcome the unfortunate\r\nstate of mind which may, if allowed to continue and, above all, to\r\ndevelop, prove serious for the individual.\r\n\r\nPseudo-rabies is but a type, though the most serious and perhaps most\r\nfrequent of what may be called surgical psycho-neuroses. There are\r\nothers. Imaginary syphilis is an affection that often causes worry and\r\ntrouble to patient and physician. _Herpes preputialis_ with mental\r\nsymptoms is almost as bad. These are mental infections of various\r\nkinds. There are many neoplastic persuasions and toxic suggestions\r\nthat must be treated with tact and firmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMENTAL INFLUENCE IN ANESTHESIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere in the domain of surgery is the influence of the mind more\r\nimportant than in the production of anesthesia for surgical purposes.\r\nIt is well known that intense preoccupation of mind will make an\r\nindividual completely anesthetic even for very severe injuries. In\r\nbattle men frequently are severely wounded, yet do not know it, or at\r\nleast have no idea of the extent of the wound and of the pain that\r\nordinarily would be inflicted by it. In the {754} midst of panics, as\r\nduring fires, or when crowds are trying to get out of buildings\r\nrapidly, people often suffer severe injuries and know nothing about\r\nthem. The story of the woman who lost her ear in the theater panic and\r\nwas quite unaware of it until her attention was called to it, is only\r\none of many striking examples. Men have been known to walk round even\r\nwith a broken leg, or with a dislocation with which it proved quite\r\nimpossible for them to move, once their mental preoccupation for\r\nothers ceased and they had time to think about themselves. Anesthetic\r\nincidents under conditions in which great pain might well be expected\r\nare not uncommon. It is evidently possible so completely to occupy the\r\nmind that pain sensations cannot find their way into the\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain and Diversion of Mind.--From very old times, attempts have been\r\nmade to use this power of the mind to prevent pain, and often with\r\nsome results. In preanesthetic surgery, minor operations were\r\nperformed rapidly, beginning just after the patient's attention had\r\nbeen attracted to something else besides the thought of the operation.\r\nPain is, of course, much less tolerable and seems to the sufferer at\r\nleast to be much more severe whenever the attention is concentrated on\r\nit. Specialists in nervous diseases, during the process of eliciting\r\ncomplaints of pain or tenderness while employing movements or\r\nmanipulations, usually try to attract the patient's attention as much\r\nas possible to something else, in order to determine just how much\r\ngenuine pain or tenderness is present. Often it is found that, while a\r\npart of the body is complained of as exquisitely tender or it is\r\naverred that a joint cannot, be touched or a limb moved without severe\r\npain, when the patient's attention is attracted strongly to something\r\nelse, deep palpations may be practiced and rather extensive\r\nmanipulations can be made without complaint. In these cases very often\r\nthe pain is not imaginary, but is slight, due to some physical basis,\r\nand has been very much increased by the concentration of attention on\r\nit. This part, at least of the pain, may be removed by an appeal to\r\nthe mind. The principle is valuable when there is question of minor\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nSurgeons have often taken advantage of this power of distraction of\r\nattention to relieve pain in surgical manipulations. The story is told\r\nof the French surgeon, Dupuytren, that he was called one day to see a\r\nlady whom he knew very well in order to determine the form of injury\r\nfrom which she was suffering. He found that she had a dislocation of\r\nthe shoulder, and during the manipulations, in order to make his\r\ndiagnosis, he almost inevitably inflicted considerable pain. She\r\ncomplained very bitterly and told him that she understood that he was\r\nvery rough with his hospital patients, but he must not be rough with\r\nher. He had hold of her hand at the moment, and, just before grasping\r\nthe arm in such a way as to make the manipulations necessary to reduce\r\nthe dislocation, he slapped her face and told her that she must not\r\ntalk to him while he was treating her. Needless to say, she was deeply\r\nshocked. Before her shock had passed away, Dupuytren had completed the\r\nreduction of the dislocation, and in her preoccupation of mind she\r\nfelt almost no pain. She remarked afterwards, however, that she had\r\nsuffered so much mental anguish from his unexpected roughness that she\r\nwas not sure whether, after all, she had been really spared in her\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypnotic Anesthesia.--When, in the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, {755} scientific attention was seriously attracted to\r\nhypnotism, it was hoped that this would prove an effective means of\r\nproducing anesthesia during surgical operations or at least of greatly\r\nlessening pain. The hope was not disappointed. There was a discussion\r\non the subject before the Medical Chirurgical Society of London in\r\n1840, and in 1843 Dr. Eliotson wrote a work with the title, \"Numerous\r\nCases of Surgical Operations Without Pain in the Mesmeric State.\" In\r\n1846 Sir John Forbes wrote in his Review that \"the testimony as to the\r\nvalue of hypnotism as an anesthetic is now of so varied and extensive\r\na kind as to require an immediate and complete trial of the practice\r\nin surgical cases.\" At the end of that same year, ether as an\r\nanesthetic was introduced into England, and the first case was\r\nreported under the caption \"Animal Magnetism Superseded,\" which shows\r\nhow much attention the previous attempts at hypnotic anesthesia had\r\nattracted. After this, hypnotism was given up for anesthetic purposes\r\nexcept by a few enthusiastic students of it. These, however, succeeded\r\nin accomplishing much with it. Dr. Esdaile, in India, succeeded in\r\ndoing all sorts of operations under hypnotism. Dr. Milne Bramwell, in\r\n\"Hypnotism, Its History, Practice and Theory\" (London, 1906), lays\r\ndown the rules for hypnosis for anesthetic purposes. They are\r\neminently practical.\r\n\r\nWhile hypnotism can be used to produce anesthesia, it has many\r\ndisadvantages. The length of the hypnosis cannot always be arranged so\r\nas to assure anesthesia during the whole of an operation, while in\r\nsome cases it will continue after the operation for some time in spite\r\nof every effort on the part of the hypnotist to bring the patient to\r\nhimself. Besides, the depth of the hypnosis cannot always be assured,\r\nand sometimes some sensation remains. Patients will groan and wince\r\nand move, though, of course, under ether or chloroform such\r\nmanifestations may take place, yet the patient afterwards will give\r\nevery assurance that not the slightest pain was felt. In some cases,\r\nhowever, even where the pain sensation is not severe during an\r\noperation under hypnosis, it may, nevertheless, prove sufficient, when\r\ncontinued for some time, to bring the patient out of the hypnotic\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nFor short operations of minor character, undoubtedly hypnosis can be\r\nemployed successfully. As we explain in the chapter on Hypnotism,\r\nanyone can produce hypnosis who has confidence in his own power and in\r\nwhom the patient has trust. There is no need of a special hypnotist,\r\nand there is no special faculty required. There should be some\r\nfamiliarity with procedures, but any man has just as much hypnotic\r\npower as another. The influence does not pass from the operator to the\r\nsubject, but is due to the subject's concentration of his attention so\r\nthat there is a short circuiting of association tracts within the\r\nbrain very probably, which does not permit the entrance into\r\nconsciousness of sensations through any path except one or two,\r\nusually that of hearing, and sometimes of sight, less frequently of\r\nother sensations.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentration of Attention.--In a great many cases of minor\r\noperations, such as the opening of a boil of a small abscess, the\r\npulling of a tooth, the lancing of a gum, or other such procedures, a\r\nsurgeon who is confident in his own mental power over his patient can\r\nrather easily produce a state of mind in which the discomfort of the\r\nsurgical procedure is greatly minimized. There are certain physical\r\nhelps for this. For instance, if patients are asked to breathe rapidly\r\nand deeply for a few minutes, there is a hyperoxygenation {756} of the\r\nblood which seems to obtund sensibility. If patients are told of this,\r\nand then made to breathe rapidly for a half a minute in order that\r\nthey may continue consciously their deep, rapid breathing even when\r\npain is noted, a state of mind is produced from concentration of\r\nattention on their breathing in which painful sensations are greatly\r\nobtunded. The effect is probably more mental than physical, and is\r\nwell worth while trying because of the amount of pain it often saves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaking Suggestion.--Without resort to hypnotism, much can be\r\naccomplished by mental suggestion in the waking state to lessen the\r\npain of surgical operations and maneuvers. This is particularly true\r\nas regards nervous persons, who will otherwise emphasize their\r\ndiscomfort, and for those of lesser intelligence, children, and the\r\nlike. Esdaile's experiences in India show how much can be done in this\r\nway. Often the hypnosis was so slight that the patients were perfectly\r\ncognizant of everything that went on around them, yet under the\r\ncompelling influence of the assurance of Dr. Esdaile, whom they\r\ntrusted completely, they did not complain of pain nor wince even when\r\nconsiderable surgical intervention was practiced, and they always\r\nassured their friends afterwards that they had felt nothing. I know an\r\nAmerican physician who has an almost similar power over negroes.\r\nOrdinarily it requires more of an anesthetic to produce\r\ninsensitiveness to pain in the negro than in a white person. By\r\npersonal assurance, by the absolute securing of their confidence, and\r\nthrough their trust in him, this man is able to produce anesthesia\r\nwithout the use of more than a minimum quantity of the anesthetic. He\r\nis able to do the same thing with children, and, of course, it is well\r\nknown that mental influence over them is extremely important in\r\nlimiting the amount of anesthetic that will be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality of Anesthetist.--Some anesthetists by their personal\r\ninfluence are able to bring patients under the influence of an\r\nanesthetic with much less excitement and, as a consequence, with the\r\nuse of much less of the anesthetic than others. It is the same\r\nquestion of personal influence that extends through all medicine. Some\r\nmen seem to have it naturally, and others not, though to some extent,\r\nat least, it may be cultivated. Of course, it is now well understood\r\nthat, under no circumstances, should a patient be forced to take an\r\nanesthetic. This is as true for a child as for any other patient. Only\r\na little management is required to secure the cooperation of even a\r\nyoung child. Above all, there must be no struggling, and while there\r\nmay be a passing stage of excitement, which cannot be entirely\r\ncontrolled, this can be eliminated by those who are skillful. It may\r\nbe necessary, especially in the case of children, for the little\r\npatients to become familiar with the anesthetist. They should see him\r\non several occasions and should be made to feel that they know him.\r\nThe presence of a stranger is enough of itself to excite children and\r\nmake them suspicious and resentful of any manipulations. It may be\r\nwell for them to have breathed through the cone on several occasions\r\nand to play a sort of game with it. In this way children will often go\r\nunder an anesthetic without any struggle or excitement.\r\n\r\nIt seems a little childish to suggest similar procedures with grown\r\npatients, but even surgeons of long experience with the older methods\r\nwho have insisted on the trial being made on their patients have found\r\nmuch benefit from it. Familiarity with the anesthetist and even with\r\nthe inhaler {757} and the breathing through it on several occasions\r\nbeforehand, when no anesthetic is being administered, helps many\r\npatients not a little. This preliminary is particularly of help with\r\nregard to nervous patients and especially women. It is very seldom\r\nnecessary to use nitrous oxide as a preliminary to ether if this mode\r\nof procedure is practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Diversion.--It is well to concentrate the mind of the patient\r\non something else besides his sensations. One element that is\r\nextremely important for anesthesia is deep breathing. The patient must\r\nthen have his attention called to the necessity for deep breathing and\r\nshould frequently have the suggestion to this effect repeated in his\r\near as he comes under the anesthetic. There should be some practice in\r\ndeep breathing deliberately beforehand, with the idea of accustoming\r\nthe respiratory mechanism to take deep breaths by habit even when not\r\nentirely under the control of the will. This may be done with the\r\ninhaler on a few occasions at least. The occupation of attention\r\nnecessary for deep breathing during the taking of the anesthetic\r\nlessens the concentration of mind on the feelings, and actually makes\r\nthe discomfort much less. Besides, deep breathing distributes the\r\nanesthetic over the lungs, leads to its absorption more rapidly, and\r\nmakes the irritation of the anesthetic less by diffusing it over a\r\nlarger surface. On the contrary, short, rapid breaths lead to an\r\nintensity of irritation and much slower absorption.\r\n\r\nSkilled anesthetists have found it of decided advantage to keep the\r\npatient's mind fixed on something else besides the breathing. Perhaps\r\nthe easiest recommendation is that of locking the hands over the\r\nabdomen just above the umbilicus and asking the patient to hold tight.\r\nThis gives something very definite to think about and to occupy the\r\nmind with. I have seen patients of rather nervous organizations go\r\nunder the influence of even a very small quantity of an anesthetic\r\nwhen required to hold their hands thus and when the command was\r\nconstantly repeated, \"Hold your hands tight,\" whenever there was the\r\nslightest sign of struggle or excitement. Where this was done\r\ntactfully and regularly, I have seen patient after patient go into\r\nanaesthesia without struggle or excitement and usually without any\r\nnoise or even a loud word. I realize how much the personality of the\r\nanaesthetist means in such cases, and I feel sure that anyone who is\r\nconfident in his own power in the matter will produce a corresponding\r\nfeeling of confidence in the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nFright in Anesthesia.--There seems good reason to think that\r\noccasionally the deaths reported from anesthesia have really occurred\r\nfrom fright or at least have been greatly influenced by emotional\r\nfactors. It has often been noted that these deaths occurred\r\nparticularly at the beginning of the administration of an anesthetic\r\nand before anything like a sufficient quantity to produce a toxic\r\neffect had been administered. In other cases it has been noted that\r\npatients were allowed to come out partially from under the anesthetic,\r\nand as they recovered consciousness were disturbed by some incident.\r\nSometimes the pain seems to act as an inhibitory agent on the heart.\r\nIn more than one reported case the patient told afterwards of hearing\r\nvery distinctly some remark that seemed to be of bad omen. In one case\r\nin my own experience the breathing and heart stopped (though the\r\npatient fortunately was resuscitated) as a consequence of hearing a\r\nseries of rather loud goodbyes said at the door of the elevator\r\nleading to the operating room during the {758} course of an operation\r\njust at a moment when the anaesthetic influence was very much lessened\r\nfor a while. In some cases where there has been great fear of the\r\nanesthetic which has been talked over beforehand by the patient, even\r\na few whiffs of the ether or chloroform have given rise to serious\r\nsymptoms from stoppage of the heart. It is evident that it is\r\nextremely important properly to predispose such patients.\r\n\r\nThe well-known surgical warning not to make remarks during the course\r\nof an operation that might prove disturbing to the patient, needs to\r\nbe emphasized. By a very curious psychological anomaly some patients,\r\nthough thoroughly anesthetic as regards pain, are able to hear and\r\nunderstand very well remarks that are made near them. Fortunately,\r\nsuch patients are few in number, but they are sometimes rather\r\nseriously disturbed by chance observations that for the moment at\r\nleast seem to have an unfavorable bearing on their case. Besides,\r\ncertain patients sometimes have their special senses come out from\r\nunder the influence of the anesthetic before their sense of pain. They\r\nmay also hear and be disturbed. These cases illustrate very well the\r\nplace of mental influence and how much deliberate attention should be\r\ngiven to this phase of the treatment of surgical cases coming out of\r\nanesthesia, as well as while more or less under its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Anesthesia.--In local anesthesia it has come to be generally\r\nrecognized in recent years that the personality of the operator is one\r\nof the most important factors for success. A number of local\r\nanesthetics have been introduced, and in some hands only comparatively\r\nsmall quantities of them are needed in order to produce complete\r\nabsence of pain during operations. In other hands, however,\r\nconsiderable and even toxic quantities may have to be employed and\r\nsometimes without entire satisfaction. Infiltration anesthesia depends\r\nfor its success largely on the personal influence of the administrator\r\nover the patient. It is extremely important that the patient should\r\nhave complete confidence and not have that confidence disturbed in any\r\nway. For instance, he needs to be warned that he will feel the slight\r\nprick of the needle when it is first introduced, for otherwise he will\r\nbe disturbed by even so slight a pain at the very beginning and will\r\nmagnify subsequent feelings until satisfactory local anesthesia\r\nbecomes impossible. Without thorough command over the patient and\r\ncomplete trust, local anesthesia never succeeds except in very minor\r\noperations. There are some men, however, who can do even severe and\r\nextensive operations with comparatively small amounts of local\r\nanesthesia. Others cannot perform satisfactorily even minor operations\r\nwith large amounts. It is the operator, his personality, and mental\r\ninfluence over the patient that counts.\r\n\r\n\r\nVomiting After Anesthesia.--The vomiting that comes after anesthesia,\r\nespecially with ether, often constitutes not only an annoying but\r\nsometimes a seriously disturbing complication. It must not be\r\nforgotten that vomiting in neurotic individuals, and especially women,\r\nmay be largely due to a neurosis. In the section on Psychotherapy in\r\nObstetrics we discuss the vomiting that occurs in connection with\r\npregnancy and suggest that it is nearly always neurotic in character.\r\nThe best-known European obstetricians are now agreed in this. While\r\nether produces a tendency to vomit in everyone, in some the actual\r\nvomiting is very slight or completely absent. If patients expect that\r\nthere is to be vomiting, if they are of the neurotic temperament that\r\nnot only {759} vomits easily but has a tendency to secure sympathy by\r\nfostering this symptom unconsciously perhaps, then the vomiting may\r\nbecome even a dangerous complication. If there is no expectancy in the\r\nmatter, however, but if, on the contrary, it is made clear to these\r\npatients before the anesthetic is administered that, while there may\r\nbe some nausea, there need be no vomiting unless they yield too\r\nreadily to their feelings, much can be done to lessen the vomiting. A\r\nsingle suggestion may not mean much in this matter, but a series of\r\nsuggestions properly given beforehand, especially if the patient has\r\nseen others vomiting after operations and is worrying about it, may\r\nprove of excellent contrary suggestive value.\r\n\r\nIf there is no expectancy, the physician must be careful not to arouse\r\nit by over-solicitous anxiety in the matter. A plain statement should\r\nbe made on several occasions, however, so that the patient will have\r\nin mind a good basis for contrary suggestion when coming out of the\r\nanesthetic. Many remedies have been suggested for this post-anesthetic\r\nvomiting, but, just as with regard to the vomiting of pregnancy, the\r\nmost important element in all the cures that have been reported has\r\nbeen the influence upon the patient's mind. Whenever we have a number\r\nof remedies for an affection, it is almost sure that it is not their\r\nphysical but their psychic effect that is of most importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMENTAL INFLUENCE AFTER OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery surgeon feels the necessity of having his patients as quiet and\r\nrestful as possible after operation. Any unfavorable mental influence\r\nwill surely hamper the curative reaction of tissues and delay\r\nconvalescence. We all know how fear blanches tissues, and anxiety\r\ncauses hyperemia, and how solicitude with regard to any part of the\r\nbody interferes with the normal control of the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem and sets up vasomotor disturbances. Either a lessening or\r\nsurplus of blood in a particular part interferes with the normal and\r\nhealthy curative reaction of tissues. The patient's mind should\r\ntherefore be as much as possible diverted from attention to the part\r\nthat has been operated on in order to leave nature to pursue its\r\npurposes without disturbance. For this, of course, pain must be\r\nrelieved and every possible measure taken that will add to the comfort\r\nof the patient. In spite of the fact that opium may interfere with\r\ncertain natural processes, it is always useful after severe\r\noperations, because it represents the lesser of two evils. The pain of\r\nitself would produce more detriment than does the opium which relieves\r\nthe pain. There are, of course, other anodynes which may be used and\r\nthat have less disturbing sequelae. In this matter, routine is\r\nunfortunate, for individual patients react very differently to opium\r\nand its derivatives, the disturbing effect upon the mind being greater\r\nthan the quieting effect on the body. Many patients stand the coal-tar\r\nderivatives much better because of their lack of effect on the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoval of Worries.--Worries of all kinds not associated with the\r\noperation must have been thoroughly removed beforehand and must not be\r\nallowed {760} to obtrude themselves afterwards until convalescence is\r\nwell established. Business is quite another matter. Whenever it does\r\nnot imply worry but only means occupation of mind and distraction of\r\nthe attention of the patient from himself, it may very well be\r\npermitted, after only a comparatively brief interval after operation.\r\nWithin a few days a business man may certainly be allowed to dictate\r\nletters for an hour or so, and an author may even be allowed to\r\ndictate notes of some of the fancies that came to him during\r\nanesthesia. When a man has the opportunity to look forward to even a\r\nshort interval during the day when he can do something that is useful,\r\nit serves as an excellent distraction for many hours beforehand and as\r\na satisfactory memory for hours afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleasant Visits.--It used to be the custom to keep visitors from\r\npatients after operation much longer than is at present the custom.\r\nThere has come the realization, however, that short visits from\r\npleasant friends may mean much for the patient. It is hard to make the\r\nselection, for certain friends and especially relatives disturb and\r\nannoy rather than help the patient. Anyone who shows much solicitude\r\nand, above all, fussy over-anxiety, must be excluded, no matter how\r\nnearly related he or she may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychic Conditions of Hospitals.--The atmosphere of the hospital must\r\nall conduce to peace and quiet of mind. It is surprising the\r\ndifferences that may be noted in this respect. I have been in a\r\nhospital where only a dozen of operations were done a week and have\r\nscarcely ever been there without hearing complaints of pain and\r\ndiscomfort that were surely disturbing to others. On the other hand, I\r\nhave been in a hospital where twenty capital operations a day were\r\ndone, and have heard no complaint, and at nine o'clock at night have\r\nfound in it the peace of a religious community. I knew that it was all\r\ndue to the personality of the surgeons and their lack of power in one\r\ncase to impress their patients' minds and a very marvelous power in\r\nthe other of impressing patients favorably. The success of many a\r\nsurgeon in a material way depends on this power to impress his\r\npatients. It is they who send others to him, and in general there is a\r\nfeeling that if he cannot cure them no one can.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is extremely important that circumspection should be\r\nemployed as regards chance remarks that may be seriously\r\nmisinterpreted and prove unfavorably suggestive. Patients should not,\r\nas a rule, be allowed to see their own charts whenever there are\r\ndisturbing developments in pulse and temperature. During dressings the\r\nconversation should be cheerful, distracting to the patient, and\r\nshould not contain remarks that may be disturbing. The surgeon and his\r\nassistants must know how to control their expressions so as not to\r\nreveal any solicitude that may be occasioned by the patient's progress\r\nor by the state of his wound when these are not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgeon's Visits.--Practically every time that a surgeon visits a\r\npatient after operation there is something that the patient has to ask\r\nor have explained. A good deal depends, as far as regards the comfort\r\nand peace of mind during the interval until the coming of the surgeon\r\nagain, on the satisfaction derived from the surgeon's explanation. He\r\nshould be prepared, therefore, to answer in such a way as will leave\r\nno haunting doubts in the patient's mind. Some patients are very prone\r\nto find unfavorable suggestions in even simple expressions of the\r\nphysician. He must be prepared for {761} this, therefore, and be sure\r\nto say nothing that can possibly be misunderstood. In spite of this,\r\nat times patients will draw unfavorable inferences and then the nurse\r\nshould have the confidence of the patient sufficiently to set the\r\nmatter right or at least to give reassurance that will keep the\r\npatient's anxiety from disturbing until the next visit of the surgeon.\r\nAll of this seems trivial from a certain standpoint, but even surgery\r\nis as yet an art and not a science. Art depends on personality and the\r\ninfluence of it and the power to express itself. The personality of\r\nthe surgeon must be felt in the patient, and the more he can make it\r\nfelt the better the convalescence and the less discomfort even though\r\nthere should be more of pain. The amount of pain actually felt depends\r\non how much of it gets above the threshold of consciousness.\r\n\r\nAlmost any surgical patient, especially if he has gone through a\r\nserious convalescence, will tell you how much good the visits of his\r\nphysician used to do him, though a glum and over-serious surgeon may\r\nhave exactly the opposite effect. Sometimes busy surgeons neglect to\r\nvisit their patients daily, and nearly always this has an unfortunate\r\neffect. In serious cases, the seeing of the surgeon several times a\r\nday, when it is well understood that his visits are not due to\r\nover-anxiety with regard to the patient, may hasten convalescence\r\nmaterially.\r\n\r\n\r\nComfort, Mental and Physical.--Everything must be done to make the\r\npatients as physically comfortable as possible. It must be well\r\nunderstood, however, that comfort lies much more in variety and\r\nresponse to feeling than in any continuous condition. Patients will\r\nhave little complaints and there must be always something novel to do\r\nfor them. This does not necessarily imply medicine or even troublesome\r\nexternal applications, but the rearranging of bed clothing, the use of\r\na hot-water bag or of an ice bag, the relief of pressure, sometimes\r\nmild applications of pressure, the lifting of the head, slight\r\nturning, even small changes of position and the like. Whenever a\r\npatient can be relieved by some means so simple as these external\r\ntrifling remedial measures, confidence is awakened that the discomfort\r\nthey feel is not due to any serious condition, but is only such achy\r\ntiredness as comes from confinement to bed. Without relief afforded in\r\nthis way, they are likely to let unfavorable suggestion accumulate\r\nuntil their dread of something serious may inhibit convalescence or at\r\nleast interfere with sleep and greatly enhance their discomfort\r\ngenerally. It is the state of mind that develops as a consequence of\r\ncontinued trifling discomforts and not the physical results of those\r\ndiscomforts that must be carefully looked to in post-operative\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\nNursing.--In the general management of patients after operations it\r\nwould be eminently helpful to the surgeon if surgical nurses were\r\nsupposed to read at least once a year, Florence Nightingale's \"Notes\r\non Nursing,\"   [Footnote 61] written half a century ago, and if the\r\nsurgeon himself should have read it through once at least and dip into\r\nit occasionally afterwards. In her chapter on Noise there are many\r\nremarks that I should like to quote, but the whole chapter is so\r\nvaluable that it is hard to know where it stops, and so only a few\r\nexpressions may be given here. For instance, \"Never to allow a patient\r\nto be waked intentionally or accidentally, is a _sine qua non_ of all\r\ngood nursing. If he is aroused out of his first sleep he is almost\r\ncertain to have no more sleep.\" \"The more sleep patients get the\r\nbetter will they be able to sleep.\" \"I have often {762} been surprised\r\nat the thoughtlessness (resulting in cruelty, quite unintentionally)\r\nof friends or of doctors who will hold a long conversation just in the\r\nroom or passage adjoining the room of the patient, who is either every\r\nmoment expecting them to come in, or who has just seen them, and knows\r\nthey are talking about him.\" \"Everything you do in a patient's room\r\nafter he is 'put up' for the night increases tenfold the risk of his\r\nhaving a bad night. Remember, never to lean against, sit upon, or\r\nunnecessarily shake or even touch the bed in which a patient lies.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 61: American edition, Appleton, N. Y.. 1860.]\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, as might be expected, insists emphatically on the\r\nstate of the room, the arrangement of the furniture and the\r\ncheerfulness of surroundings as important factors for the cure of\r\npatients. One of the most important elements is, of course, the nurse.\r\nShe must be gentle, patient, quick to understand, often ready to\r\nanticipate wishes, and always as noiseless as possible. Slowness may\r\nbe neither gentle nor noiseless. Patients, particularly men, often\r\ngrow impatient at the slowness with which things are done for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nChattering Hopes.--There is scarcely an element of mind in the\r\npatient's environment that Miss Nightingale has not thought of and\r\ntouched with very practical wisdom. She deprecates, as does anyone who\r\nknows anything about the care of patients, the \"chattering hopes\" of\r\nthose who try to cheer patients by simply telling them that they ought\r\nto be more cheerful, that of course they will get well and that they\r\nmust not be anxious. She says: \"I would appeal most seriously to all\r\nfriends, visitors, and attendants of the sick to leave off this\r\npractice of attempting to 'cheer' the sick by making light of their\r\ndanger and by exaggerating their probabilities of recovery.\"\r\nCheerfulness and kindness towards the sick are one thing and foolish\r\nattempts at encouragement not founded on good reasons quite another.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariety of Thoughts.--From the chapter on Variety the following\r\nquotations show the very practical character of Miss Nightingale's\r\npersuasion as to the value of influencing the patient's mind:\r\n\r\n  \"To any but an old nurse or an old patient the degree would be quite\r\n  inconceivable to which the nerves of the sick suffer from seeing the\r\n  same walls, the same ceilings, the same surroundings, during a long\r\n  confinement to one or two rooms.\" \"The nervous frame really suffers\r\n  as much from this lack of variety as the digestive organs from long\r\n  monotony of diet.\" \"The effect in sickness, of beautiful objects, of\r\n  variety of objects, and especially of brilliancy of color is hardly\r\n  at all appreciated.\"\r\n\r\nAs Miss Nightingale insists, flowers are remedies of great value for\r\nthe ailing and especially for those who are confined to their room for\r\na long period. She pleads for having the bed placed near a window in\r\norder that they may see out into the fields and the scenery around\r\nthem, to which I would add with emphasis, and so that, if it is\r\npossible, they may see the occupations of human beings. Miss\r\nNightingale adds: \"Well people vary their own objects, their own\r\nemployments many times a day; and while nursing (!) some bedridden\r\nsufferer then, they let him lie there staring at a dead wall without\r\nany change of object to enable him to vary his thoughts.\" Quite\r\nneedless to say, variety is more important for the ailing than the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain Psychic Conditions.--Pain after operation is an extremely common\r\nsymptom and often causes much disturbance. Every surgeon knows how\r\n{763} individual are patients in this respect, and how much depends on\r\nthe personal reaction to pain. There are men and women who have very\r\nserious lesions, from which much pain might be expected, who complain\r\nvery little. There are, on the other hand, many men as well as women\r\nwho complain exaggeratedly after even trifling surgical intervention.\r\nWe have probably had some of the most striking examples of the\r\ninfluence of mind over body in these cases. Many a patient who\r\ncomplained bitterly of torment that made it impossible to rest has,\r\nafter being given a preliminary dose of morphine hypodermically,\r\nsubsequently been given less and less of that drug, until finally,\r\nafter a few days, he was getting injections of only distilled water.\r\nWithout their injection he was in agony. After it he settled down to a\r\nquiet, peaceful night. Very often it is noted that these pains are\r\nworse at night and there is a tendency for such patients to attract\r\nattention only at such times as may be productive of considerable\r\ndisturbance of the regular order and as may call special attention to\r\nthem. We used to call such conditions hysteria, though, of course,\r\nthey have nothing to do with the uterus and must be looked for in men\r\nquite as well as women.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychoneuroses.--These neurotic conditions, to use a term that carries\r\nno innuendo with it, may affect other functions besides that of\r\nsensation. Occasionally a neurologist is asked to see a patient in\r\nwhom, following an operation, usually not very serious, some paralytic\r\nsymptoms have developed. There is an inability to use one or more\r\nlimbs, and the suspicion of thrombosis is raised. It is rather easy,\r\nhowever, to differentiate thrombotic conditions from neurotic palsies.\r\nThe ordinary symptoms of the psychoneurosis are present. There is\r\nlikely to be considerable disturbance of sensation, with patches of\r\nanesthesia and hyperesthesia, some narrowing of the fields of vision,\r\nand anesthesia of the pharynx, sometimes even of the conjunctiva.\r\nOften there is something in the history that points to the possible\r\noccurrence of a neurotic condition. Sometimes it is extremely\r\ndifficult to get such patients over the mental persuasion that is the\r\nbasis of their palsy, but usually it can be accomplished by suggestion\r\nin connection with certain physical means. Electricity is often of\r\nexcellent effect in demonstrating to these patients that their muscles\r\nreact properly under stimulus and that it is only a question of\r\ninability to use them because of mental inhibition. Such conditions as\r\nastasia-abasia may develop quite apart from surgery, but there is\r\nalways some \"insult,\" as the Germans say, that is some physical basis\r\nfor them, and so they are often considered to be surgical.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychic Disturbance of Function.--Besides motion and pain, other\r\nfunctions may be affected through the mind. After operations within\r\nthe abdomen it is sometimes difficult to move the bowels when it is\r\ndesired to do so. It must not be forgotten that not infrequently in\r\nthese cases the patient's mental attitude of extreme solicitude with\r\nregard to his intestines is inhibiting peristalsis. Such constipation\r\nwill sometimes not yield to even rather strong purgatives, and yet\r\nwill promptly be bettered by something that alters the mental state.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that it is in cases of neurotic constipation\r\nthat _pittulae micarum panis_ have proven particularly useful. In the\r\nchapter on Constipation there is a discussion of this subject that\r\nwill often prove suggestive to surgeons.\r\n\r\nThis same thing is true with regard to post-operative urination. In\r\nwomen, {764} particularly, there may be difficulty of urination after\r\nvaginal operations, which may be attributed to some lesion of the\r\nurinary tract and yet only be due to failure of the patient properly\r\nto control muscles in these cases. As in obstetrical cases, position,\r\nthe presence of others, and the mental disturbance, may inhibit\r\nurination. The subject is discussed more fully in the section on\r\nPsychotherapy in Obstetrics. Surgeons are not so inclined now to\r\ninsist on absolute post-operative immobility, and even a slight change\r\nof position may enable patients to gain control over their bladders\r\nwithout the necessity for the use of the catheter, which always\r\ncarries an element of danger with it.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the mental attitude with regard to both of these\r\nfunctions--intestinal and vesical evacuation--must not be forgotten.\r\nThere are many persons who find it extremely difficult to bring about\r\nsuch evacuations in the lying position. Everything is unusual, and\r\ntheir exercise of the coordination of muscles necessary to accomplish\r\nthese functions is interfered with. It is somewhat like stuttering and\r\nthe incapacity of an individual who may be able to talk very well to\r\nclose friends and yet stammers just as soon as strangers are present\r\nor he is placed in unusual conditions. It has even been suggested that\r\nthere should be some exercise of these functions in the lying position\r\nbefore operation, in order to accustom patients to the conditions that\r\nwill obtain afterwards. They thus become used to their surroundings\r\nand the newer methods required, and, above all, if there should be any\r\npost-operative difficulty, they realize that it is not due directly to\r\nthe operation, but rather to the unaccustomed conditions. This proves\r\nhelpful in saving them from solicitude and consequent unrest and adds\r\nto the rapidity of convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood Craving.--When food is to be given in small quantities and there\r\nis likely to be craving for it, much can be done to save the patient\r\ndisquietude and disturbance by giving small portions rather\r\nfrequently, rather than distributing it over three times a day, as the\r\nroutine of life sometimes suggests. When water has to be denied, small\r\npieces of ice may occasionally be used with excellent advantage.\r\nPatients learn to look forward to breaks at the end of comparatively\r\nshort intervals in their craving, and the accumulative effect is\r\ngreatly lessened. It is well understood that whenever people are\r\nabsolutely denied anything, they are likely to let their minds dwell\r\non that fact and crave it much more than would otherwise be the case.\r\nIf they can look forward to having even the minutest quantities of\r\nanything that they want, however, craving is much less likely to be\r\ninsistent, and the state of mind is much easier to manage. In all of\r\nthese cases the confidence of the patient and the lessening of\r\nneurotic tendencies by suggestion means more than most of the physical\r\nremedies that have been recommended. There are some patients who\r\nrespond almost in a hypnotic way to suggestion from a physician in\r\nwhom they have great confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition and Peace of Mind.--The patient's general comfort is very\r\nimportant for the maintenance of a favorable state of mind. It used to\r\nbe the custom to keep patients rigidly in one position for days,\r\nsometimes more than a week, after operation. We know now that this is\r\nalmost never necessary, and that, of course, it is most fatiguing to\r\nthe patient. Keep the ordinary well person absolutely in one position,\r\nwithout the opportunity to change from side to side even during a\r\nsingle night, and there will be justifiable {765} complaint of tired\r\nand achy feelings as a consequence. To enforce such a state for\r\nforty-eight hours in those who are well will produce a highly nervous\r\nstate, consequent upon the fatigue and soreness of muscles induced.\r\nHence, the importance of taking every possible means to provide even\r\nslight changes of position for those who have been operated upon. A\r\nnumber of regular-sized pillows should be provided so that the head\r\nmay be raised and lowered, and a number of smaller pillows should be\r\nat hand which can be so placed as to relieve pressure at various parts\r\nand permit the patient to make at least slight changes of position\r\nduring the first forty-eight hours. After this, usually definite\r\nalterations of position may be allowed without danger. The surgeon\r\nmust think of these elements in the treatment and insist on them with\r\nhis nurses, or they will not be carried out. It is possible now to\r\npermit patients to sit up much sooner than before, and, indeed, in\r\npelvic operations, this is said to be definitely beneficial by\r\npreventing the spread of any infectious material that may be present\r\ninto the general peritoneal cavity, and in older people it prevents\r\nthe development or, at least, greatly facilitates the dispersion of\r\ncongestion or such beginning pneumonic areas from hypostatic\r\ncongestion as may be present.\r\n\r\n\r\n{766}\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA physician who wishes to use psychotherapy effectively should know\r\nsomething about physiological psychology, or analytical or\r\nexperimental psychology, as it is variously called, because of the\r\nhelp that he will derive from it in understanding many of his\r\npatients' symptoms. Fortunately this branch is now being taught in\r\nsome of the medical schools, and the greater requirements for\r\npreliminary training bring to the medical school men who have already\r\nhad a course in this subject. The chapter on Illusions is particularly\r\nimportant because it affords many illustrations of how easy it is to\r\nbe deceived by the senses and, therefore, how many precautions have to\r\nbe taken in order to be sure that impressions produced on patients'\r\nminds that seriously disturb them may not merely be due to\r\nexaggeration of the significance of information brought them by their\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nThese illusions are of special interest because they represent not\r\nonly failures of the senses to convey truth, but because they\r\nillustrate how easy it is for the mind to be led astray by the senses.\r\nPeople often declare that they have seen things with their own eyes or\r\nin some other way have definite sensory knowledge of them, yet these\r\nillusions make it clear that it is perfectly possible for such sensory\r\nphenomena to convey quite mistaken information. People who are\r\nsuffering from many symptoms are persuaded that they must pay\r\nattention to their sensations. The main purpose of the\r\npsychotherapeutist often is to have them neglect their sensations and\r\ncorrect them by means of information gathered from other sources. We\r\ndo this with regard to our sensory illusions, why not also with regard\r\nto many sensations which are probably quite as mistaken, in certain\r\nindividuals at least, as these universal illusions of mankind. The\r\nargument from analogy holds very well and can be used to decided\r\nadvantage in many cases.\r\n\r\nA startling illusion which makes it clear that care is needed in\r\ninterpreting our sensations, is the so-called tube illusion or\r\nexperiment. If a sheet of note paper be rolled into a tube of\r\nsomething less than an inch in diameter and then held close to one\r\neye, both eyes being kept open, while the hand opposite to the eye\r\nbefore which the tube is held is placed palm faceward against the side\r\nof the tube about its middle, a hole will be seen, as it were, through\r\nthe palm of the hand. This false vision is as clear as can be and\r\npersists after any number of repetitions of the experiment. It merely\r\nillustrates two-eyed vision. We have a picture in each eye and we\r\ncombine them. When the pictures cannot be combined for any reason,\r\noptical illusions result. There are many more optical illusions than\r\nwe think and there are many reasons besides two-eyed vision for them.\r\n\r\nOther illusions of two-eyed vision may be illustrated rather easily.\r\nIf {767} two dots are made on a sheet of paper about two inches apart\r\nand the eyes look at them in a dreamy way, looking far beyond the\r\npaper, with vision more or less fixed between them, after a few\r\nmoments a number of things happen. Usually the two dots exhibit a\r\ntendency to float together.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 26 (two dots about two inches apart)]\r\n\r\nAfter an interval four dots will be seen--each of the dots having a\r\npicture in each eye. Then only one dot may be seen because the\r\npictures combine. Sometimes three dots will be seen. When the dots\r\nswim toward one another, a curious feeling of insecurity comes over\r\nthe experimenter, showing how much our sense of stability is dependent\r\non vision and illustrating why vision from a height is so disturbing\r\nbecause objects cannot be properly fixed on the distant background.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 27 (from left to right--an empty bird cage, a\r\n  vertical line, a bird)]\r\n\r\nJust as the two dots may be made to come together, so, after a little\r\npractice, a bird may be made to go into a cage (Fig, 27) or an apple\r\nmade to go onto a plate (Fig. 28),\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 28 (from left to right--an apple, a large plate)]\r\n\r\nThese illusions show how many things that people {768} \"see with their\r\nown eyes\" are not so. All depends on the attention and the state of\r\nmind at the time when the seeing is done. In day-dreams these\r\nillusions often occur and may be the basis of delusions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig, 29 (Several complex line figures)]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a number of optical illusions which illustrate\r\ncertain defects of our vision that cannot be corrected, no matter how\r\nmuch we may desire to see correctly. We continue to see them not as\r\nthey are but as they seem, and we must correct our vision by\r\ninformation from other sources. The Mueller-Lyer lines are familiar and\r\nare given here (Fig. 29) because {769} they show how easily the senses\r\nmay deceive us, even that most acute of our senses, vision, as to the\r\nsizes of things.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30 ( Two identical figures, one above the other;\r\n  each is like a funnel cut parallel to its axis and laid flat. )]\r\n\r\nFigure 30 illustrates how easy it is to be deceived by the\r\njuxtaposition of different portions of objects. I have had a woman who\r\nhad cut out high collars for children and who happened to put them in\r\nthe juxtaposition of the sketch here given think that she was either\r\nlosing her sight or her judgment was being affected by the nervous\r\ncondition in which she was. Nothing would persuade her that some\r\nserious development was not taking place until I showed her this\r\nillustration. In this illusion the juxtaposition of the short curved\r\nline to the long curved line of the other figure produces all the\r\ndisturbance of judgment of size.\r\n\r\nThe illusions of filled and unfilled space are interesting and are\r\nquite inevitable. They are due to physiological visual effects and are\r\nvery strikingly illustrated by what is known as the sun and moon\r\nillusion. Both these luminaries seem larger at the horizon than they\r\nare at the zenith. This is entirely an optical illusion. The horizon\r\nseems farther away than the zenith because vision to it is\r\ninterrupted. The heavens appear not to be a half sphere, but more like\r\nan old-fashioned watch glass.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31 (A--a square consisting of closely spaces\r\n  vertical lines; B--a square consisting of closely spaces horizontal\r\n  lines; C--a empty square with only its exterior boundaries.)]\r\n\r\nSince the sun and moon occupying the same space on the retina are,\r\nbecause of this apparent difference of distance, judged to be farther\r\naway at the horizon than they are at the zenith, we are inevitably\r\nforced to the conclusion that they are larger in size than when in the\r\nother position. The over-estimation of filled space as compared with\r\n{770} the unfilled is mainly due to the interrupted muscular action of\r\nthe eyes in traveling over the space requiring more effort. This makes\r\nit seem longer. Probably physiological processes on the retina also\r\ncontribute to the illusion. A series of objects, even dots, will cause\r\na greater physiological excitation of the retina than an equal amount\r\nof space, the boundaries of which alone are brought to our attention.\r\n\r\nIllusions of size are even more startling than illusions of distance.\r\nIt is perfectly possible to take three spaces, each exactly a square\r\ninch, and by drawing lines in two of them in different directions to\r\nmake the figures appear of {771} very different size. This is a rather\r\ndisturbing illusion, particularly for women who are apt to think that\r\nperpendicular lines make them appear tall and thin, while horizontal\r\nlines have the opposite effect. This is true if the lines are not\r\nplaced quite close together. The reason why women wear many ribbons,\r\nhowever, whether they themselves recognize it or not, is that the\r\nattraction of attention to these makes the space in which they are\r\nseem longer. Hussars are dressed in uniforms with many rows of gilt\r\ncord or braid running across their chests in order to increase their\r\napparent height. As a rule, a cavalry man must not weigh over 140\r\npounds or his horse will break down in long, forced marches. Such men\r\nare often of small stature and their apparent height must be increased\r\nby their uniform, so as to make them look formidable. Advantage is\r\ntaken of this optical illusion of filled space to produce this effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 32 (several complex curved figures,)]\r\n\r\nOther illusions of size are quite frequent. It is rather hard for the\r\nordinary observer to think that the half circles, _a_ and _a'_ (Fig.\r\n32), are the same size, or that _b_ and _b'_ in the same chart are the\r\nsame curve. The interruption in the circles _c_ and _c'_ produce very\r\ncurious erroneous impressions which require a knowledge of this\r\nillusion to correct.\r\n\r\nOptical illusions with regard to directions of lines are extremely\r\ncommon. Quite unconsciously we translate directions into special\r\nmeanings. This is what enables perspective to be effective in\r\ndrawings. It has many disturbing features, however. Some of these are\r\nstriking illustrations of the defects of our vision.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 33 (tall, narrow rectangles covering diagonal\r\n  lines passing under them.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig, 34 (a large black square with several parallel\r\n  diagonal white lines; each diagonal line has several intersecting\r\n  lines; the upper left diagonal has horizontal intersecting lines,\r\n  the next diagonal has vertical intersections; etc.)]\r\n\r\nPoggendorf's illustration of the displacement of oblique lines (Figure\r\n33) {772} and Zoellner's distortion of parallel lines as illustrated by\r\nFigure 34, make it very clear that our judgment of direction must\r\ndepend on many factors besides our vision, if we are not to make\r\nserious mistakes.\r\n\r\nThese optical illusions might seem to be of little significance, but\r\nthe Greeks thought them of so much importance and recognized so\r\nthoroughly that they could not be corrected, and that the distortions\r\nand displacements would inevitably take place, that they deliberately\r\nput certain optical corrections into their great architectural\r\nmonuments in order to avoid these false appearances. These have been\r\ntraced very accurately in the Parthenon, for instance. In a word, the\r\nGreeks, knowing of these optical illusions, in order to make the lines\r\nof their buildings appear correct, deliberately made them wrong to a\r\nsufficient degree to correct the optical illusion; This frank mode of\r\nyielding to a limitation of human nature is a fine lesson for patients\r\nto learn if they can only be made to learn it from these\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nIt is with regard to colors, however, that we have the best examples\r\nof optical illusions depending on the individual and his special\r\nanatomy and physiology. Color-blind people are quite sure that they\r\nsee color, just as other people do, until their defect is demonstrated\r\nto them. A man who is color blind for red thinks that he sees that\r\ncolor as other people do, while all that he sees is a particular shade\r\nof brightness which, because other people call it red, he has come to\r\ncall red. When asked to pick out red from a series of other colors he\r\nmay often succeed. When asked, however, to take a skein of red wool\r\nselected for him to a basket containing a number of different colored\r\nwools, and to bring back all those that are of the same color, he will\r\nselect grays and browns and sometimes greens as well as reds, and\r\npresent them as all matched colors. A man who is color blind for all\r\ncolors will still think that he sees colors as other people do. The\r\ningenious illustration of the American flag as it appears to people\r\nsuffering from different forms of color blindness, though they are all\r\npersuaded that they see the same kind of flag, is an interesting\r\nexample of how different may be people's sensations, though their\r\nconclusions are the same. It may be seen in many of the text books of\r\nanalytical or experimental psychology.\r\n\r\n{773}\r\n\r\nDalton, to whom we owe the atomic theory, was himself color blind for\r\nred and made the first investigations in that subject. He was of\r\nQuaker origin and found that a great many of his brethren were\r\ndeficient in color vision. It becomes much easier from this to\r\nunderstand why they resolved to wear nothing but gray. They did not\r\nsee colors as other people do and therefore could not understand nor\r\nsympathize with the joy of other people in color. Dalton tells the\r\nstory of a Quaker prominent in his sect who once went to town to buy a\r\ngray waistcoat and purchased instead one of bright red. When he\r\nappeared at meeting in this he was promptly tried for heresy and\r\nviolation of church regulations.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting tendency on the part of people who are\r\nthemselves defective in certain faculties of sensation, to conclude\r\nthat when other people are wrapt in admiration of something that they\r\ncannot perceive, it is because these other people have some mental\r\ndefect that leads them to enthuse too easily over their sensations. A\r\nstory is told of a newspaper man who used to insist that all that was\r\nsaid about the beauty of the song of birds was due to the vivid\r\nimagination of the writers, for he could find nothing to admire about\r\nthe songs of birds. He was placed in a room with a number of fine song\r\nbirds all round him and it proved that he could not hear any of the\r\nhigher notes at all. It was easy, then, to understand his condemnation\r\nof the enthusiasm of others as hysterical and imaginative. Nearly this\r\nsame thing is true of many quite intelligent people with regard to\r\nmusic. They hear ordinary sounds, as did the newspaper man, very well.\r\nThey are tone-deaf however, that is, they are quite unable to hear and\r\nappreciate combinations of sounds or even to catch melodious\r\nsuccessions of single notes. They cannot recognize one tune from\r\nanother and often do not know \"Yankee Doodle\" from the \"Doxology,\" or,\r\nat most, know only the most familiar tunes, but they set themselves up\r\nvery calmly as judges of the intellects of others and conclude that\r\nmusic lovers are really a hysterical set of people who go into\r\necstasies over certain quite insignificant sensations.\r\n\r\nThese interesting tendencies are helpful in enabling the physician to\r\nunderstand his patients better. They often serve as texts from which\r\nthe physician can explain curious things to patients who are prone to\r\ndraw wrong conclusions from them and often suggestions unfavorable to\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations and their discussion serve to make very clear the\r\ndistinction between illusions, delusions and hallucinations, which are\r\noften confounded. Illusions are deceptions of the senses. If a man\r\nwalking along a country road where he fears the presence of snakes\r\nsees in the gathering twilight a piece of rope coiled, he will almost\r\nsurely mistake it for a snake. This is an illusion produced by the\r\nconditions in which the object is seen. If walking along the same road\r\nthe next day, more timorous than ever as to snakes, he should see in\r\nbroad daylight the same coil of rope, he might in his fright not stay\r\nlong enough to decide whether it was a snake or not, and his illusion\r\nwould continue, though it would partake somewhat of the nature of a\r\ndelusion due to fright disturbing his judgment. If, in spite of\r\ncareful examination, however, of it, such as would satisfy any\r\nordinary mind that it was a coil of rope and not a snake, he should\r\nstill insist in believing that it was a snake, this would be a\r\ndelusion. There is always a mental element in delusions. If, having\r\nseen nothing, he should insist, owing to fright and {774} nervousness\r\nor to some other cause, that he sees a snake where there is nothing at\r\nall resembling a snake and where evidently whatever is the basis of\r\nhis idea of the presence of the snake, is within his own mind, then he\r\nis suffering from an hallucination.\r\n\r\nIllusions may be quite inevitable. Most of the optical illusions\r\ncontinue to appeal to us as truths even when we know that they\r\nrepresent errors of vision. In spite of the fact that we know that the\r\nsun and moon are not larger at the horizon than they are at the\r\nzenith, by optical illusion we continue to see them of larger size. It\r\nis our duty to correct such illusions by information gathered from\r\nother sources. To follow an illusion, that is, to give it credit, when\r\nwe should correct it, is a delusion. To think that because we cannot\r\nsee red that therefore there is no red, or because we do not hear the\r\nsounds of notes of birds that they do not utter any notes, in spite of\r\nthe fact that we have the testimony of nearly the whole human race to\r\nthe contrary, is a delusion. When, using the verb in its broadest\r\nsense, as \"perceive,\" we seem to see things very differently from the\r\ngenerality of people around us, there is every reason to suspect that\r\nthere is some specific or individual limitation of our senses which\r\nmakes us fail to perceive these things as others do. We have to\r\nsuspect our sources of information then and to correct them by what we\r\ncan learn from the experience of others. These are important\r\nconsiderations for many of the ideas that patients cherish with regard\r\nto themselves and their ills.\r\n\r\nHallucinations are entirely mental. But the phenomena that sometimes\r\nappear to be hallucinations may be due to illusions of the senses\r\nwithin the organism. For instance, those who indulge in cocaine often\r\nhave the feeling of having a veil over the face, or of having run into\r\na cobweb or something of that kind. The presence of the veil or the\r\ncobweb on the face is probably not an hallucination, but is due to\r\ncertain disturbances in the circulation, or perhaps in the nerves\r\nthemselves, which affect the nerve endings of the face, causing them\r\nto tingle in a particular way, and this sensation is translated as\r\ncoming from without in terms of something that has been felt before.\r\nSome of the appearances of _muscae volitantes_, or of specks before\r\nthe eyes, or occasionally of wavy lines, are due to disturbances of\r\nthe circulation within the eyeball which cause corresponding\r\ndisturbances of the optic nerve, with consequent apparent visions.\r\nWhen the eyeball is pressed upon, the sensation first produced is that\r\nof light and not of pain, because whenever a nerve of special sense is\r\nirritated, it produces its own specific sensation in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe chilly stage in malaria is a typical example of a physical\r\ncondition having an effect upon sensory nerves that more or less\r\nnecessarily produces a delusion. The patient is actually at the height\r\nof his fever when the chilliness and shivering come on and when he\r\ndemands a larger amount of covers in order to protect himself from the\r\ncold he will often have a temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or\r\neven higher. What has happened is that the little blood vessels at the\r\nsurface of the body are shut up by the effect of the plasmodium upon\r\nthe system. Whenever we are cold these little blood vessels shut up in\r\norder to protect the blood from being chilled by the external\r\natmosphere. The shutting up of the little blood vessels deprives, for\r\nthe time being, the terminal nerves in the neighborhood of some of\r\ntheir nourishment. Their response is to set up a tremor or shivering,\r\nwhich will mechanically tend {775} to open the blood vessels so that\r\nthey may have their nourishment once more. Whenever we have a set of\r\nsensations that correspond to this connected set of events, we\r\ntranslate them as feeling cold. The outer air does feel cold to the\r\nbody because the blood is not flowing through to the surface as it\r\nwould normally in order to warm it. Hence the chilliness. This is not\r\nan hallucination; but an illusion with something of a delusion in it;\r\nuntil we know how things are. Nervousness may set our teeth chattering\r\njust as it may cause tremor through our sympathetic nervous system,\r\ndisturbing the flow of blood through muscles and so disturbing control\r\nof them. Vehement emotion, anger, fright, and even those of less\r\nviolence may cause similar effects. All these phenomena illustrate the\r\nclose relation between mind and body.\r\n\r\n{776}\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion and psychotherapy have, of late, come to have many relations\r\nto each other and many interests in common, at least in the minds of a\r\nnumber of clergymen, and in popular estimation. There is no doubt but\r\nthat religion can do much to soothe troubled men and women, even when\r\ntheir troubles are entirely physical in nature and origin. It at least\r\nlessens the unfavorable effect of worry in exaggerating such\r\npathological processes as are at work. All diseases, functional and\r\norganic, are rendered worse by solicitude, while many troublesome\r\nsymptoms become quite bearable if only the patient does not dwell on\r\nthem too much but takes them as they come, carefully refraining from\r\nemphasizing them by over-attention. That is the very essence of\r\npsychotherapy. Religion, in the sense of trust in divine wisdom, can\r\ndo much to originate and maintain this imperturbed frame of mind.\r\nPeople who are without religion, that is, without the feeling that\r\nsomehow all their ills are a part of the great plan of the universe,\r\nthe mystery of which is insoluble, but the recognition of which is\r\ndemanded by reason, and who lack the assurance that somehow, in\r\nBrowning's phrase:\r\n\r\n  \"God's in His Heaven-\r\n  All's right with the world!\"\r\n\r\n-- are more prone to give way to over-anxiety and consequently to make\r\nthemselves suffer more in all their ills, than is necessary or even\r\nlikely in the more favorable state of mind of those whose trust in\r\nProvidence is thorough and efficient.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been in the general population a distinct\r\nloss of faith in the great religious truths that are so helpful in\r\nengendering a peaceful state of mind in suffering. Many have come, if\r\nnot to doubt of the Providence of the Creator, at least to feel that\r\nwe do not know enough about it to place any such supreme dependence on\r\nit in the trials of life as would make it a source of relief, or at\r\nleast consolation, in suffering. This same spirit of doubt has\r\nparalyzed faith in the hereafter and in all that trust in it brings,\r\nto sufferers, of consolation to come for their ills if these are borne\r\nas becomes rational creatures whose suffering has a purpose, though we\r\nmay not comprehend it. Some people are destined by their physical\r\nmake-up or by accidental conditions to considerable suffering. There\r\nare many ailments that are incurable and are definitely known to be\r\nincurable. Some of these entail great suffering of body and even more\r\nsuffering of mind. Such suffering becomes quite unbearable unless the\r\npatient is of a very stoic disposition, or unless the thought of a\r\nhereafter in which the sufferings of this life will have a meaning is\r\npresent to console.\r\n\r\n{777}\r\n\r\nGreat scientists in the midst of all our advance in science--one need\r\nbut mention here such men as Lord Kelvin, Clerk Maxwell, Johann\r\nMueller, Laennec, Pasteur, Claude Bernard, though the number might\r\neasily be multiplied--have insisted that the existence of a Creator is\r\nabsolutely demanded by what we know of the physical universe. \"Science\r\ndemonstrates the existence of a Creator,\" is Lord Kelvin's expression.\r\nThe existence of a Creator implies, also, the existence of laws made\r\nby Him, by which His universe is regulated in every detail, nothing\r\nbeing left to chance. Chance is indeed only a term which indicates\r\nthat we do not know the causes at work. If somehow the Creator's power\r\nhas been sufficient to bring the manifold things of the universe into\r\nexistence according to a plan in which there is no such interference\r\nwith one another as would cause serious disturbance of the universal\r\norder around us, then He can be trusted also to care for even the\r\nminutest details of creation and of human life.\r\n\r\nIn the gradual disintegration of the religious sense which has come as\r\na consequence of certain materialistic tendencies in nineteenth\r\ncentury education and science, these religious sources of consolation\r\nhave been shut off from a great many people. They have come to the\r\nfeeling of being portions of a machine that moves hopelessly on,\r\nsomehow, on the old principle, \"The mills of the gods grind slow, but\r\nthey grind exceeding fine.\" The sufferings of humanity then, are, for\r\nthese people, only a portion of a great universe of suffering that is\r\nconstantly going on but for which they can see no reason and no\r\npurpose. Lucretius's lines which make human sufferings the butt of the\r\njokes of the gods who look gleefully on from their Elysian happiness,\r\nwould represent the feelings of these doubters better than any\r\nreligious expression. We have come back in this age, when evolution\r\nhas so much influenced the thought of the time, after the curious\r\ncyclic fashion in which human thought repeats itself from era to era,\r\nto the attitude of mind of the old Roman poet who almost singly among\r\nhis contemporaries, had been deeply affected by the same doctrine of\r\nevolution. The pessimism he was prone to as to the significance of\r\nhuman life has become once more the fashion.\r\n\r\nSuch pessimistic thoughts do not come, as a rule, while people are in\r\ngood health, but they assert themselves with double emphasis in\r\nmoments of trial and suffering. Lucretius himself is said to have\r\ncommitted suicide. The result of the diffusion of this materialistic\r\npessimism in our time has been a gradual preparation for a revulsion\r\nof feeling in many minds. One manifestation of this reaction has been\r\nseen in a form of religion which denies entirely the existence of\r\nevil. God the Creator is good and therefore there can be no evil in\r\nHis world. Whatever of evil there is, is only due to man's failure to\r\nsee the entirety of things. Evil is an error of mortal mind--only that\r\nand nothing more. In spite of the manifest absurdity of the underlying\r\nprinciple, if people can only be brought to persuade themselves that\r\nthere is no such thing as evil or suffering, then many of their\r\ndiscomforts disappear, all of their symptoms grow less and a sense of\r\nwell-being results. It is, indeed, surprising how many even physical\r\nills will be relieved by this state of mind if sincerely accepted. It\r\nis the highest possible tribute to psychotherapy and the curative\r\ninfluence of mind over body.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of this revulsion of feeling has been the institution of\r\na church movement that would make sufferers realize once more all the\r\n{778} consolations there are in religion. The sufferer is brought to a\r\nrenewed lively sense of the presence of the Creator in the universe\r\nand of His care for His creatures. The great purpose of suffering in\r\nmaking people better and stripping them of their meanness and\r\nselfishness is brought out. Anyone who has ever had called to his\r\nattention the difference between two brothers, one of whom has been\r\nchastened by suffering above which he has risen by character\r\ndevelopment, and another who has enjoyed good health and prosperity\r\nall his life, will realize how much of good suffering means in the\r\nworld. Pain is not in itself an evil, but a warning, and most of the\r\ntrials of life can rather readily be shown to partake of this\r\ncharacter. A man who can be made to submit himself, then, to the will\r\nof the Creator and be persuaded to acknowledge that somehow we must\r\ntry to work out our part in the great scheme of things behind which\r\nthe Creator stands, is somewhat like the soldier ready even when tired\r\nand worn out, to go in on a forlorn hope, because he has confidence\r\nthat he is executing a part of the plan of his general for his\r\ncountry's welfare, though he does not know how, and he is quite well\r\naware that it is going to cost him much in pain and suffering, and\r\nperhaps his life.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that an abiding sense of religion does much for\r\npeople in the midst of their ailments and, above all, keeps them from\r\ndeveloping those symptoms due to nervous worry and solicitude which so\r\noften are more annoying to the patient than the actual sufferings he\r\nor she may have to bear. While religion is often said to predispose to\r\ncertain mental troubles, it is now well appreciated by psychiatrists\r\nthat it is not religion that has the tendency to disturb the mind, but\r\na disequilibrated mind has a tendency to exaggerate out of all reason\r\nits interests in anything that it takes up seriously. Whether the\r\nobject of the attention be business, or pleasure, or sexuality, or\r\nreligion, the unbalanced mind pays too much attention to it, becomes\r\ntoo exclusively occupied with it, and this over-indulgence helps to\r\nform a vicious circle of unfavorable influence. While many people in\r\ntheir insanity, then, show exaggerated interest in religion, this is\r\nonly like other exaggerated interests of the disequilibrated, and\r\nreligion itself is not the cause but only a coincidence in the matter.\r\n\r\nClouston, in his book on \"Unsoundness of Mind\" (Methuen, London,\r\n1911), put this very well when he said, \"It is true that religion,\r\ntouching as it does, in the most intense way the emotional nature, and\r\nthe spiritual instincts of mankind, sometimes appears to cause and is\r\noften mixed up with insanity. But in nearly all such cases the brain\r\nof the individual was originally unstable, specially emotional,\r\nover-sensitive, hyperconscientious, and often somewhat weak in the\r\nintellectual and inhibitory faculties and, if looked for, other causes\r\nwill usually be found.\" He had said just before, \"To talk of\r\n'religious insanity' as if it were a definite and definable form is in\r\nmy judgment a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there is now a growing conviction that a deep\r\nreligious feeling, a sense of dependence on and trust in the Almighty,\r\nwill do more than anything else to keep people from those neurotic\r\nmanifestations which so often are seen in our day and are growing more\r\nand more frequent as life becomes more strenuous and more attention is\r\npaid to the material side of things, to the exclusion of the\r\nspiritual. How true this is may be judged from expressions that have\r\nbeen used in recent years by well-known specialists in {779} nervous\r\ndiseases and in psychology. These have included men who were often not\r\nbelievers in religion themselves but who recognized its influence for\r\ngood for others. Such expressions are to be found in the writings of\r\nmen of every nationality. Not infrequently, in spite of their own\r\nreligious affiliation, they acknowledge what a profound influence\r\ncertain forms of religion have over people. These testimonies have\r\nbeen multiplying in our medical literature in recent years, because\r\napparently physicians have come to appreciate much better by contrast\r\nthe influence for good of religion over some of their patients, since\r\nso many of the sufferers from nervous diseases they see have not this\r\nsource of consolation to recur to.\r\n\r\nIn America we have a number of such testimonies. In his \"Self Help for\r\nNervous Women\" Dr. John K. Mitchell of Philadelphia, who may be taken\r\nto represent in this matter the Philadelphia School of Neurologists,\r\nto which his father has lent such distinction, said:\r\n\r\n  It is certainly true that considering as examples two such widely\r\n  separated forms of religious belief as the Orthodox Jews and the\r\n  strict Roman Catholics, one does not see as many patients from them\r\n  as from their numbers might be expected, especially when it is\r\n  remembered that Jews as a whole are very nervous people and that the\r\n  Roman Church includes in this country among its members numbers of\r\n  the most emotional race in the world.\r\n\r\n  Of only one sect can I recall no example. It is not in my memory\r\n  that a professing Quaker ever came into my hands to be treated for\r\n  nervousness. If the opinion I have already stated so often is\r\n  correct, namely that want of control of the emotions and the\r\n  over-expression of the feelings are prime causes of nervousness,\r\n  then the fact that discipline of the emotions is a lesson early and\r\n  constantly taught by the Friends, would help to account for the\r\n  infrequency of this disorder among them and adds emphasis to the\r\n  belief in such a causation.\r\n\r\nProf. Muensterberg, who may be fairly taken to represent the German\r\nschool, but whose long years of residence in America have made him a\r\ncosmopolitan, is quite as positive in his declaration of the place\r\nthat religion may hold in making human suffering less. In his\r\n\"Psychotherapy\" he devotes considerable attention to the subject. The\r\nreligious discipline, that is, the training of human beings from their\r\nearliest years to recognize that there is a higher law than their own\r\nfeelings and that they must suppress many of their desires and take\r\nevil as it comes as a portion of human life, is of itself, he insists,\r\nan excellent preparation to enable the individual to bear up under the\r\nphysical and mental trials of life and to make many symptoms that\r\nwould otherwise be almost intolerable, quite bearable. It is from\r\nearliest years that this training must make itself felt, and Prof.\r\nMuensterberg insists that from early childhood the self-control has to\r\nbe strong and the child has to learn from the beginning to know the\r\nlimits to the gratification of his desires and to abstain from\r\nreckless self-indulgence. A good conscience, he says, a congenial home\r\nand a serious purpose, are, after all, the safest conditions for a\r\nhealthy man, and the community does effective work in preventive\r\npsychotherapy whenever it facilitates the securing of these factors.\r\n\r\nSelf-denial has always been one of the main elements of religious\r\ntraining, and indeed was declared a chief source of merit for the\r\nhereafter. The modern psychotherapeutist, however, preaches\r\nself-denial almost as strenuously as the religious minister of the\r\nolden time, only now not for any religious {780} merit or reward, but\r\nbecause it makes life more pleasant and by that much happier. When men\r\nand women have learned to deny themselves in their younger years, it\r\nis not hard to stand even pain when they grow older, and pain is\r\ninevitable in every human life and the training to stand it is\r\ntherefore worth while. Pain borne with equanimity is lessened by\r\none-half if not in its intensity then at least in its power to\r\ndisturb, and since religion will do this it possesses an important\r\nremedial value. Here is where religion is particularly valuable and\r\nthe passing of it from many minds has thrown them back on themselves\r\nand left them without profound interests, so that they occupy\r\nthemselves overmuch with the trivial incidents of life within them and\r\ndisturb the course of many of their functions by giving exaggerated\r\nthought to them. Religion adds a great purpose to life and such a\r\npurpose keeps men and women to a great extent from being disturbed\r\nabout trifles.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be too bad if religion should do no more than\r\nthis. This, however, is the only phase of it with which we are\r\nconcerned here. We may think very strongly with Prof. Muensterberg,\r\nthat it would be quite wrong to assign to it only this place in life.\r\nHe says: \"The meaning of religion in life is entirely too deep that it\r\nshould be employed merely for the purpose of lessening the pains and\r\naches of humanity and the dreads that are so often more imaginary than\r\nreal.\" He insists that \"It cheapens religion by putting the accent of\r\nits meaning in life on personal comfort and absence of pain.\" He adds,\r\n\"If there is one power in life which ought to develop in us a\r\nconviction that pleasure is not the highest goal and that pain is not\r\nthe worst evil, then it ought to be philosophy and religion.\"\r\nPresent-day movements, however, tend to subordinate religion to\r\nthis-worldliness rather than to other-worldliness, and by just that\r\nmuch they take out of religion its real significance. We are here on\r\ntrial for another world is the thought that in the past strengthened\r\nmen to bear all manner of ills, if not with equanimity, at least\r\nwithout exaggerated reaction. It has still the power to do so for all\r\nthose who accept it simply and sincerely.\r\n\r\n{781}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdominal discomfort, 302;\r\n  from coffee, 306;\r\n  from tea, 30;\r\n
