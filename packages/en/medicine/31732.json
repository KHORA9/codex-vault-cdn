THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM THE\r\nEDITOR'S FOREWORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have come across so much rubbish on this subject that we drifted\r\ninto the conclusion that an honest sex essay for young folks would\r\nnot be produced by this generation.\r\n\r\nRecently there came to this desk a manuscript bearing the title _The\r\nSex Side of Life_ and the sub-title _An Explanation for Young\r\nPeople_, written by Mary Ware Dennett. No editor ever confesses that\r\nhe reads an article with prejudice, but we will admit that we\r\nexpected this MS would be \"returned with thanks.\" It was reasonable\r\nto suppose that a laywoman would not succeed where physicians had\r\nfailed. Even after we had read the introduction we were not\r\nconvinced, for we have met several books whose texts do not fulfill\r\nthe promises made by the preface. But after reading a few pages of\r\nthe essay itself, we realized we were listening to the music of a\r\ndifferent drummer. Instead of the familiar notes of fear and\r\npretense, we were surprised to hear the clarion call of truth.\r\n\r\nMary Ware Dennett's _Sex Side of Life_ is \"on the level.\" In the\r\npages of the _Medical Review of Reviews_, her essay will reach only\r\nthe profession, but we sincerely hope that this splendid contribution\r\nwill be reprinted in pamphlet form and distributed by thousands to\r\nthe general public. We are tolerably familiar with Anglo-American\r\nwritings on sexology, but we know nothing that equals Mrs. Dennett's\r\nbrochure. Physicians and social workers are frequently asked: \"What\r\nshall I say to my growing child?\" Mary Ware Dennett, in her rational\r\nsex primer, at last furnishes a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n  V. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEX SIDE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION FOR ELDERS\r\n\r\nIn reading several dozen books on sex matters for the young with a\r\nview to selecting the best for my own children, I found none that I\r\nwas willing to put into their hands, without first guarding them\r\nagainst what I considered very misleading and harmful impressions,\r\nwhich they would otherwise be sure to acquire in reading them. That\r\nis the excuse for this article.\r\n\r\nIt is far more specific than most sex information written for young\r\npeople. I believe we owe it to children to be specific if we talk\r\nabout the subject at all.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful observation of youthful curiosity and a very vivid\r\nrecollection of my own childhood, I have tried to explain frankly the\r\npoints about which there is the greatest inquiry. These points are\r\n_not_ frankly or clearly explained in most sex literature. They are\r\navoided, partly from embarrassment, but more, apparently, because\r\nthose who have undertaken to instruct the children are not really\r\nclear in their own minds as to the proper status of the sex relation.\r\n\r\nI found that from the physiological point of view, the question was\r\nhandled with limitations and reservations. From the point of natural\r\nscience it was often handled with sentimentality, the child being led\r\nfrom a semi-esthetic study of the reproduction of flowers and animals\r\nto the acceptance of a similar idea for human beings. From the moral\r\npoint of view it was handled least satisfactorily of all, the child\r\nbeing given a jumble of conflicting ideas, with no means of\r\ncorrelating them,--fear of venereal disease, one's duty to suppress\r\n\"animal passion,\" the sacredness of marriage, and so forth. And from\r\nthe emotional point of view, the subject was not handled at all.\r\n\r\nThis one omission seems to me to be the key to the whole situation,\r\nand it is the basis of the radical departure I have made from the\r\nprecedents in most sex literature for children.\r\n\r\nConcerning all four points of view just mentioned, there are certain\r\ndepartures from the traditional method that have seemed to me worth\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nOn the physiological side I have given, as far as possible, the\r\nproper terminology for the sex organs and functions. Children have\r\nhad to read the expurgated literature which has been specially\r\nprepared for them in poetic or colloquial terms, and then are\r\nneedlessly mystified when they hear things called by their real\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nOn the side of natural science, I have emphasized our unlikeness to\r\nthe plants and animals rather than our likeness, for while the points\r\nwe have in common with the lower orders make an interesting section\r\nin our general education, it is knowing about the vital points in\r\nwhich we differ that helps us to solve the sexual problems of\r\nmaturity; and the child needs that knowledge precisely as he needs\r\nknowledge of everything which will fortify him for wise decisions\r\nwhen he is grown.\r\n\r\nOn the moral side, I have tried to avoid confusion and dogmatism in\r\nthe following ways: by eliminating fear of venereal disease as an\r\nappeal for strictly limited sex relations, stating candidly that\r\nvenereal disease _is_ becoming curable; by barring out all mention of\r\n\"brute\" or \"animal\" passion, terms frequently used in pleas for\r\nchastity and self control, as such talk is an aspersion on the brutes\r\nand has done children much harm in giving them the impression that\r\nthere is an essential baseness in the sex relation; by inviting the\r\ninference that marriage is \"sacred\" by virtue of its being a\r\nreflection of human ideality rather than because it is a legalized\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the stress which most writers have laid upon the\r\nbeauty of nature's plans for perpetuating the plant and animal\r\nspecies, and the effort to have the child carry over into human life\r\nsome sense of that beauty has come from a most commendable instinct\r\nto protect the child from the natural shock of the revelation of so\r\nmuch that is unesthetic and revolting in human sex life. The nearness\r\nof the sex organs to the excretory organs, the pain and messiness of\r\nchildbirth are elements which certainly need some compensating\r\nantidote to prevent their making too disagreeable and\r\ndisproportionate an impress on the child's mind.\r\n\r\nThe results are doubtless good as far as they go, but they do not go\r\nnearly far enough. What else is there to call upon to help out? Why,\r\nthe one thing which has been persistently neglected by practically\r\nall the sex writers,--the emotional side of sex experience. Parents\r\nand teachers have been afraid of it and distrustful of it. In not a\r\nsingle one of all the books for young people that I have thus far\r\nread has there been the frank, unashamed declaration that the climax\r\nof sex emotion is an unsurpassed joy, something which rightly belongs\r\nto every normal human being, a joy to be proudly and serenely\r\nexperienced. Instead there has been all too evident an inference that\r\nsex emotion is a thing to be ashamed of, that yielding to it is\r\nindulgence which must be curbed as much as possible, that all thought\r\nand understanding of it must be rigorously postponed, at any rate\r\ntill after marriage.\r\n\r\nWe give to young folks, in their general education, as much as they\r\ncan grasp of science and ethics and art, and yet in their sex\r\neducation, which rightly has to do with all of these, we have said,\r\n\"Give them only the bare physiological facts, lest they be\r\nprematurely stimulated.\" Others of us, realizing that the bare\r\nphysiological facts are shocking to many a sensitive child, and must\r\nsomehow be softened with something pleasant, have said, \"Give them\r\nthe facts, yes, but see to it that they are so related to the wonders\r\nof evolution and the beauties of the natural world that the shock is\r\nminimized.\" But none of us has yet dared to say, \"Yes, give them the\r\nfacts, give them the nature study, too, but also give them some\r\nconception of sex life as a vivifying joy, as a vital art, as a thing\r\nto be studied and developed with reverence for its big meaning, with\r\nunderstanding of its far-reaching reactions, psychologically and\r\nspiritually, with temperant restraint, good taste and the highest\r\nidealism.\" We have contented ourselves by assuming that marriage\r\nmakes sex relations respectable. We have not yet said that it is only\r\nbeautiful sex relations that can make marriage lovely.\r\n\r\nYoung people are just as capable of being guided and inspired in\r\ntheir thought about sex emotion as in their taste and ideals in\r\nliterature and ethics, and just as they imperatively need to have\r\ntheir general taste and ideals cultivated as a preparation for mature\r\nlife, so do they need to have some understanding of the marvelous\r\nplace which sex emotion has in life.\r\n\r\nOnly such an understanding can be counted on to give them the self\r\ncontrol that is born of knowledge, not fear, the reverence that will\r\nprevent premature or trivial connections, the good taste and finesse\r\nthat will make their sex life when they reach maturity a vitalizing\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPLANATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\r\n\r\nWhen boys and girls get into their \"teens,\" a side of them begins to\r\nwake up which has been asleep or only partly developed ever since\r\nthey were born, that is, the sex side of them. It is the most\r\nwonderful and interesting part of growing up. This waking is partly\r\nof the mind, partly of the body and partly of the feelings or\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nYou can't help wanting to understand all about it, but somehow you\r\nfind yourself a little embarrassed in asking all the questions that\r\ncome into your mind, and often you don't feel quite like talking\r\nabout it freely, even to your father and mother. Sometimes it is\r\neasier to talk with your best friends, because they are your own age,\r\nand are beginning to have these new feelings too.\r\n\r\nBut remember that young people don't know nearly so much about it as\r\nolder people do, and that the older ones really want to help you with\r\ntheir experience and advice; and yet, they, like you, often feel\r\nrather embarrassed themselves and don't know how to go about it I\r\nsuppose it is because it is all so very personal and still remains\r\nsomewhat mysterious, in spite of all that people know about it.\r\n\r\nIf our bodies were just like machines, then we could learn about them\r\nand manage them quite scientifically as we do automobiles, but they\r\nare not like that. They are more than machines that have to be\r\nsupplied with fuel (food) and kept clean and oiled (by bathing,\r\nexercise and sleep). They are the homes of our souls and our\r\nfeelings, and that makes all the difference in the world in the way\r\nwe act, and it makes what we have to learn, not limited to science\r\nonly, but it has to include more difficult and complicated things\r\nlike psychology and morality.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can't make this article help you, but I remember so well what\r\nI wanted to know and how I felt when I was young that I am now going\r\nto try. And I will tell you to start out with that there is a great\r\ndeal that nobody knows yet, in spite of the fact that the human race\r\nhas been struggling thousands of years to learn.\r\n\r\nLife itself is still a mystery, especially human life. Human life, in\r\nmany respects, is like plant and animal life, but in many ways it is\r\nentirely different, and the ways in which it is different are almost\r\nmore important for us to think about than the ways in which it is\r\nsimilar. In all life, except in the very lowest forms, new life is\r\ncreated by the coming together, in a very close and special way, of\r\nthe male and female elements. You have studied at school about the\r\nplants and you probably have observed certain of the animals, so you\r\nknow something about what this means if you do not understand it\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nBut what you want to know most of all is just how it is with human\r\nbeings. You want to know just what this coming together is, how it is\r\ndone, how it starts the new life, the baby, and how the baby is born.\r\nYou want to understand the wonderful sex organs, that are different\r\nin men and women, what each part is for and how it works.\r\n\r\nIf you feel very curious and excited and shy about it, don't let\r\nyourself be a bit worried or ashamed. Your feelings are quite\r\nnatural, and most everybody else has felt just the same way at your\r\nage. Remember that strong feelings are immensely valuable to us. All\r\nwe need to do is to steer them in the right direction and keep them\r\nwell balanced and proportioned.\r\n\r\nNow in order to understand something of why this subject stirs us so,\r\nwe must notice in what ways we human beings are _different_ from the\r\nplants and animals. About the lowest form of life is the amoeba. It\r\nlooks like a little lump of jelly, and it produces its young by\r\nmerely separating itself in two. One part drifts off from the other\r\npart and each becomes a separate live being. There is no male and no\r\nfemale and they didn't _know_ they were doing it. In the plants a\r\nhigher stage of development is reached: there is the male and the\r\nfemale and they join together, not by coming to each other, or\r\nbecause they _know_ they belong together, but quite unconsciously,\r\nwith the aid of the bees and other insects and the wind, the male\r\npart is carried to the female part--they mix, and at once the seed of\r\na new plant begins to grow.\r\n\r\nThen come to the animals. In all higher forms of animal life, the\r\nmale creature _comes_ to the female creature and himself places\r\nwithin her body the germ which, when it meets the egg which is\r\nwaiting for it, immediately makes a new life begin to grow. But the\r\nanimals come together without _knowing why_. They do it from instinct\r\nonly, and they do it in what is called the mating season, which is\r\nusually in the spring. The mating season happens once a year among\r\nmost of the higher animals, like birds and wild cattle, but to some\r\nanimals it comes several times a year like the rabbits, for instance.\r\nYou doubtless know already that the more highly developed the animal,\r\nthe longer it takes the young one to grow before it is born, and the\r\nlonger the period when it is helpless to provide its own food and\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nNow we come to human beings, and see how different they are! They\r\nhave no regular mating season, and while there is a certain amount of\r\ninstinct in men and women which tends to bring them together, the sex\r\nimpulse among highly developed people is far more the result of their\r\nfeeling of love for each other than mere animal instinct alone. Many\r\nof the animals make no choice at all in their mating. Any near-by\r\nfemale will do for the male. But among some of the higher animals the\r\nmale has a special instinct for a certain female, and the female will\r\nnot tolerate any but a certain male. Most of the animals have\r\ndifferent mates every season, though there are a few kinds where the\r\nmale and female, once having mated, remain mates for years, sometimes\r\neven for life. But it is _only human beings_ whose mating is what we\r\ncall \"falling in love,\" and that is an experience far beyond anything\r\nthat the animals know.\r\n\r\nIt means that a man and a woman feel that they _belong_ to each other\r\nin a way that they belong to no one else; it makes them wonderfully\r\nhappy to be together; they find they want to live together, work\r\ntogether, play together, and to have children together, that is, to\r\nmarry each other; and their dream is to be happy together all their\r\nlives. Sometimes the dream does not come true, and there is much\r\nfailure and unhappiness, but just the same people go right on trying\r\nto make it a success, because it is what they care most for.\r\n\r\nThe sex attraction is the strongest feeling that human beings know,\r\nand unlike the animals, it is far more than a mere sensation of the\r\nbody. It takes in the emotions and the mind and the soul, and that is\r\nwhy our happiness is so dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen a man and a woman fall in love so that they really belong to\r\neach other, the physical side of the relation is this: both of them\r\nfeel at intervals a peculiar thrill or glow, particularly in the\r\nsexual organs, and it naturally culminates after they have gone to\r\nbed at night. The man's special sex organ or penis, becomes enlarged\r\nand stiffened, instead of soft and limp as ordinarily, and thus it\r\neasily enters the passage in the woman's body called the vagina or\r\nbirth-canal, which leads to the uterus or womb, which as perhaps you\r\nalready know is the sac in which the egg or embryo grows into a baby.\r\nThe penis and the vagina are about the same size, as Nature intended\r\nthem to fit each other. By a rhythmic movement of the penis in and\r\nout, the sex act reaches an exciting climax or orgasm, when there is\r\nfor the woman a peculiarly satisfying contraction of the muscles of\r\nthe passage and for the man, the expulsion of the semen, the liquid\r\nwhich contains the germs of life. This is followed by a sensation of\r\npeaceful happiness and sleepy relaxation. It is the very greatest\r\nphysical pleasure to be had in all human experience, and it helps\r\nvery much to increase all other kinds of pleasure also. It is at this\r\ntime that married people not only are closest to each other\r\nphysically, but they feel closer to each other in every other way\r\ntoo. It is then most of all that they feel _sure_ they belong to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe sex act is called by various names, such as coitus, coition,\r\ncopulation, cohabitation, sex-intercourse, the sex-embrace, etc. But\r\nall these terms refer to the same thing. The first coitus is apt to\r\nbe somewhat painful for the woman, as there is usually a thin\r\nmembrane, called the hymen, partly closing the vagina which has to be\r\nbroken through, but all women do not have it and it varies in size\r\nand thickness with different people.\r\n\r\nWithout the sex act, no babies could be created, for it is by this\r\nmeans only that the semen which contains the male part of the germ of\r\nlife can meet the ovum or the female part of the germ of life. When\r\nthe two parts come together in the woman's body under just the right\r\nconditions, a baby begins to grow--at first so tiny that it could\r\nhardly be seen without a microscope, and finally, after nine months'\r\ngrowth in the uterus or womb of the mother till it weighs about seven\r\nor eight pounds, it is born, a live human being. The birth process is\r\ncalled _labor_, and it is indeed labor, for it usually means much\r\npain and struggle for the mother, although the baby's journey from\r\nthe uterus to the world is only a few inches. It takes anywhere from\r\nan hour to two days for a baby to be born. Doctors are learning more\r\nand more how to lessen the pain, and by the end of another generation\r\nit ought to be possible for child-birth to be practically painless\r\nfor most women. By that time people will more generally understand\r\nhow to have babies _only_ when they want them and can afford them. At\r\npresent, unfortunately, it is against the law to give people\r\ninformation as to how to manage their sex relations so that no baby\r\nwill be created unless the father and mother are ready and glad to\r\nhave it happen.\r\n\r\nNow you must understand something about this intricate sexual\r\nmachinery. Plate I shows the woman's organs and Plate 2 the man's.\r\nBoth these illustrations are sections, as if the body were cut in two\r\nvertically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: *Plate One*]\r\n\r\n1. Backbone.\r\n\r\n2. Rectum, which carries away the solid waste matter from the bowels.\r\n\r\n3. Anus, the opening of the rectum.\r\n\r\n4. Bladder, which holds the waste water or urine.\r\n\r\n5.

Seminal Vesicle.\r\n\r\nBoth 10 and 11 secrete liquids that make part of the semen, and which\r\nnourish the spermatozoa.\r\n\r\n12. Urethra, which carries the spermatozoa, also the urine.\r\n\r\n13. Cowper's Gland, which secretes a liquid which makes the urethra\r\nalkaline.\r\n\r\n14. One of the spermatozoa, or germs of life, much magnified.\r\n\r\nSometimes it seems very distasteful to us that the sex or generative\r\norgans should be placed so near to what we might call our \"sewerage\r\nsystem.\" We do not like to have to connect in our thought anything so\r\nsweet and nice as a baby or so happy and precious as the sex embrace\r\nwith the waste of our bodies, which we want to be rid of with as\r\nlittle thought as possible, as it is disagreeable at best, and we\r\nwonder why we were created this way. But we have to remember that the\r\nsex organs are very delicate and they are probably placed where they\r\ncan best be protected from injury. It would be hard to think of any\r\nother part of the body that would be safer than just this place. At\r\nany rate there they are, and our duty is to understand them as best\r\nwe can, and take mighty good care of them as our most wonderful\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nLooking at Plate I, you will see that the woman's body provides the\r\negg or ovum. These grow, many thousands of them, in two small sacs\r\ncalled ovaries, and every little while (usually every four weeks, but\r\nnot always) an ovum ripens and passes out from the ovary through the\r\nfallopian tube (there are two of these, one leading from each ovary)\r\ninto the uterus or womb, a process which takes several days. Here it\r\nmay be met by the male life element, and if so, it becomes fertilized\r\nand remains in the uterus to grow into a baby. This is called\r\nfertilization, fecundation, impregnation or conception. But if the\r\negg is not fertilized, it passes from the uterus through the vagina\r\nand out of the body. The ovaries take turns in developing the ovum.\r\n\r\nEvery twenty-eight days or so a woman, from the time she is about\r\nthirteen or fourteen till she is about fifty, has a slight flow of\r\nblood from the uterus, which is called menstruation. The reasons for\r\nthis are not wholly understood, but it is supposed there is an extra\r\nsupply of blood provided periodically for the growth of a baby, but\r\nwhen there is no baby starting to grow, the blood is not needed so it\r\nflows away (about once in four weeks). Often the unfertilized ovum is\r\ncarried away with it, but the two things do not necessarily happen at\r\nthe same time. Menstruation lasts from three to five days and young\r\ngirls sometimes have pain then and feel languid and \"unwell.\" If so\r\nthey should be quieter than usual and avoid cold baths and getting\r\ntheir feet wet. But menstruation is not an illness, and a girl in\r\nperfect health finds it only a slight inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe ovaries not only produce the egg, but they also produce a\r\nsecretion that is absorbed by the blood and which is most necessary\r\nin the development of a girl into a woman. It has an almost magical\r\neffect in adding the specially womanly qualities to the body and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLooking at Plate 2, you will see the man's sex machinery. The\r\ntesticles are to a man what the ovaries are to a woman. They are two\r\nsacs held in a bag of rather thin loose skin called the scrotum, and\r\nit is here that the sperm (spermatozoa) or germ of life grows. Just\r\nhow no one really knows. The spermatozoa are very tiny and the\r\ntesticles hold many thousands of them. Under the microscope they show\r\na sort of head and tail like a pollywog. They are very much alive and\r\nmove by a rapid wiggling of the tail part.\r\n\r\nLeading from each testicle is a tube called the vas deferens, through\r\nwhich the sperm goes at the time of the sex act on its way out to\r\nmeet the ovum in the woman's body. On the way it is joined by two\r\nother liquids, one secreted by the seminal vesicles (of which there\r\nare two) and the other by the prostate gland. These three liquids\r\ntogether form the semen, which at the times of sexual excitement is\r\nforced out through the penis into the vagina of the woman.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the woman has separate tubes for the urine\r\n(waste water) and the sex function, but the man uses the same tube\r\nfor both: that is, in the woman the bladder which holds the urine is\r\nemptied by a separate tube, the urethra, while in the man the urethra\r\nnot only empties the bladder, but it also carries the semen.\r\n\r\nThe use of the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland is to supply a\r\nmeans of nourishment for the spermatozoa until they reach the ovum,\r\nwhich may not be for several days after the semen is expelled into\r\nthe vagina.\r\n\r\nThen there are two small glands called Cowper's glands, which make\r\nthe passage in the penis alkaline, as the spermatozoa can only remain\r\nalive in an alkaline secretion and the urine is acid, so always just\r\nbefore the penis forces out the semen, the secretion from Cowper's\r\nglands goes ahead to protect the sperm from being destroyed by any\r\nremaining traces of the acid urine.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the penis is a fold or cap of skin, the prepuce, which\r\nthe doctor often removes for the sake of the boy's health, a process\r\ncalled circumcision, and it is a great relief to boys whose prepuce\r\nor foreskin is too tight as to make difficulty in keeping clean. All\r\nJewish babies are regularly circumcised, a custom dating way back to\r\nBible times.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant internal secretion from the testicles of a man\r\njust as from the ovaries of a woman, and it has the same beneficial\r\neffect on the whole being. It makes a boy what we call manly or\r\nvirile. The value of the internal secretions of the sex organs in\r\nboth boys and girls is so great that for that reason, if for no\r\nother, the whole sex machinery must be kept in perfect health.\r\n\r\nBoys have a certain discomfort to bear which is difficult for them\r\njust as menstruation is difficult for girls. But by knowing the\r\nmeaning of things and by taking care of themselves, they need not be\r\nseriously troubled by it. Every once in a while as they are growing\r\nup, but before they are old enough to really fall in love and marry\r\nand have children, boys feel a sort of stirring of the sex\r\norgans--sometimes so much so that it makes them quite uneasy and\r\nanxious for relief. The thing to do is to keep as calm as possible\r\nand keep very busy and very healthy. Then the discomfort will not be\r\ntoo great, and nature will usually bring relief by letting the\r\naccumulated semen pass off during sleep. This is called a seminal\r\nemission, and is perfectly harmless. Sometimes a vivid sexual dream\r\ncomes with it, but that too will do no harm, unless a boy lets his\r\nmind dwell on it till the excitement grows unnatural. This emission\r\nmay happen every two weeks or so, but it is not a regular thing. Boys\r\nare sometimes alarmed and fear their sex machinery is out of order,\r\nbut it is a perfectly natural thing, and only means that the organs\r\nare relieving themselves of the extra secretions that are not needed\r\ntill the time comes for the real sex relation.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls sometimes get the habit of handling their sex organs\r\nso as to get them excited. This is called masturbation or self-abuse.\r\nIt is also called auto-erotism. Such handling can be made to result\r\nin a climax something like that of the natural sex act. For\r\ngenerations this habit has been considered wrong and dangerous, but\r\nrecently many of the best scientists have concluded that the chief\r\nharm has come from the worry caused by doing it, when one believed it\r\nto be wrong. This worry has often been so great that real illness,\r\nboth of the mind and body has resulted. There is no occasion for\r\nworry unless the habit is carried to excess. But remember that until\r\nyou are mature, the sex secretions are specially needed within your\r\nbody, and if you use them wastefully before you are grown, you are\r\ndepriving your body of what it needs. So do not stimulate your sex\r\norgans into action _intentionally_. And do not yield to the impulse\r\nto handle the sex organs in order to relieve the pressure which may\r\noccasionally feel overwhelming, unless you find that nature does not\r\nbring you relief during sleep.\r\n\r\nRemember always that your whole sex machinery is more easily put out\r\nof order than any other part of your body, and it must be treated\r\nwith great care and respect all along. It is not fair to ourselves or\r\nto each other to do a single thing that will make us either weak or\r\nunnatural. Remember that your sex organs have a very powerful, even\r\nif invisible, effect upon your whole being, and up to the time that\r\nyou are really old enough to love some one to whom you want to\r\nactually belong, you must _let your sex machinery_ grow strong and\r\nready for its good, happy work when the right time comes. The sex\r\norgans during your youth do not need frequent exercise in the same\r\nsense that your muscles do. They are active all the time with their\r\ninternal secretions which strengthen both you and them.\r\n\r\nDon't ever let any one drag you into nasty talk or thought about sex.\r\nIt is _not_ a nasty subject. It should mean everything that is\r\nhighest and best and happiest in human life, but it can be easily\r\nperverted and ruined and made the cause of horrible suffering of both\r\nmind and body.\r\n\r\nThere are two very terrible sexual diseases--syphilis and gonorrhea.\r\nThey are both frightfully infectious and very difficult to cure.\r\nThese diseases are usually acquired by sex contact with a diseased\r\nperson, but they can also be gotten by using public drinking cups,\r\ntowels, water-closets, or in any way by which an infected moist\r\narticle can come in contact with one's skin. The worst thing about\r\nthese diseases is that they are such invisible enemies. After the\r\noutside appearance of the disease is gone, they often go reaching\r\nfarther and farther into the body, making awful results that hang on\r\nfor years. Men who get diseased frequently give the infection to\r\ntheir wives, often causing them to be so ill that surgical operations\r\nare necessary, by which their sex organs are so crippled that they\r\ncan never be mothers; and, worst of all, innocent unborn babies are\r\ninfected and come into the world sick or deformed or blind.\r\n\r\nMen often get these dreadful diseases by having sex relations with\r\nwomen who are called prostitutes or \"bad women,\" that is, they are\r\nwomen who are not in love with any one, but who make money by selling\r\ntheir sex relations to men who pay for them. Many prostitutes become\r\ndiseased, and there is, as yet, no way for either them or the men who\r\nvisit them to be positively safe from infection. But the doctors are\r\nmaking progress in their study of these diseases, and they are\r\nfinding out how to control and cure them, just as they have in the\r\ncase of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nBut even if presently these venereal diseases, as they are called,\r\ncan be entirely cured and prevented, prostitution will still remain a\r\nthing to hate. For the idea of sex relations between people who do\r\nnot love each other, who do not feel any sense of belonging to each\r\nother, will always be revolting to highly developed, sensitive\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nPeople's lives grow finer and their characters better, if they have\r\nsex relations only with those they love. And those who make the\r\nwretched mistake of yielding to the sex impulse alone when there is\r\nno love to go with it, usually live to despise themselves for their\r\nweakness and their bad taste. They are always ashamed of doing it,\r\nand they try to keep it secret from their families and those they\r\nrespect. You can be sure that whatever people are ashamed to do is\r\nsomething that can never bring them real happiness. It is true that\r\none's sex relations are the most personal and private matters in the\r\nworld, and they belong just to us and to no one else, but while we\r\nmay be shy and reserved about them, _we are not ashamed_.\r\n\r\nWhen two people really love each other, they don't care who knows it.\r\nThey are proud of their happiness. But no man is ever proud of his\r\nconnection with a prostitute and no prostitute is ever proud of her\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nSex relations belong to love, and love is never a _business_. Love is\r\nthe nicest thing in the world, but it can't be bought. And the sex\r\nside of it is the biggest and most important side of it, so it is the\r\none side of us that we must be absolutely sure to keep in good order\r\nand perfect health, if we are going to be happy ourselves or make any\r\none else happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome words were hyphenated inconsistently in the original pamphlet\r\n(child-birth, fore-skin).
