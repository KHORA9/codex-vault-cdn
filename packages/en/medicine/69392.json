In fact, no one will pretend\r\nthat medicine has yet travelled far, in comparison with its future\r\nachievements, when physiology, pathology, and therapeutics shall\r\nhave become more complete. THOMAS ADDISON is a specimen of the\r\nphysicians of genius who have adorned this century. He is known as\r\nthe discoverer of a disease which bears his name; but his true fame\r\nrests upon his practical talent in diagnosing disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Lonsdale, in his volume of “Worthies of Cumberland,” issued in\r\n1873, shows that Addison sprang from the ranks of the yeomanry of\r\nCumberland, and that his forefathers resided during the Commonwealth\r\nat “The Banks,” in the parish of Lanercost. Thomas Addison, born\r\nin 1636, and Mary his wife, have left their initials carved on an\r\nold oaken settle still preserved at The Banks, inscribed with\r\nthe injunction, “When God doth thee in store, remember thou the\r\npoor.” One of his descendants was a Samuel Addison, who became a\r\ndoctor of medicine, but died at the age of thirty-four. Thomas\r\nAddison, a nephew of his, was born in April 1793, at Longbenton,\r\nnear Newcastle-on-Tyne, where his father was in business, though he\r\nretained his farm at The Banks, where his wife lived for the most\r\npart. Young Addison clung greatly to the ancestral home, and many\r\nyears afterwards assembled his wedding guests there. It is on the\r\nvery site where the Romans encamped during the building of the wall\r\nto the Solway Firth; it overlooks the medieval Priory of Lanercost;\r\nnear by is Naworth, the old Border castle of “Belted Will Howard.”\r\n\r\nThomas Addison was educated at the Newcastle grammar-school under\r\nthe Rev. E. Moises, and there became a masterly Latin scholar, so\r\nthat he afterwards took his lecture notes in Latin at Edinburgh.\r\nHe went direct from school to Edinburgh University, declining to\r\nenter as a pupil with an Edinburgh doctor, as his father desired. He\r\nwas no ordinary student. Independent in thought and action, he was\r\nsoon recognised by the Royal Medical Society, and made one of its\r\npresidents in 1814, an honour which Marshall Hall, and Richard Bright\r\nhis subsequent colleague, also attained about that time. A striking\r\nfact it is that three of the first names of great English physicians\r\nof this century should be Edinburgh students, and Presidents of the\r\nsame Medical Society there. But as yet the London medical schools\r\nwere only in embryo.\r\n\r\nAddison took his M.D. degree in 1815, and afterwards, it is believed,\r\nvisited the Continental schools; but of this there is no certain\r\nevidence. He soon settled in London, in Skinner Street, Snow Hill,\r\nin one of the so-called haunted houses. He knew but one man, an old\r\nfellow-student, in London. Yet he received nearly sixty guineas\r\nin his first year of practice, a very considerable success. He\r\nbecame House Surgeon to the Lock Hospital; then Physician to the\r\nGeneral Dispensary, where he studied skin diseases with Bateman.\r\nThis appointment he held for eight years, and it was of essential\r\nservice to him. He manifested a keen eye for generic distinctions and\r\nindividual varieties, and might probably have succeeded to Bateman’s\r\nposition in regard to skin diseases. But he was not to be made into\r\na specialist. As Dr. Lonsdale says, “with Addison the investigation\r\nof any disease meant the full exercise of his abilities till he had\r\nmastered it, and having done this, he could not rest till he broke\r\nup fresh ground for tillage.” He dreaded becoming a specialist; it\r\nsavoured of quackery. He always held that the true physician must\r\nunderstand surgery well; and that the good surgeon must know the\r\nprinciples of medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 or 1820 commenced Addison’s association with Guy’s. He early\r\nattracted the attention of the energetic and discerning treasurer,\r\nMr. Harrison, then the beneficent despot of Guy’s, and was by\r\nhim appointed Assistant-Physician in 1824. This was a victory for\r\nunconventional procedure, for it had always been the custom to\r\nappoint men at Guy’s who had been original pupils, and not to receive\r\nmen who were already qualified and in practice into the charmed\r\ncircle. It was soon evident that a great practical physician had\r\njoined the hospital staff, and he was further recognised in 1827 by\r\nreceiving the lectureship of Materia Medica. Here his attractive\r\npowers were made evident by the large classes he drew around him,\r\nat a period when medical students entered for individual courses of\r\nlectures, and did not as a rule take the whole of their instruction\r\nat one school. He must have received between £700 and £800 from these\r\nlectures in some years. Men felt that he was the man to sustain and\r\nincrease the fame of Guy’s.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Dr. Addison published, in conjunction with John Morgan,\r\nSurgeon to Guy’s, an essay on “The Operation of Poisonous Agents\r\non the Living Body.” Strange to say, this was the first serious\r\ninvestigation in England into the phenomena of general poisoning.\r\nThe authors believed that a direct influence on the nerve filaments\r\ndistributed to the blood-vessels accounts for the rapid effects of\r\nsome of them. In 1830, Addison published a pamphlet on some disorders\r\nof females, vigorously combating some received notions, and objecting\r\nto the system of depletion. In concluding a lengthy lecture to his\r\nclass on this subject, he showed the sentiments which animated him\r\nby the following remarks: “Gentlemen, if you require an apology for\r\ndetaining you so long, I find ample material for that apology in\r\nthe lively interest in which we must all feel in the comfort and\r\nhappiness of the other sex, doomed as they are, both by the decrees\r\nof Providence and by human institutions, to drink deep of the bitter\r\ncup of suffering. Whatever may be her lot in this world, we, as men,\r\nmust at least acknowledge that, whilst Infinite Power gave us being,\r\nInfinite Mercy gave us women.”\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Addison was elected full Physician to the Hospital, and was\r\nappointed joint-lecturer with Dr. Bright on Medicine. About this time\r\nhe commenced with his colleague the “Elements of the Practice of\r\nMedicine,” of which the first volume only appeared, chiefly written\r\nby Addison. It was most highly valued, but neither author could be\r\ninduced to complete it. Valuable monographs in number came from his\r\nrich experience: two on Pneumonia in 1837 and 1843; Observations on\r\nthe Anatomy of the Lungs in 1840; the Pathology of Phthisis, 1845, in\r\nwhich he laid down the principle that inflammation constitutes the\r\nfirst instrument of destruction in every form of phthisis. This early\r\nadvocacy of a doctrine which has thrown much light on this disease\r\nwas strongly opposed by the physicians of his day, and stamped\r\nAddison as a powerful innovator. He was much impressed by Laennec’s\r\nviews, and acquired very great power of diagnosing from auscultation\r\nof the chest. Yet, candid ever in confessing ignorance, he read a\r\npaper before Guy’s Physical Society in 1846, “On the Difficulties and\r\nFallacies attending Physical Diagnosis of Diseases of the Chest.”\r\nAmong other subjects, he dealt with Diseases of the Liver, Affections\r\nof the Skin, Disorders of the Brain connected with Diseased Kidneys,\r\nand “the Influence of Electricity as a Remedy in certain Convulsive\r\nand Spasmodic Diseases,” in every case bringing together facts\r\nhitherto disconnected, and contributing markedly to advance medicine\r\nas a science.\r\n\r\nThe achievement of Dr. Addison, however, which has attracted most\r\ngeneral notice, is his discovery of a disease of the supra-renal\r\ncapsules, the small organs adjacent to the kidneys, whose function\r\nhas not yet been satisfactorily ascertained. We are told that in\r\none case, which had baffled all investigation, Addison was called\r\nin, and after careful enquiry, stated positively that the patient\r\nsuffered from a disease of these organs, which would before long\r\nprove fatal. This opinion was received with polite incredulity,\r\nbut it was justified by the result, and the supra-renal capsules\r\nwere the only organs that were found diseased. This extraordinary\r\ndiagnosis was soon noised abroad, and on the Continent brought\r\nAddison more honour than in England. Trousseau in France was\r\ncordially supported in naming it “la Maladie d’Addison” (Addison’s\r\ndisease), a name which it will long retain. But the disease was not\r\ndiscovered in this apparently sudden and striking manner, but was\r\nthe result of observations carried on for many years, in which\r\nhis powers of deduction from a few cases and imperfect data were\r\nmost strikingly evidenced. The disease occurs rarely, and very few\r\nhints or materials for comparison were available. A form of wasting\r\ndisease without any apparent organic injury had been again and again\r\nobserved—bloodlessness, extreme prostration, and various shades of\r\nalteration in the colour of the skin, being prominent symptoms. A\r\ncertain bronzing of the integument was, and still is, an inexplicable\r\nconcomitant, and no light was thrown upon it till Addison, carefully\r\nexamining the organs of a deceased patient, when no other disease\r\ncould be detected, discovered signs of malady in the supra-renal\r\ncapsules. He identified the disease, and though he did not absolutely\r\nmark it out from all others, he gave a very perfect account of the\r\nsymptoms in the cases which he had met with, and showed that no other\r\ndisease could be connected with them—indeed no other disease of these\r\ncapsules has been discovered.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher Addison was impressive and popular. His interest in\r\nhis class was genuine and unfeigned; he was eager to draw out the\r\ntalents of his students. Among his pupils were Dr. Golding Bird,\r\ntoo early called from his brilliant career, Sir William Gull, Dr.\r\nWilks, and many others of note. His clinical teaching in the wards\r\nwas especially superior. He could most vividly illustrate on the\r\npatient, and most clearly define and demonstrate his disease. He\r\ndisliked anything like interference with his methods by others,\r\nand sometimes showed it somewhat brusquely. Once when he had been\r\naway from his wards for a few days, a colleague had seen reason to\r\nchange his treatment of a case of pleurisy. On Addison’s return,\r\nhe at once inquired the reason, and was told that the physician in\r\ncharge believed the case to be one of pneumonia and solidification\r\nof the lung. “Ah indeed!” said Addison, “give me a trocar;” and he\r\nimmediately plunged the little instrument into the chest, and drew\r\noff a few ounces of fluid, proving the accuracy of his own diagnosis.\r\nHe wasted no time in considering or discussing probabilities; he was\r\ncertain, and he proved that he was right.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilks’ view of Addison’s character, in the collected edition\r\nof his works published by the New Sydenham Society, 1868, is so\r\npertinent that it must find a place in any adequate account of\r\nAddison:—\r\n\r\n“His strong, positive, and perpetual insistence upon the term\r\n‘practical,’ in reference to disease, constitutes, indeed, the\r\nkey to Addison’s character and professional career. He was always\r\nready to discuss newly-started theories, but he never for a moment\r\nallowed them to interfere with the results of his matured experience.\r\nPossessing unusually vigorous perceptive powers, being shrewd and\r\nsagacious beyond the average of men, the patient before him was\r\nscanned with a penetrating glance, from which few diseases could\r\nescape detection. He never reasoned from a half-discovered fact, but\r\nwould remain at the bedside, with a dogged determination to track\r\nout the disease to its very source, for a period which constantly\r\nwearied his class and his attendant friends. So severely did he tax\r\nhis mind with the minutest details bearing upon the exact exposition\r\nof a case, that he has been known to startle the ‘sister’ of the\r\nward in the middle of the night by his presence; after going to bed\r\nwith the case present to his mind, some point of what he considered\r\nimportant detail in reference to it occurred to him, and he could\r\nnot rest till he had cleared it up. He has also been known, after\r\nseeing a patient within the radius of eight or ten miles, to have\r\nremembered on his near approach to London, thinking over the case\r\non his way, that he had omitted some seemingly important inquiry,\r\nand to have posted back some miles for the purpose of satisfying\r\nhis mind on the doubt which had occurred to it. If at last he could\r\nlay his finger on the disease, his victory was attained, and his\r\npainstaking satisfactorily rewarded. For with him accurate diagnosis\r\nwas the great, and too often the ultimate object of an industry of\r\nsearch, a correlation of facts deduced from scientific observation,\r\nand a concentration of thought rarely combined in the individual\r\nphysician. To those who knew him best, his power of searching into\r\nthe complex framework of the body, and dragging the hidden malady to\r\nlight, appeared unrivalled; but we fear that the one great object\r\nbeing accomplished, the same energetic power was not devoted to\r\nits alleviation or cure. Without accusing Addison of a meditated\r\nneglect of therapeutics, we fancy that we can trace the dallying with\r\nremedies which has been the characteristic of more recent times.\r\n‘I have worked out the disease; if it be remediable, nature, with\r\nfair play, will remedy it. I do not clearly see my way to the direct\r\nagency of special medicaments, but I must prescribe something for\r\nthe patient, at least, to satisfy his or her friends,’ seems to have\r\nbeen a part of the habit of mind which can deal satisfactorily only\r\nwith the observable and proven, and shrinks from the uncertain and\r\nquestionable.”\r\n\r\nAddison did not seek to push himself into notoriety. Indeed he seems\r\nto have studiously kept himself in the background as regards public\r\nlife. He took little pains to seek publication of his researches in\r\nthe medical journals, and for the most part his excellent papers\r\nappear in Guy’s Hospital Reports. Thus his practice was not equal\r\nto his great merits, though he died worth £60,000. In professional\r\nintercourse he appeared blunt, and even at times rude, giving\r\nthe idea of hauteur and assumption of superiority. The general\r\npractitioner was liable to find him unapproachable, and to conceive\r\nof him as a man of large self-esteem. Yet underneath this outward\r\nsemblance lay a most acute nervousness of temperament. This powerful,\r\nwell-built, energetic, emphatic man concealed a physical nervousness\r\nand susceptibility which most deeply affected him in circumstances\r\nof trial. He often said, “I never rose to address the Guy’s Junior\r\nPhysical Society without feeling nervous;” and yet at the same\r\ntime he appeared to his audience to be speaking in a tone akin\r\neven to bluster. His apparent discourtesy was as far as possible\r\nfrom representing his real sentiments. “Viewed in its professional\r\naspect,” says Dr. Wilks, “no character on record has presented in\r\na higher degree the sterling hard qualities of true professional\r\nhonesty. We have never heard a single instance in which a word of\r\ndisparagement of a professional brother escaped him. He would always\r\nstrenuously, and with all his natural vigour, maintain what he\r\nbelieved to be the truth, but never for the purpose of underrating\r\nthe opinions of others. His whole bearing in the profession was to\r\nthe last degree honourable, and anything like jealousy or ill-will\r\nagainst another professional man never entered his mind.”\r\n\r\nThe chief honour outside his school that fell to Addison was the\r\nPresidency of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. But court\r\nfavour did not shine on him, though none would have more worthily\r\nreceived it. On the Continent, as we have before said, Addison was\r\ntreated with the utmost distinction. When he visited Paris, Nélaton,\r\nTrousseau and the élite of the profession entertained him at a public\r\ndinner, and gave him the warmest reception. Addison made an eloquent\r\nspeech in excellent French. He was a zealous Tory, not approving\r\nof Disraeli’s modernised policy, but equally removed from Eldon’s\r\ntyrannical rule.\r\n\r\nGuy’s Museum of Pathology, adorned by an admirable bust of him\r\nby Joseph Towne, bears large testimony to Addison’s energy and\r\ndiscernment. He added to it very largely, and his early study of\r\nskin diseases led him to suggest and superintend in execution a plan\r\nfor illustrating skin diseases by wax models, and carefully coloured\r\ndrawings from life—a process afterwards extended widely through the\r\nrange of pathology.\r\n\r\n“Every feature of Addison’s face,” says Dr. Lonsdale, “was well\r\ndefined, and comported well with his finely-proportioned massive\r\nhead. He had dark hair, large eyebrows, and eyes of deep hazel\r\ncolour; his nose was pronounced, his lips full and voluble, and\r\nrather special in action, and his chin firm and broad; and his\r\ngeneral physiognomy was stamped with vigour and unmistakable\r\ncharacter throughout. He had a deep penetrating eye, that became full\r\nof life and light when engaged in debate. Of commanding presence\r\nand firm significant step, he possessed a keen penetrativeness,\r\nindeed a special discernment that never failed him in private life,\r\nand but rarely at the bedside of the sick. He stood before you the\r\nimpersonation of power and dignity and independence.” Some persons\r\nwho knew him well believed that he would have had equal success\r\nat the bar, in the senate, in the navy or the Church. Whatever he\r\nattempted, he would have mastered, and would have carried out,\r\nundisturbed by opposition, undeviating in principle.\r\n\r\nDr. Addison did not marry till he was some years over fifty. His wife\r\nwas the widow of W. W. Hanxwell, Esq. The wedding, in September\r\n1847, took place in Lanercost Church, and was attended by an unusual\r\nincident. Just before the ceremony, and unknown to the party, a storm\r\nhad blown part of the roof of the church on to the altar table. When\r\nhe saw the wreckage, Addison exclaimed to his biographer, nervously\r\nclutching his arm, “Good God, Lonsdale! is this not ominous?” But\r\nhis friend, suggesting that any part of the building would do for\r\nthe ceremony, and the bride smilingly showing no diminution of\r\ncheerfulness, reassured the doctor, and all went off well. Mrs.\r\nAddison, who had two children by her first husband, but none by\r\nthe second, survived Dr. Addison twelve years. She is described as\r\nextremely amiable, and an excellent wife.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1860 Addison was compelled to retire from his\r\nhospital duties by a threatening of brain-disease. He settled at\r\nBrighton; but his disease progressed, and ended in his death on\r\n29th June 1860. He was buried at Lanercost on the 5th of July. A\r\nmarble tablet in the chapel of Guy’s Hospital records that he won\r\nthe admiration and the confidence of the students of the Hospital\r\nby his profound knowledge and earnest eloquence: and that he was\r\nbeloved by the patients for his unwearied attention and kindness to\r\nthem. One of the medical wards in the new buildings of Guy’s is named\r\nafter him “Addison Ward.” It is worthy of note that Addison, like\r\nJohn Bell, was a musician, and ready at learning a new instrument.\r\nBeing slightly deaf in one ear, he was correspondingly acute with the\r\nother. This ear he used with surpassing skill in auscultation of the\r\nheart and lungs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the preface to an edition of Dr. Bright’s “Clinical Memoirs on\r\nAbdominal Tumours,” published by the Sydenham Society in 1861, Dr.\r\nBarlow well remarks, “There has been no English physician—perhaps it\r\nmay be said none of any country—since the time of Harvey, who has\r\neffected, not only so great an advance in the knowledge of particular\r\ndiseases, but also so great a revolution in our habits of thought,\r\nand methods of investigating morbid phenomena and tracing the\r\netiology of disease, as has the late Dr. Richard Bright. To those who\r\nhave received the knowledge of the connections of dropsy, albuminous\r\nurine, and disease of the kidney, among the first rudiments of\r\nmedicine, the facts which establish that connection may appear\r\nso simple and easily ascertained, that the amount of labour, the\r\naccuracy of the observation and the rigid adherence to the inductive\r\nmethod which characterised the whole of Bright’s researches, may\r\nhardly have been suspected, still less adequately appreciated.”\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRIGHT was born at Bristol in September 1789, his father\r\nbeing a member of the wealthy banking firm of Ames, Bright, & Cave,\r\nand his elder brother subsequently representing Bristol in three\r\nparliaments. His early education was conducted by Dr. Estlin, and\r\nlater by Dr. Carpenter, both names of note in Bristol. In 1808 he\r\nentered at Edinburgh University, at first attending Dugald Stewart,\r\nPlayfair, and Leslie, in whose mathematical class he gained a prize\r\nin 1809, commencing the study of medicine under Monro tertius, Hope,\r\nand Duncan.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Dr. Bright, with Dr. (afterwards Sir Henry) Holland,\r\naccompanied Sir George Mackenzie in his journey through Iceland, and\r\ncontributed notes on botany and zoology, as well as other portions,\r\nto “Mackenzie’s Travels in Iceland” (Edinburgh, 1811). Mackenzie\r\nacknowledges Bright’s cheerful and ready exertion and undeviating\r\ngood-humour in the many cross accidents that befel the party. Several\r\ntimes the two medical friends were in imminent danger, and we cannot\r\nbut be thankful that these lights of medicine were spared to do their\r\nlife-work.\r\n\r\nReturning from Iceland, Bright’s clinical hospital work was commenced\r\nat Guy’s Hospital, London, where he lived in the house of a resident\r\nofficer for two years, a foretaste of the forty years’ residence\r\nwhich he practically made within its walls. Astley Cooper was then in\r\nhis best form, and young Bright was at once attracted to pathology\r\nand _post mortem_ observation. At this early date he made a drawing\r\nof a granular kidney, one of the morbid conditions which he was\r\nafterwards to do so much to elucidate. In 1812-13 Bright was again\r\na student at Edinburgh, where Gregory was still in full vigour: and\r\nhe graduated on the 13th September 1813, producing a thesis on\r\nContagious Erysipelas. With the idea of graduating at Cambridge,\r\nhe entered at Peterhouse, where his brother was a lay-fellow, but\r\nhe only resided two terms, finding his studies impeded by college\r\ndiscipline. In 1814 Bright was one of the crowd of English voyagers\r\nupon the Continent, and made himself conversant with French and\r\nGerman, attending professional lectures especially at Berlin and\r\nVienna. In the spring of 1815 he travelled considerably in Hungary,\r\nand the result of his observations, for he was emphatically an\r\nobserver, was given to the world in his large quarto volume of\r\n“Travels from Vienna through Lower Hungary, with Remarks on the State\r\nof Vienna during the Congress of 1814,” published at Edinburgh,\r\n1818. This was a most valuable contribution on the social condition,\r\nstatistics, and natural history of that country, then so little known\r\nin England. In all this it is evident how much Dr. Bright’s career\r\nwas facilitated by the comfortable circumstances in which he was\r\nplaced pecuniarily: not that money gave him his talent, but that it\r\nprevented him from suffering from the obstacles and disadvantages\r\nwhich have attended the career of so many physicians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Bright, in the winter of 1814, had been studying\r\ncutaneous diseases under Dr. Bateman at the Dispensary. On his return\r\nhome through Belgium, about a fortnight after Waterloo, he saw many\r\ninteresting cases of disease among the sick and wounded from the late\r\ncontending armies. In December 1816 he was admitted a Licentiate\r\nof the London College of Physicians, and was soon after elected\r\nassistant-physician to the London Fever Hospital, paying the frequent\r\nprice of a severe attack of fever, which almost cost him his life.\r\nIn the summer and autumn of 1818 he again visited the Continent,\r\nspending a considerable time in Germany and Italy, and returning\r\nthrough Switzerland and France.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 we may date Bright’s full entry upon his professional\r\ncareer; for he now took a house in Bloomsbury Square for private\r\npractice. His election the same year to the assistant-physiciancy to\r\nGuy’s Hospital led him to give up the Fever Hospital and concentrate\r\nhis attention on the work at Guy’s. He became speedily noted for his\r\ndiligent attendance in the wards, and for tracing the causes of his\r\npatients’ symptoms in the _post mortem_ room when they unhappily\r\narrived there. For many years he spent six hours a day in his beloved\r\nscene of investigation; and long afterwards, when private practice\r\nabsorbed more of his time, he longingly looked back upon the past\r\nyears of cheerful research and successful toil. His progress, well\r\nprepared for, was now rapid. In 1821 he was elected F.R.S.; in 1822\r\nhe began to lecture on Botany and Materia Medica; and in 1824 he\r\nlectured on Medicine, in conjunction at first with Dr. Cholmeley,\r\nlater taking the whole course alone. Some years afterwards Dr.\r\nAddison became associated in this lectureship, and the two famous\r\nmen for many years upheld and raised the fame of Guy’s by their\r\ncopartnership.\r\n\r\nBright was not a theorist, was devoid of special doctrines and\r\n“views,” but as Dr. Wilks[1] well puts it, “he could see, and we\r\nare struck with astonishment at his powers of observation, as he\r\nphotographed pictures of disease for the study of posterity.” From\r\nthis Dr. Wilks infers that he did not thoroughly perceive the value\r\nof his own work, and that he attached no more importance to diseases\r\nof the kidney than to those of the liver and brain, which he also\r\ndescribed. Dr. Wilks even regards many observations of Bright as\r\nmore novel and original when they were published than those relating\r\nto the kidney, but the latter were of more value, and their greater\r\nsignificance was at once recognised. It should be distinctly\r\nunderstood that Bright was not simply a specialist in kidney disease,\r\nbut a clinical physician of rare excellence, who followed his cases\r\ninto the _post mortem_ room, and carefully observed not only the\r\nchanges which had taken place in the organ whose disease had caused\r\ndeath, but also the state of all the other organs of the body. He was\r\none of the first, if not the first, to describe acute yellow atrophy\r\nof the liver, pigmentation of the brain in melanæmia (or pigmented\r\nblood) due to miasma, condensation of the lung in whooping-cough,\r\nunilateral convulsion without loss of consciousness in local brain\r\ndiseases, the bruit of the heart in chorea, the small echinococci on\r\nthe interior of hydatid cysts, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is strange indeed that dropsy should have existed so long and\r\nits cause have been undiscovered; and that renal disease, as we now\r\nunderstand it, should have been almost unknown. For more than a\r\ncentury before Bright’s work was published the occurrence of albumen\r\nin the urine of dropsical persons had been known; and cases had been\r\nnoted where convulsions and blood-poisoning had occurred when the\r\nkidneys had been found small and granular after death. Dr. Blackhall\r\nhad written a treatise on dropsy in 1813; but though he found the\r\nurine albuminous, he rarely went to the _post mortem_ room and\r\nexamined the kidneys, which indeed might often at that time remain\r\nuntouched. But until Bright’s first quarto volume of “Reports of\r\nMedical Cases,” 1827, appeared, renal disease had not been recognised\r\nas an important malady; he was at once hailed as a discoverer, and\r\nthe malady called after his name. He first showed how to recognise\r\na common form of disease, and systematised what was known about it,\r\nand he further demonstrated that there were three or four varieties\r\nof it, a view which subsequent investigation has most fully confirmed\r\nand developed in most important directions. He proved that not only\r\nwas there a continual withdrawal from the blood of most important\r\nalbuminous constituents, but that this was frequently attended with\r\na failure to remove by the kidneys that natural product of waste,\r\nnamely urea, which remaining in the blood in excess became poisonous,\r\nand often produced convulsions and inflammations at a distance\r\nfrom the kidneys. This latter view of the consequences of retained\r\nsecretion was not adopted without considerable opposition, but fuller\r\ninquiry only made its truth more evident. And the adoption of a new\r\ntruth had its reflex effects in other departments of investigation.\r\nDiseases of other excretory organs might possibly be caused in\r\nthe same way; and so the effects of diseased liver in causing\r\nretention of the bile and its circulation in the tissues became anew\r\nilluminated; and bile-poisoning and blood-poisoning were placed on a\r\nnew footing.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large amount of time for many years was given to the\r\ninvestigation of renal cases, many other departments of research\r\nwere the objects of Dr. Bright’s careful attention. We have already\r\nreferred to some of these. Perhaps one series of phenomena that he\r\nwas as much interested in as any was the various tumours of the\r\nabdomen, and the means of diagnosing between them. He published\r\nin Guy’s Hospital Reports an extended set of monographs on these\r\nsubjects, which have been published in a collected form by the\r\nNew Sydenham Society. They are chiefly clinical, illustrated by\r\nwell-grouped cases, observed and recorded with great care and\r\naccuracy, and abounding in important suggestions as to diagnosis and\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of “Reports of Medical Cases” appeared, in two\r\nparts, in 1831, and contained principally narrations of cases of\r\ncerebral and spinal diseases, including paralysis, epilepsy,\r\ntetanus, hydrophobia, and hysteria, with observations on their nature\r\nand pathology. The many coloured plates in both volumes are of great\r\nexcellence and authority, being executed under Dr. Bright’s own\r\nsuperintendence. He was afterwards associated with Dr. Addison in\r\nthe production of the first volume of the “Elements of the Practice\r\nof Medicine.” The first volume of Guy’s Hospital Reports, published\r\nin 1836, contains no fewer than eight papers from Bright’s own pen.\r\nIn 1832 Dr. Bright was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians, and in 1833 gave the Gulstonian lectures at the College,\r\non the Functions of the Abdominal Viscera, with observations on the\r\ndiagnostic marks of the diseases to which the viscera are subject.\r\nIn 1836 he was censor, and in 1837 gave the Lumleian lectures on\r\nDisorders of the Brain.\r\n\r\nIn his early years Dr. Bright’s practice was not very extensive. He\r\nwas disinclined to use any adventitious aids to popular reputation,\r\nand was content to pursue his tireless investigations. His\r\npublications on renal disease gradually attracted general attention,\r\nand the profession found him a most reliable and valuable consultant,\r\nso that in his later years he commanded a first-class practice. A\r\nfew years before his death he resigned his post at Guy’s Hospital,\r\nand was made Honorary Consulting Physician. He died on the 11th\r\nDecember 1858, from the consequences of extensive and long-standing\r\nossification of the aortic valves of the heart, the exit for the\r\nblood being reduced to a mere chink. He had long suffered very\r\nconsiderably, but was never thoroughly examined in life. However,\r\nhe believed considerably in the value of medicine, and took large\r\nquantities of some kinds. He was buried at Kensal Green.\r\n\r\nBright is described as having had “a remarkably even temper and\r\ncheerful disposition: he was most considerate towards the failings\r\nof others, but severe in the discipline of his own mind. He was\r\nsincerely religious, both in doctrine and practice, and of so pure\r\na mind that he never was heard to utter a sentiment or to relate an\r\nanecdote that was not fit to be heard by the merest child or the\r\nmost refined female. He was an affectionate husband and an excellent\r\nfather, not only taking the most lively interest in the welfare of\r\nhis children, and in their pursuits, but never so happy as when he\r\nhad them around him; so that half the pleasure of the long vacation\r\nwas lost, unless he had as many members of his family as possible\r\nfor his companions.” He married, first, the third daughter of Dr.\r\nBabington, senior; and secondly a sister of Sir William Follett, by\r\nwhom he left surviving three sons, one being Dr. Bright of Cannes,\r\nand another the Rev. James Franck Bright, the well-known historian,\r\nand Master of University College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Bright that he was perhaps better known abroad than\r\nany other British physician of his time. The confidence reposed\r\nin him by his professional brethren was dependent largely upon the\r\nminute attention he bestowed upon every case. He always took careful\r\nnotes, and often made drawings, being a good draughtsman and rather a\r\nconnoisseur in etchings and engravings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Historical Notes on Bright’s Disease, Addison’s Disease, and\r\nHodgkin’s Disease, in Guy’s Hospital Reports, 3d series, vol. xxii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_LISTON, SYME, LIZARS, AND THE NEWER SURGERY._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong operating surgeons few names take higher rank than those of\r\nListon and Syme, at one time close associates in private medical\r\nteaching at Edinburgh, at a later period jealous rivals and even\r\nantagonists, but happily again warm friends before the sudden end\r\nof the elder. ROBERT LISTON was born on the 28th October 1794,\r\nhis father being the Rev. Henry Liston, minister of Ecclesmachan,\r\nLinlithgow, whose accomplishments included a considerable\r\nacquaintance with the theory of music, and who wrote a treatise on\r\nPerfect Intonation in addition to inventing an organ calculated to\r\nproduce the desired intonation. He was educated chiefly by his father\r\nup to the age of fourteen, and afterwards attended classical and\r\nmathematical lectures in Edinburgh University during two sessions,\r\nobtaining a prize for Latin composition in the second. At this period\r\nof his life he exhibited great fondness for the sea, and was only\r\ninduced to give up his desire to become a sailor by a promise that if\r\nhe would study medicine he should eventually be a naval surgeon if he\r\nwished. His taste for a seafaring life never forsook him; and one\r\nof the relaxations which he most enjoyed up to within a few weeks of\r\nhis death, was sailing in a yacht which he kept on the Thames. He was\r\nalso very fond of field-sports.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Liston commenced medical study as the pupil of Dr. Barclay,\r\nthe well-known anatomical lecturer. He soon became noted by his\r\ninstructor for his zeal and untiring assiduity, and he eventually\r\nchose him as his assistant and prosector, an office he retained\r\nuntil 1815. It was thus that Liston acquired the foundation of his\r\nremarkable knowledge of surgical anatomy, which his later experience\r\nstrengthened, and to which he added a dexterity in the use of\r\nsurgical instruments, and especially the knife, which was unsurpassed\r\nin his time.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Liston became surgeon’s clerk or house-surgeon in the\r\nRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in which capacity he availed himself\r\nfully of the opportunities for making _post mortem_ examinations,\r\nwhich were then performed by the house-surgeons. In 1816 he went\r\nto London, and studied several months at St. George’s Hospital,\r\nand also attended some of Abernethy’s lectures. In 1817, having\r\ntaken the diplomas of the College of Surgeons both in London and\r\nEdinburgh, he began practice in Edinburgh, and again assisted Dr.\r\nBarclay in his anatomical teaching. But misunderstandings arising\r\nbetween them, Liston left Barclay and commenced to lecture on his own\r\naccount at the beginning of the session 1818-19, James Syme becoming\r\nhis assistant. In 1823 Liston gave up teaching anatomy in favour\r\nof Syme, in order to devote himself entirely to surgical teaching;\r\nbut Liston retained a large share of the proceeds of the anatomical\r\nlectures, as the originator and more important proprietor of the\r\njoint school. This arrangement did not last long, Syme withdrawing to\r\nBrown Square in 1824: and it appears that Liston is, at least equally\r\nwith Syme, open to the charge of having displayed serious jealousy in\r\nthis matter. They were unavoidably serious rivals, too nearly equals\r\nin power, and perhaps too conscious of their own individual claims,\r\nto be able to view with equanimity each other’s proceedings and\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nListon had published a little book on the Surgical Anatomy of Crural\r\nHernia (1819), and soon acquired fame by performing several brilliant\r\noperations, difficult amputations, ligatures of arteries, lithotomy,\r\n&c. At that time there were many defects in the management of the\r\nRoyal Infirmary, and Liston set to work, young as he was, to agitate\r\nfor their removal. Unfortunately he did not make any attempts to\r\nconciliate the managers in so doing, and his outspoken complaints\r\nwere met with bitter opposition from some of the surgeons as well as\r\nmanagers. He entered into the spirit of controversy which Dr. Gregory\r\nhad done so much to foment, and in which so much of the talent and\r\ntime of Edinburgh men was then wasted. In 1821 Liston records that\r\nhe was almost daily applied to by patients from the Infirmary who\r\nhad failed to secure relief from the surgeons, and he was exposed\r\nto the charge of decoying patients thence. It was even demanded\r\nof him, on pain of perpetual exclusion from the surgeoncy to the\r\nInfirmary, that he should refuse his professional assistance to any\r\nperson who had been a patient there. He naturally refused to comply\r\nwith any such condition, nor would he absent himself from attendance\r\non the Infirmary practice, as was also suggested. It is fair to say\r\nthat Liston courted the fullest investigation of his actions, and\r\ndenied that he had ever directly or indirectly insinuated to any\r\npatient of the Infirmary that the practice followed there was bad,\r\nor that he himself knew better, or had in any way tried to entice\r\npatients away. But he did complain of the tedious and often injurious\r\ndelay which took place before patients were operated upon, and the\r\nunsatisfactory result of many of the operations; while he himself\r\nhad undoubtedly cured many discharged as incurable, or imperfectly\r\nrelieved. The young surgeon showed so vigorous a front that great\r\nefforts were made to make the most of any imprudences he committed,\r\nand to deter students from attending his classes, especially by hints\r\nthat they would come off very badly before the College of Surgeons\r\nif they did. Strange that he who now maintained so bold an attack\r\nupon convention and authority, should have shown such jealousy of\r\nhis former demonstrator, Syme, and have endeavoured by manner, and\r\nmore than manner, to repress and depreciate a still younger man’s\r\nskill. This was but one of the many inconsistencies and difficulties\r\nthat Liston’s consciousness of his own powers and his abrupt and\r\nsomewhat rough manner of dealing with differences of opinion led him\r\ninto. Nevertheless the scathing charges of incompetency which Liston\r\nbrought against some of the surgeons then in office, and supported in\r\ndetail, were sufficient to prove to the managers that Liston was no\r\nordinary young man, but must be allowed a full field for his talents;\r\nand consequently gaining increasing fame as a lecturer on surgery,\r\nand attracting large classes of students, Liston in 1828 became one\r\nof the surgeons to the Royal Infirmary.\r\n\r\nBut Liston’s interest was insufficient to gain him the Professorship\r\nof Surgery in the University when it fell vacant, and he gladly\r\naccepted the offer of the Surgeoncy to the North London Hospital\r\nwith the Professorship of Clinical Surgery in University College in\r\n1834. His transfer to London was a striking success. He had already\r\npublished, in 1833, his “Principles of Surgery,” which went through\r\nseveral editions. Its clearness, simplicity, and homeliness of style\r\nmade it popular, and well calculated to widen his fame. Unornamental\r\nalmost to a fault, and perhaps deficient in illustration, he gave\r\nmuch practical information, and definitely elucidated his subject.\r\nHis “Practical Surgery,” published in 1837, chiefly giving the\r\nresults of his own experiences, was still more popular. His brilliant\r\ntalents, however, were those of an operator. It was said of him that\r\nhe possessed every qualification for success in this department,\r\ngreat physical strength and activity, coolness, promptitude, energy,\r\nand unflinching courage, a steady hand and a quick eye, a resolution\r\nwhich rose with the difficulties he encountered, and rested on a just\r\nreliance on his complete knowledge of anatomy and pathology. Yet the\r\nbrilliant operator was not over anxious to exhibit his talents; he\r\nwas often considered remarkably cautious. His deliberation was as\r\nmarked before undertaking an operation as was his fearlessness when\r\nit was undertaken. His readiness and resource under the most varied\r\nand difficult combinations of circumstances were surprising. He\r\nexcelled in irregular operations in which no well established mode of\r\nprocedure could be followed, but he had to depend on the decision of\r\nthe moment as to the particular case. He knew exactly what he meant\r\nto do and how to do it, and this without delay or hesitation. Thus he\r\nwon the reputation of being the most dexterous operator of his day.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his “Surgery” Liston published numerous valuable\r\npapers on amputation, difficult cases of aneurism, tracheotomy,\r\nlithotomy, and lithotrity. He left his impress on a very large\r\nnumber of operations, either devising new methods of meeting old\r\ndifficulties, or improving the accepted modes of dealing with them.\r\nHe invented an improved shoe for the treatment of club-foot, and\r\nwas great at reducing dislocations. He once succeeded in reducing a\r\ndislocated hip-joint after the dislocation had continued no less\r\nthan two years. He introduced the method of reducing dislocated\r\nphalanges, especially of the thumb, by passing the ring of a\r\ndoor-key over the part and hitching it against the projecting end\r\nof the bone, so that extension and pressure could be brought to\r\nbear simultaneously. After dislocation of the thigh backwards, he\r\nseveral times took advantage of the immediate powerlessness of the\r\nmuscles from shock, and reduced the limb on the spot without the\r\nuse of pulleys or even without the aid of an assistant. He invented\r\nor modified splints for broken limbs. His methods of performing\r\namputations by flaps became very largely adopted. He had great\r\nsuccess in what are known as plastic operations, such as restoring\r\na nose by taking a flap from the upper lip. His name is scarcely\r\nmore associated with amputations, however, than with lithotomy and\r\nlithotrity, to which he devoted great attention. Many of his lectures\r\non those subjects were published in the _Lancet_ and were widely read.\r\n\r\nMuch importance has been assigned to Liston’s personal strength as\r\nconstituting a large element in his operative successes. His hand and\r\narm, it was said, might have furnished models for a Hercules, and\r\ntheir power was not unfrequently shown in operations requiring great\r\nmuscular exertion. But he was equally successful in those in which\r\nthe most delicate manipulation was demanded. His decision and force\r\nof character were equal to the accurate control over his powerful\r\nyet adaptable muscles. He would amputate the thigh single-handed,\r\ncompress the artery with the left hand, using no tourniquet, and do\r\nall the cutting and sawing with the right, with only the aid of a\r\nhouse-surgeon to hold the limb and tie the ligatures on the arteries.\r\nHe did not need time for reflection; his actions were prompted by\r\na kind of intuition akin to genius; he seemed to comprehend at a\r\nglance the requirements of any particular case. Yet he never gave up\r\nhis habit of studying anatomy, spending as many hours as possible in\r\nactual dissection.\r\n\r\nOne of Liston’s striking exhibitions of decision and invention\r\noccurred during an amputation of the thigh by Russell, then Professor\r\nof Clinical Surgery at Edinburgh. An artery in the cut bone bled\r\nprofusely, and in consequence of its bony surroundings could not be\r\ntied in the ordinary way. Liston with the amputating-knife at once\r\ncut off a chip of wood from the operating table, formed it into\r\na cone, and drove it into the bleeding orifice, and in this way\r\nimmediately arrested the bleeding.[2]\r\n\r\nListon’s general principles of treatment are also worthy of note,\r\nas he exercised by their means a considerable influence on the\r\nprofession. He early became alive to the unwisdom of over-treatment,\r\nand tended more and more to trust to natural recuperative powers. He\r\nwas thus enabled to dispense with the multitudinous paraphernalia\r\nwhich surrounded the operating surgeon, the repeated poulticing,\r\nstrapping, bandaging, anointing, which often rendered a stay in a\r\nsurgical ward almost intolerable.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sir Anthony Carlisle in 1840, Liston was elected to\r\nthe Council of the Royal College of Surgeons, but did not become one\r\nof the Examiners until March 1846. There is little doubt that he\r\nwould before long have attained the Presidency of the College, had\r\nnot his career been cut short. His practice became very large, and\r\nthere is no doubt that he undertook an amount of work which many men\r\nwould have found impossible. Yet he was noted for his consideration\r\nof the poor and necessitous. It was remarked in the _Times_ after\r\nhis death that “his nature abhorred everything sordid, and no man\r\never was more strongly impressed with the feelings of an honourable,\r\ngenerous, and independent practitioner. In whatever rank of life the\r\n‘case’ occurred, if it was one of difficulty or interest, this master\r\nof his art was ready with the potent spell of his unerring bistoury,\r\nand his reward was in the consciousness of his own power, and in the\r\nnoble pride of having been ministrant to the relief of suffering\r\nhumanity. His manner in ordinary society was sometimes complained of\r\nas harsh or abrupt, and he certainly was occasionally neglectful\r\nof the mere trifling courtesies of life, and sometimes careless of\r\nrefinement or punctilio. He was a man of thought more than of show.\r\nHe could not bear triflers, and he did not always avoid showing\r\nhis distaste. He was a fervid lover of truth and sincerity, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, expressed himself too strongly when he thought\r\nthere lurked any meanness or deceit or affectation. But in the proper\r\nand trying scene of the labours of the medical man—in the chamber of\r\nthe sick—he was gentle as he was resolute. He never had a patient who\r\nwas not anxious to become a friend, and the voice which was sometimes\r\ndiscordant amid the petty annoyances of daily life was music to the\r\nsick man’s ear. Into the scene of suffering he never brought a harsh\r\nword or an unkind look, and the hand which was hard as iron and true\r\nas steel in the theatre of operation was soft as thistle-down to the\r\nthrobbing pulse and aching brow. It may also be added, with perfect\r\ntruth, that in the exercise of his arduous duties, among persons of\r\nthe highest rank and most fastidious sympathies, his delicacy and\r\nforbearance were as remarkable as the sound sense which regulated all\r\nhis professional conduct. His heart was in his business.”\r\n\r\nListon was warm in his friendships though strong in his dislikes. He\r\ndid not readily take to strangers. It is to be noted that he became\r\nfrankly reconciled to Syme after their serious divergence. He took\r\nthe initiative finally in 1839, and a genial correspondence took\r\nplace between them. They met once more in the autumn of 1847, when\r\nListon visited Edinburgh, and were often together. Liston dined with\r\nSyme at Millbank the day after his arrival in Edinburgh, and again\r\nthe day before he left for London. Before very long, however, Liston\r\nwas carried off by aneurism of the aorta, which must have existed\r\nfor years, and been fostered by his great physical exertions, which\r\ncharacterised his recreation as well as his work. It had been found\r\nimpossible to diagnose his ailment with certainty till some little\r\ntime before his death, which came with startling suddenness upon\r\nthe medical world and the public generally. He died on December 7,\r\n1847, aged 53, and was buried at Highgate Cemetery. A body of 400\r\nstudents and a large number of medical men attended his funeral. He\r\nleft a widow and a family of six children, two of whom were sons.\r\nOne of these, however, died very soon after his father. In the\r\nfollowing May Lord Brougham delivered a glowing eulogy on Liston at\r\nthe distribution of prizes at University College. A sum of about\r\n£700 was subscribed for a memorial, which took the form of a marble\r\nstatue—placed in the College—and a gold medal called the Liston\r\nMedal, which is awarded annually for surgery at the same institution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES SYME, another of the great Scotch surgeons of this century,\r\nwas born in Edinburgh on the 7th November 1799. His father, a\r\nWriter to the Signet, was of good family, but owing to unsuccessful\r\nspeculations was involved in difficulties, and left nothing behind\r\nhim. Young Syme was educated at the High School of Edinburgh,\r\nand soon showed characteristic patience and perseverance without\r\nbrilliant parts. A certain thickness of speech, almost amounting to\r\nan impediment, strengthened the impression of shyness that he gave.\r\nInstead of country sports, he was fond of botanising, and of making\r\nskeletons of small animals. A similar tendency manifested itself in\r\nhis attachment to chemistry and his fondness for making chemical\r\nexperiments. Thus he was equipped with a sufficient bent towards\r\nstudies connected with medicine to render it not surprising when he\r\nadopted the medical profession.\r\n\r\nFrom 1815 onward Syme attended the University of Edinburgh, taking\r\nboth Arts and Science lectures at first. Incidentally, in the\r\ncourse of his chemical pursuits, he made an original discovery of\r\nthe waterproofing process, and having first dissolved indiarubber,\r\nwas able to construct flexible tubes of it, and to render various\r\nsubstances waterproof by brushing a thin solution of it into their\r\ninterstices. Not to be diverted from his medical work, Syme declined\r\nto take out a patent, but published his method. Mr. Mackintosh of\r\nGlasgow soon after patented a process, and Syme gained no advantage\r\nfrom his discovery.\r\n\r\nSyme’s early friendship with Liston led him to enter Barclay’s\r\nExtra-Academical classes in the winter of 1817-18. In the next\r\nwinter, however, Syme followed Liston when he started on his own\r\naccount, and assisted him in demonstrating from the beginning. He\r\nperseveringly continued studying, and in 1822 went to Paris to\r\nimprove himself both in anatomy and operative surgery, gaining\r\nespecial advantage from Lisfranc’s and from Dupuytren’s operations\r\nand instructions.\r\n\r\nWhile demonstrating for Liston, Syme was pursuing his medical studies\r\nat the Royal Infirmary and elsewhere, and became impressed with the\r\nunwisdom of the repeated and severe blood-letting then in vogue. In\r\n1823, having become a qualified surgeon, and entering into practice\r\nin Edinburgh, Syme performed his first striking operation—one\r\nwhich he himself designated as “the greatest and bloodiest in\r\nsurgery”—namely, amputation at the hip-joint. Its success was an\r\nearnest of his future triumphs. In the same year Liston retired from\r\nteaching anatomy to devote himself entirely to surgery, and Syme\r\noccupied his place. The summer of 1824 was spent in studying surgery\r\nas practised in Germany. The same year a coldness which had been\r\ngrowing between Liston and Syme caused the withdrawal of the latter\r\nfrom association with Liston, and his starting a new school in Brown\r\nSquare in partnership with Dr. Mackintosh. Here Syme taught anatomy\r\nand surgery, Dr. Mackintosh medicine and midwifery, and Dr. Fletcher\r\nphysiology. The class in surgery numbered as many as fifty students.\r\nBut the difficulties and scandals attending the due supply of\r\nsubjects for dissection gradually disgusted Syme with the anatomical\r\npart of his work, and a quarrel with Dr. Mackintosh finally led\r\nto his quitting the Brown Square school, and devoting himself\r\nentirely to surgery. This was a bold stroke, seeing that he had\r\nfour or five formidable competitors in Edinburgh, including Liston,\r\nLizars, and Fergusson (afterwards Sir William). Yet so strikingly\r\nwas he justified by the event, that in 1828-9 his class increased\r\nto 250, the largest ever assembled by any teacher of pure surgery\r\nin Edinburgh. Practice had been flowing in upon him, stimulated in\r\n1826 by an important paper on the treatment of wounds, in which\r\nhe insisted on the importance of providing a free outlet for all\r\ndischarges instead of almost hermetically sealing them up, as was so\r\nfrequently done. In 1827 he gave another evidence of his remarkable\r\noperative skill by successfully removing a huge tumour involving part\r\nof the lower-jaw bone, an operation which no other surgeon would\r\nundertake. Sixteen years afterwards the patient was met with, having\r\nhis deformity well covered by a vigorous beard.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that the lack of a hospital appointment should be\r\nkeenly felt by Mr. Syme, and that he should apply for one when a\r\nvacancy occurred at the Royal Infirmary; but his action when this\r\nwas refused to him, in view of the rivalry existing between himself\r\nand Liston, was eminently energetic and commendable. He started a\r\nsmall hospital for twenty-four patients at Minto House on his own\r\nresponsibility; but although he fortified himself with an influential\r\ncommittee and received a certain amount of annual subscriptions, the\r\nprincipal part of the expense throughout fell upon himself. Thus\r\nin the first year the public subscribed £217 and Mr. Syme £779,\r\nincluding £400 which he received in students’ fees. About this time,\r\ntoo, he married a sister of his old schoolfellow Robert Willis,\r\nafterwards the biographer of Sydenham, and set up a carriage. These\r\nexpenses led him into pecuniary difficulties, which were not easily\r\nsurmounted at first, but in a few years his circumstances became easy\r\nthrough the rapid increase of his practice.\r\n\r\nSyme’s clinical lectures became remarkable from the novelty of\r\nthe method he employed. It had been customary in Edinburgh to\r\nlecture on a certain number of cases somewhat resembling each\r\nother, without the patients’ presence or anything to emphasise the\r\ninstruction. The young innovator brought the patients one by one\r\ninto the lecture-room, questioned them, demonstrated the principal\r\nfeatures of their complaint, and then explained the principle of his\r\ntreatment, in the presence or absence of the patient, according to\r\ncircumstances, and finally operated, when necessary, in the presence\r\nof the pupils. Syme was a man of few words and earnest manner; he\r\nillustrated his remarks by few but well-chosen personal experiences,\r\nbut gave nothing superfluous; and it is not to be wondered at that\r\nhis success was marked.\r\n\r\nListon’s jealousy increased as the success of Minto House became\r\nassured. In 1830 Liston wrote in the subscription book of his rival’s\r\nhospital, “Don’t support quackery and humbug.” This led Syme to bring\r\nan action for libel against Liston, which the latter had to settle\r\nby apologising. In 1831, however, his exertions were successful\r\nin gaining the professorship of surgery at the Edinburgh College\r\nof Surgeons for his friend Lizars by a majority of one vote over\r\nSyme. In 1832, when Liston’s practical treatise “The Elements of\r\nSurgery” appeared, Syme also came forward with his more theoretical\r\n“Principles of Surgery.” In 1833 Syme took advantage of a chance\r\nwhich he longed for, and agreed with the retiring professor of\r\nclinical surgery in the University (Russell) to allow him £300 a\r\nyear for life if he became his successor. This was after Liston had\r\nrefused to come to any such arrangement. When it was carried into\r\neffect in 1833 the managers of the Infirmary felt that they must\r\nallow the new clinical professor to have wards for clinical teaching,\r\nnotwithstanding Liston’s active opposition.\r\n\r\nSyme’s success as a teacher followed him to the Infirmary, and pupils\r\ncrowded his wards. He was regularly present when Liston operated,\r\nbut never took any part with him. Syme’s appearance often, it is\r\nsaid, excited the evident scorn of Liston, though no open hostilities\r\ntook place. The strained condition of affairs was alleviated by the\r\nremoval of Liston to London in 1835. It is satisfactory to find that\r\nthe quarrel was finally healed in 1839, when Liston wrote to Syme,\r\n“Will you allow me to send you a copy of my last book? Write and tell\r\nme that you wish to have our grievances and sores not plastered up,\r\nbut firmly cicatrised.” A genial correspondence followed.\r\n\r\nWe wish it could be said of Syme that all his disputes were as\r\nhappily concluded. His intimate friend Dr. Belfrage, minister of\r\nSlateford, whom he consulted in all his difficulties, told him “he\r\nwas always right in the matter, but often wrong in the manner, of his\r\nquarrels;” and this must be held to account in part for the number\r\nand seriousness of the controversies in which he became involved, few\r\nof which, however, need be referred to here. It may be questioned\r\nwhether, on numerous occasions when Mr. Syme defended himself against\r\nattacks or brought actions for damages, he would not have done better\r\nto content himself with appealing to his well-known character and\r\nattainments, and living down aspersions. But Gregory and others in\r\nEdinburgh had left an evil habit of controversy in the air; and\r\nthough Syme was more moderate than his predecessors, he often had his\r\nhands full. Although he was himself a great improver of professional\r\npractice, he was really a conservative in his attitude towards\r\nother men and new methods. His opposition to Simpson’s discovery of\r\nanæsthetics, and to his introduction of acupressure for closing cut\r\nblood-vessels without the use of a ligature, is an example of this.\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that Syme’s numerous controversies left\r\nno detrimental impression on the public, and did not detract from\r\nthe warmth of affection which a host of friends testified towards him.\r\n\r\nListon’s removal to London left Syme practically in possession of\r\nthe leading surgical practice in Scotland at the age of thirty-five.\r\nSo marked was his progress that soon after the Queen’s accession\r\nhe was appointed Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen for Scotland. A\r\nlittle later a considerable fortune was left him by an uncle, and\r\nthenceforward he enjoyed an ease of circumstances which, while it\r\nrendered his actions independent, was not at all detrimental to his\r\nprofessional success. The good work which, in addition to operative\r\nsuccesses, he was accomplishing may be judged by the titles of\r\nthe papers contained in a selection from his published writings,\r\npublished in 1848. These “Contributions to the Pathology and Practice\r\nof Surgery” included, among others, papers on senile gangrene, on\r\nthe power of periosteum to form new bone, on ulcers of the leg,\r\non amputation at the ankle-joint, on the treatment of popliteal\r\naneurism, on excision of the ankle-joint, on the contractile or\r\nirritable stricture of the urethra, and on lithotomy. In all these\r\nhe introduced new modes of treatment or operation or propounded\r\nnew views, and many of his improvements are generally adopted. In\r\n1847 Liston’s sudden death led to his chair at University College,\r\nLondon, being offered to Syme. After anxious weighing of the question\r\nhe decided to accept the post. On his quitting Edinburgh he was\r\nentertained at dinner by more than a hundred members of the medical\r\nprofession. Dr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Christison, who presided,\r\nsaid no man had ever obtained so early in life as Syme the position\r\nof consulting surgeon for a whole nation; and this he owed entirely\r\nto his intrinsic merits. He referred to the collateral pursuits\r\nwith which many doctors had recreated themselves. Dr. Cullen had\r\nhis rural retreat; Dr. Gregory his Latin and polemics; Sir Charles\r\nBell his pencil and his rod; Mr. Liston his hunter; Mr. John Bell\r\nhis trombone. Mr. Syme had rendered his garden and conservatories\r\nconspicuous in a land of gardeners.\r\n\r\nMr. Syme arrived in London in February 1848, and settled in Bruton\r\nStreet. An amusing incident occurred in connection with his first\r\nlecture at University College. Having been accustomed to give\r\nclinical lectures in the operating theatre at Edinburgh, which was\r\nprovided with seats, he supposed a similar arrangement obtained in\r\nLondon, and announced his intention of lecturing in the operating\r\ntheatre without having previously visited it. On entering the room to\r\ndeliver his lecture, he found the students were seated inelegantly\r\non the rails which rise behind one another in the amphitheatre. This\r\nattitude shocked him at first, but was soon exchanged for a more\r\nbefitting one.\r\n\r\nDifficulties, however, arose in connection with the chair of\r\nsystematic surgery, which he was asked to undertake with that of\r\nclinical surgery. This he felt would occupy too much time, and\r\nrequire a devotion to theoretical surgery and to pathology which\r\ndid not accord with his bent. On the 7th of May some discourteous\r\ndemonstrations at the College prize distribution towards two of his\r\ncolleagues deeply wounded him; and he wrote “that the slightest\r\napproach to any insult of the kind, whether offered in the\r\ncomparative retirement of the lecture-room or inflicted publicly with\r\nthe silent sanction of the presiding authority of the College (Lord\r\nBrougham), would effectually incapacitate him from ever addressing\r\nhis pupils with satisfaction to himself or benefit to them.” In\r\nthree days afterwards, having declined the fresh post offered him,\r\nhe resigned that for which he had quitted Edinburgh. Fortunately\r\nhis old position at Edinburgh had not yet been filled up, and he\r\nreturned with alacrity to his familiar theatre and beloved home, his\r\nexperiment having cost him £2000. He had been well received by the\r\nheads of the profession in London, and was rapidly gaining practice.\r\nHis own brief comment on the change from Edinburgh to London was,\r\nthat ambition made him sacrifice happiness, and that he found such a\r\nspirit of dispeace in University College as to forbid any reasonable\r\nprospect of comfort.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding years furnish a multitude of records of honours paid\r\nto Professor Syme, and of distinguished successes in operating. In\r\n1848-9 he was elected president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of\r\nEdinburgh, and greatly elevated the character of its proceedings;\r\nin 1850-1 he was president of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. For\r\nyears few numbers of the _Monthly Medical Journal_ appeared without\r\na lecture, case, or observation of importance from him. One of his\r\nmost striking operations was the removal of the entire upper-jaw bone\r\nby making one incision in the cheek, with perfect success; the wound\r\nhealed without a drop of matter, and it was difficult subsequently to\r\ntrace the line of incision. The patient’s articulation remained quite\r\ndistinct. Two of his most difficult operations in 1857 were connected\r\nwith the tying of arteries for cure of aneurisms—one of the carotid,\r\nthe other of the iliac, artery. The frightful risks and the excellent\r\nprocedure by which they were successfully encountered still further\r\nenhanced Mr. Syme’s great reputation. In 1856-7 his “Principles\r\nof Surgery” reached a fourth edition. Its terse style and clear\r\nexposition had rendered it a great favourite with practical surgeons.\r\nA striking feature in it is the constant reference to fundamental\r\nprinciples. It was said of him at this period, “Mr. Syme is never at\r\nfault. Something unforeseen or unexpected may occur, but its import\r\nis at once understood and the contingency provided for.”\r\n\r\nAt the Great Exhibition of 1862 Syme was chosen chairman of the\r\njury on surgical instruments. In 1863 he visited Dublin once more,\r\nand expounded his principles before the leading surgeons, being\r\nreceived there as a man of European reputation. His operations for\r\nthe relief of axillary and carotid aneurisms, as well as his bold\r\nexcision of the whole scapula for tumour, with safety and without\r\nmuch loss of blood, were continually increasing his fame. In 1864\r\nhe published his work on the Excision of the Scapula, and proved\r\nthat the wound might heal quickly and soundly, and the arm remain\r\nstrong and useful. A great operation for relief of a distressing\r\ndisease by excision of a large part of the tongue was wonderfully\r\nsuccessful in November 1864. This was the last case Syme had time\r\nto publish. In August 1865 he gave the address in surgery at the\r\nmeeting of the British Medical Association in Leamington. In it he\r\ngave a graphic account of modern improvements in surgery, in which\r\nhe had himself a large share, and contrasted it with the state of\r\nthings at the beginning of his professional career. It constituted a\r\nmost valuable review of the history of surgery during the century.\r\nSyme was the first representative at the Medical Council of the\r\nUniversities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and might not improbably\r\nhave been its president but for his illness and death. His last\r\ngreat controversy was that known at Edinburgh as the “Battle of the\r\nSites.” A new hospital was required, and at first, in 1866, Syme was\r\nstrongly in favour of a new building on the old site. But further\r\nexperience of erysipelas and pyæmia in the old hospital convinced him\r\nof the necessity of having an entirely new building in which the old\r\ndisadvantages would be absent. He consequently changed his view,\r\nand strongly advocated the new plan, which was ultimately, in 1869,\r\naccepted. But he did not live to see the new work begun.\r\n\r\nIn private life Syme was genial and happy, throwing off all\r\nprofessional cares, quarrels, and anxieties in the home circle. His\r\nunobtrusive religion was an essential feature of his character. He\r\nwas devoted to truth and earnest in its advocacy, and hence sprang\r\nmany of his controversies; but he had no love for controversy as\r\nsuch. His domestic life was very happy, though broken at various\r\ntimes by death. His first wife died in 1846: of her numerous family\r\ntwo daughters only survived to adult age, one of them being now the\r\nwife of Sir Joseph Lister. His second wife was the sister of Burn,\r\nthe architect: this union was equally happy with the former; but the\r\nsecond Mrs. Syme also died before him. Her youngest child was Mr.\r\nJames Syme, the present proprietor of Millbank. This house and estate\r\nProfessor Syme decorated and improved with all that horticulture and\r\nexcellent taste could devise, and it was under his sway one of the\r\nmost charming resorts near Edinburgh. His social gatherings of eight,\r\nten, or twelve choice spirits were delightful, and his hospitality\r\nwas both large and discriminating.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to record that Mr. Syme welcomed the greatest surgical\r\nimprovement of modern times, that brought forward by Professor\r\nLister, his son-in-law. In 1868 he contributed a valuable paper\r\nto the _British Medical Journal_ “On the Antiseptic Method of\r\nTreatment in Surgery,” by which he greatly aided its progress. This\r\nwas his last year of full practice. In April 1869 he was seized with\r\nparalysis, resigned his professorship and surgeoncy soon after, but\r\nrecovered sufficiently in the autumn to receive a testimonial in St.\r\nJames’s Hall, London (November 10, 1869), at a public dinner in which\r\nthe leaders of the profession vied with one another in honouring\r\nhim. The testimonial took the form of the endowment of a surgical\r\nfellowship in the University of Edinburgh, in addition to the placing\r\nof a marble bust in the Infirmary or University library. A bust was\r\nsubsequently placed in both of these situations. Syme at length died,\r\nafter repeated attacks of paralysis, on the 20th of June 1870.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by Professor Goodsir, that few men come to\r\ntheir principles at such an early age as Mr. Syme. His terseness of\r\nwriting aided greatly in their propagation, and his practice was\r\nextended far and wide by the assurance that “he never wasted a word,\r\nnor a drop of ink, nor a drop of blood.” He was great too in his\r\nconservation of all parts which might by any dexterity and patience\r\nbe made useful. His revival of operations for the excision of joints\r\nrather than the amputation of limbs is an instance of this. Syme’s\r\noperation of amputation at the ankle-joint will always remain in\r\nvogue as the least fatal and most useful in surgery.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lister has thus summed up Syme’s character as a surgeon—“A\r\npractical surgeon, Mr. Syme presented a remarkable combination of\r\nqualities; and we have not known whether to admire most the soundness\r\nof his pathological knowledge, his skill in diagnosis, resembling\r\nintuition, though in reality the result of acute and accurate\r\nobservation and laborious experience, well stored and methodised; the\r\nrapidity and soundness of his judgment, his fertility in resources\r\nas an operator, combined with simplicity of the means employed,\r\nhis skill and celerity of execution, his fearless courage, or the\r\nsingleness of purpose with which all his proceedings were directed to\r\nthe good of his patients.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough his fame has been overshadowed by the greater distinction\r\nof Liston and Syme, John Lizars deserves mention, not only as a\r\nbrilliant operator, but also as a teacher, lecturer, and author. He\r\nwas fortunate in his instructor, having been the pupil and apprentice\r\nof John Bell. After obtaining his qualification in 1808 Lizars\r\nbecame a naval surgeon, and saw good service on the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese coasts in Lord Exmouth’s fleet. He left the navy in 1815,\r\nand settled in Edinburgh, joining Allan, who lectured on surgery,\r\nand taking himself the departments of anatomy and surgery. Later,\r\nwhen this partnership was dissolved, Lizars continued to lecture,\r\nadding surgery before long to his programme, and hence being almost\r\nincessantly engaged during the prolonged winter session with his\r\ndaily lectures on each subject. His zeal and method attracted, and\r\nretained for years, classes frequently numbering one hundred and\r\nfifty. He was obliged after a time to limit his labours when the\r\nEdinburgh College of Surgeons decided to recognise lectures in\r\none department only from any given lecturer; and he resigned his\r\nanatomical lectures to his brother Alexander, afterwards Professor of\r\nAnatomy in the University of Edinburgh, and thenceforward lectured\r\non surgery alone. In 1831 John Lizars was appointed Professor of\r\nSurgery to the College of Surgeons, a post which he held for eight\r\nyears. He had previously become surgeon in the Infirmary, and was\r\nconsiderably senior to Liston. The two were not unworthy compeers as\r\nregarded brilliancy in operating. Lizars’ ease and coolness under\r\ncircumstances of difficulty were remarkable. He is said to have been\r\nthe first who performed the operation for the removal of the lower\r\njaw.\r\n\r\nLizars published a “System of Practical Surgery”; but is perhaps best\r\nknown for his great folio series of coloured “Anatomical Plates”\r\nwith companion (octavo) volume of text. The engravings of the plates\r\nwere for the most part made from original dissections by himself.\r\nThey formed an immense series of illustrations, occupying 110 folio\r\nplates, and some of them, especially those on the brain and nervous\r\nsystem, can scarcely be surpassed for artistic excellence. It was\r\nreally a magnificent work for its day, and had a very large sale;\r\nand as regards a great portion of the contents, since they show\r\nactual facts, they cannot be superseded. After his retirement from\r\nteaching, Lizars devoted himself to private practice, both surgical\r\nand general. He died at Edinburgh, May 21, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The writer is indebted for this anecdote to Dr. Paterson’s\r\n“Memorials of the Life of James Syme,” in which a number of incidents\r\nrelating to Liston are given, with an interesting parallel between\r\nthe careers of the two great surgeons (chapter xii., p. 210-216). It\r\nis much to be regretted that no biography of Robert Liston has yet\r\nbeen written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_BAILLIE, HALFORD, CHAMBERS, AND HOLLAND, THE FASHIONABLE AND COURTLY\r\nPHYSICIANS._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne cannot more strikingly emphasise the change which has taken place\r\nduring the present century in the views and practice of medical men\r\nthan by quoting from Sir Henry Halford’s biographical notice of\r\nBaillie, the nephew of William and John Hunter, and brother of Joanna\r\nBaillie. Here we have Halford acknowledging a current sentiment\r\nagainst physical examination of the patient. “He (Baillie) appeared\r\nto lay a great stress upon the information which he might derive from\r\nthe external examination of his patient, and to be much influenced\r\nin the formation of his opinion of the nature of the complaint\r\nby this practice. He had originally adopted this habit from the\r\npeculiar turn of his early studies,—and assuredly such a method, not\r\nindiscriminately but judiciously employed, as he employed it, is a\r\nvaluable auxiliary to the other ordinary means used by a physician,\r\nof obtaining the knowledge of a disease submitted to him. But it is\r\nequally true that, notwithstanding its air of mechanical precision,\r\nsuch examination is not to be depended upon beyond a certain point.\r\nGreat disordered action may prevail in a part without having yet\r\nproduced such disorganisation as may be sensibly felt; and to doubt\r\nof the existence of a disease because it is not discoverable to\r\nthe touch, is not only unphilosophical, but must surely, in many\r\ninstances, lead to unfounded and erroneous conclusions. One of the\r\ninevitable consequences of such a system is frequent disappointment\r\nin foretelling the issue of the malady, that most important of all\r\npoints to the reputation of a physician, and though such a mode of\r\ninvestigation might not prove unsuccessful in the skilful hands\r\nof Dr. Baillie, it must be allowed to be an example of dangerous\r\ntendency to those who have not had his means of acquiring knowledge,\r\nnor enjoyed the advantages of his great experience, nor have learned\r\nby the previous steps of education and good discipline to reason and\r\njudge correctly.” Halford then refers to the quickness with which a\r\ngood physician makes up his mind on the nature of a disease; at that\r\ntime it was oftener a guess than a process of reasoning. Baillie\r\nwas one of the first to study pathology, and to bring into practice\r\nphysical examination.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW BAILLIE was born on the 27th October 1761, in the manse of\r\nShotts, Lanarkshire, his father having been Professor of Divinity\r\nin Glasgow University, his mother, Dorothea, sister of William and\r\nJohn Hunter. After two sessions at Glasgow, Baillie entered, in 1779,\r\nat Balliol College, Oxford, where he completed his M.D. in 1789.\r\nResiding during vacations with William Hunter, he became almost\r\nlike a son to him, and assisted him much in making his anatomical\r\npreparations and superintending his dissecting-room. On the death of\r\nhis uncle in 1783, he and Cruickshank continued the lectures with\r\ngreat success. Baillie lectured till 1799. One of his pupils said\r\nof him that his style, though not eloquent, irresistibly commanded\r\nattention; he appeared completely master of his subject, was\r\nexceedingly clear, concise, and condensed, and never at a loss for an\r\nappropriate word. He was always modest and unostentatious. When left\r\nsole heir of his uncle William, he at once transferred to John Hunter\r\nthe family estate of Long Calderwood, to which he regarded him as\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\nBaillie’s principal work is pathological. In 1793 he published “The\r\nMorbid Anatomy of some of the most Important Parts of the Human\r\nBody,” and although pathology is now very different from what it was\r\nin his day, and his classification is not now useful, his facts, when\r\nproperly interpreted, are still found excellent. The work met with\r\nvery great success, and was translated into many European languages,\r\nbesides going through five English editions in the author’s lifetime.\r\n\r\nBaillie gradually got into good practice, being appointed physician\r\nto St. George’s Hospital in 1787, elected Fellow of the College\r\nof Physicians in 1790, Censor in 1791 and 1796, and Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society in 1789. On the retirement of Dr. Pitcairn from\r\npractice in 1798, Baillie succeeded to a great part of it, and\r\nhis practice was still further benefited by his marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Dr. Denman, whose great obstetric practice enabled him\r\nto recommend Baillie very frequently. He resigned his hospital work\r\nin 1799, and from that time had perhaps the leading practice in\r\nLondon, making ten thousand pounds in some years. He was consulted\r\nabout George III.’s case, and in 1810 was made Physician to the\r\nKing and offered a baronetcy, which he declined. In 1814 he was\r\nalso appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Princess Charlotte, and\r\nattended many members of the royal family. His manner towards his\r\nfellow-practitioners was as pleasing as his conduct to patients. To\r\nboth he would carefully explain, as far as possible, his views of the\r\nnature of the case and the treatment required, and he was exceedingly\r\nsuccessful in tranquillising the apprehensions of his patients.\r\nHis modesty was transparent. He would say to his friends: “I know\r\nbetter perhaps than another man, from my knowledge of anatomy, how\r\nto discover a disease, but when I have done so, I do not know better\r\nhow to cure it.” From this one is not surprised to learn that he\r\nwas not fertile in expedients, but if the simplest means failed, he\r\nwas often at a loss what to do next, and was not apt at varying his\r\nprescriptions.\r\n\r\nBaillie was not without an irritability of temper, in which we see\r\nsome resemblance to John Hunter; but his heart was at bottom most\r\nkindly. He would often say after an outbreak, “I have spoken roughly\r\nto that poor man; I must go and see him, be it ever so late;” “that\r\npatient is in better health than I am myself, but I have been too\r\nhard with him, I must make him amends.” There were many instances of\r\nhis great and delicate generosity to his patients. Overwork, to the\r\nextent of devoting sixteen hours a day to practice, enfeebled his\r\nconstitution, and before the age of sixty he was compelled to retire\r\nin a large measure from practice. He died at his seat, Duntisbourne\r\nHouse, near Cirencester, on the 23d September 1823, leaving a fortune\r\nof £80,000. He bequeathed a considerable sum to the College of\r\nPhysicians, with his manuscripts and other interesting curiosities,\r\nsuch as the gold-headed cane used by Radcliffe, Mead, and others,\r\nwhose arms are engraved on it. He was buried in Duntisbourne Church,\r\nbut his memory was commemorated by his professional friends by a\r\nfine bust by Chantrey in Westminster Abbey. His excellent qualities\r\nand his strong religious principle were well set forth by Sir Henry\r\nHalford in an address to the College of Physicians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir HENRY HALFORD was long a contemporary of Baillie, but\r\nsurvived him more than twenty years. He was the second son of\r\nDr. James Vaughan, a successful physician at Leicester, whose\r\nthird son became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas; the fourth\r\nson was Dean of Chester and Warden of Merton College, Oxford;\r\nthe fifth, Envoy-extraordinary to the United States; and the\r\nsixth was the father of Dean Vaughan, the well-known Master of\r\nthe Temple. The eldest son died in his twenty-third year. The\r\ndistinction which Vaughan’s sons attained shows that his judgment\r\nwas admirably exercised in their education. In fact, he spent his\r\nwhole professional income in providing for them the best possible\r\neducational aids. Henry, like the others, was sent from Rugby to\r\nOxford (the youngest only going to Cambridge); and he records, in\r\neulogising his father’s treatment of them, that not one of them\r\nasked or received further pecuniary assistance from him after he had\r\nfinished his education, and commenced his own efforts to provide for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHenry Vaughan was born on October 2d, 1766. Entering at Christchurch,\r\nOxford, he graduated B.A. in 1788, M.D. 1791. He studied medicine\r\nfor some months at Edinburgh, and also practised for a time with his\r\nfather at Leicester. About 1792 he came to London, and having a good\r\nopening through his Oxford friends, had courage enough to borrow\r\n£1000 on his own security in order to establish himself in London\r\npractice. Here his good manners and evident learning stood him in\r\ngood stead, and he was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital\r\nin 1793, becoming a Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1794. In\r\nMarch 1795 he still further promoted his advancement by his marriage\r\nwith the third daughter of Lord St. John, and rapidly rose into note.\r\nWith all his talents, however, it looks like one of fortune’s freaks\r\nthat Vaughan should have been appointed Physician-Extraordinary to\r\nthe King in 1793, at the age of twenty-seven; and that his practice\r\nshould have so increased that in 1800 he was compelled to give up his\r\nhospital appointment. But fortune had more favours in store for him.\r\nHe inherited a large property on the death of Lady Denbigh, widow of\r\nhis mother’s cousin, Sir Charles Halford; and he consequently changed\r\nhis name in 1809 by Act of Parliament from Vaughan to Halford. George\r\nIII. created him a baronet in the same year.\r\n\r\nThe King had indeed a strong preference for Sir Henry Halford, as\r\nhe now became. He secured Sir Henry’s promise, before the onset of\r\nhis last long derangement, that he would not leave him, and that if\r\nnecessary he would call in also Dr. Heberden and Dr. Baillie. To\r\nrecite the number of royal personages to whom Sir Henry was physician\r\nwould be tedious; suffice it to mention that he attended, besides\r\nGeorge III., George IV., William IV., and Queen Victoria, having thus\r\nbeen the physician of four English sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Halford possessed talents of a high order. He\r\nis said to have been inferior to Baillie in accuracy of diagnosis,\r\nbut superior in the cure and alleviation of disease. He had quick\r\nperception, sound judgment, and great knowledge of the powers of\r\nmedicines. For many years after Baillie’s illness and death he was\r\nundisputedly at the head of London practice. At the College of\r\nPhysicians his rule continued unchecked, if not unquestioned, for\r\nmore than twenty years, he having been President from 1820 till\r\nhis death on the 9th of March 1844. He was largely instrumental in\r\nsecuring the removal of the College from Warwick Lane in the city\r\nto the present commodious building in Pall Mall East. His bust by\r\nChantrey was presented to the College by a number of Fellows. His\r\nportrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence is at Wistow, Leicestershire, where\r\nhe was buried in the parish church.\r\n\r\nHalford’s early success was not favourable to his prosecuting\r\noriginal research nor to his publishing much that is important. His\r\nchief publications were first given as addresses to meetings of\r\nthe College of Physicians. In these he showed skill and pleasing\r\nliterary art. He wrote on the Climacteric Disease, on the Necessity\r\nof Caution in the Estimation of Symptoms in the Last Stages of some\r\nDiseases, on the Tic Douloureux, on Shakespeare’s Test of Insanity\r\n(Hamlet, Act iii. Sc. 4), on the Influence of some of the Diseases\r\nof the Body on the Mind, on Gout, on Phlegmasia Dolens, on the\r\nTreatment of Insanity, and on the Deaths of some Illustrious Persons\r\nof Antiquity—and again, on the Deaths of some Eminent Persons of\r\nModern Times. It is to be regretted perhaps that a man of such\r\naccomplishments should have left so little behind him; but he was\r\nof use to his day and generation; and as to the knowledge he had\r\nattained, it served him only to affix the term “conjectural” to\r\nmedicine, when speaking of the confidence Baillie inspired. At least\r\nhe did not seem to have hidden from himself how little the medicine\r\nof his days could lay claim to being completely informed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FREDRIC CHAMBERS, the son of an East Indian civil servant,\r\nwhose family belonged to Northumberland, was born in India in\r\n1786. Brought to England in 1793 in consequence of his father’s\r\ndeath, he was educated at Bath, Westminster, and Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1808. He had hoped for a\r\nfellowship, intending to take orders; but being disappointed, he\r\nturned to medicine, and entered at the Great Windmill Street School,\r\nsubsequently spending a year at Edinburgh, and returning to study\r\nat St. George’s Hospital, the Eye Infirmary at Moorfields, and at\r\nBateman’s celebrated Dispensary. His diligence, both in practical\r\nmedical study and in dissections, attracted the attention of the St.\r\nGeorge’s physicians, and on the resignation of Dr. Pelham Warren,\r\nthen one of the leaders of London practice, he was brought forward\r\nand elected physician to the Hospital in 1816 when only thirty years\r\nof age. His East Indian connection secured him, in 1819, the post\r\nof examining physician to the East India Company, after being some\r\ntime assistant-physician. Notwithstanding his early prominence, his\r\nprofessional income rose but slowly, showing that neither ability\r\nnor patronage will avail greatly in competition with the established\r\nfavourites. It was 1825 before Chambers’s practice amounted to\r\n£2000; and his pre-eminence was not marked till the death of Dr.\r\nMaton in 1835, and the great age of Sir Henry Halford (who died\r\nin 1844), left him in indisputed possession of the leading London\r\npractice. From 1836 to about 1851 he received in fees between seven\r\nand nine thousand guineas a year. In 1836 he was consulted by Queen\r\nAdelaide, and in 1837 was made Physician-in-Ordinary to William IV.,\r\ndeclining knighthood, though made Commander of the Guelphic order.\r\nHe was continued as Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria, and\r\nhis successful career was uninterrupted, except by rather frequent\r\nill-health. About 1851, owing to the failure of his health, he\r\nretired from practice, and settled near Lymington, where he died on\r\nthe 17th December 1855.\r\n\r\nChambers did not win his success either by writing, teaching, or\r\ndiscovering. In addition to a tall commanding figure, and the most\r\nagreeable, yet straightforward manners, he possessed striking\r\ndecision, and pursued bold and successful plans of treatment in\r\nacute diseases. He kept himself well acquainted with the advances of\r\nothers, and was early distinguished by his adopting the stethoscope.\r\nLike many men of great eminence, he was at heart exceedingly\r\ndiffident, and felt acutely the responsibilities which he undertook.\r\nHe was continually in fear of doing something wrong or making a\r\nmistake. Thus he undoubtedly was a most conscientious physician,\r\nand it is to be feared that he gave himself much suffering by the\r\nminutely painstaking system that he adopted. Both at the hospital\r\nand in private practice, he personally recorded the particulars\r\nof every case that he saw, together with all his prescriptions—an\r\nastounding instance of laborious effort. In this way his private\r\npractice furnished sixty-seven large quarto volumes of notes, which\r\nwere every day completely written up, and carefully indexed, so\r\nthat he could refer with the utmost ease to any case he had ever\r\nseen. Moreover, he made in very many instances sketch maps of the\r\ndiseased organs, side by side with the description. So persistent was\r\nhe in this conscientious toil, that he often continued it far into\r\nthe night and even till daylight, resuming work again before nine\r\no’clock. Ill-health was a necessary consequence, but his reliability\r\nwas certain to tell in practice. He could scarcely depend on a single\r\nregular meal a day, so great was the demand for his services. He\r\nliterally rushed through the streets driven post-haste at ten miles\r\nan hour. After a serious illness in 1834, through having absorbed\r\npoisonous matter from a patient who had died of pleurisy, his right\r\nhand was distorted by the results of abscesses; and it was hence\r\nvulgarly reported that his fingers had become crooked from the\r\ncontinual habit of taking fees. The regard he won from others may be\r\nevidenced by the fact that Sir Benjamin Brodie for some weeks visited\r\nhim daily during this illness at Tunbridge Wells, when this entailed\r\nmuch greater loss of time than now. His liberality was well known,\r\nand this, with his frequent illnesses, caused him to accumulate no\r\ngreat fortune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to Sir HENRY HOLLAND, it is with regret that we own\r\nhow comparatively slight are his claims to a place in the gallery\r\nof great medical men. He was accomplished beyond most men, but\r\none is compelled to ask, what did he accomplish with his great\r\nopportunities? Whom did he teach? what did he teach? what did he\r\ndiscover? His travelling excursions extended over almost the whole\r\nglobe except Australia. He was intimate for more than half a century\r\nwith many men and women of mark on both Continents. He knew well\r\nthe Presidents and statesmen of the United States; prescribed for\r\nsix Prime Ministers of England, as well as for its sovereigns and\r\nprinces. But even in regard to information of moment which he might\r\njustifiably have given concerning them, he has been strikingly\r\nreticent in his “Recollections of Past Life.”\r\n\r\nHenry Holland, the son of Peter Holland, a much-respected medical\r\npractitioner, was born at Knutsford in Cheshire, on October 27,\r\n1788. His maternal grandmother was a sister of Josiah Wedgwood, the\r\neminent potter, and grandfather of Charles Darwin. Holland was also a\r\ncousin of Mrs. Gaskell, the author of “Mary Barton,” and biographer\r\nof Charlotte Brontë. He was educated first at Newcastle-on-Tyne\r\nunder the Rev. W. Turner, and early showed his predilection for\r\ntravel by making long pedestrian excursions in the neighbourhood.\r\nIn 1803, he went for a year to Dr. Estlin’s school, near Bristol,\r\nwhere he succeeded at once to the position of head boy, left vacant\r\nby John Cam Hobhouse, afterwards Lord Broughton, and where he also\r\ncommenced his long friendship with Richard Bright, who has already\r\nbeen mentioned in this work. His classical and literary tastes here\r\ndeveloped, and were further fostered by a vacation passed at Dr.\r\nAikin’s at Stoke Newington, and in the society of his sister Mrs.\r\nBarbauld and his daughter Lucy Aikin. Still, young Holland leaned\r\ntowards a commercial life, and entered a Liverpool merchant’s\r\noffice, with the stipulation that he was to spend two sessions at\r\nGlasgow University. These saved him from being bound to a merchant’s\r\ndesk; for after his second session, 1805-6, he sought and obtained\r\nrelease, and took up medicine. At Glasgow he had become intimate with\r\nWilliam Hamilton (afterwards Sir William), his discussions with whom\r\nhad doubtless a considerable influence on his mental development.\r\nHolland’s literary talent already began to show itself, for he was\r\nselected at the age of eighteen to draw up a Statistical Report on\r\nthe Agriculture of Cheshire for Government, and received for it £200,\r\ndouble the sum proposed.\r\n\r\nIn October 1806, Holland entered at the Edinburgh Medical School;\r\nbut he did not confine himself exclusively to one school, for he\r\nspent two succeeding winters in the Borough Schools of London, Guy’s\r\nand St. Thomas’s, and in private study. Resuming at Edinburgh, he\r\ntook his degree in 1811. Travel had already found him apt; in 1810\r\nhe went to Iceland with Sir George Mackenzie and Richard Bright, and\r\ncontributed considerable portions to the narrative of the expedition.\r\nHolland early became associated with the Whig section of Edinburgh\r\nsociety, but he saw much of its general aspects, and he knew Walter\r\nScott, Dugald Stewart, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Erskine, and many\r\nothers known to fame. He had already made the acquaintance of Maria\r\nEdgeworth during a visit to Ireland; and her letters to him would in\r\nthemselves fill a volume. Everywhere the bright pleasing intelligent\r\nyouth was welcomed. As he could not yet be admitted by the College of\r\nPhysicians owing to his lack of years, he undertook extensive travels\r\non the Continent, venturing into little-known regions, and published\r\nhis “Travels in Portugal, Sicily, the Ionian Islands, and Greece,”\r\nin 1815, a work which yet further increased his fashionable repute.\r\nMrs. Piozzi, writing from Bath in 1815, says, “We have had a fine Dr.\r\nHolland here. He has seen and written about the Ionian Islands, and\r\nmeans now to practise as a physician—exchanging the Cyclades, say we\r\nwits and wags, for the sick ladies. We made quite a lion of the man.\r\nI was invited to every house he visited at for the last three days.\r\nSo I got the _queue du lion_, despairing of _le cœur_.”\r\n\r\nHolland had spent much time in the military hospitals in Portugal\r\nduring his travels, and gained valuable experience. In Turkey he came\r\ninto contact with Ali Pasha, through whom he was deprived of most of\r\nhis papers relating to Albania, a mortifying loss at the time. After\r\nhis return home he speedily formed friendships with Lords Lansdowne,\r\nAberdeen, and Holland, which continued uninterrupted save by death,\r\nand of course led to his intimacy with many other persons of note,\r\ntraits in whose characters are recorded in the “Recollections.” We\r\ncannot here follow the incidents of the brilliant social life into\r\nwhich Henry Holland entered with so much zest. Suffice it to mention\r\nthat he was elected to the Royal Society in 1816, and admitted on the\r\nsame day as Lord Byron, who on that occasion made his only visit.\r\nHenry Holland was an almost constant guest at Holland House. In the\r\nsummer of 1814 he became domestic medical attendant on the Princess\r\n(afterwards Queen) Caroline, to accompany her during her first year\r\nof travel on the Continent. This situation became one of extreme\r\ndelicacy, and its importance was very manifest at her trial years\r\nafterwards, where Dr. Holland’s evidence, declaring that he had never\r\nseen anything improper or derogatory in her behaviour to Bergami or\r\nany other person, proved of extreme weight in her behalf.\r\n\r\nA man of such connections could not fail to gain almost as much\r\npractice as he liked. His visits to Spa for four successive years,\r\nafter the London season, strengthened his professional prospects,\r\nand his fourth year’s practice brought him over £1200. In a few\r\nyears he was able to resolve that his professional income should\r\nnever exceed £5000, and that he would give to study, recreation,\r\nor travel all his surplus time. Thus happily placed, Henry Holland\r\nbecame the friend of every man of note, the patron of science at\r\nthe Royal Institution, of which he was long president—but not the\r\nhospital physician, the clinical teacher, the original writer, the\r\npromoter of medical reform, or the habitué of the medical societies.\r\nHe dined out, and never reproved his patients for the lapses from\r\nphysiological prudence which he observed at the table. The “frequent\r\nhalf hour of genial conversation” was what he bestowed and was most\r\ncapable of bestowing on his patients. Perhaps he thereby solaced\r\ntheir days of tedium or hypochondria as well as others who might have\r\nsought to root up their habits or impart tone to their minds with\r\nmore ruthless energy. “When Lady Palmerston was suffering from an\r\nillness that occasioned some alarm to her friends,” said the _Times_,\r\nin its obituary notice of Holland, “one of them, meeting the late Dr.\r\nFergusson, asked anxiously how she was. ‘I can’t give you a better\r\nnotion of her recovery,’ was the reply, ‘than by telling you that I\r\nhave just received my last fee, and that she is now left entirely to\r\nHolland.’” On this being repeated to Lord Palmerston his lordship\r\nmused a little, and then said, “Ah! I see what he means. When you\r\ntrust yourself to Holland, you should have a superfluous stock of\r\nhealth for him to work upon.” Holland himself had this superfluous\r\nstock of health. When over eighty he writes: “A frequent source of\r\namusement to myself is my incapacity for walking slowly; and the\r\nsort of compulsion I even now feel to pass those immediately before\r\nme in the street, and to take the diagonal instead of the two sides\r\nof a square, whenever this is the alternative. When I cease to take\r\nthe diagonal (often a dirty one) instead of the side pavements, I\r\nshall consider that I have gone a step downwards in the path of\r\nlife.” His excursions were almost all taken alone; but he evidently\r\nseldom put himself out of the reach of general society, as good\r\nas the neighbourhood afforded. He was no recluse, yet apparently\r\nnot a man of a few warm strong personal friendships. If he was we\r\nfind no record of it. From his utter reticence about his medical\r\ncontemporaries, we should judge that he did not at bottom appreciate\r\nthem as they deserved.\r\n\r\nTo give briefly a few of the more notable dates in Holland’s life, he\r\nmarried first, in 1822, a Miss Caldwell, who died in 1830, leaving\r\ntwo sons, the present Sir Henry Holland and the Rev. F. J. Holland;\r\nand secondly, in 1834, Saba, daughter of Sydney Smith. He was made\r\nPhysician-Extraordinary to the Queen in 1837; Physician-in-Ordinary\r\nto the Prince-Consort in 1840; was offered, but declined, a\r\nbaronetcy by Lord Melbourne in 1841; was made Physician-in-Ordinary\r\nto the Queen in 1852, and accepted a baronetcy in 1853. In later\r\nyears he withdrew altogether from practice, but continued active in\r\nsociety and persevering in travel. In his last journey, to Russia, he\r\nwas accompanied by his son, the Rev. F. J. Holland; on his way back\r\nhe attended the trial of Marshal Bazaine at Versailles on the 24th\r\nOctober 1873, dined the same day at the British Embassy, returned\r\nto London the next day, did not go out on Sunday the 26th, and died\r\nquietly in bed on the 27th, on the 85th anniversary of his birth.\r\n\r\nTo this extraordinary age lived the man who had been seen in all\r\nclimates, in the Arctic Circle or in the Tropics, on the Prairies or\r\nthe Pyramids, in the same black dress coat in which he almost ran\r\nfrom house to house at home. Sydney Smith said of him that he started\r\noff for two months at a time with a box of pills in one pocket and\r\na clean shirt in the other—occasionally forgetting the shirt. Let\r\nSir Henry tell his own tale of his enjoyment. “The Danube I have\r\nfollowed, with scarcely an interruption, from its assumed sources at\r\nDonau-Eschingen to the Black Sea—the Rhine, now become so familiar to\r\ncommon travel, from the infant stream in the Alps. The St. Lawrence\r\nI have pursued uninterruptedly for nearly two thousand miles of its\r\nlake and river course. The waters of the Upper Mississippi I have\r\nrecently navigated for some hundred miles below the falls of St.\r\nAnthony. The Ohio, Susquehanna, Potomac, and Connecticut rivers I\r\nhave followed far towards their sources; and the Ottawa, grand in\r\nits scenery of waterfalls, lakes, forests, and mountain gorges, for\r\nthree hundred miles above Montreal. There has been pleasure to me\r\nalso in touching upon some single point of a river, and watching the\r\nflow of waters which come from unknown springs or find their issue in\r\nsome remote ocean or sea. I have felt this on the Nile at its time of\r\nhighest inundation, in crossing the Volga when scarcely wider than\r\nthe Thames at Oxford, and still more when near the sources of the\r\nstreams that feed the Euphrates, south of Trebizond.” Altogether Sir\r\nHenry estimated that he had spent twelve years of his life in foreign\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nLiterary work was a pastime with Holland, and both in the Quarterly\r\nand the Edinburgh Reviews he delighted to show his extensive\r\nreading, and his enlightened yet very unrevolutionary views. His\r\nmore interesting reviews have been published as “Scientific Essays,”\r\nand “Chapters on Mental Physiology;” while his “Medical Notes and\r\nReflections” constitutes almost all his practical contribution to\r\nmedical science. Interesting “Fragmentary Papers” were published\r\nposthumously. In the “Medical Notes” certain current questions\r\nwere philosophically discussed in a most pleasing style, and some\r\nquestions of practice treated with some originality if not with\r\nboldness. Two chapters may be especially alluded to as valuable,\r\nnamely, those “On the Abuse of Purgative Medicines,” and “On\r\nBleeding in Affections of the Brain.” Many of his chapters on\r\nMental Physiology show wide observation and kindly insight into the\r\nrelations of mind and body. But after all it is by his “Recollections\r\nof Past Life” that Holland will be most known, his sketches of the\r\nleading personages, politicians, wits, and scientific and literary\r\nmen having a charming vividness and truthfulness about them, making\r\nevery one regret that so many limitations were imposed by the author\r\nupon himself when he might have easily furnished so much more\r\nmaterial for history.\r\n\r\nHolland was of the middle height, spare in appearance, but very\r\nactive; with a countenance not indicative of the highest mental\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_SIR WILLIAM FERGUSSON AND CONSERVATIVE SURGERY._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe association of the word “conservative” with operative surgery, so\r\nstrongly identified in the popular mind with the removal of portions\r\nof the body, needs some explanation to the non-professional reader.\r\nIn former times inflammation with denudation of bone was commonly\r\nbelieved to necessitate amputation; and diseased joints, especially\r\nthe elbow, knee and ankle, with ulceration of cartilages, were\r\ngenerally considered incurable, except by removal of the limb. As\r\nFergusson said, the ways of surgery get grooved; they are hallowed in\r\nthe estimation of some. The man who steps from the groove is held to\r\nbe rash and is called to account. How much this was the case will be\r\nseen by the reception accorded to conservative surgery, which aspired\r\nto do away with many of the radical proceedings of the past.\r\n\r\nThe term “conservative surgery,” as first used by Sir W. Fergusson\r\nin 1852, meant operations for the preservation of some part of the\r\nbody, which would otherwise have been unnecessarily sacrificed. A\r\nsmaller and more limited operation was undertaken to remove simply\r\nthe incurably disorganised portion of the body, such as a diseased\r\njoint, and not an entire limb. Thus Fergusson said, “a compromise\r\nmay be made, whereby the original constitution and frame, as from\r\nthe Maker’s hand, may be kept as nearly as possible in its normal\r\nstate of integrity.” “No one can more thoroughly appreciate a\r\nwell-performed amputation than I do, but I certainly appreciate\r\nmore highly the operation which sets aside the necessity for that\r\nmutilation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo great surgeons thus bear testimony to Fergusson: “The\r\nimprovements which he introduced in lithotrity and in the cure of\r\ncleft-palate may almost be considered typical,” says Sir Spencer\r\nWells,[3] “of the school of modern conservative surgery, and will\r\nlong be acknowledged as triumphs of British surgery in the reign of\r\nVictoria.” He was, in the words of Sir James Paget, “the greatest\r\nmaster of the art, the greatest practical surgeon of our time.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FERGUSSON was born on March 20th, 1808, at Prestonpans,\r\nEast Lothian, and was educated first at Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire\r\nand afterwards at the High School of Edinburgh. At fifteen he\r\nentered a lawyer’s office, by his own desire, but soon found that\r\nlaw did not suit him, and at seventeen exchanged law for medicine,\r\nwhich profession his father had wished him to adopt. He was\r\nearly attracted by the teaching of Robert Knox, the celebrated\r\nanatomist, who quickly discerned the stuff his pupil was made of.\r\nFergusson would often spend from twelve to sixteen hours a day in\r\nthe dissecting-room. One of his dissections of the nerves of the\r\nface, preserved in the museum of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons,\r\nremains an admirable example of manipulative skill and dexterity, and\r\nthe stand on which it is placed is also a specimen of his work. At\r\ntwenty Knox made him demonstrator to his class, which then numbered\r\nfour hundred. He had previously assisted John Turner, Professor of\r\nSurgery at the College of Surgeons. At the early age of twenty-one\r\nFergusson became Fellow of the College of Surgeons by examination.\r\nKnox then promoted him to a share in his lectures on general anatomy,\r\nand the young lecturer also gave demonstrations on surgical anatomy,\r\nwhich proved highly valuable. He soon began to manifest his skill\r\nin operative surgery, and in 1831 he was elected surgeon to the\r\nEdinburgh Royal Dispensary, and showed his boldness by performing\r\nthe important operation of tying the subclavian artery, which as\r\nyet had only been twice done in Scotland. In 1833 he married Miss\r\nRanken, heiress of the estate of Spittlehaugh in Peeblesshire. This\r\nmarriage, while it placed him beyond pecuniary difficulty, had no\r\neffect in diminishing his industry. In 1839 he became surgeon to the\r\nRoyal Infirmary, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and\r\nalready shared the highest surgical practice with Syme. In fact there\r\nwas hardly room for two such men in Edinburgh. Liston had betaken\r\nhimself to London. In 1840 Fergusson followed his example, accepting\r\nan invitation to King’s College, which was now establishing its\r\nhospital. At a farewell presentation, Lizars said that he had seen no\r\none, not even Liston himself, surpass Fergusson in the most trying\r\nand critical operations. The man of whom this could be said at the\r\nage of thirty-two had every chance of success in London, even though\r\nhe came thither with scarcely any personal friends to back him.\r\nProfessor Partridge, his old friend, gave him a cordial introduction,\r\nand he established himself in Dover Street, Piccadilly, only to find\r\nthat his first year’s private practice did not exceed £100. Yet\r\nit cannot be denied that Fergusson came to London at a fortunate\r\nperiod. Within a few years death or retirement withdrew from practice\r\nmany of the most capable operators, such as Liston, Aston Key, and\r\nAstley Cooper. Thus his success was really rapid, for his third year\r\nbrought him £1000, and in 1847 he removed to a large house in George\r\nStreet, Hanover Square. His style of operating soon attracted general\r\nattention both among students and practitioners, and King’s College\r\noperating theatre became the resort of all the medical students and\r\npractitioners who could cram into it.\r\n\r\nAs an operator Fergusson was most peculiarly skilled, and he appears\r\nto have had a natural manipulative dexterity, which he assiduously\r\ncultivated. Like Sir Charles Bell and other eminent surgeons, he was\r\na splendid fly-fisher; and his manipulation served him in good stead\r\nin acquiring skill on that most difficult of instruments, the violin.\r\nCarpentering and metal-working came easily to him, and gave him\r\ngreat readiness in improvising splints or other apparatus desirable\r\nfor his patients’ special circumstances. Yet having such power and\r\ndexterity, he did not choose to display it on all possible occasions,\r\nbut rather was conspicuous for his frequent abstinence from operative\r\ninterference, counting it a greater glory to save a limb than to\r\ncut one off, and taking endless trouble to preserve a portion when\r\namputation would have been much easier.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rivalry between Fergusson and Syme frequently led to\r\nopen dissensions, yet no man more freely, fully, and repeatedly\r\nacknowledged Syme’s great services than Fergusson. Thus he always\r\nascribed the chief merit of the revival of the “conservative”\r\noperation of excision of the elbow-joint to Syme. Originally\r\nsuggested by Park, and first performed by Moreau, it was not until\r\nthe operation was taken up by Syme that it attracted serious\r\nattention. Fergusson followed in his wake, and extended the same\r\nprinciples till there was scarcely a part which could be conserved\r\nwhich he had not laid hands on with that object. To take an\r\ninstance from parts of small size. A gentleman of active habits, in\r\ncharge of a large establishment, to whom the use of a pen was of\r\nvast importance, had a bad whitlow at the end of his right thumb.\r\nAn abscess was opened in due time, and the bone was found bare.\r\nAmputation was urged, but the patient objected, and on consulting\r\nFergusson, he was advised to wait, and then a few weeks afterwards\r\nthe portion of bone that died was removed through the original\r\nopening for the abscess. Before long, the thumb, apparently entire,\r\nwas as useful as ever. “Opinions may differ,” says Fergusson, “but\r\nfor my own part, I deem it a grand thing when by prescience even the\r\ntip of a thumb can be saved.”\r\n\r\nTo Liston’s boldness and rapidity Fergusson added greater caution\r\nand self-control. In lithotomy both were equally distinguished,\r\nand attained their end with the simplest instruments. An anecdote\r\nrecorded in the _Medical Times and Gazette_ (Feb. 17, 1877)\r\nillustrates this. Some practitioners were discussing the relative\r\nmerits of some leading hospital surgeons, and introduced the subject\r\nof lithotomy. “I saw Mr. —— perform lithotomy to-day in half a\r\nminute.” “Oh,” replied B, “I saw —— once extract the stone in twenty\r\nseconds.” “Have you ever seen Fergusson perform lithotomy?” “No.”\r\n“Well then, go; and, look out sharp, for if you only even wink,\r\nyou’ll miss the operation altogether.”\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Fergusson revived the plan of excising the head of the femur\r\nfor incurable disease of the hip-joint, and it became established\r\nas a valuable operation, in spite of Syme’s violent opposition. In\r\n1847 Mr. Fergusson excised the entire scapula, where the whole\r\narm would otherwise have been sacrificed. In 1850 his attention\r\nbecame concentrated on diseases of the knee-joint, and before\r\nlong he excised the joint for severe disease. Although the result\r\nwas unfavourable, Fergusson, undismayed, repeated the operation\r\nsuccessfully, and in spite of strong criticism and opposition,\r\ncontinued for at least fifteen years, it has become established.\r\nThe strength of the feeling aroused on this subject was so great\r\nthat once when Fergusson was about to excise a knee-joint at King’s\r\nCollege Hospital, a surgeon, once a colleague, publicly protested\r\nagainst the performance of the operation. Fergusson’s earlier\r\ncases were not always well selected for the operation, and he had\r\nmany disheartening failures. But he persevered and improved in his\r\nselection of cases, and achieved what he regarded as the greatest\r\ntriumph of conservative surgery.\r\n\r\nSome of Fergusson’s greatest triumphs were in connection with\r\nhare-lip and cleft-palate. His first formal operation in surgery\r\nwas for hare-lip in 1828. Up to 1864 he had operated on nearly four\r\nhundred cases with only three deaths. The adoption in 1850 of a\r\nspring or truss to push the sides of the lips forwards, invented\r\nby Jem Hainsby (the old dissecting-room attendant at Guy’s), and\r\nthe father of a child-patient, was of great value in preserving the\r\nmobile parts of children from undesirable movements. In regard to\r\ncleft-palate Fergusson’s labours were of even greater value, for\r\nhe discovered by careful dissection the reason why the edges of\r\nthe wound were so often prevented from uniting, and by dividing the\r\nmuscles concerned, in addition to other valuable improvements in\r\npractice, he enabled many patients to gain an excellent undivided\r\npalate. Up to 1864 he had operated on 134 cases, of which 129 were\r\nsuccessful, and only two failed entirely. It is unnecessary to go\r\nthrough the long list of successes won by Fergusson; but it is well\r\nto mention that when he found the existing instruments unsuitable for\r\nhis purpose, he never rested till he had invented better ones. The\r\nbull-dog forceps, the mouth-gag for operations on the palate, various\r\nbent knives, and many other instruments and apparatus bear the stamp\r\nof his inventive skill.\r\n\r\nWith all his operative brilliancy, that did not constitute\r\nFergusson’s chief claim to admiration, nor was it the principal cause\r\nof his success. The perfect planning of the operation beforehand\r\nfrom beginning to end, down to the smallest detail, and being ready\r\nfor every possible emergency with the precise method for meeting it,\r\ndistinguished him most. Consequently he neither hurried, wearied,\r\nnor hesitated when he began. Things were so perfectly planned, his\r\nassistants so well drilled, that not a word needed to be spoken, and\r\nthis produced a curious appearance at times, so that it was often\r\nremarked that he must be on bad terms with his assistants. He left no\r\ndetail unsupervised, and completed the operation entirely himself,\r\neven applying bandages and plasters. His coolness under difficulty\r\nwas probably connected with his forethought; he could often cover\r\nhis own or others’ mistakes in the coolest manner, and this put him\r\nin the best position for remedying them. It was his pride never\r\nto be late. He hated unnecessary waste of time, and once when a\r\nfriend intending to tie a large artery had laid it bare by a fine\r\ndissection, and was showing it with natural gratification, Fergusson\r\ncalled him to the point by remarking, “Jist put a thread round it.”\r\nSo when a large artery had been wounded, and an assistant eagerly\r\ntried to stop the bleeding with his finger, Fergusson said: “Jist\r\nget your finger out of the way, mon, and let’s see what it is,” and\r\nsatisfactorily tied the vessel.[4] He was remarkably neat too in his\r\ncompletion of an operation, and could not bear to leave any traces\r\nbehind, either in hospital or private house.\r\n\r\nIn the subjects which he had thoroughly studied and on which he had\r\npractical experience Fergusson was a master. This is seen in his\r\n“Practical Surgery,” which reached a fifth edition in 1870, and\r\nin his lectures on the Progress of Anatomy and Surgery delivered\r\nat the College of Surgeons in 1864 and 1865. But as a systematic\r\nlecturer he did not achieve great success, nor was he conspicuous as\r\na bedside teacher owing to his reticent manner. It was in operating\r\nthat he shone most, and in his remarks on operations; to see him\r\noperate was for the student or practitioner already instructed what\r\nto observe a lesson full of practical value. On some important\r\nquestions he was imperfectly informed, and this was proved when he\r\nopposed the movement for securing a pure water supply to large towns,\r\nand favoured the anti-vivisectionists in some remarks and evidence\r\nwhich showed considerable ignorance of physiological discovery and\r\nprogress. Again, his attitude towards homœopathic practitioners\r\nlargely compromised his influence at one time.\r\n\r\nFergusson’s social instincts as well as his personal sympathies won\r\nhim favour from all classes, and his male as well as his female\r\npatients felt deeply his kindly attentions, while children simply\r\nworshipped him. His practice was always to treat a hospital patient\r\nwith exactly the same consideration as one in private. Mr. Henry\r\nSmith records the profound impression made upon him as a young\r\nstudent by his remarkable kindness and gentleness towards a little\r\nlame boy. It is not to be wondered at that he inspired his patients\r\nwith the utmost confidence, an art that many equally clever have\r\nlacked. A gentleman who came to London to have an enormous tumour\r\nof the lower jaw removed, saw several eminent surgeons, but chose\r\nFergusson as the operator without hesitation. “Directly he put\r\nhis hands upon me,” said this gentleman, “to examine my jaw, I\r\nfelt that he was the man who should do the operation for me; the\r\ncontrast between his examination and that of others was so great.”\r\nAs Mr. Henry Smith says, “Fergusson not only shone pre-eminently\r\nas an operator, but he possessed a profound knowledge of his art,\r\nand wielded all its resources with consummate skill. His powers of\r\nobservation were remarkable; his memory was most tenacious; his\r\nshrewdness, sound common-sense, tact and knowledge of men, and how\r\nto deal with them, were acknowledged by all; and conspicuous amongst\r\nthem was that facility of resource in all trying emergencies, which,\r\nadded to his extraordinary mechanical skill, made him what he was,\r\nand brought about a success which has seldom been vouchsafed to any\r\nsurgeon.”\r\n\r\nFergusson became M.R.C.S., Eng., in 1840, and Fellow in 1844.\r\nHe was appointed Surgeon to the Prince-Consort in 1849, and\r\nSurgeon-Extraordinary to the Queen in 1855, and Sergeant-Surgeon\r\nin 1867. In 1861 and again in 1868 he was elected to the Council\r\nof the College of Surgeons, notwithstanding the strong opposition\r\nof the existing council on the first occasion. In 1867 he became\r\nan examiner in surgery, and in 1870 President of the College. His\r\nlectures as Professor have already been mentioned. We may add that he\r\nwas President of the Pathological Society in 1859 and ’60, and of the\r\nBritish Medical Association at its brilliant London meeting in 1873.\r\nHis many other appointments and distinctions must be passed over,\r\nwith the exception of the baronetcy, which he received in 1866.\r\n\r\nFergusson never tired of work. His fine energies kept him ever\r\nfresh. He could sing, or dance a Highland reel, with energy long\r\nafter middle age, and when just returned from a prolonged and tiring\r\njourney. He was a munificent patron of literature and the drama;\r\nattended many an author without fee, and would not unfrequently pay\r\nfor their lodging near him in cases where that was desirable. His\r\nspirit of hospitality was lavish, whether in London or at his seat\r\nat Spittlehaugh in Peeblesshire. He was ever ready to show kindly\r\nfeeling towards even those who censured him most severely, and his\r\nforgiving nature was many times most conspicuously evident. Whenever\r\nhe had any consciousness of having done or said anything calculated\r\nto wound another’s feelings, old or young, he never rested until he\r\nhad made reparation in some way. He held a truly modest estimate\r\nof himself, was unspoiled by popularity, and never became at all\r\noverbearing. He was a staunch friend, to old pupils especially,\r\nand a liberal helper of members of the profession generally. Many\r\na surgeon who has risen has owed to him essential help. Indeed, he\r\ndisplayed the best Christian characteristics, and was, in Mr. Henry\r\nSmith’s words, “the true type of a Christian gentleman.” He died in\r\nLondon, after an exhausting illness, of Bright’s disease, on February\r\n10th, 1877, and was buried at West Linton, Peeblesshire, where his\r\nwife had already, in 1860, been buried. A portrait of him by Lehmann\r\nwas presented by subscription to the London College of Surgeons in\r\n1874, and a replica is in the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. His best\r\nmonument is in the life and work of the multitude of his pupils, whom\r\nhe influenced and stimulated as few have ever done.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Surgery, Past, Present and Future, 1877.\r\n\r\n[4] Henry Smith, Biographical Sketch of Sir W. Fergusson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n_SIR JAMES SIMPSON AND ANÆSTHETICS._\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture ages will perceive in the history of medicine and surgery in\r\nthe nineteenth century no more remarkable event than the discovery\r\nand the introduction of means for relieving and temporarily\r\nabolishing pain. And although the name of Simpson is by no means the\r\nonly one honourably associated with this discovery, his achievement\r\nin the introduction of chloroform places him on an enviable pinnacle\r\nof greatness.\r\n\r\nJAMES YOUNG SIMPSON, the seventh son and eighth child of a small\r\nbaker, was born at Bathgate, Linlithgowshire, on the 7th of June\r\n1811. His birth took place when his father’s circumstances were\r\nat the lowest ebb. Several of the family, including his mother,\r\nhad but just recovered from fever. The mother had to rise from her\r\nmaternal pain to take an active part in business, which she did most\r\nenergetically and successfully. Her religious character and her\r\nthrifty habits deeply impressed the little boy, and he pleasingly\r\nrecalled in after years her injunction, when she had just darned a\r\nbig hole in his stocking, “My Jamie, when your mother’s away, you\r\nwill mind that she was a grand darner.” She died when James was but\r\nnine years old, leaving him in the care of his only sister Mary,\r\neleven years older, who proved a tender foster mother. Already as\r\na child James Simpson became known as “the wise wean,” “the young\r\nphilosopher,” and his voice was sweet and silvery. His industry and\r\nretentiveness of memory early gave promise of distinction, which\r\nall the family were persuaded would fall to his lot. And he would\r\nreadily, book in hand, keep the shop for a time, or run with rolls\r\nto the laird’s house. “I remember,” says his brother Alexander,[5]\r\n“finding him sitting in the street on a very dusty day, sobbing\r\nbitterly, the tears running down his cheeks covered with dust. ‘What\r\nails you, Jamie?’ I said, and he answered, sobbing as if his heart\r\nwould break, ‘I’ve broken the pony’s knees.’” It turned out that\r\nAlexander himself had overridden the pony, so that it could not help\r\nstumbling.\r\n\r\nThe father of the family trusted his children in a peculiar way. All\r\nwere regarded as equally concerned in the family prosperity, and the\r\nshop till was unfastened, and free to all; each habitually thought\r\nof the general good first. In this way the household prospered ever\r\nafter James’s birth, and he personally received unremitting attention.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen James Simpson entered\r\nEdinburgh University, “a very very young and very solitary, very poor\r\nand almost friendless student,” as he himself said forty years after.\r\nFor two years he pursued classical and mathematical studies, gaining\r\na small bursary before his second session. One of his earliest\r\npurchases was a little book on “The Economy of Human Life,” for which\r\nhe gave ninepence. An extract from it which he wrote in his cash-book\r\nis significant of his temper of mind: “Let not thy recreations be\r\nexpensive, lest the pain of purchasing them exceed the pleasure thou\r\nhast in their enjoyment.” Though an economical student, however,\r\nhis literary tastes were wide, as he early bought Byron’s Giaour\r\nand Childe Harold, and Paley’s Natural Theology. He lodged with Dr.\r\nMacarthur, a former usher in the Bathgate School, together with John\r\nReid, an old schoolfellow, afterwards Professor of Anatomy at St.\r\nAndrews, in the upper flat of a tall house in Adam Street. Reid’s\r\nenthusiasm for anatomy seem to have first inspired Simpson to choose\r\nmedicine as a profession.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1827 James Simpson entered as a medical student\r\nin the University, and, attending Liston’s class on surgery, soon\r\nbecame conspicuous. He took full notes of lectures, and was freely\r\ncritical of his teachers. He became a dresser under Liston, and\r\nreceived excellent testimonials from him. But he shrank from surgery,\r\nhaving an exquisite tenderness of heart which almost drove him from\r\nthe profession. After witnessing on one occasion a poor woman’s\r\nagony under amputation of the breast, he started off directly to\r\nseek employment as a writer’s (or lawyer’s) clerk. He soon returned,\r\nhowever, deeply imbued with the desire to do something to render\r\noperations less painful. Simpson’s summer vacations were passed at\r\nBathgate, natural history and antiquarian pursuits occupying his\r\nspare time. In January 1830, just before he was going up for his\r\nlicense to practise, his father died after some weeks’ illness,\r\nduring which James constantly watched at his bedside. Such an\r\ninterruption to study at a critical moment might have upset so\r\nsensitive a mind. But Simpson went in for his examination in April,\r\nand became a member of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons before he\r\nwas nineteen years of age. His brother Alexander, who, with the\r\nrest of the family, furnished faithful and persevering help to the\r\nyoung brother of whom so much was expected, gave him a home while\r\nhe looked out for some post to occupy him while waiting for his\r\nEdinburgh degree, which his youth prevented him from taking as yet.\r\nOne of the situations which he sought was that of parish surgeon in\r\na little village named Inverkip, on the Clyde. “When not selected,”\r\nhe writes long after, “I felt perhaps a deeper amount of chagrin\r\nand disappointment than I have ever experienced since that date. If\r\nchosen, I would probably have been working there as a village doctor\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Simpson returned to his university studies, his brother\r\nDavid having commenced business in Stockbridge, Edinburgh, and being\r\nable to accommodate the young doctor. He assisted in maintaining\r\nhimself by becoming assistant to Dr. Gairdner. Thus he was enabled\r\nto complete his university course and take his M.D. degree in 1832,\r\ngiving as his inaugural thesis an essay on “Death from Inflammation.”\r\nThis attracted much attention, especially from Dr. John Thomson,\r\nProfessor of Pathology, who at once requested him to act as his\r\nassistant with a salary of £50, which the young man made sufficient\r\nfor all his necessities. In this capacity he prepared a catalogue\r\nof the museum of the pathological department. His first experience\r\nof obstetric study in attending Professor Hamilton’s lectures had\r\nnot left his mind under a compulsion to pursue the subject deeply,\r\nbut Dr. Thomson saw that his assistant, soft-mannered but full of\r\ndecisive activity, was the very man to succeed in midwifery practice,\r\nand he therefore advised him to devote himself specially to it.\r\nAnother great characteristic was his power of winning the confidence\r\nof others, and especially of getting his patients to tell him what it\r\nwas most important that he should know. But he went immediately to\r\nwork to become learned in his subject, and then to turn over in his\r\nmind everything that he had learnt, until it assumed a new aspect. He\r\nalways sought new and better ways, and if any department of practice\r\nor theory appeared to him defective, he restlessly applied his mind\r\nto invent or imagine some improvement. And he had an absorbing\r\ndesire to gratify his family by achieving success. When his sister\r\nMary told him in 1834 he was injuring his health by overwork, he\r\nreplied, seriously, “Well, I am sure it’s just to please you all.”\r\n\r\nSimpson’s first important paper, on the Diseases of the Placenta,\r\ndelivered before the Royal Medical Society in 1835, at once showed a\r\nmaster hand. It was translated into French, German, and Italian. He\r\nbegan by exhaustively studying the previous history of every subject\r\nhe took up, and then tested others’ opinions and facts by his own\r\nobservation. One of his earliest papers includes nearly one hundred\r\nreferences to previous literature, including many authorities,\r\nshowing an unusual range of reading. If he could not read the\r\nlanguage of an author he got some one who could to do so, and give\r\nhim the material bearing on his point of inquiry. But while no man\r\nregarded more highly than he the patient achievements of the past, no\r\nman sat more loosely to tradition and convention.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Simpson became a member of the Royal Medical and Physical\r\nSocieties of Edinburgh. Of the former he was soon President. A writer\r\nin the _Scotsman_ for May 10, 1870, thus described his appearance\r\nin that capacity. After speaking of his long tangled hair, and very\r\nlarge head, he says: “A poet has since described him as one of\r\n‘leonine aspect.’ Not such do we remember him. A pale, large, rather\r\nflattish face, massive, brent brows, from under which shone eyes\r\nnow piercing as it were to your inmost soul, now melting into almost\r\nfeminine tenderness, and coarsish nose, with dilated nostrils, a\r\nfinely-chiselled mouth, which seemed the most expressive feature of\r\nthe face, and capable of being made at will the exponent of every\r\npassion and emotion. Who could describe that smile? When even the sun\r\nhas tried it he has failed, and yet who can recall those features and\r\nnot realise it as it played round the delicate lines of the upper\r\nlip, where firmness was strangely blended with other and apparently\r\nopposing qualities? Then his peculiar, rounded, soft body and limbs,\r\nas if he had retained the infantile form in adolescence, presented\r\na _tout ensemble_ which even had we never seen it again would have\r\nremained indelibly impressed on our memory.”\r\n\r\nIn 1832 Alexander and Mary Simpson both married. Alexander’s wife,\r\nhowever, became as attached as his sister to James, and there was\r\nno interruption to the family helpfulness. When cholera appeared\r\nin Bathgate, Alexander made a will securing a provision for James\r\nif he died. “I trust,” wrote this true brother, “every one of you\r\nwill look to him. But I dare say every one of you has a pleasure\r\nin doing him good by stealth, as I have had myself.” The brothers\r\nAlexander and John enabled James to visit London and the Continent\r\nin 1835 to see a variety of practice; his travelling companion was\r\nDr. Douglas Maclagan, afterwards Professor of Medical Jurisprudence\r\nat Edinburgh. On his return Simpson gained some practice, but\r\nchiefly among those who could pay him little or nothing. In May\r\n1836 he obtained the situation of house-surgeon to the Lying-in\r\nHospital, which he held for a year. This soon led to an increase of\r\npractice among better-paying patients. He now gave some courses of\r\nlectures on Midwifery in the Extra-Academical School, which were well\r\nreceived, besides being appointed interim lecturer on Pathology, when\r\nhis friend Dr. Thomson had resigned. He gave great labour to the\r\npreparation of his lectures, besides continuing to publish original\r\npapers on Midwifery. At this time he rose repeatedly at three in the\r\nmorning, when he did not sit up all night. But with all his work he\r\nfound time for social enjoyment, for family interests, for messages\r\nto old schoolfellows in humble life.\r\n\r\nNeither now nor at any time did Simpson lose his habit of plain\r\nspeech. He did not always conciliate others by his outspoken\r\nexpressions, and he did not care to wrap up unpleasant truths in\r\nhoneyed words. In 1839 some hasty words which passed between Simpson\r\nand Dr. Lewins of Leith in reference to an anonymous letter written\r\nby the latter, nearly led to a duel; but, fortunately, friends were\r\nable to persuade them that both were to blame, and an amicable\r\nreconciliation was effected. In the same year, that in which also\r\nhe had commenced housekeeping on his own account, Simpson became\r\na candidate for the Chair of Midwifery, vacated by Dr. Hamilton’s\r\nresignation. The contest was a very severe one, Dr. Evory Kennedy of\r\nDublin having strong claims. Simpson strained every nerve to secure\r\ntestimonials and to influence electors, publishing an octavo volume\r\nof testimonials, extending to more than 200 pages. He was finally\r\nelected Professor on the 4th February 1840 by a majority of one\r\nvote only, at the age of twenty-eight, with no advantages of social\r\nposition or long experience to back him. A few weeks previously\r\n(December 26, 1839) he had married his second cousin, Miss Jessie\r\nGrindlay, of Liverpool, to whom he had long been attached.\r\n\r\nBut difficulties were not over when the election had taken place. The\r\npecuniary cost of the canvass was about £500, chiefly in printing\r\nand postage; and Simpson had less than no money; he was considerably\r\nin debt to his relatives. His new colleagues had to a large extent\r\nopposed him, preferring Dr. Kennedy; they continued to oppose him,\r\nnot fancying their association with a small baker’s son. Practice\r\nbegan to flow in, but it necessitated taking a larger house, keeping\r\na carriage, and much greater expenditure; and it was some time before\r\nthe young couple could make both ends meet. Demands from old friends\r\nor from poor people for help, crowded on Simpson faster than fees;\r\nand his kindly heart did more for them than sober judgment would\r\nwarrant. He frequently sat up all night writing for the press. He was\r\nbeset remarkably early by philanthropic projectors, self-interested\r\npromoters, young aspirants to fame, and men anxious to bring forward\r\na pill calculated to make people live to the age of Methusaleh, or\r\ndesirous of the Doctor’s interest to get them permission to fish in\r\none of his patients’ streams. Nervous headaches and acute pains began\r\nto cast their horrible shadows over his life; but work was scarcely\r\never remitted. His lectures were immediately a great success; he\r\nhad the largest class in the University. Additional seats had to be\r\nsupplied, and then there was not room for all to sit. His cares had\r\nmeanwhile been increased by the birth of a daughter, a fortnight\r\nbefore the session began.\r\n\r\nSimpson’s untiring activity could not content itself, however, with\r\nstrictly professional subjects. Before the end of his first session\r\nof professional lectures, he began to work at a memoir which received\r\nthe title of “Antiquarian Notices of Leprosy and Leper-Houses in\r\nScotland and England.” In it he makes nearly five hundred references\r\nto out-of-the-way authorities, and in the appendix is a list and\r\nnotices of one hundred and nineteen leper-houses which he had traced\r\nin Britain. The memoir is a mine of valuable antiquarian information.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1842 his pecuniary position was assured beyond all\r\ndoubt, although his benevolence would have made this difficult\r\nhad not his skill become so famed. His success when little over\r\nthirty years of age was marvellous; the hotels were filled with his\r\npatients, and his practice was said to be worth many thousands of\r\npounds a year to these establishments. His house had to be enlarged\r\nto receive some who insisted on remaining in the closest proximity\r\nto the great doctor. But in the whirl of practice one fault became\r\nprominent. Methodical and exhaustive in his literary researches, and\r\npossessed of a powerful memory, he could not be persuaded to make\r\nsystematic notes of his appointments, and seemed to be incapable of\r\nso planning out his time as to spend it to the greatest advantage\r\nfor his patients. He not unfrequently forgot a definite appointment,\r\nand was sometimes overpersuaded by pushing people or by professional\r\nfriends to attend to cases out of their proper turn. That he ever\r\nconsciously did any one an injustice either for pay or without it\r\nis quite untrue. But he was blamed as if he had. He was indeed only\r\ntoo careless about money, and frequently too regardless of his own\r\ninterest to demand a proper fee. His receipts were stuffed at once\r\ninto his pockets, which were emptied at night, he knowing nothing\r\nof their contents before. Sometimes a fee was received in a letter,\r\nand neither taken out nor acknowledged. Once he received £10 thus,\r\nwhen a much larger fee might have been expected, and several notes\r\nof expostulation followed on his neglect to acknowledge its receipt.\r\nOne stormy night Simpson was much disturbed in sleep by the rattling\r\nof a window. He got up, felt in his pocket for a bit of paper, and\r\nlighted on the £10 note, which was devoted to the tightening of the\r\nwindow-frame. On Mrs. Simpson discovering the nature of the bit of\r\npaper in the morning, he merely replied, “Oh, it’s _that_ £10.”\r\nA sample of ridiculous expostulations is the case where repeated\r\nletters asked Dr. Simpson’s opinion whether three leeches should not\r\nbe applied to a hip-joint, instead of two, which the family medical\r\nman recommended.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of practice and lectures, he found time to write or\r\ndictate many a brief or lengthy article on obstetric practice or\r\ndiseases of women, always practical, always exhausting previous\r\nauthorities. It was in this direction especially that his mind was\r\never at work. Then when he had come to a conclusion, he withheld no\r\nitem of it. “Keen to perceive the truth,” says the _Scotsman_,[6]\r\nhe was equally vigorous in his announcement of it, and cared little\r\nto what cherished opinion his statements might run counter. Hence\r\ncame contests where little quarter was given or received. He was a\r\ndangerous antagonist to meet at a joust, and though he could use the\r\nkeen edge of steel, he oftener despatched his antagonist with a heavy\r\nmace of facts or figures, which those who had neither his industry\r\nnor his powers of memory could neither refute nor set aside. Hence\r\nhe made many enemies, for he had run counter to many prejudices, and\r\nthe old spirit which had opposed his election to the professorial\r\nchair cropped out ever and anon, showing that it was smothered, not\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIt should ever be remembered that Simpson’s greatness was established\r\nbefore he had introduced chloroform, and depended on his unsurpassed\r\nskill in obstetrics and diseases of women, while yet he was a most\r\naccomplished general physician. Already, in January 1847, when he\r\nwas only just beginning to study anæsthetics, he was made one of the\r\nQueen’s Physicians for Scotland. We cannot here attempt a history\r\nof previous efforts to secure immunity or relief from pain, but it\r\nis evident Simpson was in this respect not a man marvellously in\r\nadvance of his age; the subject was in the air; unceasing efforts\r\nat improvement were being made. Before the end of the last century\r\nthe brilliant chemical discoveries of Priestley had led to his\r\nsuggestion that drugs might be administered in definite quantities by\r\ninhalation through the lungs. Oxygen was the first gas inhaled for\r\nmedicinal purposes; and in 1795 Dr. Pearson of Birmingham prescribed\r\nthe inhalation of ether in cases of consumption, being followed ten\r\nyears later by Dr. Warren of Boston, U.S.A. In 1800 Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, when superintending Beddoes’ Pneumatic Institution at Bristol,\r\nfounded principally for the medicinal inhalation of oxygen, began to\r\nstudy the effects of nitrous oxide, which he employed, after he had\r\nbecome familiar with its intoxicating effects, to relieve the pain of\r\na severe inflammation of his own gums. In publishing his account of\r\nits successful inhalation he said, “As nitrous oxide in its extensive\r\noperation seems capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably\r\nbe used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great\r\neffusion of blood takes place.”[7] Thus we must credit Sir Humphry\r\nDavy with the most original observation and experiment on the subject\r\nof anæsthetics: another instance in which the investigator seeking\r\nto advance science has made an observation and suggestion bearing\r\non the welfare of the whole of mankind. His pupil and successor,\r\nFaraday, in 1818 announced that sulphuric ether vapour, when inhaled,\r\nproduced similar effects to nitrous oxide. Here closes the record of\r\nanæsthetics for many years, practically we believe because medicine\r\nand surgery had not yet become sufficiently scientific to discern\r\ntheir value.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Robert Collyer, an American medical student, inhaled ether at\r\na chemical lecture by Professor Turner at University College, London,\r\nbeing himself made insensible, in company with other students; he\r\nnoted that his fellow-students under its influence became insensible\r\nto pain. In December 1839, Collyer, near New Orleans, reduced a\r\ndislocation of the hip for one of his father’s negroes who had fallen\r\ndown in insensibility on inhaling the fumes of rum. The negro showed\r\nno sign of pain. Collyer soon after identified this narcotic state\r\nwith that produced by mesmerism, under which also some operations\r\nwere painlessly performed. Collyer lectured on these subjects in 1840\r\nand subsequent years in Philadelphia, Boston, Liverpool, and other\r\nplaces. He made mesmeric and narcotising experiments, the latter\r\nwith a mixture in which the vapour of alcohol with poppy seeds and\r\ncoriander steeped in it was inhaled, and in 1842 he states that he\r\nadministered his alcoholic mixture to a patient in Philadelphia,\r\nduring tooth-drawing, with a painless result. In 1844 an American\r\nchemical lecturer named Coulton exhibited the properties of nitrous\r\noxide at a lecture given at Hartford, Connecticut, at which Horace\r\nWells, a dentist practising there, was present. Having a tooth\r\nwhich he himself wished to get extracted, Wells invited Coulton to\r\nadminister nitrous oxide to him. This was successfully done, and\r\nduring Wells’ insensibility his tooth was removed by a friend, Dr.\r\nRiggs. Wells on recovering consciousness exclaimed, “A new era in\r\ntooth-pulling!” and at once attempted to introduce the practice at\r\nHartford and at Boston; but not using the gas in purity, and not\r\nbeing sufficiently skilful in its administration, his attempts often\r\nfailed, and at Boston he was hissed, and gave up his efforts in\r\ndespair. Later, when anæsthetics had become firmly established, he\r\nagain sought unsuccessfully to introduce nitrous oxide, and at last\r\nput an end to his life. It is sad to think of this fate for a man\r\nwho, with a little more education and a little more perseverance,\r\nmight have reaped a great harvest of fame.[8]\r\n\r\nWe cannot go into the controversy as to which American has the\r\ngreatest merit in the introduction of sulphuric ether as an\r\nanæsthetic. Suffice it to mention that Charles Jackson, a chemist\r\nof Boston, who had been present at Wells’ demonstration in 1840,\r\nfirst experimented on himself by inhaling pure sulphuric ether, and\r\nhaving produced insensibility, communicated his discovery to W. T. G.\r\nMorton, a dentist who had been present at Wells’ demonstration, and\r\nprevailed on him to employ it. Morton afterwards alleged that this\r\nstep was taken independently on his part.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1846, Morton administered ether to Eben Frost\r\nfor tooth-drawing with complete success, and in October following\r\nit was used in an important operation by Dr. J. C. Warren at the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital. The news arrived in England before\r\nthe end of 1846, and on December 19th, James Robinson, a dentist of\r\nGower Street, London, was the first to operate under ether in this\r\ncountry for the removal of a tooth. On December 21 Robert Liston\r\nemployed it most successfully at University College Hospital in an\r\namputation of the thigh and in the removal of a great toe-nail, one\r\nof the most exquisitely painful operations. Its general adoption\r\nfollowed in the first few months of 1847. Dr. Simpson, as early as\r\nJanuary 9, 1847, after previously inhaling it himself, used it in\r\norder to relieve pain in childbirth, and found that its anæsthetic\r\neffects produced no stoppage or perceptible alteration in the\r\nmuscular contractions of the womb. This and other cases of his were\r\nquickly published, and justify his claim to having introduced ether\r\nin its application to midwifery practice.\r\n\r\nThe inconveniences occasioned by the smell of sulphuric ether, the\r\nconsiderable doses required to be given, and its tendency to irritate\r\nthe bronchial tubes, led Simpson to inquire for and to try other\r\nanalogous liquids. He was recommended, among others by Dr. Gregory,\r\nto try chloroform, discovered by Soubeiran in 1831 and Liebig in\r\n1832, and accurately investigated by Dumas in 1835. He concluded\r\nafter much labour, and the expenditure of some hundreds of pounds,\r\nthat chloroform, without the unpleasant smell of ether, produced\r\nmore rapid effects with a smaller dose, and he very soon began to\r\nuse it in midwifery and to introduce it to his surgical friends for\r\noperations. It was brought before the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical\r\nSociety on the 10th November 1847; and so well-known and favoured did\r\nit become that in a very short time Simpson’s Edinburgh chemists were\r\nmanufacturing 7000 doses a day. Here we might almost stop in this\r\nrecord, but for two things, one the controversies Simpson had as to\r\nthe impropriety and irreligiousness of removing pain, supposed to be\r\none of the Creator’s ordinances which ought not to be mitigated; and\r\nthe other, the deaths that began to occur under the administration of\r\nchloroform. As to the first, a specimen of the objectors is furnished\r\nby a clergyman, who wrote “that chloroform was a decoy of Satan,\r\napparently offering itself to bless woman; but in the end it will\r\nharden society, and rob God of the deep earnest cries which arise\r\nin time of trouble for help.” Even the relief of pain in surgical\r\noperations was held by many to be unwarrantable. But a powerful\r\ncounter-argument was found, in the much greater ease and certainty of\r\nsuccess with which surgeons could now perform their operations when\r\nthe cries and writhings of the patient were removed. The controversy\r\nthat ensued, however, would fill a volume, and Simpson in it proved\r\nhimself, as ever, a hard hitter.\r\n\r\nFor many years scarcely anything but chloroform was used for\r\nproducing anæsthesia; but gradually numerous unexpected deaths under\r\nits administration led many to think that it had too depressing an\r\neffect on the action of the heart, in some cases at least, and led\r\nto the trial of other agents, including bichloride of methylene, the\r\nreintroduction of ether, and nitrous oxide. The two latter are very\r\nlargely used at present, and so also is a mixture composed of one\r\npart by measure of alcohol to two of chloroform and three of ether,\r\nalso known as the A.C.E. mixture, from the first letters of the\r\nthree constituents. This is now considered by many to be safer than\r\nchloroform. What will be the judgment of future experience we can\r\nhave no pretensions to decide.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give in detail the subsequent events of Dr. Simpson’s life.\r\nIt became more busy and active, more benevolent, and more distinctly\r\nreligious as years went on. He refused advantageous offers to settle\r\nin London, and instead patients came from all parts of the world\r\nto consult him in Edinburgh. His hospitality was unbounded. His\r\ndaily breakfasts and luncheons have been graphically described by\r\na well-known poet. “Assembled unceremoniously in a moderate-sized\r\nroom, with little in common save the wish to meet their host, you\r\nfound a company drawn together from every latitude and longitude,\r\nsocial and geographical. Of all this motley party there is probably\r\nhardly one who is not notable, and the grades and classes of eminence\r\nrun through the whole gamut of social distinction from duchesses,\r\npoets, and earls, down to the author of the last successful book on\r\ncookery, the inventor of the oddest new patent, a Greek courtier, a\r\nRussian gentleman, or a German count. At your elbow the last survivor\r\nof some terrible shipwreck is telling his story to the wife of that\r\nnorthern ambassador, who is meeting, with the softest Scandinavian\r\ndialect, the strong maritime Danish of the clever State secretary\r\nopposite. Behind you a knot of American physicians, just arrived, are\r\ndiscussing in a loud voice, a speech in Congress, or agreeing, _sotto\r\nvoce_, on the particular professional topic upon which they have come\r\nto consult the great authority. Turn for a moment from this sculptor,\r\nwho is waiting to ask the opinion of the many-sided professor on the\r\nsketches which he is now showing to that portrait-painter, and to\r\nlearn which of them shall be done in marble for the nobleman whose\r\nattention the doctor has found time to direct to the rising young\r\nartist, and you may catch something of yonder violent discussion\r\nbetween those arrivals from Australia, who have come from the land of\r\ngold in search of what gold cannot buy.”\r\n\r\nBut it is by no means only in connection with ether and chloroform\r\nthat Simpson introduced a new practice. Besides numberless\r\nsuggestions and novel ideas in midwifery, he brought forward (in\r\n1859, after some years of study) a totally new method of closing\r\narteries after operations and in substitution for ligatures, so often\r\nthe cause of inflammation. Long before John Hunter had pointed out\r\nthat needles and pins when passed into and embedded in the living\r\nbody seldom or never produced any inflammatory action. Simpson was\r\nstruck with the idea that slender sharp-pointed needles or pins of\r\nnon-oxidisable iron, somewhat like hare-lip needles, might be used to\r\nclose together the walls or flaps of wounds, at the same time keeping\r\nthe blood-vessels closed. These pins could be withdrawn very early,\r\nand would greatly favour healing at the earliest possible moment. The\r\nnew method, called acupressure, of course met with much opposition,\r\nand Simpson was severely censured for meddling in a preserve strictly\r\nlimited to the surgeon. But the help of the Aberdeen surgeons, Keith\r\nand Pirrie, was of great service in promoting the fair trial of the\r\npractice. His attack on the prevailing hospital system in 1869 was\r\none of his later crusades, and he certainly accumulated a great store\r\nof facts showing the unhealthiness of the existing conditions of\r\naggregation in crowded hospitals. His advocacy of a separate system\r\nin hospital construction, and of limiting the number of patients\r\nclose together, of course drew on him further fierce opposition.\r\nWe cannot here refer to his strong exposure of the fallacies of\r\nhomœopathy, his vigorous actions in connection with the University\r\nof Edinburgh, or the numerous antiquarian papers which his prolific\r\npen gave forth. Every year had crowded into it three times as much\r\nresearch as a very industrious man could manage, ten times as much\r\ncontroversy, and twice as much practice. Honours came thick upon him.\r\nIn 1856 he was greatly gratified by the French Academy’s award of the\r\nMonthyon Prize of 2000 francs for “most important benefits done to\r\nhumanity.” At the beginning of 1866 he was created a baronet. In 1869\r\nthe freedom of Edinburgh was presented to him.\r\n\r\nHeavy affliction came now and again to embitter his life. Several\r\nchildren were taken from him in the prime of their life, including\r\nhis eldest son, who showed great promise of a brilliant medical\r\nfuture, but was cut off within a fortnight after his father was\r\nmade a baronet. In later life he became an ardent church worker,\r\nhaving joined the Free Church of Scotland when the Disruption\r\ntook place. 1870 found the vital machine much out of order. Heart\r\npain—_angina pectoris_—so often the scourge of medical men, came more\r\nfrequently with its terrible strain. But he never relaxed his work\r\nin the intervals, until absolutely compelled. In one of his later\r\nconversations he said, “How old am I? Fifty-nine. Well, I have done\r\nsome work. _I wish I had been busier._” One of his expressions showed\r\nhis distaste for theology. “I like the plain simple Gospel truth,\r\nand don’t care to go into questions beyond that.” During almost his\r\nlast night he was inexpressibly comforted by having with him his\r\nbrother Alexander, who had watched over him with such tenderness\r\nfrom childhood. He sat on the pillow with Sir James’s head on his\r\nknee, and the sufferer again and again slowly uttered the words, “Oh,\r\nSandy, Sandy!” He died on May 6, 1870. He would have been buried\r\nin Westminster Abbey but for his own express wish to be buried in\r\nWarriston Cemetery, Edinburgh. His funeral was such as Edinburgh\r\nhad, it is said, never witnessed before, business being generally\r\nsuspended. His widow survived him but a few weeks, dying on the 17th\r\nJune following. His eldest surviving son, Walter Grindlay, succeeded\r\nhim in the baronetcy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Memoir of Sir James Y. Simpson, by J. Duns.

Subsequently he spent\r\na year with a parish doctor in Leeds, attending the Leeds Infirmary,\r\nand Hey’s and Teale’s lectures. The session 1837-8 was passed in\r\nDublin, and there Graves and Stokes largely influenced the young\r\nsurgeon. Continuing his course of culture in varied fields, he went\r\nto St. Thomas’s, London, and was a zealous pupil of J. H. Green,\r\nTravers, and Tyrrell. Here he obtained a prize for the best reports\r\nof _post mortem_ examinations. Becoming a member of the College of\r\nSurgeons in 1841, he entered the navy as assistant-surgeon, and spent\r\nsix years in the Naval Hospital at Malta.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Sir Spencer Wells settled in practice in London, and in 1854\r\nbecame attached to the Samaritan Hospital, then a dispensary for the\r\ndiseases of women. At this time Sir Spencer states he knew less of\r\nthis branch of the profession than of any other. In his younger days\r\nhe had attended an unusual number of midwifery cases, but latterly\r\nhis practice had been almost exclusively surgical, with a strong\r\ntendency towards ophthalmic surgery. It was at this time that he\r\nfirst became interested in the subject that has made his name so\r\nwidely known.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the ovaries of women have been subject to\r\ndiseased growths and fluid accumulations, for which there was\r\nscarcely a remedy, except when fluid could be drawn off through one\r\nor more punctures, and fatal results were the almost inevitable\r\nsequel of these diseases. Towards the end of the seventeenth and\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth centuries, several medical men proposed\r\nto remove the diseased organ by an incision in the front wall\r\nof the abdomen. William Hunter in 1762 put forward a method by\r\nwhich this operation, otherwise full of danger, might be rendered\r\nfeasible; and John Hunter, lecturing in 1785, favoured the idea\r\nof removal, considering that the opening would not necessarily\r\nconstitute a highly dangerous wound. In 1798 Chambon, in a book on\r\ndiseases of women, published at Paris, strongly argued in favour\r\nof the operation. Although it does not appear that he ever himself\r\nperformed it, he says, “I am convinced that a time will come when\r\nthis operation will be considered practicable in more cases than I\r\nhave enumerated, and that the objections against its performance will\r\ncease.” John Bell also has a share of credit in this matter, for in\r\nhis lectures on surgery at Edinburgh in 1794 he dwelt with much force\r\non the practicability of removing ovarian tumours by operation. It\r\nwas reserved, however, for a pupil of his, Ephraim M’Dowell, from\r\nVirginia, to perform the first modern operation of ovariotomy for\r\ndisease. He settled in practice in Kentucky in 1795, and in 1809\r\ncarried into effect this novel operation upon a middle-aged woman,\r\nwho survived to complete her seventy-eighth year in 1841. Thus an\r\nAmerican had the glory of first boldly starting in the new path.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to give the new operation a start in England. “It\r\nmust be remembered,” says Sir Spencer Wells, “that, at that time of\r\nday, the mortality from all operations was much greater than it is\r\nnow; that the sick and diseased were more passively quiescent under\r\ntheir maladies and less tolerant of any surgical suggestions, just\r\nas we ourselves find to be the case among the unroused population\r\nof an outlying agricultural district; that they were not buoyed\r\nup, as modern women are, by the histories and promises of painless\r\nextirpations under chloroform or methylene; and that, without any\r\nmawkish sentimentalism, surgeons themselves had to encounter the\r\n_peine forte et dure_ of their suppressed sympathy, and nerve\r\nthemselves up to the infliction of the most deliberate and tedious\r\neviscerative vivisection. The disease was looked upon as a mystery,\r\nand its ending in death as a matter of course; and, instead of being\r\naccompanied, as we now see it, by fretful resistance and chafings to\r\nescape, it only led to stolid endurance or religious submission; and\r\non the part of the profession, to pity and endeavours to alleviate\r\nthe inevitable misery. But M’Dowell was a free man, in a new country,\r\nclear from the conventional trammels of old-world practice, found\r\nhis patients in the most favourable conditions of animal life, seems\r\nto have had one of those incomprehensible runs of luck upon which\r\na man’s fate and reputation so often turn if he has the sagacity\r\nand energy to put such fortunate accidents to good account, and was\r\nhappy, as those usually are who can afford or constrain themselves\r\nto wait, in finding suitable time, place, persons, and opportunity\r\nfor working into fact the notions of his tutor, Bell. He lost only\r\nthe last of his first five cases of ovariotomy, and thus, as it\r\nwere, established at the outset what until recently was complacently\r\nregarded as a satisfactory standard of mortality for so serious an\r\noperation.”[9]\r\n\r\nAs a surgeon M’Dowell was “cautious, calm, and firm, paying great\r\nattention to the details of his operations and treatment, and\r\nselecting and drilling his assistants with great care.” In 1879 a\r\ngranite obelisk was raised to his memory in the cemetery where he\r\nwas buried, near his home, in commemoration of his courageous and\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\nLong after M’Dowell’s operations became known, a case was discovered\r\nas far back as August 1701, in which Robert Houstoun, a Glasgow\r\nsurgeon, operated on a woman for a large tumour in a fashion somewhat\r\nanticipatory of modern ovariotomy. She recovered, and lived sixteen\r\nyears afterwards. So often are anticipations of great improvements\r\nto be found, that it appears that the merit, like the difficulty of\r\nactually making a thing practicable and practised, is as great as, or\r\ngreater than, that of discovery.\r\n\r\nSeveral American surgeons followed M’Dowell, but the operation did\r\nnot come rapidly into vogue, partly because anæsthetics had not yet\r\nbeen introduced. Lizars of Edinburgh had one successful and one\r\nunsuccessful case in 1825. Dr. Granville attempted it in London in\r\n1827, but the operation was abandoned on account of the difficulties\r\nmet with: fortunately the patient recovered. In 1836 Dr. Jeaffreson\r\nof Framlingham first operated successfully by means of the short\r\nincision recommended by William Hunter; the patient recovered and\r\nbore a family afterwards. In the same year several other provincial\r\nsurgeons were equally successful. In 1840 Mr. Benjamin Phillips\r\noperated unsuccessfully at the Marylebone Infirmary. In 1842 Dr.\r\nCharles Clay of Manchester commenced a long series of operations,\r\noperating four times in the year, three times successfully. The\r\nfirst successful case in London was by Mr. Walne in November 1842.\r\nFrom this time operations were not infrequent. In September 1846 Mr.\r\nCæsar Hawkins proved for the first time that success was possible\r\nin a London hospital; his precautions and his directions were most\r\nexcellent. In June 1848 Dr. Charles Clay published a series of 32\r\ncases with only 10 deaths, and he continued to operate for many years\r\nuntil he had performed 395 operations with only 101 deaths, slightly\r\nabove 25 per cent. He used long ligatures. In 1850 Mr. Duffin, in\r\nLondon, employed an important improvement in procedure.\r\n\r\nSir Spencer Wells’s medical education and study in all these years\r\nhad not led to his paying any attention to the subject. It was\r\nevidently outside the prevailing ideas of most of the medical\r\nschools. His opinion in 1848 was certainly against the justifiability\r\nof the operation. In 1853 or 1854 he became acquainted with Mr. Baker\r\nBrown, and in the latter year assisted him at the Middlesex Hospital\r\nin his eighth case of ovariotomy. This was the first time he had seen\r\nthe operation attempted, but the patient died. Several unsuccessful\r\ncases led Brown to give up his attempts entirely from March 1856 to\r\nOctober 1858.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crimean War broke out, Sir Spencer Wells betook himself\r\nto the army in the East. There he learnt much of the freedom with\r\nwhich the abdomen might be injured and yet recovery take place if\r\nthe constitution was good and other things were favourable. He saw\r\nfrightful cases of laceration by fragments of shell recover after\r\ncareful cleansing and accurate closure of the wounds. He returned to\r\nLondon much less afraid than before of abdominal wounds. Renewing\r\nhis work at the Samaritan Hospital, he at first saw very little of\r\novarian disease, and it was not till December 1857 that he made his\r\nfirst attempt to perform ovariotomy, which, however, on Baker Brown’s\r\nadvice, he did not carry to completion. His second attempt was\r\ncompleted, with Brown’s assistance; but the latter did not recommence\r\nto operate himself until after an interval of more than two years and\r\na half.\r\n\r\nSir Spencer Wells has given a graphic account of his early\r\nexperiences.[10] “It would be difficult to imagine,” he says, “a\r\nposition more disheartening than that in which I was placed when\r\nmaking my first trials of ovariotomy. The first attempt, as I have\r\nsaid, was a complete failure, and strengthened not only in the minds\r\nof others, but in my own mind, the fear that I might be entering\r\nupon a path which would lead rather to an unenviable notoriety than\r\nto a sound professional reputation. And if I had not seen increasing\r\nnumbers of poor women hopelessly suffering, almost longing for death,\r\nanxious for relief at any risk, I should probably have acquiesced in\r\nthe general conviction—have been content with palliative tapping,\r\nor making some further trials of incision and drainage, or of\r\niodine-injection, or of pressure, rather than have hazarded anything\r\nmore in the way of ovariotomy. It may be forgotten now, but it is\r\ntrue, that at that time everything was against the venture. The\r\nmedical press had denounced the operation, both in principle and\r\npractice, in the strongest terms. At the medical societies the\r\nspeakers of the highest authority had condemned it most emphatically.\r\nThe example of the men who had practised it was not followed; some of\r\nthem had given it up. Only once had a successful result been obtained\r\nin any of our large metropolitan hospitals, that by Cæsar Hawkins, at\r\nSt. George’s Hospital, in 1846, and he never undertook it a second\r\ntime. Every other attempt—at Guy’s Hospital by Morgan, Key, and\r\nBransby Cooper, at St. Thomas’s by Solly—had ended in death.” In 1858\r\nthree cases were undertaken, and all with success, which did much to\r\nconfirm Mr. Wells in his new practice. The fourth he lost, and to\r\nexplain the cause he made some experiments upon animals, which led to\r\nimportant improvements in methods, yet during 1859 five out of eleven\r\noperations had fatal results.\r\n\r\nThe translation in 1860, by Mr. John Clay of Birmingham, of Kiwisch’s\r\n“Diseases of the Ovaries,” with its valuable tables showing the\r\nresults of all recorded cases, was of great importance to the\r\nprogress of ovariotomy. Since then vast improvements have been\r\nintroduced, the mistakes of earlier operators corrected, bichloride\r\nof methylene has been used with gratifying results instead of\r\nchloroform, precautions have been taken to prevent the access of\r\nany taint of infectious disease, every medical man present at the\r\noperation has been put under strict inquiry as to his not having\r\nrecently been in a dissecting or _post mortem_ room, and the utmost\r\npossible purification of house, room, bedding, clothing, and\r\ninstruments has been practised. Indeed some precautions have been so\r\nstringently insisted on as to give considerable offence at times. The\r\nold vegetable material for ligatures and sutures, coarse whipcord\r\nor twine, has been given up, and after many trials of metallic\r\nwires pure silk has been settled upon as the most trustworthy.\r\nIn fact it is entirely absorbed without needing to be pulled out\r\nagain. The multitude of intricate details involved precludes our\r\ngiving an account of the stages by which the present perfection has\r\nbeen reached. In 1864 Mr. Wells, in pursuance of a pledge he had\r\ngiven to record and publish his entire experience, favourable and\r\nunfavourable, published a full account of his first 114 cases. Since\r\nthen two extended records, one in 1872 giving an account of 500\r\ncases, and a second in 1882 with 1071 cases, have been published. The\r\nmost remarkable thing in the history is the gradual diminution in\r\nmortality. In the first hundred cases the deaths were thirty-four;\r\nin the last they diminished to eleven; in the seventy-one cases\r\nfollowing the first thousand only four died, while sixty-seven\r\nrecovered. This is notwithstanding the fact that Sir Spencer Wells\r\nis often called upon to treat patients rejected by other surgeons as\r\nunfavourable cases. A recent record by Thomas Keith, an Aberdeen\r\nsurgeon, in which a mortality of only three and a half per cent.\r\nhas occurred, even outdoes this astonishing result. It is needless\r\nto relate how the operation has been adopted by most Continental\r\nsurgeons of mark, and with excellent results.\r\n\r\nWe may note that already in 1864 Mr. Wells had treated of hospital\r\natmosphere, organic germs as causes of excessive mortality, and\r\ncommented on the researches of Polli with sulphur and the sulphites,\r\nbefore as yet the antiseptic treatment had come prominently forward.\r\nWhen Mr. Lister’s system became established, Mr. Wells gladly adopted\r\nall its essentials in his operations—the spray, carbolised sponges,\r\ninstruments, &c. He is convinced that by these precautions those\r\npatients who have recovered have suffered much less from fever, while\r\nconvalescence has been more rapid than it used to be. In fact, the\r\ngeneral result of the ovariotomy of the past twenty-five years is\r\n“thousands of perishing women have been rescued from death; many more\r\nthousands of years of human life, health, enjoyment, and usefulness\r\nhave been given to the race, and to all future victims of a malady\r\nbefore inevitable in its fatality, consolation, hope, and almost\r\ncertainty of cure.”\r\n\r\nThe good influence of this success has, Sir James Paget says,\r\nextended to every department of operative surgery, and will always\r\ncontinue to be felt. It has led to an extension of the whole domain\r\nof peritoneal surgery, leading surgeons to attempt and persevere\r\nuntil successful in many operations formerly considered quite out of\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nSir Spencer Wells is by no means content with promoting the progress\r\nof operative surgery; he looks forward to prevention with the\r\ngreatest hope, and advocates measures calculated to promote accurate\r\nresearch in pathology. He is a strong supporter of any possible\r\naction by the College of Surgeons in this direction. He says: “While\r\nwe modern surgeons congratulate our science on its liberation from\r\nthe trammels of tradition; upon its working in an atmosphere cleared\r\nof the mist of superstition; upon the changing of its mode of action\r\nfrom a blind grappling with the phantom entities of a disease to a\r\nstudy and manipulation of overnourished or degenerating tissues; upon\r\nits having laws which can be understood and rules of practice which\r\ncan be followed, we ought not to overlook one fact, which perhaps\r\nis more evident to outsiders than to ourselves, standing as we do\r\nin the dust and turmoil of the arena of our work. I mean that that\r\nwork, good and useful as it is, has too much the character of what is\r\ntechnically called ‘salvaging’—is too much in correlation with what\r\nis done by the lifeboat service.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wells had long been a member of the Council of the College of\r\nSurgeons when in 1882-3 he became its President. In 1882 he was\r\ncreated a baronet. He has by no means limited himself to questions\r\nof operative surgery. His public efforts have been frequently\r\ndirected towards important subjects of state and municipal polity,\r\nsanitary matters, the abatement of the smoke nuisance, the securing\r\nof the health of passengers on board ship, the hygienic condition of\r\nhospitals, and perhaps most important of all, the mode of disposal of\r\nthe dead. His views on the evils of the present system are well set\r\nforth in a letter he addressed to the _Times_ on March 3, 1885, from\r\nwhich we make the following extract:—\r\n\r\n“In this metropolitan district in the twenty-five years 1859-1883,\r\nthe deaths registered number 1,896,314. Of course, the dead have\r\nbeen buried, and with scarcely an exception, in and around London.\r\nGrant that in ten years a body may become harmless—although I do not\r\nat all believe that it does so within twenty years in our soil and\r\nclimate—can any imagination conceive the enormous mass of decaying\r\nanimal matter by which we are surrounded? Could any one be surprised\r\nat the outbreak of some devastating pestilence a hundredfold more\r\ndestructive than the plague or black death of the Middle Ages? And\r\nought not every sanitary reformer to aid the revival of the ancient\r\npractice which would convert the existing cemeteries, so rapidly\r\nbecoming sources of danger to the public health, into permanently\r\nbeautiful gardens, receptacles for vases and cinerary urns, which\r\nwould encourage sculpture, mural decoration, and coloured glass-work;\r\nwhile in our country churches the ashes of the people might again\r\nrepose in death near the scene of their work in life perfectly\r\nharmless, instead of polluting the earth of the church-yard and the\r\nwater drunk by the surviving people, or being carried far from their\r\nhomes and places of worship to some distant cemetery, which before\r\nlong must become overcrowded and pestilential. Public sentiment may\r\nfor a time revolt at an innovation, but a very little reflection will\r\nbring most people to agree with part of the Bishop of Manchester’s\r\naddress on consecrating a new cemetery. He said:—\r\n\r\n“‘Here is another hundred acres of land withdrawn from the\r\nfood-producing area of the country for ever.... In the same sense in\r\nwhich the “Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,” I\r\nhold that the earth was made, not for the dead, but for the living.\r\nNo intelligent faith can suppose that any Christian doctrine is\r\naffected by the manner in which, or the time in which, this mortal\r\nbody of ours crumbles into dust.’”\r\n\r\nSir Spencer Wells in his frequent communications on the subject lays\r\nmuch stress on the fact that such undoubted proofs of natural death\r\nare required by the Cremation Society before cremating a body that no\r\nmurderer or poisoner would think of getting the forms filled up. At\r\nthe Milan Crematorium a death from poison was actually discovered in\r\nthis way, when natural death only was believed to have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Ovarian and Uterine Tumours: 1882.\r\n\r\n[10] Address to Midland Medical Society, Birmingham, November 5,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_SIR WILLIAM JENNER, BUDD, MURCHISON, AND TYPHOID FEVER._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no department of medical knowledge has recent progress been more\r\nmarked than in the discrimination and the tracing of the natural\r\nhistory of the diseases known as zymotic: and no man takes higher\r\nrank in this department of investigation than Sir WILLIAM JENNER.\r\nHe was born at Chatham, January 30, 1815, being the son of Mr. John\r\nJenner, and educated at University College, London. After qualifying\r\nas a general practitioner, he commenced practice and obtained the\r\nappointment of Surgeon-Accoucheur to the Royal Maternity Charity.\r\nBefore long he graduated M.D. at London University (1844), and\r\nretired from general practice. His studies in pathology became more\r\nand more extensive, and his merits were so far recognised that in\r\n1849 he was elected Professor of Pathological Anatomy to University\r\nCollege, and Assistant-Physician to University College Hospital.\r\n\r\nFor some years Dr. Jenner had been assiduously studying in the London\r\nFever Hospital, seeking to make a straight path through the many\r\nknotty questions then, in debate. In April 1849 he commenced the\r\npublication, in the _Monthly Journal of Medical Science_, of his\r\nclassic paper on “Typhoid and Typhus Fevers, an attempt to determine\r\nthe question of their identity or non-identity, by an analysis of\r\nthe symptoms, and of the appearances found after death in sixty-six\r\nfatal cases of continued fever, observed at the London Fever Hospital\r\nfrom January 1847 to February 1849.” In this he states that “with\r\nfew exceptions, British physicians have laboured to prove that\r\ntyphoid and typhus fevers are identical. The results obtained by this\r\nanalysis justify the assertion that they are essentially distinct\r\ndiseases.... For two years, in distinguishing the two diseases by\r\nthe eruption alone not a single error has been made, so far as could\r\nbe proved by examination after death of the fatal cases, or by the\r\nprogress of the non-fatal cases after their diagnosis was recorded.”\r\n\r\nThe history of previous investigations and the fluctuations of\r\nopinion are excellently given by Dr. Murchison in his great work on\r\nthe “Continued Fevers of Great Britain,” 1862, 2d ed. 1873. Dr. H. C.\r\nLombard of Geneva appears to have been the first to state positively\r\n(in 1836) that “there were two distinct and separate fevers in Great\r\nBritain; one of them identical with the contagious typhus, the other\r\na sporadic disease, identical with the typhoid fever of the French.”\r\nHe failed, however, to point out the distinctive eruptions and other\r\ncharacteristics of the two fevers. At the same period Drs. Gerhard\r\nand Pennock in Philadelphia arrived at more definite conclusions, and\r\ndistinguished the typhus of Philadelphia as being the same as British\r\ntyphus, the old gaol, camp, and ship fever, so direfully contagious\r\nand fatal; while certain intestinal phenomena were invariably\r\nfound in the other or typhoid fever, which was rarely contagious.\r\nThe characteristic eruptions and many of the symptoms were also\r\naccurately discriminated. These observers were followed by others who\r\nwith more or less success and emphasis insisted on the same views.\r\nAmong these were Drs. H. C. Barlow and A. P. Stewart, both of whom\r\nread important papers on the subject before the Parisian Medical\r\nSociety in 1840. In 1841 the celebrated Louis in the second edition\r\nof his great work on typhoid fever accepted the view that the English\r\ntyphus was very distinct from the fever which he had so largely\r\nelucidated. Nevertheless many physicians of authority strongly\r\nmaintained their identity, and the majority of the medical schools\r\ntaught this doctrine, which could not fail to retard progress. It is\r\nobvious how much uncertain and injurious treatment must have existed\r\nfor a long period owing to the confusion of these two diseases.\r\n\r\nIn his series of papers published in 1849 and 1850 Dr. Jenner\r\nconfirmed and extended the distinctions between the symptoms of the\r\ntwo fevers, comparing the selected cases most minutely as regarded\r\nprevious health, complexion, sex, age, mode of attack, duration,\r\neruption, expression during disease, manner, hue of face, presence\r\nof headache, delirium, loss of muscular power, sensation, appearance\r\nof the tongue, suffering of pain, appetite, thirst, pulse, cough,\r\nand lung symptoms, and many other particulars, and detailed most\r\ncarefully the _post mortem_ appearances of the diseased action in\r\nevery organ.\r\n\r\nAs regards the age of patients, he showed by calculation that typhoid\r\nusually attacked much younger patients than typhus, the average\r\nage of his cases of the one being 22 years, of the other 42 years.\r\nIn typhus, death took place on the average on the fourteenth day,\r\nwhile in typhoid the average was the thirty-second day of residence\r\nin the hospital. The rose rash of typhoid, disappearing completely\r\non pressure, resuming the original appearance on the withdrawal of\r\npressure, was clearly discriminated from the mulberry rash of typhus.\r\nHis _post mortem_ observations may be considered to have given the\r\ndeath-blow to the idea that typhoid was merely typhus fever with\r\nabdominal complications. In closing the series of papers (April\r\n1850) Dr. Jenner remarked, as to the suggestion that he had drawn\r\ngeneral conclusions from a too limited number of facts, “A few facts,\r\nimpartially observed, minutely recorded, and carefully analysed,\r\nare, I believe, more likely to give correct results than a multitude\r\nof general observations; and moreover, I believe most men would be\r\nastonished if they had in numbers all the cases of any given disease\r\nthey had ever seen, yet concerning which they have generalised. The\r\nmethod I have adopted—however prolix it may be, however difficult\r\nto conform to, however tedious the details into which it leads—has\r\nthis advantage, that if the observer be honest, and capable of noting\r\nwhat is before him, thinking men may judge of the value of his facts,\r\nthe force of his reasoning, and the correctness of his conclusion;\r\nwhereas general observations, while they are totally incapable of\r\nproving anything, are exposed to all the fallacies of definite\r\nstatements, because the one, like the other, rests ultimately on the\r\naccuracy of the facts observed. If the observations on which any\r\nreasoning is founded be erroneous, no cloaking of those observations\r\nin general terms can render the conclusions correct. It has been\r\nobjected to definite numerical statements that they mislead the\r\nreader by an _appearance_ of accuracy in cases where there has been\r\ngreat inaccuracy in observation. This objection appears to me to\r\nlie against the condition of the reader’s mind, and not against the\r\nmethod.... The more complicated the problem to be solved, the more\r\ncareful ought we to be that _every_ step in its solution is made\r\ncorrectly. How complex questions, such as arise in medicine, are to\r\nbe determined mentally—_i.e._, without the aid of figures—by ordinary\r\nmen, I am at a loss to conceive. Yet physicians think to solve, by\r\nmental reveries, problems in comparison with which the most difficult\r\nthat the most renowned calculators ever answered were child’s play;\r\nand not only do they think to solve these problems, but to carry in\r\ntheir minds for years the complicated materials by which they are to\r\nbe solved.”\r\n\r\nAnother important branch of Dr. Jenner’s inquiry dealt with the\r\nquestion as to whether the specific cause of these diseases is\r\ndistinct or the same, the latter being then the preponderant\r\nopinion. In a paper on this subject communicated to the Royal\r\nMedical and Chirurgical Society, on December 11, 1849, he showed\r\nthat in 1847-8-9, on analysing all the cases in which two or more\r\nfever patients came from the same house, scarcely a single instance\r\noccurred where typhus and typhoid came at the same period from the\r\nsame house. In nearly all cases the two diseases came from quite\r\ndistinct localities. No transitional cases occurred between the two;\r\nthe rash of typhoid did not graduate into that of typhus. It was\r\nseveral times observed that when a succession of cases came from the\r\nsame locality, or arose apparently from the same cause, they agreed\r\nremarkably in symptoms or other features. Thus Dr. Jenner considered\r\nhe had definitely proved that typhus and typhoid proceeded from\r\nperfectly distinct causes, a result which recent medical science\r\naccepts without reserve.\r\n\r\nAlthough the contributions of this distinguished physician have been\r\nof such high worth, and his subsequent success so great in practice,\r\nhe is far from being wedded to the view that any great step forward\r\nin medicine has been the direct result of the labours of a single\r\nman. Long after his early papers, in addressing the British Medical\r\nAssociation in 1869, Sir William Jenner said: “The silent workers\r\nrender most efficient aid, the results of their unspoken experience\r\nconfirming or refuting the published assertions of the few.” He\r\nbelieves that no science has advanced more during the present epoch\r\nthan medicine, and that it has progressed equally as a practical art.\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner’s appointments include, among a crowd of others, those\r\nof Physician to University College Hospital (1854), Professor\r\nof Clinical Medicine (1857) and of the Principles and Practice\r\nof Medicine (1862), Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children\r\n(1852), Assistant-Physician to the Fever Hospital (1853). In 1864\r\nhe was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and became President\r\nof the College of Physicians in 1881. In 1861 he was appointed\r\nPhysician-Extraordinary to the Queen, and attended the Prince-Consort\r\nin his last illness. In 1862 he became Physician-in-Ordinary to the\r\nQueen, and has frequently attended her Majesty. He was made a baronet\r\nin 1868, and further advanced to the dignity of a K.C.B. in 1872 for\r\nhis services during the Prince of Wales’s illness from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nSir William Jenner has published eminently valuable clinical\r\nsystematic lectures in the medical journals, and a small treatise on\r\nDiphtheria (1861). His addresses to the British Medical Association\r\n(1869), and to the Epidemiological Society (1866), published\r\ntogether, are most excellent as summaries of the modern progress of\r\nmedicine, and as pointing out the directions in which future advances\r\nmay be made. He insists most strongly on and desires most ardently\r\nthe prevention of disease, and shows a striking readiness to welcome\r\nnew discoveries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew more striking individualities have been seen among the provincial\r\nphysicians of our day than that of WILLIAM BUDD, of Clifton. He\r\nwas one of the younger sons of Mr. Samuel Budd, a successful\r\nmedical practitioner at North Tawton in Devonshire, who having\r\nvery considerable culture and foresightedness, brought up most of\r\nhis large family at home, and was ultimately enabled to introduce\r\nseven out of nine sons to the medical profession, sending seven to\r\nCambridge, where five became wranglers. One of the elder brothers,\r\nGeorge Budd, was long Professor of Medicine at King’s College,\r\nLondon, the author of an excellent treatise on Diseases of the\r\nLiver, and a most successful London physician. William Budd was\r\nborn in September 1811; his medical studies were pursued in London,\r\nEdinburgh, and Paris, in the latter of which cities he spent four\r\nyears. Graduating M.D. in 1838 at Edinburgh, he for some time\r\nafterwards assisted his father in his practice at North Tawton, and\r\nhere in 1839 commenced his lifelong studies on typhoid fever, having\r\nhimself been already a sufferer by that malady. He had peculiar\r\nadvantages in this study, for he was personally acquainted with\r\nevery inhabitant of the village, and being as medical practitioner in\r\nalmost exclusive possession of the field, nearly every one who fell\r\nill, not only in the village itself, but over a large area around\r\nit, came immediately under his care. At the date of the outbreak\r\nthe population of eleven or twelve hundred had been extremely\r\nexempt from fevers. Yet there was no sewerage system; cesspools\r\nprevailed; pig styes were close to the houses; and all conditions\r\nof decomposition were to be found;—but fever did not arise till it\r\nhad been specifically introduced. In July 1839 the first case of\r\ntyphoid occurred, and before the beginning of November over eighty\r\nof the inhabitants had suffered from it. Young Budd kept an accurate\r\nand detailed record of every essential fact, and spared no pains in\r\ntracing out all extraneous facts that he required to know. He was\r\nextremely struck by the fact that three persons left North Tawton\r\nafter they had been infected, and all three communicated the disease\r\nto one or more of the persons by whom they were surrounded. The\r\nnarrative which Dr. Budd gave many years afterwards, in his “Typhoid\r\nFever: its Nature, Mode of Spreading, and Prevention” (1873), is like\r\na romance for its interesting detail, though melancholy with its\r\ntale of pain and death. He shows that there is evidently a specific\r\npoison which breeds and multiplies in the living human body, and\r\nthat this process of breeding and multiplying constitutes the fever\r\nitself. This essentially is its contagiousness, the communication\r\nfrom body to body of the specific matter or germ, which when bred\r\nand multiplied produces the fever. This he called the master-fact\r\nin its history. He further believed that all the emanations from\r\nthe typhoid patient are in a certain degree infectious, but that\r\nwhat is cast off from the intestine is incomparably more virulent\r\nthan anything else. Wherever no sufficient provision was made for\r\npreventing such material from contaminating the soil and air of the\r\ninhabited area around, notwithstanding the most spacious rooms, the\r\nfreest ventilation, and careful nursing, he found there was no real\r\nsecurity against the spread of the fever. The fact alleged against\r\nDr. Budd’s views, that typhoid is seldom taken by attendants on the\r\nsick, does not at all militate against his teaching, for unless they\r\nreceived into their system through milk, water, food, or air, some of\r\nthe specific poison of typhoid, they would certainly not suffer.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Dr. Budd settled in Clifton, and was in 1847 elected\r\nPhysician to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He lectured for a number\r\nof years in the Bristol Medical School, and worked incessantly\r\nat maturing and propagating his views on the nature and mode of\r\npropagation of zymotic disease. He was no mere theorist, but in all\r\nhis pursuits had most practical objects in view, seeking to enforce\r\non his medical brethren, public authorities as well as private\r\npersons, the urgent necessity of the most careful, well-advised,\r\nand continuous methods of disinfection. He was in effect a great\r\nsanitarian and champion of preventive medicine. Pure water was one of\r\nhis great panaceas. The Bristol Waterworks were among his cherished\r\nobjects of promotion and watchfulness. His remarkable clearness of\r\nvision and strength of conviction made him somewhat impatient of\r\nthe strenuous opposition with which his views were met. For a long\r\nperiod he was almost alone in his uphill fight. He did not fully put\r\nhis views before the profession till 1857-60, when he published a\r\nseries of papers in the _Lancet_, afterwards embodied in his work\r\non typhoid fever; but he had long before taught them in the Bristol\r\nMedical School, and practically acted upon them himself. During the\r\ndepressing period of opposition which he encountered, almost the only\r\nsympathy he could count on was that of the late Sir Thomas Watson,\r\nwho encouraged him greatly, believing his investigations to be of\r\npriceless value. Cheered in this way, Budd continued to promulgate\r\nhis views, dogmatically it is true, but in a manner singularly\r\nattractive, for he had a natural kindliness of disposition and\r\nfreedom from all jealousy. His impressive eloquence was not more\r\nstriking than his logical power, which is evident in all his works.\r\n\r\nAsiatic cholera, when it broke out in Bristol in 1866, found William\r\nBudd and Bristol prepared. The deaths from this destroyer in 1849\r\nhad been 1979, in 1866 they were but 29, notwithstanding that the\r\ndisease broke out very severely, and occurred in twenty-six different\r\nlocalities. Budd’s preventive measures, and his stringent plans of\r\ndisinfection, proved victorious. He made the contagious diseases\r\nof animals subjects of special study; and his conclusion was that\r\nseveral of them could only be adequately dealt with by immediately\r\nslaughtering the infected animals. This view he took in regard to the\r\nterrible rinderpest of 1866: and his advice of “a poleaxe and a pit\r\nof quicklime,” though at first ridiculed, had to be followed, after\r\ngreat loss had taken place through not following it earlier.\r\n\r\nDr. Budd was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1870. Besides\r\nhis famous work on typhoid fever, and many scattered contributions\r\nto medical journals and societies, Dr. Budd was the author of the\r\nfollowing works, many of which are of very great value:—“Malignant\r\nCholera: its Mode of Propagation and its Prevention” (1849);\r\n“Scarlet Fever and its Prevention” (1869); “The Siberian Cattle\r\nPlague, or the Typhoid Fever of the Ox” (1865); “On Diseases which\r\naffect Corresponding Parts of the Body in a Symmetrical Manner”\r\n(1842); “Researches on Gout” (1855); “Cholera and Disinfection, or\r\nAsiatic Cholera in Bristol in 1866” (1871); “Variola Ovina—Sheep’s\r\nSmallpox—or the Laws of Contagious Epidemics Illustrated by an\r\nExperimental Type” (1863). He was an accomplished draughtsman and\r\nan excellent photographer, and made great use of these arts in his\r\nresearches. He was well skilled in French, German, and Italian,\r\nand kept himself well up in Continental as well as English medical\r\nliterature. He worked with untiring energy and industry, having\r\na large practice extending far beyond Bristol: but the attempt to\r\ncombine this with so much original research proved too much for his\r\nconstitution. He had been originally strong, but was weakened by two\r\nattacks of fever, and finally in 1873 his health broke down, and this\r\nled to his finally retiring from practice and settling at Clevedon,\r\nwhere he died January 9, 1880. Just previously to his retirement he\r\nhad committed to his friend Dr. Paget of Cambridge a brief summary\r\nof the results of many years’ study of pulmonary consumption, as to\r\nits communicability from person to person by organic germs. This was\r\npublished in the _Lancet_ at the time, but unfortunately the fuller\r\nresearches therein referred to have never been given to the public.\r\nBut in connection with typhoid and other zymotic fevers he has left\r\non the subject the indelible impression of his great genius.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe exertions of CHARLES MURCHISON, who died before Budd, though\r\nmuch younger, were largely devoted to controverting Budd’s views\r\non the germ theory of zymotic diseases. He belonged to the same\r\nAberdeenshire family from which Sir Roderick Murchison the geologist\r\nsprang, and was born in Jamaica in 1830. His father, himself a\r\nphysician, spent his latter days in Elgin, where his son Charles was\r\nat first educated. As early as 1845 he entered Aberdeen University,\r\nbut in 1847-8 he commenced medical study at Edinburgh, and in\r\nsuccessive years gained numerous distinctions and considerable\r\nnote as a diligent and successful student. In 1850 he was Syme’s\r\nhouse-surgeon. In August 1857, when he graduated, he received the\r\ngold medal for his thesis on the Pathology of Morbid Growths. He\r\nfurther studied at the Rotunda, Dublin, and in Paris, whence he went\r\nto India, being appointed Professor of Chemistry to the Medical\r\nCollege, Calcutta. In this office he was both successful as an\r\nexperimenter and as an expositor. Later, he went with the army on\r\nthe British Expedition against Burmah, and utilised the opportunity\r\nto make valuable observations on the climate and diseases of Burmah,\r\nwhich he afterwards published.\r\n\r\nReturning to England in 1855, Murchison became a member of the\r\nLondon College of Physicians, Physician to the Westminster General\r\nDispensary, and Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. Mary’s Hospital.\r\nIn 1856 he was appointed Assistant-Physician to King’s College\r\nHospital, which office he resigned in 1860, and joined the staff\r\nof the Middlesex Hospital. He further held from 1856 the post of\r\nAssistant-Physician to the London Fever Hospital, steadily pursuing\r\nthere as elsewhere his investigations into the nature and causes of\r\nzymotic diseases, from which he himself twice suffered in the form of\r\ntyphus fever, which left in him heart-mischief that ultimately caused\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 appeared Murchison’s work on “The Continued Fevers of Great\r\nBritain,” dealing especially with typhus, typhoid, and relapsing\r\nfevers. In this he treats exhaustively the history, geographical\r\nrange, causation, symptoms, treatment, and many other questions\r\nconnected with fevers, and endeavours especially to reduce his\r\nobservations to a numerical expression. His strong conviction\r\nwas that these diseases are preventable, and that they originate\r\nin certain unhealthy and impure conditions capable of generating\r\nspecific poisons in each case. But as he commenced his work at the\r\nLondon Fever Hospital believing that typhus and typhoid fever were\r\nmere varieties of one disease, in spite of Stewart’s and Jenner’s\r\npublications, so he maintained to the last that Budd’s view as to the\r\ngerm origin of typhoid fever was erroneous, and that even if typhoid\r\nwere communicable by germs, it could arise anew when favouring\r\nconditions of decomposition occurred. He regarded it as proved that\r\ntyphoid fever is constantly appearing where decomposing sewage is\r\npresent, but where every effort fails to detect contamination from a\r\nprevious typhoid patient.\r\n\r\nMurchison’s work was at once recognised as a standard one. The first\r\nedition was rapidly sold, and it was translated into German. The\r\npublication of a second edition was, however, delayed till 1873,\r\nowing to Murchison’s strong desire to make his book as complete\r\nstatistically as possible. The first edition was based on 6703\r\ncases of continued fever admitted into the London Fever Hospital\r\nin the years 1848-57, but the second included the results of a far\r\nlarger number, 28,863, admitted during 1848-70, thus giving the\r\nentire medical history of the fever hospital from the time that the\r\ndifferent continued fevers were first distinguished in 1848. Energy\r\nand resolution of the most intense description are indicated by\r\nsuch a labour. This work had to be done in the intervals of growing\r\npractice and hospital teaching. By the time he was forty years old\r\nMurchison was one of the leading London physicians, and continued in\r\nfull work till his death.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in regard to fevers that Murchison held a conspicuous\r\nplace and published works of great value. In 1868 he published an\r\nexcellent series of “Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver,”\r\nwhich reached a second edition in 1877, when he added to them\r\nthe Croonian Lectures on “Functional Derangements of the Liver,”\r\ndelivered at the College of Physicians in 1874. In 1871, when St.\r\nThomas’s new hospital was opened, Murchison was invited to join\r\nits staff as full physician and joint-lecturer on medicine. In\r\nthis growing school he found full scope for his great talent as\r\na clinical teacher. Of his success in this capacity the _Lancet_\r\nsaid[11]—“His teaching was a reflex of his singular lucidity of\r\nthought and expression, which not only attracted the student with its\r\ndistinctness and brilliancy, but furnished him with a method on which\r\nto found his own facts and observations.” His inaugural address as\r\nPresident of the Pathological Society in 1877 gave further proof of\r\nhis marked originality of thought.\r\n\r\nMurchison’s accomplishments and personal attractiveness were as\r\nremarkable as his professional talents and industry. In botany,\r\nzoology, chemistry, and geology he had very wide knowledge, and he\r\nedited the palæontological memoirs of his friend Hugh Falconer, the\r\nexplorer of the Miocene fauna of the Siwalik Hills. Fly-fishing\r\nwas his favourite recreation. “In personal appearance,” says the\r\n_Lancet_, “Dr. Murchison was slightly below middle stature, and\r\nbefore the commencement of his fatal illness, of sturdy robust\r\nbuild, with the appearance of one well fitted to bear the trials\r\nand struggles of life. His head was large, the forehead high and\r\nfull, the hair black, and eyes of surprising brilliancy and power of\r\nexpression. In manner he was reserved, sparing of speech, and free\r\nfrom that impulsiveness which hails the ordinary acquaintances of\r\nlife as esteemed friends. To those who knew him intimately, however,\r\nhis full character was revealed, and they found in him a depth\r\nof love, tenderness, and sympathy, together with a constancy and\r\ndevotion in friendship, rarely found in more demonstrative natures.”\r\nHe attached himself particularly to the younger members of his\r\nprofession, and never spared time or trouble in assisting them with\r\nhis counsel and sympathy. He suffered severely from heart disease\r\nfor several years before his death, which took place suddenly in the\r\ninterval between the departure of one patient and the announcement of\r\nanother, on the 23d April 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Obituary notice, May 3, 1879, p. 645.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_SIR JOSEPH LISTER AND ANTISEPTIC SURGERY._\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain and again in these pages the hereditary succession of\r\nscientific powers has been illustrated. Not the least eminent example\r\nis to be found in the case of Sir Joseph Lister, who is the son of\r\nMr. Joseph Jackson Lister, F.R.S., of Upton House, Essex, who in the\r\nwords of the Rev. J. B. Reade, F.R.S., in his presidential address\r\nto the Royal Microscopical Society in 1870, “raised the compound\r\nmicroscope from its primitive and almost useless condition to that\r\nof being the most important instrument ever yet bestowed by art upon\r\nthe investigator of nature.” Mr. J. J. Lister was born in London\r\non January 11, 1786, his parents being members of the Society of\r\nFriends. At fourteen years of age he left school to assist his father\r\nin the wine trade: but though for many years closely occupied in\r\nbusiness, he contrived by early rising and otherwise to supplement\r\nhis plain school education, and to make himself accomplished in\r\nmathematics, as well as generally acquainted with most subjects\r\nin literature, science, and art. His predilection for optics was\r\nearly shown. As a little child with shortsighted eyes, he enjoyed\r\nlooking through air bubbles in the window-pane, enabling him to see\r\ndistant objects more clearly. At school he was the only boy who\r\npossessed a telescope. He soon became addicted to microscopical\r\nstudy; but it was not till 1824, when he was 38 years old, that he\r\nthought of improving the object-glass of the compound microscope,\r\nand made suggestions to W. Tulley, the optician, which resulted in\r\nthe production of a new object-glass much less thick and clumsy,\r\nwhich speedily became the favourite. On January 21st, 1830, he read\r\na paper before the Royal Society “On the Improvement of Compound\r\nMicroscopes,” announcing the remarkable discovery of the existence of\r\ntwo aplanatic foci in a double achromatic object-glass. This formed\r\na basis for subsequent important improvements. In 1837 he gave to\r\nAndrew Ross the construction for a ⅛-inch objective of three compound\r\nlenses, by which that maker’s fame was largely increased, and it\r\nbecame the standard form for high power for many years. He also made\r\nsome notable researches “On the Structure and Functions of Tubular\r\nPolypi and Ascidiæ” (Phil. Trans. 1834), and independently came to\r\nthe same conclusions as Sir George Airy, the late Astronomer-Royal,\r\non the limits of human vision as determined by the nature of light\r\nand of the eye; but his paper on this subject was never published,\r\nowing to the publication of Sir George Airy’s researches. He survived\r\nin vigorous health to see his son Joseph in secure possession of\r\nfame, dying on October 24, 1869. His son records[12] that “he was\r\nmost unselfish, and scrupulously tender of hurting the feelings of\r\nothers, and extremely generous in the pecuniary support of public\r\nphilanthropic objects, as well as in secret acts of charity. Though\r\nwarmly attached to the religious Society of Friends, to which he\r\nbelonged, he was a man of very liberal views and catholic sympathies.\r\nBut the crowning grace of this beautiful character, though it might\r\nveil his rich gifts from those not intimate with him, was a most rare\r\nmodesty and Christian humility.”\r\n\r\nJOSEPH LISTER was born in 1828, and took the B.A. degree at\r\nLondon University in 1847. Pursuing a course of medical study at\r\nUniversity College, London, he gained the M.B. degree in 1852, being\r\nawarded gold medals in anatomy and in botany at the first M.B.\r\nexamination, and the scholarship and gold medal in surgery at the\r\nfinal examination. He became Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons\r\nin 1852, and took a similar qualification at Edinburgh in 1855. He\r\nmarried a daughter of Mr. Syme, then Professor of Surgery in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nDevoting himself to physiological research on matters having a wide\r\nbearing on practical medicine and surgery, Mr. Lister attained wide\r\nrepute as an original investigator at a comparatively early age, and\r\nhis position in physiology was assured by a series of papers which\r\nwould suffice to make his career memorable, if he had never applied\r\nantiseptic measures to the treatment of disease. Beginning with some\r\nobservations on the contractile tissue of the iris in 1853, he went\r\non to study the muscular tissue of the skin, the flow of the lacteal\r\nfluid, and the minute structure of involuntary muscular fibre, on\r\nall of which subjects his papers are published in the “Journal\r\nof Microscopical Science.” In 1857 he commenced his series of\r\ncontributions to the Royal Society, the first being on the functions\r\nof the visceral nerves, with special reference to the inhibitory\r\nsystem. This was further developed in “An Inquiry regarding the\r\nParts of the Nervous System which regulate the Contractions of the\r\nArteries” (Phil. Trans. 1858). But his two most important papers at\r\nthis period are those on the Early Stages of Inflammation (1857), and\r\non the Coagulation of the Blood, delivered as the Croonian Lecture\r\nfor 1863.\r\n\r\nFor some years Mr. Lister was a lecturer on surgery in the Edinburgh\r\nExtra-Academical School. He was afterwards elected Professor of\r\nSurgery in Glasgow University, and Surgeon to the Glasgow Royal\r\nInfirmary.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Lister held these appointments, circumstances occurred\r\nwhich were calculated to stimulate to the highest degree the effort\r\nto discover some method of dressing wounds which should obviate the\r\ndangers of putrefactive changes. About 1860 a new surgical hospital\r\nwas erected as part of this infirmary, and although many of the\r\nmost approved principles of hospital construction had been adopted,\r\nthe building proved extremely unhealthy. Pyæmia, erysipelas, and\r\nhospital gangrene soon showed themselves, affecting on the average\r\nmost severely those parts of the building nearest to the ground. For\r\nseveral years Mr. Lister found that in his male accident ward, which\r\nwas on the ground-floor, when nearly all the beds contained patients\r\nwith open sores, the diseases which result from hospital atmosphere\r\nwere sure to be present in an aggravated form; whereas, when a large\r\nproportion of the cases had no external wound, these evils were\r\ngreatly mitigated or entirely absent. At this period the managers\r\nwere very desirous of introducing additional beds into the wards,\r\nto supply accommodation for the rapidly increasing population of\r\nGlasgow; and Mr. Lister strongly and firmly resisted such increase in\r\nhis wards. Some of the wards indeed at times became subject to such\r\nsevere mortality that they had to be closed for various periods. One\r\nparticular visitation was so serious that it was resolved to make an\r\ninvestigation to discover if possible the cause of the evil, which\r\nmight, one would think, have been done at an earlier period. Great\r\nwas the shock of every one concerned to find that a few inches below\r\nthe surface of the ground behind the two lowest male accident wards,\r\nwith only the basement area, four feet wide, intervening, there was\r\nthe uppermost tier of a multitude of coffins, which had been placed\r\nthere at the time of the cholera epidemic of 1849. The corpses had\r\nundergone so little change in the interval that the clothes they had\r\non at the time of their hurried burial were plainly distinguishable.\r\nThe wonder was, not that these wards on the ground-floor had been\r\nunhealthy, but that they had not been absolutely pestilential. Yet\r\nat the very time when this shocking disclosure was made, Mr. Lister\r\nwas able to state, in an address which he delivered to the British\r\nMedical Association at Dublin in 1867, that during the previous nine\r\nmonths, in which his new antiseptic plans of treatment had been in\r\noperation in his wards, not a single case of pyæmia, erysipelas, or\r\nhospital gangrene had occurred in them.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the infirmary of course did all in their power\r\nto remedy this insalubrious state of things. They poured large\r\nquantities of carbolic acid and quicklime upon the ground,\r\nconsidering this a less dangerous proceeding than to attempt the\r\nremoval of the putrefying mass; they covered the ground with an\r\nadditional thickness of earth, and adopted other measures. The\r\nhospital itself was far from being well situated in other respects.\r\nIt abutted against the old Cathedral Churchyard, much used for the\r\n“pit burial” of paupers in a most deleterious state of aggregation.\r\nYet during the two years and a quarter intervening between the Dublin\r\naddress and Mr. Lister’s leaving Glasgow for Edinburgh, his new\r\nantiseptic system continued in the main as successful as before.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1864 Professor Lister had been much struck\r\nwith an account of the remarkable effects produced by carbolic\r\nacid upon the sewage of the town of Carlisle, the admixture of a\r\nvery small proportion not only preventing all odour from the lands\r\nirrigated with the refuse material, but also destroying the entozoa\r\nwhich usually infest cattle fed upon such pastures. His attention\r\nhaving been for several years greatly directed, as we have seen\r\nabove, to the subject of suppuration, especially in its relation to\r\ndecomposition, he saw that such a powerful antiseptic was peculiarly\r\nadapted for experiments with a view to elucidating that subject, and\r\nthus the applicability of carbolic acid to the treatment of compound\r\nfractures occurred to him.\r\n\r\nThe antiseptic system was put into practice in the Glasgow Infirmary\r\nin March 1865, but at first applied almost exclusively in compound\r\nfractures (or those in which there is an external wound) and\r\nabscesses. From 1867 it was employed for almost all surgical cases.\r\nIt arose out of Mr. Lister’s study of Schwann and Pasteur’s germ\r\ntheory and the experiments connected with them. He repeated many of\r\nthe experiments, and devised new methods calculated to test whether\r\nthey were capable of explaining the phenomena of putrefaction. These\r\nsufficed to prove definitely that in putrefaction the development of\r\nsuch organisms as the microscope could detect, and the concomitant\r\nputrefactive changes, were occasioned by minute germs suspended in\r\nthe atmosphere. Professor Tyndall’s beautiful experiments, by which\r\nhe demonstrated the perfect manner in which cotton wool filters the\r\nair of its suspended particles, led to the idea (suggested by Dr.\r\nMeredith of the Indian service to Mr. Lister) that cotton wool might\r\nbe used with advantage as an antiseptic dressing. The cotton wool\r\nmust itself be rendered pure of germs by some antiseptic agency, for\r\nby the theory the air within it must contain germs. But the main\r\nfeature upon which Mr. Lister for a long time relied was the copious\r\nuse of carbolic acid in such a form as to prevent the occurrence of\r\nputrefaction in the part concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. Lister’s first paper on the subject, published in the _Lancet_\r\nfor 1867, struck a chord which the editor of that journal emphasised\r\nas follows on August 24 of that year (p. 234): “If Professor Lister’s\r\nconclusions with regard to the power of carbolic acid in compound\r\nfractures should be confirmed by further experiment and observation,\r\nit will be difficult to overrate the importance of what we may\r\nreally call his discovery. For although he bases his surgical use\r\nof carbolic acid upon the researches of M. Pasteur, the application\r\nof these researches to the case of compound fractures, opened\r\nabscesses, and other recent wounds, is all his own.” The risk of\r\nblood-poisoning after operations in themselves slight, was declared\r\nto be the one great opprobrium of surgery. There was no limit to\r\nthe operative skill of surgeons, but a miserable and serious risk of\r\nfatal after-consequences against which the surgeon had no defence.\r\nMr. (now Sir James) Paget had in 1862 given forth an idea of which\r\nwe can now more clearly see the bearing, when he said that the best\r\nresults he had seen in cases of pyæmia were with patients kept night\r\nand day in a current of wind. We now see that this in fact amounted\r\nto continually passing over the patient air less charged with germs\r\nthan that of the room or ward in which he was placed. Mr. Lister\r\ncontemplated the destruction of these germs at the seat of the wound,\r\nand the prevention of the access of fresh germs.\r\n\r\nAn example will perhaps illustrate the matter better than a\r\ntheoretical account. An experiment was performed on the 31st December\r\n1868 on a young calf a few days old, under chloroform, namely, the\r\ntying of the carotid artery on the antiseptic system, with threads\r\ncomposed of animal tissue. The threads employed had all been soaked\r\nfor four hours in a saturated watery solution of carbolic acid, which\r\nswelled and softened them. The hair near the wound was cut short,\r\nand a solution of carbolic acid in linseed oil rubbed well into the\r\nskin to destroy any putrefactive organisms lying amongst the roots\r\nof the hair. The sponges employed in the operation were wrung out of\r\na watery solution of the acid, and all the instruments introduced\r\ninto the wound, together with the fingers of the operator’s left\r\nhand and the copper wire used for sutures, were treated with the\r\nsame lotion, some of which was poured into the wound after the\r\nintroduction of the last stitch, at one of the intervals left for\r\nthe escape of discharge, to provide against the chance of any fresh\r\nblood which might have oozed out during the process of stitching\r\nhaving passed back and taken fresh germs in with it. The external\r\ndressing was a towel saturated with the oily solution of carbolic\r\nacid, folded as broad as the length of the neck, wrapped so as to\r\nextend freely beyond the wound, and prevented by several contrivances\r\nfrom slipping. A sheet of gutta-percha tissue was applied outside to\r\nprevent contamination of the antiseptic towel from without. A few\r\nounces of the oily solution were poured daily over the towel for the\r\nfirst week, after which the dressings were left untouched for three\r\ndays and then entirely removed. The wound was found quite dry, and\r\nfree from tenderness. When the animal was subsequently killed, the\r\nligatures were seen to be converted into living tissue; and such\r\nexperiments proved how valuable animal fibres might be as ligatures\r\nunder the antiseptic system.\r\n\r\nAgain, a portion of cotton wool was impregnated with about one\r\ntwo-hundredth part of its weight of carbolic-acid vapour, and the\r\nsurface of a granulating sore and surrounding skin was washed with\r\na dilute solution of the acid. A piece of oiled silk of the size of\r\nthe sore was then applied, to prevent the dressings from sticking\r\nthrough becoming dry. Over this was placed a piece of folded linen\r\nrag of rather larger size, and similarly impregnated with carbolic\r\nacid vapour to the cotton wool; this being intended to absorb any\r\ndischarge from the sore. Lastly, an overlapping mass of carbolised\r\ncotton wool was securely fixed over all. The result was that although\r\nall chemical antiseptic virtue left the dressing by evaporation of\r\nthe volatile carbolic acid in a day or two, yet putrefaction was\r\npractically excluded by the cotton wool for any length of time.\r\n\r\nSubsequently another variety of protective material was adopted,\r\nnamely antiseptic gauze, a loose cotton fabric, the fibres of which\r\nwere impregnated with carbolic acid lodged in insoluble resin. The\r\ninterstices between the fibres were kept free from these ingredients,\r\nso that the porous fabric might readily absorb discharges. By\r\narranging this in a sufficient number of layers and covering the\r\nwhole with a layer of mackintosh, the discharge was compelled to\r\npass through the whole length of the antiseptic dressing. Thus it\r\nwas almost certain that if no putrefactive mischief were left in a\r\nwound or abscess, none would enter it, however profuse might be the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nIf a wound was presented for treatment, inflicted by some other\r\nthan the surgeon, some dust was sure to have been introduced, which\r\nprobably contained putrefactive germs. The energy of these had\r\nfirst to be destroyed by washing the raw surface with some strong\r\nantiseptic agent. But in operating upon a previously unbroken skin,\r\nMr. Lister considered that he could prevent the septic particles\r\nfrom entering at all, by operating in an antiseptic atmosphere. This\r\nwas provided by producing a shower of spray of carbolic acid of the\r\nfinest character. This answered exceedingly well when the solution\r\nproducing the spray consisted only of one part of carbolic acid to\r\n100 parts of water.\r\n\r\nHere we must limit our detailed account of the antiseptic system.\r\nUnder it large abscesses are opened, the matter pressed out, and\r\nfresh matter does not form, and cures are effected in severe cases\r\nwhich scarcely ever used to be cured. Arteries are tied with a\r\nsecurity before unknown. Amputations and excisions are effected with\r\na safety and diminished mortality quite surprising. Even senile\r\ngangrene shows hopeful results which were previously quite out\r\nof question. Pyæmia, hospital gangrene, and erysipelas have been\r\nalmost banished from wards where the system is properly carried\r\nout. Recently a modification has been introduced, in which there\r\nis employed, not a volatile material as in the case of carbolic\r\nacid, but a dilute solution of corrosive sublimate combined with\r\nalbumen. Gauze is now prepared for Sir Joseph Lister steeped in\r\nthis substance, and it may become generally adopted; but it does\r\nnot appear likely to supersede carbolic acid for the purification\r\nof instruments, sponges, the skin, or as a substitute for the\r\ncarbolic spray. The particular form of antiseptic is a matter of\r\ndetail, on which improvement may long continue to be made; but\r\nthe development of the essential idea of preventing the access of\r\ngerms which can cause putrefactive changes by one method or another,\r\nand the destruction of them as far as possible when they have\r\nobtained access, will remain connected with Sir Joseph Lister as\r\nan achievement of the highest force; indeed his name seems likely\r\nto give a new word to our language, namely Listerism, by which the\r\nessential features of his system are understood.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lister was awarded a Royal Medal by the Royal Society of\r\nLondon in 1880, having previously received the high distinction of\r\nthe MacDougall Brisbane Prize from the Royal Society of Edinburgh\r\nin 1875, for a remarkable paper on the Germ Theory of Fermentative\r\nChanges. He was created a baronet in December 1883. The universities\r\nof Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Glasgow had conferred upon him the\r\nhonorary degree of LL.D., and Oxford that of D.C.L. He has been for\r\nsome years Surgeon to King’s College Hospital, having succeeded Sir\r\nWilliam Fergusson.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _Monthly Microscopical Journal_, 1870, iii. p. 143.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_SIR THOMAS WATSON, SIR DOMINIC CORRIGAN, SIR WILLIAM GULL, AND\r\nCLINICAL MEDICINE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nestor of the medical profession, Sir Thomas Watson, died in\r\n1882, at the great age of ninety, universally beloved and honoured.\r\nYet he had written but one extended work, the “Lectures on the\r\nPrinciples and Practice of Physic,” and had made no striking\r\ndiscovery. But to have written a book which every cultivated\r\npractitioner reads, and reads with delight and satisfaction, is an\r\nachievement given to few, many though there be who aim at it. And Sir\r\nThomas Watson’s personal character was as unique as his advice was\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WATSON was born on March 7th, 1792, at Montrath (now Dulford)\r\nHouse, near Cullompton, Devonshire, where his father, Joseph\r\nWatson, a Northumbrian by family, was then living. He was educated\r\nat Bury St. Edmund’s Grammar School, where he was a schoolfellow\r\nwith Blomfield, afterwards Bishop of London, and a great friend of\r\nWatson’s. In 1811 he entered at St. John’s College, Cambridge,\r\nand became tenth wrangler and fellow of his college. At that time\r\nonly two fellows of St. John’s could retain their fellowships\r\nwithout taking orders, and one of these must study medicine. This\r\ncircumstance availed to turn Watson’s attention to medicine in 1819\r\nat the age of 27, when he entered St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and\r\ncame under the powerful influence of Abernethy. During the session\r\n1820-1 he attended medical lectures at Edinburgh University, and in\r\n1822 received his licence to practise from Cambridge. But academical\r\npursuits were continued, and Watson took private pupils, among whom\r\nwas Lord Auckland, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, and served\r\nthe office of proctor in 1823-4. In 1825 he took his M.D. degree,\r\nand married Miss Jones, niece of Turner, Dean of Norwich and Master\r\nof Pembroke College. Soon afterwards he established himself as a\r\nphysician in Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, London, in which\r\nstreet he continued to live for fifty-seven years. His wife died, to\r\nhis lasting regret, five years later, leaving him with one son and\r\ndaughter, to whom he was devotedly attached.\r\n\r\nWatson was recognised from the commencement of his London career as\r\na man of mark, and in 1827 he was elected Physician to the Middlesex\r\nHospital. In 1828, on the opening of the University College, he was\r\nappointed Professor of Clinical Medicine, retaining his post at the\r\nMiddlesex Hospital; but he transferred his services as lecturer to\r\nKing’s College in 1831, becoming Professor of Forensic Medicine.\r\nPractice had come but slowly in these years. In 1831 he made his\r\nfirst contribution to medical literature, in the shape of “Remarks\r\non the Dissection of Bishop, and the Phenomena attending Death by\r\nStrangulation” (_Medical Gazette_). Bishop had murdered an Italian\r\norgan-boy, and brought the body to King’s College for sale: Bishop\r\nwas hanged, and his body, like that of his victim, came to King’s\r\nCollege for dissection. From this time Dr. Watson made numerous\r\ncontributions to the _Medical Gazette_, largely embodied in his\r\nsubsequent great work. In July 1832 he was chosen to accompany Sir\r\nWalter Scott from London to Edinburgh when he was returning from\r\nItaly to Abbotsford for the last time.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Dr. Watson was appointed to the chair of the Principles and\r\nPractice of Medicine at King’s College, and in the ensuing winter\r\ndelivered the first draught of those lectures on which his fame\r\nrests. They soon became well known, and they were printed weekly\r\nin the _Medical Gazette_ in 1840-2. Finally they were published in\r\ntwo volumes by Parker in 1844, and became acknowledged as medical\r\nclassics. Mr. Parker showed a righteous liberality when their great\r\nsale had brought in a large sum, in granting the author two-thirds\r\nof the profits instead of one-half, as had been agreed, and handing\r\nhim twelve hundred pounds as a first payment. Watson had already,\r\nin 1840, resigned his chair at King’s College rather than leave his\r\nold post at Middlesex Hospital, but in 1843 he was compelled by\r\nthe increase of private practice to resign even this. Henceforward,\r\nespecially after the retirement of Dr. Chambers in 1848, he was at\r\nthe head of London practice for many years. He was not, however,\r\nappointed one of the Queen’s Physicians-Extraordinary till 1859;\r\nin 1861 he was called in to attend the Prince-Consort in his fatal\r\nillness, and in 1866 he was created a baronet, receiving in 1870\r\nthe further appointment of Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen. The\r\nCollege of Physicians elected him President in 1862, an office he\r\nheld for five years. From 1858 to 1860 he represented the College\r\non the General Medical Council. In 1857-8 he was President of the\r\nPathological Society, and he was in 1868 the first President of\r\nthe Clinical Society. In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nTwo quotations from Watson’s Introductory Lecture to his course will\r\nserve to indicate some of the qualities which have given his book\r\nsuch popularity. Referring to the study of anatomy and physiology, he\r\nsays; “Do not think that I am wandering from my proper subject when\r\nI bid you to remember how profoundly interesting, how almost awful,\r\nis the study in itself and for its own sake, revealing, as it surely\r\ndoes, the inimitable workmanship of a Hand that is Divine. Do not\r\nlose or disregard that grand and astonishing lesson. Do not listen\r\nto those who may tell you not to look for the evidence of purpose in\r\nthis field of study, that the visible mechanism of that intricate\r\nbut marvellously perfect and harmonious work, the animal body—the\r\nnumberless examples of means suited to ends, of fitness for a use,\r\nof even prospective arrangements to meet future needs, of direct\r\nprovisions for happiness and enjoyment—that all these have no force\r\nat all, in true philosophy, as evidences of design. For my own part,\r\nI declare that I can no more avoid perceiving, with my mental vision,\r\nthe evidential marks of purpose in the structure of the body, than\r\nI can help seeing with my open eyes, in broad daylight, the objects\r\nthat stand before my face.”\r\n\r\nAgain, he characterises the profession of medicine in noble terms.\r\n“The profession of medicine having for its end the common good of\r\nmankind, knows nothing of national enmities, of political strife,\r\nof sectarian divisions. Disease and pain the sole conditions of its\r\nministry, it is disquieted by no misgivings about the justice or the\r\nhonesty of its client’s cause; but dispenses its peculiar benefits,\r\nwithout stint or scruple, to men of every country or party, and rank\r\nand religion, and to men of no religion at all. And like the quality\r\nof mercy, of which it is the favourite handmaid, it “blesses him that\r\ngives and him that takes,” reading continually to our own hearts\r\nand understandings the most impressive lessons, the most solemn\r\nwarnings. It is ours to know in how many instances, forming indeed\r\na vast majority of the whole, bodily suffering and sickness are the\r\nnatural fruits of evil courses—of the sins of our fathers, of our\r\nown unbridled passions, of the malevolent spirit of others. We see,\r\ntoo, the uses of these judgments, which are mercifully designed to\r\nrecall men from the strong allurements of sense, and the slumber of\r\ntemporal prosperity, teaching that it is good for us to be sometimes\r\nafflicted. Familiar with death in its manifold shapes, witnessing\r\nfrom day to day its sudden stroke, its slow but open siege, its\r\nsecret and insidious approaches, we are not permitted to be unmindful\r\nthat our own stay also is brief and uncertain, our opportunities\r\nfleeting, and our time, even when longest, very short, if measured by\r\nour moral wants and intellectual cravings.”\r\n\r\nThese lectures had the largest sale of any similar work in the\r\nauthor’s lifetime. Five large editions were published under his\r\nown revision. He most unsparingly altered his previous views with\r\nthe advance of science, and showed rare modesty in his expressions\r\nthereupon. Dr. Charles West has admirably sketched his friend’s\r\ncharacter (_Medical Times and Gazette_, Dec. 16, 1882): “He laid\r\nno claim to genius; he made no great discovery. Though a scholar\r\nhe was not more learned, though a good speaker he was not more\r\neloquent, than many of his contemporaries whose names are now\r\nwell-nigh forgotten; and yet he was by universal consent regarded as\r\nthe completest illustration of the highest type of the physician.\r\nHis moral as well as his intellectual qualities had much to do with\r\nthe estimate which all formed of his character. His faculties were\r\nremarkably well balanced, his mind was eminently fair. He had that\r\ngift—the attribute and the reward of truth—the power intuitively\r\nto detect all specious error. Hence, while the added experience of\r\neach year gave increased value to his teachings and his writings, it\r\nbrought but little for him to unlearn or to unsay. He took a wide\r\nview of every question.... He availed himself of knowledge from all\r\nsources, and for all purposes except vain display; he used theories\r\nto illustrate his facts and to point their meaning, but no further,\r\nconscious that, with imperfect knowledge, it would be idle to attempt\r\nto build up correct theory.... Take him in his teaching, all in all,\r\nhe seems to me, more than any one I ever knew, to be the undoubted\r\nheir of England’s greatest practical physician, Thomas Sydenham.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer in the _British Medical Journal_, Dec. 23, 1882,\r\nspeaks of his serene and gentle temper, his modest dignity, his\r\nbenevolent kindness, his unfailing clearness of judgment. “Nothing\r\nthat happened in the professional world, of human or scientific\r\nimportance, was alien to him; and there are few men among his\r\ncontemporaries who have not at one time or another come to him for\r\nadvice and guidance. Conciliatory to the utmost bounds of kindness,\r\nhe was never open to the charge of favouring compromise.... It is\r\nrare indeed to find any man of whom it may be said as of him, that\r\nthere is not one man in the profession who would at any time have\r\ndeclined to accept Sir Thomas Watson’s judgment on any personal or\r\nprofessional question as final. His sense of justice, his habitual\r\nreference of all questions of detail to unassailable principle, his\r\nflexibility of mind, and his quick perception of character, gave\r\nhim a rare but well-justified ascendancy over even the ablest of\r\nhis contemporaries.” After a long old age spent in retirement from\r\npractice, but in continued vigorous professional study, of which he\r\ngave evidence in a little book on the Abolition of Zymotic Diseases,\r\npublished as late as 1879, the venerable man died of old age at his\r\nson’s residence at Reigate, in Surrey, on December 11, 1882.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBorn about ten years after the last-mentioned eminent physician,\r\nDOMINIC JOHN CORRIGAN for many years held a position in Dublin\r\nsomewhat parallel to that of Watson in London. He was a native of\r\nDublin, born on December 1st, 1802, his father having been a merchant\r\nin Thomas Street. Educated first at the lay college of St. Patrick’s\r\nat Maynooth, he entered upon medical study as the pupil of Dr.\r\nO’Kelly of Maynooth, who had foresight to discern that his pupil was\r\ncapable of rising to the highest position in the profession, and\r\nadvised his being sent to the Edinburgh Medical School. Part of his\r\nmedical study was, however, pursued in Dublin, where he attended\r\nclinical lectures at Sir Patrick Dun’s Hospital. His Edinburgh degree\r\ndates from 1825.\r\n\r\nThe rising science of pathology had deeply impressed young\r\nCorrigan’s mind, and he devoted himself, after settling in Dublin\r\nas physician to the Meath Street Dispensary, to original study. One\r\nof the principal fruits of his inquiries was his classic paper on\r\n“Permanent Patency of the Mouth of the Aorta, or Inadequacy of the\r\nAortic Valves,” published in the _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal_, April 1832. This paper commenced with the following\r\nstatement, “The disease to which the above name is given has not, so\r\nfar as I am aware, been described in any of the works on diseases\r\nof the heart. The object of the present paper is to supply that\r\ndeficiency. The disease is not uncommon. It supplies a considerable\r\nproportion of cases of deranged action of the heart, and it deserves\r\nattention from its peculiar signs, its progress, and its treatment.\r\nThe pathological essence of the disease consists in inefficiency of\r\nthe valvular apparatus at the mouth of the aorta, in consequence of\r\nwhich the blood sent into the mouth regurgitates into the ventricle.\r\nThis regurgitation, and the signs by which it is denoted, are not\r\nnecessarily connected with one particular change of structure in the\r\nvalvular apparatus.” One particular feature attending these cases,\r\nwhich Corrigan was the first fully to describe, was the extraordinary\r\ncharacter of the pulse, since known very generally as “Corrigan’s\r\npulse.” The strong visible pulsation in the arteries of the head,\r\nneck, and arms, bounding into a new position with each beat of the\r\nheart, and becoming prominent under the skin, has since proved\r\nthe means whereby aortic valvular disease of the heart has been\r\nrecognised in multitudes of cases. The full pulse, followed by almost\r\ncomplete collapse, has since been termed “jerking, splashing, or\r\ncollapsing,” or the “water-hammer pulse.” The peculiar rushing thrill\r\nfelt by the finger in the large superior arteries was also dwelt\r\nupon, as well as the “bruit de souffle” heard as an accompaniment of\r\nthe heart-sounds. Corrigan had corrected Laennec’s erroneous view of\r\nthe cause of this bruit, in a previous paper in the _Lancet_ of vol.\r\nii., 1829, p. 1.\r\n\r\nDr. Corrigan continued for some years zealously to investigate\r\nthe functions of the heart, and he experimented largely upon the\r\nhearts of fishes and reptiles. He published an important paper\r\n“On the Motions and Sounds of the Heart,” in the _Dublin Medical\r\nTransactions_, 1830, part i. At this period of his career, when\r\npractice as yet was but scanty, he was much encouraged by reading\r\n“The Lives of British Physicians, from Linacre to Gooch,” published\r\nin 1830, and he referred to it afterwards as showing that “there is\r\nbut one road to excellence and success in our profession, and that is\r\nby steady study and hard labour; and you will at least always have\r\nthis consolation in your dreariest hour of labour, that no proud\r\nman’s contumely, no insolence of office, nor ‘spurns that patient\r\nmerit of the unworthy takes,’ can bar your way.”\r\n\r\nResigning his post at the Meath Street Dispensary, Corrigan became\r\nsuccessively attached to the Cork Street Fever Hospital, and to\r\nthe Jervis Street Hospital. Yet the Irish College of Physicians\r\nfailed to discern his great merits, and blackballed him when he was\r\nfirst proposed for the fellowship, a mistake which they subsequently\r\natoned for in some measure by electing him their president for five\r\nsuccessive years, and by commissioning a statue of him, by Foley, at\r\nthe conclusion of his term of office. In 1833 he began to lecture\r\non the practice of medicine in the Carmichael School of Medicine,\r\nand practice grew rapidly. In 1840 he was appointed physician to the\r\nHouse of Industry Hospitals, which post he held till 1866. Here he\r\ndelivered a noteworthy course of lectures on the Nature and Treatment\r\nof Fever, which were published in 1853. He accepted and enforced the\r\nmodern views as to the distinctness of typhoid from typhus fever.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Dr. Corrigan became a member of the Senate of the new\r\nQueen’s University, of which after thirty years he was appointed\r\nVice-Chancellor. In 1849 Dublin University gave him the honorary\r\nM.D. He was assiduously devoted to the onerous duties of a\r\nCommissionership of National Education. As to practice, he became the\r\nmost popular and highly remunerated physician Dublin had ever seen,\r\nhaving for many years more calls upon him than he could possibly\r\nattend to, and receiving in several years as much as £9000 per\r\nannum in fees. In 1866 he was made a baronet in consideration both\r\nof his medical position and of his important services to national\r\neducation. He was also Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs member of the General Medical Council from 1858 till his death,\r\nSir Dominic Corrigan exercised a strong influence in favour of\r\nelevating the standard of professional education. He was an eloquent\r\nand lively debater and not at all averse to a display of verbal\r\npugnacity, but he was much and generally beloved. In 1868 Sir Dominic\r\nwas induced to come forward as an advanced Liberal candidate for\r\nthe representation of the city of Dublin in Parliament; but on that\r\noccasion, however, he was defeated. In 1870 he was elected by a\r\nmajority of over a thousand votes, and sat in Parliament till 1874.\r\nOriginally of a fine constitution, he suffered severely from gout in\r\nhis later years, and died after an attack of paralysis on Feb. 1,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe succession of clinical physicians is well sustained at the\r\npresent day in the person of Sir WILLIAM WITHEY GULL, Baronet. Born\r\non the last day of December 1816, at Thorpe-le-soken, Essex, William\r\nGull was educated privately, and early became a student of Guy’s\r\nHospital, London. To this establishment he was so attached that for\r\nfifteen years he resided within its walls or immediately adjacent.\r\nIn 1841 he became M.B. of London University, and in 1846 M.D. He was\r\nelected Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1846, and Fullerian\r\nProfessor of Physiology at the Royal Institution in 1847, which\r\noffice he held till 1849.\r\n\r\nVery early after his graduation as M.B., Dr. Gull was appointed to\r\nassist the pupils at Guy’s in their studies, or in other words,\r\nhe became medical tutor. In 1843 he began to lecture on natural\r\nphilosophy. In 1846 he undertook the important lectureships of\r\nphysiology and comparative anatomy in Guy’s Medical School. Meanwhile\r\nabout 1843 Dr. Gull had been appointed resident superintendent of\r\nthe asylum for twenty female lunatics which Guy had ordered to be\r\nmaintained. He formed a close acquaintance with Dr. Conolly, whose\r\nname will ever be connected with the rational treatment of the\r\ninsane in this country, and by adopting improved methods Dr. Gull\r\nwas finally so successful that the patients were all discharged\r\ncured, and the wards occupied by them devoted to the treatment of\r\nacute cases more properly coming under care in a general hospital.\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Gull was appointed assistant-physician to Guy’s, and in\r\ndue course succeeded to the full physiciancy. In this capacity his\r\nclinical teaching was long one of the important features at Guy’s. In\r\n1856 he became joint-lecturer on medicine, which office he held till\r\n1867 with great distinction. At this date he was compelled by the\r\nincreasing claims of practice to resign his appointment; but he is\r\nstill attached to Guy’s as consulting physician.\r\n\r\nPractice, indeed, came upon Dr. Gull all too soon for medical\r\nscience to reap the highest advantage from his original research.\r\nBut whatever he has written has been of high value and worthy\r\nof deep consideration. Among his writings may be mentioned the\r\nGulstonian Lectures on Paralysis (_Medical Gazette_, 1849), essays\r\non Hypochondriasis and Abscess of the Brain, in Reynolds’ “System\r\nof Medicine,” and Guy’s Hospital Reports, 1857; on Paraplegia, in\r\nGuy’s Hospital Reports for 1856, 1858, and 1861; on Anorexia Nervosa,\r\nand on a Cretinoid State, in the _Transactions of the Clinical\r\nSociety_, vol. vii. His Report on Cholera, with Dr. Baly, for the\r\nCollege of Physicians (1854), and his paper, with Dr. Sutton, on\r\nArterio-Capillary Fibrosis (_Med. Chir. Transactions_, vol. lv.),\r\nrank high as original contributions, which must always be consulted\r\nby writers on those subjects.\r\n\r\nIn an oration delivered before the Hunterian Society in 1861 Dr.\r\nGull took occasion to utter a protest against the popular prejudice\r\nfor specialists. “Who can treat as a speciality,” he asks, “the\r\nderangements and diseases of the stomach, whilst its relations and\r\nsympathies are so universal? How can there be a special ‘brain\r\ndoctor,’ whilst the functions of the brain are so dependent upon\r\nparts the most distant, and influences the most various? A tumour in\r\nthe brain may tell of its presence only through disturbance in the\r\nstomach, and a disorder of the stomach and its appendages may have\r\nfor its most prominent symptoms only various disturbances of the\r\nbrain.”\r\n\r\nIn his address on “Clinical Observation in Relation to Medicine,”\r\nbefore the British Medical Association in 1868, Dr. Gull thus\r\nexpressed his impartial attitude in medicine: “We have no system\r\nto satisfy; no dogmatic opinions to enforce. We have no ignorance\r\nto cloak, for we confess it.” “Medicine is a specialism; but of no\r\nnarrow kind. We have to dissect nature; which, for practice, is\r\nbetter than to abstract it.” “To clinical medicine the body becomes a\r\npathological museum. In every part we recognise certain proclivities\r\nto morbid action; and the purpose of our study is to trace these\r\ntendencies to their source on the one hand, and to their effects on\r\nthe other.” “The effects of disease may be for a third or fourth\r\ngeneration, but the laws of health are for a thousand.” “Happily,\r\nat this day, hygiene has gained strength enough to maintain an\r\nindependent position in science. To know and counteract the causes of\r\ndisease before they become effective is evidently the triumph of our\r\nart; but it will be long before mankind will be wise enough to accept\r\nthe aid we could give them in this direction. Ignorance of the laws\r\nof health, and intemperance of all kinds, are too powerful for us.\r\nStill we shall continue to wage an undying crusade; and truly we may\r\ncongratulate ourselves that no crusade ever called forth more able\r\nand devoted warriors than are thus engaged.”\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Dr. Gull delivered the Harveian Oration before the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians, and expressed himself forcibly as to the duty\r\nof preventing disease. Indeed, it is a strong article of faith with\r\nhim that at some future time the office of the physician will be\r\ngone. “I cannot doubt it is on all sides imperative on us to limit,\r\nand if possible to blot out, all diseases of whatever kind. Who would\r\nassume the responsibility of letting a preventable evil fester in\r\nsociety, on a pretence of a knowledge of the divine purposes, or\r\nunder the pretext that public morality would be thereby promoted?\r\nThe duty which lies nearest to us must ever have the first claim;\r\nand it cannot but be admitted that the nearest duty each man has to\r\nhis fellow is to save him as far as possible from all injury, even\r\nthough that injury may arise as the consequence of his own fault. Nor\r\nwill it be questioned that the cause of morality is more advanced\r\nby beneficent interference than by permitting ourselves to stand\r\npassively by whilst intemperance and vice work ruin and infect the\r\nvery fountains of life.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Gull had attained many of the highest honours of the\r\nprofession. He was one of the first graduates of London University\r\nto attain a seat on its Senate, which he continues to occupy. He was\r\nCensor of the College of Physicians in 1859-61 and in 1872-3, and\r\nCouncillor in 1863-4. Oxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L.\r\nin 1868, the Royal Society elected him to its Fellowship in 1869,\r\nCambridge followed suit with the LL.D, in 1880, and Edinburgh in\r\n1884. He was appointed a Crown Member of the General Medical Council\r\nin 1871, holding office till 1883, when he resigned. His successful\r\nattendance on the Prince of Wales in 1871, in conjunction with Sir W.\r\nJenner, became the occasion of his receiving a baronetcy in 1872, and\r\nbeing made Physician-Extraordinary to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe evidence given by Sir William Gull before the Lords’ committee\r\non intemperance, in 1877, has often been referred to as one of the\r\nmost valuable aids to temperance that a medical man has rendered. He\r\ndistinctly assigned a subordinate value to alcohol as a medicine, and\r\nexpressed his belief that its value lay chiefly in its action on the\r\nnervous system as a sedative, not as a stimulant. He further stated\r\nthat a very large number of people in society are dying, day by day,\r\npoisoned by alcohol, but not supposed to be poisoned by it. In the\r\ncase of inebriates, with most patients he would not be afraid to stop\r\nthe use of alcohol altogether. He sees no good in leaving off drink\r\nby degrees. “If you are taking poison into the blood, I do not see\r\nthe advantage of diminishing the degrees of it from day to day.... I\r\nshould say, from my experience, that alcohol is the most destructive\r\nagent that we are aware of in this country.”\r\n\r\nHis own example is powerfully instructive. “If I am fatigued with\r\noverwork, personally, my food is very simple. I eat the raisins\r\ninstead of drinking the wine.... I should join issue at once with\r\nthose people who believe that intellectual work cannot be so well\r\ndone without wine or alcohol. I should deny that proposition and hold\r\nthe very opposite.” In the life of James Hinton, by Ellice Hopkins,\r\nto which Sir William Gull has contributed a preface, we learn another\r\nsecret of a popular physician’s endurance in the record of early\r\nconstitutionals in the parks and remote suburbs, from six to eight in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, in the controversy on Vivisection, Sir William Gull, writing\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_, showed that his sympathy with the\r\nstruggles of physiologists for their science was combined with a\r\nfully answering appreciation of the value of physiological research\r\nto medicine. “Yearly in this country,” he says, “more than twenty\r\nthousand persons, children and others—mostly children—die of scarlet\r\nfever; and nearly twenty thousand more of typhoid fever; and one\r\nof the chief causes of this mortality is the high temperature of\r\nthe blood, which results from the disturbance due to the fever\r\nprocess. No wonder therefore that physiologists and physicians have\r\nanxiously and laboriously occupied themselves in investigating that\r\nmechanism of the living body which in health maintains so constant a\r\ntemperature under varying circumstances, both internal and external,\r\nand which becomes so easily and fatally deranged in disease.... The\r\nfebrile state must have arrested attention from the infancy of man.\r\nThe mothers of a palæolithic age must have watched their children\r\nconsumed to death in it, as do the mothers of to-day. The name of\r\nthis fiery state is as old as literature.... This fiery furnace,\r\nwith its uncounted millions of victims, science hopes to close.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt that physiological experiments are useful, useful\r\nfor animals as well as for man. They are therefore justifiable....\r\nNothing is so cruel as ignorance. For how many centuries had human\r\nsufferers to bear pain which is now preventable by better knowledge?\r\nHow many thousands festered to death in small-pox before the\r\ndiscovery of vaccination? How many are now dying of tubercle and\r\nscrofula whom a better knowledge of their conditions might rescue?\r\nYet the pursuit of this knowledge is hindered in England by the\r\noutcry of cruelty—the cruelty being no more than the inoculation of\r\nsome of the lower animals with tubercular and scrofulous matter, in\r\norder to study the course of the disease and the modes of prevention.\r\nThe cruelty obviously lies, not in performing these experiments, but\r\nin the hindering of progressive knowledge.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_SIR JAMES PAGET AND SURGICAL PATHOLOGY._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foremost surgical philosopher and orator of his day, Sir\r\nJAMES PAGET was called to occupy the presidential chair of the\r\nInternational Medical Congress which met in London in August 1881.\r\nThis was the culmination of a long career of scientific usefulness\r\nand successful practice. Sir James is a younger brother of Dr. G. E.\r\nPaget, Regius Professor of Medicine in the University of Cambridge,\r\nand was born at Yarmouth in Norfolk in 1814. After a course of\r\nprofessional study at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, Mr. Paget\r\nqualified as a member of the London College of Surgeons in 1836. His\r\nenergy and acuteness were soon made manifest to the authorities, and\r\nhe was selected to catalogue and describe the Pathological Museums of\r\nSt. Bartholomew and also of the College of Surgeons, in conjunction\r\nwith Mr. Stanley. These important works contributed not a little to\r\nestablish Mr. Paget’s scientific reputation.\r\n\r\nIn July 1842 Mr. Paget, while Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy at\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s, published in the _British and Foreign Medical\r\nReview_ an exhaustive report on the chief results obtained by the\r\nuse of the microscope in the study of human anatomy and physiology;\r\nit was afterwards issued separately. Being derived from the original\r\nauthorities, and full references being given, it was of great value\r\nat a critical period in the growth of the knowledge of minute\r\nanatomy. For some years Mr. Paget drew up valuable reports on the\r\nprogress of human anatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\nForty years ago Mr. Paget was already Warden of St. Bartholomew’s\r\nCollege and Lecturer on Physiology in the Hospital. At the opening\r\nof the session of 1846 he addressed the students in an eloquent and\r\npractical way on “The Motives to Industry in the Study of Medicine.”\r\nHis appeals to the highest motives were most forceful, and very\r\nindicative of the spirit which was to animate himself throughout\r\nlife. “Do not imagine,” he said, “that your responsibilities will\r\nbe limited to the events of life or death. As you visit the wards\r\nof this hospital, mark some of the hardly less portentous questions\r\nwhich, before a few years are past, you may be permitted to\r\ndetermine. In one, you will find it a doubt whether the remainder of\r\nthe patient’s life is to be spent in misery, or in ease and comfort;\r\nin another, whether he and those who depend upon his labours are\r\nto live in hopeless destitution, or in comparative abundance. One\r\nwho used to help his fellow-men finds ground to fear that he may\r\nbe a heavy burthen on their charity. Another counts the days of\r\nsickness, not more by pain and weariness, than by the sufferings and\r\nconfusion of those who are left at home without a guide, and, it may\r\nbe, starving. Oh, gentlemen! I can imagine no boldness greater than\r\nhis would be, who would neglect the study of his profession, and yet\r\nventure on the charge of interests like these; and I can imagine no\r\nambition more honourable, no envy so praiseworthy, as that which\r\nstrives to emulate the acquirements of those who are daily occupied\r\nin giving safe guidance through the perilous passages of disease, and\r\nwho, in all these various difficulties and dangers, can act with the\r\nenergy and calmness that are the just property of knowledge.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Mr. Paget published an interesting pamphlet\r\ncontaining all the records of Harvey preserved in the Journals of\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s, with notes elucidating them. Meanwhile, having\r\nbeen appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the College of\r\nSurgeons, an office which he held from 1847 till 1852, the lectures\r\nwhich he delivered being reported in the medical journals, as well\r\nas listened to with delight by large audiences, were recognised as\r\namong the most masterly modern contributions to surgical science.\r\nHis prolonged study of the pathological collections belonging to the\r\nCollege and to St. Bartholomew’s in preparing the catalogues, enabled\r\nhim to illustrate his lectures in a most interesting and valuable\r\nmanner. The lectures were collected and published in 1853, and have\r\never since occupied a similar lofty position to the lectures on\r\nmedicine by Sir Thomas Watson. They illustrate the general pathology\r\nof the principal surgical diseases, in conformity with modern\r\nadvances in physiology. In several recent editions a distinguished\r\npupil of Sir James Paget, Professor Turner of Edinburgh, has revised\r\nthe lectures from the pathological point of view, while the author\r\nhas continued to revise them in their clinical aspect.\r\n\r\nThe leading topics under which these famous lectures are comprised\r\nare: Nutrition, Hypertrophy, Atrophy, Repair, Inflammation,\r\nMortification, Specific Diseases, and Tumours. The concluding passage\r\nof the second lecture, on “The Conditions Necessary to Healthy\r\nNutrition,” is a fine exposition of a view of the relation between\r\nthe mind and a changing brain. “In all these things, as in the\r\nphenomena of symmetrical disease, we have proofs of the surpassing\r\nprecision of the formative process, a precision so exact that, as\r\nwe may say, a mark once made upon a particle of blood or tissue is\r\nnot for years effaced from its successors. And this seems to be a\r\ntruth of widest application; and I can hardly doubt that herein is\r\nthe solution of what has been made a hindrance to the reception of\r\nthe whole truth concerning the connection of an immaterial mind with\r\nthe brain. When the brain is said to be essential, as the organ or\r\ninstrument of the mind in its relations with the external world,\r\nnot only to the perception of sensations, but to the subsequent\r\nintellectual acts, and especially to the memory, of things which have\r\nbeen the objects of sense—it is asked, how can the brain be the organ\r\nof memory when you suppose its substance to be ever changing? or how\r\nis it that your assumed nutritive change of all the particles of the\r\nbrain is not as destructive of all memory and knowledge of sensuous\r\nthings as the sudden destruction by some great injury is? The answer\r\nis—because of the exactness of assimilation accomplished in the\r\nformative process; the effect once produced by an impression upon\r\nthe brain, whether in perception or in intellectual act, is fixed\r\nand there retained; because the part, be it what it may, which has\r\nbeen thereby changed, is exactly represented in the part which, in\r\nthe course of nutrition, succeeds to it. Thus, in the recollection of\r\nsensuous things, the mind refers to a brain in which are retained the\r\neffects, or rather the likenesses of changes that past impressions\r\nand intellectual acts had made. As, in some way passing far our\r\nknowledge, the mind perceived and took cognisance of the change made\r\nby the first impression of an object, acting through the sense organs\r\non the brain; so afterwards, it perceives and recognises the likeness\r\nof that change in the parts inserted in the process of nutrition.\r\n\r\n“Yet here also the tendency to revert to the former condition, or\r\nto change with advancing years, may interfere. The impress may be\r\ngradually lost or superseded, and the mind, in its own immortal\r\nnature unchanged, and immutable by anything of earth, no longer finds\r\nin the brain the traces of the past.”\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Mr. Paget gave one of the series of lectures on Education\r\nat the Royal Institution, in which Whewell, Faraday, and others\r\ntook part. His lecture on the Importance of the Study of Physiology\r\nas a branch of education for all classes, was marked by elevation\r\nof thought and practicality of aim. One interesting point that he\r\ndwelt on was that a wider scheme of education would be more likely\r\nto discover men fitted for particular work. “It has seemed like\r\na chance,” he said, “that has led nearly every one of our best\r\nphysiologists to his appropriate work; like a chance, the loss\r\nof which might have consigned him to a life of failures, in some\r\noccupation for which he had neither capacity nor love.” The value\r\nof physiological instruction is now generally admitted, but the\r\npractical application is almost as generally neglected.\r\n\r\nSir James Paget has published but too few of his thoughts to the\r\npublic and the profession; but all that have been given to the world\r\nhave been of sterling worth. His Clinical Lectures and Essays,\r\ncollected in 1875, include some of the most interesting reading\r\nimaginable. He deals among other subjects with the various risks of\r\noperations, the calamities of surgery, stammering with other organs\r\nthan those of speech, cases that bone-setters cure, dissection\r\npoisons, and constitutional diseases. Some of the most instructive\r\nof the series are those which describe forms of nervous mimicry of\r\nserious diseases. An extract from “The Calamities of Surgery” gives\r\nclear expression to Sir James Paget’s views on preparation for\r\noperating:—\r\n\r\n“Look very carefully to your apparatus. I have no doubt that you\r\nwill look very carefully to the edges of your knives and your saws\r\nand all things that are mighty to handle; but look to the plaster,\r\nlook to the ligatures and the sutures, and all the things which are\r\ncommonly called minor. When I have seen Sir William Fergusson and\r\nSir Spencer Wells operate, I have never known which to admire most;\r\nthe complete knowledge of the things to be done, the skill of hand,\r\nor the exceeding care with which all the apparatus is adjusted and\r\nprepared beforehand. The most perfect plaster, the most perfect silk,\r\nnot one trivial thing left short of the most complete perfection\r\nit is capable of. I have no doubt that the final success of their\r\noperations has been due just as much to these smaller things as to\r\nthose greater things of which they are masters.”\r\n\r\nThe lecture on Dissection Poisons was especially called forth by an\r\nillness from which he suffered for three months in 1871, caught from\r\nattending the _post mortem_ examination of a patient who had died\r\nof pyæmia. Yet he had no wound or crack of the skin of any kind. In\r\nclosing the lecture Sir James remarked: “Sir William Lawrence used\r\nto say that he had not known any one recover on whose case more than\r\nseven had been consulted. Our art has improved. I had the happiness\r\nof being attended by ten: Sir Thomas Watson, Sir George Burrows, Sir\r\nWilliam Jenner, Sir William Gull, Dr. Andrew, Dr. Gee, Mr. Cæsar\r\nHawkins, Mr. Savory, Mr. Thomas Smith, Mr. Karkeek. In this multitude\r\nof counsellors was safety. The gratitude I owe to them is more than I\r\ncan tell—more than all the evidences of my esteem can ever prove.”\r\n\r\nIn an address on Theology and Science, delivered to students at the\r\nClergy School at Leeds, in December 1880, Sir James Paget remarks\r\nthat “in theology, and in the Christian faith which it expounds,\r\nthere are not only clear evidences which, in their accumulated force,\r\ncannot, I think, be reasonably resisted by those who will fairly\r\ncollect and try them; but there are convictions of religious faith,\r\nnot always based on knowledge, or on other evidence than the faith\r\nwhich is ‘the evidence of things unseen,’ which may justly be held\r\nas unalterable, because they are consistent with revelation, and\r\nhave been sustained by the testimony of clouds of witnesses, and,\r\nI believe, have in many minds the testimony of God’s indwelling\r\nSpirit.” He expresses the belief that the truths and highest\r\nprobabilities of science and religion may justly be held together,\r\nthough on different grounds, and that they are not within reach of\r\ndirect mutual attack. He advises clerical students, if they touch\r\nupon such questions, to undertake some real study in science, by\r\nobservation, by experiment, by collecting, as well as by reading.\r\n“And let your reading be in the works of the best masters, that\r\nyou may learn their true spirit, their strength, their methods of\r\nobserving and thinking, their accuracy in describing.”\r\n\r\nSir James Paget appears as a champion of moderation in the\r\n_Contemporary_ controversy on the Alcohol Question. He says that the\r\npresumption in favour of moderation is strengthened by comparing\r\nthose of our race who do not and those who do habitually use\r\nalcoholic drinks. “As to working power, whether bodily or mental,\r\nthere can be no question that the advantage is on the side of those\r\nwho use alcoholic drinks. And it is advantage of this kind which is\r\nmost to be desired. Longevity is not the only or the best test of\r\nthe value of the things on which we live. It may be only a long old\r\nage, or a long course of years of idleness or dulness, useless alike\r\nto the individual and the race. That which is most to be desired is\r\na national power and will for good working and good thinking, and a\r\nlong duration of the period of life fittest for these; and facts show\r\nthat these are more nearly attained by the people that drink alcohol\r\nthan by those who do not.”\r\n\r\nSir James Paget holds or has held appointments too numerous to\r\nmention. After a long and honourable career as Assistant-Surgeon and\r\nSurgeon to St. Bartholomew’s, he became Consulting Surgeon. As a\r\nmember of the Council of the College of Surgeons and for some years\r\nPresident, and also as a member of the Senate, and for some years\r\nVice-Chancellor of London University, he has exercised powerful\r\ninfluence on the improvement of medical education and on medical\r\npolitics generally. He is Surgeon to the Prince of Wales and Serjeant\r\nSurgeon-Extraordinary to the Queen. A baronetcy was conferred upon\r\nhim in August 1871, and he has received honorary distinctions in\r\nabundance from both British and foreign universities.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 in his Bradshawe lecture, “On some Rare and New Diseases,”\r\nSir James Paget remarked on the increase in the number of real\r\nstudents, which he has had a large share in creating. “I have been\r\noften made happy by the contrast which I have seen while working at\r\nthe new edition of the catalogue of the pathological specimens in the\r\nCollege of Surgeons’ museum. While I was writing the last edition,\r\nbetween thirty and forty years ago, scarcely a student ever entered\r\nthe museum. Hour after hour I sat alone; I seemed to be working for\r\nno one but myself, or for nothing but the general propriety that a\r\nmuseum ought to have a catalogue, though no one might ever care to\r\nstudy with it. Now, and for some years past, a day rarely passes\r\nwithout many pupils and others being at work in every part of the\r\nmuseum.”\r\n\r\nIn the same lecture Sir James clearly showed the value of studying\r\ncases not agreeing with the ordinary types. “We should study\r\nall exceptions to rules; never thinking of them as unmeaning or\r\naccidental. Especially, we should never use, in its popular but wrong\r\ntranslation, the expression, ‘exceptio probat regulam;’ as if an\r\nexception to a rule could be evidence that the rule is right. If we\r\nuse it, let this be in its real meaning; translating it, as surgeons\r\nshould, that an exception probes the rule, tests it, searches it—as\r\nthe Bible says we should ‘prove all things’—to its very boundary.”\r\n\r\nFinally we may quote some sentences from Sir James Paget’s lecture\r\non “Elemental Pathology,” delivered before the British Medical\r\nAssociation in 1880, as expressing his philosophy of life. “I hold\r\nit to be very desirable that every one of us should, all his life\r\nlong, study some science in a scientific manner. There seems to be no\r\nequally good method for maintaining the temper and the habits, which\r\nby making us always good students, will make us as good practitioners\r\nas we can be. There is no method so good for maintaining a constant\r\nhabit of inquiry, with accuracy and perseverance in research, the\r\npower of weighing evidence, of calmly judging, and of accurately\r\nspeaking; none better for cultivating the love of truth, the\r\ncontempt for fallacies, whether others’ or our own, the gentleness\r\nand courtesy which are appropriate to the consciousness of the\r\nimperfection of our knowledge.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n_WILLIAMS, STOKES, AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this country has not enjoyed the distinction of introducing\r\nthat invaluable instrument, the stethoscope, to medical science,\r\ngreat interest naturally attaches to those who first used the\r\nstethoscope in this country. And among these the name of Charles John\r\nBlasius Williams is prominent.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WILLIAMS, the son of a clergyman of a Cardiganshire family,\r\nwas born early in the present century at Heytesbury in Wiltshire,\r\nwhere his father was perpetual curate, and custos of the Hungerford\r\nalmshouse, in which he resided. He was educated at home by his\r\nfather. His early liking for natural science and medicine may be\r\nconsidered to have come through his mother, who was the daughter of\r\na surgeon, also named Williams, at Chepstow, and had been educated\r\nby Hannah More’s sisters, and received instruction in reading from\r\nHannah More herself. Before the age of fourteen, having access to\r\nsome good books on natural philosophy, he had made for himself two\r\nelectrifying machines, a battery of Leyden jars, a voltaic pile, and\r\nseveral little telescopes, microscopes, kaleidoscopes, and æolian\r\nharps. Thomson’s Chemistry enabled him to carry on extended chemical\r\nexperiments, and to start well at Edinburgh subsequently.\r\n\r\nAstronomy, a lifelong hobby, was cultivated in the family after\r\nthe reading of Chalmers’s astronomical discourses; they bought a\r\ntelescope and did some really good observing. Active games were not\r\nlost sight of: and the young Charles excelled all his neighhours in\r\nleaping and running. Stilt-walking was a favourite pursuit; and the\r\nyouth once made a pair of stilts with a footing twelve feet from the\r\nground, mounted on which he could walk well, and look into the upper\r\nwindows of the house. Natural history tastes were further carried out\r\nin a somewhat unusual direction. Poultry and all kinds of domestic\r\nanimals were studied so minutely, and their cries imitated so\r\nclosely, that Charles could influence their behaviour towards himself\r\njust as if he had been one of themselves.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1820 Charles Williams entered at Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, attending Hope’s interesting lectures on Chemistry and\r\nthe dry prelections of Monro tertius on Anatomy, alternated with\r\nBarclay’s extra-academical class. Later he diligently attended W.\r\nP. Alison’s courses of lectures, and had much personal instruction\r\nfrom him. He had not proceeded far in his medical studies before he\r\nbecame absorbed in chemical physiology, and especially in relation\r\nto respiration and animal heat. Carefully studying all the most\r\nrecent chemical discoveries, he made new experiments showing that the\r\nchange of colour between venous and arterial blood could take place\r\nwhen the blood was enclosed in an animal membrane out of the body,\r\nand surrounded by atmospheric air. Thus in 1823 he anticipated what\r\nProfessor Graham so largely developed in relation to the general\r\npermeability of animal membranes. He further discussed the origin\r\nof animal heat, and suggested various developments of the theory of\r\ncombustion. The paper, later amplified into a thesis for graduation\r\nin 1824, attracted Alison’s high commendation, although Hope had\r\nreturned the paper with the remark that the subject was quite proper\r\nfor a young gentleman’s thesis, but that he declined to enter into\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1824-5 the young doctor heard Charles Bell’s lectures on the\r\nNervous System at the London College of Surgeons, and attended the\r\nsurgical practice of several of the London hospitals. At midsummer\r\n1825 he went to Paris, and in addition to French literature studied\r\npainting, becoming a good amateur landscape-painter both in\r\nwater-colours and oils. In the winter he attended Majendie’s lectures\r\non Physiology and the practice of Dupuytren, Laennec, and many\r\nothers. But Laennec, the great auscultator, then in his last year\r\nof life, gained his most ardent devotion. It was surprising, says\r\nDr. Williams, how little he was valued by French students. Those who\r\nattended his clinique were chiefly foreigners. M. G. Andral’s _post\r\nmortem_ examinations also he found invaluable.\r\n\r\nThe chief discoveries relating to auscultation were undoubtedly\r\nLaennec’s; yet his knowledge of acoustics was by no means profound,\r\nand he was often not successful in explaining rationally the sounds\r\nthat he heard in the chest. Dr. Williams soon started in the path\r\nof applying acoustic laws in this field, and in 1828 he produced\r\nhis valuable “Rational Exposition of the Physical Signs of Diseases\r\nof the Chest,” suggesting various improvements in the construction\r\nand use of stethoscopes. Returning to London, Dr. Williams derived\r\ngreat benefits through an introduction to Dr. (afterwards Sir James)\r\nClark, so long attached as physician to the Queen, and from the\r\nfamily acquaintance with Lord Heytesbury. His work above mentioned\r\nwas favourably reviewed, and soon made its way; and many of his\r\nexplanations are accepted to the present day. After various travels\r\nwith patients, he settled in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, in 1830,\r\nhaving married his cousin, Miss Harriett Jenkins, of Chepstow.\r\n\r\nBecoming a member of the Royal Institution, Dr. Williams was\r\nintroduced to Faraday, and was soon engaged to write for the\r\n“Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,” to which he contributed numerous\r\nvaluable articles on auscultation and diseases of the chest. In\r\nthese articles he recommended strongly the cure of catarrh by the\r\nheroic process of reducing the supply of fluid. The remedial uses of\r\ncounter-irritation were carefully expounded: and dyspnœa, difficult\r\nor distressed breathing, was clearly described.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, while practice grew but slowly, the second edition of the\r\nRational Exposition was brought out, containing an enlarged section\r\non the sounds of the heart in health and disease. For some years Dr.\r\nWilliams had considered the questions involved, and by experimental\r\ninquiries in 1835 he established that several causes to which they\r\nhad hitherto been ascribed could not be the cause of the sounds of\r\nthe heart, and that the first sound was produced by the muscular\r\ncontraction of the ventricles, and the second by the reaction of the\r\narterial blood tightening the semilunar valves. His anticipation\r\nby Rouanet in 1832 in the latter point has, however, been more\r\nrecently made evident. A third edition of his book, now of increased\r\nimportance, was published in 1835, under the title of “The Pathology\r\nand Diagnosis of Diseases of the Chest, illustrated especially by a\r\nRational Exposition of their Physical Signs.” It was reprinted in\r\nAmerica, and translated into German and Swedish. The same year he was\r\nelected F.R.S.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Dr. Williams was asked to give lectures on Diseases of the\r\nChest at the Anatomical School in Kinnerton Street, connected with\r\nSt. George’s Hospital. In 1836-7 he was president of the Harveian\r\nand the Westminster Medical Societies. In the summer of 1837 he\r\nworked to prepare for the second Report of the British Association\r\nCommittee on the sounds of the Heart, in which were brought forward\r\nimportant experimental results in regard to morbid murmurs associated\r\ntherewith. In 1835 he had shown that the true ground of distinction\r\nbetween different forms of disease of the heart’s valves lay in the\r\ndifferent direction in which the sonorous currents spread the sounds,\r\nand imparted them to the chest walls. Thus he first established the\r\ndistinction between basic and apex murmurs, developing his views more\r\nfully in 1836-7-8.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Dr. Williams was elected Professor of Medicine to University\r\nCollege, and physician to its hospital on Elliotson’s retirement.\r\nWork now crowded upon him; in the first winter session he gave 150\r\nlectures and examinations in six months, visited the hospital almost\r\nevery day, and gave a weekly clinical lecture. Up to this period\r\n_post mortem_ examinations at the hospital had been made in a mere\r\nopen shed, with a wooden shelf, scarcely screened, and without a\r\ntable or a supply of water. Dr. Williams himself planned a proper\r\n_post mortem_ theatre; and with the plan he offered £50 towards the\r\ncost,—a munificent mode of action which speedily secured the building\r\nof the required theatre. Dr. Williams’s practical teaching and\r\nluminous lectures caused the Medical School to increase still more\r\nrapidly. He had a class of over two hundred. In 1840 an experimental\r\nresearch in which Dr. Williams was assisted by Prof. Sharpey proved\r\nthe muscular contractility of the bronchial tubes, and confirmed the\r\ngreat influence of belladonna and stramonium as remedies in asthma,\r\nin suspending this contractility.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1840-1 was occupied largely with original experiments\r\non congestion, determination of blood, and inflammation, which Dr.\r\nWilliams treated of in the Gulstonian Lectures at the College of\r\nPhysicians in 1841. His results and views were, as acknowledged by\r\neminent men recently, twenty-five years in advance of his time. Both\r\nVirchow and Burdon-Sanderson have acknowledged their great value. Dr.\r\nWilliams claims that he first pointed to enlargement of the arteries\r\nleading to a part as the direct physical cause of determination\r\nof blood to that part. “When the web of a frog’s foot is gently\r\nirritated by an aromatic water, the arteries may be seen through\r\nthe microscope to become enlarged, and to supply a fuller and more\r\nimpulsive flow of blood to the capillaries and veins, which then all\r\nbecome enlarged too: the whole vascular plexus, including vessels\r\nwhich before scarcely admitted red corpuscles, then becomes the seat\r\nof a largely increased current” (_London Medical Gazette_, July 1841).\r\n\r\nThe year 1841 was marked by the first public steps taken to\r\nestablish the Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest,\r\nwhich originated with Mr. (afterwards Sir) Philip Rose. A clerk in\r\nhis firm suffering consumption found no hospital willing to admit\r\nhim, on the plea of the lingering and incurable nature of the\r\ndisease. This started the idea of a special hospital, which Dr.\r\nWilliams cordially supported, and to which he became consulting\r\nphysician. The history and great success of the Brompton Hospital\r\ncannot be followed here; in 1882 it had 331 beds. The great Virchow,\r\nwhen he visited it in 1881, said, “Here _everything_ is done for the\r\nsick.”\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Dr. Williams published the “Principles of Medicine,” a work\r\nin which physiology and pathology were largely employed to form a\r\nbasis for scientific medicine. It was received with high approval,\r\nand became a standard work in America. New editions appeared in 1848\r\nand in 1856. Sir James Paget and Sir James Simpson among others have\r\ngiven it the stamp of their marked approbation. The _Lancet_ gave it\r\nalmost unqualified praise. In 1846 the Pathological Society of London\r\nwas established, and Dr. Williams was chosen its first president.\r\nIts objects were the exhibition, description, and classification\r\nof morbid specimens, and the promotion of pathological research by\r\nsystematic observation and experiments. In his opening address, Dr.\r\nWilliams answered the sceptical question, “What is the use of opening\r\nbodies? We never find what we expected:” by describing a _post\r\nmortem_ examination of a remarkable case of pulmonary disease. The\r\nexamination had been concluded before Dr. Williams arrived, and he\r\nwas told that there was enlargement of the heart, which the physician\r\nin charge expected, and was satisfied. Dr. Williams insisted\r\non careful inspection of the lungs, which disclosed extensive\r\nconsolidation, and in addition an unexpected general dilatation of\r\nthe bronchial tubes. This was the case in which he first discovered\r\nthe connection between that change and pleuro-pneumonia. The very\r\nappropriate motto of the Society, “Nec silet mors,” was suggested by\r\nDr. Williams.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the winter session of 1849 Dr. Williams resigned his\r\nprofessorship and physiciancy, his health having severely suffered\r\nfrom overwork, and private practice increasing rapidly. He removed\r\nto Upper Brook Street, and here continued for twenty-four years in\r\nfull practice. In January 1849 Dr. Williams published his first\r\naccount in the _London Journal of Medicine_, on Cod-Liver Oil in\r\nPulmonary Consumption. He had been studying its application for\r\nthree years, but of course the priority in recommending it belongs\r\nto Dr. Hughes Bennett. It was only in 1846, when a purified oil had\r\nbeen prepared from the fresh livers of the fish, that Dr. Williams\r\nfound patients willing to take the oil, and in 1848 he wrote that\r\nhe had prescribed the oil in 400 cases of tubercular disease of the\r\nlungs, and in 206 out of 234 recorded cases its use was followed by\r\nmarked improvement. The administration of cod-liver oil is such a\r\ncommonplace of the present day that it can scarcely be realised that\r\nit is a novelty almost exclusively belonging to the present half of\r\nthe nineteenth century. And to Dr. Williams very much of the credit,\r\nand of the proof of its efficacy, is due. A lady first visited on\r\nSeptember 3, 1847, appeared at the verge of death. Cod-liver oil\r\nrestored her in a few weeks, and she lived many years after. This was\r\na sample of the experience which, after many years’ testing, led Dr.\r\nWilliams to say, in the great work on pulmonary consumption published\r\nby himself and his son, Dr. C. T. Williams, in 1871, that the average\r\nduration of life in phthisis had been at least quadrupled. Of 1000\r\ncases tabulated, 802 were still living at the last report, and many\r\nwere expected to live for years.\r\n\r\nThe New Sydenham Society, started in 1858, also found an apt first\r\npresident in Dr. Williams. Its usefulness in improving medical\r\nliterature by translations and republications has been and is very\r\ngreat. The Lumleian Lectures at the College of Physicians followed\r\nin 1862, and were entitled “Successes and Failures in Medicine.”\r\nThey were not published till 1871, when they appeared in the\r\n_Medical Times and Gazette_. Great attention was directed in them\r\nto the hopes and prospects of prevention of disease. In 1873 Dr.\r\nWilliams was elected to the Presidency of the Royal Medical and\r\nChirurgical Society, which he held for two years, though suffering\r\nfrom gradually increasing deafness. In 1874 he was appointed\r\nPhysician-Extraordinary to the Queen. In 1875 he retired to Cannes,\r\nwhere he has since renewed his earlier astronomical studies, and\r\nmade some important observations on sun spots. So in scientific\r\nrecreations, and in Biblical studies in which he has long been deeply\r\ninterested, the veteran physician whom Dr. Quain describes as “the\r\nprincipal founder of our modern school of pathology,” passes the\r\nclosing years of a protracted life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Irish Schools of Medicine have had a briefer history than those\r\nof Edinburgh and London, but have produced men whose character and\r\nlabours rank among the highest. WILLIAM STOKES, born in July 1804 in\r\nDublin, was the son of Whitley Stokes, Regius Professor of Medicine\r\nin the University, a man of lofty aims and untiring energy, and\r\na very successful teacher of medicine. Father and son alike were\r\nstudents of the Edinburgh Medical School; but the son owed much\r\nto personal companionship with his father. After a few months at\r\nGlasgow, young Stokes entered at Edinburgh early in 1823, and soon\r\ncame in contact with Dr. Alison, who exercised a profound influence\r\nupon him; “the best man I ever knew,” he declared. Such striking\r\nprogress did he make, that before he left Edinburgh, in 1825, he had\r\nwritten and published a little book on “The Use of the Stethoscope,”\r\nwhich he was fortunate enough to sell for £70.\r\n\r\nOn settling in Dublin, young though he was, Stokes was elected\r\nPhysician to the Meath Hospital, in succession to his father.\r\nHis colleague, Graves, one of the most remarkable men Dublin had\r\nproduced, exercised a striking influence over him. At twenty-two\r\nStokes was already lecturing and giving clinical instruction to a\r\ncrowd of pupils. The time was one of acute distress and poverty in\r\nIreland; fever raged in Dublin, owing to the distress caused by the\r\nfailure of the potato crop in the summer of 1826. The Meath Hospital\r\nwas crowded, and the young physician was taxed to the utmost, and his\r\nbenevolent charity became fixed as a second nature.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of activity, a powerful special object was\r\nemploying his most persistent thought and observation. He was\r\ndiligently storing his mind with every fact and inference bearing on\r\ndiseases of the lungs. In 1837 his observations were published in the\r\nclassic work on “Diseases of the Chest.” It at once placed him, says\r\nSir Henry Acland in the memoir prefixed to the edition published by\r\nthe New Sydenham Society in 1882, in the front rank of observers and\r\nthinkers. His exposition of the use of auscultation in bronchitis and\r\nthe affections of the chest was most valuable.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Stokes became Regius Professor of Physic in Dublin\r\nUniversity, in succession to his father. From this time, though he\r\ncontributed occasional papers, lectures, and cases of value to the\r\n_Dublin Journal of Medical Science_, and to the medical societies,\r\nhe published no book till 1854, when a valuable treatise on\r\nDiseases of the Heart confirmed his reputation. In this he paid\r\ngreat attention to functional disturbances of the heart, where\r\nno organic disease was present. He says with great modesty, “the\r\ndiagnosis of the combinations of diseases, even in so small an\r\norgan as the heart, is still to be worked out.... As the student\r\nfresh from the schools, and proud of his supposed superiority in\r\nthe refinements of diagnosis, advances into the stern realities of\r\npractice, he will be taught greater modesty, and a more wholesome\r\ncaution. He will find, especially in chronic disease, that important\r\nchanges may exist without corresponding physical signs—that as\r\ndisease advances its original special evidences may disappear—that\r\nthe signs of a recent and trivial affection at one portion of the\r\nheart may altogether obscure, or prevent, those of a disease longer\r\nin standing and much more important—that functional alteration may\r\nnot only cause the signs of organic lesion to vary infinitely, but\r\neven to wholly disappear—that the signs on which he has formed his\r\nopinion to-day may be wanting to-morrow; and, lastly, that to settle\r\nthe simple question between the existence of functional and that of\r\norganic disease, will occasionally baffle the powers of even the most\r\nenlightened and experienced physicians.”\r\n\r\nThis treatise is acknowledged to be one of the most acute, graphic,\r\nand complete accounts of the clinical aspects of heart disease.\r\nIn 1854 also he published a series of lectures on Fever in the\r\n_Medical Times and Gazette_, which were collected into a volume, with\r\nadditions in 1874. Here he showed himself as still sceptical of the\r\nadvances made by Jenner, Murchison, and others. As he wrote in one of\r\nthe lectures, “there is nothing more difficult than for a man who has\r\nbeen educated in a particular doctrine to free himself from it, even\r\nthough he has found it to be wrong,” and he could never free himself\r\nfrom Alison’s strong belief that fevers were essentially alike.\r\n\r\nVery early in his career Stokes was overwhelmed with private\r\npractice. On more than one occasion he spoke and wrote strongly\r\nregarding the exertions and the mortality of Irish doctors in\r\ncombating fevers and cholera, while receiving the merest pittance\r\nfrom Government for their services. His feelings as to everything\r\nrelating to the welfare of the profession and the general culture of\r\nthe student were actively displayed. “Let us emancipate the student,”\r\nhe said, “and give him time and opportunity for the cultivation of\r\nhis mind, so that in his pupilage he shall not be a puppet in the\r\nhands of others, but rather a self-relying and reflecting being. Let\r\nus ever foster the general education in preference to the special\r\ntraining, not ignoring the latter, but seeing that it be not thrust\r\nupon a mind uncultivated or degraded.”\r\n\r\nPrevention of disease, too, engaged Stokes’s earnest attention,\r\nbefore sanitary science had come into fashion. “A time may come,”\r\nhe said, in closing one of his addresses, “when the conqueror of\r\ndisease will be more honoured than the victor in a hundred fights.”\r\n\r\nSir Henry Acland says of Stokes: “The study of man was with him an\r\ninstinct, both on the material and on the intellectual side. On\r\nthe material side; for he was a physiognomist, a great judge of\r\ncharacter, and had a keen perception of all physical characteristics,\r\nqualities which he obtained by intense observation of men in\r\ndisease, of men in health, and of persons in every class of society\r\nand every kind of occupation. On the intellectual side; for the\r\nphenomena of man’s external nature were to him only expressions of\r\nthe mind working within,—mind the result of inheritance—mind formed\r\nby itself—mind the result of circumstance. The second thing to be\r\nremarked was his intense interest in every form of human character,\r\nin persons of every age, occupation, and condition. He had that which\r\nmany accomplished persons have not, the keenest sense of humour,\r\nwhich sparkled up in a way quite indescribable. He combined with\r\nreal delight in all intellectual development the most tender human\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\nStokes was passionately fond both of natural scenery and of landscape\r\nart; and he enjoyed the companionship and friendship of the best\r\nartists, and at the same time appreciated greatly the interests of\r\nhumble life and the racy humour of the Irish peasantry. He wrote\r\nsome charming descriptions of scenery, and was well acquainted with\r\nvarious schools of art. The antiquities and history of Ireland too,\r\nfound in him an accomplished and appreciative student; and it was\r\nfelt to be an appropriate tribute to his variety of taste as well\r\nas his professional skill when he was chosen President of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy in 1874.\r\n\r\nOne valuable habit Dr. Stokes ascribed to his father. “My father left\r\nme but one legacy, the blessed gift of rising early.” This often\r\nmeant getting up between four and five, when he would study and write\r\ntill eight. During a long day’s practice he was always exercising the\r\nmost genial influence, whether over refractory students or harassed\r\npatients. At the close of the day his hospitality was as attractive\r\nas his professional manner during the earlier hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Mrs. Stokes died, and from this blow her husband never fully\r\nrecovered. In 1876 he found himself compelled to withdraw from his\r\nmany public posts, and retire to his cottage at Carigbraig, where to\r\nthe last the flights of birds which he had encouraged and trained\r\ncame to seek their food at his hands. He died on January 6, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] A most entertaining account of his encounters with a game-cock\r\nis given in Dr. Williams’s “Memoirs of Life and Work,” 1885, from\r\nwhich most of these particulars are derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n_SIR HENRY THOMPSON AND CREMATION._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mode of disposing of the remains of the dead is naturally one\r\nupon which doctors may be expected to have a good deal to say. As\r\nguardians of the health of the living, the dangers and diseases\r\nwhich the material remnants of our deceased friends may occasion the\r\nliving must concern the medical profession. The increasingly dense\r\naggregation of human beings in great towns has impressed the last\r\ntwo generations with the necessity of doing something to prevent\r\ndisease from spreading through delay in burial, and the use of\r\nunsuitable burial-places. But for the most part the efforts which\r\nhave been made have only taken the form of pushing the evil a little\r\nfurther off; and a little mathematical calculation will show that the\r\npresent cemeteries must soon be surrounded by habitations, and some\r\nfresh arrangements will have to be made. To cope with these evils\r\nthe practice of cremation has been vigorously advocated, as a more\r\nrational and healthy mode of disposing of the dead, by the Cremation\r\nSociety, of which Sir HENRY THOMPSON is the President.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished surgeon is the son of Mr. Henry Thompson of\r\nFramlingham, Suffolk, having been born on August 6, 1820. It is\r\nstated that Mr. Thompson objected to his son’s studying medicine,\r\nbelieving that the profession had a sceptical tendency. Thus it was\r\nnot till he had reached the age of twenty-one, and became entitled\r\nto some property in his own right, that the subject of this chapter\r\nwas free to pursue his chosen profession. He studied chiefly at\r\nUniversity College, London, and also in Paris. He obtained the M.B.\r\ndegree at London University in 1851, and the Fellowship of the\r\nCollege of Surgeons in 1853, and in the same year was appointed\r\nassistant-surgeon at University College Hospital. In 1852 and again\r\nin 1860 he won the Jacksonian Prize at the College of Surgeons for\r\nessays on subjects to which he had devoted much of his life-work.\r\n\r\nThe two works on which Sir Henry Thompson’s reputation among the\r\nmedical profession chiefly rests are his “Clinical Lectures on\r\nDiseases of the Urinary Organs,” and his “Practical Lithotomy and\r\nLithotrity,” both of which have gone through numerous editions;\r\nbut he has also written many smaller treatises on allied subjects,\r\nand his articles in Holmes’s “System of Surgery” almost reach the\r\ndimensions of separate works. His practice has grown to large\r\ndimensions in this department, and in 1877 he was able to publish\r\na list with particulars of 500 cases in which he had performed\r\noperations for stone in the bladder, being he believed the largest\r\never published by an operator. The unrivalled extent, also, to which\r\nhe was enabled to utilise the experience of other surgeons, by their\r\ncommunication of their cases to him, made his book on lithotomy and\r\nlithotrity of unique value.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Thompson is known to have made very large use of the\r\noperation devised by Civiale of Paris, in 1817, for crushing\r\nstones into powder or gravel, rendering it unnecessary to perform\r\nthe serious operation of lithotomy. Civiale’s first operations of\r\nthis kind were performed in 1824, and to him the introduction and\r\nsuccessful application of the method is due. The operation has been\r\nlargely improved of late years, and much of this is due to Sir\r\nHenry Thompson. Owing to his well-known skill in this department\r\nof practice, he was called in to the late King of the Belgians in\r\n1863, and succeeded in affording him relief by operation, when the\r\nmost distinguished Continental surgeons had failed. The honour of\r\nknighthood was subsequently conferred upon Mr. Thompson by Queen\r\nVictoria in recognition of his great services to her uncle. About\r\nthis time Sir Henry became full surgeon to University College\r\nHospital. He has since relinquished active work at the hospital,\r\nbecoming Consulting Surgeon and Emeritus Professor.\r\n\r\nSir Henry has become known to the public in connection with several\r\nimportant social and religious questions. One which excited much\r\ncontroversy was his letter to Professor Tyndall in regard to prayer\r\nfor the sick, which appeared in the _Contemporary Review_ in 1872.\r\nAfter classifying the various objects of prayer, and considering\r\nthe possibility of testing the actual results of prayer, he says:\r\n“There appears to be one source from a study of which the absolute\r\ncalculable value of prayer (I speak with the utmost reverence) can\r\nalmost certainly be ascertained. I mean its influence in affecting\r\nthe course of a malady, or in averting the fatal termination. For\r\nit must be admitted that such an important influence manifestly\r\neither does, or does not exist. If it does, a careful investigation\r\nof diseased persons by good pathologists, working with this end\r\nseriously in view, must determine the fact. The fact determined,\r\nit is simply a matter of further careful clinical observation to\r\nestimate the extent or degree in which prayer is effective. And\r\nthe next step would be to consider how far it is practicable to\r\nextend this benefit among the sick and dying. And I can conceive few\r\ninquiries which are more pregnant with good to humanity when this\r\nstage has been arrived at.”\r\n\r\nThe practical method proposed for testing the question was that\r\na single ward or hospital, under the care of first-rate doctors,\r\ncontaining patients suffering from diseases best understood,\r\nshould be made a subject of special prayer by the whole body of\r\nthe faithful for three or five years, and that at the end of that\r\ntime the mortality should be compared with the past rates, and also\r\nwith that of other leading hospitals during the same period. But\r\nthe experiment was never tried, owing to the storm of obloquy and\r\ncontroversy with which the proposal was greeted, in which scant\r\nregard was paid to the evident good faith of the proposer.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Thompson soon came before the public in a new light. Having\r\nfailed to get people to pray systematically for the sick, he next\r\nattempted to induce them to burn their dead, a proceeding which,\r\nas it appeared, was little less shocking to many than the former\r\nproposition had proved. The first paragraph of his first article in\r\nthe _Contemporary Review_ (January 1874), since reprinted, with a\r\nsecond on the same subject, struck a sensational key.\r\n\r\n“After death! The last faint breath had been noted, and another\r\nwatched for so long, but in vain. The body lies there, pale and\r\nmotionless, except only that the jaw sinks slowly but perceptibly.\r\nThe pallor visibly increases, becomes more leaden in hue, and the\r\nprofound tranquil sleep of death reigns where just now were life and\r\nmovement. Here then begins the eternal rest.\r\n\r\n“Rest! no, not for an instant. Never was there greater activity\r\nthan at this moment exists in that still corpse. Activity, but of a\r\ndifferent kind to that which was before. Already a thousand changes\r\nhave commenced. Forces innumerable have attacked the dead. The\r\nrapidity of the vulture, with its keen scent for animal decay, is\r\nnothing to that of nature’s ceaseless agents now at full work before\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nAfter explaining the process of animal decomposition, and describing\r\nthe various modes of disposing of the dead between which it is\r\nnecessary to choose, the writer went on to insist that our present\r\nmode of burial is certainly injurious to health either now or in\r\nthe future, and constitutes in reality a social sin of no small\r\nmagnitude. A curious aspect of this question was brought to light by\r\nthe mention of the large annual importation of bones for manuring\r\nthe soil, while we bury a vast quantity of human bones annually, too\r\ndeep in the earth to be useful agriculturally. The evils of burial\r\ncustoms and expenditure were also dwelt upon, and then the new, yet\r\nold plan of cremation was advocated, practically following nature’s\r\nindication, and hastening the process so as to make it safe, without\r\nunpleasantness. It was suggested that funeral rites could be most\r\nappropriately associated with cremation. “Ashes to ashes, dust to\r\ndust” would express a literal and evident fact. The condition of many\r\nchurchyards, past and present, has given conclusive evidence that the\r\npresent mode of burial consigns moist remains to water or damp, and\r\ngenerates loathsome effluvia, too often causing severe disease in\r\nthose living near.\r\n\r\nThis subject is still one of controversy, though it has emerged into\r\n“practical politics” by reason of a decision by Mr. Justice Stephen\r\nthat cremation is not illegal under the present law. Sir Henry\r\nThompson continues his vigorous efforts in favour of cremation.\r\n\r\nSir Henry has also distinguished himself as an advocate for great\r\nmoderation and even total abstinence in the use of intoxicating\r\nliquors, stating that without them he can do his work better and with\r\nmore zest, and that his constitution has improved under abstinence.\r\nAmong his lighter works, “Food and Feeding” is pleasant and popular;\r\nwhile a still later display of varied literary tastes is seen in\r\na medical novel, “Charley Kingston’s Aunt,” published under the\r\npseudonym of Pen Oliver.\r\n\r\nThe artistic tastes and attainments of Sir Henry Thompson are\r\nwell known. He studied painting under Elmore and Alma Tadema,\r\nand has frequently exhibited at the Royal Academy. He has a very\r\nfine collection of blue and white Nankin china, of which a quarto\r\ncatalogue has been published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_GRAVES, HUGHES BENNETT, AND CLINICAL TEACHING._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjects of this chapter, both men of great influence, left a\r\ndecisive mark on the systems of clinical teaching in their respective\r\nschools of medicine, besides rendering great services to physiology\r\nand to medicine.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin University a Regius Professorship of Physic dates from the\r\ntime of the Restoration, and other chairs were subsequently founded.\r\nThe Irish College of Surgeons was established as late as 1784, but\r\nnothing great came of it for many years. A Scotchman, Cheyne, settled\r\nin Dublin, published in 1817 the first volume of the Dublin Hospital\r\nReports, and by the excellence of his own clinical reports on cases\r\nof fever, gave a good tone to the work of the Irish school. But the\r\nelevation of the Dublin Medical School to the high rank which it has\r\never since maintained was the work emphatically of Robert Graves and\r\nof William Stokes.\r\n\r\nThe Graves family, descended from a colonel in Cromwell’s cavalry,\r\nwho had acquired considerable estates in Limerick county after\r\nCromwell’s subjugation of the country, was represented at the close\r\nof the last century by the Regius Professor of Divinity in Dublin\r\nUniversity, and one of the senior Fellows of Trinity College, Richard\r\nGraves, D.D. His three sons, Richard, Hercules, and Robert obtained\r\nat the degree examinations of three successive years the gold medal\r\nin science and in classics.\r\n\r\nROBERT JAMES GRAVES, born in 1795 or 1796, after going through\r\na complete arts course, and such medical study as Dublin then\r\nafforded, graduated M.B. at Dublin in 1818. He then betook himself\r\nto other schools, and successively studied in London, in the most\r\ncelebrated Continental schools, and in Edinburgh, being away from\r\nDublin more than three years. He had an excellent language-faculty,\r\nand once, having forgotten his passport, was imprisoned for ten\r\ndays in Austria as a German spy, the authorities insisting that no\r\nEnglishman could possibly speak German as he did. During his stay in\r\nItaly, Graves, who had considerable artistic capacity, accidentally\r\nmade the acquaintance of Turner, the celebrated painter, and became\r\nhis companion on many journeys. An interesting notice of Graves’\r\nintercourse with Turner has been given by Professor Stokes.[14] It\r\nappears that the two lived and travelled together for months without\r\neither of them inquiring the name of his companion.\r\n\r\nOn a voyage from Genoa to Sicily Graves’ courage and decision were\r\nstrikingly put to the test when the captain and crew, in a terrific\r\ngale, were about to quit the ship in the only boat, leaving the two\r\npassengers to their fate. Graves, though ill, seized an axe, and\r\nstove in the boat, took command, repaired the pumps from the leather\r\nof his own boots, and saved the ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Graves returned to Dublin, and at once took a leading\r\nposition. Dr. Stokes, for a short time his pupil, and his lifelong\r\nfriend, says of him at this time: “Nature had been bountiful to\r\nhim: he was tall in stature, of dark complexion, and with noble and\r\nexpressive features. In conversation he possessed a power rarely met\r\nwith; for while he had the faculty of displaying an accurate and\r\nsingularly varied knowledge without a shade of egotism, he was able\r\nto correct error without an approach to offence. He had at once a\r\nwarm and a sensitive heart, and ever showed lasting and therefore\r\ngenuine gratitude for the smallest kindness. Loving truth for its\r\nown sake, he held in unconcealed abhorrence all attempts to sully or\r\ndistort it; and he never withheld or withdrew his friendship from\r\nany, even those below him in education and social rank, if he found\r\nin them the qualities which he loved, and which he never omitted to\r\nhonour.”\r\n\r\n“It is to be observed that as his mind was open and unsuspicious,\r\nhe occasionally fell into the error of thinking aloud without\r\nconsidering the nature of his audience, and of letting his wit play\r\nmore freely, and his sarcasm, when defending the right, cut more\r\ndeeply than caution might dictate.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1821 Graves was elected physician to the Meath\r\nHospital, and also became one of the founders of the Park Street\r\nSchool of Medicine. At this time clinical investigation and clinical\r\nteaching could scarcely be said to exist, and the pathological\r\nstudies of other schools were rather held in contempt. The methods\r\nin vogue in Edinburgh had not impressed Graves favourably. Students\r\nwere not then regularly called upon to investigate cases for\r\nthemselves, nor trained in so doing: they might obtain their degree\r\nwithout having ever practised diagnosis or co-operated in curing\r\ndisease even to the extent of writing a prescription. “Often have\r\nI regretted,” said Graves in his introductory lecture at the Meath\r\nHospital in 1821, “that, under the present system, experience is only\r\nto be acquired at a considerable expense of human life. There is,\r\nindeed, no concealing the truth—the melancholy truth, that numbers of\r\nlives are annually lost in consequence of maltreatment. The victims\r\nselected for this sacrifice at the shrine of experience, generally\r\nbelong to the poorer classes of society, and their immolation is\r\nnever long delayed when a successful candidate for a dispensary\r\ncommences the discharge of his duty. The rich, however, do not always\r\nescape; nor is the possession of wealth in every instance a safeguard\r\nagainst the blunders of inexperience.”\r\n\r\nAfter commenting on the evil effects of ignorant dogmatism in those\r\nof riper years, Dr. Graves went on to expound the plan of Continental\r\nclinical instruction. He then alluded to the coarse, harsh, and even\r\nvulgar expressions made use of towards hospital patients by Irish\r\nmedical men of the day, insisting on the necessity of reform in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe plan that Graves adopted and worked so successfully, essentially\r\nconsisted in giving to the advanced students charge over particular\r\npatients, requiring them to report upon the origin, progress, and\r\npresent state of their diseases. At the bedside these particulars\r\nwere verified or challenged by the physician; and then in the\r\nlecture-room he discussed with the class the diagnosis, prognosis,\r\nand treatment of the cases. The pupil in charge prescribed for the\r\npatient, and his prescription was revised and corrected by the\r\nphysician. The advantages of this system were obvious; students being\r\nobliged to give reasons for every plan of cure, became accustomed\r\nto a rational and careful investigation of disease, and enjoyed the\r\ngreat benefit of the early correction of their errors.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the system met with much opposition, and even ridicule.\r\nAs Stokes says, the student was then kept at a distance; no one cared\r\nto show him how to teach himself, to familiarise him with “the ways\r\nof the sick,” to train his mind to reason, and to inculcate the duty\r\nas well as the pleasure of original work.\r\n\r\nGraves had both knowledge and eloquence; his style was massive,\r\nnervous, and forcible; he could command the minds of his hearers,\r\nand he showed himself thoroughly in earnest. “His active mind\r\nwas ever on the search for analogies, and thus he was led to the\r\ndiscrimination of things apparently similar, and to the assimilation\r\nof things at the first view dissimilar, in a degree hardly surpassed\r\nby any teacher of medicine.”\r\n\r\nHaving been elected a Fellow of the King’s and Queen’s College of\r\nPhysicians, Graves was subsequently appointed Professor of the\r\nInstitutes of Medicine. In this capacity he gave lectures in which\r\nphysiology was ably applied to the wants of medical students. In\r\nthe years 1828-36 he contributed many physiological essays, chiefly\r\nto the _Dublin Journal of Medical Science_, of which he was one of\r\nthe editors till his death, on such subjects as “The Distinctive\r\nCharacters of Man,” “The Chances of Life,” “Temperament and\r\nAppetite,” “The Sense of Touch,” &c., all interesting. But it was\r\nnot till 1843 that he published the work on which his reputation as\r\nan author chiefly rests, his “Clinical Lectures on the Practice of\r\nMedicine.” In relation to this one needs no higher authority in its\r\nfavour than that of Trousseau, who addressed to the translator of the\r\nFrench edition a letter from which we make the following extracts.\r\n\r\n“I have constantly read and re-read the work of Graves; I have become\r\ninspired with it in my teaching.... The lectures on scarlatina,\r\nparalysis, pulmonary affections, cough, headache, have acquired\r\nan European reputation.... When he inculcated the necessity of\r\ngiving nourishment in long-continued pyrexias, the Dublin physician,\r\nsingle-handed, assailed an opinion which appeared to be justified\r\nby the practice of all ages, for low diet was then regarded as an\r\nindispensable condition in the treatment of fevers. Had he rendered\r\nno other service than that of completely reversing medical practice\r\nupon this point, Graves would by that act alone have acquired an\r\nindefeasible claim to our gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, I cannot sufficiently recommend the perusal\r\nof the lectures which treat of paralysis; they contain a complete\r\ndoctrine, and this doctrine has decisively triumphed. The sympathetic\r\nparalyses of Whytt and Prochaska have now their place assigned in\r\nscience, under the much more physiological name of reflex paralyses.”\r\n\r\n“Graves is a therapeutist full of resources.... There is not a day\r\nthat I do not in my practice employ some of the modes of treatment\r\nwhich Graves excels in describing with the minuteness of the true\r\npractitioner, and not a day that I do not, from the bottom of my\r\nheart, thank the Dublin physician for the information he has given\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Graves is in my acceptation of the term a perfect clinical teacher.\r\nAn attentive observer, a profound philosopher, an ingenious artist,\r\nan able therapeutist, he commends to our admiration the art whose\r\ndomain he enlarges, and the practice of which he renders more useful\r\nand more fertile.”\r\n\r\nIn 1843 and 1844 Graves was President of the Irish College of\r\nPhysicians, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849. He\r\nwas led by his experience to hold strongly the belief that typhus and\r\ntyphoid were not distinct fevers. His great service to the treatment\r\nof fevers is however independent of this. He recognised the ill\r\neffects of a lowering system upon fever patients, and steadily set\r\nhimself to maintain the patient’s strength by food and stimulants.\r\nOne day he was going round the hospital, when on entering the\r\nconvalescent ward he began to expatiate on the healthy appearance of\r\nsome who had recovered from severe typhus. “This is all the effect\r\nof our good feeding,” he exclaimed; “and lest, when I am gone, you\r\nmay be at a loss for an epitaph for me, let me give you one, in three\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n  “HE FED FEVERS.”\r\n\r\nGraves’s papers on Cholera embodied in his Clinical Lectures give\r\nan able history of the progress of that disease, and his researches\r\nled him to urge the foundation of a complete network of medical\r\nobservatories to record especially the rise, progress, and character\r\nof disease, whether endemic or epidemic. Had he lived he might have\r\ndone much to promote this object, only now and partially being\r\nattempted in the collective scheme for the investigation of disease\r\nunder the auspices of the International Scientific Congress. But his\r\nlabours shortened his life. He constantly corresponded with pupils\r\nall over the world; wrote much for periodical literature on subjects\r\noutside medicine, even doing the literary work of a patient whose\r\nfamily were in straitened circumstances. A disease of the liver\r\nfinally cut him off, after a protracted illness borne with Christian\r\nfortitude and faith, on March 20, 1853.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving been a leading teacher at Edinburgh for many years, JOHN\r\nHUGHES BENNETT impressed his individuality upon a larger number of\r\nstudents, and has been more generally recognised than Graves as a\r\nman of conspicuous merit. As a clinical teacher, as a physiologist,\r\nas a pathologist, as a therapeutist, he had high claims. He reformed\r\nthe treatment both of pneumonia and of phthisis, and identified\r\na disease, leucocythæmia, whose characters have proved the\r\nstarting-point for most fruitful investigations.\r\n\r\nBennett was born in London on August 31, 1812, and educated at the\r\nGrammar and Mount Radford Schools, Exeter. He was fortunate in having\r\na cultivated mother, a lady of independent thought and spirit, and\r\nto her he owed the development of his marked literary and artistic\r\ntastes. As a boy she trained him in elocution, in which he afterwards\r\nexcelled, and widened his thoughts by taking him again and again to\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\nDeciding to study medicine, young Bennett was apprenticed to a\r\nMr. Sedgwick of Maidstone, and for a short time attended St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital. A little later, however, he decided to\r\nenter at Edinburgh University, and soon showed himself an assiduous\r\nstudent. He made the acquaintance of Edward Forbes, J. H. Balfour,\r\nJohn Reid, and others, who afterwards distinguished themselves,\r\nand became one of the Presidents of the Royal Medical Society. In\r\n1837 he took the M.D. degree, being awarded a gold medal, on Syme’s\r\nrecommendation, for the best surgical report, and being mentioned as\r\nworthy of a second medal by Sir Charles Bell.\r\n\r\nBennett next studied for two years in Paris, founding the Parisian\r\nMedical Society, of which he was the first president. Other two years\r\nhe devoted to study in German medical schools. The microscope and the\r\nstethoscope became in his hands familiar implements of research, and\r\nhe already began to give forth the results of his study, contributing\r\nto Tweedie’s “Library of Medicine” a large proportion of the second\r\nvolume dealing with diseases of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nBennett returned to Edinburgh in 1841, and on the 1st October\r\npublished “Treatise on the Oleum Jecoris Aselli, or Cod-liver Oil,\r\nas a Therapeutic Agent in certain Forms of Gout, Rheumatism, and\r\nScrofula, with Cases.” His knowledge of this remedy had been acquired\r\nin Germany, where cod-liver oil was being used in the treatment\r\nof these diseases. Its use had however long been known among the\r\nScotch fishing folk, and Drs. Kay and Bardsley had many years\r\nbefore prescribed it in the Manchester Infirmary. The publication,\r\nhowever, stagnated, and there was added in 1847 to the remaining\r\ncopies an appendix of cases benefited by cod-liver oil. By this time\r\nits administration was decidedly on the increase, and one firm of\r\ndruggists in Edinburgh had sold six hundred gallons in the preceding\r\nyear, as compared with one gallon in 1841. At the same time Dr. C. J.\r\nB. Williams was introducing purer forms of the oil in London, as we\r\nhave already related, and by his writings and practice and study of\r\ncases of pulmonary consumption did very much to promote its general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIn November 1841 Bennett started a course of lectures on histology\r\nat Edinburgh, in which he illustrated physiology and pathology by\r\nmicroscopical preparations: he also formed classes for private\r\ninstruction in microscopical manipulation. At that time minute\r\nchanges in structure were generally overlooked, and to Bennett\r\nbelongs the credit of first giving such instruction in a systematic\r\nform. He strongly desired to gain the chair of General Pathology at\r\nEdinburgh, which was vacant in 1842, but he was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWhen he was soon afterwards appointed physician to the Royal\r\nDispensary, Bennett had an opportunity of putting into practice\r\nwhat he had learnt in Germany, by establishing what he called a\r\npolyclinical course, his students being taught practically, under\r\nthe eye of the teacher, to examine and prescribe for patients. It\r\nmust not be forgotten, however, that Syme had previously introduced\r\na somewhat similar procedure at his Minto House (Surgical)\r\nHospital. As Pathologist to the Royal Infirmary, Bennett had great\r\nopportunities of studying morbid specimens, and he got together a\r\nlarge pathological collection. He further gave courses of lectures on\r\npathology.\r\n\r\nFor many years Bennett took a large part in maintaining the literary\r\nactivity of the Edinburgh School. Many papers by him appeared in the\r\n_London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science_, of which\r\nhe subsequently was part and sole proprietor two or three times,\r\nbeing so lucky as to make a profit on each of his transactions.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Dr. Bennett was unanimously elected Professor of the\r\nInstitutes of Medicine (_i.e._, Physiology) at Edinburgh. In this new\r\nwork he was soon conspicuous for the practicality of his teaching,\r\nand for his continual introduction of matters bearing on pathology\r\nand medicine. He made every lecture a complete study, enriching\r\nit with all the appliances, material and artistic, that he could\r\ncommand, and embellishing it by finished elocution. He would now\r\nand again lay aside his manuscript to comment upon, and frequently\r\nto denounce, the opinions of others, by which course he made\r\nenemies, for he was not sufficiently measured in his treatment of\r\nopponents. Yet it might safely be said that he was not actuated by\r\npersonal hostility, but only by antagonism of view. Still he was too\r\nfavourable to his own work, and did not adequately appreciate other\r\nmen. The general student enjoyed those peculiarities of Dr. Bennett\r\nof which he did not himself feel the brunt, but in the clinical\r\nclass or in the examination hall his unsparing logical acumen tasked\r\nthe student mind somewhat severely, and he was a generally dreaded\r\nexaminer.\r\n\r\nFrom the peculiar organisation of Edinburgh work Bennett was expected\r\nto be a clinical teacher of medicine as well as a professor of\r\nphysiology; thus the importance of his work in the infirmary was as\r\ngreat as that in the lecture-room. He was a clinical teacher of the\r\nhighest order—nothing was suffered to pass unnoticed. All methods\r\nof inquiry into the patient’s case were diligently taught to the\r\nstudents, who were led to observe precisely and methodically for\r\nthemselves. He would test and stimulate his pupils[15] most acutely\r\nby disputation, questioning, and argument; and he thus trained a body\r\nof men who carry his impress into all their work.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Dr. Bennett published a case of “Hypertrophy of the\r\nSpleen and Liver,” which is the first recorded case of a disease\r\ncharacterised by a great abundance of white corpuscles in the blood,\r\nnow known as leucocythæmia. Although Bennett did not at first\r\nrecognise its true nature, his description and subsequent labours\r\ndid much to elucidate the disease, and his name must be honourably\r\nassociated with the subject.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the greatest service Bennett rendered to medicine,\r\nindependently of his promotion of the use of cod-liver oil in\r\nphthisis, is his strong protest against the lowering treatment in\r\npneumonia and other inflammatory diseases. On this point the _Lancet_\r\n(October 9, 1875) says: “He reduced the mortality of uncomplicated\r\npneumonia to _nil_. He demonstrated, not only the dispensableness,\r\nbut the injuriousness, of the antiphlogistic treatment which had\r\nruled the best minds of the civilised world for ages. Doubtless other\r\nphysicians were working in the same direction even before Bennett,\r\nbut he devised a treatment of his own which has given most brilliant\r\nresults, and he adhered to it and to the pathological views on which\r\nit was based so steadily and over so long a series of years as to\r\nestablish its truth, and so largely revolutionise the practice of\r\nmedicine in acute diseases.” Dr. Bennett’s later attacks on the\r\nmercurial treatment of liver diseases were almost equally strong with\r\nthat on bleeding and the antiphlogistic methods, but being undertaken\r\nlate in life did not leave such an impression.\r\n\r\nDr. M’Kendrick gives in the _British Medical Journal_, October 9,\r\n1875, a list of no fewer than 105 papers and memoirs by Bennett.\r\nAmong his larger works were “An Introduction to Clinical Medicine;”\r\n“Lectures on Clinical Medicine,” 1850-6, which were entitled in\r\nlater editions “Clinical Lectures on the Principles and Practice\r\nof Medicine.” Of this his principal work, six editions were\r\npublished during his lifetime in the United States, and the book\r\nhas been translated into French, Russian, and Hindoo. “Outlines\r\nof Physiology” appeared in 1858, and a Text-book of Physiology in\r\n1871-2. His works on Cancerous and Cancroid Growths, on the Pathology\r\nand Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and on the Restorative\r\nTreatment of Pneumonia, will of course be consulted as containing\r\nauthoritative statements of his views on these important subjects.\r\nHe wrote the article on Phthisis in Reynolds’ “System of Medicine,”\r\nReports on the Action of Mercury on the Liver, and Researches on\r\nthe Antagonism of Medicines, as reports to the British Medical\r\nAssociation, 1867-1875.\r\n\r\nDr. M’Kendrick, some time Bennett’s assistant and deputy, says of\r\nhim:[16] “Professor Bennett was a man of clear and logical intellect.\r\nWhat he wanted in breadth of view he gained in penetrative power. Few\r\ncould grasp more quickly the essentials of a subject, or perceive\r\nsooner or more accurately the real point at issue. _Method_ was the\r\nprevailing quality of his mind which guided him as a teacher....\r\nHe wanted patience with details, the power of positive scientific\r\nexpression, and the faculty of taking a wide view of all the facts\r\nbearing on what was immediately under discussion. He assumed an\r\nattitude of scepticism to all questions until fairly convinced.”\r\n\r\n“His tendency to indulge freely in critical and sarcastic remarks\r\nupon the works of others did not make him a general favourite with\r\nsome of his professional brethren, consequently he never attained\r\na large practice as a consulting physician, which was from other\r\nconsiderations his due. He was too much a reformer, too pronounced\r\nand outspoken in his opinions; he had too much identified himself\r\nwith certain lines of thought; and it must be confessed that he did\r\nnot possess that indefinable manner which inspires confidence both in\r\npatient and in practitioner alike.”\r\n\r\n“By those who knew him best Dr. Bennett was much beloved. He shone\r\nin the social circle, where his love of music and power of brilliant\r\nconversation cast a radiance through the room.”\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Bennett unsuccessfully competed for the chair of the Practice\r\nof Physic at Edinburgh, and he felt his non-success very much. For\r\nthe next ten years he continued in active work, but in 1865 began\r\nto suffer severely from a bronchial and throat affection. Later he\r\nwas attacked by diabetes, and had to spend several winters on the\r\nContinent. In 1874 he resigned his professorship. In August 1875 he\r\nwas gratified by receiving from Edinburgh the LL.D. degree, his bust\r\nby Brodie being presented to the University by former pupils. He\r\nwas operated on for stone in September following at Norwich, by Mr.\r\nCadge, and died on September 25th, being buried at Dean Cemetery,\r\nEdinburgh, by the side of his friends, Goodsir and Edward Forbes. His\r\nwife, son, and four daughters survived him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Biographical Notice, prefixed to Graves’ “Studies in Physiology\r\nand Medicine,” 1863.\r\n\r\n[15] _Edinburgh Medical Journal_, October 1, 1845.\r\n\r\n[16] _Edinburgh Medical Journal_, November 1875, p. 473.

Yet the simple discontinuance of the system of\r\nrestraint practised from time immemorial on almost all lunatics was\r\nperhaps a greater practical revolution than the biological one just\r\nreferred to; and England stands in the forefront of this revolution.\r\n\r\nThe old lunatic asylums of this country were objects of dread and\r\nrepulsion. Severity was considered to be an absolute necessity in\r\ntheir management. “The affrighted visitors,” says Conolly,[17]\r\n“saw that many were furious ... and it never occurred to them that\r\nhabitual severity was the real cause of the habitual fury.” New\r\nBethlem in Moorfields two centuries ago was a place of chains,\r\nmanacles, and stocks. Down to 1770 the inmates were exhibited to the\r\npublic at a charge of twopence, afterwards reduced to one penny.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession had become accustomed to neglect mental\r\ndiseases, and to acquiesce in severe treatment. Cruelty became\r\ndeveloped in ingenious forms. In some Continental asylums patients\r\nwere terrified by the gradual ascent of water in a well in which\r\nthey were chained. Machines were imagined by which a newly arrived\r\nlunatic could suddenly be raised to the top of a tower, and as\r\nsuddenly lowered into a deep dark cavern; “if the patient could be\r\nmade to alight among snakes and serpents, it would be better still.”\r\nA revolving chair was invented, in which the victim could be strapped\r\nand made to gyrate at the rate of one hundred revolutions per minute.\r\nThis was eulogised as a potent means of quieting the unmanageable,\r\nand was supposed to induce the melancholy to take “a natural interest\r\nin the affairs of life.” We can only make this passing allusion to\r\nthe way in which ingenuity was exhausted in devising methods of\r\nrestraint and torture.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been worse than the condition of the Bicêtre and\r\nthe Salpêtrière, the two large asylums of Paris, when Pinel was in\r\n1793 appointed to the former by Cousin, Thouret, and Cabanis, then\r\nnewly appointed administrators of the Parisian hospitals. Damp,\r\ndark cells, infested by rats, contained dirt-coated beings whose\r\nonly comfort was a little straw, chained, brutally ill-treated,\r\nand attended by brutal criminals. For nearly ten years previously\r\nPinel’s attention had been directed to the treatment of the insane,\r\nand now, in spite of difficulties which officials threw in his way,\r\nhe succeeded in loosening the chains and ameliorating the treatment\r\nof the majority of the patients. Yet his reforms nearly cost him\r\nhis life. Rumours were spread accusing him of some evil motive in\r\nunchaining dangerous lunatics, and a mob one day seized him, and\r\nuttered the well-known terrible cry “_à la lanterne!_” An old soldier\r\nof the French Guard, once a lunatic, whom he had released from\r\nchains, cured, and employed in his own service, was appropriately the\r\nmeans of his rescue. Thus was philanthropy once more justified of her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAt this very period English public opinion had been excited by\r\nrevelations of cruelty and consequent deaths in the old York Asylum.\r\nIn 1791 a lady belonging to the Society of Friends was placed in\r\nthis asylum; her friends were refused admission to visit her, and in\r\na few weeks she died. Inquiries that were made showed great grounds\r\nfor suspicion, although full details could not be obtained.[18] But\r\nwith great promptitude William Tuke, a prominent Friend at York,\r\nwhose family has continued famous for attention to the affairs of the\r\ninsane, proposed early in 1792 the establishment of a “Retreat” at\r\nYork for insane patients, in which sympathy should be substituted\r\nfor unkindness, severity, and stripes. The account given by Samuel\r\nTuke in 1813 of its management is still a model in many respects.[19]\r\n\r\nNeither Pinel nor the Tukes were however bold enough entirely to\r\ndispense with mechanical coercion. In 1818 Esquirol, the true\r\nsuccessor of Pinel in France, found maltreatment still generally\r\nprevalent in the provincial asylums of France. In England mechanical\r\nrestraint continued to be largely employed till Conolly’s time,\r\nand survives in some private asylums to the present day. We cannot\r\ngive further details on this head, but hasten to mention the names\r\nof two men, Dr. Charlesworth and Mr. Gardiner Hill, who must ever\r\nbe remembered as the first to give up mechanical coercion entirely\r\nin the small asylum of Lincoln. Dr. Charlesworth, physician to\r\nthe asylum, had for many years diligently watched the effects of\r\nmechanical coercion, and gradually lessened the number of instruments\r\nof restraint in the asylum. Finally, the total disuse of mechanical\r\nrestraints was decided on, and put in practice by Mr. Gardiner Hill\r\nin 1836 in concert with Dr. Charlesworth, with the most gratifying\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the man who more than any other in England may be\r\nsaid to have established the non-restraint system so firmly that\r\nit will never be upset. JOHN CONOLLY was born at Market Rasen in\r\nLincolnshire, in 1794. His father, a member of a good Irish family,\r\ndied young, and the care of a young family fell on his widow, whose\r\nmaiden name was Tennyson, and whose patience and self-sacrifice\r\nher son ever affectionately acknowledged as the main influence\r\nwhich led to his own success. When his mother ultimately married a\r\nFrench gentleman, a political emigré, the latter taught his stepson\r\nFrench, and imbued him with a genuine taste for and knowledge of\r\nthe language. Condillac’s essay “On the Origin of Human Knowledge”\r\ninfluenced his mental life. While in his teens his attention was\r\nfirst called to the subject of lunacy by an inspection of the Glasgow\r\nAsylum, and he never afterwards ceased to take the deepest interest\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen young Conolly became an officer in a militia regiment,\r\nin which capacity he served several years. While still young, he\r\nmarried in 1816 the daughter of Sir John Collins and went to reside\r\nin France, on the banks of the Loire. A year later he had decided\r\nto enter the medical profession, and in 1817 became a student at\r\nEdinburgh University. After a diligent career, in the course of\r\nwhich he was one of the presidents of the Royal Medical Society, he\r\ngraduated M.D., and settled in practice as a physician at Chichester.\r\nHere he became intimately acquainted with Dr. (afterwards Sir John)\r\nForbes, with whom he was afterwards much connected in literary\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly did not remain very long at Chichester, but removed in\r\n1823 to Stratford-on-Avon, where he wrote many contributions to and\r\ntook part in editing the “Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,” and the\r\n_British and Foreign Medical Review_. At Stratford he became alderman\r\nand mayor, established a public dispensary, and studied Shakespeare\r\nwith enthusiasm. This occasioned him afterwards, while practising at\r\nWarwick in 1835, to take an active part as chairman of the committee\r\nformed for securing the preservation of Shakespeare’s tomb, and the\r\nrestoration of the chancel of the church.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Dr. Conolly was appointed Professor of the Practice of\r\nMedicine in London University, which appointment he only held four\r\nyears, finding life as a London physician unsuitable to his tastes.\r\nIn 1831 he again resorted to the country, establishing himself in\r\nWarwick.\r\n\r\nThe subject of insanity had long engaged Dr. Conolly’s attention. He\r\nhad studied the question both abroad and at home, and had been for\r\nfive years, (while residing at Stratford) inspecting physician to the\r\nLunatic Houses for the County of Warwick, an office which he resumed\r\nwhen he settled in Warwick. He had unsuccessfully proposed to the\r\ncouncil of the University that he should give his pupils clinical\r\ninstruction on insanity in one of the lunatic asylums in London.\r\n“Thus,” says Sir James Clark,[20] “clinical instruction in mental\r\ndiseases was thrown back for thirty years in this country.”\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Conolly published his valuable work, “An Inquiry concerning\r\nthe Indications of Insanity, with Suggestions for the better\r\nProtection and Care of the Insane.” His objects were to render\r\nthe recognition of insanity less difficult, by showing in what it\r\ndiffered from those varieties of mind which approached nearest to it;\r\nand to point out those circumstances which, even in persons decidedly\r\ninsane, could alone justify various degrees of restraint. He lamented\r\nthat during a student’s career he only saw cases of insanity by\r\nsome rare accident. Every lunatic asylum was closed to him, and\r\nyet when qualified he might any day have to decide on a patient’s\r\ninsanity. In view of some recent revelations a quotation from the\r\nintroduction to this work (p. 3) is not inappropriate. “The timidity\r\nor ignorance, or it may be, a dishonest motive, of relatives, leads\r\nto exaggerated representations; and the great profit accruing from\r\na part of practice almost separated from general medicine, cannot\r\nbut now and then operate against proper caution in admitting such\r\nrepresentations. When men’s interests depend upon an opinion, it is\r\ntoo much to expect that opinion always to be cautiously formed, or\r\neven in all cases honestly given. The most respectable practitioners\r\nin this department openly justify the authorising of restraint before\r\nthe patient is seen, and on the mere report of others; and it seems\r\nthat depositions to the insanity of individuals have been received\r\nin courts of law, concerning persons with whom the deponents have\r\nnever had an interview; and that on these depositions proceedings\r\nhave been partly founded, of which the results were the imprisonment\r\nof lunatics, and restraint over their property. When the affair is\r\nconducted with more formality, and the suspected person is visited\r\nbefore being imprisoned, those who visit him are often very little\r\nacquainted with mental disorders, and come rather to find proofs of\r\nhis insanity, which, to minds pre-possessed, are seldom wanting, than\r\ncautiously to examine the state of his mind.”\r\n\r\n“If a person of sound mind were so visited, and knew of the visit\r\nbeforehand, it would not be quite easy for him to comport himself,\r\nso as to avoid _conviction_ that he was _not_ of sound mind. His\r\nindignation would pass for raving; his moderation for the proverbial\r\ncunning of a lunatic.”\r\n\r\nAfter describing the condition of asylums and lunatics at that time,\r\nthe author considers the constitution of the human understanding and\r\nthe inequalities, weaknesses, and peculiarities of mind which do not\r\namount to understanding, and the influence of stimuli, of age, and\r\nof disease on the mind, and then discusses the phenomena of insanity\r\nand the questions of treatment and protection. He insists on the\r\nnecessity of the most scrutinising watchfulness over the servants\r\nemployed in their care. In cases where patients would do themselves\r\nor others an injury he insists on watching, instead of mechanical\r\nmeans of restraint. He proposes a complete scheme for the care of all\r\nlunatics by the State, providing for perfect publicity of procedure.\r\nHe finally points out the increasing liability of the nervous system\r\nto disorganisation owing to the increased pressure and more varied\r\nanxieties of modern life, an observation most fully justified by what\r\nhas been established since his day.\r\n\r\nThis work, a most readable and interesting one, both to medical men\r\nand to general readers, was not received with nearly sufficient\r\nwarmth. Too many were wedded to the old systems of treatment; too\r\nmany knew nothing about the diseases of the mind, and their sympathy\r\ncould not be aroused in favour of lunatics. So Conolly was left\r\nto his country work at Warwick, varied by one year’s residence at\r\nBirmingham, till 1839, when he was appointed Resident Physician to\r\nthe Middlesex County Asylum at Hanwell, at that time the largest in\r\nEngland. He had taken the opportunity of visiting the Lincoln Asylum\r\nand gaining all the advantages possible from its experience. He was\r\nnow satisfied that mechanical restraint was not only unnecessary, but\r\npossibly injurious. On few others had the non-restraint system gained\r\na hold. Hanwell had the reputation of being one of the best-managed\r\nasylums in England, many patients being occupied in agricultural and\r\nother pursuits. Yet one year after Sir William Ellis’s resignation,\r\nwhen Conolly took office, “instruments of mechanical restraint of\r\none kind or other were so abundant in the wards as to amount, when\r\ncollected together, to about six hundred, about half of them being\r\nhandcuffs and leg-locks.”\r\n\r\nConolly entered upon his duties on the 1st June 1839. The asylum\r\nthen contained 800 patients, and he found forty under continuous\r\nmechanical restraint. In his first report to the Quarter Sessions,\r\nhe informed the Justices that since the 21st of September not one\r\npatient had been under restraint. “No form of strait waistcoat, no\r\nhandcuffs, no leg-locks, nor any contrivance confining the trunk, or\r\nlimbs, or any of the muscles, is now in use. The coercion chairs,\r\nabout forty in number, have been altogether removed from the wards.”\r\nIn fact, they had been cut up to make a floor for the carpenter’s\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThis was not accomplished without some trouble and anxiety. It took\r\ntime to indoctrinate the officers and attendants with the principles\r\nof the new system, in which they were deprived of their old prop. The\r\naid which he received from Miss Powell the matron was most valuable.\r\nIn ten years not one case was admitted to Hanwell in which mechanical\r\nrestraint was deemed necessary, although many suicidal patients were\r\namong them. In fact, the removal of restraint tended directly and\r\npowerfully to promote the recovery of these, by taking away the sense\r\nof degradation occasioned by such restraint, by bringing them within\r\nthe sphere of medical remedial agents and of cheerful influences. The\r\nonly substitutes allowed were in some cases seclusion of a patient in\r\nan ordinary sleeping apartment, and, in extreme cases, in a padded\r\nroom in which the floor was a bed; such seclusion being immediately\r\nreported to the medical officers, and recorded, even when continued\r\nonly for a few minutes. This was found sufficient to protect the\r\nother patients, to calm the refractory one, and act as a tonic and\r\nremedial influence. The shower-bath was rarely resorted to except\r\nfor medical reasons; window-guards, clothing, and bedding of strong\r\nmaterials to prevent tearing, were only required in a few cases. “The\r\ngreat and only real substitute for restraint is invariable kindness,”\r\nsays Dr. Conolly. “This feeling must animate every person employed in\r\nevery duty to be performed.”\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly published the main results of his experience in his\r\nClinical Lectures in the _Lancet_ in 1846, and in a work on the\r\nConstruction and Government of Asylums, in 1847. His annual reports\r\nto the Justices detailed the progress of his system, and he\r\nafterwards summarised them and published them collectively. At the\r\nend of ten years, finding the non-restraint system in no danger\r\nof being abandoned at Hanwell, Dr. Conolly ceased to be resident\r\nphysician, and became visiting physician, attending at the asylum\r\ntwice a week, and spending the greater portion of the day there. His\r\ninterest in the patients, says Dr. Hitchman, seemed never to flag.\r\nHe would always look out for something to commend in a patient, the\r\nhair better kept, clothes more neatly worn, &c., and addressing the\r\npatients in the most gentle, affectionate tones, he made his visits\r\nalways a matter of longing. The old attendants at the hospital in\r\nafter years spoke of Dr. Conolly’s untiring watchfulness in the first\r\nyears of his experiment. He would visit the wards at all hours of the\r\nnight to see that his orders were being obeyed, walking noiselessly\r\nalong the corridors. He was kept up in his arduous duties by an\r\nelevated religious principle. “I feel grateful to God,” he wrote,\r\n“who has intrusted duties to me which angels might stoop to perform.”\r\nHe suffered greatly from an affection of the skin, which kept him\r\nawake at night and ill at ease during the day; and hence was liable\r\nto fits of depression and irritability which sometimes made him\r\nappear impatient.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, on his resignation of the appointment of visiting physician,\r\nConolly’s connection with Hanwell practically ceased, and a piece\r\nof plate and his own portrait by Sir W. Gordon were presented to\r\nhim at a public meeting by Lord Shaftesbury. In his reply on this\r\noccasion Dr. Conolly said: “Those who know me well will believe me\r\nwhen I say there never was an occasion when the sense of merit was\r\nless reflected from the breast of the recipient of a public honour,\r\nthan it is from me at this moment.” He further stated that when he\r\nhad first heard of the establishment of Hanwell Asylum, he was seized\r\nwith a restless desire to become one day its head.\r\n\r\nMany objects of philanthropy had Dr. Conolly’s untiring advocacy,\r\nboth before and after his retirement from Hanwell. Public\r\nmiddle-class lunatic asylums, the education of medical men in mental\r\ndiseases, the establishment of idiot asylums, especially that at\r\nEarlswood, were among these. He was the first doctor applied to\r\nby Mrs. Plumbe in regard to the foundation of Earlswood, and his\r\nco-operation with Dr. Andrew Reed was of the most essential service\r\nto the enterprise.\r\n\r\nDr. Langdon Down, formerly Medical Superintendent at Earlswood, wrote\r\nin regard to Conolly: “His visits were the most refreshing incident\r\nof my recollection in connection with the asylum. Entering on my\r\nwork (in 1858) as an untried man, and finding myself allied to an\r\ninstitution which had become unpopular at the Lunacy Board, I was\r\nmainly decided on holding a position which had so much to overwhelm\r\none by the influence of Dr. Conolly. That influence was magical. The\r\nhumility of his character was only equalled by the real love he\r\nmanifested for the mentally afflicted.\r\n\r\n“At the visits of the Board of Management, he would steal away from\r\nhis colleagues, and was to be found holding loving intercourse\r\nwith the little members of my charge in a way that one has never\r\nseen before or since. Moreover, he so encouraged every official\r\nin his or her work, that the savour of his visit lasted till\r\nhe again returned.... For myself, I have often had to seek his\r\ncounsel, and never without being struck with his judgment and the\r\nfascination of his influence, the high resolve he inspired in one,\r\nand what willingness he exhibited to maintain, co-equally with the\r\nresponsibility, the power of the Medical Superintendent, and thus\r\nto prevent a repetition of those evils which he had so bitterly to\r\nlament in his own experience.”\r\n\r\nThe years after Conolly left Hanwell were busily occupied with a\r\nlarge practice, especially in mental cases. In a few years his\r\nunceasing labour told on him, and he suffered much from chronic\r\nrheumatism and neuralgia. Finally he was compelled to retire from\r\npractice, when he took up his residence at Lawn House, Hanwell,\r\nwhence he could see the asylum in which he had spent so many\r\nanxious hours. He finally lost mental energy, and was unable to\r\ncomplete several treatises and records of experience which he\r\nwas contemplating. He, however, left an enduring memorial of his\r\nlife-work in “The Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical\r\nRestraints,” 1856, written in a most readable style. We must not\r\nomit to mention his courses of lectures on Insanity at the College\r\nof Physicians and at the Royal Institution, his papers on Infantile\r\nInsanity, and finally “A Study of Hamlet,” in which he brings the\r\nmost skilfully marshalled arguments to prove that Hamlet’s was a\r\nreal and not a feigned madness. As to Hamlet’s treatment of Ophelia\r\nin Act II., Scene 1, and more especially in the scene where Hamlet\r\nand Laertes met over her grave, he remarked; “The picture of madness\r\nhere is too minutely true, its lights and shades are too close to\r\nnature to have been painted as a mere illustration of feigning,\r\nand of feigning without intelligible purpose.” Both Sir Theodore\r\nand Lady Martin (Miss Helen Faucit) considered his exposition most\r\nsatisfactory, and that it settled the question finally.\r\n\r\nConolly was carried off, after years of weakness, by an attack of\r\nparalysis with convulsions, which was fatal in a few hours, on March\r\n5, 1867. Few have left behind them a brighter record as physician and\r\nphilanthropist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImprovement in the treatment of the insane and the knowledge of\r\nmental diseases has progressed rapidly in late years, owing to the\r\nefforts and studies of many workers, among whom Drs. Bucknill,\r\nTuke, Hood, Lockhart Robinson, and Forbes Winslow are conspicuous.\r\nThe record of their work would lead us into too wide a field.\r\nBut the life-work of one of the sons-in-law of Dr. Conolly, HENRY\r\nMAUDSLEY, is of a character which for good or ill has exerted, and is\r\nexerting, a powerful influence on younger minds. We come here into\r\na region of work influenced by the philosophy of Darwin and Herbert\r\nSpencer, applied to the physiology and pathology of mind, and to the\r\nrelationship between body and mind. The time is not yet come for\r\nan impartial estimate of the striking works which Dr. Maudsley has\r\nbrought forth in fertile succession, in addition to his extensive\r\nlabours as one of the editors of the _Journal of Mental Science_. But\r\nit is certain that every one who would place himself in a position\r\nto estimate the strength of the so-called “materialistic” school,\r\nwhether he be a metaphysician, a doctor, or a person of average\r\nculture, must read Dr. Maudsley’s works. They are written fearlessly,\r\nand for the most part with admirable lucidity, displaying a knowledge\r\nof literature and philosophy not often met with, combined with great\r\npractical experience in mental phenomena.\r\n\r\nHenry Maudsley was born near Giggleswick, in Yorkshire, on February\r\n5, 1835. After receiving his early education at Giggleswick School,\r\nhe proceeded to University College, London, and took the M.B. degree\r\nat London University in 1856, with the distinction of University\r\nScholar in Medicine. He proceeded to the M.D. degree in 1857. During\r\nthe years 1859-1862 he was Resident Physician to the Manchester\r\nRoyal Lunatic Hospital. Returning later to London he became for a\r\ntime Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at his old college, and later\r\nConsulting Physician to the West London Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn an article on “The Theory of Vitality,” which Dr. Maudsley\r\npublished in the _British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review_ in\r\n1863 (republished in “Body and Mind,” 1870), he showed remarkable\r\npower for a young man of twenty-eight. His conclusion was that\r\nthe conscious mind of man blends in unity of development with the\r\nunconscious life of nature. He looked for the harmonisation of the\r\nidealism of Plato and the realism of Bacon as the expressions of the\r\nsame truths.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Dr. Maudsley published an important work on the Physiology\r\nand Pathology of Mind. It was intended to treat of mental phenomena\r\nfrom a physiological rather than from a metaphysical point of view\r\nand secondly, to bring the manifold instructive instances presented\r\nby the unsound mind to bear upon the interpretation of the obscure\r\nproblems of mental science, and to do what he could to put an end to\r\nthe inauspicious divorce between the two branches of his subject.\r\nHe energetically exposed the shortcomings of psychologists and\r\nmetaphysicians, and naturally encountered severe criticism, and it\r\nmay be allowed that some of his expressions were those of youthful\r\nenthusiasm rather than of matured wisdom. But the book had such\r\nmerits, that a second edition was called for in the next year, and\r\nbefore long exhausted, after which the book was out of print for some\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt length Dr. Maudsley republished in a modified form the “Physiology\r\nof Mind” in a separate volume of 550 pages (1876), putting it\r\nforward as a disquisition, by the light of existing knowledge,\r\nconcerning the nervous structures and functions which are the\r\nprobable physical foundations of those natural phenomena, which\r\nappear in consciousness, or feelings, and thoughts. In this work he\r\nsays (p. 47) “that the subjective method—the method of interrogating\r\nself-consciousness—is not adequate to the construction of a true\r\nmental science has now seemingly been sufficiently established. That\r\nis not to say that it is worthless; for when not strained beyond its\r\ncapabilities, its results must, in the hands of competent men, be as\r\nuseful as they are indispensable.... That which a just reflection\r\nteaches incontestably, the present state of physiology illustrates\r\npractically. Though very imperfect as a science, physiology has made\r\nsufficient progress to prove that no psychology can endure except it\r\nbe based upon its investigations.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Maudsley had been called upon in 1870 to deliver the\r\nGulstonian Lectures at the College of Physicians, and these were\r\npublished in a small book under the title “Body and Mind: an Inquiry\r\ninto their Connection and Mutual Influence, specially in Reference\r\nto Mental Disorders.” The first lecture expounded the physical\r\nconditions of mental function in health; the second described some\r\nforms of mental degeneracy which showed prominently the operation of\r\nphysical causes from generation to generation, and the relationship\r\nof mental disorders to other diseases of the nervous system. The\r\nthird included a general survey of the pathology of the mind, and the\r\nrelations of morbid states of body to disordered mental function.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some important medico-legal cases had brought into\r\nprominence Dr. Maudsley’s belief that there are many forms of\r\nmental disease in which a patient ought not to be held criminally\r\nresponsible for his actions, although he might be fully cognisant of\r\ntheir nature. This was definitely expressed as far back as 1864 in a\r\npamphlet entitled “Insanity and Crime,” a medico-legal commentary on\r\nthe case of George Victor Townley, by the editors of the _Journal of\r\nMental Science_. It was in 1872 more fully developed by Dr. Maudsley\r\nin his “Responsibility in Mental Disease,” which has gone through\r\nnumerous editions.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the “Pathology of Mind” appeared in a separate and enlarged\r\nform, and contains a systematic exposition of the subject, introduced\r\nby an account of sleep, dreaming, somnambulism, and allied states.\r\nHe then proceeds to deal with the causation of insanity, both social\r\nand material, and then further expounds the symptoms of insanity,\r\ntreating it as one disease with varied manifestations, and then\r\ndelineating the clinical groups of mental disorders met with in\r\npractice and which the physician has to deal with. One great merit\r\nof the book is, that the clinical pictures it contains are drawn from\r\nlife. An extract from chapter iv., dealing with the influence of\r\nconditions of life on the production of insanity, will show how at\r\nevery step Dr. Maudsley introduces considerations bearing on morality.\r\n\r\n“The maxims of morality which were proclaimed by holy men of old as\r\nlessons of religion indispensable to the well-being and stability of\r\nfamilies and nations, are not really wild dreams of inspired fancy,\r\nnor the empty words which preachers make them; founded on a sincere\r\nrecognition of the laws of nature working in human events, they\r\nwere visions of eternal truths of human evolution. Assuredly the\r\n‘everlasting arms’ are beneath the upright man who dealeth uprightly,\r\nbut they are the everlasting laws of nature which sustain him who,\r\ndoing that which is lawful and right, leads a life that is in\r\nfaithful harmony with the laws of nature’s progress; the destruction\r\nwhich falls upon him who dealeth treacherously and doeth iniquity,\r\n‘observing not the commandments of the Lord to obey them,’ are the\r\navenging consequences of broken natural laws. How long will it be\r\nbefore men perceive and acknowledge the eternity of action, good\r\nor ill, and feel the keen sense of responsibility, and the strong\r\nsentiment of duty which so awful a reflection is fitted to engender?\r\nHow long before they realise vividly that under the reign of law on\r\nearth sin or error is inexorably avenged, as virtue is indicated,\r\nin its consequences, and take to heart the lesson that they are\r\ndetermining in their generation what shall be predetermined in the\r\nconstitution of the generation after them?”\r\n\r\nA later important work is “Body and Will,” 1883. “Its justification\r\nfrom my standpoint,” says Dr. Maudsley, “is, that I have been engaged\r\nall my life in dealing with mind in its concrete human embodiments,\r\nand that in order to find out why individuals feel, think, and do\r\ndifferently, and in what way best to deal with them so as to do one’s\r\nduty to oneself and to them, I have had no choice but to leave the\r\nbarren heights of speculation for the plains on which men live and\r\nmove and have their being. It is not enough to think and talk about\r\nabstract minds and their qualities when you have to do with concrete\r\nminds that must be observed, and studied, and managed.”\r\n\r\nThis work deals with questions too vast to be summarily discussed;\r\nbut one aspect of Dr. Maudsley’s mind is well expounded in the\r\nfollowing extract:—\r\n\r\n“In nature, as we see it, we seem to see a conflict of warring\r\nopposites; gravitation opposed, or rather indeed complemented, by\r\nrepulsion; chemical affinities by chemical repulsions; magnetic\r\nattraction by electric repulsion; evolution by dissolution;\r\nconservation by revolution, quiet or catastrophic; love by hate;\r\nself-love by love of kind; heaven by hell. Certain it is that hate\r\nand destruction are just as necessary agents as love and production\r\nin nature, which could no more be, or be conceived to be, without\r\nthe one than without the other; and to call the one good more than\r\nthe other, however necessary from the standpoint of human egoism,\r\nis just as if one were to call gravitation good and repulsion bad,\r\nas gravitation, had it self-consciousness, would no doubt do. In\r\norder to have a theory of cosmogony that shall cover all the facts,\r\nit has always been necessary to supplement a good principle by a\r\nbad principle, a God of love and creation by a God of hate and\r\ndestruction. And it must always be so. We may, agreeably to the logic\r\nof our wishes, comfort ourselves in our pilgrimage by entertaining\r\nthe hope and belief of the working out of good through evil and of\r\nthe permanence of good after the disappearance of evil, just as, if\r\nit were useful and pleasing to us to cherish the illusion, we might\r\npersuade ourselves that repulsion will one day be annihilated and\r\ngravitation endure, or that evolution will continue and dissolution\r\ncease to be; but if we look at the matter in the cold spirit of\r\nstrictly rational inquiry we shall always find abundant reason to\r\nbelieve that the sum of the respective energies of good and evil\r\nremains a constant quantity, the respective distribution only\r\nvarying, and that we might as well try to increase the height of the\r\nmountain without increasing the depth of the valley, as to increase\r\nthe good in the world by purging it of its so-called evil.”\r\n\r\nDr. Maudsley became a Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1869,\r\nhas been President of the Medico-Psychological Association, and\r\nreceived the LL.D. degree from Edinburgh University in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] “Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraints,” 1856.\r\n\r\n[18] For details of the exposure of 1813 and 1814, see “A History of\r\nthe York Asylum,” York, 1815.\r\n\r\n[19] For a description of the state of Bethlem Hospital in 1815, see\r\nConolly’s work above cited, pp. 26-29.

This is true of many professions besides\r\nthose of medicine. Although the general discernment has always\r\nrecognised the ability of men with powers of the universal type,\r\nthese men are rare, and there is a strong tendency to believe that a\r\nman cannot be master of the whole field of a science, but may more\r\nprobably be master of a portion of it. Again, with hawk eye the\r\npeople who want to be cured of disease mark and then swoop down upon\r\nmen who appear to them specially capable in one department of medical\r\npractice, and no denunciation of specialism, no drawing back on the\r\npart of the physician, will avail against this natural selection. The\r\nman to whom crowds of patients of one kind flock naturally becomes\r\nspecially skilled in dealing with them: and it is impossible to stem\r\nthe tide by saying that such ought not to be the case.\r\n\r\nSpecialism has been carried to a surprising extent in America, when\r\nDr. Morell Mackenzie informs us, in his article on “Specialism in\r\nMedicine,”[21] it would be almost impossible to find a city with\r\nten thousand inhabitants in which there are not three or four\r\nspecialists; whilst in a city of one hundred and thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, thirteen specialists were found exclusively engaged in\r\ntreating throat diseases.\r\n\r\nThe days of encyclopædic knowledge may be past, but the need of\r\na broad, general, scientific, and professional education for the\r\nmedical man, even a specialist, will never cease. If, as Dr.\r\nMackenzie says, the leviathans of omniscience loom dim and gigantic,\r\nlike the megatherium and mastodon of remote geological periods, and\r\nif the type is as utterly extinct as he believes, it is all the\r\nmore incumbent on the guides of medical instruction to see that\r\ntheir pupils pass through a broad course of study which shall fairly\r\nrepresent the achievements of the past and the main features of the\r\nknowledge of the present. ERASMUS WILSON was a man who undoubtedly\r\ngained a good record in general professional knowledge, and knew well\r\nthe anatomy and physiology of his student days.\r\n\r\nWilliam James Erasmus Wilson, son of William Wilson, surgeon, a\r\nnative of Aberdeen, in early life a naval surgeon, who later settled\r\nat Dartford and Greenhithe in Kent, was born on November 25, 1809,\r\nin High Street, Marylebone, where his maternal grandfather, Erasmus\r\nBronsdorph, a Norwegian by birth, resided. He was educated at\r\nDartford Grammar School and at Swanscombe, but very soon commenced\r\npractical medical work under his father in the parish infirmary.\r\nAt the early age of sixteen he was sent to London to enter John\r\nAbernethy’s anatomical class, and there is no doubt that his\r\nteacher’s individuality powerfully impressed him. But among his\r\nfriends were some who led his tastes also somewhat deeply into botany\r\nand zoology, entomological facts then learnt being destined to bear\r\nfruit in his Commentary on Diseases of the Skin.\r\n\r\nWilson was enabled to extend his studies to Paris in 1828 and\r\nin 1830, where he attended Cuvier’s and Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s\r\nlectures, and among others saw the practice of Dupuytren, Orfila, and\r\nLisfranc. He became noted for his neat dissections, insomuch that\r\nhe was nicknamed the “piocheur,” or “sap” in English slang. To his\r\nexcellence in dissection young Wilson joined an equal faculty for\r\ndrawing, derived from his mother.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 young Wilson had become a resident pupil with Mr. Langstaff,\r\nfather of a fellow-student, surgeon to the parish infirmary of\r\nCripplegate. Here in Langstaff’s dissecting-room, where many\r\npathological researches were carried on, Wilson made the acquaintance\r\nof numerous men of mark who resorted thither, including Jones Quain\r\nand William Lawrence. On the establishment of the Aldersgate School\r\nof Medicine under Lawrence’s régime, Wilson joined it as student, and\r\nin 1829-30 won both the surgical and the midwifery prizes. On the\r\nday when he attained his majority, November 25, 1830, Wilson took the\r\nApothecaries’ Hall diploma.\r\n\r\nHaving become a member of the London College of Surgeons in 1831,\r\nWilson was asked by Dr. Jones Quain, then Professor of Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology at University College, London, to be his assistant, and\r\nhe soon after was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy under Richard\r\nQuain. Wilson was a capital teacher of anatomy, and his private\r\nmuseum of dissections prepared by his own hands fully illustrated\r\nhis manipulative capacity. He superintended the execution of the\r\nillustrations to the celebrated Quain’s Anatomy, and also those to\r\nListon’s Practical Surgery (1837).\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Jones Quain retired from University College Hospital in\r\n1838, Wilson resigned his appointments also, and established a school\r\nof anatomy under the title of Sydenham College, which however did not\r\nprove ultimately successful. He then devoted himself to such private\r\npractice as he could obtain in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square,\r\neking out his income by taking pupils, and by literary work. In 1838\r\nhe appeared as an author with “The Dissector’s Manual of Practical\r\nand Surgical Anatomy,” subsequently producing the “Anatomist’s Vade\r\nMecum” (1840), of which many editions have been called for. In\r\nthe same year he became Lecturer on Anatomy and Physiology at the\r\nMiddlesex Hospital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wilson had made the acquaintance of a man who was destined\r\nto turn his thoughts in the direction which became permanent. His\r\nfather, after retiring from the navy, had taken a mansion at Deham,\r\nBucks, and set up a private lunatic asylum; and in connection with\r\nthis establishment Wilson met Mr. Thomas Wakley, M.P., the founder of\r\nthe _Lancet_, and coroner for Middlesex. Mr. Wakley appointed Wilson\r\nsub-editor of the _Lancet_ in 1840, a post which he held for several\r\nyears, continuing to write for that journal after resigning the more\r\nonerous post when his private practice increased. About this time he\r\nbecame Consulting Surgeon to the Marylebone Infirmary, and gained a\r\nvery extensive experience of every department of hospital surgery. In\r\nfact, it appeared at first that Wilson would probably make his mark\r\nas a pure surgeon.\r\n\r\nNo more certain path, however, opening in this direction, Mr. Wakley\r\nconsiderably influenced Wilson towards choosing a special line of\r\npractice as a means of success. There was much open opposition\r\nat that time among medical men to the idea of specialisation,\r\nand Mr. Wakley succeeded in overcoming Wilson’s fear of sinking\r\nunder the dreaded name of quack. The choice of a specialty was not\r\ndifficult, as skin diseases or dermatology then constituted an almost\r\nuncultivated field. “I have never regretted my choice,” he remarked\r\non one occasion;[22] “there is only one more beautiful thing in the\r\nworld than a fine healthy skin, and that is a rare skin disease.”\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Wilson brought out his extended systematic work on Diseases\r\nof the Skin, and subsequently produced twelve fasciculi of folio\r\n“Portraits of Diseases of the Skin.” In connection with these we may\r\nmention that he took a large share in the well-known five volumes\r\nof Anatomical Plates, issued jointly by Dr. Quain and himself. In\r\n1843 he was elected a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and in 1844\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society, having contributed to the latter\r\na memoir on a newly-discovered parasite on the human skin, the\r\n_Entozoon folliculorum_. He made himself familiar with varieties\r\nof skin diseases by extensive vacation rambles—in Switzerland and\r\nthe Valais studying goitre, in Italy searching out ringworm cases\r\namong the peasantry, in the East making leprosy a special object of\r\ninquiry. He wrote the article “Skin” in Cooper’s Surgical Dictionary,\r\na Report on Leprosy, and many articles on various subjects connected\r\nwith the specialty.\r\n\r\nThus Wilson became a specialist of great merit as well as profitable\r\npractice, and, says the _Lancet_ (August 16, 1884), “knew more about\r\nskin diseases than any man of his time. He cured when others had\r\nfailed to cure; and his works on dermatology, though they met with\r\npretty searching criticism at the time of their appearance, have\r\nnearly all maintained their position as text-books. The horrible\r\ncases of scrofula, anæmia, and blood-poisoning which he witnessed\r\namong the poor of London—they are happily rarer now than they were\r\nhalf a century ago—enlisted his warm sympathies. But he had to deal\r\nwith rich patients as well as poor, and over these the masterful\r\nstamp of his mind enabled him to exercise despotism in matters of\r\ndiet. Wilson was not only a consummate dietician, but he knew how to\r\nmake his patients submit to have their bodies placed under martial\r\nlaw.” He in fact largely viewed skin diseases as expressions of\r\ninternal derangement and constitutional defects. He was continually\r\non the look out for deficiency of nutrition in children and remedying\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWilson was much pleased to be the means of bringing forward a little\r\nwork on “Infant Life: its Nurture and Care,” written anonymously by\r\na lady, and first published in his “Journal of Cutaneous Medicine.”\r\nIn the preface which he wrote to it he expresses his strong beliefs\r\nthat hygiene is the first necessity of a scholastic institution,\r\nthat with proper nurture almost all the diseases of infants would be\r\nextinguished, that illness following vaccination properly performed\r\ncan only occur owing to neglect of proper nurture and care, and that\r\n“healthy children never suffer, never die from vaccination.”\r\n\r\nAn incident which brought Erasmus Wilson prominently before the\r\npublic was the inquest held at Hounslow on a soldier who had died\r\nafter a regimental flogging. Mr. Wakley held the inquest, which\r\nlasted eleven days. It was in a great measure owing to Mr. Wilson’s\r\ndecided evidence that a verdict was returned declaring that the\r\nflogging had been the cause of death. The public feeling was aroused,\r\na Parliamentary inquiry was subsequently held, and the punishment of\r\nflogging was at last removed from the regimental code.\r\n\r\nSeveral works of considerable merit made Wilson’s name very widely\r\nknown. One of the most popular of these was entitled “Healthy Skin,”\r\nfirst published in 1845. It strongly advocated that constant use of\r\nthe bath which has become far more prevalent than when it was first\r\nissued. A translation of Hufeland’s “Art of Prolonging Life,” which\r\nhe edited, appeared in 1853. In “The Eastern or Turkish Bath,” in\r\n1861, Wilson gave a powerful impetus to the establishment and spread\r\nof the Turkish bath in England, and laid down principles and plans\r\nof procedure calculated to make this bath safe for persons of very\r\nvaried constitutions.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Erasmus Wilson founded at his own cost a museum and\r\nprofessorship of dermatology at the College of Surgeons, with an\r\nendowment of £5000, and was appointed the first professor. In this\r\ncapacity he lectured for nearly ten years. Several successive series\r\nof lectures were published, as well as a catalogue of the museum.\r\nHe was also the founder of the Chair of Pathology in Aberdeen\r\nUniversity. He also endowed a pathological curatorship at the College\r\nof Surgeons. He was elected on the Council of the College in 1870,\r\nand was President in 1881. A special grant of an honorary gold medal\r\nwas made to him by the College in 1884, just before his death.\r\n\r\nHis early Eastern travels had particularly interested Wilson in\r\nEgyptology, and he became by wide reading and study very competent\r\nin Egyptian lore, as is evidenced by his “Egypt of the Past,”\r\npublished in 1881. His munificence in connection with the bringing\r\nof the obelisk known as “Cleopatra’s Needle” to London in 1877-8 is\r\na familiar story. Many abortive proposals had been made to secure\r\nits being brought to England, but Government had always failed to\r\nmake any arrangement. General Sir James Alexander was the means of\r\nstarting the idea in Erasmus Wilson’s mind, by speaking to him of\r\na project for raising sufficient money by a general subscription.\r\nWilson, who was greatly interested, thought the sum needed, £10,000,\r\nwould not be forthcoming, and undertook to pay the entire sum\r\nhimself, Mr. John Dixon, C.E., having undertaken its successful\r\ntransport. Thus Britons will ever owe to him the possession of this\r\nchoice treasure of Egyptian antiquity. The book entitled “Cleopatra’s\r\nNeedle: with Brief Notes on Egypt and Egyptian Obelisks,” which\r\nWilson brought out in 1877, went through several editions.\r\n\r\nBut these were only a few of the public objects to which Erasmus\r\nWilson devoted his wealth, which had been vastly increased by\r\nsingularly skilful investments in gas and railway companies’ shares.\r\nHe restored Swanscombe Church, near his birthplace, in 1873. He\r\nfounded, at a cost of £2500, a scholarship at the Royal College of\r\nMusic, besides contributing considerably to its general funds. He was\r\na large subscriber to the Royal Medical Benevolent College at Epsom,\r\nand built at his own cost a house for the head-master; further, he\r\nbuilt at a cost of £30,000 a new wing and chapel for the Sea-Bathing\r\nInfirmary at Margate, in which skin diseases are largely treated. He\r\nwas a strong Freemason, and contributed liberally to various Masonic\r\ncharities. In recognition of his many public benefactions he was\r\nknighted in 1881.\r\n\r\n“From his earliest life,” says the _British Medical Journal_ (August\r\n16, 1884), “he was characterised particularly by his kindliness and\r\ngentleness of manner, which made him many friends; indeed, to know\r\nhim was to love him. His generosity to poor patients who came to\r\nconsult him was very great, not only prescribing for them gratis,\r\nbut supplying the means for carrying out the treatment, and that\r\nnot only after he became wealthy, but even at a time when he could\r\nill afford to be generous. The amount of good he did privately will\r\nprobably never be known, as he was one of whom it may truly be said,\r\nthat he never let his left hand know what his right hand did—so\r\nunostentatious was he in regard to his charity.”\r\n\r\nSir Erasmus Wilson had been in ill-health for two years before his\r\ndeath, and for a year was quite blind, yet never lost cheerfulness.\r\nOn July 23, 1884, he was at the consecration of St. Saviour’s Church\r\nat Westgate on Sea, of which he had laid the foundation-stone a year\r\nbefore. Within three days he became seriously ill, and died on August\r\n7th. He had married in 1841 a Miss Doherty, who survived him. He left\r\nno family, and the bulk of his property, something like £180,000,\r\nreverts on Lady Wilson’s death to the College of Surgeons, without\r\nany restriction as to the disposal of the fund. Other legacies of\r\n£5000 each he bequeathed to the Sea-Bathing Infirmary at Margate, the\r\nMedical Benevolent College, and the Society for the Relief of the\r\nWidows and Orphans of Medical Men. Such bequests alone would place a\r\nman among great public benefactors. Wilson had not waited till death\r\ncame before he became beneficent, and if his gifts are used in the\r\nspirit in which he gave them, he will rank with John Hunter as to the\r\nmaterial if not the intellectual legacy he has bequeathed to mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDescended from an old Scotch family (the Mackenzies of Scutwell),\r\nDr. MORELL MACKENZIE is the son of the late Mr. Stephen Mackenzie,\r\nsurgeon, of Leytonstone, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Mr. Adam\r\nHarvey of Lewes. Morell Mackenzie was born at Leytonstone, on the\r\nborders of Epping Forest, on the 7th July 1837. His father was a man\r\nof exceptional intellectual power, whose studies took the direction\r\nof metaphysics and mental diseases; hence he acquired great skill in\r\ntreating nervous affections which border on insanity. His ability\r\nwas testified to by Mr. Brudenell Carter in his valuable essay on\r\nHysteria (see p. 268). Mrs. Mackenzie was a clever woman of a highly\r\npractical tendency. The untimely death of Stephen Mackenzie in 1851,\r\nwhen he was thrown out of his gig and killed on the spot, left his\r\nwidow with nine children very slenderly provided for.\r\n\r\nMorell Mackenzie was educated by Dr. Greig of Walthamstow, many of\r\nwhose pupils entered the service of the East India Company. Mackenzie\r\nalways took a great interest in natural history, in which he was\r\nlargely encouraged by his mother, and from an early period greatly\r\ndesired to enter the medical profession. But a medical education\r\nbeing then beyond the means of the family so suddenly bereaved, he\r\nwas placed at the age of sixteen in the office of the Union Assurance\r\nCompany in Cornhill. Here he got on very well, but never abandoned\r\nthe hope of becoming a doctor. Fortunately, by the kind aid of a\r\nrelative, he was enabled to gratify this desire, and he accordingly\r\nresigned his clerkship, and became a student at the London Hospital.\r\n\r\nOn commencing his medical studies Mackenzie determined to take his\r\ndegree at the University of London, combining with his hospital work\r\nthe preparation for matriculation. Having become a member of the\r\nCollege of Surgeons in 1858, he subsequently took the M.B. degree\r\nwith high honours in three subjects. At the London Hospital he\r\nobtained the senior gold medal for surgery, and the gold medal for\r\nzeal, talent, and humanity to the patients, awarded by the governors.\r\nOn leaving the hospital he went to Paris, where he studied for a\r\nyear under Trousseau, Nélaton, Ricord, and others. He spent another\r\nyear in Vienna, where he studied pathology under Rokitansky, chest\r\ndiseases under Skoda, skin affections under Hebra, and diseases of\r\nthe eye under Arlt and Jäger. During his stay at Vienna Mackenzie\r\nmade an expedition to Pesth in order to become acquainted with\r\nthe laryngoscope, an instrument invented by Manuel Garcia, which\r\nCzermak was then beginning to use. A friendship sprang up between\r\nthese two men which only terminated with Czermak’s lamented death.\r\nCzermak was very desirous that Mackenzie should translate some of\r\nhis papers and publish them in the English medical journals, but he\r\nhad determined to study for a few months in Italy, and before he\r\nreturned home Czermak had himself come over to London and introduced\r\nthe laryngoscope into England. On arriving in London Mackenzie was\r\nat once appointed Resident Medical Officer at the London Hospital,\r\nand shortly afterwards Registrar to that institution. He now began to\r\nmake daily studies with the laryngoscope, and soon published cases in\r\nthe medical journals which had been treated by its aid. In 1862 he\r\ncompleted the M.D. degree at London University.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Jacksonian prize for an essay on the Diseases of the\r\nLarynx was awarded to Mackenzie by the Royal College of Surgeons,\r\nand on the urgent advice of many of his medical friends, especially\r\nthat of the late Dr. Herbert Davies, he determined to make throat\r\ndiseases a specialty, and having established himself in practice in\r\nthe West End, he was largely instrumental in founding the Throat\r\nHospital in King Street, Golden Square, in the same year. In 1866 Dr.\r\nMackenzie was appointed Assistant-Physician to the London Hospital,\r\nand his colleagues subsequently offered to recommend to the committee\r\nof that institution that a department for throat diseases should be\r\nestablished under his supervision. This however he declined, on the\r\nground that he wished to treat diseases of every kind whilst attached\r\nto the London Hospital. He, however, gave a course of lectures on\r\nThroat Diseases at the London Hospital Medical College, whilst he\r\nalso lectured on Physiology for three years. Dr. Mackenzie was\r\nafterwards obliged, owing to his increasing practice, to resign his\r\nconnection with the London Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Mackenzie has for many years occupied a prominent position\r\nnot only as a specialist but as a champion of specialism, and has\r\nexhibited considerable persistence in his advocacy of any cause with\r\nwhich the interests of specialism were connected. Some years ago,\r\nwhen most of the special hospitals were excluded from participation\r\nin the London Hospital Sunday Fund, Dr. Morell Mackenzie led the\r\nattack upon the position taken up by the committee, with the result\r\nthat the treasurer of the Fund resigned, and a modification of\r\nprocedure took place. Dr. Mackenzie, among the other honorary\r\nmemberships of foreign societies which have been conferred upon him,\r\nis one of the two honorary Fellows of the American Laryngological\r\nAssociation, Signor Garcia being the other. He has invented a number\r\nof instruments or modifications of instruments for the treatment\r\nof throat diseases, and has written copiously on the subject. His\r\nprincipal works are entitled “On the Use of the Laryngoscope in\r\nDiseases of the Throat,” “Essays on Throat Diseases,” “Diphtheria,”\r\n“Hay Fever,” and “Diseases of the Throat and Nose.” He has also\r\nwritten the article on Diseases of the Larynx in Reynolds’s “System\r\nof Medicine.”\r\n\r\nDr. Morell Mackenzie claims that his experience as to diseases of the\r\nthroat amply justifies and necessitates specialism. “The scientific\r\nliterature relating to these,” he says (_Fortnightly Review_, June\r\n1885), “dates from little more than twenty-five years back, and\r\nalready it has grown to a bulk that would surfeit the voracity of the\r\nmost persevering bookworm, and it goes on increasing and multiplying\r\nin a manner that makes one long for a Malthus to preach some degree\r\nof moderation to its producers. Every week, every day brings one\r\nbooks, pamphlets, articles, lectures, reprints about all sorts of\r\nuncomfortable things in _itis_ and _osis_, as seen in the throats of\r\nEnglishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Danes, Russians, Americans,\r\nand all the other offspring of Babel. A certain proportion of these,\r\nno doubt, are of great value, but not a few might be consigned to\r\nthe wastepaper basket without serious loss to science; all must be\r\nread, however, lest some grains of wheat should be thrown away with\r\nthe chaff. Several periodicals dealing exclusively with diseases of\r\nthe throat appear with praiseworthy regularity; and there are also\r\nsocieties, associations, &c., founded for the same purpose, each of\r\nwhich, of course, issues its yearly volume of Transactions.... This\r\nmay give some faint idea of the herculean labour which the specialist\r\nwho wishes to keep abreast of the progress of knowledge in his own\r\nsubject from the literary point of view alone has to undergo; and\r\nit must be remembered that in medicine reading is after all only\r\nsubsidiary to the practical work by which skill is perfected and\r\nexperience gathered and extended.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subject of animal parasites upon and in the human body, while\r\ncertainly not one of the most attractive on a superficial view, has\r\nyet been found to yield scientific material of the highest interest,\r\nand has required great energy and care to produce satisfactory\r\nresults. Among British workers in this field none is more widely\r\nknown than Dr. THOMAS SPENCER COBBOLD, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nDr. Cobbold is the third son of the late Rev. Richard Cobbold,\r\nrector of Wortham, Suffolk, the author of the striking “History of\r\nMargaret Catchpole,” and his grandmother, Mrs. Cobbold, was a zealous\r\ngeological collector in the early days of geology, having a fossil\r\nspecies of mollusc (_Nucula Cobboldiæ_) named in her honour. The\r\nsubject of this notice was born at Ipswich in 1828, and educated for\r\nsome years by the Rev. H. Burrows, at Yarmouth, and afterwards at the\r\nCharterhouse.\r\n\r\nYoung Cobbold entered upon the study of medicine at the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Hospital in 1844, as pupil of Mr. Crosse, F.R.S. Later\r\nhe proceeded to Edinburgh, and became class-assistant to Professor\r\nHughes Bennett, and prosector to Professor Goodsir, then at the\r\nheight of his career. Such men, and especially Goodsir, exercised a\r\ngreat awakening influence on young Cobbold, and deepened his strong\r\ntendencies towards anatomical research. In 1851 Dr. Cobbold graduated\r\non the same day as Dr. Burdon-Sanderson, now Waynflete Professor\r\nof Physiology at Oxford, and the late Dr. Charles Murchison, all\r\nthree being gold-medallists. After studying for some time in Paris,\r\nDr. Cobbold on his return to Edinburgh was appointed curator of\r\nthe Anatomical Museum, and became active in dissecting specimens\r\nof animals received at the museum. Among others his memoir on\r\nthe giraffe and other ruminants formed the basis of his article\r\nRuminantia, contributed to Todd and Bowman’s Cyclopædia of Anatomy\r\nand Physiology. When the lamented Edward Forbes was elected to the\r\nchair of Natural History, Dr. Cobbold’s attention was powerfully\r\nattached to geology, and for some years he made excursions with\r\nhis class, and collected large numbers of fossils. More distant\r\nexcursions to Arran, the Yorkshire and Devonshire coasts, the Isle of\r\nWight, &c., supplied Dr. Cobbold with specimens of great service in\r\nillustrating the Swiney Lectures, which he afterwards delivered for\r\nfive years with marked success at the British Museum and at the Royal\r\nSchool of Mines (1868-72). So popular did these lectures become that\r\ntowards the close of the last course many of the visitors could not\r\nfind seats.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Edward Forbes, Dr. Cobbold resigned his\r\nappointments in Edinburgh, and became Lecturer on Botany at St.\r\nMary’s Hospital. Two years later he transferred his services to the\r\nMiddlesex Hospital, lecturing there for thirteen years on Zoology\r\nand Comparative Anatomy. During his connection with the Middlesex\r\nHospital he took up the branch of zoology and medicine with which his\r\nname will be most distinctively associated. During three successive\r\nyears he examined the bodies of animals dying at the Zoological\r\nGardens, especially with a view to discovering the presence of\r\nparasitic worms in them. Many papers were contributed by him to the\r\nLinnean and Zoological Transactions and Proceedings, among which we\r\nmay call attention to “Remarks on all the Human Entozoa” (Zool. Soc.\r\nProc., 1862).\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Dr. Cobbold was elected F.R.S., and in the same year\r\npublished his “Introductory Treatise on the Entozoa,” which\r\nestablished his reputation, the _Lancet_ declaring that it formed a\r\nnoble contribution to medical science and a credit to our national\r\nliterature. Up to the year 1865 Dr. Cobbold persevered in the\r\npursuit of pure science, refusing all inducements to practice; but\r\nfinding that after his twenty years of zealous labour, no suitable\r\nscientific post opened for him, he at length commenced practice in\r\nWimpole Street, removing later to Harley Street. Here his great\r\nknowledge of the habits and treatment of internal worm parasites\r\nbecame available for professional purposes, and his services were\r\nlargely sought. But scientific pursuits and public lecturing still\r\nclaimed his attention, and among the achievements of his later years\r\nare his book on Tapeworms, which has gone through several editions;\r\nhis lectures on practical helminthology, entitled “Worms;” a manual\r\nof the “Parasites of the Domesticated Animals,” a larger treatise\r\non Parasites, a smaller supplementary work on Human Parasites. In\r\n1873 Dr. Cobbold received the appointment of Professor of Botany at\r\nthe Royal Veterinary College, and soon afterwards a special chair\r\nof helminthology was established for him at the College, for giving\r\ninstruction on the parasites and parasitic diseases of domesticated\r\nanimals to veterinary students. In connection with this work. Dr.\r\nCobbold went still more deeply into the parasitic diseases of\r\ndomestic animals, such as those which caused grouse disease, ostrich\r\nand pigeon epidemics, gapes in chickens, &c. He delivered a course\r\nof lectures on the “Parasites of Animals employed as Food” at the\r\nSociety of Arts. He has been the first to describe many new species\r\nof internal worms from elephants, horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs.\r\nOne of the most elaborate of his special memoirs is that in which he\r\nhas described the parasites of elephants, in the Linnean Society’s\r\nTransactions. With these extensive researches in comparative anatomy,\r\nDr. Cobbold has not neglected human parasites of late years, and\r\nvarious papers and lectures of his have commanded much attention and\r\nelucidated important points. He contributed fifty short articles on\r\nthese subjects to Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine.” As a lecturer\r\nDr. Cobbold’s style is highly popular and pleasing. He possesses to\r\na great degree the power of putting himself on good terms with his\r\naudience and keeping them interested. His position in regard to the\r\ninvestigations with which his life has been chiefly occupied has been\r\nquite unique.\r\n\r\nAn extract from his work on Entozoa is an interesting example of a\r\nvery successful mode of treating this subject. “The happiest, and\r\nperhaps after all the most truly philosophic, way of studying the\r\nentozoa, is to regard them as a peculiar fauna, destined to occupy an\r\nequally peculiar territory. That territory is the widespread domain\r\nof the interior of the bodies of man and animals. Each animal or\r\n“host” may be regarded as a continent, and each part or viscus of\r\nhis body may be noted as a district. Each district has its special\r\nattractions for particular parasitic forms; yet, at the same time,\r\nneither the district nor the continent are suitable localities as\r\na permanent resting-place for the invader. None of the internal\r\nparasites ‘continue in one stay;’ all have a tendency to roam;\r\nmigration is the very soul of their prosperity; change of residence\r\nthe _sine quâ non_ of their existence, whilst a blockade in the\r\ninterior, prolonged beyond the proper period, terminates only in\r\ncretification and death.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] _Fortnightly Review_, June 1885, p. 775.\r\n\r\n[22] _World_, September 18, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n_EMINENT SPECIALISTS—continued._\r\n\r\n_SIR W. BOWMAN, BRUDENELL CARTER, AND EYE DISEASES; TOYNBEE, HINTON,\r\nAND EAR DISEASES._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye, the organ of light, was, till recent times, practically\r\na dark chamber. Only its grosser movements and the effects of its\r\nlenses upon the rays of light were understood. Its minute structure,\r\nits relationship to the brain, and the real nature of the morbid\r\nchanges occurring in it, were hidden. To-day its microscopic elements\r\nare unravelled, and very much is known of their connexion with the\r\ngreat nerve-centres behind them. Experiment and calculation have\r\ngone far to settle the precise mode in which light gives rise to\r\nsight, and affects our perception and judgment of external objects,\r\nand the condition of the eye during life and health or disease has\r\nbeen brought into view by the ophthalmoscope. The names of Helmholtz\r\nand of Donders are inseparably connected with modern advances in the\r\nphysiology of the eye, while no English name is more conspicuous in\r\nregard to the surgery of the eye than that with which we commence\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BOWMAN, the third son of Mr. J. Eddowes Bowman, banker,\r\nof Nantwich, and afterwards of Welshpool and Wrexham, was born at\r\nNantwich on July 20, 1816. He was early surrounded by scientific\r\nassociations, for his father was a botanist and geologist of wide\r\ncultivation, having formed a very complete herbarium of British\r\nplants, and having furnished to Sir Roderick Murchison valuable\r\noriginal matter for his “Silurian System.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bowman placed his son at Hazelwood School, Birmingham, which\r\nSir Rowland Hill’s father was conducting on the principle of\r\nthe abolition of corporal punishment. The boys largely governed\r\nthemselves, printing a magazine of their own. They were taught\r\nnatural science too, a very unusual thing in those days. In such a\r\ncongenial atmosphere young Bowman flourished, and in time became head\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nAn accident to one of his hands, about the close of his school\r\ncourse, seems to have led to Mr. Bowman’s choice of surgery as a\r\nprofession. For some months he saw country practice with Mr. T. T.\r\nGriffith, of Wrexham, seeing a good deal of cholera, which was then\r\nprevailing, and spending his leisure in copying anatomical drawings\r\nof the human bones and muscles. He then became, through the interest\r\nof Mr. Joseph Hodgson, F.R.S., afterwards President of the College of\r\nSurgeons, who had attended to his injured hand, a resident pupil at\r\nthe General Hospital, Birmingham, where he continued for five years.\r\n\r\nThese early years were fruitful in microscopical observations of both\r\nhealthy and diseased tissues, and even in experimental physiology,\r\nfor Mr. Bowman was one of those whose advancement in science has been\r\nconsiderably due to experiments upon animals. In 1837, after a brief\r\nvisit to the Dublin medical schools, he became a student at King’s\r\nCollege, London, where Robert Bentley Todd had been lately appointed\r\nProfessor of Physiology. Mr. Bowman’s skill and extensive knowledge\r\nwere soon made use of by Todd, and he was successively appointed\r\nprosector and demonstrator of anatomy and curator of the anatomical\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Mr. Bowman visited the hospitals and museums of Holland,\r\nGermany, and Vienna, and made a considerable stay in Paris in 1841.\r\nMeanwhile his original studies were bearing fruit in important\r\npapers contributed to the Royal Society, “On the Minute Structure\r\nand Movements of Voluntary Muscle” (1840), “On the Contraction of\r\nVoluntary Muscle in the Living Body” (1841), and, “On the Structure\r\nand Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the Kidney” (1842). The latter\r\nmarked a conspicuous advance in the physiology of the kidney, and Mr.\r\nBowman was distinguished by receiving a royal medal for it, having\r\nbeen elected F.R.S. in the previous year. Professor Michael Foster,\r\nin his address on Physiology to the International Medical Congress of\r\n1881, referred to these memoirs on muscle and the kidney as “classic\r\nworks, known and read of all instructed physiologists.”\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Mr. Bowman, at the early age of twenty-four, was appointed\r\nAssistant-Surgeon to King’s College Hospital. His scientific writing\r\nbecame much in demand. He wrote on Surgery in the “Encyclopædia\r\nMetropolitana,” on Muscle, Motion, and Mucous Membrane in Todd’s\r\n“Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology,” and took a large share with\r\nDr. Todd in writing and illustrating the “Physiological Anatomy\r\nand Physiology of Man,” which was brought out in parts. The desire\r\nto render this book as far as possible accurate and original by\r\nrepeating most of the observations of others and making new ones\r\nwhere necessary, led to successive delays in the appearance of the\r\nparts. Finally the closing part was written by Dr. Lionel Beale, and\r\npublished in 1856.\r\n\r\nHaving become a Fellow of the College of Surgeons in 1844, Mr. Bowman\r\nin 1846 joined the staff of the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital,\r\nMoorfields, as assistant-surgeon, having already made extensive\r\nresearches into the minute structure of all the organs of special\r\nsense. His advent to the Moorfields Hospital was marked by the\r\ndelivery, in 1847, of a series of lectures on the “Parts Concerned in\r\nOperations on the Eye,” which were afterwards separately published.\r\nIt was evident that ophthalmic surgery had gained a distinguished\r\nrecruit. Mr. Bowman had, independently of Brücke, discovered the\r\nciliary muscle, and his work brought forward numerous other facts\r\nof structure for the first time. His paper “On the Structure of the\r\nVitreous Body,” contributed to the _Dublin Quarterly Journal of\r\nMedical Science_, also attracted good attention. His suggestions on\r\noperations for artificial pupil in the _Medical Times and Gazette_\r\nalso showed conspicuous capacity for ophthalmic surgery.\r\n\r\nAlthough much urged to devote himself exclusively to this branch\r\nof practice, Mr. Bowman preferred to continue in general surgical\r\npractice for many years, attaining the surgeoncy to King’s College\r\nHospital in 1856, two years after he had reached the full surgeoncy\r\nat Moorfields. In 1848 he had been conjoined with Dr. Todd in the\r\nprofessorship of physiology and general and morbid anatomy in King’s\r\nCollege, retaining the professorship, after Dr. Todd’s retirement, in\r\nconjunction with Dr. Beale. But by 1855 Mr. Bowman found himself so\r\nfully occupied that he finally resigned the professorship. He held\r\nthe surgeoncy to King’s College Hospital till 1862.\r\n\r\nFrom this period Mr. Bowman has been the acknowledged leader\r\nof ophthalmic practice. He was one of the first to employ the\r\nophthalmoscope. His numerous papers in the Ophthalmic Hospital\r\nReports and in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions have given\r\nparticulars of many improvements in operations on the eye, which\r\nhe has adopted, introduced, or improved. Lachrymal obstructions,\r\nglaucoma, conical cornea, and cataract are among the subjects he\r\nhas specially dealt with; and he has by his clinical teaching and\r\noperative example contributed not a little to the building up of\r\nmodern ophthalmic surgery. The well-earned honour of a baronetcy was\r\nconferred upon him in 1884.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of Sir William Bowman’s sympathies is shown on the one\r\nhand by the active part he took in the establishment in 1848 of\r\nthe St. John’s House Sisterhood for training nurses for hospitals,\r\nfamilies, and the poor, having joined its council from the beginning,\r\nand having materially assisted Miss Florence Nightingale in her\r\nvarious philanthropic nursing enterprises; and, on the other hand,\r\nby his consistent advocacy of physiological experiment. He considers\r\nthat every step forwards in our knowledge of the healthy body must\r\nlead to a better understanding of disease and an improvement of\r\nour power of counteracting it, whether in the way of prevention,\r\nalleviation, or cure.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the British Medical Association at Chester in\r\n1866,[23] this eminent authority took occasion to protest forcibly\r\nagainst the imputation of cruelty to animals sometimes made against\r\nmedical men in respect of physiological experiments. He insisted\r\nboth on the excessive difficulty of these original inquiries and\r\nthe high motives which actuate physiologists and the higher class\r\nof scientific inquirers. “There should be no doubt,” said he, “as\r\nto the free allowance of dissections of living creatures for the\r\nadvancement, and also for the communication, of a knowledge so\r\nindispensable for our race, and for every generation of it.” He\r\npractically charged the opponents of vivisection with stopping the\r\ngates of knowledge, neither going in themselves nor suffering those\r\nthat were entering to go in.\r\n\r\nThe lofty view which Sir William Bowman takes of the surgeon’s\r\nfunction may be gathered from an extract from the above-mentioned\r\naddress. “I see no reason to doubt that future ages will still accept\r\nthe pious saying of one of old, that surgery is the _Hands of God_;\r\nthe Human Hands, apt images and reflex of man’s whole being, from his\r\nmorning hour of puling helplessness, when the\r\n\r\n     “... tender palm is prest\r\n  Against the circle of the breast;”\r\n\r\nthrough all his working day of time, until they shall be upraised\r\nonce more at last in joy and adoration, to hail a brighter and an\r\neternal dawning; the Human Hands, permitted now, through insight into\r\nGod’s laws, to be His instruments of succour to that earthly life and\r\norganisation which His power, wisdom, and love have first brought\r\ninto being, still alone both sustain and cause to perish when their\r\npart is played; to that material organisation which dies every hour\r\nit lives, which indeed dies by living, and lives by dying, and which\r\nwondrously transmits ever its own prerogatives and dark secrets to a\r\nsucceeding life, destined apparently to remain a marvel and a mystery\r\nimpenetrable to all generations.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe career of Mr. R. BRUDENELL CARTER is of special interest, owing\r\nto the fact that he was a general practitioner in the country till\r\nthe age of forty, and came to London in 1868 without friends or\r\nconnection, intending to establish himself as a specialist in eye\r\ndiseases, and in a few years attained to eminence. But Mr. Carter’s\r\nlife had been previously marked by energy and success of no common\r\norder; and his literary tastes and accomplishments ranked in the\r\nforefront of the causes of his success.\r\n\r\nA reference to Mr. Carter’s ancestry will show that good hereditary\r\ninfluences met and combined in him. His father was a major in the\r\nroyal marines; his grandfather, rector of Little Wittenham in\r\nBerkshire, was a younger brother of Elizabeth Carter, the well-known\r\npoetess and translator of Epictetus, whose portrait by Lawrence is\r\nin the National Portrait Gallery. The rector was entirely educated\r\nby his learned sister till he went to Cambridge. The rector’s wife\r\nwas a granddaughter of John Wallis, the mathematician and astronomer,\r\none of the founders of the Royal Society. The Carters belonged to the\r\nyounger branch of a family which had held the manor of St. Columb\r\nMajor in Cornwall from the time of Henry VII.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter was born, at Little Wittenham on October 2, 1828. After\r\nbeing at private schools he commenced his professional education by\r\napprenticeship to a general practitioner, and afterwards entered\r\nat the London Hospital. After becoming a member of the College of\r\nSurgeons in 1851 he practised for a short time at Leytonstone and at\r\nPutney.\r\n\r\nAt this period Mr. Carter published his first work “On the Pathology\r\nand Treatment of Hysteria” (1853). This was avowedly based to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the opinions and practice of Mr. Stephen\r\nMackenzie, then recently deceased, who was extensively known by his\r\nsuccessful treatment of the most inveterate hysterical disorders.\r\nThis work in itself sufficiently indicated the presence of a writer\r\npossessing both clearness of view and moderation of statement.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a much more extensive treatise “On the Influence\r\nof Education and Training in Preventing Diseases of the Nervous\r\nSystem” (1855). Mr. Carter was led to write it by observing the\r\nfrequent connection between faulty education and nervous or mental\r\ndisorders. It is divided into three parts, dealing respectively\r\nwith the Nervous System, Physical Education, and Moral Education.\r\nThe latter was that for the sake of which the book was written;\r\nit displays a thoughtful moderation and breadth of view, without,\r\nhowever, forecasting the author’s future eminence.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the completion of this book Mr. Carter started\r\nfor the Crimea, where he served with the army as staff-surgeon.\r\nReturning home when peace was concluded, he settled in\r\nNottinghamshire, and soon moving into the town of Nottingham, took an\r\nactive part in the establishment of an eye hospital there. In 1862\r\nhe removed to Stroud in Gloucestershire, and founded an eye hospital\r\nin Gloucester. In 1864 Mr. Carter became Fellow of the College of\r\nSurgeons by examination.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Mr. Carter took the important step of removing to London,\r\nresolving to rely upon medical and other literary work mainly until\r\npractice should come. Thus Mr. Carter has been the writer of very\r\nvoluminous contributions to journalism, and has shown great ease and\r\nlucidity of style. In 1869 he was appointed Surgeon to the Royal\r\nSouth London Ophthalmic Hospital, and in 1870 Ophthalmic Surgeon to\r\nSt. George’s Hospital. He has persevered in commenting severely upon\r\nerrors of modern education, and has especially dealt with evils done\r\nin various ways to the eyes in modern life. One pamphlet of his, “On\r\nthe Artificial Production of Stupidity in Schools,” has been often\r\nreprinted. In an address at the opening of the Medical Session at St.\r\nGeorge’s in 1873 Mr. Carter thus spoke of cramming: “The show pupils,\r\nwho furnish marvellous answers to a multiplicity of questions, on\r\na multiplicity of subjects, in response to the demands of various\r\npreliminary or matriculation examinations, remind me of nothing so\r\nmuch as of the wooden cannon which artillerymen call ‘Quakers,’ which\r\nrequire for their production in unlimited numbers, besides the\r\nblocks of wood, nothing but a turning-lathe and a paint-brush; and\r\nwhich are mounted, to deceive the enemy, in embrasures that would\r\notherwise be vacant.... But our ‘competition wallahs,’ instead of\r\nbeing used to deceive an enemy, have been used chiefly to deceive\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Mr. Carter published an extended and important “Practical\r\nTreatise on Diseases of the Eye.” In this he distinctly states that\r\nin its normal condition the eye has faults which would condemn a\r\ntelescope or microscope to be thrown aside as useless, but which in\r\nthe living organ are neutralised by the conditions under which it\r\nis exerted. He recommends any one who would operate upon the eye to\r\ntake a great deal of preliminary trouble, and to train his hands to\r\nespecial delicacy of action, so that he shall be indifferent which he\r\nuses. “It has more than once been my lot,” he says, “to see attempts\r\nto operate upon the human eye made by a surgeon who did not even\r\nknow how to hold the instruments he was about to misuse; and I can\r\nconceive few things more painful than such a spectacle.” “In all\r\nages and countries the bad workman has complained of his tools, and\r\nthe good workman has produced the most varied results by the most\r\nsimple means. A man who is very awkward, and whose awkwardness is\r\nperpetually bringing him to grief, hits upon a contrivance by which\r\nhe hopes that this natural result may in some degree be obviated. He\r\ncalls his contrivance an invention; and, like those persons of whom\r\nit is said that their glory is in their shame, he is often somewhat\r\nproud of it. Many surgeons of great and deserved repute have invented\r\neach a single instrument, such as Beer’s knife or Tyrrell’s hook; and\r\nsome have invented more than one, chiefly because they have struck\r\nout some new procedure for which new appliances were indispensable.\r\nBut as a rule the invention of many instruments by a surgeon may be\r\naccepted as a sufficient proof of his clumsiness; and when, without\r\nvalid reason, any single operator has his peculiar scissors, and his\r\npeculiar hook, and his peculiar forceps, and his peculiar scoop, all\r\ncalled after his name, it is more than probable that the gift of\r\nfingers has not been bestowed upon him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Carter in 1877 gave a course of lectures “on Defects of Vision\r\nwhich are Remediable by Optical Appliances,” as Hunterian Professor\r\nof Pathology and Surgery at the College of Surgeons. These were\r\npublished in the same year. He has since issued a more popular work,\r\n“Eyesight—Good and Bad: a Treatise on the Exercise and Preservation\r\nof Vision,” 1880. The following extract has to do with a very\r\ninjurious form of prejudice due to ignorance.\r\n\r\n“The persons who suffer most from popular prejudice and ignorance\r\non the subject of spectacles are men of the superior artisan class,\r\nwho are engaged on work which requires good eyesight, and who, at\r\nthe age of fifty or sixty, find their power of accomplishing such\r\nwork is diminishing. It is a rule in many workshops that spectacles\r\nare altogether prohibited, the masters ignorantly supposing them\r\nto be evidences of bad sight; whereas the truth is that they are\r\nnot evidences of bad sight at all, but only of the occurrence of a\r\nnatural and inevitable change, the effects of which they entirely\r\nobviate, leaving the sight as good for all purposes as it ever was.”\r\nHis general interest in education and its effects is abundantly\r\nmanifested as in the description of the late Mr. C. Paget’s half-time\r\nexperiment at Ruddington near Nottingham, where garden work was\r\nsubstituted for about half the ordinary school hours of a portion of\r\nthe scholars. The children so treated were found after a short period\r\naltogether to outstrip in their schoolwork those who devoted, or were\r\nsupposed to devote, twice as much time to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter has translated two valuable works bearing on his\r\nspecialty: viz., Zander on the Ophthalmoscope, and Scheffler on\r\nOcular Defects. He has contributed to “Our Homes, and How to Make\r\nthem Healthy,” to the Sydenham Society’s _Biennial Retrospect of\r\nMedicine_, and to many other publications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAural surgery has not long been raised to the rank of an honoured\r\nspecialty. JOSEPH TOYNBEE was told on one occasion by an eminent\r\nmember of the profession that he would make nothing of aural surgery.\r\nHe replied, “I will work at it for ten years, and then if nothing can\r\nbe made of it, I will tell you why.” On another occasion he said,\r\n“I’ll rescue aural surgery from the hands of the quacks” (_Medical\r\nTimes_, July 14, 1866). Prematurely cut off though he was, he added\r\nlargely to the scientific knowledge of the ear and its maladies, and\r\nvastly improved their treatment.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH TOYNBEE was born in 1815, at Heckington, in Lincolnshire,\r\nhis father having been a large farmer. After being for some years\r\nunder a private tutor at home, he went to King’s Lynn Grammar\r\nSchool. At seventeen he was apprenticed to Mr. William Wade of the\r\nWestminster General Dispensary, Soho, and studied anatomy under Mr.\r\nDermott. His assiduous and careful dissections were of essential\r\nbenefit in preparing him for his lifelong minute dissections of\r\nthe ear in health and disease. He further studied at St. George’s\r\nand at University College hospitals. Even during his student life\r\naural studies powerfully attracted him, and as early as 1836 several\r\nletters of his under the initials J. T. appeared in the _Lancet_.\r\nIn 1838 he became a member of the College of Surgeons, and was\r\nselected as assistant-curator of its museum under Professor Owen. He\r\nobtained the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1842 for researches\r\ndemonstrating the non-vascularity of articular cartilage, the cornea,\r\ncrystalline lens, vitreous humour, and epidermoid appendages, which\r\nwere published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1841.\r\n\r\nToynbee early entered upon aural practice in Argyll Place,\r\nbecoming also one of the surgeons to the St. James’s and St.\r\nGeorge’s Dispensary. He was included in the first list of Fellows\r\nof the College of Surgeons on the issue of its new charter. At\r\nthe Dispensary he founded a Samaritan Fund for supplying the sick\r\npoor with necessaries of life and warmth. All sanitary matters\r\nwere subjects of his profound interest, and he spent much time\r\nin improving the condition of things in the parishes around him,\r\nespecially promoting means of securing adequate ventilation, and the\r\nerection of model lodging-houses near Broad Street, Golden Square.\r\n\r\nToynbee’s practice gradually became very large, but he continued to\r\ndissect, and also to support administratively as well as pecuniarily\r\nmany benevolent societies. He found that so little was really known\r\nof the diseases of the ear from actual dissection, that his only hope\r\nof framing a system of aural surgery was by personal and persevering\r\nexamination and record of morbid specimens. This was carried on for\r\nmore than twenty years, until he had dissected about 2000 human ears.\r\nMany of these were derived from his patients in the large Asylum for\r\nthe Deaf and Dumb, whose condition he had examined previously to\r\ntheir death. Many medical men also supplied him with specimens of\r\ndiseased ears, as well as notes of cases. He further inquired closely\r\ninto the history of very many cases of patients with diseased ears.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Toynbee published an extended work on “The Diseases of the\r\nEar,” which placed the subject on a firm basis, and will always\r\nremain of great value from the interesting details of cases and\r\ntreatment which it contains. The list of his own published papers\r\non which it is based, about sixty in number, testifies to Toynbee’s\r\ngreat industry in research. They include papers on the structure and\r\nfunctions of the tympanic membrane, on the muscles which open the\r\nEustachian tube, and on the mode of conduction of sound from the\r\ntympanic membrane to the labyrinth of the ear, contributed to the\r\nRoyal Society, many researches on the diseases of the ear in the\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Transactions, and a crowd of series of cases or\r\nspecial memoirs contributed to the Pathological Society and medical\r\njournals. In 1857 he had published a descriptive catalogue of the\r\npreparations illustrating diseases of the ear contained in his own\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of St. Mary’s Hospital, Mr. Toynbee was elected\r\naural surgeon and lecturer on diseases of the ear; and he published\r\nin 1855 and 1856 courses of clinical lectures, which he delivered\r\nthere. He took a deep interest in the condition of idiots, and of the\r\ndeaf and dumb, and in many cases, to his great delight, devised plans\r\nby which those who were not totally deaf were taught to speak when\r\ntheir case had been regarded as hopeless, causing a corresponding\r\nimprovement in their mental faculties.\r\n\r\nTwo of his most zealously pursued hobbies were ventilation, and\r\nthe formation of local museums. It was said that patients who went\r\nto him for the benefit of their hearing, whether they improved in\r\nthat respect or not, came away full of the most advanced views\r\non ventilation. At Wimbledon, where he took a country-house, he\r\nwas indefatigable in developing a village club, and in forming an\r\neducative and recreative museum. He published valuable “Hints on the\r\nFormation of Local Museums” (1863), as well as “Wimbledon Museum\r\nNotes.” His enthusiastic advocacy was actively engaged in furthering\r\nthe establishment of similar clubs and museums in various parts of\r\nthe kingdom. He continued through life an active microscopist and\r\nzoologist, and was elected just before his death President of the\r\nQuekett (Microscopical) Club. At the same time he was treasurer of\r\nthe Medical Benevolent Club, to which he himself largely contributed.\r\n\r\nOne of Toynbee’s most valuable contributions to the treatment of\r\ndeafness was his invention of a method of forming an artificial\r\ntympanic membrane when that part had been destroyed or perforated.\r\nThis is fully described in his pamphlet on the subject, which went\r\nthrough many editions, as well as in his general treatise. He first\r\ndemonstrated the existence of many osseous and other tumours of the\r\nparts of the ear and of the ossicles of the tympanum, and also the\r\nfact that the Eustachian tube leading from the back of the throat\r\ninto the tympanum remains always closed except during the momentary\r\nact of swallowing.\r\n\r\nA premature end came to Toynbee’s energetic and benevolent life.\r\nAlways active in experimental research, and much concerned in\r\naural therapeutics, he experimented on himself with chloroform,\r\nand it is believed, prussic acid vapour, which he wished to cause\r\nto enter by the Eustachian tube into the tympanum for the relief\r\nof tinnitus aurium or noises in the ears. He unfortunately pursued\r\nhis experiments while alone, and was found dead on July 7, 1866, in\r\nhis consulting room at Savile Row, with a pad of cotton wool over\r\nhis face, and chloroform and prussic acid bottles, his open watch,\r\nand various memoranda of experiments near him. His death excited\r\nuniversal sympathy for Mr. Toynbee’s widow and nine children, with\r\nwhom he had lived most happily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf one great aural surgeon became a martyr of science, another was no\r\nless a martyr of philanthropy. The name of JAMES HINTON, which gained\r\nwide celebrity during his lifetime, has been progressively elevated\r\nsince his death by the publication of his “Life and Letters,” by Miss\r\nEllice Hopkins, and of his works on “The Art of Thinking,” 1879,\r\n“Philosophy and Religion,” 1881, and “The Law-Breaker, and the Coming\r\nof the Law,” 1884. Even yet, fortunately, much more may be hoped for,\r\nin the shape more especially of an autobiography, and of a work on\r\nEthics.\r\n\r\nIt has become increasingly evident that James Hinton was, if not\r\na true genius, a man who approached very nearly to that altitude\r\nof nature. As Mr. Shadworth Hodgson remarks in the introduction to\r\nthe “Chapters on the Art of Thinking,” Hinton is a hander-on of\r\nColeridge’s torch, with less of systematic theology and more of\r\nemotional spiritualism. It is quite impossible to attempt here to\r\nsketch his various philosophical contributions. Indeed the time has\r\nnot yet fully come to estimate them, their influence, or the man who\r\ngave birth to them. As an aural surgeon he perhaps scarcely rose to\r\nToynbee’s level, but this was rather because the greatness of his\r\nmind and soul in vaster fields overpowered him, than from defect of\r\nability. An outline of his life and work only can here be given.\r\n\r\nJames Hinton was the third child (of eleven) of the well-known\r\nBaptist minister, John Howard Hinton, having been born at Reading in\r\n1822. His father’s mother was aunt to Isaac Taylor, the author of\r\nthe “Natural History of Enthusiasm.” It was from his mother, Eliza\r\nBirt, however, that James Hinton derived most. She is described as a\r\nfervent, lofty-souled woman, full of enthusiasm and compassion, yet\r\ndignified and able to rule others with mild but irresistible sway.\r\n\r\nAs a little child, James Hinton, though sweet-tempered, showed a\r\nstrong tendency to investigate everything, and to rearrange the\r\nelder children’s games “as they ought to be.” The father taught the\r\nchildren to be keenly observant of natural history. The mother bred\r\nthem up to have an instinctive feeling for religion, especially in\r\nits aspect of love to God. An elder brother, Howard, died when James\r\nwas but twelve, and this bereavement made such an impression upon him\r\nthat he soon after was baptized and publicly received as a member of\r\nthe Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nAt school James Hinton did not show special ability, though he had\r\na remarkable verbal memory until a certain period, when he suddenly\r\nlost it without any special cause. In 1838 his father left Reading\r\nfor London, becoming minister of the Devonshire Square Chapel.\r\nFeeling some pressure of circumstances with his large family, Mr.\r\nHinton placed James in the first situation which presented itself,\r\nviz., that of cashier at a wholesale woollen-draper’s shop in\r\nWhitechapel. This temporary immersion in proximity to some of the\r\ncoarsest scenes imaginable had a very deep influence in educing the\r\nthoroughgoing altruism which afterwards characterised him.\r\n\r\nAfter holding the Whitechapel situation about a year, and spending\r\nsome time in search of a more suitable occupation, Hinton became a\r\nclerk in an insurance office in the city. Here, while not becoming\r\nan adept at book-keeping, he sat up at night and gave himself a\r\nmiscellaneous education. At this time he has been described as\r\n“an abstract idea untidily expressed;” he was wholly indifferent\r\nto appearances, and his clothes could never be made to fit him;\r\nand he was often guilty of lapses from politeness. He was full of\r\nargumentativeness, and determined to get to the bottom of everything.\r\n\r\nA little later his intense intellectual labours, combined with the\r\ndeep sense he now and ever after entertained of the wrongs to which\r\nwomen were subjected, brought him into a state of mind in which he\r\nresolved to run away to sea. His intention being discovered, his\r\nfather consulted a doctor about him, who wisely advised that he\r\nshould enter the medical profession, as being more fitted to give\r\nscope for his mental powers. He was consequently entered at St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital at the age of twenty. He was able to perform\r\nhis entire course of medical study with very great rapidity, and\r\nbefore taking his diploma went on a voyage to China and back as\r\nsurgeon of a passenger ship. On his return in 1847 be became a member\r\nof the College of Surgeons, and settled for a time as a surgeon’s\r\nassistant at Newport in Essex.\r\n\r\nHe did not remain here long, but in the autumn of 1847 took the\r\nposition of surgeon to a shipload of freed slaves who were to be\r\nshipped by voluntary agreement from Sierra Leone to Jamaica. He\r\nremained for more than a year after this in Jamaica, taking the\r\npractice of a medical man in ill-health, and looking after the\r\nprogress of his late charges. In 1849-50 he travelled homewards by\r\nway of New Orleans, where he gained further insight into the slavery\r\nquestion. In 1850 he entered into partnership with a Mr. Fisher, a\r\nsurgeon in general practice in Bartholomew Close; and became engaged\r\nto Miss Margaret Haddon, after an attachment of ten years.\r\n\r\nIn August 1850 we find the first note of his success in aural\r\nsurgery; he cured his mother’s deafness by a syringing properly\r\nperformed. Some other cases of success followed this, and were very\r\ncheering. Soon after this he was introduced to Mr. Toynbee, and spent\r\nmuch time with him both at St. Mary’s Hospital and privately. Yet\r\nhe did not find anything in practice large enough to satisfy his\r\naspirations. “Too many things crowd upon me; none _commands_ me,”\r\nhe writes March 1851. “The thing which shall fill my heart must be\r\nnot for myself but for others. To be contented I must toil not for\r\ncomfort, nor money, nor for fame, nor for love, but for truth and\r\nrighteousness.”\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Hinton’s marriage with Miss Haddon took place, one of\r\nsingularly deep affection. He was now in practice for himself,\r\nfinding general practice not very profitable, especially as he\r\nwould not condescend to use arts to obtain success. He continued\r\nhis study of aural surgery, and assisted Mr. Toynbee largely in the\r\nclassification of his museum, already alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Hinton published his earliest papers on physiology and ethics\r\nin the _Christian Spectator_. In 1858 he contributed an essay to the\r\n_Medico-Chirurgical Review_ on “Physical Morphology,” suggesting that\r\norganic growth takes place in the direction of least resistance—a\r\nconception utilised by Mr. Herbert Spencer in his “First Principles.”\r\nIn 1859 “Man and his Dwelling-place” was published and favourably\r\nreceived. Its success encouraged him to lay aside practice, reduce\r\nhis expenses to a minimum, and take to writing as a profession. He\r\nsettled in a little house at Tottenham, where his sitting-room was of\r\nsuch dimensions that he used to say he could open the door with one\r\nhand, poke the fire with the other, and had nature given him a third,\r\nopen the window with it, without rising from his seat.\r\n\r\nAt first success attended the venture. Thackeray accepted for the\r\n_Cornhill Magazine_ the series of “Physiological Riddles,” with the\r\nremark “Whatever else this fellow can do, he can write!” These were\r\nafterwards published, with others, under the title “Life in Nature.”\r\n“Thoughts on Health” were also contributed to the _Cornhill_. But his\r\nmind continued in such activity of growth, ever full, ever changing,\r\nthat he had not time to write his thoughts in form for publication,\r\nand he was forced back into practice, which he had not quite\r\nrenounced, continuing to see a few aural patients twice a week at\r\nhis father’s house. In 1863 he was appointed aural surgeon to Guy’s\r\nHospital, and took a house in George Street, Hanover Square, for the\r\npurpose of aural practice. With heroic and costly resolution, knowing\r\nhe could not adequately do his work as an aural surgeon and devote\r\nhimself to philosophy, he locked his manuscripts away from his sight.\r\n\r\nHenceforward he rapidly succeeded in practice. In 1866 he took the\r\nplace vacated by the death of his valued friend Toynbee, removing to\r\nhis house in Savile Row. When in full practice, and not allowing\r\nhimself to write, his chief life was in conversation. A few lines may\r\nbe here quoted from Miss Hopkins’ Life of Hinton. “It is difficult to\r\ngive any adequate idea of the charms of Mr. Hinton’s conversation to\r\na mind at all in harmony with his own. His most marked peculiarity\r\nwas the intensely emotional character of his intellect. Nature to him\r\nwas no cold abstraction, no cunningly contrived machine made up of\r\nmatter and force, but a mighty spiritual presence, a living being,\r\ntenderly and passionately beloved. The laws of nature were to him the\r\nhabits of a dear and intimate friend.... But keen as was his delight\r\nin purely intellectual operations, he valued everything chiefly,\r\nif not only, in its relation to the moral.... How often, from some\r\ncomparatively remote region of thought, or of art, would he flash\r\ndown a light upon some practical matter, showing perhaps a neglected\r\nduty in its vital relations, or revealing an order in what looked\r\nlike moral waste and confusion. Owing to this strong recognition of\r\nthe spiritual unity of all life, never was there a man in whom the\r\nbarrier between the religious and the secular was more completely\r\neffaced.”\r\n\r\nIn 1869 his success in aural surgery was so assured, that an eminent\r\nsurgeon suggested to Mr. Hinton that he might justifiably resume his\r\nphilosophy as an evening recreation. So after six years’ abstinence\r\nhe resumed his writing. But his thoughts, allowed once more to spring\r\ninto full activity, were certain to master him. “Wherever he was, at\r\na friend’s house, in the street, at church, at a concert, he jotted\r\ndown his notes on scraps of paper, backs of envelopes, bills, and\r\nprogrammes, writing them out in full in the evening.” Finally, these\r\nthoughts were printed for his own private use, and from them a great\r\nportion of his posthumous works is derived.\r\n\r\nAt last he had made money enough by practice to retire. His parting\r\ngift to his profession was contained in “The Questions of Aural\r\nSurgery,” a work of standard value; and his “Atlas of Diseases\r\nof the Membrana Tympani.” In March 1874 he retired, but with a\r\nconstitution deeply injured by overwork and excess of feeling and\r\nthought. His father had died the year before; his mother died in\r\n1874. He continued incessantly working, writing, thinking, studying\r\nmankind in the streets and alleys of London, or in the colliers’\r\ncottages in South Wales, and came to suffer much from sleeplessness.\r\nWhen he set sail in the autumn of 1875 for the Azores, where Mrs.\r\nHinton had preceded him, he was already seriously ill. At last he\r\nwas seized with inflammation of the brain, and died on December 16,\r\n1875, a martyr to his intense passion for the good of mankind. Of\r\nhis intellectual, ethical, and religious views this is not the place\r\nto speak at large; his books must be left to explain themselves to\r\nkindred spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Reprinted by the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by\r\nResearch, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n_SIR R. CHRISTISON, SWAINE TAYLOR, AND POISON DETECTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the detection of crimes of poisoning is but one of the\r\ndepartments of service which the medical profession is able to render\r\nto the law, yet it is one which has very largely attracted public\r\nattention, owing to the many awful aspects of death by poisoning,\r\nand the helplessness which mankind has always felt in regard to\r\nthese crimes. Latterly the skill displayed in the detection of the\r\nexistence of poisons after the death of the victims has set at\r\nrest many of the doubts as to the certainty of judgment in regard\r\nto poisoning, and the discovery of antidotes to many poisons has\r\nsupplied a means of remedy in numerous cases before it is too late.\r\nIt is obvious that these results could only begin to be realised when\r\nchemistry had made considerable progress; and consequently it was not\r\ntill 1813 that a young doctor, the celebrated Orfila, published in\r\nParis the first part of a treatise on Poisons, which was subsequently\r\nmerged in his “Legal Medicine,” 1821-3. The names most conspicuous in\r\nfounding this new department of investigation in Great Britain are\r\nthose which stand at the head of this chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT CHRISTISON, one of the twin sons of Alexander Christison,\r\nmany years Professor of Humanity in Edinburgh University, was born\r\nat Edinburgh in July 18, 1797. After a complete education, in arts\r\nat the University, he finally chose the medical profession, and was\r\nfor two years and a half resident assistant in the Royal Infirmary.\r\nTaking his M.D. degree in 1819, he spent the next eighteen months at\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, and in Paris, where he worked\r\nin the laboratory of Robiquet at practical chemistry, and studied\r\ntoxicology with Orfila himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Christison was about to leave Paris, Dr. Gregory’s death\r\nled to a vacancy in the Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at Edinburgh,\r\nand Christison was proposed to fill it while still absent. It is\r\nsignificant of the state of knowledge that not one of the candidates\r\nbesides Christison had any practical knowledge of chemistry. The\r\ninfluence of Lord Melville, however, who had been his father’s\r\nresident pupil when young Christison was born, was the determining\r\ncause of his success in the election.\r\n\r\nAt first students were very few, not half-a-dozen attending the\r\nearliest course. Christison devoted himself with characteristic\r\nenergy to make his chair a real influence in the university. And here\r\nwe may remark briefly on the extraordinary vigour of constitution\r\nwhich the new professor possessed, and retained almost till death. He\r\ncould walk, run, or row better and with more endurance than any man\r\nof his time in Edinburgh, and that is saying a great deal. He made\r\nhis new chair his primary object. Being an extremely neat and clean\r\nworker in the laboratory, his investigations soon became noted, and\r\nit was found, when he was called in to give evidence on matters of\r\nmedical jurisprudence, especially in poisoning cases, that his mind\r\nwas equally clear and accurate, and that he could give reasons for\r\nhis beliefs which rendered his statements unimpeachable. From the\r\nfamous trial of Burke and Hare in 1829 down to 1866 Dr. Christison\r\nappeared as a scientific witness in almost every case of medico-legal\r\nimportance in Scotland, and in many in England.\r\n\r\n“As a witness,” says the _Scotsman_ (Jan. 28, 1882), “he was\r\nremarkable for a lucid precision of statement, which left no shadow\r\nof doubt in the mind of court, counsel, or jury as to his views.\r\nAnother noteworthy characteristic was the candour and impartiality he\r\ninvariably displayed, and which, backed as it was by the confidence\r\nthat came of mature deliberation, rendered him almost impregnable to\r\ncross-examination. This was notably illustrated in the celebrated\r\nPalmer trial. Some of the medical witnesses for the Crown had got so\r\nseverely handled by the prisoner’s counsel that the case seemed in\r\ndanger of breaking down, but Christison had not been long in the box\r\nwhen the lawyers found they had at last met one who was a match for\r\nthe subtlest of them: and so complete was the failure of all their\r\nefforts to discredit his evidence, that the case, by the time he\r\nfinished, had assumed the gravest possible complexion.”\r\n\r\nAs a persevering experimentalist, Christison was daring even to\r\nrashness in making trials on himself. He thus tested the taste of\r\narsenious acid, which was held by Orfila and most others to be rough\r\nand acrid, and which he proved to be rather sweet. He ate an ounce\r\nof the root of _Œnanthe crocata_, which had stood most poisonous in\r\nEngland and on the Continent; but the Scotch specimen at any rate did\r\nnot poison Dr. Christison. A most striking risk was run in the case\r\nof the Calabar bean. He took a dose before going to bed, and found\r\nits effects resembled those of opium. Not satisfied, he took a larger\r\ndose next morning on rising, with the result of almost paralysing\r\nhim. But he fortunately had a good emetic close at hand, a bowl of\r\nshaving water, and administering a large quantity, he was partially\r\nrelieved. But much prostration remained, and medical assistance had\r\nto be summoned.\r\n\r\nChristison’s principal services to the literature of his subject\r\nconsisted in his work on Poisons, which was first published in 1829,\r\nand went through several successive editions, and in numerous memoirs\r\nand papers contributed to medical and scientific journals, some of\r\nwhich detailed improved chemical processes and tests for poisons,\r\nas those on “The Detection of Minute Quantities of Arsenic in Mixed\r\nFluids,” “On the Taste of Arsenic, and on its Property of Preserving\r\nthe Bodies of Persons who have been Poisoned with it,” and on the\r\npoisonous properties of numerous vegetable alkaloids.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 Christison, having raised his class to no fewer than ninety\r\nstudents, resigned his chair on appointment to that of Materia\r\nMedica, intending to become, in addition to a clinical teacher of\r\nmedicine, an original investigator on the therapeutical action of\r\nremedies. But before he had got fully afloat in this, practice, for\r\nwhich he had not specially laid himself out, flowed in upon him, and\r\nprevented the realisation of his desire. He accumulated a fine museum\r\nof materia medica, and his lectures were very popular. But it cannot\r\nbe said that he left his mark on medicine or therapeutics to the same\r\nextent that he did on toxicology.\r\n\r\nChristison was eminently a lover of his university, and exceedingly\r\nconscious of its great merits. In numerous matters he was very\r\nconservative, and strongly resisted some modern views of pneumonia\r\nand fevers. He wielded great influence for many years in the\r\nadministration of university matters. In 1838 and in 1846 he was\r\nPresident of the Edinburgh College of Physicians. From 1868 to 1873\r\nhe was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1857 to 1873\r\nhe occupied a seat at the General Medical Council. After having been\r\nfor many years Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen in Scotland, Dr.\r\nChristison received a baronetcy in 1871, on the recommendation of Mr.\r\nGladstone. In the same year his bust by Brodie was presented to the\r\nuniversity, by general subscription among the medical profession.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Sir Robert Christison completed his fiftieth year of active\r\nservice as professor in the university, the only case of the kind\r\nthat had ever occurred; and a large and enthusiastic assembly\r\nentertained him at dinner. Further honours still awaited him; he was\r\nin 1875 elected President of the British Medical Association at its\r\nEdinburgh meeting; and in 1876 he was selected for the Presidency\r\nof the British Association, a distinction which however he declined\r\non the ground of his advanced age. He soon afterwards retired from\r\nactive duty; but lived in considerable vigour till about Christmas\r\n1881. He died on January 23, 1882, in his eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\n“As regards his personal characteristics,” says the _Scotsman_, “Sir\r\nRobert was perhaps liable to be somewhat misunderstood by those who\r\ndid not know him. Dogmatic and positive in his opinions, he was\r\ninclined to lay down the law in a way that might not always be quite\r\nagreeable.... On the other hand, friends who had the good fortune to\r\nknow him intimately found in his nature a fund of geniality such as\r\nthe casual observer could never have dreamt of. Warmth of heart and\r\nsimple unaffected kindness would seem to have been distinguishing\r\nqualities of his private and social demeanour.” He was a strong\r\nChurchman and Tory. He married in 1827 a Miss Brown, who died in\r\n1849, leaving three sons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome years younger than Christison, ALFRED SWAINE TAYLOR was\r\ncontemporary through life with him, and occupied for many years a\r\nquite exceptional position in the English mind in connection with the\r\ndetection of cases of poisoning. He was born at Northfleet in 1806,\r\nand educated at Hounslow. At the early age of sixteen he became the\r\npupil of a surgeon near Maidstone, and in October 1823 entered as a\r\nstudent at Guy’s and St. Thomas’s Hospitals, then forming a united\r\nmedical school. Later on he was exclusively connected with Guy’s as\r\npupil and lecturer until his retirement in 1878.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1826 Taylor gave much attention to medical\r\njurisprudence, although his diligence was such as to win for\r\nhim a prize for anatomy at Guy’s. Chemistry proved a congenial\r\nsubject to him under the instruction of Allen and Aikin, and he\r\nwas further stimulated in the same direction by frequent visits to\r\nParis and all the principal Continental medical schools. At Paris\r\nhe heard among others Orfila and Gay-Lussac. Geology, mineralogy,\r\nand physiology likewise engaged his attention, and so was formed a\r\nmind singularly broad in its views of natural phenomena, and well\r\ncalculated to expound their laws. Taylor passed his examinations\r\nat the Apothecaries’ Hall in 1828 and at the College of Surgeons in\r\n1830, and entered upon practice, continuing, however, to study in the\r\nchemical laboratory of Guy’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when the Apothecaries’ Society first required candidates for\r\ntheir diploma to attend lectures on Medical Jurisprudence, Mr. Taylor\r\nwas appointed to lecture on the subject at Guy’s Hospital, a post\r\nwhich he continued to hold for forty-seven years. In the next year he\r\nsucceeded Mr. Barry as co-lecturer on chemistry with Mr. Aikin, whose\r\ncolleague he continued till 1851, after which he was sole lecturer\r\non chemistry till 1870, when he resigned this lectureship. In these\r\nimportant functions Dr. Taylor acquitted himself admirably. He was\r\nexceedingly clear in his statements, exact and successful in his\r\nexperiments, while yet very undemonstrative in manner.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the new lecturer commenced his long series of memoirs bearing\r\non poisoning, by publishing an account of the Grotto del Cane, near\r\nNaples, with remarks on suffocation by carbonic acid. This appeared\r\nin the _London Medical and Physical Journal_. In subsequent years\r\nhe contributed important papers to Guy’s Hospital Reports, on the\r\naction of water on lead, on poisoning by strychnia, on the tests\r\nfor arsenic and antimony, &c., and was soon a recognised authority\r\non medico-legal questions. He contributed to the _London Medical\r\nand Physical Journal_ valuable memoirs on poisoning, child-murder,\r\n&c. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work on medical\r\njurisprudence which was not completed at that time. In 1842 he\r\nbrought out his well-known “Manual of Medical Jurisprudence,” which\r\nreached its tenth large English edition in 1879, in the author’s\r\nlifetime, in addition to numerous American editions. The Swiney Prize\r\nof 100 guineas, together with a valuable silver vase for a work on\r\nJurisprudence, were also awarded to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, when he became a member of the College of Physicians, Dr.\r\nTaylor published a work on Poisons which was at once accepted as\r\nstandard, and has gone through several editions. In 1865 his large\r\nwork entitled “The Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence”\r\nappeared, including much matter for which there was not space in his\r\nmanuals. This work attained its third edition in 1883, having been\r\nedited by Dr. Thomas Stevenson, his distinguished successor at Guy’s\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nBut this represents only a portion of the literary labours of Dr.\r\nTaylor. From 1844 to 1851 he was the editor of the _London Medical\r\nGazette_, afterwards incorporated with the _Medical Times_. He\r\nlargely co-operated in editing various editions of Pereira’s Materia\r\nMedica. He brought out in conjunction with Professor Brande a Manual\r\nof Chemistry in 1863, and in 1876 edited Dr. Neil Arnott’s celebrated\r\nwork on Physics. He was elected in 1853 Fellow of the College of\r\nPhysicians, having had previously conferred upon him the honorary\r\nM.D. of St. Andrews University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety in 1845. He married in 1834 a Miss Cancellor.\r\n\r\nIt was as a medical witness in important legal cases that Dr. Swaine\r\nTaylor was most widely known. If a case of unusual character was\r\nbefore the courts, it came to be expected that he should be called\r\nas a witness, and for many years he was retained by the Treasury as\r\ntheir medical adviser on such cases. It is impossible here to refer\r\nto the numerous important cases of this character in which Dr. Taylor\r\nfigured. A writer in the _Medical Times_ for June 12 and 19, 1880\r\n(pp. 642, 671), enters into this question from full knowledge, and\r\ndescribes him thus: “Personally Taylor was of a tall and imposing\r\nfigure, gracious to friends and bitter to foes, and, as the lawyers\r\nfound, a superb witness, not to be shaken by any light word of\r\ndoctrine.... There was a thoroughness about Taylor’s work which was\r\nalways satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to the celebrated Palmer trial, Dr. Taylor was severely\r\ncross-examined, and was contradicted in important points by experts\r\ncalled for the defence. In fact, it is possible that the case would\r\nhave gone in favour of the prisoner but for the strong confirmation\r\nof the view of the prosecution given by Dr. Christison, to which we\r\nhave already referred. Dr. Taylor expressed his strong views on this\r\nquestion in an extended pamphlet “On Poisoning by Strychnia,” most of\r\nwhich appeared in Guy’s Hospital Reports for 1856. He died on May 27,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n_PARKES, GUY, SIMON, AND PUBLIC HEALTH._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Prevention is better than cure” is the homely proverb which\r\nmarks out a large proportion of the work of sanitary science. The\r\nprevention of disease and of its spread, and the promotion of the\r\ngeneral healthiness of the people—these are objects which modern\r\nprogress has brought into view. When they are completely attained we\r\nshall all die of old age unless cut off by accidents or violence; and\r\nthis is a goal which many sanitarians of the present day have vividly\r\nbefore their mind.\r\n\r\nThe public health and the public welfare have been sought by no man\r\nmore earnestly than by EDMUND ALEXANDER PARKES. Of him Dr. Russell\r\nReynolds said:[24] “In the combination of moral, mental, and physical\r\nbeauty, Dr. Parkes was to my knowledge never equalled, to my belief\r\ncannot be surpassed. Pure as a sunbeam, strong as a man, tender as a\r\nwoman, keen as any scientist to unravel the hidden mysteries of life\r\nin its minutest detail of chemical and physiological research, yet\r\npractical in the application of his knowledge to the cleansing of a\r\ndrain or the lightening of a knapsack; he made the world much richer\r\nby his life, much poorer by his death.”\r\n\r\nParkes was born on March 29, 1819, in the village of Bloxam,\r\nOxfordshire, his father being Mr. William Parkes, of the Marble-yard,\r\nWarwick, “a man of superior mind, remarkable alike for industry,\r\nfirmness, and nobility of character.”[25] His mother, Frances Byerly,\r\ndaughter of Mr. Thomas Byerly of Etruria, Staffordshire, was much\r\noccupied in literature, and her sister, wife of Professor A. T.\r\nThomson of University College, London, was a well-known biographer\r\nand novelist.\r\n\r\nUnder such favouring influences young Parkes grew up a gentle\r\nbut unusually merry and happy boy. After being educated at the\r\nCharterhouse, he entered as a medical student at University\r\nCollege, and spent much time in his uncle’s laboratory, becoming an\r\nexcellent manipulator, and already showing a fondness for research.\r\nAt the first M.B. examination at London University in 1840 he was\r\nexhibitioner and medallist in anatomy, physiology, and chemistry,\r\nand medallist in materia medica. In 1841 at the final M.B. he was\r\nmedallist in physiology and comparative anatomy, and gained honours\r\nin medicine. He had taken the College of Surgeons’ diploma in 1840.\r\n\r\nOf this period of Parkes’s life Sir William Jenner, an intimate\r\nfellow-student at University College, says:\r\n\r\n“As a student he was distinguished by brightness and cheerfulness,\r\namiability, unselfish willingness to help others at any cost of\r\ntrouble to himself, energy in work, diligence in the using of each\r\nhour for the studies of that hour, the high moral tone that pervaded\r\nhis converse, and above all, and crowning all, by the real living\r\npurity of his being.”\r\n\r\nEarly in 1842 Parkes entered the army medical service, and went as\r\nassistant-surgeon to the 84th regiment to Madras and Moulmein. Here\r\nhe prosecuted inquiries which bore fruit in two small publications\r\non the Dysentery and Hepatitis of India (1846), and on Asiatic\r\nand Algide Cholera (1847). But before this period he had retired\r\nfrom the army and entered upon practice in Upper Seymour Street,\r\nPortman Square, becoming further known as a physician by editing and\r\ncompleting Dr. Thomson’s work on Diseases of the Skin (1850). This\r\nwas only a portion of his literary and original work at this time,\r\nduring which he contributed largely to the _Medical Times_, and from\r\n1852 to 1855 edited the _British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical\r\nReview_, for which difficult task he was exceedingly well fitted.\r\n\r\nHaving been appointed one of the physicians to University College\r\nHospital, his influence was very marked, both on his students and his\r\ncolleagues. One of his pupils, afterwards a distinguished physician,\r\nsaid that he never went round the wards with him without feeling an\r\nintense wish to become better, and at the same time feeling that he\r\ncould become so. In 1855 Parkes delivered the Gulstonian Lectures\r\nat the College of Physicians, taking the subject of Pyrexia, or the\r\nState of Fever.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, when great pressure existed upon the\r\nhospitals at Scutari, Dr. Parkes was selected by Government to\r\nproceed to the seat of war to establish an additional large hospital.\r\nHe fixed upon Rankioi on the Dardanelles, and his choice proved\r\nexcellent. He worked most zealously to make everything as perfect as\r\npossible, and he accomplished much in spite of the red-tape which was\r\nso disastrously prominent in the war administration of that time. He\r\ndid not in any way spare himself, though his constitution had shown\r\nserious signs of weakness in London, when he had had severe attacks\r\nof pneumonia and phlebitis. His report on the work of his hospital at\r\nthe conclusion of the war was a most valuable one, and he gained the\r\nhigh esteem of Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea.\r\n\r\nOne result of the Royal Commission of Investigation into the\r\nadministration of the war was the foundation of the Army Medical\r\nSchool, and Mr. Herbert never showed better judgment than in\r\nselecting Dr. Parkes to be Professor of Military Hygiene in\r\nconnection with it. Consequently he gave up in 1860 his post at\r\nUniversity College; he was appointed Emeritus Professor, and a marble\r\nbust of him was placed in the College museum.\r\n\r\nParkes found that in order adequately to teach the subjects involved\r\nin preserving and promoting the health of the army, he must not only\r\nstudy the special features of army life and the peculiar liabilities\r\nattaching thereto, but also the general science of hygiene, then\r\nalmost new. He organised at the cost of immense labour a detailed\r\nsystem of instruction, based on the principle of making the student\r\napply practically what he taught. All the special questions which\r\ncame up relating to air, water, food, temperature, clothing, house\r\nconstruction, drainage, &c., were as far as possible illustrated in\r\nthe laboratory, and individual instruction was most carefully given.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 was published the first edition of Parkes’s “Manual of\r\nPractical Hygiene,” a masterly book, accurate, learned, clear, full,\r\nand of the highest interest to the thoughtful mind. The introduction\r\nto this work opens with a clear definition of the subject. “Hygiene\r\nis the art of preserving health; that is, of obtaining the most\r\nperfect action of body and mind during as long a period as is\r\nconsistent with the laws of life. In other words, it aims at\r\nrendering growth more perfect, decay less rapid, life more vigorous,\r\ndeath more remote.”\r\n\r\nLater he says: “It is undoubtedly true that we can, even now,\r\nliterally choose between health and disease; not, perhaps, always\r\nindividually, for the sins of our fathers may be visited upon us,\r\nor the customs of our life and the chains of our civilisation and\r\nsocial customs may gall us, or even our fellow-men may deny us\r\nhealth, or the knowledge which leads to health. But, as a race, man\r\nholds his own destiny, and can choose between good and evil; and as\r\ntime unrolls the scheme of the world, it is not too much to hope\r\nthat the choice will be for good.” He further powerfully indicates\r\nthe basis of state medicine, to secure for all individuals the\r\nconditions of health which they often cannot secure for themselves.\r\nHe shows too that self-interest, state-benefit, and pecuniary profit\r\nare at one in these matters when rightly understood. “It is but too\r\ncommonly forgotten,” he says, “that the whole nation is interested\r\nin the proper treatment of every one of its members, and in its own\r\ninterest has a right to see that the relations between individuals\r\nare not such as in any way to injure the well-being of the community\r\nat large.” It is almost needless to add that numerous editions of\r\nParkes’s Practical Hygiene have been called for; it has also been\r\ntranslated into several foreign languages.\r\n\r\nWe have enumerated, however, but a small portion of the subjects\r\nupon which Parkes’s unceasing philanthropic activity was exercised.\r\nFor many years he wrote an annual review of the Progress of Hygiene,\r\ncontributed to the Army Medical Reports. He served on many public\r\ninquiries relating to matters of health, and did more for the\r\ndiminution of mortality in the army than any other man. He carried\r\non many protracted and difficult physiological investigations, such\r\nas those on the effects of diet and exercise, on the elimination of\r\nnitrogen, on the effects of alcohol on the human body, on the effects\r\nof coffee, extract of meat, and alcohol on men marching, chiefly\r\ncontributed to the Royal Society. As a member of the Senate of London\r\nUniversity, and of the General Medical Council, and as Secretary to\r\nthe Senate of the Army Medical School, he performed detailed work of\r\nthe highest value, and all in spite of delicate health.\r\n\r\n“With increase of years,” says Sir William Jenner,[26] “his mind\r\nripened, his sphere of action widened, his influence over others\r\noperated in new and perhaps more important ways; but in all moral\r\nand intellectual essentials Dr. Parkes was as a man what he was\r\nas a youth—he was animated by the same principles and stimulated\r\nby the same faith. As years went on his mind proved itself to be\r\nsingularly well balanced; he possessed an extraordinary power of\r\nacquiring information; his memory was very retentive; he was the\r\nbest-informed man in the medical literature of the century I ever\r\nmet; he was unprejudiced as he was learned; he could use with ease\r\nthe information he acquired, and could express his ideas clearly and\r\nsimply; his language was always elegant, and on occasions eloquent.\r\nHis powers of observation, of perception, of reasoning, and of\r\njudgment were all good, and equally good. But as in his youth,\r\nso in his manhood, the beauty of his moral nature, his unselfish\r\nloving-kindness, his power of inoculating others with his own love\r\nof truth, with his own sense of the necessity of searching for the\r\ntruth, of questioning nature till she yield up the truth, of earnest\r\nwork, were his most striking characteristics.”\r\n\r\nAt last the seeds of weakness which were constitutional in Parkes\r\ndeveloped into acute tuberculosis, and he died on March 15, 1875,\r\nafter an illness of four months. His domestic life had been a very\r\nhappy one, but his wife, a Miss Chattock, whom he married in 1851,\r\nhad died in 1873, and he was much broken by her loss. He left no\r\nchildren. His monument is in the Parkes Museum of Hygiene, which\r\nenforces eloquently the lessons of his life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. WILLIAM AUGUSTUS GUY, F.R.S., is one of the most eminent of\r\nmodern promoters of the public health. He was born at Chichester\r\nin the year 1810, his ancestors for three generations having been\r\nmedical practitioners there. His grandfather, William Guy, was a\r\npupil of John Hunter, and in Hayley’s life of Romney it is stated\r\nthat “Cowper said of him that he won his heart at first sight, and\r\nRomney (who painted his portrait) declared that he had never examined\r\nany manly features which he would sooner choose for a model if he had\r\noccasion to represent the compassionate benignity of the Saviour.”[27]\r\n\r\nAfter a childhood spent with this estimable grandfather, young Guy\r\nwas educated at Christ’s Hospital, and later studied for five years\r\nat Guy’s Hospital. Winning the Fothergillian medal of the Medical\r\nSociety of London for the best essay on Asthma, in 1831, at the early\r\nage of twenty-one, he was encouraged to enter at Cambridge, where,\r\nafter a further period of two years spent at Heidelberg and Paris, he\r\ntook his M.B. degree in 1837.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Dr. Guy became Professor of Forensic Medicine in King’s\r\nCollege, London, and later Assistant-Physician to King’s College\r\nHospital. He early directed his attention to statistics, and joined\r\nthe Statistical Society in 1839, and became one of its honorary\r\nsecretaries in 1843. 1844 he contributed important evidence\r\nbefore the Health of Towns Commission, on the state of the London\r\nprinting-offices, and the consequent development of pulmonary\r\nconsumption among printers. He co-operated in founding the Health\r\nof Towns Association, and has been incessantly occupied in public\r\nlectures, investigations, and writings, in calling attention to\r\nquestions of sanitary reform. He has been notably concerned in the\r\nimprovement of ventilation, the utilisation of sewage, the health\r\nof bakers and soldiers, hospital mortality, and many other like\r\nsubjects. In 1873 he was President of the Statistical Society, and he\r\nhas successively been Croonian, Lumleian, and Harveian Lecturer at\r\nthe College of Physicians. His various publications and papers are\r\ntoo numerous to recount. We may, however, mention the “Principles of\r\nForensic Medicine,” and successive editions of Hooper’s “Physicians’\r\nVade Mecum.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN SIMON, C.B., F.R.S., is one of the veterans of the present\r\nday in matters of public health, besides having the highest\r\nreputation as a surgeon and pathologist. Born in 1816, Mr. Simon was\r\na student of King’s College, London, and was elected a fellow of the\r\nCollege of Surgeons in 1844. He was appointed in 1847 lecturer on\r\nPathology at St. Thomas’s Hospital. His subsequent researches and\r\nwritings, especially those on Inflammation, have proved his great\r\nfitness for the post. In 1850 he published a very original course of\r\nlectures on General Pathology, as conducive to the establishment of\r\nRational Principles for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Disease.\r\n\r\nMr. Simon’s career in connection with public health began with his\r\nbeing appointed the first Medical Officer of Health to the City of\r\nLondon. He was before long selected as medical adviser to the General\r\nBoard of Health, and was thence transferred to the important post of\r\nmedical officer to the Privy Council. In this capacity his labours,\r\nably seconded by a crowd of zealous workers, have been of priceless\r\nvalue to the nation at large. The successive annual reports published\r\nby the Privy Council sufficiently attest this.\r\n\r\nIn his first report to the Privy Council, Mr. Simon stated “that\r\nmore than half of our annual mortality results from diseases which\r\nprevail with a very great range of difference in proportion as\r\nsanitary circumstances are bad or good; that, according to the latest\r\navailable evidence, some of these diseases prevail twice or thrice,\r\nsome of them ten or twenty times, some of them even forty or fifty\r\ntimes, as fatally in some districts as in other districts of England;\r\nthat the result of their excessive partial development is to render\r\nthe mortality of certain districts from 50 to 100 per cent. higher\r\nthan the mortality of other districts, and to raise the death-rate of\r\nthe whole country 33 per cent. above the death-rate of its healthiest\r\nparts.”\r\n\r\nIn his eleventh report Mr. Simon was able to write as follows: “It\r\nwould, I think, be difficult to over-estimate, in one most important\r\npoint of view, the progress which, during the last few years, has\r\nbeen made in sanitary legislation. The principles now affirmed in\r\nour statute-book are such as, if carried into full effect, would\r\nsoon reduce to quite an insignificant amount our present very large\r\nproportions of preventable disease.... Large powers have been given\r\nto local authorities, and obligation expressly imposed on them,\r\nas regards their respective districts, to suppress all kinds of\r\nnuisance, and to provide all such works and establishments as the\r\npublic health primarily requires; while auxiliary powers have been\r\ngiven for more or less optional exercise in matters deemed of less\r\nthan primary importance to health.... The State ... has interfered\r\nbetween parent and child ... between employer and employed ...\r\nbetween vendor and purchaser; has put restrictions on the sale\r\nand purchase of poisons; has prohibited in certain cases certain\r\ncommercial supplies of water; and has made it a public offence to\r\nsell adulterated food, or drink, or medicine, or to offer for sale\r\nany meat unfit for human food.... Its care for the treatment of\r\ndisease has not been unconditionally limited to treating at the\r\npublic expense such sickness as may accompany destitution; it has\r\nprovided that in any sort of epidemic emergency, organised medical\r\nassistance, not peculiarly for paupers, may be required of local\r\nauthorities; and in the same spirit requires that vaccination at the\r\npublic cost shall be given gratuitously to every claimant.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simon has been a distinguished surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital,\r\nand attained some years ago the Presidency of the College of\r\nSurgeons.

NICOLL. (Printed from a new font of old-faced\r\n  type.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—This is a complete, unabridged edition of Defoe’s\r\n  masterpiece, with all the 22 beautiful Illustrations from the\r\n  Drawings by THOMAS STOTHARD, R.A., engraved by CHARLES HEATH.\r\n  These Illustrations are now printed from the Original Copper\r\n  Plates, which were produced at great cost, and are still in perfect\r\n  condition, having been steel-faced to preserve them. Copies of\r\n  the Original Edition with these same plates, published by Messrs.\r\n  Cadell and Davis in 1820, now fetch a high price.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hogg is to be thanked for re-issuing the ‘Life and Adventures\r\nof Robinson Crusoe,’ with Stothard’s twenty-two designs engraved\r\non copper by Charles Heath. Their charm is irresistible, and as\r\nbook prints they rank among the classics of English art. They are\r\ndelightful works. The text before us is complete, and well printed in\r\na clear type. This edition is, therefore, excellent.”—_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n“It was a happy idea of Mr. Hogg to secure the original\r\ncopper-plates, and to present his handsome edition of Defoe’s\r\nmasterpiece with the most appropriate illustrations that it ever\r\nreceived. The whole of the twenty-two engravings are given, and we\r\ncan congratulate the admirers of the immortal tale, which has been\r\nmore truthfully and tenderly illustrated by Stothard than by any\r\nother artist.”—_Queen._\r\n\r\n“This is truly an _edition de luxe_ of Defoe’s masterpiece. It is\r\nbeautifully printed and enriched with twenty-two full-page engravings\r\nfrom the drawings of Thomas Stothard, R.A., and altogether is a book\r\nto please the eye and delight the heart of all who have ‘a weak side’\r\nto our sterling old British classics.”—_North British Daily Mail._\r\n\r\n“An admirable edition of the immortal ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ adorned with\r\nengravings from Stothard’s celebrated designs, forming a sumptuous\r\npresent.”—_Truth._\r\n\r\n“The plates come out in this edition with the sharpness of their\r\nearliest days, and are full of force and grace. Those who get this\r\ncopy of Defoe’s great work will indeed have a pleasure.”—_Scotsman._\r\n\r\n“A book which many would desire to have on their shelves in\r\ncommon with other English classics. Small editions are numerous\r\nenough, but Mr. John Hogg now supplies us with a handsome library\r\nvolume, which, moreover, has the advantage of Stothard’s exquisite\r\ndesigns engraved by Heath. The volume, a full-size 8vo., finely\r\nprinted with wide margins, has a critical introduction by Henry J.\r\nNicoll.”—_Bookseller._\r\n\r\n“An edition printed in fine bold type, and containing reproductions\r\nof Stothard’s well-known illustrations. And, what is more,\r\nit contains not only the ‘Adventures’ but also the ‘Further\r\nAdventures’ of Robinson Crusoe, which are often omitted from popular\r\neditions.”—_St. James’s Gazette._\r\n\r\n“This is one of the handsomest editions of Defoe’s immortal work\r\nwhich we have seen an _edition de luxe_, indeed. It is a trite,\r\nbut in this case a perfectly fitting statement, that Mr. Hogg has\r\nspared no expense in the production of what is at once a beautiful\r\ngift-book, and an equally beautiful volume for the drawing-room\r\ntable.”—_Manchester Weekly Post._\r\n\r\n“_Editions de luxe_ of standard works being in constant demand,\r\nMr. Hogg has done well to add to the list this handsome edition of\r\nDefoe’s masterpiece. Stothard’s designs, it need scarcely be said,\r\nare greatly superior to the ordinary run of book engravings, being\r\nadmirable alike as illustrations and on account of their intrinsic\r\nmerits. Altogether the book may be confidently recommended to those\r\nwho desire to possess a library edition of a work which seems\r\nlikely to maintain its proud pre-eminence, and it would not be easy\r\nto find a work better adapted in all respects for presentation\r\npurposes.”—_Aberdeen Free Press._\r\n\r\n“Everybody may not be aware of this latest and most beautiful edition\r\nof the adventures of the old York mariner. We may say then, without\r\nqualification, that this volume is one of the most elegant that has\r\ncome out of the press this season. The sketch of Defoe is very well\r\ndone.”—_Yorkshire Gazette._\r\n\r\n“Few of the many reprints of works of acknowledged excellence that\r\nhave been recently published will surpass the one now under notice in\r\nintrinsic worth.”—_Glasgow Herald._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROVERB STORIES FOR BOYS AND GIRLS._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSmall crown 8vo., cloth, 256 pp., with 36 Illustrations, price 2s.\r\n6d.; gilt edges, 3s.\r\n\r\n  =Every Cloud has its Silver Lining=, and other Proverb Stories\r\n  for Boys and Girls.

All the recipes are clear and well\r\nconveyed, and they will enable anyone who chooses to follow them to\r\nproduce capital cookery.”—_Scotsman._\r\n\r\n“The contents of the volume are varied, much attention being\r\nbestowed on Scotch dishes, and it is something to say in this age\r\nof many cookery-books, that the recipes given are not fanciful, but\r\npractical.

Biography and history are\r\ncombined with criticism, so that the men are seen as well as their\r\nworks....

I hope one of the effects of our better public\r\n  education will be to create among our population a more humane\r\n  disposition towards what we call the inferior animals. Much may be\r\n  done by impressing on the minds of children the duty of kindness in\r\n  their treatment of animals, and I hope this will not be neglected\r\n  by the teachers of our schools.... I feel sure what you have done\r\n  will bear good fruit.—JOHN BRIGHT.”\r\n\r\n  “The _Parlour Menagerie_ is well named.

No words of ours could\r\n  better prove the catholicity of a most instructive and valuable\r\n  work.”—_Peterborough Advertiser._\r\n\r\n  “The work shows very plainly that much care and judgment has been\r\n  used in its compilation....

To young and old alike the book ought to be\r\n  profitable, for from it a very lucid account may be obtained of\r\n  many of those momentous occurrences which have served to swell\r\n  the history of England, and to afford an example to succeeding\r\n  generations.”—_Bazaar._\r\n\r\n  “A delightful volume of adventure.

The book is well written, the\r\n  accounts of naval engagements are graphic and inspiring, and if no\r\n  attempts have been made to write a systematic history of maritime\r\n  enterprise, there is at all events presented a vast mass of\r\n  information in an attractive form.”—_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n  “A flight through the air on the enchanted prayer-carpet would not\r\n  surpass in interest the movement of these narratives from ‘summer\r\n  isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea’ to the iron\r\n  coast of Nova Zembla.”—_Sheffield Independent._\r\n\r\n  “A singularly interesting volume.

Coming down to more modern times, Mr. Stewart gives us\r\n  some stirring episodes in the last American War, the moving tale\r\n  of Arctic Exploration, from the time of Cabot to the Jeannette\r\n  Expedition, and concludes a most interesting and useful volume with\r\n  an account of the famous shipwrecks in recent times.”—_Literary\r\n  Churchman._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH TWELVE ILLUSTRATIONS BY THOMAS STOTHARD, R.A., AND A PORTRAIT OF\r\nDEFOE.\r\n\r\nIn one volume, 512 pp., large crown 8vo., cloth, price 3s. 6d.; gilt\r\nedges, 4s.\r\n\r\n  =The Life and Adventures of Robinson= Crusoe, of York, Mariner.\r\n  With an Account of his Travels round Three Parts of the Globe.\r\n\r\n  ☞ _A complete, unabridged Edition of both Parts, with no\r\n  curtailment of the “Further Adventures.”_\r\n\r\n  “A complete, unabridged edition of ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ in which\r\n  something of the old tone, which has been to a great extent\r\n  sacrificed in modern versions of this boy’s classic, has been\r\n  revived. Twelve of the quaint illustrations by Thomas Stothard,\r\n  engraved by Heath, are given, and are in themselves a sufficient\r\n  reason for giving a specially hearty welcome to this edition of\r\n  Defoe’s masterpiece. But the publication will, in the eyes of\r\n  its young readers at all events, find a higher recommendation in\r\n  the fact that the ‘Further Adventures’ have not been subject to\r\n  their usual curtailment. A short biographical sketch of Defoe and\r\n  Bernard Barton’s ‘Memorial’ of Robinson Crusoe are given by way of\r\n  introduction, and add appreciably to the value of the edition.

Clear\r\n  print, suggestive woodcuts and plenty of them, carefully edited\r\n  versions—what more could be wanted?”—_Bedfordshire Mercury._\r\n\r\n  “A selection of the best stories in the ‘Arabian Nights’\r\n  Entertainments, illustrated with seventy-eight wood engravings.\r\n  The compiler has executed his task with taste and skill, all\r\n  objectionable passages having been removed without any loss of\r\n  spirit.”—_Bristol Mercury._\r\n\r\n  “There is nothing in this selection from the far-famed tales which\r\n  young people may not be permitted to read. We envy the child who\r\n  reads this book. Who is there, indeed, that can forget the time\r\n  when he first read the adventures of Sindbad the Sailor, and the\r\n  story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves?

Here is one published by Mr. John Hogg, with a very\r\n  readable biographical sketch of the author by Dr. Kenneth Mackenzie\r\n  (the original English edition of Andersen’s ‘In Sweden’), and a\r\n  variety of illustrations, including a portrait.”—_St. James’s\r\n  Gazette._\r\n\r\n  “A volume which will be popular with young people.

They show something\r\n  of the same graceful fancy which guided Andersen’s pen. Of the\r\n  singular personality of Andersen himself we get a really valuable\r\n  sketch. Dr. Mackenzie estimates him justly, we think, but not\r\n  unkindly.”—_The Spectator._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH PORTRAIT OF NATHAN MEYER DE ROTHSCHILD.\r\n\r\nSecond edition, crown 8vo., cloth, bevelled boards, price 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  =Fortunate Men: How they made Money= and Won Renown.

With regard to the latter\r\n  object, there is no question of substantial reward to the student,\r\n  and we therefore wish the book success.”—_Glasgow Herald._\r\n\r\n  “There is encouragement for others in its anecdotes, and its advice\r\n  is dictated by morality and common-sense. To carry out its maxims\r\n  might not ensure the making of a fortune during the present times\r\n  of depression, but would secure an honourable business reputation\r\n  under any circumstances.”—_Christian World._\r\n\r\n  “He will be a dull and stupid boy indeed, who, whether fifty\r\n  or fifteen years of age, does not learn something that will be\r\n  valuable from ‘Fortunate Men.’”—_Manchester Weekly Post._\r\n\r\n  “There are passages among these selections which are worthy to\r\n  be inscribed in brass in every place of business. Of worldly\r\n  wisdom we have here huge nuggets, and in the mingled mass much of\r\n  pure gold may be seen. Every young man may read this book with\r\n  profit.”—_Sword and Trowel._\r\n\r\n“_As in every book which Mr. Hogg has sent us, so in this; we have to\r\npraise the typography, the paper, and the strong but also ornamental\r\nbinding._”—MANCHESTER WEEKLY POST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HANDBOOK OF REFERENCE AND QUOTATION.\r\n\r\nSecond edition, fcap. 8vo., cloth, price 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  =Mottoes and Aphorisms from Shakespeare=: Alphabetically arranged;\r\n  with a Copious Index of 9,000 References to the infinitely varied\r\n  Words and Ideas of the Mottoes.
