HARVEY, F.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n  NEW-YORK:\r\n  MOHUN & EBBS,\r\n  BOOKSELLERS, PUBLISHERS & IMPORTERS.\r\n  1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is respectfully dedicated to the Public simply and entirely\r\nfrom an earnest desire to confer a benefit on my fellow creatures.\r\n\r\n                                                                   W. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORPULENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the parasites that affect humanity I do not know of, nor can\r\nI imagine any more distressing than that of Obesity, and having just\r\nemerged from a very long probation in this affliction, I am desirous of\r\ncirculating my humble knowledge and experience for the benefit of my\r\nfellow man, with an earnest hope it may lead to the same comfort and\r\nhappiness I now feel under the extraordinary change--which might almost\r\nbe termed miraculous had it not been accomplished by the most simple\r\ncommon sense means.\r\n\r\nObesity seems to me very little understood or properly appreciated\r\nby the faculty and the public generally, or the former would long\r\nere this have hit upon the cause for so lamentable a disease, and\r\napplied effective remedies, whilst the latter would have spared their\r\ninjudicious indulgence in remarks and sneers, frequently painful\r\nin society, and which, even on the strongest mind, have an unhappy\r\ntendency; but I sincerely trust this humble effort at exposition may\r\nlead to a more perfect ventilation of the subject and a better feeling\r\nfor the afflicted.\r\n\r\nIt would afford me infinite pleasure and satisfaction to name the\r\nauthor of my redemption from this calamity, as he is the only one that\r\nI have been able to find (and my search has not been sparing) who seems\r\nthoroughly up in the question; but such publicity might be construed\r\nimproperly, and I have, therefore, only to offer my personal experience\r\nas to the stepping-stone to public investigation, and to proceed with\r\nmy narrative of facts, earnestly hoping the reader will patiently\r\nperuse and thoughtfully consider it, with forbearance for any fault of\r\nstyle or diction, and for any seeming presumption in publishing it.\r\n\r\nI have felt some difficulty in deciding on the proper and best course\r\nof action. At one time I thought the Editor of the _Lancet_ would\r\nkindly publish a letter from me on the subject, but further reflection\r\nled me to doubt whether an insignificant individual would be noticed\r\nwithout some special introduction. In the April number of the _Cornhill\r\nMagazine_ I read with much interest an article on the subject--defining\r\ntolerably well the effects, but offering no tangible remedy, or even\r\npositive solution of the problem--“What is the Cause of Obesity?” I was\r\npleased with the article as a whole, but objected to some portions,\r\nand had prepared a letter to the Editor of that Magazine offering my\r\nexperience on the subject, but it again struck me that an unknown\r\nindividual like myself would have but little prospect of notice; so I\r\nfinally resolved to publish and circulate this Pamphlet, with no other\r\nreason, motive, or expectation than an earnest desire to help those\r\nwho happen to be afflicted as I was, for that corpulence is remediable\r\nI am well convinced, and shall be delighted if I can induce others to\r\nthink so. The object I have in view impels me to enter into minute\r\nparticulars as well as general observations, and to revert to bygone\r\nyears, in order to show that I have spared no pains nor expense to\r\naccomplish the great end of stopping and curing obesity.\r\n\r\nI am now nearly 66 years of age, about 5 feet 5 inches in stature,\r\nand, in August last (1862), weighed 202 lbs., which I think it right\r\nto name, because the article in the _Cornhill Magazine_ presumes that\r\na certain stature and age should bear, ordinarily, a certain weight,\r\nand I am quite of that opinion. I now weigh 167 lbs., showing a\r\ndiminution of something like 1 lb. per week since August, and having\r\nnow very nearly attained the happy medium, I have perfect confidence\r\nthat a few more weeks will fully accomplish the object for which I\r\nhave labored for the last thirty years, in vain, until it pleased\r\nAlmighty Providence to direct me into the right and proper channel--the\r\n“tram-way,” so to speak--of happy, comfortable existence.\r\n\r\nFew men have led a more active life--bodily or mentally--from a\r\nconstitutional anxiety for regularity, precision, and order, during\r\nfifty years’ business career, from which I have now retired, so\r\nthat my corpulence and subsequent obesity was not through neglect\r\nof necessary bodily activity, nor from excessive eating, drinking,\r\nor self-indulgence of any kind, except that I partook of the simple\r\naliments of bread, milk, butter, beer, sugar, and potatoes more freely\r\nthan my aged nature required, and hence, as I believe, the generation\r\nof the parasite, detrimental to comfort if not really to health.\r\n\r\nI will not presume to descant on the bodily structural tissues, so\r\nfully canvassed in the _Cornhill Magazine_, nor how they are supported\r\nand renovated, having no mind or power to enter into these questions,\r\nwhich properly belong to the wise heads of the Faculty. None of my\r\nfamily on the side of either parent had any tendency to corpulence,\r\nand from my earliest years I had an inexpressible dread of such a\r\ncalamity, so, when I was between thirty and forty years of age, finding\r\na tendency to it creeping upon me, I consulted an eminent surgeon, now\r\nlong deceased--a kind personal friend--who recommended increased bodily\r\nexertion before my ordinary daily labors began, and thought rowing an\r\nexcellent plan. I had the command of a good, heavy, safe boat, lived\r\nnear the river, and adopted it for a couple of hours in the early\r\nmorning. It is true I gained muscular vigor, but with it a prodigious\r\nappetite, which I was compelled to indulge, and consequently increased\r\nin weight, until my kind old friend advised me to forsake the exercise.\r\n\r\nHe soon afterwards died, and, as the tendency to corpulence remained,\r\nI consulted other high orthodox authorities (_never any inferior\r\nadviser_), but all in vain. I have tried sea air and bathing in various\r\nlocalities, with much walking exercise; taken gallons of physic and\r\nliquor potasssæ, advisedly and abundantly; riding on horseback; the\r\nwaters and climate of Leamington many times, as well as those of\r\nCheltenham and Harrogate frequently; have lived upon sixpence a day,\r\nso to speak, and earned it, if bodily labor may be so construed;\r\nand have spared no trouble nor expense in consultations with the\r\nbest authorities in the land, giving each and all a fair time for\r\nexperiment, without any permanent remedy, as the evil still gradually\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nI am under obligations to most of those advisers for the pains and\r\ninterest they took in my case; but only to one for an effectual remedy.\r\n\r\nWhen a corpulent man eats, drinks and sleeps well, has no pain to\r\ncomplain of and no particular organic disease, the judgment of\r\nable men seems paralyzed,--for I have been generally informed that\r\ncorpulence is one of the natural results of increasing years; indeed\r\none of the ablest authorities as a physician in the land told me he\r\nhad gained 1 lb. in weight every year since he attained manhood,\r\nand was not surprised at my condition, but advised more bodily\r\nexercise--vapor-baths, and shampooing, in addition to the medicine\r\ngiven. Yet the evil still increased, and, like the parasite of\r\nbarnacles on a ship, if it did not destroy the structure it obstructed\r\nits fair, comfortable progress in the path of life.\r\n\r\nI have been in dock, perhaps, twenty times in as many years, for the\r\nreduction of this disease, and with little good effect--none lasting.\r\nAny one so afflicted is often subject to public remark, and though in\r\nconscience he may care little about it, I am confident no man laboring\r\nunder obesity can be quite insensible to the sneers and remarks of\r\nthe cruel and injudicious in public assemblies, public vehicles,\r\nor the ordinary street traffic; nor to the annoyance of finding no\r\nadequate space in a public assembly if he should seek amusement or need\r\nrefreshment, and therefore he naturally keeps away as much as possible\r\nfrom places where he is likely to be made the object of the taunts and\r\nremarks of others. I am as regardless of public remark as most men, but\r\nI have felt these difficulties and therefore avoided such circumscribed\r\naccommodation and notice, and by that means have been deprived of many\r\nadvantages to health and comfort.\r\n\r\nAlthough no very great size or weight, still I could not stoop to\r\ntie my shoe, so to speak, nor attend to the little offices humanity\r\nrequires without considerable pain and difficulty, which only the\r\ncorpulent can understand; I have been compelled to go down stairs\r\nslowly backwards, to save the jar of increased weight upon the ankle\r\nand knee joints, and been obliged to puff and blow with every slight\r\nexertion, particularly that of going up stairs. I have spared no\r\npains to remedy this by low living (_moderation and light food_ was\r\ngenerally prescribed, but I had no direct bill of fare to know what\r\nwas really intended), and that, consequently, brought the system into\r\na low impoverished state, without decreasing corpulence, caused many\r\nobnoxious boils, to appear, and two rather formidable carbuncles, for\r\nwhich I was ably operated upon _and fed into increased obesity_.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture (about three years back) Turkish baths became the\r\nfashion, and I was advised to adopt them as a remedy. With the first\r\nfew I found immense benefit in power and elasticity for walking\r\nexercise; so, believing I had found the “philosopher’s stone,” pursued\r\nthem three times a week till I had taken fifty, then less frequently\r\n(as I began to fancy, with some reason, that so many weakened my\r\nconstitution) till I had taken ninety, but never succeeded in losing\r\nmore than 6 lbs. weight during the whole course, and I gave up the plan\r\nas worthless; though I have full belief in their cleansing properties,\r\nand their value in colds, rheumatism, and many other ailments.\r\n\r\nI then fancied increased obesity materially affected a slight\r\numbilical rupture, if it did not cause it, and that another bodily\r\nailment to which I had been subject was also augmented. This led me\r\nto other medical advisers, to whom I am also indebted for much kind\r\nconsideration, though, unfortunately, they failed in relieving me.\r\nAt last, finding my sight failing and my hearing greatly impaired, I\r\nconsulted, in August last, an eminent aural surgeon, who made light of\r\nthe case, looked into my ears, sponged them internally, and blistered\r\nthe outside, without the slightest benefit, neither inquiring into\r\nany of my bodily ailments, which he probably thought unnecessary, nor\r\naffording me even time to name them.\r\n\r\nI was not at all satisfied, but on the contrary was in a worse plight\r\nthan when I went to him; however, he soon after left town for his\r\nannual holiday, which proved the greatest possible blessing to me,\r\nbecause it compelled me to seek other assistance, and happily, I found\r\nthe right man, who unhesitatingly said he believed my ailments were\r\ncaused principally by corpulence, and prescribed a certain diet--no\r\nmedicine, beyond a morning cordial as a corrective--with immense effect\r\nand advantage both to my hearing and the decrease of my corpulency.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of argument and illustration I will presume that certain\r\narticles of ordinary diet, however beneficial in youth, are prejudicial\r\nin advanced life, like beans to a horse, whose common, ordinary food\r\nis hay and corn. It may be useful food occasionally, under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, but detrimental as a constancy. I will, therefore, adopt\r\nthe analogy, and call such food human beans. The items from which I\r\nwas advised to abstain as much as possible were:--Bread, butter, milk,\r\nsugar, beer, and potatoes, which had been the main (and, I thought,\r\ninnocent) elements of my existence, or, at all events, they had for\r\nmany years been adopted freely. These, said my excellent adviser,\r\ncontain starch and saccharine matter, tending to create fat, and should\r\nbe avoided altogether. At the first blush it seemed to me that I had\r\nlittle left to live upon, but my kind friend soon showed me there was\r\nample, and I was only too happy to give the plan a fair trial, and,\r\nwithin a very few days, found immense benefit from it. It may better\r\nelucidate the dietary plan if I describe generally what I have sanction\r\nto take, and that man must be an extraordinary person who would desire\r\na better table:--\r\n\r\n  For breakfast, I take four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys,\r\n    broiled fish, bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork; a large\r\n    cup of tea (without milk or sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce\r\n    of dry toast.\r\n\r\n  For dinner, five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat\r\n    except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast,\r\n    fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or\r\n    three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira--champagne, port\r\n    and beer forbidden.\r\n\r\n  For tea, two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of\r\n    tea without milk or sugar.\r\n\r\n  For supper, three or four ounces of meat or fish, similar to dinner,\r\n    with a glass or two of claret.\r\n\r\n  For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog--(gin, whiskey, or\r\n    brandy, without sugar)--or a glass or two of claret or sherry.\r\n\r\nThis plan leads to an excellent night’s rest, with from six to eight\r\nhours’ sound sleep. The dry toast or rusk may have a table spoonful of\r\nspirit to soften it, which will prove acceptable. Perhaps I did not\r\nwholly escape starchy or saccharine matter, but scrupulously avoided\r\nthose beans, such as milk, sugar, beer, butter, &c., which were known\r\nto contain them.\r\n\r\nOn rising in the morning I take a table spoonful of a special\r\ncorrective cordial, which may be called the Balm of Life, in a\r\nwine-glass of water, a most grateful draught, as it seems to carry away\r\nall the dregs left in the stomach after digestion, but is not aperient;\r\nthen I take 5 or 6 ounces of solid and 8 of liquid for breakfast; 8\r\nounces of solid and 8 of liquid for dinner; 3 ounces of solid and 8 of\r\nliquid for tea; 4 ounces of solid and 6 of liquid for supper, and the\r\ngrog afterwards, if I please. I am not, however, strictly limited to\r\nany quantity at either meal, so that the nature of the food is rigidly\r\nadhered to.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught me to believe that these human beans are the most\r\ninsidious enemies man, with a tendency to corpulence in advanced life,\r\ncan possess, though eminently friendly to youth. He may very prudently\r\nmount guard against such an enemy if he is not a fool to himself, and\r\nI fervently hope this truthful unvarnished tale may lead him to make\r\na trial of my plan, which I sincerely recommend to public notice--not\r\nwith any ambitious motive, but in sincere good faith to help my fellow\r\ncreatures to obtain the marvellous blessings I have found within the\r\nshort period of a few months.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend every corpulent man to rush headlong into such a\r\nchange of diet (_certainly not_), but to act advisedly and after full\r\nconsultation with a physician.\r\n\r\nMy former dietary table was bread and milk for breakfast, or a pint of\r\ntea with plenty of milk and sugar, and buttered toast; meat, beer, much\r\nbread (of which I was always very fond), and pastry for dinner, the\r\nmeal of tea similar to that of breakfast, and generally a fruit tart\r\nor bread and milk for supper. I had little comfort and far less sound\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nIt certainly appears to me that my present dietary table is far\r\nsuperior to the former--more luxurious and liberal, independent of its\r\nblessed effect--but when it is proved to be more healthful, comparisons\r\nare simply ridiculous, and I can hardly imagine any man, even in\r\nsound health, would choose the former, even if it were not an enemy;\r\nbut, when it is shown to be, as in my case, inimical both to health\r\nand comfort, I can hardly conceive there is any man who would not\r\nwillingly avoid it. I can conscientiously assert I never lived so well\r\nas under the new plan of dietary, which I should have formerly thought\r\na dangerous, extravagant trespass upon health. I am very much better,\r\nbodily and mentally, and pleased to believe that I hold the reins of\r\nhealth and comfort in my own hands; and, though at sixty-five years of\r\nage, I cannot expect to remain free from some coming natural infirmity\r\nthat all flesh is heir to, I cannot, at the present time, complain of\r\none. It is simply miraculous, and I am thankful to Almighty Providence\r\nfor directing me, through an extraordinary chance, to the care of a\r\nman who could work such a change in so short a time.\r\n\r\nOh! that the faculty would look deeper into and make themselves better\r\nacquainted with the crying evil of obesity--that dreadful tormenting\r\nparasite on health and comfort. Their fellow men might not descend\r\ninto early premature graves, as I believe many do, from what is termed\r\napoplexy, and certainly would not during their sojourn on earth, endure\r\nso much bodily and consequently mental infirmity.\r\n\r\nCorpulence, though giving no actual pain, as it appears to me, must\r\nnaturally press with undue violence upon the bodily viscera, driving\r\none part upon another and stopping the free action of all. I am sure it\r\ndid in my particular case, and the result of my experience is briefly\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  I have not felt so well as now for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\n  Have suffered no inconvenience whatever in the probational remedy.\r\n\r\n  Am reduced many inches in bulk, and 35 lbs. in weight in thirty-eight\r\n    weeks.\r\n\r\n  Come down stairs forward naturally, with perfect ease.\r\n\r\n  Go up stairs and take ordinary exercise freely, without the slightest\r\n    inconvenience.\r\n\r\n  Can perform every necessary office for myself.\r\n\r\n  The umbilical rupture is greatly ameliorated--and gives me no anxiety.\r\n\r\n  My sight is restored--my hearing improved.\r\n\r\n  My other bodily ailments are ameliorated--indeed almost past into\r\n    matters of history.\r\n\r\nI have placed a thank-offering of £50 in the hands of my kind medical\r\nadviser, for distribution amongst his favorite hospitals, after gladly\r\npaying his usual fees, and still remain under overwhelming obligations\r\nfor his care and attention, which I can never hope to repay. Most\r\nthankful to Almighty Providence for mercies received, and determined to\r\npress the case into public notice as a token of gratitude.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to afford, in conclusion, a satisfactory\r\nconfirmation of my report, in stating that a corpulent friend of mine,\r\nwho, like myself, is possessed of a generally sound constitution, was\r\nlaboring under frequent palpitations of the heart and sensations of\r\nfainting, was, at my instigation, induced to place himself in the hands\r\nof my medical adviser, with the same gradual beneficial results. He\r\nis at present under the same ordeal, and in eight weeks has profited\r\neven more largely than I did in that short period; he has lost the\r\npalpitations, and is becoming, so to speak, a new made man--thankful\r\nto me for advising, and grateful to the eminent counsellor to whom I\r\nreferred him--and he looks forward with good hope to a perfect cure.\r\n\r\nI am fully persuaded that hundreds, if not thousands, of our fellow men\r\nmight profit equally by a similar course; but, constitutions not being\r\nall alike, a different course of treatment may be advisable for the\r\nremoval of so tormenting an affliction.\r\n\r\nMy kind and valued medical adviser is not a doctor for obesity, but\r\nstands on the pinnacle of fame in the treatment of another malady,\r\nwhich, as he well knows is frequently induced by the disease of which\r\nI am speaking, and I sincerely trust most of my corpulent friends\r\n(and there are thousands of corpulent people whom I dare not so rank)\r\nmay be led into my tram-road. To any such I am prepared to offer the\r\nfurther key of knowledge by naming the man. It might seem invidious to\r\ndo so now, but I shall only be too happy, if applied to by letter in\r\ngood faith, or if any doubt should exist as to the correctness of this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n                              WILLIAM BANTING, Sen.,\r\n                     _Late of No. 27, St. James St., Piccadilly_,\r\n                                _Now of No. 4, The Terrace, Kensington_.\r\n\r\n  _May, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving exhausted the first edition (1000 copies) of the foregoing\r\npamphlet; and a period of one year having elapsed since commencing the\r\nadmirable course of diet which has led to such inestimable beneficial\r\nresults, and, “as I expected and desired,” having quite succeeded\r\nin attaining the happy medium of weight and bulk I had so long\r\nineffectually sought, _which appears necessary to health at my age and\r\nstature_--I feel impelled, by a sense of public duty, to offer the\r\nresults of my experience in a second edition. It has been suggested\r\nthat I should have sold the pamphlet, devoting any profit to charity as\r\nmore agreeable and useful; and I had intended to adopt such a course,\r\nbut on reflection feared my motives might be mistaken; I therefore\r\nrespectfully present this (like the first Edition) to the public\r\ngratuitously, earnestly hoping the subject may be taken up by medical\r\nmen and thoroughly ventilated.\r\n\r\nIt may (and I hope will) be as satisfactory to the public to hear as it\r\nis for me to state, that the first edition has been attended with very\r\ncomforting results to other sufferers from corpulence, as the remedial\r\nsystem therein described was to me under that terrible disease, which\r\nwas my main object in publishing my convictions on the subject. It has\r\nmoreover attained a success, produced flattering compliments, and an\r\namount of attention I could hardly have imagined possible. The pleasure\r\nand satisfaction this has afforded me, is ample compensation for the\r\ntrouble and expense I have incurred, and I most sincerely trust, “as I\r\nverily believe,” this second edition will be accompanied by similar\r\nsatisfactory results from a more extensive circulation. If so, it will\r\ninspirit me to circulate further editions, whilst a corpulent person\r\nexists, requiring, as I think, this system of diet, or so long as my\r\nmotives cannot be mistaken, and are thankfully appreciated.\r\n\r\nMy weight is reduced 46 lbs., and as the _very gradual reductions_\r\nwhich I am able to show may be interesting to many, I have great\r\npleasure in stating them, believing they serve to demonstrate further\r\nthe merit of the system pursued.\r\n\r\nMy weight on 26th of August, 1862, was 202 lbs.\r\n\r\n                           lbs.            lbs.\r\n  On 7th September, it was 200, having lost 2\r\n    27th     “        “    197        “     3 more.\r\n    19th October      “    193        “     4  “\r\n     9th November     “    190        “     3  “\r\n     3rd December     “    187        “     3  “\r\n    24th     “        “    184        “     3  “\r\n    14th Jan., 1863   “    182        “     2  “\r\n     4th February     “    180        “     2  “\r\n    25th     “        “    178        “     2  “\r\n    18th March        “    176        “     2  “\r\n     8th April        “    173        “     3  “\r\n    29th   “          “    170        “     3  “\r\n    20th May          “    167        “     3  “\r\n    10th June         “    164        “     3  “\r\n     1st July         “    161        “     3  “\r\n     22d July         “    159        “     2  “\r\n    12th August       “    157        “     2  “\r\n    26th   “          “    156        “     1  “\r\n    12th September    “    156        “     0  “\r\n                                         ----\r\n      Total loss of weight                 46 lbs.\r\n\r\nMy girth is reduced round the waist, in tailor phraseology, 12-1/4\r\ninches, which extent was hardly conceivable even by my friends, or my\r\nrespected medical adviser, until I put on my former clothing, over what\r\nI now wear, which was a thoroughly convincing proof of the remarkable\r\nchange. These important desiderata have been attained by the most easy\r\nand comfortable means, with but little medicine, and almost entirely\r\nby a system of diet that formerly I should have thought dangerously\r\ngenerous. I am told by all who know me that my personal appearance is\r\ngreatly improved, and that I seem to bear the stamp of good health;\r\nthis may be a matter of opinion or friendly remark, but I can honestly\r\nassert that I feel restored in health, “bodily and mentally,” appear to\r\nhave more muscular power and vigor, eat and drink with a good appetite,\r\nand sleep well. All symptoms of acidity, indigestion and heartburn\r\n(with which I was frequently tormented) have vanished. I have left\r\noff using boot hooks, and other such aids, which were indispensable,\r\nbut being now able to stoop with ease and freedom, are unnecessary. I\r\nhave lost the feeling of _occasional faintness_, and what I think a\r\nremarkable blessing and comfort is, that I have been able safely to\r\nleave off knee bandages, which I had worn _necessarily_ for 20 past\r\nyears, and given up a truss almost entirely; indeed, I believe I might\r\nwholly discard it with safety, but am advised to wear it at least\r\noccasionally for the present.\r\n\r\nSince publishing my pamphlet, I have felt constrained to send a copy\r\nof it to my former medical advisers, and to ascertain their opinions\r\non the subject. They did not dispute or question the propriety of the\r\nsystem, but either dared not venture its practice upon a man of my age,\r\nor thought it too great a sacrifice of personal comfort to be generally\r\nadvised or adopted, and I fancy neither of them appeared to feel the\r\nfact of the misery of corpulence. One eminent physician, as I before\r\nstated, assured me that increasing weight was a necessary result of\r\nadvancing years; another, equally eminent, to whom I had been directed\r\nby a very friendly third, who had most kindly but ineffectually failed\r\nin a remedy, added to my weight in a few weeks instead of abating the\r\nevil. These facts lead me to believe the question is not sufficiently\r\nobserved or even regarded.\r\n\r\nThe great charm and comfort of the system is, that its effects are\r\npalpable within a week of trial, which creates a natural stimulus to\r\npersevere for a few weeks more, when the fact becomes established\r\nbeyond question.\r\n\r\nI only entreat all persons suffering from corpulence to make a fair\r\ntrial for just one clear month, as I am well convinced they will\r\nafterwards pursue a course which yields such extraordinary benefit,\r\ntill entirely and effectually relieved, and be it remembered, by the\r\nsacrifice merely of simple, for the advantage of more generous and\r\ncomforting food. The simple dietary evidently adds fuel to the fire,\r\nwhereas the superior and liberal seems to extinguish it.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to be able to assert that I have proved the great merit\r\nand advantage of the system by its result in several other cases,\r\nsimilar to my own, and have full confidence that within the next twelve\r\nmonths I shall know of many more cases restored from the disease of\r\ncorpulence, for I have received the kindest possible letters from\r\nmany afflicted strangers and friends, as well as similar personal\r\nobservations from others, whom I have converse with, and assurances\r\nfrom most of them that they will kindly inform me the result for my own\r\nprivate satisfaction. Many are practicing the diet after consultation\r\nwith their own medical advisers; some few have gone to mine, and\r\nothers are practicing upon their own convictions of the advantages\r\ndetailed in the pamphlet, though I recommend all to act advisedly, in\r\ncase their constitutions should differ. I am, however, so perfectly\r\nsatisfied of the great unerring benefits of this system of diet, that\r\nI shall spare no trouble to circulate my humble experience. The amount\r\nand character of my correspondence on the subject has been strange and\r\nsingular, but most satisfactory to my mind and feelings.\r\n\r\nI am now in that happy, comfortable state that I should not hesitate to\r\nindulge in any fancy in regard to diet, but if I did so should watch\r\nthe consequences, and not continue any course which might add to weight\r\nor bulk and consequent discomfort.\r\n\r\nIs not the system suggestive to artists and men of sedentary employment\r\nwho cannot spare time for exercise, consequently become corpulent, and\r\nclog the little muscular action with a superabundance of fat, thus\r\neasily avoided?\r\n\r\nPure, genuine bread, may be the staff of life, as it is termed. It is\r\nso, particularly in youth, but I feel certain it is more wholesome\r\nin advanced life if thoroughly toasted, as I take it. My impression\r\nis that any starchy or saccharine matter tends to the disease of\r\ncorpulence in advanced life, and whether it be swallowed in that form\r\nor generated in the stomach, that all things tending to these elements\r\nshould be avoided, of course always under sound medical authority.\r\n\r\n                                                        WILLIAM BANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING ADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very satisfactory to me to be able to state, that I remained at\r\nthe same standard of bulk and weight for several weeks after the 26th\r\nAugust, when I attained the happy natural medium, since which time I\r\nhave varied in weight from two to three pounds, more or less. I have\r\nseldom taken the morning draught since that time, and have frequently\r\nindulged my fancy, _experimentally_, in using milk, sugar, butter, and\r\npotatoes--indeed, I may say all the forbidden articles _except beer_,\r\nin moderation, with impunity, but always as an exception, not as a\r\nrule. This deviation, however, convinces me that I hold the power of\r\nmaintaining the happy medium in my own hands.\r\n\r\nA kind friend has lately furnished me with a tabular statement in\r\nregard to weight as proportioned to stature, which, under present\r\ncircumstances and the new movement, may be interesting and useful to\r\ncorpulent readers:\r\n\r\n  STATURE.                    WEIGHT.\r\n  5 ft. 1 should be 8 stone 8 or 120 lbs.\r\n  5  “  2     “     9   “   0 “  126  “\r\n  5  “  3     “     9   “   7 “  133  “\r\n  5  “  4     “     9   “  10 “  136  “\r\n  5  “  5     “    10   “   2 “  142  “\r\n  5  “  6     “    10   “   5 “  145  “\r\n  5  “  7     “    10   “   8 “  148  “\r\n  5  “  8     “    11   “   1 “  155  “\r\n  5  “  9     “    11   “   8 “  162  “\r\n  5  “ 10     “    12   “   1 “  169  “\r\n  5  “ 11     “    12   “   6 “  174  “\r\n  6  “  0     “    12   “  10 “  178  “\r\n\r\nThis tabular statement, taken from a mean average of 2,648 healthy\r\nmen, was formed and arranged for an Insurance Company by the late Dr.\r\nJohn Hutchinson. It answered as a pretty good standard, and insurances\r\nwere regulated upon it. His calculations were made upon the volume of\r\nair passing in and out of the lungs, and this was his guide as to how\r\nfar the various organs of the body were in health, and the lungs in\r\nparticular. It may be viewed as some sort of probable rule, yet only as\r\nan average--some in health weighing more by many pounds than others. It\r\nmust not be looked upon as infallible, but only as a sort of general\r\nreasonable guide to Nature’s great and mighty work.\r\n\r\nOn a general view of the question I think it may be conceded that a\r\nframe of low stature was hardly intended to bear heavy weight. Judging\r\nfrom this tabular statement I ought to be considerably lighter than I\r\nam at present: I shall not, however, covet or aim at such a result,\r\nnor, on the other hand feel alarmed if I decrease a little more in\r\nweight and bulk.\r\n\r\nI am certainly more sensitive to cold since I have lost the\r\nsuperabundant fat, but this is remedial by another garment, far more\r\nagreeable and satisfactory. Many of my friends have said, “Oh! you have\r\ndone well so far, but take care you don’t go too far!” I fancy such a\r\ncircumstance, with such a dietary, very unlikely, if not impossible;\r\nbut feeling that I have now nearly attained the right standard of\r\nbulk and weight proportional to my stature and age (between 10 and\r\n11 stone), I should not hesitate to partake of a fattening dietary\r\noccasionally, to preserve the happy standard, if necessary; indeed, I\r\nam allowed to do so by my medical adviser, but I shall always observe a\r\ncareful watch upon myself to discover the effect, and act accordingly,\r\nso that, if I choose to spend a day or two with Dives, so to speak, I\r\nmust not forget to devote the next to Lazarus.\r\n\r\nThe remedy may be as old as the hills, as I have since been told, but\r\nits application is of very recent date; and it astonishes me that such\r\na light should have remained so long unnoticed and hidden, as not to\r\nafford a glimmer to my anxious mind in a search for it during the last\r\ntwenty years, even in directions where it might have been expected\r\nto be known. I would rather presume it is a new light, than that it\r\nwas purposely hidden merely because the disease of obesity was not\r\nimmediately dangerous to existence, nor thought to be worthy of serious\r\nconsideration. Little do the faculty imagine the misery and bitterness\r\nto life through the parasite of corpulence or obesity.\r\n\r\nI can now confidently say that _quantity_ of diet may be safely left\r\nto the natural appetite; and that it is the _quality_ only, which is\r\nessential to abate and cure corpulence. I stated the quantities of\r\nmy own dietary, because it was part of a truthful report, but some\r\ncorrespondents have doubted whether it should be more or less in their\r\nown cases, a doubt which would be better solved by their own appetite,\r\nor medical adviser. I have heard a graphic remark by a corpulent man,\r\nwhich may not be inappropriately stated here, _that big houses were not\r\nformed with scanty materials_. This, however, is a poor excuse for self\r\nindulgence in improper food, or for not consulting medical authority.\r\n\r\nThe approach of corpulence is so gradual that, until it is far\r\nadvanced, persons rarely become objects of attention. Many have even\r\ncongratulated themselves on their comely appearance, and have not\r\nsought advice or a remedy for what they did not consider an evil, for\r\nan evil I can say most truly it is, when in much excess, to which point\r\nit must, in my opinion arrive, unless obviated by proper means.\r\n\r\nMany have wished to know (as future readers may) the nature of the\r\nmorning draught, or where it could be obtained, but believing it would\r\nhave been highly imprudent on my part to have presumed that what was\r\nproper for my constitution was applicable to all indiscriminately,\r\nI could only refer them to a medical adviser for any aid beyond the\r\ndietary; assuring them, however, it was not a dram but of an alkaline\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSome, I believe, would willingly submit to even a violent remedy, so\r\nthat an immediate benefit could be produced; this is not the object of\r\nthe treatment, as it cannot but be dangerous, in my humble opinion, to\r\nreduce a disease of this nature suddenly; they are probably then too\r\nprone to despair of success, and consider it as unalterably connected\r\nwith their constitution. Many under this feeling doubtless return to\r\ntheir former habits, encouraged so to act by the ill-judged advice of\r\nfriends, who, I am persuaded (from the correspondence I have had on\r\nthis most interesting subject) become unthinking accomplices in the\r\ndestruction of those whom they regard and esteem.\r\n\r\nThe question of four meals a-day, and the night cap, has been\r\nabundantly and amusingly criticized. I ought perhaps to have stated\r\nas an excuse for such liberality of diet, that I breakfast between\r\neight and nine o’clock, dine between one and two, take my slight tea\r\nmeal between five and six, sup at nine, and only take the night cap\r\nwhen inclination directs. My object in naming it at all was, that, as\r\na part of a whole system, it should be known, and to show it is not\r\nforbidden to those who are advised that they need such a luxury; nor\r\nwas it injurious in my case. Some have inquired whether smoking was\r\nprohibited. It was not.\r\n\r\nIt has also been remarked that such a dietary as mine was too good and\r\nexpensive for a poor man, and that I had wholly lost sight of that\r\nclass; but a very poor corpulent man is not so frequently met with,\r\ninasmuch as the poor cannot afford the simple inexpensive means for\r\ncreating fat; but when the tendency does exist in that class, I have no\r\ndoubt it can be remedied by abstinence from the forbidden articles, and\r\na moderate indulgence in such cheap stimulants as may be recommended\r\nby a medical adviser, whom they have ample chances of consulting\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nI have a very strong feeling that gout (another terrible parasite upon\r\nhumanity) might be greatly relieved, if not cured entirely, by this\r\nproper natural dietary, and sincerely hope some person so afflicted\r\nmay be induced to practice the harmless plan for three months (as I\r\ncertainly would if the case were my own) to prove it; but not without\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nMy impression from the experiments I have tried on myself of late is,\r\nthat saccharine matter is the great moving cause of fatty corpulence.\r\nI know that it produces in my individual case increased weight and\r\na large amount of flatulence, and believe, that not only sugar, but\r\nall elements tending to create saccharine matter in the process of\r\ndigestion, should be avoided. I apprehend it will be found in bread,\r\nbutter, milk, beer, port wine, and champagne; I have not found\r\nstarchy matter so troublesome as the saccharine, which, I think,\r\nlargely increases acidity as well as fat, but, with ordinary care and\r\nobservation, people will soon find what food rests easiest in the\r\nstomach, and avoid that which does not, during the probationary trial\r\nof the proposed dietary. Vegetables and ripe or stewed fruit I have\r\nfound ample aperients. Failing this, medical advice should be sought.\r\n\r\nThe word “_parasite_” has been much commented upon, as inappropriate\r\nto any but a living creeping thing (of course I use the word in a\r\nfigurative sense, as a burden to the flesh), but if fat is not an\r\ninsidious creeping enemy, I do not know what is. I should have equally\r\napplied the word to gout, rheumatism, dropsy, and many other diseases.\r\n\r\nWhereas hitherto the appeals to me to know the name of my medical\r\nadviser have been very numerous, I may say hundreds, which I have\r\ngladly answered, though forming no small item of the expense incurred,\r\nand whereas the very extensive circulation expected of the third\r\nedition is likely to lead to some thousands of similar applications,\r\nI feel bound in self-defence, to state that the medical gentleman to\r\nwhom I am so deeply indebted is Mr. Harvey, Soho Square, London, whom\r\nI consulted for deafness. In the first and second editions, I thought\r\nthat to give his name would appear like a puff, which I know he abhors;\r\nindeed, I should prefer not to do so now, but cannot in justice to\r\nmyself, incur further probable expense (which I fancy inevitable)\r\nbesides the personal trouble, for which I cannot afford time, and,\r\ntherefore, feel no hesitation to refer to him as my guarantee for the\r\ntruth of the pamphlet.\r\n\r\nOne material point I should be glad to impress on my corpulent\r\nreaders--it is, to get accurately weighed at starting upon the fresh\r\nsystem, and continue to do so weekly or monthly, for the change will\r\nbe so truly palpable by this course of examination, that it will arm\r\nthem with perfect confidence in the merit and ultimate success of the\r\nplan. I deeply regret not having secured a photographic portrait of\r\nmy original figure in 1862, to place in juxta position with one of my\r\npresent form. It might have amused some, but certainly would have been\r\nvery convincing to others, and astonishing to all that such an effect\r\nshould have been so readily and speedily produced by the simple natural\r\ncause of exchanging a meagre for a generous dietary under proper\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nI shall ever esteem it a great favor if persons relieved and cured, as\r\nI have been, will kindly let me know of it; the information will be\r\ntruly gratifying to my mind. That the system is a great success, I have\r\nnot a shadow of doubt from the numerous reports sent with thanks by\r\nstrangers as well as from friends from all parts of the kingdom; and I\r\nam truly thankful to have been the humble instrument of disseminating\r\nthe blessing and experience I have attained through able counsel and\r\nnatural causes by proper perseverance.\r\n\r\nI have now finished my task, and trust my humble efforts may prove to\r\nbe good seed well sown, that will fructify and produce a large harvest\r\nof benefit to my fellow creatures. I also hope the faculty generally\r\nmay be led more extensively to ventilate this question of corpulence\r\nor obesity, so that, instead of one, two, or three able practitioners,\r\nthere may be as many hundreds distributed in the various parts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. In such case, I am persuaded, that those diseases, like\r\nReverence and Golden Pippins, will be very rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince publishing the third edition of my pamphlet, I have earnestly\r\npressed my medical adviser to explain the reasons for so remarkable\r\na result as I and others have experienced from the dietary system he\r\nprescribed, and I hope he may find time to do so shortly, as I believe\r\nit would be highly interesting to the Faculty and the public generally.\r\nHe has promised this at his leisure.\r\n\r\nNumerous applications having been made to me on points to which I had\r\nnot alluded, in which my correspondents felt some doubt and interest,\r\nI take this opportunity of making some few corrections in my published\r\ndietary:--\r\n\r\nI ought, “it seems,” to have excepted veal, owing to its indigestible\r\nquality, as well as pork for its fattening character; also herrings\r\nand eels (owing to their oily nature), being as injurious as salmon.\r\nIn respect to vegetables, not only should potatoes be prohibited,\r\nbut parsnips, beetroot, turnips, and carrots. The truth is, I seldom\r\nor ever partook of these objectionable articles myself, and did not\r\nreflect that others might do so, or that they were forbidden. Green\r\nvegetables are considered very beneficial, and I believe should be\r\nadopted at all times. I am indebted to the “Cornhill Magazine” and\r\nother journals for drawing my attention to these dietetic points. I\r\ncan now also state that eggs, if not hard boiled, are unexceptionable,\r\nthat cheese, if sparingly used, and plain boiled rice seem harmless.\r\n\r\nSome doubts have been expressed in regard to the vanishing point of\r\nsuch a descending scale, but it is a remarkable fact that the great and\r\nmost palpable diminution in weight and bulk occurs within the first\r\nforty-eight hours, the descent is then more gradual. My own experience,\r\nand that of others, assures me (if medical authority be first consulted\r\nas to the complaint) that with such slight extraneous aid as medicine\r\ncan afford, nature will do her duty, and only her duty: firstly, by\r\nrelieving herself of immediate pressure she will be enabled to move\r\nmore freely in her own beautiful way, and secondly, by pursuing the\r\nsame course to work speedy amelioration and final cure. The vanishing\r\npoint is only when the disease is stopped and the parasite annihilated.\r\n\r\nIt may interest my readers to know that I have now apparently attained\r\nthe standard natural at my age (10 stone 10, or 150 lbs.), as my weight\r\nnow varies only to the extent of 1 lb., more or less in the course of a\r\nmonth. According to Dr. Hutchinson’s tables I ought to lose still more,\r\nbut cannot do so without resorting to medicine; and, feeling in sound\r\nvigorous health, I am perfectly content to wait upon nature for any\r\nfurther change.\r\n\r\nIn my humble judgment the dietary is the principal point in the\r\ntreatment of Corpulence, and it appears to me, moreover, that if\r\nproperly regulated it becomes in a certain sense a medicine. The system\r\nseems to me to attack only the superfluous deposit of fat, and, as my\r\nmedical friend informs me, purges the blood, rendering it more pure and\r\nhealthy, strengthens the muscles and bodily viscera, and I feel quite\r\nconvinced sweetens life if it does not prolong it.\r\n\r\nIt is truly gratifying to me to be able now to add that many other of\r\nthe most exalted members of the Faculty have honoured my movement in\r\nthe question with their approbation.\r\n\r\nI consider it a public duty further to state, that Mr. Harvey, whom\r\nI have named on the 24th page as my kind medical adviser in the cure\r\nof Corpulence, is not Dr. John Harvey, who has published a Pamphlet\r\non Corpulence assimilating with some of the features and the general\r\naspect of mine, and which has been considered (as I learn from\r\ncorrespondents who have obtained it) the work of my medical friend. It\r\nis not.\r\n\r\nI am glad, therefore, to repeat that my medical adviser was, and is\r\nstill, Mr. WILLIAM HARVEY, F.R.C.S., No. 2, Soho Square, London, W.\r\n\r\n                                                        WILLIAM BANTING.\r\n\r\n  _April, 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HARVEY’S REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My patient, Mr. Banting, having published for the benefit of his\r\nfellow sufferers, some account of the diet which I recommended him to\r\nadopt with a view to relieve him of a distressing degree of hypertrophy\r\nof the adipose tissue. I have been frequently urged by him to explain\r\nthe principles upon which I was enabled to treat with success this\r\ninconvenient, and in some instances, distressing condition of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n“The simple history of my finding occasion to investigate this\r\nsubject is as follows:--When in Paris, in the year 1856, I took the\r\nopportunity of attending a discussion on the views of M. Bernard, who\r\nwas at that time propounding his now generally admitted theory of\r\nthe liver functions. After he had discovered by chemical processes\r\nand physiological experiments, which it is unnecessary for me to\r\nrecapitulate here, that the liver not only secreted bile, but also a\r\npeculiar amyloid or starch-like product which he called glucose, and\r\nwhich in its chemical and physical properties appeared to be nearly\r\nallied to saccharine matter, he further found that this glucose could\r\nbe directly produced in the liver by the ingestion of sugar and its\r\nally starch, and that in diabetes it existed there in considerable\r\nexcess. It had long been well known that a purely animal diet greatly\r\nassisted in checking the secretion of diabetic urine; and it seemed\r\nto follow, as a matter of course, that the total abstinence from\r\nsaccharine and farinaceous matter must drain the liver of this\r\nexcessive amount of glucose, and thus arrest in a similar proportion\r\nthe diabetic tendency. Reflecting on this chain of argument, and\r\nknowing too that a saccharine and farinaceous diet is used to fatten\r\ncertain animals, and that in diabetes, the whole of the fat of the body\r\nrapidly disappears, it occurred to me that excessive obesity might be\r\nallied to diabetes as to its cause, although widely diverse in its\r\ndevelopment: and that if a purely animal diet was useful in the latter\r\ndisease, a combination of animal food with such vegetable matters as\r\ncontained neither sugar nor starch, might serve to arrest the undue\r\nformation of fat. I soon afterwards had an opportunity of testing this\r\nidea. A dispensary patient, who consulted me for deafness, and who was\r\nenormously corpulent, I found to have no distinguishable disease of\r\nthe ear. I therefore suspected that his deafness arose from the great\r\ndevelopment of adipose matter in the throat, pressing upon and stopping\r\nup the eustachian tubes. I subjected him to a strict non-farinaceous\r\nand non-saccharine diet, and treated him with the volatile alkali\r\nalluded to in his Pamphlet, and occasional aperients, and in about\r\nseven months he was reduced to almost normal proportions, his hearing\r\nrestored, and his general health immensely improved. This case seemed\r\nto give substance and reality to my conjectures, which further\r\nexperience has confirmed.\r\n\r\n“When we consider that fat is what is termed hydro carbon, and deposits\r\nitself so insidiously and yet so gradually amongst the tissues of\r\nthe body, it is at once manifest that we require such substances as\r\ncontain a superfluity of oxygen and nitrogen to arrest its formation\r\nand to vitalize the system. That is the principal upon which the\r\ndiet suggested in his Pamphlet works, and explains on the one hand\r\nthe necessity of abstaining from all vegetable roots which hold a\r\nlarge quantity of saccharine matter, and on the other the beneficial\r\neffects derivable from those vegetables, the fruits of which are on the\r\nexterior of the earth, as they lose, probably by means of the sun’s\r\naction, a large proportion of their sugar.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the tables of Dr. Hutchinson, referred to in his\r\nPamphlet, it is no doubt difficult, as he says, to determine what is a\r\nman’s proper weight, which must be influenced by various causes. Those\r\ntables, however, were formed by him on the principle of considering\r\nthe amount of air which the lungs in their healthy state can receive\r\nand apply to the oxydation of the blood. I gave them to Mr. Banting\r\nas an indication only of what the approximate weight of adult persons\r\nin proportion to their stature should be, and with the view of\r\nproving to them the importance of keeping down the tendency to grow\r\nfat; for, as that tendency increases, the capacity of the lungs, and\r\nconsequently the vitality and power of the whole system must diminish.\r\nIn conclusion, I would suggest the propriety of advising a dietary such\r\nas this in diseases that are in any way influenced by a disordered\r\ncondition of the hepatic functions, as they cannot fail to yield in\r\nsome degree to this simple method of treatment if fairly and properly\r\ncarried out; it remains for me to watch its progress in a more limited\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n                                   “WILLIAM HARVEY, F.R.C.S.,\r\n                                       “Surgeon to the Royal Dispensary,\r\n                                            for Diseases of the Ear.”\r\n\r\n  _2, Soho Square_,\r\n  _April, 1864_.",
