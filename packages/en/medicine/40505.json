  "content": "Transcriber's notes:\r\n\r\nIn this plain text version, bold script is denoted by =equals signs= and\r\nitalic script by _underscores_. Underscores are also used with curly\r\nbrackets to represent subscripted characters (e.g. CO_{2}). Text that\r\nwas originally rendered in small capitals now appears in full capitals.\r\nFootnotes are located below the relevant paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe book contains numerous spelling inconsistencies. No change has been\r\nmade to those representing archaic spellings (e.g. 'somethimes', 'urin',\r\n'feavers', 'joynts') and those occurring in quotations. Spelling\r\nvariants occurring with similar frequency have been left in their\r\noriginal form (e.g. Röntgen/Roentgen, rachitic/rhachitic,\r\nalbumen/albumin - the correct spellings is used for egg albumen but both\r\nare used randomly for serum/urine albumin). Most other spelling\r\ninconsistencies have been changed to the more-frequent or more-accurate\r\nform (e.g. twofold-->two-fold, guinea pig-->guinea-pig, oedema-->edema,\r\nneuroedema-->neuredema, gm.-->g., Luborsch-->Lubarsch, Bauman-->Baumann,\r\nMcCluggage-->McClugage, Eijkmann-->Eijkman). Although the spelling of\r\n'fæces' and its adjective 'fecal' is not consistent, the two spellings\r\nare used consistently throughout the book and therefore have not been\r\naltered. Similarly 'hemorrhage' and 'hemoglobin' are consistently spelt\r\nthus, while other words relating to blood consistently use the æ\r\nligature, e.g. 'hæmatemesis', 'hæmatoma', 'hæmaturia', 'leukæmia',\r\n'hyperæmia'.\r\n\r\nWrong or missing French accents and typos have been corrected where\r\nnecessary. German expressions in the bibliography contain various\r\napparent inconsistencies that have not been changed because of my\r\nunfamiliarity with the language and what was perhaps legitimate at the\r\ntime of writing (e.g. 'Muench. med. Woch.', 'Muenchn. med. Woch.' and\r\n'Muenschner med. Woch.'; 'Barlow'schen Krankheit' 'Moeller-Barlow'sche\r\nKrankheit', 'Moeller-Barlow'scher Krankheit', and 'Moeller-Barlowscher\r\nKrankheit'; 'Beiträge z.', 'Beitraege zur', 'Beitrag zur'). The term\r\n'Gernest-mark' on p. 108 should probably be 'geruestmark' (or perhaps\r\ngerüstmark) as used elsewhere in the book (pp. 96, 107, 108 and 128).\r\n\r\nThe book also contains numerous hyphenation inconsistencies. Some of\r\nthese have been altered to conform with the most common usage in the\r\ntext, but most have not been changed because hyphenation is notoriously\r\nvariable and subject to fashion.\r\n\r\nSubheading use is somewhat inconsistent; for example, under the\r\nsubheading 'Alimentary Tract' in chapter IV, there appear various\r\nnon-alimentary items, and in the same chapter 'Microscopic Pathology'\r\nappears as a stand-alone subheading whilst its equivalent 'Gross\r\nPathology' is relegated to a bold in-line paragraph introduction.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography contains two very similar references attributed to Gee.\r\nThe second appears to be a duplicate of the first, but it is probable\r\nthat the title is incorrect because the publication details (1889, XXV,\r\n85) relate to a different paper by Gee entitled 'Bloody Urine the Only\r\nSign of Infantile Scurvy', and although there are several comments in\r\nthis book about scurvy and haematuria (blood in the urine), e.g. p. 204,\r\nnone cite Gee's paper.\r\n\r\nThe second entry for Morse, J. L. in the bibliography should be numbered\r\nas (2) and the source should be Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, 1914,\r\nCLXX, 504. (not Jour. Am. Med. Assn.).\r\n\r\nInconsistent punctuation in the bibliography list has been corrected\r\n(e.g. semicolon-->colon).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCURVY\r\n\r\n    PAST AND PRESENT\r\n\r\n    BY\r\n\r\n    ALFRED F.

A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in scurvy has been stimulated in the last few years as the\r\nresult of a new and broader conception of nutrition. It has come to be\r\nrealized that in addition to the substances heretofore recognized as of\r\nessential importance in the dietary--the proteins, fats, carbohydrates\r\nand the salts--there is still another group, termed \"vitamines,\"\r\n\"accessory food factors\" or \"food hormones,\" which must be included in\r\norder to render the diet complete and adequate. It has become\r\nincreasingly evident that the attention of physiologists and of\r\nclinicians has been focussed too sharply and too narrowly on the caloric\r\nvalue of foodstuffs. At the same time we have begun to appreciate the\r\nexistence of a group of nutritional disorders which depend largely on a\r\ndeficiency of these illusive vitamines or food factors, and which\r\nevidently are of vital importance to the welfare of the individual and\r\nof mankind. Scurvy is one of this newly-constituted group, and due to\r\nthis association has acquired a fresh and broader significance. It is in\r\nthis light that the intensive research work must be interpreted, which\r\nhas been applied within the past few years, both in this country and\r\nabroad, to problems relating to this disorder. It is clear that the\r\nsubject is in its infancy, and is destined to participate in a\r\nconsideration of many of the nutritional and infectious diseases of the\r\nadult and the child.\r\n\r\nThe World War has tended also to demand a renewed consideration of\r\nscurvy. This disorder has played a rôle in all wars--in the campaigns of\r\nthe Cæsars, the pilgrim ages of the Crusaders, and the numerous wars of\r\nthe last century. In the recent war it existed among the various\r\narmies, particularly those in the East, to an extent greater than at\r\nfirst was realized. In Mesopotamia it is stated to have been one of the\r\ndecisive factors in forcing the surrender of the British at Kut. Its\r\nincidence, however, was not limited to the military forces. Reports from\r\nEngland and the continental countries clearly indicate that scurvy\r\nprevailed among the civilian population during the past few years to a\r\ndegree unknown in peace times. This was especially true of infants and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFor the past seven years I have been engaged in an investigation of\r\nscurvy both in the laboratory and in the clinic, and have treated\r\nvarious aspects of the subject in a large number of articles published\r\nin various medical journals. In the course of these studies there has\r\nbeen ample opportunity for a comprehensive review of the\r\nwidely-scattered literature. No treatise on scurvy has been published in\r\nEnglish since the classical work of Lind in 1772. The time, therefore,\r\nseemed opportune to gather into one volume the recent advances in this\r\nfield and to offer to the clinician, to the hygienist, and to the\r\nbiological chemist a presentation of the existing status of this\r\nimportant nutritional disease.\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure that I acknowledge my obligation to Dr. Lester J.\r\nUnger, who has assisted in carrying out much of the work described in\r\nthis volume. Thanks are due also to Dr. Charles Gottlieb for the\r\nradiographs which are here reproduced, and to Dr. Gertrude McCann for\r\nseeing the work through the press. To my associates in the clinic who\r\nshared in the observations, and to friends who read various chapters in\r\nthe course of their preparation, I wish to express my appreciation.\r\n\r\n                                                    ALFRED F.

We hear of it first as a plague,\r\ninfesting armies and besieged towns; then as a dread disease, decimating\r\nthe sailors of the navy and of the mercantile marine, and, since the end\r\nof the last century, more often as a nutritional disturbance,\r\nendangering the health of infants. Very recently it has acquired an\r\nentirely new interest, as the representative of a class of disorders\r\nwhich has revealed the essential importance to man of unknown dietary\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, as may be imagined, to define with precision the\r\nearliest description of scurvy, as the older references are so vague as\r\nto be open to individual interpretation. The reference of Hippocrates to\r\na large number of men in the army who suffered from pains in the legs\r\nand gangrene of the gums, which was accompanied by loss of teeth, seems\r\nsufficiently definite to be identified as this disease. The Greek, Roman\r\nand Arabian writers do not seem to have been acquainted with scurvy.\r\nThis is as we should expect, for fruits and vegetables grew in such\r\nplenty in these southern countries that scurvy must have been a disorder\r\nof rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAn interesting early description of scurvy, and one which is quite\r\nconvincing, is that of de Joinville, who accompanied the Crusaders in\r\ntheir invasion of Egypt under St. Lewis, about the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century. He refers to the lividity and spongy condition of\r\nthe gums, and describes how \"the barber surgeons were forced to cut away\r\nthe dead flesh from the gums to enable the people to masticate their\r\nfood\"; he describes their debility, their tendency to faint, and the\r\nblack spots on their legs. The disease broke out in Lent, during which\r\ntime the soldiers partook of no meat, but consumed a species of eel\r\nwhich they believed \"ate the dead people\" and therefore led to this\r\nloathsome disease.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that scurvy existed in the northern parts of Europe and\r\nAsia ever since they were settled by man. We should hardly expect to\r\nhave records of this condition, in view of the low educational status of\r\nthe people, their greatly restricted literature, and their lack of\r\nintercourse with the people in the southern countries. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury, with the development and spread of education, we begin to hear\r\nof scurvy from various sources. Claus Magnus, in his \"History of the\r\nNorthern Nations,\" published in 1555, described the disease which he\r\ntells us flourished among the soldiers in the camps and in the prisons.\r\nAbout this time Ronsseus, Echtius and Wierus wrote special treatises on\r\nthis disease, and recommended many dietary measures which we recognize\r\nto-day as most efficacious. The number of monographs on this subject\r\nmultiplied with great rapidity in the course of the next twenty-five or\r\nfifty years; none of them, however, added anything essential to our\r\nknowledge. In 1645 the Faculty of Medicine at Copenhagen published a\r\n\"consilium\" for the benefit of the poor, treating of the causes,\r\nprevention and cure of this disease, which was prevalent among the Danes\r\nand other northern nations.\r\n\r\nThe colonists of the northern part of America were sorely afflicted with\r\nscurvy. It is said that the French met with such high mortality during\r\nthe severe winters in Canada, that they frequently debated the wisdom of\r\nabandoning this settlement. This was true also in regard to the English\r\nand their settlement in Newfoundland. Indeed, it was scurvy which forced\r\nthe early settlers in Hudson Bay to discontinue their intentions of\r\ncolonizing that region.\r\n\r\nIn an essay published in the eighteenth century (1734), Bachstrom\r\ndescribed an epidemic of scurvy which occurred in 1703 during the siege\r\nof Thorn, in Prussia, by the Swedes, which caused the death of 5000 of\r\nthe garrison, in addition to a large number of the inhabitants. It is\r\ninteresting to note that this epidemic took place in the middle of the\r\nsummer, and not in the cold season. From this time on we meet with many\r\ndescriptions of scurvy in connection with the wars at various periods.\r\nFor instance, in the Russian armies, in the war between the Austrians\r\nand the Turks in 1720; in the English troops who had taken Quebec from\r\nthe French in 1759; among the French soldiers in the army of the Alps in\r\nthe spring of 1795. It is unnecessary to review these accounts in\r\ndetail. This period is distinguished rather by the appearance of a great\r\nclassic on Scurvy, the work of the English naval hygienist, Lind (1752).\r\nThis book has intrinsic value to-day, and, at the time it appeared,\r\nserved to crystallize the conception of scurvy, which had been stretched\r\nout of all proportions to include an ever-increasing conglomeration of\r\nclinical conditions. Scurvy had become the Alpha and Omega of\r\nprofessional routine, the catchword of the day, the asylum ignorantiæ of\r\nthe practical man. Into this chaos, as Hirsch expresses it, \"the first\r\nbeams of light fell when Lind's classical work appeared.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be of little value to consider the great number of epidemics of\r\nscurvy which occurred from this time to the present day. They may be\r\nfound in tabular form in the excellent survey of scurvy by Hirsch. The\r\nliterature of this long period may likewise be found in a work of\r\nencyclopædic character, that of Krebel, which gives the titles, with a\r\nsummary of the various articles on this subject, appearing to the year\r\n1859. If we look over the chronological table compiled by Hirsch, we\r\nnote a remarkable similarity regarding the incidence of the recurring\r\nepidemics. In almost all cases they broke out among troops, whether in\r\nRussia, in India, in Africa, or in our United States. The epidemics\r\nwhich are not attributable to military life or campaigns are found to\r\nhave taken place generally in prisons, insane asylums, poorhouses or\r\nhouses of refuge and correction. It would seem that no war is omitted\r\nfrom this list of sickness and death. There are in all 143 land\r\nepidemics between 1556 and 1877, two occurring in the sixteenth century,\r\nfour in the seventeenth, 33 in the eighteenth, and 104 in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The marked increase in the nineteenth century occurred in\r\ninstitutions, in asylums and prisons, rather than in the armies. This\r\nfact may be ascribed to altered social conditions which led to a great\r\nmultiplication of eleemosynary institutions.\r\n\r\nComing down to more recent times, we learn that scurvy occurred\r\nextensively during the Crimean War, and that it was prevalent also among\r\nthe troops in our own Civil War. In the \"Medical and Surgical History of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion,\" we find the following statements:\r\n\r\n    \"A scorbutic tendency was developed at most of our military posts\r\n    during the winter season, after the troops had been confined to the\r\n    use of the ordinary ration with the desiccated vegetables. The\r\n    latter in the quantities failed to repress the disease. At posts\r\n    which could be readily supplied with potatoes only the taint was\r\n    manifested, on account of a want of liberality in the issues.\" And\r\n    again: \"Among the white troops during the five and one-sixth years\r\n    covered by the statistics, 30,714 cases of scurvy were reported; and\r\n    383 deaths were attributed directly to that disease.\"\r\n\r\nMunson writes: \"It (scurvy) prevailed among our troops during the Civil\r\nWar and its recognition was a surprise and shock to professional ideas\r\npreconceived from practice in civil life.\"\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the besieged in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War\r\nin the winter of 1870-71 suffered severely from scurvy. The accounts of\r\ntheir pitiable condition have been portrayed for us by numerous French\r\nwriters (Delpech, Hayem, Lasèque and Legroux). The people lived mainly\r\non rice and bread, with an occasional addition of potatoes or horse\r\nmeat. The winter was exceptionally severe, which was supposed to have\r\nintensified the scorbutic condition. Not only were the inmates of the\r\nprisons on the Seine attacked, numbering about one thousand, but even\r\nthe patients in the military hospitals developed the disease. It is of\r\ninterest to remember that the siege lasted but little over four months,\r\nfrom September 17th to January 27th, the date of the armistice.\r\n\r\nIn the Russo-Japanese War, after the siege of Port Arthur, it was found\r\nthat one-half of the garrison of 17,000 men had scurvy.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are certain parts of the world where scurvy is of\r\nfrequent occurrence, no country has been entirely free from it. As might\r\nbe expected, it has been particularly prevalent in the North, where\r\nvegetation is scanty--in Greenland, Alaska, Russia and the Baltic\r\nStates. It has likewise prevailed in the tropics when the crops have\r\nfailed. India has been conspicuous for its large number of epidemics;\r\nsome years ago scurvy occurred in Arabia among the English troops\r\nstationed at Aden, both among the British and the native troops. A\r\nrecent communication from Aruba, a small island of Dutch Guiana, lying\r\nnorth of Venezuela, illustrates how devastating scurvy still is in some\r\nparts of the world. This account tells of 3000 cases of this disease\r\nwhich occurred in 1915 among a population of less than 10,000, owing to\r\nthe fact that the crops had failed almost entirely during the years\r\n1912, 1913 and 1914.\r\n\r\nIt is important for us to realize that we are still dependent on the\r\nannual crops for our protection from scurvy; in other words, the world\r\nis leading a hand-to-mouth existence in regard to its quota of\r\nantiscorbutic food. The truth of this condition has been realized for\r\nIreland, sadly illustrated by numerous epidemics, notably the great\r\nepidemic of 1847 reported by Curran. It was demonstrated by the\r\noutbreaks of scurvy in Norway in 1904 and 1912, and was brought to the\r\nattention of many in the United States in the spring of 1916. In this\r\nyear our potato crop fell far below the normal, with the result that\r\nscurvy appeared in various parts of the United States, especially in\r\ninstitutions (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A comparison between the requisitioned quantity\r\n(in thousand pound units) of potatoes and other vegetables, and the\r\nquantity received per month by an institution in which more than 200\r\ncases of scurvy occurred at the beginning of April, 1916. The total\r\nheight of column represents the amount needed and requisitioned; the\r\nsolid black portion the amount received. The number of inmates in the\r\ninstitution remained approximately the same.\r\n\r\nThe chart illustrates our great dependence on the potato during the\r\nwinter months. This is due not only to its intrinsic antiscorbutic\r\npotency, but, probably quite as much, to the fact that fully twice as\r\nmany pounds of potatoes are consumed during the winter as of all other\r\nvegetables combined. Therefore, if this crop fails or is dehydrated,\r\nscurvy will develop in the spring.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that scurvy may occur in any land and climate, even in the\r\ngarden spots of the world, is strikingly shown by the epidemics reported\r\nfrom Algiers, and the ravages of this disease among the gold seekers in\r\nCalifornia in 1849. Nothing could be more incongruous than the\r\noccurrence of a deficiency disease in this land of plenty.\r\n\r\n=Outbreaks at Sea.=--It is doubtful, however, whether attention would\r\nhave been focussed so early and so sharply on scurvy, had it not been\r\nfor the voyages of exploration undertaken in the sixteenth century.\r\nThese long trips on sailing vessels, where for many months little or no\r\nfresh vegetable or animal food was obtainable, were almost as if\r\ndesigned to make a test of the dietetic origin of scurvy. The result was\r\ninevitable--five to six months after the ships were out of touch with\r\nland, the majority of the crew frequently were incapacitated by this\r\ndisease, thereby wrecking many an expedition.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] The fact that crews of vessels which set sail in winter were more\r\nsubject to scurvy than those which set out in the summer must be\r\nattributed to the existence of latent scurvy among the sailors at the\r\ntime of sailing, rather than to the season of the year.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account of the outbreak of scurvy at sea is that of Vasco\r\nde Gama, who in 1497 discovered a passage to the East Indies by way of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. The narratives of subsequent explorers,\r\nespecially those of Cartier and of Drake, are replete with descriptions\r\nof the ravages of scurvy. The expedition of Lord Anson in 1740 is\r\nalways cited as a memorable example of an undertaking which foundered as\r\nthe result of scurvy. After a cruise of four years, this expedition had\r\nlost from this disease more than four out of five of the original number\r\nof its crews. In striking contrast to this picture, and to that\r\nfurnished by the voyages of earlier navigators, is that of Captain Cook,\r\nwho in 1772 undertook a voyage lasting over three years, sailing from\r\n52° north to 71° south, with a loss of but one of his crew from disease,\r\nand that not from scurvy. This remarkable feat, more than any other,\r\ncentered attention on the feasibility of preventing scurvy, and resulted\r\nin measures tending to eradicate it from the navy. Captain Cook\r\nattributed the absence of scurvy among his crew to \"sweetwort,\" an\r\ninfusion of barley, which he prepared fresh and served liberally. He\r\nalso prized the antiscorbutic value of sauerkraut.\r\n\r\nWe find accordingly in 1795, at the instance of Sir Gilbert Blaine, that\r\nimprovements were introduced in the victualling of the fleet. As the\r\nresult of a regular ration of lemon juice, the incidence of scurvy fell\r\nprecipitously. It is due largely to this provision that between the\r\nyears 1779 and 1813, according to the statistics of Sir Jay Barrow, the\r\nmorbidity and the mortality in the British Navy was decreased by 75 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that it took a generation after the efficacy of\r\nantiscorbutics had been demonstrated in various expeditions, for an\r\nantiscorbutic to be included in the ration of the navy. The merchant\r\nmarine of England was far more conservative, and for many years after\r\nscurvy had been eradicated from the navy we still read of its occurrence\r\non the vessels making voyages to India, China and Ceylon. Gradually,\r\nhowever, its incidence became less and less. Its toll of death, before\r\npreventive measures were employed, may be appreciated from the fact that\r\nit has been estimated that scurvy destroyed more sailors than all other\r\ncauses incidental to sea life, including the great slaughter of naval\r\nwarfare. Sir R. Hawkins stated in the latter part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury that he could give an account of 10,000 mariners who had been\r\ndestroyed by scurvy during the twenty years that he had been at sea.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, scurvy has played an important rôle in Arctic and\r\nAntarctic explorations, and has been the cause of the failure of many of\r\nthese expeditions. It is now realized that the development of scurvy is\r\nquite preventable, that if a sufficient quantity of meat (especially raw\r\nmeat) is consumed, explorers can be entirely independent of a supply of\r\nfresh vegetables. This fact was brought out by the Arctic Survey\r\nCommittee (British), who \"were appointed to enquire into the causes of\r\nthe outbreak of scurvy in the recent Arctic expedition\" (1877), and who\r\nreported that it may result from an absence of fresh meat. That this\r\nconclusion was sound has been proved by the experiences of Nansen and of\r\nJohansen, who wintered safely in Franz-Josefsland on a diet of meat and\r\nbacon. More recently Stefánsson has carried out successful Arctic\r\nexplorations, depending entirely on fresh meat as antiscorbutic\r\nfoodstuff and making no provision whatsoever for vegetable food.\r\n\r\n=Infantile Scurvy.=--Glisson, to whom we owe the first description of\r\nrickets, likewise was the first to recognize scurvy in infants. In his\r\nclassic treatise on rickets, written in 1668, he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The scurvy is sometimes conjoyned with the affect. It is either\r\n    hereditary, or perhaps in so tender a constitution contracted by\r\n    infection, or lastly, it is produced from the indiscreet and\r\n    erroneous Regiment of the infant, and chiefly from the inclemency of\r\n    the air and climate where the child is educated.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The scurvy complicated with this affect hath these signs: 1. They\r\n    that labor under this affect do impatiently indure purgations; but\r\n    they who are only affected with the Rachites do easily tolerate the\r\n    same. 2. They are much offended with violent exercises, neither can\r\n    they at all endure them. But although in this affect alone, there be\r\n    a kind of slothfulness and aversation from exercise, yet exercise\r\n    doth not so manifestly, at least not altogether so manifestly hurt\r\n    them, as when the scurvy is conjoyned with the Rachites. 3. Upon any\r\n    concitated and vehement motion they draw not breath without much\r\n    difficulty, they are vexed with diverse pains running through their\r\n    joynts, and these they give warning of by theyr crying, the motion\r\n    of the Pulse is frequent and unequal, and somethimes they are\r\n    troubled with a Palpitation of the Heart, or threatened with a\r\n    Lypothymie, which Affects are for the most part soon mitigated, or\r\n    altogether appeased by laying them down to rest. 4. Tumours do very\r\n    commonly appear in the Gums. 5. The urin upon the absence of the\r\n    accustomed feavers is much more intense and increased.\"\r\n\r\nGlisson's description of scurvy was entirely lost sight of, overshadowed\r\nby his description of rickets, so that for over two hundred years no\r\nword of infantile scurvy is to be found either in the English or other\r\nliterature. There is no doubt that from time to time cases must have\r\noccurred, but they were looked upon probably as rickets or as a\r\nmanifestation of one of the hemorrhagic diseases.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Moeller described some cases which evidently were scurvy, but\r\nwhich he termed \"acute rickets.\" He realized that they presented a novel\r\nclinical picture but failed to recognize that they represented a\r\ndisorder quite distinct from rickets.[3] This article was followed\r\nwithin the next few years by reports of other German writers (Bohn,\r\nSteiner, Foerster) who, accepting Moeller's point of view, considered\r\nthese cases merely as an acute form of rickets. They were led to this\r\nerroneous conclusion chiefly on account of the lack of marked\r\ninvolvement of the gums, which they considered an essential sign,\r\ninfluenced by their conception of adult scurvy. This viewpoint has\r\npervaded the German literature even to the present day, when it is still\r\nconsidered necessary to bring further evidence that infantile scurvy in\r\nits pathogenesis and pathology is identical with adult scurvy.\r\n\r\n[3] Infantile scurvy is frequently termed \"Die Moellersche Krankheit.\"\r\nThere seems to be no occasion for giving Moeller credit for discovering\r\nthis disease, as he believed that he was dealing with rickets merely in\r\nan acute form. He recognized the clinical similarity to scurvy, but in\r\none of his cases sharply differentiates it from adult scurvy by the fact\r\nthat \"lemon juice and fresh vegetables\" were of no avail in the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Ingerslev, an assistant of Hirschsprung in Copenhagen, wrote a\r\npaper on \"A Case of Scurvy in a Child,\" which is quite convincing. Two\r\nyears later Jalland, an English physician, reported a similar case of\r\n\"Scurvy in a Ten-Months-Old Infant.\" In 1878 Cheadle reported three\r\ncases of infantile scurvy with typical tumefaction of the gums, and\r\nobscure tenderness of the legs, and followed this paper by two others,\r\nwhich appeared in 1879 and 1882. Cheadle clearly recognized the disease\r\nas scurvy. However, as the title of his first paper--\"Three Cases of\r\nScurvy Supervening on Rickets in Young Children\"--indicates, he\r\nconsidered it a condition engrafted upon rickets. About this time (1881)\r\nGee presented a brief but accurate account of five cases of scurvy which\r\nhe termed \"osteal or periosteal cachexia.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Barlow published his classical paper on this subject, the first\r\nto furnish anatomical proof that this disorder of infants presented the\r\npathological changes characteristic of adult scurvy. Previous to this\r\npublication there had been but one autopsy report, that by Moeller,\r\nwhich had been incorrectly interpreted. The work of Barlow was accepted\r\nremarkably quickly in England and in America, but less promptly on the\r\nContinent. This was probably due to the fact that infantile scurvy was\r\noccurring far more frequently in these two countries, and that the\r\nsubject was open therefore to more prompt investigation. This increased\r\nprevalence of infantile scurvy in the two great English-speaking nations\r\nhas continued to the present time, and no doubt is due to the extensive\r\nemployment of artificial feeding and of proprietary foods. In 1894 not\r\nless than 106 cases were reported to the Academy of Medicine of New York\r\nCity by various physicians, and in 1898 the comprehensive investigation\r\nof the American Pediatric Society appeared, which was based on 379\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that infantile scurvy occurred to a greater or less\r\ndegree throughout the civilized world. In France, Monfalcon had reported\r\na case in 1820 which is sometimes referred to as the earliest case of\r\ninfantile scurvy mentioned in the literature. It relates, however, to an\r\nolder child and was published as a case of scorbutic rickets. Netter\r\nwas one of the first in France to recognize the true nature of the\r\ndisorder, and published several papers in 1898 describing typical cases.\r\nInfantile scurvy was, however, almost unknown in that country until what\r\nis termed \"lait maternisé\" and \"lait fixé\" came into vogue. This is\r\napparent from a table prepared by Lecornu, which gives a list of all\r\ncases in the French literature between 1894 and 1904, and of the diets\r\non which they came about. The former of these milk preparations is\r\nsubjected to various manipulations and then heated to a temperature\r\nabove the boiling point; the latter is shaken violently in a machine to\r\nrender the fat globules smaller, and is then sterilized by one of the\r\nusual methods.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland has undergone an experience similar to that of France.\r\nPrevious to 1903 only five cases of infantile scurvy had been published\r\nfrom that country. In this year Stoos published an additional five. In\r\n1907 Bernheim-Karrer reported nine cases, all of which had developed on\r\nhomogenized milk, a process very similar to that employed by the French\r\nto break up the fat globules. The increase of infantile scurvy in\r\nSwitzerland may be judged by the fact that a commission was formed in\r\nthe following year to investigate its occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there was for many years continued discussion as to the true\r\nnature of scurvy. Some believed it to be a form of rickets, others a\r\nform of scurvy; still others a combination of scurvy and rickets. Some\r\nthought it merely hereditary syphilis, and not many years ago Naegeli\r\nlooked upon it as an entity distinct from scurvy on rickets. The subject\r\nattained additional importance through an epidemic of infantile scurvy,\r\nwhich broke out in Berlin in 1898, among infants who received milk from\r\none of the largest dairies. The episode led to prolonged discussion in\r\nthe Berlin Medical Society, and to several excellent papers, among\r\nwhich that by Neumann deserves particular mention.\r\n\r\nThe disorder has been reported in Holland by DeBruin, who recorded\r\nnumerous cases; in Denmark, by Hirschsprung, who refused to recognize\r\nits scorbutic nature; in Italy, by Concetti, and by others. It was not\r\nlong before there were reports of cases from almost every part of the\r\nworld, including Australia (Money) and East India (Nichols).\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that scurvy is endemic among adults in Russia, we\r\nshould also expect to find infantile scurvy widespread in that country.\r\nIn point of fact, quite the contrary seems to be the case. In connection\r\nwith the great scurvy epidemic in Russia (1898-99), Tschudakoff\r\npersonally examined over 10,000 persons and found 11.11 per cent. of the\r\npeople sick with this disease. He states that in the course of this\r\nlarge experience he did not meet with a single case under the age of\r\nfive years. Fuerst writes that Filatow, the great Russian children's\r\nspecialist, declared that he knew of no case of Barlow's disease\r\ndescribed in the Russian literature. This is not literally correct, as\r\nDoepp described an epidemic of scurvy in the St. Petersburg Foundling\r\nAsylum occurring in 1831. It serves to emphasize, however, the paucity\r\nof cases among infants in this great land of endemic adult scurvy.\r\nLyabmow, in referring to the scurvy in Kazan, tells us that among 28,000\r\ncases only a few infants were affected, and Rauchfuss made the statement\r\nat the International Congress at Copenhagen, in 1884, that although he\r\nhad seen a great many cases of scurvy, he had never seen it in children\r\none to two years of age. We shall not, in this place, comment on this\r\ninteresting and apparently paradoxical situation, but shall have\r\noccasion to refer to it in considering the pathogenesis. It may be added\r\nthat in Norway and Sweden, where scurvy is to some extent also endemic\r\namong the adult population, there is a similar lack of scurvy among\r\ninfants.\r\n\r\n=Scurvy in the World War.=--The greatest advance in medicine during the\r\npast generation has been in the fields of hygiene and preventive\r\nmedicine. One might therefore have expected that the World War would\r\nhave differed from previous wars in a notable absence of scurvy among\r\nthe troops and the civilian population. This is true to a limited degree\r\nonly. Reports which have been published in the course of the war, and\r\nespecially since hostilities have ceased, show that the troops who were\r\nincapacitated by scurvy must have numbered many thousands. As was to be\r\nexpected, scurvy occurred most often in Russia, where it is endemic. The\r\nlargest number of cases was reported by Boerich, who as director of a\r\nRed Cross Central Station in Russia saw 1343 cases. Other German\r\nphysicians who had charge of caring for the Russian prisoners give\r\naccounts of the occurrence of some hundreds of cases of scurvy. An\r\narticle by Much and Baumbach gains added interest from the novel\r\nsuggestion that scurvy is transmitted by means of vermin. That scurvy\r\nmust have reached large proportions is shown by the fact that in July,\r\n1916, a medical commission was sent by the Germans to investigate the\r\nscurvy in a Russian army corps, and that it was necessary to establish\r\nfor this disease in every division a sanatorium comprising 100 beds.\r\nHoerschelman, who wrote an account of this investigation, blames the bad\r\nhygienic surroundings, the lack of sleep, the overexertion, as well as\r\nthe deficiency of food, for the occurrence of the epidemic. As usual,\r\nvery few cases occurred among officers. He describes a number of\r\ninstances where scurvy was feigned by rubbing the gums and making them\r\nbleed, or by irritating them with the juice of tobacco. These reports on\r\nscurvy in Russia bring us little new from a purely medical standpoint.\r\nThey emphasize the occurrence of night-blindness as an early and\r\nfrequent symptom. It is difficult to judge whether this manifestation\r\nwas due entirely to the scurvy, or was in part the result of other\r\ndeficiencies in the diet. For instance, Hift states that the\r\nnight-blindness was cured by cod liver oil, or by the water in which\r\nbeef liver had been cooked. This would point rather to a deficiency of\r\nthe fat-soluble vitamine, as these substances could have little effect\r\nin curing scurvy. The cases reported by Wassermann, where neuritic pains\r\nin the legs played a considerable rôle, evidently are also not simple\r\nscurvy, but may well be the result of more than one food deficiency or a\r\ncomplicating ostitis. In the same way some reports show clearly that\r\n\"hunger edema\" complicated scurvy.\r\n\r\nScurvy occurred next in frequency among the nations neighboring Russia.\r\nSpeyer tells us that a German sanitary commission was sent to Bulgaria\r\nlargely with the object of investigating scurvy in that country. The\r\nexcellent monograph on the pathology of scurvy just written by Aschoff\r\nand Koch was founded on an experience in Roumania among Turkish, German\r\nand Austrian soldiers. Added to its other woes the Servian army was\r\nvisited by scurvy. Wiltshire gives us a description of this disease\r\nbased on an observation of 3000 cases in the first half of the year\r\n1917. In regard to scurvy in this part of the world, Morawitz writes\r\nthat when he reached Roumania he was surprised to find scurvy the most\r\nprevalent disease in the army, and that since the spring of 1917 it was\r\nwidely disseminated among the German troops. Lobmeyer writes of scurvy\r\namong the Turkish troops, and Disqué reports 500 cases among prisoners\r\ncaptured in Turkestan.\r\n\r\nAlong the Western front very few cases are described. There is an\r\naccount by Korbsch of 51 cases in this area in 1915. Schreiber describes\r\n30 cases among the German prisoners of war captured in the beginning of\r\n1917, which were diagnosed as purpuric rheumatism. Arneth recounts that\r\nsporadic cases of scurvy occurred among the German troops, especially\r\namong the older soldiers, and that in many cases this was combined with\r\nthe hunger edema. He attributes the scurvy to a dependence on dehydrated\r\nvegetables in the ration.\r\n\r\nFrom all these accounts it is evident that scurvy played an important\r\nrôle in the general nutrition of the troops on the Eastern front.\r\nProbably it was of the latent variety, which is exceedingly difficult to\r\ndiagnose, but which increases the susceptibility to infection, and\r\nintensifies the severity of all medical or surgical diseases. Von\r\nNiedner takes this point of view, stating that although scurvy had been\r\nlargely prevented in this war, the obscure rudimentary type had not been\r\neradicated. He remarks upon a fact, noted in our Civil War and other\r\nwars, that under these conditions eruptions assume a hemorrhagic\r\ncharacter in typhoid fever, cerebrospinal fever, rheumatism and other\r\ninfections. Pick made a similar observation at a medical meeting in\r\nVienna in reference to scurvy in the Austrian army, drawing attention to\r\nthe hemorrhagic diathesis existing among the troops and expressing the\r\nopinion that scurvy was occurring in this war as in previous wars.\r\n\r\nVery little scurvy seems to have broken out among the British troops in\r\nEurope. Thirty-two cases were reported as occurring in the middle of\r\n1915 at a divisional rest station in France. It made marked inroads,\r\nhowever, on the health of the Colonial troops in Mesopotamia. In the\r\nreport of the Mesopotamia Commission we read that 7500 men were lost to\r\nthe force in 19 weeks as a result of scurvy, and that this happened in\r\nthe summer of 1916 although additions had been made to the ration in the\r\nprevious spring. A conception of the extent of the scurvy may be formed\r\nfrom the accompanying table, published by Willcox:\r\n\r\n                                     Scurvy      Beriberi\r\n                                   (Indians)    (British)\r\n\r\n    1916 (July 1--Dec. 31)           11,445        104\r\n    1917                              2,199         84\r\n    1918                                825         51\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that thousands of cases occurred among the Indian\r\ntroops. This was due to the fact that the British ate more potatoes and\r\nfresh meat. In his official report of the outbreak of scurvy among\r\nIndian troops, Colonel Hehir writes: \"The only vegetable now allowed is\r\n2 ounces of potatoes and the only fresh meat 28 ounces a week. It is\r\nvery doubtful whether this authorized ration, if not supplemented by\r\nother vegetables and more meat, is sufficient to prevent scurvy.\" In the\r\naccount which this officer gives of the medical conditions during the\r\nsiege of Kut-el-Amara, it is stated that there were 1050 admissions for\r\nscurvy, fully developed, incipient and latent. It is remarked that those\r\nIndians who ate horseflesh were decidedly less affected. From the fact\r\nthat special hospitals for scurvy were established in June, 1916, at\r\nBagdad, Amora and Basrah, it is evident that a large number of cases\r\nmust have been encountered. Most significant in this connection,\r\nhowever, are the preventive measures which were instituted by the\r\nBritish government. A body of 256 men, designated as the Madras\r\nGardener's Corps, were dispatched to Mesopotamia to plant gardens all\r\nover the country and to supply packets of seeds to various units. At\r\nBagdad alone their output of vegetables was over 400,000 pounds. This\r\ncertainly constitutes a remarkable innovation in the hygiene of armies.\r\n\r\nThe French army was not entirely spared from scurvy. In 1917 Harvier, an\r\narmy surgeon, was surprised to discover that 95 per cent. of the 800\r\ntroops of which he had charge suffered from scurvy; he tells us that\r\nother epidemic centres were recognized later outside this sector.\r\nElsewhere we read of the occurrence of scurvy in France, involving 40\r\nper cent. of the 1700 men of the South African Labor Corps, and that\r\nthis disorder was still more serious in another company owing to the\r\nfact that it was not recognized (Dyke).[4] Benoit reported 63 cases\r\nwhich he discovered in 1917 among 300 laborers. According to his\r\naccount, all these laborers received the same food, and those with\r\nscurvy recovered quite independently of any change in the dietary.\r\n\r\n[4] The writer adds that he believes that the health of the natives at\r\nhome is protected by Kaffir beer, which they consume even to the amount\r\nof 3 gallons a day, and which is made from germinated Kaffir corn. This\r\ncereal is germinated by steeping it in water for forty-eight hours and\r\nis then dried in the sun. Only enough is prepared for one brew. The\r\nFrench prepared a similar fermented beverage for these South African\r\nlaborers; the sole difference in its mode of preparation was that the\r\ncorn had not been germinated.\r\n\r\nThere are many accounts of scurvy among the Italian troops. Vannutelli\r\ngives a description of an epidemic of some 200 cases of infectious\r\npurpura with manifestations of hemorrhagic scurvy. Another writer\r\ninforms us that in June, 1916, scurvy broke out among some Italian\r\ntroops stationed at an altitude of 1500 to 2000 metres (Gingui).\r\nVallardi gives an account of 180 cases among Italian troops in\r\nMacedonia, accompanied by slight jaundice and enlargement of the glands.\r\n\r\nThe American soldiers seem to have been practically spared from scurvy.\r\nThis was due probably to their ample ration and to the fact that\r\nthey were in the field for a comparatively short period. The\r\nSurgeon-General's report to date, which has been kindly furnished me,\r\nshowed but 5 cases in 1917 occurring in Europe and the United States,\r\nand but 15 cases reported during the year 1918.\r\n\r\n_The civilian population_ of the various warring countries was by no\r\nmeans spared. There are no reports from Russia to indicate the extent of\r\nscurvy, but from what is known of the food conditions prevailing there\r\ntoward the end of the war, one can be certain that the number must have\r\nbeen large. The greatest amount of scurvy has been reported from\r\nAustria, more particularly from Vienna. Previous to the war scurvy was a\r\nrare disease in this city, both among adults and infants. During the\r\nwar, however, as the result of a lack of fresh food and the dependence\r\non dehydrated vegetables, a large number of cases developed. Tobler\r\nreports over 200 cases in children between the ages of two and fifteen\r\nyears, which occurred in 1917 in child-caring institutions where the\r\nmilk supply was markedly deficient, where fresh vegetables were lacking,\r\nand the supply of potatoes gave out about Christmas, 1916. A conception\r\nof the deficiency of the milk supply may be gained from the statement\r\nthat there were but sixteen quarts a day for about 1500 people. Some of\r\nthese children were undergoing fresh-air treatment and were out of doors\r\nin the \"sun stations\" day and night. For the cure of these children a\r\nsimple decoction of fir-tops was used, a therapeutic procedure stated by\r\nLind to have been of value in the Russo-Swedish War of 1708.\r\n\r\nThat scurvy must have occurred extensively among the infants in Vienna\r\nmay be gathered from the report of Erdheim, who records 31 autopsies on\r\ninfants under the interesting title of the \"Barlow Heart.\" In Berlin\r\nscurvy occurred also in the foundling asylums, as reported by Eric\r\nMueller and by Brandt. This was caused by a diet of pasteurized milk and\r\ndehydrated vegetables. In an article bearing the suggestive title of \"On\r\na Marked Increase in Barlow's Disease in the Years of the War\r\n1917-1918,\" Epstein states that in Prague there had been an endemic\r\nincrease of infantile scurvy since August, 1917. The only information\r\nregarding scurvy among the adult civilian population of Germany is that\r\nfurnished by Morawitz, who states that this disorder occurred\r\nsporadically. Here again it is probable that there were many latent or\r\nrudimentary cases which were not recognized.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain there are reports which show that scurvy manifested\r\nitself in institutions caring for the poor. In Glasgow we learn of 50\r\ncases developing in the Poor Law Hospital in the course of fifteen\r\nmonths, and in Newcastle of 16 cases appearing in the Poor Law Infirmary\r\nin the course of three months.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that when more detailed reports are available, it will be\r\nfound that there was far more scurvy than was appreciated during the\r\ncourse of the war. It will be impossible, however, to gain even an\r\napproximate knowledge of the extent to which this disorder prevailed, as\r\nin many instances it was inextricably interwoven with other nutritional\r\ndiseases. The situation which Enright describes in Cairo among the\r\nTurkish prisoners suffering from war edema, where there was \"evidently a\r\nscorbutic factor involved,\" probably held true for many other parts of\r\nthe world. War and scurvy must still be regarded as associated evils,\r\nfor war is closely linked with famine and food deprivation--the dominant\r\nfactor in the production of scurvy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPATHOGENESIS AND ETIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outset it may be stated that there is no longer any reason to\r\ndoubt that adult scurvy and infantile scurvy are one and the same\r\ndisease, having an identical pathogenesis. For many years, far longer\r\nthan the facts warranted, there was discussion whether Barlow's disease\r\nwas true scurvy or merely a form or a complication of rickets, or\r\nperhaps a distinct hemorrhagic disease. This question may be relegated\r\nto the past, so that we may proceed to consider the pathogenesis of\r\nscurvy in the infant and in the adult under a common heading.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of studying all the theories which have been advanced\r\nto account for scurvy. They have been manifold and most of them have\r\ndied a natural death. For many years the _potassium deficiency theory_,\r\nsuggested by Garrod, gained wide acceptance. That scurvy should be\r\nattributed to a lack of this salt is readily comprehensible in view of\r\nthe abundance of potassium in the antiscorbutic foodstuffs, the fruits\r\nand the vegetables. It was not long before it was evident that this was\r\nnot the correct solution, as the salts of potassium served neither to\r\nprevent nor to cure scurvy. This theory was accordingly modified to\r\ninclude only organic potassium. Experiment, however, failed to support\r\nthe validity of this hypothesis, and it was gradually abandoned.\r\n\r\nAnother theory which had a short but popular career was the _citric acid\r\ntheory_, which was maintained vigorously by Netter. This explanation\r\nseemed logical in view of the marked potency of the citrous fruits, and\r\nparticularly when it was shown that human milk contains a greater\r\npercentage of the salts of citric acid than cow's milk, and that some of\r\nthese salts are lost in the course of heating. This hypothesis withstood\r\nneither the practical test nor chemical investigation. It was found that\r\nthe various salts of citric acid, either singly or in combination, are\r\nunable to cure scurvy. This treatment has been employed repeatedly on\r\nman and on animals with little or no success; we also have resorted to\r\nit in vain. It was shown, furthermore, that it rested on an insecure\r\nchemical basis, as boiled milk contains but 0.1 g. per litre less citric\r\nacid than raw milk--an amount which is negligible from a therapeutic\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nBefore considering what may be termed the prevailing theories, a few\r\nlines must be devoted to the _acidosis theory_ championed by Sir Almroth\r\nWright. According to this writer scurvy is due primarily to an excess of\r\nacid compared with alkaline food.[5] A theory of this nature was open to\r\nverification, and soon collapsed when put to the test. It was found, in\r\nthe first place, that an addition of alkali was unable to cure\r\nexperimental scurvy. It may be added that we have found it of no value\r\nin infantile scurvy. Holst and Froelich pointed out that potatoes and\r\npeas, two excellent antiscorbutic vegetables, have an alkaline and not\r\nan acid ash; that adding hydrochloric acid to dandelion juice improves\r\nrather than diminishes its potency; that 1 g. of cabbage, which suffices\r\nto protect a guinea-pig from scurvy, does not contain sufficient alkali\r\nto neutralize an acid state; and, finally, that scurvy is not\r\nencountered in the well-established acidosis of diabetes.\r\n\r\n[5] The cases on which Wright based his theory were soldiers who\r\ndeveloped scurvy during the siege of Ladysmith. It is probable that the\r\nmen were suffering from starvation, purpura and dysentery. That they did\r\nnot have scurvy is proved by the fact that they were cured by giving\r\nlactate and bicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to some of the current theories of the etiology of scurvy.\r\nFor years many have held to the _toxic theory_, believing that poisons\r\neither were consumed in the food or formed in the intestine by means of\r\nbacterial action. At present this view is held by the minority. The\r\nsituation in this respect may be compared to that of beriberi, about\r\nwhich there is also no consensus of opinion, a minority attributing it\r\nto the action of an unknown toxin.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the clinical course of scurvy sheds but little light\r\non this aspect, and can be interpreted as well for as against the action\r\nof a toxin. The nervous system, which is well known to be particularly\r\nvulnerable to toxins, is but slightly affected--the cardiorespiratory\r\nphenomena (indicating an involvement of the pneumogastric nerves), the\r\noccasional changes in the optic disks, and the abnormality of the tendon\r\nreflexes constitute the aggregate. In a general way it may be stated\r\nthat the symptoms resemble those brought about by poisons of various\r\nkinds--the cottonseed poisoning in swine, the toxic products of the\r\nwheat embryo, or even mercurial poisoning in man.[6] The nervous\r\nsymptoms, especially the irritability of the heart, remind one of the\r\nenterogenous intoxication or enterotoxic polyneuritis described by Von\r\nNoorden. Such analogies are interesting and suggestive, but can be\r\naccorded little weight in deciding the question at issue.\r\n\r\n[6] In chronic mercurial poisoning the following suggestive symptoms\r\noccur: anemia, bleeding and spongy gums, loosening of the teeth, a\r\nquickened pulse, ulcers of the extremities. At times mercury attacks the\r\nnervous system, producing palsy. The resemblance is heightened by the\r\nfact that calcium metastases have been found in the muscle in\r\nexperimental scurvy (Hart and Lessing) comparable to those\r\ncharacteristic of mercurial poisoning.\r\n\r\nIf a toxin is to be regarded as the proximate cause of infantile scurvy,\r\nthe question naturally arises as to the nature of the toxin. Is it\r\nexogenous or endogenous? There is sound basis for believing that the\r\nhypothetical poison is not introduced preformed in the food. In the\r\nfirst place, infantile scurvy frequently develops in babies who receive\r\nmilk of the very best grade indeed, in contradistinction to rickets,\r\nthis is not preëminently a disease of the poor. Furthermore, there is no\r\nrelation between the concentration of the food mixture and its liability\r\nto induce scurvy. For example, if among a large number of infants\r\nreceiving pasteurized milk from a common source, some are given the milk\r\ndiluted by one-half, others given it diluted by one-third, and still\r\nothers whole milk, the last group will show the least tendency to\r\nscurvy, which we should not expect were the poison contained in the\r\nfood. Nor is it at all uncommon to encounter scurvy in an infant which\r\nhas been fed with a very dilute milk mixture. Another side of this\r\nquestion should, however, be mentioned--stale pasteurized milk is more\r\napt to produce scurvy than the freshly pasteurized, but here again the\r\ninjury is in inverse ratio rather than in direct ratio to the amount\r\nconsumed. There are reports of adult scurvy having been occasioned by\r\ndecomposed food, such as Torup's investigation of Nansen's polar\r\nexpedition, but the diet had not been faultless in other respects. The\r\nexperiments of Jackson and Harley, who produced scurvy in monkeys by\r\nfeeding tainted tinned meat, cannot be unreservedly accepted, as they\r\nare substantiated by no pathological examination of the bones, and the\r\ndiarrhoea and the blood and mucus in the stools do not suggest simple\r\nscurvy.\r\n\r\nOf those who held to the toxic origin of scurvy the majority had in mind\r\nan endogenous toxin, although the conception of the nature of this\r\npoison varied greatly. The minority report of the American Pediatric\r\nSociety states that \"scurvy appears to be a chronic ptomaine poisoning\r\ndue to the absorption of toxins.\" Neumann considered scurvy a chronic\r\npoisoning, formed probably from the albumin of the milk, and considered\r\nthe fact that the infant refused to take the harmful food as weighty\r\nevidence of its toxic nature. Kohlbrugge included scurvy in his group of\r\n\"fermentive diseases,\" due to the overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the\r\nintestine, which are normally restrained by the acid reaction of the\r\nchyme. McCollum and Pitz, on the basis of a study of experimental\r\nscurvy, suggested that as the result of a break in the metabolism it\r\nmight be due to the retention of fæces and consequent absorption of\r\ntoxins. Still more recently Gerstenberger suggested that as the result\r\nof the break in the metabolism of carbohydrates, a defunctioning\r\nsubstance, possibly oxalic acid, is produced, which has a strong\r\naffinity for calcium.\r\n\r\nIt is of no avail to discuss these various hypotheses--the formation of\r\nintestinal toxins--except where they are based on observations which can\r\nbe tested and controlled. This is true solely of _the relation of\r\nconstipation to scurvy_, and we shall confine ourselves therefore to a\r\nconsideration of this aspect of the question.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question whether retention of fæces of itself can bring\r\nabout scurvy; this is excluded by the marked instances of constipation\r\nfrequently encountered among thriving babies. The majority of bottle-fed\r\nbabies and a large number of the breast-fed suffer from a greater or\r\nless degree of constipation. On looking over our records of infantile\r\nscurvy from this point of view, and comparing them with non-scorbutic\r\ninfants, we have not been able to note a characteristic distinction.\r\nSome of the infants had normal stools, others suffered from\r\nconstipation, while the records of a great number showed occasional\r\nloose stools. Furthermore, in cases of latent or subacute infantile\r\nscurvy, it was of no moment whether a laxative was given or whether\r\nconstipation was induced by means of opium. The report of the American\r\nPediatric Society shows that the majority have had a similar experience;\r\nthe bowels were regular in seventy-four instances, irregular in fifteen,\r\nconstipated in one hundred and twenty-six, and diarrhoeal in\r\nseventy-seven. In this connection, it may be pointed out that the\r\npreparation termed \"malt soup,\" the diet which in our experience has\r\nbeen most frequently associated with scurvy, is essentially laxative,\r\nand, on the other hand, that one of the most potent antiscorbutics is\r\npotato, which has no definite laxative property. It may be added, as\r\nnoted elsewhere, that scurvy developed in infants in spite of their\r\nreceiving cod liver oil or olive oil for long periods. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the retention of fæces is not the essential factor in\r\nthe etiology of scurvy. Its secondary rôle, especially after scurvy has\r\ndeveloped, will be considered later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn order to elucidate this question Torrey and Hess made a study of the\r\nrelation of the intestinal flora to the scurvy of guinea-pigs and of\r\ninfants. In guinea-pigs they found in the intestinal tract merely such\r\nbacteria as are encountered on the oats and hay fed these animals. The\r\nbacteria were few in number and hardly any were actively proteolytic.\r\nFurthermore, there was no change in the flora on adding antiscorbutic\r\nfood, although the scorbutic symptoms disappeared. Recently Givens and\r\nHoffman, as the result of a similar study, have come to the same\r\nconclusion. The investigation of infants led to similar results, and is\r\nillustrated in Table 1. It will be seen that the infants were all on a\r\nhigh carbohydrate diet, and that in two instances the flora was\r\ncompared, not only during the active scorbutic process, but after orange\r\njuice had been given for a week or more. The bacteria were such as one\r\nshould expect on a diet rich in carbohydrates; putrefactive organisms\r\nwere present only in small numbers; and in the case in which they were\r\nmost numerous (S), they had disappeared upon the subsequent examination,\r\nalthough the scurvy had become more marked. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat in the scurvy of infants as well as of guinea-pigs there is no\r\novergrowth of putrefactive bacteria in the intestinal tract, and\r\ntherefore no basis for the hypothesis of ptomaine or similar\r\nintoxication. Other poisons may, however, be absorbed from the intestine\r\nas the result of a prolonged deprivation of an essential vitamine.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE 1\r\n                     FECAL FLORA OF SCORBUTIC INFANTS\r\n  =======================================================================\r\n    |             |       |          |    M |         |\r\n  I |             |       |          |S   a |         |\r\n  n |             |       |          |o   t |         |\r\n  f |    Diet.    | Date. |Scorbutic |u o e |  Types  |    Remarks.\r\n  a |             |       |condition.|r f r |   of    |\r\n  n |             |       |          |c   i |bacteria.|\r\n  t |             |       |          |e   a |         |\r\n    |             |       |          |    l.|         |\r\n  --+-------------+-------+----------+------+---------+------------------\r\n  M.|Malt soup and|Dec.  1|Subacute  |Rectum|B.       |{Normal infant's\r\n    |  cereal     |       |          |      | acidoph.|{ flora.\r\n    |             |       |          |      |B.       |{Gram + bac.\r\n    |             |       |          |      | bifidus |{ predominant.\r\n    |             |       |          |      |M.       |{No spore-bearing\r\n    |             |       |          |      | ovalis  |{ or putrefactive\r\n    |             |       |          |      |         |{ types.\r\n    |             |       |          |      |B. coli  |{B. acidoph. about\r\n    |             |       |          |      |         |{ 40% viable bact.\r\n    |   Do.       |Dec.  4|   Do.    |  Do. |   Do.   |       Do.\r\n    |Same, also   |Dec. 11|Sub-      |  Do. |   Do.   |{Relatively more\r\n    | 20 c.c.     |       |periosteal|      |         |{ B. coli.\r\n    | liquid      |       |hemorrhage|      |         |{Many B. bifidus\r\n    | petrolatum, |       |          |      |         |{No putrefactive\r\n    | one week    |       |          |      |         |{ bact.\r\n    |Same diet,   |Dec. 21|Markedly  |  Do. |   Do.   | Normal infants'\r\n    | oil stopped,|       |improved  |      |         |  flora.\r\n    | _orange     |       |          |      |         | Bacteria as\r\n    | juice_      |       |          |      |         | above.\r\n    | 10 days     |       |          |      |         |\r\n  K.|Malt soup and|Dec. 11|Sub-      |Rectum|Strepto- |{Gram - bacteria\r\n    | cereal      |       |periosteal|      | cocci   |{ predominant.\r\n    |             |       |hemorrhage|      |B. coli  |{B. coli gram +\r\n    |             |       |          |      |M. ovalis|{ diploc. numerous\r\n    |             |       |          |      |         |{B. acidoph. few.\r\n    |             |       |          |      |         |{B. bifidus few.\r\n    |Do. +        |Dec. 21|Markedly  |  Do. |B.       |{Gram + bact.\r\n    | _orange     |       |improved  |      | bifidus |{ predominant.\r\n    | juice_      |       |          |      |B. coli  |{Many B. bifidus.\r\n    | (60 c.c.),  |       |          |      |Strepto- |{Streptoc.\r\n    |  8 days     |       |          |      | cocci   |{ unchanged.\r\n    |             |       |          |      |         |\r\n  S.|Formula:     |Dec. 21|Mild      |Rectum|B. lact. |{Gram + and -\r\n    | Cream,      |       |scurvy    |      | aerog.  |{ bact. about\r\n    | water,      |       |          |      |B. coli  |{ equal.

This viewpoint\r\nwas maintained by the famous Boerhaave and supported with all the weight\r\nof his authority by Villemin in the seventeenth century. It is a view\r\nheld by many, if not by the majority, of physicians in Russia to-day,\r\nand recently has been advanced by European army surgeons. This question\r\nillustrates in an interesting manner how the trend of the day influences\r\nmedical thought--it has been suggested lately by Much and Baumbach that\r\nthe scurvy microörganism may be carried by means of lice. But clinical\r\nexperience points absolutely against the infectious nature of scurvy.\r\nIndeed, the only episode which lends any support to this opinion is its\r\nwidespread and seemingly epidemic character; the fallacy of such\r\ndeductions has been well illustrated in regard to beriberi, which for\r\nmany years was regarded as an infectious and communicable disease. The\r\nfact that whenever scurvy occurs among a body of troops the officers are\r\nspared, constitutes convincing evidence against its communicability.\r\nThis peculiarity of incidence was noted by Hoerschelman and others in\r\nthe recent World War, and is referred to in the Report of the War of the\r\nRebellion. Many of the earlier writers, in discussing the occurrence of\r\nship scurvy, drew attention to the paucity of cases among the officers.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to bacteriological studies we find that some years ago\r\nAusset claimed to have isolated \"a pasteurella type of organism\" from a\r\ncase of infantile scurvy, and suggested it as the causative agent of\r\nthis disorder. On the other hand, Hart, Rehn, Hirschsprung, von Starck,\r\nSchmorl, and recently Boerich, have failed to find bacteria in the\r\nblood, although the total number of cultures must be admitted to have\r\nbeen small. Czerny and Keller report negative bacterial growth from\r\nfluid aspirated from affected joints.\r\n\r\nThe only articles considering this important question from the\r\nexperimental side are those of Jackson and Moody, and of Moore, who\r\nconclude tentatively that scurvy may be a bacterial infection. Jackson\r\nand Moody cultivated a diplococcus from the tissues of scorbutic animals\r\nafter death, reproduced hemorrhages by inoculating cultures of these\r\nmicroörganisms into the circulation, and recovered the bacteria from the\r\ntissues some weeks later. Their results are open to the criticism that\r\nbacteria were found only after death, and that all blood cultures\r\nduring life proved negative. An article by Moore, however, which has\r\njust appeared from this same laboratory, states that \"an organism of the\r\nstreptococcus viridans type was isolated from the blood\" in a case of\r\nadult scurvy. In one instance we recovered an organism of this type from\r\nthe blood of an infant suffering from scurvy. It is highly important\r\nthat more blood cultures should be carried out in the course of human or\r\nanimal scurvy, and that particular note should be made of the stage of\r\nthe disorder when they are taken.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that invasion of the blood-stream does occur readily\r\nin the course of scurvy, but this takes place generally after the\r\ndisease has developed and must be regarded as a secondary phenomenon and\r\ntherefore unessential from an etiologic standpoint. Indeed one of the\r\nstriking and important symptoms of scurvy is the marked susceptibility\r\nto infection (furunculosis, nasal diphtheria, \"grippe,\" etc.), which\r\ncomes about as the result of the nutritional disturbance. An excellent\r\nexample of this interrelationship is the \"epidemic\" of hemorrhagic\r\nscurvy described in the chapter on symptomatology. Hemorrhages coming\r\nabout in this way should be regarded as focal complications rather than\r\nas truly scorbutic. It should be realized that, at the present time, it\r\nis not possible to distinguish between local symptoms which are truly\r\nnutritional or scorbutic in nature, and those which are bacterial and of\r\nsecondary origin.\r\n\r\nThe newest theory, and the one at present most widely accepted, is the\r\n_vitamine_ (_accessory factor_) _theory_. It was evident to Lind in the\r\nseventeenth century that scurvy could be prevented and cured by means of\r\nfruits or vegetables, a fact which became increasingly clear to\r\nsucceeding generations. Until the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, however, this miraculous virtue of plants stimulated little\r\ninquiry and no research. As far back as 1841 Budd realized that \"the\r\nexplanation depended on the study of organic chemistry, and the\r\nexperiments of physiologists,\" but until recently it was not perceived\r\nthat the solution of the problem involved the introduction of a new\r\nchemical factor. This view suddenly took shape after Eijkman in 1897\r\nshowed the nature of polyneuritis in fowl, and Hopkins in 1906, going a\r\nstep farther, demonstrated the necessity of one or more unidentified\r\nfood factors for the normal nutrition of the rat. The work which\r\nestablished this novel theory on a scientific basis in relation to\r\nscurvy was the classic investigation of Holst and Froelich, referred to\r\nso frequently in connection with experimental scurvy. These\r\ninvestigators showed that the mere drying of vegetables was sufficient\r\nto deprive them of their antiscorbutic power, although from a chemical\r\nstandpoint they seemed unaltered; that high degrees of heat had\r\ngenerally the same effect; that under certain conditions these foods\r\nwithstood prolonged heating, demonstrating that the antiscorbutic factor\r\nwas not a ferment; that acids and alkalies played no essential rôle in\r\nthe etiology; that fats, proteins and carbohydrates were not significant\r\nfactors; that as little as 1.0 g. of cabbage suffices to afford\r\nprotection to a guinea-pig. In other words, by a process of exclusion\r\nthey showed that it is a disorder due to the lack of an unidentified\r\nfood factor.\r\n\r\nSubsequent studies, carried out within the past few years, have served\r\nonly to strengthen this viewpoint. For example, an \"artificial orange\r\njuice\" composed of the various salts, citric acid, and sucrose in the\r\nproportions in which they are found in the natural juice, failed,\r\nin the experience of Hess and Unger, to protect or to cure\r\nguinea-pigs--demonstrating that this preparation did not contain the\r\nessential factor. In the same way, Harden and Zilva were able to protect\r\nanimals from scurvy with a preparation of lemon juice which had been\r\nalmost entirely deprived of its salts. It is needless to multiply these\r\nexamples. It is sufficient to state that there has been no investigation\r\nduring the last years of intensive study of scurvy, which has tended to\r\nweaken the vitamine hypothesis. It may be stated, therefore, that\r\nexperiments have demonstrated that scurvy is due essentially to the lack\r\nof a specific vitamine. It is unwise to proceed farther and place it in\r\nthe group of so-called \"deficiency diseases,\" including beriberi,\r\npellagra, etc., unless the reservation is made that these several\r\ndiseases may present marked differences. It is quite possible that one\r\nmay be what might be termed a simple deficiency disease, whereas another\r\nmay have important additional etiologic factors. At any rate, unless it\r\nis realized that there has been no proof that all are due to similar\r\ndeficiencies, we may, by stamping them all alike and by grouping them\r\ntogether, be misled into taking their close relationship for granted. In\r\nregard to scurvy, there may well be other etiologic factors, but they\r\nare of a secondary character. Bacterial invasion has been referred to in\r\nthis connection, and it is possible that toxins are absorbed from the\r\nintestine after nutrition has been disturbed. Diarrhoea and digestive\r\ndisturbances may play a rôle. Whether the total intake of food or the\r\ncorrelation of its constituents--protein, carbohydrate, fat and\r\nsalts--affects the action of the vitamine, is one which has not been\r\nwell studied clinically or experimentally. In regard to beriberi, it is\r\nclaimed that there is a direct ratio between the quantity of\r\ncarbohydrate ingested and the amount of vitamine required. No such\r\ninterrelationship exists in regard to scurvy. This was evident a few\r\nyears ago (1917) when some infants receiving pasteurized milk, prepared\r\nwith the addition of 3 per cent. flour, did not tend to develop scurvy\r\nmore readily than others receiving simple pasteurized milk. A\r\nconsideration of the antiscorbutic vitamine will be postponed for a\r\nsubsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=--In considering infantile scurvy we are concerned almost\r\nentirely with the artificially-fed baby. It is true that in the\r\nliterature we meet with scattered reports of _scurvy in breast-fed\r\nbabies_ and that these cases seem to constitute a noteworthy group; in\r\npoint of fact, they are comparatively few. The collective investigation\r\nof the American Pediatric Society includes ten infants who had been\r\ngiven breast milk exclusively, and Concetti adds another ten in his\r\ncompilation of 682 cases.[7] In spite of their paucity these cases\r\nrequire separate consideration because they represent an important\r\naspect from an etiologic standpoint. How are we to explain the fact that\r\nhuman milk may lead to rather than protect against this disorder? On\r\ninvestigating more closely it is found that these cases differ in\r\nseveral important respects from the group which has been artificially\r\nfed. They are of a different age; instead of being in the second half\r\nyear of life they are generally but a few months old. Furthermore, the\r\nsigns are not the same. The hemorrhages involve the upper extremities\r\nfully as frequently as the lower extremities, and often appear at\r\nunusual sites--for example, on the scalp or as large subcutaneous\r\neffusions at various parts of the body. In many instances it has been\r\nnoted that the nursing mothers were suffering from some debilitating\r\ndisease such as tuberculosis or syphilis, or had an insufficient supply\r\nof milk, or that there had been some other unusual factor, as Freund has\r\nshown in an article devoted to this particular aspect. It is not\r\nnecessary, however, to fall back on these attendant circumstances to\r\nexclude from consideration many of the cases. For example, Crandall's\r\ncase of \"scurvy in an infant of six weeks\" should be invalidated, not\r\nbecause, as Freund suggests, the mother had rheumatism and insufficient\r\nmilk, but because of the age of the infant, and the course of the\r\ndisease; first one arm was involved, then the other, then hemorrhages\r\nappeared on the skin, and finally it was cured by giving a teaspoonful\r\nof fresh cream before each nursing. Had the baby really suffered from\r\nscurvy it could not have been cured by this means. Southgate's case must\r\nalso be rejected, not because the mother was tuberculous but in view of\r\nthe symptoms--the arms and legs were pseudoparetic, \"the legs, feet and\r\nhands were double their normal size,\" and moderately large hemorrhages\r\nwere present on the back and chest. It seems hardly necessary to discuss\r\nin detail the score of cases which comprise this group, as, in general,\r\nthe same criticism applies to all. Some evidently were congenital\r\nsyphilis, still more must be regarded as sepsis, and others as unknown\r\ntoxic conditions. Apart from these cases the question must be considered\r\nwhether scurvy can occur in a breast-fed infant. Personally, we have\r\nnever met with a case of this kind, and, as Finkelstein aptly remarks,\r\nthere has been \"no necropsy of a breast-fed case or conclusive X-ray\r\npicture.\" It seems possible only if an infant, for a period of months,\r\nhas obtained a scanty supply of milk, or when the milk has been\r\nexceedingly deficient in the antiscorbutic vitamine. Even under such\r\nconditions it does not seem possible for scurvy to become manifest in\r\nsix weeks (Crandall's case), or in four weeks, as in a case reported by\r\nthe American Pediatric Society, unless we believe that the infant\r\nsuffered also from a certain degree of intrapartum or congenital scurvy.\r\nIn view of the fact that an infant requires about one pint of milk to\r\nfurnish it with an adequate daily quota of the antiscorbutic factor, it\r\nis theoretically possible, under extreme conditions, for it to become\r\nscorbutic, in spite of being nursed at the breast. Such an occurrence\r\nmust be regarded as exceedingly rare, far more so than the current\r\nstatistics illustrate, for considerably less than a pint of milk a day\r\nwill prevent the appearance of manifest scurvy for a period of several\r\nmonths. Some of the reported cases may have been latent scurvy, rendered\r\nacute by a complicating bacterial infection.\r\n\r\n[7] These figures constitute an irrefutable argument against the\r\nstatement frequently made that a monotonous diet leads to scurvy. It is\r\nonly when the monotonous diet does not contain an adequate quantity of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine that it is to be feared.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that by ascertaining _the occurrence of infantile\r\nscurvy in countries where it is endemic_, we could learn under what\r\nconditions and how frequently breast-fed babies develop this disorder.\r\nApproaching the question from this angle, it is found that the\r\navailable data is meagre and not entirely convincing. Peculiarly enough\r\ninfantile scurvy has rarely been reported from Russia, where scurvy is,\r\nin many sections, endemic. For example, although Tschudakoff, who\r\npersonally examined over 10,000 persons, in connection with the great\r\nscurvy epidemic in Russia (1898-99) found 11.11 per cent. of the people\r\nsuffering from this disease, he did not meet with a single case under\r\nthe age of five years. Fuerst writes that Filatow, the celebrated\r\nRussian children's specialist, declared that he knew of no instance of\r\nBarlow's disease described in the Russian literature.[8] Shortly after\r\nthe recent war scurvy broke out among the wet-nurses in an infant asylum\r\nin Vienna. A very few of the infants nursed by these women developed the\r\ndisorder, far fewer than might have been expected (personal\r\ncommunication). Hopkins recently wrote a communication to the effect\r\nthat in the island of Aruba, in the Dutch West Indies, they had been\r\nunable to grow any crops in 1912, 1913, 1914, that 3000 cases of scurvy\r\nhad developed there during the year 1915, and that in 1917 it was again\r\nbeing noted. In answer to a personal inquiry regarding the occurrence of\r\nscurvy among the infants of Aruba, he wrote that \"infantile scurvy is\r\nvery rare,\" although \"most all of the babies are breast-fed for about a\r\nyear.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[8] This is not literally correct, as Doepp described an epidemic of\r\nscurvy in the St. Petersburg Foundling Asylum occurring in 1831.\r\n\r\n[9] During 1919 in Aruba there were 293 births and 30 deaths under one\r\nyear, most of these deaths being due to intestinal diseases. The mothers\r\nsubsist mainly on maize or guinea small corn, with some goat and sheep\r\nmeat, and a little fresh fish, but no vegetables or fruit. The water is\r\nbrackish.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, descriptions of the coincidence of scurvy in mother\r\nand nursling are even more fragmentary; in fact, we have been able to\r\nfind but two reports of this kind. The one most frequently cited is that\r\nof Cheadle, which consists merely of the following bald statement: \"With\r\nthe exception of one or two doubtful cases, of which the details of\r\nbreast-feeding and diet are imperfectly given, the only instances of\r\nscurvy arising in sucklings are those when the nursing mother has been\r\nsuffering from scurvy at the time.\" The other report has been gleaned\r\nfrom a recent editorial in the _British Medical Journal_, which refers\r\nto the above mentioned outbreak of scurvy in Vienna, affecting in some\r\ncases both mothers and breast-fed infants.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to pass judgment on this question in view of the paucity\r\nof data. In the near future, probably, when we learn in detail about the\r\nepidemics of scurvy which occurred during and immediately following the\r\nwar, we shall be in a better position to weigh its pros and cons. In\r\nview of the above data it does not seem that nursing infants readily\r\ndevelop scurvy, even though their mothers do not obtain a full quota of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine in their food. This appears to be the clinical\r\nresult, whatever its interpretation may be. It cannot be explained on\r\nthe assumption that human milk contains a particularly large quota of\r\nthis factor. In a test carried out to elucidate this question it was\r\nfound that eight ounces a day of breast milk was insufficient to\r\nalleviate the symptoms in a case of scurvy, and that twelve ounces\r\nbarely sufficed. This milk was from a woman who was on a liberal diet\r\ncontaining an adequate supply of vegetables. It had been previously\r\ndemonstrated that sixteen ounces of cow's milk is sufficient to cure\r\ninfantile scurvy, so that it is evident that human and cow's milk do not\r\ndiffer essentially in this respect. There are, however, other factors to\r\nbe considered--for example, the incomparable freshness of the milk\r\nsuckled from the breast, which may endow it with additional potency, or\r\nthe possibility that the lack of vitamine may be compensated for by the\r\nlarge quantity of milk consumed. It also may not be entirely immaterial\r\nwhether the vitamine is supplied in one dose, as, for example a daily\r\nfeeding of orange or tomato juice, or whether this factor is furnished\r\nto the infant in frequent small quantities in the mother's milk\r\nthroughout the day. In this connection we cannot help contrasting the\r\nrelation of beriberi to breast feeding. As is well known, infants which\r\ndevelop beriberi are almost always nursed and not bottle-fed, and show\r\nsigns of this disorder, although the mothers are in apparent health, and\r\ngive no clinical evidence of disease.\r\n\r\nTurning to a consideration of _the artificially-fed infant_, there\r\nexists a somewhat similar situation in regard to the occurrence of\r\nscurvy on a diet of raw cow's milk. In almost all reports of this kind\r\nthe quantitative viewpoint is entirely disregarded, and little or\r\nnothing is stated to indicate how much milk the infant consumed. And yet\r\nthis factor is of essential importance in interpreting the cause of the\r\nnutritional failure. It is clear, for example, that if a baby receives\r\nbut eight ounces daily of raw milk--one-half the requisite amount--it\r\nmay well develop scurvy, notwithstanding the fact that the milk has not\r\nbeen heated. In addition to the quantity, there are other factors which\r\nplay a greater or less rôle in the relation of raw milk to the etiology\r\nof scurvy. It is no doubt of consequence whether the fodder of the cows\r\nwas rich or very poor in the antiscorbutic factor, and, accordingly,\r\nwhether the baby received what may be termed an \"antiscorbutic-rich\" or\r\nan \"antiscorbutic-poor\" milk. Furthermore, the age of the milk must be\r\nborne in mind, for we have found that even raw milk loses some of its\r\npotency on becoming stale.[10]\r\n\r\n[10] Moore raises the interesting question as to whether a diseased\r\ncondition of the cow may decrease the vitamines of the milk--whether a\r\ncertain outbreak of scurvy among guinea-pigs might have been due to\r\ntheir having been fed on the milk of a cow suffering from experimental\r\nstreptococcus mastitis. If such proves to be the case, it would have an\r\nimportant bearing on the question of scurvy and pseudo-scorbutic\r\nconditions in nursing infants.\r\n\r\nOne of the mooted questions relative to the etiology of scurvy is the\r\nrôle of heated milk, and more particularly of _pasteurized milk_. In\r\nview of the vogue which pasteurization has acquired in the large\r\nmunicipalities, especially in the United States, this aspect has assumed\r\nincreasing importance, and deserves detailed investigation.\r\nPasteurization has achieved so much in limiting the infectious diseases,\r\nespecially the diarrhoeal disorders of infancy, that it has come to be\r\nlooked upon as heresy to deprecate its virtues in any regard.\r\n\r\nIt has become increasingly evident that in the course of pasteurization\r\nmilk loses an important measure of antiscorbutic vitamine. The term\r\npasteurization, when employed in this connection, is not meant to be\r\nsynonymous merely with the heating of milk to 140° to 165° F., but\r\nembraces the entire commercial process--the heating, handling,\r\nsubsequent cooling, aging and all other factors involved. There can be\r\nno doubt that milk which has undergone this elaborate treatment has\r\nsuffered in its antiscorbutic property. In 1914 Hess and Fish reported\r\nmild cases of scurvy occurring among infants who had received milk\r\nheated to a temperature of 165° F. for thirty minutes. This degree of\r\nheat is claimed by many physicians and hygienists, including the\r\nNational Commission on Milk Standards, not to destroy its chemical\r\nconstituents. Nevertheless typical cases of scurvy supervened after this\r\ndiet had been followed for a period of six to nine months. Subsequent\r\nexperience, published by Hess in 1917, with milk heated to only 145° F.,\r\nserved to confirm the previous observations. That these cases were true\r\nscurvy was proved by the fact that a cure resulted when raw milk was\r\nsubstituted. A similar experience in Berlin reported by Neumann and\r\nothers was convincing, but was not heeded in this country. In 1901 one\r\nof the largest dairies in that city established a pasteurizing plant\r\nwhere all milk was raised to a temperature of about 60° C. After an\r\ninterval of some months infantile scurvy began to be reported from\r\nvarious sources throughout the city. Neumann depicts the situation as\r\nfollows: \"Whereas, Heubner, Cassel and myself had seen only thirty-two\r\ncases of scurvy from 1896 to 1900, the number of cases suddenly rose\r\nfrom the year 1901, so that the same observers--not to mention a great\r\nmany others--treated eighty-three cases in 1901 and 1902.\" At a spirited\r\nmeeting held by the Berlin Medical Society in 1903 to discuss this\r\nsubject, Heubner was able to report 65 cases. An investigation was made,\r\nand the pasteurization discontinued. The result was almost immediate,\r\nthe cases decreasing just as suddenly as they had increased. These\r\nreports and others demonstrate that unless additional antiscorbutic food\r\nis given, a diet of pasteurized milk will lead to the development of\r\nscurvy. As the antiscorbutic vitamine is not entirely destroyed by\r\npasteurization, the severity of the disorder will be in inverse ratio to\r\nthe amount of milk which is consumed.\r\n\r\nIt has been our experience that milk pasteurized in the home or\r\ninstitution did not lead to scurvy to the same extent as that which was\r\ncommercially pasteurized. Babies fed on home-pasteurized milk did not\r\ndevelop manifest scurvy. The difference in the two processes consists\r\nmainly in the amount of handling during the process of heating and the\r\nsubsequent aging which the milk undergoes. An interval of forty-eight\r\nhours usually elapses between commercial pasteurization and the delivery\r\nof the milk to the consumer. In New York city most of the better-grade\r\nmilk is pasteurized at the farm, so that it is subjected to a longer\r\nperiod of aging than the poorer grade, which is not pasteurized until it\r\nreaches the city. Although our results indicated the effect of freshness\r\nor staleness on milk which had been heated, they showed also that other\r\nfactors must be involved, for home-pasteurized milk which is forty-eight\r\nhours old is superior to the commercial product of the same age. This\r\ndifference we believe is due to the handling which the milk undergoes,\r\nto the mechanical processes involved in commercial pasteurization.\r\n\r\nIn considering this aspect of the development of infantile scurvy on a\r\ndiet of heated milk, it is of interest to refer to the experience of\r\nSwitzerland and of France. In 1907 Bernheim-Karrer reported nine cases\r\nof scurvy which occurred on \"homogenized\" milk. This milk is forced\r\nbetween rapidly-rotating surfaces at a temperature of 55° to 65° C. at a\r\npressure of 150 atmospheres. This process had been introduced the year\r\nprevious by a large dairy which was well known for its excellent grade\r\nof milk. Before this innovation, milk usually had been boiled for a long\r\nwhile before being fed to infants. In France a similar epidemic of\r\nscurvy followed the introduction of the use of homogenized milk (lait\r\nfixé). Lecornu gives an interesting account of this episode, remarking\r\non the large number of cases of scurvy occurring on this milk compared\r\nwith sterilized milk, which was employed so much more extensively. These\r\nexperiences furnish excellent examples of _the harmful effect of\r\nindustrial methods on milk_, especially on its antiscorbutic vitamine.\r\nLecornu also emphasized the scorbutic influence of \"lait maternisé,\"\r\nwhich is similar to the German Gaertner milk, and is subjected to\r\ndilution, centrifugation, and sterilization.[11] He states that before\r\nthis preparation was introduced scurvy was practically unknown in\r\nFrance. Lecornu attributes the deleterious effect of the \"lait\r\nmaternisé\" and the \"lait fixé\" to bacterial contamination, as does\r\nBernheim-Karrer. We believe, rather, that its loss of potency is due to\r\nthe mechanical processes to which it has been subjected.\r\n\r\n[11] In the case of the \"lait maternisé,\" which is a milk of high fat\r\ncontent, the dilution of the preparation also must have been a factor.\r\nOunce for ounce, cream is poorer in antiscorbutic vitamine than an equal\r\nquantity of milk. It is also possible that the mere dilution of\r\nmilk--quite apart from the absolute amount consumed--is not immaterial\r\nin affecting this highly sensitive vitamine.\r\n\r\nBoiled and, more particularly, sterilized milk, is regarded as a common\r\ncause of infantile scurvy and figures prominently among the foods held\r\naccountable for this disorder. It has been pointed out, however, that\r\nthousands of infants, especially in Europe, receive milk of this kind,\r\nand do not develop scurvy. Statistics such as those of Variot, who has\r\ndistributed in his out-patient department, during a period of twelve\r\nyears, 400,000 quarts of sterilized milk (heated in half-litre bottles\r\nand hermetically sealed at the farm) without observing a case of scurvy,\r\nmust be accorded weight in this connection.[12] Escherich, some years\r\npreviously, stated that he did not meet with scurvy in Graz, although he\r\nwas accustomed to feed babies on sterilized milk. Budin, the celebrated\r\nFrench children's specialist, writes: \"As for the so-called infantile\r\nscurvy which is alleged to follow the use of sterilized milk, I have\r\nheard a very great deal about it during the last few years, but I am\r\nstill looking for my first case.\" Evidence from such sources cannot be\r\nsummarily cast aside, but must be given due consideration. It is evident\r\nthat the mere heating or sterilization of milk, although it reduces the\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine, does not do so to a degree sufficient to lead to\r\nthe production of clinical scurvy. Our experience accords with that of\r\nthe above observers. Some years ago we fed infants with milk which had\r\nbeen boiled for five minutes, and, at another time, made use of\r\nhome-made evaporated milk which had been heated for a period of\r\nseventeen hours, until it had been reduced to one-eighth its volume.\r\nThis evaporated milk was well borne for months, although slightly\r\ncaramelized in the course of heating, and did not lead to any signs of\r\nscurvy. Clearly there are other factors involved in this question\r\nbesides the mere subjection to heat. We believe that every step in the\r\nprocess is important--the freshness of the milk, whether or not it is\r\nagitated and exposed to the air, whether it is sealed carefully and used\r\nsoon after sterilization,[13] and, finally, whether the baby receives a\r\nsufficient quantity. If this milk, which has certainly lost some of its\r\nvitamine content, is given in small amount, it will not supply an\r\nadequate amount of the antiscorbutic factor.\r\n\r\n[12] It is to be noted, however, that Variot remarks that these infants\r\nfrequently develop anemia unless additional diet is given, so that it\r\nmust be considered open to question whether some of these babies did not\r\nhave latent scurvy. Of course, unless it is certain that these infants\r\nwere receiving only sterilized milk, and absolutely no other food, for a\r\nperiod of at least six months, they cannot be considered apposite to the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[13] Carel reports an interesting case which points to the importance of\r\nstaleness. A baby was taken to the country with a supply of sterilized\r\nmilk sufficient to last for some weeks. At the end of this time it did\r\nnot thrive, but regained its health when a fresh supply of milk was\r\nused. When this second supply became stale the infant again developed\r\nthe same signs, and the condition was diagnosed as scurvy.\r\n\r\nNeumann, Czerny, and others state that they have even cured infantile\r\nscurvy by giving boiled milk obtained from a different source. In the\r\nBerlin epidemic, Neumann laid particular emphasis on the fact that the\r\nmilk which induced scurvy had been doubly heated, having been\r\npasteurized commercially and later boiled in the home before it was fed\r\nto the baby. Plantenga has also laid stress on the influence of\r\n_two-fold heating_, citing an interesting experience with scurvy in his\r\nclinic. When the milk was pasteurized one day and boiled for five\r\nminutes on the subsequent morning, 23 cases of infantile scurvy\r\ndeveloped among the 200 infants attending his dispensary. The following\r\nyear when the procedure was altered so that the milk was merely\r\npasteurized, no case of this disorder developed. There can be no doubt\r\nthat milk which has been heated twice must have lost more of its\r\nantiscorbutic properties than milk which has been heated but once, and\r\nthat aging also must contribute to this loss. Whether there is what may\r\nbe termed a peculiar sensitization of milk following pasteurization, has\r\nnot been definitely shown.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time _dried milk_ has played an insignificant rôle in\r\nthe etiology of infantile scurvy. One of the factors which has hindered\r\nthe general acceptance of dried milk by physicians and laymen has been\r\nthe fear that its use might lead to the development of Barlow's disease.\r\nIt is therefore important to consider this aspect of the subject,\r\nespecially as dried milk seems destined to be used to an increasing\r\nextent. A recent report to the Local Government Board by Coutts states\r\nthat \"Millard and Naisch in England confirmed the testimony of Miele in\r\nBelgium, and Gautier and Genevoix in France, that scurvy is not to be\r\nfeared\" from this foodstuff. This coincides with our experience, namely,\r\nthat _dried milk not only does not lead to scurvy, but may contain\r\nsufficient antiscorbutic vitamine to cure this disorder_. Recently a\r\nscorbutic baby was fed with milk which had been dried by the so-called\r\nJust-Hatmaker process--whereby it is subjected on a drum for a few\r\nseconds to about 230° F.--with the result that the hemorrhages of the\r\ngums began to be absorbed in about three days, and all symptoms to\r\ndisappear shortly thereafter. This infant received dried milk to the\r\nequivalent of 24 ounces of fresh milk, and this preparation had been\r\ndried and canned somewhat over three months before it was used. Recently\r\ntwo infants, suffering from marked scurvy, were treated with milk which\r\nhad been dried six months previously. The one received only sixteen\r\nounces a day and the other a quart; both recovered within a few days\r\nafter this food had been substituted for malt soup. Not long ago, as\r\nreported elsewhere in a paper by Unger and myself, after curing a baby\r\nof scurvy by means of this milk, it was maintained in health for a\r\nsubsequent period of three months on a diet which contained no\r\nadditional source of antiscorbutic vitamine. These results are\r\nemphasized as illustrating the peculiar relationship of drying and of\r\nthe application of heat to the antiscorbutic vitamine, and because\r\nrecently several reports have appeared, for example, that of Barnes and\r\nHume in England, and of Hart, Steenbock and Smith in this country, to\r\nthe effect that dried milk is devoid of antiscorbutic value. The\r\ndifference of opinion is due to the assumption that dried milk is a\r\nuniform product and has identical antiscorbutic properties. For milk to\r\nretain its antiscorbutic value, notwithstanding drying, it must have\r\nbeen rich in vitamine before desiccation, it must have been dried\r\nquickly, and packed within the shortest possible interval in air-tight,\r\npreferably hermetically sealed, containers. As in relation to the\r\nheating of milk, so in regard to its drying, it is not the degree of\r\nheat to which it is subjected which is all important, but rather the\r\nassociated conditions. The merits of each process will have to be tested\r\nindividually and perhaps even each particular brand of milk.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] In making tests of dried milk particular attention should be paid\r\nto the age of the milk before it is desiccated. Investigators should\r\nalso be certain that the milk has not undergone heating previous to the\r\ndrying process. Some well-known brands of dry milk have been not only\r\npasteurized, but subsequently evaporated before drying.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing, the dictum has been accepted without comment that\r\nfresh milk may be either rich or poor in antiscorbutic vitamine. This\r\npoint of view has recently gained general acceptance, on the assumption\r\nthat the milk of the stall-fed cow is markedly deficient in this factor.\r\nRecent work by Hart, Steenbock and Ellis gives evidence that \"summer\r\npasture milk is much richer in this nutritive factor than dry feed milk\r\nor winter produced milk, involving the use in the ration of corn silage\r\nor sugar mangels.\" In some experiments (unpublished) we have found that\r\ndried milk shows similar variations, being a much more potent\r\nantiscorbutic when obtained from cows fed on fresh fodder than a similar\r\nmilk from the same cows on fodder containing a minimum amount of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine. The supposition of a direct quantitative ratio\r\nbetween the antiscorbutic intake in the food and output in the milk\r\nneeds confirmation, especially as it does not quite coincide with the\r\nexperience among human beings in countries where adult scurvy is\r\nendemic. In such countries--for example, Russia--nursing infants do not\r\ndevelop scurvy to the extent that would be expected, and it is possible\r\nthat this exemption is due in part to a selective secretion of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine into the milk.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, a diet of _condensed milk_ leads to scurvy. This is\r\nnot surprising, considering the prolonged heating to which this milk has\r\nbeen subjected. It is probable that many cases of mild scurvy developing\r\non this food and characterized by beading of the ribs (rosary) and other\r\nindefinite manifestations, have been erroneously diagnosed as rickets.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss separately the various kinds of milk\r\nwhich have led to scurvy in the course of infant feeding.[15] The\r\nprinciples laid down in the preceding discussion hold good for milk of\r\nall kinds. Heat will destroy a certain amount of vitamine, and, if the\r\nheating is followed by aging, still more will be lost. If an interval\r\nelapses and a second heating ensues, there will be further loss of\r\nvitamine. It should never be forgotten in considering foods in their\r\nrelation to the causation of scurvy, that _the amount of food_ given\r\nmust not be overlooked. For example, a pint of ordinary pasteurized milk\r\nwill lead to scurvy, whereas a quart in most cases will be sufficient to\r\ntide the baby over until the period of mixed feeding. No general rule\r\ncan be laid down, however, as may be judged from the fact that dried\r\nmilk which has been subjected to almost all the influences which are\r\ndeleterious to the antiscorbutic vitamine--heating, drying, aging, all\r\ncarried out in a neutral medium--nevertheless retains its specific\r\npotency.\r\n\r\n[15] Ausset reports a definite case of scurvy developing in a baby nine\r\nmonths old, which had received buttermilk almost since birth. At the\r\ntime of admission to the hospital it was getting 900 c.c. a day. This\r\ncase is interesting on account of the acid nature of the food.\r\n\r\nInfantile scurvy has always been far more prevalent in England and in\r\nAmerica than in Europe, notwithstanding the fact that on the continent\r\npractically all milk for babies is boiled or sterilized. This has been\r\nascribed, and probably rightly so, to the widespread usage of\r\n_proprietary foods_ in the English-speaking countries. Among the cases\r\nreported by the American Pediatric Society about 60 per cent. had been\r\ngiven foods of this description. How is this relationship to be\r\nexplained? These preparations in general may be stated to consist of\r\ncereals, sugar, with occasionally a small amount of dried milk; they are\r\nmixed with varying proportions of water and milk and then cooked. It is\r\nevident that two important causative factors of scurvy are thus\r\nfurnished, namely, a small and inadequate quota of milk and the\r\napplication of heat. In most instances not more than sixteen to twenty\r\nounces of milk are used to make up the day's feeding, and frequently\r\nthis has been previously pasteurized. But there is an additional factor\r\nwhich comes into play in this connection, one to which we have recently\r\ndrawn attention in treating of \"The Deleterious Effect of the\r\nAlkalization of Infants' Food.\" It has been shown that the antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine is peculiarly sensitive to the faintest alkaline reaction, in\r\nwhich medium it rapidly undergoes deterioration, and even total\r\ndestruction if heat is applied. Proprietary foods, with but few\r\nexceptions, are alkaline, having been rendered so by the addition of\r\npotassium carbonate or bicarbonate, in order to prevent acid\r\nfermentation of the fat and to counterbalance the relative poverty of\r\npotassium in cow's milk. Little or no regard has been paid to this\r\nreaction; the textbooks on children's diseases give this point no\r\nconsideration whatsoever, expressing the salt content merely in terms of\r\ntotal ash. By this means ideal conditions are furnished for the\r\ndestruction of a large part of the vitamine, and if this factor is not\r\npresent in excess, scurvy will readily develop. It is to these various\r\ncircumstances--the deficiency of milk, the alkalinity and the\r\nheating--that the scorbutic quality of proprietary foods is to be\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nThe most flagrant example of an infant's food leading to scurvy is \"malt\r\nsoup\"--an alkaline preparation of malt, which is prepared with flour and\r\na small amount of milk.[16] This food brings about scurvy almost\r\ninvariably unless an antiscorbutic is added to the dietary. That this\r\neffect is due to the alkaline potassium carbonate was shown by a recent\r\ntest which is illustrated in chart. (Fig. 2). Here we see that in a case\r\nof scurvy, when the food was altered and prepared with the same amount\r\nof milk and alkali, the disorder did not abate (although the\r\ncarbohydrate had been discontinued), but when the potassium carbonate\r\nwas omitted a gain in weight ensued, and, we may add, the symptoms\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[16] Malt soup is prepared by dissolving the alkaline malt soup extract\r\nin water, and mixing wheat flour with milk. These two mixtures are then\r\nboiled together for about three minutes. According to some directions,\r\n11 ounces of milk are used; in our formula 16 ounces were employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Human scurvy: weight curve of a baby that\r\ndeveloped scurvy on a diet of malt soup (period 1). During period 2 the\r\nflour and malt soup were omitted from the diet, the same amount of milk\r\nand potassium carbonate being continued. The disorder did not abate. The\r\nonly change in period 3 was a discontinuation of the potassium\r\ncarbonate. This brought about a gain in weight and cure, showing the\r\ndestructive effect of the alkali on the vitamine.]\r\n\r\nA test of this kind once more raises the question whether carbohydrates\r\nlead to the development of scurvy. As previously stated, there are many\r\nwho believe that the carbohydrates, especially starch, have this harmful\r\neffect by requiring a large amount of the various vitamines for their\r\nmetabolism. This relationship was first brought forward by Bradden and\r\nCooper in regard to beriberi. It is a suggestion which cannot be\r\ndisregarded in view of the great amount of scurvy which comes about on\r\ndiets rich in carbohydrates, especially those containing malt sugar. We\r\ndo not believe, however, that the harmful effect which this foodstuff\r\nexerts can be explained on the above hypothesis, as experience has shown\r\nthat infants may receive for many months equally large amounts of\r\ncarbohydrates--cane sugar, flour, or a combination of both--and\r\nnevertheless not manifest a similar tendency to develop scurvy.\r\n\r\n=Age Incidence.=--Scurvy may occur at any age if the diet does not\r\nfurnish sufficient antiscorbutic factors. As a matter of fact, it is\r\nencountered most often among infants and adults, not because these two\r\nage-groups are particularly susceptible, but because there are peculiar\r\nattendant circumstances. In the case of the infant, it is due to the\r\nfact that for almost the entire first year of its life it is dependent\r\nentirely upon milk, a foodstuff poor in antiscorbutic vitamine, and\r\ncontaining, under favorable conditions, barely enough to meet its\r\nrequirement. If, therefore, the potency of the milk is weakened, or if\r\nan insufficient quantity is fed, and more particularly when both of\r\nthese factors are involved, a scorbutic condition will ensue. The reason\r\nwhy older children, those over one and a half or two years of age, do\r\nnot develop scurvy is largely due to their varied and liberal diet,\r\nwhich is amply provided by the mother or guardian, so that even in times\r\nof want they receive more than their due share of the available food\r\nsupply.[17]\r\n\r\n[17] It would seem, however, that the growing infant requires relatively\r\nmore antiscorbutic vitamine than does the adult. We know that its\r\ncaloric requirement is fully a quarter to a third greater. In regard to\r\nvitamine, judgment cannot be based on experimental evidence, but on\r\ncomparative figures. For example, unless we take this viewpoint, we must\r\nbelieve that, as an infant of six months weighing 15 pounds requires 15\r\nc.c. of orange juice daily to furnish its antiscorbutic quota, an adult\r\nweighing 160 pounds requires 180 c.c. daily--the juice of three\r\ngood-sized oranges. On this basis the adult would require six quarts\r\n(6000 c.c.) of fresh milk daily, twelve times the minimum requirement\r\nfor an infant, which is one pint (500 c.c.) a day. These figures are\r\nmanifestly too high.\r\n\r\nFrom a clinical standpoint scurvy may be said to occur in infants during\r\nthe second half year of their lives. There is general agreement on this\r\npoint; it is borne out by the investigation of the American Pediatric\r\nSociety and by the statistics of various individuals. On the basis of a\r\nlarge experience, Still states that nearly eighty per cent. of the cases\r\nappear between the ages of six and ten months, and that in no case did\r\nthe disorder occur before the age of five months. It is of importance\r\nfrom both the etiologic and the therapeutic standpoint to distinguish\r\nclearly between the age when infantile scurvy is commonly diagnosed, and\r\nthe earlier stage when it appears as a general nutritional disorder. We\r\nmust remember that scurvy generally takes from six to nine months to\r\nbecome manifest, this developmental period varying mainly in proportion\r\nto the degree of the dietary deficiency. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nthere must be a prolonged period of nutritional failure which precedes\r\nthe diagnosis. This stage consists of two early phases, the first months\r\nwhere the faulty diet causes no apparent change and seems to have no\r\ndeleterious effect on the infant, and the second, of latent and subacute\r\nscurvy. The \"latent\" condition is one merely of unsatisfactory nutrition\r\nand retarded growth, which it is not possible to interpret; \"subacute\r\nscurvy,\" which develops subsequently, is distinguished by characteristic\r\nsigns and symptoms. We shall not review their symptomatology, as it is\r\ngiven in the chapter devoted to this topic. The subject is brought\r\nforward in this connection to emphasize the fact that the scorbutic\r\ncondition occurs far earlier than is generally realized, and\r\nfurthermore, that if the earlier and more subtle symptoms of scurvy were\r\ncomprehended, the age incidence would fall earlier than the current\r\nfigures indicate. The earliest instance of this disorder which we have\r\nseen occurred in a baby four and a half months of age.\r\n\r\nAge does not seem to play a definite rôle in regard to the incidence\r\namong adults. Scurvy frequently has been encountered among old men, and\r\nis of common occurrence among the most vigorous of the nation, the young\r\nsoldiers and sailors. Some have stated that it takes place less often\r\namong soldiers in the twenties than among those in the thirties, but\r\nthis has not been demonstrated. The fewest cases have been reported\r\namong children over two years of age. It was due to the apparent\r\nimmunity of this age-group that, until very recently, German writers\r\ndoubted the identity of infantile and adult scurvy. The exclusion of\r\nchildren of this age is merely fortuitous and, moreover, is by no means\r\nabsolute. One of the earliest cases of scurvy in children, reported by\r\nMontfalcon, occurred in a child six years old. Bateman in America\r\ndescribed a case in a child of about this age. Barlow, in one of his\r\nfirst articles, reported scurvy in a small group of older children. The\r\ncase so frequently quoted by German authors in this connection is that\r\nof Fraenkel, who described both clinically and pathologically a case of\r\nscurvy in a boy eight years of age. These cases by no means exhaust the\r\nnumber which are reported. Recently, Tobler has given us an account of\r\nscurvy, occurring during the war, in a Viennese foundling asylum which\r\nharbored children between the ages of two and fourteen.\r\n\r\n=Season and Climate.=--Many of the older writers laid great stress on\r\nthe influence of season on the occurrence of scurvy, which they believed\r\nbroke out particularly in the cold and damp months of the fall, winter\r\nand early spring. It is true that most of the epidemics have occurred at\r\nthese seasons of the year. This is merely what should be expected,\r\nconsidering that the disease depends mainly upon the supply of fresh\r\nfruits and vegetables. Where conditions are abnormal, as in war, there\r\nhave been notable exceptions to this seasonal incidence. In the \"Report\r\nof the War of the Rebellion\" there is an instructive graph illustrating\r\nthe occurrence of scurvy in our Civil War and in the Crimean War, which\r\nshows that this disease prevailed to the greatest extent during the\r\nwinter months in the former, whereas in Crimea, the season of greatest\r\nfrequency was the summer time. One of the severest outbreaks of scurvy\r\non record is that which occurred at the siege of Thorn in Germany in the\r\nyear 1703. During the months of July and August, when the weather was\r\nexcessively hot, scurvy ravaged the besieged army. There are,\r\nfurthermore, many reports of scurvy in the tropics during the dry\r\nseason. In the island of Aruba, in the Dutch West Indies, which has been\r\nvisited by scurvy year after year, and which is referred to elsewhere,\r\nthe disease is endemic during the dry, hot season. Formerly it broke out\r\non the men-of-war and vessels of the mercantile marine while they were\r\nin southern waters. As regards infantile scurvy, it has always seemed to\r\nus that season played a slight rôle; that cases which occurred in the\r\nsummer tended to be less severe and to be characterized by periods of\r\nintermission rarely observed in the winter time.\r\n\r\nThe effect of _climate_ has been accorded a variable place in the\r\netiology of scurvy. Lind believed that a damp, cold climate, such as\r\nthat of the Low Countries, was conducive to scurvy. On the other hand,\r\nsince it is realized that diet is the essential element, all other\r\nfactors have been regarded as of no moment whatsoever. It is difficult\r\nto pass judgment on this question, since scurvy is now endemic in such a\r\nlimited area of the world. It seems quite possible that a damp, cold\r\nclimate, which depresses the various functions of the body, may exert an\r\ninfluence where the quota of antiscorbutic foodstuff is not quite\r\nadequate. Exposure to infection is also greater under such climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nEconomic status has to be considered in connection with infantile\r\nscurvy. Numerous writers have drawn attention to the fact that scurvy is\r\nseen relatively more frequently among the infants of the well-to-do and\r\nthe rich than among those of the poor. This curious and paradoxical\r\nsituation is due to the zealous care which the former receive--the\r\nextreme precautions in sterilizing the milk, the addition to the\r\nformulas of expensive proprietary foods, the watchfulness to avoid the\r\nchild's obtaining a chance bit of fruit or vegetable. Since the\r\npopularization of commercially-pasteurized milk in the larger\r\nmunicipalities, and the advertising propaganda for the sale of \"baby\r\nfoods\" which has extended their use among the masses, this distinction\r\nin the social status has been largely obliterated.\r\n\r\nSex seems to play no part in the etiology of scurvy. Several writers\r\nhave claimed, however, that there is a certain degree of racial\r\nimmunity. For example, Sheppard reports that the Zhob Kakai seldom\r\ndevelops scurvy, although he naturally excludes vegetables from his\r\ndiet, and Boerich noted among the prisoners of war that the Slavs,\r\nespecially the White Russians, were more susceptible.[18] Of course a\r\nlack of susceptibility of this nature can be merely relative. Such a\r\nracial distinction may seem far-fetched, but if we admit that\r\ndisposition and habits of life can play a rôle, it is quite possible for\r\nraces to vary in their predisposition to this disorder. Moreover, we\r\nshall see that individuals differ markedly in this respect. Lind and\r\nothers repeatedly emphasize the fact that the indolent and slothful\r\nsailor was stricken with scurvy far oftener than the one who was active,\r\nand claimed that physical exercise even tended to bring about a\r\ncure.[19] Those who have had a large experience with scurvy in adults\r\nare almost unanimous in believing that a _psychic element_ enters into\r\nits etiology. In this way, in a measure, they account for the frequency\r\nof scurvy among defeated troops, in besieged armies, and among men\r\ndepressed by homesickness, fatigue, and discouragement. This point of\r\nview cannot be lightly disregarded, bearing in mind that depressed\r\nmental states alter the functions of the organs and markedly affect\r\nsecretion. The many cases and epidemics in institutions for the insane\r\ncannot, however, be attributed to this cause, but are probably almost\r\nentirely due to a want of supervision of the dietary. Among infants, the\r\nquestion of the influence of race and of the mental state needs but\r\nlittle consideration.[20] For some time we have carefully observed the\r\ncourse of scurvy among happy and contented infants compared with those\r\nof an unhappy and fretful disposition; in some instances the former,\r\nalthough the diet was similar, seemed to develop scurvy less readily\r\nthan the latter.\r\n\r\n[18] It would be of interest to know whether the negro infant is more\r\nsusceptible than the white baby, in view of its markedly heightened\r\nsusceptibility to rickets. There are, however, no reports or statistics\r\nto enlighten us on this point.\r\n\r\n[19] \"Where the indisposition is but beginning, and even when the gums\r\nhave been pretty much tainted, there have been numerous instances of a\r\nperfect _recovery without having the benefit of fresh vegetables_;\r\nprovided the patient is able to use due exercise.... When it is advanced\r\nto what I have called the second stage it is hardly to be cured without\r\ntheir (fruits and vegetables) assistance.\" (Lind.)\r\n\r\n[20] Caillé has described a case of scurvy in an infant suffering from\r\nMongolian idiocy, and we have also seen a similar case.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that there is _predisposition_ to scurvy, as there\r\nis, probably, to every nutritional disorder. Among soldiers and sailors\r\na certain number develop scurvy on the same ration which does not harm\r\nothers. Some years ago when scurvy developed among a group of infants\r\nfed on pasteurized milk, this idiosyncrasy was noted. The distinction,\r\nhowever, is rarely sharply defined. Careful clinical investigation will\r\ngenerally show that the infants which seem to be spared are not\r\nthriving quite normally; they are somewhat pale, and do not gain in\r\nweight as they should, and their appetite is poor. The most interesting\r\nexperience of this kind is the following which is frequently cited: In a\r\nfamily where the first child developed scurvy, Finkelstein took the\r\nprecaution, in the case of the second child, to have the milk boiled for\r\nas short a time as possible, and to begin mixed feeding early. In spite\r\nof these precautions this boy also developed scurvy. Finkelstein states\r\nthat once before he had met with a similar mishap. An experience which\r\nhe relates, regarding a foster-mother, an excellent nurse, who had three\r\ninfants in succession develop scurvy in spite of preventive measures, is\r\nalso of interest in this connection. The latter occurrence evidently\r\ncannot be attributed to hereditary or family predisposition, and serves\r\nto emphasize the inherent difficulties of the subject. v. Starck's\r\nreport of an instance where twins were fed on similar milk mixtures and\r\none developed scurvy, whereas the other thrived satisfactorily, is a\r\nstriking illustration of the rôle of idiosyncrasy. This case, as well as\r\nmany others, fails to be absolutely convincing in view of the fact that\r\nthe daily intake of milk is not recorded.\r\n\r\nA predisposition to scurvy cannot be ascribed to a condition of general\r\nmalnutrition. For example, among infants it has never seemed that those\r\nsuffering from marasmus or atrophy were particularly prone to develop\r\nscurvy. Whether syphilis, tuberculosis or malaria tends to precipitate\r\nthe onset of this disorder cannot be stated.[21] In view of the fact\r\nthat prematurity is such an important factor in the pathogenesis of\r\nrickets, it would be of interest to know whether a similar relationship\r\nexists between infantile scurvy and prematurity. The only clinical\r\ncondition which we have found predisposing to scurvy is the \"exudative\r\ndiathesis\" of Czerny, a term which implies a tendency to develop\r\nexudations of the skin or of the mucous membranes. Probably it is not\r\nwithout significance that in this diathesis the blood-vessels may evince\r\na decided weakness, an increased permeability, as demonstrated by the\r\n\"capillary resistance test.\" (See Symptomatology.)\r\n\r\n[21] Many of the older authors believed that mercurial drugs were\r\nespecially prejudicial in cases of scurvy.\r\n\r\nNothing whatsoever is known regarding the possible influence of the fat,\r\nprotein, carbohydrate and salt content of the diet on the development of\r\nscurvy. Is it entirely immaterial whether one or another food element\r\nlargely predominates, or is the antiscorbutic factor to some extent\r\nmodified by other components of the food? Influences of this kind, which\r\nat most are secondary, cannot be ascertained by the biologic test which\r\nat present has to be relied on to measure the development of scurvy and\r\nthe potency of antiscorbutics. It is quite possible that the course of\r\nscurvy may be affected by the character of gastric and intestinal\r\ndigestion, by the activity of the glands which pour their secretions\r\ninto these organs, by the destruction or elimination of the\r\nantiscorbutic factor in the food. The frequent association of dysentery\r\nand scurvy noted during the recent war and referred to by many previous\r\nwriters, shows the effect of intestinal disorders. These hypotheses are\r\ntentatively advanced because it is evident that some factor exists,\r\napart from the mere antiscorbutic value of the diet, which at times\r\nexerts a potent influence on the development of scurvy. Cases developing\r\nin spite of a moderate amount of antiscorbutic food, and others not\r\nresponding to the addition of vegetables or fruit to the diet--although\r\nnot numerous--have occurred too frequently and have been reported by too\r\nexperienced observers to be brusquely disregarded. For example, Neumann,\r\none of the keenest clinical students of scurvy, stated that he had met\r\nwith four instances of this nature. Hess and Fish reported two similar\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThe secondary etiologic factors are mainly predisposing; a few words,\r\nhowever, must be added concerning what may be termed _exciting factors_.\r\nInfection is the most important condition which may suddenly and\r\nprecipitously induce scurvy. This fact was brought to our attention in\r\n1912 in connection with the outbreak of scurvy among infants receiving\r\npasteurized milk. Its explanation was not clear at the time, but was\r\nelucidated by subsequent experience, and was described in 1917 as\r\nfollows: \"Latent scurvy was prematurely changed to florid scurvy by the\r\npresence of a ward infection; an epidemic of 'grippe' precipitated an\r\nepidemic of scurvy exceptional in its hemorrhagic tendency.\" The\r\nassociation of scurvy and infection has been recently emphasized by\r\nMcCarrison and others, and seems to hold good for the other so-called\r\ndeficiency diseases. In this connection one other exciting cause of\r\nscurvy may be mentioned, namely, trauma. The older writers noticed that\r\nfollowing a fall or an accident, a sailor frequently developed scurvy,\r\nand Barlow in 1894 remarked on the influence of trauma in connection\r\nwith infantile scurvy. As might be inferred, its effect is mainly to\r\ninduce premature rupture of the weakened blood-vessels; in infants we\r\nhave seen this occasioned by pressure exerted on the lower end of the\r\nthigh to ascertain the presence of tenderness. Viewing the situation\r\nbroadly, it must be acknowledged that except for the realization that\r\nscurvy is due to a new food factor--a vitamine--our fundamental\r\nunderstanding of its pathogenesis has advanced but little, in spite of\r\nthe employment of experimental methods and the availability of modern\r\ntechnic.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether mere clinical studies will contribute in a large\r\nmeasure to the solution of the pathogenesis of scurvy. Much may,\r\nhowever, be learned by investigations of the metabolism in human\r\nscurvy--an aspect of the problem which, as will be brought out in a\r\nsubsequent chapter, hardly has been explored. By this means may be\r\nacquired a clearer understanding of the effect of an antiscorbutic\r\ndeficiency on the tissues and on cellular activity. Much may be expected\r\nfrom physiologic and pharmacologic studies of the specific vitamine,\r\nalthough it is not yet available in a pure state. Finally, it is\r\nprobable that the solution of similar questions relating to the\r\npathogenesis of cognate disorders--a study which is engaging the best\r\nefforts of so many workers throughout the world--will shed light on this\r\nparticular disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ANTISCORBUTIC VITAMINE[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] Vitamine is used throughout this monograph as synonymous with\r\n\"accessory food factor\" or \"food hormone\" as a convenient descriptive\r\nterm, without any intention of connoting a definite chemical substance.\r\n\r\nWe shall not discuss the subject of vitamines in general, but confine\r\nourselves to the more limited field of the antiscorbutic vitamine. The\r\nrecognition of the \"accessory\" dietary factors is of such recent date,\r\nhowever, that it will be well to consider briefly how attention came to\r\nbe directed to them and how their existence was ascertained. As in the\r\ncase of so many scientific discoveries, it is difficult to point to the\r\nexact time when the advance was made. On looking back we find that\r\nLunin, in 1881, noting that mice were unable to live on a diet\r\nconsisting of protein, fats, carbohydrates, salts and water, came to the\r\nconclusion \"that other substances indispensable to nutrition must be\r\npresent in milk besides caseinogen, fat, lactose and salts.\" This work\r\ndid not stimulate similar investigations, nor did Lunin, as might have\r\nbeen expected, allude to scurvy. The work which focussed attention on\r\nthis novel aspect of dietetics was the report of Eijkman, in 1897, to\r\nthe effect that when fowl are fed decorticated rice, they develop a\r\ndisease resembling beriberi, and that the paralytic symptoms disappear\r\non feeding them rice polishings or its alcoholic extract. Here, for the\r\nfirst time, was a positive rather than a negative experiment, and one\r\ncapable of simple verification. The subject was placed on a scientific\r\nbasis by the classic investigation of Hopkins, who experimented with\r\npurified food substances, and demonstrated how diets which were\r\ndeficient could be rendered adequate. As early as 1906 he wrote \"the\r\nanimal body is adjusted to live either upon plant tissues or other\r\nanimals, and these contain countless substances other than the proteins,\r\ncarbohydrates and fats.\" \"In diseases such as rickets, and particularly\r\nin scurvy, we have had for long years knowledge of a dietetic factor,\r\nbut though we know how to benefit these conditions empirically, the\r\nreal errors in the diet are to this day quite obscure.\" The work of\r\nOsborne and Mendel, and McCollum and Davis in this country, of\r\nSchaumann, Funk, Stepp and others, all led to the conclusion that\r\npurified diets are unable to satisfy the nutritive requirements of rats\r\nor mice, and that extracts of the natural foods suffice to render the\r\ndiet adequate.\r\n\r\nThe same rule holds for man, who, when deprived of these vitamines,\r\ndevelops the so-called deficiency diseases--typically modern disorders.\r\nRegarded as a group, they are a consequence of our altered mode of life\r\nand peculiar civilization. They follow naturally upon the development of\r\nimmense cities housing millions of people, who necessarily must receive\r\nperishable foodstuffs produced at a great distance. To even a greater\r\nextent they are the product of countless ingenious methods devised\r\nmainly to render foods stable--drying, heating, the addition of\r\npreservatives--most of which accomplish their object, but incidentally\r\nrob the food of its essential vitamine.\r\n\r\nNone of the vitamines has been isolated in a pure state. The nearest\r\napproach to this desired end has been the work of Funk, who obtained the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine in a state of such concentration that about 3 mg.\r\nsufficed to cure a pigeon of polyneuritis. In considering the attributes\r\nof the antiscorbutic vitamine, it must be borne in mind that this factor\r\nis referred to as it exists in various foods; for example, in orange\r\njuice or in cabbage, and furthermore, that the method of ascertaining\r\nits presence or concentration is limited to the crude biological test of\r\nanimal feeding.\r\n\r\nThe antiscorbutic factor is distinguished by being the most sensitive of\r\nthe three vitamines, the most unstable, the least resistant to physical\r\nor chemical processes. It may be regarded as one of the most delicate\r\nindicators of the biological integrity of foodstuffs; however, as Falk\r\nand his co-workers have shown, the enzyme property of living matter is\r\nstill more readily destroyed. The antiscorbutic vitamine is soluble in\r\nwater, and therefore is termed by some the \"water-soluble C\" factor. It\r\nis also soluble in alcohol, as shown by the experiments of Hess and\r\nUnger and of Harden and Zilva, and the therapeutic tests on infants of\r\nFreise and of Freudenberg.[23] It possesses, therefore, the solubility\r\nof the water-soluble vitamine. Some have suggested that it may be\r\nderived from this vitamine, others that instead of one there may be a\r\nseries of antiscorbutic factors--suggestions based on pure hypothesis.\r\nHolst and Froelich showed that this vitamine passes, without appreciable\r\nloss, through dialyzing parchment, and Harden and Zilva (2) that it can\r\npass through a porcelain filter. The latter, using the method of\r\nSeidell, demonstrated that this vitamine is not adsorbed by fine\r\nprecipitates such as fuller's earth, differing in this respect from the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine; and that in a mixture of equal volumes of\r\nautolyzed yeast and orange juice, the antiscorbutic vitamine remained\r\nunaffected, whereas the water-soluble A was entirely removed.\r\n\r\n[23] Freise cured a case of infantile scurvy by giving about 2 c.c. of\r\nan extract obtained from turnips by means of absolute alcohol. Seven\r\nweeks were necessary to cause a disappearance of symptoms. Freudenberg\r\nemployed an extract of carrots, prepared with 96 per cent. alcohol, and\r\neffected a quicker cure.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of the antiscorbutic factor\r\nis its _sensitiveness to even moderately high degrees of heat_. In this\r\nrespect it differs markedly from the water-soluble or so-called\r\n\"antineuritic vitamine\" which withstands exposure to high temperature.\r\nThe reaction of the antiscorbutic vitamine in this regard is not a\r\nsimple one, and cannot be expressed by a mere statement of the degree of\r\nheat and the length of exposure. Numerous other factors, especially the\r\nreaction of the medium, but also the physical environment, must be taken\r\ninto consideration--for example, cabbage is more resistant to the action\r\nof heat than its juice. An understanding of the relation of\r\nantiscorbutics to heat may perhaps best be obtained by considering the\r\nsubject in connection with some definite foodstuffs. The most exhaustive\r\nstudy from a quantitative standpoint is that of Delf. She showed that\r\nwhen cabbage is subjected for an hour to a temperature of 80° to 100°\r\nC., 90 per cent. of its antiscorbutic vitamine is lost, and that 80 per\r\ncent. is lost when a temperature of 90° to 100° is maintained for twenty\r\nminutes, or a temperature of 60° for a period of sixty minutes. This\r\nexperiment shows that the destructive influence of heat is enhanced to a\r\ncomparatively slight degree by a rise of temperature, only about\r\nthreefold when it is raised from 60° C. to the boiling point. This\r\nresult points to a temperature coefficient of about 1.5 to 10° C. of\r\ntemperature. It is suggested by Delf that this low coefficient of\r\ndestruction is opposed to the enzyme or protein-like theory of the\r\nnature of the vitamine, and suggests a simpler constitution. On the\r\nother hand, we must bear in mind that the proteins which have been used\r\nin experiments and found to possess a high coefficient of heat, have\r\nbeen tested in the pure state, whereas the vitamine of the cabbage is\r\nbound up in the cell.\r\n\r\nExperiments with this vitamine as found in milk accord with the above\r\ninvestigation, demonstrating that intensity of heat is not as\r\ndestructive as prolonged heating. This agrees with the clinical\r\nexperience that milk which has been boiled for a few minutes does not\r\ninduce scurvy as readily as pasteurized milk which has been heated for\r\n45 minutes to 140° or 165° F. (Hess and Fish).\r\n\r\nAs demonstrated by tests with orange and with lemon juice, the\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine is greatly protected from the destructive effect\r\nof heat when it is associated with an acid. This was shown first by\r\nHolst and Froelich and has been confirmed by numerous observers. An\r\nexcellent example of marked thermostability conferred on a food by its\r\nacid reaction is furnished by the tomato, which is strongly\r\nantiscorbutic even after it has been subjected to the canning process.\r\nConversely, Harden and Zilva have shown that the vitamine is destroyed\r\nby alkali even when dilute (one-fiftieth normal sodium hydrate) and kept\r\nin contact at room temperature; this alteration does not take place at\r\nonce, but in the course of several hours.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the antiscorbutic factor is peculiarly sensitive to\r\n_drying_, but there are exceptions to this rule, so that it is incorrect\r\nto state, as does the British Report of the Medical Research Committee,\r\nthat \"it may be regarded as an axiom that dry or dried foodstuffs will\r\nnot prevent scurvy.\" We have shown that fresh milk dried by the\r\nJust-Hatmaker process may retain by far the greater moiety of its\r\nvirtue. In this regard rapidity of desiccation and subsequent protection\r\nfrom oxidative processes are important factors. The general rule holds\r\ntrue, however, that this vitamine, in contradistinction to the\r\n\"water-soluble\" vitamine, is readily damaged and destroyed by drying.\r\n\r\nThis vitamine is peculiarly sensitive to _aging_, especially when it is\r\npresent in an alkaline or neutral medium; but even in an acid medium its\r\npotency soon diminishes. Harden and Zilva found this to be the case with\r\nlemon juice stored for a fortnight in the cold room, and our experience\r\nhas been similar in regard to orange juice kept in the refrigerator\r\nunder a layer of liquid petrolatum. In milk the antiscorbutic factor\r\ndiminishes with age, especially following pasteurization, in the course\r\nof which most of the acid-forming bacteria have been destroyed. Aging\r\nhas the least effect when the food with which the vitamine is associated\r\nhas been dried. This is true not only of lemon and of orange juice as\r\ndemonstrated experimentally and clinically, but even of milk, which even\r\nafter it has been dried and stored for months, may still possess marked\r\ncurative value.[24]\r\n\r\n[24] Reference is made to a milk dried by the Just-Hatmaker process,\r\ncontaining about 3 per cent. of moisture. The clinical data on which\r\nthis conclusion is based are given in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nExperiments by Harden and Zilva showed that exposure of lemon juice to\r\n_ultra-violet rays_ for eight hours does not influence its antiscorbutic\r\nactivity, that exposure of autolyzed yeast for the same length of time\r\nlikewise does not impair its \"antineuritic\" potency, but that under\r\nidentical conditions the fat-soluble factor in butter becomes\r\ninactivated. Similar tests carried out by the author with orange juice\r\nled to the same result. It thus appears that one of the vitamines--not\r\nthe most unstable--manifests a peculiar sensitiveness to a certain form\r\nof physical or chemical action.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that _shaking_ partly destroys pepsin and rennin, as\r\nshown by Shaklee and Meltzer, it would be of interest to ascertain\r\nwhether this process brings about any impairment of the antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine. Particular interest is attached to this question because it is\r\ngenerally recognized that milk loses some of its potency in the course\r\nof handling--whatever may be comprised by this term. In experiments on\r\nthe fat-soluble vitamine Steenbock and his co-workers found that\r\n\"somewhere in the course of the manipulation to which the butter fat had\r\nbeen subjected, factors had been introduced which were responsible for a\r\nvitamine destruction.\"\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the question of the manner in which the antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine functionates, it may be well to state briefly the type of the\r\ndisturbance which its deficiency occasions. The chief manifestation is\r\ndamage to the integrity of the endothelium of the vessels, resulting in\r\nhemorrhage--whether from diapedesis or from rhexis or both of these\r\nconditions, the microscope does not inform us. Nor can it be stated\r\npositively that the endothelium has not been injured by a secondary\r\ntoxic or bacterial factor. However this may be, the end result of the\r\ndeficiency is endothelial damage, a pathologic condition which may be\r\ndemonstrated clinically in scurvy by the \"capillary resistance test\"\r\n(chapter VII). The other marked functional alteration in scurvy is\r\nincreased susceptibility to infection; but how a vitamine deficiency\r\ninduces this vulnerability cannot be explained. Clinical tests show that\r\nthe blood contains sufficient antitoxin (diphtheria) to afford\r\nprotection. Harden and Zilva found that \"guinea-pigs fed on an\r\nunrestricted mixed diet, on a quantitatively restricted mixed diet, and\r\na scorbutic diet showed no differentiation in amboceptor and agglutinin\r\ntitres, and in the complement activity of the blood.\" If this is to be\r\ninterpreted as indicating that the protective substances of the body\r\nundergo but little alteration, we must consider whether susceptibility\r\nto infection, as well as tendency to hemorrhage, is not due largely to\r\nalteration in the cement substance of the endothelial and epithelial\r\nmembranes.\r\n\r\n=The Mode of Action of the Vitamine.=--One of the most interesting as\r\nwell as puzzling questions in regard to the antiscorbutic vitamine\r\nconcerns the manner in which it prevents or cures scurvy. It is a\r\nsubject which at present is in a state of flux, hardly having emerged\r\nfrom the realm of hypothesis, so that detailed consideration will profit\r\nlittle. At first the _modus operandi_ was explained and accepted as\r\nenzyme action, but it was soon evident, in view of the thermostability\r\nof the vitamine, that it could not be classed as a ferment or enzyme in\r\nthe generally-accepted sense of this term. In general, it may be stated\r\nthat there are two main views: one that the vitamine acts directly, and\r\nthe other that it acts indirectly through the function of the endocrine\r\nglands. _Direct action_, furthermore, may be accomplished in at least\r\none of three ways. The vitamine may (1) serve as a source of nutriment\r\nfor the tissues, (2) exert an antitoxic effect on toxic products, or (3)\r\nfunction as a catalyzer. The first interpretation is evidently the\r\nsimplest and conforms to the long-established knowledge of caloric food\r\nfactors. That such small amounts as 2 c.c. of orange juice daily should\r\nsuffice to protect an animal from nutritional disaster runs counter,\r\nhowever, to former conceptions of food nutrition. Further than this\r\nthere is little against this viewpoint. In its favor is the fact that,\r\nup to a certain point, antiscorbutics act in direct ratio to the amount\r\ngiven; for example, 2 c.c. of canned tomato juice is insufficient to\r\nprevent scurvy in guinea-pigs, 3 c.c. will protect some but not all of\r\na series, whereas when the amount is increased to 4 c.c. daily all\r\nanimals will be saved. As we are considering new food factors it is\r\nmanifestly unwise to judge them by old standards, and to decide offhand\r\nthat they cannot possess such a high degree of nutritive power. This\r\nquestion must be regarded as still open.\r\n\r\nThe antitoxic theory suffers from the fact that the toxic origin of\r\nscurvy cannot be established. Before this is possible, it is clear that\r\nit will be difficult to bring forward convincing evidence of a\r\nneutralizing substance. Against this theory is the fact that elimination\r\ntherapy is of no avail in the treatment of infantile scurvy. Hess and\r\nUnger (1919) failed to alleviate the symptoms by means of catharsis,\r\ndiuresis, sweating and repeated intravenous injections of normal salt\r\nsolution. In its favor it may be advanced, in a general way, that the\r\nvitamine, in many characteristics, resembles an antitoxin--in its\r\nextreme lability, its destruction by heat, aging and alkalies. On the\r\nother hand, antitoxins also are readily destroyed by acid which, as has\r\nbeen shown, exerts a protective influence on the antiscorbutic factor.\r\nThe rapidity of action of the vitamines, one of the most impressive\r\nphenomena, calls to mind the neutralizing action of an antitoxin, and\r\nprobably has given rise to the analogy. Williams suggests that the\r\nvitamines have \"a general, non-specific, antitoxic or eliminative\r\naction\" on toxic substances resulting from the metabolic decomposition\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nThe theory has been advanced that the action of the vitamines is\r\ncatalytic. Although this viewpoint has been taken regarding the\r\nwater-soluble rather than the antiscorbutic vitamine, it will be well to\r\nreview briefly the work on which it is based. Among the first to suggest\r\nthis hypothesis were Vedder and Clark, who noted a relationship between\r\nthe amount of vitamine required by fowls and their carbohydrate intake.\r\nFunk in 1913 made a similar observation in regard to beriberi, and in\r\nthe following year, with von Schoenborn, showed that a vitamine-free\r\ndiet led to hyperglycæmia, with diminished amount of hepatic glycogen,\r\nand that the addition of water-soluble vitamine diminished the\r\nhyperglycæmia and increased the liver glycogen. The work of Burge and\r\nhis co-workers on the catalase content of tissue led to a similar\r\nconclusion. Their results may be summarized by the statement that the\r\noxidative processes are hampered and fail to balance the autolytic\r\nchanges, and, furthermore, that a relationship exists between the\r\ncatalase activity, acidosis and normal oxidative processes. This theory\r\nwould presuppose that scurvy is due to the formation of toxins which are\r\nnormally in process of continual destruction in the body. According to\r\nsome, these catalyzed toxic substances are metabolic in character,\r\noriginating from incompletely oxidized food; according to another\r\ninterpretation, they are the product of autolyzed tissue cells (tissue\r\ntoxins). The difficulty with this explanation is that scurvy cannot be\r\nprevented or cured by a diet containing food of high catalytic power.\r\nFor example, wheat embryos which, according to recent investigations of\r\nCrocker and Harrington, have a high catalytic activity, were found of no\r\ntherapeutic value in relation to infantile scurvy (Hess, 3).\r\n\r\nThis problem has been approached from quite a different angle. As is\r\nwell known, certain bacteria require serum, blood, milk, etc., in order\r\nto grow satisfactorily on artificial culture media. It has been\r\nestablished recently, primarily by the work of Lloyd, that this\r\npeculiarity in the cultivation of microörganisms is due largely to\r\ntheir requirement of vitamine. She found a relationship of the inverse\r\norder between the amount of amino acid present in the culture medium and\r\nthe amount of vitamine required to stimulate the growth of strains of\r\nmeningococcus. Reasoning from this experience, she suggests that the\r\naction of the accessory growth factors is to increase the reaction\r\nvelocity of the proteolytic metabolism. Here we find the vitamines once\r\nmore regarded as catalyzers. This author, however, associates their\r\nactivity with proteolytic rather than with carbohydrate metabolism.\r\nInteresting and suggestive work of similar nature has been carried out\r\nin relation to the growth of protozoa and of yeasts (Eddy).\r\nInvestigations of this kind, dealing with unicellular organisms\r\npropagated on a simple food, have the advantage of greatly simplifying\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nThe recent work of Dutcher falls under this caption, differing merely in\r\nthe fact that he attributes to the vitamines an _indirect action_. He\r\nhas demonstrated that the tissues of polyneuritic birds show a decrease\r\nin catalase activity to a point 56 per cent. below normal, and that this\r\nactivity is largely restored when the birds are cured with vitamine.\r\nAccording to this writer the vitamine functions as a metabolic\r\nstimulant, and its lack results in a depression of the body oxidations\r\nwith an accompanying formation of toxic metabolic products, injurious to\r\nthe nervous system. The action is regarded as coming about in an\r\nindirect manner, being accomplished through the hormone action of the\r\nvitamines on one or more glands of internal secretion.\r\n\r\nThe _endocrine hypothesis_, suggested by Funk in his monograph, is not\r\nwithout some corroborative evidence. In testing the pharmacologic action\r\nof the water-soluble vitamine, Uhlmann found that it stimulated the\r\nvarious glands of the digestive tract, in this respect acting like\r\npilocarpine. Some years ago Albert expressed the opinion that the action\r\nof this vitamine was \"vagotropic\" like atropine, and recently Dutcher\r\nhas reported definite relief and cessation of polyneuritic symptoms by\r\nmeans of pilocarpine (0.5 mg. subcutaneously). He claims equally good\r\nresults from thyroxin, the hormone of the thyroid gland, from desiccated\r\nthyroid and from tethelin (pituitary). Voegtlin and Myers conclude, as\r\nthe result of experiments with brewers' yeast, that the chemical and\r\nphysical properties of secretin and vitamine are identical.\r\n\r\nThe early work of Funk and Douglas, which showed that various _glands of\r\ninternal secretion_ diminish in size and undergo degenerative changes\r\nwhen the diet is vitamine-free, the newer work of McCarrison and of\r\nDutcher to the same effect, clearly point to an intimate relationship\r\nbetween some of the endocrine glands and the vitamines. As regards\r\nscurvy, the only work is that of Rondoni, McCarrison and of LaMer and\r\nCampbell on the adrenal glands, which were found by all to be enlarged\r\nin guinea-pigs suffering from this disorder. These investigations must\r\nbe regarded as tentative rather than conclusive until confirmed by\r\nsimilar necropsy reports in man. In this connection it should be noted\r\nthat thyroid, parathyroid or suprarenal extract is of no avail in the\r\ntreatment of scurvy. This failure may, however, be explained by the fact\r\nthat the normal balance of glandular activity was not established. We\r\nmust bear in mind, however, that although the vitamines may influence\r\nthe secretion of the glands of internal secretion, this explanation does\r\nnot satisfactorily account for the symptoms of the \"deficiency\r\ndiseases.\" These disorders do not in the slightest respect resemble the\r\nclinical pictures which we are accustomed to associate with a lack of\r\nactivity of the glands of internal secretion. If the polyneuritis of\r\nberiberi and the hemorrhages of scurvy are attributable to a diminished\r\nsecretion of the endocrine glands, then it will be necessary to revise\r\npresent conceptions of their physiologic functions.\r\n\r\n=The Fate of the Vitamine in the Body.=--One of the most important\r\nquestions in relation to the antiscorbutic vitamine, quite apart from\r\nits chemical nature, physiologic function, and its source, is its fate\r\nin the human body after it has reached the alimentary canal or been\r\ncarried to the tissues. It can be readily appreciated that our knowledge\r\nof this aspect is very meagre. We shall endeavor, however, to detail\r\nwhat little is known of this subject, conscious of the fact that\r\ninvestigations of the next few years may contradict our present\r\nviewpoints.\r\n\r\nMost of the constituents necessary for the construction of tissue or for\r\ncarrying on its functions can be synthesized by the animal body from the\r\nbasal foodstuffs. It has been ascertained within the past decade that\r\ncertain constituents--for example, some amino-acids of the protein\r\nmolecule--are building-stones which cannot be primarily elaborated by\r\nthe cells, but must be supplied by the food. At present the\r\nvitamines--including the antiscorbutic vitamine--are included in this\r\nnew and essential group of substances which the human organism cannot\r\nmanufacture. Animal experiments seem to bear out this conception of the\r\nvitamine whether we regard them as dynamic or as indispensable tissue\r\nelements in the structural sense.\r\n\r\nA closely-related but less fundamental question is that of _the ability\r\nof man to store vitamines_--whether the tissues can hoard an excess of\r\nthese factors, or whether, in this respect, we are carrying on a\r\nprecarious hand-to-mouth existence in regard to cellular nutrition. It\r\nis of course clear that at all times the various organs and tissues must\r\ncontain a certain amount of the vitamines. This has been shown for the\r\nwater-soluble or \"antineuritic vitamine\" by the fact that even the\r\norgans of birds which have died of polyneuritis contain an appreciable\r\nquantity of the specific vitamine, although an insufficiency of this\r\nvery factor has led to their death. That such is the case is\r\ndemonstrated for the antiscorbutic vitamine by the fact that muscle\r\ntissue contains sufficient antiscorbutic to protect individuals\r\nsubsisting largely on a diet of which raw meat constitutes the sole\r\nantiscorbutic agent (Stefánsson). It is very probable that some organs\r\ncontain more of the vitamines than others; this has been proved for the\r\n\"antineuritic\" factor, and seems to hold good for the antiscorbutic--the\r\nliver being particularly rich. No quantitative study has been carried\r\nout from this point of view regarding the antiscorbutic vitamine, and it\r\nwould be well worth our while to ascertain the relative antiscorbutic\r\npotency of the various organs of the body. Some time ago we undertook\r\nexperiments to determine whether the guinea-pig is capable of storing\r\nthis vitamine. One series of guinea-pigs was fed daily 6 c.c. of orange\r\njuice for a period of two weeks, whereas another series, of about the\r\nsame weight, was given, in addition to the basal ration, only 3 c.c.\r\nper capita (the minimal protective dose). After this preliminary period\r\nboth series were placed on a diet containing practically no\r\nantiscorbutic. Both groups came down with scurvy after about the same\r\ninterval, leading to the conclusion that there could have been little if\r\nany storing of the excess vitamine by those which received twice the\r\n\"minimal protective dose.\" The experiments of Harden and Zilva, who fed\r\na concentrated lemon juice, showed that this potent agent also was\r\nunable to provide against a subsequent period of antiscorbutic\r\ndeficiency. It should be realized that the results of these tests on\r\nguinea-pigs cannot be applied to man without tests on other species.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that _the blood_--the purveyor of the vitamines to\r\nthe tissues--would be particularly rich in these essential factors.\r\nSuch, however, was not our experience in respect to the antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine. The blood possibly varies greatly in this respect according to\r\nthe diet of the individual, or even according to the interval elapsing\r\nafter the ingestion of antiscorbutic food. Our opinion is based on the\r\nsurprisingly poor therapeutic effect of blood transfusion in the\r\ntreatment of scurvy. To illustrate: An infant weighing about fifteen\r\npounds received six intravenous injections of citrated blood--one of 200\r\nc.c., given by the direct method, and a month later five smaller\r\ntransfusions with citrated blood, which aggregated 205 c.c.[25] In spite\r\nof this addition of blood, the hemorrhage and congestion of the gums did\r\nnot disappear, nor the general condition improve, as would have happened\r\nhad 50 or 75 c.c. of orange juice been given by mouth. It seems probable\r\nthat small quantities of vitamine are being transmitted at all times by\r\nthe blood and supplied to the cells, but that its normal content of this\r\nfactor is not great. The antiscorbutic potency of blood may perhaps be\r\ncompared to that of milk. Animal investigation may show that various\r\nvessels--for example, those supplying or draining certain glandular\r\norgans--differ in the antiscorbutic quality of the blood which they\r\ncarry. It is evident, therefore, that many transitory factors may\r\ninfluence the vitamine content of the blood, and that--as in the case of\r\nmilk and fruits and vegetables--we are not dealing with a constant and\r\nunvarying agent.\r\n\r\n[25] The dates and quantities of the transfusions were as follows: March\r\n26th, 200 c.c.; April 27th, 30 c.c.; April 28th, 35 c.c.; April 29th, 30\r\nc.c.; May 2nd, 75 c.c.; May 3rd, 35 c.c.\r\n\r\nNothing whatsoever is known concerning the _excretion_ of the\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine. No attempts have been made to recover it from\r\nthe urine, or to ascertain if, when large amounts are ingested, the\r\nexcess is thrown off by the body. This suggests the question--a\r\ncorollary of that raised in connection with the vitamine content of the\r\nblood--whether it is immaterial if the vitamine is taken frequently in\r\nsmall amounts, or is provided only occasionally and at longer intervals\r\nin larger amounts. Is it of no moment whether the infant receive its\r\nquota of antiscorbutic every few hours through the medium of the breast\r\nmilk, or only once a day in the form of orange juice or tomato? If we\r\nturn to studies on the other vitamines for enlightenment as to the\r\npossibility of excretion, we find that Muckenfuss recovered the\r\nwater-soluble factor from ox bile and from human urine.[26] In this\r\narticle he proposes the interesting question of a possible variation in\r\nthe vitamine output under pathological conditions, which may be\r\nresponsible for the development of functional disturbances in children.\r\n\r\n[26] This investigation was carried out by means of activating fuller's\r\nearth with these fluids. This method is inapplicable to the\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine, which is not adsorbed by this material. An\r\nattempt to feed concentrated human urine to guinea-pigs resulted in\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\nIt would be of interest to know the _fate of the antiscorbutic vitamine\r\nin the gastro-intestinal tract_. How is it affected by a lack of the\r\nacid gastric juice, or by the alkaline intestinal secretions, or by the\r\nbacteria in the lumen of the gut? From which part of the intestine is it\r\nlargely absorbed? May an appreciable amount undergo destruction before\r\nthis is accomplished? None of these questions can be answered\r\nsatisfactorily in the present state of our knowledge, but they suggest\r\nthat the mere fact that an adequate quota of antiscorbutic vitamine is\r\nprovided in the food does not necessarily insure an adequate supply for\r\nthe tissues. If in addition to the question of intake we must take into\r\naccount that the vitamines may suffer various vicissitudes, it may come\r\nto pass that pathological conditions at times destroy or render them\r\npartially inactive. In this way we may account for irregularities in the\r\nclinical course of disorders associated with vitamine deficiency.\r\n\r\nOf prime importance, however, is the effect of the vitamines _on the\r\nglands of the alimentary tract and on the digestive processes_. A\r\ndiminution of gastric juice, or in some instances a total absence, has\r\nbeen observed in adult scurvy, and noted by us in two cases of infantile\r\nscurvy. As mentioned elsewhere, some consider the function of the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine analogous to that of secretin. In applying this\r\nhypothesis to scurvy it must be borne in mind that the sequence may be\r\nreversed, that the lack of vitamine may not lead to the gastric achylia,\r\nbut that the achylia may come about secondarily as the result of the\r\nmalnutrition.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to _\"irregularities\" in the course of the \"deficiency\r\ndiseases.\"_ A careful perusal of the literature leaves one with the\r\nimpression that the most experienced observers are not entirely\r\nsatisfied with the exclusively etiologic relationship of the vitamine to\r\nits respective nutritional disorder. In regard to scurvy, more\r\nparticularly, there are numerous scattered reports where the disorder\r\ndid not yield to antiscorbutic foods as might have been expected, or\r\nwhere, on the other hand, it suddenly and inexplicably retrogressed,\r\nalthough there had been no alteration in the dietary.[27] These\r\ninstances are not common, but they occur from time to time, and their\r\noccurrence must be accounted for. In relation to beriberi and avian\r\npolyneuritis improvement of this kind has frequently been explained on\r\nthe theory of a sudden mobilization of vitamines from the tissues. There\r\nis, however, no data on which to base such explanations, and it may be\r\nthat a lack of parallelism between vitamine intake and the clinical\r\ncourse may be due at times to processes taking place in the alimentary\r\ntract.\r\n\r\n[27] Neumann, for example, writes that he has seen at least four\r\nchildren whose condition was not improved, although in addition to the\r\nmilk, they took asparagus, spinach, and other vegetables or apple sauce.\r\nSome years ago we had a similar experience. It has likewise happened\r\nthat infantile scurvy did not recur, although the diet was the same as\r\nthat which originally led to the disorder.\r\n\r\nThe fat-soluble vitamine has been termed by some the growth vitamine.\r\nAll the vitamines, however, are closely associated with the function of\r\ngrowth, which their deficiency tends to inhibit. In the chapter on\r\nsymptomatology, it will be pointed out that infants suffering from\r\nscurvy fail to grow normally both in length and in weight. To a certain\r\nextent this may be due to a loss of appetite, which is one of the\r\ncharacteristic phenomena accompanying the scorbutic condition. On the\r\nother hand, this anorexia may be secondary and not primary to the\r\nimpairment of the growth impulse, which may lead to a dysfunction of\r\nvarious body processes.\r\n\r\nIt is of little value to look ahead and try to foresee what the next\r\ndecade will bring forth in regard to the nature of the vitamines.\r\nInvestigation has broadened remarkably during the past few years and now\r\nembraces the chemical field--chemical and adsorption methods, the large\r\nrealm of biology, including studies in physiology and pharmacology; and\r\nrecently pathology has once more been called upon to aid in the solution\r\nof the problem. Probably additional vitamines will be discovered. From\r\ntime to time it has been suggested that a specific growth vitamine\r\nexists quite distinct from the three which are recognized, and recently\r\nMellanby has suggested still another food factor--a specific \"rachitic\r\nvitamine.\" When we reflect that the characteristic functions of the\r\nvarious organs--the kidneys, liver, etc.--must depend on essential\r\ndifferences in chemical structure, the complexity of the entire problem\r\nof unidentified factors becomes evident.[28]\r\n\r\n[28] For recent and comprehensive reviews of the vitamines the reader is\r\nreferred to papers by A. B. Macallum (Trans. Royal Canadian Institute,\r\nToronto, 1919) and by W. H. Eddy (Abstracts of Bacteriol. 1919, Vol.\r\niii, 313.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysicians have had a general knowledge of the pathology of scurvy for a\r\ngreat many years. Lind, in his \"Treatise on the Scurvy,\" published in\r\n1772, included a chapter on \"dissections\" and a postscript on\r\n\"Appearances on Dissections of Scorbutic Bodies,\" based on a large,\r\nalthough indefinite, number of postmortem examinations. In the century\r\nwhich followed, there are to be found many reports of scurvy, especially\r\nin connection with the frequent wars, but it is surprising how little\r\ndetailed pathologic information they furnish. Barlow's publication in\r\n1883, establishing the identity of the scurvy of adults and of infants,\r\nmust be regarded as the modern milestone in the study of the pathology\r\nof this disorder. This work did not contribute richly to the data of the\r\nsubject, or suggest novel interpretations, but directed attention to a\r\nnew source of material--the increasing number of cases of infantile\r\nscurvy--at a critical moment when the opportunity for the study of\r\nscurvy in the adult was rapidly becoming less. At the time of Barlow's\r\nexposition of the true nature of \"acute rickets,\" scientific medicine\r\nwas concentrating its interest on pathology. Tissues were being\r\ncarefully studied by means of the microscope, and scurvy was subjected\r\nto this new method of investigation. As a result of intensive\r\napplication of this technic, a lesion of the bones was identified and\r\nestablished as characteristic of scurvy. Study was focussed so\r\nexclusively on the bones, that for many years, indeed until very\r\nrecently, the other organs of the body were neglected. This is true of\r\nthe gross as well as of the microscopic anatomy. Protocol after protocol\r\ngives a hasty account of the appearance of the various organs, merely as\r\na routine introduction to a careful and often minute study of the bones\r\n(Table 2). As the result of this myopic vision, enlargement of the\r\nheart, for example, which should have been noted many years ago, was,\r\nuntil recently, unobserved--indeed, the heart is but occasionally\r\nmentioned in the protocols.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE 2\r\n                         NECROPSY REPORTS OF SCURVY\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n  Number|                  |    |               |\r\n    of  |      Author      |Date|    Gross      |      Microscopic\r\n  Cases |                  |    |               |\r\n  ------+------------------+----+---------------+-----------------------\r\n                              ADULTS\r\n   Many |Lind              |1772|Brief summaries|\r\n    51  |von Himmelstein   |1843|Brief summaries|\r\n     8  |Hayem             |1871|Résumé         |Brief résumé.\r\n     7  |Lasèque & Legroux |1871|Fairly detailed|\r\n     7  |Charpentier       |1871|Brief summaries|\r\n    13  |Sato & Nambu      |1908|Fairly detailed|Fairly detailed.\r\n     2  |Urizio            |1917|Brief summaries|Brief summaries.\r\n     1  |Feigenbaum        |1917|Brief summary  |Brief summary.\r\n    23  |Aschoff & Koch    |1919|Very complete  |Very complete.\r\n\r\n                       INFANTS AND CHILDREN\r\n     1  |Smith             |1876|Brief report   |\r\n     3  |Barlow            |1883|Fairly detailed|Bones, brief report.\r\n     1  |MacKenzie         |1883|Brief summary  |\r\n     1  |Northrup          |1892|Brief report   |\r\n     1  |Cassel            |1893|Brief report   |\r\n     2  |Sutherland        |1894|Fairly detailed|Brain and liver, 1 case\r\n     1  |Reinert           |1895|Very complete  |Fairly complete.\r\n     1  |Hirschsprung      |1896|Summary        |\r\n     3  |Meyer             |1896|Fairly detailed|\r\n     1  |Baginsky          |1897|Fairly detailed|Brief, bones more in\r\n        |                  |    |               | detail.\r\n     1  |Naegeli           |1897|Fairly detailed|Bones only.\r\n     1  |Manz              |1899|Summary        |\r\n     5  |Schoedel & Nauwerk|1900|Very complete  |Very complete.\r\n     1  |Jacobsthal        |1900|Very complete  |Very complete.\r\n     1  |Stoos             |1903|Fairly complete|Bones only.\r\n     1  |Looser            |1905|Summary        |\r\n     1  |Hoffmann          |1905|Summary        |Bones only.\r\n     1  |Stoeltzner        |1906|Bone only      |Bone only.\r\n    22  |Fraenkel          |1908|Résumé         |Bones only.\r\n     1  |Nobécourt et al   |1913|Brief report   |Bone only.\r\n     3  |Ingier            |1913|Brief report   |Bones, very complete.\r\n     1  |Bahrdt & Edelstein|1913|Complete       |Bones, brief report.\r\n    31  |Erdheim           |1918|Brief summaries|Brief résumé.\r\n     1  |Epstein           |1918|Very detailed  |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA new era in the pathology of scurvy was inaugurated by the availability\r\nof experimental scurvy and also by the stimulation occasioned by the\r\nrecent conception of vitamines and the so-called deficiency diseases. In\r\nendeavoring to elucidate this fascinating problem, it has gradually been\r\nrealized that pathology may be of service--for example, in relation to\r\nthe involvement of the endocrine glands. Accordingly, studies of the\r\nminute pathology of the various organs have been undertaken in many\r\nlaboratories throughout the world (Italy, India, England, Germany and\r\nthe United States). An additional stimulus to investigation in pathology\r\nhas been furnished by the recent war, which, as shown elsewhere, led to\r\na great increase in scurvy among both the military and civilian\r\npopulation. The excellent report of Aschoff and Koch from Roumania was\r\nmade possible by this catastrophe, and will no doubt soon be followed by\r\nothers of similar character.\r\n\r\n=Gross Pathology.--General Appearance.=--The skin usually is pale,\r\nlivid, and dotted with numerous petechiæ. These vary in size from the\r\ntiniest pin-points, barely recognizable to the naked eye, to ecchymoses\r\nof moderately large size. The most frequent site is the lower\r\nextremities. The trunk is always less affected, hemorrhages tending to\r\noccur along the mid-line and especially around the umbilicus. There may\r\nbe also larger superficial hemorrhages, showing great differences in\r\ncolor, from the redder tone of the more recent, to the blues, browns and\r\ngreens of the older lesions. Bleeding from the nose and mouth is not\r\nuncommon in fatal scurvy, and occasionally exophthalmos is present,\r\nusually unilateral, and due to subperiosteal hemorrhage of the orbital\r\nplate of the frontal bone. Rigor mortis is generally slight, and,\r\naccording to Lind and to von Opitz, decomposition takes place rapidly.\r\n\r\nThere may be great emaciation, especially where secondary infection has\r\nsupervened. General wasting occurs, however, in uncomplicated scurvy due\r\nto starvation--the result of lack of appetite or a deficiency of the\r\ngeneral food supply. Children, especially infants, are undersized, as\r\nillustrated in treating of the symptomatology, and their bones may be\r\ndecidedly smaller than normal. Generally there is some edema about\r\nthe ankles, and in children a somewhat characteristic puffiness about\r\nthe eyes. General anasarca also occurs, in some cases associated with\r\nrenal involvement. Peculiar boggy, \"tumor-like\" masses of localized\r\nedema may be present, which were considered by the earlier writers\r\n(Lind) to be one of the typical lesions of this condition.\r\n\r\n=Hemorrhages.=--Hemorrhage is such a striking manifestation that it is\r\nnot surprising to find it was regarded by the older writers as the\r\npathognomonic sign of scurvy. The bleeding may take place into almost\r\nany organ, and vary from small petechiæ to very extensive\r\nextravasations. The hair follicles and sweat glands are particularly\r\nsusceptible, as Lasèque and Legroux noticed in cases occurring in the\r\nFrench prisons. Aschoff and Koch, during the recent war, noted the same\r\npeculiarity of involvement, calling attention also to the fact that\r\nprevious skin diseases such as keratosis or seborrhea seemed to\r\npredispose to this localization.\r\n\r\nTrauma plays a very important rôle in determining the location of the\r\ndeeper as well as of the superficial hemorrhages. In adults, especially\r\nin soldiers, in whom the greater number of cases have been recorded, the\r\nlower extremity is the commonest site, between the knee and ankle, the\r\narea most exposed to blows as well as acted upon by static congestion.\r\nIn infants, the inner aspect of the thighs is a frequent site due to the\r\ntrauma of the diaper.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic hemorrhage, the subperiosteal, will be fully\r\ndiscussed when considering the bone lesions. The deeper hemorrhages may\r\nbe very extensive. They tend to follow the connective-tissue strata, and\r\nin the muscles are usually limited by the muscle sheaths. The blood\r\nsurrounds the muscle fibres, which appear quite intact. The neighboring\r\nblood-vessels are congested and may contain thrombi, both venous and\r\narterial. Such thrombi are found also in areas where extravasation has\r\nnot taken place, and conversely, hemorrhages occur where no thrombi are\r\ndemonstrable, so that a mutual causal relationship cannot be proved.\r\nFurther evidence in regard to the mechanism of these extravasations is\r\npresented in the discussion of the minute anatomy. Brownish pigment,\r\nundoubtedly derived from the blood, is frequently found in the\r\nneighborhood of the hemorrhagic areas. New connective tissue also grows\r\nin these areas, so that in healing cases a marked formation of scar\r\ntissue will be found. Bizarre forms of hemorrhage at times have given\r\nrise to confusion in diagnosis; hemorrhage involving the right lower\r\nabdominal quadrant may simulate appendicitis; when occurring in the\r\nregion of the transverse colon it has been mistaken for an epigastric\r\nnew-growth.\r\n\r\nCertain parts of the body seem less predisposed to hemorrhage. The\r\ncentral nervous system is often spared, notwithstanding extensive\r\nbleeding elsewhere, the meninges being somewhat more frequently\r\ninvolved. Hemorrhage of the lungs is also less common than might be\r\nexpected, and it is probably true as Lasèque and Legroux suggested, that\r\nprevious pulmonary disease, particularly tuberculosis, is an important\r\npredisposing factor.\r\n\r\n=Anasarca.=--This comprises the second characteristic lesion found in\r\nscurvy at necropsy and was referred to in the earliest records of the\r\ndisease. In the account of his dissections Lind writes: \"The breast,\r\nbelly and several other parts of the body were filled with this water\r\nor serum,\" mentioning also the pericardium and ventricles of the brain.\r\nHe also noted that all the tissues seemed to contain an excessive amount\r\nof fluid, a condition which may be so striking that the muscles appear\r\nbathed in serum. In one of his first cases with postmortem verification,\r\nBarlow described this appearance as follows: \"The muscular walls of the\r\nthorax were pale yellow and watery, as though they had been bathed in\r\nserum.\" In many cases this edema is most marked in the neighborhood of\r\nthe hemorrhages, for example, in the muscles of the thigh when\r\nsubperiosteal hemorrhage has taken place; less frequently it is produced\r\nby venous thrombosis.\r\n\r\nAny or all of the serous cavities may be involved in this hydrops, the\r\norder of frequency being pericardium, pleuræ, peritoneum, and joint\r\nsurfaces, especially the knee. The fluid is clear and straw-colored, or,\r\nin the event of secondary infection, becomes cloudy and\r\nfibrino-purulent. Later the exudate may become organized so that the\r\nentire cavity is filled with a solid mass, which binds the organs\r\ntogether and obliterates the cavity. The exudate may be blood-stained or\r\napparently consist entirely of clotted blood.\r\n\r\n=Heart.=--In the protocols of most necropsies, the heart is passed over\r\nwith scant mention. For example, Lind's only statement in this regard is\r\nthat \"all those who died suddenly, without any visible cause of their\r\ndeath, had the auricles of their heart as big as one's fist, and full of\r\ncoagulated blood.\" Barlow accords it no attention, nor do most of the\r\nwriters who immediately followed him. The first careful description of\r\nthe heart is to be found in the excellent work of Schoedel and Nauwerk,\r\nwhich contains the following record in regard to three of the five\r\nnecropsies on infantile scurvy: (1) Pericardial fluid somewhat\r\nincreased, both ventricles moderately dilated, the right somewhat\r\nhypertrophic. (2) The heart showed a hypertrophy of the right and left\r\nventricles, as well as dilatation of the right ventricle. (3) The right\r\nventricle is dilated and slightly hypertrophied, the muscles pale and\r\ntough. There is no word of comment relative to these cardiac changes,\r\nwhich evidently were considered fortuitous. The same observation holds\r\ntrue in regard to a necropsy on an eight-year-old child reported by\r\nIngier, which showed a moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricle. We\r\nlook in vain, likewise, for information on the subject in the work on\r\nguinea-pig scurvy by Holst and Froelich, and that on scurvy in the\r\nmonkey by Hart and Lessing. The first linking of cardiac enlargement\r\nwith scurvy is found in a paper by Darling, who described \"right-sided\r\nhypertrophy and degenerative changes in the vagus and all its branches.\"\r\nHess described and demonstrated by means of roentgenograms the enlarged\r\nheart in infantile scurvy. Recently Erdheim, in an article entitled \"Das\r\nBarlowherz,\" reported the occurrence of enlargement of the heart,\r\nespecially of the right ventricle, in 21 out of 31 necropsies of\r\ninfantile scurvy, and concluded that a direct ratio exists between the\r\ndegree of enlargement and the intensity of the disorder. These reports\r\ngain added interest in view of the enlargement of the right heart so\r\nfrequently encountered in beriberi, and described by Andrews in infants\r\ndying of this condition. In addition to the definite statement of\r\nDarling regarding adults, mention may be made of the observation of\r\nAschoff and Koch, that in two cases of uncomplicated scurvy there were\r\nfatty degeneration and dilatation of the heart. Fatty degeneration of\r\nthe muscle is frequent, brown atrophy exceptional. Sato and Nambu also\r\nfound hyperæmia and atrophy with increase of connective tissue between\r\nthe muscle fibres.\r\n\r\nThe pericardial cavity contains almost invariably an increased quantity\r\nof fluid, which may be so great as to impede the heart's action.\r\nAdhesive pericarditis has been described. The cardiac valves are normal,\r\nunless previously damaged.\r\n\r\n=Lungs.=--The lungs are almost always congested, but apart from this are\r\nremarkably free from abnormality. Smaller or larger hemorrhages are\r\ndescribed occasionally, which are usually considered truly scorbutic;\r\nAndrews, however, found similar lesions in beriberi. In the necropsy of\r\nStephen Mackenzie's case, described by Barlow, these small hemorrhages\r\nare stated to have resembled small red tubercles scattered throughout\r\nthe lung. There may be pulmonary infarcts. Edema of the lungs is not\r\nuncommon, as we should expect, especially as a terminal condition.\r\nPneumonia, lobular or lobar, is one of the most frequent complications\r\nand causes of death. Active tuberculosis is a not uncommon secondary\r\nmanifestation.\r\n\r\nSubserous hemorrhages are almost the rule; if infection supervenes, the\r\npleuræ become thickened and covered with an exudate of pus and fibrin.\r\n\r\n=Alimentary Tract.=--The lesions of the gums so well recognized\r\nclinically are fully discussed under symptomatology. The remarkable fact\r\nthat these hemorrhages do not appear in edentulous gums has been the\r\ncentre of the controversy as to the identity of adult scurvy and\r\nBarlow's disease. This same lack of involvement is noted in adults whose\r\nteeth have been extracted. Where teeth are present, the gums are swollen\r\nand edematous, often of a livid, reddish color; less frequently, pale\r\nand pouting. Hemorrhage is seen at the edge of the gum adjacent to the\r\nteeth. In advanced cases the gums are enormously swollen, fungous,\r\nulcerated and covered with a foul, greenish, necrotic mass, which may\r\nextend widely over the buccal mucous membrane. The teeth become loosened\r\nand fall out. Secondary infection undoubtedly plays the chief rôle in\r\nproducing this condition, for the most severe forms are found only where\r\ncaries and pyorrhoea preëxisted. This seat of infection may serve as the\r\nsource of dissemination throughout the body, giving rise to many of the\r\nlesions found at postmortem, especially in the lower part of the\r\nintestinal tract.\r\n\r\nThe _stomach_ shows no characteristic changes. Congestion of the mucosa\r\nis frequent, at times associated with small superficial erosions; the\r\nlatter gain added interest in view of their occurrence in guinea-pig\r\nscurvy. Hemorrhages occur here also and may involve any of the mural\r\ncoats.\r\n\r\nThe _duodenum_ shows often intense congestion. This occurs with\r\nsufficient frequency to demand attention, especially as a similar\r\ncondition has been described in other disorders grouped with scurvy.\r\nWillcox and others found congestion of the duodenum and of the lower\r\nintestine in beriberi, and Andrews described not only congestion but\r\neven minute hemorrhages. Small duodenal ulcers are by no means\r\ninfrequent both in human and in guinea-pig scurvy (Holst and Froelich).\r\nThe presence of such marked congestion surrounding the papilla of Vater\r\nwould lead us to expect the occurrence of catarrhal jaundice associated\r\nwith scurvy. But, on the contrary, icterus has rarely been noted in\r\nscurvy. Urizio has described jaundice in this connection, but it is\r\ndifficult to decide whether his cases were true scurvy, as they occurred\r\nin an epidemic of jaundice and no histologic examination of the bones\r\nwas carried out.\r\n\r\nThe _intestine_ may present a variety of lesions.[29] The mucosa is\r\nfrequently congested and swollen, and the solitary follicles and Peyer's\r\npatches enlarged. These changes may progress to necrosis and extensive\r\nulceration. In an outbreak of scurvy occurring in this country in 1917,\r\nin a large institution for epileptics, ulceration was a frequent lesion\r\nat necropsy.[30] Dysentery, a frequent complication of scurvy in some\r\nepidemics, may add to this ulceration and lead to even complete\r\nsloughing of the inner lining of the intestine. Hemorrhages are found in\r\nthe mucous, serous or muscular layers. Here, as elsewhere, the\r\nhemorrhages vary in size from petechiæ to large infiltrations of blood.\r\nA very striking picture is sometimes presented by the pale, edematous\r\nintestinal wall dotted or streaked with vivid red.\r\n\r\n[29] For details regarding the intestinal lesions in infantile scurvy,\r\nthe reader is referred to Barlow's description of the case of Stephen\r\nMackenzie, to one necropsy report by Theodor Fischer, one by\r\nHirschsprung, one by Meyer, and five by Schoedel and Nauwerk. The\r\nprevailing lesions are hemorrhages, pigmentation, follicular ulceration,\r\nand enlargement of the mesenteric glands.\r\n\r\n[30] The potato crop largely failed this year, and there was\r\nconsiderable scurvy in the spring, as described in the chapter on\r\nantiscorbutics.\r\n\r\n=Liver.=--The liver is frequently congested, as would be expected in\r\nview of the involvement of the right heart. Erdheim found congestion,\r\nhowever, in only nine among thirty-one necropsies, although enlargement\r\nof the heart was present twenty-one times. There may be hemorrhages in\r\nthe glandular tissue or under the peritoneum. \"Cloudy\" and fatty\r\ndegenerations occur occasionally, and in some cases an early cirrhosis.\r\nLind found abscess of the liver, and wrote that in a few instances \"the\r\nmatter or corruption was hardened, as it were, into a stone.\"\r\n\r\n=Spleen.=--This organ is usually somewhat enlarged and congested.\r\nCharpentier, in the Paris epidemic of 1871, found it often three to four\r\ntimes the normal size and very soft, and Lind tells us that \"the spleen\r\nwas three times bigger than natural, and fell to pieces, as if composed\r\nof congealed blood.\" It must be remembered that the pathologic as well\r\nas the clinical picture of the scurvy of Lind and his time was generally\r\ncomplicated by infection. The enlargement is usually by no means so\r\ngreat, and no doubt is due in part to intercurrent infections. On\r\nsection, it is found frequently to contain much reddish-brown pigment.\r\nHemorrhage may also occur. In beriberi, Andrews observed frequent\r\ncongestion of the spleen and also a loss of normal markings.\r\n\r\n=Pancreas.=--There is but one reference to a lesion of the pancreas in\r\nscurvy, that of Sato and Nambu, who encountered hemorrhage of this organ\r\nin one case among the necropsies performed in the course of the\r\nRusso-Japanese War.\r\n\r\n=Kidneys.=--Here again, congestion and hemorrhage are the two lesions\r\nmost commonly found. The kidneys also may show any of the forms of\r\nnephropathy ordinarily recognized, but these must be regarded as\r\ncomplicating conditions and not a part of the true scurvy.\r\n\r\nSmall hemorrhages may be found in the uterus, bladder or urethra. They\r\nare especially common in the bladder, both in man and in the guinea-pig,\r\nand in some instances may be the cause of the hæmaturia noted during\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n=Lymph-nodes.=--General enlargement of the lymph-nodes has been\r\ndescribed, but occurs probably only in advanced cases where a general\r\ninfection has been superadded. As a rule the enlargement is confined to\r\nnodes draining areas where hemorrhage has occurred. On section these\r\nnodes are reddish or brownish as the result of the pigment which they\r\ncontain, the \"black and red spots of different sizes\" mentioned by Lind.\r\nFollowing infection they may become purulent, resulting in the inguinal\r\nbuboes so frequently mentioned by the older authors,[31] or in the\r\npurulent mesenteric nodes associated with intestinal ulceration.\r\n\r\n[31] Lind writes: \"In the months of July and August I opened near\r\nseventy large swellings in the groin, proceeding entirely from scurvy.\"\r\n... \"We found the glands under their arm-pits much enlarged and\r\nsurrounded with purulent matter, as well as the muscles of their arms\r\nand thighs.\" ... \"The glands of the mesentery are generally obstructed\r\nand swelled. Some of these were found partly corrupted and\r\nimposthumated.\"\r\n\r\n=Organs of Internal Secretion.=--Until recently these organs have\r\nreceived but little attention. It is probable, however, that in the near\r\nfuture they will be the object of close study and that new information\r\nwill be acquired as to their condition in this disorder. Hemorrhages are\r\ncommonly seen in the adrenals, enlarging them greatly and giving them a\r\ndeep red color; the hemorrhage generally involves mainly the medullary\r\nportion.[32] It is probable that careful scrutiny will disclose\r\nhemorrhages in the other glands of internal secretion. The question of\r\nthe involvement of these glands will be again considered under the\r\nmicroscopic anatomy, and has been taken up from a functional standpoint\r\nin treating of the possible indirect action of the vitamines.\r\n\r\n[32] In view of the report of Hart and Lessing of calcium deposits in\r\nthe adrenal glands of monkeys suffering from scurvy, special attention\r\nshould be given to this point in necropsies on human beings.\r\n\r\n=The brain and the spinal cord= likewise have been but little studied.\r\nIt is hardly to be expected that much will be learned from an\r\ninvestigation of the gross pathology of these organs, but the\r\nmicroscopic anatomy offers a promising field of research. Hemorrhage may\r\noccur into the brain substance, into the cord or the membranes\r\nsurrounding them. Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica interna has been\r\ndescribed frequently (Meyer, Hayem, Sutherland, Sato and Nambu) and may\r\ngive rise to the symptoms of meningitis. Sutherland reports an instance\r\nwhere thrombosis of the basal artery was found postmortem. In one case,\r\nthat of Feigenbaum, hemorrhage of the cord was diagnosed during life and\r\nconfirmed at necropsy.\r\n\r\nThe peripheral nerves may be the seat of hemorrhages, the blood lying\r\nbetween the nerve trunk and its sheath. This is particularly well\r\nillustrated in the recent work of Aschoff and Koch.\r\n\r\n=Bones.=--Palpation of the body will often reveal distinct lesion of the\r\nbones, such as fractures, either ununited or healed with the formation\r\nof large calluses; subperiosteal hemorrhages, especially of the distal\r\nend of the femur or of the tibia, may be evident to the eye as well as\r\nto the touch. Crepitation of the bones may serve to further establish\r\nthe break in continuity of the bones. This lesion was well known to the\r\nolder writers. Lind writes that \"in some, when moved, we heard a small\r\ngrating of the bones. Upon operating those bodies the epiphyses were\r\nfound entirely separated from the bones; which, by rubbing against each\r\nother, occasioned this noise.\" \"All the young persons under 18 had in\r\nsome degree their epiphyses separated from the body of the bone, this\r\nwater having penetrated into the very substance of it.\" Poupart was also\r\nstruck by this phenomenon in young adults.\r\n\r\nAnother bony alteration which is readily palpable is \"beading\" of the\r\nribs, the counterpart of the rhachitic rosary. This has not been\r\nconsidered a sign of scurvy, and when noted clinically or at postmortem\r\nhas been passed over without comment, just as has been the case with\r\ncardiac hypertrophy. In infants the beading has been attributed to\r\nrickets, and this error has been largely responsible for the general\r\nopinion that almost all infants suffering from scurvy suffer also from\r\nrickets. If we scan the literature with this question in mind, we find\r\nnumerous casual references to beading of the ribs in scurvy. Fraenkel's\r\nfrequently cited case of a child of seven who died of acute scurvy,\r\nshowed beading of the ribs during life as well as after death. The true\r\nscorbutic character of these enlargements was substantiated by\r\nmicroscopic examination. In their pathologic studies on scurvy among\r\nsoldiers, Aschoff and Koch frequently describe beading of the ribs,\r\nwhich they attribute to an infraction of the costochondral\r\njunctions.[33] There may be fracture at this junction, or a separation\r\nof the cartilages from the sternum, as described by Lind.\r\n\r\n[33] The beading may have the usual, rounded, smooth, knobby character.\r\nThere may be, however, what one might term \"angular beading,\" the\r\njunction taking on a step-like form, as if the abutting ends of the\r\ncartilage and the bone were of unequal size and not well fitted to each\r\nother. The cartilage overtops the bone, so that on palpating the joint\r\nthere is a precipitous fall as we run the finger outward from the\r\nsurface of the cartilage, or a sudden elevation on palpating the rib\r\nfrom without inward toward the sternum.\r\n\r\nThis beading of the ribs, which involves mainly the middle tier, was\r\ndescribed by Holst and Froelich in their classic report of guinea-pig\r\nscurvy, and has been noted by all subsequent investigators in this\r\nfield. It has usually been called \"rhachitic\" or \"pseudo-rhachitic\" in\r\nspite of the fact that this junction is the site of typical scorbutic\r\nmicroscopic lesions. Hart and Lessing refer to the \"rhachitic rosary\" in\r\nmonkeys, likewise not realizing that it is the product of scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe subperiosteal hemorrhage has long been recognized as a lesion\r\ncharacteristic of scurvy.[34] It occurs exceptionally in the upper\r\nextremities, and most commonly at the lower end of the femur; it may,\r\nhowever, involve almost any of the bones, and has been described in\r\nconnection with the scapula, cranial vault, orbital plate of the frontal\r\nbone, ribs, etc. It varies greatly in its size, being confined to a\r\nsmall area or extending a long distance on the shaft of the bone. It\r\nrarely is as large as one would expect from external appearance, as much\r\nof the swelling is due to edema and hemorrhage into the soft parts. The\r\nperiosteum rarely becomes separated at the line of junction of the\r\nepiphysis and diaphysis. The underlying blood coagulates rapidly, and\r\nthe periosteum begins to calcify within a few weeks, as shown by the\r\nX-ray.\r\n\r\n[34] There seems to be some misconception as to the pathogenesis of the\r\nsubperiosteal hemorrhage in scurvy. In most reports this lesion is\r\ndescribed as if it resulted from a hemorrhage burrowing its way beneath\r\nthe periosteum and raising it from the subjacent bone. In point of fact,\r\nsuch an event is impossible, as will be fully realized when one\r\nexperiences the great difficulty in separating periosteum from normal\r\nbone. Scurvy involves a periosteum which is not normal; it is insecurely\r\nattached to the shaft of the bone, so that it is readily stripped off by\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent site of fracture, or separation of the epiphysis, is\r\nthe lower end of the femur. This may be accompanied by local swelling,\r\nor be discovered at necropsy, or during life by means of the X-ray in\r\ncases in which it has not been suspected. An interesting fracture\r\nreported by the author, and also mentioned by Kaufmann and by Schoedel,\r\nis that of the head of the femur leading to the development of coxa\r\nvara. In the author's case, the condition was found in a scorbutic\r\ninfant who had never stood on its feet. Schoedel suggests that scurvy\r\nmay at times be the etiologic factor in coxa vara as well as in some\r\ncases diagnosed as congenital dislocation of the hip.\r\n\r\nOn sectioning the bones longitudinally the cortex is noted to be\r\nexceedingly thin, a mere shell and very brittle. The trabeculæ are so\r\nthin and reduced in number that the bone has become a very fragile\r\nstructure. The marrow is no longer deep red at the ends of the long\r\nbones, but yellowish, frequently presenting a patchy appearance. It has\r\na gelatinous consistency. This \"Geruestmark\" is one of the\r\ncharacteristic anatomical changes of scurvy, and will be fully described\r\nin considering the microscopic picture. Hemorrhages can be clearly\r\ndistinguished in the marrow, and are of varying shades denoting their\r\nirregular occurrence. These hemorrhages were considered by Looser to be\r\nthe cause of the connective-tissue formation in the marrow, but do not\r\noccur with sufficient constancy to warrant this interpretation.\r\nMoreover, this \"frame-work marrow\" is found where there is no evidence\r\nof previous hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC PATHOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Skin.=--As pointed out by Aschoff and Koch, examination of skin which\r\nto gross appearance was the seat of typical small hemorrhages, showed\r\nvarious lesions. In some, perhaps the most typical forms, there had\r\nbeen a fresh extravasation of red blood-cells. This condition is found\r\nusually in the subepidermal layers, especially in the papillary stratum.\r\nThese small hemorrhages occur very frequently about the hair follicles\r\nand sweat glands, especially when they have been diseased. Where the\r\nbleeding has been of long standing, dark brownish pigment deposits are\r\nfound and all blood-cells may have disappeared. Phagocytic cells are\r\nalmost always present and may be of the \"wandering\" or of the more fixed\r\nconnective-tissue type. Many round cells may be seen in these areas\r\nlying between the connective-tissue strands or around the blood-vessels.\r\nRheindorf, as quoted by Tuechler, has called attention to this\r\nround-celled reaction, which in many instances gives a picture analogous\r\nto the granulomas, and which leads him to infer an infectious origin for\r\nthese lesions. Other areas which appeared to be the seat of hemorrhage\r\nare shown by the microscope to be small abscesses or new connective\r\ntissue often loaded with pigment and detritus, apparently representing\r\nthe final stage of these lesions. Aschoff and Koch have found that\r\nsuitably-stained preparations frequently show a loss of elastic fibres,\r\nwhich Rheindorf states constitutes one of the earliest changes of this\r\ndisorder. The blood-vessels in the vicinity of the hemorrhages are\r\ncongested, especially the capillaries and small venules.\r\n\r\n=The muscles= also present a similar diverse picture of old and recent\r\nhemorrhages, pigment deposit and round-celled infiltration. Increase of\r\nconnective tissue is usually found between the fibre bundles and in some\r\ncases where the hemorrhages are apparently of long standing, as\r\nevidenced by loss of contour of the red cells and pigmentation of the\r\nsurrounding areas, this scar tissue formation is very marked. Changes in\r\nthe muscle fibres themselves have not been encountered by all observers.\r\nHayem describes widespread fatty degeneration and a deposit of pigment\r\nwithin the fibres, Leven a loss of sarcolemma, while Lasèque and Legroux\r\nfound fatty changes which were equally marked in muscles showing no\r\nhemorrhage. On the other hand, Aschoff and Koch, in their careful\r\nstudies, did not find noteworthy fatty change of the fibres, but\r\nobserved often that the fibres within the hemorrhagic areas seemed\r\nshrunken and were stained abnormally deep with eosin.\r\n\r\nIn monkeys dying of experimental scurvy, Hart and Lessing describe\r\ngranules in the muscles, which, judged by their staining affinities,\r\nevidently contained calcium and were similar to those found in the\r\nadrenal glands.\r\n\r\n=Blood-vessels.=--A similar difference of opinion obtains in regard to\r\nthe changes in the walls of the blood-vessels, especially of those in\r\nhemorrhagic areas. This question is of particular interest because of\r\nits bearing on the problem of the mechanism involved in the escape of\r\nthe blood. Since it has been demonstrated that neither the clotting time\r\nnor the viscosity of the blood is markedly changed in scurvy but that\r\nweakness of the vessel walls exists, as demonstrated by \"the capillary\r\nresistance test,\" it is natural that we should seek an explanation in\r\nthe microscopic pathology of the vessels. So far no change has been\r\nfound. The application of some of the newer stains, such as those for\r\nmitochondria and other cell granules, has not been resorted to for this\r\nstudy, and might furnish valuable information.\r\n\r\nHayem found fatty infiltration of the walls of the small veins and\r\ncapillaries, and believed this to play an important rôle in the etiology\r\nof these bleedings. Lasèque and Legroux also found occasional fatty\r\nchanges. Other authors have failed to demonstrate similar lesions, or\r\nhave considered them due to postmortem change. Koch searched in vain for\r\n\"rents\" in the vessel walls to account for the escape of blood. Hyaline\r\ndegeneration has also been described, but is believed to result from\r\nsecondary infections and not to be an intrinsic lesion of scurvy (Sato\r\nand Nambu, Aschoff and Koch).\r\n\r\nThrombosis of vessels is found both in the neighborhood of hemorrhage\r\nand elsewhere, the thrombi at times completely occluding the vessels and\r\ngiving rise to typical wedge-shaped infarcts. The lung often shows areas\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\n=Lungs.=--Hemorrhages of various size occur in the tissue of the lung or\r\nin the air spaces. Hemorrhagic infarcts also have been described, and\r\nSato and Nambu report hyaline degeneration of the blood-vessel walls.\r\nSecondary pneumonias, usually broncho-pneumonic in type, are of common\r\noccurrence, and in many epidemics constitute the prevailing cause of\r\ndeath. Tuberculous lesions are also frequently present, and are stated\r\nto assume fresh activity as the result of the nutritional disorder.\r\nEdema occurs frequently, the fluid in the acini often containing red\r\nblood-cells. Subpleural hemorrhages, thickening of the pleura, purulent\r\nor fibrinous pleurisy are common lesions.\r\n\r\n=Heart.=--Although hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart have been\r\nnoted by several observers, microscopic changes have rarely been\r\nrecorded. Meyer, and also Leven, report fatty degeneration of the muscle\r\nfibres, which, however, was found by Aschoff and Koch in only one case.\r\nSato and Nambu described an increase of connective tissue, and others\r\nanemia and pigmentation. Thickening of the pericardium and subserous\r\nhemorrhages also occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nALIMENTARY TRACT\r\n\r\n=Gums.=--Where it has been possible to examine the gums of early cases,\r\nwhere swelling, redness or bluish discoloration are the chief symptoms\r\nand before secondary infection has set in, the microscopic picture is\r\nvery similar to that of the skin. Small hemorrhages, round-celled\r\ninfiltration, increase of connective tissue, clumps of pigment\r\ncontaining cells, or a diffuse deposit of brownish granules complete the\r\npicture. Congestion and edema are usually evident. The changes are most\r\npronounced in the deeper layers of the submucosa and about the muscles,\r\nleaving the superficial layers strikingly intact, beneath an apparently\r\nnormal epithelium. In the later stages, erosion of the mucosa occurs,\r\nand the upper layers of submucosa become involved. Polynuclear cells\r\nappear in great numbers, abscesses and ulcers are formed, which with\r\nproper staining can be shown to harbor the various types of mouth\r\nbacteria, cocci, spirillæ, etc. The pigmentation becomes intense, and a\r\nmarked increase of the newly-formed connective tissue takes place.\r\n\r\nThe lesions of the stomach are neither characteristic nor, as a rule,\r\nvery striking. Hemorrhages occur, the larger ones generally in the\r\nsubperitoneal layers, the smaller ones in any of the coats. Thickening\r\nof the wall follows or accompanies these hemorrhages. Superficial\r\nerosions of the mucosa or even ulcers may be seen.\r\n\r\nThe striking congestion of the duodenum has been fully discussed in\r\nconsidering the gross pathology. At any level in the intestinal tract\r\nhemorrhage may take place, with the resulting pigmentation and scar\r\ntissue formation. The lymphoid structures--solitary follicles and\r\nPeyer's patches--are usually intensely congested and often the seat of\r\nhemorrhage. They constitute the sites of predilection for ulcerative\r\nprocesses of the gut. Bacteria can be demonstrated at times in the\r\nsubmucous layers; however, no type has been found to predominate, the\r\nflora being composed of the usual intestinal forms. Aschoff and Koch\r\nhave demonstrated in these ulcers the spirilla and fusiform bacilli so\r\ncommonly found in the mouth. These follicular ulcers may be found in any\r\npart of the intestine, and may be shallow erosions, or extend through\r\nthe follicle into the deeper tissues. Hemorrhages are commonly located\r\nabout the follicles. The epithelial layer is edematous, often showing an\r\nincreased number of cells.\r\n\r\nThe lymph-nodes may be congested, or edematous and hemorrhagic. Pigment\r\nis usually present and in some cases the peripheral sinus is distended\r\nwith pigment-loaded cells. Where secondary infection has occurred,\r\nextensive necrosis of the glands is seen. This is found frequently in\r\nmesenteric nodes where severe intestinal lesions are present. The nodes\r\nlying in the drainage paths of hemorrhagic areas, especially the\r\ninguinal nodes, show active resorption of blood and blood pigments, and,\r\nas noted above, may be the seat of infection.\r\n\r\n=Liver.=--In this organ, likewise, no change is found with sufficient\r\nregularity to warrant its acceptance as a distinctive lesion of scurvy.\r\nFatty infiltration is, however, very common in the centre as well as in\r\nthe periphery of the lobules. It is frequently associated with\r\ncongestion, which may be so great as to lead to atrophy. In one case of\r\nAschoff and Koch the picture resembled that of primary liver atrophy.\r\nThe organ frequently contains extravasated blood or depositions of old\r\nblood pigment. It should be noted that Boerich described early cirrhosis\r\nin several of his cases, and that Aschoff and Koch record that one of\r\ntheir severe, acute cases showed \"a recent cellular cirrhosis.\" An\r\nexceptional lesion is reported by Reinert--a \"leucocytic\" infiltration\r\nof the liver and spleen occurring in a three-year-old child, and\r\nresembling that seen in pseudoleukæmia. Finally, it should be remembered\r\nin this connection that Hart and Lessing found calcium deposits not only\r\nin the muscles and adrenal glands of their monkeys, but also in the\r\nliver.\r\n\r\n=The spleen= shares the general congestion of the internal organs. Sato\r\nand Nambu invariably found large numbers of pigment granules in this\r\norgan. Hirschsprung noted many Malpighian corpuscles, Reinert describes\r\na true hyperplasia of the splenic pulp, and others mention infarcts and\r\nsubcapsular hemorrhages.\r\n\r\n=The kidneys= are often normal. On the other hand, various forms of\r\nnephritis are found, with cloudy swelling or interstitial change--a not\r\ninfrequent complication of scurvy. More typical of the primary disease\r\nare congestion and hemorrhages, the bleedings occurring either under the\r\ncapsule, into the interstitial tissues, or into the lumina of the\r\ntubules. Hayem found fatty infiltration of this organ and Aschoff and\r\nKoch a slight change of this kind in one case.\r\n\r\n=Adrenals.=--A new interest in the study of the adrenals in diseases of\r\nthe \"deficiency\" group has been created by the recent work of\r\nMcCarrison. This author found the adrenals increased in size and weight\r\nin guinea-pigs dying of scurvy, whereas the adrenalin content of these\r\nglands was markedly decreased. On section there was hemorrhagic\r\ninfiltration, \"usually circumscribed in extent and situated around the\r\nperiphery of the adrenal cortex.\" This was seen even in early cases\r\nbefore hemorrhage had occurred elsewhere in the body. He describes also\r\n\"degenerative changes in the cellular elements of cortex and medulla\"\r\nconsisting of vacuolation and disintegration of the cells with\r\ndisappearance or loss of staining reactions of their nuclei. Rondoni,\r\nsome years previously, had called attention to this increase in size and\r\nhyperæmia of the adrenals in guinea-pigs fed exclusively cereal diets.\r\nHe, as well as McCarrison, noted an increase, though much less marked,\r\nas the result of starvation. LaMer and Campbell recently have confirmed\r\nMcCarrison's report of an augmentation in the weight of the adrenal\r\nglands in guinea-pigs fed on diets deficient in the antiscorbutic\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nComparable lesions have as yet not been found in human scurvy. These\r\nglands have been found normal by Jacobsthal, Schoedel and Nauwerk,\r\nIngier and Epstein. In the cases of Aschoff and Koch no abnormality was\r\nnoted except an almost constant increase in lipoid content. In those of\r\nBoerich the glands were normal in all but one case; in this instance the\r\nmedulla was somewhat increased in size. In passing, we may repeat that\r\nHart and Lessing found calcium deposits in the adrenals of four of their\r\nfive monkeys, a lesion which has never been recorded in man.\r\n\r\nIt is valuable in this connection to compare the adrenal in scurvy\r\nwith that of beriberi. In this disorder, Albert found the adrenal normal\r\nin one case, and Andrews describes only congestion in his eighteen\r\nnecropsies. Ono found an increased adrenalin content in nine fatal\r\ncases, and states that the medulla appeared \"fatter\" than normal. More\r\ndata will have to be obtained before it can be determined whether\r\ncharacteristic changes occur in scurvy, and how to interpret the\r\nhypertrophy described by several authors as common to guinea-pig scurvy.\r\n\r\n=Pancreas.=--Sato and Nambu appear to be the only investigators who have\r\ndescribed lesions in the pancreas. They found hemorrhages in one case\r\namong thirteen.\r\n\r\n=Thymus.=--This organ has rarely been examined. Aschoff and Koch found\r\nno abnormalities in adults, nor did Jacobsthal in a case of infantile\r\nscurvy. Boerich noted enlargement in one instance.\r\n\r\n=Other Organs of Internal Secretion.=--Very little attention has been\r\npaid to these organs. Aschoff and Koch state that the thyroids and\r\nhypophyses were normal in their cases.\r\n\r\n=Generative Organs.=--No abnormalities have been described.\r\n\r\n=Central Nervous System.=--The most frequent abnormality of the central\r\nnervous system is, as would be expected, hemorrhage; this has been\r\ndiscussed in the section dealing with gross pathology. No specific\r\nchanges have been found in nerve-cells or fibres of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn a case of fatal scurvy in an infant a \"focal degeneration of the\r\nlumbar cord\" has been described, extending for a distance of about a\r\nquarter of an inch (Hess). The lesion differed from that of\r\npoliomyelitis in the absence of round-celled infiltration and of the\r\ncharacteristic changes in the anterior horn cells (Figs. 3 and 4). The\r\noutstanding feature was a loss of cells in the lateral groups of the\r\nleft anterior horn; there were also fewer nerve fibres in this region,\r\nbut this diminution was less striking. No definite interpretation of\r\nthis case can be made as the data are insufficient to permit a\r\nconclusion as to whether the lesion was truly scorbutic or the result of\r\nan associated process. Schoedel and Nauwerk found no change in the\r\nspinal cord stained by Marchi's method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--High power. Section of lumbar cord showing\r\nnormal cells in lateral group of right anterior horn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--High power. Section of lumbar cord showing focal\r\ndegeneration and absence of cells in lateral group of left anterior\r\nhorn.]\r\n\r\n=Peripheral Nerves.=--The sheaths of the large nerves as well as those\r\nof the vessels are very often invaded by hemorrhage. The extravasated\r\nblood is found to lie around but rarely among the nerve fibres, which do\r\nnot show any pathological alteration. Ingier is one of the very few to\r\ndescribe a degeneration of the nerve fibres. In one guinea-pig in which\r\nscurvy was induced she found \"many marked degenerated fibrillar bundles\r\nof both sciatic and peroneal nerves, slight degeneration of the phrenic\r\nnerves and one vagus and its cardiac branch.\" Another animal is referred\r\nto as having shown \"very marked and well-developed degeneration of the\r\nnerves of the lower extremities.\" It is open to question whether\r\nstarvation played a rôle in the causation of these lesions. Schoedel and\r\nNauwerk, and Aschoff and Koch examined these nerves but failed to find\r\nany lesions; the latter directed their attention especially to the vagus\r\nof twenty-two cases.\r\n\r\n=Retinal hemorrhages= were found by Jacobsthal, and by Kitamura, who\r\nrecords \"decided edema of the retina, marked bleeding and circumscribed\r\nhypertrophy of the nerve fibres\" such as is found in albuminuric\r\nretinitis. These changes are considered again under the symptomatology\r\nof scurvy.\r\n\r\n=Bones.=--Our knowledge of the minute pathology of the bones is far more\r\ncomplete and detailed than that of any other structure. This was to be\r\nexpected in view of the fact that this is the only tissue in which the\r\nlesions are diagnostic. In considering the microscopic pathology it must\r\nbe remembered that all the bones are rarely affected by scurvy, and that\r\nthose that are involved show the scorbutic changes to a varying degree.\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the lesion is that it involves the end of\r\nthe diaphysis or rather the junction of the diaphysis and the cartilage.\r\nThe bones most apt to show typical changes are the ribs; we shall\r\ntherefore describe a section made through a costochondral junction.\r\n\r\nThe costochondral junction is generally swollen, somewhat beaded, and\r\nwhen cut longitudinally shows on gross examination a transverse\r\nyellowish bar, corresponding to the area of disorganization which will\r\nbe described below. Under the microscope the line of juncture is not\r\nsharp and straight as is normally the case, but presents a wavy or\r\nirregular contour, the cartilage jutting into the bony end of the rib,\r\ninstead of abutting in neat apposition to it. The bone is hollowed out\r\nand irregularly concave, whereas the cartilage presents a convex\r\nappearance. At the site of the junction is the _Truemmerfeld area_,\r\nwhere the normal tissue is splintered and fragmented. Everything in a\r\nstate of disorder--trabeculæ of bone of various shapes and sizes lie\r\nscattered about, the cells irregularly arranged and much distorted,\r\nsigns of recent hemorrhage, unrecognizable detritus. The picture is that\r\nof weakened bone having been crushed by the pressure of the more compact\r\ncartilage. Higher magnification shows that there are few osteoblasts\r\n(generally associated with the deeper fragments of bone), a varying\r\nnumber of intact red cells, according to the occurrence of hemorrhage,\r\nand occasional spindle- and star-shaped connective-tissue cells.\r\nCovering this mass of detritus there is frequently, as Aschoff and Koch\r\nhave emphasized, more or less protective fibrin which has undergone some\r\nhyaline or connective-tissue organization.\r\n\r\nThe cartilage is also not normal. Its cells do not present an orderly\r\narrangement, the proliferating columns having disappeared in the central\r\nconvex portion, and being present to a varying extent near the\r\nperiosteal borders. If we judge from sections of early scurvy in\r\nguinea-pigs, this disturbance of the columnar formation of the\r\nproliferating cartilage is one of the early signs of scurvy, and is\r\nassociated with an unevenness and irregularity in shape and size of the\r\nbone trabeculæ. In young individuals, where cartilage activity is great,\r\nthese changes are most marked and the entire zone of active cells may be\r\nsomewhat widened.\r\n\r\nBelow the Truemmerfeld is the _Geruestmark or framework marrow_, another\r\ndistinguishing feature of scurvy. This extends for about 5 to 10 mm.\r\ntoward the lymphoid marrow, where it ends more or less abruptly. It is\r\ncomposed of a loosely-constructed fibrillar tissue on a\r\ngelatinous-appearing groundwork, of sparsely scattered cells, and bony\r\ntrabeculæ which are markedly thin and weak. Here and there are\r\nhemorrhages and blood pigment, especially adjacent to the\r\n\"Truemmerfeld.\" Another feature which strikes one at first glance is\r\nthat the entire marrow area is incompletely filled by the thin and\r\ngreatly-depleted trabeculæ of the spongiosa. The question has been\r\nraised whether this rarification is to be considered entirely of\r\nscorbutic origin. It is due evidently to a lack of function of the\r\nosteoblasts, which are diminished in number, and are represented by a\r\nlayer of shrivelled spindle cells along the walls of the atrophied bony\r\ncolumns. They may fail almost entirely, as may its osteoid border, which\r\nis significant of active bone tissue. The lack of bony structure and\r\nrarification clearly is not due to an increase in the number or the\r\nfunction of the osteoclasts, for these do not appear in excess. It is\r\nmainly the result of normal bone resorption with a lack of normal bone\r\nregeneration. Aschoff and Koch suggest that the framework marrow may be\r\nable to manufacture bone, but cannot accomplish this because there is a\r\nlack of material from which to make osteoid tissue. This, they believe,\r\nconstitutes the primary deficiency--a lack or faulty development of\r\ncement substance, which in turn may depend on an alteration of colloid\r\nmaterial. Regarded in this light, the lesions of the bones resulting in\r\nfracture and those of the blood-vessels resulting in rupture and\r\nhemorrhage are dependent on a deficiency of the same basic material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Infantile scurvy. Epiphyseal junction of lower\r\nend of femur: (a) calcified cartilage at \"Truemmerfeld\"; (b) hemorrhage\r\nin the fibrous marrow (Gernest-mark). Bone cortex and trabeculae\r\nabnormally thin. McCallums' Text Book of Pathology. W. B. Saunders Co.]\r\n\r\nHemorrhage occurs in the bone as elsewhere; it is almost never lacking.\r\nIt appears either as large hemorrhages in the spongiosa, especially\r\nwhere the normal marrow joins either the Geruestmark or the\r\nTruemmerfeld, or merely as scattered cells, possibly the result of\r\ndiapedesis. The blood-vessels in these areas are narrow and extremely\r\nthin-walled. The most typical site of hemorrhage is beneath the\r\nperiosteum, a lesion widely known on account of its clinical\r\nsignificance (Fig. 16). Here the blood may extend for a considerable\r\ndistance along the shaft, but rarely beyond the epiphyseal line. The\r\nclot forms readily, demonstrating that the nature of the hemorrhage is\r\nnot a defect in coagulation, and in its midst may be seen fibrin,\r\npigment, granulation tissue, and more or less firm connective\r\ntissue--constituting the callus. The inner surface of the periosteum is\r\nfrequently lined with newly-formed bone and with a more or less dense\r\ndeposition of lime salts, which becomes heavier in the course of the\r\nhealing process, and is readily observed in radiographs. This\r\nperiostitis ossificans may result in the clot being surrounded by a\r\nperfect shell of bone, with bony columns penetrating the deeper layers.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the lack of bone formation and the consequent weakening\r\nof the corticalis and the spongiosa, frequently a separation of the\r\ndiaphysis from the epiphysis results. This lesion should not be regarded\r\nas a true separation, for, as Barlow pointed out, the line of cleavage\r\nis not at the junction, but below it, involving the uppermost region of\r\nthe diaphysis. It is therefore correct to speak of a fracture or\r\ninfraction. This lesion is generally accompanied by a deformity of the\r\nsurface contour of the junction, due to a displacement of the cartilage,\r\nas a result of which \"angular beading\" of the rib is brought about. In\r\nsome instances the cartilage is \"telescoped\" into the crushed end of the\r\nbone. To a varying extent fibrin covers the end of the fractured bone;\r\nthe angles adjacent to the periosteum contain blood which becomes\r\norganized into dense connective tissue, thus serving as a splint for\r\nthe fractured parts. In the course of healing a large number of foreign\r\nbody giant-cells appear, blood-vessels sprout from the periosteum as\r\nwell as the bony surface, and the necrosed tissue gives place to an\r\nactive formation of callus, which generally leads to complete\r\nregeneration and restitution. It is remarkable how quickly and perfectly\r\nan epiphysis may become reunited to its shaft (Figs. 6 and 7).\r\nSometimes, however, this takes place with resulting deformity, as in the\r\ndevelopment of coxa vara of the femur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Posterior-anterior view of shoulder of infant\r\n(R. S.) 17 months old. Severe scurvy. Subperiosteal hemorrhage of\r\nhumerus, and separation of upper epiphysis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Anterior-posterior view of same shoulder (see\r\nfig. 6) 22 months later. Complete restitution of epiphysis without\r\ndeformity of humerus.]\r\n\r\nAs Czerny and Keller have stated, it is difficult to define sharply the\r\nrelation of bone fragility to scurvy. Histologically there is great\r\nsimilarity between the \"osteotabes infantum\" described by Ziegler and\r\nconditions sometimes found in infantile scurvy. The main distinction is\r\nthat in the latter disorder the lesion is less generally distributed\r\nthroughout the skeleton, and is particularly marked in a limited area of\r\nthe bones (epiphyses). In considering this question it should be borne\r\nin mind that, experimentally, osteoporosis and scurvy can be brought\r\nabout by diets which are absolutely dissimilar. For example, Bartenstein\r\nshowed that young guinea-pigs develop osteoporosis and multiple\r\nfractures on a diet of raw milk containing an adequate quota of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine.\r\n\r\n=Rickets= and infantile scurvy are commonly found associated, although\r\nthey bear no causal relationship to each other. The distinctive\r\ncharacteristic of rickets is the broad area of osteoid tissue which is\r\nformed at the epiphyseal junction, a broad band of incompletely\r\ncalcified cartilage not found in scurvy. In the latter disease\r\nosteoblastic bone growth is greatly inhibited, but what growth does take\r\nplace occurs in a normal and orderly manner. The osteophytes, for\r\nexample, which so commonly develop at right angles to the axis of the\r\nbone in the subperiosteal hemorrhages, are composed of apparently normal\r\nbone. Another marked distinction between the two conditions is the\r\npaucity of blood-vessels in the cartilaginous area and in the marrow in\r\nscurvy, compared with the increased vascularity so generally encountered\r\nin rickets. It is evident, therefore, that although these two\r\nnutritional disorders bear a superficial resemblance to each other\r\npathologically, they are radically different and almost antithetical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL SCURVY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no mention whatsoever of scurvy in animals previous to 1895,\r\nwhen Theobald Smith wrote: \"When guinea-pigs are fed with cereal (it has\r\nbeen observed for some years in this laboratory), with bran and oats\r\nmixed, without any grass, clover, or succulent vegetable, such as\r\ncabbage, a peculiar disease, chiefly recognizable by subcutaneous\r\nextravasations of blood, carries them off in from four to eight weeks.\"\r\nSmith did not pursue the subject further.\r\n\r\nCoincident with the appreciation of the value of experimental methods,\r\none would have expected attempts to produce scurvy in animals. The\r\ndisorder had been recognized for a great many years, the fact that it\r\nwas occasioned by a dietary deficient in fresh food was widely known, so\r\nthat it would seem natural for clinicians or laboratory workers to have\r\ntried to induce the disease in animals by a similar restricted diet.\r\nThere is, however, no suggestion of such an experiment in the voluminous\r\nliterature on scurvy. The explanation of the neglect of an experimental\r\nstudy of scurvy appears to be that this was considered a disorder which\r\nrequired little investigation--its etiology, its prevention and its cure\r\nseemed thoroughly understood. It is strange that the mere fact that such\r\na severe disturbance responded, as if by magic, to the administration of\r\nsimple foodstuffs should not have awakened curiosity as well as wonder,\r\nand stimulated inquiry into the nature and significance of the curative\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 Bolle published the results of experiments on guinea-pigs which\r\nhad been fed for various periods on raw or sterilized milk. He reported\r\nthat the animals developed a marked fragility of the bones, varying in\r\nintensity in proportion to the degree of heat to which the milk had been\r\nsubjected. These changes Bolle interpreted as typical scurvy, but it is\r\ndifficult to decide whether the disorder was actually true scurvy, in\r\nview of the indefinite description of the bone lesions.\r\n\r\nBartenstein repeated Bolle's work and described in detail the changes in\r\nthe bones. From his work we learned that it was of little moment whether\r\nthe animals were fed raw or sterilized milk--their nutrition failed\r\nwithin about the same length of time, and they died within a month. The\r\nchief pathologic change was a marked fragility of the bones, leading to\r\nspontaneous fractures, or to breaking of the bones in the course of\r\nordinary manipulation. Bartenstein described the disorder as \"beginning\r\nwith the degeneration of the marrow, and secondarily leading to an\r\natrophy of the bone due to increased absorption and deficient new\r\nformation of bone, especially at the endochondral lines of ossification.\r\nAs the result of the osteoporosis, spontaneous fractures occur without\r\nnoticeable hemorrhagic diathesis.\" He found a deficiency of calcium in\r\nthe bones of animals suffering from even a mild degree of this disorder.\r\nHart and Lessing are of the opinion that we cannot accept Bartenstein's\r\ndiagnosis of scurvy. They compare this disorder to that described by\r\nZiegler as \"osteotabes infantum,\" in which there is a more or less\r\npronounced \"jelly marrow\" which has replaced the lymphoid cells in\r\nscattered areas. They sum up their analysis of the question with the\r\nstatement that \"the primary marrow changes in the diaphysis, the marked\r\nlacunar absorption by osteoclasts, the absence of subperiosteal\r\nhemorrhages, do not indicate typical scurvy.\" Schmorl produced\r\ncomparable lesions in dogs and came to the conclusion that the disorder\r\nwas one \"very similar\" to scurvy but not identical with it, the\r\nessential difference being that in all animals there was a most marked\r\nabsorption of bone by osteoclasts.\r\n\r\nSimilar results were obtained by others. In 1904 Peiper and Eichloff\r\nattempted to produce scurvy in dogs by means of a diet composed\r\nexclusively of raw or of sterilized milk. The following year we find a\r\nreport by Esser of feeding goats on sterilized milk. None of these\r\nstudies hits the mark; a condition of fragilitas ossium was produced\r\nrather than typical scurvy.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the first systematic and convincing experimental study of scurvy\r\nappeared. In this year Holst and Froelich published a preliminary\r\naccount of their classic work, undertaken in an endeavor to fathom the\r\nnature of \"ship beriberi,\" a disorder which disabled so many of the\r\nsailors in the Norwegian navy. We must remember that until recently\r\nattention has been focussed on the infectious diseases, and little\r\nthought given to the investigation of nutritional disorders. Although\r\nexperimental investigation in this field may be stated to have been\r\ninitiated by this work, it in turn had been stimulated by a conception\r\nof dietary diseases which had just begun to be realized. This new\r\nviewpoint was the result of the work of Eijkman. As has been mentioned\r\nin considering the pathogenesis of human scurvy, Eijkman demonstrated\r\nthat hens developed polyneuritis, a disease resembling beriberi, when\r\nfed on polished rice, and that the simple change to a diet of unpolished\r\nrice, or the addition of rice polishings to the dietary, sufficed to\r\nprotect or to cure. This work had been repeated and substantiated. It\r\nwas evident to those who considered the question that the old lines of\r\nthought in regard to food and dietetics inadequately explained\r\nremarkable phenomena of this kind. It was also clear that nutritional\r\ndisorders were subject to experimental investigation in a way similar to\r\nthe infectious diseases, which were absorbing the interest of the\r\nvarious laboratories. It is unnecessary to review the rapid rise of\r\ninvestigative work in this field. It may be stated, in general, that\r\nduring the past few years the investigations of scurvy have become so\r\nnumerous that an established research technic may be said to have\r\ndeveloped in connection with its study.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to produce scurvy in various animals, but it has\r\nbeen brought about regularly only in the guinea-pig and in the monkey.\r\nExperiments on the dog are as yet too few to justify our regarding this\r\nanimal as definitely available for this study. The nutrition of rats,\r\nmice, rabbits, hogs, pigeons, fowl, receiving a diet identical with that\r\nwhich regularly occasions scurvy in guinea-pigs, either progresses\r\nnormally or a state of malnutrition develops which cannot be identified\r\nwith scurvy. Recently Hart, Steenbock and Smith have reported that\r\ncattle can be reared to maturity on a diet which will produce scurvy in\r\nthe guinea-pig in four to five weeks. We are therefore confronted with\r\nthe remarkable and inexplicable phenomenon, a fact concurred in by\r\nalmost all investigators, that a diet induces either normal nutrition or\r\nmalnutrition, according to the experimental animal employed. A diet of\r\npolished rice, or other decorticated grain, will lead to the development\r\nof scurvy in the guinea-pig, to polyneuritis in the pigeon or fowl, or,\r\naccording to Holst and Froelich, to a combination of these disorders in\r\nthe hog.[35] The basis of these divergent results cannot be surmised,\r\nand is worthy of the most thorough investigation. It may well be that\r\nthe elucidation of this problem--for example, why we are able to bring\r\nabout scurvy in the guinea-pig but not in the rabbit, will shed light on\r\nthe pathogenesis of this disorder. Are we to conclude that some of these\r\nanimals have the power to synthesize the vitamine whereas others must\r\ndepend upon the food for it, or are we to presuppose an ability to\r\nmaintain normal life and function without any or with a minimal amount\r\nof this vitamine? The difference between these two groups, the\r\nsusceptible and non-susceptible animals, probably is not as absolute as\r\nwe have been wont to regard it. Recently Harden and Zilva have shown\r\nthat although rats are able to thrive on a diet free from antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine, they show an appreciable gain in weight when this factor is\r\nadded to the dietary. If such be proved to be the case, we must regard\r\nthe non-susceptibility of the rat, the rabbit, etc., as relative rather\r\nthan absolute.\r\n\r\n[35] Hogs fed on 1.5 kg. of rye bread and 0.5 kg. of meat heated to 100°\r\nor 110° C. for a half hour showed the hemorrhages, loosening of the\r\nteeth and affections of the gums characteristic of scurvy, as well as\r\nthe paralysis and neuritis typical of polyneuritis.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a doubt has been raised as to whether we should accept\r\nguinea-pig scurvy as the counterpart of human scurvy. This question can\r\nbe answered only by comparing the disorder in the one species with that\r\nin the other--as to mode of production, pathology, symptomatology, means\r\nof cure and all other phenomena. Viewed from these standpoints it is\r\nfound that in almost every respect the disorder is identical in man and\r\nin the guinea-pig. The outstanding distinction is the difference in the\r\nlength of time elapsing before the development of symptoms. In the child\r\nor in the adult it takes about six months of the deficient diet before\r\nclinical symptoms are manifest and a diagnosis can be established; in\r\nthe guinea-pig the disorder can be recognized two weeks after\r\nrestricting the diet. In the one instance we seem to be dealing with a\r\nnutritional disorder which is chronic or at least subacute, and in the\r\nother with a markedly acute condition. This distinction is open,\r\nhowever, to certain qualifications. In the first place, we must consider\r\nthe duration of life of the two species, the comparatively short span of\r\nthe guinea-pig compared with that of man. It must be borne in mind,\r\nfurthermore, that the guinea-pig is placed on a diet absolutely devoid\r\nof all antiscorbutic vitamine, whereas this rarely obtains in human\r\nbeings. For example, the diet which is most markedly scorbutic for\r\ninfants is the \"malt soup\" previously mentioned, but even this food\r\ncontains an amount of the antiscorbutic factor which is not negligible.\r\nBut after taking these differences into consideration, it is\r\nnevertheless evident that the guinea-pig is far more sensitive to scurvy\r\nthan man. This does not indicate that the guinea-pig is an unsuitable\r\nexperimental animal, any more than the fact that the pigeon is more\r\nsusceptible to polyneuritis than man indicates that it is unsuited to\r\ninvestigations of beriberi. It merely prevents our carrying out delicate\r\nquantitative experiments, and cautions against drawing too finely-spun\r\ndeductions. In all nutritional investigations it should never be\r\nforgotten that conclusions drawn from experiments on animals are merely\r\nprovisional, and must await substantiation on man, and, furthermore,\r\nthat where differences in reaction are noted, the clinical data should\r\nbe accorded full consideration.\r\n\r\n=Pathogenesis of Guinea-pig Scurvy.=--From a pathogenetic point of view\r\nguinea-pig scurvy and human scurvy show remarkable points in common. Any\r\ndiet that leads to the development of scurvy in man likewise brings it\r\nabout in the guinea-pig, and contrariwise, any food which cures the\r\ndisorder has the same beneficent effect on both species. This similarity\r\nextends so far that, as will be shown in the chapter on antiscorbutics,\r\nthe relative potency of the various foods is approximately the same for\r\nman and for the guinea-pig. The parallelism generally is striking. The\r\ndietary which has been commonly employed in experimental scurvy has been\r\nthat first suggested by Holst and Froelich, namely, oats, hay and water.\r\nRecently, however, this dietary has been enlarged in order to make it\r\nmore complete, so as to include adequate protein, water-soluble and\r\nfat-soluble vitamine, and inorganic salts. To this end the group of\r\nworkers at the Lister Institute (Chick and co-workers, Harden and Zilva)\r\nplace their animals on a basal diet of one part of crushed oats and two\r\nof wheaten bran, and a daily ration of 50 to 60 c.c. of milk autoclaved\r\nfor one hour at 120° C. This milk still retains a small amount of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine. Cohen and Mendel have employed, apparently with\r\ngood result, a \"soy bean cracker,\" containing soy bean flour which has\r\nbeen heated for 30 minutes at 15 pounds' pressure (120° C.), 3 per cent.\r\nof sodium chloride, the same percentage of calcium lactate and of dried\r\nbrewers' yeast, and raw milk sufficient to supply 5 per cent. of\r\nbutter-fat.\r\n\r\nThe use of raw milk was introduced by Jackson and Moore, and adopted by\r\nMcCollum and Pitz and again by Pitz in a series of interesting\r\nexperiments. The milk was given _ad libitum_. The results of these\r\ninvestigations were puzzling at first, until it was shown by Chick, Hume\r\nand Skelton that the dietary on which they were based contained a\r\nfundamental error which accounted for their lack of consistence.\r\nAlthough milk is not rich in the antiscorbutic factor, it possesses it\r\nin moderate degree, so that the outcome will be quite different\r\naccording to whether a guinea-pig takes, for example, 50 c.c. or 100\r\nc.c. daily. It is quite evident, therefore, that a food of this kind\r\ncannot be offered _ad libitum_, and that if this rule is not observed,\r\nmost disconcerting results will follow.[36] This basic error in framing\r\nthe dietary has made it impossible to accept the deductions of these\r\nauthors. The conclusions of McCollum and Pitz are so striking and have\r\nled to such wide discussion, that they require consideration, in spite\r\nof the fact that the error in the dietary is now recognized. These\r\nauthors found that the cæcum of their animals was greatly distended with\r\nputrefying fæces. As the cæcum is extraordinarily large and delicate in\r\nthis species, they drew the deduction that the development of scurvy in\r\nthe guinea-pig was due principally to the retention of fæces. \"An\r\nimpacted cæcum, the seat of putrefaction, may cause injury to the cæcal\r\nwall, sufficient to permit the invasion of the tissues by bacteria, or\r\nthe animals may perhaps be injured primarily by the absorption of toxic\r\nproducts of bacterial origin.\" Accessory dietary factors or vitamines,\r\naccording to this theory, are supposed to play no part in the disorder,\r\nand antiscorbutics, such as orange juice, are considered to owe their\r\nefficacy mainly to their laxative properties, and to be replaceable by\r\nother laxatives such as phenolphthalein or oleum petrolatum. The\r\nefficacy of orange juice is supposed to be due to its content of\r\ncitrates, and to be replaceable by what was termed \"artificial orange\r\njuice,\" a mixture composed of the various salts, citric acid and\r\nsucrose, in the proportions in which they are found in the natural\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n[36] A guinea-pig requires about 80 to 100 c.c. of fresh milk per diem\r\nto protect it from manifest scurvy, if this constitutes its sole\r\nantiscorbutic quota. There is, however, a great difference in the amount\r\nof milk which individual animals consume, so that if we furnish it _ad\r\nlibitum_ our results will be irregular, one animal developing scurvy and\r\nanother remaining well, according to individual appetite. Frequently\r\nguinea-pigs take very little milk at first, learning gradually to drink\r\nmore and more, so that it comes to pass that only after some weeks, if\r\nat all, they take sufficient to afford protection. Under these\r\ncircumstances, if any addition is made to the dietary after the\r\nexperiment has progressed, the lack of development or cure of the scurvy\r\nmay mistakenly be attributed to this newly introduced factor, whereas,\r\nin point of fact, it is due to an increased consumption of milk.\r\n\r\nThese reports stimulated renewed interest in experimental scurvy,\r\nsuggesting new aspects, and therefore directing attention to points\r\nrequiring investigation. There were no data at hand on the consistency\r\nof the contents of the bowel in guinea-pigs, so that it was necessary to\r\nmake appropriate observations in normal and in scorbutic animals. It\r\nwas soon reported by various workers, Rappleye, Cohen and Mendel, Hess\r\nand Unger, and others, that there was no definite relationship between\r\nthe occurrence of scurvy and impaction of the cæcum. In Fig. 8 we see\r\nportrayed the stool output of a guinea-pig during the period in which it\r\nwas developing scurvy, and during a subsequent period when it was being\r\ncured by means of orange juice. It is clear that there was no\r\nsignificant variation in the output during these divergent periods. A\r\nsimilar conclusion was arrived at by those who examined the cæcums of\r\nanimals postmortem. Cohen and Mendel write: \"Summarizing our experience\r\nwith nearly one hundred scorbutic animals, we conclude that actual\r\nimpaction of the fæces in the cæcum occurred in about one-quarter of the\r\ncases, and visible damage to wall, _i.e._, congestion or hemorrhage, or\r\nimpaction, or both, was found in perhaps half of the cases. It should be\r\nnoted that this statement covers all the diets we have tried.\" We concur\r\nin this conclusion. Not infrequently we found the cæcums of markedly\r\nscorbutic pigs to contain semi-fluid fæces, the consistency of its\r\ncontents depending on the character of the diet, quite apart from its\r\nadequacy and lack of the antiscorbutic factor. For example, a diet rich\r\nin milk, containing 100 c.c. or more, led to the formation of rather\r\nsolid fæces; if oats were added to the milk diet the fæces in the cæcum\r\nwere found to be still more solid, and this portion of the gut more\r\noften impacted. This condition could be detected by palpation even\r\nduring life. Just as we encountered scorbutic animals on an oat, hay and\r\nwater diet, who had semi-fluid fæces in the cæcums, so we met with\r\nothers which were on a milk diet, and showed no signs of scurvy,\r\nalthough their cæcums were impacted with fæces of a putty-like\r\nconsistence. Guinea-pigs do not seem to be able to tolerate a diet\r\ncontaining a large quantity of the fat of cow's milk. Such a diet leads\r\nto impaction of the large intestine resulting in death, but does not\r\ninduce scurvy. Jackson and Moore produced a condition of this kind by\r\nfeeding pigs with cream containing 26 to 28 per cent. fat. \"In every\r\ncase,\" they write, \"the large intestine was distended with light\r\nmustard-colored semi-solid fæces.\" This pathological condition is not\r\nunderstood, but is quite distinct from scurvy, and remarkable in view of\r\nthe fact that the milk of the guinea-pig contains as high as 25 per\r\ncent. of fat. It is an interesting illustration of the marked biological\r\ndifference in the butter-fat of various species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Shows a period with the development of scurvy,\r\nand one where it was cured by giving orange juice. It will be noted that\r\nthere was no marked constipation while the animal had scurvy. During a\r\nperiod of a few days the amount of stool was scanty, corresponding to\r\nthe decreased intake of oats and hay on the days preceding. Broken line\r\nrepresents clinical course of scurvy.]\r\n\r\nNor was it found, as McCollum and Pitz claimed, that antiscorbutics were\r\nreplaceable by laxatives in the diet. Without entering into the details\r\nof this aspect of the subject, which will be considered in the chapter\r\non symptomatology, it may be stated that attempts to prevent the\r\noccurrence of scurvy or to cure it by means of laxatives invariably\r\nfailed. Chick, Hume and Skelton, as well as Hess and Unger, gave oleum\r\npetrolatum to a series of pigs without the slightest favorable effect.\r\nHart, Steenbock and Smith recently reported that they had administered 1\r\nc.c. of this oil on alternate days to one series of pigs, and 2 mg. of\r\nphenolphthalein on alternate days to another series, without relieving\r\nthe scurvy. Cohen and Mendel, in order to test the adequacy of their\r\ndiet as to roughage, supplemented it with additions of considerable\r\nfilter paper and sawdust, \"without averting the appearance of scurvy.\"\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that constipation does not play an essential\r\nrôle in the pathogenesis of scurvy in the guinea-pig, and that\r\nantiscorbutics are by no means synonymous or interchangeable with\r\nlaxatives. These results accord with observations on infantile scurvy.\r\n\r\n=The Pathology.=--The pathology of guinea-pig scurvy is essentially that\r\nof human scurvy. Hemorrhages and separations of the epiphyses or\r\nfractures of the long bones dominate the macroscopic picture. The\r\nhemorrhages are found rarely in the gums, but are common about the\r\njoints, in the muscles of the jaw or in those of the hind legs. They may\r\nbe subcutaneous and appear as bluish discolorations at various parts of\r\nthe body, especially if the disorder has resulted in death or if\r\ninfection has been superadded. On stripping the skin we often note\r\nhemorrhages in the intercostal muscles, and beading of the ribs at the\r\nsite of the costochondral junctions, least marked in the upper and in\r\nthe floating ribs. This has been frequently described in connection with\r\nguinea-pig scurvy; its similarity to the rosary of human rickets has\r\nbeen drawn attention to recently by Jackson and Moore. It should not be\r\nregarded as \"pseudo-rhachitic,\" but as typically scorbutic, from a\r\nmicroscopic as well as a macroscopic viewpoint. On closer examination a\r\nyellowish-white transverse line may be seen at the epiphyseal junction\r\nof the ribs, and frequently some subperiosteal hemorrhage. Beading of\r\nthis character has been reported by Ingier also in the \"snuffles\" of\r\nhogs and as the result of trauma. A similar enlargement of the chondral\r\njunctions of the sternum may be found on examining its posterior\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n_The joints_ of the body always show some changes. The epiphyses are\r\nenlarged to a variable degree, resembling the epiphyses typical of human\r\nrickets. As in infants, this change is met with most commonly at the\r\nwrist joint, involving the ulna and the radius. The knee-joint is\r\nlikewise often involved, especially the ends of the tibia; the elbow,\r\nankle, and the shoulder may also show an articular swelling of the\r\nbones. About these joints hemorrhages in the subcutaneous tissues may be\r\nseen, or edema extending along the extremities. Not infrequently a\r\nfracture of one of the long bones is found, which may or may not have\r\nbeen diagnosed during life. The common site of fracture is the lower\r\npart of the tibia or fibula. Much more frequent than fractures are\r\nseparations of the epiphyses, which long since have been recognized as\r\ntypical of infantile scurvy. Even gentle handling in the course of\r\nperforming the necropsy may occasion a lesion of this kind--of the tibia\r\nat the knee, of the radius or ulna at the wrist, or indeed at any of the\r\nepiphyseal junctions. The infracted ends occasionally may be seen held\r\ninsecurely by a delicate band of periosteum. The shafts of the bones are\r\nbrittle, rarefied, and easily broken.\r\n\r\nOn opening _the chest_, slight hemorrhages may be noted in the\r\npericardium and in the visceral and costal pleuræ. The heart is\r\nfrequently enlarged, and the pericardial sac contains an excess of\r\nserum; the right ventricle, however, is not found disproportionately\r\nhypertrophied. Pneumonia is met with very frequently and constitutes a\r\ncommon terminal infection.\r\n\r\nOn opening _the abdomen_ we may note subperitoneal hemorrhages of the\r\nmuscular wall or of the coils of intestine. The liver and spleen are\r\ngenerally normal, as is the pancreas. The kidney frequently shows minute\r\nhemorrhages beneath the capsule and on section.\r\n\r\n_The adrenals_ not infrequently are large. This fact was first brought\r\nout by Rondoni and Montagnani, and is of added interest in view of its\r\nconfirmation by McCarrison as well as by LaMer and Campbell. Its\r\nsignificance is discussed at length in the consideration of the adrenal\r\ngland in human scurvy. In view of the fact that fasting leads to a\r\nsimilar hypertrophy, and that guinea-pig scurvy frequently is\r\ncomplicated by fasting, these observations should be extended. In all\r\ninvestigations of this kind, bacterial cultures should be taken of the\r\nadrenals, or other organs, to be certain that there is no complicating\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThere have been no reports as to the effect of scurvy on the size of the\r\ntesticles, ovary, thymus, thyroid or parathyroid glands in the\r\nguinea-pig, such as have been made by McCarrison in relation to avian\r\npolyneuritis.\r\n\r\n_The alimentary tract_ occasionally shows macroscopic changes similar to\r\nthe lesions found in man. The entire canal is frequently very empty,\r\nespecially the stomach and the small intestine, due to the lack of\r\nappetite for some days previous to death. In the stomach we may find\r\nareas of congestion or numerous small superficial ulcers surrounded by\r\ncongestion and covered with mucus; occasionally these ulcers are\r\nsomewhat larger and deeper. The larger ulcers are more frequently\r\nsituated in the first part of the duodenum, often proximal to the\r\npapilla of Vater. Holst and Froelich described this lesion in one of\r\ntheir early communications. More common than ulceration of the duodenum\r\nis a diffuse congestion of its upper part. This lesion is of note\r\nbecause it has been described frequently in the protocols of human\r\nnecropsies, and is found in beriberi, in avian polyneuritis, and in\r\npellagra in man. Its significance is unknown, and has indeed never been\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nLower down in the bowel there are occasionally areas of congestion and\r\nulceration, but no section seems particularly predisposed to these\r\nlesions. The contents of the bowel, especially of the cæcum, as\r\nmentioned above, depend more on the character of the food than on the\r\nexistence of scurvy. If the diet has consisted of milk and oats, the\r\ncæcum will be found full and perhaps impacted, whereas if hay and oats\r\nhave been fed, the cæcum will be less full and its contents semisolid.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that many of the animals have taken very little food\r\nfor some days previous to their death, it will be well to describe\r\nbriefly the macroscopic picture of _simple starvation_ in guinea-pigs.\r\nWhen guinea-pigs are given only water they live about one week; if\r\norange juice is added to this water diet they succumb a little later to\r\nstarvation. Under all these conditions the striking pathologic\r\nchange--absent in scurvy--is edema. It is true that the limbs may show\r\nslight edema in scurvy, and that the pericardial and the pleural sacs,\r\nand even the peritoneal cavity, occasionally contain a small quantity of\r\nserum, but it is comparatively an insignificant amount. Moreover it is\r\ndifficult to decide to what extent this edema is due to scurvy, and to\r\nwhat extent to starvation. In typical starvation, on the other hand,\r\nsuch as occurs on the limited diets enumerated above, we find marked\r\nsubcutaneous edema, sometimes a true anasarca, and frequently also\r\nascites. We are reminded of the \"war edema\" and its frequent association\r\nwith starvation. Another distinction between the two conditions is the\r\nfact that the marrow in starvation is yellow and not red as in scurvy.\r\nIn passing, it may be mentioned that the ascites was greater when orange\r\njuice had been given than where the animal received only water.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the literature but one study has been noted on _the effect\r\nof a scorbutic diet on the foetus_. This investigation was carried out\r\non a large series of guinea-pigs by Ingier (1915). The following\r\ncomprise her conclusions:\r\n\r\n\"1. Pronounced cases of Barlow's disease may be produced in the foetus\r\nas early as ten to fifteen days after the commencement of dieting\r\npregnant guinea-pigs with oats and water. There are wide individual\r\nvariations. The scorbutic changes in the skeleton are greatest in the\r\nearlier embryonic stages. The foetuses of that period, with\r\npractically no exceptions, die and show marked traces of impeded growth.\r\n\r\n\"2. Foetuses from the later period of pregnancy are born alive, and\r\napparently fully developed, with comparatively slight changes in the\r\nosseous system.\r\n\r\n\"3. Even a short extension of the period of extra-uterine dieting on\r\nmilk from scorbutic mothers, and later on oats and water, is sufficient\r\nto change the latent scurvy into a highly-pronounced case.\r\n\r\n\"4. The foetus cannot be kept alive longer than the adult animal,\r\nabout twenty-eight days, either by intra-uterine dieting alone or by\r\ncombined intra- and extra-uterine dieting.\r\n\r\n\"5. The mothers show signs of the disease at an early period and are\r\nmore severely attacked than non-pregnant animals. Death also occurs\r\ncomparatively often in the first period of gestation.\"\r\n\r\nIn these experiments intra-uterine fractures, premature births and\r\nstill-born litters are frequently mentioned. This suggests naturally an\r\ninquiry as to whether similar occurrences have been observed in human\r\nscurvy. In considering the pathogenesis of human scurvy, we have\r\nremarked on the meagreness of the data on this most interesting aspect\r\nof this disorder. In view of the similarity between human and guinea-pig\r\nscurvy, we should expect not only miscarriages and still-births to\r\nresult, but cases of congenital scurvy, especially of the latent or\r\nrudimentary type.\r\n\r\n=Scurvy Has Been Induced Also in the Monkey.=--The most extensive\r\ninvestigation of this kind is that of Hart and Lessing, who brought\r\nabout scurvy in several young Macaci Rhesi which had been fed for some\r\nmonths on boiled condensed milk with the addition of cooked rice and\r\npig-nuts. Typical scurvy resulted in all but one instance, and in this\r\ncase an old animal was used and a different pathological picture\r\ndeveloped. These experiments require brief reviewing, as the clinical\r\nsigns and gross pathology in monkeys differ somewhat from those\r\nencountered in guinea-pigs, and particularly as these distinctions\r\nrender scurvy in monkeys and in infants practically identical.\r\n\r\nApart from general listlessness and lack of activity, the first sign is\r\nhemorrhage of the gums, the characteristic sign of infantile scurvy.\r\nThis is stated to be constant; in the guinea-pig it is most exceptional.\r\nAnother sign characteristic of infantile scurvy is the subperiosteal\r\nhemorrhage, which in the guinea-pig may be found as a small effusion\r\nnear one of the larger joints or the costochondral junctions, but in the\r\nmonkey consists of large effusions, similar to those described by\r\nBarlow. Subperiosteal hemorrhages of the cranial bones were constantly\r\nseen, and not infrequently involvement of the scapula and of the\r\nmaxilla. Hemorrhage into the orbit leading to exophthalmos and to\r\nhemorrhagic discoloration of the upper lid--a lesion not infrequent in\r\nhuman scurvy--is also described; in guinea-pigs we have met with\r\nexophthalmos only in two instances. In all other respects scurvy in the\r\nmonkey resembles that in the guinea-pig, even to the extent of the\r\nscorbutic rosary of the lower true ribs. Hart and Lessing describe the\r\npresence of the \"white line\" of Fraenkel, which is referred to at length\r\nin treating of the symptomatology of human scurvy. This is a shadow,\r\nseen by means of the X-ray, traversing the long bones near their\r\nepiphyses--a definite \"shadow band\" associated with a narrow light zone\r\nlying just beneath it. This \"white line\" has been noted likewise by\r\nTalbot, Dodd and Peterson in the scurvy of monkeys.\r\n\r\n=Microscopic Pathology.=--Turning to the microscopic pathology, we find\r\nthat the changes are similar to those described elsewhere in connection\r\nwith human scurvy. It will be unnecessary, therefore, to give more than\r\na general survey of the typical alterations. Little has been added to\r\nthe description of lesions so carefully depicted in the first report of\r\nHolst and Froelich (1907). The bone marrow at the ends of the diaphyses\r\nin proximity to the epiphyseal junction loses its normal lymphoid\r\ncharacter and is replaced by a reticular or fibrillated substance, the\r\nso-called \"framework\" marrow (Geruestmark of Schoedel and Nauwerk)\r\ncontaining a homogeneous mucoid tissue and only a few osteoblasts and\r\nmarrow cells. The number of blood-vessels is considerably reduced and\r\nfresh hemorrhage or blood pigment is frequently seen. The osseous tissue\r\nitself shows marked changes, corresponding to the rarification and\r\nbrittleness noted on gross examination. The osseous trabeculæ are fewer\r\nin number and those which remain are slender and irregular, and\r\nfrequently appear as isolated islets. The cortical substance also\r\nbecomes very thin. There are marked alterations in the intermediate\r\ncartilages, especially of the ribs.[37] Instead of the cells being\r\narranged in orderly rows, they are irregularly placed, and frequently\r\ngreatly reduced in size and number. The bone trabeculæ on which they\r\nabut are not well formed or of equal length, and do not present an even\r\nand transverse plane, but are misshapen, small, so that the line of\r\njunction with the cartilage is zigzag. In cases of marked scurvy the\r\njunction may be entirely disorganized and deformed, showing fractures of\r\nthe rarefied bone and hemorrhages in the neighborhood. This leads\r\nfrequently to a macroscopic deformity of bone, a bulging of the surface\r\nat the costochondral junction--the scorbutic \"beading\" or \"rosary\" of\r\nthe ribs. Recently Delf and Tozer have described these changes,\r\nclassifying them as those occurring in \"incipient,\" \"definite,\" \"acute,\"\r\n\"chronic definite,\" and \"chronic acute\" scurvy. Fig. 9 shows these types\r\nin diagrammatic form. In this figure we see how varied may be the\r\nmanifestations of this nutritional disorder, according to whether it has\r\nexisted for a shorter or a longer time; in some instances the picture is\r\nvery puzzling. The \"incipient scurvy\" corresponds to what we have termed\r\nclinically \"latent scurvy\" in infants, a condition which cannot be\r\ndiagnosed and is manifested merely by a faulty nutrition which responds\r\npromptly to the addition of an antiscorbutic to the diet. There have\r\nbeen no histologic examinations in man at this incipient stage, but we\r\nmay infer that they are similar to the bony changes found in the\r\nguinea-pig. When the scurvy has become chronic in an animal which has\r\nlived for months on a quota of antiscorbutic food sufficient to preserve\r\nlife but insufficient to prevent the development of scurvy, we find a\r\nmicroscopic picture at the costochondral junction differing widely from\r\nthat seen in the acute stage. Not only are the columns of cartilage\r\ncells represented merely by misshapen vestiges, but an ossified band\r\n(Fig. 9) is seen at the junction. It is probable that this is\r\nfrequently the cause of the marked cessation of growth which has been\r\ndescribed in connection with this type of scurvy in infants. Delf and\r\nTozer interpret this ossified band at the junction as \"an attempt to\r\nstrengthen the junction in an abnormal manner, the normal process having\r\nbroken down.\" If the animal is again deprived of antiscorbutic food the\r\nossified band breaks down, the junction becomes deformed and\r\ndisorganized, and a condition of \"chronic scurvy (acute)\" is stated to\r\nhave developed.\r\n\r\n[37] These changes are not found in every specimen, so that in order to\r\nbe able to exclude scurvy definitely, it is necessary to examine a\r\nconsiderable number of ribs; several may be normal, only one or two\r\nshowing the characteristic microscopic changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diagrammatic representation of guinea-pig scurvy\r\n(copied from Delf and Tozer by the courtesy of the Cambridge Press).\r\n\r\n1. Diagram of normal rib-junction.\r\n\r\n2. Diagram of rib-junction to illustrate \"Incipient Scurvy.\" This\r\nrib-junction is very nearly normal, but shows what may be regarded as\r\nthe first recognizable signs of the onset of the disease; these are:\r\n(_a_) An appearance of general abnormality (when compared with the\r\nnormal). (_b_) Unevenness of the junction and slight disorganization of\r\nthe rows of cartilage cells. (_c_) Shortening of the length of the rows\r\nof cartilage cells. (_d_) Shortening, and decrease in number of the\r\ntrabeculæ. (_e_) Increased amount of blood in the marrow cavity.\r\n\r\n3. Diagram of rib-junction to illustrate \"Definite Scurvy.\" Histological\r\nsigns vary considerably in these cases (according to the severity of the\r\ndisease), and may approach in appearance those characteristic of the\r\n\"Acute\" condition. The rows of cartilage cells may be almost normal, but\r\nare more often noticeably shortened and usually somewhat disorganized or\r\narranged in circular groups. The trabeculæ are usually about half the\r\nnormal length and have a truncated appearance. The junction as a whole\r\nmay present an uneven, slightly disorganized appearance and there is\r\nsometimes a certain amount of macroscopic deformity.\r\n\r\n4. Diagram of rib-junction to illustrate \"Acute Scurvy.\" In these cases\r\nthe junction and rows of cartilage cells are often completely\r\ndisorganized, causing a marked macroscopic deformity of the bone. The\r\nbone of the shaft is frequently fractured. The marrow is no longer in\r\ncontact with the edge of the junction and the space is filled with a\r\nmass of connective tissue; this is very characteristic in cases of\r\nfracture. A condition in which the trabeculæ have almost disappeared and\r\nthe rows are much shortened is also found in \"Acute Scurvy,\" in those\r\nribs in which no fracture of the shaft has occurred; usually, however,\r\nthere is little or no ossification across the junction. There is\r\nfrequently hemorrhage into the marrow cavity.\r\n\r\nDiagrams 5 and 6 illustrate types of \"Chronic Scurvy.\"\r\n\r\n5. May be described as \"Chronic Definite Scurvy.\" The rows are much\r\nshortened but not disorganized and an ossified band extends across the\r\njunction.\r\n\r\n6. May be described as \"Acute Chronic Scurvy.\" The junction is deformed,\r\nand the rows are very disorganized; the trabeculæ have disappeared and\r\nan ossified band extends across the junction. There is no connective\r\ntissue to be seen and no existing, or recent, fracture.]\r\n\r\nIt has been noted by many investigators that _changes in the teeth_ take\r\nplace in the course of scurvy. They become somewhat yellow and lose\r\ntheir glistening appearance, and occasionally break off. The molars\r\ncommonly become loosened, so that they can readily be removed from their\r\nalveolar sockets; less frequently this is true of the incisors. Until\r\nrecently, however, this subject has not been studied in detail, and no\r\nsignificant histologic changes in the teeth have been described. Jackson\r\nand Moore showed that with marked changes in the teeth there was often\r\n\"great dilatation of the veins in the pulp attended by more or less\r\nhemorrhage into the pulp,\" and that \"in guinea-pigs fed on oats and hay\r\nthere was almost complete necrosis of the pulp of the incisor teeth,\r\nalso more or less necrosis in the pulp of the molars.\"\r\n\r\nRecently an intensive study of this subject has been made by Zilva and\r\nWells, which is of special interest because it describes the first\r\nbeginnings of these lesions, and particularly because we have no\r\nknowledge whatsoever of the dental changes which occur in human scurvy.\r\nThese investigators found a fibroid degeneration of the pulp of the\r\nteeth, a pulpar fibrosis. \"It is clear at once,\" they write, \"and it is\r\nan important fact that no trace of cellular organization, no trace of\r\ncell nuclei, no trace of interstitial cement substances can be found\r\nanywhere. Nerves, cells, blood-vessels, and odontoblasts have all shared\r\nthe process of fibrication and are no longer recognizable.\" These\r\nradical changes in the teeth, brought about by a deficiency of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine, were demonstrated not only in guinea-pigs but\r\nalso in monkeys. In some instances they were found where a histologic\r\nexamination of the costochondral junctions showed nothing abnormal.\r\n\"Profound changes were recorded where the scorbutic changes during life\r\nwere so slight as to be almost unrecognizable,\" and, they continue, \"the\r\nmildest degree of scurvy which could just be discovered at the\r\npostmortem examination produced well-defined changes in the structure of\r\nthe teeth.\" If this work is confirmed, we must consider the teeth as one\r\nof the first tissues of the body to be affected by scurvy. The authors\r\nquite rightly raise the question whether the teeth of young children may\r\nnot likewise be injured by a deficiency of antiscorbutic vitamine,\r\nwhether this may not play a rôle in the dental caries so prevalent\r\namong civilized communities. It is evident, they state, that such\r\ntransient conditions of infantile scurvy as have been described by Hess\r\nas \"subacute\" or \"latent\" scurvy, may occur more often than is usually\r\nsuspected, and may reasonably be expected to influence dentition. It\r\nseems quite possible that the caries of the permanent teeth is due not\r\nonly to infantile rickets but also to infantile scurvy.\r\n\r\nBesides the typical histologic changes in the bones there are\r\nalterations in _other organs_ which require mention. All investigators\r\nhave found a degeneration of the muscles, showing a loss of their\r\nstriations, swelling of the fibres, and the presence of\r\nirregularly-distributed vacuoles and granules. The interstitial tissue\r\nfrequently is permeated with edema, as we should expect from gross\r\nappearances. Holst and Froelich have reported a fatty degeneration of\r\nthe heart muscle, as well as of the epithelium of the mucous membrane of\r\nthe glands of the stomach and of the intestine. Hart and Lessing, in\r\ntheir protocols of necropsies on monkeys, describe an interesting lesion\r\nassociated with the degenerated muscle fibres--a collection of granules\r\nstaining deep blue with hæmatoxylin and dissolving on the addition of\r\nacid. These granules, interpreted as being composed of calcium, were\r\nfound in the muscles of the limbs, of the tongue, and in the heart. It\r\nis reasonable to attribute their formation to an absorption of bone\r\nthroughout the body. Similar calcium deposits were seen frequently in\r\nthe adrenal glands, in their cortex, or at the border of the cortex and\r\nmedulla. This lesion gains special interest in view of the calcium\r\ndeposits described so frequently in connection with mercurial poisoning,\r\nmore particularly as the symptoms of scurvy and of this toxic condition\r\nhave marked clinical resemblances.\r\n\r\nThere has been but little histologic investigation of the _nerves_ in\r\nexperimental scurvy. In fact, the only systematic study of the kind is\r\nthat of Holst and Froelich, whose attention was drawn to this field in\r\nan attempt to solve the relationship between scurvy and ship beriberi.\r\nThese writers found a true Wallerian polyneuritis in only two pigs, one\r\nof which had been fed on wheat bread made with yeast, and the other on\r\ndecorticated barley. In many instances, however, there was extensive\r\ndegeneration of the axis cylinders without degeneration of the sheaths.\r\nThey do not, however, attribute great importance to these changes, as\r\nthe same lesions were found in the nerves of animals fed on cabbage and\r\nfresh potatoes. In view of the confusing reports on the nerves of birds\r\nin experiments on polyneuritis, one cannot be too careful in drawing\r\nconclusions from histologic studies of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn the study by Jackson and Moore on experimental scurvy in guinea-pigs,\r\nthe histology of _the blood-vessels_ is carefully considered. \"Marked\r\nthinning of the wall\" was found and depicted; \"the wall as a whole had\r\npartially melted away, leaving few traces.\" These parts of the wall\r\ncontained many small round bodies resembling cocci, which were stained a\r\ndeep blue by the Wright and the Giemsa methods. These bodies were\r\npresent also in the lumen of the vessel and in the inner layers of the\r\nmore normal portions of the wall. In addition to such changes in the\r\nveins, \"lesions having the shape, location, and characteristics of\r\ninfarcts, were found in the ends of the diaphyses of the long bones.\" As\r\na result of this pathologic picture the authors are of the opinion that\r\nthey may have been dealing with a mild infection. This is quite\r\npossible, as scurvy tends to render the tissues less resistant to the\r\nentrance of bacteria. We believe, however, that even if such were the\r\ncase, the phenomenon must be regarded merely as secondary in its\r\nrelation to the pathogenesis of scurvy.\r\n\r\nFollowing the study on the pathology of experimental scurvy, Jackson and\r\nMoore undertook to determine primarily whether the small stained bodies\r\nseen in the sections of the scurvy lesions were bacteria. This\r\ninvestigation has been cited frequently as presenting cogent evidence in\r\nfavor of the _infectious nature of scurvy_, so that it will be necessary\r\nto consider it fully; the general question of whether scurvy is a\r\nbacterial infection is discussed under the consideration of etiology.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Morpurgo, a generation ago, claimed to have produced\r\nrhachitic lesions in young rats by means of artificial infection with a\r\ngram-positive diplococcus. Pappenheimer brought about similar lesions in\r\nrats by the injection of a suspension of bone marrow from a rhachitic\r\nanimal. Koch injected a streptococcus longus intravenously into young\r\ndogs, occasioning gross bony changes of the epiphyses and costochondral\r\njunctions, and microscopic changes resembling scurvy--an irregular line\r\nof ossification and \"a framework\" marrow, which, however, showed regions\r\nof osteoid. Jackson and Moody were able to isolate from the crushed\r\ntissue of their guinea-pigs \"a diplococcus of low virulence with a\r\ntendency to form chains and produce green (color) on blood agar.\" Pure\r\nstrains of these organisms inoculated into the circulation of\r\nguinea-pigs and rabbits, living under ordinary conditions (a mixed diet\r\nconsisting of green vegetables, hay and oats), gave rise in most\r\ninstances to hemorrhagic and other lesions in the bones, joints,\r\nmuscles, lymph-glands or gums. Hemorrhages were found beneath the\r\nperiosteum in the region of the lower incisor teeth and the acetabulum\r\nand ribs. These results are far from constituting evidence in favor of\r\nthe microbic origin of scurvy. They show merely that the tissues of\r\nscorbutic animals frequently harbor bacteria, and that injections of\r\nthese bacteria will bring about hemorrhages which may be subperiosteal\r\nin character. They are open to the specific criticism that scurvy was\r\nproduced readily in the rabbit, an animal which otherwise does not\r\ndevelop scurvy, and, furthermore, they differ from feeding experiments\r\nin inciting scurvy notwithstanding the fact that the animals were\r\nreceiving an antiscorbutic diet (green vegetables). Cultures of the\r\nhearts' blood of the affected animals were sterile in every instance; a\r\nresult obtained likewise by Holst and Froelich.\r\n\r\nFurther studies of this kind should be carried out and should include\r\ncultures of the blood and tissues of guinea-pigs in the various stages\r\nof scurvy, especially the early stage. In addition, a histologic study\r\nshould be made of the bones of animals injected with bacteria\r\n(preferably streptococci), in order to ascertain whether notwithstanding\r\nan unrestricted diet, typical lesions can be produced by this means.\r\n\r\nFor further details of the pathology of scurvy, the reader is referred\r\nto the chapter on human pathology.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Let us consider the symptomatology of guinea-pig scurvy. In\r\nthe course of an observation of many hundreds of animals we have been\r\nstruck by the striking uniformity of the signs and symptoms. The animals\r\nmade use of were almost invariably of moderate size, weighing from 200\r\nto 300 grams. Where heavier pigs were employed the disease progressed\r\nless rapidly, but the signs were the same; they were, however, more\r\ndifficult to elicit, owing to the subcutaneous fat. Most of the animals\r\nwere on a diet of hay, oats and water _ad libitum_, but there was no\r\nvariation in symptoms where fat and fat-soluble vitamine were supplied\r\nby an addition of egg yolk or of cod liver oil, or where egg albumen was\r\nfed to render the protein adequate, or where the inorganic salts were\r\nsupplemented by additions of sodium or calcium chloride.\r\n\r\nThere is a variability in the sign which signalizes the onset of the\r\ndisorder--sometimes it consists of a flattening of the weight curve, at\r\nothers of an inordinate excitability of the animal, or frequently of a\r\ntender joint, generally a wrist. The joints almost invariably become\r\ntender early in the disease, causing the animal to wince and cry when it\r\nis examined. Accompanying this tenderness there is often slight swelling\r\ndue to edema, or perhaps some hemorrhage, which alters the sharp,\r\nclean-cut contour of the joint. This edema may extend upward along the\r\ntendon sheaths. Soon the animal becomes lethargic rather than nervously\r\nactive, and may look ill, as manifested by a roughness of its coat and\r\nits unnatural posture. Frequently it sits on three legs with the tender\r\nhind leg drawn upward and outward so as to escape pressure--a posture\r\ntermed by Chick, Hume and Skelton (1918, 2) \"_the scurvy position_,\" and\r\nindicative of hemorrhage into the joints or muscles. At times it lies\r\ncurled up, with the side of its face resting on the floor, as if to\r\nsupport its painful or sensitive jaw; this they have termed the\r\n\"_face-ache position_.\" The two diagnostic signs, however, are the\r\nhemorrhages about the joints and the loosening of the teeth. The\r\ndiagnosis frequently can be established by the twelfth to the fourteenth\r\nday; the earliest diagnosis was made on the eighth day. Hemorrhages\r\nappear somewhat later than tenderness, and are situated at the joints,\r\nmost frequently at the knee, which may be markedly swollen and show a\r\nbluish or reddish discoloration, extending upward or downward for some\r\ndistance. Other joints are often involved, frequently the wrist, the\r\nankle or the shoulder. In other cases hemorrhages into the muscles are\r\nnoted, especially of the leg or of the thigh, and later, especially\r\ntoward the end, hemorrhages from the bowel. Fractures or separations of\r\nthe epiphyses may be found on examination or may be occasioned by the\r\nphysical examination. A frequent site of this lesion is at the wrist or\r\nat the knee, involving the head of the tibia or the lower end of the\r\nfemur. These fractures knit rapidly when an antiscorbutic is given, but\r\nresult at times in deformity.\r\n\r\n_Loosening of the teeth_ is another typical sign. It is, however, one\r\nwhich does not appear early and is somewhat difficult to elicit. The\r\nmolar teeth are generally involved, especially those of the upper jaw,\r\nwhich may be so completely separated from their alveolar sockets that\r\nthey can readily be removed by forceps. It is, however, impossible to\r\nexamine the molar teeth satisfactorily during life. Far less frequently\r\nan incisor tooth becomes loosened; more often it loses its glistening\r\nappearance and looks dull and yellowish. Occasionally an incisor tooth\r\nfractures. The gums are rarely altered sufficiently to aid diagnosis;\r\nnot infrequently they are congested or bluish, rarely hemorrhagic, and\r\nnever ulcerous or spongy. This is the chief difference between the\r\nsymptomatology of scurvy in the guinea-pig and in man, and probably is\r\nthe result of lesser susceptibility of the former to infection by\r\npyogenic bacteria. In general, however, the disorder in the guinea-pig\r\nbears a closer analogy to infantile than to adult scurvy; due to the\r\nfact, possibly, that young pigs are generally used for the experiments.\r\n\r\nA sign of great interest, although not of diagnostic importance, is the\r\n_\"beading\" of the ribs_ noted by many observers, and emphasized by\r\nJackson and Moore. It has been described also in monkeys by Hart and\r\nLessing. This is an enlargement or swelling of the costochondral\r\njunctions of the ribs, especially of the lower true ribs. It corresponds\r\nclinically to the \"beading\" and the \"rosary\" so characteristic of\r\ninfantile rickets and mistakenly termed the \"rhachitic rosary.\" As\r\npointed out, in discussing the symptomatology and pathology of human\r\nscurvy, this sign must be regarded as truly scorbutic in animals as well\r\nas in infants. The \"rosary\" is difficult to palpate in pigs which have\r\nconsiderable subcutaneous tissue; in thin animals, however, its course\r\ncan be followed, the gradual development and subsequent disappearance.\r\nIn this connection the enlargement of the epiphyses must be mentioned,\r\nanother sign supposed to be characteristic of rickets in infants. Marked\r\nswelling of the wrists is frequently encountered in guinea-pigs\r\nsuffering from scurvy--a bony enlargement involving the lower epiphyses\r\nof the ulna and of the radius. This is met with far more commonly in\r\nchronic scurvy than in the usual acute case. Where the disorder has\r\nexisted for a long period, these bony knobs may persist indefinitely,\r\nconstituting the sole residual sign of a former scorbutic condition.\r\n\r\nThe relation of _loss of weight_ to the development of the scurvy\r\nrequires consideration. In experiments carried out on rats to test the\r\ndiets in respect to the water-soluble and the fat-soluble vitamines, the\r\nweight curve is used as the main criterion to judge whether the\r\nfoodstuff is adequate. In guinea-pigs we cannot employ the weight curve\r\nas a criterion. Not infrequently an animal develops scurvy, and\r\nnevertheless does not lose in weight, but even gains slowly and\r\nsteadily. This occurs when the appetite remains good, and the dietary is\r\ncomplete except for antiscorbutic vitamine. The same holds true for\r\nhuman scurvy, as we have noted in connection with the symptomatology. We\r\nhave attempted to make up for this defect by adding to the charts a\r\ncurve representing the clinical course (Fig. 10). Although this curve is\r\ncomputed on an empirical basis, it gives a comparatively true picture of\r\nthe disease and is far more exact than attempting to portray the disease\r\nby means of a weight curve.[38] Indeed, when we rely on the latter\r\nmethod it is impossible frequently to illustrate graphically the\r\nreaction of guinea-pigs to various influences. Another disadvantage of\r\nthe weight curve is that it is influenced by factors having no direct\r\nrelation to scurvy, especially infections of various types which retard\r\nthe gain.\r\n\r\n[38] A maximum count of 35 was formulated, representing the highest\r\ndegree of clinical scurvy. This includes three grades of beading of the\r\nribs, four of tenderness of each knee and wrist joint, and four of\r\nswelling of each of these joints. It is apparent from the clinical curve\r\n(Fig. 10) that an animal may have developed a marked degree of scurvy\r\n(20 points), and gained rather than have lost in weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Hay, oats, and water _ad libitum_ during period\r\nI resulted in a lack of gain in weight, and in a development of scurvy.\r\nDuring period II, 1.5 c.c. of orange juice were given daily, and as will\r\nbe seen there was a marked gain in weight and disappearance of the\r\nscorbutic signs, although, as is generally the case, they continue to\r\ndevelop for a short while after an antiscorbutic is given. When the\r\norange juice was discontinued in the third period, the weight once more\r\nfell and the scurvy redeveloped. The broken line represents the course\r\nof the scurvy, and is a composite formed on the basis of the aggregate\r\nof the scorbutic signs. Each square represents a 2-day interval.]\r\n\r\nGuinea-pigs generally die of scurvy after having lost about one-third of\r\ntheir body weight; occasionally the loss is greater, reaching almost 50\r\nper cent. This loss is due partly to the scorbutic condition, but to a\r\ngreater extent to starvation occasioned by a marked lack of appetite. In\r\nthis connection it may be noted that guinea-pigs frequently lose for a\r\nfew days following the addition of an antiscorbutic to the dietary (Fig.\r\n11). This reaction is evident from a perusal of the weight charts of\r\nother investigators, and occurs likewise in human scurvy. This loss is\r\naccompanied, as Gerstenberger has pointed out, by diuresis, which may be\r\nso marked that it is evident to the casual observation of those caring\r\nfor the animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--These guinea-pigs developed scurvy in spite of\r\nreceiving a large quantity of the water in which young carrots had been\r\ncooked for only 20 minutes. It will be noted, however, that although the\r\npigs developed scurvy they did not lose weight, as is usually the case.\r\nAfter they had developed definite scurvy they were given in addition the\r\nequivalent of 80 c.c. of a dried milk prepared by being heated to about\r\n116° C. for a few seconds. The addition of this milk to the diet cured\r\nthe scurvy, showing that it had largely retained its antiscorbutic\r\nvitamine.]\r\n\r\nExophthalmos may be mentioned again in this connection as a very rare\r\nsign of guinea-pig scurvy. Hæmaturia also occurs at times; it is not\r\nknown how frequently it is present, whether it is an early manifestation\r\nin the guinea-pig as in the infant, or whether the source of the blood\r\nis the kidney or the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe superficial lymphatic glands are frequently palpable in scurvy,\r\nespecially those in the inguinal region. This sign is emphasized by some\r\npathologists. It has seemed to us attributable less to the nutritional\r\ncondition than to the infections which so frequently complicate the\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jackson and Moore a rise of temperature does not accompany\r\nscurvy in the guinea-pig. As the result of an examination of nine\r\nguinea-pigs they conclude that \"experimental scurvy is a non-febrile\r\ndisease in the majority of affected animals.\" Nor did they find a\r\nleucocytosis, the average leucocyte count of eight scorbutic pigs being\r\nabout 8000.\r\n\r\nAs the data are meagre, a consideration of the chemical alterations\r\nassociated with the scurvy of guinea-pigs and monkeys will be taken up\r\nin conjunction with the metabolism of human scurvy. The therapy of\r\nanimal scurvy will also be deferred (chapter VI), as the reaction to\r\ndietetic measures is practically the same in man and in animals. In\r\nconcluding this chapter we would call attention to the following\r\ninteresting statement contained in the recent paper by Delf and Tozer:\r\n\"In other experiments, however, where a liberal supply of an\r\nantiscorbutic was given and where the fat-soluble A growth factor was\r\nknown to be deficient, the resulting histological changes in the\r\nrib-junctions of the animals examined were found to resemble closely\r\nthose of 'Definite' or of 'Definite Chronic' scurvy. In these test cases\r\nthe antiscorbutic chosen was, we believed, deficient in the fat-soluble\r\nA growth factor (for example, orange juice). This fact is mentioned\r\nbecause in the case of an animal not receiving an adequate supply of\r\nfat-soluble A the resulting changes in the junctions are not dissimilar\r\nfrom, and are likely to be confused with, those caused by scurvy alone.\"\r\nIf this observation is confirmed, it emphasizes the necessity in\r\nnutritional experiments, of constructing a dietary which is complete in\r\nevery respect except the one under investigation; it also suggests the\r\ndevelopment of new pathologic entities in relation to other nutritional\r\ndisorders resulting from a lack of the accessory food factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nANTISCORBUTIC FOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical Review.=[39]--It is impossible to state when and how the\r\nknowledge of the value of antiscorbutic foodstuffs came to be\r\nappreciated. It is probable that the potency of herbs and fruits in\r\nscurvy was known empirically to individuals and groups of people long\r\nbefore the fact gained general recognition. A most interesting history\r\nof antiscorbutics is given in the excellent work of Hirsch and in our\r\ngreat classic on scurvy by Lind. The first realization of the value of\r\nlemons and oranges seems to have been the result of a chance discovery.\r\nBudd tells us that in the sixteenth century sailors of a Dutch sailing\r\nvessel laden with these fruits were attacked with scurvy, and that, when\r\nthey partook of the lemons and oranges in the cargo, a miraculous cure\r\nresulted. He narrates also the following striking incident, which is\r\nmentioned likewise by Lind:\r\n\r\n[39] It is of interest that John Hall, the son-in-law of Shakespeare,\r\nand a prominent physician of Warwickshire, was one of the first to urge\r\nthe use of antiscorbutics. In a quaint work entitled, \"Select\r\nObservations on English Bodies, or Cures both Empericall and Historical\"\r\n(1657 London), he describes how he cured scurvy by means of brewing a\r\nbeer or ale from \"Scorbutick hearbs, _viz._: scurvy grass, water-cresses\r\nand brook lime.\" This book, which ran through at least two editions, has\r\nnot achieved the popularity of the works of the father-in-law.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1600 four sailing vessels left England for the East Indies.\r\nThe sailors on three of these ships did not receive lime juice, whereas\r\nthose on the fourth received their daily quota. The men of the first\r\nthree ships suffered severely from scurvy, but those on the fourth\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nIn an excellent work on \"Scorvey,\" published in 1685, Harvey wrote:\r\n\"Wherefore most acids, especially spirit of salt marine, juice of\r\nsorrel, limons, citrons, etc., are so deservedly extolled in some\r\nscorbutic distempers and seconded with good success.\" Thus we see that\r\neven at this early date it was taken for granted that citrous fruits\r\npossessed virtue in curing scurvy. Bachstrom (Observationes circa\r\nScorbutum, 1734) evidently was well-acquainted with the antiscorbutic\r\nvalue of scurvy grass, and relates the story of a sailor severely\r\ndisabled from scurvy who was put ashore to perish on Greenland, and\r\ncrawled on the ground, grazed on scurvy grass like a beast of the field,\r\nand was able to return home perfectly recovered. (Cited from Lind.)\r\n\r\nThe credit for forcing a general acceptance of the antiscorbutic value\r\nof fresh food belongs to Lind. He did not, however, have an easy task,\r\nand in 1747, in order to convince those who still were skeptical, he\r\nresorted to an experiment on human beings. Twelve patients in his\r\nhospital were given the same diet, except that some received sea-water\r\nin addition to their dietary, others vinegar, or elixir of sulphuric\r\nacid, or a daily portion of cider, or oranges and one lemon daily. The\r\nlast two groups, as we should expect, recovered quickly; one man who\r\nreceived cider improved, but in no other case was any alleviation noted.\r\n\r\nLind extols the value of lemons and oranges, of berries, of sour\r\ncabbage, of cider, and of all fresh fruits and vegetables. In spite of\r\nthe fact, however, that Lind's teaching was based on an experience with\r\nthousands of patients suffering from scurvy in the naval hospital, his\r\nideas did not take root. It required an event which came directly under\r\nthe official eye to bring about radical changes in the diet of the\r\nsailors. In 1795 the English Fleet suffered from a severe epidemic of\r\nscurvy, which was finally controlled by giving the sailors fresh\r\nvegetables and fruit. This therapeutic result was so convincing that\r\nthenceforth a daily ration of lime juice was ordered for the sailors and\r\na regular issue provided for the navy. This marks the cessation of\r\nscurvy as a scourge of the British navy. From this time the disease\r\nappeared only sporadically. The sharp decrease in the incidence can be\r\nappreciated by Budd's statement that 1457 cases of scurvy were admitted\r\nto the Royal Naval Hospital in 1780, whereas in 1810 an English\r\nphysician reported that in the seven preceding years he had not treated\r\na single patient in this hospital suffering from scurvy. In another\r\nmarine hospital, between the years 1806 and 1810, only two cases of\r\nscurvy were admitted.\r\n\r\nNothing was done for the British merchant service until over half a\r\ncentury later, although scurvy continued to make its appearance among\r\nthe sailors with varying severity. Smith states in the article on this\r\nsubject in Allbutt's System of Medicine: \"In 1864 it was pointed out by\r\nDoctor Barnes that during the twelve years following 1851, 1058 cases of\r\nscurvy had been admitted into the hospital ship _Dreadnought_.\" In 1854\r\na law was passed requiring every vessel to carry an adequate supply of\r\nlime juice. This law, however, failed in effect, due to the fact that a\r\nlarge part of the lime juice was adulterated. A new shipping-act was\r\npassed, therefore, in 1867, with the object of preventing adulterations,\r\nat the same time increasing the daily quota for each seaman from half an\r\nounce to one ounce.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to add a few words concerning certain\r\nantiscorbutics which have been under discussion or recognized for so\r\nmany years that they have acquired an historical aspect. One of these\r\nfoodstuffs is sauerkraut, which was recognized by Lind in 1772 as having\r\nparticular potency in this disease. It is interesting to note, in this\r\nconnection, that this writer appreciated the close relationship of\r\nacidity to antiscorbutic virtue. \"One quality,\" he writes, \"entering the\r\nmost perfect antiscorbutic composition is a vegetable accescency.\" He\r\nprized sauerkraut for its inherent value, and particularly, because he\r\nfound that \"sour cabbage will keep for an East-India voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous navigator Cook, whose voyages were remarkable for the freedom\r\nfrom illness which his sailors enjoyed and the absence of scurvy, always\r\nkept a large supply of sauerkraut on hand. It was believed by many that\r\nthe immunity of the Dutch seamen to scurvy was due to their large\r\nconsumption of this vegetable. As the result of this empirical\r\nknowledge, the English navy in 1780 introduced the use of sauerkraut\r\ninto its ration. As just noted, however, this antiscorbutic was\r\nsupplanted some few years later by an issue of lime juice.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that outbreaks of scurvy follow closely upon a\r\nfailure of the potato crop. This has been particularly the case in\r\nIreland, where it was especially evident in relation to the great\r\nepidemic of scurvy in 1847. Holst and Froelich inform us that \"all\r\nscurvy epidemics in Norway in the nineteenth and beginning of this\r\ncentury followed failure of the potato crop.\" Nor is this danger past.\r\nIn an article entitled \"The Rôle of Antiscorbutics in Our Dietary,\" the\r\nauthor recently reported that the partial failure of the potato crop in\r\nthe eastern part of the United States led to the development of scurvy\r\nin numerous institutions, in one of which over 200 cases of definite\r\nscurvy developed in the spring (1916).\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of scurvy in the navy and on sailing vessels has been\r\nassociated in the minds of many with the large amounts of salted meat\r\nwhich necessarily was included in the dietary. It was evident that meat\r\nthat was salted had no antiscorbutic value, but the query has been\r\nraised whether eating a considerable amount of salted meat did not\r\ninduce scurvy. Lind mentions \"flesh long salted\" as leading to the\r\ndevelopment of scurvy. The question of the value of meat as an\r\nantiscorbutic is of importance at the present time, chiefly in\r\nconnection with Polar expeditions and army rations. As the result of an\r\noutbreak of scurvy in the Polar expedition of 1875-6, a British Arctic\r\nSurvey Committee was appointed to make an investigation. In 1877 it\r\nreported that \"although the scurvy was due to the absence of lime juice\r\nfrom the sledge dietaries, meat in large amounts is able to prevent the\r\ndisease.\" Stefánsson also emphasized the value of meat in preventing\r\nscurvy in the Polar regions. In his expeditions he has found that raw\r\nmeat, if taken in sufficient quantity, is able to afford complete\r\nprotection. Jackson, who lived for some years among the Samoyeds, tells\r\nus that this tribe, owing to the fact that they consumed considerable\r\nreindeer meat, never suffered from scurvy in spite of the fact that they\r\nate no vegetables or fresh fruit during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe following account, a personal communication from Dr. Harrison J.\r\nHunt, who spent four years in the Arctic regions, is of interest in this\r\nconnection:\r\n\r\n\"For some four years I was with the Smith Sound Eskimos, on the\r\nnorthwest coast of Greenland. These people get nothing but animal food\r\nnormally, and have lived that way for many generations, yet are healthy,\r\nof good physique, and are normal in other ways. Scurvy was unknown to\r\nthem as far as I could ascertain; certainly there was none while I was\r\namong them. Much of their meat is eaten raw, and the rest only partly\r\ncooked; that is, 'rare done.'\r\n\r\n\"Whalers who were accustomed to winter in Hudson Bay practically always\r\nhad scurvy in the crew. It was common knowledge among the captains that\r\nfresh meat was curative of scurvy, and it was their practice to obtain\r\nmeat from the Eskimos whenever possible for that purpose. The last\r\nEnglish expeditions to the South Polar regions were afflicted with\r\nscurvy which was entirely and quickly eradicated by the use of fresh\r\nseal meat in the place of salt meats and canned foods. They do not state\r\nthat this meat was eaten raw or even rare cooked. On the Danish coast of\r\nGreenland, during seasons poor in game, scurvy is quite common, but the\r\nnatives there live largely on breadstuffs (very coarse rye bread).\r\nPersonally, during my four years in the Arctic, I took no fresh\r\nvegetables whatever, or other commonly-called antiscorbutics, relying\r\nsolely on rare or raw meat. I never was stronger or more healthy in my\r\nlife. I did have dried fruits and vegetables, and usually plenty of\r\nfresh bread. Usually the Eskimos eat their raw meat in a frozen\r\ncondition, and I can attest that it is extremely palatable in that\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to discuss, in this place, the value of meat as an\r\nantiscorbutic; in passing, however, it may be said that, as in the case\r\nof the other antiscorbutics, its efficacy will depend largely upon the\r\namount consumed. The British Mesopotamia Commission Report of 1917 shows\r\nthat scurvy can develop on a ration which includes 28 ounces of meat a\r\nweek. We must remember, however, that this refers to cooked meat,\r\nwhereas in the Polar expeditions meat generally was eaten in a raw\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nRecently an historical inquiry has appeared in an article by Chick, Hume\r\nand Skelton as to the antiscorbutic virtue of limes and lemons. This\r\nsketch is of exceptional interest because it treats of the oldest and\r\nmost cherished antiscorbutics, and particularly because it has unearthed\r\na peculiar fallacy in their connection. As they state, there would\r\nappear to be every reason for believing \"that the use of so-called lime\r\njuice was responsible for the disappearance of scurvy from the British\r\nnavy in the first decade of the nineteenth century.\" It would seem,\r\nhowever, that the lime juice which gained this great reputation in the\r\nnavy some 125 years ago was in reality lemon juice, and that it was not\r\nuntil about 50 years ago that lime juice was really used. These authors\r\nshow--by one of those striking human experiments which, occasionally, is\r\navailable--that in a Polar exploration which was organized in 1850 lemon\r\njuice was issued to each man, and that no case of scurvy developed,\r\nwhereas in a similar expedition which went out in 1875 lime juice was\r\nissued and scurvy developed the following spring with great severity\r\namong the sledge crews. This investigation, therefore, seems to prove\r\nthat lime juice, the prototype of antiscorbutics, has been accorded a\r\nfalse position; that in reality the sailors of the past have been\r\nprotected by lemon juice.\r\n\r\n=Antiscorbutic Foods.=--As far as has been ascertained, the\r\nantiscorbutic food factor exists in all fresh vegetable and animal\r\ntissues, being present to a far greater degree in the former than in the\r\nlatter. It is distinguished by being associated in nature with cells\r\nwhich are the seat of active metabolism, just as the water-soluble\r\nvitamine is associated mainly with cells which are in an inactive or\r\ndormant state. Vegetables or fruits may be mildly or highly\r\nantiscorbutic; there is indeed a remarkable difference in their content\r\nof antiscorbutic factor or vitamine. They vary widely also in the degree\r\nto which their potency is affected by physical or chemical conditions.\r\nIn this chapter the most common animal and vegetable antiscorbutic\r\nfoodstuffs will be considered and the effect which processes such as\r\ndrying, canning, change of reaction, etc., exert on their specific\r\nvalue. Their therapeutic application in the prevention and cure of\r\nscurvy will be considered in a subsequent chapter. Until recently our\r\nknowledge of this subject was empirical and inaccurate; as the result of\r\nscientific work, however, carried out during the past few years in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, quantitative and comparative figures of\r\nantiscorbutic food values have been evolved.\r\n\r\n=Milk.=--It is important to have as accurate an idea as possible of the\r\nvalue of milk as an antiscorbutic, as the infant depends on it during\r\nthe first months of its life for a supply of this essential factor.\r\nConsiderable attention has been paid to this question in the last few\r\nyears, and recent reports tend to confirm the former estimations which\r\nhad been overlooked and forgotten. In 1847 Curran wrote that in the\r\nIrish epidemic of this year they had admitted to the Dublin Union\r\nHospital 80 cases of scurvy which had been on a diet which included one\r\npint of milk daily, but was deficient in vegetables. From this\r\nexperience he realized that milk was not rich in the principles which\r\nprotect against scurvy. In the following year Parkes came to the same\r\nconclusion, stating that 500 to 750 c.c. of raw milk did not always\r\nsuffice to prevent scurvy. In addition to these opinions concerning\r\nadults, similar conclusions have been drawn from clinical experience\r\nwith infants. Barlow (1894) realized that a small amount of milk was\r\ninsufficient to protect against scurvy. Still writes: \"The antiscorbutic\r\npower of fresh, unboiled milk is evidently slight.\" In 1914 Hess and\r\nFish pointed out that \"milk must not be considered as having potent\r\nantiscorbutic properties.\" Nevertheless, when this question was raised\r\nrecently by the experimental work of Jackson and Moore, and that of\r\nMcCollum and Pitz, it was not appreciated that, like other\r\nantiscorbutics, milk must be regarded from a quantitative standpoint,\r\nand that, as it is a weak antiscorbutic, its effect must depend largely\r\non the quantity consumed.\r\n\r\nThe first laboratory work on this subject was that of Froelich in 1912,\r\nwho showed that guinea-pigs could be protected by an exclusive diet of\r\nfresh milk, and that raw milk is more effective than heated milk. In his\r\nwork, the amount of milk taken by the animals was not measured, so that\r\nit is impossible to glean from it more than these general conclusions.\r\nIn the following year, as a result of some quantitative experiments,\r\nFunk stated that he was able to protect guinea-pigs with 50 c.c. of\r\nfresh milk in addition to an oat diet. This estimate, as subsequent\r\nworkers showed, is too low. Chick, Hume and Skelton were the first,\r\nhowever, to investigate the antiscorbutic potency of milk in a\r\nsystematic and convincing manner. They demonstrated that if the daily\r\nconsumption of fresh milk was less than 50 c.c., a guinea-pig died\r\nalmost as quickly as if it received no milk; if the daily quota varied\r\nfrom 50 to 100 c.c., a greater or less protection from scurvy was\r\nobserved, varying proportionately with the amount consumed; if 100 to\r\n150 c.c. were taken daily, which practically amounts to a complete milk\r\ndiet, satisfactory growth and development occurred, and no symptoms of\r\nscurvy were observed. This represents in a general way the present\r\nconception of the antiscorbutic power of milk. In passing, it may be\r\nremarked that it is not altogether clear why 50 c.c. of milk do not\r\nafford partial protection, and prolong the life of the animal for a\r\ndefinite length of time. The authors conclude that \"milk is evidently a\r\nfood poor in the antiscurvy accessory factor, and a ration large in\r\ncomparison with that of other antiscorbutic materials is necessary to\r\nafford satisfactory protection from scurvy.\" The error must be avoided,\r\nhowever, of regarding milk as a standard article of diet containing a\r\ndefinite and specific amount of vitamine per cubic centimetre. It will\r\nbe shown later that this point of view cannot be taken in regard to\r\nvegetables, and it is probable that it cannot be assumed for milk.\r\n\r\nA general conception of the antiscorbutic potency of cow's milk may be\r\ngleaned from the fact that it requires a minimum of about sixteen ounces\r\n(500 c.c.) daily to protect an infant from scurvy or to cure it. Twelve\r\nounces have failed to effect a cure in several instances, although the\r\nmilk was raw and of the best grade. If it is pasteurized, a larger\r\nquantity is required, depending upon various conditions connected with\r\nthe heating process and upon the age of the milk, circumstances fully\r\ndiscussed in relation to etiology. Thus it becomes evident that\r\npasteurized milk assumes a two-fold rôle, acting as an antiscorbutic if\r\nlittle of its vitamine content has been destroyed and if a large\r\nquantity is consumed, or leading to the development of scurvy when one\r\nor both of these conditions is unfavorable. The same holds true for milk\r\nwhich has been boiled for a short period. If the milk has been heated\r\ntwice, it tends to produce scurvy; if it is condensed, the greater part\r\nof its antiscorbutic value is destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt seems necessary to emphasize again the important fact that _dried\r\nmilk_ may possess marked antiscorbutic potency, depending on the method\r\nof preparation (Fig. 11). As stated, sixteen ounces of milk dried by the\r\nJust-Hatmaker process cured scurvy promptly, in spite of the fact that\r\nthe milk had been dried six months previously. Here, therefore, is a\r\nfood of high caloric value, compact, antiscorbutic, and stable. The fact\r\nthat milk, in spite of drying, retains this labile vitamine for so long\r\na period, demonstrates that it is available in the most remote parts of\r\nthe world, and that the possibilities of its transportation are\r\nunlimited.\r\n\r\nLittle is known regarding the antiscorbutic content of the milk of the\r\nvarious domestic animals. Some claim that goat's milk is notably rich in\r\nthis particular, but experiments with it are too few to warrant\r\nconclusions. Lind writes: \"Goats, of all animals, afford the richest\r\nwhey, possessed of the greatest antiscorbutic virtue ... which in a\r\nsingular manner restores the constitution when weakened and impaired by\r\nscurvy.\" Human milk possesses about the same potency as cow's milk, as\r\nmentioned in the discussion of the occurrence of infantile scurvy in\r\ncountries where the adult form is endemic. Twelve ounces of human milk,\r\nfrom a woman on a liberal and varied diet, barely sufficed to alleviate\r\nthe symptoms of a case of moderate intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT JUICES\r\n\r\n=Orange and Lemon Juice.=--The most thoroughly studied antiscorbutic\r\nfoods are orange and lemon juice, which have been singled out because\r\nthey contain the antiscorbutic factor in the highest concentration. It\r\nhas been ascertained through the work of various investigators that\r\nguinea-pigs require about 3 c.c. daily of either of these juices to\r\nprotect them from scurvy, but that about half this amount is sufficient\r\nto prevent the manifestation of clinical signs.\r\n\r\nBoth of these juices withstand heat remarkably well. Orange juice can be\r\nboiled for 10 minutes without noting any diminution of its antiscorbutic\r\nvalue, and lemon juice heated to 110° C. without appreciably losing its\r\nefficacy. However, orange juice undergoes some change as the result of\r\nbeing heated in an autoclave for 45 minutes at a temperature of 110°\r\nunder 10 to 15 pounds pressure. Although 6 c.c. of this heated\r\npreparation were able to prevent the development of scurvy, the\r\nguinea-pigs did not gain nearly as well as those which received 3 c.c.\r\nof the unheated juice. It seemed as if there was a destruction of some\r\nfactor apart from the antiscorbutic principle.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that these juices withstand heat well, they are\r\nsensitive to some other conditions. Orange juice which had been stored\r\nin the cold for three months was unable to protect guinea-pigs in the\r\ndosage of 3 c.c. per animal, resembling in its action the autoclaved\r\njuice. When this orange juice was six months old, double this quantity\r\nfailed to protect; throughout this period it was kept in the ice-box\r\nand covered with a layer of oleum petrolatum to avoid the access of air\r\nor possible contamination. Harden and Zilva met with a similar\r\nexperience, and state that \"after storing treated (concentrated) lemon\r\njuice for about a fortnight in a cold room, a marked loss can be\r\nobserved in its potency.\"\r\n\r\nThese authors reported also that when orange juice is _rendered slightly\r\nalkaline_ it loses its antiscorbutic potency. This question was\r\ninvestigated in relation to canned tomato juice, as well as to orange\r\njuice, and it was found that shortly after having been rendered 0.05 N\r\nalkaline to phenolphthalein, neither of these foods had lost an\r\nappreciable amount of its antiscorbutic factor. Five cubic centimetres\r\nper capita daily of freshly-alkalized orange juice were able to cure a\r\ngroup of pigs which had developed scurvy on another diet. If, however,\r\n24 hours were allowed to elapse instead of only one-half to one hour,\r\nbetween the alkalization and the feeding, then a considerable amount of\r\nthe antiscorbutic factor was lost. The same general rule seems to hold\r\nfor alkalization as for heating, _i.e._, the length of time the\r\nantiscorbutic food is subjected to the deleterious influence is fully as\r\nimportant as the intensity of the process. Advantage has been taken of\r\nthe fact that freshly-alkalized orange juice retains its potency, in\r\nusing it intravenously in the treatment of infantile scurvy.\r\n\r\n_Subcutaneous injections_ of neutralized orange juice failed to cure\r\nscurvy in guinea-pigs; Harden and Zilva were equally unsuccessful with\r\nlarge doses of their concentrated lemon juice. This is of interest in\r\nview of the marked therapeutic result which Shiga obtained with\r\nsubcutaneous injections of the water-soluble vitamine in pigeons\r\nsuffering from polyneuritis. It should be added that Holst and Froelich\r\n(1912) failed to cure scurvy in guinea-pigs by intraperitoneal\r\ninoculations of orange juice.\r\n\r\n_Lemon juice or orange juice may be dried_ and lose little of its\r\nantiscorbutic power. In their paper of 1912 Holst and Froelich reported\r\nthe efficacy of lemon juice evaporated in a vacuum, and recently Harden\r\nand Zilva published experiments which proved that \"by evaporating the\r\ntreated lemon juice to dryness in an acid medium an active dry residue\r\nis obtained.\" Still more recently Givens has shown that orange juice\r\nreduced to a powdered form by means of a spraying process has lost\r\nlittle of the antiscorbutic factor. These results prove that under\r\ncertain conditions the antiscorbutic factor withstands drying; one of\r\nthese favorable influences is an acid reaction, and another, rapidity of\r\ndesiccation.[40]\r\n\r\n[40] Preserved mulberries which had been sugared and cooked for\r\none-quarter to one-half an hour were found by Holst and Froelich (1912)\r\nto possess good antiscorbutic power three months later.\r\n\r\n=Lime Juice.=--Recently an investigation of lime juice has been carried\r\nout by Chick, Hume and Skelton. They were \"unable to detect any\r\nsignificant protection in a daily ration of from 5 to 10 c.c. of\r\npreserved lime juice which was several months or a year or more old.\"\r\nCrude lime juice of various ages had slight antiscorbutic value,\r\naffording only partial protection in a daily ration of 5 c.c. Even fresh\r\njuice was found not to be very efficacious compared with lemon juice.\r\nThe authors conclude that \"the relative value of these two fruit juices\r\ndeduced from the trials with monkeys is therefore in accord with that\r\nobtained in the experiments with guinea-pigs, _i.e._, the value of fresh\r\nlemon juice is approximately four times that of fresh lime juice.\" Holst\r\nand Froelich in 1907 carried out a similar but less extensive\r\ninvestigation. They also found that lime juice was unable to protect\r\nguinea-pigs from scurvy. Fuerst, a co-worker of Holst, continued this\r\nwork, and in his article of 1912 stated that guinea-pigs should not be\r\nprotected by a daily addition to their ration of 25 g. of lime juice;\r\nthese guinea-pigs received a mixed diet consisting of dry vegetables,\r\nbutter, almonds and malt extract. These two reports of the Norwegian\r\ninvestigators on this interesting subject should have attracted\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n=Other Fruits.=--A word may be said in regard to some other fruits. The\r\nantiscorbutic potency of _raspberries_ was tested by Holst and Froelich\r\n(1912) and found comparable to oranges and to lemons. The juice was also\r\nhighly resistant to heat, so that 10 c.c. of freshly-pressed juice were\r\nof protective value, even after it had been subjected to 100 or 110° C.\r\nfor one hour. Guinea-pigs which were thus treated showed no microscopic\r\nsigns of scurvy in any of the ribs, in the tibiæ or the femora.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 3\r\n   TABLE SHOWING THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANTISCORBUTIC FACTOR\r\n                        IN THE COMMONER FOODSTUFFS[*]\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n            Classes       |  Anti-  |        Classes         |  Anti-\r\n               of         |scorbutic|           of           |scorbutic\r\n           Foodstuffs     |  Factor |       Foodstuffs       |  Factor\r\n  ------------------------+---------+------------------------+---------\r\n  _Meat, Fish, Etc.:_     |         |_Vegetables and Fruits:_|\r\n    Lean meat (beef,      |         |  Cabbage, fresh        |  +++\r\n      mutton, etc.)       |    +    |  Cabbage, cooked       |    +\r\n    Liver                 |    +    |  Cabbage, dried        |  Very\r\n    Tinned meats          |    0    |                        | slight\r\n    Beef juice            |    +    |  Swede, raw expressed  |\r\n                          |         |    juice               |   ++\r\n  _Milk, Cheese, Etc.:_   |         |  Lettuce               |   ++\r\n    Milk, cow's, whole raw|    +    |  Carrots, fresh raw    |    +\r\n    Milk, cow's, skim raw |    +    |  Carrots, dried        |    0\r\n    Milk, cow's, dried    |    +    |  Beetroot, raw,        |  Less\r\n    Milk, cow's,          |  Less   |    expressed juice     | than +\r\n      boiled              | than +  |  Potatoes, raw         |  ...\r\n    Milk, cow's,          |  Less   |  Potatoes, cooked      |    +\r\n      pasteurized         | than +  |  Potatoes, dried       |    0\r\n    Milk, cow's, condensed|  Less   |  Beans, fresh, raw     |   ++\r\n      (sweetened)         | than +  |  Onions                |   ++\r\n                          |         |  Lemon juice, fresh    |  +++\r\n  _Eggs:_                 |         |  Lemon juice, preserved|   ++\r\n    Fresh                 |   ?0    |  Lime juice, fresh     |   ++\r\n    Dried                 |   ?0    |  Lime juice, preserved |  Very\r\n                          |         |                        | slight\r\n  _Cereals, Pulses, Etc.:_|         |  Orange juice          |  +++\r\n    Wheat, maize, rice,   |         |  Raspberries           |   ++\r\n      whole grain         |    0    |  Grapes                |    +\r\n    Wheat germ            |    0    |  Apples                |    +\r\n    Wheat, maize, bran    |    0    |  Bananas               |  Very\r\n    White wheaten flour,  |         |                        | slight\r\n      pure corn flour,    |         |  Tomatoes (canned)     |   ++\r\n      polished rice, etc. |    0    |\r\n    Linseed, millet       |    0    |_Miscellaneous:_        |\r\n    Dried peas, lentils,  |         |  Yeast, autolyzed      |    0\r\n      etc.                |    0    |  Meat extract          |    0\r\n    Soy beans, haricot    |         |  Beer                  |    0\r\n      beans               |    0    |  Cod liver oil         |    0\r\n    Germinated pulses or  |         |  Olive oil             |    0\r\n      cereals             |   ++    |  Human blood           |    +\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [*] This table is a modification of one prepared by the Medical\r\n      Research Committee\r\n\r\nThese authors also reported that they found _banana_ and _apple_ poor in\r\nantiscorbutic power, 30 g. daily being insufficient to protect a\r\nguinea-pig (Table 3). This was our experience with banana in the\r\ntreatment of infants suffering from mild scurvy. The banana has been\r\nshown by Sugiura and Benedict to be poor also in the water-soluble\r\nvitamine. It would be of interest to determine the difference in\r\nvitamine content between the fully ripe and the unripe fruit.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that _grapes_ are used considerably in the treatment\r\nof infantile scurvy, it is of importance to realize that they are poor\r\nin the antiscorbutic principle. Chick and Rhodes found that three of\r\nfour guinea-pigs receiving 20 g. daily developed scurvy; they rated the\r\npotency as ten times less than that of orange juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES\r\n\r\nIt is everyday knowledge that fresh vegetables are of great value in the\r\nprotection from, and cure of, scurvy. The first experimental\r\ninvestigation of this subject was that of Holst and Froelich, published\r\nin 1907, and continued in a series of papers extending to 1916. These\r\ninvestigators tested the potency of a large number of vegetables by\r\nfeeding them in varying quantities to guinea-pigs. They found that all\r\nvegetables have antiscorbutic value but to a markedly varying degree.\r\nCabbage, sorrel leaves, endive, head salad, and dandelion leaves, were\r\nfound to be of most avail in protecting against scurvy, whereas carrots,\r\ncooked potatoes and cooked turnips, and cauliflower proved to be of less\r\nvalue. In general, it may be stated that the leafy vegetables have more\r\nantiscorbutic power than the roots or the tubers. This generalization,\r\nwe shall see, is not without exception, _e.g._, the swede. Similar\r\nexperimental work has been recently carried on by a group of\r\ninvestigators at the Lister Institute, who have added considerably to\r\nour knowledge in this field. In all this experimental work cabbage has\r\nbeen found to be the most potent of the vegetables, and therefore\r\nexperiments have centered about it just as in considering fruits the\r\nwork has centered about orange juice or lemon juice. We shall,\r\ntherefore, discuss in detail its reaction to heat and dehydration.\r\n\r\n=Cabbage.=--Holst and Froelich found that 1 g. daily of fresh cabbage\r\nafforded nearly complete protection to guinea-pigs, and Delf has\r\ncorroborated this work. This amount is sufficient to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of manifest scurvy, although it does not induce satisfactory\r\ngrowth. In this respect it is comparable to giving 1.5 c.c. of orange\r\njuice daily. If guinea-pigs take only 0.5 g. of raw cabbage, scurvy will\r\ndevelop; whereas 2 g. or more will promote satisfactory growth and no\r\nscorbutic changes will be found on microscopic examination.\r\n\r\n=Effect of Heating.=--Vegetables are of decidedly less antiscorbutic\r\nvalue when cooked than raw; cabbage, for instance, on being boiled is\r\nweakened about one-half. Heating to 110° C. for an hour destroys almost\r\nall of its antiscorbutic factor. Delf's tests did not show so great a\r\nloss. She came to the conclusion, of theoretical and practical value,\r\nthat slow cooking at a low temperature is much more deleterious than\r\nrapid cooking at a higher temperature. Hess and Unger found that carrots\r\nlost much of their antiscorbutic power after boiling, and that this was\r\nthe result of a true destruction, the vitamine not having been merely\r\ndissolved in the water of boiling; for if guinea-pigs consumed 40 c.c.\r\nper capita of this water, they were not protected against scurvy (Fig.\r\n11). Acidulating the water with 10 per cent. vinegar did not reduce the\r\nloss, an experience similar to that of others using citric acid or lemon\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n_Vegetables cannot be considered from an antiscorbutic standpoint as a\r\nstandard and uniform foodstuff, as they vary in their content of this\r\nfactor according to their freshness and age._ This was demonstrated by\r\nmeans of feeding experiments with carrots. For example, 35 g. of old\r\ncarrots, such as were used for feeding the laboratory animals, afforded\r\nbut little protection after having been cooked in an open vessel for\r\nabout 45 minutes, whereas the same amount of young carrots cooked this\r\nway protected the guinea-pigs. It is obvious that this distinction is of\r\nimportance in evaluating the antiscorbutic content of the various foods,\r\nand in considering whether individuals and groups of individuals are\r\nreceiving an adequate quota of antiscorbutic vitamine. It will be noted\r\nlater that it is also of importance in connection with the potency of\r\ndehydrated vegetables. Recent experiments indicate that not only age,\r\nbut the _degree of ripeness_ must be considered in appraising the food\r\nvalue of vegetables. Feeding experiments showed that tomatoes which were\r\nfully ripe were more potent than those which were slightly green.\r\nProbably many other factors play a rôle in determining the richness of\r\nvegetables in vitamine. It may not be immaterial whether they are\r\nallowed to ripen on the vine or shrub, or mature subsequently. The\r\nnature of the soil may also affect the antiscorbutic quality of the\r\nvegetables or fruit. So that it is evident that we must not be schematic\r\nin considering this question, and must realize that a table of\r\nantiscorbutic values, such as accompanies this text (Table 3), does not\r\nfurnish definite and inflexible values.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference between _vegetables and vegetable juices_\r\nin keeping quality, and in their reaction to heat and to acid. In\r\ngeneral, it may be stated that the juices are much more sensitive. Holst\r\nand Froelich brought out this point in 1912 and enlarged upon it in\r\ntheir publication of 1916. The different juices vary greatly in this\r\nrespect; for example, dandelion juice is acutely sensitive to heat,\r\nwhereas sorrel leaves withstand high temperatures very well. In regard\r\nto these differences an analogy may be drawn to the fruit juices. Lemon,\r\norange and raspberry juices are markedly thermostable, but lime juice is\r\nweakened markedly by heat. Many of these juices are protected by the\r\naddition of acid--5 per cent. of lemon juice increasing the\r\nthermostability of cabbage juice--whereas, as we have stated, little is\r\ngained by cooking vegetables in an acid medium.\r\n\r\n=Potato.=--The civilized world is dependent for its quota of\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuff largely upon the potato. It might be thought,\r\ntherefore, that this would signify that the potato is endowed with great\r\nantiscorbutic power. Such is not the case, however, as demonstrated both\r\nby laboratory tests and clinical experience. Considering its importance,\r\nthere have been surprisingly few feeding experiments carried out with\r\npotato. Holst and Froelich (1912) found that 17 g. of potatoes, steamed\r\nat 100° C. for 30 minutes, afforded but slight protection, and that it\r\nrequired 20 g. to fully protect a guinea-pig. Givens and Cohen failed to\r\nward off scurvy by means of cooked potatoes fed to the equivalent of 5\r\ng. of the raw vegetable (guinea-pigs will not eat raw potatoes). There\r\nare no accurate figures as to the quantity of potatoes needed to protect\r\na human being from scurvy. The statement of Doctor Guy, however, who\r\nafter careful study of convicts' diets, concluded that 14 ounces daily\r\nwould protect them from scurvy (if the ration included one ounce of\r\nother fresh vegetable and 4 ounces of meat), is probably close to the\r\nmark.[41] With the experience that potatoes play such a significant rôle\r\nin the prevention of scurvy, how are we to interpret the fact that they\r\nare only mildly antiscorbutic? Potatoes are consumed in very large\r\namounts; in the Temperate Zone probably twice as many pounds of potatoes\r\nare consumed during the winter as of all other vegetables combined (Fig.\r\n1). It is evident, therefore, that in a practical evaluation of\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuffs, not only the intrinsic antiscorbutic potency\r\nmust be considered, but also the quantity of the vegetable or fruit\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n[41] Dr. Guy's evidence, Report of the Lords Commissioners of the\r\nAdmiralty on the Outbreak of Scurvy in the Recent Arctic\r\nExpedition--1877 (cited from Chick and Hume).\r\n\r\n=Swede.=--We cannot leave the consideration of vegetable antiscorbutics\r\nwithout adding a few words as to the value of swede juice,[42] which has\r\nbeen recently highly recommended by Chick and Rhodes, who found it\r\ncomparable to the cabbage and the onion, and even to orange juice. For\r\nexample, 25 c.c. of raw swede juice were equivalent to 1.5 g. of raw\r\ncabbage. It is, therefore, more potent than the juice of raw carrot, and\r\nfar more efficacious than the juice of the beetroot (Table 3). Tests\r\ncarried out with this antiscorbutic in infant feeding seemed to show\r\nthat it is of value in this field. The authors believe that the potency\r\nof vegetables is closely associated with certain botanical species, and\r\nthat in this way the marked virtue of the swede can be explained, as it\r\nbelongs to the natural order of Cruciferæ, which includes also the\r\ncabbage, the scurvy grass and the cresses. If, however, this is a rule\r\nof nature, it is difficult to explain the marked difference between the\r\nlime and the lemon, which are both varieties of Citrus Medica.\r\n\r\n[42] The swede is a root vegetable of the natural order Cruciferæ. It is\r\ngrown to a large extent in England, but is practically unknown in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=Dehydrated Vegetables.=--For hundreds of years fresh vegetables have\r\nbeen dried to serve as food during the winter months and have fulfilled\r\na useful purpose on account of their small bulk and great food value.\r\nThe question for us to consider, however, is whether dehydrated\r\nvegetables still retain their antiscorbutic quality and can be counted\r\non to supply this factor in the dietary. At present this subject is\r\nengaging the attention of laboratory workers as well as of practical\r\ndietitians and food hygienists. The experience of the past is not happy\r\nin this regard. In the Medical and Surgical History of the War of the\r\nRebellion we read as follows: \"A scorbutic tendency was developed at\r\nmost of our military posts during the winter season, after the troops\r\nhad been confined to the use of the ordinary ration with desiccated\r\nvegetables. The latter in quantities failed to repress the disease.\" In\r\nspite of this and similar military experiences[43] the employment of\r\ndehydrated vegetables was urged recently for rationing our soldiers, the\r\nclaim being made that \"by simply soaking in water and boiling in the\r\nsame water these vegetables are brought back to the condition of fresh\r\nvegetables.\" Both in this country and in England there was strong\r\npropaganda during the war to dehydrate vegetables on an enormous scale\r\nand to substitute them for the fresh food.\r\n\r\n[43] \"We find the College of Physicians at Vienna sent to Hungary great\r\nquantities of the most approved antiscorbutic herbs dried in this\r\nmanner; which were found to be of no benefit. Many of these would have\r\ntheir virtues as little impaired by drying as spinage, _e.g._, marsh\r\ntrefoil. Kramer tried almost every species of dried herbs to no\r\npurpose.\" (Treatise on The Scurvy. James Lind, London, 1772, p. 143.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Hay, oats, water _ad libitum_, and 7 g. of\r\ndehydrated carrots dried at a room temperature of about 130° F. about 1\r\nmonth previously. All animals developed scurvy. The marked gain in\r\nweight when an equivalent amount of fresh carrots was substituted for\r\nthe dehydrated vegetable corresponded to the disappearance of scorbutic\r\nsigns. Guinea-Pig B 951 did not receive fresh carrots, as it was\r\nevidently ailing at the time the second period began.]\r\n\r\nExperimental investigation on this subject may be summarized as showing\r\nthat vegetables dried according to present methods lose their\r\nantiscorbutic value as the result of dehydrating (Fig. 12), and that\r\nthey become still more impoverished as the result of aging. We should\r\nnot sweepingly condemn the principle of dehydration, as very possibly\r\nsome slight modifications in the process may be devised which will\r\ncounteract the deteriorating influence. In their paper of 1912, to which\r\nreference has been made so often, Holst and Froelich reported that\r\npotatoes, carrots, peas, lentils and almonds have practically no\r\nprotective value after they are thoroughly dried. In two reports--one\r\ngiving the results of feeding various brands of dehydrated carrots to\r\nguinea-pigs, and the other of an attempt to cure scurvy in babies by\r\nmeans of these carrots--we also came to the conclusion that the\r\nantiscorbutic factor had been almost completely destroyed. Givens and\r\nCohen (1918) found that even cabbage dried at a low temperature retained\r\nonly a small amount of its potency after a month, and Delf and Skelton\r\ncame to practically the same conclusion, also noting that the cabbage on\r\nbeing kept, steadily lost what little of the antiscorbutic factor had\r\nsurvived the drying process. The same was true of the fat-soluble\r\nfactor. These authors made an observation which may prove of value in\r\nhelping to solve this problem, namely, that \"the residual amount is\r\ndistinctly greater if the cabbage is plunged into boiling water before\r\ndrying.\" This protective action of heat they suggest may indicate that:\r\n\"Some at least of the destruction may be due to the activity of an\r\nenzyme or other body originally present in the living tissue.\"\r\n\r\nAnother observation which may prove of practical value in rendering\r\ndehydrated vegetables the nutritional equivalent of the fresh vegetable\r\nis that when the carrots selected for dehydration are young and fresh a\r\nproduct is obtained which possesses decided antiscorbutic power. In this\r\nconnection the following statement by Falk and his co-workers in a study\r\nof the enzyme action of vegetables and the effect of dehydration is\r\nsignificant: \"In considering these enzyme results, it may be pointed out\r\nthat the state of ripeness and the age of the vegetable undoubtedly\r\ninfluence the activities.\"\r\n\r\nThe most promising dehydration experiment has been conducted by Holst\r\nand Froelich and was published in 1916 in a paper which has passed\r\nunnoticed. They dried white cabbage so that it retained its\r\nantiscorbutic properties, and, to a large extent, its color and taste,\r\nfor a period of two years. This result was accomplished by keeping out\r\nall moisture and preventing hydrolysis,[44] a method which is employed\r\nin preserving antitoxins, toxins and agglutinins. It is by far the most\r\nencouraging test reported, and should be made the basis of further work\r\nby those actively interested in perfecting dehydration.\r\n\r\n[44] The cabbage was subjected to a preliminary drying for 8 days at 37°\r\nC. It was then put in an air-tight desiccator which contained a dish of\r\nphosphorus pentoxid. (The pentoxid was replaced for several weeks until\r\nit ceased to liquefy.) It was then placed in cylinders which had been\r\nrendered air free by means of a suction pump and which contained\r\nphosphorus pentoxid. This was kept at 37° C. and examined after 10, 18\r\nand 26 months. A similar result was not obtained when calcium chlorid\r\nwas employed, the temperature held at 37° C. and the cabbage was kept in\r\nan air-tight cylinder rather than in a vacuum. However, under these\r\nconditions if the cabbage was placed in the ice-box at a temperature of\r\n4°, 10° or 12° C. the antiscorbutic property was conserved after\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Cure of scurvy by the addition of canned\r\ntomato. In this case, as frequently, the alleviation of symptoms\r\npreceded the gain in weight.]\r\n\r\n=Canned Food (Tomatoes).=--In the course of canning, as in dehydrating,\r\nmost vegetables and fruits lose their antiscorbutic properties. A\r\ngeneral denunciation, however, of all canned foods is incorrect, as\r\nthere are exceptions to this rule. It has been shown by Hess and Unger\r\nthat canned tomatoes possess a high degree of antiscorbutic power (Fig.\r\n13), and it is probable that most of the acid fruits and vegetables are\r\nable to withstand the canning process. It was found, in an experiment\r\nembracing many series of guinea-pigs, that 4 c.c. daily of strained,\r\ncanned tomato are sufficient to afford protection, even when a lot was\r\nused which had been prepared a year previously. This is indeed\r\nremarkable, considering that the food undergoes a two-fold heating in\r\nthe course of canning, during one of which (\"processing\") the\r\ntemperature is raised to fully 230° F. Tomatoes have another advantage\r\nover most other vegetables in that they are richly endowed with the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine, as shown by our tests on pigeons suffering from\r\npolyneuritis, and by the experiments on rats of Osborne and Mendel, who\r\nfound tomatoes far superior in this respect to turnips, onions,\r\nbeetroots or beans. They are also rich in the fat-soluble vitamine. In\r\nview of the availability of canned tomatoes and their excellent keeping\r\nquality they are well suited to an extended use as an antiscorbutic. In\r\nthe subsequent chapter we shall discuss their employment in infant\r\nfeeding and in the army ration.\r\n\r\n=Germinated Cereals and Pulses.=--In 1912 Fuerst reported that although\r\nthe resting seed--the cereal grain, the pea, bean and lentil--are poor\r\nin antiscorbutic vitamine, they develop this principle as soon as they\r\ngerminate. They possess, in other words, latent antiscorbutic\r\nproperties, and are potentially antiscorbutic. This observation is not\r\nonly of scientific interest but of practical value, as these pulses are\r\nwell suited for transport and do not readily deteriorate. For this\r\nreason, Chick and her co-workers at the Lister Institute, who were\r\nsearching for an antiscorbutic foodstuff for the army, directed their\r\nattention to the utilization of the pulses. In the course of a thorough\r\ninvestigation (1919) they found that although it required 30 to 40 g.\r\ndaily of dry green peas to prevent scurvy in the guinea-pig, a\r\nconsumption of 10 g. of the germinated peas afforded satisfactory\r\nprotection.[45] The soaked seeds have an antiscorbutic value comparable\r\nto many of the fresh vegetables; by no means as great as cabbage, but\r\nsomewhat greater than that of carrots. As the result of cooking, their\r\npotency was found to be reduced about 75 per cent. We shall have\r\noccasion to refer to this antiscorbutic food in the chapter on treatment\r\nin connection with the rationing of armies.\r\n\r\n[45] The pulses, after having been soaked in water for 24 hours, were\r\nkept moist, with access of air, for about 48 hours at room temperature,\r\nand during this time germinated, developing a radicle usually about 1\r\ncm. in length.\r\n\r\n=Meat and Eggs.=--As has been stated, animal tissues are distinctly\r\ninferior to fruits and vegetables in the antiscorbutic principle. As\r\nthere has been no accurate evaluation of these foods--the only test\r\nbeing one by Chick, Hume and Skelton, where 10 c.c. of raw beef juice\r\nfailed to protect guinea-pigs--we have to depend upon clinical\r\nexperience for our knowledge. Beef juice is highly rated by physicians\r\nin the prevention of infantile scurvy, but it is probably far less\r\npotent than vegetables or fruit juices. The Arctic explorers, and many\r\nwho have lived in the Arctic regions, agree that the inhabitants are\r\nprotected from scurvy during the winter months by their diet of fresh\r\nmeat and fish. The Admiralty Enquiry on the outbreak of scurvy in the\r\nArctic Expedition of 1875 reported that a large ration of meat is\r\nnecessary to afford protection. Curran (1847) described three cases\r\nadmitted to the hospital in the great Irish epidemic of that year, where\r\nthe diet previously had included three-quarters of a pound of meat on\r\nfive days of the week. From these and similar experiences the conclusion\r\nis manifest that the divergence of opinion regarding the value of meat\r\nis based upon quantitative differences in the rations. Evidently, if\r\nsufficient meat is provided, the development of scurvy will be obviated.\r\nAnother factor which must be borne in mind is that those who refer to\r\nmeat in the Arctic regions refer to fresh raw meat, which is a far more\r\nvaluable antiscorbutic than the ordinary cooked meat.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no experimental data on the antiscorbutic value of\r\n_eggs_. Hard-boiled eggs were fed to guinea-pigs and it was found that 9\r\ng. per capita daily was insufficient to protect them. An attempt was\r\nalso made to cure infantile scurvy with a daily addition of one raw egg\r\nto the dietary, but without avail. It is possible that fresh raw eggs\r\nhave an antiscorbutic value comparable to meat, but the large quantity\r\nrequired makes dependence upon them impracticable.\r\n\r\n=Beer and Alcoholic Beverages.=--For generations beer has been highly\r\nregarded as an antiscorbutic. Captain Cook prized it greatly and always\r\nsupplied his men with a freshly-made infusion of malt called\r\n\"sweetwort.\" Lind writes: \"Beer and fermented liquors of any sort will\r\nbe found the best antiscorbutic remedies\" (p. 76). He refers at\r\ndifferent times to the value of spruce beer, ale, wine and other vinous\r\nliquors. In his excellent book on \"Military Hygiene,\" Munson writes:\r\n\"Good beer and wine have decided value, also vinegar.\" On the other\r\nhand, recent scientific experiment has shown that beer has practically\r\nno antiscorbutic value. There is but one study on this subject, that of\r\nHarden and Zilva, which is quite convincing. They found that guinea-pigs\r\nand monkeys developed scurvy in spite of the fact that they received,\r\nrespectively, 50 c.c. and 180 c.c. of beer daily. They conclude, as a\r\nresult of their experiments, that \"bottled ale and stout and fined beer\r\nas brought on to the market, are lacking both in antineuritic and\r\nantiscorbutic accessory factors, and that kilned material is also\r\nwanting in these two principles.\" The apparent contradiction between\r\npractical experience and laboratory investigation in regard to beer is\r\ndue to a difference in the process of brewing. Cook and Lind and the\r\nolder authors refer to freshly-made beer, whereas the modern beer which\r\nwas tested in the laboratory was made from \"high-dried\" material. The\r\nantiscorbutic potency of beer as formerly used was due to its\r\npreparation from freshly-germinated grain and its consumption shortly\r\nafter brewing. Dyke tells us of an interesting incident illustrating the\r\nimportance of this distinction. In the recent war an outbreak of scurvy\r\noccurred among the Kaffir labor battalion in France. At home these\r\nnatives consume a large amount, as much as three gallons a day, of\r\nKaffir beer, which is made from freshly-germinated corn, and is consumed\r\nshortly after it is made. The French prepared a similar fermented\r\nbeverage for their South African laborers, the sole difference in\r\npreparation being that the process of germination had been omitted for\r\nreasons of convenience. Scurvy resulted, a disorder which is practically\r\nunknown among the natives at home.\r\n\r\n=Miscellaneous Foodstuffs.=--During the past few years a great many\r\ndifferent kinds of foods have been tested in the laboratory for their\r\nantiscorbutic value. It will be well for completeness' sake to say a\r\nword about them, although they have been found to possess little or no\r\nantiscorbutic properties. The studies of Holst and Froelich showed\r\ndefinitely that all the cereals--oat, barley, rye, maize, and\r\npreparations made from the bran or from the endosperm--are devoid of\r\nantiscorbutic vitamine. Cohen and Mendel added 3 per cent. of calcium\r\nlactate or sodium chloride, or 5 per cent. of butter, without enhancing\r\nthe value of oats in this respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Failure of yeast as a prophylactic; latent\r\nscurvy promptly yielding to orange juice.]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, yeast possesses the water-soluble vitamine in marked\r\nconcentration. It is natural, therefore, that its antiscorbutic power\r\nwas put to the test, especially as it has been accorded therapeutic\r\nvalue. Hess and Unger showed that autolyzed yeast was of no value in\r\nthe cure of infantile scurvy (Fig. 14); Chick and Hume (1917) and Cohen\r\nand Mendel (1918) came to the same conclusion in regard to guinea-pig\r\nscurvy, making use of autolyzed yeast, yeast extract and dried brewers'\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that cod liver oil is practically a specific for\r\nhuman rickets, Hess and Unger tried the effect of this oil both in\r\ninfantile scurvy and in that of guinea-pigs. It proved to have no\r\nprotective or curative value. The animal experiments were confirmed by\r\nCohen and Mendel. The use of olive oil also proved futile.\r\n\r\nPitz in 1918 reported that in animal experiments he had found that\r\nlactose was able to protect against scurvy, and attributed this result\r\nto its power to alter the intestinal flora. We shall not enter into a\r\ndetailed discussion of this question, as the study was carried out on a\r\nration embodying unlimited and uncontrolled amounts of milk, and it has\r\nsince been shown that the apparent cure was due to an increased\r\nconsumption of milk by the animals in the progress of the experiment.\r\nCohen and Mendel, Harden and Zilva, Hart, Steenbock and Smith (1919) all\r\nfailed to protect or to cure their animals with lactose when they were\r\nplaced on a ration which was definitely measured and limited. Hess and\r\nUnger failed to cure infantile scurvy by means of lactose.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that scurvy is due to a lack of secretion of the\r\nendocrine glands, a question which will be referred to again in\r\nconsidering the relation of scurvy to other \"deficiency diseases.\" With\r\nthis idea Ingier added thyroid, hypophysis, thymus and parathyroid to\r\nthe food of guinea-pigs, or gave it parenterally. She was unable to\r\nobserve any beneficial results. Jackson and Moore met with the same\r\nresult on feeding desiccated thyroid gland. We may add that we gave\r\ndried thyroid and also parathyroid glands in the treatment of infantile\r\nscurvy without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nAny consideration of the question of antiscorbutic foodstuffs brings\r\ninto sharp relief the difference between empiricism and scientific\r\ninvestigation. For well over a hundred years it was generally known that\r\nscurvy could be cured by fruits or vegetables, and yet no further\r\nprogress was made toward a more complete understanding of the value of\r\nthese foodstuffs. As far back as 1847 Budd ascribed the action of\r\nantiscorbutic foods \"to an essential element, which, it is hardly too\r\nsanguine to state, will be discovered by organic chemistry or the\r\nexperiments of physiologists in a not far distant future.\" Busk, in\r\ngiving his testimony in 1877 before the British Scurvy Commission, said\r\nthat it was his belief \"that scurvy was due to the fact that the diet\r\nwas lacking in a peculiar and as yet little-understood factor.\" The\r\nquestion remained in this hypothetical and inactive state until it was\r\nattacked recently by experimental methods. Decided advance has been made\r\nonly in the past few years, since these foodstuffs have been studied\r\nfrom a quantitative viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe antiscorbutic factor is abundant in fresh foods, especially in\r\nvegetables and fruits, and to a considerably less extent in animal\r\nfoods, such as milk, meat and fish. Among the vegetables there is a\r\nmarked distinction in potency. A beginning has been made in\r\nstandardizing these various foodstuffs, in grading them approximately\r\naccording to their antiscorbutic efficacy (Table 3). It should be\r\nremembered, however, that the importance of an antiscorbutic food\r\ndepends not only on its intrinsic content of the antiscorbutic factor,\r\nbut quite as much on the amount of the food which is eaten. For example,\r\nalthough potatoes possess only moderate virtue compared with orange\r\njuice, they are of greater practical value in view of the large\r\nquantities which are consumed and their availability when green\r\nvegetables are lacking. Furthermore, the fact recently brought out that\r\nthe various vegetables, and perhaps the fruits as well, have\r\nconsiderably more value when they are fresh and young than when they are\r\nold, warns us not to carry our quantitative standardization too far.\r\n\r\nFruits and vegetables which are dehydrated have been found to have lost\r\ntheir antiscorbutic properties. This generalization is not without its\r\nexception, for it has been found that cabbage and tomato withstand\r\ndrying well, and that if milk is dried under favorable conditions it\r\nretains a very large part of its antiscorbutic value. It may be stated\r\nthat the outlook is bright in regard to dehydration, as the problem has\r\nnot yet been thoroughly studied, and the process may be so improved that\r\nthere will be little difference in the nutritional value between the\r\nfresh and the dehydrated food.\r\n\r\nThe study of antiscorbutic values points a lesson in regard to the\r\nmethods of cooking vegetables. It has demonstrated that short cooking,\r\nassociated with a high degree of temperature, is less deleterious than\r\nlonger cooking at a low degree. In other words, that less damage is\r\nbrought about by boiling or by steaming vegetables than by stewing them.\r\nHere age and freshness again play a rôle; in fact, a double rôle, as the\r\nolder and tougher vegetables contain not only less antiscorbutic, but\r\nrequire more prolonged cooking.\r\n\r\nIn general, the belief is correct that canning destroys the\r\nantiscorbutic value of foods, but once more an exception must be made,\r\nfor it has been found that acid foods, such as the tomato, withstand the\r\ncanning process with but little loss of potency.\r\n\r\nThe field of antiscorbutic foodstuffs is one which is fertile for future\r\ninvestigation. The antiscorbutic status of milk heated to various\r\nheights of temperature and subjected to various degrees of aging\r\nfurnishes problems of great practical importance. A lack of growth has\r\nbeen noted when antiscorbutics are given which have been subjected to a\r\nhigh degree of heat (_e.g._, autoclaved orange juice). Whether this is\r\ndue to the destruction of some other growth factor is a question which\r\nhas been raised by several experimental studies and requires an answer.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that we shall find useful antiscorbutic foods which\r\nat present are unknown or unappreciated. The recent introduction of the\r\nswede, of the canned tomato and of germinated pulses suggests and even\r\nrenders this probable. On the other hand, the recognition of the\r\ncomparative poverty of the antiscorbutic factor in lime juice shows the\r\nimportance of putting each foodstuff to the experimental test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe identity of scurvy in the infant, in the young child and in the\r\nadult is thoroughly established and requires no further substantiation.\r\nThere are, however, sufficient differences between the symptoms of adult\r\nscurvy and those of Barlow's disease to render it advisable to consider\r\nthem separately. These distinctions are due largely to the fact that the\r\nformer disorder affects mature tissues, whereas the latter is engrafted\r\nupon tissues which are in the process of rapid growth and development.\r\nThe symptomatology is influenced also by the striking differences in\r\nenvironment--the passive, shielded existence of the infant, contrasted\r\nwith the active and exposed life of the adult. Although we shall,\r\ntherefore, treat adult and infantile scurvy separately, it should be\r\nborne in mind that, from an etiologic and pathologic viewpoint, such a\r\ndivision is artificial and is resorted to merely for purposes of\r\nclarity.\r\n\r\n=Adult Scurvy.=--The earliest sign of scurvy is usually a change in the\r\ncomplexion of the individual. His color becomes sallow or muddy, an\r\naspect difficult to describe, but one which is characteristic, and\r\nconstitutes an important danger signal to the eye of the experienced\r\nphysician. About the same time the patient loses his accustomed vigor,\r\nseemingly becomes indolent and complains of tiring quickly, and of\r\nbreathlessness. He may experience fleeting pains in the joints and\r\nlimbs, especially in the legs, symptoms which are frequently attributed\r\nto rheumatism. At this early stage the appetite may still be normal,\r\nthere is usually no loss in weight, but merely a general malaise which\r\nis significant, although in no way distinctive. Very soon the gums\r\nbecome sore, bleed readily, and are found to be congested, spongy, and\r\nsomewhat hemorrhagic at their edges. Absolute reliance must not,\r\nhowever, be placed on this sign for early diagnosis, as at times it does\r\nnot appear until later. Careful examination at this stage will disclose\r\npetechial spots on the body, more especially on the legs, at the site of\r\nthe hair follicles, or even larger ecchymoses, depending upon the\r\nhemorrhagic tendency of the individual, his exposure to bruising, the\r\nadequacy of his diet, and secondary infection. Less frequently bleeding\r\nfrom the nose occurs early, or the eyelid suddenly becomes swollen and\r\npurple, or the urine shows the presence of blood.\r\n\r\nThese signs progress steadily with a varying degree of rapidity. The\r\ncomplexion becomes more dingy and somewhat brownish, the weakness\r\nincreases so that the slightest exertion causes breathlessness and\r\npalpitation, and the gums become spongy and even fungous. If there is\r\ninfection of the gums and the teeth are carious, the breath is extremely\r\nfoul--a sign long associated with scurvy. Later the teeth become loose\r\nand may fall out, and the alveolar process undergoes necrosis. The\r\nsurface hemorrhages increase in severity, large effusions appearing on\r\nthe trunk, on the extremities, and less often beneath the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth. A bloody diarrhoea may take the place of the\r\nconstipation which is generally noted earlier in the disease. There are\r\nat this time hemorrhages into the muscles and deeper tissues, especially\r\ninto the calves of the legs, giving rise to hard, brawny, tender\r\nswellings which have been termed \"scurvy sclerosis.\" This is sometimes\r\nthe earliest sign noted by the patient and may puzzle the physician who\r\nhas not met with it before. The swelling may be found in the popliteal\r\nspace or at the site of the tendo Achilles, and result in lameness and\r\ncontracture of the neighboring joint. Frequently there is slight edema\r\nof the ankles associated with a glossiness of the extensor surfaces of\r\nthe legs. This infiltration differs from ordinary edema in being firm\r\nand not pitting on pressure. The skin is dry and rough, the follicles\r\nbeing unusually elevated;[46] the hair likewise is dry and loses its\r\nlustre. Not infrequently subperiosteal hemorrhages occur, giving rise to\r\nexquisitely tender swellings, especially of the tibia or of the femur,\r\nor of the ramus of the lower jaw, as has been noted in connection with\r\nguinea-pig scurvy. If there are wounds or ulcers they assume a\r\nhemorrhagic aspect, the edges becoming bluish or livid and showing no\r\ntendency to heal; even scars which have existed for many years change in\r\ncolor and show an altered state of nutrition, and ulcers long healed\r\nbreak out afresh.\r\n\r\n[46] As the result of an experience with thousands of cases of scurvy in\r\nthe Serbian army, Wiltshire has recently laid great emphasis on this\r\nfollicular hyperkeratosis. He states that the earliest recognizable sign\r\nof scurvy is an enlargement of the hair follicles of the inner and\r\nanterior aspects of the thigh and upper leg, which show numerous conical\r\nelevations about the size of a pin's head. A hair, broken or unbroken,\r\nfrequently pierces the follicle.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the disease usually does not reach this stage, and rarely\r\nprogresses further. If, however, the patient remains untreated, he\r\nbecomes progressively weaker and more lethargic; there is frequent\r\npalpitation, shortness of breath, and increasing loss of weight. The\r\npains in the limbs render him helpless and an object of pity. Marked\r\nedema may be added to the picture as the result of starvation, so that\r\nthe legs become swollen, and even the face becomes bloated. Hemorrhages\r\ninto the skin as large as the palm of the hand appear on different parts\r\nof the body. The gums swell to such an extent that they overlap and may\r\neven hide the teeth and protrude from the mouth as foul fungoid growth.\r\nDeath comes about in various ways. Frequently sudden and fatal syncope\r\noccurs, due to heart weakness or to the pouring out of fluid into the\r\npleural or the pericardial cavities. Another frequent cause of death is\r\nsecondary infection, resulting in pneumonia, which finally ends the\r\nsuffering of the patient. The fatal outcome is thus described in the\r\nnarrative of Lord Anson's voyage:\r\n\r\n    \"Many of our people, though confined to their hammocks, ate and\r\n    drank heartily, were cheerful, and talked with much seeming vigor,\r\n    and in a loud, strong tone of voice; and yet, on their being the\r\n    least moved, though it was only from one part of the ship to\r\n    another, and that in their hammocks, they have immediately expired;\r\n    and others, who have confided in their seeming strength, and have\r\n    resolved to get out of their hammocks, have died before they could\r\n    well reach the deck. And it was no uncommon thing for those who\r\n    could do some kind of duty, and walk the deck, to drop down dead in\r\n    an instant, on any endeavor to act with their utmost vigor; many of\r\n    our people having perished in this manner during the course of this\r\n    voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThe disease may develop and progress in various ways. It may remain\r\nlatent for a long period and be cured by some accidental change of\r\ndiet, or, as more frequently occurs, it runs a moderately acute course,\r\nand is promptly cured by means of antiscorbutics. In the days when\r\nscurvy was common and widespread it sometimes became chronic, developing\r\ninto the \"inveterate scurvy\" of the older authors, which was notably\r\nresistant to treatment. Harvey, in his treatise published in 1685,\r\nstates that \"a mild scurvy may continue or be protracted to ten, twenty,\r\nor thirty years.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general picture of the disease which we have\r\npresented, mention should be made of other less common symptoms. As is\r\nwell known, one of the characteristic signs of scurvy is _hemorrhage_.\r\nIndeed, in many of the systematic treatises of medicine it is classified\r\nas a hemorrhagic disease. Besides the bleeding into the gums, skin and\r\nbones, hemorrhage into the stomach may take place, giving rise to\r\nhæmatemesis, or there may be hemorrhage into the eye, under the\r\nconjunctiva or into the anterior chamber, leading to the destruction of\r\nthe eyeball. A very unusual form is meningeal bleeding, giving rise to\r\nsymptoms of apoplexy. It may be stated in general that hemorrhage\r\ndominates the picture of scurvy. Eruptions which in normal individuals\r\nare simply macular or papular, assume a hemorrhagic character when\r\noccurring in a scorbutic individual. This phenomenon was noted in the\r\nrecent war in connection with the eruption of typhus fever, and has been\r\nobserved by military and naval surgeons in numerous expeditions.\r\n\r\nScurvy reduces the nutritional state of probably all the cells and\r\ntissues of the body. If the resistance is still further lowered by\r\nexposure, nutritional disturbances will result more readily than where\r\nthe tissues are normal and well nourished. For this reason we believe\r\nthat scurvy may predispose to _frostbite_. Reports of congelations\r\noccurring in the trenches in the course of the World War tend to confirm\r\nour opinion that scurvy was a predisposing factor in many of these\r\ncases. This has been true in other wars. For example, Munson writes that\r\n\"during the Crimean War the temperature was never very low and a report\r\nof the times suggests that the large number of congelations observed\r\namong the soldiers might well be regarded as gangrene owing to a\r\nscorbutic tendency exaggerated by the cold.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the involvement of the gums, another typical symptom\r\nof scurvy, it should be remembered that this sign may appear late and\r\ntherefore fail to be of value for early diagnosis, and that it occurs\r\nalso in purpura and thus may lead to error. This is especially the case\r\nif there is pyorrhoea. As is well known, hemorrhages of the gums\r\nappear only where teeth are present, and are absent in the edentulous\r\ngums of old people as well as in babies who have no teeth. Immerman is\r\nprobably correct in believing that an injury is always necessary to\r\nproduce a hemorrhagic lesion in scurvy, and that this explains the early\r\ninvolvement of the gums and also their non-implication in the absence of\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that separation of the epiphyses occurs only in\r\ninfants and young children, and not in the scurvy of adults. This,\r\nhowever, is not correct, as in severe adult scurvy there is frequently a\r\nseparation of the epiphyses of the long bones of the lower extremities\r\nor of the ribs, the latter resulting in a sinking of the sternum.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is sometimes slow and feeble, having been recorded as low as\r\n40 beats per minute, but more frequently is rapid, in the neighborhood\r\nof 140. It is, however, almost invariably unduly excited by emotion or\r\nby mild physical activity. Frequently there is a low type of fever,\r\nwhich has been termed \"scorbutic fever,\" but which probably should be\r\nregarded as a complication of the disease rather than as an intrinsic\r\nsymptom.\r\n\r\nThere is little tendency to the formation of pus. Although the lymphatic\r\nglands are frequently enlarged and effusions into the tissues and into\r\ncavities of the body are by no means uncommon, they show little tendency\r\nto become purulent. In the severe cases described by the older authors,\r\nthe breaking down of the glands in the inguinal region--buboes--is\r\nfrequently noted. The urine is apt to be scanty, becoming much more\r\nprofuse following treatment. Perspiration is also retarded.\r\n\r\nA peculiar symptom reported in connection with numerous epidemics of\r\nscurvy, both on sea and on land, is _nyctalopia or night-blindness_. The\r\npatients can see fairly well during the day, but have very little vision\r\nas soon as darkness develops. This phenomenon has puzzled many\r\nobservers, as nothing abnormal has been found on examination of the\r\neyes. Recently O'Shea, who met with many cases of this nature among\r\nsoldiers, has reported that in an ophthalmic examination of 22 cases the\r\nonly abnormality was pallor of the optic disc in 3 cases. This weakness\r\nof sight is due to the general nutritional weakness and has been\r\nreported in connection with other exhausting and nutritional\r\ndiseases--for example, hunger edema. More rarely there is day-blindness.\r\n\r\nAs a complication, dysentery may be mentioned. This has been described\r\nby Schreiber and others in scurvy epidemics occurring in the course of\r\nthe World War. Jaundice may appear, and might be expected to occur more\r\noften in view of the marked congestion of the upper duodenum found so\r\nfrequently at necropsy.\r\n\r\nPericarditis, hydrothorax, pleurisy with effusion, pneumonia, are common\r\ncomplications of severe forms of scurvy. Lind reports that the dominant\r\ncomplication varies in different epidemics; that on one cruise many\r\ncases of diarrhoea would occur and on another many pulmonary\r\ninfections.\r\n\r\nO'Shea reports the exceptional case of a man who was operated upon for\r\nacute appendicitis. A large hemorrhage in the wall of the cæcum was\r\nfound, as well as some other hemorrhages in the peritoneal cavity. This\r\nreport is interesting, not so much from a diagnostic standpoint as\r\nbecause \"contrary to what might have been expected, scorbutic cases when\r\noperated upon showed no particular tendency to hemorrhage.\"\r\n\r\n=Infantile Scurvy.=--The stereotyped picture of infantile scurvy and the\r\none which this term commonly suggests, is that of the acute form of the\r\ndisease. In _acute infantile scurvy_ we have to do generally with a\r\npoorly-nourished, pale infant with a peculiarly alert and worried\r\nexpression. As we approach its bed it whimpers or cries out in terror.\r\nFrequently its posture is characteristic, as it lies quietly on its back\r\nwith one thigh everted and flexed on the abdomen. Examination shows that\r\none or even both thighs are swollen and exquisitely tender, or that\r\nthere is merely tenderness, the baby shrieking at the slightest pressure\r\nupon the lower end of the femur. If teeth are present, the adjacent gums\r\nare red, swollen and bleed readily. This is the syndrome which the\r\nmedical student is taught to carry away to guide him in his everyday\r\npractice. It is the acute, florid type, and presents a striking picture,\r\nbut must not be regarded as the common form of the disorder. If we are\r\nto diagnose infantile scurvy early and not overlook its more subtle\r\nmanifestations, the classic textbook description must be augmented by\r\nportrayals of types of the disorder which are less crude and more\r\ndifficult to recognize--of \"subacute\" and of \"latent\" scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe commoner form, which we have termed \"_subacute infantile scurvy_,\"\r\ncomprises a large number of symptoms which are inconclusive\r\nindividually, and frequently escape correct interpretation. The affected\r\nbaby is usually in the second half of the first year of life, and does\r\nnot gain in weight or gains but slightly for weeks. It may be fairly\r\nwell nourished, but is pale or sallow, with perhaps slight edema of the\r\nupper eyelids. The mother or nurse complains that the child is irritable\r\nand peevish, and that the appetite is poor or capricious. The gums show\r\na lividity or slight peridental hemorrhage, which on subsequent\r\nexamination may be no longer visible, and may have consisted merely of a\r\nrim of crimson edging the borders of the upper gum, perhaps behind an\r\nupper incisor, as Still pointed out. On closer examination it may be\r\nobserved that the papillæ of the tip of the tongue are markedly\r\ncongested, and that a petechial spot is to be seen on its frenum, on the\r\npalpebral conjunctiva, or here and there on the surface of the body,\r\nmore especially where there are erosions, eczema or other skin lesions.\r\nAttention may be called to tenderness of the lower thighs, which in some\r\ninstances is definite, in others so ill-defined and fleeting that it is\r\nimpossible to convince oneself of its significance or even reality.\r\nThere may be slight edema over the crests of the tibia, of a kind which\r\ndoes not pit on pressure. The knee-jerks are almost always markedly\r\nexaggerated. The urine is diminished in volume but is generally normal\r\nor contains a trace of albumen and red and white blood-cells. The pulse\r\nis frequently rapid, and becomes markedly rapid and irregular on the\r\nslightest excitement. The respirations are also rapid (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\nThese symptoms do not constitute a rigid entity, but are subject to\r\nmanifold variations. The syndrome may be rendered less typical and clear\r\nby the fact that the infant has gained steadily rather than lost in\r\nweight, as is sometimes the case if the food has been insufficient\r\nduring the first few months of life. Roentgenograms of the bones may\r\nshow the \"white line\" at the epiphyses first described by Fraenkel (Fig.\r\n20) or a thickening of the periosteum. However, too great reliance\r\nshould not be placed on these signs in making an early diagnosis of\r\nthis disorder, as neither is invariably present.\r\n\r\nAn instance of subacute scurvy, which in many respects is typical, is\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    I. F., girl, was seen when 3 months old, weighing somewhat over 8\r\n    pounds. She was given Schloss milk, 4 ounces, and then 5 ounces\r\n    every three hours, and did well, weighing 11¼ pounds two months\r\n    later. As she failed to gain for some weeks, although getting 6\r\n    ounces of food, it was thought that this might be due to the fact\r\n    that she was getting pasteurized milk and had never received an\r\n    antiscorbutic. Autolyzed yeast had been tried as a prophylactic\r\n    antiscorbutic, but failed to bring about a gain. When, however,\r\n    orange juice was substituted for the yeast, a prompt growth-reaction\r\n    resulted, a gain of 1¼ pounds in four weeks. Accompanying this\r\n    lack of gain in weight there were many of the other symptoms\r\n    enumerated above; irritability, pallor, slight tenderness of the\r\n    lower ends of the femora, albumin and a few red and white cells in\r\n    the urine. The pulse- or heart-beat was frequently over 150, and the\r\n    respiration 60 (Fig. 15). The diagnosis of subacute scurvy was\r\n    substantiated by the prompt subsidence of all symptoms when orange\r\n    juice was administered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Chart of I. F., aged 7 months, showing a prompt\r\neffect on pulse, respiration and temperature of substitution of orange\r\njuice (30 c.c.) for autolyzed yeast (30 c.c.) and a further response\r\nwhen the former was replaced by potato (15 g.).]\r\n\r\nInfantile scurvy may be dormant for a long time. The diagnosis of\r\n_latent scurvy_ is based mainly on the reaction to specific therapy, on\r\nthe marked improvement when orange juice, tomato, potato or other\r\nantiscorbutic food is given. The symptoms themselves are suggestive, and\r\ndo not enable an absolute diagnosis to be made. In our experience with\r\nmany cases of this kind the usual course has been as follows: The infant\r\nhas been generally from 6 to 9 months of age, and fed for a considerable\r\nperiod on pasteurized milk, which may or may not have been prepared with\r\ncereal decoction. Nor has it been material whether gruels also had been\r\ngiven. When about 6 months of age the baby ceased to thrive, to gain\r\nsatisfactorily, to look healthy, and to feed as it should. The most\r\ncareful investigation or physical examination has failed to solve the\r\ndifficulty. On the other hand, the history of a diet of heated milk,\r\nespecially if the quantity was not large, considered in conjunction with\r\nthe pallor and poor appetite, the increased knee-jerks, and perhaps a\r\nrapid pulse and respiration (the cardiorespiratory syndrome), has\r\nawakened suspicion. Orange juice or canned tomato, prescribed in such\r\ncases with a view to diagnosis as well as to treatment, frequently\r\nbrings about a magic result. The following case, the weight chart of\r\nwhich is reproduced (Fig. 14), is fairly typical of this abnormal\r\nnutritional state:\r\n\r\n    H. S., boy, born December 15, 1915, was artificially fed until\r\n    January 4, 1916, when he weighed 6½ pounds. He was given 28\r\n    ounces of Schloss milk a day. (This was prepared from pasteurized\r\n    milk which was not heated a second time. It contains per litre\r\n    (quart) 140 c.c. of whole milk, 140 c.c. of 20 per cent. cream, 50\r\n    g. of dextrimaltose, 5 g. of plasmon, 0.2 g. of potassium chlorate,\r\n    and 700 c.c. of water.) By March 1 he weighed 9 pounds, and gained\r\n    three-quarters of a pound more in the course of this month. During\r\n    April he gained only 4 ounces. As will be seen from the chart,\r\n    there was almost a cessation of gain from April 10 to May 3,\r\n    although yeast was added to the diet. May 2, orange juice was given.\r\n    The weight advanced at once, the color and the general appearance\r\n    improved, and an eczematous condition of the face rapidly healed. It\r\n    will be noted from the chart that the gain occurred, although the\r\n    food intake remained the same.\r\n\r\n    Epicrisis: A baby 4 months old with latent scurvy, which existed\r\n    since he was at least 3 months of age.\r\n\r\n_This condition of latent scurvy is probably the commonest type of the\r\ndisorder, especially in the larger cities where almost the entire milk\r\nsupply for infants is pasteurized._ It usually passes unrecognized. Most\r\ninfants fortunately are given orange juice by the time they are 6 months\r\nof age, and may receive a small amount of vegetable or potato before\r\nthey are much older, so that they are protected from serious harm in\r\nthis way. But there is no doubt a considerable number, especially those\r\npeculiarly susceptible, who quite unbeknown to anyone pass through the\r\nstate of latent scurvy.\r\n\r\nIf this large group of cases were included in the incidence of infantile\r\nscurvy, we should not look upon it as a disorder which occurs rarely\r\nduring the first six months of life.\r\n\r\nWhen scurvy goes unrecognized or untreated for a long time, or the\r\nantiscorbutic content of the food is exceptionally small, or the patient\r\nunusually susceptible, the disorder may progress and resemble the\r\nadvanced cases described in connection with the adult type of this\r\ndisease. Happily such instances are rare. One of the most typical and\r\nvivid descriptions of _an extreme case_ of infantile scurvy is that\r\nreported by Vincent:\r\n\r\n    The infant lay in its bed extremely apathetic and barely conscious.\r\n    Its face was ashy gray in color, the respirations were extremely\r\n    frequent, the pulse-rate was 144 per minute, and the temperature\r\n    103.2°. When touched it moaned feebly, and made no attempt at\r\n    movement. The mouth was kept open, the lower jaw hanging away from\r\n    the face. There was a complete absence of muscular tone, so that the\r\n    infant appeared to be quite incapable of voluntary movement.\r\n\r\n    The mouth presented a horrible appearance. No sign of the teeth\r\n    could be discovered, though it was stated that several had appeared.\r\n    All that could be seen was a purple mass, which was so extensive\r\n    that on superficial inspection it was difficult to distinguish\r\n    between the upper and lower jaws, despite their wide separation.\r\n    Scattered over this purple mass were areas of necrosing tissue, the\r\n    odor of which was extremely unpleasant.\r\n\r\n    Petechial hemorrhages were distributed over the back and limbs, and\r\n    a large patch of extravasated blood was found in the region of the\r\n    left hip.\r\n\r\n    Tenderness was present in all the limbs, as manifested by moaning\r\n    and by the facial expression. There was a general enlargement over\r\n    both humeri throughout their length; the ulna and radius did not\r\n    appear to be thus affected, but the index-finger of the right hand\r\n    was enlarged, especially at the junction of the metacarpal bone with\r\n    the first phalanx, the enlargement being at each side of the joint.\r\n    In the legs the signs were extreme. At both knee-joints the skin was\r\n    tightly stretched over the swollen epiphyses; the tenderness also\r\n    was greater than at any other part.\r\n\r\n    Bleeding from the gums and nose had occurred; no history of\r\n    hæmaturia could be obtained. The motions were semisolid, green, and\r\n    offensive. During the last twenty-four hours the infant had refused\r\n    food.\r\n\r\n    The baby was given large amounts of lemon juice and subcutaneous\r\n    injections of salt solution and the necrosing surfaces of the gums\r\n    were scraped and swabbed with boracic solution. By the third day the\r\n    pulse was 100, the temperature 99.8°, the odor from the mouth\r\n    scarcely noticeable, and the general condition distinctly improved.\r\n    It continued to improve and to gain in weight and when seen at the\r\n    end of the sixth week of treatment it was doing well and was quite\r\n    happy.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to consider in detail the signs and symptoms which may\r\ndevelop in the course of scurvy.\r\n\r\n=Hemorrhage.=--_Hemorrhage of the gums_ is one of the characteristic\r\nsigns of scurvy. For a reason not clearly understood it involves first\r\nand foremost the tissues about the upper incisors. If, however, we fix\r\nour attention too narrowly to this region we may be led into error; in\r\nseveral instances we have first encountered hemorrhages about the molar\r\nor the canine teeth, which had been overlooked because the anterior part\r\nof the gums had been found normal. Where teeth are absent or not in the\r\ncourse of eruption hemorrhages do not appear. At the onset the gums may\r\nbe merely deep red or bluish red, especially if they overlie upper\r\nincisors which are close to the surface. Hemorrhage is particularly apt\r\nto occur where the edges of the teeth have just broken through the\r\nmucous membrane. In this connection the question arises as to whether\r\nevery hemorrhage of the gums in infants is to be considered a sign of\r\nscurvy. This is a matter of some diagnostic importance. We have seen\r\nhemorrhages of the gums at the site of erupting molar teeth where, as\r\nprolonged observation proved, not even latent scurvy existed. This sign\r\nshould not, therefore, be regarded as pathognomonic. In two infants\r\nentirely free from scurvy we have noted slight hemorrhage of the gums\r\noverlying incisor teeth. It should be well understood that such an\r\noccurrence is most exceptional; it is to be attributed probably to\r\nbacterial invasion or to a constitutional hemorrhagic condition. One of\r\nthese cases was the following:\r\n\r\n    The infant was 8½ months old. It had been nursed by the mother up\r\n    to this time and was well nourished, but when first seen had some\r\n    fever, probably due to a grippe infection. About ten days later\r\n    distinct linear hemorrhages of the gums were noted over the two\r\n    upper incisor teeth. No treatment was instituted for this condition,\r\n    and it healed within a week. There was no subsequent sign of similar\r\n    hemorrhage or of other scorbutic manifestation in the months that\r\n    the baby was under observation.\r\n\r\nThe localization of the hemorrhage in the gums is due largely to trauma,\r\noccasioned by the sharp contact of the jaws or of the nursing-bottle.\r\nLocal infection plays almost no rôle in infants, although in the adult\r\nwhere there is caries of the teeth it frequently incites hemorrhage.\r\nDental caries and gingival infection may lead to local hemorrhage, even\r\nwhere the nutritional conditions are normal.\r\n\r\nSubperiosteal hemorrhage is a sign distinctive of infantile scurvy,\r\nalthough it must be borne in mind that it may take place in the scurvy\r\nof adults. It involves most frequently the lower end of the femur and\r\nthe tibia, but occurs in connection with the humerus, the mandible, the\r\nscapula and other bones.[47] The hemorrhage usually manifests itself as\r\na swelling which appears suddenly at the lower end of the femur or\r\nfemora. It is brought about by trauma, at times in the course of\r\ndiapering, or by manipulation in testing for local tenderness. The\r\nswelling is very tender, and varies in size from an enlargement which is\r\ndifficult to appreciate, to one which renders the leg fully twice its\r\nnormal circumference (Fig. 18). It may involve merely a small part of\r\nthe long bone or extend up or down the shaft for a long distance. As\r\nmight be supposed from the nature of this lesion, the enlargement\r\npersists for weeks, frequently long after the gums and the general\r\nsymptoms have disappeared. During this period it becomes harder and less\r\ntender, and may develop the consistency of bone; it is in this stage\r\nthat such swellings have been diagnosed as new growths, and that\r\nincision or even amputation of the leg has been resorted to. In\r\nsubacute cases the swelling--which must be regarded as hemorrhagic\r\nrather than scorbutic--may be absorbed gradually in spite of the fact\r\nthat no antiscorbutic food has been given. This has led to the mistaken\r\nconclusion that the scurvy has been cured without dietetic treatment.\r\n\r\n[47] There seems to be some misconception as to the pathogenesis of the\r\nsubperiosteal hemorrhage in scurvy. In most reports this lesion is\r\ndescribed as if it resulted from a hemorrhage burrowing its way beneath\r\nthe periosteum and raising it from the subjacent bone. In point of fact,\r\nsuch an event is impossible, as will be fully realized when one\r\nexperiences the great difficulty in separating periosteum from normal\r\nbone. The scorbutic process involves the periosteum so that it is no\r\nlonger normal but becomes insecurely attached to the shaft of the bone,\r\nand is readily stripped off by hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nSubperiosteal hemorrhage may be clearly seen by means of the fluoroscope\r\nor in X-ray photographs (Figs. 16 and 17). The shaft of the bone appears\r\nsurmounted by an elongated blood-clot, which is more or less distinct\r\naccording to its age and density. It may become calcified, as clearly\r\nseen in figures. More often the periosteum undergoes calcification or\r\nossification, especially near the site of the separation of the\r\nepiphysis. This gives rise to a bizarre radiographic picture which may\r\nbe difficult to interpret--the opaque strip or streamer being almost\r\nunrecognizable as periosteum (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Infant 11 months old. Separation of lower\r\nepiphysis of femur. Fraying of end of femur and head of tibia.\r\nSubperiosteal hemorrhage surrounding lower part of shaft of femur, with\r\ncalcification of periosteum and of clot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Infant 11½ months old. Separation of lower\r\nepiphysis of femur with marked subperiosteal hemorrhage. Typical\r\nperiosteal \"tags\" or \"streamers.\" The connection of these \"streamers\"\r\nwith the periosteal layer is evident.]\r\n\r\nHess and Unger observed that in several instances where subperiosteal\r\nhemorrhage had been diagnosed, X-ray examination disclosed that the\r\nswelling of the thigh was due mainly to infiltration of the muscles and\r\nsubcutaneous tissue. It is surprising how an infiltration of serum gives\r\nrise to a swelling which resembles in appearance and consistency the\r\nclassical subperiosteal tumor.\r\n\r\nThe skin, mucous membranes and subcutaneous tissues are frequently the\r\nsites of hemorrhage. There is a difference of opinion as to how\r\nfrequently petechial hemorrhages occur in scurvy, particularly as to\r\nwhether they are encountered early in this disorder. Great variation in\r\nthis regard may be noted in individuals and in groups of cases occurring\r\nat different times. In the cases reported in 1914 by Hess and Fish,\r\npetechial hemorrhages were frequently an early sign, to such an extent\r\nthat they led to a study of the blood and blood-vessels in this\r\ndisorder. The hemorrhages in this \"scurvy epidemic\" were the result of a\r\ncomplication of scurvy with an infectious disease. It is not necessary,\r\nhowever, for infection to exist to bring about a rupture of the small\r\nvessels. The idiosyncrasy of the individual has to be considered as well\r\nas the fact that infants have a tendency to develop minute skin\r\nhemorrhages, especially such as have an exudative diathesis. In the\r\ncourse of scurvy, petechiæ may be found not only in the skin, but in\r\nthe mucosa of the mouth, especially overlying the hard palate, and also\r\nin the palpebral conjunctiva, identical with the minute petechiæ so\r\nsignificant of general sepsis. In addition to these minute hemorrhages\r\nlarger ones are not infrequently found in various parts of the body,\r\nespecially in the neighborhood of the joints. They appear as\r\ndiscolorations of various intensities and shades, and are often\r\ninterpreted as being merely the result of bruises. These have been\r\nencountered most often about the knee-joint, on the forehead, or in the\r\nconcha of the external ear, where they may best be seen by means of\r\ntransmitted light.\r\n\r\nA form of hemorrhage which must be especially mentioned, although it is\r\nvery infrequent, is that taking place into the orbit, leading to a\r\n_proptosis of the eyeball_, usually the left (Still). This sign should\r\nbe borne in mind, as it occurs occasionally before other symptoms have\r\nrendered the diagnosis clear, and may lead to a diagnosis of tumor.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, hemorrhages into the muscles or between the muscle\r\nplanes are very common in adults, leading to hard swellings, the typical\r\n\"scurvy sclerosis.\" Such effusions occur much less frequently in\r\ninfants, due probably to their lack of activity. In addition to these\r\nhemorrhages there are serous effusions of the muscles similar to those\r\nwhich are found in the pleural and pericardial cavities. These effusions\r\nare very striking at necropsy, when one incises the muscles--for\r\nexample, the muscles of the thigh. During life they are frequently\r\nmistaken for subperiosteal hemorrhages.\r\n\r\nLess frequently there are _hemorrhages into the internal organs_. These,\r\nhowever, play a comparatively insignificant rôle in the symptomatology\r\nof this disease. At postmortem examination we find numerous hemorrhages\r\nof the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum, which rarely produce\r\nsymptoms during life. Still records a case with marked abdominal pain\r\nand swelling, which he believed to have been due to hemorrhage into the\r\nwall of the intestine. As previously mentioned, O'Shea met with a case\r\nof hemorrhage into the cæcum which was mistakenly operated upon for\r\nappendicitis. Hæmothorax and hæemopericardium occur, especially\r\nassociated with local inflammatory processes of tuberculous nature. The\r\nclinical aspect of hemorrhage of the gastro-intestinal and the\r\ngenito-urinary tracts will be considered elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the scurvy of adults as well as that of infants, _the nails and the\r\nhair_ are altered by the nutritional condition. Mention has been made of\r\nthe hyperkeratosis recently emphasized by Wiltshire as an early sign,\r\noccurring especially on the thighs and legs. The skin is frequently dry,\r\nthe so-called \"goose skin\" that is seen in some poor nutritional states.\r\nThe nails are thin, brittle and lined; at times small hemorrhages will\r\nbe noted beneath them. The hair also becomes thin and dry, and there is\r\na tendency for petechial hemorrhages to develop at the roots.\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the therapeutic value of yeast and of wheat embryo the\r\nauthor called attention to the fact that _eczema_ may occur in\r\nconnection with infantile scurvy, and be cured by means of orange juice.\r\nWe have met with eight cases of eczema in infantile scurvy, which, in\r\nalmost every instance, have yielded promptly to an antiscorbutic, thus\r\nproving their scorbutic nature. A case of this kind is the following:\r\n\r\n    M. L., seven months old, was getting \"Molkenadaptierte\" milk, and in\r\n    addition autolyzed yeast. On May 25th it developed nasal diphtheria,\r\n    but soon afterward did well. On June 9th it was gaining, but its\r\n    pulse was 160 and respirations 80. A few days later it developed\r\n    marked eczema about the neck and to a less extent on the back and\r\n    buttocks. The \"capillary resistance test\" was negative.\r\n    Cardiographic tracings showed merely a simple tachycardia. A few\r\n    days later petechial spots appeared at the site of the eczema. On\r\n    June 17th orange juice was given. The appetite improved, the\r\n    cardiorespiratory syndrome disappeared, and the child began to gain.\r\n    The eczema also cleared up rapidly without any local treatment.\r\n\r\nWe wish to draw particular attention to this skin condition, as it is\r\ngenerally not mentioned, or has been regarded merely as a chance\r\noccurrence. The report of the American Pediatric Society includes two\r\ncases of eczema as a complicating condition. This symptom is of special\r\ninterest in view of the fact that a similar skin lesion constitutes one\r\nof the typical signs of pellagra. In a case of infantile scurvy we have\r\nseen an eruption at the nape of the neck which was symmetrical and\r\ngreatly resembled that of pellagra. Andrews refers to the occurrence of\r\neczema in his description of infantile beriberi.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published a few years ago attention was drawn by Hess and\r\nFish to the fact that infantile scurvy frequently is associated with the\r\nexudative diathesis of Czerny, a pathological condition which\r\npredisposes to the development of exudations of the skin and the mucous\r\nmembranes. Infants suffering from this condition--intertrigo, eczema,\r\nrecurrent bronchitis--seem to be particularly susceptible to scurvy and\r\nto develop it more quickly than others.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, _edema_ constitutes a not infrequent symptom of adult\r\nscurvy. It has not, however, been accorded any place in the\r\nsymptomatology of infantile scurvy. We do not refer to the edema in\r\nconnection with subperiosteal hemorrhage or separation of the epiphyses\r\nof the long bones, but a mild and peculiar form which is seen early in\r\nthe disease. It involves most regularly the upper eyelids, and the\r\nlegs--especially the skin covering the lower part of the tibiæ. In the\r\nlatter site it differs from edema as usually encountered, in that it\r\ndoes not pit on pressure; it is firm, tense, causing some glossiness of\r\nthe overlying skin, which is rendered difficult to wrinkle or to pinch\r\nbetween the fingers. Not infrequently the skin is slightly reddened, a\r\nsign of interest, in view of a similar, although much more intense,\r\nhyperæmia seen in pellegra.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this very mild edema there may be marked swelling,\r\nresulting in what might be called, following the terminology of\r\nberiberi, \"wet scurvy.\" The legs, body and even the face may be swollen.\r\nThis has been frequently described in adult scurvy, and occasionally in\r\ninfantile scurvy. The first case of infantile scurvy described in\r\nAmerica, that of Northrup, had marked edema of the scrotum. Edema is\r\nfrequently met with in \"ship beriberi,\" a disorder considered by some\r\nwriters to be a combination of beriberi and scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe symptom leading to the diagnosis of scurvy most often is\r\n_tenderness_ or swelling of one of the extremities, as the antecedent\r\nclinical signs, comprising latent scurvy, are generally overlooked.\r\nThese manifestations involve usually the distal end of the thigh or\r\nthighs. The tenderness is elicited most readily by pressure just above\r\nthe knee, which causes the baby to wince, and to quickly flex the thigh,\r\na reaction termed by Heubner \"the jumping-jack phenomenon.\" As a result\r\nof pain and tenderness, the leg lies often immobile in a state of\r\npseudo-paralysis (Fig. 18). There may be tenderness elsewhere than in\r\nthe long bones. Kerley refers to two cases showing tenderness of the\r\nspine, and we have seen a similar case. Not infrequently there is\r\ntenderness of the chest wall, the earliest symptom noted by nurse or\r\nmother being unaccountable crying whenever the baby is lifted by the\r\nthorax. This is largely due to the sensitiveness of the ends of the\r\ncartilage and bone which are pressed together at their junction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Infant with marked scurvy. Characteristic\r\nposture and swelling of right thigh.]\r\n\r\nAn early sign of infantile scurvy is _beading of the ribs_--the\r\ndevelopment of a \"rosary\" similar to that characteristic of rickets\r\n(Fig. 19). This has recently been described by Hess and Unger in an\r\narticle devoted to this subject. That this rosary is truly scorbutic and\r\nnot rhachitic is proved by the fact that it recedes rapidly when\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuff is given, and that it remains uninfluenced by\r\ntreatment with cod liver oil. A similar scorbutic rosary occurs in\r\nguinea-pig scurvy, but has been termed \"pseudo-rhachitic.\" It is\r\nimportant that this sign should be recognized, as it is probable that\r\nmuch of the confusion regarding the relationship and frequent\r\nassociation of these two diseases is due to considering the beading\r\nrhachitic. The interpretation of infantile scurvy as \"acute rickets,\"\r\nthe view held previous to the writings of Barlow, was based largely on\r\nthe development of the rosary. To-day the error is made of regarding\r\nearly scurvy as chronic rickets; the rickets supposed to be occasioned\r\nby a diet of condensed milk is probably more often scurvy. This beading\r\ndiffers generally from the round knobby \"rosary\" usually encountered. It\r\nis more angular, the junction taking on a step-like form, as if the\r\nabutting ends of the cartilage and the bone were of unequal size, and\r\nnot well fitted to each other. In the accompanying radiograph (Fig. 19)\r\nit will be noted that the \"beads\" present an irregular appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Same infant as in figure 17. Scorbutic beading\r\nof the ribs (rosary). This developed on a diet which included cod liver\r\noil, and decreased when an antiscorbutic was given. Note peculiar ragged\r\nappearance of \"beads.\"]\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 6, 16 and 17 will be seen illustrations of a _separation of the\r\nepiphyses_ of the head of the humerus, and of partial and of complete\r\nseparation of the lower ends of the femora. This is a frequent lesion of\r\nfully developed scurvy in infants, children, and even in young adults.\r\nIt is most frequent at the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the\r\ntibia, the head of the humerus, and the costochondral junctions. It is\r\nto these epiphyseal separations that the term fracture or infraction\r\nusually refers. Union is remarkably perfect even where no splint has\r\nbeen employed, and nature has effected the cure (Fig. 7). Occasionally\r\nthere is some deformity, as when coxa vara develops. The callus is often\r\nremarkably large; an old callus sometimes undergoes destruction in the\r\ncourse of scurvy.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to use of röntgenograms in connection with separation\r\nof the epiphyses, subperiosteal hemorrhage, cardiac enlargement and\r\nbeading of the ribs. In addition to its application in these\r\nconnections, the X-ray may be of service to show a peculiar alteration\r\nof the ends of the long bones--_the white line of Fraenkel_. This is\r\nportrayed in Fig. 20. It is best seen at the lower ends of the radius\r\nand femur, and appears as a white, transverse, somewhat irregular band.\r\nIts diagnostic value has been greatly exaggerated, as it is frequently\r\nnot present when the disease is advanced (observe radiographs\r\nillustrating separation of the epiphyses). This sign should therefore\r\nnot be relied on for establishing the diagnosis. Furthermore, changes\r\nmay be seen in connection with rickets (cases receiving antiscorbutic\r\ndiet) which are very difficult to differentiate from the \"white line.\"\r\nIt cannot be employed as a criterion of the progress of the case, as it\r\nmay persist for months after all other signs and symptoms have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Radiograph. Infant 14 months of age, showing\r\n\"_white line_\" at wrist some months after cure of scurvy.]\r\n\r\nThe joints may be involved in scurvy. In most instances, however, where\r\nswelling of the joints is diagnosed, the lesion is periarticular. An\r\neffusion of serum or of blood does occur occasionally into the joints\r\nand has been found at operation, at necropsy, and by puncture. If these\r\neffusions are allowed to go undisturbed, to be absorbed as a result of\r\nantiscorbutic treatment, they rarely suppurate. Czerny and Keller\r\nreport the articular fluid as invariably sterile.\r\n\r\nThe cardiovascular system has been given but scant attention in\r\nconnection with scurvy. Adults complain not infrequently of palpitation\r\nand pain over the pericardium, or rather of a tightness or oppression in\r\nthe chest. Little information is given regarding the size of the heart.\r\nDarling described enlargement of the heart, especially a right-sided\r\nhypertrophy, which he thought was pathognomonic of the Rand type of\r\nscurvy. The pulse is described in some cases as slow, and in others as\r\nrapid. In descriptions of infantile scurvy the entire subject is\r\ngenerally passed over without mention--for example, in the excellent\r\nreport of the American Pediatric Society nothing whatsoever is stated\r\nregarding the heart's action or the pulse. Barlow wrote: \"There is\r\nnothing to note regarding the heart and lungs.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper written a few years ago, it was pointed out by the author\r\nthat there is frequently enlargement of the heart, and more especially\r\nof the right heart. This can be elicited at the bedside and has been\r\nsubstantiated in numerous cases by means of the Röntgen-ray, which\r\ndemonstrates not only enlargement of the heart, but also a marked\r\nbroadening at its base, at the site of the large vessels (Fig. 21).\r\nThese phenomena resemble closely the description of Reinhard in cases of\r\nberiberi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Radiograph. Scorbutic infant 14 months of age,\r\nshowing cardiac enlargement and broadening of shadow at base of heart.]\r\n\r\nNecropsy protocols usually are incomplete and unsatisfactory in their\r\ndescriptions of the heart. The excellent monograph of Schoedel and\r\nNauwerk, however, which reports five careful necropsies, contains the\r\nfollowing data regarding three:\r\n\r\n1. Pericardial fluid somewhat increased, both ventricles moderately\r\ndilated, the right somewhat hypertrophic.\r\n\r\n2. The heart showed a hypertrophy of the right and left ventricles, as\r\nwell as dilatation of the right ventricle.\r\n\r\n3. The right ventricle dilated and slightly hypertrophied, the muscles\r\npale and tough.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this enlargement of the heart, or perhaps associated with\r\nit, there is a combination of signs which has been termed \"_the\r\ncardiorespiratory syndrome_\" (Hess). It will be noted in the above\r\ndescription of a case of subacute scurvy, that the pulse- or heart-beat\r\nwas frequently over 150, and the respiration 60. These phenomena were\r\nnoted in several instances before their significance and intimate\r\nrelationship to scurvy were realized. The heart-beat not infrequently is\r\nfound to be 200 per minute, and to be characterized by marked\r\nlability--increasing to an astonishing degree as the result of slight\r\nexertion or excitement. A mild febrile disturbance causing a rise of\r\ntemperature to little more than 100° F. will send the pulse-rate up 30\r\nbeats. It must not be thought that this refers to severe cases; the\r\nbabies we have in mind are similar to the one cited as an instance of\r\nsubacute scurvy. Apparently they are not ill, but show merely some\r\ntenderness of the thighs, pallor, and the other minor signs described.\r\nThe cardiographic tracings showed a simple tachycardia with an\r\nexceptionally tall T-wave in some tracings, such as is commonly seen in\r\nexophthalmic goitre (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Electrocardiogram in case showing\r\ncardiorespiratory syndrome. Tachycardia with exceptionally tall T-wave.]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of respirations is perhaps a more delicate indicator of\r\nthis disturbance than the pulse and has been found to be markedly\r\naffected when the latter was merely slightly increased in rate. For\r\nexample, in one instance the respirations were 64, 60 and 64 on three\r\nsuccessive days, while the pulse was 124, 141 and 136; in other words,\r\nthere was a 2:1 instead of the normal 4:1 pulse-respiration ratio. The\r\naccompanying chart (Fig. 15) illustrates the phenomenon in all its\r\ndetails better than a verbal description. There is one point in\r\nconnection with it, to which especial attention should be called. This\r\nis a reaction evident at a glance at the chart--the sharp drop in the\r\npulse and in the respiratory rate when orange juice was given. It is the\r\nessence of the phenomenon; a therapeutic response which proves that the\r\nrapidity is scorbutic in nature.\r\n\r\nThe main involvement of the _respiratory system_ in scurvy is the\r\npolypnoea just described in connection with the cardiorespiratory\r\nsyndrome. There is no aphonia, a sign so typical of adult and of\r\ninfantile beriberi, although at times the voice is abnormal and whining.\r\nThe lungs frequently show some dullness posteriorly, which may be due to\r\nengorgement or to the pressure of the enlarged heart. Pneumonia is a\r\nfrequent complication and edema a terminal event. Hydrothorax associated\r\nwith hydropericardium is of frequent occurrence, and was noted in the\r\nearly description of this disease in adults and in the first account of\r\nBarlow. These effusions rarely progress to what may be termed the\r\nclinical degree and under antiscorbutic treatment are rapidly absorbed.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly thought that scurvy does not involve _the nervous\r\nsystem_; that this is a feature which distinguishes it sharply from\r\nberiberi, another \"deficiency disease.\" This view is incorrect, for the\r\nnervous system is probably affected in many cases of scurvy. The\r\nrapidity and lability of the pulse, combined with the rapid\r\nrespirations, would seem to be due to a disturbance of the vagus\r\nmechanism. It is true that in beriberi the vagus is involved to a still\r\ngreater extent, especially its recurrent laryngeal branch which brings\r\nabout the characteristic aphonia. In scurvy the knee-reflexes are\r\ngenerally increased. Very rarely they are absent in infantile scurvy, as\r\ndescribed in adults. It is impossible to judge whether the pain and\r\ntenderness in infants are due in part to a sensitiveness of the nerve\r\ntrunks as well as of the periosteum. Careful studies in adult scurvy\r\nshould furnish an answer to this question. No methodical examination\r\nfor areas of anæsthesia or paræsthesia, signs which occur so frequently\r\nin connection with beriberi, has been carried out in scurvy. In certain\r\nepidemics, however, pains in the limbs have been prominent symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe optic discs are generally pale in both infants and in adults, with\r\noccasional signs of neuredema. Nyctalopia, so frequently encountered,\r\nmust be regarded as a circulatory symptom rather than as one of nervous\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIn a recent paper the author described a focal degeneration of the\r\nlumbar cord in a case of infantile scurvy, the lesion involving mainly\r\nthe anterior horn cells (Figs. 3 and 4). In view of this report it would\r\nbe well to watch for corresponding clinical signs of involvement of the\r\nspinal cord. Herpes has been described in connection with both adult and\r\ninfantile scurvy. In one of the early cases in the American literature\r\nFruitnight reported a case with herpes in a girl five years of age. In\r\nconsidering the rôle of the nervous system, mention should be made of\r\ncases where sweating constituted an important symptom. Finkelstein lays\r\nparticular stress on this symptom in infantile scurvy. We have not met\r\nwith it frequently; possibly it is due in part to complicating rickets.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected, the nervous system is at times the site of\r\nhemorrhage. Such lesions cannot, however, be considered essentially\r\nnervous. For instance, hemorrhage into the meninges may occur, as in the\r\ncase of Sammis, where there was \"a general clonic convulsion\" before\r\ndeath, and a blood-clot 2½ inches long by ½ inch wide was found at\r\nnecropsy between the dura and arachnoid. Fife reported a similar case.\r\nFinkelstein also has drawn attention to the occurrence of meningeal\r\nhemorrhage, and Hess and Fish reported obtaining bloody cerebrospinal\r\nfluid from a case with meningeal symptoms. Recently Aschoff and Koch\r\nhave depicted hemorrhages in the sheath of the sciatic nerve, which\r\nundoubtedly must have given rise to symptoms during life.\r\n\r\nIn view of many of these symptoms, especially those involving the vagus,\r\nscurvy must be looked upon as a disorder which may seriously affect the\r\nnervous system. Furthermore, when we note the marked reaction brought\r\nabout by the antiscorbutic vitamine--for example, the sharp fall in the\r\nrate of respirations and of pulse, as shown in Fig. 15, after giving\r\norange juice, we must conclude that the antiscorbutic vitamine\r\nfunctions, at least indirectly as an antineuritic vitamine--that it must\r\npossess this character to allay the various nervous signs of this\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nThe urinary system is frequently involved in the course of scurvy. Among\r\n38 cases Still reports that 89 per cent. gave evidence of urinary\r\nchanges and that 60 per cent. showed hæmaturia. Finkelstein found\r\nurinary signs in at least a third of his cases. Our figures, the result\r\nof a study of subacute and mildly acute cases, correspond more nearly\r\nwith those of Finkelstein.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of pronounced renal hemorrhage as a first symptom of\r\nscurvy is emphasized in many descriptions of this disease, and has\r\nimpressed itself in the minds of physicians. It is true that this occurs\r\nsometimes at the onset, as does hemorrhage into or about the joints, or\r\nhemorrhage behind the eyeball. It is well to bear these possibilities in\r\nmind, but they must be regarded as very exceptional early signs of this\r\ndisorder. We have encountered frank hæmaturia but once in the early\r\nstage of infantile scurvy. The blood emanates generally from the\r\nkidneys, although the submucous hemorrhages of the bladder as well as in\r\nthe urethra, described both in man and in guinea-pigs, indicate that the\r\nblood in the urine may have its origin lower down in the tract. This\r\nbleeding should be regarded not as a sign of nephritis, but rather as a\r\nhemorrhagic manifestation. It is less frequent in adults than in\r\ninfants. O'Shea reports some degree of hemorrhage in 15 per cent. of his\r\ncases (adults).\r\n\r\nA true nephritis, however, may occur in connection with scurvy. There\r\nmay be albumen and many casts, or a urine loaded with casts and\r\ncylindroids. These peculiar casts may appear suddenly, as in the\r\nalimentary intoxication of infants, and disappear just as rapidly when\r\nantiscorbutic treatment is given. The urine may contain a large number\r\nof pus cells as in pyelitis. This condition may be accompanied by\r\nirregular fever, but in two instances we have encountered it where the\r\ntemperature was normal. It is to be regarded, probably, merely as one of\r\nthe manifestations of secondary infection so commonly associated with\r\nscurvy. Some pus cells may continue to be present in the urine for a\r\nperiod of months. This is likewise true of the red cells. We have under\r\nobservation at present an infant which had subacute scurvy almost three\r\nyears ago and still has red blood-cells in the urine.\r\n\r\nOliguria is a common symptom of both adult and infantile scurvy. Lind\r\nmentioned this symptom, and in this connection remarks on the beneficent\r\neffect of antiscorbutic treatment. Charpentier called attention to the\r\nfact that in a case of scurvy the urine decreased from 1250 g. to 800 g.\r\nThe report of the American Pediatric Society mentions scanty urine in 9\r\ncases and suppression of urine in one. This sign, however, was not\r\nemphasized until recently, when Gerstenberger, and Hess and Unger drew\r\nattention to its frequent occurrence in infants. It has some diagnostic\r\nsignificance and should be borne in mind where a decreased excretion of\r\nurine is reported. A counterpart of this symptom is the sudden\r\noutpouring of urine frequently noted after antiscorbutic treatment has\r\nbeen instituted. This polyuria accounts for the loss of weight or lack\r\nof gain which sometimes accompanies unmistakable general improvement,\r\nand which is difficult otherwise to understand (Fig. 23). It is\r\ninteresting to learn that oliguria occurs commonly in both adult and\r\ninfantile beriberi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Joseph G., aged 9 months. Chart showing\r\nstationary weight (due to oliguria followed by diuresis) in spite of\r\nmarked variation of fluid intake. A=Schloss milk; B=cod liver oil; C=egg\r\nyolk; D=1 ounce of orange juice; E=potato (orange juice stopped).]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest, as well as one of the most constant symptoms of\r\nscurvy, is a _lack of appetite_. It is a typical sign of latent scurvy,\r\nalthough occasionally we have met with cases where the appetite remained\r\nunimpaired until the hemorrhagic stage was reached. In adults there is\r\nsometimes bulimia and a marked capriciousness of the appetite. Anorexia\r\nis a true scorbutic symptom, disappearing with remarkable rapidity when\r\nantiscorbutic food is given, and not capable of alleviation by tincture\r\nof gentian or other vegetable bitters. Whether it depends upon a lack of\r\nsecretions in the gastro-intestinal tract is not known, as there has\r\nbeen no thorough study of this aspect of the disorder. The hydrochloric\r\nacid generally is deficient in cases of scurvy. Recently McCarrison has\r\nlaid emphasis on the importance of the impairment of the digestion and\r\nassimilative function in scurvy. This subject gains added interest in\r\nview of the recent reports of Uhlmann as well as of Voegtlin, showing\r\nthat water-soluble vitamine acts as a stimulant for the various\r\nsecretions of the gastro-intestinal tract.\r\n\r\nAs a result of McCollum's statement that scurvy is due mainly to\r\n_constipation_, marked attention has been directed recently to the\r\naction of the bowels in this disorder. This question has been discussed\r\nin the chapter on etiology, and, therefore, will be referred to in this\r\nplace merely from the clinical viewpoint. In our experience the activity\r\nof the bowel varies greatly in cases of latent or subacute scurvy. In a\r\ngreat many instances it has been normal; more often there has been\r\nslight constipation, and exceptionally there has been irregular\r\ndiarrhoea. In other words, no causative relationship or parallelism\r\ncould be observed between the emptying of the intestinal tract and the\r\ndevelopment of scurvy. This in general has been the experience of\r\nothers. In the report of the American Pediatric Society the bowels are\r\nstated as having been regular in 74 cases, irregular in 15, constipated\r\nin 126, and diarrhoeal in 65. It may be added that we were unable to\r\ncure scurvy by means of liquid petrolatum or phenolphthalein, either in\r\ninfants or in guinea-pigs, and likewise unable to protect guinea-pigs\r\nfrom scurvy by means of various laxatives. On the other hand, opium\r\ngiven in the form of the camphorated tincture did not lead to an\r\nintensification of the symptoms, although, in one case, the bowels did\r\nnot move for over three days.\r\n\r\nAs complications involving the gastro-intestinal tract may be mentioned\r\nthe vomiting of blood, which is stated in the above report as occurring\r\nin 2 of the 361 cases, as well as bleeding from the bowel, which was\r\nnoted in 37 cases, in 12 of which there was bloody diarrhoea. However,\r\nthese are late symptoms, and correspond to the mycotic ulcers which are\r\nso frequently found, especially in the large intestine, in cases of\r\nscurvy. Mention may again be made of the fact that hemorrhages may occur\r\nunder the peritoneum and give rise to symptoms simulating appendicitis\r\nor general peritonitis.\r\n\r\nJaundice has been described in connection with certain epidemics of\r\nscurvy. To our knowledge it has not been reported in infants.\r\n\r\nThe presence of worms has been frequently reported in the bowel or in\r\nthe stool of patients suffering from beriberi. There have been no\r\nsimilar investigations in relation to scurvy. It would be interesting to\r\ninquire into this question, as it is quite possible that a lack of\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuff may favor the presence of parasites in the\r\nintestinal canal.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this consideration of the involvement of the alimentary\r\ntract, we would call attention to the relation of stomatitis to scurvy.\r\nAmong adults this is a common complication. In infants it is uncommon,\r\ndue to the absence of carious teeth and secondary infection; we have\r\nencountered it in but two instances. Stomatitis is of importance in this\r\nconnection, as it frequently develops on the basis of malnutrition,\r\nscurvy being one of the disorders which may constitute the substratum.\r\nSuch may be the case where stomatitis occurs in epidemic form--for\r\nexample, among large bodies of troops.

The characteristic pallor, which is one of the most\r\ncommon as well as earliest symptoms, is due in a large measure to the\r\nanemia. This anemia is of the secondary type, but has definite\r\npeculiarities, and does not resemble that encountered in the course of\r\ntuberculosis, rickets or marasmus. The hemoglobin is greatly diminished,\r\nfar out of proportion to the decrease in the number of the red cells.\r\nNot infrequently we will find a hemoglobin index of 0.5. Table 4, above\r\ntaken from the article on this subject by Hess and Fish (1914), brings\r\nout the details of the blood-picture. It shows that there may be a\r\npolycythemica, which may persist after the other signs of the disorder\r\nhave disappeared. Brandt has recently made similar observations,\r\nreporting in one instance over ten million red cells two months after\r\ntreatment. In soldiers suffering from scurvy Wassermann has encountered\r\ncases where, during convalescence, the red-cell count has risen to over\r\nsix or seven millions and the hemoglobin to 110 or 120 per cent. Under\r\nthe microscope the red cells show poikilocytosis, anisocytosis and a\r\nlack of hemoglobin; they are slightly enlarged, with the occasional\r\noccurrence of exceptionally large cells resembling the \"dropsical cells\"\r\ndescribed in connection with chlorosis. Sometimes a few nucleated red\r\ncells and myeloblasts are seen; megaloblasts are also reported.[48] The\r\nblood-picture bears a remarkable similarity to that of chlorosis, a\r\npoint of interest, in view of the fact that both scurvy and chlorosis\r\nhave been attributed to a disordered function of the endocrine glands.\r\nThe \"dropsical cells\" suggest a disturbance of the salt balance in the\r\nplasma. In some cases we have found a decreased fragility of the red\r\ncells, which also has been described in chlorosis.\r\n\r\n[48] Senator regarded the marrow in scurvy as being aplastic. Nobécourt,\r\nTixier and Maillet report postmortem examinations where the marrow\r\nshowed an increased number of myelocytes and nucleated red cells of\r\nvarious kinds. They consider the typical blood change an intense myeloid\r\nreaction of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe total number of leucocytes is slightly increased. In our cases the\r\nmononuclear cells have averaged 66 per cent., which is somewhat high\r\neven for infants. This has been the experience of Labor, who, however,\r\nalso describes an eosinophilia during convalescence, a phenomenon which\r\nwe have not encountered. Some describe a marked increase in the\r\npolynuclear cells, which, probably, is to be regarded as the reaction to\r\nsecondary infections. There is indeed a marked difference of opinion in\r\nregard to the morphology of the blood in scurvy in adults as well as in\r\ninfants. Some found a large number of one type of cell--for example,\r\nnucleated red cells, myelocytes, eosinophiles--whereas others have\r\nfailed to observe an increase of these cells. The divergent reports\r\nprobably should be attributed to the fact that the investigators are\r\ndescribing scurvy of various grades of severity, of different stages of\r\ndevelopment, or complicated by intercurrent disease.\r\n\r\nNobécourt, Tixier, and Maillet have questioned whether there is always\r\ncomplete recovery from this anemia, which is severe from the standpoint\r\nof hemoglobin and iron. The older authors reported instances where men\r\nhave been weakly and ailing for the remainder of their lives after an\r\nattack of scurvy. In some infants pallor and anemia may persist for\r\nmonths after apparent cure; however, this is the exception rather than\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that scurvy frequently is classed as a hemorrhagic\r\ndisease, and that hemorrhages play such an important rôle in its\r\nsymptomatology, a consideration of the factors concerned in the\r\n_coagulability of the blood_ is of interest. In an investigation (Hess\r\nand Fish) it was found that the oxalated plasma (of blood taken directly\r\nfrom a vein) showed a slightly delayed coagulation time--eight to\r\nfourteen minutes. The \"bleeding time\" carried out according to the\r\nsimple method of Duke was slightly increased. Holt reports a case where\r\na child bled to death following incision into an epiphyseal swelling at\r\nthe lower end of the femur. The number of blood platelets is increased,\r\nrunning parallel, as is usually the case, with the number of red cells\r\n(Table 4). This increase in the blood-platelets, recently confirmed by\r\nTobler and by Brandt, is a very exceptional phenomenon, and was not\r\nanticipated in connection with a disorder characterized by hemorrhage.\r\nThe antithrombin content of the plasma is normal.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was directed to a study of the integrity of the\r\nblood-vessels in order to account for the hemorrhages. To this end the\r\n\"capillary resistance test\" was devised.[49] In the majority of cases\r\nthis was found to be \"positive\" (the blood-vessels showing an increased\r\npermeability) and to become negative when antiscorbutics were given and\r\nthe symptoms disappeared. This shows that the cellular structure of the\r\nvessels is altered in the course of scurvy, and indicates probably that\r\nthis is an important cause of the hemorrhages. The edema of the face and\r\nankles, the outflow of serum into the body cavities and into the muscles\r\n(Barlow) must be regarded as other evidences of the inadequacy of the\r\nvessel walls. The tendency of children with exudative diathesis to\r\ndevelop scurvy is perhaps still another manifestation of vascular\r\nweakness. This point of view has been strengthened recently by the\r\npathological studies of Aschoff and Koch, who regard scurvy as a\r\nnutritional disorder in which there is a lack of some colloidal\r\nsubstance needed for the normal structure of the vessels.\r\n\r\n[49] A blood-pressure band, or tourniquet, is placed about the arm, and\r\nthe pressure increased until the forearm becomes cyanosed and the radial\r\npulse is almost obliterated. The pressure is then maintained at this\r\nlevel for 3 minutes. The principle of this test consists in subjecting\r\nthe capillaries and venules to increased intra-vascular pressure to\r\nobserve whether this strain results in the escape of blood. In infants\r\nthe pressure was usually raised to 90 mm.; in some cases it had to be\r\nraised higher in order to entirely obstruct the return flow of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe test is considered to be \"positive\" when the forearm shows many\r\npetechial spots. In normal infants petechiæ were almost always absent,\r\nor there were few to be seen. This is not a specific test for scurvy,\r\nbut demonstrates a weakness of the vessel walls, whatsoever may be the\r\ncause. It is found to be positive in the majority of cases of scurvy.\r\n\r\nWhen one makes a subcutaneous puncture in infants suffering from scurvy,\r\na small hemorrhage very often develops at the site of the puncture\r\nwound. This is not the case when one makes a hypodermic puncture in a\r\nnormal person or in a hemophiliac, although it does occur in cases of\r\npurpura. This \"stick test\" is not a constant sign of scurvy, but, like\r\nthe capillary resistance test, was found in many cases and disappeared\r\nwith the subsidence of the disorder. It shows that the cells of the skin\r\nand subcutaneous tissues are affected, and possibly that their\r\nthromboplastic power is diminished.\r\n\r\n=Nutrition and Growth.=--The general nutrition suffers in scurvy as the\r\ndisease progresses. It is a mistake, however, to picture the scorbutic\r\nindividual, either adult or infant, as in a state of malnutrition. Not\r\ninfrequently he appears well nourished, an appearance which is\r\nheightened by the slight edema of the face. Infants generally for a\r\nperiod of weeks or months preceding the onset maintain a stationary\r\nweight. This may be the only sign of the scorbutic condition. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    An infant seen in 1915 gained about one-half a pound during the\r\n    months of February, March, April and May. At this time it was\r\n    somewhat over 9 months of age and had never received raw milk or\r\n    other antiscorbutic food. In June it was given orange-peel juice,\r\n    and gained 2 pounds within a month. There were no other scorbutic\r\n    signs or symptoms, and no loss of appetite during the months of\r\n    February and March, although the baby was suffering from a\r\n    progressive scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe growth impulse of the body throughout an attack of scurvy remains\r\nunimpaired, being merely in an inactive or quiescent state. Fig. 14\r\nshows this very well, demonstrating that when an antiscorbutic food is\r\nadded to the dietary the gain may be abnormally great--there may be\r\nsupergrowth. Generally such marked increases are due to an increase in\r\nthe consumption of food, following the stimulation of the appetite.\r\nHowever, decided gain in weight may follow the giving of orange juice or\r\nother antiscorbutic despite the fact that the intake of food is\r\nmaintained at the same level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Development of scurvy in spite of normal gain\r\nin weight in a baby who had been underfed since birth.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be stated as a principle that the development of scurvy\r\nis accompanied by a failure to gain in weight, there are exceptions to\r\nthis rule. Under certain conditions the weight may follow a perfectly\r\nnormal course during the entire period. Fig. 24 illustrates this\r\nclinical paradox:\r\n\r\n    A baby was seen in January, when it was 7½ months of age. Toward\r\n    the end of February, in spite of constant and normal gain in weight,\r\n    he manifested unmistakable signs of scurvy--peridental hemorrhage\r\n    over the upper incisor teeth, which were erupting, and tenderness of\r\n    the lower ends of the femora. The scorbutic nature of these signs\r\n    were substantiated by their prompt subsidence on the administration\r\n    of orange juice. We explain the phenomenon as follows: This baby had\r\n    been starved in a two-fold sense throughout the first months of its\r\n    life--it had received a diet lacking in caloric value as well as\r\n    deficient in antiscorbutic vitamine. Its growth impulse had been\r\n    held in abeyance for months by both of these factors. When\r\n    sufficient calories were supplied in the dietary, growth was no\r\n    longer repressed, and a steady gain resulted in spite of the\r\n    continued inadequacy of the antiscorbutic factor.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that during the period of infancy undernourishment\r\nmust be extreme to occasion stunting of growth in length. In animals\r\nAron demonstrated that lack of nutrition led to a decrease of the fat\r\nand of the muscle of the body, but that the skeleton nevertheless\r\ncontinued to grow, and the ash content of the body to increase. In\r\nmarasmus, or infantile atrophy, the baby usually grows in length,\r\nalthough its weight remains stationary or decreases. In scurvy we have\r\nshown that there is frequently a definite retardation of growth in\r\nlength, an observation which has been recently confirmed by Epstein in\r\nbabies which developed this disorder in the foundling asylum of Prague\r\nduring the war. This fact shows how profoundly the metabolism must be\r\ndisturbed by this disorder. Figure 25 portrays this retardation in\r\ngrowth and the sharp reaction when orange juice was added to the\r\ndietary. It also demonstrates that the growth impulse remains unimpaired\r\nand capable of quick response when the essential food factor is\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Showing retardation of growth in length during\r\nthe period when no orange juice was given and supergrowth when it was\r\ngiven once more, O. J.=orange juice. O. P. J.= orange-peel juice. Lower\r\ncurve represents the normal.]\r\n\r\n=Fever.=--Fever frequently accompanies scurvy. It is generally of a low\r\ngrade, ranging between 100° and 101°, as may be seen in Fig. 15. There\r\nis a difference of opinion as to whether the rise of temperature should\r\nbe considered as truly scorbutic in nature, as \"scorbutic fever,\" or\r\nregarded merely as a condition grafted upon the nutritional disturbance.\r\nA phenomenon which might seem to argue for its essential scorbutic\r\ncharacter is the sharp subsidence on giving antiscorbutic food. On the\r\nother hand, this may quite as well be interpreted as due to a secondary\r\nreaction, checking the absorption of toxins or bacteria. High\r\ntemperatures--for example, fever of 103° or over--are attributable to a\r\ncomplicating infection and should lead to careful examination for the\r\nsource of the trouble; pyelitis should particularly be borne in mind. In\r\na recent case fever of uncertain origin disappeared following the\r\ntransfusion of blood.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered numerous _complications_ of scurvy, and shall\r\ntherefore not go over this ground again. Many of them are due to\r\nhemorrhages or to serous effusions in various parts of the body. Another\r\nlarge group in adults as well as in infants are the result of infection.\r\nThe respiratory tract is particularly susceptible, pneumonia\r\nconstituting the most common cause of death. In infants we meet with\r\nfrequent attacks of \"grippe,\" widespread occurrence of _nasal\r\ndiphtheria_, furunculosis and torpid ulcers of the skin, pyelitis,\r\notitis, adenitis, etc. We have encountered nasal diphtheria--with\r\ntypical bloody mucous discharge--so frequently in connection with\r\nscurvy, that where this local infection occurs among a group of infants\r\nthey should be carefully examined for latent or mild scurvy. Aschoff and\r\nKoch recently have laid emphasis on the frequency with which diphtheria\r\ncomplicated scurvy among adults (soldiers). Dysentery is another\r\ncomplication resulting from an invasion of bacteria. Local infections\r\noccur more often in adults than in infants--cervical adenitis following\r\ngingival pyorrhoea, \"bubo\" of the groin following infection of the\r\nlower extremity, abscess of the calf of the leg following hemorrhage\r\ninto this region.\r\n\r\nScurvy sometimes occurs in _epidemic form_, especially in the army, but\r\nalso, as in Russia, among the civilian population. This results when a\r\nlarge group of individuals have been maintained on a limited and\r\ninadequate ration, and especially where this nutritional condition is\r\ncomplicated by intercurrent infection. It should not be interpreted as\r\nevidence of the bacterial origin of scurvy. A few years ago the author\r\nreported an epidemic of scurvy in connection with an outbreak of grippe\r\nin an infant asylum. Twelve infants in one ward were affected. The signs\r\nwere atypical--an undue degree of hemorrhage occurring at atypical sites\r\n(Table 5). It will be noted from the table that the ages of the infants,\r\nthe distribution of the hemorrhages, the development of signs (in some\r\ninstances) in spite of antiscorbutic treatment, the sharply defined\r\nepidemic character, distinguish these cases from the scurvy commonly\r\nseen. This is an instance where latent scurvy was prematurely changed to\r\nacute scurvy by an intercurrent ward infection; an epidemic of grippe\r\nprecipitated a pseudo-epidemic of scurvy. It is important, especially\r\nfor army surgeons, to bear in mind that where latent scurvy exists a\r\nbacterial invasion will lend the disorder a hemorrhagic character. This\r\nhas been noted during the recent war in connection with typhus fever on\r\nthe Eastern front, and was remarked upon during the Crimean War and our\r\nWar of the Rebellion. Some years ago Wherry made a similar observation\r\nin the course of experiments with the plague bacillus--guinea-pigs fed\r\non a cereal diet developed far more hemorrhages subsequent to infection\r\nthan those which received cabbage in addition.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 5\r\n                       DATA OF EPIDEMIC OF SCURVY\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n       |Age|Weight| Site of  |       |              |\r\n   Case| , |_lbs._|  Hemor-  | Date  |      Diet    |     Remarks\r\n       |Mos| _oz._|  rhages  |       |              |\r\n  -----+---+------+----------+-------+--------------+-----------------\r\n  1.   | 6½|  9  6|Humerus,  |Apr. 19|Breast milk   |Grippe since end\r\n  J.

Recognition generally presents little difficulties for\r\nthose who have seen cases, but is a stumbling block where the\r\nsymptomatology has been gleaned merely from the textbooks. It has been\r\nour experience that medical students who were conversant with scurvy\r\nfrom a theoretical standpoint failed to diagnose a case presented to\r\nthem in the clinic. Where diagnosis is uncertain, the most important aid\r\nis an exact knowledge of the previous diet, and observation of the\r\nreaction of the patient to antiscorbutic treatment. These diagnostic\r\npoints should be constantly remembered in relation to the discussion\r\nwhich follows, and will not be reiterated in the differentiation of\r\nscurvy from the various other diseases.\r\n\r\nThe scurvy of adults and of infants are very similar. The main\r\ndifference is the subjective symptoms in the adult--pains in various\r\nparts of the body--and the fact that the gums are frequently the site of\r\ninfection and ulceration, as well as of hemorrhage. It might be thought\r\nthat when scurvy occurs in epidemic form it would be readily\r\nrecognized, but experience shows that for months it may permeate the\r\nranks of troops or the inmates of almshouses, and pass as rheumatism.\r\nThis is the cardinal diagnostic error in adult as well as in infantile\r\nscurvy--time and again, and in spite of urgent and repeated warnings,\r\npatients continue to be treated for _rheumatism_. Holt writes: \"In fully\r\nfour-fifths of the cases which have come to my own notice this\r\n(rheumatism) has been the previous diagnosis.\" Such has been our\r\nexperience. The diagnosis should not be difficult. In sporadic cases,\r\nthe individual has limited his diet usually on account of indigestion,\r\nor diarrhoea, or following some dietetic whim or medical advice given\r\nmonths previously. Where scurvy occurs _en masse_ it may follow an\r\ninability to obtain fresh food--as during war, on shipboard, in the\r\nTropics or in the Arctic regions--or be the result of a misplaced\r\nreliance on some article of food--for example, dehydrated vegetables.\r\nMore careful investigation will disclose that the \"rheumatic\" pains and\r\ntenderness are not in the joints but in the muscles and tendons. The\r\ncalf muscles are frequently painful and excessively tender and somewhat\r\nswollen or infiltrated; the hamstring tendons or the tendo Achilles may\r\nbe sore and slightly swollen and the site of slight subcutaneous\r\nhemorrhages. In some cases there is bone tenderness, pain on percussion\r\nof the shins or of the sternum. These signs may be accompanied by, or\r\neven precede, hemorrhages in the gums. The diagnosis of rheumatism in\r\ninfants indicates a lack of knowledge of pediatrics, as this disease is\r\nhardly ever encountered in babies under a year and a half of age.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to differentiate scurvy from _purpura_. In either\r\ndisease the gums may be hemorrhagic and swollen, there may be scattered\r\nsubcutaneous hemorrhages and pains in the limbs. Occasionally, as in a\r\ncase seen a few years ago, we may be forced to resort to the dietetic\r\ntest. A close inquiry into the previous diet, however, a history of\r\nprevious attacks of purpura, the number, and especially the large size,\r\nof the subcutaneous hemorrhages, and above all, the diminished number of\r\nblood-platelets, should make diagnosis possible. In scurvy the platelets\r\nare almost always over 300,000 per cubic millimetre, whereas in purpura\r\nthey are reduced to less than 200,000.\r\n\r\nIn the army it may be difficult to distinguish scurvy from _beriberi_,\r\nespecially if they occur side by side as in the recent English campaign\r\nin Mesopotamia. There may be a combination of the two diseases, a\r\npicture similar to ship-beriberi, regarded by Nocht as a hybrid of these\r\ndiseases. The diagnosis is rendered more difficult, as at times scurvy\r\nis associated with signs of neuritis. We shall have to depend on the\r\ninvolvement of the gums and the hemorrhages in scurvy, and on the\r\nhyperæsthesia, paræsthesia, and anæsthesia in beriberi; marked edema\r\npoints to the latter disease.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far had in mind frank and outspoken cases of scurvy. When\r\nwe come to consider latent or early cases, the diagnosis is more\r\ndifficult and may have to be merely tentative. All that need be added,\r\nin view of the clinical picture sketched above, is that this condition\r\nshould not be forgotten in treating adults who have malaise and\r\nindefinite \"rheumatic\" pains and, more particularly, in relation to\r\ninfants who fail to gain, whose appetite is capricious, whose\r\ndisposition has become fretful and who have developed the sallow\r\nscorbutic complexion. This warning is particularly opportune at present\r\nin the United States, where pasteurized milk is fed so extensively to\r\ninfants, and an antiscorbutic food is not always given.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the symptoms just enumerated, tenderness of the bones,\r\nespecially of the distal ends of the femora, should be sought for, the\r\nurine should be examined carefully for red blood-cells, and perhaps the\r\nends of the long bones radiographed for \"the white line\" of Fraenkel.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Comby with infantile scurvy is illuminating. Among the\r\nfifty-five cases which he has seen, the diagnosis was erroneous in\r\nforty-five, and among thirteen cases recently met with, the physician\r\nfailed to recognize the disorder in all but two. The infants had been\r\ngiven sodium salicylate, had been treated with electricity and massage\r\nfor the supposed acute poliomyelitis, or given mercury for syphilis, or\r\nincisions or trephining had been carried out for acute osteomyelitis.\r\nSome had been put into plaster casts for coxalgia or for Potts' disease.\r\nThis experience requires little comment. It should be added, however,\r\nthat in the course of an epidemic of poliomyelitis, such mistakes are\r\napt to happen, and, to our knowledge, did occur in the recent epidemic.\r\n\r\nIn regard to \"_the pseudo-paralysis\" of congenital syphilis_ diagnosed\r\nas scurvy, it should be remembered that this lesion occurs almost always\r\nbefore the fifth month of life. A history of previous papular eruption,\r\nthe bilateral enlargement of the epitrochlear glands, and the Wassermann\r\ntest should suffice to establish the correct diagnosis.\r\n\r\nBesides the clinical conditions enumerated above, we may add the\r\nfollowing, which have been confused with scurvy: Neuritis, hemorrhagic\r\nnephritis, calculus of the urinary tract, renal tumor, orbital tumor,\r\nappendicitis, peritonitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Holt writes as\r\nfollows: \"I have known two cases to be operated upon by eminent\r\nsurgeons, once with a diagnosis of sarcoma and once of ostitis of both\r\ntibiæ. Not until the subperiosteal hemorrhages and epiphyseal\r\nseparations were discovered was the nature of the trouble suspected.\"\r\nRecently we saw a case of fracture of the distal end of the femur\r\ndiagnosed as infantile scurvy; the baby had caught its thigh between the\r\nbars of the crib and snapped the bone in trying to extricate itself.\r\nFinkelstein adds acute endocarditis, hemorrhagic septicæmia with\r\nmultiple bone swellings, and leukæmia as having been confused with\r\nscurvy.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting account of scurvy in the Russian army during the\r\nrecent war, Hoerschelmann states that tired soldiers at times feign\r\nscurvy. They produce a \"pseudo-scurvy\" by means of scratching the gums\r\nwith their nails or rubbing them with tobacco, and at the same time\r\nbring about hemorrhages of the skin by means of trauma.\r\n\r\nScurvy in the breast-fed infant has been fully considered under\r\netiology. We wish merely to state again that one cannot be too cautious\r\nin venturing this diagnosis in a nursing baby. The great majority of\r\nreported cases are not scurvy, but bacterial infections, syphilis, or\r\nvarious forms of intoxication. In establishing a diagnosis the same\r\nprinciples hold as in the case of bottle-fed infants.\r\n\r\nThe most important consideration in the diagnosis of scurvy is to keep\r\nin mind the heterogeneous character of its symptoms, and the manifold\r\ndiseases with which it may be confused. Surgeons should be alert to this\r\ndanger when about to perform operations for osteomyelitis or bone\r\ntumor. The mistakes occur because cases are infrequently seen and\r\nbecause the signs, being dependent largely upon hemorrhage, occur in\r\nsuch varied locations of the body. Where diagnosis cannot be made from\r\nthe signs or symptoms, the most important aid is a thorough acquaintance\r\nwith the previous diet of the individual and observation of his reaction\r\nto antiscorbutic treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outcome of scurvy, as we encounter it in peace time in the Temperate\r\nZone, is generally favorable, so that it plays but an insignificant\r\nrôle in our mortality statistics. This results from the fact that we are\r\nabundantly provided with a specific remedy, so that if the diagnosis is\r\nmade early and treatment is prompt and thorough, the patient will\r\nrapidly recover and suffer no physical disability. Where antiscorbutic\r\nfoodstuffs are not procurable, however, this disease constitutes a\r\nterrible scourge, causing many deaths and spreading among an army, a\r\nship's crew, or among the civil population with the rapidity of an\r\nepidemic. For example, the ships of the East India Company in their\r\nvoyages round the Cape often lost nearly one-half of their crews, and in\r\nLord Anson's famous voyage round the world 380 out of 510 seamen\r\nperished from the disease. Moreover, if the antiscorbutic treatment is\r\ninadequate or the patient goes untreated for a long period, the cure may\r\nbe incomplete, a condition of malnutrition and weakness developing,\r\nwhich may persist for years. To appreciate this clinical condition we\r\nmust refer to the account of physicians who saw thousands of cases of\r\nsevere and untreated scurvy among the sailors, who were of necessity\r\ndeprived of aid until they reached land. Lind laid stress on a type of\r\nthis disease which developed under these circumstances and which he\r\ntermed \"obstinate scurvy.\" He writes: \"I have met with numerous\r\ninstances not only among the common seamen, but of officers, with whom\r\nit had taken such deep root in the constitution as to prove a lasting\r\naffliction to them during a great part of their lives.... Persons are\r\nlikewise subject in different periods of their life afterwards to\r\nhabitual rheumatism, pains and stiffness in their joints; and sometimes\r\neruptions on the skin.\" In his treatise on scurvy, published in 1685,\r\nHarvey refers to this chronic nutritional disorder as \"inveterate\r\nscurvy.\" He pictures patients who had gone untreated for a long time as\r\n\"molested with vagrant, ambulative, distending, creeping, vellicating or\r\nlancinating pains of several parts of the body.... They are often loose\r\nand subject to falling into violent fluxes of the belly, diarrhoea and\r\nlienteries.\"\r\n\r\nInfants as well as adults usually recover rapidly and completely from\r\nscurvy, the result depending largely upon the early recognition of the\r\ndisease. We must always bear in mind, however, that from a histologic\r\nstandpoint the cure is not simultaneous with the magic disappearance of\r\nthe clinical symptoms, but that months probably elapse before the\r\ntissues return to their normal state. It is difficult to give reliable\r\nmortality statistics for infantile scurvy, for so many cases are of the\r\nrudimentary form that percentages are necessarily misleading. Still\r\nwrites that in 5 out of 64 cases the disease proved fatal by diarrhoea\r\nand exhaustion. The American Pediatric Society reports 29 deaths out of\r\n397 cases, which gives a similar mortality percentage. When infantile\r\nscurvy was not so generally recognized by physicians the mortality was\r\nmuch higher, and we find that Barlow encountered 7 deaths in his first\r\nseries of 31 cases.\r\n\r\nEven when the child recovers it may not regain its normal health if it\r\nhas continued for a prolonged period in a state of chronic scurvy. It\r\nmay remain pale and fail to gain in weight in spite of a liberal and\r\nwell-balanced diet. Cases of this kind are not infrequent. In this\r\nconnection it is worthy of note that 4 of the 41 cases of \"coeliac\r\ndisease,\" an interesting intestinal condition described by Still, had\r\nscurvy just before or during the onset of the disease. This observation\r\nconforms to the experience that chronic bowel disorders often follow in\r\nthe wake of adult scurvy.\r\n\r\nIn adults the heart may be weakened by scurvy, and death may result from\r\ncardiac failure. Cardiac disturbances occur also in infantile scurvy.\r\nThis involvement might be expected, in view of the tachycardia\r\n(cardiorespiratory phenomenon) which is so frequent a symptom of\r\ninfantile scurvy. The heart may be rapid for months or even for years\r\nafter the disorder, and tachycardia may develop on the occasion of even\r\na mild infectious disease. For example, a fever of 101°, due to a common\r\ncoryza, may cause the heart-beat to rise to perhaps 180 a minute.\r\nChildren so affected succumb readily to infection, especially to\r\npneumonia, which may lead to sudden collapse followed by death.\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the prognosis of scurvy, as in that of other\r\ndisorders due to a lack of vitamines, is the marked susceptibility to\r\ninfection. Even latent or subacute scurvy causes a peculiar\r\nsusceptibility to diphtheria (especially the nasal type), to coryza,\r\nbronchitis, and pneumonia. A perusal of the literature shows that this\r\nsusceptibility was noted by the older authors in relation to adults.\r\n\r\nThe local signs usually disappear quickly without leaving any trace. The\r\nhemorrhages are absorbed and the eczema heals within a few days. The\r\nfractures unite promptly with the formation of an unusually large\r\ncallus. The urine, which may have contained red blood-cells or have been\r\nmarkedly hemorrhagic, quickly becomes normal and, in our experience,\r\ngives no further evidence of renal damage. Still reports, however, the\r\ncase of a frail child who had a trace of albumen in the urine two years\r\nafter an attack of scurvy. A rare local injury, which may lead to death,\r\nis cerebral hemorrhage. Recently Sammis reported a case of this kind,\r\nwhich was characterized by convulsions during life, and in which\r\nsubdural hemorrhage was found at necropsy.\r\n\r\nIf we acknowledge an individual idiosyncrasy to scurvy we should expect\r\na tendency to a recurrence of the disease. Lind was of this opinion,\r\nstating that \"by observations made on this disease, it appears that\r\nthose who are once afflicted with it, especially in so high a degree as\r\nthat squadron was, are more subject to it afterwards than others.\" It is\r\ndifficult at the present day to express a personal opinion on this\r\nmatter, as clinical experience is meagre and the scurvy of guinea-pigs\r\nis so acute that it cannot be used for comparison. Some of the\r\nrecurrences have been due probably to the fact that the patient had not\r\nbeen completely cured of his first attack. We have met with two cases of\r\nrecurrences in infants, one of which is of particular interest as it\r\nhappened in spite of giving lemon juice in the intervening period. The\r\nhistory was as follows:\r\n\r\n    In September, 1914, one month after the baby was admitted to the\r\n    institution, it developed scurvy of a moderate grade. It was then\r\n    six months of age and weighed 10¼ pounds. It was put on a simple\r\n    mixture containing from 24 to 30 ounces of pasteurized milk and was\r\n    given in addition ½ ounce of lemon juice a day. It improved, but\r\n    during the winter had bronchitis, otitis, enteritis, and later\r\n    furunculosis. In spite of the fact that it had been receiving an\r\n    antiscorbutic for almost this entire period, it developed scurvy\r\n    once more in February, at the age of 11 months, and when it weighed\r\n    14½ pounds. It was evident that this baby was peculiarly\r\n    susceptible to scurvy. It may be added that the second attack was\r\n    complicated by nasal diphtheria.\r\n\r\nIn this connection attention should be drawn to a peculiar and puzzling\r\nclinical phenomenon, which we have noted several times. Even if the\r\nantiscorbutic treatment is carried out incompletely and only for a short\r\nperiod, recrudescences may not take place. We have seen cases where\r\norange juice was given for merely ten days or two weeks--that is, only\r\nuntil all scorbutic signs had disappeared,--and yet the scurvy did not\r\nreturn, the infants thrived for months thereafter, but were merely\r\nsomewhat pale and undernourished. In the case of two babies which we\r\nhave in mind, the diet remained absolutely unchanged, with the exception\r\nof the short period of antiscorbutic treatment, but this seemed\r\nsufficient to bring about a diminished susceptibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Seek the cure of scurvy neither in the armamentarium of the physician\r\nnor in the apothecary shops. The druggist will be of as little aid to\r\nyou as the art of the surgeon. On the other hand, employ fresh\r\nvegetables, the juice of fresh antiscorbutic plants, oranges and lemons\r\nor the juice of those fruits preserved with sugar; in this way without\r\nother means you will be able to overcome this terrible disease.\" This\r\nreads like the advice of some modern therapeutist; it is, however, the\r\nconclusion of a physician (Kramer) who wrote on scurvy almost two\r\nhundred years ago, and shows that the treatment of scurvy has undergone\r\nno fundamental change in the intervening years. Our resources, however,\r\nhave been amplified by an increased knowledge of the relative value of\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuffs and by the introduction of some new ones.\r\n\r\n=Prevention.=--In the Temperate Zone, under ordinary conditions, the\r\nadult population consumes sufficient antiscorbutic foodstuff to protect\r\nit from scurvy. Under exceptional circumstances, however--for example,\r\nwhen the potato crop fails, or, in the case of individuals, when the\r\ndiet has been unduly restricted, scurvy will be encountered. This\r\ndisorder is still an important problem, however, in relation to the\r\nhealth of adults in the Tropics, in military expeditions and in Polar\r\nexplorations. From what has been stated in the preceding chapter, it is\r\nevident that, at the present time, no reliance can be placed on\r\ndehydrated vegetables as a protective agent. The recent suggestion of\r\nusing germinated dried pulses and seeds, under circumstances where fresh\r\nfood is not available, is practical and probably will be resorted to in\r\nthe future. To this end the pulses (beans, peas, lentils) are soaked in\r\nwater for 24 hours, and then kept moist with access of air for about 48\r\nhours at room temperature. During this period they sprout and develop\r\nsmall radicles. They are cooked in the usual way and have been found to\r\npossess an antiscorbutic value comparable to that of most vegetables. An\r\nindividual should receive about four ounces a day of these sprouted\r\nseeds. In the treatment of some Serbian soldiers suffering from scurvy,\r\nWiltshire found that this amount of germinated beans brought about a\r\ncure. There are, however, two drawbacks to their general use. The\r\nprolonged cooking necessary for their preparation reduces their\r\nantiscorbutic potency, and they have been found indigestible when\r\nconsumed in sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nUnder similar conditions canned tomatoes can be employed; they have the\r\ndisadvantage of greater bulk, but are a more potent antiscorbutic,\r\nrequire no preparation whatsoever, and are readily digested. They form\r\npart of the present ration of the United States Army, in which they can\r\nbe given \"in lieu of an equal quantity of potatoes not exceeding twenty\r\nper cent. of the total issue.\"[50] The necessity of including an\r\nantiscorbutic in the army ration has been recognized only in recent\r\nyears; during our Civil War and for thirty years thereafter there was no\r\nsuch provision. It was stated at that time that a general scorbutic\r\ntaint pervaded the troops--a mere euphemism for the widespread existence\r\nof subacute or latent scurvy. Even to-day the ration of the French and\r\nof the Italian armies makes no definite provision in this regard and the\r\nRussians provide merely for a variable quantity of vegetables.\r\n\r\n[50] We have been unable to ascertain through inquiries from the\r\nSurgeon-General's Office the nature of the experience which led to their\r\nincorporation in the ration, and whether they were added specifically as\r\nan antiscorbutic. They appear for the first time in the revision of the\r\nArmy Regulations of 1895. The only reference to the antiscorbutic\r\nproperty of canned tomatoes which we have been able to find in the\r\nliterature is in the excellent treatise by Munson on Military Hygiene.\r\n\r\nRecently it has been shown that lemon and orange juices (Givens and\r\nMcClugage) can be dried and still preserve their antiscorbutic value. It\r\nis quite possible that concentrated preparations of this kind will be\r\nserviceable for army use and in regions where fresh fruit or vegetables\r\ncannot be obtained.[51]\r\n\r\n[51] Since the above was written, an article has appeared by P. W.\r\nBassett-Smith (Scurvy: With Special Reference to Prophylaxis in the\r\nRoyal Navy. Lancet, London, 1920, I, 1102) showing that _lemon juice can\r\nbe prepared in tablet form_ and preserve its efficacy for at least three\r\nmonths. Each tablet contained the equivalent of 24 c.c. of lemon juice,\r\nand less than one-fifth of a tablet was sufficient to protect a\r\nguinea-pig from scurvy. This therapeutic procedure seems of great\r\npromise in providing an antiscorbutic ration for the navy or the army.\r\n\r\nLind makes numerous ingenious suggestions for preparing antiscorbutic\r\nremedies (Lind, pp. 7, 8 and 9) which have a practical as well as\r\nhistoric interest. (Appendix 1.) One of these includes a formula for the\r\npreparation of orange and lemon juice which may be preserved for years;\r\nanother gives a method for the preservation of berries and other fruits\r\nwhich are to be picked when partly ripe and put up in earthen pots;\r\nstill another gives the recipe for preparing a simple decoction of fir\r\ntops, which was found by the Swedes efficacious in preventing the\r\ndevelopment of scurvy among their soldiers. It is interesting that a\r\nsimilar practice was resorted to in Vienna during the recent war and\r\nrecommended as a prophylactic for scurvy in children (Tobler).\r\n\r\n_The prevention of infantile scurvy_, especially in its rudimentary\r\nform, is of great practical importance, because of its frequent\r\noccurrence. There is no question but that breast milk and raw cow's milk\r\nfurnish sufficient antiscorbutic vitamine, but there is a difference of\r\nopinion as to whether pasteurized milk, or milk that has been brought\r\njust to the boiling-point, or even sterilized milk, is adequate in this\r\nrespect. Much of this divergence of opinion is due to the fact that the\r\nvarious clinicians have not considered or stated the quantity of milk\r\nwhich they have found sufficient to protect, and also because milk\r\nitself differs in its antiscorbutic value according to its freshness and\r\nprobably also according to the fodder of the cows.[52] Without entering\r\nonce more into a discussion of this question, it may be stated that\r\nunless the cow's milk is raw, the infant should receive additional\r\nantiscorbutic foodstuff. Moreover, this supplement to the dietary should\r\nbe made as soon as possible, so as not to allow the vitamine deficiency\r\nand inadequate diet to exist for even a short period. In our experience\r\nthere is no contra-indication to the giving of orange juice or of\r\nstrained canned tomato, the two antiscorbutics with which we have had a\r\nlarge experience, to babies one month of age or even younger. The common\r\npractice, however, is to wait until the infant is five or six months of\r\nage, which certainly must allow a rudimentary scorbutic condition to\r\ndevelop. At the age of a month one teaspoonful of orange juice may be\r\ngiven; it should be diluted with water and sugar added if it is tart.\r\nThis may be administered notwithstanding the fact that a baby has a\r\ntendency to looseness of the bowels, as orange juice, as recently\r\npointed out by Gerstenberger, has practically no laxative action.\r\nOccasionally babies regurgitate orange juice, but the reaction usually\r\nceases after a day or two. If it does not, a small amount of an\r\nalkali--for example, limewater or sodium bicarbonate--may be added just\r\nprevious to feeding; in this state the juice will be better\r\ntolerated.[53] The amount of orange juice should be increased so that\r\nwhen the baby is three months of age it receives one tablespoonful.\r\n\r\n[52] It is not possible to say exactly how much raw milk a baby needs to\r\nprotect it against the development of scurvy. We may, however, reach an\r\napproximate estimation of this figure. We know that it takes about 2\r\nc.c. of orange juice to protect a guinea-pig against manifest scurvy,\r\nand about 10 c.c. to protect a baby. The ratio, therefore, between the\r\nguinea-pig and the infant in this regard would seem to be about 5 to 1.\r\nWe also know that it takes about 80 to 100 c.c. daily of fresh cow's\r\nmilk to protect a guinea-pig for long periods. If we assume the ratio of\r\n5 to 1, it would therefore seem that it would require about 500 c.c. or\r\na pint, of fresh raw milk daily as a minimum to protect the baby. (It is\r\nquite possible that a slight negative balance of the vitamine may exist\r\nunless a still greater amount is given.)\r\n\r\n[53] Orange juice undergoes a decided color change as soon as it has\r\nbecome neutral or very slightly alkaline, assuming a more translucent\r\nand far deeper yellow or amber color. This change may be utilized by the\r\nattendant in determining the reaction, thus rendering titration or other\r\ntime-consuming methods unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Hess and Fish recommended the use of an infusion of\r\norange peel in infant feeding. The peel was finely grated, soaked\r\novernight in water (1 ounce of the peel to 2 ounces of water), and a\r\nsmall amount of sugar added to this liquid. Animal experiments showed\r\nthat this preparation possessed decided antiscorbutic value. This\r\ndecoction may well be used for the sake of economy, and even when the\r\norange juice is employed the infusion of the peel may be added.\r\n\r\nAn antiscorbutic which vies with orange or with lemon juice in\r\nadaptability for infant feeding is _canned tomatoes_, as recently\r\nsuggested by Hess and Unger. Tomatoes are not in good repute among food\r\nexperts in view of the small amount of calories which they contain--only\r\nabout 100 to the pound--and are regarded with suspicion amounting almost\r\nto superstition by mothers and nurses as a food for children. In spite\r\nof this fact, it may be stated without hesitation that they are fully as\r\nwell borne by infants a few weeks or months of age as orange or lemon\r\njuice. In considering antiscorbutics, it has been shown that\r\nnotwithstanding the canning process and subsequent aging, they preserve\r\ntheir potency. The dose is two tablespoonfuls for babies over three\r\nmonths of age. The tomatoes are merely strained through a colander and\r\nwarmed (not cooked). To illustrate their innocuous character, it may be\r\nadded that as much as 6 and 8 ounces a day of this juice have been given\r\nto a baby under one year of age without producing untoward symptoms.\r\nThis antiscorbutic should have wide applicability, especially in the\r\nUnited States.[54]\r\n\r\n[54] There is no relation whatever between the acidity of canned\r\nvegetables and their possible contamination with tin. Experiments\r\ncarried out to determine this question demonstrated, for example, that a\r\n\"sample of red kidney beans showing the highest acidity contained the\r\nleast tin,\" and that those samples containing the most tin were all\r\nrelatively low in acidity. (Report of Conn. Agric. Station Bull. 200,\r\n1917, J. P. Street.)\r\n\r\nAnother antiscorbutic which can be used in a routine way to prevent\r\ninfantile scurvy is _swede juice_, prepared by grating the raw vegetable\r\nand squeezing the pulp in muslin. Chick and Rhodes report that this\r\njuice has been adopted for use in some of the English infant-welfare\r\ncentres. It should be given in about the same dosage as the tomatoes,\r\nand seems applicable where the swede can be readily obtained.\r\n\r\nFor babies over six months of age, reliance may be placed on the\r\nordinary household vegetables--potatoes, spinach, carrots, squash, etc.\r\nAttention should be paid to the amount which is taken, as one or two\r\nteaspoonfuls of a vegetable which is poor in antiscorbutic power, such\r\nas carrots or beets, will be insufficient to protect against scurvy.\r\nEspecially is this true if the vegetables are old and stale and are\r\ncooked for a long period;[55] some years ago two infants under our care\r\ndeveloped scurvy in spite of a small daily ration of vegetables.\r\n\r\n[55] Salant, in experiments on rabbits, found that old or winter carrots\r\ndid not have the same protective action against tartrates as young\r\ncarrots, although their diuretic action is the same.\r\n\r\nPotato in the amounts usually consumed is a valuable antiscorbutic. It\r\nis not an exaggeration to state that it is the main antiscorbutic\r\nbulwark of man. In giving baked potato to children it is commonly\r\nadvised to use the floury part just beneath the peel; this should be put\r\nthrough a sieve and mixed thoroughly with boiled milk so as to\r\nconstitute a cream; for younger babies it can be prepared with water to\r\nform a diluent similar to the barley water so commonly employed to\r\ndilute cow's milk (1 tablespoonful of potato to a pint of milk, cooked\r\nfor 15 minutes). Little reliance should be placed on beef juice in the\r\nusual dosage and none on eggs.\r\n\r\n=Cure.=--There is almost nothing in the realm of therapy which is so\r\nstriking as a scorbutic patient's prompt reaction to antiscorbutic\r\ntreatment. It is all the more marvelous as the cure is effected by means\r\nof foodstuffs with which we are accustomed to associate no specific\r\nvirtue. A magic result is seen frequently within 24 or 48 hours. A baby\r\nwhich has had a poor appetite, has been irritable and exquisitely\r\ntender, suddenly regains its appetite, is no longer fretful, and can be\r\nhandled without occasioning crying. Within a week, if the case is mild,\r\nall definite symptoms of scurvy may have disappeared, and soon\r\nthereafter the infant is thriving and apparently cured. A table is here\r\nreproduced (Table 6) from the report of the American Pediatric Society\r\nshowing the duration of treatment before marked improvement was noticed:\r\n\r\n                             TABLE 6\r\n    DURATION OF TREATMENT BEFORE MARKED IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTICED\r\n    ==========================================================\r\n    |  Days     Cases  |  Weeks    Cases  |  Months   Cases  |\r\n    |------------------+------------------+------------------|\r\n    |    1       19    |    1       47    |    1        6    |\r\n    |    2       58    |    2       27    |    2        4    |\r\n    |    3       46    |    3        8    |    3        4    |\r\n    |    4       26    |    4        1    |                  |\r\n    |    5       19    |    5        1    |                  |\r\n    |    6        1    |    6        1    |                  |\r\n    |    7        2    |                  |                  |\r\n    |    8        2    |                  |                  |\r\n    |    9        1    |                  |                  |\r\n    |   10        7    |                  |                  |\r\n    |   12        2    |                  |                  |\r\n    |                  |                  |                  |\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn most instances a gain of weight accompanies improvement. In not a few\r\ninstances, however, there is a temporary loss or cessation of weight,\r\ndue in part to an increased excretion of urine. Occasionally there is\r\nobserved a short exacerbation of the symptoms following the giving of an\r\nantiscorbutic--a swelling of the thigh or hemorrhage of the gums. A\r\nsimilar phenomenon has been noted in relation to the treatment of\r\npolyneuritis in birds and of beriberi in man.\r\n\r\nIn the cure of scurvy the same dietetic remedies are employed as in its\r\nprevention. Orange juice is the sovereign remedy, and should be given in\r\na dosage of about 2 ounces a day.[56] Canned tomato is also most\r\nefficacious. If these changes in the dietary are carried out, it is not\r\nabsolutely necessary to alter the food, although it is advisable to do\r\nso. Some writers, for example Neumann and Czerny, treat the disorder by\r\ngiving milk which has been scalded or brought to the boiling-point.\r\nOthers lay particular stress on changing the source of the milk supply,\r\nbelieving that the sameness of the diet leads to the occurrence of\r\nscurvy. Such, however, cannot be the case, as otherwise breast-fed\r\nbabies would be highly subject to this disease. In the report of the\r\nAmerican Pediatric Society one case developed on condensed milk and was\r\ncured by sterilized milk, and another developed on pasteurized milk and\r\nwas cured by sterilized milk and broths. These results are explicable;\r\nlarge amounts of milk were given to effect the cure. It may be said in\r\ngeneral that in addition to giving fruit or vegetable juices the milk\r\nshould be either raw or heated to as low a degree as possible (duration\r\nof heating as well as height of temperature). Furthermore, the\r\nantiscorbutic treatment should be continued for a period of months, as\r\nthe clinical improvement far outstrips the restoration of the bones and\r\nother tissues. It seems necessary again to call attention to the fact\r\nthat too great reliance has been placed on the use of beef juice, which\r\nhas been shown, both in experiment and in the clinic, to possess\r\ncomparatively weak antiscorbutic properties.\r\n\r\n[56] It is difficult to state the exact dosage of orange juice which is\r\nnecessary. One teaspoonful daily has failed to cure, and rapid cures\r\nhave been accomplished by giving one tablespoonful. It is well, however,\r\nto give a larger amount if it is tolerated.\r\n\r\nOrange juice may be given intravenously. This method may be resorted to\r\nwhere the patient is in an advanced stage of the disease or where food\r\ncannot be tolerated by mouth; for example, in cases such as that\r\nmentioned by Cheadle, where death took place owing to the fact that the\r\nantiscorbutic could be taken only sparingly, on account of the extreme\r\nprostration of the patient. For this purpose the orange juice is\r\nobtained in as sterile a manner as possible, boiled for about five\r\nminutes and is rendered neutral or slightly alkaline just previous to\r\nits injection by the addition of normal sodium hydroxide. Hess and Unger\r\nreport three cases where this procedure was carried out without the\r\nslightest untoward reaction. In one instance, improvement was noted 16\r\nhours after the injection. In view of the novelty of this treatment it\r\nmay be of interest to cite a case:\r\n\r\n    A baby 16 months old had hemorrhage of the gums and tenderness of\r\n    the legs, which were held in the characteristic flexed and everted\r\n    position. Eliminative treatment was tried without avail; Dover's\r\n    powder and warmth to promote perspiration; caffeine to promote\r\n    diuresis; and 2 tablespoonfuls of liquid petrolatum three times a\r\n    day to increase elimination from the bowels. Intravenous injections\r\n    of salt solution also proved of no value.\r\n\r\n    Four intravenous injections of orange juice were given--6 c.c., 12\r\n    c.c., 6 c.c., and 35 c.c. As was stated, improvement was noted 16\r\n    hours after the first injection. The infant was less irritable, the\r\n    gums no longer hemorrhagic, and the \"capillary resistance test\"\r\n    (that is to say, the development of petechial spots on the forearm\r\n    when a tourniquet was applied for 3 minutes to the upper arm)\r\n    changed from positive to negative.\r\n\r\nHarden, Zilva and Still have recommended the use of a concentrated lemon\r\njuice for the cure of scurvy, constituting a form of \"intensive\"\r\ntreatment. In four cases this proved to be of clinical value. Freise has\r\nmade use of an alcoholic extract of turnips, and Freudenberg of a\r\nsimilar extract of carrots. These preparations did not seem to be\r\nmarkedly potent, and therefore possess no particular therapeutic\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n=Non-dietetic Therapy.=--There is little to be done for the patient in\r\naddition to the giving of sufficient antiscorbutic. No one has reported\r\nsuccess with any drug. We have tried the use of atropin, adrenalin,\r\nthyroid and parathyroid extracts, cod liver oil, autolyzed yeast,\r\nlactose, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, etc., without noting any\r\nimprovement. Mercurials are stated to be positively harmful, especially\r\nwhen ulcers are present. The patient should be kept in bed, and exertion\r\nnot allowed on account of the involvement of the heart, which has led to\r\nsudden collapse and death. The gums may be treated with nitrate of\r\nsilver stick or tincture of myrrh. If there is fracture of the long\r\nbones with displacement, splints should be applied. Under no\r\ncircumstances should hemorrhagic effusions in or about the joints be\r\nincised. The patient should be placed in a room which is well aired and\r\nlighted, and should be handled and dressed as infrequently as possible,\r\nso as to avoid discomfort and pain. It is particularly important that\r\nintercurrent infections should be avoided by shielding patients from\r\ncontact with those who have infectious diseases, especially respiratory\r\ninfections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMETABOLISM\r\n\r\n\r\nStudies of the chemical exchanges in scurvy have been surprisingly few.\r\nIt is a field that should repay investigation, promising to afford a\r\nclearer insight into the intermediary metabolism in this disorder. One\r\nof the first to touch upon this question was Garrod, who in 1848\r\nreported that there was a diminution of potassium salts in the urine and\r\nin the blood of scurvy patients. In 1877 Ralfe confirmed the potassium\r\ndeficiency in the urine, but denied its importance from an etiologic\r\nstandpoint, as he was unable to benefit scurvy patients by administering\r\npotassium nitrate. He reported an increase of uric acid in the urine, a\r\ndiminution of the total acidity, and a reduction of the alkaline\r\nphosphates. Litten found the analyses of the urine very contradictory in\r\nrespect to potassium, but stated that beyond a doubt its uric acid\r\ncontent is increased at the height of the disease, although this\r\ndiminishes rapidly with convalescence. These few and scattered articles\r\ncomprise the sum of metabolic studies up to the last decade, and even\r\nduring the succeeding period they have been very few--so few, indeed,\r\nthat they furnish insufficient data from which to draw conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe first careful study of the mineral metabolism in a case of scurvy is\r\nthat of Baumann and Howard, published in 1912. Its conclusions are not\r\nvery definite. They may be summed up by their statement that \"chlorin\r\nand sodium were retained during the fruit-juice period, but excreted in\r\nexcess of the intake during the preliminary period,\" and that \"more\r\npotassium, calcium and magnesium were retained during the fruit-juice\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\nThis same year Lust and Klocman published the first metabolism study of\r\na case of infantile scurvy. The baby was 18 months old and the metabolic\r\nchanges were investigated during the active, convalescent, and \"the\r\nhealing stage\" of the disorder. This study seems to have been carefully\r\ncarried out. The fact, however, that the infant received 800 c.c. daily\r\nof slightly-boiled milk during the active stage, and was improving at\r\nthis time, may also have had a beneficial effect on the metabolism in\r\nrespect to scurvy. The results of these writers are surprising--quite\r\ndifferent from what they expected or what we should have expected. They\r\nwrite: \"The balance of the mineral metabolism, including the total ash,\r\nthe calcium, phosphorus and chlorin during the florid stage of the\r\ndisease must be regarded not only as not damaged, compared to that of\r\nthe healthy child, but indeed as somewhat increased.\" \"All the more\r\nstriking, on the contrary, are the results found during the stage of\r\nconvalescence. Here the balances were all markedly negative, and only\r\nafter a lapse of weeks was the tendency manifested to a return to normal\r\nconditions.\" The authors regard these results as indicating a sort of\r\nwashing out of \"dead material\" during convalescence--of material which\r\nhad gathered during the florid stage of the disease. According to their\r\ninterpretation the disease is due, not to a primary or secondary salt\r\ndeficiency, but to a disturbance in salt elimination, and in the first\r\nplace, of a calcium excretion. This is shown by the fact that even in\r\nthe \"stage of healing,\" when the total ash and the phosphorus balance\r\nonce more had become positive, the calcium balance nevertheless remained\r\nsomewhat negative. The metabolism of infantile scurvy, they believe, far\r\nfrom showing a resemblance to rickets, manifests quite the contrary\r\ntendency. The study of this case of infantile scurvy and that of Baumann\r\nand Howard of a case of adult scurvy, comprise the total investigation\r\nof the metabolism in human scurvy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a recent discussion on rickets before the Medical\r\nSociety of Vienna, Moll states briefly that in a case of infantile\r\nscurvy, at the height of the disease, he found a positive calcium\r\nbalance, which became poor and later negative on giving fruit juice; in\r\nother words, a partial confirmation of the work which has just been\r\ncited.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Bahrdt and Edelstein reported the analyses of the organs of an\r\ninfant almost nine months old who died of scurvy; an examination of the\r\ntissues, especially of the bones, should be most valuable in checking up\r\ndeterminations of the metabolism during life. This investigation runs\r\nabsolutely contrary to that of Lust and Klocman. The bones showed a\r\ndecrease of ash, especially of calcium and of phosphorus, and also a\r\nlack of calcium in the muscles, but normal amounts in the liver and in\r\nthe kidneys. These conditions resemble the deficiency of ash and of lime\r\ncommonly associated with rickets, and it seems quite possible that this\r\ninfant had rickets as well as scurvy, and that in this way the\r\ndiscrepancy between the two reports is to be explained. The fact that\r\nthe water content of the bones was two to three times the normal, also\r\nlends emphasis to this interpretation. _In any metabolism study of\r\ninfantile scurvy, great care will have to be exercised that the disorder\r\nis not complicated by rickets_, and the issue thereby confused. It will\r\nbe very difficult to avoid this pitfall, for there is no test by which\r\nearly rickets can be diagnosed. The danger of this complication may be\r\nrealized when we bear in mind that the majority of infants have rickets\r\nto some degree. An investigation of the chemistry of adult scurvy has an\r\nadvantage from this point of view.\r\n\r\nChemical examination of the blood has yielded such valuable information\r\nregarding metabolic diseases, that it might be expected to shed light on\r\nthe disturbances of scurvy. The only investigation from this standpoint\r\nis that of Hess and Killian, who have reported estimations of the urea,\r\ncreatinine, sugar, CO_{2} combining power, diastase, cholesterol,\r\nchlorine and calcium.[57] The urea content was normal, varying between\r\n12 and 14 mg. per 100 c.c. of blood; this is the average of twenty-one\r\ntests on ten cases of infantile scurvy. (In severe cases of beriberi\r\nYano and Nemoti have recently reported that the blood contains an\r\nincrease of urea, and that its excretion is frequently disturbed.) The\r\ncreatinine was estimated in two cases and was found to be 2.0 mg. and\r\n1.7 mg. per cent., respectively,--also normal figures. The blood sugar\r\nvaried from 0.12 to 0.14 per cent. and was examined in almost all the\r\ncases in which urea was estimated; these figures are at the upper level\r\nof normality (no attention was paid to the interval elapsing between the\r\nfeeding and the withdrawal of the blood). The diastatic activity was\r\nlikewise normal. The CO_{2} combining power showed figures under 40 to\r\n45, according to the Van Slyke method, and indicated therefore a mild\r\ndegree of acidosis. In six cases the chlorides were estimated, the\r\nfigures being remarkably constant at about 0.42 or 0.43. Cholesterol was\r\na little below normal in the four cases examined. Contradictory results\r\nwere obtained in regard to calcium. Earlier tests showed a definite\r\ndeficiency of this salt, but those carried out more recently have\r\ngenerally yielded normal results. Further studies of the blood calcium\r\nare highly desirable to ascertain whether it varies in amount in the\r\ncirculation, and especially in different stages of the disease. This\r\naspect is worthy of particular attention in view of the positive calcium\r\nbalance noted by Lust and Klocman during the active stage of scurvy, and\r\nthe negative balance during the period of convalescence.\r\n\r\n[57] Almost all of these cases were receiving liberal daily amounts of\r\ncod liver oil, which should exclude the possibility of complicating\r\nrickets.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the limited data concerning the blood chemistry of\r\nscurvy that it is a field which has been inadequately explored and will\r\nrepay more intensive study. Investigations of this kind have recently\r\nbeen made possible by the introduction of accurate methods requiring\r\nonly small quantities of blood.\r\n\r\nStudies of the metabolism of animals suffering from scurvy are almost as\r\nfew as those on man. The work of Morgan and Beger, which is frequently\r\nquoted in this connection, is not applicable, as it concerns rabbits,\r\nwhich do not develop scurvy. They found that rabbits fed solely on oats\r\nand water suffered in their nutrition (loss of appetite, emaciation,\r\nparalysis of hind legs), and could be cured by the addition of sodium\r\nbicarbonate to the dietary. In 1916 Lewis and Karr published a paper on\r\nthe constituents of the blood and the tissues of guinea-pigs fed on an\r\nexclusive oat diet. They found the urea content several times greater\r\nthan normal, but that it fell to normal once more if cabbage or orange\r\njuice was given. From the standpoint of scurvy, this investigation is\r\nopen to the criticism that the diet was too incomplete, and also, as the\r\nauthors suggest, that the animals suffered from partial starvation and a\r\nlack of water.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Karr and Lewis published a paper on a different\r\nphase of this subject, and came to the following conclusions: \"No\r\nchanges in urinary elimination of phenols, nor in the degree of\r\nconjugation of the phenols, were observed, provided the factor of\r\npartial starvation was ruled out. This is believed to indicate that no\r\nincreased bacterial action occurs in the intestine of scorbutic\r\nguinea-pigs despite the difficulty of evacuation of the fæces.\" These\r\nresults are in harmony with the bacteriological study of Torrey and\r\nHess, who found that there was no increase in the proteolytic flora of\r\nthe intestine in infants or in guinea-pigs suffering from scurvy.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Baumann and Howard published the only metabolism study which has\r\nbeen carried out on guinea-pigs suffering from scurvy, and they are of\r\nthe opinion that this disorder has a profound effect on the mineral\r\nmetabolism of this animal. The calcium was excreted in notably large\r\namount; potassium was also lost, and to a greater extent than sodium;\r\nthe only element which was consistently retained during the active stage\r\nas well as during the period of recovery, was magnesium. This study was\r\nfollowed shortly by one from the same laboratory, by Howard and\r\nIngvaldsen, carried out on a monkey suffering from scurvy. It was\r\ninconclusive, not conforming to the experiments on the guinea-pigs; the\r\nauthors state that the \"changes in the mineral excretion of the monkey\r\nduring the scorbutic period were not sufficiently significant to admit\r\nof easy interpretation.\" \"The marked loss of the various mineral\r\nsubstances encountered in experiments with man and guinea-pig was not\r\nobserved in the present series.\" It should be remembered, however, that\r\nthe diets of the guinea-pigs and the monkeys were quite different, the\r\nformer consisting mainly of oats, and the latter of condensed milk. It\r\nis quite possible that the basic diet may play a rôle in the metabolism\r\nof this disease, although, as stated elsewhere, its effect cannot be\r\nnoted clinically. Special attention should be paid to this factor in\r\nmetabolic studies, in view of the widely-held opinion that the\r\ncarbohydrates exert a potent influence in the development of beriberi.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of the nitrogen metabolism in man and in animals have\r\nbeen most unsatisfactory. The two on human beings--an infant and an\r\nadult--were negative; that on guinea-pig scurvy cannot be utilized on\r\naccount of the restricted diet of oats, which contained insufficient\r\nnitrogen, whereas the one on the monkey showed some loss of nitrogen,\r\nwhich led the authors to suggest an increased nitrogenous catabolism in\r\nscurvy. This comprises the total data on this subject.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results of these few metabolic studies, it may be stated\r\nthat they harmonize on one point only--the positive balance of calcium\r\nduring the active stage of the disease. The investigation of Baumann\r\nand Howard on adult scurvy, of Lust and Klocman and of Moll on infantile\r\nscurvy, and of Howard and Ingvaldsen on the monkey, are all in agreement\r\nin this important conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRELATION OF SCURVY TO OTHER DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing there has been frequent reference to the close\r\nrelationship between scurvy and the incidence of the infectious\r\ndiseases--to the fact that a scorbutic condition increases the\r\nsusceptibility to infection. This is indeed one of the most\r\ncharacteristic, as well as one of the most important phenomena\r\nassociated with scurvy and other disorders resulting from vitamine\r\ndeficiency. Mention has been made of the special susceptibility to the\r\ndiphtheria bacillus, and to the organisms leading to coryza and the\r\nrespiratory diseases, but no doubt this applies also to invasion by\r\nother bacteria. We wish, however, to confine ourselves to the\r\nnutritional disorders, first in their relationship one to the other, and\r\nsecond, as a group of deficiency diseases, due to a lack of vitamines of\r\nvarious kinds. As is well known, in addition to scurvy, this group\r\ngenerally includes beriberi, a disease attributed to a lack of the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine, and xerophthalmia, an eye condition which\r\nrecently has been brought about in rats by placing them on a diet free\r\nfrom fat-soluble vitamine. These, however, form only the nucleus of the\r\ndisorders which commonly are included in this category. Schaumann, the\r\nfirst to formulate this classification, illustrated his conception of\r\nthe interrelationship by depicting the various members as spokes of a\r\nwheel surrounding a central hub. He included scurvy, rickets,\r\nosteomalacia, typical beriberi, ship-beriberi, pellagra and\r\nmehlnaerschaden. Funk made a similar classification of disorders which\r\nhe termed the \"avitaminosen.\" There is a tendency to enlarge rather than\r\nto decrease the membership of this class, and recently war or hunger\r\nedema, infantile atrophy and diarrhoea, sprue, coeliac disease,\r\nleprosy and others have been proposed as suitable candidates. At the\r\npresent time it is impossible to determine which and how many of this\r\nmotley company should be associated with scurvy. Some, possibly, are the\r\nresult of a lack of vitamine, but for the present it will be well to\r\nbear in mind that three vitamines only have stood the test of\r\nexperiment, and only these three therefore can be definitely connected\r\nin a causal relationship with pathologic conditions. In addition to this\r\nconsideration of the interrelationship of the \"deficiency diseases,\" the\r\nkinship of allied disorders--more particularly of rickets--must be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first thought _beriberi_ and scurvy would seem far apart\r\nfrom a clinical point of view, they have some important features in\r\ncommon. In both there is a tendency to a rapidity of the heart's action\r\nand a marked lability of the pulse, to an enlargement of the cardiac\r\nventricles, to an involvement of the vagus, and to an exaggeration of\r\nthe deep reflexes. It is unnecessary to describe these signs and\r\nsymptoms in detail, as they have been fully considered under\r\nsymptomatology. It has been recorded from time to time that under\r\ncertain circumstances scurvy has developed in man where one should have\r\nexpected beriberi, and _vice versa_. Darling, who has had a large\r\nexperience in this field, writes: \"A deficient dietary in a tropical\r\nAfrican negro mine laborer causes severe scurvy, in a Cape Colony\r\nAfrican mine laborer, mild scurvy, and in some African negroes a diet\r\nthat causes scurvy in one set of men causes neuritis in others.\"\r\nPossibly some minor differences in the dietary can explain this\r\ndifference in reaction--for we do not know all the sources of the\r\nwater-soluble vitamine, but such an experience deserves to be cited as\r\nit is not an isolated instance. It is all the more worthy of attention\r\nbecause it harmonizes to a certain extent with the everyday experience\r\nof animal investigation. As has been stated elsewhere, a diet of\r\ndecorticated grain will lead to scurvy in the guinea-pig, to\r\npolyneuritis in the pigeon, and to a combination of these diseases in\r\nthe hog! Results of this kind show that there must be a relationship\r\nbetween the etiologic factors of scurvy and of beriberi. It is unwise at\r\npresent to attempt to define the relationship more precisely. The\r\nremarkable observation, first made by Fuerst, and since confirmed by\r\nnumerous investigators, that seeds and legumes are devoid of\r\nantiscorbutic potency but acquire this power on sprouting, constitutes\r\nanother link in the evidence of their kinship. Funk has suggested that\r\nthe antiscorbutic vitamine can be formed from the \"antineuritic\"\r\nvitamine, a theory which is very attractive but needs confirmation and\r\nexperimental proof. It is quite evident that this change does not\r\nusually occur in animals, in view of the specificity of the vitamines\r\nfor their respective diseases--of the antiscorbutic for scurvy and the\r\nwater-soluble for beriberi.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that \"_ship-beriberi_\" is included in this group of\r\ndiseases. Very little is known about this condition, except what is\r\ncontained in the investigation of Nocht (1903) and that of Holst and\r\nFroelich. It is a very rare condition but of interest because it is\r\ncharacterized by spongy, hemorrhagic gums and other signs encountered in\r\nscurvy. The feature which differentiates it sharply from scurvy,\r\nhowever, is an anæsthesia of the extremities. Ship-beriberi is generally\r\nregarded as a combination of beriberi and scurvy. Where these two\r\ndisorders occur concomitantly, the beriberi manifests itself some months\r\nbefore the scurvy, as the latter takes much longer to develop.\r\n\r\nIn considering the vitamines in connection with diseases of the nervous\r\nsystem, mention may be made of \"central neuritis\" and the \"peripheral\r\nneuritis\" which has been reported from the West Indies. This bears only\r\na partial resemblance to beriberi, as there is no edema, nor dyspnoea,\r\nand its course is more chronic. Judging from the report of Edwards from\r\nJamaica, the cases more closely resemble pellagra, terminating after\r\nmany years. A degeneration of the cells of the spinal cord was found and\r\n\"in some isolated patches of the cerebellum and in the roots of the\r\noptic and auditory nerves.\" The disease occurs among the poor classes\r\nwhose diet is inadequate chiefly in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nEijkman was the first to draw an analogy between beriberi and\r\n_pellagra_, and thus to suggest that the latter might be a disease due\r\nto an unidentified factor; he compared the pernicious effect of a diet\r\nof polished rice with that of decorticated corn. Of recent years,\r\nlargely as the result of the investigations of Goldberger and his\r\nco-workers, pellagra has come to be regarded as a dietetic disorder\r\nprimarily due to a lack of adequate protein, rather than to a lack of a\r\nspecific vitamine. Its relationship to scurvy cannot, therefore, at the\r\npresent time, be discussed from an etiologic viewpoint. Apart, however,\r\nfrom the question of etiology, the two diseases have certain clinical\r\nsymptoms in common. Weston states that \"distinguished physicians, who\r\nwere really astute observers, have mistaken pellagra for scurvy, eczema,\r\nvarious kinds of intestinal troubles, syphilis, and many other\r\ndiseases.\" In the chapter on symptomatology, attention has been directed\r\nto the fact that an eczema which yields to antiscorbutic treatment may\r\noccur in scurvy; at times it presents the symmetrical arrangement so\r\ntypical of pellagra. In other cases a fleeting erythema may be observed,\r\nanother sign noted frequently in pellagrins. In some instances\r\ncongestion of the gums has been recorded. In describing a little girl of\r\nthree who had pellagra, Weston writes: \"The gums are also red and\r\nswollen, suggesting scurvy.\" This child had eaten large amounts of\r\nturnips, so that there could have been no question of complicating\r\nscurvy. Lombroso and some of the earlier authors drew attention to the\r\nfact that fragility of the bones, of the ribs and of the long bones, was\r\noften associated with pellagra. These various clinical similarities\r\nshould not be construed as evidence in favor of the \"avitamine\" nature\r\nof pellagra. They indicate, rather, that in nutritional disorders,\r\nwhatever may be their underlying cause, the vessels, the bones,\r\nand other tissues may suffer and lead to similar--but not\r\nidentical--clinical pictures.[58]\r\n\r\n[58] There is no adequate reason for placing in this group \"coeliac\r\ndisease,\" a nutritional disorder of children recently described by\r\nStill, and suggested by McCarrison as belonging to the category of the\r\nvitamine deficiency diseases. A case of this kind has come to our\r\nattention which resembled pellagra in many respects. It showed the\r\nbright red, denuded tongue, the intestinal symptoms, the occasional\r\nedema, marked loss in weight, and evanescent erythema--all symptoms of\r\nmarkedly disturbed nutrition but not distinctive of a lack of vitamines.\r\n\r\nThe relation between scurvy and rickets is a subject which was discussed\r\nby Glisson. With the renewed interest in infantile scurvy which followed\r\nBarlow's work toward the end of the last century, children's specialists\r\nranged themselves into opposing camps on the question of the\r\ninterrelationship and interdependency of these two diseases. Some\r\naccepted Barlow's dictum that infantile scurvy is an absolutely distinct\r\nand separate entity; others, for example, Hirschsprung, declared that\r\nthe so-called scurvy was merely a form of rickets; whereas a third group\r\nconsidered it a combination of rickets and scurvy. This last viewpoint\r\nwas actively maintained by Cheadle on the clinical side, and later by\r\nSchoedel and Nauwerk on the pathologic side--the latter declaring that\r\nrickets is \"an inseparable component of infantile scurvy,\" and that the\r\nentire disease should be regarded merely as \"an episode in the course of\r\nrickets.\" Even Barlow, in a paper published in 1894, wrote: \"Rhachitic\r\nchanges already present may act as a physiological determinant of the\r\nsites in which scurvy becomes manifest\" and \"rickets as a basis plus\r\ninadequate food gives the simplest explanation of the typical case\" (of\r\nscurvy).\r\n\r\nWe had an exceptional opportunity to test this thesis in 1914, in an\r\ninstitution where scurvy broke out among infants who were on a diet of\r\npasteurized milk. All these infants were receiving cod liver oil daily,\r\nas prophylactic treatment against rickets. Many infants have been seen\r\nsince that time, who in spite of receiving cod liver oil developed\r\nscurvy, and others in whom large doses of this oil failed to mitigate\r\nthe scurvy, although it prevented rickets. The same failure has been\r\nencountered in the treatment of scurvy in guinea-pigs. This experience\r\nhas been without exception, both from a prophylactic and a curative\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nConfusion between the two diseases has resulted from the fact that the\r\nmajority of infants in the Temperate Zone have some degree of rickets.\r\nThus the two diseases have been found very frequently associated in\r\npathologic examination of the bones, leading some to infer that they are\r\nin some way interdependent. They have been also confused clinically, as\r\nmentioned in another connection, owing to the fact that beading of the\r\nribs--the rhachitic rosary--has been mistakenly regarded as a\r\npathognomonic sign of rickets, whereas it is also a sign common to\r\nscurvy. It is important to bear in mind that from the pathologic\r\nviewpoint scurvy and rickets present strikingly dissimilar pictures--the\r\nformer is characterized by an almost complete cessation of activity of\r\nbone-forming elements, whereas the latter is distinguished by a\r\nhyperplastic condition leading to a marked overgrowth of cartilage and\r\nof abnormal bone. Viewed from the pathologic, etiologic and clinical\r\nstandpoint, we believe that there is no basis for assuming an\r\ninterrelationship between the two disorders, and that scurvy will\r\ndevelop as readily and as rapidly where rickets is absent as where it is\r\npresent.[59]\r\n\r\n[59] The only evidence in favor of a true interrelationship is furnished\r\nby a necropsy report of Hart and Lessing on one of five monkeys fed on a\r\nscorbutic diet. This animal died of disseminated tuberculosis, and the\r\nbones showed \"the classic picture of severe rickets.\" This occurrence\r\ncannot be explained, although illness and lack of exercise no doubt\r\nplayed a rôle. Until similar cases are reported, the incident must be\r\nregarded merely as interesting and suggestive.\r\n\r\nIt is premature to discuss the relationship of these two disorders from\r\nthe vitamine standpoint. In 1910 Schaumann suggested that rickets was\r\ndue to a lack of a specific food factor, and somewhat later Funk\r\nincluded it among the \"avitaminosen.\" Recently Mellanby, as the result\r\nof experiments on dogs, has affirmed that the fault lies in a lack of\r\nthe fat-soluble or a closely-related vitamine. Investigations of the\r\nnear future will probably decide the merits of this contention; our\r\nexperience is that rickets develops in infants even where the diet\r\ncontains adequate fat-soluble vitamine. If rickets is proved to be a\r\ndisorder depending on a vitamine, it belongs, naturally, in the same\r\ngroup as scurvy. This would indicate relationship, but not\r\ninterrelationship. Just as the mere fact that a lack of vitamines leads\r\nto scurvy and to beriberi does not signify, in theory or in practice,\r\nthe existence of pathogenetic interrelationship. However, as stated,\r\nthis is a subject which does not as yet rest on a secure foundation.\r\n\r\n_Osteogenesis imperfecta and osteomalacia_ are disorders of dietetic or\r\nmetabolic origin characterized by fragility of the bones. The latter\r\nhas developed new significance and importance due to its increased\r\noccurrence in almost epidemic form in the Central Empires at the close\r\nof the World War. The etiology of both disorders is most obscure. In the\r\nfuture in considering their pathogenesis it will be well to draw a sharp\r\ndistinction between them. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease in which\r\nan injury occurs to the foetus without any manifest illness in the\r\nmother, which seems to indicate a primary lesion of the foetus\r\n(perhaps metabolic); osteomalacia, on the other hand, attacks the mother\r\nwho gives birth to an apparently healthy foetus. The latter gains\r\nadded interest because it is a disease of the bones which is attributed\r\nto dysfunction of the endocrine glands, to a disturbance especially of\r\nthe parathyroid. If this observation is confirmed, it furnishes another\r\nanatomical basis for associating the glands of internal secretion with\r\npathologic conditions of the bones.\r\n\r\nOne cannot survey the various diseases of the bones--scurvy, rickets,\r\nosteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteomalacia, etc.,--without\r\nrealizing that this group is at present in a state of great confusion\r\nand will have to be rearranged and winnowed. The differentiation\r\nbetween some of these diseases is not in every instance clear\r\nmorphologically--for instance, early cases of scurvy and\r\nosteoporosis--so that it is difficult to consider them satisfactorily\r\nfrom the standpoint of pathogenesis. Clinical differentiation is still\r\nmore difficult and uncertain. It seems probable that new entities will\r\nbe established, as has happened in the past. It is not so long since\r\nrickets included almost all the bone diseases of infants. Gradually\r\ncongenital syphilis, scurvy, and achondroplasia were segregated as\r\ndistinct diseases. Probably a similar separation of other pathologic\r\nconditions, now so entangled as to be indistinguishable, will be\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases which have been attributed to a vitamine deficiency\r\nare \"war or hunger edema,\" sprue, the \"mehlnaerschaden\" of infants, and\r\nthe \"exudative diathesis\" described by Czerny and Keller. Future\r\ninvestigation will disclose whether any of these disorders belong in the\r\ngroup with scurvy. The _hunger edema_, noted in the late war and in\r\nprevious wars, seems to be a complex condition, quite dissociated from\r\nscurvy, as many of the sufferers consumed comparatively large quantities\r\nof potatoes or other vegetables. The \"_mehlnaerschaden_\" resembles\r\nscurvy and the other vitamine disorders in its tendency to produce\r\nhydremia and susceptibility to infection. It also develops in spite of a\r\nliberal supply of antiscorbutic foodstuff in the dietary. As its name\r\nimplies, it comes about on a diet containing large quantities of\r\ncarbohydrate, of the cereal paps so commonly fed to infants. It is\r\nconceivable that an unbalanced diet of this kind may not provide a\r\nsufficiency of all the vitamines.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem probable that _exudative diathesis_, a term which\r\nimplies a predisposition to develop exudations or denudations of the\r\nskin and mucous membranes, is the result of a lack of vitamine. This\r\ncondition does, however, predispose to scurvy. The association was very\r\nevident in the group of cases reported by Hess and Fish in 1914. It is\r\nnot without significance that the blood-vessels in exudative diathesis\r\nalso show a decided weakness, an increased permeability, as judged by\r\nthe \"capillary resistance test.\" In both scurvy and in exudative\r\ndiathesis eczema and petechial hemorrhages are encountered.\r\n\r\nThere may be _nutritional diseases due to an excess of food_ rather than\r\nto a deficiency. A superfluity may be harmful by hindering the proper\r\nutilization of the food, or may possibly lead to the formation of\r\ndeleterious products. Disturbances of this kind do occur. For example,\r\nit is by no means uncommon for an infant which has been overfed with\r\nmilk to show the typical signs of rickets. Young guinea-pigs which are\r\nfed liberal amounts of cow's milk develop a disease characterized by\r\nfragility of the bones. The experience of Lubarsch, who produced\r\nosteogenesis imperfecta in rabbits by means of a diet consisting mainly\r\nof liver, or adrenal gland, is of interest, especially as this condition\r\ndid not come about when they were fed muscle tissue.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, it must be evident that this subject not only\r\nis in a state of flux but that it is in a state of great confusion. This\r\napplies not only to the relationship of vitamines to these disorders,\r\nbut to their identification and demarcation pathologically as well as\r\nclinically. During the past few years we have begun to regard these\r\ndiseases from a new viewpoint, which no doubt will be helpful, but it is\r\nprobable that they will not be sharply defined and their relationships\r\ndetermined until it is possible to bring about each disease definitely\r\nand regularly in an experimental animal. Until this time we should\r\nproceed slowly, and not bring about \"confusion worse confounded\" by\r\nyielding to the vogue, and grouping together heterogeneous and\r\nlittle-understood clinical conditions under the caption of deficiency\r\ndiseases. There is a growing danger of attributing every unexplained\r\nnutritional disorder to the new, overworked, but ill-defined\r\nvitamines--of their sharing with the secretions of the endocrine glands\r\nthe fate of becoming the dumping-ground for every unidentified disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from \"Treatise on Scurvy,\" by James Lind, London, 1772.\r\n\r\n(a) _Recipe for preparing a stable orange or lemon juice._ Let the\r\nsqueezed juice of these fruits be well cleared from the pulp and\r\npurified by standing for some time; then poured off from the gross\r\nsediment; or, to have it still purer, it may be filtrated. Let it then\r\nbe put into any clean open vessel of china or stone-ware, which should\r\nbe wider at the top than bottom, so that there may be the largest\r\nsurface above to favor the evaporation. For this purpose a china basin\r\nor punch-bowl is proper, and generally made in the form required; all\r\nearthen glazed vessels are unfit, as their glazing will be dissolved by\r\nthe acid. Into this pour the purified juice, and put it into a pan of\r\nwater, upon a clear fire. Let the water come almost to a boil, and\r\ncontinue nearly in that state (with the basin containing the juice in\r\nthe middle of it) until the juice is found to be of the consistence of a\r\nthick syrup when cold. The slower the evaporation of the juice the\r\nbetter; and it will require at least twelve or fourteen hours\r\ncontinuance in the bath heat before it is reduced to a proper\r\nconsistence.\r\n\r\nIt is then, when cold, to be corked up in a bottle for use. Two dozen\r\ngood oranges, weighing five pounds four ounces, will yield one pound\r\nnine ounces and a half of pure juice; and when evaporated, there will\r\nremain about five ounces of rob, or extract; which in bulk will be equal\r\nto less than three ounces of water. So that thus the acid, and the\r\nvirtues of twelve dozen lemons or oranges, may be put into a quart\r\nbottle, and preserved for several years.\r\n\r\nI have now some extract of lemons which was made four years ago.\r\n\r\nThose who intend this extract for making punch may infuse some of the\r\nfresh peel of the oranges or lemons into the spirit before it is used.\r\n\r\nBut for this purpose I find it is sufficient to add a very small\r\nquantity of the outer peel to the extract a little before it is taken\r\noff the fire, and there will be all that is requisite to make it\r\nentirely equal to the freshest fruit.\r\n\r\n(b) _How to preserve berries and other fruits for long periods._ And it\r\nmay be proper to acquaint them that most berries, and several fruits,\r\nwhen gathered two-thirds ripe on a dry day, while the sun shines, if put\r\ninto earthen pots, or rather in dry bottles, well corked, and sealed up,\r\nso that no air or moisture can enter, will keep a long time, and at the\r\nend of a year, be as fresh as when new pulled.\r\n\r\n(c) _Method of preparing an antiscorbutic decoction from fir-tops,\r\nleaves, bark, etc._ When the Swedes carried on a war against the\r\nMuscovites, almost all the soldiers of their army were destroyed by the\r\nscurvy, having putrid gums, rigid tendons, etc. But a stop was put to\r\nthe progress of this disease by the advice of Erbenius, the King's\r\nphysician, with a simple decoction of fir-tops, by which the most\r\ndeplorable cases were perfectly recovered, and the rest of the soldiers\r\nprevented from falling into it.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe by the description given by Cartier of the\r\nameda tree, with a decoction of the bark and leaves of which his men\r\nwere so speedily recovered, that it was the large swampy American spruce\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nA simple decoction of the tops, cones, leaves or even green bark and\r\nwood of these trees is an excellent antiscorbutic medicine; but it will,\r\nI am apt to think, become much more so when fermented, as in making\r\nspruce beer. By carrying a few bags of spruce or its extract to sea,\r\nthis wholesome drink may be prepared at any time. But where it cannot be\r\nhad the common fir-tops used for fuel in the ship should be first boiled\r\nin water, and the decoction afterwards fermented with molasses in the\r\ncommon method of making spruce beer; to which a small quantity of\r\nwormwood and horse-radish root (which it is easy to preserve fresh at\r\nsea) may be added. The juice of the cocoanut tree was experienced to be\r\nof very great benefit to several persons afflicted with the scurvy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT, J.: A Case of Infantile Beriberi with Autopsy Report, Phillip.\r\nJour. of Sci., Sec.
