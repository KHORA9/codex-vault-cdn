Such passages contain\r\nnumerous shorthand word contractions represented in the\r\noriginal text by superscripted letters, diacritics, and archaic symbols\r\nsome of which cannot be accurately reproduced with current digital\r\nmedia. In this plain text transcription, paired curly brackets are used\r\nto indicate {characters} that were superscripted in the original text,\r\npaired tildes denote text that was printed with a ~bold~ blackletter\r\nfont and paired underscores denote _italicised text_. Depending on\r\nwhich font is being used, the diacritics and archaic symbols might or\r\nmight not display correctly.\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been positioned below the relevant paragraphs.\r\n\r\nSerious readers are strongly recommended to take advantage of the HTML\r\nversion on a full-sized browser screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: King Henry VIII]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ANNALS OF THE BARBER-SURGEONS\r\n                    OF LONDON, COMPILED FROM THEIR\r\n                 RECORDS AND OTHER SOURCES, BY SIDNEY\r\n                 YOUNG, ONE OF THE COURT OF ASSISTANTS\r\n                 OF THE WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF BARBERS\r\n                OF LONDON, WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY AUSTIN\r\n                               T.

Much\r\nis already known, through the Histories of such of them as have\r\nbeen written--and an apology from me is not needed for a further\r\ncontribution to so interesting a study. But whilst I make no apology\r\nfor the contribution, I crave the indulgence of my readers for any\r\nshortcomings which, from a literary point of view, may appear in this\r\nwork; I invite their attention to the matter, rather than to the style\r\nin which it is expressed.\r\n\r\nAbout eight years ago I applied to our Court for permission to search\r\nthe Records, and my request being complied with, I devoted such spare\r\ntime as I could secure from an engrossing occupation to the compilation\r\nof these Annals. The work has necessarily led to the burning of much\r\nmidnight oil, because every extract and every line has been made _by\r\nmy own pen_. The researches have extended to the examination of all,\r\nand the transcript of a considerable portion of thirteen lengthy\r\nCharters and sets of By-laws, as also to the entire perusal of about\r\na hundred books of Records. In addition to this, there has been much\r\nlabour expended at the British Museum, the Public Record Office, the\r\nGuildhall, and Somerset House.\r\n\r\nThe material thus collected became so voluminous, that I experienced\r\nconsiderable difficulty in separating it into Subject Chapters, and\r\nalso in deciding what to retain and what to reject; my endeavour in\r\nthis respect having been to preserve all that is really interesting and\r\ncurious, discarding dry legal passages, doubtful points, and wearisome\r\nrepetitions.\r\n\r\nNone but those who have had experience of the crabbed eccentric writing\r\nand contractions of former times (see some of the _fac-similes_ given)\r\nand of the abbreviated “Court hand” Latin in which Charters and other\r\nRecords were penned, can have the least idea of the trouble and care\r\nrequired in their deciphering; but in this respect I have not spared\r\npains in giving literal and accurate transcripts.\r\n\r\nIn no case have I modernized the old spelling, or interfered with the\r\nquaintness of the original expressions; though all dates occurring\r\nbetween the 1st January and 24th March prior to the year 1752 (when\r\n“old style” was extinguished) have been rectified, and the “historical\r\nyear,” according to our present computation, given; thus rendering the\r\nchronology systematic, and avoiding confusion and inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of the greatest regret, that whilst we possess some\r\nearlier records, our Court Minutes previous to 1551 are lost. It\r\nis conjectured that they must have been at the Hall in 1793 (as a\r\npartial list of Masters was then compiled), but all trace of them has\r\nnow disappeared. Again, the Minutes from 1651-1689 are now missing,\r\nalthough they were at the Hall about forty years ago.\r\n\r\nI may here take the opportunity to remark that the Barbers and\r\nBarber-Surgeons held a somewhat distinctive position apart from other\r\nCompanies, inasmuch as they were a Professional rather than a Trade\r\nGuild, and their History, consequently, becomes invested with an\r\nespecial interest. Another point to which I, as a Barber, am proud\r\nto refer is that our Company stood out, alone, as the pioneer of\r\nTechnical Education, hundreds of years before it became as popular\r\nas it now is. From the middle of the fifteenth century the Company\r\nwas careful to provide for Surgical Lectures, and the regular and\r\nsystematic instruction of its members. The means originally employed\r\nmay have been primitive, but they were dictated by high motives, and\r\ngradually extended and developed; a Museum (a poor one, it is true)\r\nand a valuable Library were founded, an Anatomical Theatre was built,\r\nand every opportunity taken to encourage the Scientific study of\r\nSurgery--all with results fraught with the greatest benefit, not only\r\nto London, but to the Kingdom at large.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to those who have aided\r\nme in my work, and especially to my dear and valued friend, Past\r\nMaster Charles John Shoppee, whose practical assistance, advice and\r\nencouragement all through, have been to me of the greatest service. Mr.\r\nD’Arcy Power, M.A., has laid me under much obligation, and particularly\r\nfor revising and perfecting my translation of the Norman-French\r\nOrdinances, 12th Rich. II. My son, Austin Travers Young, has rendered\r\nvaluable assistance in delineating the several Illustrations throughout\r\nthe work, and lastly, I must record, with gratitude, my obligation to\r\nMr. Edward Lawless for the attention and care bestowed upon me on the\r\nnumerous occasions of my visits to the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of this work, a somewhat arduous task for an Amateur,\r\nhas been to me purely a labour of love, and, in laying down my pen I\r\nmay be permitted to add, that my best wishes for the Ancient Mystery of\r\nBarbers are summed up in the words of our time-honoured toast, “_The\r\nWorshipful Company of Barbers, Root and Branch, and may it flourish for\r\never_.”\r\n\r\n    SIDNEY YOUNG.\r\n\r\n    ALWYNE ROAD, CANONBURY.\r\n    _March,

II, and is\r\nstrengthened by reference to the Returns made by the Barbers of Lincoln\r\nand of Norwich (both which latter are preserved at the Record Office),\r\nand which clearly point to those guilds being of a religious character;\r\nindeed the Barbers of Norwich do not seem to have had a single secular\r\nor trade ordinance in their constitution.\r\n\r\n1388. In the Return of the Barbers of London to the Writ of Richard\r\nII, the Masters recite that they “have found a document amongst the\r\narticles of their records made of the time to which memory runneth\r\nnot,” concerning the points upon which the fraternity was founded;\r\n\r\n  PRIMEREMENT al honourance de Dieu et touz ses Seyntes et pur\r\n  excitac͠on les c͠oens des gentz a bien faire et perseverance avoir et\r\n  bien faitz. . . . .\r\n\r\n  FIRSTLY to the honour of God and all his Saints, and to stir up the\r\n  commons of the people to do well, and to have perseverance in well\r\n  doing. . . . .\r\n\r\nRegulations were made enjoining charity, attendance at funerals and\r\nobits, against the enticing away of the servants of others, providing\r\nfor the amicable settlement of disputes, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe articles above briefly referred to, contain nothing in particular\r\nas to trade regulation or inspection, leaving a pretty certain\r\ninference that they were made for the governance of a social and\r\nreligious guild or fraternity. We shall presently see that in 1308, the\r\nCompany partook of the nature of a trade guild, and we may therefore\r\nreasonably presume that the articles made in the time to which memory\r\nin 1388 did not run, were drawn up _previous_ to 1308, and therefore\r\nwithout much hesitation we may assign the origin of the Barbers’\r\nCompany to at least the xiij{th.} century.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the reign of Edward II, and indeed for a long\r\nwhile previously, the Barbers were practitioners in the art of Surgery;\r\nat all events they performed the minor operations of that craft, such\r\nas bleeding, tooth-drawing, cauterization, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe Barbers having been accustomed to assist the monks in the surgical\r\noperations performed by them in early times, acquired a degree of\r\nproficiency which enabled them to practise as Surgeons themselves. Up\r\ntill about the xij{th.} century the practice of Surgery and Medicine\r\nwas however almost wholly confined to the Clergy, who seem to have\r\nenjoyed the double privilege of curing men’s bodies as well as their\r\nsouls. In 1163 the Council of Tours, under Pope Alexander III,\r\nconsidering that a practice which involved in its operations the\r\nshedding of blood, was incompatible with the holy office of the clergy,\r\nforbad them to interfere in any matter of Surgery; the consequence\r\nof this edict was that they gave over the operations of Surgery but\r\ncontinued to practise the healing art of Medicine.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the Clergy very frequently employed the Barbers\r\nas their assistants, and committed to them the preparation of\r\nthe medicated baths and the performance of sundry minor surgical\r\noperations. No doubt the Edict of Tours was hailed with joy by the\r\nBarbers, who thus found a lucrative practice thrown in their way,\r\nand seized the opportunity of practising as Surgeons “on their own\r\naccount,” calling themselves Barber-Surgeons, and practising both\r\nBarbery and Surgery.\r\n\r\n_c._ 1307. The archives preserved at the Guildhall have many entries\r\nconcerning the Barbers’ Company, and in _Letter-Book D._ 157{B.}\r\nthere is an ordinance concerning the Barbers of London, which shows\r\nthat at this time they were occupied in Surgery, and advertised\r\ntheir profession in an objectionable manner, which was very properly\r\nforbidden by the City authorities.\r\n\r\n  DE BARBOURS. Et que nul barbier ne soit se ose ne si hardy qil mette\r\n  sank en leur fenestres en apiert ou en view des gentz, mais pryvement\r\n  le facent porter a Thamise sur peine des doux souldz rendre al oeps\r\n  des Viscountz.\r\n\r\n  CONCERNING BARBERS. And that no barbers shall be so bold or so hardy\r\n  as to put blood in their windows, openly or in view of folks, but let\r\n  them have it privily carried unto the Thames, under pain of paying\r\n  two shillings to the use of the Sheriffs.\r\n\r\n1308. The first express entry which we have concerning our Company is\r\nthe presentation and admission of Richard le Barber, as Supervisor\r\nor Master of the Barbers, before the Court of Aldermen in 1308\r\n(_Letter-Book C._ 96).\r\n\r\n  RIC’S LE BARBOUR ex oppõito ecc̃lie omñi scoꝜ parue elect’ est et\r\n  p’sentatˀ pˀ Barbitonsores london die Martˀ p’xˀ p’t fm̃ Sc̃e Lucie\r\n  virgĩs Anno R. E. fiɫ R. E. sc̃do coram dñis Nichõ de ffarndon tũc\r\n  maiore london Johñe de Wengũue cetˀisqʒ Aldermĩs ad custodiendˀ\r\n  officiũ BarbitonsoꝜ &c.

And he was admitted and made oath that every month\r\n  he would make scrutiny throughout the whole of his trade, and if he\r\n  should find any among them keeping brothels, or acting unseemly in\r\n  any other way, and to the scandal of the trade, he was to distrain\r\n  upon them, and cause the distress to be taken into the Chamber (_of\r\n  London_) &c.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing record does not appear very creditable to the reputation\r\nof the Barbers of Edward the Second’s time, but it should be remembered\r\nthat in those days, and for a long period before and afterwards, the\r\nBarbers superintended the Baths (Bagnios) and that these places were\r\nnot infrequently the resort of improper characters; a few of our\r\npredecessors had perhaps, under the circumstances, been somewhat lax in\r\ntheir morality, and let us hope that Richard le Barber administered to\r\nthose whom he found offending, due correction according to his oath and\r\ntheir deserts.\r\n\r\nIt would not seem from the terms of the admission, that the Master was\r\nat that period elected annually, and the Office was probably held by\r\none man for a considerable number of years. There is no entry in the\r\nCity books (which have been carefully examined for the purpose) of\r\nanother admission to the Office until the year 1376, when two Masters\r\nwere appointed, and then for some years subsequently two new Masters\r\nwere sworn in annually.\r\n\r\n1309. In this year we find the first record of an admission of a Barber\r\nto the freedom of the City, and several others occur about this period\r\n(_see_ Freemen).\r\n\r\n1310. On Wednesday next after the feast of the Nativity, 4th Edward II,\r\nGerard the Barber was sworn keeper of the Gate of Newgate (_Letter-Book\r\nD._ 113), and there are other entries of Barbers being appointed\r\nkeepers or porters at the City gates; from one of these, in 1375, it\r\nwould seem that they were to keep a strict watch that no lepers should\r\nenter the city, and it was doubtless on account of their surgical\r\nknowledge enabling them to distinguish those afflicted with leprosy,\r\nthat these offices were conferred upon them.\r\n\r\n1310. On Monday before the feast of St. Gregory the will of Richard\r\nle Barber, our first Master, was proved in the Court of Husting. To\r\nKatherine his wife and Johanna his daughter, he left tenements and\r\nrents in Bread Street, Cordwainer Street, Queenhithe, Candlewike\r\nStreet, and Whitecrouche Street. To Thomas de Mangrave his apprentice,\r\na shop in Bread Street; to the fabric of London Bridge 20{s.,} and the\r\nresidue to pious uses.\r\n\r\n1312. The earliest admission of a Surgeon (_not_ a Barber Surgeon) to\r\nthe freedom is that of “Magister Johẽs de Suthwerk cirurgicus,” who was\r\nsworn on Friday before the feast of St. Barnabas, 5th Edward II, and\r\nwho paid nothing for his freedom, being admitted at the instance of\r\nHugh de Waltham, Town Clerk.\r\n\r\nAmong the Archives at Guildhall are various entries relating to early\r\nBarbers, which, although not touching upon the history of our Company,\r\nmay properly be preserved in these pages, and I shall therefore give\r\ntranslations of a few of them.\r\n\r\n  1315. On Monday next after the feast of the Purification of the\r\n  Blessed Virgin Mary, in the 8th Edward II, by common assent of the\r\n  Mayor and Aldermen in the Hustings of pleas of Land, there was\r\n  granted and demised to William de Dounesheued, Barber to Sir John de\r\n  Sandale, Chancellor of our Lord the King, a certain house belonging\r\n  to the Bridge of London, to have and to hold to the said William for\r\n  his whole life, he paying yearly on the usual days two and a half\r\n  marks to the keepers for the time being of the said Bridge, which\r\n  said house is situate between a house belonging to the said Bridge in\r\n  which John Mew now dwells towards the West, and a house belonging to\r\n  Thomas le Maderman towards the East, in the Parish of Saint Dionis\r\n  Backchurch London. And the said William, the said house and its\r\n  appurtenances in all needful manner shall sustain, and against wind\r\n  and rain cause the same to be defended during the whole term of his\r\n  life.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a proviso that if the rent should remain unpaid for a\r\nwhole year that the Bridge Keepers should re-enter. (_Letter-Book E._\r\n28{B.})\r\n\r\n1319. On Thursday after the feast of St. Valentine, 13th Edward II,\r\nthere was enrolled an obligation by which Roger the Barber (servant to\r\nJohn de Dallinge, Sheriff of London) and Margaret his wife, were bound\r\nto pay £100 to Sir John de Laugecombe, Rector of the Church of Laumaz\r\nHeys (_sic_) before the feast of Easter. (_Letter-Book E._ 85.)\r\n\r\n1320. On Wednesday next after the feast of Saints Fabian and Sebastian,\r\n13th Edward II, Lawrence the Barber, one of the men sworn to keep the\r\nPoultry Market on Cornhill, laid an information against John Bakon that\r\nhe the said John was a forestaller of the Market. (_Letter-Book E._\r\n96{B.})\r\n\r\n1320. In the same year among the names of the Citizens assessed to\r\ncontribute to a fine of £1,000 to the King, occurs that of Thomas the\r\nBarber. (_Letter-Book E._ 106{B.})\r\n\r\n1320. On Monday next before the feast of St. Margaret the Virgin, 14th\r\nEdward II, the Wardship of Alice, Joane and Agnes, children of John de\r\nWynton, Barber, deceased, was given to Joane his widow; several shops\r\nand houses in the City belonging to the deceased are scheduled as for\r\nthe benefit of the Wards, and Robert de Lamyngton, John de Bristolle,\r\nBarber, and Roger de Croidon were bound as sureties. (_Letter-Book E._\r\n114.)\r\n\r\nInstances also occur of City Wards (sons of Barbers deceased) being\r\napprenticed by the Chamberlain to various trades.\r\n\r\n1340. In 14th Edward III, Hamo the Barber was assessed by the City\r\nat £10 as his contribution towards a forced loan of £5,000 to the\r\nKing (_Letter-Book F._ 33) and six years later (1346) Hamo was again\r\nassessed at 20_s._ towards a “present” of 3,000 marks to the King.\r\n\r\n1370. On 14th March, 44th Edward III, the wardship of Alice (aged 3\r\nyears), daughter of Nicholas the Barber, was given to Gilbert Prince,\r\nwho was to use her legacy of 40 marks for her benefit.\r\n\r\n1374. On the 28th July, 1374, Lawrence de Weston, Barber (Master of\r\nthe Company in 1376), and Margaret his wife, mother of the said Alice,\r\ncame before the Mayor, &c., and proved that the said Alice was dead,\r\nwhereupon Gilbert Prince, the Executor of Nicholas the Barber’s will,\r\nwas discharged, and the money paid to Lawrence and Margaret de Weston.\r\n(_Letter-Book G._ 244 and 317{B.})\r\n\r\nReverting now from individuals to the Company, we find that the Barbers\r\nexisted as a Trade Guild, but unincorporated certainly from the year\r\n1308, and that they were at first ruled by one Master, and later on\r\n(in 1376) by two Masters, appointed annually. This Company of Barbers\r\nwas composed of two classes of Members--viz., those who practised\r\nBarbery proper (perhaps including phlebotomy and tooth drawing), and\r\nthose who practised Surgery, and who were, for distinction sake, called\r\nBarber-Surgeons (in the City books they are spoken of as “Barbers\r\nexercising the faculty of Surgery”). For aught we know to the contrary,\r\na perfect harmony and good understanding existed between these two\r\nsections of the Company, and it is probable that the ranks of the\r\nlatter were continually recruited from the former.\r\n\r\n1381. The earliest evidence of the existence of our Hall is to be found\r\nin Harl. MS. 541, which contains a list of Companies’ Halls in the\r\nCity, temp. 5 Richard II, by which it appears that the Barbers’ Hall\r\nwas then, as now, in the Parish of Saint Olave, Silver Street, and\r\ndoubtless on the same site; the entry is, “Barbar hall y{e} p’yssh of\r\nSeynt Oluf in Sylverstrete.” In 1490 the Hall is _known_ to have been\r\non the same site.\r\n\r\n1388. In this year Richard II sent his writs all over the Kingdom to\r\nenquire into the nature and constitution of the several guilds and\r\nfraternities, religions, social or craft, and the returns to these\r\nwrits, which must have been an immense number, were formerly kept among\r\nthe Records at the Tower of London. Herbert, in his History of the\r\nLivery Companies, refers to his fruitless endeavours to discover these\r\nreturns, and I have made diligent enquiry at the Record Office for\r\nthem also, with the undoubted result that all of those which relate to\r\nthe London Trading Guilds are lost. There are, however, a great number\r\nrelating to London religious guilds and to trade guilds all over the\r\ncountry. Two of these concerning the Barbers of Norwich and of Lincoln\r\nare so highly interesting that I have preserved them in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nAmongst our Archives at Barbers’ Hall, is a vellum book of Ordinances\r\nwritten out fair in 1658, and therein is to be found a copy of the\r\nreturn made by the Barbers of London to the writ of Richard II, and\r\nwhich the Company caused to be extracted from the Tower Records in\r\n1634. It is certified by William Colet as agreeing with the original,\r\nbut unfortunately Mr. Colet (although he was Deputy-Keeper of the\r\nRecords) or his copyist has made one or two mistakes, which necessitate\r\na little hiatus in the translation, and he has put the year as the 11th\r\ninstead of the 12th of Richard II. That the latter year is the correct\r\none is abundantly proved by the dates on the original writs and on the\r\nnumerous returns still in existence at the Record Office, as also by\r\nthe names of the Masters certifying, who are recorded at Guildhall as\r\nhaving been admitted 10th September, 12th Richard II.\r\n\r\nRichard II was more solicitous as to the funds and property of the\r\nGuilds, than he was about their observances, and our predecessors seem\r\nto have quickly acquainted him with their pecuniary position, “the\r\nwhich Company have neither tenements nor rents to their common use.”\r\n\r\nThe Masters recite an old document which they found in their strong\r\nbox, and which will well repay perusal; it opens with a devout\r\ndedication to the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the glorious company of\r\nheaven, and the first Ordinance being expressly made in honour of God\r\nand all saints, and with the intention of stirring up the people to do\r\nwell and to persevere therein, we must all approve of it. It provides\r\nfirstly, that decayed brethren shall have an allowance of 10-1/2_d._\r\nper week, if their poverty have not come about by their own folly.\r\nThe second and third Ordinances relate to attendance at funerals and\r\nobits of deceased members. Then follow certain rules, that no man shall\r\nentice away another’s servant; the Masters to settle disputes, payment\r\nof quarterage, refusal of office, absence from Mass and the yearly\r\nfeast, the livery clothing, &c., &c. It is well to observe here the\r\nevidence of the antiquity of our livery, of the quarterage, and of the\r\nfeast, all of which have come down to these days.\r\n\r\nSome later Ordinances are added, which were apparently made in 1387.\r\nThis return is probably the only one extant of the whole of those made\r\nby the London trade guilds, and is therefore of the highest interest.\r\nA copy of the original (which is in Norman French), together with a\r\ntranslation, follows.\r\n\r\n    COPIA extracta ex Bundell’ Fraternitatum et Gildar’ Civitatis\r\n      London remaneñ de Recordo prout patet in Rotulis dñi Regis infra\r\n      Turrim London.\r\n\r\n  Anno xj{o}.[29] Ricardi Secundi.\r\n\r\n  [29] A mistake for Anno xij{o.}\r\n\r\n  JOHAN HEYDON et Hen Cook Mestres[30] William Chapman et William\r\n  Gomine Surveyours de la Compaignie appelle ffraternite des Barbers de\r\n  la Citee de Londres dauncien temps ordeigne certifiant au Counsail\r\n  ñre S{r.} le Roy en sa Chancellarie la forme manere et condicion de\r\n  touz articles obseruancez et lour circumstances contenuz en la paper\r\n  de dite Compaignie en la forme quesuyt la quel compaignie nont nul\r\n  teñt ne rent a lour c͠oe oeps les queles articles la dite Compaignie\r\n  nont usez en lour temps forsqz soulement pur auer lour vesture un\r\n  foitz per añ et paier lour quarterage pur sustiner pouerez geñtz de\r\n  mesme la Compaignie et un foitz per añ assembler pur manger et eslire\r\n  neuells Mestres et Surveiours sanz ascun autre article de sontz\r\n  escript mettre en use forsqz ceux qˀ tan soulement sont faitz al\r\n  honour de dieu mes purtant qils ont trouez un paper one les articles\r\n  de sontz escriptz fait del temps donc memorie ne court ils les ont\r\n  p’sentez a vrẽ tressages discrecions.\r\n\r\n  [30] Sworn Masters of the Barbers, 10 Sept., 1388. 12th Ric.

That when any brother of the said Fraternity dies the brethren\r\n  of the said Fraternity shall go on the Vigil to the dirge, and on\r\n  the day[31] to the Mass, and to the dirge and to the mass of the\r\n  month’s obit, and that each such brother dead have thirty masses from\r\n  their common box,[32] and that each brother who is absent without\r\n  reasonable excuse at any of the said four times, shall put into their\r\n  common box in place of his offerings and expenses, as he ought to\r\n  have done if he had been present, three pence.\r\n\r\n  [31] The day of the funeral.\r\n  [32] Thirty masses sung at the expense of the common box.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. When any Master of the said Fraternity has a wife dead, the\r\n  brethren of the said Fraternity shall be at the Vigil and at the Mass\r\n  on the day of her burial and at the month’s obit, and that brother\r\n  who is absent at any of the three times shall pay for each time that\r\n  he be absent, in place of the costs and other expenses which he would\r\n  have borne if he had been present, three pence to their common box.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That no brother of the said Fraternity entice any servant from\r\n  the service of his master, privily or openly.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. If any dispute arise between any of the brethren, which God\r\n  forbid, it is to be amicably settled by the decision of the Masters\r\n  of the said Fraternity [_and they are_] to deal plainly,[33] and that\r\n  no one sue another in other manner than at the assize (_?_) [_and\r\n  then only_] if he be empowered by leave of the said Masters to be\r\n  recorded.\r\n\r\n  [33] _i.e._, honestly.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That each brother of the said Fraternity shall come\r\n  each quarter of the year and pay his quarterage to the\r\n  collectors[34] . . . . . .\r\n\r\n  [34] I am unable to complete this sentence.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. It is agreed between all the said brethren that whoever of them\r\n  refuses his office when it comes to him, if he wishes to be relieved\r\n  of it, that he pay to their common box.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. If any brother be absent from their Mass and Feast when it\r\n  shall be once a year, he shall pay so much in offerings and all other\r\n  things as one present.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That none of the said brethren put [?] another out of his\r\n  house.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. If any brother by chance delay his payments beyond a\r\n  year-and-a-half, that he make acquittance within two years without\r\n  any [_penalty_] beyond the ordinary fine. And if he be thus forgiven\r\n  that he settle the matter at once.\r\n\r\n  AND to hold these points pursuant to amendment alone if the Mystery\r\n  will that they be amended, this Fraternity are sworn among themselves\r\n  and have each of them pledged his troth, and so from each who shall\r\n  [_hereafter_] be of the said Fraternity. And it is agreed amongst\r\n  them that this Indenture be enclosed in their common box, and the\r\n  counterpart be held by the Masters for the time being of the said\r\n  Fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe document which the Masters found amongst their records made in “the\r\ntime to which memory runneth not” probably ends here, and the following\r\nItems (see the third one) were doubtless additional Ordinances made\r\ncirca 1387.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That each brother of the said Fraternity pay in pledge for his\r\n  livery, when he has the same, forty pence at the least.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That each brother keep the livery two whole years before he may\r\n  give, or sell, or alienate it in any manner, under pain of paying to\r\n  the Company for their pardon, a noble of gold.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. It is ordained that on the Sunday following the Assumption of\r\n  our Lady in the 11th year of King Richard the Second,[35] that the\r\n  Surveyors of the said Mystery be elected by the assent of all the\r\n  Fraternity, and no longer by the Masters.\r\n\r\n  [35] 18th Aug., 1387.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. That none of the said Fraternity hereafter pay more than\r\n  fourteen pence for his feast.\r\n\r\n  ITEM. It is ordained that each Master who shall choose any other man\r\n  to be in his place, that is to say for to be Master; he who shall\r\n  choose such man to be Master for the year shall be bound by himself\r\n  for him, in an obligation to the Company for the money.[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] _i.e._, a guarantee for his honesty.\r\n\r\n                                     It agrees with the Record,\r\n                                                       WILLIAM COLET.\r\n\r\nCoeval with our Company of Barbers there existed in the City of London,\r\nanother Fraternity or Guild, that of the Surgeons, in no way connected\r\nwith the Barbers, but, like them, existing by prescription only and\r\nunincorporated. It is not to be expected that these two Companies\r\nwould, in the days of so much trade protection and jealousy, exhibit\r\nan over-friendly feeling towards one another, and the records of the\r\nperiod, though meagre, show that this was the case. The Surgeons’ Guild\r\nat no time appear to have been a numerous body, indeed there is reason\r\nto believe that frequently their numbers were less than a dozen, and\r\nthey possibly never exceeded twenty.\r\n\r\nIn the researches undertaken for the purpose of this work, various\r\nreferences to the Surgeons’ Guild have turned up, and although at this\r\nearly period there was much in common between the two Fraternities, I\r\nhave considered it quite apart from the subject in hand to go into any\r\ndetail concerning that Guild, more especially as it has recently been\r\nso ably and fully dealt with by Mr. D’Arcy Power in his “Memorials of\r\nthe Craft of Surgery.”\r\n\r\n1376. In the 50th Edward III, the Barbers made a complaint to the Mayor\r\nand Aldermen against unskilled practitioners in Surgery, and prayed\r\nthat two Masters should be yearly appointed to inspect and rule the\r\ncraft, and that none should be admitted to the freedom of the City, but\r\nupon due examination of their skill; and this was granted by the Court,\r\nentered of record and Lawrence de Weston and John de Grantone were\r\nchosen Masters. The following is a translation of the original record\r\nconcerning this matter.[37]\r\n\r\n[37] In this and some other cases I have adopted the able translations\r\nmade by Mr. Riley in his “Memorials of London and London Life.”\r\n\r\n  To the honourable Lords, and wise, the Mayor and Aldermen of the City\r\n  of London, shew the good folks, the Barbers of the same city, that\r\n  whereas from one day to another there resort men, who are barbers,\r\n  from uppelande[38] unto the said city, who are not instructed in\r\n  their craft, and do take houses and intermeddle with barbery,\r\n  surgery, and the cure of other maladies, while they know not how\r\n  to do such things, nor ever were instructed in such craft; to the\r\n  great damage, and in deceit, of the people, and to the great scandal\r\n  of all the good barbers of the said city:--therefore the said good\r\n  folks do pray that it may please your honourable Lordships, for\r\n  the love of God, and as a work of charity, to ordain and establish\r\n  that from henceforth no such stranger, coming to the said City from\r\n  uppelande, or from any other place, of whatsoever condition he be,\r\n  shall keep house or shop for barbery within the same city, before\r\n  that he shall be found able and skilled in the said art and office\r\n  of barbery, and that, by assay and examination of the good folks,\r\n  barbers of the same city, whom out of the said craft it may please\r\n  you to ordain thereunto. And that it may please you to ordain and\r\n  establish, that from henceforth there shall always be two good men of\r\n  their said craft chosen by their common assent to be Wardens of the\r\n  craft; and that such two persons shall be presented unto the Mayor,\r\n  Recorder, and Aldermen, of the said city, and sworn before them well\r\n  and lawfully, to the best of their power and knowledge, to rule their\r\n  said craft; and that the said Masters may inspect the instruments of\r\n  the said art, to see that they are good and proper for the service of\r\n  the people, by reason of the great peril that might ensue thereupon;\r\n  and that on the complaint of such two Masters, all rebellious persons\r\n  in the said craft, shall be made to come before you, and whosoever\r\n  shall be found in default against this Ordinance shall pay to the\r\n  Chamber 40 pence. And that from henceforth no man of their craft\r\n  shall be admitted to the franchise of the said city, if he be not\r\n  attested as being good and able, upon good examination before you\r\n  made. And that no foreigner shall keep house or shop in their craft\r\n  within the said city, or the suburbs thereof. And that this Ordinance\r\n  shall be enrolled in the Chamber of the Guildhall of London, for all\r\n  time to last.\r\n\r\n  [38] The general name for country places in those days.\r\n\r\n  And the same was granted unto them. Whereupon, Laurence de\r\n  Westone and John de Grantone were chosen Masters of the Barbers.\r\n  [_Letter-Book H. 28._]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing ordinance must surely have given umbrage to the Surgeons’\r\nGuild as it placed the Barbers upon an equal footing with them in the\r\nexamination of Surgeons, the inspection of their instruments, etc.; and\r\nthis more especially as seven years previously (in 1369) the Surgeons\r\nhad obtained from the same Court an Ordinance investing them with the\r\npower of presenting the defaults of all unskilful Surgeons.\r\n\r\n1382. As an example of a quack Surgeon’s method of practice, and of his\r\nrogueries and punishment, the following case of Roger Clerk will be\r\nfound interesting:--\r\n\r\n  Roger Clerk, of Wandelesworth,[39] on the 13th day of May in the 5th\r\n  year (_Richard II_), was attached in the Chamber of the Guildhall of\r\n  London, before the Mayor and Aldermen, to make answer, as well to the\r\n  Mayor and Commonalty of the City of London, as to Roger atte Hacche,\r\n  in a plea of deceit and falsehood: as to which, the same Roger said,\r\n  that whereas no physician or surgeon should intermeddle with any\r\n  medicines or cures within the liberty of the city aforesaid, but\r\n  those who are experienced in the said arts, and approved therein, the\r\n  said Roger Clerk, who knew nothing of either of the arts aforesaid,\r\n  being neither experienced nor approved therein, nor understood\r\n  anything of letters, came to the house of him, Roger atte Hacche, in\r\n  the parish of St. Martin, in Ismongereslane, in London, on Thursday,\r\n  the morrow of Ash Wednesday, in the 5th year, etc.; and there saw one\r\n  Johanna, the wife of the aforesaid Roger atte Hacche, who was then\r\n  lying ill with certain bodily infirmities, and gave the said Roger,\r\n  her husband, to understand, that he was experienced and skilled in\r\n  the art of medicine, and could cure the same Johanna of her maladies,\r\n  if her husband desired it.\r\n\r\n  [39] Wandsworth.\r\n\r\n  Whereupon, the said Roger atte Hacche, trusting in his words, gave\r\n  him 12 pence, in part payment of a larger sum which he was to pay\r\n  him, in case the said Johanna should be healed. And upon this, the\r\n  same Roger Clerk then and there gave to the said Roger atte Hacche an\r\n  old parchment, cut or scratched across, being the leaf of a certain\r\n  book, and rolled it up in a piece of cloth of gold, asserting that it\r\n  would be very good for the fever and ailments of the said Johanna;\r\n  and this parchment, so rolled up, he put about her neck, but in no\r\n  way did it profit her; and so, falsely and maliciously, he deceived\r\n  the same Roger atte Hacche. And he produced the said parchment here\r\n  in Court, wrapped up in the same cloth, in proof of the matters\r\n  aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  And the said Roger Clerk personally appeared, and the said parchment\r\n  was shown to him by the Court, and he was asked what the virtue of\r\n  such piece of parchment was; whereupon, he said that upon it was\r\n  written a good charm for fevers. Upon being further asked by the\r\n  Court what were the words of this charm of his, he said;--“Anima\r\n  Christi, sanctifica me; Corpus Christi, salva me; in isanguis\r\n  Christi, nebria me; cum bonus Christus tu, lava me.”[40] And the\r\n  parchment being then examined, not one of those words was found\r\n  written thereon. And he was then further told by the Court, that a\r\n  straw[41] beneath his foot would be of just as much avail for fevers,\r\n  as this said charm of his was; whereupon, he fully granted that it\r\n  would be so. And because that the same Roger Clerk was in no way\r\n  a literate man, and seeing that on the examination aforesaid, (as\r\n  well as on others afterwards made,) he was found to be an infidel,\r\n  and altogether ignorant of the art of physic or of surgery; and to\r\n  the end that the people might not be deceived and aggrieved by such\r\n  ignorant persons, etc.; it was adjudged that the same Roger Clerk\r\n  should be led through the middle of the City, with trumpets and\r\n  pipes, he riding on a horse without a saddle, the said parchment and\r\n  a whetstone, for his lies, being hung about his neck, an urinal also\r\n  being hung before him, and another urinal on his back. [_Letter-Book\r\n  H. 145._]\r\n\r\n  [40] “Soul of Christ, sanctify me; body of Christ, save me; blood of\r\n  Christ, saturate me; as Thou art good, Christ, wash me.”\r\n\r\n  [41] In allusion, perhaps, to the custom of men who were ready to\r\n  perjure themselves, as false witnesses, to go about with a straw\r\n  sticking out from between the foot and the shoe--“men of straw.”\r\n  [Riley.]\r\n\r\n1390. In connection with the Surgeons’ Guild, four Master Surgeons of\r\nthe City were sworn before the Mayor, etc., in this year, and _they_\r\nwere to make scrutiny amongst persons practising the art of Surgery,\r\nand to present defaults. [_Letter-Book H._ 248.] It will be remembered\r\nthat in 1369 a somewhat similar Ordinance was made for the Surgeons’\r\nGuild, and this one in 1390 was probably obtained as a set off to the\r\npowers vested in the Barbers by their Ordinance of 1376, and by way\r\nof assertion of equal rights with them in matters surgical. Anyhow\r\nit is very clear that there were two distinct bodies within the City\r\nruling the craft of Surgery at this period, each, no doubt, claiming\r\njurisdiction over its own members, and both anxious and ready to\r\ninterfere with outsiders, and probably with each other. It is curious\r\nto note that in the Ordinance of 1390, above referred to, the Masters\r\ninspecting are authorised to make scrutiny not only of men, but of\r\n“women undertaking cures, or practising the art of Surgery”; and here,\r\nin the 19th century, we find history repeating itself, and women again\r\n“intermeddling in matters surgical.”\r\n\r\nAs might be expected the dual scrutiny exercised over persons\r\npractising surgery, by two distinct and antagonistic Companies,\r\nproduced considerable jealousy and unpleasantness, and there are\r\nvarious records extant indicative of cases of attempted interference\r\nwith the Barbers’ privileges, one of which is distinctly stated to have\r\nbeen the work of the Surgeons and Physicians, as doubtless also were\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n1410. By _Letter-Book I._ 94, it appears that the Ordinances for the\r\nBarbers made in 1376 were confirmed to them with the significant\r\naddition that they should enjoy the same, “without the scrutiny of\r\nany person or persons of any other craft or trade, under any name\r\nwhatsoever other than the craft or trade of the said Barbers, either\r\nas to shaving, making incision, blood letting or any other matters\r\npertaining to the art of Barbery or of Surgery, in the craft of the\r\nsaid Barbers now practised, or to be practised hereafter.” This\r\nOrdinance is, I think, clearly directed against the Masters of the\r\nSurgeons’ Guild, who had sought to exercise their authority over the\r\nBarbers using the faculty of Surgery.\r\n\r\n1415. Complaint having been made to the Mayor and Aldermen, concerning\r\nthe unskilful and fraudulent practice of certain Barbers in matters of\r\nSurgery, the privileges of the Barbers were again recorded, though the\r\nCompany who had hitherto nominated their own Masters, were somewhat\r\nshorn of that privilege, as the Mayor, etc., directed the names of all\r\nthe Barber (Surgeons) to be brought before them, and after due enquiry,\r\n_they_ selected two of them for Masters, and gave them their charge and\r\noath.\r\n\r\n1416. “Certain trustworthy and discreet” Barber (Surgeons) complained\r\nto the Mayor, etc., that notwithstanding the last order, there were\r\nstill unruly members in the craft, and a fresh Ordinance was enacted\r\nwhich imposed a penalty on offenders.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinances above referred to are to be found in _Letter-Book I._\r\n149, and are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Be it remembered, that on the 10th day of April, in the 3rd year,\r\n  etc. (_1415_) it was intimated in a relation, and not without alarm,\r\n  unto Thomas Fauconer, Mayor, and the Aldermen, how that some barbers\r\n  of the said city, who are inexperienced in the art of surgery, do\r\n  oftentimes take under their care many sick and maimed persons,\r\n  fraudulently obtaining possession of very many of their goods\r\n  thereby; by reason whereof, they are oftentimes made to be worse\r\n  off at their departure than they were at their coming: and that, by\r\n  reason of the inexperience of the same barbers, such persons are\r\n  oftentimes maimed; to the scandal of such skilful and discreet men\r\n  as practise the art of surgery, and the manifest destruction of the\r\n  people of Our Lord the King.\r\n\r\n  And the said Mayor and Aldermen, wishing to obviate an evil and\r\n  a scandal such as this, as also, to provide a fitting remedy for\r\n  the same, and considering first, how that the said barbers by\r\n  themselves, without the scrutiny of any other persons of any other\r\n  trade or craft,[42] or under any name whatsoever, have supervision\r\n  and scrutiny over all men following the craft of barbery, and within\r\n  the liberty of the said city dwelling, as to all manner of cases\r\n  touching the art of barbery or the practice of surgery, within the\r\n  cognizance, or to come within the cognizance, of the craft of the\r\n  said barbers;--as by a certain Ordinance, made and ordained in the\r\n  time of Richard Merlawe,[43] late Mayor, and the then Aldermen,\r\n  and in the Chamber of the said City of London enrolled, of record\r\n  fully appears;--did determine and ordain that in future, by the\r\n  more substantial part of all the barbers following the practice\r\n  of surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said city,\r\n  there should be chosen two of the most skilful, most wise, and\r\n  most discreet men, of all the barbers following such practice of\r\n  surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said city; seeing\r\n  that oftentimes under their scrutiny and correction there would\r\n  be found cases of possible death and maiming, where, if ignorant\r\n  and indiscreet men should undertake the management thereof--the\r\n  which might God forbid--in their judgment grievous errors might\r\n  unexpectedly ensue, by reason of such unskilfulness. And that the\r\n  same Masters, so often as they should be thus chosen, on election\r\n  should be presented to the Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being,\r\n  there by the said Mayor and Aldermen to be accepted and sworn etc.\r\n\r\n  [42] See the Ordinance of 1410.\r\n  [43] Mayor 1409-10.\r\n\r\n  And lest perchance a difference of opinion might in future as to\r\n  such election arise, therefore, the said Mayor and Aldermen, after\r\n  taking counsel on the matter aforesaid, on Friday, the 3rd day of\r\n  May, in the same year (_1415_), caused to be brought before them the\r\n  name of every barber who followed the practice of surgery and dwelt\r\n  within the liberty of the said city, in order that, after enquiring\r\n  into the duties and experiences of their practice and skill, in\r\n  manner theretofore approved and customary, they might be the better\r\n  able to accept such Masters. And hereupon, because that, among other\r\n  names, Simon Rolf and Richard Wellys, citizens and barbers of the\r\n  said city practising the art of surgery, as well for their knowledge\r\n  and probity, as for the different kinds of difficult cures that had\r\n  been sagaciously performed and effected by them, were by trustworthy\r\n  testimony, upon sound and umblemished information, commended before\r\n  any others, precept was given by the said Mayor and Aldermen to\r\n  Baldwin Tettisbury, one of the serjeants of the said Mayor, to summon\r\n  the said Simon and Richard for Monday the 6th day of May then next\r\n  ensuing, to appear before the said Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber\r\n  of the Guildhall aforesaid, there to make the oath to them by the\r\n  said Mayor and Aldermen to be administered.\r\n\r\n  Upon which Monday the said Simon and Richard, by virtue of such\r\n  summons, appeared before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber\r\n  aforesaid. And hereupon the said Simon and Richard were then accepted\r\n  by the said Mayor and Aldermen, and sworn upon the Holy Evangelists\r\n  of God, well and faithfully to watch over and oversee all manner of\r\n  barbers practising the art of surgery, and within the liberty of the\r\n  said city dwelling; to maintain and observe the rules and ordinances\r\n  of the craft or practice aforesaid; no one to spare, for love,\r\n  favour, gain, or hate; diligently without concealment to present unto\r\n  the Chamberlain of the said City, for the time being, such defaults\r\n  as they may find; at all times, when duly required thereto, well and\r\n  faithfully to examine wounds, bruises, hurts, and other infirmities,\r\n  without asking anything for their trouble; and what they should\r\n  find, at their discretion, when duly required thereto, distinctly\r\n  to certify unto the Mayor and Aldermen of the said City, for the\r\n  time being; as also, well and faithfully to conduct themselves from\r\n  thenceforth in future; and all other things to do and perform, which\r\n  of right are befitting or requisite for the masters or overseers of\r\n  such practice to do.\r\n\r\n  AFTERWARDS, on the fourth day of July, in the 4th year, etc. (_1416_)\r\n  before Nicholas Wottone, Mayor, the Recorder, and the Aldermen, in\r\n  full Court, upon truthful information of certain trustworthy and\r\n  discreet men of the craft of Barbers, practising the art of surgery\r\n  aforesaid, as of other able and substantial men of the said city, it\r\n  was stated how that, notwithstanding the Ordinance aforesaid, very\r\n  many inexperienced men of the said craft of Barbers, indiscreetly\r\n  practising the art of surgery, did presume, and in their presumption\r\n  pretend, that they were wiser than the Masters inspecting, and, as\r\n  to certain infirmities--indiscreetly excusing themselves therein,\r\n  on the insufficient grounds that they are not liable to the peril\r\n  of maiming or of death--did altogether disdain to give notice of\r\n  the same to the said Masters inspecting, according to the Ordinance\r\n  aforesaid, or to be discreetly examined by them as to the same, or\r\n  diligently to be questioned thereon. Upon which pretence, they did\r\n  not hesitate daily to take sick persons, in peril of death and of\r\n  maiming, under their care, without shewing such sick persons, or such\r\n  infirmities and perils, unto the same Masters inspecting; by reason\r\n  of which presumption or unskilfulness, such sick persons were exposed\r\n  to the greatest peril, either of maiming or of death. Wherefore, the\r\n  said Mayor and Aldermen were prayed that, for the common advantage of\r\n  the whole realm, and the especial honour of the said city, they would\r\n  deign to provide some sure remedy for the same.\r\n\r\n  And accordingly, the Mayor and Aldermen, assenting to the said\r\n  petition, as being just and consistent with reason, having taken\r\n  diligent counsel as to the matters aforesaid, and considering that\r\n  very many of such persons in these times are more in dread of loss\r\n  or payment of money than amenable to the dictates of honesty or a\r\n  safe conscience, did ordain and enact, that no barber, practising\r\n  the art of surgery within the liberty of the said City, should\r\n  presume in future to take under his care any sick person who is in\r\n  peril of death or of maiming, unless he should show the same person,\r\n  within three days after so taking him under his care, to the Masters\r\n  inspecting, for the time being, by the barbers practising the art\r\n  of surgery within the liberty of the said City to be elected, and\r\n  to the Mayor and Aldermen presented, and by them specially to be\r\n  admitted; under a penalty of 6_s._ 8_d._ to the Chamber of London in\r\n  form underwritten to be paid, so often as, and when, against this\r\n  Ordinance they should be found to act; namely, 5 shillings to the use\r\n  of the Chamber of the Guildhall, and 20 pence to the use of the craft\r\n  of the Barbers.\r\n\r\n1423. In this year certain Ordinances were made by the Mayor (Sir\r\nWilliam Walderne) and Court of Aldermen which are entered in\r\n_Letter-Book K._ 6{B.} This record relates to what Mr. D’Arcy Power,\r\nin his “Memorials of the Craft of Surgery,” has termed a “Conjoint\r\nCollege” of the Physicians and Surgeons, and has little to do with our\r\nCompany, beyond the fact that the scrutiny and oversight of persons\r\npractising Surgery is given to the Masters of the Surgeons’ Guild.\r\nThe subject of these Ordinances and many very interesting remarks\r\nthereon and on the Conjoint College may be seen at p. 52, &c., of Mr.\r\nD’Arcy Power’s work; and the record itself is set forth in full at\r\np. 299; furthermore, extracts from it, so far as the same relate to\r\nthe privileges and practice of the Surgeons, are to be found in the\r\nbeautiful old vellum MS. formerly belonging to that Guild, and now in\r\nthe possession of the Barbers’ Company.\r\n\r\nArmed with this additional authority, the Surgeons’ Guild again sought\r\nto interfere with and scrutinize the Barber-Surgeons of the Barbers’\r\nCompany. These latter, however, must have had good friends at Court,\r\nand were not slow in asserting and obtaining confirmation of their\r\nrights and privileges, as will be seen by reference to the following\r\nrecord in _Letter-Book K._ 27{B.}:--\r\n\r\n  1424. MEMORANDUM. That on Friday the 10th day of November in the\r\n  third year of the reign of Henry the Sixth from the Conquest\r\n  before John Michell, Mayor, Thomas Knolles and other Aldermen, and\r\n  Simon Seman and John Bithewater, Sheriffs of the City of London,\r\n  It was granted and ordained that the Masters of the faculty of\r\n  Surgery within the craft of Barbers of the same city, do exercise\r\n  the same faculty even as fully and entirely as in the times of\r\n  Thomas Fauconer late Mayor, and other Mayors, it was granted unto\r\n  them, notwithstanding the false accusation (_calumpnia_) which the\r\n  Rector and Supervisors of Physic and the Masters of Surgery pretend\r\n  concerning a certain ordinance made in the time of William Walderne\r\n  late Mayor (_1423_) and entered in the letter book K, folio 6, the\r\n  which, they now endeavour to enjoin upon the said Barbers.\r\n\r\n1451. With the exception of a few references (which are noticed\r\nelsewhere) the City records are silent concerning the Barbers’ Company\r\nuntil this year, when the Master and Wardens, styled here “Gardiani,”\r\nwith certain honest men of the Mystery of Barbers, brought a Bill\r\nbefore the Mayor and Aldermen, praying them to establish certain\r\nOrdinances, and to enter them of record, which was granted and done.\r\n\r\nThese Ordinances provided for the enforcement of stated penalties\r\nin cases of disobedience and related to attendance upon summons,\r\nsettlements of disputes, refusal of office, admission of members, evil\r\nspeaking, assemblies and payments, instruction of “foreyns,” employment\r\nof aliens. They are to be found in _Letter-Book K._ 250, and are the\r\nfirst written in English, all previous ones being either in Latin or\r\nNorman French in the originals.\r\n\r\n  MEMORANDUM q{d.} xxv{to.} die ffebruarii Anno regni Regis Henrici\r\n  Sexti post conquestˀ vicesimo nono veniunt hic in Curˀ Dñi Regis\r\n  in Camˀa Guyhald Civitatis london coram Nich̃o Wyfold Maiore &\r\n  Aldermannis ejusdem Civitatꝭ magistˀ & Gardianˀ necnon cẽti probi\r\n  homines misterˀ barbitonsoꝜ Civitatꝭ p’dcẽ & porrexerunt dcisˀ Maiore\r\n  & Aldermannis quandam billam sive supplicacioñe vˀboꝜ sequentˀ seviem\r\n  continentem Unto the ryght Worshipfull and Worshipfull lord and\r\n  souvˀaignes Mair and Aldremen of the Citee of London,\r\n\r\n  BESECHEN most mekely all pˀsones enfˀunchised in the craft and\r\n  mistier of Barbours wythin the said Citee That it please unto your\r\n  lordshippˀ and Right wise discrecions for to consider howe that for\r\n  as moche as certein ordin{a}nces been establisshed made and entred\r\n  of Record in the ch{a}umber of the yeldhall of the said Citee all\r\n  pˀsonnes of the said Craft have fully in opinion for to obeye observe\r\n  and kepe theim and noon other in eny Wise, So been y{r.} many and\r\n  divˀse defaultes often tymes amonges your said besechers not duely\r\n  corrected for default of such other ordin{a}nces to be made and\r\n  auctorised sufficiently of record in the said ch{a}umber, like it\r\n  therefore unto your said lordshippe and grete Wisdoms of your blessed\r\n  disposicons for the pˀpetuell Wele and good Rule of the said Craft\r\n  for to establissh and make these ordinaunces here folowyng pˀpetuelly\r\n  to endure and for to be observed and putte in due execucion in the\r\n  same craft And to be auctorised of record in the said ch{a}umber\r\n  for evˀ And your said besechers shall pray god for you.\r\n\r\n  FFIRST that evˀy barbour enfˀ{a}uncheised householder and other\r\n  occupier of the same craft holdyng eny shopp of barberye wythin the\r\n  Citee of london shall be redy att all manˀ som̃ons of the Maisters\r\n  and Wardeins of the same craft for the tyme being that is to sey for\r\n  the Kyng the Mair or for eny Worshipp of the said Citee And yef eny\r\n  man occupying the said craft in manˀe and fourme aforesaid absent him\r\n  from eny such som̃ons wythoute cause reasonable and thereof duely\r\n  convict than he to pay at the ch{a}umber of the yeldhall xiij{s.}\r\n  iiij{d.} that is to say vj{s.} viij{d.} to the same ch{a}umber and\r\n  other vj{s.} viij{d.} to the almes of the said craft.

(The articles were ratified confirmed and ordered to be\r\n      entered of Record in the books of the Chamber of London.)\r\n\r\nNothing is now heard of the Surgeons’ Guild for some years, although\r\nthey were still in existence. It is quite probable, that finding the\r\nBarbers had invariably obtained the protection and countenance of the\r\nCity authorities, whenever their privileges had been assailed or called\r\nin question, they had given over their attempts at interference with\r\nthem as hopeless, and allowed our worthy predecessors to continue to\r\n“exercise the faculty of surgery,” in peace; and being unmolested they\r\ndoubtless grew in numbers, in importance, and in the knowledge of their\r\nart, until it was admitted that their position as one of the Guilds,\r\nwarranted them in applying for a Charter of Incorporation, which was\r\ngranted to them by Edward IV in 1462.\r\n\r\n1413. Before proceeding to refer to this important epoch in the history\r\nof our Company, it will be well to introduce a very remarkable\r\nletter, which was written by Thomas Arundell, Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(formerly of York), to the Mayor, etc., of London, in which he\r\ncomplained that the Barbers, being, alas! “without zeal for the law of\r\nGod,” kept their shops open on the Sabbath days, and he besought the\r\nMayor and Aldermen (his “sons in Christ, and dearest friends”) to put a\r\nstop to this practice. No trade, perhaps, has from the earliest days,\r\ndown to our own times, owned such persistent breakers of the Fourth\r\nCommandment as have the Barbers. Our records abound with by-laws,\r\nenacted and renewed over and over again on this subject, and details\r\nof the delinquencies of numerous Barbers in this respect, and of their\r\npunishments by fine and imprisonment crop up everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop’s letter reveals to us the fact, that nearly 500 years\r\nago, men were constituted much as they are now; in that “that which\r\ntouches the body or the purse, is held more in dread than that which\r\nkills the soul,” and he shrewdly suggests that the clerical punishment\r\nof “the greater excommunication,” should be augmented by a fine to be\r\nlevied by the Civil authority. This letter is so deeply interesting\r\nthat no apology is needed for reproducing it here. The original is to\r\nbe found in _Letter-Book I._ 125.\r\n\r\n  1413. On the 24th day of July, in the first year, etc. (Henry V) the\r\n  Reverend Father in Christ, and Lord, Thomas, by Divine permission,\r\n  Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, and Legate of\r\n  the Apostolic See, sent here, to the Mayor and Aldermen of the City\r\n  of London, certain Letters Close of his, containing words as follow:--\r\n\r\n  “Sons in Christ and dearest friends.--We know that you do seek for\r\n  the things which are of above, and that you will the more readily\r\n  incline to our desires, the more surely that the things as to which\r\n  we write are known to tend to the observance of the Divine law,\r\n  the maintenance of public propriety, and the rule of the Christian\r\n  profession. We do therefore write unto you on this occasion, to\r\n  intimate that when we were presiding of late in our Provincial\r\n  Council, holden at London, with our venerable brethren, the\r\n  Suffragan Bishops, and our clergy of the Province of Canterbury, it\r\n  was publicly made known unto us with universal reprobation, that\r\n  the Barbers of the City of London, over the governance of which\r\n  city you preside, being without zeal for the law of God, and not\r\n  perceiving how that the Lord hath blessed the seventh day and made\r\n  it holy, and hath commanded that it shall be observed by no abusive\r\n  pursuit of any servile occupations, but rather by a disuse thereof,\r\n  in their blindness do keep their houses and shops patent and open on\r\n  the seventh day, the Lord’s Day, namely, and do follow their craft\r\n  on the same, just as busily, and just in the same way, as on any\r\n  day in the week, customary for such work. Wherefore we, with the\r\n  consent and assent of our said Suffragans and clergy, in restraint\r\n  of such temerity as this, have determined that there must be made\r\n  solemn prohibition thereof in the City aforesaid, and that, of our\r\n  own authority, and that of our said Provincial Council; and not there\r\n  only, but also throughout the Diocese of London, and each of the\r\n  cities both of our own Diocese and of our Province of Canterbury; to\r\n  the effect, that such barbers must not keep their houses and shops\r\n  patent or open, or follow their craft, on such Lord’s Days for the\r\n  future, on pain of the greater excommunication; in the same manner as\r\n  it has been enacted and observed of late in our time, as to the City\r\n  and Diocese of York, as we do well recollect. But, dearest children,\r\n  seeing that so greatly has the malice of men increased in these days,\r\n  a thing to be deplored--that temporal punishment is held more in\r\n  dread than clerical, and that which touches the body or the purse\r\n  more than that which kills the soul, we do heartily intreat you, and,\r\n  for the love of God and of His law, do require and exhort you, that,\r\n  taking counsel thereon, you will enact and ordain a competent penalty\r\n  in money, to be levied for the Chamber of your City, or such other\r\n  purpose as you shall think best, upon the Barbers within the liberty\r\n  of your City aforesaid, who shall be transgressors in this respect;\r\n  that so at least, those whom fear of the anger of God does not avail\r\n  to withold from breach of His law, may be restrained by a scourge\r\n  inflicted upon their purse, in the way of pecuniary loss; knowing\r\n  that we in the meantime, after taking counsel hereon, will devise\r\n  measures for the prevention of this, and for the due publication of\r\n  our Provincial enactment aforesaid. Fare you well always in Christ.\r\n\r\n  Written at Ikham[46] on the 13th day of the month of July.\r\n\r\n  [46] Near Wingham, Kent.\r\n\r\n                                   THOMAS, Archbishop of Canterbury.”\r\n\r\nAn Ordinance was forthwith made thereupon, to the effect, that no\r\nbarber, his wife, son, daughter, apprentice, or servant, should work\r\nat such craft on Sundays within the liberty of the city, either in hair\r\ncutting or shaving, on pain of paying 6_s._ 8_d._ for each offence;\r\n5_s._ thereof to go to the new work at the Guildhall, and the remainder\r\nto the Wardens or Masters of the Barbers within the city.[47]\r\n\r\n[47] Riley p. 594.\r\n\r\n1422. In August of this year Henry V died, and thirty-two of the City\r\nCompanies assisted at his obsequies, going in procession and carrying\r\ntorches. From an entry in _Letter-Book K._ 1{B.}, it appears that the\r\nBarbers bore four torches on this occasion.\r\n\r\n1447. This year the Company seem to have contributed 40_s._ towards\r\nthe cost of the Roof of the Chapel at Guildhall, as appears by the\r\nfollowing entry in _Journal IV_, 198 (25th October, 26 Henry VI)--\r\n\r\n  Itmˀ gardiani misterˀ barbitonsoꝜ & importaverunt in Cur xl{s.}\r\n  sterlingoꝜ pˀse & misterˀ sua ad coopturam Guyhaɫd Sc̃. Capelle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE BARBERS INCORPORATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered two distinct and somewhat hostile\r\nfraternities, the Surgeons on the one hand, and on the other the\r\nBarbers (consisting of Barbers and Barber-Surgeons), both of them\r\nCity Guilds, existing by prescription, having independent rules and\r\nOrdinances for their government and the scrutiny and correction of\r\nabuses in their respective Crafts, the former Company few in number,\r\nthe latter far more numerous and popular; the Surgeons without, and the\r\nBarbers with, a Livery.\r\n\r\nOf these two fraternities, the Barbers by the regular and every day\r\nnature of their calling, as shavers and hair cutters, together with the\r\npractice of Surgery combined by so many of them, were the most likely\r\nto become the more popular Company; their fees would surely be on a\r\nlower scale than those of the more aristocratic Surgeons, and their\r\nnumbers and constant intercourse with the citizens, in their capacity\r\nas Barbers, enabled them easily to extend their connection as Surgeons.\r\n\r\nIn all their contentions with the Surgeons’ Guild, as far as we know,\r\nthey held their own well, and thus it was that their place in the City,\r\nas a Livery Guild of at that time an ancient standing, their position\r\nas the professors of useful and scientific arts, their numbers and\r\npresumable affluence, all rendered it desirable that they should be\r\nplaced upon the same footing as the better class of Guilds, by their\r\nacquisition of a Charter of Incorporation, which they accordingly\r\nobtained from the young King Edward IV in the first year of his reign\r\n(1462).\r\n\r\nThomas Knot (Master, 1555) has recorded in one of our books, a\r\nTranslation of this Charter, which Mr. J. Flint South (who does not\r\nappear to have seen the original Latin one) has transcribed, and this\r\nhas been adopted by Mr. D’Arcy Power (page 326). Thomas Knot wrote a\r\ngood hand, and was a zealous champion of the Barber-Surgeons in his\r\ntime, but he made egregious blunders in some of the writings recorded\r\nover his signature, and although there is not great fault to be found\r\nwith him in this instance, it is suggested that the Translation given\r\nbelow, is perhaps a more literal one than that which Knot has handed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe Charter is still preserved at our Hall, and is contained on a small\r\nskin of parchment; the initial letters of the title, which were at the\r\ntime left to be illuminated have never been filled in, and the document\r\nis therefore not the work of art which one is accustomed to see in\r\nCharters of this period; it bears signs of having been frequently used,\r\nthe ink in some places being worn, and the words only legible with the\r\naid of a magnifying glass. The great seal pendant is not quite perfect,\r\nbut is a beautiful specimen and highly artistic. The following is the\r\ntext of the Charter:--\r\n\r\n  (E)DWARDUS dei grã (R)ex (A)nglie & (F)rancie & (D)ominus (H)ibñie.\r\n  (O)mnibus ad quos pˀsentes lrẽ pˀuenint saltm̃ (S)ciatis q̃d\r\n  nos considerantes qualitˀ Diɫci nõb prˀbi & liᵬi hoiẽs mistere\r\n  BarbitonsoꝜ Ciuitatis nr̃e london vtentes mistera siue facultate\r\n  SirurgicoꝜ tam circa vulña plagas lesiones & alias infirmitates\r\n  ligeoꝜ nroꝜ ibidem curandˀ & Sauandˀ q{a}m in extracc͠oe sanguinis\r\n  & denc̃iu hˀmꝰ ligeoꝜ nrõꝜ g{a}ndes & multiplices intendencias &\r\n  labores pˀ longa tempora sustinuerunt & supportauerunt indiesqʒ\r\n  sũtinere & supportare non desistunt qualitˀ etiam pˀ ignoranciam\r\n  negligenciam & insipienciam nonnulloꝜ hˀmꝰ barbitonsoꝜ tam liᵬoꝜ\r\n  hõim Ciuitatis nr̃e pˀdc̃e q{a}m alioꝜ SirurgicoꝜ forincecoꝜ & non\r\n  liᵬoꝜ hõim eiusdem Ciuitatis indies ad eandem Ciuitatem confluenciũ\r\n  & in mistera SirurgicoꝜ minus sufficientˀ eruditoꝜ q{a}m plurima ac\r\n  quasi infinita mala diuˀsis ligeis nr̃is in vulnĩbʒ plagis lesionibʒ\r\n  & aliis infirmitatibʒ suis pˀ huius modi Barbitonsores & Sirurgicos\r\n  sauandis & curandis ob eoꝜ defc̃m ante hec tempora euenerunt quoꝜ\r\n  quidem ligeoꝜ nroꝜ alii ea de causa viam vniuˀse carnis sunt\r\n  ingressi alii autem eadem causa tanq{a}m insanabiles & incurabiles\r\n  sunt ab omĩbʒ derelecti similia qʒ mala vel peiora infuturˀ in hac\r\n  parte euenire formidatˀ nisi remedm̃ congruũ supˀ hoc pˀ nos cicius\r\n  pˀuidetuˀ Nos enim attendentes & intime adũtentes qˀd huiusmodi\r\n  mala ligeis nr̃is ob defc̃tuˀ debit supˀuis scrutinii correccõis &\r\n  punicõis huiusmodi barbitonsoꝜ & SirurgicoꝜ minus sufficientˀ in\r\n  eisdem misteris siue facultatibʒ vt pˀdcm̃ est eruditˀ & instructˀ\r\n  euenire contingunt.

WE\r\n  therefore, heartily weighing and considering that such evils do\r\n  happen to our liegemen for want of the examinations, corrections,\r\n  and punishments by a due supervision of such Barbers and Surgeons\r\n  as are insufficiently skilled and instructed in the said mysteries\r\n  or arts as aforesaid; have at the humble request of our aforesaid\r\n  beloved, honest, and freemen of the said Mystery of Barbers in our\r\n  said city, granted to them that the said Mystery, and all men of the\r\n  said Mystery aforesaid, may be in deed and name one body and one\r\n  perpetual Community, and that two Principals of the said Community\r\n  may, with the consent of twelve persons, or at least eight of the\r\n  said Community who are best skilled in the mystery of Surgery, every\r\n  year elect and make out of the Community, two Masters or Governors\r\n  of the utmost skill, to superintend rule and govern the Mystery\r\n  and Community aforesaid and all men of the said Mystery, and of\r\n  the businesses of the same for ever. AND THAT the said Masters or\r\n  Governors and Community may have a perpetual succession and common\r\n  seal to serve for the affairs of the said Community for ever, and\r\n  that they and their successors for ever may be able and capable to\r\n  acquire and possess in fee and perpetuity lands, tenements, rents,\r\n  and other possessions whatsoever, to the value of five marks per\r\n  annum, besides reprises. And that they, by the name of the Masters\r\n  or Governors and Community of Barbers of London, may be able to\r\n  plead and to be impleaded before whatsoever Justices in Courts,\r\n  and actions whatsoever. And that the said Masters or Governors and\r\n  Community, and their successors, may lawfully and honestly assemble\r\n  themselves, and make statutes and ordinances for the wholesome\r\n  government, superintendence, and correction of the said Mystery,\r\n  according to the exigency of the necessity, as often and whenever\r\n  it may be requisite, lawfully and unpunishably, without leave or\r\n  hindrance of us, our heirs or successors, Justices, Escheators,\r\n  Sheriffs, Coroners, or any other Bailiffs, or servants of us, our\r\n  heirs or successors; provided that such statutes or ordinances are\r\n  not in any ways contrary to the laws and customs of our Kingdom of\r\n  England. WE FURTHER will and grant, for us, our heirs and successors,\r\n  as far as in us lies, that the Masters or Governors of the aforesaid\r\n  Community for the time being, and their successors for ever, shall\r\n  have the superintendence, scrutiny, correction, and government of\r\n  all and singular the freemen of the said City who are Surgeons,\r\n  exercising the Mystery of Barbers within the said City, and of\r\n  all other foreign Surgeons whomsoever, in anywise practising and\r\n  using the said Mystery of Surgeons in the said City and the suburbs\r\n  thereof, and the punishment of them, as well freemen as foreigners,\r\n  for their offences in not perfectly following, practising and using\r\n  that mystery, and also the superintendence and scrutiny of all kinds\r\n  of instruments, plaisters, and other medicines, and their recipes,\r\n  by such Barbers and Surgeons given, applied, and used for our liege\r\n  men, for curing and healing their wounds, bruises, hurts and such\r\n  kind of infirmities, when and as often as shall be requisite for the\r\n  convenience and utility of our liege men; so that punishment of such\r\n  Barbers exercising the said mystery of Surgeons, so offending in the\r\n  premisses, be executed by fines, amerciaments, and imprisonments\r\n  of their bodies, and by other reasonable and suitable means; and\r\n  that no Barber exercising the said mystery of Surgeons in the said\r\n  City and suburbs thereof, or any other foreign Surgeon whatsoever,\r\n  shall in future be admitted to follow, practise and exercise the\r\n  said mystery of Surgeons, in anywise, within the said City or the\r\n  suburbs thereof, unless he be first approved by the said Masters or\r\n  Governors, or their successors, for this purpose able and sufficient\r\n  as skilled in the said Mystery, and for his plenary approbation in\r\n  this behalf, by the said Masters or Governors to the Mayor of the\r\n  said City for the time being, presented. WE ALSO will and grant,\r\n  for us our heirs and successors, as far as in us lies, that neither\r\n  the said Masters or Governors and community of the said Mystery of\r\n  Barbers, nor their successors, nor any of them shall hereafter, in\r\n  anywise be summoned or appointed on any assizes, juries, inquests,\r\n  inquisitions, attainders, or other recognizances, within the said\r\n  City or suburbs thereof for the time to come, before the Mayor or\r\n  Sheriffs or Coroners of our said City for the time being, by any\r\n  summoning officer or his servant, or summoning officers or their\r\n  servants, although the said juries, inquisitions, or recognizances\r\n  should be summoned by a writ or writs of right, of us or our\r\n  heirs, but that the said Masters or Governors and Community of the\r\n  aforesaid Mystery and their successors shall, from henceforth for\r\n  ever, be peaceably and entirely exonerated towards us, our heirs and\r\n  successors, and towards the Mayor and Sheriffs of our said City for\r\n  the time being, and every of their officers and servants, by these\r\n  presents. AND FURTHER, we, in consideration of the premisses, do of\r\n  our special grace, for us and our successors, grant to the said\r\n  Masters or Governors and Community of the said Mystery of Barbers,\r\n  and their successors, this liberty, to wit, that they in all future\r\n  times may admit and receive persons apt and sufficiently skilled\r\n  and informed in the said Mystery of Surgery, and by the Masters or\r\n  Governors for the time being of the said Mystery, in manner aforesaid\r\n  approved, and presented to the Mayor of the said City for the time\r\n  being as aforesaid, into the said Mystery of Barbers to the fredom of\r\n  the said City, to be held and enjoyed according to the custom of the\r\n  said City; and no other persons whomsoever, nor in any other manner,\r\n  any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs or successors, by written\r\n  letters or otherwise howsoever made or to be made to the contrary\r\n  notwithstanding. AND ALTHOUGH the said Masters or Governors and\r\n  Community and their successors should contumaciously use this liberty\r\n  in future against any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs, or\r\n  successors, or any others whomsoever to be made in form aforesaid,\r\n  neither they nor any of them shall in anywise incur any fine,\r\n  contempt, or loss towards us, our heirs or successors, or any damage\r\n  or punishment in their goods or bodies, or towards any other persons\r\n  whatsoever, on that account; AND this without fine or fee for the\r\n  sealing of these presents, to be done paid or otherwise rendered unto\r\n  us; any statute, ordinance, or any act to the contrary, before this\r\n  time published made ordained or provided notwithstanding IN WITNESS\r\n  whereof, we have caused these our letters to be made patent. WITNESS\r\n  myself at Westminster the twenty-fourth day of February in the first\r\n  year of our reign.\r\n\r\n                                                       PEKHAM.\r\n\r\n      By writ of privy seal, and of the date aforesaid, by authority of\r\n      Parliament, and for ten pounds paid into the hanaper.\r\n\r\n      (Endorsed.)\r\n\r\n      Inrolled in the Court of the Lord the King, in the chamber of\r\n      the Guildhall of the City of London in the book marked with the\r\n      letter l. folio thirteen in the third year of the reign of King\r\n      Edward the Fourth from the Conquest.\r\n\r\nThe chief point which strikes us on reading the foregoing Charter is,\r\nthat it contains a great deal relative to Surgery, and little, indeed\r\nnothing, concerning Barbery, and yet it is granted ostensibly to the\r\nBarbers!\r\n\r\nNow the Surgical side being the more important one of the craft, and\r\nthe _raison d’être_ of the Charter being in a great measure to provide\r\nfor the regulation of Surgery and the correction of abuses in that\r\nprofession, this silence as to Barbery and recognition of Surgery would\r\nseem to be an evidence that the practice of the latter, more or less,\r\nwas the rule rather than the exception with members of the Company\r\nof Barbers; and, as the Masters or Governors were empowered to make\r\n“statutes and ordinances” (by-laws) for the governance of the mystery,\r\nit was doubtless considered unnecessary to descend into any details\r\nconcerning shaving and the like in a Royal Charter.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of this Charter is exceedingly quaint and interesting,\r\nreciting how through the “ignorance, negligence and stupidity” of\r\nvarious Barbers and other practitioners in Surgery, many of the King’s\r\nlieges had “gone the way of all flesh.” Then at the request of “our\r\nbeloved, honest and free men of the said Mystery of Barbers,” the King\r\ngrants to them, to be one body perpetual, etc., that two of the chief\r\nmen of the Company (no doubt the two then existing Masters “exercising\r\nthe faculty of Surgery”) may with twelve or at least eight other\r\nskilled Barber-Surgeons, elect two Masters annually: this provision\r\nin itself is singular, as it would seem to imply that the body then\r\nincorporated was to be ruled by two Masters only; but a reference to\r\nour list of Masters and Wardens will shew that from the year 1448\r\nthe Company has been ruled by four Masters, and so on in unbroken\r\nsuccession to the present time[48]; these other two Masters therefore\r\nwere Masters of the Barbers proper, about whom nothing was said in\r\nthe Charter, but who were chosen annually in accordance with ancient\r\ncustom, the Chief or First Master being alternately a Barber, and a\r\nBarber-Surgeon.\r\n\r\n[48] The term “Wardens” is a more modern designation used for\r\nconvenience sake; the Master and the three Wardens are, strictly\r\nspeaking, the four “Masters or Governors.”\r\n\r\nThe Corporation was to have perpetual succession, and a Common seal,\r\nto hold lands of a certain value, to be able to plead and to be\r\nimpleaded, to make by-laws, to have the scrutiny and correction of\r\n(apparently _all_) Surgeons in the City and suburbs, as also the\r\noversight of all their instruments and medicines, etc., and to have the\r\npower of inflicting punishment, by fine or imprisonment, on offenders.\r\nNone were to practise Surgery until examined and approved by the\r\nMasters and presented to the Mayor, and authority was given for the\r\nfreemen of the Company to be admitted into the freedom of the City.\r\n\r\nAnother clause in the Charter was one which, whilst it conferred a\r\nvaluable privilege upon the Company, was a source of continual strife\r\nand conflict with the Civic authorities, for by it _all_ our freemen\r\nclaimed to be exempted from serving on Juries and inquisitions, and\r\nthis immunity, though constantly disputed, was as often asserted and\r\nmaintained, with various qualifications.\r\n\r\nIn _The Times_, November 26, 1839, is an account of the exemption of\r\ncertain freemen of the Company from serving on Juries at the Central\r\nCriminal Court. In this instance neither the claimants nor the Recorder\r\nknew much about the matter--for one of the applicants said, in reply to\r\nthe Recorder, “I rest my claim on the Charter of _Henry VIII_”_!!_ And,\r\nfurther on in the discussion, the same bold Barber had the effrontery\r\nto declare that “the privilege was confirmed by an Act passed in the\r\nreign of George II.” This was the Act which separated the Surgeons from\r\nthe Barbers, and which did _not_ confirm to the latter the exemption\r\nclaimed, but our freeman gained his point, and the Recorder only\r\ngrumbled.\r\n\r\nAs recently as 1868, a case was submitted to Sir J. D. Coleridge (now\r\nLord Chief Justice) as to the legality of the exemption, and he gave\r\nhis opinion in favour of it. However, since then the Jury Act has,\r\nalas! swept away this cherished immunity, and thus let the Barbers down\r\nto the level of their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nWith the possession of their Charter the Company were now in an\r\nunassailable position, and we hear no more of their molestation by the\r\nGuild of Surgeons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Grant_ by RICHARD THORNBURY, Citizen and Draper of\r\nLondon, to Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon, John Dagvile, Surgeon,\r\nWilliam Sipnam, Grocer, and Walter Bartlot, Fishmonger, Citizens of\r\nLondon, for ever, of all his title in two shops and solars with their\r\nappurtenances, in the parish of Saint John upon Walbroke, formerly\r\nbelonging to John Blounde of Braughyng in the County of Hertford, and\r\nwhich had been already conveyed to the Grantees by John Thornbury,\r\ngentleman, and Walter Thornbury, Clerk, which shops were situate\r\nbetween the tenements of William Horn, Citizen and Draper, towards\r\nthe north and south, and the tenement of the Prior and Convent of the\r\nBlessed Mary without Bishopsgate towards the east, and the King’s\r\nhighway leading from Walbroke to Dowgate towards the west. Dated 11th\r\nMay, 2 Edward IV (1462).]\r\n\r\n1470. The Company about this period came into possession of some\r\nfreehold houses in St. John the Baptist upon Walbrook, to be held\r\nboth for trust and corporate purposes. These houses are stated in our\r\nbooks to have been devised to us by Will (dated 2nd Dec., 1470) of\r\nRobert Ferbras. There are three old title deeds of the period still\r\nat the Hall, relating to these houses, and in the Court of Husting at\r\nGuildhall are two Wills of Robert Ferbras, Surgeon, both proved, one\r\ndated 4th Nov., 1470, and the other 17th April, 1472--but neither of\r\nthese contain the bequest to the Barbers. It is, therefore, probable\r\nthat Robert Ferbras conveyed the houses to the Company in his lifetime,\r\nand this fact being overlooked in course of years, it came to be said\r\nthat they passed by his Will.\r\n\r\n1482. 26th April.--The Company applied to the Court of Aldermen,\r\npresenting a set of ordinances for the government of the craft and for\r\nthe regulation of apprentices, praying that the same might be allowed\r\nand ratified, which was done. The official entry under this date is in\r\n_Letter-Book L._ 174, and the following are the Ordinances:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  Ordinacio  }\r\n  BarbitonsoꝜ}]\r\n\r\n  Memorand qˀd sexto decimo die Aprilis Anno regni Regis Edwardi quarti\r\n  post conq̃m vicesimo scᵭo pˀᵬi hõies Artis sive mistere BarbitonsoꝜ\r\n  Civitatis london venˀ hic in Curˀ dc̃i Dnĩ Regis in Camˀa Guyhald\r\n  Civitatꝭ pˀdcĩ coram Willm̃e Haryot milite ac maiore & Aldr̃is\r\n  ejusdem Civitatis et porrexer̃nt eisdem maiore & Aldr̃is quand{a}m\r\n  billam sive supplicacõem Cujus tenor sequitur in hec verba.\r\n\r\n  TO THE RIGHT hono{r}able lord the Mair And the right wirshipful\r\n  Sovˀaignes the Aldermen of the Citee of London Mekely besechen your\r\n  goode lordship̃ and maistershippes all the pˀsones enfraunchesed in\r\n  the crafte and mistere of Barbours w{t}in the Citee of london That\r\n  it wold pleas the same your lordshipp and maistershippes for the\r\n  Wirship̃ of the said Citee And for the goode Rule to be had w{t}in\r\n  the saide Craft to graunte and establissh thise articles folowyng And\r\n  theym to be entred of Recorde in the Chambre of the said Citee before\r\n  your said lordship and maistershippes hereafter for to be observed\r\n  and executed.\r\n\r\n  FFIRST that there shall no ffraunchesed Barbo{r.} w{t}in the said\r\n  Citee take any man or Child to be his Apprentice before that he hath\r\n  pˀsented the same man or Child unto the maister and Wardeyns of the\r\n  said Craft for the tyme being, to thentent that the same maister and\r\n  Wardeyns may duely examyne ovˀsee serche and behold by the Colour and\r\n  complexion of the said man or Child if he be avexed or disposed to be\r\n  lepur or gowty maymed or disfigured in any pˀties of his body Whereby\r\n  he shall fall in disdeyn or lothefulnesse unto the sight of the Kingꝭ\r\n  liege people And also to be examyned of his birth and of his kynrede\r\n  or if there be on hym any bonde claymed, And if he be founde defectif\r\n  in any of thise poyntꝭ that than no fraunchesed Barbo{r.} of the\r\n  saide Citee shall take hym to his Apprentice uppon payn to pay v{li.}\r\n  Whereof that one half shall Remayn unto the Chambre of the said Citee.\r\n\r\n  ALSO that evˀy enfraunchesed barbour that taketh any apprentice shall\r\n  pay to the almes of the said Craft for the same Apprentice iij{s.}\r\n  iiij{d.} to be paied in fourme folowyng that is to sey, at the first\r\n  pˀsentacion of the Appˀntice xx{d.} and that other xx{d.} in the same\r\n  yeere When he shall be enrolled And the names of the maister and\r\n  appˀntice and the yeres of appˀntishode of the same appˀntice shalbe\r\n  writen in a book by the said maistˀ & Wardeyns And he that disobeith\r\n  this article or orden{a}nce shall pay unto ye almes of the said Craft\r\n  of barbours xiij{s.} iiij{d.} that one half thereof to be applied to\r\n  thuse of the said Chambre and that other half to the almes of the\r\n  said Craft.

The next notice which we have of the Barbers in the City books,\r\nindicates that there had been quarrels and dissensions among them, and\r\nthat the rules of the Craft had been set at nought by its members,\r\nwhereupon a Book of Ordinances was presented to the Court of Aldermen\r\nfor approval and ratification and the same is entered at this date, 20\r\nJuly 2 Hen vij, in _Letter-Book L._ 235{B.} as follows:--\r\n\r\n  MEMORANDUM qˀd xx{o.} die Julij Anno regni Regis Henrici septum\r\n  secundo, Gardiani & aɫ pˀᵬi hõies Artꝭ sive occupacõis de Barbours\r\n  Civitatꝭ london venerˀ hic in Curˀ dc̃i dñi Regis in Camˀa Guilhald\r\n  ejusdem Civitatꝭ coram Henrico Colet milite maiore & Aldr̃is Civitatꝭ\r\n  pˀdc̃i & porrexˀunt eisdm̃ maori & Aldr̃is quandã billam sive\r\n  supplicaõem Cujus tenor sequit{r.} in hec verba,\r\n\r\n  TO the right honourable lord the maire and fulle discrete sovˀaignes\r\n  thaldˀmen of the Citee of london Shewen mekely unto yo{r.} good\r\n  lordeship and maistˀshippes the maister and the Wardeyns and the\r\n  good ffolke of the Crafte or Science of Barbours Surgeons of the\r\n  said Citee that Where as they of longe tyme have been in discorde\r\n  and not of oon conformite, but evˀy man in effect of the said Crafte\r\n  or Science hathe taken and folowed his own singuler way and apetite\r\n  as menne be[49] under no Rule nor obedience, contrarie to all godly\r\n  policie for lacke of good Rules and orden{a}ncꝭ hadde and used within\r\n  the same Crafte or Science, and in especiall for takyng of over\r\n  many appˀnticꝭ and settyng a werk of money[50] fforeyns comyng oute\r\n  of Seint Martyns, Westmynster, Suthwerk and other placꝭ nere unto\r\n  this Citee to the distruccion of the good ffolke enfraunchised of\r\n  the said Crafte or Science, but if[51] a remedie by yo{r} noble and\r\n  grete wisdomes the rather be pˀvided in that behalf.

A declaration made by one Bryan Sandford, dated 8th March, 1490,\r\nwas produced to the Committee of the House of Commons in 1745, in\r\nwhich it was stated that the Company were at that time possessed of the\r\nfreehold of their Hall in Monkwell Street.\r\n\r\n1493. On the 12th July in this year, an agreement was entered into\r\nbetween the Barbers’ Company and the Surgeons’ Guild which would\r\nindicate that the two bodies were now on amicable terms, working\r\nharmoniously for the increase of the credit of the profession, and\r\nfor the correction of inexperienced surgeons and empirics. This\r\n“Composition” is of so interesting a nature that it is here given in\r\nfull, as extracted from the fine old Book of Ordinances at the Hall; it\r\ndid not unite the two bodies in any way beyond this, that they agreed\r\nto follow the same rules and practice with regard to the government of\r\nall Surgeons; that each guild was to choose two Wardens, and that the\r\nfour so chosen were to act in a conjoint capacity as rulers or masters\r\nin matters surgical, and thus comprehend all Surgeons, whether of the\r\nBarbers’ Company, the Surgeons’ Guild, or “foreyns.”\r\n\r\n  This present wrytyng endentyd of copˀosicyons made the xij{th}\r\n  day of July iˀ the zere of owyr lord God M{t}CCCClxxxxiij and the\r\n  viij{th} zere of the reyne of kyng harry the vij{th} William Martyn\r\n  then beyng mayre of this cyte of london betwyxt the ffelishippis of\r\n  surgeons enfraunchesˀ w{t} in the cyte of london on that on p’ty\r\n  And the felishippis of barbours surgeons and surgeons barbours\r\n  enfraunchessid iˀ the seyd cyte on the other parte witnesyth that\r\n  the sayde felyshippys of ther comon assent and mere moc̃yons ben\r\n  c͠odescẽdyd and agreyd togethir the day and the zere aboue sayd, in\r\n  mañ and fourme folowyng.

In rowlid in Raffe Osterigis tyme, mayer.\r\n\r\nOf the persons assenting to this composition, the following were\r\nBarber-Surgeons, viz.: Rob{t.} Halyday (Master 1475, 1483, 1485, 1490,\r\n1496), James Scott (M. 1493, 1498, 1500), James Ingoldysby (M. 1501,\r\n1506), John Taylour (M. 1523, 1524), and Nicholas Leveryng(M. 1503,\r\n1508), the others were most likely belonging to the Guild of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nAn Ordinance by way of addenda to the above was made, imposing\r\npenalties upon any who should break any of the foregoing rules; the\r\nfirst offence to be punished by a fine of 10_s._, the second 20_s._,\r\nand the third offence to be remitted to the Mayor and Aldermen for\r\npunishment after their discretion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF THE TITLE-PAGE TO THE OLD BOOK OF\r\nORDINANCES, REPRESENTING SAINTS COSMO AND DAMIAN (PATRON SAINTS OF\r\nTHE BARBER-SURGEONS) AND THE COAT OF ARMS GRANTED TO THE COMPANY OF\r\nSURGEONS IN 1492. (_See p. 433._)]\r\n\r\nHow long this agreement, so beneficial for the practice of Surgery,\r\ncontinued in force is unknown; but the probabilities are that the old\r\njealousies soon re-appeared and that each Guild worked on its own\r\nlines until 1540, as, by the uniting Act then passed, it was specially\r\nremarked as desirable that the two Companies should come together, and\r\nbe incorporated in one.\r\n\r\n1497. We shall now present to the reader’s notice a highly important\r\ndocument, being a diploma granted by the Master and Wardens of the\r\nBarbers’ Company to one of their freemen, enabling him to practise as\r\na Surgeon. This is in all probability the earliest English diploma of\r\na Surgeon extant and cannot fail by the quaintness of its composition,\r\nand the details given, to prove of much interest. We notice in it, that\r\nour Company as usual, did not fail to rehearse its prerogatives and\r\npractice, and we also observe that thus early the Company provided an\r\ninstructor and examiner in the science, Dr. John Smith, before whom\r\ncame in the Common Hall, Robert Anson, and in the presence of a “great\r\naudience of many right well expert men in Surgery and others, was\r\nopenly examined in divers things concerning the practice,” etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF THE DIPLOMA GRANTED BY THE MASTER AND\r\nWARDENS OF THE BARBER-SURGEONS TO ROBERT ANSON (8 AUG., 1497), ENABLING\r\nHIM TO PRACTISE AS A SURGEON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LETTˀ PAT̃E OF BˀBOURS & OF SURGEOS BˀBORS.\r\n\r\n  To all trew crysten people to whom thes present lettris shall come.\r\n  ROBERD HALIDAI[69] mastur of barbours and of surgeon barbours of\r\n  london, and Willm̄ Okeley, John Knote[70] and Thomas Dawes[71]\r\n  wardens of the same gretyng, knowe ye that wher as the moste\r\n  excellent Pryns in cryst and soũeyn lord Edward by the grace of god\r\n  kyng of ynglõd and of ffraunce, lord of Ierlond, for many pˀfounde\r\n  cos̃ideracyons his gc̃e movyng, hathe grauntyd the well to hym ĩ\r\n  cryst, the approuyd fremen the coiãlte of barbours and of surgeon\r\n  barbours of the cyte of londõ, The serche and oũsyght correcyon\r\n  and ponyshement, examinacon & approbacion of all fremen usyng or\r\n  hauntyng the conyng of surgery and barbory, And of all maner of men\r\n  foreyns usyng or hauntyng any pˀticuler pˀte of surgery withyn the\r\n  seyde cyte or subbers ther of, As a bowte new woundys, olde soris,\r\n  and other lesyons what so eũ they be, Also in drawyng of teeth\r\n  ventosyng scarificacons and suche othˀ manwall operac̃ons, lyke as\r\n  the lettres patentes of owre seyde lege lord the kyng ther upon made\r\n  planyly may apere.

In this year the Company obtained from Henry VII a confirmation\r\nof their Charter, paying but 20_s._ for the same. This Inspeximus\r\nCharter recites and confirms that of Edward IV with the very noticeable\r\nexceptions, that four Masters or Governors are named instead of\r\ntwo, and that they are described as of “the Mystery of Barbers and\r\nSurgeons,” and not “Barbers” only, as in Edward’s grant.\r\n\r\nThe original, in excellent preservation, with the great seal of England\r\npendant, is at the Hall, and the text is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  HENRICUS dei gracia Rex Anglie Francie & Dominus Hibernie Omnibʒ\r\n  ad quos pˀsentes littere pervenerunt, salutem.

In this year an Act of Parliament was passed, which infringed\r\non the privileges of the Barbers’ Company, inasmuch as it placed the\r\napprobation and licensing of Surgeons in the hands of certain clerical\r\ndignitaries, to wit, the Bishop of London and Dean of St. Paul’s\r\n(while for the country the several Bishops or their Vicars general\r\nwere nominated). This Act was possibly the outcome of some laxity on\r\nthe part of our Company, or of an intolerable growth of quackery, with\r\nwhich it could not cope, the pretenders to surgical knowledge being\r\na “great multitude” of ignorant persons, and women, using sorcery,\r\nwitchcraft and noxious remedies. This Act of Parliament (3 Hen. VIII,\r\ncap. XI) as given below, is from an original copy in the possession of\r\nMr. Charles J. Shoppee (Master 1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ AN ACTE CONCERNYNG THE APPROBATION OF PHISICIONS AND SURGIONS.\r\n\r\n  To the kyng our souerayne lorde, and to all the lordes spiritual\r\n  and temporall, & comoñs in this present parlyament assembled.\r\n  FORASMOCHE as the science and connynge of phisike & surgerie (to\r\n  the perfet knowlege whereof, be requisite both great lernyng and\r\n  rype experience) is dayly within this realme exercised by a great\r\n  multitude of ignorant pˀsons: of whome the great part haue no maner\r\n  of insight in the same, nor in any other kynde of lernynge, some also\r\n  can no letters on the boke, so farforthe that common artificers, as\r\n  smythes, weauers, and women, boldely and customably take upon them\r\n  greate cures and thinges of greate difficultie: in the whiche they\r\n  partly use sorcerye, and witchcrafte, partly apply suche medicines\r\n  unto the disease, as be very noyous and nothyng metely therfore to\r\n  the highe displeasure of god, great infamye to the facultie, and the\r\n  greuous hurte, damage, and destruction of many of the kynges liege\r\n  people: most specially of them that can not discerne the unconnynge\r\n  from connynge. Be it therfore (to the suertie and comforte of all\r\n  maner people) by auctoritie of this present parliament enacted,\r\n  that no persone within the citie of London, nor within seuen myles\r\n  of the same, take upon hym to exercise and occupie as a phisition\r\n  or surgion, excepte he be fyrst examyned, approued, and admytted\r\n  by the byshop of London, or by the deane of Paules, for the tyme\r\n  beinge, calling to hym or them foure doctours of phisike, and for\r\n  surgery, other experte persons in that facultie, and for the fyrste\r\n  examination suche as they shall thynke conuenient, and afterwarde\r\n  alway foure of them that haue ben so approued, upon the peine of\r\n  forfayture, for euery moneth that they do occupie as phisitions or\r\n  surgions, not admytted nor examyned after the tenour of this acte, of\r\n  v.li. to be enployed the one halfe therof to thuse of our soueraine\r\n  lorde the kynge, and the other halfe therof to any person that\r\n  wyll sue for it by action of dette, in whiche no wager of lawe nor\r\n  protection shalbe alowed.\r\n\r\n  ¶ And ouer this, that no persone out of the sayd citie and precinte\r\n  of vii. myles of the same, except he haue ben (as is aforesayd)\r\n  approued in y{e} same, take upon hym to exercise and occupie as a\r\n  phisition or surgion, in any diocesse within this realme, but if he\r\n  be fyrste examined and approued by the bysshoppe of the same dyocese,\r\n  or he beynge out of the dioces by his vycare generall: either of\r\n  them callyng to them suche experte persones in the sayde faculties,\r\n  as their discretion shal thynke conuenient, and gyuyng theyr letters\r\n  testimonials under theyr seale to hym that they shall so approue,\r\n  upon lyke peyne to them that occupie contrary to this acte (as\r\n  is above sayde) to be leuied and employed after the forme before\r\n  expressed.\r\n\r\n  ¶ Prouyded alway, that this acte nor any thynge therin contayned, be\r\n  preiudiciall to the uniuersities of Oxforde and Cambrydge or eyther\r\n  of them, or to any priuileges graunted to them.\r\n\r\nThis Act seems to have invested the Bishops, etc., with the power\r\nof licensing _all_ Surgeons, and if so, would have taken away that\r\nprivilege from our Company; the point is however doubtful, and I am\r\ninclined to think that the Act did not operate to the prejudice of the\r\nCompany, only in so far as it suffered from the existence of another\r\nlicensing authority.\r\n\r\nMr. D’Arcy Power has pointed out that the Act very soon became\r\nunpopular, and that it was almost immediately practically repealed by\r\nanother one, which provided that it should be “lawful to any person\r\nbeing the king’s subject, having knowledge or experience of the nature\r\nof herbs, etc., to minister in and to any outward sore or wound\r\naccording to their cunning.” (Memorials of the Craft of Surgery, p. 85.)\r\n\r\nThis latter Act, which in its effect would flood the land with quacks,\r\nmust however have remained the law until the Act of 32 Hen. VIII,\r\nwhereby the Barber-Surgeons were reinstated in their ancient rights;\r\nand it is the fact, that down to the 18th Century the Ecclesiastics\r\nclaimed and enforced their rights (under the Act 3 Hen. VIII) to\r\nlicense Surgeons, notwithstanding other Acts passed since then, which\r\nalthough not expressly extinguishing their power, certainly did not\r\nsave it. The Barber-Surgeons’ Company seem to have examined the\r\nSurgeons, and, if approved, to have given a certificate under Seal,\r\nwhich was presented to the Bishop who thereupon issued his licence.\r\nThis practice was not however universal, and I think only applied\r\nto some Surgeons who were not free of the Company. In some cases\r\nthe Bishop licensed Surgeons, without reference to the Company, and\r\nthousands have been licensed by the Company without regard to the\r\nBishop. It is almost impossible to say now what course was followed,\r\nthe practice certainly varying with the times (see Surgery).\r\n\r\n1513. In this year an Act of Parliament was passed exempting Surgeons\r\nfrom juries, inquests, etc. This must have been passed in the interest\r\nof the Surgeons’ Guild, as the Barber-Surgeons were surely exempt under\r\ntheir Charter from Edward IV.\r\n\r\n1512. The Barbers’ Company having applied to the King (Henry VIII) for\r\na confirmation of their Charter, their request was acceded to. Henry\r\nis, on more than one occasion, spoken of in the books as “our patron,”\r\nand there is no doubt but that he was very friendly both to our Company\r\nand to individual members of it, as witness his gift of the grace cup,\r\nand the legacies in his will to various members of the Company, with\r\nsome of whom, as Pen, Harman, Ayliff, etc., he was on as intimate terms\r\nas a king could be with a subject; there would therefore be, we may be\r\nsure, but little difficulty in obtaining an Inspeximus.\r\n\r\nIn one of our Minute Books, Thomas Knot (Master 1555) has transcribed\r\nwhat purports to be a copy of Henry’s Inspeximus Charter with the date\r\n12{th} of May “in the xviij{th} yere of our Reigne” (_i.e._, 1526), and\r\nhe appends a certificate that he has compared and agreed it with the\r\noriginal! Now we possess the original at Barbers’ Hall and it is dated\r\n12{th} March 3{rd} Henry VIII (_i.e._, 1512), and it would indeed be a\r\nstrange thing for Henry VIII in 1526 to recite and confirm Henry VII’s\r\nCharter, when he had already done so in 1512. Moreover I have searched\r\nthe Patent Rolls and whilst there is no record in 1526, there is the\r\nentry of the 1512 Charter, and further to fix the date, both Philip\r\nand Mary, and Elizabeth in their Inspeximus Charters recite the 1512\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to enter into this detail, as the date of the\r\nCharter is important when we come to consider Holbein’s picture; and as\r\nmy friend Mr. D’Arcy Power has (p. 338) quoted this pretended Charter\r\nnot having seen the real one, he, very naturally trusting old Thomas\r\nKnot’s statement, has fallen into the pit dug some three hundred years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe following is the Text of the Charter, and it will not be necessary\r\nto append a translation, as it follows much on the same lines as that\r\nof Henry VII:--\r\n\r\n  HENRICUS dei gracia Rex Anglie et Francie et Dominus Hibernie OMNIBUS\r\n  ad quos presentes Irẽ pˀvenerunt saltmˀ INSPEXIMUS litteras patentes\r\n  domini H. nuper Rˀgis Anglie septum patris nostri precarissimi de\r\n  confirmacione factas in hec verba HENRICUS dei gracia . . . . . .\r\n  Teste me ip̃o apud Westmonasterium quinto die Decembrˀ Anno regni\r\n  nr̃i quinto decimo.

The original (with More’s autograph) is at the Hall, and after\r\nreciting the Act of 20th Henry VII, ordains the following oaths and\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\n  The oath of a freeman.\r\n  The oath of the Masters and Governors with directions as to searches.\r\n  Ordinance as to attending on summons.\r\n      \"      \"    quarterage.\r\n      \"      \"    presentation of apprentices.\r\n      \"      \"    number of servants to be kept by freemen and\r\n                    liverymen.\r\n      \"      \"    wages of servants.\r\n      \"      \"    enticing away of servants.\r\n      \"      \"    opening shop.\r\n      \"      \"    teaching the mystery to any but apprentices.\r\n      \"      \"    sueing brother freemen at common law.\r\n      \"      \"    “opprobrios condicions or dishonest wordes.”\r\n      \"      \"    refusal to come on the Livery, and admission into\r\n                    the Livery.\r\n      \"      \"    Sunday trading.\r\n      \"      \"    presenting patients in danger of death.\r\n      \"      \"    reading Lectures concerning Surgery.\r\n      \"      \"    supplanting another of his patient.\r\n      \"      \"    the Dinners.\r\n      \"      \"    excess of words in debate.\r\n      \"      \"    departing from the Common assembly.\r\n      \"      \"    seniority.\r\n      \"      \"    Barbers setting up shop.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More’s Ordinances, as above, will be found in full in the\r\nAppendix B, the transcript being made from the original.[76]\r\n\r\n[76] The copy of these Ordinances given by Mr. D’Arcy Power (p. 339)\r\nis taken from one made by our old friend Thomas Knot, and is not\r\nliterally, though it is substantially, accurate.\r\n\r\n1540. This year is one of the most memorable in the annals of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, as it witnessed the union of the unincorporated\r\nGuild of Surgeons, with their more accredited fellow-craftsmen, the\r\nincorporated Company of Barbers. It has been suggested by more than\r\none writer that such an union is shrouded in mystery, difficult of\r\nexplanation, and that in those days, with science advancing (slowly,\r\nit is true), it might have been expected that we should read of a\r\ndivorcement, rather than a combination of two crafts, which then, as\r\nnow, were dissimilar both in their operations, and in the training and\r\nintelligence necessary for their practice.\r\n\r\nBut it is essential to bear in mind that though the Charter of\r\nEdward IV was ostensibly to the Barbers, it really was granted to a\r\nfraternity, which to a great extent practised as Barber-Surgeons, some\r\nof whom were Surgeons pure and simple, others combined both branches,\r\nwhile others still carried on the more humble craft of Shavers and\r\nHair-Dressers; those of the Company who practised Surgery did no doubt\r\nconsider it a reproach to be dubbed “Barbers,” and for distinction sake\r\ncalled themselves and were well known as “Barber-Surgeons,” indeed they\r\nhad so far established this title to themselves and to their Company,\r\nas to get it recognised and so named in the Inspeximus Charter of Henry\r\nVII (less than forty years after their original Charter as “Barbers”\r\nhad been granted to them). This is to a great extent confirmed by the\r\nwords of the Act now about to be referred to, which distinctly says\r\nthat there was then a Company of “Surgeons occupyinge and exercisynge\r\nthe sayde scyence and faculty of surgery . . . . . . commonly called\r\nthe Barbours of London.”\r\n\r\nThe Union therefore was not a joining of Barbers with Surgeons (THAT\r\nhad existed from the earliest times), but was the consolidation\r\nof the “Guild of Surgeons” with another body of Surgeons who were\r\nincorporated, and practised under the name of “Barbers” in conjunction\r\nwith actual working Barbers; and, as the Act provided what the Surgeons\r\nshould and should not do, and the like as to actual Barbers, limiting\r\ntheir operations also, most if not all difficulty and apparent\r\nincongruity in the union seems to vanish.\r\n\r\nThe Act (32 Hen. VIII, cap. 42) which will well repay perusal, settled\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons in their corporate capacity for many a long year;\r\nunder it the old rival society disappeared, it being declared that the\r\ntwo Companies should be united, so that by their assembling together,\r\nthe science of Surgery might be fostered and improved; whereupon it\r\nwas enacted that they should be incorporated under the style of “THE\r\nMAISTERS OR GOVERNOURS OF THE MYSTERY AND COMMINALTE OF BARBOURS AND\r\nSURGEONS OF LONDON.” The property of the old Company of Barbers was\r\nhanded over to the new Corporation (the Guild of Surgeons are not said\r\nto have had any property to bring into the new concern). The usual\r\ngrant of a common seal, of power to plead and to be impleaded, to hold\r\nlands, etc., will be seen at large in the Act. The Surgeons of the\r\nCompany were to be exempt from bearing armour or being put into watches\r\nand inquests. The dead bodies of four malefactors were assigned to\r\nthe Company yearly for dissections. And, inasmuch as various persons\r\nexercising the faculty of Surgery used to take into their houses\r\nfor cure, people afflicted with the pestilence and other contagious\r\ndiseases and “do use or exercise barbari, as washynge or shavyng and\r\nother feates thereunto belonging,”[77] the same was declared “veraie\r\nperillous,” and it was enacted that no one using the faculty of Surgery\r\nshould practise Barbery, and that no Barber should practise any point\r\nin Surgery, the drawing of teeth only excepted. The Surgeons were to\r\nexhibit a sign in front of their houses, and no Barber was to exercise\r\nhis calling unless free of the Company. Four Masters were to rule the\r\nCompany, whereof two were to be Barbers and two Surgeons. A penalty was\r\nnamed for offenders against the articles, all were to pay scot and lot,\r\nand private persons might keep their own Barber or Surgeon, without\r\ninterference by the Company.\r\n\r\n[77] Here we have the common practice of the joint craftsman, the\r\n“Barber-Surgeon,” clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Act was passed on the 24th July, 1540, and will be found in\r\nAppendix C. being taken from the original Black-letter copy in the\r\nAuthor’s possession.\r\n\r\nWe now refer to the Company’s chief treasure, the Holbein picture, and\r\nare at once met with a difficulty; does it represent the _granting\r\nof a Charter_ to the Company? if so, the year was 1512; or does\r\nit illustrate the union of the Barbers and Surgeons by _Act of\r\nParliament_? if so, the year was 1540.\r\n\r\nThe picture exhibits a Charter with the Great Seal pendant, and has\r\nalways been popularly known and described as the “granting of the\r\nCharter to the Barber-Surgeons.” On the other hand, however, the King\r\nwas but 21 years of age in 1512 and 49 years in 1540, which latter\r\nage accords with the picture; moreover, Vicary, Ayleff, Harman, and\r\nthe others represented, were members of the Court in the latter year,\r\nbut not in 1512. These considerations are sufficient to demolish the\r\n“Charter” theory, and point to the hypothesis that it is the Union of\r\nthe Barbers’ Company with the Guild of Surgeons, accomplished by Act\r\nof Parliament in 1540, which is _commemorated_, but then we must admit\r\na licence on the part of Holbein (which deceived no one at the time),\r\nwhen he indulged his artist’s fancy by putting into the King’s hand\r\na Charter with seal pendant, instead of an Act of Parliament, which\r\nlatter would not indeed have been the King’s function to hand to the\r\nCompany, and would probably, if represented, have been depicted as a\r\nmere roll, and not therefore so artistic or effective as a Charter with\r\na Seal in the King’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe Act received the Royal Assent 25th July, 1540; this would be\r\ntowards the close of the year of John Pen’s mastership. Vicary, who\r\nis receiving the Instrument, was Master from September, 1541, to\r\nSeptember, 1542; there is every probability that the painting was\r\nexecuted during his year of office, and that is why Holbein paid him\r\nthe compliment of putting him in the chief position in the painting,\r\nwhich after all was intended, not as a strictly historical, but rather\r\nas a commemorative picture.\r\n\r\nThe picture is 10 feet 2 inches long by 5 feet 11 inches high, painted\r\non oak panel and contains nineteen figures; it represents a room in\r\nthe palace (said to have been Bridewell), which is hung with beautiful\r\ntapestry and appears to have been gilded; the King is seated on a\r\nthrone, his age apparently about fifty, the complexion florid, the\r\nhair sandy, the eyes small but animated and restless; the expression\r\non the countenance is impatience, and he seems thrusting the document\r\nhastily into the hand of Thomas Vicary, who receives it kneeling, on\r\nhis left; the face altogether might be pronounced handsome, were it\r\nnot for the low forehead and contracted eyebrows; he has on his left\r\nthumb a signet ring, and other rings on the first and fourth fingers\r\nof his right hand with which he holds a sword of state resting on his\r\nknee; on his head is a jewelled crown; on his left leg the garter, and\r\nround his neck the collar of the Order; the mantle is short and of\r\ncrimson velvet; all these ornaments are most beautifully executed and\r\nare as fine as miniature painting; every hair of his head is distinct,\r\nand the texture of his robe is finely given; his impatience seems to\r\nhave warmed him, and the rising colour flushing over his face is most\r\nadmirably painted. On the King’s right are three grave and closely\r\nshaved personages on their knees. The first is Dr. John Chambre, one\r\nof the Royal Physicians, he is represented in a skull cap and furred\r\ngown, the sleeves very large and in which his hands are enwrapped; from\r\nthe expression of his countenance it would seem that he was anything\r\nbut pleased with the provisions of the Act, as the face has a sullen\r\nand discontented look; next to him is the celebrated Dr. William Butts,\r\nalso one of Henry’s Physicians, and behind him is Thomas Alsop, the\r\nRoyal Apothecary, his hair is long and lank, and features coarse and\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the King’s left are fifteen members of the Court on their knees,\r\nand in livery gowns, evidently specially sumptuous for the occasion,\r\nbeing of brocaded or damask silk, trimmed with fur, and each man wears\r\na livery hood of red and black upon his shoulder. The first of these\r\nis Thomas Vicary, Serjeant-Surgeon, who wears a gold chain; next comes\r\nSir John Ayleff, Surgeon to the King, also with a gold chain and a ring\r\non his finger, the next is Nicholas Simpson, King’s Barber, who, like\r\nVicary and Ayleff, wears a skull cap, all the others have their heads\r\nbare. Then comes Edmund Harman, King’s Barber, and one of the Witnesses\r\nto Henry’s Will, he wears a gold chain; next him is James Monforde,\r\nKing’s Surgeon, then John Pen, the King’s Barber, and Nicholas Alcocke;\r\nthe expression on the countenances of all these men is grave and\r\nsolemn; the next, Richard Ferris, who has a somewhat merrier face, and\r\nwas also King’s Surgeon, completes the front row. The moustaches and\r\nbeards of the whole, including the King, would appear as if they had\r\nhad great care and attention bestowed upon them. Of the remaining seven\r\nfigures in the back row, the names of but two have been preserved,\r\nviz., Christopher Salmond and William Tilley.\r\n\r\nThis picture of Holbein’s is not surpassed, if indeed it is equalled,\r\nby any other of that master, every part is most elaborately and\r\ndelicately finished; the position of none of the figures is\r\nconstrained, and there is no attempt at theatrical effect, yet every\r\nperson represented is in action, the colouring is chaste, and kept\r\ndown, nor is there any of that hardness and stiffness often observed\r\nin Holbein’s pictures. Its reputation has been truly said to be\r\nworld-wide, whilst it has been eulogistically described by some one to\r\nbe “as glowing as a Titian, and minutely faithful as a Gerard Dow.”[78]\r\n\r\n[78] Part of the above description has been adapted from an anonymous\r\nparagraph, which I found interleaved in Allen’s History of London, at\r\nthe Guildhall Library.\r\n\r\nThe names of the persons represented have been somewhat rudely affixed\r\nto their effigies, probably a few years after the picture was painted,\r\nand whilst we cannot but deplore the disfigurement, it is more than\r\ncompensated for, as the means of identification of so many of our\r\nillustrious predecessors. The tablet, with inscription, has been said\r\nto be of later date than Holbein’s work, and to have been painted over\r\na window, through which was once seen the old church of St. Bride;\r\nthis, however, is most improbable, as it is personally dedicatory to\r\nHenry. The inscription is as follows:--\r\n\r\n      HENRICO OCTAVO OPT MAX: REGI ANGLIÆ FRANCIÆ\r\n      ET HIBERNIÆ FIDEI DEFENSORI AC ANGLICANÆ HIBERNICÆQ\r\n      ECCLESIÆ PROXIME A CHRISTO SVPREMO CAPITI SOCIETAS\r\n      CHIRVRGORVM COMMVNIBVS VOTIS HÆC CONSECRAT.\r\n\r\n      TRISTIOR ANGLORVM PESTIS VIOLAVERAT ORBEM\r\n        INFESTANS ANIMOS CORPORIBVSQVE SEDENS\r\n      HANC DEVS INSIGNEM CLADEM MISERATVS AB ALTO\r\n        TE MEDICI MVNVS JVSSIT OBIRE BONI\r\n      LVMEN EVANGELII FVLVIS CIRCVMVOLAT ALIS\r\n        PHARMACON AD FECTIS MENTIBVS ILLVD ERIT\r\n      CONSILIOQ TVO CELEBRANT MONVMENTA GALENI\r\n        ET CELERI MORBVS PELLITVR OMNIS OPE\r\n      NOS IGITVR SVPPLEX MEDICORVM TVRBA TVORVM\r\n        HANC TIBI SACRAMVS RELIGIONE DOMVM\r\n      MVNERIS ET MEMORES QVO NOS HENRICE BEASTI\r\n        IMPERIO OPTAMVS MAXIMA QVE QVE TVO.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n  To Henry the Eighth, the best and greatest King of England, France,\r\n  and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and next to Christ, supreme\r\n  head of the Church of England and Ireland, the Company of Surgeons\r\n  dedicate these, with their united prayers.\r\n\r\n    A grievous plague had ravaged the region of England,\r\n      Afflicting man’s spirits and penetrating his frame;\r\n    God, pitying from on high this remarkable scourge\r\n      Commanded thee to perform the office of a good physician.\r\n\r\n    The light of the gospel flies around on glowing wings,\r\n      This will be the balm to enfeebled minds:\r\n    Whilst the disciples of Galen meet to raise a monument to thee,\r\n      And all disease is swiftly dispelled by thy power.\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, a suppliant band of thy Physicians,\r\n      Solemnly dedicate this house to thee,\r\n    And mindful of the favour with which thou, O Henry, hast blessed us,\r\n      Invoke the greatest blessings on thy rule.\r\n\r\nThe following fragmentary notices of the persons represented in the\r\npicture, will be found of some interest.\r\n\r\nThe first figure to the left is Thomas Alsop; he was the King’s\r\nApothecary, and Henry VIII, by his will, left him 100 marks.\r\n\r\nNext to him is Dr. William Butts, one of the King’s physicians,\r\never famous for his memorable interference with the King on behalf\r\nof Archbishop Cranmer in 1544, when the Roman Catholic party in the\r\nCouncil endeavoured to procure Cranmer’s committal to the Tower. A\r\nfull account of this incident will be found in Strype’s Memorials of\r\nCranmer (Oxford Ed., 1812, pp. 177-181), and Shakespeare in his play of\r\nHenry VIII (act v., sc. 2) has also graphically described it. Cranmer’s\r\nSecretary, aware of Butts’ great influence with the King, sent for the\r\nDoctor, and acquainted him with the slight which had been put upon the\r\nArchbishop by keeping him standing in the ante-room of the Council\r\nChamber among lacqueys and servingmen, upon which Butts immediately\r\nrepaired to the King, and said:--\r\n\r\n      “I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight,\r\n      The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury:\r\n      Who holds his State at door, ’mongst pursuivants,\r\n      Pages and foot boys.”\r\n\r\nwhereupon Henry replies,--\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ’tis he indeed!\r\n      Is this the honour they do one another?\r\n      ’Tis well there’s one above them. Yet, I had thought\r\n      They had parted so much honesty among ‘em\r\n      (At least good manners) as not thus to suffer\r\n      A man of his place and so near our favour,\r\n      To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,\r\n      And at the door too, like a post with packets,\r\n      By Holy Mary! Butts, there’s knavery.\r\n      Let them alone, and drawn the curtain close:\r\n      We shall hear more anon.”\r\n\r\nHenry spoke his mind so freely to the Council, that they one and all\r\nshook hands with the Archbishop, and, as Strype says, “Never more durst\r\nany man spurn him during King Henry’s life.”\r\n\r\nDr. Butts must have had the best practice of any man of his time; there\r\nare several references to him among the State papers at the Record\r\nOffice, of which the following are a few examples, and indicate that\r\nhis patients were the aristocracy of the day.\r\n\r\n  25th May, 1524. Among the funeral expenses of Sir Thomas Lovell,\r\n  K.G., is this item:--“To John Hewson, riding to Cambridge, to fetch\r\n  Dr. Buttes when my master was sick, 4_s._ 8_d._”\r\n\r\n  28th April, 1525. The Duke of Norfolk, writing to Cardinal Wolsey,\r\n  says that last night at 7 o’clock the Lord Marney was “drawyng the\r\n  draghts of deth, and Mr. Butts determyned he shuld not lyve after 5\r\n  owrys” (hours).\r\n\r\n  14th October, 1525. A warrant was signed by Wolsey, directed to Sir\r\n  Andrew Windsor, for delivery to Dr. Butts, who had been appointed\r\n  physician to my lady Princess, of a livery in blue and green, in\r\n  damask for himself, and in cloth for his two servants.\r\n\r\n  17th May, 1528. In a letter from the Duke of Norfolk to Wolsey, the\r\n  Duke says that Mr. Butts had come to him from the King, without whose\r\n  aid he thought that he should not have recovered from his sickness.\r\n\r\n  23rd June, 1528. In a letter from Brian Tuke (to Cardinal Wolsey) he\r\n  speaks of an infection which had been much about of late, and how the\r\n  King told him that Mistress Ann Boleyn and my lord Rochford both have\r\n  had it; what jeopardy they have been in, by the turning in of the\r\n  sweat before the time; of the endeavour of Mr. Buttes who hath been\r\n  with them in his return; and finally of their perfect recovery.\r\n\r\n  19th January, 1530. A letter from De Augustinis, written from the\r\n  palace at Esher, to Cromwell, desires that Dr. Butts or Dr. Walter\r\n  Cromer may be sent to the Cardinal and requesting that Balthazar the\r\n  physician, may be spoken to, to obtain some leeches; no time was\r\n  to be lost and the doctors were to bring with them some vomitive\r\n  electuary.\r\n\r\nDr. Butts was a personal friend of Henry’s, who, in 1537, granted him\r\nthe manor and advowson of Thornage, in Norfolk. He died 17th November,\r\n1545, and lies buried in Fulham Church, where there is (or was) a\r\nmonument to his memory.\r\n\r\nNext to Butts, and immediately to the King’s right, is Dr. John\r\nChambre; he was physician to and a great favorite of Henry’s, holding\r\nseveral clerical preferments as well. He was a Fellow and Warden of\r\nMerton College, Oxon, where he was admitted Doctor of Physic, 29th\r\nOctober, 1531. In the list of persons to whom Wolsey, in 1526, assigned\r\nlodgings at the King’s house, when they should repair thither, occurs\r\nthe name of Dr. Chambre. There is also a catalogue of the King’s new\r\nyear’s gifts, in 1528, by which it appears that the Doctor had a piece\r\nof plate weighing 24-3/8 ozs., at the same time the Cardinal’s gift was\r\n40-1/4 ozs., and that of the Archbishop 31 ozs.\r\n\r\nIn Brian Tuke’s letter (23rd June, 1528), before referred to, he tells\r\nWolsey that when he called on the King with his letters, he found him\r\nin “secret communication with his physician, Mr. Chambre, in a tower,\r\nwhere he sometimes sups apart.”\r\n\r\nDr. Chambre was Dean of St. Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster, Canon of\r\nWindsor, Archdeacon of Bedford, Prebendary of Comb and Harnham in\r\nSalisbury Cathedral, Treasurer of Wells Cathedral, and beneficed in\r\nSomersetshire and Yorkshire. Truly the lines had fallen unto him in\r\npleasant places!\r\n\r\nHe was one of the physicians in attendance on Queen Jane, at the birth\r\nof Edward VI, and in a letter written by him to the Privy Council,\r\nconcerning the Queen’s critical state, he signs himself “priest.”\r\nHe was also in attendance on Anne Boleyn, in her confinement with\r\nElizabeth. His name is mentioned with that of Linacre and three others,\r\nin the Charter to the College of Physicians, in 1518.\r\n\r\nSir William Compton, K.G., in 1522, nominated Dr. Chambre one of his\r\nexecutors, in conjunction with the Bishop of Exeter, and Sir Henry\r\nMarney, Lord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nDr. Chambre built a “very curious cloyster,” in St. Stephen’s Chapel,\r\nwhich cost him 11,000 marks, and he gave the canons of that chapel some\r\nlands. He died in 1549.\r\n\r\nOn the King’s left is, first, Thomas Vicary (sometimes Vicars and\r\nVyccary), Master of the Barbers in 1530, and of the Barber-Surgeons\r\nin 1541, 1546, 1548 and 1557. He was a man of great eminence in his\r\nprofession, having been Surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and\r\nSerjeant-Surgeon to Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth. He was\r\nthe author of “The Profitable Treatise of Anatomy” in “The Englishman’s\r\nTreasure, with the true Anatomie of Man’s Body.” An account of Vicary\r\nwill be found in D’Arcy Power, pp. 102, etc., and several particulars\r\nrelating to his connection with St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, are\r\nrecorded in a paper by Dr. Norman Moore (Hospital Reports, vol. xviii,\r\npp. 333-358); see also Dr. Furnivall’s exhaustive account (Early\r\nEnglish Text Society).\r\n\r\nNext comes Sir John Ayleff (Aylif, Aylyff, etc.). He was Master of the\r\nBarbers in 1538, and Surgeon to the King, with whom he was doubtless on\r\nterms of friendship, as Henry bequeathed him 100 marks. Ayleff treated\r\nHenry for fistula and cured him, at Brinkworth in Wilts, for which\r\nthe King bestowed upon him a great estate there in gratification. He\r\nsubsequently became a Merchant of Blackwell Hall, Sheriff of London in\r\n1548, and Alderman of Bridge Without in 1550.\r\n\r\n17th July, 1550. In the Repertories of the Court of Aldermen is a\r\nRecord that the Court of the Barber-Surgeons gave their assent to the\r\nTranslation of Sir John from theirs to the Grocers’ Company, of which\r\nCompany he was crowned Upper Warden 9th June, 1556.\r\n\r\nSir John Ayleff was buried 20th October, 1556, in the Church of St.\r\nMichael Bassishaw, where there was formerly a marble tomb with this\r\ninscription thereon--\r\n\r\n    In Chirurgery brought up in youth,\r\n    A Knight here lyeth dead;\r\n    A Knight and eke a Surgeon such\r\n    As England seld hath bred.\r\n    For which so soveraigne Gift of God\r\n    Wherein he did excell,\r\n    King Henry VIII call’d him to Court,\r\n    Who lov’d him dearly well.\r\n    God gave the Gift, the King gave Goods,\r\n    The Gift of God t’enhance;\r\n    Where God and such a Prince do joyne,\r\n    Such Man hath happy Chance.\r\n    King Edward for his service sake,\r\n    Bade him rise up a Knight,\r\n    A name of Praise and ever since\r\n    He, Sir John Ailiffe hight,\r\n    Right Worshipful, in name and charge\r\n    In London lived he than,\r\n    In Blackwell Hall the merchant chiefe\r\n    First Sheriffe, then Alderman.\r\n    The Hospitals bewaile his death\r\n    The Orphan children mone,\r\n    The chiefe Erector being dead\r\n    And Benefactor gone.\r\n    Dame Isabel who lived with him,\r\n    His faithful Wife and Mate,\r\n    With him (as dearest after death)\r\n    Doth not her Knight forsake\r\n    The Knight the 24[79] of October.\r\n    Yeelded up his breath,\r\n    And she soon after followed\r\n    To live with him in death.\r\n\r\n    [79] Probably a mistake for 14th.\r\n\r\n  19 April, 1558. My lady Aylyff gave a fyne table cloth of damaske\r\n  worcke to sr̃ve for the uppermost table in the hawle the w{ch} of her\r\n  jentyllness she gave frely unto this hawle.\r\n\r\nJohn Ayleff (son of the Knight) was admitted to the freedom of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, 3rd June, 1552.\r\n\r\nNext to Sir John Ayleff, is Nicholas Simpson, concerning whom nothing\r\nis known to me, but that he was “King’s Barber,” and Master of the\r\nBarbers in 1537.\r\n\r\nEdmund Harman, “King’s Barber,” follows next; he was admitted to the\r\nfreedom in 1530, and served Master in 1540. Henry VIII bequeathed him\r\n200 marks, and he was one of the attesting witnesses to the King’s\r\nwill. There are several references to him among the State Papers and\r\nHousehold Ordinances. His dignified bearing and expression in the\r\npicture are very striking.\r\n\r\nJames Monforde (or Mumford), “King’s Surgeon,” is next; he was Upper\r\nWarden in 1540 and again in 1543, but never served as Master. He gave\r\nthe Company their silver hammer, still used by the Masters in presiding\r\nat Courts.\r\n\r\nThen comes John Pen (Penn or Penne), “King’s Barber,” and Groom of\r\nthe Privy Chamber; he was admitted to the freedom in 1527 and was\r\nMaster 1539. He married Lucy, daughter and heiress of Edmond Chevall,\r\nof Coddicote, Herts, by whom he had a good estate and seven children\r\n(_vide_ Harl. Soc. Pub. xxii., 82 & 116).\r\n\r\nIn Liber Niger Domus Regis (Harl. MS. 642) among the orders made for\r\nthe regulation of the Household of Henry VIII was one, that none but\r\nfifteen persons whose names are specified should be allowed to enter\r\nthe Privy Chamber, and one of these is John Penne.\r\n\r\nThe following quaint regulation, concerning the King’s Barber, is to be\r\nfound in the same MS.--\r\n\r\n  Item. It is alsoe ordeyned that the Kingꝭ Barbor shalbe daylie by\r\n  the Kingꝭ upriseinge readdye and attendant in the Kingꝭ Privye\r\n  Chamber there haveinge in reddynesse his Water Basons Knyvesꝭ Combes\r\n  scissourꝭ and such other stuffe as to his Roome doth appertaine for\r\n  trymminge and dressinge of the Kingꝭ heade and bearde. And that the\r\n  sayd Barbour take a speciall regarde to the pure and cleane keepinge\r\n  of his owne p’son and apparrell useinge himselfe allwayes honestlye\r\n  in his conversationne withoute resortinge to the Companye of vile\r\n  personnes or of misguided woemen in avoydeinge such daunger as by\r\n  that meanes hee might doe unto the Kingꝭ most Royall person not\r\n  fayling thus to doe uppon payne of looseinge his Roome and farther\r\n  punnishement at the Kingꝭ pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn this MS. is also to be found an earlier order, of the time of Edward\r\nIV touching the King’s Barber, which is curious, as indicating that\r\nSaturday night was then (as still it is with many) “tub night” with the\r\nKing; and we may also infer from the expression “_if_ it please the\r\nKing to cleanse his head, legs or feet,” that it was _not_ a fixed rule\r\nfor him to do so _every_ Saturday night.\r\n\r\n  A BARBOUR for the Kingis most highe and drad p’son to be taken\r\n  in this Court, after that he standeth in degree gentleman yoman\r\n  or groome. It hath bin much accustomed to one or two well knowne\r\n  officers of the Ewrie in housold Daily of such as bene for the monthe\r\n  Sergeant or othir. Also we finde how this hath bene used amonge by a\r\n  weele betrusted yoman of chambre ffor lacke of cunning of these other\r\n  men. It is accustomed that a knight of the Chambre or elles squire of\r\n  the bodie or both be p’sent every time when the Kinge wolle shave.\r\n  This Barbour shall have every satterday night if it please the Kinge\r\n  to cleanse his head leggꝭ or feete and for his shaveing two lovis[80]\r\n  one pitcher wine. And the usher of chambre ought to testifie if this\r\n  be necessary dispensed or not.\r\n\r\n  [80] Loaves.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the portrait of Pen was greatly admired by Sir Robert\r\nPeel, who frequently came to the Hall to look at it, and who is\r\nreported to have offered the Company £2,000 for the head, if it might\r\nbe cut from the picture, he undertaking to make good the damage! He is\r\nalso alleged to have said at one of his visits, that he should like to\r\nsleep on the table at the Hall, so that the first thing he would see\r\non waking in the morning might be Pen’s head. Had Sir Robert known the\r\nlegend[81] of the _table_ he would perhaps have suggested a different\r\nbed. Henry VIII left, by his Will, 100 marks to Pen.\r\n\r\n[81] Said to have been part of the dissecting table!\r\n\r\nConcerning the next man, Nicholas Alcocke, nothing is known beyond\r\nthat he was Surgeon to Edward VI, and was admitted to the freedom in\r\n1523. He was doubtless a member of the Court, though he never served as\r\nWarden.\r\n\r\nThe last on the front row is Richard Ferris (or Ferrers), Master in\r\n1563 and Serjeant-Surgeon to Elizabeth. Like others of his brethren, he\r\nalso benefited under Henry’s will, to the extent of 100 marks, and was\r\none of the King’s Surgeons.\r\n\r\nIn the back row are seven figures, but of these the names of only two\r\nsurvive, viz., William Tylley, Upper Warden 1546, and Christopher Samon\r\n(Salmon, Sammond), admitted to the freedom in 1528, and Master in 1553.\r\nBy Domestic Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 5, p. 690, it appears that one\r\nChristopher Samon was living in Lombard Street in 1532: this might be\r\nthe same man.\r\n\r\n29 August, 1668. Dear old Samuel Pepys visited us this day, and thus\r\nrecords his intentions and opinion concerning the picture--\r\n\r\n  And at noon comes by appointment Harris to dine with me: and after\r\n  dinner he and I to Chyrurgeons Hall, where they are building it new,\r\n  very fine; and there to see their theatre, which stood all the fire,\r\n  and which was our business, their great picture of Holben’s, thinking\r\n  to have bought it by the help of Mr. Pierce,[82] for a little\r\n  money: I did think to give £200 for it, it being said to be worth\r\n  £1,000; but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to it, and is not a\r\n  pleasant, though a good picture.\r\n\r\n  [82] James Pierce (or Pearse) Surgeon to Charles II and to the Duke\r\n  of York. Master in 1675\r\n\r\nJames I seems to have entertained a high opinion of this picture, and\r\nborrowed it of us to be copied: his letter applying for it is preserved\r\nat the Hall, and is as follows.\r\n\r\n  JAMES R.\r\n\r\n  Trustie and welbeloved Wee greete you well. Where we are informed\r\n  of a Table of painting in yo{r} Hall wherein is the Picture of o{r}\r\n  Predecesso{r} of famous memorie K. Henry the 8{th}, together with\r\n  diverse of yo{r} Companie, w{ch} being both like him, and well done,\r\n  Wee are desirous to have copyed. Wherfore o{r} pleasure is that\r\n  you presently deliver it unto this bearer Our Welbeloved Servant\r\n  S{r} Lionell Cranfield Knight, One of Our Maisters of Requests,\r\n  whome Wee have commaunded to receave it of you and to see it w{th}\r\n  all expedition copied and redelivered safely; and so Wee bid you\r\n  farewell. Given at Our Court at Newmarket the 13{th} day of Januarie\r\n  1617.[83]\r\n\r\n  [83] _i.e._, 1617/8.\r\n\r\nThe Court of course agreed to lend the picture, though doubtless with\r\nsome misgivings; contrary however to the practice of the time when\r\nmoney was “lent” to the King, it found its way back to the Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, Charles I, a more suspicious borrower than his father, had it\r\nto Whitehall, but here again we fortunately had it returned.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Surgeons possess some Cartoons, from which, it has\r\nbeen said, this picture was painted; this is, however, very doubtful.\r\nSome particulars as to these Cartoons may be seen in Mr. D’Arcy Power’s\r\nbook, p. 96.\r\n\r\nIn 1734 the Company agreed with Mr. Bernard Baron for him to engrave\r\nthe picture for 150 guineas, and several details relating thereto are\r\nrecorded in the Minutes. It was published in 1736, and is a faithful\r\nreproduction, much sought after by collectors. Baron has however copied\r\nthe picture, exactly as he saw it on to the copperplate, so that when\r\nthe impressions were struck off, everything was reversed. His original\r\nstudy, a red crayon, beautifully executed, is preserved in the Court\r\nRoom, and the copperplate is still used, each Assistant on his election\r\nbeing presented with a copy of the engraving. The Company also possess\r\na rather rough proof before letters.\r\n\r\nThe print is dedicated to the Earl of Burlington, with a Latin\r\ninscription, of which the following is a translation.\r\n\r\n“To the Most Noble Lord Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington and Cork,\r\n&c., Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of the Garter. For the\r\nrestoration, with the greatest liberality, at his own costs, of the\r\nAnatomical Theatre built a hundred years before, with the greatest\r\nskill, by the very celebrated Architect Inigo Jones, and decayed by\r\nlapse of time. This painting of Holbein representing the granting of a\r\nCharter given with his own hand by Henry VIII, King of England, &c., to\r\nthe Society of Surgeons in London and preserved in their Hall, is by\r\nthe Society of Surgeons of London humbly dedicated.”\r\n\r\nThis inscription, written at a time when the relations between the\r\nBarbers and the Surgeons of the Company were becoming strained, was\r\nevidently drawn by a Surgeon, who coolly ignored the Barbers throughout.\r\n\r\nA very good pen and ink drawing of the picture was made by Austin\r\nTravers Young (aged 16) in 1883, and presented by him to the Company,\r\nfor which he received the thanks of the Court.\r\n\r\n1537. In “Chapter House Book” B. 1. (at the Record Office) is a list\r\nof the freemen of the several Companies of London at this date, which\r\ngives the names of 2,468 freemen in 39 Companies (an average of about\r\n63 to each). The Barbers outstripped in numbers all the others, having\r\na roll of 185 members; next to them came the Skinners with 151, then\r\nthe Haberdashers with 120, so on down to the Bowyers, who mustered\r\nbut 19. The premier Company, the Mercers, numbered but 55, whilst the\r\nancient Weavers had only 30 members.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of our freemen, the first twenty-six being\r\nmembers of the Court, and Nicholas Symson, Master that year.\r\n\r\n  Nicholas Symson.     | John Raven.           | Thomas Wilson.\r\n  Willm Kyrckby.       | Robert Hutton.        | John Smythe.\r\n  Thomas Vycars.[84]   | Henry Pemberton.      | Willm Hiller.\r\n  John Bankꝭ.           | Willm Shirborne.      | Richard Tholmod.[85]\r\n  John Potter.         | George Genne.         | John Awcetter.\r\n  Thomas Twyn.         | Thomas Johnson.       |\r\n  John Johnson.        | Robert Spegnall.[86]  | Richard Sermond.\r\n  John Holland.        | Richard Boll.[87]     | Hugh Lyncocke.\r\n  Willm Rewe.          | Nacholas Alcoke.      | John Bordman.\r\n  John Aylyff.         | Willm.

A few years previously the King had set the example of\r\nwearing his hair and beard short, and now the City seems to have\r\ndiscountenanced long beards, as I find the following in _Letter Book Q.\r\n87_. (10th July, 35 Henry viij.)\r\n\r\n  AN ACTE AGAYNST}\r\n  BEARDED MEN.   }\r\n\r\n  ITEM for dyvˀse & sundrye consyderac͠ons & causes movyng this Cor̃te\r\n  it is this daye orderyd & decreid & establyshed by the same that\r\n  from henseforward there shall no Cytezen or other iñhit{a}unte[93]\r\n  of this Cytie usyng or havyng a greate berde of more notable\r\n  pˀlyxitie[94] or length then other the seid Cytezens of this Cytie\r\n  do nowe use or have hertofore of late yeres usyd to were, either be\r\n  iñhited pˀmytted or suffred to Receyve or take eny orphanage into his\r\n  handes and custodye albeit that he wolde fynde nevˀ soe good suertyes\r\n  for the same nor yet be admytted from henseforward to this Co{r}te\r\n  for eny Recognito{ns} or suertye for eny suche orphange And yt is\r\n  also assentyd & agreid that no pˀson havynge eny such berde shalbe\r\n  admytted by redempc͠on into the lybt̃ies & fredome of this Cytie as\r\n  longe as he shall were eny such berde.\r\n\r\n  [93] Inhabitant.\r\n  [94] Prolixity.\r\n\r\n1544 and 1545. In _Repertory XI_ (at Guildhall) ff. 73{B.,} 176,\r\n187{B.,} 229{B.,} 232 and 234 are various records relating to the vexed\r\nquestion of the Barber-Surgeons going on inquests, bearing armour and\r\nserving as constables, from all which offices they claimed exemption\r\nunder their Charters and Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBy the earlier entry, it seems that the Wardens were warned to appear\r\nbefore the Court of Aldermen to shew cause why they refused to pass\r\nupon inquests, etc.; then came a petition from the Company praying\r\nto be discharged of all offices save the Inquest of Wardmote once a\r\nyear; this does not appear to have satisfied the Authorities, and the\r\nCompany were directed to draw up further Articles to be submitted\r\nto the Court of Aldermen. Great pressure was no doubt put upon the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, the result being that they abandoned most of the\r\nprivileges of exemption which they had claimed, and submitted a Bill\r\nof Articles, which was finally approved, and entered of record on fo.\r\n234. A copy of this lengthy document is at the Hall, and from it it\r\nappears that on the 22nd October, 1545, the Company appeared before\r\nthe Court of Aldermen as “humble Besechers” to be shorn of their\r\nprivileges, the ground of their petition being “That forasmoche as\r\nsome grudge and displeasure is lately sith the unyon and conjunction\r\nof their said ffelowshippes in to one entyre Company growen conteyned\r\nand taken against them and their said ffelowship, by dyverse of theire\r\nneighbours being citezeins of this citie, as they be, by reason that\r\nthey your said suppliauntꝭ” are discharged by their Charters and Act\r\nof Parliament from bearing offices, etc., “that other the Cittzeins\r\nof this citie are ellygible and lyable unto, ffor the whiche grudge\r\nand displeasure your besechers are not a little sorye. ffor the\r\nplayne declarac͠on thereof and for the eschewyng advoyding and utter\r\nextinguysshement of the said grudge and displeasure from hensforwarde,”\r\nthey are content that it shall be ordained that they shall go upon\r\nall Wardmote Inquests, but not upon any inquests between party and\r\nparty (_i.e._, sit as jurymen in civil actions); that all freemen\r\nof the Company not practising Surgery shall be contributory to all\r\nassessments, serve as Constables and keep watches in their turn as\r\nother citizens, but that all Surgeons shall be free from bearing\r\narmour, etc.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this compromise, entered in the City books, it seems\r\nin course of time to have been overlooked, and, as has been previously\r\nremarked, the exemption of _all_ freemen of the Company from juries,\r\netc., has been claimed and allowed down to quite recent days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE PAGE OF FIRST MINUTE BOOK, 1557.]\r\n\r\n1550. The first of our Court Minute Books which has been preserved,\r\ncommences in the 4{th} Edward VI, and bears this title,\r\n\r\n  ~Orders and Awardes~ made ordered and awarded within the tyme of\r\n  Maister George Geen Thomas Johnson Thomas Stocdall and Mathew Johnson\r\n  Maister and Wardeins of the Company and fellowship of BARBORS\r\n  SURGEONS of London for one hole yere begynnyng the xxvj{th} day of\r\n  Auguste in the fowerthe yere of the reigne of our Sovereigne Lorde\r\n  Kynge Edward the Syxte with thassent and consent of the Assistaunces\r\n  of the same Companye as hereafter ensuethe.\r\n\r\nFrom this and the succeeding Minute Books, the following extracts are\r\nprincipally taken as illustrative of the Company’s History from this\r\nperiod:\r\n\r\n1556. At the end of the first book is a very long memorandum written\r\nand signed by Thomas Knot, Master, to the effect that on the 26th\r\nMarch, 1556, he made humble suit to the Lord Mayor, Sir Will{m.}\r\nGarrett and the Aldermen, in the name of the Company, for the exemption\r\nof the Company from finding or setting forth any soldiers or men of war\r\nat any time thereafter, when it might be that the Citizens of London\r\nshould be required to do so, either by sea or land, “fforasmoche as\r\nthe same Company are alwayes at every such tyme and tymes very sore\r\nburdened and chardged otherwise hereafter expressed, that is to saye,\r\nThey are comaunded and bounden to prepare and fynde so manye Surgeons\r\nand so many other men attendinge upon them at every tyme and tymes\r\nthat it shall fortune the King” to send out soldiers by sea or land,\r\nand “the same Company doe alwayes prepare fynde and send furthe for\r\nevery one houndreth of suche Souldyers one Surgeon and a man attending\r\nupon him.” Upon which representations the Lord Mayor and Aldermen\r\nwere pleased to grant to the Company, that on future occasions when\r\nthe like requisitions might “fortune to be layed or appointed to\r\nor upon theym, that then they in every suche case upon their gentle\r\nsuyte and request made unto the Lorde Mayor and courte of Aldermen for\r\nthe tyme beinge for and concernynge their sayd dischardge for and in\r\nconsyderac͠on of the causes above remembered, shalbe as gentelye and\r\ncharytably holpen eased and releaved in that behalf as the wayte and\r\nymportaunce of the burden that the Cytie at every suche tyme shalbe\r\nchardged w{th} all will reasonablye permytt and suffer.”\r\n\r\nThe memorandum then proceeds to state that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen\r\nadvised the Master to cause a remembrance of the above (being only a\r\npromise by word of mouth) to be entered and recorded in the Book of\r\nOrdinances of the Company, which was done.\r\n\r\n1555. In Henry Machyn’s Diary for this year, is the following reference\r\nto a Romish procession, winding up with a dinner at Barbers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n  The xxvij day of May was the Clarkes prossessyon from Yerdhall[95]\r\n  college, and ther was a goodly masse to be hard, and evere clarke\r\n  havyng a cope and garland, with C.[96] stremers borne, and the\r\n  whettes[97] a playng round Chepe, and so to Ledynhall unto Sant\r\n  Albro[98] chyrche, and ther thay putt off ther gayre, and ther was\r\n  the blessyd sacrament borne with torche-lyght abowt, and from thens\r\n  unto the Barbur-hall to dener.\r\n\r\n  [95] Guildhall.\r\n  [96] A hundred.\r\n  [97] Waits.\r\n  [98] St. Ethelburga.\r\n\r\nCharter from Philip and Mary, which is still in our possession, and has\r\na most beautifully executed title, the initial letter representing the\r\nKing and Queen seated on the throne, and the border containing various\r\nheraldic badges; the seal unfortunately is damaged.\r\n\r\n  PHILIPPUS ET MARIA, Dei gracia Rex et Regina Anglie hispaniarum\r\n  ffrancie utriusque Sicilie Jerusalem & hiᵬine fidei defensores\r\n  Archiduces Austrie Duces Burgundie Mediolani & brabantie Countes\r\n  haspurgi fflandrˀ & Tirolis.\r\n\r\n  ~Omnibus~ ad quos presentes lr̃e pervñint salt̃m.\r\n\r\n  INSPEXIMUS quasdam lrãs patentes domini H. quondam Regis Anglie\r\n  septum[99] fc̃as in hec verba, HENRICUS dei grã, &c. . . . . . . . .\r\n  Teste me ip̃o apud Westmonastiũm duodecimo die marcii Anno regni nr̃i\r\n  tcĩo.

Elizabeth inaugurated the first State Lottery in England, as a\r\nmeans of providing money, and a very peremptory mandate was directed\r\nby the Lord Mayor to the various City Companies, commanding them to\r\nadventure therein.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1568. The Barber-Surgeons put in 40{s.} for the “use,\r\nprofet and benefyt of the hall,” but did not draw a prize, and indeed\r\nnone of the Companies reaped any advantage by the speculation, the\r\nLottery being simply a trap into which they were ordered to walk.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this Lottery was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A verie rich Lotterie Generall without any Blancks contayning a\r\n  great No. of good prices, as well of redy money, as of Plate &\r\n  certaine sorts of marchaundizes having been valued & prised by the\r\n  commaundement of the Queenes most excellent Majestie by men expert\r\n  & skilfull and the same Lotterie is erected by hir majesties order,\r\n  to the entent that such Commoditie as may chaunce to arise thereof,\r\n  after the charges borne, may be converted towards the reparation of\r\n  the Havens and strength of the Realme, & towardes such other publique\r\n  good workes. The No. of lots shall be foure hundreth thousand, and no\r\n  more: and every lot shall be the summe of tenne shillings sterling\r\n  onely, and no more.\r\n\r\nStow says that this Lottery was commenced to be drawn on the 11th\r\nJanuary, 1569, at the West Door of St. Paul’s, and continued drawing\r\nday and night until the 6th May following.\r\n\r\nIt was a common practice of the Companies to put in their money under\r\nmottoes, and some curious ones are recorded, many being composed with a\r\nquaint sarcasm on the probability of prizes being obtained.\r\n\r\nHerbert (Hist. of the Twelve Livery Companies) gives some interesting\r\nparticulars of the State Lotteries, and quotes a motto used by the\r\nMerchant Taylors which pretty clearly indicates their opinion of the\r\nbusiness;\r\n\r\n      One byrde in the hande is worth two in the wood,\r\n      If we get the great lot, it will do us good.\r\n\r\nSome of the prizes were ridiculously small, _e.g._, 1_s._ 2_d._, 2_s._\r\n1_d._, etc., and great dissatisfaction was expressed at the principal\r\nprizes remaining unpaid to the winners.\r\n\r\n1573. The Company received a precept from the Lord Mayor for a “loan”\r\nof money to make provision of wheat for the City, and the same was by\r\nthe Court ordered to be complied with. This “corn custom” is very fully\r\ntreated of by Herbert, and was virtually a tax upon the companies, who\r\nwere each rated and compelled to find a certain proportion of corn to\r\nbe stored by the City, and sold at such times as when, there being a\r\nscarcity, the markets would otherwise rise, were it not for the immense\r\nstock kept by the City. This custom survived for many years under\r\ncertain modifications; as we shall see hereafter, our Company built a\r\ngranary in 1633, and stored their own corn.\r\n\r\nThe precept above referred to was as follows--\r\n\r\n  Forasmuche as all comon polecye requyreth the prevenc͠on of\r\n  extremities, and consideringe as you knowe the urgent and present\r\n  necessitie, and the lacke of provision of wheate and other grayne for\r\n  furniture of this so great and populous citie, of the want whereof\r\n  the queenes ma{tie} and her most honorable coñsell are not ignorant;\r\n  but havinge spˀcial regard to the same, are not a lytle offended\r\n  and displeased, with some grefe that there bene no better pˀvision\r\n  heretofore made, and that presentlie the cittie shoulde be no better\r\n  stored, by reson wherof the prices of corne and grayne is now muche\r\n  dearer in this cittie than in any other parte of this realme, have\r\n  not only at sundrye times and gentle meanes, but also w{th} some\r\n  terror, as welle in the Starre-chamber as in other places afore the\r\n  counsell, given us admonicion that the same her ma{ties} cittie and\r\n  chamber may not be unfurnished for lacke of good pˀvision. And we,\r\n  as our duties is, havinge great care and especial consideracion of\r\n  the same, and pˀcevynge by order of the harvest past, and the unkynd\r\n  season of the yeare, sith that the prices of corne is verry likely\r\n  to encrease and be advanced to a greater and higher price than yet\r\n  is, have thought good and verrye necessarye for the avoyding of\r\n  greater inconvenyences, to make immediate pˀvision of a great masse\r\n  and quantity of wheate and other grayne, as well w{th}in the realme\r\n  as beyond the seas for the provision aforesaid, w{ch} cannot be done\r\n  w{th}out a great some of money presentlie to be defrayed, w{ch} is\r\n  not to be levyed but by the good assestens of you and others, good\r\n  coustomers and cittezens of this cittie; have therefore assessed\r\n  your Company of Barber Surgeons at the some of[114]        which is\r\n  agreed upon by acte of coˀen counsell, w{ch} some of        we do\r\n  not only require you, but also streaghtle charge and comande you,\r\n  immediatelie upon the recept hereof, calling your companye together\r\n  in your comon hall, you do forthw{th} tax, levy, and gather of the\r\n  welthiest and most able persones of the same the sum aforesaid,\r\n  in such wise that you fayle not to pay the same, and evrie pˀcell\r\n  thereof, to the hands of George Helton, of the cittie of London,\r\n  w{th} all expedicion, and w{th}out repayment thereof to you. Fayle\r\n  not hereof, as you tender the mytigac͠on of our sovereigne ladye the\r\n  queens majesties displeasure already conceived, and do tender the\r\n  com̃on weale of this cittie, together w{th} your private condytte,\r\n  and as you will answer for the contrarye.\r\n\r\n  [114] The amount is left blank.\r\n\r\nThe next entry would seem to indicate some contemplated State\r\ninterference with the Company’s property, and the answer was probably\r\nnot in exact accordance with the truth, for on the 28 May, 1576, a\r\nprecept in the Queen’s name, having been received, calling upon the\r\nMaster and Wardens to return to the Guildhall an account of the revenue\r\nof their lands, and of their goods, “the answere was that the true\r\nrevenewe of the landes was xx{ti} markes whereof the most pˀte went\r\nforthe and is disbursed in peñcons, and that we had no goods.”\r\n\r\n1578. A precept was received as follows,\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  TO THE WARDENS }     BY THE MAIOR.\r\n  OF THE COMPANIE}\r\n     OF BARBOR   }\r\n     SURGINS.    }]\r\n\r\n  THYES shalbe to will and require yo{u} and in her maiesties name\r\n  streitlie to charge and comaunde yo{u} that w{th} all convenient\r\n  spede yo{u} appointe and pˀvide the number of twelve hable and\r\n  sufficient pˀsons being Iournemen appnˀtices or others wc{h} are\r\n  fremen of this Cittie and inhabitinge w{th}in the same beinge of\r\n  agilitie and honest of behavio{r} betweene the age of xix yeres and\r\n  xl{ti} w{ch} are fitt to be trayned for harquebus shott, evˀy one\r\n  of them havinge a murrion, a sworde and dagger, and a caliver w{th}\r\n  sufficient furniture for the same, and one half pounde of powder,\r\n  besides touche powder whereof Three of the same pˀsons to be house\r\n  holders and free men of yo{r} saide Companie, and that yo{u} certyfie\r\n  me the saide Maior the names and sir names of all yo{r} saide number\r\n  where and w{th} whome they dwell, of what Companie they be free, and\r\n  what Captaynes or other skilfull men that be of yo{r} saide Companie\r\n  or whome yo{u} knowe inhabitinge w{th}in this Cittie fitt to trayne\r\n  or leade the same men of there names and dwellinge places.

YOVEN at the Guildhall of\r\n  this Cittie of London the xv{th} daie of Marche 1577.[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] _i.e._, 1578.\r\n\r\n                                                       SEBRIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this precept a levy was made upon ninety freemen,\r\nwho contributed £19 17_s._ 11_d._ (in sums ranging from 1{s} to 6{s}\r\n8{d}) and upon ten “foreins” who paid in all £3. The Expenses of the\r\nsoldiers, and their arms, powder, etc., are all set out in detail (see\r\nAppendix D).\r\n\r\n1585. It was agreed “that o{r} Companie by reason of the often and\r\nearnest preceptes from the Lorde maior to move unto some liberall\r\nputtinge in of monie into the Lottery for Armo{r}, that o{r} Companie\r\nshould put in x{li} yf that might satisfie for all the Companie viz{t}\r\nthe Clothinge vj{li} xiij{s} iiij{d} and the yeomanry v m’kes.”\r\n\r\n29th September, 1586. The Lord Mayor had issued sundry precepts to the\r\nCompany for the “buyeinge of certein goune powder amountinge in waight\r\nto of one Mr. Henry Dale Hab’dassher at the price of x{d} le ɫi. and\r\nyt was agreed the saide powder should be bought and that Mr. Swaldell\r\n[Master, 1593] should go to chuyse it, and he to have the same powder\r\nfor viij{d} the pounde.”\r\n\r\n10th March, 1589. It was ordered that the gunpowder directed by another\r\nprecept to be provided by the Company, should be bought and that it\r\nshould be kept “in the Armorie howse in convenient place for feare of\r\ndaunger of ffier.”\r\n\r\n29th March, 1596. It was ordered that £40 “ship money” should be “lent”\r\nby the Company to the City, which is the earliest mention of this\r\nobnoxious tax in our books.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1596. “Yt was agreed that the som̃e of £xxx{ti} shalbe lent\r\nunto the Cytty for the payenge of Souldiers wages and other charges\r\ndiffrayed about the Spanishe voyage.” This was an Expedition of certain\r\nships (furnished by the City) under the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh “to annoye the King of Spaine.” The English then sacked and\r\nburned Cadiz, burnt the Spanish navy, and on their return home, says\r\nStow, “great triumph was made at London for their good successe.”\r\n\r\n18th August, 1598. At this Court came a precept from the Lord Mayor,\r\ncommanding the Company in Her Majesty’s name to “lend” £100 to the\r\nQueen for six months, for suppressing rebels in Ireland. The demand\r\nwas, as usual, of a most peremptory nature, and the Court ordered £100\r\nto be paid to the Treasurers appointed by the City.\r\n\r\n6th August, 1599. A precept came from the Lord Mayor in the Queen’s\r\nname, commanding the Master and Wardens to deliver to the freemen the\r\nCompany’s armour in “suche order as it maye be, in safetye readie for\r\nher Maiesties service,” whereupon the Master took for his own use “one\r\nmuskett fflaske and tuche boxe one headepeece and one rest.” Eleven\r\nother members of the Company had armour delivered out to them, as “one\r\ncaliver fflaske and tuche boxe, sworde and dager girdle and hangers and\r\nheadepeece.”\r\n\r\n1599. A precept was received on 11th November, commanding the Company\r\nto be in attendance on the Queen in her progress from Chelsea to\r\nWestminster, which is not only curious for the quaintness of its\r\ndescription of the persons who were to be appointed, but affords a\r\nglimpse at the magnificence of Royal processions three hundred years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  TO THE MAISTER  }     BY THE MAIOR\r\n  AND WARDENS OF  }\r\n  THE COMPANYE OF }\r\n  BARBOR-SURGEONS.}]\r\n\r\n  WHERE her Ma{ts} moste gratiouse pleasure and comaundement is this\r\n  pˀsente daie signified unto me the lorde Maior from the right ho:\r\n  the lorde Chamberline of her Ma{ties} moste honorable householde\r\n  that myselfe and my Bretheren thaldermen with a conveniente number\r\n  of the beste and moste graveste Cittyzens of this Citye shoulde\r\n  uppon Tewesdaie nexte in the Afternoune wayte and attende uppon her\r\n  highnes royall pˀson from the Towne of Chelsey unto her highnes\r\n  princlie pallace at Westminster in as honorable and statelye sorte\r\n  as conveinentlye maye be pˀformed.

Guihalde the ix\r\n  of November 1599.\r\n\r\n                                                       SEBRIGHTE.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the above precept the Master with seven other Members\r\nof the Court were appointed to attend, and eight freemen were nominated\r\nas torchbearers.\r\n\r\n1600. The fee simple of three houses in Monkwell Street was this year\r\npurchased by the Company of William Fyninge for £112!\r\n\r\n11th November, 1600. In obedience to a precept it was ordered that\r\ntwelve members of the Court “well mounted on horseback and apparrelled\r\nin all poynts accordingely,” together with twelve freemen “to wayte\r\nuppon them w{th} evˀy one twoe staffe torches in his hande,” were\r\nto meet at the Hall on the following Thursday (13th November) and\r\nto ride with the Lord Mayor to Chelsea to conduct the Queen to\r\nWestminster. This procession is thus referred to in Stow’s Annals; “On\r\nthe thirteenth of November 1600, her Maiestie being most honourablie\r\nattended on, by the most honourable Prelates, and Nobles, and Judges\r\nof the Realme, was received neere unto Chelsey, by the Lord Maior of\r\nLondon, with his brethren the Aldermen all in Scarlet, besides to the\r\nnumber of five hundred citizens, in coates of velvet, and chaines\r\nof gold, on horesbacke, every of them having two staffe torches to\r\nattende on them: And they all waited on her, to her royall Pallace at\r\nWestminster.”\r\n\r\n9th November, 1602. Various members of the Company “were appoynted to\r\nryde w{th} the M{r} to meete her Ma{tie} on Saterdaie next” at Chelsea.\r\n\r\n9th April, 1603. A precept was received commanding the Company to\r\ncontribute £12 10_s._ 0_d._ towards the cost of the reception of James\r\nI by the City, whereupon an assessment was made upon the freemen for\r\nthe same, and the Masters made “choyce of sixe pˀsonable menn for\r\nWiflers to attend the Livˀye of this Companye when his Ma{tie} goeth to\r\nbe crowned.”\r\n\r\n20th April, 1603. The following precept requiring the Company to assist\r\nin the reception of the King “in greater number and more statelie and\r\nsumtiows shewe then hath bene at any time heretofore within the memory\r\nof man in the like case pˀformed,” will be read with interest;\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  TO THE M{RS} AND WARDENS }     BY THE MAIOR\r\n         OF THE COMPANY OF }\r\n         BARBOR SURGEONS   }]\r\n\r\n  WHERE the most high and mightie Prince James o{r} most dread &\r\n  soveraygne Lord is by the grace of god shortlie to make his repaire\r\n  from his Kingedom of Scotland into this his Realme of England and so\r\n  consequentlye to this his honorˀble Cittie and chaymber of this his\r\n  imperyall Crowne.

James soon attempted to borrow (as he termed it) of\r\nthe Companies. “Where a pˀcept was directed to õr M{rs.} for the lone\r\nof money to the Kinge, wee are to answer that wee have none.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps this reply sufficed on this occasion.\r\n\r\n22nd October, 1603. London was this year visited with a great Plague,\r\nand in consequence there was no Lord Mayor’s Show.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  TO THE WARDES̃ OF }     BY THE MAIOR.\r\n    THE COMPÃIE OF }\r\n   BARBOR SURGEONS }]\r\n\r\n  THEISE are to will and require you that you take speciall knowledge\r\n  herby that for avoydinge of infecc̃on by assemblie of people this\r\n  tyme of gods vizitac̃on It is thought meate therbe noe shewe made the\r\n  morrowe after Simond and Judes daie next, it is intended that youre\r\n  Companie be dischardged thereof for their Attendac̃e for that tyme.\r\n\r\n                                                       SEBRIGHT.\r\n\r\n  This xxij{th} of October 1603.\r\n\r\n7th February, 1604. The Court having considered the many abuses\r\n“comited against the weale of this Company” decided to apply for an\r\nAct of Parliament which should confer upon them extended powers, and\r\nappointed a Committee for the purpose, with the Recorder and Mr.\r\nWilbraham as counsel.\r\n\r\n20th October, 1604. From an entry of this date, it seems that it had\r\nbeen decided to apply for a fresh Charter, instead of an Act of\r\nParliament, and a summary of the clauses (twenty-seven in number)\r\nwhich it was desired to have embodied therein is set out in full. As\r\nthe Charter was obtained, it is unnecessary to give these suggested\r\nclauses here (they may be seen in Mr. D’Arcy Power’s book, p. 361). The\r\n16th one is, however, curious enough, declaring the “openinge searinge\r\nand imbalmeinge of the dead corpes to be pˀply belongeinge to the\r\nscience of Barbery and Surgery, And the same intruded into by Butchers\r\nTaylors Smythes Chaundlors and others of macanicall trades unskillfull\r\nin Barbery or Surgery, And unseemely and unchristian lyke defaceinge\r\ndisfiguringe and dismembringe the dead Corpes, And so that by theire\r\nunskillfull searinge and imbalmeinge, the corpes corrupteth and groweth\r\npˀntlie contagious and ofensive to the place and pˀsons approachinge.”\r\n\r\n30th January, 1605. The Charter of James I is of this date, but not\r\nnow in our possession; there are, however, two copies of it at the\r\nHall, one of which was made in a vellum book in 1658. It was in Latin\r\nof prodigious length; but the following are the clauses as I make them\r\nout, and will suffice for this work.\r\n\r\n1. It grants to the Company of Barber-Surgeons that it shall be ruled\r\nby four Masters or Governors and twenty-six Assistants.\r\n\r\n2. Power given to the Masters to make lawful assemblies, to keep Courts\r\nin their Common Hall, and therein to consult, counsel and decree\r\ntouching their Statutes, Laws and Ordinances, for the good rule, state\r\nand government of the Company.\r\n\r\n3. Power to make laws, etc., for the government of the Masters or\r\nGovernors, and of all and singular persons using the mysteries of\r\nBarbery or Surgery within the City of London, the liberties and suburbs\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n4. Power to punish offenders by penalties, fines, and imprisonments.\r\n\r\n5. Fines to be levied by distress by the officers of the Company.\r\n\r\n6. Nomination of John Laycock as Master, and of the three Wardens.\r\n\r\n7. The present Masters to continue in office until the Monday next\r\nbefore the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and until the election\r\nof new Masters.\r\n\r\n8.

In accordance\r\nwith the custom of the time, there was a grand pageant and procession\r\nin the City, in which all the Companies took part, and the following\r\nprecept for the same was received by us;--\r\n\r\n                             BY THE MAIOR.\r\n\r\n  TO THE M{R} & WARDENS OF THE }\r\n    COMPANY OF BARBOR SURGEONS }\r\n\r\n  FFOR the bewtefieinge of the streetꝭ and lanes w{th}in this Cittie\r\n  against the passage of the Kingꝭ most excellent mat{ie} and the\r\n  Kinge of Denmarke their nobilitie and trayne from the Tower through\r\n  this Cittie. THEIS are in his Ma{t}ꝭ name straightlie to charge and\r\n  command you that all delayes & excuses sett aparte you have and\r\n  provide yo{r} rayles in a readines for the livery of yo{r} company\r\n  to stand in and to be sett up in the streetꝭ against wednesday the\r\n  xxx{th} day of July at the furthest.

AND hereof faile you\r\n  not at yo{r} pˀill. This xxj{th} of July 1606.\r\n\r\n                                                       SEBRIGHTE.\r\n\r\nThree days after the receipt of the above, came another precept\r\ndemanding £5 from the Barber-Surgeons towards the City’s expenses to be\r\nincurred about the Pageant.\r\n\r\nThe two Kings landed at the Tower, from Greenwich, on the 31st July, on\r\nwhich day the City gave itself up to the gayest doings and rejoicings.\r\nA curious and interesting description of the pageant is to be found\r\nin a rare tract by H. R., 1606, preserved at Guildhall Library. Howes\r\nalso gives an entertaining account of the proceedings, and relates how\r\nthe King of Denmark “seriously observed the unimaginable number of\r\ngallant Ladies, beauteous virgins, and other delicate Dames filling the\r\nWindowes of every houss with kinde aspect saluting” him as he passed\r\nby. He also tells us of the melodious harmony, the Latin speech, the\r\npastoral device, and the fountains which ran with wine, etc.\r\n\r\nIt seems that on this great occasion one of the Marshalls had\r\nendeavoured to take our Company “down a peg” in order of precedence.\r\nThis was, however, successfully resisted, and the Clerk proudly records\r\nthe following in the Minutes on the same day:\r\n\r\n  MEMORAND: that the Kingꝭ ma{tie} w{th} the Kinge of Denmarke & the\r\n  Prince of Wales came through this Cittie from wardes the Tower of\r\n  London attended uppon with the Lordes and gentry of this Land on the\r\n  last day of this instant moneth of July Att which tyme M{r.} ffoxe\r\n  beinge one of the Comittees for placeinge of the Companies standingꝭ\r\n  would have displaced us But by the Lord maiors order wee were placed\r\n  in the seaventeenth place accordinge as wee ought to be placed.\r\n\r\n1606. Notwithstanding the new charter granted in the previous year,\r\nthe Court found itself unable to regulate the practice of Barbery and\r\nSurgery without an extended set of By-Laws, which were now obtained and\r\nare still preserved at the Hall. They are in English, on eight large\r\nskins of parchment, beautifully engrossed with a handsomely illuminated\r\ntitle, the initial ~T~ containing the Barber-Surgeons’ arms, and\r\ndistributed over the heading are the arms of the Master and Wardens in\r\n1606, viz.: John Peck, Edward Rodes, William Fynynge and John Fenton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe By-Laws are allowed by Thomas Lord Ellesmere, Lord Chancellor;\r\nThomas Earl of Dorset, Lord Treasurer; and Sir John Popham, Lord\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas; who send “greeting in our Lord God\r\nEverlasting,” and enact Ordinances of such fearful length, that to\r\na layman it passes comprehension how the draughtsman could have kept\r\nhis head clear whilst he travelled through such a sea of prolixity,\r\nand, to a great extent useless, repetition. If the Chancellor and\r\nhis colleagues troubled themselves to read through and understand\r\nthe document to which they have appended their seals, they must have\r\nuttered very sensible sounds of relief when they came to the sealing;\r\nthe recapitulation of the mere heads of this extraordinary production,\r\nwill probably be found wearisome to the reader, viz{t}:\r\n\r\n1.

The pˀnt M{rs} are this daye authorized to\r\n  furnishe the newe Roome in the Bulwark w{th} cloth of Arras or\r\n  tapestry or w{th} waynscot as they shall think fittest at the chardge\r\n  of this howse, and the Chimney peece & wyndowes to be waynscotted.\r\n\r\n1608. The Colony of Virginia (so named from the Virgin Queen Elizabeth,\r\nin whose reign it was discovered) was in an unsatisfactory condition\r\nby reason of its scanty population, want of enterprise and other\r\ncauses; whereupon the Council of Virginia endeavouring the prosperity\r\nof the Colony, sent a letter to the Lord Mayor propounding a scheme of\r\nemigration and colonisation to be undertaken by the City, which should\r\nease the Metropolis “of a swarme of unnecessarie inmates,” make the\r\nfortunes of the emigrants (and of the “undertakers”) and benefit the\r\nColony. This letter is so interesting that no apology is necessary for\r\nreproducing it here.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS the lords of his Ma{tes} councill, commissioners for the\r\n  Subsedie, desirous to ease the cittie and suburbs of a swarme of\r\n  unnecessarie inmates as a continuall cause of dearth and famine,\r\n  and the verie origenall of all plagues almost that happen in this\r\n  kingdome, have advised yo{r} lordshippe and yo{r} brethren, in\r\n  an ease of state, to make some voluntarie contribuc͠on for their\r\n  remove into the plantation of Virginia, w{ch} we understand you\r\n  all seemed to like as an action pleasing to God and happie for\r\n  this com̃onwealth; We the councell and companie of this ho{ble}\r\n  plantation, willing to yelde unto your lop̃p and them all good\r\n  satisfac͠on, have entered into consultac͠on w{th} o{r}selves, what\r\n  may be everie mans chg̃es, and what of everie private familie, w{ch}\r\n  we send herew{th} at large, not as a thing w{ch} we would exact from\r\n  you, but that you may see, as in a true glasse, the true chg̃e,\r\n  w{ch} we wholly commend unto yo{r} grave wisdoms, both for the somme\r\n  and man{r} of leavie; onlie give us leave thus farre to enforme you\r\n  that we give no bills of adventure for a lesse some than 12{li}\r\n  10{s.} ps̃uminge it wont be an infinite trouble now, and confusion\r\n  in the retribuc͠on, but if your lop̃ make any seasment, or raise any\r\n  voluntarie contribuc͠on out of the best disposed and most able of\r\n  the companies, we are willing to give o{r} bills of adventure to the\r\n  m{r} and wardens, to the general use and behoof of that companie, yf\r\n  by wards, to the good of that ward, or otherwise as it shall please\r\n  you and your brethren out of y{r} better experience to direct. And\r\n  if the inmate called before you and enjoyned to remove shall alledge\r\n  that he hath no place to remove unto, but must lie in the streats,\r\n  and being offerd this journey shall demand what shalbe their pˀsent\r\n  maintenance, what their future hopes, yt may please you to lett them\r\n  know that for the pˀsent they shall have meat, drink, and clothing,\r\n  w{th} an house, orchard, and garden for the meanest familie, and\r\n  a possession of lands to them and their posteritie, one hundreth\r\n  acres for everie man’s pˀson that hath a head or a body able to\r\n  endure labour, as much for his wife, and as much for his child that\r\n  is of yeres to do sˀvice to the colonie, w{th} further pˀticular\r\n  reward according to theire pˀticuler meritt and desert; and yf yo{r}\r\n  lordshipp and yo{r} brethren shalbe pleased to put in any private\r\n  adventure for yo{r} selves in pˀticuler, you shalbe sure to receive\r\n  according to your pˀporc͠on of the adventure, equall pˀts w{th} us\r\n  adventurers from the beginning, both of the comodities returned or\r\n  land to be divided; and because you shall see (being aldermen of so\r\n  famous a cittie) we beare you due respect, we are contented, having\r\n  but one badge of grace and favor from his Ma{tie}, to participate\r\n  w{th} you therein, and to make as many of you as will adventure\r\n  50{li.} or more, fellow councellors from the first day w{th} us who\r\n  have spent double and treble as much as is required, abidden the\r\n  hazard of three sevˀall discoveries, w{th} much care and diligence,\r\n  and many days adventure, and as yo{r} deputies, and yo{r} assistants,\r\n  in yo{r} private wards, so shall as many of them as will adventure\r\n  but 25{li.} present money, be made pˀties of this companie and\r\n  assistants of this councell; and thus as an action concerning God\r\n  and the advancement of religion, the present ease, future hon{r} and\r\n  safety of this kingdome, the strength of o{r} navie, the visible\r\n  hope of a great and rich trade, w{th} many secrete blessings not\r\n  yet discovered, we commend the cause to the wisdome and zeale of\r\n  yo{r} selfe and yo{r} brethren and you, and it, and us, to the holie\r\n  pˀtection of the Almightie.\r\n\r\nThe City took up the scheme heartily, a large sum was subscribed and\r\na great number of emigrants crossed the water. The Barber-Surgeons\r\ninvested £25, but never received anything for it again.\r\n\r\n  23rd March, 1609. This daye it is ordered that the pˀnt M{rs} shall\r\n  advent{r} xxv{li.} uppon a Bill of Exchange for the plantac͠on of\r\n  Virginia, of the stock of this howse.\r\n\r\n6th January, 1609. In obedience to a precept from the Lord Mayor, £10\r\nwas paid to the Chamberlain, towards the construction of a Garner for\r\nthe use of the City.\r\n\r\n25th May, 1610. A precept came from the Lord Mayor calling upon the\r\nCompany “to be readie in yo{r} bardge well and richlie sett forthe\r\nbefore vii of the clocke in the morning” on the 31st January, to go to\r\nChelsea to meet the eldest son of James I, on which occasion he was to\r\ngo from Richmond to Whitehall to be created Prince of Wales; whereupon\r\nthe following minute is recorded:--\r\n\r\n  AT this Court a precept beinge sent from my lord Maior unto this\r\n  Company w{ch} beinge at this Court read, the effect whereof was that\r\n  our Company on Thursdaie next shalbe reddie to attend my Lord Maior\r\n  in their barge for the honor of this Citie in the enterteynement of\r\n  the high & mightie prince at Chelsey. It was ordered that none of\r\n  the Company shold be warned for this service but onely those w{ch}\r\n  ware of the Assistaunce of the Clotheinge to goe in the Barge, the\r\n  reason thereof is that a barge cold not be gotten large enough to\r\n  carry the whole lyvery.\r\n\r\n1611. In this year came a precept from the Lord Mayor, by authority of\r\nthe King, complaining of “the abuse growing by excesse and straunge\r\nfashions of apparell, used by manye apprentises, and by the inordynate\r\npryde of mayde servaunts and women servaunts in their excesse of\r\napparell and follye in varietie of newe fashions, and to admonish\r\nthem to have a due and speciall care to see a spedye reformac͠on had\r\nin everye one of their servaunts.” What effect this had upon the\r\napprentices and servants of the Barber-Surgeons we are not told, but\r\ndoubtless they were properly admonished.\r\n\r\n1st July, 1614. A precept was received to the effect that the King had\r\ndetermined to borrow £100,000 of the City, and that the Barber-Surgeons\r\nwere assessed at £600 towards this loan, which they were to lend, or\r\nwhich they were coolly informed they could compound for, by an absolute\r\nfine of £30! As the Court well knew that they would never again see a\r\nhalfpenny of the £600 if lent, they quickly and wisely determined to\r\npay the £30.\r\n\r\nProfiting by past experience, the next extracts show that the Court\r\nproceeded warily in the matter of “adventuring” in the State Lottery.\r\n\r\n  29th April, 1614. Att this Court the M{r} propounding how they had\r\n  receaved Letters from the Lordꝭ of the privy Councell and from\r\n  the lord Maior thereby exhorting & intreating them to call their\r\n  assistauntes together and to admonishe the genˀall body to be\r\n  adventurers in the great lottery w{ch} is comyng forth, Whereupon the\r\n  same lrẽs being considered on at this Court, it is thought fitt and\r\n  ordered that the M{rs} shall att their pleasures call together the\r\n  body of the Company, and they being gathered together, to admonish &\r\n  pˀswade them to be adventerers in the same Lottery.\r\n\r\n17th October, 1614. The Court having collected a sum of money for the\r\nLottery, it was ordered that it should not be paid to the Treasurer,\r\nSir Thos. Smith, until the Company shall be “assured” by a Bill of\r\nAdventure under seal “for their adventure unto virgynia, as also that\r\nit shalbe published in print certeynelie when the lotterey shalbe\r\ndrawen.”\r\n\r\nThe College of Physicians had been for many years very jealous as\r\nto the Barber-Surgeons trespassing on their preserves, and as far\r\nback as 12th November, 1595, wrote a long letter to their “verie\r\nloving freends” the Master and Wardens, cautioning the members of\r\nthe Company against practising physic, and stating that no few of\r\nthem were culpable in the matter, but that the College had hitherto\r\nforborne to molest or punish them; the letter continues, “but for that\r\nwe now see by daily experience that upon our lenetie and sufferance\r\nthis inconvenience more and more increaseth, insomuch that both in\r\ncredit and otherwise, it seemeth to touch us more neere than well\r\ncan be indured; We have therefore thought it good to put you in mynd\r\nthereof, and therewithal earnestly and freendlie to request you, that\r\namong yourselves some such discreet order may be taken heerin, that\r\nthe like offence hereafter maie not be committed by them or any of\r\ntheirs. Wherein if we shall perceave you as ready to fulfil our honest\r\nrequest, as we are willing to maintain good amytie and concord with\r\nyou and your Companie, we wilbe very glad thereof and geve you thanks\r\ntherefore. If not, then as we are fully minded to defend our privileges\r\nand to deal with the particular offendors therein, as order of law\r\nand our ordinances in that behalf requireth; so we trust the body of\r\nyour Societie will not be offended therewith. And so we bid you most\r\nhartelie farewell.”\r\n\r\nThe above letter is taken from Dr. Goodall’s History of the College of\r\nPhysicians. Dr. Goodall gives several instances of Barber-Surgeons\r\nand Apothecaries being fined or imprisoned for practising physic; and,\r\nindeed, there seems to have been a strife waging between the College\r\nand the Company for a long period.\r\n\r\n1617. The Physicians in 15 James I obtained a Charter confirming their\r\nCharter of 10 Henry viij, with several additional privileges and\r\nclauses in restraint of the privileges of the Barber-Surgeons, who\r\nthereupon petitioned the King that that Charter might not be confirmed\r\nby Act of Parliament, as the Physicians were desirous that it should\r\nbe. The King on 4th February, 1620, ordered that the petitioners should\r\nbe left to seek any lawful remedy either in Parliament or otherwise,\r\nas they might be advised, and accordingly on 23rd April, 1624, they\r\npresented a petition to the House of Commons, who ordered that the\r\nPhysicians’ Patent should be brought into the Committee of Grievances,\r\nand both parties heard by Counsel, the consequence of which was that\r\nthe Physicians proceeded no further with their Bill.\r\n\r\n1632. Later on the Physicians endeavoured again to obtain a supremacy\r\nover the Barber-Surgeons, and on 13th June, 1632, procured an Order in\r\nCouncil which made it incumbent upon Surgeons in certain serious and\r\nspecified cases of Surgery, to call in a “learned Physitian,” and to\r\nenforce this order they procured the Attorney General to exhibit a Bill\r\nin the Star Chamber in which the obnoxious clause was inserted, but on\r\na Petition of the Barber-Surgeons complaining of the injury that would\r\nthereby accrue not only to themselves, but to the public, the King,\r\nby an Order of Court dated 22nd July, 1635, directed the clause to be\r\nstruck out.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, the Physicians again endeavoured to procure\r\nan Act of Parliament confirming their Charter, whereupon the\r\nBarber-Surgeons claimed to have a clause inserted in the Act in the\r\nnature of a proviso that nothing therein contained should be construed\r\nto the prejudice of their privileges, and again the Physicians seem\r\nto have been checkmated, for they allowed their proposed Act to fall\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nKings’ Barbers and Kings’ Surgeons seem to have secured substantial\r\nbenefits from their official positions, as the following notices (from\r\nDomestic State Papers at the Record Office) testify.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1625. There is a letter of this date from Sir James\r\nFullerton to Secretary Conway, intimating that it is His Majesty’s\r\npleasure to grant to Michael Andrews (Master 1635 and King’s Surgeon) a\r\npension of £150 per annum for life.\r\n\r\n17th December, 1625. And at this date is a grant to Thomas Caldwell\r\n(Master 1627 and King’s Barber).\r\n\r\n  A graunt to Thomas Caldwell esq{r} his Mat{s} servant of ye som̃e of\r\n  one thousand poundes To be received as well out of the remainder of\r\n  three hundred pounds due to his Ma{tie} by Richard Harbin sometime\r\n  Collecto{r} of his Ma{t}ꝭ greenwax before his accesse to the Crowne\r\n  and out of the arrerages of grenewax money then due unto his Ma{ty.}\r\n  As also out of the other grenewax moneys now accrewing to his Ma{tie}\r\n  not being in farme. And is granted to him as of his Ma{ts} bounty\r\n  in lieu of 800{li} formerly graunted unto him by his Ma{ty} of\r\n  w{ch} he received no benefitt. Subscrˀ by Mr. Attorney Genˀall upon\r\n  significac͠on of his Ma{t}ꝭ pleasuere by the Lord Trẽr.\r\n\r\nIn addition to stray grants like the above, the perquisites and fees\r\nattaching to the Office of King’s Barber were very lucrative, and Mr.\r\nCaldwell must have done exceedingly well out of the following stroke of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n  January, 1626. Whereas his Ma{tie} hath bene pleased to appoint Mr.\r\n  Thomas Caldwell his Ma{ts} servant and Barber to make provisions of\r\n  all such necessaries as are to be used at the Ceremony of Bathing the\r\n  Kn{ts} of the Bath at this his Ma{ties} Coronac͠on to be holden on\r\n  the 2{d} day of February next at Westm{r} as to his place by auntient\r\n  custome belongeth I do therefore will and require all such whome it\r\n  may concearne to take notice thereof hereby for permitting him to\r\n  doe and performe all such services as hath bene accustomed in that\r\n  behalfe & for delivering such necessaries in kynd or allowance of\r\n  money to the valeu thereof as shalbe by him required for the same\r\n  according to the auntient custome heretofore used therein. The number\r\n  of the said Kn{ts} for whome such provisions are to be made being 80,\r\n  by his Ma{tie} appointed to receave that degree.\r\n\r\n                                                     ARUNDELL & SURREY.\r\n\r\n  Examined by W{m} Ryley }\r\n  Lancaster Herald       }\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell does not appear to have left his widow well provided for,\r\nas we read under date 10th July, 1643:\r\n\r\n  Upon the distressed Petic͠on of Widdow Thamar Caldwall late Wife of\r\n  M{r} Thomas Caldwall deceased there is given to her of the gift of\r\n  this House v{li.}\r\n\r\n1624 and 1625. In the minutes of this period are constant notices of\r\nthe “visitation,” and of “the contagious tyme.” The Plague raged with\r\ngreat severity in London in 1625, and it is said that over 40,000\r\ndied of it in the year. The Company appear to have been very liberal\r\nin their gifts of money to any who had the least claim upon them, the\r\nrelief being frequently stated to have been given by “reason of the\r\nhardnes of the tymes.”\r\n\r\n  11th April, 1625. This daye the pˀcept for provision of corne sent\r\n  unto o{r} Companie by the lord Maio{r} of london was here read in\r\n  Courte, And this Courte is fullie resolved that the present M{rs} doe\r\n  give unto the Lord Maio{r} and returne him this answeare that the\r\n  Companie is provided of their proportion of corne and more they are\r\n  not able to provide or receive into their charge.\r\n\r\n1628. This year the Company were compelled to “lend” the King £360,\r\nwhich they with great difficulty raised, the greater part being\r\nborrowed at interest to enable them to do so. They also paid £30\r\ntowards a “present” (?) of £5,000 given by the City to the Palsgrave\r\n(Frederick, Prince Elector Palatine, son-in-law of James I).\r\n\r\n15th August, 1629. On this day was sealed the Company’s new Charter\r\nfrom Charles I. It is in Latin on five large skins of parchment with\r\nthe Great Seal of England pendant. There is a portrait of the King\r\nwith a stiletto beard in the initial letter, and an ornamental heading\r\nalong the top of the first skin. This Charter ratifies that of James I,\r\ndirects that public lectures on Surgery shall be given, and confirms\r\nand somewhat varies the old regulations for the governance of the\r\npractitioners of that science.\r\n\r\n22nd October, 1629. The Company evidently began now to kick at the\r\nnumerous demands made upon its purse by the authorities, for a precept\r\ncoming from the Lord Mayor demanding £12 10_s._ contribution towards\r\na pageant, it was ordered that it be not paid until the Court was\r\nsatisfied that it could be legally demanded, and enquiry made as to\r\nwhether or no other Companies had paid similar contributions.\r\n\r\n1632. The fabric of old St. Paul’s being in a lamentable state\r\nof decay, the celebrated Archbishop Laud wrote a letter to the\r\nBarber-Surgeons asking a contribution towards its repair. Ever ready\r\nto assist in good works, the Company cheerfully devoted a very\r\nconsiderable sum towards that object, notwithstanding the comparative\r\npoverty to which they had been reduced (in consequence of the grievous\r\nimpositions made upon them by the authorities in the shape of forced\r\nloans and other unconstitutional demands). Moreover, they recorded\r\ntheir benefaction, in a delightfully expressed minute, which will be\r\nfound at the end of the following letter.\r\n\r\n  9th April, 1632. The letter written by William Lord Bishopp of London\r\n  and directed to this Court concerneing our contribuc͠on towardꝭ the\r\n  repaire of St Paulls Church in London being now much ruined was here\r\n  in Court reade, the teno{r} whereof is as followeth, vidz{t}\r\n\r\n      To the right worp{ll} my very worthy ffreindꝭ the Maister Wardeins\r\n      and Assistantꝭ of the Companie of Barbar surgions London, theis\r\n\r\n  S. in xp̃o.[117] After my verie hartie comendac͠ons, you cannot but\r\n  take notice of his Ma{t}ꝭ most hon{ble} and pious intention for\r\n  the Repaire of the decayes of S{t} Pawles Church here in London,\r\n  being the Mother Church of this Citty and Diocess, and the greate\r\n  Cathedrall of this Kingdome. A greate dishono{r} it is not onely to\r\n  this Citty but to the whole State to see that Auncient and goodly\r\n  Pyle of building soe decayed as it is, but it will be a farr greater\r\n  if care should not be taken to prevent the fall of it into ruin, And\r\n  it would be noe lesse disgrace to Religion happily established in\r\n  this Kingdome, if it should have soe litle power over the mindes of\r\n  men as not to prevaile with them to keepe those eminent places of\r\n  Gods service in due and decent repaire which their fforefathers buylt\r\n  in tymes by their owne confession not soe full of the knowledge of\r\n  gods truth as this present age is. I am not ignorant how many worthy\r\n  workes have bene done of late in and about this Citty towardꝭ the\r\n  building and repayring of Churches which makes me hope that every\r\n  mans purse will open to this greate and necessary worke (according to\r\n  Gods blessinge upon him) soe much tending to the service of God and\r\n  the hono{r} of this nation. The generall body of the Cittye have done\r\n  verie worthily in their bounty allready as alsoe the lord Maio{r}\r\n  Aldermen and Sheriffes severally for their owne pˀsons. Theis are\r\n  therefore accordinge to their examples hartily to pray and desire\r\n  you the Maister Wardeins and other Assistants of the worthy Company\r\n  of Barbar Surgions to contribute out of y{e} publicke Stock, to the\r\n  worke aforesaid what you out of y{r} Charitye and devotion shall\r\n  thinke fitt, and to pay the Summe resolved on by you into the Chamber\r\n  of London at or before our Lady Day next, praying you that I may\r\n  receave by any servant of yo{r} Companye a note what the Summe is\r\n  which you resolve to give. And for this Charity of yo{rs} whatsoever\r\n  it shall prove to be, I shall not onely give you harty thankes, but\r\n  be as ready to serve you and every of you, as you are to serve God\r\n  and his Church. Soe not doubting of yo{r} love and forwardnes to this\r\n  greate worke, I leave you to the grace of God, and shall soe rest\r\n\r\n  [117] Health in Christ.\r\n\r\n                                Yo{r} very loving ffreind\r\n\r\n                                                        GUIL: LONDON:\r\n\r\n  London house, January 30. 1632.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And thereupon this Court deepely considering the contentꝭ of that\r\n  letter together with the pˀnte ruines and dilapidac͠ons of the said\r\n  Church, and as faithfull and charitable members obliged largely to\r\n  contribute to soe pious and religious a worke Doe nowe order that out\r\n  of the stock and revenew of this house there shalbe paid into the\r\n  Chamber of london towardꝭ the said repaire x{li} pˀntely and x{li}\r\n  yearely for nine yeares followeing to make it upp compleate a C{li}\r\n  as of the free guift of this house. And if att any tyme hereafter the\r\n  worke doe cease that then our payementꝭ to cease likewise.\r\n\r\n1633. This year the Company built a granary at the Hall, for the store\r\nof Corn.\r\n\r\n12th July, 1633. A new set of By-Laws was framed and allowed by\r\nthe proper authorities. These are extant on twelve great skins of\r\nparchment, more wordy and of greater length than those of 4th James I!\r\nThey are, however, very similar to those, with technical alterations\r\nand amendments here and there, and provision is made for Lectures on\r\nSurgery, demonstrations of anatomy, and for the better Examination of\r\nSurgeons. Clause 19 provides that any freemen of the mystery who shall\r\nuse any arts, trades or sciences other than Surgery “shall be accepted,\r\nreputed, adjudged and taken for Barbars.” Empirics and impostors were\r\nto be rigorously dealt with, and the Court was to have supervision\r\nover _all_ Navy Surgeons, their chests, medicines and instruments. No\r\nBarbers or Surgeons were to be impressed for the Navy without license\r\nof the Court, and numerous regulations were made for the government of\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nThe document is signed by Richard Earl of Portland, Lord Treasurer; Sir\r\nThomas Richardson and Sir Robert Heath, the Lords Chief Justices; the\r\nseals of the first two are still pendant, but that of Sir Robert Heath\r\nis missing.\r\n\r\n1636. Spurred into further action for the advancement of the science\r\nof Surgery, which their extended powers under the new By-Laws had\r\nconferred upon them, the Company determined upon building a Theatre\r\nfor the delivery of Lectures, and for anatomical purposes, etc. This\r\nthey set about in 1636, employing the great Inigo Jones as their\r\nArchitect, who about this period also designed and carried out the\r\npresent beautiful Court Room or Parlour, one of the best proportioned\r\nand prettiest rooms in London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF COURT ROOM.]\r\n\r\n  11th February, 1636. Upon the moc͠on of o{r} M{r} to this Court\r\n  concerneing the want of a publique Theater for Anatomycall exercises\r\n  and Sceletons and a lesser roome for private discections, This Court\r\n  doth order that if the M{rs} or Governo{rs} upon their petic͠on to\r\n  the Lord Maio{r} and Aldrẽn they have the bullwarke & long stripp of\r\n  ground lieing betwixt the gould smiths tenement & clothw: tenemtꝭ\r\n  & london wall at the one end & the Companies hall & pˀlor & london\r\n  wall at the other end, by purchase in fee farme or a long lease from\r\n  the Cittie, that then a Theater to the largenes of the upper ground\r\n  betwixt the goldsmithes tenem̃t & the clothworkers tenem{t} on the\r\n  one side & london wall on the other side shalbe be ovally built for\r\n  the Wor̃p[118] and comiditie of this Companie at the Charge of this\r\n  house.\r\n\r\n  [118] Worship.\r\n\r\nThe piece of ground on which it was proposed to erect the Theatre\r\nwas then on lease to the Company from the City. The Lease was dated\r\n29th March, 7 Charles I (1631), and made between the Mayor, &c., of\r\nLondon, of the one part and the Masters, &c., of the Barber-Surgeons,\r\nof the other part. In consideration of £20 paid by the Company the\r\nCity leased to them lwark and the houses Roomes and buildings therein\r\nor thereupon made or erected, And all that ground or garden plott\r\nwith thappurtenñces scituat lyinge and beinge in the parish of St\r\nOlave in Silver Street in the Citie of London next unto the Wall of\r\nthe same Citie there of the one side, and the landes of the saide\r\nMaisters or Governors and others on the other side late in the tenure\r\nor occupac͠on of the right honoro{ble} Henry late Lord Wyndsor\r\ndeceased or of his assignes and now in the tenure or occupac͠on of\r\nthe said Maisters,” etc., from the feast of the Annunciation, 1631,\r\nfor forty-one years at a rent of £3. The lease contained the usual\r\ncovenants of a repairing lease, as also one “that neither they the\r\nsaide Masters or Governors their successors nor assigns shall or will\r\natt any time or times during the said Terme suffer any Inmate or\r\nInmates to dwell in any part of the premises afore demised.”\r\n\r\n5th May, 1636. There is an Indenture of Lease of this date made\r\nbetween the Mayor, &c., of London, and the Masters, &c., of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, which after reciting the last mentioned lease\r\nproceeds: “And whereas the said Maisters or Governors of the Misterie\r\nand Comonaltie of Barbars and Surgians of London for the better\r\nenhableing of them in the Arte of Surgerie Doe intend to erect and\r\nbuild a decent Roome or Theatre on part of the premisses for the\r\nkeeping therein A learned and constant Lecture in the Theorie and\r\npractiqʒ partꝭ of Surgerie As also to pˀforme their publique operac͠ons\r\nof Anatomies and other exercises thereunto belonging, Which will be\r\nverie chargeable to them Wherein the said Maior and Cominaltie and\r\nCitizens are desirous and willinge to aide and further the saide\r\nMaisters or Governors in the setting forward of soe necessarie\r\nand comendable a worke tendinge to the generall good of the whole\r\nkingdome,” wherefore the Mayor, &c., leased the said premises to the\r\nCompany for a further term of 200 years upon the expiry of the lease\r\nthen running, at the same rent of £3 per annum, the Lessees covenanting\r\nto build the Theatre within seven years.\r\n\r\n  16th May, 1636. Upon o{r} M{rs} report to this Court that the Lord\r\n  Maio{r} & Aldrẽn have freely graunted to this house a new lease of CC\r\n  yeares comenceing from the expirac͠on of o{r} lease now in being It\r\n  is ordered with the generall consent of the whole Court here present\r\n  that the Theater shalbe proceeded in and built according to the\r\n  plotts drawne by his Ma{t}ꝭ Surveigher.\r\n\r\n  3rd August, 1636. It is ordered by this Court that the Companies\r\n  Armes with Helmett Crest supporters and mantlings shalbe sett up in\r\n  Portland Stone under the Cantilaver does of the Theater being over\r\n  the Windowe next the Granarye.\r\n\r\n  Alsoe the mottoe viz{t.} SPECIOSUM HOC THEATRUM ANATOMICUM ERECTÑ\r\n  FUIT MICHAELE ANDREWS CHIRURGO REGIO AC COMUNIONI BARBITONSOꝜ ET\r\n  CHIRURGOꝜ Pˀ TEMPORE PRÆFECTO, GUARDIANIS VERO JOANNE WARDE NICOLAS\r\n  HEATH ET WILHELMO HUCKLE ANNO AB EXHIBITO IN CARNE MESSIÆ SUPRA\r\n  MILLESIMUM SEXCENTESIMUM TRIGESIMO SEXTO shalbe engraven in the voyde\r\n  stone worke over the greate doore into the Theater.\r\n\r\nA plan of the Theatre is preserved in a collection of the works of\r\nInigo Jones, at Worcester College, Oxford, and a short description of\r\nit is found in Hatton’s New View of London, 1708. The curiosities in\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons’ museum of those days will excite a smile when\r\ncompared with the collection now at Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Hatton says\r\nthat the Theatre was built in “an elliptical form, and commodiously\r\nfitted up with four degrees of seats of cedar wood, and adorned with\r\nthe figures of the seven liberal sciences, and the twelve signs of\r\nthe zodiac. Also containing the skeleton of an ostrich, put up by Dr.\r\nHobbs, 1682, with a busto of King Charles I. Two humane skins on the\r\nwood frames, of a man and a woman, in imitation of Adam and Eve, put\r\nup in 1645; a mummy skull, given by Mr. Loveday, 1655. The sceleton of\r\nAtherton with copper joints (he was executed) given by Mr. Knowles in\r\n1693. The figure of a man flead, where all the muscles appear in due\r\nplace and proportion, done after the life. The sceletons of Cambery\r\nBess and Country Tom (as they then call them), 1638; and three other\r\nsceletons of humane bodies.”\r\n\r\nHogarth has, in ghastly style depicted the dissection of a criminal\r\nin this Theatre, in which the skeletons above referred to are seen in\r\nniches in the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTATE IN MONKWELL STREET]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Company’s Estate, has been kindly supplied for this\r\nwork by Mr. Charles John Shoppee, as surveyed by him in 1869, previous\r\nto the demolition of the old Livery Hall, Kitchen, etc. The Theatre had\r\nbeen pulled down in 1784, and houses erected on its site; the Theatre\r\nis, however, shewn upon this plan, as being more interesting than the\r\nhouses which supplanted it. In 1636 the Company commenced the erection\r\nof the Livery Hall and present Court Room, the work being carried out\r\nfrom the designs and under the superintendence of the celebrated Inigo\r\nJones, the Livery Hall was, however, burnt in 1666, and that shown upon\r\nthe plan is the one which was erected after the Great Fire.\r\n\r\n5th September, 1636. The Plague was again abroad in London, and the\r\nCourt, for fear of infection by meeting together, resolved as follows:\r\n\r\n  In regard of the now greate visitac͠on of the plague This Court\r\n  doth deferre the Courts for the daye of Rules the Vew daye & other\r\n  publique Courts till it shall please God to cease the Sicknes.\r\n\r\n23rd September, 1636. The Lord Mayor having requested the Company to\r\nnominate “twoe Surgians to take care of those that were infected with\r\nthe plague in this Cittie & liberties,” the Court thought that two was\r\na wholly insufficient number and nominated six Surgeons to be presented\r\nto the Court of Aldermen.\r\n\r\n2nd October, 1636. £5 was ordered to be paid in to the Chamber of\r\nLondon towards the relief of the poor, stricken with the Plague.\r\n\r\n30th March, 1637. The Company were assessed to pay £10 “ship money,”\r\nwhereupon an order was made that they should forbear to pay it, and\r\na Committee appointed to wait on the Court of Aldermen to petition\r\nagainst the assessment. The application was, however, unsuccessful, as\r\nby an Order of Court, 29th March, 1638, the money was directed to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n8th November, 1638. The Court of Aldermen having assessed the Company\r\nto furnish 80 quarters of corn in lieu of 60 as heretofore provided,\r\nit was resolved to petition against it. This would be a very important\r\nmatter to the Company as the assessments for all public purposes were\r\nmade upon the City Companies _pro rata_ with their corn quarterages,\r\nand if the 80 quarters were allowed to stand, it would raise all the\r\nfuture assessments 33 per cent. The result however, of the protest does\r\nnot appear in the minutes.\r\n\r\n28th October, 1640. On receipt of a precept from the Lord Mayor, it was\r\nordered that three barrels of Gunpowder should be bought and stored.\r\n\r\n1640. The Company unwillingly agreed to lend the King £400, and were\r\nput to great inconvenience in raising the money, which was required by\r\nCharles for his campaign in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAfter several skirmishes with the Scots, the English Army was at length\r\ndisbanded, and the King went himself to Scotland to negotiate the\r\ndifference which had arisen by his attempted interference in Church\r\nmatters in that Kingdom; he returned to London in November, 1641, and\r\nthe following minute refers to the preparations made by our Company to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\n  22nd November, 1641. Upon reading the Lord Maiors precepts for the\r\n  Companyes enterteyning the King upon his returne from Scotland It is\r\n  ordered that the Ma{r} and Wardens, Mr. Serjeant Clowes, Mr. Richard\r\n  Wateson, Mr. Woodall, Mr. Powell, Mr. Burgin, Mr. Heath, Mr. Henry\r\n  Wateson, Mr. Bignall, Mr. Dye, Mr. Arris, Henry Boone, and Thomas\r\n  Turner, shalbe attendant on Twesday next well mounted on Horseback in\r\n  plush or Velvett with Chaines of Gold, and that John Perkins shall\r\n  beare the Pendon with our Coate of Armes on Horseback and that these\r\n  18 ffree men shalbe Decently cladd in the Companyes Colours of White\r\n  and Greene, each of them with a greene flatt Cap with a white Ribbon\r\n  about it, a greene Cassock and Drawers of the same Stuffe Whiffler\r\n  like laced with a white Lace a white ribaning and a greene Ribbin\r\n  athwart theire Brests, and each of them a Truncheon in theire hands\r\n  in the forenoone, and in the aftˀnoone each of them 2 Torches, and\r\n  these 18 to attend perticulerly one of them to each of the Horsemen,\r\n  viz{t.}\r\n\r\n(Then follows a list of the freemen chosen.)\r\n\r\nThe “Riding out” on this occasion must have been a magnificent sight,\r\nif all of the Companies spent proportionately to the outlay of ours,\r\nwhich was no less than £39 17_s._ 10_d._ upon decorations, etc., for\r\nthose taking part in the procession. Strype informs us that--\r\n\r\n  The Lord Mayor on horesback wearing a gown of crimson velvet & a\r\n  collar of SS, and attended by his suite, rode in the front of the\r\n  procession to meet the King. Then followed the Aldermen in scarlet\r\n  gowns and the City council and chief officers in black gowns. Upon\r\n  reaching Moorfields, there waited in a readiness to attend his\r\n  Lordship and the service, about five hundred horsemen selected out\r\n  of the Liveries of the several Companies, being Masters, Wardens,\r\n  and prime men of each Company in velvet or plush coats and suits,\r\n  with chains of gold, being well horsed and gallantly furnished, every\r\n  Company having a horseman in the front carrying a pendant with that\r\n  Company’s arms to which he did belong (for distinction sake), and a\r\n  footman to attend each horseman of the Livery with truncheons and\r\n  torches as before, both horsemen with the pendants and footmen being\r\n  suited cap-a-pee with the Company’s colours on which they waited.\r\n  There were also fourteen Trumpeters, with trumpets, banners and\r\n  scarfs, who were placed two between every hundred of the horse, and\r\n  four at the head of the troop. The procession moved on to Kingsland,\r\n  where the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and the Companies awaited the Kings\r\n  approach, while the Sheriffs attended by seventy-two men in Scarlet\r\n  Cloaks trimmed with silver lace (the colours of the City) with\r\n  javelins and feathers and four trumpeters, rode as far as Stamford\r\n  Hill, and there met their Majesties and escorted them to Kingsland.\r\n\r\n  His Majesty was accompanied by the Queen, the Prince, the Duke of\r\n  York, the Princess Mary and the Prince Elector Palatine, and after\r\n  receiving an address, the Royal party joined the civic procession\r\n  to London, entering it at Moorgate, and proceeded through London\r\n  Wall, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill and Cheapside, to the banquet\r\n  at Guildhall, amidst the City Companies in their formalities and\r\n  stands on each side of the streets, the City conduits running with a\r\n  diversity of wines.\r\n\r\n1643. The relations between the King and the City having become\r\nestranged in the fearful distractions of these times, Charles\r\nendeavoured to conciliate the citizens with a message, which was\r\npublicly read at Guildhall on the 13th January, and later on he sent\r\na circular letter to the Masters of the several Companies requiring\r\nthem to call their freemen and apprentices together, to read to them a\r\ncopy of a letter which he had sent to the City on the 17th January. The\r\nCourt of the Barber-Surgeons met on Tuesday, 24th inst., and cautiously\r\nrecord that they would have summoned their freemen for the next day,\r\nbut that it was a fast day and that in the interim an order had come\r\nfrom the Committee of Safety that the letter, etc., should not be read.\r\n\r\n  24th January, 1643. The Kings Letter sent to the M{rs} & Wardens of\r\n  this Company was read in Court and the printed Letter in it and the\r\n  Cittyes Petic͠on and his Ma{ties} gracious answer unto it. And but\r\n  that the morrow was fast day being the last Wednesday in this Moneth\r\n  the ffreemen and apprentices of this Company could not be summoned\r\n  to appeare then, it should have bin read. Soe that in the Interim\r\n  an Order of Comand from the Lords and Comõns was directed to this\r\n  Company to countermaund the said Letters in these words,\r\n\r\n  Die Martis 24{to} Januarii, 164-2/3. At the Comittee of Lords and\r\n  Comõns for the safety of the Kingdome.\r\n\r\n  Whereas there are divers Letters pretended to be sent by his Ma{tie}\r\n  to the M{rs} and Wardens of the severall Halls in the city of London\r\n  with Two litle Bookes therein closed the one intituled The humble\r\n  Petic͠on of the Maior, Aldermen and Comõns of the City of London\r\n  to his Ma{tie.} And the other intituled his Ma{ties} Letter and\r\n  declarac͠on to the Sheriffes and City of London Dated the 17{th}\r\n  of January, which evidently tendeth to sedition and setting of the\r\n  whole State in a Combustion. These are therefore strictly to charge\r\n  & comand the M{rs} and Wardens of every Hall in the City to whome\r\n  the said Letters and Bookes inclosed shalbe directed to forbeare to\r\n  publish or open any of them till both the Houses of Parliament shall\r\n  give further order therein. And the M{rs} and Wardens of every Hall\r\n  are required to bring the said Letters with the Messengers thereof to\r\n  this Comittee which they will take to be an Argument of theire good\r\n  Affection to the Parliament\r\n\r\n      Pembroke         Montgomery   Bolingbroke   Ed: Manchester\r\n      W. Say & Seale   Ed: Howard   Jo: Evelin    Jo: Pym\r\n      Antho: Nicoll.\r\n\r\n  17th January, 1644. It is ordered that in respect of the greate\r\n  troubles and distractions of these times there shalbe noe publique\r\n  Anatomy this yeare dissected.\r\n\r\n1644. The Company seem to have become greatly impoverished by the\r\nventure in Ireland, the rebuilding of their premises, and the forced\r\nloans to the King and the Parliament. In a certificate given by the\r\nMaster and Wardens (5th September, 1644) to be produced in a suit in\r\nwhich they were defendants, they state that their debts are £3,000,\r\nand that they can get no return of any of the money lent for public\r\npurposes, or even the interest of it.\r\n\r\nIf the Stuarts acted in an unconstitutional manner in their oppressive\r\ndemands upon the Companies, the Roundheads were as bad, with just this\r\ndifference, that, with all their pretensions to purity, piety and\r\nhigh-mindedness, they did not hesitate to practise actual dishonesty\r\nin their _modus operandi_ of squeezing the Companies, as the following\r\npainful incident from our books testifies:--The Company had borrowed\r\nfrom Mr. Richard Wateson, one of the Assistants, £1,200 upon sealed\r\nbonds, for the express purpose of meeting the demands which had been\r\nmade upon them by the King and Parliament from time to time. Mr.\r\nWateson having been declared a “Papist and Delinquent,” his property\r\nwas seized, and the Bonds of the Barber-Surgeons, found in his strong\r\nchest, were taken to the Committee for Gloucester and Hereford, sitting\r\nat Grocers’ Hall. These worthies, in conjunction with the Committee\r\nfor Sequestrations, came down upon the Company and demanded payment\r\nof the £1,200 for which they had given their bonds to their brother,\r\nMr. Wateson. The Court deeming this a monstrous piece of injustice,\r\nhesitated to comply, whereupon the Committees threatened to seize\r\nthe Company’s entire estate; and then the Court resolved to petition\r\nParliament, but the House not sitting for some time the petition could\r\nnot be prosecuted, and the Committee being urgent, the Company most\r\nreluctantly agreed to pay down £400 and to have the bonds cancelled.\r\nAlthough these shameful terms were definitely agreed upon, the\r\nCommittees a few days later broke faith, demanding £400 cash and the\r\nCompany’s bond for another £100, to which the Company, like the lamb\r\nwith the wolf at its throat, _nolens volens_, consented. The iniquity\r\nof this business was made apparent to the Committees, who were well\r\naware that the Company had incurred the debt to Mr. Wateson in order\r\nto meet the previous rapacity of themselves, and yet they hesitated\r\nnot to compel the Company to submit to a further fine of £500 for\r\nhaving complied with their demands in the past, besides manifesting the\r\ndishonesty proposed by them in offering to cancel the debt due by the\r\nCompany to Mr. Wateson.\r\n\r\n  29th April, 1645. By the power and authority to this Court given by\r\n  severall Orders of a late Court of Assistants, this Court for and\r\n  towards the raiseing of the 400{li} agreed to be paid in part of\r\n  the composic͠on for Mr. Watson’s debt unto the the Comittee for the\r\n  releife of Gloucester, &c., did pawne all the Companyes plate both\r\n  guilt and white, weighing 1,120 oz. 1/3 or thereabouts, unto Mary\r\n  Crosse of London Widdow for the Sum̃ of 280{li} by a Writeing of\r\n  Bargaine and Sale this day sealed with this Companyes Com̃on Seale\r\n  bearing date the 16{th} day of this Instant Aprill with a provisoe of\r\n  Redempc͠on. And borrowed of Mr. George Dunn 100{li} more at Interest\r\n  at vj{li} 10{s} pˀ annum pˀ centum for w{ch} he tooke the secureity\r\n  of our Com̃on Seale.\r\n\r\nA few years later on (14th September, 1648), Mr. Edward Arris presented\r\nto the Court a letter from Mr. Wateson, wherein was intimated that he\r\nexpected the Company to repay him the money borrowed, the bonds for\r\nwhich had been seized by Cromwell’s party, and for which the Company\r\nhad already compounded, whereupon we read “This Court doth declare\r\ntheire acknowledgement of a great respect and esteeme they have and\r\nbeare towards him and shalbe ready to doe him all the right they can\r\nwithout prejudicing the Company”; and again on 30th April, 1650, “Mr.\r\nRichard Wateson an ancient M{r} of this Company Doth this day desire\r\nto know the mind of this Court concerning the 1,200{li} by him lent to\r\nthis Company and sequestred in this Company’s hands and compounded ffor\r\n500{li} in full of principall and Interest, The matter being of great\r\nConsequence, this Court doth take time to consider of it and to give\r\nhim an answer therein.”\r\n\r\nWhat answer Mr. Wateson got, I do not know; he was held in great esteem\r\nby the Company, and doubtless some honourable compromise was arranged.\r\n\r\nIn their negotiations with the Committees, the Company seem to have\r\nbeen able to impress the Chairman favourably on certain occasions,\r\nthough there is grave reason to apprehend that this official of the\r\nparty of purity was open to a bribe, as the following minutes would\r\nseem to indicate.\r\n\r\n27th October, 1645. The Company having been threatened with\r\nsequestration of their entire estate unless an assessment made upon\r\nthem was paid on Friday following, a Committee of the Court was ordered\r\nto wait on Mr. Scawin, the Chairman of the Committee for the Army, to\r\nbeg his favourable consideration of the Company’s poor estate; the\r\nresult is seen in the next entry.\r\n\r\n  14th September, 1648. This Court takeing notice of the greate Love\r\n  and ffavour of Mr. Scawin Chaireman to the Comittee ffor the Army\r\n  expressed oftentimes upon severall occasions towards our Company\r\n  Doth thinke fitt in gratitude and accordingly doth order That the\r\n  present Governours doe present to him a guift of the value of vj{li}\r\n  13{s} 4{d} The quality and price of the guift is left to theire\r\n  discretions.\r\n\r\n1646. To relieve them of their great debts, the Company about this\r\nperiod raised considerable sums by granting annuities; the following\r\nare examples in point:--\r\n\r\n  24th March, 1646. This day M{r} Nicholas Heath payd the sum of\r\n  200{li} to the use of this Company and is the purchase money for an\r\n  Annuity of 26{li} pˀ añn. for 10 yeares to himselfe and Grace his\r\n  Wife Whereupon the Deed of Grant of the said Annuity was sealed with\r\n  the Com̃on Seale and delivered to theire use.\r\n\r\n  Alsoe this day M{ris} Elizabeth ffreeman payd the sum of 200{li} the\r\n  Purchase money for the like Annuity of 26{li} pˀ añn. for 10 yeares\r\n  and the Deed for that purpose was sealed and delivered to her.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th January, 1649, the King’s troubles were ended by his\r\nmurder, and very shortly afterwards we find this significant minute.\r\n\r\n  19th March, 1649. This Court doth order That the Oath conteyned in\r\n  the Rules and Ordinances of this Company be administred unto every\r\n  ffreeman upon his admission as before, The ffirst Words which doe\r\n  concerne allegiance to the King and his Successors only to be left\r\n  out.\r\n\r\nThe banners of the Company bearing the late King’s arms were destroyed,\r\nand any heraldic insignia at the Hall which contained the Royal Arms\r\nwere ordered to be defaced. We may readily believe that this was most\r\nunwillingly done by the Court, who however, had no option in the matter.\r\n\r\n1648-9. Fairfax had filled the City with troops, “billetting orders”\r\nbeing made upon the several Companies for the reception of the soldiers\r\nat their Halls. Herbert (Vol. I, p. 181) states that the Merchant\r\nTaylors were fortunate enough to procure an order of exemption which\r\ncost them £20 10_s._, and further that he believed their case to be\r\nunique, but it seems that the Carpenters by means of “Gratuities ‘to\r\nsevˀall men of qualitie,’” amounting to £13 2_s._ 6_d._, managed to\r\nget free of this imposition, whilst the Barber-Surgeons procured their\r\nimmunity at a much cheaper rate, for we read in the Wardens’ accounts\r\nof the period,\r\n\r\n  Paid fforr the charges expended in procureing a Protecc͠on from the\r\n  Lord General from quartering Souldiers in the hall 13{s} 3{d.}\r\n\r\nThese notices are clear indications that Cromwell and the “men of\r\nqualitie” about him, were accustomed to take bribes.\r\n\r\n3rd February, 1654. The City entertained Cromwell at Grocers’ Hall, and\r\nour Company had to go out in procession to receive him, our “standing”\r\nbeing in St. Paul’s Churchyard.\r\n\r\n1660. The Barber-Surgeons contributed £96 towards a present of £10,000\r\ngiven by the City to Charles II at the Restoration. No money exacted\r\nunder precept was more willingly paid than this, and indeed the\r\nCompanies generally seemed to have cheerfully contributed, delighted\r\nto have escaped the gloom of the Commonwealth, and with a prospect\r\nof brighter times in store. On the 5th July, the King was nobly\r\nentertained at Guildhall, our Company taking part in the rejoicings\r\n(see Wardens’ Accounts of this date).\r\n\r\n1666. Our Minute Books for this period having been lost or stolen, we\r\nunfortunately have no records of the Great Fire beyond those preserved\r\nin the “Wardens’ Accounts” (which see), and although these are somewhat\r\nmeagre, they are highly interesting, especially those which relate to\r\nthe fortunate preservation of the great Holbein picture. It has been\r\nstated (but without any other authority than that of gossiping Samuel\r\nPepys, who had a special interest in disparaging the picture) that it\r\nwas damaged in the fire, though no notice of such a mishap is known to\r\nme, and the Accounts (which are _complete_) are significantly silent\r\nas to anything having been spent on its restoration or cleansing,\r\nwhich, had it been injured, would have been necessary; it seems to have\r\nbeen taken away from the Hall by Major Brookes to a place of safety,\r\nand subsequently brought home again by six porters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ENTRANCE TO BARBER-SURGEONS’ HALL.]\r\n\r\nThe Theatre, which was a detached building, as also the present Court\r\nRoom, both the works of Inigo Jones, were saved, though the Hall was\r\nburned, entailing a great expense upon the Company in rebuilding (see\r\nWardens’ Accounts).\r\n\r\nThe houses 33, 34 and 35, Monkwell Street (see plan, p. 135) were\r\nrebuilt 1671, when the gateway to the Hall Court Yard was formed and\r\nthe grotesque coat-of-arms put up over the Lintol.\r\n\r\nWhen the alterations were made under the superintendence of Charles J.\r\nShoppee in 1869, the old lintol, corbels, tympanum, and door-head were\r\nvery carefully taken down and refixed over the present entrance to the\r\nHall in the Court Yard. This door-head is always an object of interest\r\nto visitors to Barbers’ Hall; long may it continue to be so!\r\n\r\n25th August, 1681. A short set of By-Laws was this day enacted. It\r\nis on a single skin of parchment, and imposes penalties upon such\r\npersons, as, being elected, should refuse to serve as Masters or\r\nStewards of Anatomy. It is signed by Heneage, Earl of Nottingham, Lord\r\nChancellor, and Sir Francis Pemberton and Sir Francis North, the two\r\nLords Chief Justices, all of whose seals are pendant to the document.\r\n\r\n1684. This was indeed a troublous year for the Corporation and for\r\nthe guilds of London. Charles having interfered with the privileges\r\nof the City by thrusting in his nominees for Sheriffs, had met with\r\nconsiderable opposition from the citizens, and being assured that\r\nthis resistance would be continued and maintained by the City, he\r\ndetermined to strike a blow at the root of its franchise, by getting\r\ninto his hands the Charter of the City, as also the Charters of the\r\nseveral Companies. It was not difficult to procure a venal tribunal\r\nwhich would be prepared to pronounce an iniquitous judgment upon any\r\nfictitious statement submitted to it by the King. Sir Rob{t.} Sawyer,\r\nthe Attorney-General, thereupon undertook, on behalf of the Crown,\r\nto prove that the City Charters were forfeited, and contrived the\r\ncelebrated _quo warranto_, upon which judgment was (as a matter of\r\ncourse) obtained against the City, on the 12th June, 1684.\r\n\r\nThe Companies seem to have unanimously anticipated this decision, and\r\nby so doing and by “surrendering” their Charters and liberties before\r\nthe delivery of the judgment, hoped to ensure the favour of the King.\r\n\r\nThe original of the “surrender” of the Barber-Surgeons is very neatly\r\nengrossed on extra thick parchment, but the seal was of course removed\r\nwhen it was returned to the Company. The text is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  To all to whom these p{r}sents shall come. GOVERNO{RS} of y{e}\r\n  MYSTERY and COĨALTIE of BARB{RS} & SURGEONS of LONDON send GREETING.\r\n  KNOW yee y{t} wee considering how much it imports the Governm{t}\r\n  of our company to have men of known Loyalty & approved integrity\r\n  to bear offices of Magistracy & places of Trust. The s{d} Ma{rs}\r\n  or Govern{rs} have granted surrendred and yielded up, and by these\r\n  p{r}sents do grant surrend{r} and yield up unto his most gracious\r\n  Majesty CHARLES ye second by the Grace of God King of England,\r\n  &c., his Heires and Successo{rs.} All and singular y{e} Powers\r\n  Franchises liberties priviledges and authorities whatsoever and\r\n  howsoever granted to or to bee used or exercised by y{e} said Masters\r\n  or Governo{rs} by vertue of any right Title or Interest vested in\r\n  them by any Charters Letters Patents Custome or Prescripc͠on in\r\n  force of or concerning the electing nominating constituting being\r\n  or appointing of any person or persons into or for y{e} severall\r\n  and respective offices of Mast{r} Wardens Assistants and Clerk of\r\n  y{e} said Company. And y{e} said Masters or Governo{rs} do hereby\r\n  humbly beseech his Ma{tie} to accept of this their surrend{r} and\r\n  do with all submission to his Majesties good pleasure implore his\r\n  grace and favo{r} to regrant to y{e} said Masters or Governo{rs} the\r\n  nameing and Chusing of y{e} said Officers and the said libertie and\r\n  ffranchises or so many of them and in such mann{r} as his Majesty in\r\n  his great wisdome shall judge most conducing for y{e} governm{t} of\r\n  y{e} said Company, And with and under such reservacc͠ons restricc͠ons\r\n  and qualificac͠ons as his Majestie shall bee pleased to appoint. IN\r\n  WITNES whereof the said MAST{RS} or GOVERNO{RS} have hereunto affixed\r\n  their Com̃on seal the sixteenth day of Aprill in y{e} Thirty sixth\r\n  year of y{e} reign of o{r} or sovˀaign LORD CHARLES y{e} second, &c.,\r\n  and in y{e} year of o{r} Lord Christ 1684.\r\n\r\nSimilar forms of surrender were adopted by other Companies. I am unable\r\nto say whether or no the King interfered with the franchises of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, but think not, as no record of such meddling is to be\r\nfound in our books, though, doubtless, the Court took care, remembering\r\nthe rod in pickle, to govern in accordance with the wishes of the King.\r\n\r\nSome time in this year (1684) certain unquiet spirits, Surgeons of our\r\nCompany, got up a petition to the King, setting forth that the union of\r\nSurgeons with Barbers hindered rather than promoted the end for which\r\nthe two bodies had been united, and praying the King to incorporate the\r\nSurgeons a distinct and separate body. Nothing came of this application\r\nbeyond a reference (ordered by the King, 15th May, 1684) to the Lord\r\nKeeper of the Great Seal, and the Lord Chief Justice of the King’s\r\nBench, who were directed to examine and report upon the petition, but\r\nwhether they ever did so or not, I don’t know.\r\n\r\n27th February, 1685. James II, in the first year of his reign, granted\r\nus a Charter, which is contained on seven skins of parchment, all of\r\nwhich have handsomely designed head-pieces and borders, the first one\r\nhaving a fine portrait of the King as well; only a fragment of the\r\ngreat seal remains, and the charter itself is considerably damaged,\r\napparently by rats. It is in Latin, of great length, and, like others\r\ngranted to other companies at the period, is an “unreal mockery.”\r\nThe Charter recites the “Surrender,” and proceeds to grant another\r\ncharter in which, _inter alia_, the appointment of any Master, Warden,\r\nAssistant, or Clerk should be subject to the approval of the King,\r\nthat all members of the Company should take the Oaths of Supremacy and\r\nAllegiance, be in the Communion of the Church of England and receive\r\nthe Sacrament, and that no person who frequented a conventicle should\r\nbe eligible for the Livery.\r\n\r\n4th April, 1687. The King having published a declaration, allowing\r\nliberty of conscience to all his subjects, suspending and dispensing\r\nwith the penal laws and tests, and even with the Oaths of Supremacy\r\nand Allegiance on admission into offices civil and military, numerous\r\naddresses of thanks for this liberty were presented to the King, among\r\nothers the following one from our Company, which is preserved in the\r\n“London Gazette” of 20th October, 1687.\r\n\r\n      THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF THE MASTERS GOVERNORS ASSISTANTS\r\n        AND MEMBERS OF THE MYSTERY AND COMMONALTY OF BARBERS\r\n        AND SURGEONS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n  MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY\r\n\r\n  We having daily before our eyes the munificent Bounties of your Royal\r\n  Brother of Blessed Memory, and other Your Ancestors, and also that of\r\n  your Majesties Gracious Favour, in restoring to us our new Charter,\r\n  we must be esteemed ever ungrateful and undutiful Subjects, if we did\r\n  not with all humility acknowledge the same.\r\n\r\n  But we are in more especial manner bound to cast ourselves at Your\r\n  Majesties Feet, and return our most humble and hearty Thanks for\r\n  Your late Declaration; wherein You are Graciously pleased to give\r\n  us Your Royal Word, whereby we are protected in the Profession and\r\n  free Exercise of our Religion, and also in the Enjoyment of our\r\n  Liberties and Properties in Peace and Safety; for which Your Gracious\r\n  Condescension and Goodness (as God hath made it our Duty), Your\r\n  Majesty hath made it our Interest duly to pray to the Divine Majesty\r\n  for his Blessing upon your Royal Person, Family and Government. And\r\n  that after the enjoyment of a long and prosperous reign here, over a\r\n  Dutiful and Obedient People, You may receive an everlasting Crown in\r\n  the World to come.\r\n\r\n  And that it may be so, it shall be as it becomes us, the constant and\r\n  utmost endeavour, as well as the hearty Prayer of,\r\n\r\n      Dread Sir!\r\n\r\n      Your Majesties most humble, most Loyal,\r\n      and most obliged Subjects.\r\n\r\n1688. Matters were now rapidly approaching a crisis with James, who\r\nin vain, when too late, sought to conciliate the citizens whom he had\r\nwronged. One of his acts of propitiation was the redelivery to the\r\nCompanies of the “surrenders” which they had made of their franchises\r\nand charters in 1684. We have no note of the date of the return of our\r\nsurrender; but it was towards the end of November and within about a\r\nfortnight of the King’s flight when this tardy act of justice was done,\r\nand the Barber-Surgeons thus partly restored to their ancient rights\r\nand privileges. The Bill of Rights was shortly afterwards passed, the\r\n_quo warranto_ declared illegal, and all charters granted by Charles\r\nII and James II since the judgment on the _quo warranto_, declared\r\nabsolutely null and void, thus practically reinstating the Guilds in\r\n_statu quo ante_.\r\n\r\n  28 July, 1690. Ordered that in pursuance of an order of the Com̃on\r\n  Counsell & Lord Mayor &c. that the Company advance towards the\r\n  provideing one Rigiment of Horse & one of Dragoone the sum̃e of one\r\n  hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n1699. Jealousies arose in the Company in consequence of the more\r\nfrequent election of Surgeons than Barbers, as Governors. The By-Laws\r\nrequired that every year there should be two Barbers and two Surgeons\r\nchosen (a Barber being defined to be any member who did not practise\r\nSurgery). The Surgeons disregarding the law and the old custom, seem to\r\nhave been able to procure the election of an undue number of members of\r\ntheir own craft to the offices of Master and Wardens, whereupon certain\r\nof the Company filed an information in the King’s Bench against the\r\nMasters or Governors; the Barbers were successful, and having obtained\r\na Mandamus, a fresh election took place. This altercation between the\r\nBarbers and Surgeons was never forgotten, and, indeed, helped to pave\r\nthe way to further estrangement and the absolute separation in 1745.\r\n\r\nThe following Minutes relate to these proceedings:\r\n\r\n  14th December, 1699. Ordered Mr. S{r}geant Wright Mr. S{r}geant\r\n  Darnell Mr. Com̃on S{r}geant & Mr. Dee bee advised with upon the\r\n  Informac͠on ag{t} the Govern{rs.}\r\n\r\n  25th January, 1700. Ordered that the Cause ag{t} the Govern{rs} at\r\n  the prosecuc͠on of the Barbers bee referred to S{r}geant Darnell\r\n  & his opinion to bee taken & to pˀceed thereupon, Mr. Oades Mr.\r\n  Pleahill & Mr. Barnard to meet tomorrow at the raine bow to attend\r\n  him by five in the afternoone.\r\n\r\n  2nd May, 1700. Ordered Mr. Dee bee consulted concerning the Rule of\r\n  Court of King’s Bench for a copy of the by laws &c. & to follow his\r\n  advice &c. He advised to give Copyes if required & not to oppose it.\r\n\r\n  11th May, 1700. Ordered that Mr. S{r}geant Darnell have three guineys\r\n  Mr. Com̃on S{r}geant & Mr. Dee have two a peece given them for the\r\n  Tryall of the Informac͠on on Tuesday next & that all the Court of\r\n  Assistants bee desired to bee there.\r\n\r\n  28th June, 1700. Ordered that nothing bee done in the Cause ag{t} the\r\n  Company untill the Mandamus be served & then the Comittee to meete.\r\n\r\n  4th July, 1700. A pˀemtory Mandamus being served the last Court,\r\n  Ordered that on Tuesday next by two of the Clock in the afternoon\r\n  there bee an elecc͠on of two Wardens Expert in Barbery for the\r\n  remainder of this yeare.\r\n\r\n9th July, 1700. An election took place, with the result that Mr. John\r\nPinke and Mr. Richard Marks, both being Barbers, were elected Wardens.\r\nMr. Pinke was already a Warden, but the Mandamus required two Barbers\r\nto be elected, and he was simply re-elected. Mr. Marks took the place\r\nof Mr. Bartholomew King, Surgeon. The Master, Mr. Lichfield, and the\r\nsecond Warden, Mr. James Wall, were both Surgeons.\r\n\r\n13th January, 1709. It was agreed that a new set of By-Laws which had\r\nbeen settled by the Common Serjeant and Sir Edward Northey should be\r\npresented to the Lord Chancellor, etc., for confirmation, it being\r\nconsidered that the existing By-Laws were defective in many parts, and\r\nthat “good & wholesome Lawes were the life strength & support of this\r\nCompany.”\r\n\r\n6th April, 1709. A set of By-Laws of this date was confirmed. They are\r\ncomprised on thirteen great skins of parchment, and, like previous\r\nones, are far too voluminous, and indeed not of sufficient interest,\r\nto warrant transcribing, being practically the former set with sundry\r\ntechnical and minor alterations. There is a fine portrait of Queen\r\nAnne on the first skin, and the Document is signed by William Lord\r\nCowper, Lord Chancellor, Sir John Holt and Sir John Trevor, Lords Chief\r\nJustices, whose seals are pendant. These By-Laws were brought into\r\nCourt on 5th May, 1709.\r\n\r\n13th January, 1709. The Court were informed that the Barbers of the\r\nCompany were in treaty with the Peruke Makers “of the other end of the\r\ntown,” about incorporating them into this Company, and that they were\r\nendeavouring to procure an Act of Parliament to that effect, whereupon\r\nthe proposition was approved and leave given to the Barbers to petition\r\nParliament in the name of the Court.\r\n\r\n5th December, 1709. A petition was presented by sundry liverymen\r\n(Barbers) representing that Peruke making was an encroachment upon the\r\nart of Barbery, and praying the Court to obtain an Act of Parliament\r\nincorporating the Peruke Makers with the Barber-Surgeons; the petition\r\nwas favourably received by the Court and a Committee appointed, who\r\nmet the next day and recommended the proposed union, the Peruke Makers\r\npaying such fees as other members of the Company paid.\r\n\r\n24th December, 1709. A petition for an Act was ordered to be drawn by\r\nthe Clerk and submitted to several eminent counsel for their perusal.\r\n\r\n9th January, 1710. Five hundred copies of the proposed Bill, and a\r\nsimilar number of the reasons for the suggested incorporation, were\r\nordered to be printed; but in the result nothing came of this proposed\r\nunion with the Peruke Makers.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1714. The following precept relating to the Accession of\r\nGeorge I was received:\r\n\r\n  TO THE MASTER AND WARDENS OF   }      BY THE MAYOR.\r\n  THE COMPANY OF BARBER SURGEONS.}\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS it hath been resolved in Com̃on Councill y{t} if our most\r\n  Gratious Lord King George upon his comeing into this Kingdome be\r\n  pleased to pass through this his City of London, y{t} he shall be\r\n  received by us & our fellow citizens with all the Demonstrationes of\r\n  Joy & affection as are suitable to our duty and Loyalty.\r\n\r\n  These are therefore to require you to have your Rayle Cloaths\r\n  Standings Banners Streamers Ensignes & other Ornaments of triumph\r\n  belonging to your Company in a readiness to sett up imẽadiatly upon\r\n  Notice y{t} shall be given you of the time & place by any further\r\n  precept & y{t} yo{r} Cloaths Banners Streamers Ensignes & other\r\n  ornaments be fresh & Good & y{t} you forthwith send to all the\r\n  Liverymen of yo{r} Company that they be well & decently apparrelled\r\n  in their best Cloaths & Gowns to attend in their Standings y{t} so\r\n  your Company may be ready (when required) to receive his Maj{tie} to\r\n  his satisfac͠on & the Honour of this City and thereof you are not to\r\n  faile. Dated this 25{th} day of August, 1714.\r\n\r\n                                                       GIBSON.\r\n\r\n23rd December, 1717. The Company having had great difficulty in\r\ngetting in some of their rents, and various of the houses being empty,\r\ndetermined to sell their property in Mowse Alley, East Smithfield, and\r\nin Butcher Row in St. Botolph’s, Aldgate, agreeing to convey the fee\r\nsimple to Mr. Robert Finlay for £1,250.\r\n\r\n  And it is further ordered by this Court that till such time as the\r\n  said sume of 1250{li} can be laid out in a convenient purchase of\r\n  houses or lands with the approbac͠on of the Court of Assistants, The\r\n  same shall be forthwith placed out at Interest by the Governors upon\r\n  such Government or other Publick securitys as they shall think fitt,\r\n  But that the said sume of 1250{li} or any part thereof shall never be\r\n  expended on the Company’s common occac͠ons or be any way lessened or\r\n  broke into on any account whatsoever.\r\n\r\n17th April, 1718. The following record was ordered to be made of the\r\n“reasons” for disposing of this property:\r\n\r\n  The Estate in East Smithfield in eleven years time produced to the\r\n  Company above all disbursements relating thereto[119] but £28 15_s._\r\n  in the whole, Whereas the annual interest of £1250 at 4 pˀ cent. is\r\n  £50.\r\n\r\n  [119] But these disbursements had been very heavy _in the nature of\r\n  repairs_.\r\n\r\n  Eleven years interest at £50 pˀ ann. for £1250 amounts to without\r\n  computeing Interest upon Interest £550.\r\n\r\n  The Company have run behind hand for severall years by means of the\r\n  great sumes laid out upon this Estate.\r\n\r\n  Whoever goes backward every year must in time be undone.\r\n\r\n  The Estate is still in such a condition as to require a great sum̃e\r\n  of money to be expended upon it in Repairing and Rebuilding in order\r\n  to make it tenantable.\r\n\r\n  The Company had not money to lay out upon it.\r\n\r\n  If they had, the Estate is so scituated that there is no room to\r\n  hope, even in case the whole had been rebuilt (as it wants to be)\r\n  that it would have answered the laying out so much money.\r\n\r\n  And if the Company had let it upon building Leases The pˀsent method\r\n  of building is so as to last exactly the term for which the Lease is\r\n  taken, wouˀd have put the Company in the same condic͠on as they are\r\n  now, when the term expired, besides loss of Rent, & disputes with\r\n  such Tenants in the mean time.\r\n\r\n  It was therefore thought better to dispose of the Estate.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the details of negotiations with one or two parties other\r\nthan Mr. Finlay, and some curious particulars of the Company’s title to\r\npart of the Estate, which seems to have been an equitable rather than a\r\nlegal one, whereby the Court apprehended some difficulty in disposing\r\nof it to another party from whom a somewhat better price might have\r\nbeen obtained, and therein, under the circumstances, showed themselves\r\ngood men of business by concluding with Mr. Finlay: we cannot however\r\nnow, but regret that this most valuable property should have passed\r\nfrom us for so comparatively insignificant a sum. The purchase-money\r\nwas laid out in thirteen East India Bonds of £100 each.\r\n\r\n  7th April, 1730. M{r} Serj{t} Dickins the Master of the Company\r\n  informing the Court, That he having the honour to be acquainted with\r\n  the Right Honourable The Earl of Burlington and with his Lordships\r\n  most extraordinary genius and superior judgment in Architecture, had\r\n  taken the liberty to address himself to the said noble Earl, and to\r\n  make it his humble request to his Lordship that he would be pleased\r\n  to favour the Company with his opinion, in what manner it would\r\n  be safest and best to repair the anatomical Theatre built by the\r\n  celebrated Inigo Jones about one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n  That his Lordship had thereupon condescended to take a view of the\r\n  Theatre and most obligingly directed the proper method of repairing\r\n  a structure of so peculiar a frame, and afterwards out of his\r\n  accustomed generosity, and in regard to the memory of that great\r\n  Architect offered to defray the expence thereof.\r\n\r\n  IT IS THEREUPON RESOLVED NEMINE CONTRADICENTE by this Court, That\r\n  the Master and Wardens of the Company together with the late Master\r\n  William Cotesworth Esq{r} be, and they are hereby desired forthwith\r\n  to wait on the Right Honb̃le The Earl of Burlington, and in the most\r\n  gratefull manner to assure his Lordship in the name of the whole\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  THAT they do receive this noble instance of his Lordships bounty and\r\n  generosity as a most distinguishing & illustrious mark of honour\r\n  shown by his Lordship to the Company & Profession.\r\n\r\n  And that this Court will take care so to record & transmitt the\r\n  remembrance of this magnificent action of his Lordship to their\r\n  successors That the gratitude of the Company to his Lordship’s person\r\n  and memory may be for ever preserved among them.\r\n\r\n13th August, 1730. A marble Bust of the Earl of Burlington was ordered\r\nto be set up in the Theatre.\r\n\r\n27th April, 1739. “The Court taking into their considerac͠on that\r\nseveral of their By-Laws, which had been confirmed by the Lord\r\nChancellor and Lord Chief Justices for the time being, were in want of\r\nalteration, by reason of the variation of the times and circumstances\r\nof the Company and their Members since such By-Laws were made, and\r\nseveral new By-Laws being also wanting for the better government of\r\nthe Company in times to come,” It was ordered that a Committee of six\r\nshould consult and draw up fresh By-Laws, to be submitted to a future\r\nCourt of Assistants, but in the result no action was taken.\r\n\r\n1744. The long slumbering animosity between the Surgeons and the\r\nBarbers had now reached a climax, and indeed it is a matter of surprise\r\nthat an union which had become grotesque should have existed for as\r\nmany years as it had. The Surgeons, many of whom had attained to\r\ngreat eminence, naturally chafed under a system which required their\r\ndiplomas to be signed by Governors, two of whom were always Barbers,\r\nor members of some trade or profession other than that of a Surgeon,\r\nand with the rapid progress of science and of surgical skill and\r\nknowledge, they felt their alliance with the Barbers a restraint upon\r\ntheir advancement, as also that the exercise of their profession under\r\nCharters and By-Laws, antiquated in form, and more adapted to the times\r\nin which they were framed, a hindrance rather than an incitement to\r\nfurther proficiency.\r\n\r\nThere is little in the records as to this disagreement, it being\r\ntacitly agreed that neither side should place their arguments or\r\ngrievances in the books, which were their joint property.\r\n\r\n  20th December, 1744. This day the gentlemen on the Surgeons side\r\n  having made known at this Court their desire of being separated from\r\n  the gentlemen on the Barbers and that each may be made a distinct\r\n  and independent Body free from each other, and producing a Case\r\n  intended to be offered to the Honourable House of Commons praying\r\n  such separation, which being read at this Court It was agreed that\r\n  the following gentlemen on the Barbers side viz{t.}--\r\n\r\n  M{r.} Warden Negus M{r.} Parker M{r.} Maurice M{r.} Truelove and\r\n  M{r.} Haddon.\r\n\r\n  & on the Surgeons side viz{t.}--\r\n\r\n  M{r.} Serj{t} Dickins Will{m} Petty Esq{r} James Dansie Esq{re} M{r.}\r\n  Freke and M{r.} Sainthill\r\n\r\n  be a Committe appointed to meet on Monday next at the Kings Arms\r\n  Tavern in Saint Paul’s Church Yard at one of the Clock at noon to\r\n  receive the proposals from the Gentlemen on the Surgeon’s side for\r\n  such Separation, and that when they had so done that the Gentlemen on\r\n  the Barber’s side members of this Court should lay the same before\r\n  the Livery on their side, by a Meeting to be had for that purpose,\r\n  and that a Court of Assistants should be held on the Tenth day of\r\n  January next, at which time the Gentlemen on the Barber’s Side\r\n  Members of this Court, should then report their opinion and assent or\r\n  Dissent to such proposals made.\r\n\r\n  At the same time it was agreed that any Member of this Court should\r\n  at any time have the free liberty of examining and inspecting into\r\n  the several Books and writings belonging to this Company In case the\r\n  same should be in the presence of the Master or one of the Wardens\r\n  but not otherwise, but no such Books or writings be at any time\r\n  removed from the Hall, on any account whatever unless by a special\r\n  order of this Court first had and obtained for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  10th January, 1745. Pursuant to an Order of the last Court of\r\n  Assistants the gentlemen on the Barbers side Members of this Court,\r\n  did this day make their report on the proposals made by the gentlemen\r\n  on the Surgeons side for a separation, by Dissenting in general to\r\n  such proposals made.\r\n\r\nBy the Journals of the House of Commons, 18 George II, it appears that\r\nthe Surgeons on 31st January, 1745, presented a petition to Parliament,\r\nin which among other things they recited the Act, 32 Henry VIII, and\r\nalso that Charles I in the 5th year of his reign,\r\n\r\n  by Letters Patent under the great seal confirmed the Barber Surgeon’s\r\n  Company in their possessions and privileges and gave the Company\r\n  power to make by-laws and to constitute ten persons to be Examiners\r\n  of Surgeons during their lives, and it was thereby further granted\r\n  that no person whether freeman foreigner native of England or alien\r\n  should practise Surgery in London or Westminster or within seven\r\n  miles of the City of London unless previously examined allowed and\r\n  admitted by the Company in manner therein mentioned; and that the\r\n  Surgeons so examined might practise in any part of England; and that\r\n  the Masters and Governors of the said Company might appoint and\r\n  have a public lecture for the science of Surgery, for the better\r\n  instruction and information in the principles and rudiments of the\r\n  art and science of Surgery, and that no person exercising the art of\r\n  Surgery within the limits therein mentioned should go out or send any\r\n  apprentice or servant from the Port of London to serve in quality\r\n  of a Surgeon for any ship without the approbation and allowance of\r\n  the said Company, in such manner and under such penalties as are\r\n  therein mentioned. That since the said Act for incorporating the two\r\n  said Companies, those of the said Company practising Surgery have\r\n  from their sole and constant study of, and application to the said\r\n  science, rendered the profession and practice thereof of great and\r\n  public benefit and utility to this Kingdom, and that the Barbers\r\n  belonging to the said Corporation are now, and have been many years,\r\n  employed in a business foreign to and independent of the practice of\r\n  Surgery; and that the Surgeons belonging to the same Corporation,\r\n  being now become a numerous and considerable body, and finding their\r\n  union with the Barbers inconvenient in many respects and in no degree\r\n  conducive to the progress or improvement of the art of Surgery,\r\n  are therefore desirous that the Surgeons being freemen of the said\r\n  Company, may be made a Corporation separate and distinct from and\r\n  independent of the Barbers of, and belonging to the said Company;\r\n  and therefore praying the House to give leave that a bill may be\r\n  brought in dissolving and vacating the union and incorporation of the\r\n  Barbers and Surgeons made by the said former act; and for making the\r\n  Surgeons of the said Company a separate and distinct Corporation; and\r\n  for making a partition and division of the real and personal estate\r\n  and effects of and belonging to the said united Company, unto and\r\n  for the separate benefit of the said two Companies so proposed to be\r\n  separated, as to this House shall seem meet and reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhereupon it was ordered--\r\n\r\n  That the said petition be referred to the consideration of a\r\n  Committee and that they do examine the matter thereof, and report the\r\n  same with their opinion thereupon to the House.\r\n\r\nA Committee was at once appointed with power to send for persons,\r\npapers, and records.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th February the Barbers presented a Petition against the\r\nproposed separation, and asked to be heard by counsel; whereupon it was\r\nordered--\r\n\r\n  That the said petition be referred to the consideration of the\r\n  Committee to whom the petition of the Surgeons of London, whose\r\n  names are thereunto subscribed, on behalf of themselves and other\r\n  the Surgeons in the City and suburbs of London is referred: And that\r\n  these petitioners the said Barbers, if they think fit be heard by\r\n  their Counsel before the said Committee according to the prayer of\r\n  the said petitioners.\r\n\r\nThis petition of the Barbers to the House of Commons was identical\r\nwith a very scarce pamphlet “The Case of the Barbers,” a copy of which\r\nhas been kindly given to me by Mr. D’Arcy Power, M.A. It is full of\r\ninterest, and will be found in Appendix E.\r\n\r\n27th February, 1745. The Committee brought up their report, which was\r\nread by the Clerk, and recited the various documents produced and the\r\nevidence tendered; among other matters it is stated that Mr. John\r\nHayward, a Past Master, was examined and deposed, that the Master\r\n(who every other year was a Barber) and the Wardens present, sign the\r\ndiplomas. That there are ten Examiners who have each half a guinea\r\nfor their attendance, and the Master and Wardens have the like. That\r\nhe did not know that the presence of Barbers at these examinations\r\nwas any inconvenience, but he apprehended it would be more eligible\r\nif the Master were always a Surgeon. That the Barbers are generally\r\npresent at the four public lectures of Anatomy, two of which are at\r\nthe expense of the Company, the other two being at the expense of the\r\nSurgeons. That the Demonstrators of Anatomy and Osteology are chosen\r\nby the whole Court of Assistants (fifteen of whom are Barbers, and\r\nfifteen Surgeons). That he apprehends the present union is the reason\r\nwhy so many persons do not bind their sons apprentice at the Hall. He\r\nnever knew of the Barbers interfering in or giving interruption to\r\nexaminations, and he never heard any fact mentioned as a reason for the\r\nseparation desired by the Surgeons, except that a great many foreign\r\nbrothers (who are gentlemen that practise both in and out of town)\r\nrefuse to come into the Company on account of the present expense.\r\n\r\nBeing examined as to the money generally given to the Poor’s Box by\r\nSea Surgeons at the time of their receiving a Qualification, he said\r\nthat it was always expected, but that if they are not in a capacity\r\nit is not insisted upon, and that he never heard of any person being\r\ndenied a Qualification for refusing to pay it. That the Qualification\r\nis delivered to the party sealed up, to be carried to the Navy Office,\r\nand that the Master commonly signifies to him what fees are expected;\r\nthat the said Box is examined every month, and about nine-tenths of\r\nthe money distributed by the Master and Wardens, among the poor of the\r\nBarbers.\r\n\r\nBeing asked what proportion the Barbers pay to the Poor’s Box, he said\r\nthat the greatest part of the income applied to that use arises from\r\nthe examination of Sea Surgeons, but that the Apprentices of Barbers\r\n(who are as twenty to one) always pay when bound at the Hall, and at\r\ntheir admission to the freedom, as well as the Surgeons.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayward put before the Committee a statement of the fines received\r\nby the Company, which was as follows--\r\n\r\n                                             Surgeons.       Barbers.\r\n                                           _£   s.  d._   _£   s.  d._\r\n\r\n  For Freedom by purchase                   10  10   0      6   6   0\r\n\r\n   \"  Livery fine, and all Offices to the\r\n        Parlor door                         35   0   0     25   0   0\r\n\r\n   \"  Examination for great Diploma          6   6   0\r\n\r\n   \"  The fine for not serving the four\r\n        several offices of Master and the\r\n        three Wardens, which the Surgeons\r\n        often pay, but the Barbers never\r\n        do, sometimes 30 guineas but\r\n        oftener                             40   0   0     40   0   0\r\n\r\n   \"  The fine for Master and Stewards of\r\n        Anatomy when called upon in turn\r\n        (and if they serve, the expense\r\n        is rather greater)                  40   0   0\r\n                                          ------------    -----------\r\n                                          £131  16   0    £71   6   0\r\n                                          ============    ===========\r\n\r\nThe Clerk’s and Beadle’s fees are not included in the above.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Wheeler, the Clerk of the Company, was examined by the\r\nCommittee, and generally confirmed Mr. Hayward’s evidence.\r\n\r\nThe next witness, Mr. Neil Stewart, was evidently called in the\r\ninterest of the Surgeons, to show the inconvenience which had arisen\r\n(in his case at all events) by reason of the warrants being issued\r\nby the “_Barbers_ and Surgeons.” He deposed that he was surgeon to\r\nH.M.S. The Looe, and, being taken prisoner by the French, was put in\r\nthe common prison at Brest, where he petitioned to be removed to an\r\nopen hospital at Dinan, and enclosed his warrant as a surgeon with\r\nhis petition to the French authorities; some days after, he enquired\r\nof the “Linguist” as to the success of his petition, and was informed\r\nthat “the Superintendent did not know by his warrant whether he\r\n(the witness) was a Barber _or_ a Surgeon: that upon his desiring\r\nthe linguist to read the warrant, by which it would appear he was a\r\nsurgeon, the linguist replied that it might be so, but that if the\r\nwitness had been taken on board one of the King of Great Britain’s\r\nships it would have been out of doubt.” This witness further stated\r\nthat he believed the unfavourable notice which was taken of his\r\npetition was because his warrant came from the Masters of the _Barbers_\r\nand Surgeons.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the gift of Edward Arris the Court minutes of 29th\r\nFebruary, 1675-6 were produced which stated that “Mr. Edward Arris a\r\nvery worthy member of this Company having formerly settled by Deed £30\r\na year for a dissection of a body yearly and Reading on the Muscles,\r\ndesired that deed might be delivered up to him,” and he in return\r\nwould pay the Company £510 to enable them to apply the interest to the\r\nsame purposes, which was agreed to. Mr. Arris dying on the 28th May,\r\n1676, the Company soon became involved in a Chancery suit with his\r\nson, Dr. Thomas Arris, and the Court minutes of 20th January, 1677-8\r\nwere produced and read to the Committee. These set forth the answer\r\nwhich the Company filed to the Bill of Complaint before the Master of\r\nthe Rolls, and stated the circumstances referred to in the minutes of\r\n29th February, 1675-6, and that Mr. Arris gave as his reason for this\r\n“That his only son and heir, the now Doctor, had and did then receive\r\nthe profits of the said lands to his own use upon condition and under\r\npromise to pay the said £30 per annum for the said Dissection; but he\r\nfound that he did never pay one penny of it, or ever would do, when he\r\ntheir benefactor was dead, without trouble or suit; with some severe\r\nand sharp expressions, which we will by no means mention, although they\r\nwere the very words of the father spoken of the son.”\r\n\r\nThe answer goes on to express the hope that the Company will not be\r\ncompelled to enter into any further covenant with Dr. Arris than they\r\nhad done with his father their “pious benefactor,” for the carrying out\r\nof the trust, or be ordered to refund the £510 to Dr. Arris. It also\r\nprayed that he might be ordered to pay the costs of “this troublesome\r\nand unnecessary suit, which doth so much shew what they must expect\r\nfrom him hereafter, if they should part with the £510.” As the Company\r\nretained the £510 till the separation in 1745, there is no doubt but\r\nthat Dr. Arris, as he deserved to do, lost his suit.\r\n\r\nVarious extracts from the Company’s books were read, on behalf of\r\nthe Barbers, to show that the united Company had always assisted the\r\nSurgeons, and promoted the cause and interest of Surgery out of the\r\ncommon fund of the Barbers and Surgeons.\r\n\r\nPart of the Will of Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon, dated 2nd\r\nDecember, 1470,[120] was read, whereby it appeared that several estates\r\nformerly belonging to the said Company, were given to the Barbers\r\nbefore their union with the Surgeons in Henry VIII’s time. And a\r\ndeclaration of Bryan Sandford, dated 8th March, 1490, was read, whereby\r\nit appeared that the site of the Hall was purchased by the Barbers\r\nbefore the said Union.\r\n\r\n[120] But see p. 61 as to this Will. I cannot explain the discrepancy.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the House of Commons reported that they had\r\nrecommended the parties to settle the dispute as to the division of the\r\nproperty between them, and that thereupon the Surgeons had proposed\r\nthat they should have given up to them Dr. Gale’s Annuity of £16 per\r\nannum and Alderman Arris’ gift of £510; also that for about three years\r\nuntil the Surgeons could provide themselves with suitable premises,\r\nthey should have the use of the Hall, Theatre, &c., at a nominal rent\r\nof one guinea per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Barbers agreed to give up Gale’s and Arris’ gifts, but proposed\r\nthat the Surgeons should take a lease for such days in the year as they\r\ncommonly used the premises, at £80 per annum, and pay the Barbers £100\r\ntowards the expenses to which they had been put by this suit in the\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn the result the Committee reported:--(_a_) That the Surgeons had\r\nmade good the allegations of their petition. (_b_) That the proposed\r\nseparation was desirable. (_c_) That the propositions of the Surgeons\r\ntouching the division of the property were reasonable.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Bill passed both Houses and received the Royal Assent,\r\nthe quaint union being dissolved 25th June, 1745.\r\n\r\nBy this Act (18 Geo. II) the Surgeons were erected into a separate\r\nCorporation, and the Barbers were re-incorporated under the style of\r\n“The Master, Governors and Commonalty of the Mystery of Barbers of\r\nLondon.” So much of this Act as relates to the Barbers will be found in\r\nthe Appendix F.\r\n\r\nThe first Court of Assistants of “~The Barbers’ Company~” was held on\r\nthe 25th June, 1745, at 10 a.m., and there were present:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. JONATHAN MEDLEY                  _Master_.\r\n  Mr. HUMPHRY NEGUS                    _Second Governor_.\r\n\r\n  Mr. WILLIAM PARKER. }               { Mr. SAMUEL RUTTER.\r\n  Mr. JOHN BARNWELL.  }               { Mr. ROBERT SCROOBY.\r\n  Mr. JOHN TRUELOVE.  }               { Mr. RICHARD SWITHIN.\r\n  Mr. WILLIAM HADDON. } _Assistants._ { Mr. EDWARD COLEBECK.\r\n  Mr. JOHN NEGUS.     }               { Mr. TOGARMAH JONES.\r\n  Mr. EDWARD BOXLEY.  }               { Mr. JOHN GURNEY.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Separation being read, and the Oaths as formerly required to\r\nbe taken by Freemen, Master, Warden, Assistant, Clerk, and Beadle being\r\nalso read and considered, the Court settled and formulated the various\r\nOaths, and the same are entered in the Minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Election of nine fit and able persons to be Assistants was then\r\nproceeded with, and Mr. William Jackson, Mr. John Bearblock, Mr.\r\nWill{m.} Roberts, Mr. Thomas Cotton, Mr. John Whiting, Mr. Richard\r\nLookes, James Theobald, Esqre., Peter Theobald, Esqre., and Mr. John\r\nPepys, were unanimously elected.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Boxley and Mr. Samuel Rutter were chosen third and fourth\r\nGovernors or Wardens.\r\n\r\nThanks were voted to Mr. Jonathan Medley and Mr. Humphry Negus “for\r\ntheir great care in defending and preserving the Rights Priviledges and\r\nproperty of this Company on their Separation from the Surgeons.”\r\n\r\nThanks were also voted to Mr. John Paterson “for his great care and\r\ndiligence in executing the orders and directions of the Master and\r\nGovernor about the defence and preservation of the rights priviledges\r\nand property of the Company” and to further mark their sense of the\r\nsame, the Court unanimously elected Mr. Paterson as Clerk.\r\n\r\nThe two Beadles, Henry Gretton and William Littlebury were re-elected.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that all Charters, Books, Plate and goods belonging\r\nto the Company, then in the custody of Mr. Joseph Wheeler (the late\r\nClerk) should be delivered to Mr. Paterson, who was to make and sign an\r\nInventory of the same, and also to examine Mr. Wheeler’s accounts, and\r\nreport thereon to the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Common Seal was directed to be altered by omitting the words ET\r\nCHIRURGORUM and by adding ANNO MDCCXLV.\r\n\r\nA Committee was appointed to peruse the By-Laws of the late United\r\nCompany, and to report as to which of them required amendment or were\r\nfit to be repealed or added to.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1751. Mr. John Brooks attended and produced a Deed to\r\nwhich he requested the subscription of the Court; this deed recited\r\nthat by an Act of Parliament passed in the 10th year of Queen Anne,\r\nit was enacted that a duty of 2_d._ per lb. should be laid upon all\r\nstarch imported, and of 1_d._ per lb. upon all starch made in Great\r\nBritain, that no perfumer, barber, or seller of hair-powder should\r\nmix any powder of alabaster, plaster of Paris, whiting, lime, etc.\r\n(sweet scents excepted), with any starch to be made use of for making\r\nhair-powder, under pain of forfeiting the hair-powder and £50, and\r\nthat any person who should expose the same for sale should forfeit\r\nit and £20. Also that by further Acts additional duties were laid\r\nupon starch. And by an Act passed in the 4th year of George II the\r\npenalties were somewhat mitigated. “And whereas the said laws with\r\nrespect to hair-powder have by experience been found not to answer the\r\nend proposed by the Legislature, the sum arising by the said duties\r\nupon starch and hair-powder having gradually lessened, whilst the\r\nfair traders have been great sufferers by the practice of those who\r\nby the greatness of the duty have attempted to make vend or use the\r\nsaid prohibited articles. And whereas the trade or business of making\r\nvending or dressing of Perukes or other Ornaments of hair for the head\r\nand also of cutting and dressing the hair of the head being considered\r\nas distinct from the business of Barbers is under no regulation\r\nwhatever,” etc., the parties whom Mr. Brooks represented (and whose\r\nnames were signed to the deed) had, therefore, agreed to join in an\r\napplication to Parliament for reducing the duties on hair-powder, as\r\nalso for incorporating all persons carrying on the trade of Barbers and\r\nPeruke-makers within the Bills of Mortality, into one joint Corporation\r\nor Body politick, and for restraining persons from exercising those\r\ntrades who had not served seven years’ apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that subscriptions towards defraying the costs of the\r\nproposed Bill had been paid to Messrs. Gosling & Bennett, Bankers in\r\nFleet Street, that John Paterson, Esq., Clerk of the Company, was\r\nSolicitor for the Bill, and Mr. John Brooks was Secretary of the\r\nPetitioners.\r\n\r\nThe Court, having considered the application, decided to contribute\r\nTwenty Guineas, but the matter seems to have been in abeyance for\r\neighteen months, as the petition to the House of Commons was not\r\nsealed by the Company until the 7th January, 1753.\r\n\r\n13th January, 1753. The petition was this day presented and is recorded\r\nin the Journals of the House; it states, among other things, that the\r\nCompany “are in danger of being unable to support themselves and that\r\nthe petitioners who exercise the art of Peruke making in the liberties\r\nand neighbourhood of the said City are not a body corporate, nor under\r\nany order or regulation; for want whereof great frauds are practised\r\nin the said manufacture to the discouragement of the fair trader, and\r\nmanifest injury of the consumer, And therefore praying the House that\r\nleave may be given for the bringing in a Bill for incorporating the\r\nPeruke makers as well within as without the liberties of the City of\r\nLondon, and within such distance thereof as the House shall think fit,\r\nwith the said petitioners”--the Barbers’ Company. This petition was\r\nreferred to a Committee, but no report of that Committee is entered in\r\nthe Journals.\r\n\r\n4th December, 1764. The Peruke makers turned up again in 1764, for we\r\nfind in the Minutes that certain of them attended with the draft of\r\na petition to the King, to which they asked the assent of the Court.\r\nThis petition which strangely commenced “We the Company of Barbers _and\r\nPeruke makers_,” stated that the suppliants laid before his Majesty the\r\ndistresses into which the Peruke makers had fallen by reason of the\r\nchange of fashion, and thus appeals to the King, “Where can we look\r\nfor relief but there only where it is to be found, for as the Fashion\r\nyour Majesty approves will very justly be a pattern to your subjects,\r\nWe most humbly hope not to be too bold in wishing Perukes may soon be\r\nas much in fashion as the wearing of hair is at present, which will\r\nincrease the Revenue, give happiness to the indigent and distressed\r\nPeruke makers, and increase the many great unmerited Favours, We as a\r\nCompany have received from Royal Hands!”\r\n\r\n16th January, 1765. The Court took this ridiculous petition into\r\nconsideration, and of course refused to adopt it, informing the\r\nsuppliants that they were concerned to observe the decay in their\r\ntrade, as it was connected by usage with that of Barbery, but as the\r\nCharters of the Company did not extend to Peruke making, the Court\r\ncould not with propriety address his Majesty on the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMMITTEE ROOM, BARBERS’ HALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM COURT MINUTES, ETC.,\r\n\r\nMORE PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE\r\n\r\nINTERNAL HISTORY OF THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  29th August, 1550. ~Memorandum~ the xxix{th} day of Auguste in the\r\n  house belonging to the sayd Company it was condescended and fully\r\n  agreed by the aforesayed M{r} and Wardeins M{r} Geen Thomas Johnson\r\n  Thomas Stocdall and Mathew Johnson w{t} thassent of thassistance\r\n  being there present that is to say M{r} Kyrkeˀ (Kyrkeby)[121] M{r}\r\n  Vycary[122] M{r} Bancks[123] M{r} Byrde[124] M{r} Yonge[125] M{r}\r\n  Henderbe[126] Robert Postell[127] Willm Tyllˀ (Tylley)[128] Peter\r\n  Dayseman[129] Robert Waterforde[130] Richard Bowll[131] Henry\r\n  Pemberton[132] Robert Sprignell[133] Robert Brownell[134] John\r\n  Smythe[135] Willm̄ Otherborne[136] and Austeyn Clarck.[137]\r\n\r\n  [121] Master 1526, 1533.\r\n  [122] M. 1530, etc.\r\n  [123] M. 1532.\r\n  [124] M. 1542, 1545.\r\n  [125] M. 1544.\r\n  [126] M. 1547.\r\n  [127] Warden 1544.\r\n  [128] W. 1546.\r\n  [129] W. 1547.\r\n  [130] W. 1549.\r\n  [131] M. 1553.\r\n  [132] W. 1539.\r\n  [133] M. 1554.\r\n  [134] M. 1563.\r\n  [135] W. 1547.\r\n  [136] W. 1548.\r\n  [137] W. 1554.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  An order taken\r\n  concerninge\r\n  Thomas Knot.]\r\n\r\n  THAT Thomas Knot shalbe dischardged and not called to no manner of\r\n  office unto such tyme that it shall please the m{rs} to agree for\r\n  Another order.

The old vellum book of ordinances, etc., containing\r\nportions of the four Gospels in Latin, and still in our possession is\r\nprobably the book referred to in the minute of this date, which states\r\nthat Willm̄ Grene had “taken an othe upon the blacke booke that serveth\r\nin this howse for the same purpose.”\r\n\r\n  13th Nov., 1567.

In thys Courte here was Rich Roberts and he is\r\n  comanded that he shall agree w{th} this mystery as a brother or ells\r\n  he to shutte up his shoppe and ocupye no more but as a servant upon\r\n  the penallties of the statute.\r\n\r\n10th March, 1569.

Wysto was contumacious for a long period, but seems on\r\n17th July, 1572, to have made humble submission and apology, whereupon\r\nan order was made “That none do stirre upp any talke consr̃ninge\r\nthe deprivac͠on or submyssion of Ric. Wistowe”; he was subsequently\r\nre-admitted on to the Court and served Master 1586, but the animus\r\nagainst him revived, and on 7th November, 1587, certain parties were\r\nbefore the Court for reviling him on the old score, and were duly\r\nthreatened and admonished as to their future behaviour.\r\n\r\n  22nd November, 1569. Here was Phillip Jordan for trymming upon the\r\n  sabboth daye and he once agayne is warned upon the penalltie of the\r\n  acte that he do y{t} hence forwardes no more (see 18th May, 1568).\r\n\r\n  10th October, 1570.

There are several entries in the books of members of the\r\nCourt being removed for misbehaviour.\r\n\r\n27th January, 1571. It was ordered that--\r\n\r\n  a newe Bayle be made to thentent them of the clothing of this\r\n  mysterie maie decentlie stand to attend all soch tymes as it shall\r\n  please the Queenes ma{tie} to come through the citie of London.\r\n\r\nThe Bayle was a movable stand or platform; there are various notices as\r\nto the one previously in use, having been out of repair. It was taken\r\nout on all great days of processions or triumphs and on Christmas day\r\nwhen the “lorde maior went to Poules,” and numerous references are also\r\nmade to the Company’s banners which accompanied it.\r\n\r\n  19th January, 1573. Here was Willm̄ Carrington for havinge iiij\r\n  servaunts one Christmas even and ordre was taken that he should laye\r\n  downe his ffyne.\r\n\r\n  15th March, 1573.

A stormy election of Master and Wardens was holden\r\nthis day, and a very precise minute of the proceedings is entered, from\r\nwhich it appears that the Court and Livery being assembled, the Master\r\ndeclared--\r\n\r\n  The occasion of this solempne meeteing & the necessarye succession\r\n  of the Governors & governem{t} of this Corporac͠on. And thereupon a\r\n  ballatting box being sett on the table and the names of the auncient\r\n  M{rs} & Assistants and livery being severally put into the twoe Sells\r\n  of y{t} box, o{r} M{r} according to order did first drawe forth the\r\n  names of theis twelve pˀsons following for Electors viz{t} for the\r\n  Six Surgians M{r} Rich Wateson M{r} Martine Browne M{r} Jo{n} Pinder\r\n  Tho. Tomlinson Edward Arris & Henry Eaton. And for the other six M{r}\r\n  Richard Powell M{r} William Huckle M{r} Jo{n} Davyes M{r} Samuell Die\r\n  Hen. Hodgkinson & Evan Owen. And thereupon the said Electors haveing\r\n  w{th}drawne themselves from the publique Assemblye & taken their\r\n  oathes upon the holye evangelists for the election of fower Masters\r\n  or Governo{rs} for the yeare ensueing, The M{rs} and the rest of the\r\n  Assembly made their repaire to the Church and after Sermon upon their\r\n  returne to the Hall the Masters being called to those 12 Electors\r\n  they were informed that the Election could not proceede and be made,\r\n\r\nby reason that certain of the Electors being of divers trades were\r\nunable to agree upon two persons expert in Barbery, and these Electors\r\nrefusing to choose two Masters Barbers, a Court was at once held and\r\nthe six Barber Electors were discharged, six more Electors being chosen\r\nand called; two of these, however, being contaminated by those already\r\ndismissed, refused to serve, and eventually a fresh set of Electors was\r\nchosen, who retired, and elected Mr. William Clowes, Serjeant-Surgeon\r\nto the King, as Master, and three others Wardens, “and after dinner\r\nended and the Seremonye pˀformed by the Masters or Governo{rs} of\r\nchooseing the new M{rs} or Governo{rs} with silver Garlands in the\r\npublique Hall,” the new Master and Wardens were sworn in.\r\n\r\n8th November, 1638. A great feud having arisen between the Court and\r\nRichard Morrice, an Assistant, a suit was prosecuted against Morrice\r\nin the Earl Marshal’s Court, when the sentence pronounced against him\r\nwas that he should attend the Court at the Hall, and there bareheaded\r\nrehearse in an audible voice an abject apology, the exact words of\r\nwhich are set out. This Morrice did, and the Master and Wardens having\r\ntestified the same, he was again called into Court, when it would seem\r\nthat his apology had been made under fear of the Earl Marshal and\r\nnot of his free will, for the Court calling upon him to make answer\r\n“for his contentious carriage & foule & bitter languages & invective\r\nspeeches by him given from Court to Court ag{t} divers Assistantꝭ to\r\nthe generall disturbance of their Courtꝭ he refused to cleare himselfe\r\nor to give answeare,” whereupon the Court dismissed him from his place\r\nas an Assistant.\r\n\r\n  13th September, 1640.

A dispute between Edward Molins and one Coppinger\r\nwas heard by the Court, when the decision was against Molins, and he\r\nwas fined for using bad language.\r\n\r\n  12th January, 1641. Edward Molins came into the Court and stood in\r\n  the face of the Court with his Hatt on his head and his Armes on his\r\n  side and told the Court he would doe noe obedience to the co{te} and\r\n  swore Gods wounds he would submitt to noe man liveing.\r\n\r\n15th January, 1641. Molins was fined 40{s} for this contempt.\r\n\r\n  18th January, 1641.

Mr. George Dunn hath given 5{li} to buy Bookes\r\n  for the Library which is by this Court ordered to be performed\r\n  accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere having been many quarrels in the Court, and various members\r\nexpelled, a general shaking of hands appears to have taken place, for\r\nwe read:--\r\n\r\n  30th July, 1644. This Court doth thinke fitt and soe order That\r\n  a Sermon be made on the next Election day of thankes giveing to\r\n  Almighty God for peace and amity which is now begun to be restored\r\n  among the members of the Company And that M{r} Sharpe be desired to\r\n  performe the same.\r\n\r\n  9th March, 1645.

Mr. William Kings this day freely gave for the\r\n  Ornament of this House a great Tortershell Whereon at his owne charge\r\n  he hath given order for the Companyes Armes to be painted.\r\n\r\nThis shell is preserved at the Hall.\r\n\r\n  7th January, 1646. M{r} Michaell Markeland appeareing to this Court\r\n  at the request of our M{r} he was here complayned of to have embalmed\r\n  severall humane Bodyes within this City against the Ordinance of this\r\n  Company in that behalf being an Apothecary and not a Surgeon approved\r\n  according to Law Nor a ffreeman of this Company which M{r} Markeland\r\n  acknowledged But alleadged It was through his ignorance Not knowing\r\n  that the right thereof was in approved Surgeons and ffreemen of this\r\n  Company only and none other And being now well satisfyed thereof\r\n  haveing heard the said Ordinance read unto him promised not to doe\r\n  the like againe.\r\n\r\n  2nd June, 1646. This daye Mr. Lawrence Loe Chirurgeon a Member of\r\n  this Company through his good affection thereunto Did for the worship\r\n  thereof freely offer to give for the beautifying of the Hall soe\r\n  many stones of black and white Marble as shalbe sufficient for the\r\n  Pavement thereof.\r\n\r\nThese marbles were laid to form the floor at the upper end of the Hall,\r\nand when the Hall was pulled down they were preserved and now form the\r\npavement in the Entrance to the Hall from Monkwell Street.\r\n\r\nThere is a Memorandum that Mr. John Bancks by his will left--\r\n\r\n  To the Company of Barber Chirurgions London so long as they shall\r\n  performe the uses hereafter limitted (or els not) To be paid them\r\n  betwixt the first and seaventh day of May next after the decease\r\n  of the said John Banckes and so yearely for ever the sum̃e of\r\n  Twenty shillings w{ch} Twenty shillings shalbe by the said Company\r\n  distributed in forme following viz{t} To Twelve poore householders or\r\n  widowes of the same Company To each of them ffower poundꝭ weight of\r\n  good beefe Two penny loaves of good sweet bread Two pence a peece in\r\n  mony and each of them one Woodden platter.\r\n\r\n  14th December, 1646.

John Franck (the son of a Liveryman)\r\nwas doubtless a “foreign brother,” and entitled to his freedom by\r\npatrimony upon payment of the fine, which the Court now ordered to be\r\ndispensed with if he wished to take up his freedom. Being a Sea Surgeon\r\nonly, it was not necessary that he should be free of the Company. He\r\nhad probably been in slavery 18 years!\r\n\r\nSeveral entries similar to the following are to be found in the books.\r\n\r\n  9th August, 1647. Upon the humble suite of Thomas Tomlinson an\r\n  ancient Member of this Company and of the Livery now fallen into\r\n  greate Poverty and Want for some charitable releife from this\r\n  Company. This Court being moved in Compassion to his deplorable\r\n  Condic͠on and calling to mind his former good service to this Company\r\n  Doth freely give him 10{li.} out of the Stock of this House.\r\n\r\n  14th September, 1648.

M{r} Warden Madocks and certaine others of\r\n  the Assistants here present desireing to peruse our Charter for\r\n  theire informac͠on the better to enable them for the Governement of\r\n  this Company had a sight thereof and were well satisfyed in every\r\n  particuler.\r\n\r\n13th August, 1655. Mr. John Gale of Bushey (son of William Gale, M.\r\n1595) a Surgeon of this Company, by his Will of this date left to the\r\nBarber-Surgeons £16 per annum, payable out of certain houses on Snow\r\nhill, in the parish of Saint Sepulchre, for the founding of an Anatomy\r\nlecture in the name of Gale’s Anatomy. This trust was transferred to\r\nthe Surgeons’ Company in 1745.\r\n\r\nOur Minute Books from the year _1651 to 1689_ are unhappily lost;\r\nthey are known to have been at the Hall as recently as 1832. Should\r\nany reader ever light upon them, he is particularly entreated to\r\ncommunicate with the Clerk of the Company or with the author.\r\n\r\n1689. The practice was now adopted of entering all admissions to the\r\nfreedom, etc., in the Court Minute Books (as well as in the Register)\r\nthe forms being as follows:--\r\n\r\n3rd September, 1689. For an apprentice:\r\n\r\n  Johẽs Rawson app̃r Caroli Peters admĩs est ex Rẽl Magr̃i & Jur̃.\r\n\r\nfor a freeman by patrimony:\r\n\r\n  Ptrũs Hartley Stac͠oner filˀ Thome Hartley Civis & Barbitonsorˀ &\r\n  Chirurgˀ London admĩs est pˀ patrimõn ex Rẽl Isaacii Boddington\r\n  Weaver & Wil̃l̃i Bletsoe Grocer, Wil̃l̃i Bateman Barbitonsorˀ &\r\n  Chirurgorˀ London & Jur̃.\r\n\r\nfor a freeman by redemption:\r\n\r\n  Henr̃ Chamberlane admĩs est pˀ redemc͠on vˀtute orᵭem Curˀ Majorˀ &\r\n  Alᵭrn Dat xviij{o} die Augusti 1689 & Jur̃.\r\n\r\n  17th January, 1690. This day an order was sealed to presse 40\r\n  Surgeons mates for the Kings service in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt this period all freemen on their admission “took the oathes\r\nmenc͠oned in a late Act of Parliament & subscribed the Declarac͠on\r\ntherein named”: these were the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy as\r\nrequired by the “Bill of Rights” (passed December, 1689).\r\n\r\n  2nd July, 1690. Ordered that the Clarke keep an accompt of all pˀsons\r\n  faleing at a Court of Assistants and that every one faileing for\r\n  every such time soe doeing shall forfeit v{s} & shall not be admitted\r\n  to binde or make ffree untill he or they have made payment of the\r\n  same of which they are to have notice except S{r} John Letheullier\r\n  S{r} Humfry Edwin & M{r} Thomas Canham.\r\n\r\n  29th April, 1693. Ordered that the 2 Chirurgeons Governo{rs} & whome\r\n  they shall thincke fitting to call to them Attend the Archbishopp of\r\n  Canterbury conserning his Barber practiceing Chirurgery.\r\n\r\n  20th July, 1693. Ord{d} that a lease bee taken of the Archbishopp for\r\n  one & twenty yeare from the 19{th} day of July 1693 for the Barge\r\n  house[166] & that as the Governo{rs} have agreed a ffine of the same\r\n  they pay to his Grace the sume of one hundred pounds besides ffees.\r\n\r\n  [166] At Lambeth.\r\n\r\n  3rd October, 1693. Ordered that the Bargeman have a new coate &\r\n  britches &c.\r\n\r\n  19th July, 1694. Ordered that M{r} George Minikin bee warned before\r\n  the Lord Major to shew cause why he doe not attend the Court of\r\n  Assistants as he hath been chosen one of them.\r\n\r\n18th June, 1696. A new sun dial was ordered to be put up.\r\n\r\nAbout this period there seems to have been a general disinclination\r\nto serve as an Assistant, many of the Livery being fined £10 for\r\nrefusing to serve the office, while some who had sat as Assistants were\r\ndismissed the Court for non-attendance.\r\n\r\n  25th October, 1697. Ordered that the Barge house bee mended & M{r}\r\n  Warden Pinke take care to see it done.\r\n\r\n  18th August, 1698.

Ordered that the ill manadgement of the late\r\n  Master M{r} Tho: Lichfeild as to his office of Master and his other\r\n  offices of Warden bee pˀsented to the next Court of Assistants in\r\n  order to bee expelˀd the sˀd Court it being the opinion of this\r\n  Comittee that he deserves soe to bee as alsoe for being any longer\r\n  an examin{r} he haveing acted contrary to the establish{mt} of the\r\n  Corporac͠on in the s{d} offices.\r\n\r\n8th November, 1700. A Committee of the Court having waited upon the\r\nCommissioners of the Navy and reported that Mr. Lichfeild had committed\r\nirregularities in certifying men as qualified Surgeons for sea service,\r\nsuch men not being duly qualified, the Court adjudged him to be\r\ndismissed from his office of an Examiner in Surgery, and out of the\r\nCourt of Assistants.\r\n\r\n10th March, 1707. The new Clerk, Mr. Chas. Bernard, seems to have\r\nbeen industrious in searching out practising Barbers not free of the\r\nCompany, as also others who had committed abuses; several were fined\r\nand compelled to take up their freedom and this day the following\r\nentries occur:--\r\n\r\n  Clyett being sum̃oned for Shaveing on Sunday last appeared before the\r\n  Comittee and the fact being plainly proved against him the Comittee\r\n  fined him ten shillings for his said offence.\r\n\r\n  Newland being sum̃oned for the like offence appeared also before\r\n  the Comittee but there being no possitive proofe against him he was\r\n  dismissed.\r\n\r\n  John Gould a Dutchman being sum̃oned for keeping a Shopp and\r\n  exercising the trade of a Barber not being free of this Company And\r\n  the matter being plainly proved against him the Comittee ordered him\r\n  to be prosecuted on the statutes of the 32nd of Hen 8{th} and the\r\n  5{th} of Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that a Second Sum̃ons be sent to all such Defaulters as have\r\n  not appeared with intimation that theire ffines will be levied on\r\n  them by distresse.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that Thomas Latham be sum̃oned to take upp his ffreedome &\r\n  that all other persons exerciseing Barbery not being ffree of this\r\n  Company be sum̃oned.\r\n\r\n17th March, 1707. Nineteen delinquents who had been summoned appeared,\r\nand their cases were heard; a few examples will suffice--One Darby was\r\n“seen to comb a persons haire on Sunday morning last but alleadging\r\nthat it was his ffather,” he was let off with 5_s._ fine.\r\n\r\nLewis Roger made answer that it “was onely his Apprentice combing a\r\npersons haire without his knowledge and that it was his first offence,”\r\nhe likewise escaped with a 5_s._ fine.\r\n\r\nJames Good was more fortunate, for proving that his offence “was onely\r\nthe Combing of a Lodgers Wigg,” he escaped.\r\n\r\nWillm. Haslegrove appears to have filled up the measure of his\r\niniquity, for being detected in “actually shaveing a person on Sunday\r\nmorning,” he was fined 10_s._\r\n\r\nSamuel Beaumont, charged with keeping two Barbers’ shops, had a month\r\ngiven him to part with one of them, and John Shoard who, not being free\r\nof the Company, kept a Barber’s shop in Cloth Fair, was ordered to quit\r\nthe same within two months.\r\n\r\n  31st March, 1707. Elizabeth Presbury being sumoned appeared &\r\n  alleadged that she was very poore & that her husband was an Idle man\r\n  and promised to reforme her method whereupon the Comittee excused her.\r\n\r\nThe number of Barbers fined for working on Sundays, or for keeping shop\r\nnot being free, was enormous, and it becomes wearying to travel through\r\nthe records of their offences and fines.\r\n\r\n  17th June, 1708. Ordered that the Company’s Barge house and the\r\n  Dwelling house thereunto belonging be forthwith repaired.\r\n\r\n13th January, 1709. Sir Edward Northey was appointed standing counsel\r\nto the Company with a yearly retainer of two guineas.\r\n\r\n  15th April, 1709. Upon complaint made against one Henry Drudge for\r\n  exerciseing Barbery & Surgery w{th}in the City not being ffree he\r\n  attended and alleadged that he haveing been a Soldier in the late\r\n  Warr thought himself intituled to keep his Shoppe without takeing\r\n  up his ffreedome, by Virtue of the Act of Parliament made upon the\r\n  disbanding the Army which gives liberty to disbanded soldiers to\r\n  exercise any trade within the Corporations or places where they were\r\n  borne, althoˀ they had not served seven years to it But the Court\r\n  believing that act did not extend to Drudge by reason he was not\r\n  borne in London, ordered that in case he did not shut up his Shop in\r\n  a month’s time he should be prosecuted.\r\n\r\n21st July, 1709. In consequence of the great expense to which the\r\nCompany had been put in the repairs to the Hall, the Court determined\r\nto call thirty-one freemen into the Livery, and the fine being £10 each\r\non admission or £20 on refusal, a considerable sum was realized.\r\n\r\nIt having been suggested to the Court that the yeomanry objected to\r\npay 20_s._ for “corn money” when called to the Livery, the Clerk was\r\ndirected to enquire into the origin of that tax, and finding that it\r\nhad been originally levied on each member taking his livery, to satisfy\r\nthe precepts made in 1633, and afterwards for providing a stock of\r\ncorn for the City; and for that at the present time the Company had no\r\nGranary or stock of corn to provide, and “being out of debt,” it was\r\nordered that in future this fine should be discontinued.\r\n\r\n18th August, 1709. At the Election, ten of the Livery who had attended\r\nwithout their gowns, were severally fined and paid 1_s._ each, and\r\nthere are other references to Assistants being fined for not appearing\r\nin their gowns.\r\n\r\n  4th October, 1709. A complaint being made against Richard Stockwell\r\n  for being copartner with a fforreigner & the fact being made appeare\r\n  pritty plain against him the Court fined him five pounds being the\r\n  penalty imposed by the By Law, But upon his promise to discharge his\r\n  said partner the Court were pleased to remitt his ffine.\r\n\r\n  18th April, 1710. M{r} John Booth a Surgeon at Warrington in\r\n  Lancashire applying to this Court to be admitted a fforeign brother\r\n  & he being examined in Surgery & approved It was ordered that upon\r\n  his payment of ten Guineas he should be admitted a fforeign brother\r\n  of this Company, But the said M{r} Booth refusing to take that part\r\n  of the fforeign brothers oath whereby he was sworne to be true to the\r\n  Queen he was not for that reason admitted.\r\n\r\n  1st June, 1710. It is ordered that the Members present at this Court\r\n  shall be excused from wearing their gowns in regard to the heat of\r\n  the weather.\r\n\r\n  20th October, 1710. It is ordered for the accomodation of the Members\r\n  of this Court of the Barbers side for the seeing & being heard at\r\n  Courts of Assistants That for the future at all Courts of Assistants\r\n  the Governo{rs} on the Surgeons side shall set even with the Ma{r}\r\n  next on his right hand & the Governo{rs} on the Barbers side next\r\n  on his left. But that at all other Courts all the Governo{rs} shall\r\n  according to their seniority sett along the side of the Parlour Table\r\n  on the left hand of the Master in such maner as has been accustomed.\r\n\r\n11th January, 1711.

The Court further\r\ndecided to oppose, by every means in its power, the movement set on\r\nfoot by Mr. Berney and his friends.\r\n\r\n24th June, 1722. The lease of the Barge-house at Lambeth expiring in\r\nApril, 1723, and the Archbishop having offered to renew the same for\r\n21 years at £10 per annum and £100 fine, it was resolved not to renew\r\nit, in consequence of its being an unprofitable property, and the\r\nCompany not then having a barge.

The Surgeons are now separated from the Barbers.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1745. The Clerk reporting that many of the Company, as well\r\nas Surgeons lately free of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, were greatly\r\nin arrear in their quarterage, he was ordered to acquaint them that\r\nunless the said arrears were paid up forthwith, they would be sued.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1745. The Company of Surgeons sent to the Company of\r\nBarbers two documents under their Common Seal, the one authorising\r\nMr. Joseph Cruttenden to peruse and copy any Charters or documents in\r\nthe possession of the Barbers, and the other empowering him to take\r\npossession of any books, papers or writings relating to Surgeons or\r\nSurgery only, on behalf of the Company of Surgeons; whereupon the Court\r\nacceded to the request, and gave instructions as to the same.\r\n\r\n4th December, 1745. Mr. Cruttenden applied on behalf of the Surgeons’\r\nCompany for £510 (the Arrisian endowment) which had been directed to\r\nbe paid by the Act of Parliament, whereupon the Master told him that\r\nby reason of the late fall in the Public Stocks, the Company could\r\nnot without great loss, raise the money, but were ready to give the\r\nSurgeons a proper bond for the same, with Interest.\r\n\r\n19th February, 1746. Forty-one freemen were reported as being fit and\r\nable persons to take the Livery, and were ordered to be summoned for\r\nthe same with the intimation that if any refused he or they would be\r\nsued for the penalty of £20 each upon such refusal.\r\n\r\nOf these, seven appeared at the next Court, took the livery and paid\r\nthe fine of £10; six others begged to be excused. The remaining\r\ntwenty-eight did not appear till later Courts, when some were excused,\r\nand others ordered to be sued; subsequently a large proportion of those\r\nnominated, accepted and paid their fines.\r\n\r\n17th July, 1746. The Surgeons’ Company having pressed for payment of\r\nthe £510 and Interest, and our Company having in Cash but £300, Mr.\r\nLuke Maurice (Master 1732, a Wine Merchant in Lime Street) lent the\r\nCompany £200 at 4-1/2 per cent., and the Clerk advanced the balance,\r\nwhereupon the principal, with £15 17_s._ 0_d._ interest, was paid to\r\nthe Surgeons.\r\n\r\n  18th May, 1747. The Master acquainting the Court that he had employed\r\n  M{r} Whiston the Bookseller to putt the Company’s Library in order\r\n  and to make a Catalogue and valuation thereof And that M{r} Whiston\r\n  had appraised the same at Twenty Guineas And the Clerk acquainting\r\n  the Court that a learned Physican had offered twenty-five Guineas for\r\n  the Library together with the Skeleton and other curiosities formerly\r\n  kept in the Library It was ordered that the Clerk should acquaint the\r\n  Master of the Worshipfull Company of Surgeons with the said offer\r\n  made to this Company And that this Court being desirous to manifest\r\n  their esteem for and preserve the ffriendship of the Surgeons did\r\n  give them the refusal of the said Library Skeleton and Curiosities\r\n  at the said price of Twenty ffive Guineas And that in case of their\r\n  acceptance thereof the rich and ancient Pall belonging to this\r\n  Company should be at their service as a free gift.\r\n\r\n16th July, 1747. The Clerk reported that he had made the above offer\r\nto the Surgeons who replied that they considered themselves entitled\r\nto the Library under the Act of 1745, but that to avoid controversy\r\nwith the Barbers they would be willing to refer the matter to Counsel,\r\nwhereupon it was resolved that the matter should be submitted to the\r\nopinion of Counsel.\r\n\r\n  5th July, 1749. Ordered that the Library of Books formerly belonging\r\n  to the late united Company be forthwith sold for the most money that\r\n  can be gotten for the same.\r\n\r\n  2nd June, 1749.

Ordered that the Clerk do cause a Catalogue to be\r\n  made of the Books in the Library, and that he deliver a copy thereof\r\n  to M{r} Samuel Rutter.\r\n\r\n9th August, 1750. Mr. Gheys, Sculptor, was ordered to have the\r\nSkeleton, in exchange for the Bust of Inigo Jones, still preserved at\r\nthe Hall.\r\n\r\n  3rd September, 1751. Resolved also that the old Pall be given to the\r\n  Beadle.\r\n\r\nThis, alas! was the “rich and ancient pall.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk was again directed to endeavour to sell the Library and it\r\nwas disposed of to Mr. Whiston the Bookseller for £13!!\r\n\r\n  29th October, 1751.

The Agreement between the Company and Mr. Reynolds\r\nwas entered into at £116 15_s._, and the Specification of his work is\r\nrecorded in the Minute Book, from which I extract the following:--\r\n\r\n  The Cupola compleat and properly secured glazed and ornamented\r\n  with Stucco and the Roof covered with Milled lead seven pounds to\r\n  the ffoot with good brass pulley in the middle fit for a Branch or\r\n  Lustre.

The Court having considered the state of the\r\nTheatre, which was out of repair, and for which the Company had no use,\r\nordered advertisements to be inserted twice in three daily papers,\r\nasking for tenders for the materials of the same, and for pulling down\r\nand clearing it away. The “N.B.” to the advertisement states that “The\r\nDoors, Benches and Railes of the said Theatre are of Cedar.”\r\n\r\n1st October, 1754. Three tenders for the materials of the Theatre were\r\nreceived, £21 10_s._ 0_d._, £32 and £35 respectively, and the decision\r\nthereon postponed.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1755. William Shakespear (Barber) the apprentice of\r\nRichard Hulett, was admitted to the freedom.\r\n\r\n5th June, 1764. The Clerk informed the Court of the death of Mrs.\r\nElizabeth I’Ans, widow of Mr. Michael I’Ans, and that the Master and\r\nWardens had, on the 23rd May, received of the Executors of Mr. I’Ans\r\n£2,200--3-1/2 per cent. Bank Annuities, and £75 in accordance with Mr.\r\nI’Ans’ will.\r\n\r\n1764 and 1765. Mr. James Clowes who had been summoned to take up the\r\nLivery, refused to do so, whereupon he was sued for the fine of £20 and\r\njudgment obtained against him with costs.\r\n\r\n14th August, 1766. A Committee having been appointed to examine and\r\nreport upon the Theatre, and having done so, were now authorised to\r\napply to the Court of Common Council for permission to pull down the\r\nsame, and to treat with that Court for the purchase of the ground, for\r\nwhich the Company paid the City £3 per annum under an old lease.\r\n\r\n3rd November, 1767. The City Comptroller having requested the Company\r\nto make an offer for the site of the Theatre, it was resolved that 30\r\nyears’ purchase (£90) be offered for the same.\r\n\r\n7th February, 1769. A plan of the ground leased by the City to the\r\nCompany and on which the Theatre stood, having been prepared by Mr.\r\nGeorge Dance, Clerk of the Works to the City, it was laid before the\r\nCourt, and the City sold the fee simple to the Company for £90. Would\r\nthat one could buy City freeholds at the same rate now!\r\n\r\n2nd September, 1783. Mr. Sylvanus Hall, of Paternoster Row, Carpenter,\r\nproposed to take a lease of the ground on which the Theatre stood,\r\nto take down the whole building, and to erect two dwelling houses on\r\nthe site similar to those he had already built in Monkwell Street.\r\nThe lease to commence at Christmas, 1784, and to be for 61 years at\r\n£10 ground rent. He also proposed to pay the Company £20 for the old\r\nmaterials of the Theatre and to clear the same away. To all these\r\npropositions the Court agreed, and Mr. Hall paid a guinea as earnest\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1785. Mr. Hall having pulled down the Theatre, the Clerk\r\nwas instructed to write to him for the £20 for the old materials which\r\nhe had removed.\r\n\r\n  4th October, 1791. There being a sufficient number of Members present\r\n  to form a Court of Assistants, thoˀ no such Court was called, the\r\n  Master took the sense of the Members present, as an adjournment from\r\n  the last Court of Assistants, whether the Company should go out\r\n  in the usual procession the ensuing Lord Mayor’s day, when on the\r\n  question being put, the same was resolved in the negative.\r\n\r\n  4th November, 1794. M{r} Thomas Holehouse who was on the 1{st} July\r\n  last elected on the Livery of this Company, but had refused to take\r\n  upon him the same, without shewing any cause to the Contrary, and\r\n  against whom an Action had been commenced for the recovery of Twenty\r\n  Pounds the penalty incurred by such his refusal, this day attended\r\n  and paid the said sum of Twenty pounds together with the costs of the\r\n  said Action.\r\n\r\n9th November, 1795. The following Circular was distributed amongst the\r\nLivery at the dinner this day:--\r\n\r\n  The Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Barbers having\r\n  received information that many persons residing within the City of\r\n  London carry on the Trade of a Barber and Hair dresser without being\r\n  free of this Company to the great prejudice of the Members and the\r\n  rights of the Company Do hereby give notice that they have come to a\r\n  resolution to prosecute all persons carrying on the trade of a Barber\r\n  or Hair dresser within the said City not being free of this Company\r\n  and they request the assistance of their Members for that purpose for\r\n  the benefit of the Company and Trade at large; any information to\r\n  their Clerk at the Hall will be duly attended to.\r\n\r\n                             By order of Court,\r\n\r\n                                             EDW{D} GROSE SMITH,\r\n\r\n                                                               Clerk.\r\n\r\n9th November, 1796. The By-Laws of the Company having been found,\r\non the opinion of Mr. Serjeant Adair, insufficient to enforce the\r\npayment of fines for the refusal to serve various offices, a new set\r\nwas drawn up by the Clerk, and submitted to and approved by the Court,\r\nwho ordered the Clerk to get the same confirmed and allowed by the Lord\r\nChancellor and two Chief Justices, but this was never done.\r\n\r\n5th September, 1797. The Mahogany table now in the Court Room was made\r\nabout this time. There is a tradition that the bulb-shaped end of it\r\nwas a portion of the old dissecting table used by the Surgeons. If so,\r\nits latter days are more cheerful than its first.\r\n\r\n1796 to 1799. Several Barbers were prosecuted for exercising their\r\nTrade within the limits of the Company’s Charters and brought to terms,\r\ngenerally they became freemen, and then were compelled to come on to\r\nthe livery; in other cases the barbers removed out the jurisdiction,\r\nand paid the costs.\r\n\r\n18th May, 1802. The Commissioners for the Public Lottery having\r\nadvertised for a place in which to hold the lotteries, the Court\r\ndecided to send in proposals offering the use of the Hall (under\r\ncertain restrictions) for the next three lotteries for Six hundred\r\nguineas, but the offer was not accepted.\r\n\r\n1st August, 1809. A case was submitted to the Attorney General (Sir R.\r\nGibbs) who gave an opinion that the freemen of the Company were exempt\r\nfrom serving on Juries, but not from serving as Constables.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1812. A memorial signed by four freemen of the Company\r\nwas presented to the Court, the purport of which was that the\r\nmemorialists having been summoned to act as Ward Constables had refused\r\nto serve, and that thereupon actions had been brought against them,\r\nwhich, being tried before Lord Ellenborough, the verdicts were against\r\nthem and they were ordered to pay the costs (£333 9_s._ 0_d._). The\r\nmemorialists alleging that they defended the actions for the benefit of\r\nthe Company and really to uphold its privileges, prayed that they might\r\nbe reimbursed the costs, which, however, the Court declined to accede\r\nto, but ordered that £12, which had been paid to the Company for copies\r\nof the Charters, should be refunded.\r\n\r\n1814. The Churchwardens of St. Olave, Silver Street, having assessed\r\nthe Hall at £172, they were requested to attend the next Court which\r\nthey did, and the following delightful method of settling these matters\r\nis recommended to the Authorities nowadays.\r\n\r\n  1st November, 1814. The parish officers of Saint Olave Silver\r\n  Street attended & stated to the Court that the Vestry of that\r\n  Parish had taken the subject of the Poor rate into consideration,\r\n  and considering the great increase of the rate they left it to the\r\n  Company to say what they were agreeable to be rated at; the Court\r\n  proposed to say £100 per annum; the gentlemen (having withdrawn)\r\n  were then called in and informed of such proposal, with which they\r\n  cordially acquiesced.\r\n\r\n  2nd April, 1816. Alexander Rowland the younger [of Macassar oil fame]\r\n  of Kirby Street Hatton Garden, Barber was admitted to the Livery.\r\n\r\n3rd May, 1825. The Livery stand, being in a decayed and useless\r\ncondition, was ordered to be sold.\r\n\r\n2nd May, 1826. But as a purchaser could not be found, the Master\r\noffered to give £5 for it, which was accepted, and this, together with\r\nan additional £5, was ordered to be given to the Committee for the\r\nRelief of Distressed Manufacturers.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1861. Mr. John Atkinson gave £100 consols for the purpose\r\nof distributing the dividends thereof in the purchase of Bibles and\r\nPrayer Books for the poor members of the Company.\r\n\r\n7th February, 1862. Mr. John Atkinson’s Will reciting a munificent\r\nbequest to the Company is set out in the minutes of this date.\r\n\r\n3rd February, 1863. A Statement of the property left by Mr. John\r\nAtkinson is recorded in a letter from the Solicitors to his Trustees\r\ndirected to the Court, and entered in the minutes of this date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTION OF THE MASTER’S SILVER GARLAND (DATE 1629).]\r\n\r\nPRECEDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barbers’ Company is ranked the seventeenth in order of the City\r\nCompanies, and is the fifth after the “Twelve great Companies,”\r\nthe thirteenth being the Dyers, fourteenth Brewers, fifteenth\r\nLeathersellers, sixteenth Pewterers, seventeenth Barbers, eighteenth\r\nCutlers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe question of precedency in former times gave rise to many\r\ncontentions between the City Guilds, and the Barber-Surgeons seem\r\nto have had some experience in these quarrels: the City pageants,\r\nprocessions, and public attendances at church, were numerous in the\r\ndays of the Tudors and Stuarts, and at most of these the Livery\r\nCompanies attended, each guild jealously striving to keep its place,\r\nand no doubt to advance its position whenever opportunity arose.\r\n\r\nThere are extant, lists of the Companies in the City books, in which\r\nour Company takes various positions; and Stow, having incorporated one\r\nof these lists in his Survey, has given it an authority as a table\r\nof precedence which it was never intended to possess; he furnishes a\r\nlist of the Companies attending the Lord Mayor’s feast, 23rd Henry VIII\r\n(1531), and places the Barbers as the thirty-second, whereas at that\r\ntime they were undoubtedly the twenty-eighth.\r\n\r\n1516. The first authentic reference to our Company’s standing is found\r\nin _Letter-Book N._ leaf 5 (January, 1516), where it is ordained that\r\nthe Barbers, although they claimed of their ancient right to be the\r\nseventeenth Company, yet were adjudged to take the twenty-eighth place,\r\nfollowing the Cordwainers, and preceding the Paynter-Stainers.\r\n\r\n1532. This order was probably in force until February, 1532, when the\r\nBarbers got back their old position (_Repertory_ 8, leaf 272) and an\r\nofficer was directed to wait on the Pewterers to “shewe theym that\r\nthe seyd Company of Barbours Surgeons be Restored ageyn to their olde\r\nRowme.” Three months later (May, 1532), the Barbers were “taken down\r\none,” and directed to occupy the eighteenth place.\r\n\r\n1533. In February, 1533 (_Letter-Book O._ _fo._ 213), is a record which\r\nis somewhat puzzling, as, altogether ignoring the orders of February\r\nand May, 1532, it is stated that the Barber-Surgeons had petitioned\r\nto be restored to their old place of seventeenth Company, from which\r\nit is said they were dispossessed about sixteen years back (evidently\r\nalluding to the order of January, 1516), “so that they be nowe the xxix\r\nor xxx{th} Companye yn thordre of such goynges,” etc.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the orders of February and May, 1532, had been disregarded by\r\nthe other guilds, and our Company forcibly ousted from their rightful\r\nposition, so that this is in effect an application for a confirmatory\r\norder, which was granted, and thus they were again fixed as the\r\nseventeenth Company.\r\n\r\n1534. The Barbers must have given some offence to the Civic authorities\r\nin 1534, for in October of that year (_Repertory_ 9, leaf 79) the\r\nlast-named order was repealed, and they were put back again to the\r\ntwenty-eighth place, and further the Company were ordered that they\r\n“shall no more goo yn pˀcessyons, standyngꝭ, Rydyngꝭ, goyngꝭ, and other\r\nassembles from hensfurth, tyll it be otherwyse ordered by thys coˀrte.”\r\n\r\n1535. This vacillation on the part of the Court of Aldermen in settling\r\nour position, was not yet at an end, for in March, 1535, we were again\r\nplaced seventeenth, to come before the Cutlers and after the Pewterers,\r\nand this order was confirmed no less than four times in 1535, and twice\r\nin 1536.\r\n\r\n1604. At a Royal Procession on the 15th March, 1604, our Company got\r\nmisplaced by some of the Marshals, and this led to another application\r\nto the Court of Aldermen, whereupon a peremptory order was made that\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons should stand sixteenth in precedence. This order\r\nis set out in full elsewhere (see page 195); the sixteenth place\r\nwas then accorded to us in consequence of the Stockfishmongers, who\r\nformerly held the twelfth place, having been dissolved, whereby the\r\nBarber-Surgeons went up one: the Clothworkers who, at that time were\r\nthe thirteenth Company, then became the twelfth.\r\n\r\nSome short time afterwards, the Dyers, who had been the eighteenth\r\nCompany, got the thirteenth place, and we reverted to our old position\r\nof seventeenth Company in which we still continue.\r\n\r\n1606. An attempt to misplace us was made in July, 1606, but this was\r\nsuccessfully resisted. (See p. 116.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCOURT OF ASSISTANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the governing body of the Company has grown up in\r\nthe course of time from one Prime Master or Ruler to a Master with\r\nthree Wardens and twenty Assistants, forming a Court of twenty-four\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nWe gather from the earliest records, that the business of the Company\r\nwas then transacted by the meeting together in Common Hall, of the\r\nwhole fraternity (which probably included both freemen and liverymen),\r\nunder the presidency of a single Master, who, as in the case of Richard\r\nle Barber in 1308, was invested with the supervision of the craft, and\r\npower to make search and scrutiny, and to punish offenders.\r\n\r\nIn 1376 two Masters were appointed to rule the craft, while in 1388 we\r\nfind that two Masters and two “Surveyors” formed the governing body.\r\n\r\nIn 1416 is recorded the admission of five Masters, three of whom are\r\ndescribed as “Barbitonsores” (_i.e._, Barbers proper) and two as\r\n“Masters of the Barbers exercising the faculty of Surgery.” In 1428\r\nthere were four Masters, two of each class, and this number was the\r\ngoverning body at the time of Edward IV’s Charter of Incorporation, in\r\n1462.\r\n\r\nAs has been elsewhere remarked, this Charter provides for the\r\nappointment of two Masters only, and they to be skilled in Surgery,\r\nto be chosen by twelve Electors taken from the Commonalty; but as our\r\nrecords preserve the names of four Masters elected in that year, and\r\nso on ever since in unbroken succession, there cannot be any doubt\r\nbut that (the Charter dealing almost entirely with the regulation of\r\nmatters surgical) the two Masters of the “Barbers side” were left to be\r\nelected in accordance with old custom, or under the By-laws which the\r\nCompany were, by their Charter, empowered to make.\r\n\r\nAt what period a Court of Assistants was created in our Company is\r\nunknown, but I am inclined to think the date is about 1480 to 1500.\r\nThe four “Masters or Governors” (answering to our “Master and three\r\nWardens”) were chosen out of the Commonalty by twelve electors yearly,\r\nand do not, as seems by the lists preserved, appear to have gone up\r\nannually by seniority as now they do, _i.e._, from third Warden to\r\nsecond, and so on. Those who had served as second, third, or fourth\r\nGovernors, if not chosen to higher office the next year, as a general\r\nrule took their places again as simple liverymen; whilst those who\r\nhad served as Prime or Chief Governor were, at the expiry of their\r\nterm of office, designated “Ancient Masters,” and these, with some\r\npast Wardens, having become qualified by experience in the affairs of\r\nthe Company would naturally be consulted by the ruling Governors who\r\nsought their “assistance” and advice, and thus grow up into a Court\r\nof Assistants[168] (nearly always in early time spelt “Assistance”)\r\nand be recognised to a great extent as a power in the direction of the\r\nCompany’s business.\r\n\r\n[168] This theory is confirmed by the Ordinances made in 1566, whereby\r\nit was enacted that a liveryman _might_ be chosen an Assistant without\r\nhaving ever served the office of Governor.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of Assistants is in the By-laws settled by Sir\r\nThomas More in 1530, though throughout these By-laws the actual ruling\r\npower was evidently in the four Masters or Governors. The Assistants\r\nare here twice referred to, in one case where it is enacted that the\r\nMasters shall not admit a “fforen” to the freedom without the assent of\r\nthe “xxiiij{ti} assistentes,” and in another place they are to have,\r\nwith the Masters, the election of the Livery.\r\n\r\nThe Act 32 Henry VIII is silent as to Assistants, vesting all power\r\nin the Masters or Governors. In 1557 at one of the Courts twenty-one\r\nAssistants and four Masters attended, and at a Court held 19th July,\r\n1595, the names of twenty-five Assistants are recorded. The number\r\nseems to have varied with the times, the full Court, however, never\r\nexceeding four Masters and thirty-two Assistants. The Assistants have\r\nalways been elected by the Court, and the custom became in time to\r\nchoose the senior liveryman whenever a vacancy occurred, though there\r\ndoes not appear to have been at any time a by-law to that effect, and\r\nindeed this practice has been departed from on very many occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Election of Masters prior to the year 1633 was on the Monday next\r\nbefore the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle (Aug. 24); from 1633 to\r\n1745 it was held on the third Thursday in August, and since 1745 it has\r\nbeen held on the second Thursday in August.\r\n\r\nThe ancient practice was for the whole body of the livery to be\r\nsummoned to the Hall in their livery gowns, hoods and caps on the\r\nMonday at 8 o’clock in the morning “at the furthest” to whom the\r\nMasters, sitting in Court, declared the cause of their assembling;\r\nthis done, the Masters retired, and the livery, sitting there, chose\r\ntwelve of their number to be “Electors,” of whom six were to be “expert\r\nSurgeons,” and four at least must never have served the office of\r\nMaster or Governor. The Clerk then called the twelve Electors out (the\r\nrest of the livery remaining in the Hall). The Masters then delivered\r\nto the Electors the “Bills of Election,” each Master nominating two\r\nBarbers and two Surgeons, so that sixteen in all were nominated, and,\r\nafter administering to them the oath prescribed, the Electors retired\r\nto a private room apart to make their choice. Should the Electors deem\r\nthat one or more of themselves ought to have been put in nomination,\r\nthey were to send for the Masters who were bound to withdraw such\r\nperson or persons, and choose others in their place. The Bills were to\r\nbe made out in accordance with seniority, but the Electors were not\r\nbound to choose by seniority. Having made their choice, the Electors\r\nsent for the Masters and delivered to them a Bill with the names of the\r\nfour persons selected, and these names were (under a heavy penalty) to\r\nbe kept secret until after the “dener.”\r\n\r\nThe whole Company then proceeded in state to the Church of St. Olave,\r\nSilver Street (after the Great Fire to St. Alban, Wood Street), maids\r\nstrewing the way with flowers. At Church there was a “goodly masse”\r\ncelebrated, and in later times a “devyne sˀrvice,” which, being ended,\r\nthe parson and some of the church officials had customary fees and\r\nreturned with the Company to the Hall to celebrate the Election dinner.\r\nThe feast over, the outgoing Masters, according to “auncient order,”\r\nwalked about the table, each bearing a garland and placing it on the\r\nhead of the member who had been chosen to fill his place in the year\r\nensuing. If anyone elected happened to be absent, his garland was\r\nplaced on the head of one of the Ancient Masters as proxy, and the\r\nnewly-elected Masters were sworn on the Holy Evangelists to the due\r\nexecution of their offices, absentees being sworn at the next Court.\r\n\r\nThe Election dinners were held at any early hour in the afternoon (1\r\nor 2 p.m.) and were generally followed by a play or a dance, sometimes\r\nboth; the wives of the livery and Assistants were present at the\r\ndinner, and the latter had their apprentices in attendance waiting at\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIn 1633 the mode of choosing the Electors was varied as follows: a\r\n“fair ballating box” with two cells therein, one labelled “Surgeons”\r\nand the other “Barbers” was placed upon the table,\r\n\r\n    Into _each_ cell the Master put the names of\r\n    two Ancient Masters, and drew one out of each       2\r\n\r\n    The second and third Governors put into _each_\r\n    cell the names of six Assistants, and the Master\r\n    drew three out of each                              6\r\n\r\n    The fourth Governor put into _each_ cell the\r\n    names of four liverymen and the Master drew\r\n    two out of each                                     4\r\n                                                       --\r\n                                                       12\r\n                                                       ==\r\n\r\nThe twelve so drawn constituted the Electors, and the proceedings were\r\nthen much the same as has been before described.\r\n\r\nThe new Masters or Governors commenced their duties immediately upon\r\nbeing sworn.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period the custom has been to hold the monthly and\r\nordinary Courts on Tuesdays, but the meetings do not seem to have\r\ntaken place on any definite or fixed days, numerous Courts being\r\nheld at irregular intervals and frequently on Mondays. “Courts of\r\nAssistants,” as distinguished from Monthly and special Courts, were,\r\nin early times, for some reason or other, particularly prohibited from\r\nbeing held on Tuesdays, there being several orders and by-laws to this\r\neffect, but why, I do not know.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1557 twenty Courts were held. In 1572 forty-one Courts,\r\nthe average attendance at which was twelve. In 1599 forty-six Courts\r\nassembled. At the intermediate Courts a great deal of important as\r\nwell as minor business was transacted, including the admissions and\r\npresentations of freemen and apprentices, the examination of Surgeons\r\nand Sea Surgeons, and a great variety of business connected with the\r\nmedical service of the army and navy.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the separation in 1745, the office of Master was supposed\r\nto be, and generally was, held by a Barber and a Surgeon alternately,\r\nthe Wardens being chosen in like manner, any member not practising as\r\na Surgeon being accounted a Barber, whatever his trade or occupation\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nGreat importance has at all times been attached to the question of\r\nprecedence in sitting at table and in speaking in Court, and many have\r\nbeen the rules enacted, and the disputes and jealousies which have\r\narisen between members of the Court on this question.\r\n\r\nSome of the powers executed by the Masters of old and by the Court\r\nof Assistants in later times have been those which now are peculiar\r\nto Courts of Law, _e.g._, the settlement of disputes upon every\r\nconceivable question, the imposition of fines, and their recovery by\r\ndistress levied by the Beadle, the summary committal of offenders to\r\ngaol, and the issuing of orders for their release, the prohibition of\r\nactions and suits at common law (if commenced by a freeman without\r\nleave of the Court), the inhibition of members from practising their\r\nprofession, and the infliction of corporal punishment upon unruly\r\nfreemen and apprentices.\r\n\r\nThe Court as now existing, consists of four Masters or Governors and\r\ntwenty Assistants, appointed under the provisions of the Act 18 George\r\nII, cap. xv. By this Act the election of the Masters or Governors is\r\nin the Court and takes place on the second Thursday in August, but\r\nalas! without the ancient ceremonies of attending Church, crowning with\r\ngarlands, and--may I add?--the Election dinner for the Livery.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen elsewhere, there have been frequent disturbances at\r\nthe Courts, and there are numerous entries of Assistants, Wardens, and\r\nPast Masters having been expelled the Court and sometimes dismissed\r\nfrom the Livery as well, for their misconduct or quarrelsome behaviour.\r\nInstances of impertinence and abuse by freemen and liverymen before the\r\nCourt, are also by no means rare, and in these cases condign punishment\r\nby imprisonment or fine was invariably meted out.\r\n\r\n  9th March, 1624. This daye Mr. Warden Thornebury made knowne to this\r\n  Court y{t} one Tanner, a brother of this Companie, hath abused him\r\n  in words. Whereupon it is ordered by this Court that John Bayard\r\n  the officer belonging to this Companie shall laye the Lord Maio{rs}\r\n  comaund on the said Tanner and comitte him to one of the Compters\r\n  of this Cittye And that imediately upon the said comittm{t} shall\r\n  acquaint the M{rs} therewith That thereupon the M{rs} maye acquaint\r\n  the lo: Maio{r} with the reson of his comittem{t.}\r\n\r\n  19th January, 1626. This daye the letter directed to the Maister\r\n  Wards and Assistants of the Companie of Barbor Surgions of London\r\n  from M{r} William Clowes Sarjeant Chirurgion to his Ma{tie} was\r\n  here in Courte reade in hec verba viz{t} Right worthie Maister and\r\n  Governors and assistants of the companie of Barbers and Surgions\r\n  in my true love I wish all health and florishinge goverment of\r\n  yo{r} Company to the glory of God the honor of the Kinge and the\r\n  good of Gods people Amen. Now whereas I have bin not only by many\r\n  Brothers advertised but also of yo{r} Officer legally by letter and\r\n  otherwise given to understand that you had chosen me Renter warden\r\n  of the company from the w{ch} Election I desired by M{r} Cooper and\r\n  M{r} Thomas Allen I might be freed yett could not, I then knewe\r\n  well that in duty I owed you an aunswer which might well be seeme\r\n  my reverent respect to yo{r} Authoritye; and my tender regard of\r\n  the kinge my M{rs} honor which in yo{r} Chusinge and my acceptinge\r\n  maye be considered, which as much as in me is I desired to doe, And\r\n  nowe, not once questoninge the troblesomnes of the place, nor other\r\n  hinderances w{ch} god Almighty did then send I thus aunswer (because\r\n  I wilbe free of Ambition or pride) that if you can make that appeere\r\n  upon yo{r} Records that any of my predecessors did beare the office\r\n  of Wardein after he was sworne Serjeant Surgion to any of the Kˀs or\r\n  Queenes of England I shall humbly serve it, if not, I Crave yo{r}\r\n  pˀdon for I might not soe poorely value the Kinge my M{r} as thinke\r\n  him less mighty, less absolute a Prince then any Kinge whatsoever\r\n  hath raigned before him, and so as his Servaunt I expect from the\r\n  Company as good respect as any Sergeant Surgion heretofore hath had,\r\n  for my M{rs} honor I will not give to any other, And further because\r\n  I am many tymes summoned to yo{r} Courts and other meetings, w{ch}\r\n  service I am very willinge to performe, when I shall knowe my place\r\n  in the Company, which I must leave to yo{r} grave considerac͠on, only\r\n  if you please to take notice how the Colledge of Phisitions and the\r\n  Company of Apothecaryes of London have rancked the Kingꝭ Phisitions\r\n  and Apothecaryes, you may thereby guess what place I expect, but\r\n  howsoever if by the occasion of back freinds wee may not so well\r\n  agree as I desire, so as I may personally absent my selfe from the\r\n  Company yett thus much I ingenuously and religiously profess that I\r\n  will alwayes in harty love be present and ready press either by the\r\n  Kinge my M{r} or any other wayes to doe the Companye any loveing\r\n  Service I may, And so ceasing further troubling you but desireing to\r\n  heare of yo{r} smoothe acceptance, I rest.\r\n\r\n  Whereas he was chosen renter warden of this Companie for this yere\r\n  ensueing w{ch} place by reason of this contagious tyme and other\r\n  respects he is not able to execute, It is thereupon ordered by this\r\n  courte that he shalbe discharged from the said place of youngest\r\n  warden and second warden of this Company, And it is further ordered\r\n  that he shall take place next unto the youngest of our assistants\r\n  that have served the place of upper warden and when he shall have\r\n  served the place of upper warden of this Companye then he to take his\r\n  precedencye and ranck according to that service.\r\n\r\n21st August, 1626. Serjeant Clowes was elected Master, but it seems his\r\nelection was called in question, as it was the turn for a Barber this\r\nyear, and it was moved that the electors should be fined for breach of\r\nthe ordinance in choosing a Surgeon, but the Court decided not to do\r\nso. There was evidently a dislike to Mr. Clowes on the part of some of\r\nthe Company, as the Wardens of the Yeomanry were on the 20th September,\r\nfined 40_s._ for refusing, or neglecting to carry the Standing Cups\r\nbefore him and the Wardens of the Livery on the Election day.\r\n\r\n1638. Serjeant Clowes was again elected Master.\r\n\r\n  9th April, 1641. M{r} Warden Martin Browne made his complaint against\r\n  M{r} Serjeant Clowes and he did freely declare that he did forgive\r\n  the Serjeant his personall Wrong, and did referr the Wrong due to the\r\n  Court unto the Court, And this Court did order that M{r} Serjeant\r\n  Clowes shall acknowledge that in his anger and passion he did speake\r\n  some words to the wrong of this Court, and this being done this Order\r\n  to be annihilated.\r\n\r\n  22nd September, 1642. Alsoe for the more peaceable treaty and\r\n  discussing matters in times of Courts of Assistants It is ordered\r\n  That decency be held in these Courts proceedings and that every one\r\n  of the Assistants as he is in his turne and time of Delivery to\r\n  yeild his voyce shall not use any impertinent speeches or divert\r\n  the matter in question into some other busines but give his answer\r\n  freely to the present matter proponed and that during the time of his\r\n  delivery of his speech or opinion none other of the Assistants shall\r\n  give crosse or thwarting speeches or calumniate that Assistant And\r\n  if any Assistant shalbe soe Uncivill That then the present M{r} or\r\n  Governour shall cause him to be silent and shall put such Assistants\r\n  Interrupc͠on of speech to question concerneing his ffine for evill\r\n  behaviour and such Interruptor being found faulty shall pay the ffine\r\n  of vj{s} viij{d} according to the Ordinance in that behalfe made.\r\n\r\n  3rd October, 1642.

Whereas by Order of the Honourable house of Comõns\r\n  assembled in Parliament of the 28{th} June last the President of the\r\n  Colledge of Physicians was appointed to call this Company before them\r\n  and to tender the Covenaunt by them This Court conceiveing their\r\n  Priviledges to be thereby infringed this Co{rt} the M{r} doe advise\r\n  with Councell Doth order that a Petic͠on be framed to be preferred\r\n  by all the Assistants that are now present or the major part, to the\r\n  House of Comõns to have the tendring of the Covenñt themselves to\r\n  theire owne Members and the Charge to be allowed out of the Comõn\r\n  stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONALTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe admission to membership in the Company has ever been by servitude,\r\npatrimony, or redemption, and the fines and fees payable have varied\r\nso much at different periods in our history, and have frequently\r\nbeen so capricious, that no attempt has been made to tabulate them,\r\nthough references will be made here and there to the prevailing fees\r\nof the period. The fees for apprentices have always been of a nominal\r\ndescription, and generally so of freemen, though, in olden time,\r\nthe Court, as became the Masters of the mystery of “bleeding,” not\r\nunfrequently bled a new member by a substantial fine on admission, but\r\nalso put him to the expense of a dinner into the bargain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The initial letter T is reduced from one in the Audit Book\r\n1614-15.]\r\n\r\nAn ample fine, suited to the period, has always been taken from\r\nthe Liverymen who were, in the days of the Tudors and Stuarts a\r\ncomparatively small section of the Company, and rarely exceeded fifty\r\nin number; they were always chosen from the more substantial of the\r\nYeomanry, and if on election they refused “to take the clothing,”\r\nas was frequently the case, a heavy penalty was imposed, which, if\r\nnot paid, the unhappy yeoman was forthwith committed to the Compter,\r\nwhere, upon reflection, he generally came to the conclusion to submit.\r\nIt is right, however, to state that at all times the Court have, in\r\ncases where the proposed Liveryman was actually a poor man, remitted\r\nthe fine, and allowed him to continue a yeoman; on the other hand,\r\ncontumacious refusal was invariably met in the firmest manner and\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nThe practice of calling up yeomen to the Livery was at times resorted\r\nto as a means of putting the Company into funds, and as these calls\r\ngenerally took place at periods of national trouble, when the coffers\r\nof the Company had been emptied by the King or the Parliament, the\r\nintended Liverymen were themselves not unfrequently in sore straits,\r\nand great contentions arose.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and fifty years ago the practice of enforcing these\r\nfines was in regular operation, but since then it has been attended\r\nwith varying success; not that the Company has not by law the power of\r\nenforcement, but a prejudice had grown up against the system, and the\r\nCourt has been unwilling to sanction a resort to extremities.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century three or four actions were brought against\r\nfreemen to recover penalties of £20 for refusing to accept the Livery;\r\nin one case which was ripe for trial the Company withdrew the record\r\nand paid the costs, and the others seem to have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nAll freemen on being sworn were liable to pay “quarterage,” which has\r\nbeen from the earliest period, and still is, 2_s._ per annum.[169] On\r\na man coming up for admission he was “presented,” that is, seen by the\r\nCourt who enquired into his position, knowledge, fitness and general\r\nqualifications, and if approved he paid his fees and was sworn. Some of\r\nthe earlier forms of oath will be seen on reference to the Ordinances,\r\nand that used up to a very recent period was as follows:--\r\n\r\n[169] The quarterage is now usually compounded for on admission by\r\npayment of a sum down.\r\n\r\n  You shall swear That you shall be True and Loyal to our Sovereign\r\n  Lady Queen Victoria and faithful and true in all lawful things unto\r\n  the Corporation and Company of the Mystery of Barbers of London,\r\n  whereof you are now made free, and accordingly be obedient to the\r\n  Master and Governors thereof: and as much as in you lieth maintain\r\n  amity and unity therein; and obey observe and perform all the\r\n  lawful rules statutes and ordinances thereof; and be proportionably\r\n  contributory to the best of your power, to all lawful or reasonable\r\n  charges contributions and payments belonging or necessarily\r\n  appertaining to you to bear and pay as other Brethren of the same\r\n  Company do. And also you shall obey all manner of summons or warnings\r\n  done, or to be made by the Clerk Beadle or other officer of the said\r\n  Company thereunto assigned in the name of the Master and Governors,\r\n  having no lawful or reasonable excuse to the contrary. All these\r\n  articles you shall duly, truly, fully and faithfully observe, perform\r\n  and keep to the best of your power. So help you God.\r\n\r\nA few years since, this oath was changed into a declaration, the words\r\n“You shall declare” being substituted for “You shall swear.”\r\n\r\nIt was generally the practice, when a member wished to be translated\r\nto another Company or entirely discharged, that he should pay a fine\r\nfor his dismission. In 1724, Mr. John Bamber, a Surgeon, informing\r\nthe Court that he intended to practise as a Physician and to become a\r\nMember of the College of Physicians prayed for his discharge, which\r\nwas granted to him on payment of thirty guineas, and there are other\r\nentries to the like effect.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for the governance of the members are very fully\r\ncontained in the Ordinances referred to elsewhere, and it would\r\ntherefore be tedious to further allude to them here. On a perusal\r\nof the extracts from the minutes, etc., many curious particulars\r\nwill be seen concerning both freemen and liverymen who were liable\r\nto be expelled for not being “able” (_i.e._, solvent) and also for\r\nnot attending in their livery gowns and hoods upon summons. There\r\nare many and often reminders to the livery to appear in their gowns\r\nwith their hoods upon their shoulders, and there are also cases in\r\nwhich individuals were forbidden to wear their gowns and hoods by way\r\nof punishment. The dress of the livery has been well described in\r\nHerbert’s Livery Companies, and Planche’s Costume, and we can see it\r\nin our great Holbein picture, though the dresses worn on that occasion\r\nwere of a much richer description than those in daily use.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Livery were constantly going out in procession\r\nin days of old. There were the services at St. Paul’s on Christmas and\r\nCandlemas days, the Lord Mayor’s procession, the setting of the watch\r\non Midsummer Eve, the celebration of 5th November, the anniversary\r\nof Gowrie’s Conspiracy, the Election Service at St. Olave’s, Silver\r\nStreet, days of thanksgiving and humiliation, Royal progresses and\r\nCivic pageants. To all of these the Livery were bidden to go by\r\nprecept, and on neglect of the summons were fined. In many cases\r\ncertain of them were appointed to ride on horseback with velvet coats\r\nand chains of gold about their necks, and when not so apparelled\r\nthey appeared in their gowns of black and scarlet, with their hoods\r\nupon their shoulders. What would we not give for a photograph of one\r\nof these gorgeous scenes wherein we should see the “liverie of our\r\nsolempne and grete fraternite” riding “ayenst,” say, Queen Elizabeth in\r\n1599?\r\n\r\nOur earlier records of freemen are unfortunately lost, the first\r\nregister commencing in the year 1551, but at Guildhall I have\r\ndiscovered several admissions of freemen Barbers to the freedom of the\r\nCity, and here place a few of them upon record. The first is in 1309:--\r\n\r\n  Thomas Orgor barbitonsor admissus fuit in libtãte civitatis & jurˀ\r\n  &c die sabĩ pˀxima post festñ scĩ Edmundi Regis & martirˀ anno R. E.\r\n  filˀ R. E. tcĩo coram Nich̃o de ffarendon Joh̃e de Wyndesore & Henrˀ\r\n  de Dunolm Aldris Et dat commitati xx{s} quos pˀdcĩ Aldr̃i recepˀunt.\r\n\r\n  (TRANSLATION.) Thomas Orgor, Barber, was admitted into the freedom of\r\n  the City and sworn, etc., on Saturday next after the feast of Saint\r\n  Edmund the King and Martyr in the third year of King Edward, the son\r\n  of King Edward, before Nicholas de Farendon, John de Windsor and\r\n  Henry de Durham, Aldermen, And gave to the Commonalty 20_s._, which\r\n  the aforesaid Aldermen received.\r\n\r\nOther entries are much in the same form, a few of which, abridged,\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n1309. John de Dodinghurst, Barber, admitted and sworn, etc., Friday\r\nnext after the feast of St. Thomas the Apostle; paid half a mark.\r\n\r\n1310. Ralph the Barber admitted, etc., 16th March; paid one mark.\r\n\r\n1310. Gilbert Blaunchard, Barber, admitted, etc., 1st April; paid 10_s._\r\n\r\n1310. Peter de Pecham, Barber, admitted, etc., 12th May, “at the\r\ninstance of Roger le Brabanzon, a justice of our Lord the King”; paid\r\n5_s._\r\n\r\n1310. Galfridus de Trengye, Barber, admitted, etc., Saturday before the\r\nfeast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist; paid 10_s._\r\n\r\n1311. John Syward, Barber, admitted, etc., Monday before the feast of\r\nSt. Edmund the King, at the instance of the Lord Walter, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, Chancellor, “et ideo nichil dat ꝓ liᵬtate habenda,” “and\r\n_therefore_ gave nothing to have the freedom!”\r\n\r\n1312. Ralph de Bosbery, Barber, admitted, etc., on Monday in the feast\r\nof St. Valentine; paid half a mark.\r\n\r\n1312. John de Fynceham, Barber, admitted, etc., 6th April; paid 10_s._\r\n\r\n1312. Henry de la Chaumbre, Barber, admitted, etc., on Monday in the\r\nvigil of the Assumption; paid half a mark.\r\n\r\n1312. Thomas de Mangrave who was the apprentice of Richard le Barber of\r\nBread Street, was admitted on Wednesday before the feast of St. James\r\nthe Apostle, on the testimony of Katherine, widow of the said Richard\r\nand of Robert de Gloucester, the executors of his will; paid 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe “Richard le Barber” mentioned in the last entry was Master of the\r\nCompany in 1308.\r\n\r\nThe freemen were formerly enrolled in the “yeomanry” and formed a minor\r\nfraternity within the Company (_see_ the chapter on the Yeomanry).\r\n\r\nAll freemen practising as journeymen or assistants, if Barbers,\r\nSurgeons, or Barber-Surgeons were “sessed at the Hall,” that is, their\r\nwages were settled for them by the Court, and entered in a book,\r\ntogether with the period for which they agreed to serve, the period\r\nbeing never less than one year nor more than three. These men were\r\noften called “covenant servants,” but they paid quarterage, and were\r\nentitled to all the privileges of freedom, excepting that they could\r\nnot take apprentices.\r\n\r\nIf a freemen desired to start in business, the By-laws of 1530 required\r\nthat he should prove to the Court as an act precedent to his so doing,\r\nthat he was possessed of goods to the value of ten marks.\r\n\r\nA certain class of members called “Foreign Brothers” are very\r\nfrequently alluded to in the Books, and it has been a matter of some\r\ndifficulty to ascertain what their status exactly was, but by collation\r\nof numerous entries I have come to the conclusion that, with very few\r\nexceptions, they were all of them practising Surgeons, and that they\r\nhad _not_ been apprenticed to freemen of the Company. If practising\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Company, they were compelled to join, or\r\nelse to forbear to practise, and it seems that on admission they were\r\nrequired to satisfy the Court by the production of their Indentures of\r\napprenticeship to Country or other Surgeons that they had duly served\r\nseven years, and to give ample proof of their skill and knowledge\r\nbefore the Examiners; exceptions to the production of indentures were,\r\nhowever, made in favour of those who came with recommendations from\r\npersons of quality, or of such as had acquired eminence and position\r\nin the profession. All sea surgeons were “Foreign Brothers” and paid a\r\nfine (generally seven guineas) on admission, they also paid quarterage\r\nas freemen, and when they resided within the jurisdiction were subject\r\nto all the rules and ordinances of the Company as other freemen, being\r\nfrequently fined and imprisoned for malpractice, etc., though they were\r\nnot entitled to the benefit of the charities, to come to the dinners,\r\nor to confer the right of admission by patrimony upon their sons, nor\r\ndo they seem to have been necessarily free of the City. Many Surgeons\r\npractising in the Country became Foreign Brothers for the sake of the\r\ndiplomas granted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall.\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances of “Barbers” being compelled to become\r\nForeign Brothers, for which I am unable to give an explanation, unless\r\nthey be errors of description by the Clerk for “Barber-Surgeons.”\r\n\r\nEvery freeman on admission formerly paid 3_s._ 4_d._, and every\r\napprentice on “presentation” 2_s._ 6_d._ For many years the names of\r\nthese persons are entered in the Audit Books, and thus it has been\r\npossible to ascertain the number admitted extending over a considerable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt appears that from the year 1603 to 1674, 3,479 persons were admitted\r\nto the freedom, an average of about 48 per annum; and 9,554 apprentices\r\nwere presented, an average of about 133 per annum. The greatest number\r\nof freemen admitted was in the year 1647 when 82 came on, and the least\r\nin 1666 when but 23 were admitted. With apprentices the greatest number\r\npresented was in the year 1629 when there were 219, and the least again\r\nin the year of the Great Fire when there were but 54.\r\n\r\nBetween 1674 and 1745, about 75 freemen and 162 apprentices would be\r\nthe yearly average.\r\n\r\nAfter the separation in 1745, and indeed down to the beginning of this\r\ncentury, a respectable average was maintained, being about 40 freemen\r\nand 60 apprentices per annum.\r\n\r\nIn the hundred years between 1746 and 1845, 2,964 persons were admitted\r\nto the freedom and 4,298 apprentices were presented, being an average\r\nof about 30 of the former and 43 of the latter for each year. The least\r\nnumber of freemen coming on was in 1845, when only 5 were admitted, and\r\nof apprentices in 1844, when but 4 were presented.\r\n\r\nThe apprentices always seem to have been a fruitful source of trouble\r\nboth to their Masters and to the Company, and numerous are the\r\nentries of their floggings and imprisonments. The term of servitude\r\nwas generally seven years, but in a few instances it was eight and\r\neven nine, the age at which boys were taken was usually fourteen, and\r\nbefore the Indentures were sealed the boy was “presented” to the Court\r\nthat it might be seen that he was clean and not deformed or diseased.\r\nIf approved, the Indentures were executed and recorded, and in all\r\ncases the apprentice actually lived with his Master, who covenanted\r\nto find him meat, drink, apparel, lodging and all other necessaries\r\naccording to the custom of the City. If the boy’s master died or for\r\nother reasons was unable to continue his business, it became necessary\r\nfor him to be “turned over” to another master, free of the Company,\r\nand that such turn over should be approved and recorded, otherwise the\r\napprentice was disqualified for his freedom. When his term expired the\r\nMaster brought him to the Hall and “testified” to his faithful service,\r\nwhereupon he became entitled to the freedom on payment of a nominal\r\nfine. Sometimes Masters refused to make their apprentices free, in\r\nwhich cases the Court enquired into the circumstances, and acted in\r\naccordance with the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the custom has prevailed to admit women to the\r\nfreedom, mostly by apprenticeship, but also by patrimony, and these\r\nfreewomen bound their apprentices, both boys and girls, at the Hall; of\r\ncourse the ladies were not admitted to the livery, but otherwise they\r\nhad the same privileges as freemen so far as the same were compatible\r\nwith their sex. At the present time (1890) there is one freewoman of\r\nthe Barbers’ Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPRENTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ordered 17th July, 1551. That Water Lynche whiche was prentise w{th}\r\n  John Tholmwoode Barborsurgeon shalbe and ys contented to serve Thomas\r\n  Woolf as a prentice from the daye above written untyll the viij{th}\r\n  yere of King Edward the sixte and so the sayd Water Lynche his yeres\r\n  to be fully ended and ronne out at the feaste of all Saints as may\r\n  appere by his Indenture.\r\n\r\n  19th September, 1552. Ordered that when any prentise dothe goo awaye\r\n  from his M{r} the same M{r} shall bring in his Indenture and here to\r\n  remayne tyll the prentice come agayne and to be regestred.\r\n\r\nIt was also ordered that the Beadle should make out all Indentures of\r\napprenticeship, and any one else presuming to do so should pay a fine\r\nof 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n27th April, 1556. It was ordered that no apprentice should wear a beard\r\nof beyond fifteen days’ growth, and that on breach of this order the\r\nmaster of the apprentice was to pay a fine of half a mark.\r\n\r\n  15th October, 1566. Here in this Court John James the appñts of John\r\n  Shryve for pylferyng, & so here he had his correction.[170]\r\n\r\n  [170] That is, he was flogged.\r\n\r\n27th May, 1567. Robert Cholmeley complained of his apprentice\r\n\r\n  for y{t} he doth not his worke as he ought & for his other ill\r\n  demeanors And so in the pˀsents of this Court the saide appˀnts\r\n  humbled hym upon his knees and pˀmyssed his amendment.\r\n\r\n1567. The quarrels between masters and apprentices about this period\r\nwere numerous, and occupied a great deal of the time of the Court, who\r\nin dealing with them generally pursued a policy of reconciliation and\r\nmade the parties friends again. In certain cases, masters were fined\r\nfor ill-treating apprentices, whilst some of the latter had their\r\nIndentures cancelled or “torn in Court” and were either whipped or\r\nordered to behave better, or to find new masters.\r\n\r\n  22nd August, 1569. Here was Rich Upton Playntyf agaynst his app̃nts\r\n  W{m} Fyshe for that he ranne awaye frome his said M{r} the xxj{th} of\r\n  the former moneth and tooke w{th} hym sˀten instruments for surgery\r\n  & other things more, w{ch} pˀtyculers were here pˀsently sene & by\r\n  the said W{m} Fyshe confessed and that he had no cawse to go frome\r\n  his said M{r} but that he wolde have gon to the sea and accordynge to\r\n  his desert had correction and punnyshment unto auncyent custom w{th}\r\n  roddes.\r\n\r\n  22nd November, 1569.

And so the said Gyles Swalldell appntꝭ hathe promysed\r\n  here that he wylbe a good faythfull & trusty servant unto his said\r\n  M{r} and never hereafter offende any more.\r\n\r\n  1st June, 1570. Here was John thappntꝭ of Thomas Wayte (for) abusying\r\n  of Rog{r} Laborne & his wyfe and his M{r} also and he had favorable\r\n  correction for his offencꝭ.\r\n\r\nJohn possibly thought it rather _unfavourable_.\r\n\r\nBy the next entry it would appear that Master Ralph Soda found the\r\nsociety of the ladies more congenial to his tastes than the practice of\r\nshaving and bloodletting.\r\n\r\n  15th February, 1572. Here was Henry Lusshe and witnessed how that his\r\n  app̃ntice Rafe Soda ranne awaye ffrom hym and contract hym self to\r\n  three wemen and was asked at Westm{r} in the church and also had delt\r\n  unhonestly w{th} his mayde srˀvnt.\r\n\r\n  19th May, 1573. Here was John Newsam and he was appoynted to brynge\r\n  in his fyne for not pˀsentynge his apprentice.\r\n\r\n  Here was John Appowell and he was appoynted the lyke.\r\n\r\n  9th June, 1573.

Pecocke complained to the Court against his master\r\n“ffor not well usinge hym in beatinge hym.”\r\n\r\nThe next is a quaint piece of dry humour--\r\n\r\n  6th October, 1573. Here was an order taken between Danyell Botham and\r\n  his appˀntice that he should well and trewly sˀve his M{r} and not to\r\n  make any more complainte or trouble the M{rs} any more, and yf he do\r\n  nott sˀve his M{r} accordyngly he shall have the Almes of the howsse.\r\n\r\nThe “Alms of the house” were on some other like occasions promised to\r\ntroublesome apprentices.\r\n\r\n  18th October, 1573. Here was John Staples and brought in his\r\n  apprentyze for evyll behavio{r} by hym comytted in his masters house\r\n  w{th} his masters mayde and he made his submyssion on his knees and\r\n  asked his master forgevenes in the courte, and he was forgeven uppon\r\n  condyc͠on that he should amend well & faythfullye w{th}out farther\r\n  complaint or elles to have the ponnyshment of the howsse.\r\n\r\n  11th December, 1599. In the matter in controversie betwixt Juliance\r\n  Yonge & John Bradley his apprentice it is ordered that the sayd Yonge\r\n  shall take his sayd apprentice into his service agayne And that the\r\n  sayd Yonge shall use him as hee oughte to doe And that the sayd\r\n  apprentice shall well and honestly behave himself towardsˀ his sayd\r\n  M{r.}\r\n\r\n  22nd January, 1600. This daye Daniell Hinkesman brought in his fine\r\n  of xl{s} for sufferinge his apprentice to dwell w{th} a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThis apprentice had probably been let out to hire as a valet by\r\nHinkesman, who received his wages instead of teaching him his trade.\r\n\r\n20th February, 1600. Noah Bayley having been complained of for striking\r\nhis apprentice Andrew Mathew, he was fined 40_s._, and at the next\r\nCourt Mathew had license to sue Bayley at the Common law for “breaking\r\nhis head.”\r\n\r\n  17th June, 1600. This daye it was ordered that George Langton\r\n  apprentice to M{r} ffrederick shalbe comitted to the compter for his\r\n  unreverent behaviour towardes his M{r.}\r\n\r\n  7th August, 1600.

This daie it is ordered that Thomas Shurwin\r\n  apprentice to John Urvey shalbe for ever utterly dischardged of his\r\n  terme of apprentisship for that it appeareth to the Maisters uppon\r\n  hearinge of their controversie that he hath the said apprentice\r\n  colorablie.\r\n\r\n  30th June, 1601.

This Court upon divers treatise with Abraham Purrott\r\n  a brother of this Companie being chosen into the livery by a former\r\n  Court & he being summoned to appeare this daye by agreem{t} yet came\r\n  not and hath alsoe formerly[179] answered that he will not hold the\r\n  place of a liveryman nor paye the fine but would onely give a peece\r\n  of plate of v{li} to this house as his gift in full satisfaction\r\n  of all his fines & places, w{ch} this Court doth think to be farr\r\n  short And therefore this Court doth impose and fine the said Abraham\r\n  Purrott at xx{li} according to the ordinances confirmed by the Lords\r\n  & by the Statute.\r\n\r\n  [179] Formally.\r\n\r\nSeveral others were from time to time similarly fined, both in the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries.\r\n\r\n  2nd August, 1737. At this Court Robert Young who was the apprentice\r\n  of James Phillips Surgeon was admitted into the freedom of the\r\n  Company by service and was sworn, and the said M{r} Young at the same\r\n  time took the Livery, and his master M{r} Phillips out of his own\r\n  bounty and a just sense of the diligent and faithfull services of\r\n  the said Robert Young during his Apprenticeship did not only pay the\r\n  charges of the said M{r} Young’s freedom but did likewise bestow upon\r\n  him his fine for the Livery being ten pounds.\r\n\r\n  29th October, 1751. It is ordered that upon all future days for\r\n  swearing in the Lord Mayor of this City at Westminster when this\r\n  Company shall have their Stand as usual No Liveryman shallbe admitted\r\n  into the same without leave of the Master unless he shall walk in\r\n  the Publick Procession cloathed in his proper Livery gown and hood\r\n  according to his summons.\r\n\r\n3rd October, 1752. It was further ordered--\r\n\r\n  That two men and a constable shall be hired to guard the Stand and\r\n  see that the said Order be complied with.\r\n\r\n9th November, 1765. Several liverymen notwithstanding former orders to\r\nthe contrary, having appeared on the Company’s Stand on Lord Mayors’\r\ndays without their gowns and hoods, it was ordered that any liveryman\r\ntransgressing in the like in future, should be fined half-a-guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YEOMANRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yeomanry of the Barber-Surgeons appear to have had a most chequered\r\nexistence, having been “established” and “put downe” several times,\r\nuntil finally they appear to have died out both in constitution and in\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe Yeomanry answered exactly to the class of Members who are now\r\nstyled “Freemen,” and for a long period were the most numerous body\r\nin the Company. In early times the numbers of the Livery or Clothing\r\nwere strictly limited, and under the Tudors and Stuarts rarely exceeded\r\nfifty, but as the persons who were compelled to take up their freedom,\r\nand those who came in voluntarily or by patrimony and servitude have\r\nalways been a numerous section, it appears to have been considered\r\npolitic to give a constitution to these inferior members of the\r\nMystery, and consequently a Yeomanry, or Company within the Company\r\nwas set up, and to this the new freeman was admitted after he had been\r\npresented and sworn before the Masters or Governors of the Clothing.\r\n\r\nThe Court of the Company framed the Ordinances for the Yeomanry,\r\nand whilst delegating to them many of their own privileges, as, for\r\ninstance, the power to levy fines, and to summarily commit offenders\r\nto prison, they always seem to have retained a very tight and jealous\r\nhand over them, and were constantly interfering with the Wardens of the\r\nYeomanry.\r\n\r\nThe Yeomanry had their own four Wardens and Court of Assistants, their\r\nBeadle and mace, common box, standing cups and other silver plate,\r\ntheir annual dinner, and sometimes, when in a flourishing condition, no\r\nless than four dinners in the year, their “corrector” for apprentices,\r\nand they also possessed the choice privilege of collecting the\r\nquarterage from their members. Under such auspicious circumstances, it\r\ncould hardly be otherwise than that, in process of time, they should\r\nbecome both presumptuous and audacious and thus provoke inevitable\r\ncollision with the Ruling body of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe Wardens of the Yeomanry at one period had designated themselves,\r\nor certainly encouraged others to describe them, as “The Wardens of\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons,” an assumption not to be tolerated, and, like\r\ntheir Masters on the Clothing, had been accustomed to go to their homes\r\n(after their gatherings and feasts) in state, accompanied by a “trayne\r\nor traynes”; these acts of presumption called forth the restraining\r\norder of the 15th September, 1588 (_vide post_). Later on we find that\r\nthey went “in searche to see what serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie\r\nhad, w{ch} they ought not to do,” they gave way to too much feasting\r\nand arbitrarily exercised their powers of fine and imprisonment, all\r\nwhich offences brought them reprimands, and somewhere about the year\r\n1604 their temporary extinguishment. They were, however, soon after\r\nre-erected, but in the year 1635 permanently “disestablished and\r\ndisendowed.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Constitution of the “Yeomanry” was then abolished, the\r\nappellation was retained for over 200 years after, though merely as\r\na traditional distinctive name synonymous with that of “freemen.”\r\nThus, the whifflers for Lord Mayor’s day were always chosen out of the\r\n“Yeomanry,” and members of the “Yeomanry” are continually spoken of as\r\nbeing chosen into the Livery.\r\n\r\nIn the Audit Book, 1847-1848, this ancient term is used for the\r\nlast time in respect of the receipts for quarterage, after this the\r\ndesignation becomes “freemen.”\r\n\r\n  19th September, 1552. It is condescendyd and agreed that there shalbe\r\n  no more yomanry of the said Company of Barbors Surgeons.\r\n\r\n1st October, 1555. It was agreed “that the yomanrye of the sayed\r\nCompany of Barbors and Surgeons shalbe establisshed and set up agayne\r\nand be in as full strenght force and power as ever yt was before\r\nthe plucking downe of the same,” and articles or ordinances for the\r\nYeomanry were enacted. As, however, these articles are excessively\r\nverbose, the following descriptions and extracts will suffice:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. Out of the Yeomanry were to be chosen four Wardens annually,\r\nand named respectively, the uppermost, second, third and youngest\r\nWardens.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. One of the Yeomanry to be appointed Beadle of the Yeomanry\r\nto execute summonses, etc.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. The Wardens of the Yeomanry to bring in once a year to the\r\nMasters and Governors of the Clothing, an account of monies remaining\r\nin their hands to be delivered to the new Wardens, and to be “kept and\r\nbestowed as they w{t}in themselves shall thinke yt meete and convenyent\r\nto the helpe and comforte of them w{t}in the yomanry of Barbors and\r\nSurgeons.” The Wardens were also to present the new Wardens to the\r\nMasters or Governors for approval within eight days after being chosen.\r\nThe Masters or Governors were to “have nothinge to dooe withe the monye\r\nof the yomanry.”\r\n\r\nArticle 4. If the Masters or Governors should borrow any monies of the\r\nYeomanry they were to repay on a day to be agreed upon “the saved som̄e\r\nso borrowed w{t} thanks geving.”\r\n\r\nArticle 5. The Wardens on the day of Election of Masters or Governors\r\nof the Clothing shall--\r\n\r\n  come to the dynner at the hall in their best apparrell at the daye\r\n  appointed whiche is the mondaye senighte before Barthelmew daye, and\r\n  when the M{r} and governors of the Clothinge doo gooe and choose the\r\n  new M{r} and governors the cheif wardein of the yomanrye shall beare\r\n  the cup before the M{r} The seconde wardein shall beare the cupp\r\n  before the uppermoste governor of the clothinge. The thirde wardein\r\n  of the yomãry shall beare the cupp before the seconde governor of the\r\n  clothinge and the yongest wardein of the yomanry shall beare the cupp\r\n  before the yongest governor of the clothinge in knowledging of the\r\n  setting up of the yomanrye agayne.\r\n\r\nIn the event of sickness or lawful absence, others were to be appointed\r\nto this duty.\r\n\r\n  And furthermore that noen of the wardeins of the yomanrye of barbors\r\n  and surgeons doo presume to goo aboute to make searche to see in\r\n  anye of the Companyes houses to knowe what prentizes they have or\r\n  journeymen as the M{r} and governors doo of the clothinge whoo have\r\n  aucthoritie so to dooe. Yf the wardeins of the yomanry be taken or\r\n  justelye proved that they doo soo, to forfaycte at every tyme so\r\n  doying to the hall vj{li} xiij{s} iiij{d.}\r\n\r\nArticle 6. The Wardens of the Yeomanry were to collect the quarterage\r\nof freemen (3_d._ per quarter) and of “fforyners” (6_d._ per quarter),\r\nand duly pay same over to the Masters and Governors, and books of\r\naccount were to be kept by the Wardens. NOTE.--In practice this article\r\nwas varied, as the Yeomanry kept the quarterage and “compounded” with\r\nthe Masters for a fixed annual sum.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The Masters were to pay the Wardens of the Yeomanry £4 which\r\nhad been “advanced by them in 1543 for provysyon of wheete for the\r\nCytie,” and which sum had been recently refunded by the City.\r\n\r\nArticle 8. The Yeomanry were to have the use of the chamber “where\r\nthe Lecture ys reade every Tewysday” whenever they please to consult\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nArticle 9. These Articles were to be written on parchment, sealed and\r\ndelivered to the Wardens of the Yeomanry.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. The Masters were to give notice to the Wardens of the\r\nYeomanry of any rules which they from time to time should make touching\r\nthe craft.\r\n\r\nArticle 11. The rules and ordinances of the Company were to be read to\r\nthe Yeomanry three times in every year, viz.: at Candlemas, in May and\r\nat Lammas.\r\n\r\nArticle 12. The Yeomanry were to obey all the rules and ordinances now\r\nmade or to be made.\r\n\r\n16th October, 1555. The first four Wardens of the Yeomanry were\r\npresented to the Masters, their names being Edward Hewet, John Surbut,\r\nGeorge Corraunte (Corron) and Thomas Buston (Burston).\r\n\r\n12th October, 1557. It was ordered:--\r\n\r\n  That the Wardens of the yeomanry allwaise for the tyme beinge and\r\n  by theire Assistantꝭ shall Elect and chuse every yeare to (two)\r\n  w{th}in themsylffs to be Coostꝭ[180] of the Lyberary and of the\r\n  Instrmentꝭ w{ch} by the M{rs} and Governors it was thought good and\r\n  most Convenyent that those too whyche are maisters of the Anathomys\r\n  to be Elected and Chosen the sayde Cowstꝭ (of the) Lyberary and\r\n  Instrumẽtis, and the Wardens of the yeomanry for the tyme beinge\r\n  shall delyvˀ and geve the kayse of the lyberarye and of the\r\n  instrument howse unto those whyche they have Chosen to be Coustose\r\n  thereof.

It was ordered:--\r\n\r\n  That uppon the Election daye and chusynge of the fowre wardeyns of\r\n  the yeomãry of the Mystery or Companye aforesayde And also theyre\r\n  Wardeyns then beynge elected and chosen and also theyre Dyner or\r\n  Recreocion then at o{r} hall beynge w{th} all y{r} Lawfull busynes\r\n  then don and ended That and then also at theire goynge and depˀtinge\r\n  frome ou{r} hall the sayde fowre wardeyns of the yeomanrye so named\r\n  by that name and by none other shall in any maner of wyse pˀsume or\r\n  take uppon them nor any of them to be wayted on or broughte home\r\n  unto y{r} owne houses Neyther shall go unto any other place or placꝭ\r\n  elꝭwhere havynge w{th} or after them any trayne or traynes eyther of\r\n  y{e} sayde Assystaunce or any beynge oute of theyre sayde assystaunce\r\n  and Companye But every pˀsone and persones of the sayde feloshyppe of\r\n  the yeomanrye then shall quyetly departe and go every man his owne\r\n  waye aboute his necessarye busynesse.\r\n\r\nA fine of five marks was ordered to be taken from the “comon boxe” of\r\nthe yeomanry, if the above regulation should be transgressed.\r\n\r\n  PROVIDED ALLWAYE That the sayde Wardeyns with the Rest of theyre\r\n  assystaunce feloshyppe and Companye of the Yeomanry maye and shall\r\n  at all Tyme and tymes decently and orderly go unto the maryagis\r\n  offeringꝭ and Buryalls of theyre sayde Brethren and Susters of the\r\n  sayde Company of the yeomanry as they here to fore have don.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1566. It was ordered that the Wardens and Assistants of the\r\nYeomanry should be allowed to sit at the “Uppermore” table in the Hall\r\non quarter days to receive their quarterages, and to read the rules and\r\nordinances to the Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  18th February, 1567. IN THYS COURTE here was Edward Parke beynge[182]\r\n  comytted to warde at the comaundment of the wardens of the yeomanry\r\n  for his disobedyencˀs, and for his oprobrius & obstynat words in the\r\n  pˀsents of this Courte to the M{r} & govˀnors he is comytted to warde\r\n  agayne.\r\n\r\n  [182] _i.e._ Having been.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1569. At this Court seven freemen were sworn in to be\r\nAssistants to the Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  15th November, 1569. In this Courte the wardens of the yeomanry\r\n  broughte in the pˀsentꝭ of this courte John Wyllet Thom̃s Warren and\r\n  John Jaggard & they reported y{t} Nycolas Whytemore sholde reporte\r\n  at the thre tonnes at yeldehall gate y{t} M{r} Pole of the chauncery\r\n  shold saye y{t} we ought to have no wardens of the yeomanry. And\r\n  Nyc͠ols Whytemore said y{t} he was at supper at M{r} Pole & one M{r}\r\n  Lovels & they pˀused the statutꝭ said to Whyttemore he hath ben\r\n  warden of his cõpany & he said no he had been warden of the yeomanry\r\n  & M{r} Pole sholde saye we cold not have a yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  18th April, 1570. Here was John Jagger sayth that he was nevˀ a\r\n  councell or knoleg of any pˀmoter beyng set to trouble the Company\r\n  for the state of o{r} yeomanry And also John Wyllet denyeth the byll\r\n  & wyll not confesse any thinge w{th}oute the pˀsentꝭ of his accuser\r\n  but for knowledge of the pˀmotter he nevˀ meante yt he said befor\r\n  god. And Thomas Warren saed he hathe kepte all to hymsylf & nevˀ\r\n  mynded nor thoughte to trouble in any respecte and denyeth the byll\r\n  also. And yt is ordered that they shall agree brotherly together and\r\n  here after they nor any of them shall move or speake or make any\r\n  rehersall of any matter as consernyng the state of the yeomãry upon\r\n  payne of ip̃rysonment. And Thom̃s Warren John Wyllet & John Jagger\r\n  shall take y{r} romes & placꝭ and brotherly they have eyther of them\r\n  taken one a nother handes & so these matters nevˀ to be reported any\r\n  more here after.\r\n\r\nThis brotherly amity did not long continue, for:--\r\n\r\n  23rd May, 1570. Here was John Warren & John Wyllet is comytted to\r\n  warde for dysobedyence, and Thomas Newens said that one Husto an\r\n  informer his neyghbo{r} saide that the company sholde be arẽsted[183]\r\n  upon a statute & y{t} yt is one of o{r} company did sett the enformer\r\n  to do yt but he founde not the statute to holde w{th} them & y{r}fore\r\n  he wolde not deale, but to name the pˀte[184] he wolde not.\r\n\r\n  [183] _i.e._ Sued.\r\n  [184] Party.\r\n\r\nWarren and Wyllet must have been sent straight off to prison, as a\r\nfurther minute states that on the same day “after diner,” Warren was\r\nbrought up out of the Compter for examination.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th May, Wyllet made submission and was released from prison.\r\n\r\n19th September, 1570. Warren and Wyllet seem to have been cantankerous\r\nbrethren, for they were complained of by the Wardens of the Yeomanry\r\nfor refusing to take upon themselves the office of Wardens to which\r\nthey had been elected.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1572. Wyllet is again complained of for going to law with\r\nanother member of the Company without license from the Masters, to\r\nwhich he pleaded that under a statute 19 Henry VII, cap. viii, he could\r\nlawfully do so. The result of this contention is not expressly stated,\r\nthough there is not the least doubt but that Wyllet revisited the\r\nCompter, and ultimately withdrew his suit.\r\n\r\n5th March, 1573. It was ordered--\r\n\r\n  That where there hath ben an order that the whole bodye of the\r\n  yeomanrye of this mysterie were compelled under a certeine fyne\r\n  and penaltye to meet theire wardens at a certeine place by them\r\n  appointed beinge by the beadle warned, to go to offre at the weddings\r\n  of their brethren at all times when any of them weare married w{ch}\r\n  was to their great trouble, and divers inconvenyences grewe thereoff\r\n  as absence from sˀrvice and sermons one sonday mornyngs and other\r\n  unmeate and inconvenient meetinges in steed therof. Wherefore, the\r\n  said order was declared henceforth to be void.\r\n\r\n  6th October, 1573. Here was a controvˀsy betweene the wardens of the\r\n  yeomanrye that were the last yere and the Audyto{rs} of yeomanryes\r\n  accomptes for that the Audytoures would not allowe that w{ch} was\r\n  required by the said late wardens for bread and dryncke at theyre\r\n  ellecc͠on Daye, the som̃e was xxvij{s} and order was taken that they\r\n  should be allowed xvj{s} and they to beare the reste on theire owne\r\n  chargeis and so to be ffrendꝭ and Lovers w{th} quietnes.\r\n\r\n  6th June, 1577. Here also the wardens of the yeomanry were comaunded\r\n  for good and urgent Cawse to bring in there graunt from the maisters\r\n  of there yomanry against the next Co{r}te Daie for that they did take\r\n  more Quarteridge then by the Lawe they might do and also contrary\r\n  to there saide graunte and in breche of the same they went after a\r\n  sort in searche to see what serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie had\r\n  w{ch} they ought not to do, and so yt was for that tyme let passe\r\n  w{th} warning to do so no more and also for that they did not yerelie\r\n  shewe there accompt w{ch} now they did and henceforth will according\r\n  to there dutie.\r\n\r\n  9th October, 1579. At this Co{r}te also the Wardens of the Yeomanry\r\n  brought in their accompte before the saide masters and yt was agreed\r\n  upon good considerac͠ons for that manye of the said yeomanrye did\r\n  ympoverishe them selves by makinge of qr̃ter Dyners and suche\r\n  unnecessary metinges that from henceforthe their shalbe no more\r\n  quarter Dyners be kept in o{r} Hall by the saide yeomanrye or any of\r\n  them but shall do as heretofore hathe ben accustomed to be don.\r\n\r\n1587. The Yeomanry seem to have again incurred the displeasure of the\r\nMasters, who thereupon summoned them to appear and shew cause why their\r\ngrant should not be annulled, whereupon they came on the 27th July and--\r\n\r\n  gave their ffree and full consentꝭ that yf they have broken any pt̃e\r\n  of their graunte to them heretofore made they will surrender upp\r\n  their yeomanry.\r\n\r\n10th August, 1587. The privilege of collecting quarterage was taken\r\naway from the Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  Also whereas there hathe ben a Rule graunted to the yeomanrie\r\n  that they maie send pˀsons to ward for disobedyence and to take\r\n  ffynes yt ys fullie agreed the same Rule shalbe void But yf anie\r\n  varyance happen to be, the same shall be declared to the masters or\r\n  governo{rs} for Reformac͠on And further that the said yeomanrie shall\r\n  take none into their Assystance w{th}oute the consent of o{r} saide\r\n  masters or governo{rs} and their successo{rs.}\r\n\r\n  7th September, 1587. M{r} Henry Rankin M{r} of o{r} Companie made a\r\n  motyon whether he sholde swere the yeomanry or not and yf they should\r\n  be sworne what othe he should geve them. And yt was agreed by the\r\n  saide Corte That the Masters or Governo{rs} may take the pˀsentment\r\n  of them but not swere them. And further yf the yeomanry do request\r\n  to be sworne they must be answered w{th} the wordꝭ of their pattent\r\n  w{ch} ys onlie to pˀsent them. And further touching the collecc͠on\r\n  of their quartridge yt must stand as yt dothe untill further\r\n  consultac͠on be had therein and yf they have any request to make or\r\n  ought to saie they must bring the same in writinge into this Corte.\r\n\r\n  29th May, 1600. This daie the wardens of the yomanrye made requeste\r\n  to the Maisters that they woulde be pleased to redeliver unto them\r\n  their booke of orders which remayneth in their Custodie, whereuppon\r\n  it is not thoughte fitt by the Courte that the yeomanrie have the\r\n  Custodie of the said booke, but that the Clarke of this Companye\r\n  keepe the same And that he shewe the same booke to the yeomanrye when\r\n  they have occasion to use it.\r\n\r\nAbout two years previously the Court had endeavoured to put down the\r\nYeomanry and had curtailed many of their privileges; the exact nature\r\nof the disagreement is not stated, but it doubtless arose from the\r\nYeomanry “takeinge to much uppon themsyllfs.”\r\n\r\n  17th January, 1604. At this Courte it is ordered That the Ould\r\n  Wardens of the Yomanrye doe bringe in such money as is behind by\r\n  theire Audite beinge eight pounds twelve shillings and eight pence\r\n  ORELLS to be committed to the Compter.\r\n\r\n28th February, 1605. It was ordered that a Yeomanry of this Company\r\nshould be established, though there is no entry of its extinguishment.\r\nRules and ordinances were to be made by the Court, and twenty-four\r\npersons were to be nominated by the “present wardens of the said\r\nYeomanry” to serve as a Court of Assistants for the Yeomanry, with a\r\npower of veto reserved to the Masters.\r\n\r\n16th April, 1605. A Committee sat to consider the patent to be granted\r\nto the Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  2nd May, 1605. This daye the M{r} and M{r} Warden Mapes and M{r}\r\n  Thorney delivˀed to the Wardens of the yomanry viz. Robert Jenninges\r\n  and Richard Alderson and also to Robert Wood and Edward Goodale the\r\n  yomanryes boxe and money their Corrector their twoe standinge Cuppes\r\n  & Covers and their cases and all such oth{r} thinges as they had of\r\n  the yomanryes, but onely their patent w{ch} is to be renued & twoe of\r\n  their keyes were delivˀed to the sayd Robert Wood and Edward Goodale\r\n  by them to be kept.\r\n\r\n  24th May, 1605. This daye the ordynancꝭ of the yomanry were ratiefied\r\n  & confirmed by this Court. Also the quarterages of the yomanry was\r\n  this daye demised unto the wardens of the yomanry from the xvj{th}\r\n  of September next ensuinge for the terme of ... at the yerely rent\r\n  of 8{li} to be paid by quarterly payments w{ch} demyse was passed by\r\n  wrytinge indented as by the same more at lardge may appeare.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Minute Book, 1598-1607, is a copy of a part of this\r\nindenture.\r\n\r\n26th November, 1607. It was ordered:--\r\n\r\n  That the wardens of the yomanry shall take for the use of their\r\n  funerall clothe at eˀvy funerall wherein it is used ij{s} vj{d} And\r\n  the bedell for his attendaunce xij{d} provided notw{th}standinge\r\n  that if such deceased pˀson shall owe unto the yomanry arrerages of\r\n  quarterage that the wardens of the sayd yomanry shall not lend their\r\n  said funerall cloth before such arrerages be first paid.\r\n\r\n  10th August, 1609. It was ordered that the Yeomandry shall hold their\r\n  great generall dinner albeit they made request to the Contrary.\r\n\r\nThe next extracts record the last events in the chequered existence of\r\nthe Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  17th November, 1635. According to a former order of Court the\r\n  Wardeins of the yeomanrye did this daye deliver up unto the Maisters\r\n  their Accompt and the xvij{li} v{s} viij{d} in money upon the foote\r\n  of that Accompt Also they delivered up to this Court their plate\r\n  bookꝭ and goodꝭ with the Inventarye and that being delivered & donn\r\n  Richard Lamb and Thomas Duppa twoe of the yeomanrye Wardeins threwe\r\n  downe their keyes on the table in a scornefull manner and badd y{e}\r\n  M{rs} take all.\r\n\r\n  3rd December, 1635. This daye upon mature deliberac͠on had as alsoe\r\n  upon just groundꝭ and causes showed to this Court of the greate\r\n  burthen of this Companie in the continuall charge of the keepeing\r\n  of a yeomanrye And it being propounded to this Court whether the\r\n  Wardeins and Assistants of the yeomanrye should continew the holding\r\n  of the yeomanrye yea or noe It was by most voyces fully concluded and\r\n  ordered that they shall continew noe longer their governem{t} And\r\n  they the Wardeins & Assistantꝭ of the yeomanrye & their governem{t}\r\n  are by this Court dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe office of Clerk of the Company is doubtless as ancient as the\r\nCompany itself, although there is no mention of one prior to the year\r\n1530[185]; but as there were always registers to be kept, fees to\r\nreceive, apprentices to bind, and the multifarious business of a Livery\r\nGuild to conduct and record, we conclude that the office has existed\r\nfrom the earliest period.\r\n\r\n[185] In the ordinances of Sir Thos. More.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk in Queen Mary’s time seems to have combined the occupation of\r\ngardener with that of his office, and for this he had but a small fee\r\nin addition to his stipend. Later on the Clerks appear to have devised\r\nfees for every conceivable kind of business which could possibly\r\nbe transacted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, and in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies the income derived from this source alone must have been very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe Company has been served by good, bad and indifferent Clerks; we\r\nprefer to dwell only on the former and record the names among others,\r\nof Francis Rowdon, Charles Bernard and John Paterson as being worthy\r\nto be held in goodly remembrance. The books of the Company abound in\r\ntestimony to their ability as well as to the fidelity and zeal which\r\nthey displayed in the execution of their office.\r\n\r\n1st October, 1555. The first Clerk of whom there is any record is\r\nThomas Apulton (or Apleton), who, being Beadle, was promoted to that\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen elsewhere, the Company had a fair garden in Monkwell\r\nStreet, and the following interesting minute connects it with the\r\nClerk:--\r\n\r\n  8th October, 1555. The Clercke of our Companye shall have for waxe\r\n  pennes and ynke and for trymynge of the gardeyn yerelye vj{s}\r\n  viij{d.} Yf the gardeyn be not well trymmed and made clene weded and\r\n  swept at all tymes when the M{r} and Governors of the clothing or\r\n  any of Thassistaunce of the same shall see yt and thereupon fynde\r\n  faulte then the saide Clercke shall paye a ffyne to the hall because\r\n  the said gardein ys not made cleane swept and wedyd as the M{r} and\r\n  Governors of the Clothinge and thassistaunce of the same shall think\r\n  meete and convenyent.\r\n\r\n5th March, 1556. It was ordered that if--\r\n\r\n  The Clercke of the Company doo evile mysuse any of the Clothinge or\r\n  of the yomanry w{th} unsemely words & dewe proofe therof had and\r\n  proved he shalbe dismyssed clere from the having of the Office of\r\n  clercke.\r\n\r\n27th August, 1557. John Johnson was elected and sworn Clerk “for so\r\nlonge time as he shal behave hymsyllfe well and honestlye in the saide\r\noffice.” The salary was fixed at £4 per annum, with 6_s._ 8_d._ extra\r\nfor paper, ink and keeping the garden, and “for wasshinge of the lynen\r\nof the howse iij{s} iiij{d.}”\r\n\r\nIt would appear that one Wilson had some time previously been Clerk,\r\nfor arrangements were made by which Wilson’s widow was not to be put\r\nout of her house, and it was also settled that if Johnson died before\r\nhis wife, his widow should in like manner have the house after his\r\ndecease. The rent of this house, which was attached to the Hall was\r\n10_s._ per annum, and paid by the Clerk to the Renter Warden.\r\n\r\nJohnson probably continued Clerk till about 1570, as the books are kept\r\nin the same handwriting until then.\r\n\r\nThomas Garter succeeded Johnson, but on 14th January, 1572, he was\r\ndismissed from his office for a “certain lewde facte by him committed,”\r\nand William Field was elected and sworn in in his place. Field wrote an\r\nexceedingly neat and precise hand.\r\n\r\n20th March, 1572. It was ordered that in future the Clerk of the\r\nCompany should always be chosen from among the freemen.\r\n\r\n15th March, 1575. William Eden elected Clerk vice Field.\r\n\r\n14th November, 1577. Eden was ordered to receive £6 per annum\r\n“benevolence” over and above his salary of £4, in consideration of the\r\n“smalenes of his lyvinge.”\r\n\r\n10th December, 1596. Eden was indebted to the Company £10, “yet in\r\nregard of the hardnes of the tyme and his greate charge he shalbe\r\nforborne this yere.” At the same Court, gifts were made to the Beadle\r\nand Porter on account of the hardness of the times.\r\n\r\n16th June, 1597. Eden’s troubles had not forsaken him for we read under\r\nthis date--\r\n\r\n  There was geven unto Willm̃ Eden Clark of the Companie in regard of\r\n  his greate charge and the scarsytie of the tyme the some of v{li}\r\n  and for the x{li} w{ch} he oweth he ys to pay the same as god shall\r\n  inable him.\r\n\r\n2nd November, 1597. Francis Rowdon elected Clerk vice Eden. Rowdon\r\nappears to have been a most methodical man and kept the books with\r\nscrupulous neatness and care; his writing is a very fine specimen of\r\nthe Court hand of the period, and the best in the Company’s books for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n1599. The Clerk’s Salary was raised to £6 per annum.\r\n\r\n1600. To £8 per annum, and in\r\n\r\n1603 To £10 per annum.\r\n\r\n  26th November, 1607. This daye ffrancꝭ Rowdon Clark to this Company\r\n  pˀsented his petic͠on to this Court by w{ch} hee prayed ratificac͠on\r\n  of certen fees belonginge to his place and office in this Company as\r\n  hereof doe insue.\r\n\r\n  FFIRST hee prayed to have xl{s.} for the drawinge registringe of the\r\n  M{rs} accompt so that it be regestered w{th}in twoe moneths aft{r}\r\n  the awdit.\r\n\r\n  ALSO hee prayed to have x{s.} for evˀy alienac͠on of every lease of\r\n  any of the Companyes landes or tenemtꝭ for wrytinge thereof.\r\n\r\n  ALSO to have for the drawinge & ingroseinge of every lease xx{s.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO to have xij{d.} for evˀy othe ministered by any of the M{rs} to\r\n  any of the yomanry of this Company.\r\n\r\n  ALSO to have xij{d.} for evˀy one that is made free by service\r\n  and sixe shillingꝭ & sixe pence of every man that is made free by\r\n  redempc͠on or translac͠on.\r\n\r\n  ALSO vj{s.} viij{d.} for enteringe of every Anathomy accompt.\r\n\r\n  ALSO to have iiij{d.} for every Acquittance that hee shall make for\r\n  the wardens of the yomanry for the forme of theyre quarterage And\r\n  xij{d.} of them for the Coppie of every order w{ch} concerneth the\r\n  governem{t} of the yomanry.\r\n\r\n  ALSO that hee may have of evˀy freeman for his letter of admittance\r\n  or tollerac͠on under the seale of the house vj{s.} viiij{d.} And of\r\n  evˀy forren for the lyke x{s.} And of evˀy alien xiij{s.} iiij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for pennes Inck & papˀ and for the wardens bookes pˀ an. x{s.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for every bill of complaynt iiij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for enteringe of evˀry order betwixt pˀtie & pˀtie for the\r\n  endinge of any Controversie xij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for makeinge cleane the hall against evˀy feaste iiij{s.} And\r\n  such a dishe of meate as the M{rs} of evˀy such feast shall think\r\n  fit.\r\n\r\n  ALSO for evˀy searche for the name of evˀy freman or appˀntice\r\n  iiij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for evˀy pˀson that is taken into the livˀy iij{s.} iiij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALSO for evˀy pˀson that is taken into the Assistantꝭ iiij{s.}\r\n  iiij{d.}\r\n\r\n  ALL w{ch} ordinancꝭ and allowances were ratiefied & confirmed by this\r\n  Court.\r\n\r\n  6th July, 1609. Uppon the humble suite & petic͠on of ffrancꝭ Rowdon\r\n  Clarke to this Company It is this daye ordered by this Courte that\r\n  w{th}in one moneth next ensuinge hee shall noĩat to the pˀnt M{rs} a\r\n  sufficient Clarke to whom hee is desyreous to surrender his place and\r\n  office of Clark to this Company And his suite shalbe graunted unto\r\n  him if such pˀson so to be pˀnted unto this Court shalbe lyked and\r\n  allowed.\r\n\r\n26th July, 1609. Rowdon presented Richard Ratsdale, Scrivener, for the\r\noffice of Clerk, about whose sufficiency and ability enquiries were\r\nordered to be made, but they were not satisfactory, for, on the 10th\r\nAugust, William Syddon was elected Clerk vice Rowdon.\r\n\r\nThe same day it was ordered that Rowdon was to continue in the Livery\r\nand to have the use of the Hall and his house until Michaelmas, also\r\nthat Syddon was to be translated from the Cutlers’ Company.\r\n\r\nSyddon’s records of the Company’s business were very meagre and a great\r\ncontrast to those of the former Clerk.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1625. Syddon surrendered his clerkship to Richard Turner\r\n(a son of Cressens Turner, Clerk in the Lord Mayor’s Court), who\r\nwas admitted and sworn. Turner died in 1643, and by his will left\r\nsome property to the Company to be annually distributed in charity\r\namongst freemen of the Barber-Surgeons, and this became the source\r\nof a protracted litigation between his widow and the Company. On the\r\n17th November, 1643, she filed a bill against the Company, which\r\nthey defended, and succeeded in retaining the greater portion of the\r\nbequest. The accounts appear to have been very intricate and involved,\r\nremaining unsettled for many years. The Court, however, distributed\r\nthe whole of the bequest in accordance with the will, as long as the\r\nestate (which was leasehold) held out.\r\n\r\n  16th June, 1628. It is ordered by this Court and our M{r} gave order\r\n  to the Clarke that he should henceforward have a stoole and sitt at\r\n  the end of the table w{th} his bookes and register as the clarkes of\r\n  other Companies doe.\r\n\r\n2nd October, 1643. Robert Rawlins elected Clerk vice Turner.\r\n\r\n30th June, 1648. The Court granted Rawlins £30 in consideration of his\r\ngreat pains about the Company’s business, and ordered that his salary\r\nshould be raised from £10 to £30 per annum.\r\n\r\n23rd February, 1658. Richard Reynell elected Clerk vice Rawlins\r\n(resigned).\r\n\r\n21st July, 1685. Joseph Masters elected Clerk.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1685. Charles Hargrave elected “Deputy Clerk.” The\r\nbusiness of the Company had of late years increased enormously in\r\nconsequence of the examinations of and Certificates to Navy Surgeons,\r\nexaminations held for superannuation of wounded or infirm soldiers and\r\nsailors, and other matters connected with the Navy office, all of which\r\nentailed vast labour on the Clerk.\r\n\r\n28th November, 1688. Charles Hargrave elected Clerk vice Masters.\r\n\r\n20th November, 1707. Charles Bernard elected Clerk vice Hargrave.\r\n\r\nHargrave had kept the books in a slovenly manner, and appears to have\r\nbeen both a dishonest servant as well as an improvident man.\r\n\r\n11th December, 1707. It was reported to the Court that Hargrave’s\r\nEstate was indebted to the Company £320 8_s._ 6_d._, moneys which he\r\nhad received and not accounted for.\r\n\r\n8th July, 1708. Mrs. Sarah Hargrave (his Widow) presented a petition\r\nfor relief, stating that she was in poor circumstances, with six\r\nchildren unprovided for, whereupon the Court, notwithstanding her late\r\nhusband’s delinquencies, very generously ordered her a gratuity of £12\r\n10_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\nCharles Bernard was a relative of, and Executor to Charles Bernard,\r\nSerjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne and Master in 1703. It is delightful\r\nto observe the methodical and careful manner in which Bernard began,\r\nand all through his life kept the books and accounts; he wrote a large\r\nand elegant hand, though somewhat encumbered with flourishes, and his\r\nsignature is a characteristic one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handwritten signature]\r\n\r\n7th September, 1708. Hargrave’s son was in the Compter, and the Clerk\r\nwas directed to see and talk with him about the Company’s papers in\r\nhis custody, and if he would give them up the Clerk was to make him a\r\npresent of three guineas.\r\n\r\nThe Court frequently relieved Mrs. Hargrave, and in December, 1709,\r\ngave her £15.\r\n\r\nAmong the official list of Clerk’s fees at this period were the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    For the use of the Hall for ffuneralls, Country ffeasts\r\n      or weddings                                                1 0 0\r\n\r\n    ffor the ffunerall of every Liveryman, the best hood or      0 7 0\r\n\r\n  17th July, 1718. The Court as a particular reward to Charles Bernard\r\n  their Clerk for abstracting and peruseing the Company’s title to\r\n  the Estate in East Smithfield and for his care in passing the fine\r\n  thereof whereby the Company saved a sume of money and for his\r\n  extraordinary trouble in attending the Lords of the Admiralty and\r\n  prosecuteing several persons for takeing the dead bodys from the\r\n  place of Execuc͠on Did and do hereby give him the sum̄e of fourscore\r\n  pounds who accepted the same as a most bountifull Instance of the\r\n  kindness of this Court to him with a full resoluc͠on on his part to\r\n  acquitt himself by all imaginable and constant returns of duty and\r\n  gratitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Bernard, who had been a most zealous Clerk and high in the\r\nesteem of the Court, died somewhere between the 5th and 20th February,\r\n1740.\r\n\r\n25th March, 1740. Joseph Wheeler, son of John Wheeler, Barber-Surgeon,\r\nelected Clerk, vice Bernard. Wheeler wrote a fine bold and flowing\r\nhand; and the books were well kept, but he was evidently not so able a\r\nman as Mr. Bernard.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1740. Joseph Wheeler provided two sureties who entered into a\r\nbond for £3,000, to ensure his fidelity in the execution of his office.\r\n\r\n17th January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having complained\r\nthat sufficient regard had not been paid to former letters of theirs\r\nrespecting Surgeons’ Mates, and it appearing that the Clerk had\r\nwithheld the said letters from the Court, it was ordered that he should\r\nbe suspended forthwith, with which the Commissioners were acquainted\r\nand also that the Court had resolved not to take off such suspension\r\nbut by the consent and desire of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n31st January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having signified\r\ntheir desire that the Clerk should be restored to his office, he was\r\ncalled into Court, severely reprimanded, reinstated in his position,\r\nand cautioned as to his future conduct.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler continued Clerk until the separation of the Surgeons from\r\nthe Barbers in 1745, when neither body retained his services, and it\r\nappearing that moneys were due from him to the Company, application was\r\nmade to his sureties.\r\n\r\n25th June, 1745. John Paterson was chosen Clerk to the Barbers’ Company\r\nat the first Court held after the separation, and entered into a Bond\r\nwith two sureties in a sum of £2,000.\r\n\r\n19th February, 1746. Mr. Paterson having brought in an account of his\r\nCosts in the matter of the separation of the Surgeons amounting to £167\r\n13_s._ 2_d._, and also an account of voluntary contributions by members\r\nof the Company towards defraying the same amounting to £168 10_s._\r\n6_d._, he begged the Court to accept of his past services as a return\r\nfor the honour done him in his election, and the Court were pleased\r\nto accept of the compliment, but having a high sense of the services\r\nrendered by Mr. Paterson, they directed the sum of £80 to be laid out\r\nin plate and presented to him “to remain in his family as a memorial of\r\nhis merit and of their gratitude.”\r\n\r\n5th March, 1765. Mr. Paterson requested permission to resign his\r\noffice, which the Court accepted with great reluctance, and passed a\r\ncomplimentary resolution in his favour.\r\n\r\nRichard Beale, who had been Mr. Paterson’s clerk and was highly\r\nrecommended by him, was elected Clerk.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1765. Mr. Paterson was unanimously elected an Assistant.\r\n\r\nMr. Beale bequeathed £500 to the Company in reversion on the death of\r\nMrs. Ann Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n22nd April, 1766. James Marye elected Clerk vice Beale (deceased).\r\n\r\n  22nd April, 1766. John Paterson Esquire being withdrawn a Motion was\r\n  made and the question being put That a piece of plate of the value of\r\n  Fifty Pounds or thereabouts be presented to the said M{r} Paterson\r\n  as a mark of the high esteem and value this Court entertains of his\r\n  merit and abilities and to shew their gratitude to him for his long\r\n  and faithful services during the course of twenty years and in return\r\n  for his readiness on every occasion to assist this Court with his\r\n  advice and council, the same was carried in the Affirmative, NEMINE\r\n  CONTRADICENTE.\r\n\r\nBy the Accounts for this year it appears that a Silver Tureen, Dish and\r\nLadle were purchased for £65 16_s._ 0_d._, and this was no doubt the\r\ngift to Mr. Paterson.\r\n\r\n20th August, 1767. The Court being informed that Mr. Paterson intended\r\nto stand for the City at the next General Election, it was ordered that\r\nhe should have the use of the Company’s Hall for his meetings.\r\n\r\nAn excellent mezzotint portrait of Mr. Paterson, with some eulogistic\r\nlines below, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 Mr. Paterson presented to the Company the valuable portrait of\r\nthe Duchess of Richmond, painted by Sir Peter Lely, and which still\r\nadorns the Court Room.\r\n\r\nMr. Paterson was a member of the Common Council, and sometime\r\nChairman of the Bridge House Estates Committee, he was also M.P. for\r\nLudgershall, Wilts. He was ever faithful to this Company, serving it\r\nwith distinguished ability, and seems to have been greatly respected\r\nand esteemed.\r\n\r\n1st June, 1790. William Wood elected Clerk vice Marye.\r\n\r\nMr. Wood presented the Company with a handsome Silver Tea Urn.\r\n\r\n13th August, 1795. Edward Grose Smith (Mr. Wood’s partner) elected\r\nClerk vice Wood, resigned.\r\n\r\n5th March, 1822. Henley Smith (son of E. G. Smith) elected Clerk vice\r\nSmith, resigned.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1861. Mr. Henley Smith resigned and was elected an\r\nAssistant (Master in 1864).\r\n\r\n7th May, 1861. Henley Grose Smith (son of Henley Smith) elected Clerk\r\nvice Smith, resigned. Mr. Henley Grose Smith was elected an Assistant\r\n1877.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE BEADLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no certainty as to the first institution of this office,\r\nthough it is probably not so old as that of the Clerk, who in ancient\r\ntimes, summoned the Livery, collected the quarterage and performed\r\nvarious duties which we afterwards find assigned to the Beadle, and we\r\nmay conclude that in those days he was little more than a Caretaker or\r\n“Porter”; indeed, this is the more likely as the latter designation is\r\nfrequently applied to the Under Beadle in the Records.\r\n\r\nAs the business and numbers of the Company increased, several minor\r\nfunctions of the Clerk were delegated to the Porter or Beadle, who had\r\ndistinctive duties assigned to him varying with the age in which he\r\nlived; among these may be enumerated, sweeping the garden, collecting\r\nquarterage, cleaning the Hall, whipping naughty apprentices, summoning\r\nfreemen, etc., bringing home dead bodies from Tyburn, keeping lists of\r\njourneymen, pressing Surgeons and Barbers for sea service, assisting\r\nthe Masters on search days, hunting up and laying informations against\r\nnon freemen practising Barbery and Surgery, marshalling and heading\r\nprocessions, both at the Hall and in the City pageants, guarding the\r\nParlour door, and other offices too numerous to particularise, though\r\nthere were but few of them which did not yield a fee, and indeed our\r\nBeadle could hardly have lived without fees, for his official salary\r\nin Edward VI’s time was but £4 per annum, which, notwithstanding the\r\ngreater value of money then, could scarcely be considered a fat living.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the office has been (and properly so) held by\r\nfreemen, and in the appointment of the Court. In 1626, however, the\r\nLord Keeper sent a letter “recommending” (_i.e._, commanding) the\r\nCompany to elect one Gorton, a servant of his, to the place, and Gorton\r\nwas accordingly chosen. The interference of the King and his great\r\nofficers in the patronage and appointments vested in the City guilds\r\nwas carried to great lengths with some of the Companies, and there are\r\namusing accounts extant of the astuteness with which this meddling was\r\nsometimes met (_vide_ Herbert’s Livery Companies). Our Company, with\r\nthe solitary exception above referred to, appears to have been happily\r\nfree from this species of intervention.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 17th century there were two Beadles of the Clothing, the\r\nUnder Beadle being often styled the Porter, but about the middle of the\r\n18th century, and since then, one Beadle has sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe Beadle has always had his “house” at the Hall, and used formerly\r\nto pay a small quit rent for it. On the dismission of a Beadle for\r\nmisconduct, a difficulty was sometimes experienced in regaining\r\npossession of this house, and various shifts were resorted to;\r\neven the Beadles’ Widows now and then refused to turn out, and the\r\n“benevolences” meted out to them were possibly sometimes in the nature\r\nof bribes to induce them to go.\r\n\r\nBesides the Beadles of the Clothing, there was a Beadle of the\r\nYeomanry, whose duties were analogous to those of his more exalted\r\nbrethren, and into whose office he frequently stepped when there was a\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\nThe Beadles for many years had a most disagreeable duty to perform,\r\nnamely, the procuring and bringing home from Tyburn the dead bodies\r\nof malefactors. By the Act 32 Hen. VIII, the Company were empowered\r\nto have yearly the bodies of four executed felons for “anatomies,”\r\nand the practice was for the Beadles to attend at the gallows and\r\nselect such bodies as they pleased. Their opponents were generally the\r\nhangman, who himself trafficked in these uncanny goods, the relatives\r\nof the criminal, and the populace who were incited by the relatives\r\nto resist the Beadles. Many were the unseemly fights which took place\r\nover these bodies, and oftentimes when the Beadles had secured a\r\n“subject” and were driving off with it in a coach, they were attacked\r\nand beaten, and the body rescued from them. The hangman appears to\r\nhave been entitled to the dead man’s clothes, for on more than one\r\noccasion the Company gave him compensation for them, they having been\r\ntorn to pieces in the brutal struggle for possession. Moreover the\r\nCompany had often to satisfy the Coachmen for personal injuries and\r\nfor damages to their coaches, as well as to give special gratuities to\r\ntheir Beadles by way of solatium for the beatings which they underwent.\r\nFrequent prosecutions and convictions followed the interference with\r\nthe Company’s Officers at these times, and even the Sheriff’s Officers\r\nwere on one occasion dismissed by the City for having sided against the\r\nBeadles.\r\n\r\nThe hangman came to the Hall regularly for his Christmas Box and gave a\r\nreceipt for the same, sometimes affixing the title “Executioner” after\r\nhis signature. Many curious particulars relating to the above will be\r\nfound elsewhere.

The earliest reference to the Beadle in our Records is\r\nto be found in the Ordinances signed by Sir Thomas More, where it is\r\ndirected that the Members shall take their seniority “according to the\r\ntrew entrance therof in the Bedyllꝭ Rolle.”\r\n\r\n6th November, 1550.

The Company could not get Clifton out of his house,\r\nso they gave him 20_s._ and a pension of 40_s._ per annum during good\r\nbehaviour and the pleasure of the Court. Possibly the “pleasure of the\r\nCourt” did not extend beyond one year.\r\n\r\n15th February, 1626. Edward Gorton (recommended by the Lord Keeper)\r\nelected Beadle in place of Mumford.\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1628.

The Court generally endeavoured\r\nto effect a friendly relationship between the parties, though in\r\ncases which were considered as clearly proved against the Surgeon,\r\nhe was either fined or imprisoned, or else ordered to make suitable\r\ncompensation to the patient.\r\n\r\n  7th September, 1574. Here was John Griffen complayned uppon William\r\n  Pownsabe for gevinge him a powder w{ch} lossed all the teeth in his\r\n  head, w{ch} John Griffen had the dissease w{ch} we call Demorbo\r\n  gallico.\r\n\r\n2nd February, 1575.

Here was a Complaint against Willm̃ Clowes[191]\r\n  by Richard Carrington for that the saide Willm̃ Clowes as he saide\r\n  had abused him in wordes in the hall and here they did shake handes\r\n  and were made frends, for that the said Clowes had been sent to ward\r\n  before by the saide Richard Carrington being one of the wardens of\r\n  the yeomanry.\r\n\r\n  [191] An eminent Surgeon and Warden in 1594.\r\n\r\n  18th March, 1578.

That no pˀson or pˀsons of this Companie do presume\r\n  at anie tyme or tymes hereafter of Anathomies to take and carrie\r\n  awaie or cause to be taken or carried awaie any pˀte of the skynn of\r\n  anie bodie whiche shall at anie tyme hereafter happen to be wrought\r\n  upon w{th}in the hall of the misterie and the same tann or cause to\r\n  be tanned like lether upon the payne of v{li.}\r\n\r\n  7th December, 1581. It ys agreed that there shalbe a Bill put into\r\n  the pˀliament house for easinge the Companie of the charge of\r\n  sendinge souldiers to the wars and also for suppressinge of lewd\r\n  dealers in surgerye.\r\n\r\n18th July, 1583. The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen having\r\nrecommended that persons using Barbery should not practise Surgery, the\r\nMaster and Governors went to Guildhall, and there promised the Court of\r\nAldermen that they would compel all their free Barbers to enter into\r\nbonds not to “medle or deale w{th} any sick of the plauge or infected\r\ncum morbo gallico,” and accordingly the Barbers entered into bonds to\r\nthat effect.\r\n\r\nIn Stow’s Annales, ed. 1592, p. 1261, is the following remarkable\r\naccount of a “subject” coming to life again at our hall.\r\n\r\n  1587. The 20 of Februarie, a strange thing happened a man hanged for\r\n  felonie at Saint Thomas Wateringes, being begged by the Chirurgions\r\n  of London, to have made of him an Anatomie, after hee was dead to\r\n  all mens thinking, cut downe, stripped of his apparell, laide naked\r\n  in a chest, throwne into a carre, and so brought from the place\r\n  of execution through the Borough of Southwarke over the bridge,\r\n  and through the Citie of London to the Chirurgions Hall nere unto\r\n  Cripelgate: The chest being there opened, and the weather extreeme\r\n  cold hee was found to be alive, and lived till the three and twentie\r\n  of Februarie, and then died.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless the above circumstance, to which reference is made\r\nin the next minute; it would seem that the body had been begged by\r\nsome surgeons and taken to the hall to be dissected there, it being\r\nunlawful to dissect elsewhere, and that on the resuscitation of the\r\nunhappy man, the Company had been put to some expenses whereupon they\r\nmade an order to provide for any similar case in the future. This body\r\nwould be what is often referred to in the Books as a “private anatomy,”\r\nin opposition to the four “public” bodies of felons to which the\r\nCompany were annually entitled.\r\n\r\n  13th July, 1587. Iˀtm yt ys agreed That yf any bodie w{ch} shall at\r\n  anie tyme hereafter happen to be brought to o{r} Hall for the intent\r\n  to be wrought uppon by Thanatomistes of o{r} Companie shall revyve\r\n  or come to lyfe agayne as of late hathe ben seene The charges aboute\r\n  the same bodie so revivinge shalbe borne levied and susteyned by such\r\n  pˀson or pˀsons who shall so happen to bringe home the Bodie. And\r\n  further shall abide suche order or ffyne as this Howse shall Awarde.\r\n\r\n  7th December, 1598.

The details\r\nof the expenditure are subjoined, and in reading them we cannot but\r\ncommiserate the unhappy men who were barged to Gravesend and thence\r\n“transported” to Newcastle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBURSEM{T}ꝭ FOR IMPRESTING AND SHIPPINGE OF THE SURGIANS IN THE YEARS\r\nIMPLOYM{T} FOR THE KINGS SERVICE.\r\n\r\n  Laid out by Edmund Johnson for ymprestinge\r\n    of Surgeons for the Kingꝭ service           v{li}\r\n\r\n  Delivered to M{r} Collins for the like                  x{s}\r\n\r\n  Spent in goeinge to Lymehouse Ratcliffe &\r\n    wappinge to presse                                        xviij{d}\r\n\r\n  Paid to xxiij Surgions who were transported\r\n    by sea from London to Newcastle xxiij{li}\r\n    of w{ch} rec{d} by M{r} Serjant Clowes\r\n    xvij{li} x{s} & my selfe xx{s} so that\r\n    there doth remayne unsatisfied           iiij{li}     x{s}\r\n\r\n  Paid unto Tho: Wells the M{r} of the\r\n    shipp to transport them                  viij{li}\r\n\r\n  Paid for a barge to carry us & them to                xxx{s}\r\n    Gravesend\r\n\r\n  Spent at Gravesend at dynner                           ix{s}   vj{d}\r\n\r\n  Spent at Supper                                       vij{s}\r\n\r\n  Paid Jo: Mules w{ch} he disburced for\r\n    Warfage literage caremenn & other like\r\n    Charges as pˀ bill                                  xxvj{s}\r\n                                              -------------------------\r\n                                     Sum̃ is   xxj{li} xiiij{s}\r\n                                              -------------------------\r\n\r\nIn accordance with their Charters the ancient practice of the Company\r\nhad been to elect annually two Surgeons and two Barbers for Master\r\nand Wardens; this fell into electing two Surgeons and two others\r\nwho were often neither Barbers nor Surgeons, and latterly, even the\r\nqualification of Surgery came to be disregarded, whereupon (29th March,\r\n1639) a mandate, signed by Charles I and directed to the Company, was\r\nread in Court (see Appendix, G) in which the King set forth that divers\r\npersons as “hosiers dyers & other tradesmen unskilfull in Chirurgery\r\nor Barbarye” had been chosen for Masters and Wardens contrary to\r\nthe Charters and Acts of Parliament, and further “wee takeing into\r\nconsiderac͠on of what dangerous consequence it maye be to suffer a\r\nCompanye wherein the lives and safetie of o{r} people are soe much\r\nconcerned and for w{ch} o{r} progenitors have soe carefully provided to\r\nbe governed by such unskilfull pˀsons,” the King straitly commanded\r\nthe Company to elect the Governors in the future as they ought to do,\r\nviz.: two Barbers and two Surgeons each year.\r\n\r\nThis order of the King appears for some little time to have been\r\nobeyed, and then the Company relapsed into their old practice of\r\nchoosing at their pleasure, whereupon another mandate came from the\r\nKing, for we find that:--\r\n\r\n17th January, 1644. The Court took notice of the King’s mandate, and\r\na very long and elaborate minute is entered to the effect that the\r\npractice of choosing two Barbers and two Surgeons for Governors was\r\nfraught with much inconvenience and had led to great dissensions, and\r\nthe Court referring to the Statute of Henry VII, where it is allowed\r\nthat any person free of the Company following any other profession than\r\nthat of a Barber or Surgeon should be reputed and taken as a Barber,\r\nordered that for the future, any Member of the Assistants, other than\r\na Barber or Surgeon, might be put in nomination, and that he should\r\nbe accounted a Barber. The Court were very careful to express their\r\nloyalty to the King whilst they ignored his mandate, trusting no doubt,\r\nthat should they afterwards be called to account by the King, their\r\ndutiful expressions towards him would serve in a measure as an excuse\r\nfor disobeying his express commands.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote:\r\n  Mould for y{e}\r\n  Kings Evill.]\r\n\r\n  2nd July, 1639. Anthony Mould called to this Court and questioned\r\n  concerneing his practise in Surgerye, confessed that he deales onely\r\n  in swellings and Kernills & hath a licence from the Kinge to practise\r\n  the same, he hath lately taken into his Cure one George Ravenscroft\r\n  for scrophilous tumo{rs} in the neck, this Court at the said Moulds\r\n  request, hath given libertye to Mould to cure him by Michaelmas next,\r\n  & he hath promised then to present the said Geo: whole & well to this\r\n  Court.\r\n\r\nSome nine years afterwards Mould was again before the Court in a case\r\nof King’s evil.\r\n\r\n  21st March, 1648. Henry Ivatt complayned against Anthony Mold for\r\n  his evill practice On the Wife of the said Ivatt who being afflicted\r\n  with the Kings Evill Whereof he undertooke to cure her And for that\r\n  purpose did receive of the said Ivatt xxx{s} in hand and was to have\r\n  40{s} more when she was cured Both partyes refeered themselves to\r\n  this Court Whereupon this Court doth Order That the said Mold doth\r\n  restore xx{s} back againe to the said Ivatt Which he promised to pay\r\n  accordingly And soe all differences betweene the said parties by\r\n  theire owne consent to cease and determine.\r\n\r\n  6th February, 1646.

This day M{r} Warden Browne acquainted this Court\r\n  that whereas he about 6 yeares sithence had a child of M{r} Hamonds\r\n  to his Patient with whome he upon his first calling thither found\r\n  M{r} Thomas Bowden[208] with others Who after presentac͠on made by\r\n  the Motion of M{r} Warden Browne dyed, that he hath bin reported by\r\n  the ffather of the child to have murthered the child And that M{r}\r\n  Thomas Bowden had justifyed and would justify the same of w{ch}\r\n  scandall M{r} Warden complayneing to this Co{rt} M{r} Bowden prayed\r\n  to be excused from giveing any answer thereunto ffor that there was\r\n  a Suite at Law now depending betweene M{r} Hamond and M{r} Warden\r\n  Browne concerning that matter.\r\n\r\n  [208] Warden, 1654.\r\n\r\n23rd April, 1646. Mr. Martin Browne requested and had a Committee of\r\nExaminers to enquire into the case of Hamond’s child, and to report to\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1646. The Committee brought up their Report, finding that on\r\nthe 28th January, 1639, Mr. Browne was called to Mr. Hamond’s child\r\nin Bow Lane, the child having fallen out of a window and seriously\r\ninjured its head. That Mr. Browne consulted with Dr. Spicer and Mr.\r\nThomas Bowden (whom he found there) and as they all conceived the\r\nchild to be in danger, presentation was duly made to the Wardens of\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons, that thereupon by general consent, the child was\r\nlet blood and had a glister, and the next day his head was shaved\r\nand a cataplasm applied, that these remedies were continued for about\r\neight days and that then it was deemed advisable to open the head,\r\nwhich was done by Mr. Browne with a Trapan in the presence and with the\r\nadvice and approbation of Mr. Serjeant Clowes (then Master), Mr. George\r\nDunn[209] (Warden), Mr. William Kings,[210] Mr. Eaton and the said Mr.\r\nBowden, and that the child died on the 15th day, that proper remedies\r\nhad been duly applied and that everything had been done with great care\r\naccording to art.\r\n\r\n[209] Master, 1646.\r\n\r\n[210] Master, 1650.\r\n\r\n  23rd October, 1646.

The\r\n  remainder of the facts stated in this letter to the Archbishop are,\r\n  however, correct.\r\n\r\n  THAT the said Charter of Edward 4{th} not having provided by\r\n  sufficient penaltys against that great & growing mischeife which\r\n  sprung from the unskillfullness of several vain pretenders in this\r\n  art, It was provided by the Statute of the 3 H. 8, cap. 11 That no\r\n  person within London or seven miles of it should exercise Surgery\r\n  except they were first examined approved & admitted by the Bishop of\r\n  London or Dean of Paul’s calling to him four expert persons in that\r\n  faculty under forfeiture of five pounds pˀ month And out of the City\r\n  & precints seven miles, unless exaĩed & approved by the Bishop of the\r\n  Diocess or his Vicar Generall in like mañer, upon which Statute yo{r}\r\n  petitioners beg leave to observe That it was wholly introductive of a\r\n  new law & creates a power in the Bishop that was before vested in the\r\n  Company by the Charter, so doth it take care to confine that power\r\n  meerly to the Diocesan under the limitation of a regular examination\r\n  in his presence by four persons that had already passed their\r\n  examinations.\r\n\r\n  THE Bishop of each Diocess being therefore by their Law invested\r\n  with a Temporall power perfectly forreign to their Ecclesiasticall\r\n  Jurisdiction & Spirituall care We do humbly hope yo{r} Grace will not\r\n  exercise this authority which was never by this law placed in the\r\n  Metropolitane but was only to be exercised by the Diocesan under a\r\n  regular Examination by persons admitted into our Company. And yo{r}\r\n  Grace will find this the more reasonable upon Consideration of this\r\n  Act for the law makes it a part of the Ecclesiasticall concernment\r\n  upon a supposition that severall persons pretending to Surgery had\r\n  practised Sorcery & Witchcraft which yo{r} Grace will pardon us if\r\n  we beg leave to say was an artificiall notion set up by the popish\r\n  Clergy in those times to draw within their own Verge the Inspection &\r\n  approbation of all such persons as attended the beds of dying men.\r\n\r\n  BUT however that law was obtained, our Company which consisted of\r\n  all such persons as exercised Surgery within London or seven miles\r\n  being afterwards incorporated by the Statute of 32 H. 8, C. 42, no\r\n  man could practise within London or seven Miles Compass of the City\r\n  without an examination by four of the faculty thus incorporated &\r\n  without being solemnly admitted into the Company.\r\n\r\n  AND accordingly the Bishop of London has from time to time been\r\n  pleased to do us that Justice that we humbly presume yo{r} Grace will\r\n  not deny us, viz{t} not to license any person within his Diocess who\r\n  hath not first obtained a Testimoniall under the Seale of our Company\r\n  certifying the examination of such person & his skill & ability for\r\n  the exercise of that art.\r\n\r\n  BUT if this restraint of yo{r} Graces Licences were not to be asked\r\n  as a matter of Justice We should not doubt to obtain it as a favour,\r\n  when yo{r} Grace considers how this maner of entring into the faculty\r\n  opens a way to the Ignorant & unskillfull to the great prejudice\r\n  both of the Company & of the publick, for yo{r} Grace cannot be\r\n  so much at leisure from yo{r} pastorall care to enquire into the\r\n  abilitys of such as pretend to sign their Testimonialls nor is any\r\n  person that comes in by this method subject to the regulation of our\r\n  Company’s By-Laws which are all signed under the hands of the two\r\n  Cheife Justices & the present Lord Chancellour & contrived with the\r\n  greatest exactness to regulate the practise of this art, besides that\r\n  every person admitted is obliged to give bond to the Company that he\r\n  will diligently attend such cures as he shall be called unto & that\r\n  he will never wilfully administer any hurtfull medecine, And in all\r\n  cases of danger call in one of our ten Examiners to his assistance\r\n  who are always ready to afford their assistance when asked.\r\n\r\n  LASTLY we think we may add that the Companys services of the publick\r\n  may reasonably deserve some consideration from all lovers of the\r\n  publick for that ten of the principall persons of the faculty meet\r\n  once a week at their Hall to examine & approve all Surgeons &\r\n  Surgeons Mates that are in her Majesties Service which amount to five\r\n  hundred in a year & to inspect all Sea Surgeons Chests of medicines &\r\n  instruments & to peruse the Journalls of their practice & to view all\r\n  Sea officers who are wounded in fight & this without the least reward\r\n  nor are any admitted into the Sea Service without their Testimoniall\r\n  & approbation to the very great preservation of the Seamen And tis\r\n  presumed that a Regulation that has been found so necessary at Sea\r\n  will appear at Land to be equally beneficiall.\r\n\r\n  WHEREFORE yo{r} petitioners humbly begg that yo{r} Grace will not for\r\n  the future be pleased to give Lycences to any persons to practise\r\n  Surgery within London or seven miles compass thereof untill such\r\n  persons skill & ability for the exercise of that art appears by a\r\n  Testimoniall under our Companys Seale to have been tried & approved\r\n  of by the ten Examiners of our Company appointed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is no note of any reply to this letter having been received from\r\nthe Archbishop.\r\n\r\n6th February, 1711. The Court petitioned the Queen that they might have\r\nthe Examination and certifying of all Army Surgeons (who were then\r\nexamined by the Surgeon-General) in the same way that they examined and\r\npassed the Navy Surgeons.\r\n\r\n20th February, 1711.

W{m} Ogilby Rejected & said very Saucily it\r\n  should be the last time.\r\n\r\n  Alex{r} Keith Rejected because an Apothecary’s boy.\r\n\r\n  Edward Brown Rejected because a Barber.\r\n\r\n  James Erwin ffor a Mate and rejected for Sauciness to M{r} Blundell &\r\n  the Court.\r\n\r\n1st April, 1712.

Mr. Bartlett, a truss maker, having been summoned for\r\npractising Surgery, he was ordered “to take from his sign board that he\r\ncures Ruptures.”\r\n\r\n7th May, 1713. The Court having complained to the Bishop of London\r\nof the inconvenience arising from his licensing persons to practise\r\nSurgery, and the Bishop having informed the Company that he would not\r\nissue any more such licenses without a certificate of fitness from the\r\nCompany, it was thereupon ordered that 5 guineas should be paid yearly\r\nto his Lordship’s Registrar as Caveat money.\r\n\r\n  28th May, 1713.

The Master represented to the Court that “great\r\ntrouble and inconveniency” had arisen in consequence of such Surgeons\r\nas had of late offered themselves for examination not having presented\r\nthe Governors and Examiners “with Gloves of such sort and goodness as\r\nhad been customarily and antiently given to the Governors and Examiners\r\nupon such examinac͠on and by buying the gloves of tradesemen who were\r\nnot proper dealers in such sort of goods.” Whereupon it was ordered\r\nthat in future every Candidate before Examination should deposit with\r\nthe Clerk as much money as would be sufficient to pay each of the\r\nGovernors and Examiners who should be present six shillings, for them\r\nto lay out in the purchase of such gloves as they should see fit. On\r\nthe 10th December, 1725, the glove money was raised from 6_s._ to\r\n10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe real secret of the above order, no doubt was, that there were such\r\na great number of surgeons coming up for examination from time to time,\r\nthat the Governors and Examiners got less money and more gloves than\r\nthey wanted.\r\n\r\n  26th April, 1723. It is ordered that M{r} John Douglass Surgeon\r\n  and a fforeigne brother of this Company shall be admitted into the\r\n  freedom and Livery of this Company and be discharged and acquitted\r\n  from holding or paying any fine for his freedom or Livery, or for\r\n  all or any offices to the Parlour door as a Compliment to him for\r\n  introducing the new method of Cutting for the Stone and to express\r\n  the sense this Court hath of the usefullness therof.\r\n\r\n  4th September, 1724.

At this Court Thomas Cooke was examined for a\r\n  fforreigne Brother But being found insufficient he was rejected. Note\r\n  he lives in Duck Lane Publishes Bills as a Quack pretending to the\r\n  cure of the Venereall disease, but he being examined touching the\r\n  cure of that distemper in particular and being found to know little\r\n  or nothing of it, the Court directed him to take down his Surgeon’s\r\n  sign and not to practice for the future on pain of being sued upon\r\n  the Act of Parliament and Company’s Charter.\r\n\r\n1725. The following seems somewhat inappropriately placed amongst the\r\ndinner accounts for this year.\r\n\r\n  ~The~ CHARGES TO BE PAID BY THE MASTERS AND STEWARDS OF ANATOMY\r\n  FOR PROCURING A BODY BESIDES THE DINNER AT YE VISCERA LECTURE.\r\n\r\n                                                       _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n    Horsehire                                            2    6\r\n    For a Coach                                          6    0\r\n    For expenses in fetching the Body                    2    6\r\n    To the Sheriff’s officers                           13    4\r\n    To the Beadles assistant                             1    0\r\n    For Washing the Body                                 1    0\r\n    For a Coffin                                         5    0\r\n    To Parson Ground Clark and Sexton                    5   10\r\n    To the Bearers                                       2    0\r\n    Funeral expenses                                     2    6\r\n    For a certificate                                    0    6\r\n    The Clark’s fees                                    10    0\r\n    The 2 Beadle’s ffees                                10    0\r\n    For a Link                                           0    3\r\n    To the Chairwoman                                    5    0\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n                                                    £3   7    5\r\n                                                    ===========\r\n\r\n  14th October, 1726. At this Court Peter North Boatswain of His\r\n  Majesty’s ship Cornwall was viewed for superannuation and pretended\r\n  to be afflicted with deafness & the Gout. But the Court being of\r\n  opinion that his deafness (if any) was occasion{d} by wax in his ear\r\n  only, which might be cured by syringing, and not being satisfy{d}\r\n  that he had the gout, The Court did not think fit but that he was\r\n  capable of further service at Sea.\r\n\r\n  At this Court one Chambers surgeon in Duck Lane was examined touching\r\n  his Skill in Surgery in order to be made a fforeign brother, but\r\n  appearing to be a stupid ffellow & a sort of a Quack who gave out\r\n  Bills, and not being able to answer a question the Court rejected him.\r\n\r\n17th February, 1727. The Navy Board having, on the 16th inst., written\r\nto the Master and Wardens enclosing a copy of an anonymous letter\r\nwhich had been received, charging the Examiners in Surgery with\r\npartiality, and with qualifying incompetent persons as Navy Surgeons,\r\nthe Court seem to have taken the matter up in a high spirited manner,\r\nand returned a long letter setting forth their practice in conducting\r\nthe Examinations, referring in detail to the particular case alleged\r\nagainst them, and indeed made a most excellent and satisfactory\r\ndefence. The correspondence is very lengthy and full of detail, much\r\nreference being made to the work carried on by the Company for the\r\npublic service without fee or reward.\r\n\r\n  7th March, 1727. It is ordered That for y{e} future when any\r\n  apprentices are to be bound to Surgeons they shall be called in & be\r\n  examined by themselves touching their skil in y{e} Latin tongue.\r\n\r\n  7th April, 1727. James Ripoult a Frenchman was called in but not\r\n  speaking English nor being naturalized the Court did not think it\r\n  proper to examine him.\r\n\r\n  5th October, 1727. John Jacob Sax being a Prussian by birth & not\r\n  naturalized nor understanding English The Court did not think it\r\n  proper to examine him.\r\n\r\n  William Miles recomended by Lord Torrington & examined but seeming to\r\n  know nothing of Surgery was rejected.\r\n\r\n16th January, 1729. A Petition was drawn up by the Court for\r\npresentation to the King, setting forth the Company’s right to four\r\ndead bodies of felons yearly to be obtained at Tyburn, and that of\r\nlate divers riotous persons had wrested the bodies from the Company’s\r\nBeadles at the place of execution. The Court declared that these\r\nproceedings were greatly to the detriment of the study of Surgery, and\r\nalso set forth the services which the Company rendered to the State, by\r\nexamining Surgeons and their Mates for the Royal Navy, viewing their\r\nmedicine chests and instruments, viewing all such officers as are\r\nwounded in fight at Sea and for superannuation, and they conclude--\r\n\r\n  Your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that your Majesty will\r\n  be graciously pleased to permitt and direct That a ffyle or Two of\r\n  y{r} Majesty’s ffoot Guards shall upon applicac͠on to the Commanding\r\n  Officer attend the publick executions from time to time to guard\r\n  and assist your Petic͠oners Beadles in the taking away so many dead\r\n  bodys yearly as are granted unto your Petic͠oners by the said Act of\r\n  Parliament or otherwise to releive your Petic͠oners in such manner as\r\n  your Majesty in your Majesty’s most gracious wisdom and condescension\r\n  shall think fitt.\r\n\r\nThe Company seem also to have applied to the Court of Aldermen again\r\nfor assistance in this matter, for, on the 7th March following, it was\r\nordered that 2,000 copies of two orders of the Lord Mayor and Court\r\nof Aldermen, dated respectively 4th February and 4th March, should be\r\nprinted, and copies fixed up at Newgate and other public places on the\r\nroad to Tyburn, some time before any execution, and also that the said\r\norders should be inserted in the London Gazette and other papers.\r\n\r\n  4th April, 1729. Peregrine Compton Rejected being fuddled & not\r\n  answering a question.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1732. It was ordered that any extraordinary cases of\r\nSurgery appearing in the journals of the Sea Surgeons should be copied\r\nout into a book, as well as any others which might be reported to the\r\nGovernors, and the same be laid before the Court of Examiners, from\r\ntime to time, for their direction as to whether the same should be\r\npublished. This book, if it ever existed, is not now in the Company’s\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n  15th August, 1734. It is ordered that from henceforward a Silver\r\n  Medal not exceeding the value of a Guinea with a proper device upon\r\n  each side of it to be made and presented at the end of the year to\r\n  each of the Demonstrators now chosen and to the Demonstrators for the\r\n  time being as an acknowledgment for their trouble in performing such\r\n  Demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThese medals by a subsequent order, were to have a representation of\r\nHolbein’s picture on one side and of Inigo Jones’ Theatre on the other,\r\nbut they do not appear to have ever been struck.\r\n\r\nIt was customary at the Demonstrations of Anatomy to provide specimens\r\nof parts of animals, presumably for comparison, as appears by some of\r\nthe expenses incurred, _e.g._, in 1732:--\r\n\r\n  To a sheeps hart & kidney                            0  0  6\r\n  A sheeps hart and lights                             0  0  4\r\n  2 Bullocks eyes                                      0  0  4\r\n\r\nand the following is the Beadle’s Bill at the dissection of a female\r\nmalefactor in 1735:--\r\n\r\n  For a board to lay her head upon                     0  0  4\r\n  For a board to shew her liver upon                   0  1  0\r\n  For two bullocks eyes                                0  0  4\r\n  For four sheeps eyes                                 0  0  4\r\n  For a quarter of soap                                0  0  1-1/2\r\n  For hogs brissels                                    0  0  1\r\n  For a new spunge                                     0  0  3\r\n  For Borrowing a Hone to set the Instruments          0  0  3\r\n  For Sticking up the Bills                            0  2  6\r\n  For nine days attendance at 2{s} 6{d} p{r} Day       1  2  6\r\n                                                      ------------\r\n                                                      £1  7  8-1/2\r\n                                                      ============\r\n\r\n4th February, 1735. Under this date is an entry of a long letter from\r\nthe Commissioners of the Navy, complaining of the want of skill in a\r\nSurgeon, whereby great mortality had ensued on the ship _Newcastle_;\r\nthe Court examined the Surgeon and his Journal and considered that\r\nthere was nothing to find fault with as regarded his proficiency in\r\nSurgery, and that the sickness among the ship’s crew required skill\r\nin Physic rather than in Surgery, moreover they declared that the\r\nPhysician at Greenwich examined the Navy Surgeons as to their skill\r\nin Physic and not the Barber-Surgeons’ Company. The Clerk was directed\r\nto write to the Commissioners to this effect, and to state that the\r\nCompany did not consider themselves answerable for any man’s want of\r\nskill in Physic.\r\n\r\nA long letter dated 5th February was accordingly written and is set out\r\nin the Minute Book. The Surgeon complained of was Thomas Middleton, son\r\nof Mr. Henry Middleton (the oldest Member of the Court) and it appears\r\nthat he had been fully examined and qualified.\r\n\r\n29th September, 1735. The following order touching the vexed question\r\nof dead bodies was issued by the Sheriffs:--\r\n\r\n  ~London~ TO WITT\r\n\r\n  IN PURSUANCE of an Act of Parliament made in the Thirty second year\r\n  of King Henry the Eighth and of an order of Sessions bearing date\r\n  the eighth day of July in the Fifteenth year of our late Sovereign\r\n  Lord King Charles the First Sir Maurice Abbott Mayor. ~Wee~ do\r\n  order and command our Officers who are entrusted with or attend\r\n  the execution of such Malefactors as shall be to dye at any time\r\n  hereafter during our Sheriffalty to deliver to Henry Gretton and\r\n  William Littlebury Beadles of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons\r\n  of London or such other Officer or Officers as the Company shall\r\n  appoint, One of the Bodys of the said Malefactors from time to time\r\n  for a publick Dissection and to assist them with the said body to\r\n  their Hall according to an Order of the Court of Aldermen of the\r\n  Thirteenth of February 1675[221] Sir William Hooker Mayor and to two\r\n  other subsequent Orders of the Court of Aldermen one bearing date the\r\n  fourth day of February the other the fourth day of March 1728[222]\r\n  Sir Robert Baylis Knight Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n  [221] 1676 N.S.\r\n  [222] 1729 N.S.\r\n\r\n  Given under our hands this 29{th} day of September 1735.\r\n\r\n                                                  JN{O} BARNARD\r\n                                                  RO{T} GODSCHALL.\r\n\r\n  1st June, 1736. It is ordered that the Constables of the Holborn\r\n  Division shall be allowed Three Guineas and a halfe above the Guinea\r\n  already paid them in regard to their expences at the last execution,\r\n  when the Body was taken from the Beadles and retaken by the\r\n  Constables and the Clerk is ordered to repay the same But the Clerk\r\n  is not to pay the officers of the Compter the Two guineas usually\r\n  received by them at every execution.\r\n\r\n  24th September, 1741. John Thrift the Executioner this day attended\r\n  on a complaint made against him by the Beadles for obstructing the\r\n  Bodys being brought from Tyburne to the Hall for dissection and\r\n  threatning to prevent the Company’s measures for obtaining the same,\r\n  when after he had been reproved, was Dismissed, But the Court then\r\n  agreed (in order to prevent his intended proceedings) to attend the\r\n  Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen that they may on complaint made be\r\n  releived therein.\r\n\r\n  18th December, 1741. Ordered that the High Constable of Holburne be\r\n  allowed Ten shillings and sixpence as his ffee for every Body that\r\n  shall be brought from Tyburne and delivered at this Company’s Hall\r\n  and for his aiding and assisting the Company’s Beadles therein and\r\n  not otherwise.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1742. The Court either forgetting or ignoring their\r\norder of 7th May, 1713, now ordered that Mr. William Skelton, a proctor\r\nin Doctors’ Commons, who had for many years past received five guineas\r\nannually as Caveat money (being Registrar of the Bishop of London)\r\nand “pretended to be allowed him by this Company on account of his\r\nLordship’s Grant for the Prohibiting of Surgeons to practice within\r\nhis Diocese be no longer entitled to such fee untill such time as this\r\nCourt shall be better informed of the nature of his right of demanding\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\n23rd November, 1740. Great consternation prevailed at the Hall in\r\nconsequence of a malefactor who had been hung at Tyburn having revived\r\nwhen brought here for dissection. The account of this remarkable\r\noccurrence is recorded by the Clerk, Mr. Joseph Wheeler, on the last\r\npage of the rough Minute Book 1738-1742, and is very interesting.\r\nFrom the record of his trial at the Old Bailey (see Sessions Papers)\r\nDuell appears to have been an outrageous young scoundrel. A popular\r\nimpression prevails, and frequent currency has been given to it, that\r\nDuell subsequently made a fortune abroad and out of gratitude to the\r\nBarber-Surgeons for saving his life, presented them with the handsome\r\nleather folding screen now in the Court Room, the best answer to\r\nwhich is, that the screen in question is referred to in the Company’s\r\nInventory some thirty years previously to Mr. Duell’s visit to Tyburn.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler’s account is as follows--\r\n\r\n    November the 23{d.} 1740.\r\n\r\n  This day W{m.} Duell (who had been indicted at the Old Bayley for a\r\n  Rape and had received sentence of Death for the same) was carryed\r\n  to Tyburne in order to be executed where having hung some time was\r\n  cutt down and brought to this Company’s Hall in order to be dissected\r\n  where he had not been five minutes before Life appeared in him &\r\n  being let blood and other means used for his recovery in less than\r\n  two hours he sat upright drank some warm wine and lookˀd often round\r\n  him and before he was carryed back to Newgate which was about Twelve\r\n  o’the Clock at Night he severall times pronounced distinctly the\r\n  word DONT when anybody touched him though was thought to be mostly\r\n  insensible of anything but paine which in a great measure he endured\r\n  by his most violent screamings & was often in strong convulsions in\r\n  his bowells which he then exprest by applying his hands to those\r\n  parts.\r\n\r\n  The Sheriffs having ordered him back to Newgate he was carryed out in\r\n  a blankett putt into a Coach & was seemingly much composed & quiet\r\n  not making any manner of noise wherein 3 or 4 days time he recovered\r\n  sufficient to converse & eat & drink very freely but never could give\r\n  any reasonable account of what had passed. He afterwards obtained a\r\n  reprieve in order to be transported for life which he was accordingly\r\n  in the 16th year of his age. (_Vide_ his Tryall in the Sessions paper\r\n  of that time.)\r\n\r\nThe Wardens’ accounts give the following particulars relative to this\r\ncase:--\r\n\r\n                                                      £  _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  Paid the Beadles their expences in bringing\r\n    the last Body from Tyburne                        2   19    0\r\n\r\n  Paid the Officers of the Two Compters               2    2    0\r\n\r\n  Paid Joseph Wheeler the Company’s Clerk his\r\n    Coach hire and expences in attending the\r\n    Sheriffs when the Body came to life               0   10    0\r\n\r\n  Paid the Chairwoman for her trouble and\r\n    expences about the Body                           0    5    0\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar account of the foregoing circumstance will be found\r\nin Maitland’s London (ed. 1756), Vol. I, p. 613, and also in the\r\nGentleman’s Magazine, Vol. X, p. 570.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSURGICAL LECTURES AND DEMONSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many references throughout the books to the Lectures and\r\nDemonstrations of Anatomy at our Hall, as well as indications that\r\nfrom the period of Incorporation (1462), if not earlier, the Company\r\ntook care to provide for the professional education of its members and\r\napprentices, and to increase their proficiency in Surgical science.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The initial letter ~T~ is reduced from one in the Audit\r\nBook, 1612-13.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Examiners in Surgery (who though not necessarily\r\nmembers of the Court of Assistants were often consulted by the Masters\r\nor Governors) there were chosen “Masters and Stewards of the Anatomy,”\r\ngenerally two Masters and two Stewards, on whom devolved the duty of\r\nconducting the Demonstrations, and arranging for the Dinners which\r\ninvariably followed. The exact duties of these officials are not at all\r\ntimes clearly defined, though elsewhere will be found allusions to, and\r\norders concerning their offices and functions, but it may be generally\r\ntaken that the Stewards dissected and prepared the body, the Masters\r\nreading the Lectures thereon to the assembled Surgeons and their\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nThese Demonstrations usually took place four times in the year, and\r\nwere termed “Public Anatomies,” from the fact that the subject was\r\ngenerally a public body, _i.e._, a malefactor, and the attendance of\r\nthe free Surgeons was compulsory on these occasions; besides these\r\nPublic Anatomies, there were also an indefinite number of “Private\r\nAnatomies” held at the Hall, and at these the attendance was by\r\ninvitation. It was illegal for any one to dissect a “humane bodye”\r\nwithin the limits of the Company’s jurisdiction without the permission\r\nof the Masters or Governors, and whenever a Surgeon was desirous\r\nto anatomatize some specially interesting subject, it was termed a\r\n“Private Anatomy,” and generally performed at the Hall by permission,\r\nthe Surgeon inviting his own friends and pupils, and the Court inviting\r\nwhom they chose. (See the curious entry as to a Private Anatomy, page\r\n321.)\r\n\r\nBesides the Demonstrations of Anatomy, public and private, there were\r\nseveral other lectures delivered (oftentimes once a week) by members\r\nof the College of Physicians and members of the Company; two of these,\r\nwhich were trusts, the Arrisian Lecture and Gale’s Anatomy still\r\nsurvive I believe, at the Royal College of Surgeons; the others were\r\nprovided by the Company out of their corporate funds.\r\n\r\nAmong some loose papers at the Hall, I found a MS. relating to the\r\nlectures, which I lent to Mr. D’Arcy Power, who incorporated it in\r\nhis work, as “Appendix M.” I have since compared this document with the\r\noriginal minutes, and finding it somewhat incorrect and imperfect, have\r\nprepared the following more accurate account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE PAGE OF MINUTE BOOK. 16TH JANUARY, 1567.]\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1566 Dr. William Cunningham was Reader at the Hall. He was\r\nauthor of the “Cosmographical Glasse containing the pleasant principles\r\nof Cosmographie Geographie Hydrographie or Navigation,” London, 1599.\r\nfo. Dr. Cunningham resided at Norwich 1556-9, whence he removed to\r\nLondon. He wrote a letter prefacing John Hall’s book against the\r\n“beastlye abusers” of Surgery, which is dated at Coleman Street, 18th\r\nApril, 1565, and he also wrote a recommendatory letter in Thomas Gale’s\r\n“Certeine workes of Chirurgerie,” London, 1586. 4{to.}\r\n\r\n  14th January, 1567.

And as concerning the order for reading of lectures\r\n  in Surgerye by an approved surgion of this Companie, this Court did\r\n  againe deliberate upon the same and every one of the Assistants\r\n  declared his opinion therein and the pluralitie of voyces was to have\r\n  lectures read by the approved Surgians of this house according to our\r\n  ordinances and not by a Doctor of phisick.\r\n\r\n  20th December, 1632.

This Court taking into Considerac͠on in what\r\n  manner the publique Bodyes hereafter shalbe dissected and by whome\r\n  that Anatomy which is now newly about to be established shalbe\r\n  performed Doth thinke fitt and soe Order That the present M{rs} of\r\n  Anatomy or such others as shalbe appointed by the two M{rs} Surgeons\r\n  for the time being and the more part of the Examiners shall performe\r\n  the same and that the manner of dissections of every publique Anatomy\r\n  shalbe such as they the said Two M{rs} or Governo{rs} for the time\r\n  being and Examiners on the more part of them shall direct.\r\n\r\n30th January, 1646. The draft deed of settlement for the Arrisian\r\nLectures was brought into Court and (6th February, 1646) approved; but\r\nit appearing at the next Court that there was some technical difficulty\r\nas to the names of the feoffees it was remitted to the donor’s counsel.\r\n\r\n  20th February, 1646. This Court doth agree That the Deed of an\r\n  Annuity formerly granted to the use of the new publique Anatomy be\r\n  made for 24{li} upon the Considerac͠on of 300{li} And it is promised\r\n  by M{r} Arris on the behalfe of the Donor That if the 300{li} shalbe\r\n  restored within 12 yeares he or his Heires shall grant unto this\r\n  Company for the same use the like sum of 24{li} p. Annum out of some\r\n  of his Lands or Tenements And doe nominate and appoint for ffeeoffees\r\n  M{r} Dunn M{r} Collins M{r} Kings M{r} Pinder M{r} ffleete M{r} Arris\r\n  M{r} Boone and M{r} Bennett.\r\n\r\n  24th March, 1646. This daye M{r} Edward Arris payd the sum of 300{li}\r\n  to the use of this Company and is the purchase money for the Annuity\r\n  of 24{li} pˀ annũ for the use of the new publique Anatomy Whereupon\r\n  the Deed of Grant of the said Annuity and for establishing the said\r\n  new Anatomy was sealed with the Com̃on Seale and Delivered to the\r\n  Donor and the severall ffeoffees intrusted in that matter.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of our later Minutes being lost, it is not possible to\r\nsay precisely how this trust came to be varied and increased, though\r\nfrom the House of Commons Journals (see p. 160) it can be conjectured\r\nalmost to a certainty to have been as follows:--Within twelve years\r\nfrom the date of the original grant (say in 1658) the Company returned\r\nthe £300 to Alderman Arris, and he thereupon settled upon them a rent\r\ncharge, not of £24 as he had promised to do, but of £30 per annum\r\npayable out of some of his houses. He seems however, subsequently,\r\nto have had good reason to believe that his only son and heir, Dr.\r\nThomas Arris, M.P., would give the Company trouble in the matter of the\r\nsettlement, and so, on the 29th February, 1676, he requested that his\r\ndeed of grant might be given up to him cancelled, and that he should\r\nin return give the Company £510 absolutely and free from any trust,\r\nsave only an honorable understanding that the Anatomy Lectures should\r\nbe continued. This was done, and after his death (which happened 28th\r\nMay, 1676) the Company were involved in a Chancery suit with Dr. Thomas\r\nArris who endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to recover possession of\r\nthe £510.\r\n\r\n  17th July, 1646. Whereas 300{li} hath bin worthily given to this\r\n  House for the Discharge of all expences to be layd out in and about\r\n  a publique Anathomy to be henceforth had yearely for ever Betweene\r\n  the ffeaste of Michaelmas and Christmas in every yeare And for\r\n  that Doctor Prudjon who formerly read the Anatomicall Lectures\r\n  hath desired to be excused from reading the Lectures on the next\r\n  Anathomyes to be dissected betweene Michaelmas and Christmas next\r\n  This Court doth think fitt That Doctor Wright be desired to performe\r\n  the same And that the M{rs} of the Anatomy for the time being When\r\n  the said Anatomy shalbe dissected do alwayes in theire severall &\r\n  respective times of M{rs} of Anatomy dissect the said Anatomy And\r\n  this Court doth thinke fitt That the dissection of the said Anatomy\r\n  be of the Muscles of the Body But that the manner thereof be left to\r\n  the Judgement of the Reader and the Dissectors.\r\n\r\n  21st September, 1646. Our M{r} acquainting the Court that Doctor\r\n  Prudjon and divers other learned Physitions have recõmended Doctor\r\n  [John] Goddard as a Man well qualifyed and very able to reade the\r\n  Anatomicall Lectures This Court doth Order That Doctor Prudjon be\r\n  requested to performe the Lectures On the next publique Anatomy\r\n  himselfe But if he shall Deny it That then Doctor Goddard Or such\r\n  other as Doctor Prudjon shall thinke more fitt be desired to read the\r\n  Lectures.\r\n\r\n  23rd October, 1646. This Court doth Order That all the approved\r\n  Chirurgeons according to Law shall appeare at all publique Anatomyes\r\n  for the time to come in a fflatt Capp upon the penalty of 3{s} 4{d}\r\n  and all the rest of the Livery in a Hatt.\r\n\r\n  24th December, 1646. This Court doth thinke fitt and soe Order That\r\n  the M{rs} or Governours and Assistants nor any of them Nor any of\r\n  the M{rs} or Stewards of Anathomy doe invite or enterteyne any\r\n  Guest at any of the Three Dinners to be had within this Hall at the\r\n  next publique Anatomy Or at any other publique Anathomy betweene\r\n  Michaelmas and Christmas in any yeare hereafter But doth consent &\r\n  Order That Doctor Prudjon be invited to the said Dinners Anything\r\n  aforesaid to the contrary Notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n  7th January, 1647. Whereas this Court is well satisfyed That Doctor\r\n  Prudjon is desireous to be excused from reading the next Anatomicall\r\n  Lectures This Court doth Order That Doctor Goddard be desired to\r\n  performe the same.\r\n\r\n  15th February, 1647. This Court doth thinke fitt and soe Order That\r\n  the Tuesday Lectures be againe revived and read by Chirurgeons\r\n  ffreemen of this Company in their turnes according to theire\r\n  authority[226] in the Livery.

The\r\ncover still indicates the elaboration of the bookbinder’s art, being\r\nstamped in patterns with the portcullis fleur de lys and Tudor rose;\r\nopposite what is left of the first page is a magnificently painted\r\nachievement of the Company’s arms on vellum, but this unhappily, is\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nThe first page has rotted almost entirely away, leaving only the upper\r\nleft hand corner, on which there is an initial letter T illuminated in\r\nthe highest style of art, though this is also seriously damaged.\r\n\r\nThe accounts commence with those for the year 1603, the first few pages\r\nare worn away, pages 7 to 36 are but slightly damaged, whilst the\r\nremainder of this huge book is quite perfect and abounds with quaint\r\nand artistic initial letters.\r\n\r\nThe following is the reduced initial letter for the year 1610-11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1603.

1_s._\r\n\r\n£5 was received for the admission of six foreign brethren.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five freemen were admitted, who paid 3_s._ 4_d._ each on\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nEighty-nine apprentices were

At the end of the book is a long and detailed\r\nlist of the contributors, commencing 23rd April, 1668, and extending\r\nto March, 1681. There seem to have been 398 subscribers, and the sum\r\ncollected from them was £1,850; this amount, however, was wholly\r\ninadequate for the rebuilding of the hall, which appears by entries\r\nextending over 1668 to 1674, to have cost the Company no less than\r\n£4,292. The deficit was made up by sales of freehold property in the\r\nCity, for what to us, in these days, would seem absurdly low prices,\r\nand by loans, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARBER-SURGEONS’ HALL, 1674-1864.]\r\n\r\n1668-9.

And again in the ordinances signed by Sir Thomas More, it states\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  yff any matter of stryffe or debate herafter be betwene eny pˀson\r\n  of the said Crafte as God fforfende that noon of them shall make\r\n  eny pˀsuts[274] in the Comen lawe but that he whiche ffyndeth hym\r\n  aggreved shall ffurst make his complaynt to the Maisters . . . . . .\r\n  to thˀentent that they shall ordre the said matter or cause of\r\n  complaynt so made yff they can . . . . . .\r\n\r\n  [274] Pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis prerogative of the Company was jealously guarded, and indeed\r\nextended, the Court becoming in effect a sort of Court of Conscience,\r\nin which _non-freemen_ frequently appeared as plaintiffs against\r\nfreemen, when their cases were heard and adjudicated upon, the Court\r\nsettling the amount and time of payment, or dismissing the suit.\r\n\r\nWhenever (as often happened) one freeman went to law with another,\r\nwithout leave of the Court, and the defendant complained, the\r\nplaintiff was ordered to withdraw his action, and if he declined to do\r\nso, an opportunity of reflection upon the powers of the Company was\r\nafforded him in the seclusion of the “Compter.”\r\n\r\nIt was frequently the custom for the Masters to require both parties to\r\nenter into bonds to abide the decision of the Court, and where this was\r\nnot so, and either of them disobeyed the order made, the offender was\r\neither fined, imprisoned or expelled.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few notices of cases of dispute which came before\r\nthe Court from time to time, and other instances will be found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n30th June, 1551. It was ordered--\r\n\r\n  That James Wood John Chamber and William Drewe Waterman shalbe lovers\r\n  and friendes and clerlye to acquite and discharge either other of and\r\n  from all maner of acc͠ons quarrells detts demaundes and suts as well\r\n  spirytuall as temporall whatsoever they be from the begynnyng of the\r\n  worlde untyll the daye abovesayd.\r\n\r\n4th November, 1551. Ordered--\r\n\r\n  That John West shall bring in his fyne which is vj{s} viij{d} for\r\n  speking opprobryous wordes against John Androwson in the presence of\r\n  the M{r.}\r\n\r\n2nd May, 1552. It was ordered and declared that Harry Cooke and\r\nNicholas Connysbye--\r\n\r\n  are fully condescended concluded and agreed for all maner of acc͠ons\r\n  dettes suetts demaunds and quarrells whatsoever they be from the\r\n  begynnynge of the worlde unto this daye and that they shall clerly\r\n  dischardge eche other and to be lovers and freinds.\r\n\r\n1566. By an entry in this year it seems that each disputant when before\r\nthe Court was “put to his othe upon a booke y{t} he sholde saye the\r\ntrothe.”\r\n\r\n10th December, 1566. Thomas Lambkyn appeared against his late\r\napprentice W{m} Woodfall--\r\n\r\n  for serten shavynge clothes y{t} he tooke awaye w{th} hym when he\r\n  went frome his M{r} w{th}out his lycence and the saide W{m} hath\r\n  payde unto the saide Thom̃s Lambkyn in the pˀsents of this courte in\r\n  lawfull Englyshe mony x{s} in recompence.\r\n\r\n  In this Courte here was John Hawkes playntyf agaynst Richard Olkar\r\n  for his unfyttinge words & Olkar shalbe here the nexte courte.\r\n\r\n30th December, 1566. William Collins the covenant servant of John\r\nJohnson complained of his master for “myssusing hym in his boxe money,”\r\nwhereupon M{r} Johnson was ordered to amend his ways.\r\n\r\n  4th March, 1567. Here was Walter Lynche for his unfytting wordꝭ\r\n  seyeng y{t} Richard Dycson sholde be got his mayde w{th} chylde and\r\n  Lynche denyeth yt, y{t} he nevˀ harde of yt, and Dycson sey{d} y{t}\r\n  Edward Parke & too other servyngemen he hath to wytnes the same,\r\n  spoken at the Rose taverne at the fleete brydge And yt is ordered\r\n  y{t} they shall brotherly one gyve unto & by another good wordꝭ &\r\n  good reports & no more repetallꝭ to be had any more hereafter in this\r\n  behalf.\r\n\r\n  11th March, 1567. In this Court here was John Wall for y{t} he warned\r\n  John Staple unto the courte of concyence in the guyldehall in London\r\n  w{th}oute lycence of the M{r} & Govˀno{rs} and yt is now ordered\r\n  once agayne y{t} John Wall shall not pˀcede any forder in lawe but\r\n  shall stande to the awarde made ordered & awarded the xij{th} daye\r\n  of november laste paste and not ells otherwyse upon payne of his\r\n  alegiance & penaltie in that behalf pˀvyded & ordayned.\r\n\r\nEdward Park, who was a troublesome fellow, and often before the Court,\r\nwould seem (by the next extract) to have revived the old scandal about\r\nDycson and his “mayde,” for--\r\n\r\n  14th November, 1567. Here was Rich. Dycson playntyf agaynst Edward\r\n  Parke for undecent and slaunderous words And they both have consented\r\n  to put yt unto the determynacion of this worsshypfull Court, & they\r\n  shalbe both bounde in oblygacions to abyde the order & warde[275] &\r\n  to kepe the peace in y{r} owne pˀsons. Rich. Dycson hath chosen to\r\n  be arbytraytors for hym John Bonar & Thomas Burston, and for Parke\r\n  he hath chosen for hym M{r} Bowie & Rich Wysto & the M{r} & govnors\r\n  shalbe umpers,[276] bonde in xx{li} a peece.\r\n\r\n  [275] Award.\r\n  [276] Umpires.\r\n\r\n  13th January, 1568. In thys Courte here was John Cooke playntyf\r\n  against Rich{d} Barker for serten wordꝭ undecently spoken by Rich{d}\r\n  against the said John and also for serten housold stuff y{t} the said\r\n  Rich{d} Barker w{th}holdeth frome the said John, and they both are\r\n  comaunded the nexte courte daye to brynge in bothe y{r} fynes vj{s}\r\n  viij{d} a pece for y{r} unfytting wordꝭ.\r\n\r\n  7th June, 1569. In this Courte here was the wyf of John Burges for\r\n  that Rich. Barker beate black her armes and yt is ordered that the\r\n  said Rich. Barker shall upon this pˀsent daye go unto the house of\r\n  the said John Burges his m{r} and y{r} acknowledge hym sylf to be\r\n  sory for trespassynge hym & his wyf.\r\n\r\n  19th July, 1569. Here was John Charnock, said that he is his M{rs}\r\n  pntꝭ[277] & kepeth shoppe & is accomptant wekely to his M{r} & he\r\n  said the M{r} of the company did hym wronge & y{t} he wolde at\r\n  lawe trye yt and unreverently he did behave hymsylf w{th} stoute\r\n  & undecent [words] & so he charged the M{r} styll, but not the\r\n  worsshypfulls of this Courte.\r\n\r\n  [277] Apprentice.\r\n\r\n  18th November, 1572. Here was one Edward Browne Bricklayer and\r\n  complayned [against] one Richard Upton for that he had taken his\r\n  money for curynge hym of Morbus Gallicus but the sicknes as he said\r\n  was not cured & M{r} Upton pˀmised to agree w{th} hym.\r\n\r\nThe next is a rare piece of tittle tattle; like Edward Park, Colley\r\nwas often in trouble, and it is amusing to observe how he shortly\r\nafterwards lays an information against Carrington, which compliment\r\nCarrington returns to him in the March Court.\r\n\r\n  18th November, 1572. Here was Willm̃ Carington and required his\r\n  complaint to be herd in that Allein Colley had slaundered hym w{th}\r\n  unhonest wordes, that is, that Allein should say that Wiberds wife\r\n  should say that Charringtons wief should not be honest, and they were\r\n  pˀmytted to take ordre of Lawe.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1573. Colley laid an information against Carrington for\r\n“Trimminge on a Sondaye,” whereupon he was fined 40_s._\r\n\r\n11th March, 1573. Carrington complained of Colley “for undecent wordes\r\ncalling him verlet before the Mr.,” etc., and they were ordered to be\r\nfriends, and to bring no more complaints against each other.\r\n\r\nThis feud seems, however, to have continued for a few years, but was at\r\nlast happily settled, for we read under date, 24th January, 1576:\r\n\r\n  Here at this Co{r}te witnesses being hard betwene Willm̃ Carrington\r\n  and Allen Collye they were made frendes, shoke handes and frendly\r\n  depˀted.\r\n\r\n  2nd March, 1573. Here was a complaint agaynste Henrye Lushe by John\r\n  Parradize for that the said Henry Lushe called the said John Paradize\r\n  knave, and he p{d} his fyne xij{d} and they toke hands & were ffrends.\r\n\r\n  19th April, 1574. Here was Willm̃ Brode and brought in an answere\r\n  agaynste the complaynt of Edward Saunders for lykeninge hym to\r\n  Esoppes dogge and they were appoynted to be ffrends and to brynge the\r\n  matter no more in question.\r\n\r\nWas this the “dog in the manger”? Anyhow, it seems a trivial matter to\r\nhave been brought before the grave old Masters.\r\n\r\n  2nd February, 1575. Here came one Willm̃ Goodnep and complayned of\r\n  Willm̃ Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was\r\n  awarded that the saide Clowes sholde either geve the saide Goodnep\r\n  xx{s} orells cure his saide wief, w{ch} Clowes agreed to pay the\r\n  xx{s} and so they were agreed and eche of them made acquittance to\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  28th February, 1576. Here was a complainte against Willm̃ Clowes\r\n  by one Goodenge for that the saide Clowes had not onlie misused\r\n  the saide Goodinge in speeche but also most of the masters of the\r\n  Companye w{th} scoffing wordes and jestes and they all forgave him\r\n  here openlye in the Co{r}te and so the stryfe was ended upon condˀ\r\n  that he shold nev{r} so misuse him self a gayne, and bonds was caused\r\n  to be made to that effect.\r\n\r\n  25th September, 1576. At this Coˀte came Willm̃ Wise and Mathew Ken,\r\n  and divers evell and unbrotherlike speches was pˀved and so the saide\r\n  Willm̃ Wise confest his falt paide his ffyne and made a breakfast to\r\n  the Companie for their paynes, and so they shoke hands and were made\r\n  ffrends.\r\n\r\n  25th March, 1577. Here at this Corte was a greate contension and\r\n  stryffe spoken of and ended betwene George Baker[278] and Willm̃\r\n  Clowes[279] for that they bothe contrary to order and the good and\r\n  holsome rules of this howse misused eche other and fought in the\r\n  ffelds togethers, but the M{r} Wardens and assistance wishing that\r\n  they might be and continewe loving brothers pˀdoned this greate\r\n  offence in hope of amendment.\r\n\r\n  [278] Master 1597 and Serjeant Surgeon.\r\n  [279] Warden 1594.\r\n\r\n  9th January, 1598. Thomas Cole complayned of Thomas Goodall for\r\n  sueinge him at the Comon lawe w{th}out license of the M{rs} And was\r\n  fined And his fine mittigated to 3{s} 4{d}\r\n\r\n  4th December, 1599. This daie Roberte Morrey complayned of William\r\n  ffoster for callinge him Pandor and Bawde and for sayeinge he was\r\n  presented by the Wardemot inqueste for keepinge a bawdye house, uppon\r\n  hearinge whereof their controversies were referred to the Maisters of\r\n  this Companye, the same to be ended before the sixte daie of Januarye\r\n  nexte.\r\n\r\n  24th July, 1600. In the matter in Controversie betwixt Roger Semper\r\n  and ffrancis Thompson it is ordered that the sayd Sempˀ shall at the\r\n  next Court bringe in his fine for usinge reprochefull wordes against\r\n  the sayd Thompson And for that the sayd Sempers wyefe did assalt the\r\n  sayd Thompson & brake his shop wyndowes. And that the sayd Semper\r\n  shall delivˀ such goodes as hee hath of the sayd Thompson before\r\n  the next Court And that hee shall at the same Court geve the sayd\r\n  Thompson satisfacc͠on for his wyndowes.\r\n\r\n  24th July, 1600. In the Controversie betwixt John Izard & Robert\r\n  Steward it is ordered that the sayd Robert Steward shalbe comitted to\r\n  the Compter for refusinge to paye his fine for supplantinge the sayd\r\n  John Izards cure and for behavinge himselfe unreverendly before the\r\n  M{rs} in the Court.\r\n\r\n  11th September, 1600. This daie John Urvey complayned of Henry Bracye\r\n  for arrestinge him before he had obtayned leave of the Maisters And\r\n  it was thereuppon ordered that the said Henrye Bracye shoulde be\r\n  warned to appeare before the Maisters at the nexte Courte and that he\r\n  shoulde be commaunded from the Maisters to staie his suite till then.\r\n\r\n  17th September, 1600. This daie in the matter in controversi betwixte\r\n  Henry Bracy and John Urvey It is ordered that the saide Henry Bracye\r\n  shall not proceede any further in his suite but that the said John\r\n  Urvey shall paie the debte of ffowerteene shillinges and twoe\r\n  shillinges for his chardges by twoe shillinges wickelye till all be\r\n  fully satisfied and paide And uppon the payment thereof the said\r\n  Bracye to make him a generall acquittaunce the firste payment to\r\n  begine on Tewsdaie nexte, And the money to be paide to the M{rs} of\r\n  this Companye.\r\n\r\n  20th October, 1600. This daye it is ordered that John Urvey shalbe\r\n  comitted to the Compter for not pˀforminge his payments to Henry\r\n  Bracy accordinge to the orders of this howse.\r\n\r\n  21st July, 1601. Where div{s} controversies hath bene betweene John\r\n  Browne and Jenkin Marcrafte the endinge of w{ch} is by them of their\r\n  mutuall assents referred to the M{rs} or Governors of this Company\r\n  who aft{r} hereinge of their sevˀall controversies & fyndeinge\r\n  thereby that the wounde for w{ch} the money was to be paid to John\r\n  Browne was reverted to his former state It is thought fit that the\r\n  said Marcrafte shall paye to the said Browne pñˀtly[280] the somme of\r\n  xl{s} in full satisfacc͠on of all debts duties and demaunds, w{ch}\r\n  the said Browne accepted of and received the said somme accordingly.\r\n  And whereas Lewis Atm{r} finished the Cure after it was reverted\r\n  Therefore it was lykewise ordered that the said Marcrafte shall paye\r\n  to him xx{s} for his paynes.\r\n\r\n  [280] Presently, _i.e._, at once.\r\n\r\n  6th August, 1601. This daye John Ibatson and John Wyndet referred\r\n  a controversie betwene them concerninge a debt of iiij{li} lent by\r\n  the said Wyndet to the said Ibatson to the hereinge & endinge of the\r\n  M{rs} of this Company and gave the eyth{r} to the oth{r} 6{d} to\r\n  stande to their award so that they ended the same before the laste\r\n  daye of Septemb{r} next w{ch} if they refuse to stand to, the refuser\r\n  shall forfeyt x{li.}\r\n\r\n  27th March, 1604. This daye Lycence is geven to Andrew Mathewe to sue\r\n  Richard Tyler at the Com̃on Lawe for the tenemˀt wherein the said\r\n  Tyler nowe dwelleth, for that Tyler refuseth to referre the heareinge\r\n  & endinge of that controversie to the M{rs} of this Company.\r\n\r\n  16th October, 1610. In the Controvˀsie between William Wright and one\r\n  Harrington Itt is att this Court ordered that Harrington shall paie\r\n  unto Wryght for and in respect of such rentes he doth owe unto Wright\r\n  the some of xxx{s} imediate And like wise he shall mend such paynes\r\n  of glasse as nowe by his necligence are broken in Wrightꝭ wyndowes\r\n  and soe all controvˀsies between them are determyned.\r\n\r\n  24th September, 1611. In the Controvˀsey between ffrauncꝭ Bilford of\r\n  thˀone pˀte & John fflint on thˀother pˀte It is ordered that either\r\n  of them shalbe bound unto thˀother of them in 20{li} a peece to stand\r\n  to the Award of M{r} John Gerard & M{r} Richard Mapes.\r\n\r\n  1st October, 1611.

In the complaint made by William Purkꝭ and ffrauncis\r\n  his wife against Greene, w{ch} beinge heard at this Court, the M{rs}\r\n  could drawe them to noe quiet ende, all pˀties being verye obstinate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHERALDRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous excellent examples of the Company’s Arms at the\r\nHall. The records contain many beautiful drawings and emblazoned\r\nshields of arms, not only of the Company but of some of the Masters as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nOne of the choicest specimens is the massive old carving beneath the\r\nsemicircular canopy of the entrance doorway; this is dated 1671, and\r\nis both bold and quaint; long may it be preserved to the Barbers!\r\nThe carved coat of arms which formerly ornamented the stern of the\r\nCompany’s barge, and which is probably late 17th century work, has\r\nbeen carefully preserved, and may be always admired over the chimney\r\npiece in the Committee room. There is the large “tortershell” in the\r\nvestibule given by Mr. William Kings in 1645. The cloth on the Court\r\ntable is artistically embroidered with the Arms of the Company and\r\nthe City, the embroidered portions being part of the ancient barge\r\ncloth. There is a handsomely emblazoned coat of arms on the plan of\r\nthe Company’s property (presented by Mr. Charles John Shoppee), and\r\na pretty little bit of old stained glass in the window on the first\r\nfloor landing. The Company formerly possessed a great many banners, but\r\nthese are unfortunately lost to us; the one which is placed behind the\r\nMaster’s chair is beautifully painted by Bishop of Doctors’ Commons,\r\nand has at the back the inscription--\r\n\r\n    EX DONO SIDNEY YOUNG MISTERII BARBITONSORUM FRATRIS AMANDI 1885.\r\n\r\n1451. In this year the original grant of arms was conferred, being\r\nsimply the first quarter of our present achievement; sable, a chevron\r\nbetween three fleams argent, the fleams being mediæval lancets, though\r\nfrom their shape they have sometimes been thought to represent razors.\r\nThis coat was borne by both the Barbers and their successors, the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, until the time of Elizabeth. The grant is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat of arms]\r\n\r\n  ~Be~ it knowen to all men that y Clarensew Kyng of Armes of the\r\n  South Marche of Englond Consideryng the noble estate of the Cite of\r\n  London by the name of Erle & Barons as in their ffirst Charter by\r\n  scripture appereth and as now called mayre and aldermen and by good\r\n  avyce of all the aldermen and the noble citezenis of London that\r\n  every alderman shuld have award by hymself to governe and rule to\r\n  the Worship of the cite and the maires power evˀy alderman in his\r\n  Ward with correccion of the mair beyng for the tyme and so notablie\r\n  ordeyned to be custumed evˀy Craft clothing be hem self to know o\r\n  Craft from a nother and also synes of Armes in baner wyse to beer\r\n  conveniently for the worship of the reame and the noble cite and so\r\n  now late the Maisters of Barbory and Surgery within the craft of\r\n  Barbours John Strugge Thomas Wyllote Hugh Herte & Thomas Waleys come\r\n  & praying me Clarensewe Kyng of Armes to devise hem a conysauns &\r\n  syne in fourme of armes under my seall of myn Armes that might be\r\n  conveniently to ther Craft. And where y Clarensewe Kyng of Armes\r\n  consideryng the gode disposicion of them y have devysed a Conysaunce\r\n  in fourme of Armes that is to sey A felde sabull a cheveron bytwene\r\n  iij flemys of silver the which syne of armes y Clarensew gyve the\r\n  same conysaunce of Armes to the forsaid Crafte and none other Crafte\r\n  in no wyse shall not bere the same. ~To~ the which witenesse of this\r\n  wrytyng y sette my seal of myn armes & my syne manuall wreten atte\r\n  London the xxix day of the monthe of September the xxx{th} yere of\r\n  the regne of oure soverayne lord Kyng Henry the Sixt.\r\n\r\n                                        By CLARANSEW Kynge of armes.\r\n\r\n1492. In this year a cognizance, or possibly an informal grant of arms,\r\nwas given to the Surgeons’ Company; this is depicted on the first\r\nleaf in the beautiful old vellum book of Ordinances at the Hall, the\r\ninscription under, stating that it was given to the Craft of Surgeons\r\nof London in the year 1492, at the going over the sea into France of\r\nHenry VII. (_See_ the fac-simile at p. 69.)\r\n\r\nNo other authority than the above statement is known for this coat, but\r\nin the grant to the Barber-Surgeons (1569) it is recited that Henry\r\nVIII granted the Company of Surgeons a cognizance “which is a spatter\r\nthereon a rose gules crowned golde for their warrant in fielde but\r\nno authoritie by warrant for the bearinge of the same in shilde as\r\narmes.” The Herald in drawing the grant of 1569 probably accidentally\r\nput in the name of Henry VIII for that of Henry VII, the entry in our\r\nbook being undoubtedly coeval with the circumstance. We here get the\r\nfoundations of our present coat of arms; the fleams representing the\r\nold Barber-Surgeons or Barbers, and the crowned rose and spatula the\r\nSurgeons proper, both of which were introduced into one shield in 1561,\r\nand quartered in 1569.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the shield of the Surgeons’ Arms stands a Saint\r\nhabited as a doctor or physician, one of whom holds a medical vessel in\r\nhis right hand, while the other has a box of ointment and a spatula,\r\nindicative of their being professors of the healing art. These are the\r\npatron Saints of the Company, Cosmus and Damianus. Mrs. Jameson states\r\nthat they--\r\n\r\n  were two brothers, Arabians by birth but they dwelt in Ægæ, a city of\r\n  Cilicia. Their father having died while they were yet children, their\r\n  pious mother Theodora, brought them up with all diligence, and in the\r\n  practice of every Christian virtue. Their charity was so great, that\r\n  not only they lived in the greatest abstinence, distributing their\r\n  goods to the infirm and poor, but they studied medicine and surgery,\r\n  that they might be able to prescribe for the sick, and relieve the\r\n  sufferings of the wounded and infirm; and the blessing of God being\r\n  on all their endeavours, they became the most learned and the most\r\n  perfect physicians that the world had ever seen. They ministered to\r\n  all who applied to them, whether rich or poor. Even to suffering\r\n  animals they did not deny their aid, and they constantly refused all\r\n  payment or recompense, exercising their art only for charity and for\r\n  the love of God; and thus they spent their days.\r\n\r\nIn the cover of a Latin Bible, printed in 1470, I discovered some\r\nvellum padding, which on examination proved to be a MS. of XIth\r\ncentury, consisting of part of a collection of the lives of the\r\nSaints, interspersed with prayers, etc., and which probably had been\r\nread in some Convent refectory during the hours of meals. This MS. is\r\nmoreover curious, as those portions intended to be sung have certain\r\nsigns affixed, known as “neumes,” which, before the more modern method\r\nof musical notation was introduced, were employed to denote musical\r\nexpression. An account of the martyrdom of Cosmo and Damian, together\r\nwith their brothers, is here preserved, but as the original is in very\r\ncontracted Latin, the following translation will, perhaps, better\r\nsupply its place:--\r\n\r\n  The souls of Cosmus and Damianus the Just are in the hands of God.\r\n\r\n  There have moreover been crowned these five brothers Cosmus,\r\n  Damianus, Antimeus, Leuntius and Eutrepius.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore we beseech Thee, Almighty God, to grant that we, who\r\n  commemorate the nativities of thy Saints Cosmus and Damianus, may by\r\n  their intercessions be delivered from all present and future evils.\r\n  Amen. The blessed martyrs Cosmus Damianus, Antimeus, Leuntius and\r\n  Eutrepius, were committed to prison by order of the governor; and\r\n  on the following day, the proconsul sitting on the judgment seat,\r\n  caused an enormous fire to be made, and the above-named men to be\r\n  led out of prison and cast into its midst. But on account of their\r\n  prayers the fire lost its power over these saints. The governor was\r\n  astounded, and the executioner, thinking that the circumstances which\r\n  had happened with regard to the martyrs of God depended on their\r\n  magical arts, ordered them to be again interrogated. But, when they\r\n  remained firm with a cheerful and joyous countenance rendered more\r\n  noble by torture, he ordered crosses to be made, and the martyrs,\r\n  when stretched upon them, to be pelted with stones. Accordingly,\r\n  when the blows recoiled on those that delivered them, the governor,\r\n  inflamed with excessive rage, gave orders to attack them with arrows,\r\n  so that at a less distance the steel might at least penetrate. But,\r\n  although he had not been able to injure them in any way, many of\r\n  those who discharged arrows and who stood near withdrew on account of\r\n  the wounds that they received.\r\n\r\n  For so is the testimony.\r\n\r\n  Seeing accordingly that his ill will was overcome by Divine power,\r\n  the governor ordered them to be mutilated with a sword.\r\n\r\n  The blessed martyrs were put to death on the Twentieth day of\r\n  September; and their bodies were buried by devout men in a holy spot\r\n  not far from the city of Ægae.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jameson relates a legend somewhat similar to the above, and states\r\nthat it was of great antiquity, being transplanted into Western Europe\r\nin the first ages of Christianity. The Emperor Justinian, having been\r\nrecovered, as he supposed, from a dangerous illness by the intercession\r\nof these saints, erected a superb church in their honour. Among the\r\nGreeks they succeeded to the worship and attributes of Æsculapius;\r\nand from their disinterested refusal of all pay or reward, they are\r\ndistinguished by the honourable title of Anargyres, which signifies\r\nmoneyless, or without fees. These saints are commemorated on the 27th\r\nSeptember, and all over Europe have ever been the patron saints of the\r\nBarbers and Surgeons; they are also the patrons of the Medici family,\r\nand as such they figure on the coins of Florence.\r\n\r\n1540. In the bowl of the grace cup given by Henry VIII to the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, the arms of the Barbers impaling the Surgeons are cut,\r\nbut this is merely the fancy of an engraver, and of later date than the\r\ncup.stration]\r\n Pg468\r\n\r\n10th July, 1561. In the Heralds’ College (I.C.B., No. 101, 20) is\r\na grant of arms by William Harvey, Clarencieux King of Arms, to\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons, in which he grants and assigns unto them for\r\nan “augmentac͠on to ther old and aunscint Armes (which is sables a\r\nchevrone between thre flumes argent) a chef paly argent & vert on a\r\npale goles a lyon passant regardant gold betwene two spatters argent a\r\nroze gewles crowned golde & to ther creast upon the healme an opinacus\r\ngolde standing upon a wreath argent and sables manteled gewles dubled\r\nargent.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1565. This year, Harvey, Clarencieux, granted two supporters to the\r\nabove arms, namely, “two lynxe in their proper Collor about there necks\r\na crowne with a cheyne argent.”\r\n\r\n1568. This year, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, Kings of Arms,\r\nratified and confirmed the above arms, crest, and supporters, with\r\nthe following variations, the arms to be borne quarterly, “the ffyrst\r\nsables a cheveron bytwyne iij flewmes argent, the second quarter per\r\npale argent and vert on a spatter of the fyrst a Dobele rose gules and\r\nargent crowned or, over all on a crosse gules a lyon passant Regardant\r\nor.”\r\n\r\n12th June, 1569. The grant of Arms by Dethick, etc., is a beautifully\r\nartistic production, though, unfortunately, slightly damaged, and\r\nthe seals are missing. In 1885 the Company had it reproduced in\r\nchromo-photography by Mr. William Griggs, whose work has been so\r\nskilfully executed that it is difficult to observe the least difference\r\nbetween the original and the copies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith this grant is the first appearance of a motto “De præscientia\r\nDei.” How this motto came to be chosen, or in what way it applies to\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons, I am at a loss to point out. The following is the\r\ntext of the grant.\r\n\r\n  ~To~ all and singuler aswell Kinges herehaultes and Officers of\r\n  Armes, as nobles gentlemen and others to whome these presentes shall\r\n  come be seene heard, read or understand Sir Gilbert Dethicke Knight\r\n  alias Garter principall Kinge of Armes, Robert Cooke Esquire alias\r\n  Clarencieulx kinge of Armes of the South partes of Englande, and\r\n  Willm̄ Flower Esquire alias Norroy kinge of Armes of the northe\r\n  partes of Englande send greetinge in our lorde god everlastinge.

And wheras in this Citie\r\n  of London thˀexperience & practise of the science and facultie of\r\n  Chirurgery is most requisite and daily to be exercysed & experimented\r\n  for the preservacion of meny, & by thˀoccasion of the practise\r\n  thereof meny expert persons be brought up & experimented to the\r\n  relief, succour, & helpe of an infinite nomber of persons. And for\r\n  as much as within this Citie of London ther were two severall\r\n  c͠opanyes, thˀone by the name of Barbours Chirurgeons, and thˀother\r\n  by the name of Chirurgeons onely: the Barbours Chirurgeons being\r\n  incorporate & y{e} other not, & bothe occupyenge y{e} arte of\r\n  Chirurgery wheruppon greate c͠otention did arise. And for y{t} it was\r\n  most meete and necessary y{t} the sayd two c͠opanyes shuld be united\r\n  & made one hole body & so incorporated, to thˀentent that by their\r\n  union & often assembly togither, thˀexercyse & knowledge of their\r\n  science & mistery might appeere, as well in practise as in speculatiõ\r\n  not onely to theim selfes, but to others under theim. So that it was\r\n  thought most meete & c͠ovenient upon grave & greate c͠osideracion,\r\n  to unyte & joyne y{e} sayd two c͠opanyes in one: w{ch} was don as\r\n  may appeere by an acte of parleament in an̄o xxxij of Henry theight\r\n  w{t} these wordes “Be it enactid by the Kinge our souvereigne lorde\r\n  & the lordes spirituall & temporall & the com̃ons of y{e} same, that\r\n  y{e} sayde two severall & distinct companies, that is to say bothe\r\n  y{e} Barbours Surgeons, & the Sourgeons & every parson of theim\r\n  beinge a freman of either of y{e} sayde c͠opanies after y{e} custome\r\n  of the sayde citie of London, & their successors, from hencefoorthe\r\n  immediatly be unyted & made one entier and whole body corporate, &\r\n  one societie perpetual, which at all tymes heerafter shalbe called by\r\n  y{e} name of Maisters & Governours of y{e} mistery & com̃unalty of\r\n  Barbours & Surgeons of London for evermore, & by none other name.”\r\n  In consideracion whereof & for that it doth appeere a thinge most\r\n  requisite for the unitinge of these two c͠opanyes togither and for\r\n  that thˀoccupation of the Barbo{rs} Chirurgeons beinge incorporate\r\n  hath since y{e} tyme of Kinge Henry the sixt used & boren Armes\r\n  y{t} is to say Sables a cheveron betweene thre Flewmes argent w{ch}\r\n  Armes wer unto theim assigned onely by the gifte & assignement\r\n  of Clarencieulx Kinge of Armes, as by y{e} patent thereof doth &\r\n  may more plainly appeere.

And for y{t} it pleased y{e} same Kinge Henry thˀeight, not\r\n  onely to unite & incorporate these two c͠opanies togither by acte of\r\n  parleament but also hath ratifyed & c͠ofirmed the same by his letters\r\n  patentꝭ under the greate seale of Englande & so lately c͠ofirmed\r\n  by y{e} Queenes Ma{tie} that now is.[281] And wheras Thomas Galle\r\n  in the 3 yere of the Queene’s Ma{ties} reigne that now is beinge\r\n  Maister, Alexander Mason John Standon Robert Mudesley governors of\r\n  y{e} same corporation mistery & comunaltie of Barbours & Chirurgeons\r\n  being desirouse to have some signes & tokens addid & augmented to\r\n  thˀold & auncient Armes of the Barbours Chirurgeons, not onely for a\r\n  perpetuall memory as well of y{e} famouse prince Kinge Henry thˀeight\r\n  their founder & patrone but also for a further declaration of y{e}\r\n  unitinge of those two c͠opanies togither did instantly require the\r\n  late Clarencieulx Hervy to consider y{e} premisses & to shew his\r\n  endevor therein.

The Act of Parliament was passed\r\n        in 1540, but was not confirmed by any letters patent of Henry\r\n        VIII. We have no such charter or any reference to it, and\r\n        moreover it is _not on the Patent Rolls_, where it would\r\n        appear, had it ever existed; furthermore Elizabeth’s charter\r\n        (in our possession) confirms Henry’s charter of 1512 and not\r\n        this pretended one.\r\n\r\n               GILBERT DETHICKE aɫs. garter principall Kinge of arms.\r\n               ROB COOKE Alias Clarencieulx Roy Darmes.\r\n               pˀmoy WYLLAM FFLOWER alias Norrey Roy Darmes.\r\n\r\n  Entred approved & allowed in the visitation made 1634\r\n\r\n                   HEN: ST. GEORGE\r\n                             Richmond.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this grant recites that it plainly appeared\r\nthat the grant of 10th July, 1561, was [_a._] contrary to the words\r\nof the Corporation (_i.e._, Incorporation) of the said Barbers and\r\nSurgeons, and [_b._] contrary to and not agreeing with the ancient laws\r\nand rules of arms.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the former assertion [_a._] I take it that the grant\r\nbeing made to the “Master and Governors of the Corporation Mystery\r\nand Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons” and _not_ to the “Masters\r\nand Governors of the Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons\r\nof London” as they are styled in the Act 32 Hen. VIII, offended the\r\nprecise Heralds of 1569, and that it was indeed a technical defect and\r\ncontrary to the exact words of the incorporation.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point [_b._] there cannot be any doubt but that Hervey\r\ncommitted a violation of one of the fundamental and most ancient laws\r\nof heraldry, viz., that colour must not be on colour (nor metal on\r\nmetal). He gave the Company on their old sable field, a chief with\r\ngules and vert thereon! This greatly shocked old Garter, Clarencieux,\r\nand Norroy, and enabled them, whilst recording the blunder of one of\r\ntheir predecessors, to extract a good fee from the Barber-Surgeons for\r\na new grant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFEASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a wide-spread impression that the Livery Guilds exist\r\nprincipally for the purpose of feasting, and there are unscrupulous\r\npersons who do not hesitate to affirm that the Courts of the Companies\r\nact as fraudulent trustees, and are consenting parties to the\r\nmalversation of trust and charity property, eating up money which it is\r\naudaciously pretended belongs to the “people of London.”\r\n\r\nThese statements have been assiduously put forth by a certain class of\r\npoliticians whose acquaintance with the true details of the case must\r\nbe absolutely nil, and who it is but reasonable to suppose, are willing\r\nto assume that the gentlemen who manage the affairs of the Companies\r\nare in the habit of acting as their traducers would do, had they but\r\nthe opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo any one conversant with the history and management of the Livery\r\nGuilds, these assertions are known to be false. Here and there, as\r\nin every concern in life, improprieties and errors in judgment may\r\nhave occurred, but it is confidently asserted, and capable of proof,\r\nthat no charitable or trust funds suffer from feasting; indeed, on\r\nthe contrary, the practice has obtained for centuries, with but few\r\nexceptions, for the members of the guilds to themselves supply the\r\nfunds which are spent upon their entertainment, and for the surplus\r\naccumulations of these funds to be applied _to the augmentation of\r\ncharities and trusts_. It has certainly been so in the Barber-Surgeons’\r\nCompany, and for a long period the calls upon the Livery for feasting\r\npurposes (when the custom was to nominate Stewards in rotation) were\r\na severe strain upon the members, and occasioned great irritation and\r\nill-feeling.\r\n\r\nThe earliest practice in the Companies would appear to be that the\r\nLivery and their wives attending the feasts, paid a stipulated sum per\r\nhead, and we know this by our records to have been so in our Company\r\nlong before the time of Richard II. This custom was altered in later\r\ntimes, and we find that certain appointed entertainments were given on\r\nfixed days, to which all members were invited, and which were paid for\r\nby fines laid down upon admission to the freedom, and further fines on\r\ngoing on to the Livery and Court. In addition to this, each Liveryman\r\nhad, in his turn, to serve “the office of Steward,” that is, to join\r\nwith four or five others in providing the costs of certain dinners.[282]\r\n\r\n[282] The office of Steward is not now served, but each Liveryman on\r\nadmission pays a special fine of fifteen guineas in lieu, which is\r\napplied towards the cost of the entertainments.\r\n\r\nThe fees on admission into the Companies are greatly in excess of the\r\nancient ones, and it is mainly from this source of revenue that the\r\nexpenses of the feasts are now defrayed. It is so in the Barbers’\r\nCompany, but, if at any time these funds have temporarily been found\r\ninsufficient for the purpose, they have been supplemented from a\r\nproperty, which is in no sense a Charity Estate, or subject to any\r\ntrust whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThere have been and are, good men of business on the Courts, and by\r\nprudent investments of surplus funds derived from fees, fines, etc., a\r\nproperty has been created, which is exclusively their very own to deal\r\nwith as they please. We have, amongst many others, the opinion of Lord\r\nChancellor Selborne very decisively to this effect, and also one, which\r\nby the traducers of the Companies ought to be respected, for it is that\r\nof Sir Horace Davey, Q.C., who was consulted by the Livery Companies’\r\nCommission--a Commission notoriously hostile to the guilds. Sir H.\r\nDavey stated that they would “not be justified in recommending that\r\nthe corporate property of the Companies should be taken from them by\r\nthe State.” He further reported that, such an act “would be an act of\r\n_confiscation_, and would not unreasonably shake the confidence of the\r\nowners of property in the security of the rights of property. It must\r\nbe remembered that the Estates of these Companies have been recognised,\r\nand held by the Courts of Law, to be as much their property with a\r\nfull right of disposition, as the property of individuals.” Truly, the\r\nCommissioners must have said to their legal adviser as Balak of old\r\nsaid to Baalam, “I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold thou\r\nhast blessed them altogether!”\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasing characteristic of all true Englishmen that they love\r\nto meet together around a festive board; while their hospitality in\r\ninviting their friends, or the eminent and great in all sections of\r\nsociety to partake with them has happily not gone out of fashion, and,\r\nspite of the sour critics of the guilds, we fervently trust that it\r\nnever may.\r\n\r\n1388. In the return to a writ, 12th Richard II, the Masters of the\r\nBarbers certified, amongst other matters, that it was their practice\r\n“once a year to assemble to feast,” and that they had an ordinance by\r\nwhich none of the brotherhood were to pay more than 14_d._ each towards\r\nthe feast.\r\n\r\n10th May, 1435. Among the Ordinances of the Surgeons was one that each\r\nmember was to “paie ʒeerli to the dyner of the craft that is to seie\r\noonys aʒeer on the dai of Seint luke ech man lich mich whethir he be\r\npˀsent or absent,” _i.e._, once a year on St. Luke’s day each man was\r\nto pay like much whether present or absent.\r\n\r\n28th September, 1503. It was ordained that every member attending the\r\ndinner the day on which the Wardens were presented to the Lord Mayor\r\nwas to pay 20_d._, and if he brought his wife with him, then 2_s._\r\n\r\nThe Barber-Surgeons from the earliest times appear to have entertained\r\nthe ladies at certain feasts, and their unique toast “The Good Wives,\r\nMerry Maids and Buxom Widows of the Worshipful Company of Barbers” is\r\ntraditionally said to have had its origin in Elizabeth’s time.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1530. The following is amongst the ordinances signed by Sir\r\nThomas More at this date--\r\n\r\n  AND WHERE OF OLDE Custume yerely upon the Sondaye next ensuyng the\r\n  ffeaste of Seynt Bartholomew the appostell[283] a dyner is kept\r\n  and provyded for theym of the lyvery of the said Company in their\r\n  Comen halle called Barbors hale AND ON the daye of saynt Cosme &\r\n  Damian[284] yf it be not on the saterday a dynˀ for them of the same\r\n  compani owt of the lyverey IT IS ordeyned and enacted that evˀy man\r\n  that hathe been upper maister or upper Govˀnor of the said Company\r\n  shall paye at and for the same dyner xij{d} for hymselff and viij{d}\r\n  for his wyffe yff she come.

The earliest entry in the Court Minutes on this subject\r\nis a doleful one, for it was ordered “That there shalbe no dynner kept\r\nthis yere.”\r\n\r\n19th September, 1552. William Bette was appointed “Cooke for the Hall,”\r\nand Steven Reede the “Butler.” John Edwards (a Freeman) was to supply\r\nthe flowers on the feast days.\r\n\r\n28th July, 1555. It was ordered that the Masters should have a yearly\r\nallowance of £7 for the Election dinner, and that none should be at the\r\ndinner but Liverymen.\r\n\r\n22nd July, 1556. This allowance was increased to £13 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n20th February, 1567. Henry Smith, yeoman to Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of\r\nLeicester, was admitted to the freedom, and because he had been frankly\r\nand freely admitted to the freedom of the City at the suit of the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, the Marquess of Northampton and the Earl of Leicester, he\r\npaid nothing but 3_s._ 4_d._, and 4_d._ for entering his name--\r\n\r\n  but the same daye the saide Henry Smythe gave the M{r} & govˀnor{rs}\r\n  and assystentˀ a dynar at his owne pˀpr coste & charges franckely and\r\n  gratefully and also he hath forder more pˀmysed and graunted to geve\r\n  one boock[285] of season to serve at the dynar upon the daye of the\r\n  Electyon.\r\n\r\n  [285] Buck.\r\n\r\n  28th July, 1593. No greate dyner was agreed upon but a smale repast\r\n  w{th} the allowance of xl{s} and nether wemen nor children to come to\r\n  o{r} hall upon the daie of the newe ellec̃ion.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1600. There having been abuses at the feasts, an order was\r\nmade for their reformation which stated--\r\n\r\n  that the bodye of this Company hath susteyned much disparagement\r\n  by reason that some of the livery and others noe white at all\r\n  respectinge the worshipp of this Company have not onely by themselves\r\n  but alsoe by their servants and apprentices disfurnished the tables\r\n  att ffeastes whereat they have sitten to pleasure their private\r\n  frendes contrary to all modestie and good government. Doe therefore\r\n  order for reformac͠on thereof by the aucthoritye aforesaid That noe\r\n  pˀson of the Lyvery of this Companye beinge not of the Assistaunce of\r\n  the same, shall not att any tyme hereafter suffer any of his children\r\n  frendes servants or apprentices to staye or attende uppon him or his\r\n  wiefe att any ffeaste to be kepte in the saide Comon Hall [_under a\r\n  penalty of 6s. 8d._].\r\n\r\nAn order was also made that no Assistant should have more than one\r\nservant or apprentice to attend upon him and his wife at any feast.\r\n\r\n  21st January, 1601. Whereas by the death of Robert Gray late Cooke\r\n  to this Company the house was unfurnished of a Cooke to serve the\r\n  said mistery And therefore divers Cookes became this daie shewters\r\n  to this Courte for the place of the said Robert Gray beinge then\r\n  voyd, yet notwithstandinge forasmuch as Margaret Grey wiefe to the\r\n  said Robert Grey became an humble Suter to the said Courte for the\r\n  same place, it was ordered by the whole consente of this Courte That\r\n  the said Margeret Grey be admitted Cooke to this Company duringe the\r\n  tyme she shall well and honestlie and sufficientlie behave her selfe\r\n  therin And she to receave such fee and salary therefore as at any\r\n  tyme heretofore hath beene graunted to the said Robert Grey Provided\r\n  allwaies that she finde all vessells belongeinge to a Cooke And that\r\n  she execute the said place by a sufficient deputy beinge such a\r\n  pˀsonn as the M{rs} of this Company for the tyme beinge shall like\r\n  well of and shall thinke fitt.\r\n\r\nMargery, however, does not seem to have “honestlie and sufficientlie\r\nbehaved her selfe,” for as appears by an entry--\r\n\r\n  6th May, 1602. This daye Margery Grey late wyef to Robert Grey was\r\n  dismissed from being any more Coocke to this Company for speciall\r\n  causes to the M{rs} best knowen.\r\n\r\nThe Plague was raging severely in London in 1603, and the following\r\nprecept was addressed to the Company, who however seem to have\r\ndisregarded it, as the Election and Audit dinners were held this\r\nyear. It is only fair, however, to state that the Court disbursed\r\nconsiderable sums of money amongst the poor stricken people.\r\n\r\n    13th April, 1603.

The dinners were usually held on Election and Audit days, on\r\nLord Mayor’s day, and after all public dissections, besides Committee\r\ndinners (which usually were at taverns), and this year it was ordered\r\nthat a dinner was to be held on “Gunpowder Day.”\r\n\r\n  21st August, 1609. This day it was ordered that from henceforth all\r\n  such as are of the Livery should give towardꝭ the charge of the\r\n  musicke on the Election day vj{d} a peice which they then begun and\r\n  confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the next order was, that in consequence of the poverty of\r\nthe Company at this time, the usual allowance of £8 made by the Court\r\ntowards the Mayor’s feast, could not be granted.\r\n\r\n  2nd October, 1610. At this Court Richard Cade & Richard Coopˀ whoe\r\n  are appoynted for Stewardꝭ of the Mayors ffeast are contented at\r\n  theire owne chardgꝭ to provide and make the same ffeast as fully as\r\n  formˀly y{t} hath been, only this their provision for their quantitie\r\n  of their messes are not to be soe many for that noe wyves nor guestꝭ\r\n  are to be bydden or brought to the same ffeast.\r\n\r\n  18th September, 1611. Att this Court Sebright the Cook is dismissed\r\n  from his place of beinge Cook to this howse as well for that he did\r\n  dresse their last dynner very badlie as for his ill usage in speeches\r\n  towardꝭ the maisters wyves and for dyvˀse other abuses by him\r\n  heretofore committed.\r\n\r\n  2nd July, 1612. At this Court our M{r} & M{r} Warden Johnson moving\r\n  this Court that the Barbors as well as the Surgeons might be bedden\r\n  to the dynnˀs that are keept at the examinac͠on of surgeons whereupon\r\n  it was at this Court ordered & agreed that as many of the Auntient\r\n  M{rs} & govˀno{rs} being barbo{rs} should & shalbe bidde unto every\r\n  such dynner as there shalbe Surgeons beinge examiners at evˀy such\r\n  dynner.\r\n\r\n21st January, 1613. It was ordered that the Master and Wardens, with\r\nfour of the Ancient Masters, should for the “worship & credytt of this\r\nCompany,” yearly go and visit the Lord Mayor at dinner, and that 20_s._\r\neach should be allowed them for their “charges” of the same. This\r\nallowance of 20_s._ each was probably given to some officer of the Lord\r\nMayor to secure his favour towards the Company.\r\n\r\n6th February, 1613. An order was made that at the dinner after any\r\nprivate anatomy, any of the Livery, either Barbers or Surgeons, might\r\ncome thereto on payment of 12_d._ each.\r\n\r\n  16th September, 1613. This daie it is thought fitt & ordered that\r\n  the widdowes of this company w{ch} doe paie their quarterage shalbe\r\n  bidden to the ffeastꝭ in the hall.\r\n\r\n  14th October, 1613. Att this Court it is ordered that such widdowes\r\n  as have been masters wyves and doe keepe shoppes or bynd appnˀtices\r\n  shall paye their quarteradge but for such as doe neither keepe\r\n  shoppes nor bynd appnˀticꝭ they shall not paye any quarteradge And\r\n  yet notw{th}standinge they shalbe bydden to the feastꝭ yerelie.\r\n\r\n  24th May, 1614. Whereas this Company hath receaved a preceptt from\r\n  the lord Mayor of this citty forbidding thereby all superfluitie &\r\n  excesse of Dyet at the ffeastꝭ of this company and thereby injoyning\r\n  that such feastꝭ as accustomably have been made & provided by this\r\n  Company shalbe hereafter keept more sparingly & frugally then in\r\n  former tymes they have, Wherefore it is ordered that there shalbe\r\n  keept & made on the ellection daie this yere ensuing a smale\r\n  ellection dynner according to the tenor of the said precept.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1614. The above precept soon being forgotten it was this\r\nday ordered--\r\n\r\n  that there shalbe kept an Auditt dynner in such manner & forme as\r\n  formerlie in other yeares have byn accustomed. And such allowance as\r\n  formerlie hath byn allowde is to be paid by the howse.\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1615. At this Court it is ordered that the Cooke shalbe\r\n  removed & displaced from his place of beinge Cooke of this Companie\r\n  not onely for that he hath abused and wronged manie who have byn\r\n  M{rs} & Stewardꝭ of the feastꝭ in unsemelie wordꝭ but for a generall\r\n  dislike taken against him by this howse & for not pˀforminge his\r\n  office in such sorte as is right he shold & ought to doe.\r\n\r\n1624. The funds being very low this year the Court held no election\r\ndinner, but regaled themselves with cakes and wine, and the following\r\norder was made for the Yeomanry:--\r\n\r\n  2nd September, 1624. This Court being moved whether the yeomanry of\r\n  y{is} Compa. should hould any election dinner or noe. It is for the\r\n  reason then shewne expressely ordered with a generall consent that\r\n  the yeomanry shall onely keepe their Election as this Court lately\r\n  did onely with Cakes and wyne and neither feast musick or sermon to\r\n  be had at that time.\r\n\r\n  20th July, 1625. This daye the letter directed to this Companye\r\n  from my lord Maio{r} of London in effect tending the prohibiting\r\n  of publicke feastingꝭ in our Hall and the contributeing of those\r\n  moneys that should be saved thereby the one halfe to be paid unto the\r\n  chamber of London and the other halfe to the poore of our Companie,\r\n  so hereupon it is ordered by this Courte y{t} Ten poundꝭ shalbe\r\n  distributed to the poore of this Companie at the discretion of the\r\n  present M{rs} & noe money at all to be paid into the Chamber of\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1628. This daye our M{r} propounding to this Court whether\r\n  there should be a greate Election dinner or a small dinner or onely\r\n  Cakes and wine upon the next Election daye for choise of new M{rs},\r\n  whereupon by most voyces it was ordered that there should be a greate\r\n  Election dinner held this yeare and the allowance of xx{li} towardꝭ\r\n  that charge to be defrayed.\r\n\r\n  28th January, 1631. This Court being informed of Swinnertons abusive\r\n  and naughtie pewter from tyme to tyme brought to serve this Hall at\r\n  feastꝭ doe dismisse him from serving that place any longer.\r\n\r\n  20th September, 1632. It is ordered by this Court that the Twoe\r\n  Governo{rs} that are Surgians shalbe at the charge and give the\r\n  venison that shalbe used at their solepñe[287] feasts and those twoe\r\n  Governo{rs} Surgians and the other twoe Governo{rs} Barbars to paye\r\n  joynetly & sevˀally share and share like amongst them 4 the charge\r\n  for fees and fetching the venison soe to be brought to o{r} Hall.\r\n\r\n  [287] Solemn.\r\n\r\n  8th March, 1637.

It is ordered that that\r\n  addic͠on of fare amounting to 50{s} shalbe allowed out of the stock.\r\n\r\n  6th April, 1638.

Mr. Ralph Foster was complained of for refusing to\r\nmake his dinner to the Court on his election as an Assistant, and he\r\nthereupon uttered certain speeches “tending to the separation of the\r\nBarbers from the Surgeons,” for which he was reprimanded, whereupon he\r\npromised to make his dinner and to say no more about disunion.\r\n\r\n23rd October, 1649. Upon reading the precept requiring the Livery to\r\nattend the Lord Mayor Elect to Westminster in their Barge, it was\r\nordered that the Livery should be warned to perform that service in\r\naccordance with old custom, and “that there be a ffeast at the Hall\r\non that day for the said Livery, But in respect of the hardnes and\r\ntroubles of the times this Court doth consent that there be noe second\r\ncourse and noe Woeman at the same ffeast.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Company’s archives are four books containing many details\r\nof the feasts held between the years 1676 and 1790.

It was ordered, in consequence of the great\r\nincrease in the Livery, that there should be six instead of five\r\nstewards of the Mayor’s Feast to make the Livery dinner, and any\r\nliveryman chosen to the office and refusing to serve was to be\r\nprosecuted under the by-laws. The fine for not serving was £13 6_s._\r\n8_d._, and was invariably enforced, numerous cases of refusal being\r\ndecided at law in favour of the Company. Six Whifflers were as usual,\r\nappointed “to be attendant upon the Govern{rs} at the Hall upon the\r\nnext Lord Mayo{rs} day in comely & decent Apparrell with gilded Chaines\r\n& white Staves.”\r\n\r\n6th November, 1717. In consequence of irregularities at the Lord\r\nMayor’s feast, it was ordered that in future the Stewards should be\r\nprohibited from bringing their wives and friends to the dinner.\r\n\r\n1721. The third dinner book opens with an account of the receipts\r\nof the Governors’ “Potation Money” for this year, amounting to £131\r\n11_s._ 2_d._, the contributions being from Barbers one guinea, and from\r\nSurgeons two guineas each. This potation money was spent at the Mitre\r\nTavern in Fleet Street, on ten Monthly Court dinners, which averaged\r\nthe modest sum of £4 4_s._ apiece, and the remainder was disbursed\r\nabout the election feast, wine and sundries.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Mayor’s feast this year was £67 7_s._, and at this\r\ndinner was drunk a hogshead of port (query), six gallons of mountain,\r\nsix gallons of white port, and three gallons of canary.\r\n\r\nJuly 19th, 1722. At the ladies’ feast the following wine was drunk--\r\n\r\n  30 Gallons Red Port at 7_s._                                 10 10 0\r\n  11   \"     Sherry at 7_s._                                    3 17 0\r\n   7   \"     Canary at 7_s._                                    2  9 0\r\n   5   \"     Rhenish at 7_s._                                   1 15 0\r\n\r\nand 4_s._ were expended on tobacco and pipes.\r\n\r\n1726. The monthly Court dinners were held at the George and Vulture\r\nTavern, nine of them costing in all £29 13_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nThe Election dinner this year cost £91 8_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord Mayor’s feast £72 1_s._ 10-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nJune, 1729. The monthly Court dinner was held at “Vaux Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe accounts throughout the Third Dinner Book (1720-1740) appear to\r\nbe much the same every year. First is a list of receipts for Potation\r\nMoney, averaging about £100 per annum, then follow the allowances out\r\nof the same towards the Election dinner, the dressing it and use of\r\npewter, about £19 in all, the payments for the monthly Court dinners\r\n(nine or ten at about £4 4_s._ each), and the expenses of the Election\r\nfeasts, about £80 to £90 a piece.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Lord Mayor’s feast, the Livery feast, and the Ladies’\r\nfeast, was borne by the Stewards.\r\n\r\nThere were gay doings at some of these dinners, as witness the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  1726. Paid the Boy who danced the anticks at the Lady’s feast, 5_s._\r\n\r\n  1727. By Cash paid the Butchers who played to the Company with their\r\n  Marrow bones and cleavers on Lord Mayor’s day, 1_s._\r\n\r\nAnd there were sometimes rather shady doings after the dinners, thus:\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1729. Mem̃dm. M{r} Truelove & M{r} Fradin carried away\r\n  y{e} next morning after y{e} feast four Dozen Quarts of Wine, One\r\n  whole Venison pasty, One whole Goose, one whole fowl, & several\r\n  lemons & sugar.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1732. Mr. John Atkinson and the other Stewards of the\r\nMayor’s feast, employed a cook of their own, and “did make a most\r\nscandalous Dinner for y{e} Co.,” whereupon order was given that in\r\nfuture no other than the “Standing Cooke” of the Company should be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nOne is astounded at the quantity of wine which appears to have been\r\nimbibed at some of these dinners; take, for example, the following on\r\nLord Mayor’s Day, 1735, and note that it is especially stated that the\r\nwine was “drank at the said feast”:\r\n\r\n  Paid for the following quantitys of wine provided for and drank at\r\n  the said feast, viz{t.}\r\n\r\n  To M{r} Standert for 21 Gall Red Port                        6  6  0\r\n                        2 Gall Lisben                          0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Mountaine                       0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Canary                          0 13  0\r\n                       29 Bottles lost                         0  4 10\r\n  To M{r} Gaywood for  20 Gall Red Port                        6  0  0\r\n                        2 Gall Mountaine                       0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Lisbone                         0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Canary                          0 13  0\r\n  To M{r.} Pierce for   2 Gall Lisben                          0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Mountaine                       0 12  0\r\n                        2 Gall Canary                          0 13  0\r\n                       20 Gall Red Port                        6  0  0\r\n\r\nBy the above account these thirsty old Barber-Surgeons seem to have\r\nconsumed no less than 79 Gallons of wine at this dinner.\r\n\r\n15th July, 1736. 56 gallons of wine were drunk at the Ladies’ feast.\r\n\r\n  21st July, 1726. It is order{d} That from henceforward at all publick\r\n  Feasts or Dinners to be held or made at the Hall the Cook of the\r\n  Company for the time being shall before he sends the Dinner into the\r\n  Hall deliver to the Clark of the Company at his House his Messe of\r\n  meat consisting of six compleat dishes according to the Ancient laws\r\n  and usage of the Company in that behalf the same being the ancient\r\n  ffee & Perquisite of the Clerk.\r\n\r\n21st August, 1729. The above order was vacated in consequence of\r\ndisputes as to the contents and number of the dishes supplied to the\r\nClerk, and it was ordered that the Clerk should receive £5 5_s._\r\nannually in lieu of his “messe of meat,” and also that he should dine\r\nat all the feasts “as he has always been accustomed to do.”\r\n\r\n  1st February, 1731. For the better regulating of the Ladys Feast It\r\n  is ordered That every Member of the Court of Assistants shall besides\r\n  his Lady and one daughter have three tickets to be delivered to such\r\n  persons as they shall think fitt to be admitted to come and dance at\r\n  the Hall at Five of the Clock on that day and that there shall be two\r\n  Constables to attend at the Hall gate and see that nobody is admitted\r\n  but with such Ticketts and that the Ticketts be made out by the Clerk\r\n  of the Company and sealed with the Company’s seal.\r\n\r\nThe Summons to a Liveryman to take upon himself the office of Steward\r\nwas of a very peremptory nature, as will be seen by the following:--\r\n\r\n    S{r}\r\n\r\n  By order of the Ma{rs} or Gov{rs} of the Mystery & Comonalty of\r\n  Barbers & Surgeons of London, I do hereby give you notice that you\r\n  having been chosen & admitted of the Livery or Cloathing of the said\r\n  Company, You are appointed by the Masters or Gov{rs} of the s{d}\r\n  Comp{d} together with M{r.} Richard Penton M{r.} Joseph Griffin M{r.}\r\n  Daniel Pengrove and M{r.} Joseph Mitchell who are also Liverymen of\r\n  the said Company to make an Entertainment in the Com̄on Hall of the\r\n  said Company situate in Monckwell Street in the Parish of Saint Olave\r\n  Silver Street in the City of London for the Gov{rs} and Assistants\r\n  of the s{d} Company commonly called the Livery Dinner on Teusday the\r\n  3{d} day of June 1735 at two of the Clock in the afternoon pursuant\r\n  to a By law of the said Company in that behalf made & provided. And\r\n  in case you shall neglect or refuse w{th}out reasonable Excuse to\r\n  join together with the said M{r.} Richard Penton M{r.} Joseph Griffin\r\n  M{r.} Daniel Pengrove and M{r.} Joseph Mitchell to made such Dinner\r\n  on Teusday the 3{d} day of June next, or to contribute and pay your\r\n  share and and proporc͠on of the charges thereof you will forfeit and\r\n  pay to the said Ma{rs} or Gov{rs} of the s{d} Mystery and Comonalty\r\n  to the use of the said Company the sum of £5. And I do hereby give\r\n  you further notice That the gentlemen who are to join with you in\r\n  making the said dinner will meet you at the George and Vulture Tavern\r\n  in Saint Michael’s Alley in Cornhill in the City of London on Friday\r\n  next being the 23rd day of this instant May at six of the clock in\r\n  the afternoon to give the proper directions for the said dinner, at\r\n  which time and place you are desired to attend for that purpose.\r\n\r\n                            I am S{r}\r\n                                    Your most obed{t.} humble Serv{t.}\r\n                                               CHA: BERNARD\r\n                                          Clerk to the s{d} Company.\r\n\r\n  Herewith you will receive a copy of the Bill of Fare or a Particular\r\n  of w{ch} the s{d} Entertainment is to consist.\r\n\r\n  Barbers and     }\r\n  Surgeon’s Hall, } 22{d} May 1735\r\n\r\n  To M{r.} Cha: More.\r\n\r\n28th May, 1741. By an order made this day in reference to the Ladies’\r\nfeast it was directed--\r\n\r\n  that the Entertainment shall continue no longer than twelve of the\r\n  clock when there shall be no more Dancing but that the Musick be then\r\n  dismissed and the Company depart.\r\n\r\n  28th August, 1741. The Court having taken into consideration the ill\r\n  behaviour and abusive language of John Atkinson Distiller in White\r\n  Chappell (a Liveryman of this Company) on the last day of Election,\r\n  who in a most gross manner (in the Common Hall of this Company) the\r\n  Master of the said Company did greatly insult and abuse and did\r\n  otherwise very indecently and rudely behave to other Members of the\r\n  Company whereby the Peace of the said Company then assembled was\r\n  greatly disturbed, and being determined to put a stop to and prevent\r\n  the like grievances for the future by punishing all such offendors\r\n  herein ORDERED that the said John Atkinson be fined for such his ill\r\n  behaviour to the Master the sum of 6{s} 8{d} and 10{s} for bringing\r\n  in to Dinner on that day another person with him after having been\r\n  acquainted by the Master that the same was contrary to the By laws of\r\n  the said Company.\r\n\r\n1745. It is noticeable that the Potation Money fell off on the\r\nseparation of the Surgeons from the Barbers. During the three or four\r\npreceding years the amount had been steadily running down from an\r\naverage of £105 to £57, and there seems to have been no Election or\r\nLivery Dinners this year, though the gallant Barbers did not forget the\r\nLadies, for they gave them (and themselves) a dinner at a cost of £52\r\n1_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nThe Barbers, too, at this time do not seem to have drunk quite so much\r\nwine as the Barber-Surgeons did, and in the year 1747 is the first\r\nmention of Beer, when 12_s._ was paid for a barrel of small Beer for\r\nthe Lord Mayor’s feast, and only 68 bottles of wine were consumed on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1750 and 1786 no records are kept of any but the\r\nMayor’s feasts, though doubtless the Company did not fast during the\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThere is now a striking similarity in these dinner accounts year by\r\nyear; usually there were six stewards each of whom provided, about the\r\nyears 1775, and later on, no less than 53 bottles of wine each, thus\r\nemulating their predecessors the Barber-Surgeons; there are numerous\r\nreferences to these bottles as being quarts, so that about 80 gallons\r\nmust have been drunk at each dinner. Happily, all this is now changed.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable from the earliest times that the Company on every\r\noccasion of a feast, invariably hired their Pewter dishes and plates\r\nat great cost; it seems strange that this continual outlay should have\r\nbeen incurred, instead of keeping a stock of pewter.\r\n\r\n1830 and 1831. Considerable difficulty had arisen for some years past\r\nin procuring Stewards for the Mayor’s feasts, and also in enforcing\r\nthe fines for not serving, whereupon a resolution was passed that\r\nLiverymen refusing to pay the Steward’s fine would not be invited to\r\nthe dinners, and would be declared ineligible to come on the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Court seem to have had grave doubts as to the efficacy of their\r\nBy-Laws in recovering at law the Steward’s fines, and a case having\r\nbeen prepared it was submitted to Sir James Scarlett and to Sir Thomas\r\nDenman (the Attorney General). The opinion of the former eminent\r\nCounsel, dated 10th October, 1832, is set out in the minutes, and he\r\nappears to have been very clear that they would not be recoverable,\r\nwhereupon the Court ordered a letter (of 16th October) to be addressed\r\nto the Livery, informing them of the difficulty which had arisen by\r\nreason of Liverymen refusing to serve as Stewards in their rotation\r\n(after having partaken of the hospitality of other Stewards in former\r\nyears), and that in consequence thereof there would be no dinner that\r\nyear. The day after this letter was sent out, Sir Thomas Denman’s\r\nopinion was handed in, and was to the opposite effect of that given by\r\nSir James Scarlett! Since this period, and now, the Steward’s fine is\r\npaid on the admission of a Liveryman, and thus a source of constant\r\nannoyance is done away with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH ESTATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the acquisition by the Corporation of London and the\r\nCity Guilds, of their estates in Ireland has been often related,\r\nand full accounts will be found in “Malcolm’s Londinium Redivivum,”\r\n“Herbert’s Livery Companies,” “Nicholl’s Ironmongers’ Company,” and\r\nother works; I shall, therefore, only treat of the subject so far as\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons were concerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 when James I floated his Irish scheme, our Company seems\r\nto have been very loath to enter into it, as would appear by the\r\ninsignificant subscriptions proffered by the Members (_see_ page 473).\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which the Court foresaw in raising the £100 demanded in\r\nJuly, 1609, was endeavoured to be surmounted by the following ingenious\r\nproposition: there had been some previous forced loans to the King\r\namounting to £123, for which the Company held the City’s bond, and\r\nas this was considered a doubtful asset, it was suggested that £100\r\nthereof should be adventured on behalf of the Company; it is needless\r\nto say that this innocent suggestion was scouted, and a peremptory\r\nprecept for the £100 delivered, whereupon the Court assessed the\r\nvarious members of the Company and with the greatest difficulty £30 was\r\nthus raised and a further sum of £90 later on. The Minutes referring to\r\nthese transactions are especially worthy the perusal of those persons\r\nwho claim the estates of the City Companies as being the “property of\r\nthe people,” or as having been “left for the poor,” &c. We see by them\r\nthat (in our Company certainly, and as doubtless an examination of\r\nrecords would show, in all other Companies) the purchase of these lands\r\nin Ireland was not only compulsory, but that it was made from moneys\r\ncontributed by individual members for the most part, and the balance\r\nfrom the “Stock of the house,” this “Stock” being the floating funds\r\nin the Renter Warden’s hands, derived from admissions, fines, &c. We\r\nthus see that no “trust” money was used for the purchase, and that the\r\nestates are saddled with no trust whatever, but are held free, and by\r\nan infinitely better title as far as morality goes, to say nothing of\r\nlegality, than many Estates in the hands of some of the aristocratic\r\npatrons of the busybodies bent on spoliation.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1611, the Company were commanded by precept to elect\r\nwhether they would for their contribution accept a tract of land in\r\nUlster, _saddled with a condition to build upon it_, or refer the\r\nletting of it to the Irish Society, whereupon they chose the latter,\r\nand in July following came a precept, for its morality worthy of the\r\nLand League, for it called upon the Wardens to pay down £60 more, or\r\nelse _to absolutely lose the £120 already contributed_!\r\n\r\nThe doleful answer of the Court, dated 19th July, 1611, is deeply\r\ninteresting, and we cannot but be touched by the wrongs under which\r\nthey suffered, and which constrained them to write:--“we must be\r\nforced (yf there be lawfull authoritie to take awaye & compell o{r}\r\nCompany) to loose the moneys we have alreadye disburssed.”\r\n\r\nJames, however, did not care much about the money the Company proposed\r\nto abandon; what he required was a further supply, and the proceedings\r\nthereupon are indicated by the Minute of 16th November, 1611. Shortly\r\nafter, the Company wisely applied to “M{r} Recorder” to construe the\r\nanswer, but even his skill and interest did not avail, for on 2nd July,\r\n1612, it was agreed that the Master and Wardens should go before the\r\nCourt of Aldermen, and “stand hardlie” against paying any more money,\r\nespecially as they had not any security for what had been already\r\nadvanced, and if committed, they were to go to prison, rather than pay\r\nthe £30 demanded, with a proviso that directly they were imprisoned,\r\nthe £30 was to be paid, and it was eventually paid.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, the Company made over their interest in the Irish Estate to\r\none of the Wardens, Mr. Allen, but this arrangement was subsequently\r\nannulled.\r\n\r\nMany more were the precepts, and the troubles in which the Company were\r\ninvolved, about this business, but it is satisfactory to record that in\r\n1623 £11 9_s._ 6_d._ was received on account of rents, and in 1625 a\r\nfurther sum of £10 0_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nThe Company were, and are still, associated in their Irish Estates with\r\nthe Ironmongers’, Brewers’, Scriveners’, Coopers’, Pewterers’, and\r\nCarpenters’ Companies; but by far the largest proportion appertains to\r\nthe Ironmongers, who have always managed the property.\r\n\r\nIn 1635, the Attorney General exhibited a Bill in the Star Chamber\r\nagainst all of the Companies to the intent that they should surrender\r\nup all their rights and evidences touching the Irish plantation, and on\r\nour Company taking Counsel’s opinion, they were advised to submit to\r\nthis monstrous piece of injustice. Judgment was given in 1637, and the\r\nIrish property of all the Companies was seized into the King’s hands.\r\nOne would have thought that this flagitious iniquity might have ended\r\nhere, but by the decree of the Star Chamber, the Citizens, in addition\r\nto the loss of their Estates, were fined £8,000 to the King, and on\r\nthe 8th November, 1638, our unhappy predecessors were assessed at, and\r\nhad to pay £64 on this account, the Ironmongers paying £272, and other\r\nCompanies according to their settled proportions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these high-handed proceedings, the Barber-Surgeons,\r\never ready to aid those in distress, voluntarily gave in 1642, what to\r\nthem in those dire days of taxation was a munificent gift, namely £20,\r\ntowards the relief of the poor Protestants in the north of Ireland, and\r\nthey further raised, under compulsion, by the sale of their plate and\r\nthe mortgage of their property, £400, which was “_lent_ for the Relief\r\nof Ireland upon the faith and order of Parliament,” and not one penny\r\nof which was ever refunded!\r\n\r\nThe illegal seizures of the Irish lands in 1637 were set aside by\r\nCharles II, who, by his Charter, 10th April, 1662, restored and\r\nconfirmed to the citizens all their former privileges and their\r\npossessions in Ireland, and thus our Company became repossessed of its\r\noriginal property there.\r\n\r\nA little previous to 1840 communications passed between the Barbers\r\nand the Ironmongers’ Companies, in reference to an appointment which\r\nhad been made by the latter Company, of Mr. Oseland as Manager of the\r\nassociated estate at a salary of £400 per annum. This appointment\r\nseems to have been made without the knowledge or concurrence of the\r\nassociated Companies, and led to some little friction, but it was no\r\ndoubt a wise step, and appears, after various protests, to have been\r\nfinally acquiesced in.\r\n\r\nOur property known as the “Lizard Estate,” was on lease for lives,\r\nthe sole surviving life being the then Bishop of Meath, who was 76\r\nyears of age. The Ironmongers, in the natural expectation of an early\r\nreversion to the estate, appointed Mr. Oseland to look after the\r\nCompanies’ interests, and from the list of his duties it would seem\r\nthat his office was no sinecure. The Bishop dying in 1840, the lease\r\nfell in, and there were various consultations among the Companies as to\r\nthe advisability of a partition or a sale, or the granting of a fresh\r\nlease. The Scriveners alone desired a partition, the others were for\r\nkeeping on the late under-lessees and tenants as tenants for a year\r\nuntil a course could be decided upon, and this was eventually agreed\r\nto, the Barbers recording in their books an expression of their sense\r\nof the wise manner in which the Ironmongers’ Company had managed the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nOne very important point discussed at Ironmongers’ Hall was that of the\r\nwaste and dilapidations which had been suffered to accrue by the late\r\nlessee. These were estimated to amount to £5,000, and there was not\r\nthe least question as to the right and power of the Companies to have\r\nenforced a claim in this respect, but they generously decided not even\r\nto present it; had the Companies been “trustees” they would have had no\r\noption but to have enforced their claim.\r\n\r\nThis action accords with the general liberal administration of Estates\r\nas pursued by the City guilds, and is another evidence (if, indeed,\r\nsuch evidence were wanting!) of the absence of greed and of the\r\ngenerous way in which tenants are treated by these bodies.\r\n\r\nThis Estate is subject to no trust whatever, it was purchased by the\r\nCompany out of monies which they collected from individual members of\r\nthe Guild, or by the sale of their plate, etc., and for many years it\r\nwas unproductive. It is a portion of their private corporate estate,\r\nand no trust or charity suffered by this voluntary abandonment of a\r\nlarge sum to which they were entitled in lieu of the re-instatement of\r\nthe dilapidation. The proceedings are all very fully set out in the\r\nCourt Minutes for 1840, 1841, etc.\r\n\r\n  6th July, 1609. This daye M{r.} Leacock, M{r.} John Martin, M{r.}\r\n  Thorney & M{r.} Peek accordinge to a pˀcept to the M{rs.} of this\r\n  Company lately directed are by this Courte appoynted Committees\r\n  for this Company to conferre w{th} the rest of the Committees of\r\n  oth{r} Companies concerninge the intended plantac͠on in the Realme\r\n  of Ireland And they are to make theire report to the next Courte of\r\n  their proceedingꝭ therein.\r\n\r\n  26th July, 1609. This daie the precept directed from the Lord Maio{r}\r\n  of this Citie to the M{rs} of this Company Concerninge a Contribution\r\n  to be had from this Company towardꝭ the intended plantac͠on in his\r\n  Ma{ties} realme of Ireland was read before the Lyvery of this Company\r\n  and before the Assistantꝭ of the Yeomandry of this Company who being\r\n  by the M{rs} demaunded by vertue of the said precept what they wold\r\n  willingly Contribute towardꝭ the said service some of them proffered\r\n  to Contribute as hereafter ensueth videliz{t} M{r.} Rodes xx{s.}\r\n  M{r.} Mapes xx{s.} Mr{r.} Jenkins xx{s.} M{r.} Thorney xl{s.} M{r.}\r\n  ffrederick xx{s.} Mr{r.} ffuller x{s.} M{r.} ffenton x{s.} M{r.}\r\n  Kerrell xx{s.} John Udall v{s.} Robert Jennings v{s.} Dominick Lumley\r\n  ij{s.} vj{d.} Andrew Mathew vj{s.} viij{d.} Thomas Homewood v{s.}\r\n  Xpõfer Walton ij{s.} vj{d.} ffrauncis Rycraft ij{s.} Arthure Doughton\r\n  ij{s.} George Pitts v{s.} Richard Daniell ij{s.} Richard Higgins\r\n  iij{s.} iiij{d.} Symon Crosse ij{s.} Thomas Clarck ij{s.} and the\r\n  rest of the Lyvery and assistauntꝭ of the yeomandrey then present\r\n  refused to Contribute anything at all. Whereupon it was thought fitt\r\n  by this Court that aswell the names of such as had proffered to\r\n  contribute as aforesaid and their severall proffered contribuc͠ons\r\n  also the names of those that refused to contribute shold accordinge\r\n  to the said precept be certefyed in writing to the Lord Maior\r\n  signifyeing further in the same Certificate that forasmuch as the\r\n  Contribuc͠on menc͠oned in the said Certificate was very small w{ch}\r\n  the M{rs} were very unwilling to present to his Lordship, the Company\r\n  were contented if it might stand w{th} his Lo{ps} good pleasure to\r\n  adventure C{li.} of the Cxxiij{li.} w{ch} is owinge unto them by the\r\n  Cities bond, so that they might have a bill of Adventure for the same.\r\n\r\n26th January, 1610. The above proposition not having been entertained,\r\na further precept dated 9th January, 1610, was received, commanding\r\nthe Company to furnish £100 and at this Court the same was considered\r\nwhen it was resolved that the common stock of the Company should\r\ncontribute £25 and an assessment be made upon the members as follows:\r\nthe Livery 20_s._, the Assistants of the Yeomanry 10_s._, Freemen 6_s._\r\n8_d._, Aliens 20_s._, and foreign brothers 15_s._ each, and by a later\r\norder each member of the Court was assessed at 20_s._\r\n\r\n22nd November, 1610. Great difficulty having been experienced in\r\ncollecting these assessments, an order was made that any person\r\nneglecting to pay, should be forthwith dismissed out of the Livery or\r\nCourt as the case might be.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1611. A precept from the Lord Mayor having been read and\r\ndebated, the following answer to the same was ordered to be sent--\r\n\r\n  Whereas wee the M{r} and Wardens of the Company of the Barbors &\r\n  surgeons of London have receaved a Preceptt of the 14{th} of this\r\n  present moneth from the right honˀable the Lord Mayo{r} of this\r\n  Cittie requiring thereby to call together the Assistauntꝭ of o{r}\r\n  said Company and to consider whether wee will accept a proportion of\r\n  Landꝭ in the province of Ulster in liewe of o{r} moneys disburssed\r\n  and thereon to buyld att our owne chardgꝭ as by the printed book\r\n  of plantac͠on is required or ells to refeir the lettinge of the\r\n  same Landꝭ unto the govˀnor & assistauntꝭ of the Companie: Soe ytt\r\n  is, that accordingly we have called together o{r} Assistauntꝭ &\r\n  consideringe the pˀmisses wee fynd that the payment of the taxac͠ons\r\n  for this intent have been soe burthensome unto the body of o{r}\r\n  Company that we are not able to take upon us any further chardge,\r\n  having not as yet levyed the ffowerth pˀte of the paymˀtꝭ ymposed\r\n  upon us, neither have we any hope to gather the same, And therefore\r\n  rather chuse to refeir the lettinge of the said Landꝭ & committinge\r\n  the business for o{r} pˀtꝭ to the discretion of the said govˀnor\r\n  & assistauntꝭ for that purpose appoynted, hopinge by their good\r\n  endeavo{rs} to receave such reasonable satisfaction for o{r} moneys\r\n  alreadye disbursed as maye gyve good contentment to such of o{r}\r\n  Company whoe have been chardged by o{r} Collections.

The Company paid in £30 to the Chamber of London,\r\nmaking £120 in all to this date.\r\n\r\n18th July, 1611. A precept having been received from the Lord Mayor,\r\ncalling upon the Wardens to pay £60 more, or else to lose the £120\r\nalready paid, the following answer was sent--\r\n\r\n  Whereas we the M{rs} & govˀno{rs} of the Company of Barbo{rs} &\r\n  Surgeons of London have receaved from the right honˀable the Lord\r\n  Mayor of this Cittie a preceptt of the xj{th} of this Instant moneth\r\n  thereby comaundinge us to call together the Assistauntꝭ of o{r} said\r\n  Company And then & there to tax the bodye of o{r} s{d} Company with\r\n  the payment of 60{li} more towardꝭ the payment of 10000{li} for a\r\n  new supplye for the plantac͠on in Ireland, And that we should advise\r\n  thereupon and certefie in wrytinge to the govˀno{r} & assistantꝭ for\r\n  the said plantac͠on on Saterdaie the 20{th} of this Instant month\r\n  of July whether we will willinglie yelde to the said supplie of\r\n  10000{li} or we wilbe content to loose all such moneys as we have\r\n  alreadye disburssed towardꝭ the said Plantac͠on and soe passe over\r\n  o{r} right therein to those as will undertake this paym{t} and all\r\n  other taxac͠ons & paymt{s} touchinge the same, Soe yt is we have\r\n  called together o{r} Assistauntꝭ & we thinck that o{r} poore Company\r\n  is put to a very hard choyce seeinge the collection of the formˀ\r\n  paymˀtꝭ of 110{li}[295] have been soe burthensome unto us that the\r\n  greatest nomber of o{r} Company have been readye to growe mutynous\r\n  about the collection thereof neither cane wee as yett gather the\r\n  same (we beinge out of o{r} owne purses for the last paym{t} w{ch}\r\n  was disburssed) and nowe to loose all, except we will undergoe this\r\n  newe taxac͠on of 60{li} the povˀtie of o{r} Company cannot beare ytt\r\n  neither will yt stand w{th} o{r} Credytts to gyve awaie the moneyes\r\n  we have collected from soe maney poore men who hoped (and the rather\r\n  by o{r} pˀswasions) the company should receave in tyme great pˀffytt.\r\n  And they themselves to be pˀtakers thereof to w{ch} intent they dide\r\n  more willinglie undergoe the former taxac͠ons. And againe to drawe\r\n  them to a chardge of a new taxac͠on when they shall understand the\r\n  offer pˀposed in this pˀcept we thinck yt unpossible, neither can we\r\n  tell howe to drawe them to paie any further taxac͠on then they shall\r\n  willinglie consent unto because we have noe lawfull authoritie to\r\n  compell them. Therefore rather then to be any further burthensome\r\n  to the bodye of o{r} Company in any further taxac͠on towardꝭ the\r\n  last supplie of 10000{li} we must be forced (yf there be lawfull\r\n  authoritie to take awaye & compell o{r} Company) to loose the moneys\r\n  we have alreadye disburssed & to leave our Interest unto such as\r\n  wilbe contentede to undertake to dischardge o{r} Company of those\r\n  paymˀtꝭ & taxac͠ons w{ch} we shall be hereafter chardged w{th}all,\r\n  and shall gyve unto our Company such assurance for pˀformaunce of\r\n  such condyc͠ons as we shall agree upon and our Counsell learned\r\n  in the lawes shall devise & requier, whereby we may gyve some\r\n  contentem{t} to those of our Company whoe have been herein chardged\r\n  for we feare we shall never collect these moneyes w{ch} are yet\r\n  behinde & unpaid for the last paym{t} when they shall here the money\r\n  alreadye disburssed is lost & gyven awaie And to this have our Court\r\n  of Assistantꝭ agreed Gyven und{r} o{r} hands the xix{th} of Julye\r\n  1611.\r\n\r\n  [295] Should be £120.\r\n\r\n  16th November, 1611. At this Court motion being made touching what\r\n  answere this howse should gyve unto the Court of Aldermen about the\r\n  payment of their money for the Irishe plantac͠on yt was ordered &\r\n  decreed that the Company should not willinglie undergoe the paym{t}\r\n  of any further taxac͠on but that rather they should loose all their\r\n  moneys alreadye disbursed and thereupon yt was thought fitt the\r\n  pˀnte M{rs} & govˀno{rs} together w{th} M{r.} Peck M{r.} Mapes\r\n  M{r.} ffenton & M{r.} ffoster should goe againe before the Court of\r\n  Aldermen to see yf they can gett the Company dischardged And if yt\r\n  shall soe fall out that they or any of them shalbe comitted or shalbe\r\n  put to any chardgꝭ touching this busynes this howse shall & will\r\n  beare & dischardge the same.\r\n\r\n  2nd February, 1612.

It was agreed by the Court to pass away all the\r\nCompany’s interest in the Irish estate to Mr. Abraham Allen, Warden, he\r\nundertaking by deed to bear all further impositions or taxations made\r\nupon the Company in respect of the Irish business.\r\n\r\n  15th July, 1613. This daie it is ordered upon a motion made by\r\n  o{r} Master to this Court touching what course they shall take for\r\n  Ireland business for that they are now called unto for payment of\r\n  60{li} wherefore upon a genˀall consent of this Court it is ordered\r\n  that M{r} Warden Allen shall lose the 30{li} w{ch} he hath already\r\n  disburssed & that he shall disburse the said 60{li} now called for,\r\n  and if he shall not be contented to goe forward w{th} the bargaine\r\n  w{ch} he formˀly made w{th} the Company but rather to loose the said\r\n  30{li} w{ch} he hath formˀly paid That then he loosing the said\r\n  30{li} already disburssed shalbe upon & after the audytt daye repaid\r\n  the said 60{li} w{ch} he is now to disbursse.\r\n\r\n  17th January, 1614.

We have however, been fortunate\r\nin preserving some very distinctive and beautiful plate, among which\r\nare no less than three Royal gifts from Sovereigns of England, viz.,\r\nHenry VIII, Charles II, and Anne.\r\n\r\nThroughout our Minutes are numerous references to gifts and purchases\r\nof plate; some of these will be found elsewhere in this work, and\r\nthe following extracts in particular referring to this subject, are\r\nadditional examples.\r\n\r\n  14th December, 1557.

Mr. Robert Allott, Doctor in Phisick of St. John’s\r\nColl: Cambridge and free of the Company, gave a large round silver salt\r\nwhite with three scrolls, and with his arms and an inscription engraved\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n1636. The Company having spent large sums of money in the erection of\r\nthe Theatre, and being short of cash, an order was made to sell the\r\nwhole of the Yeomanry’s Plate, excepting a beer bowl the gift of Mr.\r\nJames Kent.\r\n\r\n1637. It having come to the knowledge of the Court that Mr. Alexander\r\nBaker (Master 1622) had bequeathed to the Company a cup and cover which\r\nwas withheld by his executors, a suit was commenced against them.\r\n\r\n  19th May, 1637. This daye was presented to this Court by a suite &\r\n  decree made in his Ma{t}ꝭ Court of Requestꝭ one standing Cupp and\r\n  Cover gilt of M{r} Alexander Bakers gift weighing 131 ounces.\r\n\r\n  19th May, 1637.

Whereas heretofore by Order of the Lords &\r\n  Com̃ons in Parliament assembled Our Company was proporc͠oned to pay\r\n  and lend 800{li} at 8{li} pˀ cent towards and for nothing else than\r\n  the releife of Ireland. Upon which our Company did humbly certifie\r\n  the Lord Maior of the Citty of our inability to pay any part of the\r\n  said 800{li} Yet for that the present occasions forceing for presente\r\n  Releife It was Ordered That 400{li} should be taken up at Interest\r\n  and payd over into the Chamber of London for that and noe other\r\n  purpose. And that now the Company would take up such a quantity of\r\n  money but cannott obteyne soe much, It is now ordered That the Kings\r\n  Cupp and Cover shalbe kept, And that the Ma{s} & Wardens shall take\r\n  out all our plate and view it and see which of it is fitt to be sold\r\n  and that every parcell of that plate which shalbe sold a patterne\r\n  or fashion of it shalbe drawne in paper and the perticuler Letters\r\n  Writeings or Graveings shall likewise be written on that paper. To\r\n  the intent that when the said ffoure Hundred Pounds with the Interest\r\n  at 8{li} p. centum shalbe repayd the said Plate shalbe made againe in\r\n  the same ffashions & writeings upon them as now they are which this\r\n  Court doth order shall fully and really be performed accordingly when\r\n  the said 400{li} and Interest shalbe repayd.\r\n\r\nThe following entry is curious from the fact of a blank having been no\r\ndoubt purposely left in the Minutes. The Company, who had been already\r\nplucked by the Parliament, evidently feared violence in that quarter,\r\nbut were afraid to put it on record, and therefore very prudently left\r\na hiatus in the Minutes.\r\n\r\n  24th May, 1643. Whereas this Company is assessed at 8{li} pˀ weeke\r\n  for 3 moneths which they are noe wayes able to pay In regard wee are\r\n  soe much in debt and that the Hall may be preserved from violence\r\n  of . . . . . . . It is now Ordered That the plate in the Hall that is\r\n  not guilt plate shalbe by the M{r} and Wardens delivered over at the\r\n  best rate to deliver soe much amounting to 96{li.}\r\n\r\nBy the Wardens’ Accounts it appears that plate was sold to the extent\r\nof £94 16_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n29th April, 1645. On reference to p. 140, it will be seen that no less\r\nthan 1,120 oz. of plate was pawned to M{rs} Crosse.\r\n\r\n  29th April, 1646. The M{r} & Wardens acquainting this Court That the\r\n  Companye’s plate is redeemed from M{r} Steele at his request who\r\n  married M{rs} Crosse to whome it was formerly pawned in her Widowhood\r\n  and is now in the Treasury. This Court doth think it not convenient\r\n  to be kept in the house[311] and doth order that it be delivered into\r\n  the hands of M{r} John Browne[312] for the better secureity of the\r\n  200{li} this Company oweth him and of the 100{li} more which he hath\r\n  promised by M{r} Warden Browne to lend the Company at vj{li} pˀ ceñtn\r\n  pˀ anñ.\r\n\r\n  [311] Probably in fear of its being forcibly seized.\r\n  [312] An Assistant.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1646. The plate was pawned to Mr. John Browne for £300 at 6\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n29th April, 1647. It was ordered that it should be redeemed, and it was\r\non the 17th May following all brought back to the Hall.\r\n\r\n7th December, 1648. The plate was again pawned to Mr. John Browne, of\r\nWestminster, for £250.\r\n\r\n19th March, 1649. The Court were so severely pressed by Assessments for\r\nthe Army, and being unable to borrow any more money under the Company’s\r\nseal, resolved after much deliberation to absolutely sell Plate to the\r\nvalue of £300.\r\n\r\n19TH JULY, 1649. OUR M{R} ACQUAINTED THIS COURT THAT UPON SALE OF THE\r\nCOMPANYES PLATE M{R} EDWARD ARRIS BOUGHT KING HENRY THE EIGHTHS CUP AND\r\nCOVER AND HATH FREELY GIVEN IT AGAINE TO THIS COMPANY.\r\n\r\n1890. The following plate is now in the Company’s possession:\r\n\r\nA handsome standing silver gilt Grace cup and Cover (26-1/2 ozs.)\r\npresented by King Henry VIII in 1540 in commemoration of the union\r\nof the Barbers with the Surgeons. This cup is elaborately chased and\r\nenriched with badges of the Tudor Rose, Portcullis, and Fleur-de-lys;\r\nthe cover is surmounted with the Crown Imperial under which are the\r\narms of France and England quarterly, with the lyon and greyhound\r\nas supporters. There are four bells pendant from the cup which are\r\nreferred to by Pepys as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Among other observables at Chyrurgeon’s Hall we drunk the King’s\r\n  health out of a gilt cup, given by King Henry viij., to the Company,\r\n  with bells hanging at it, which every man is to ring by shaking after\r\n  he hath drunk up the whole cup.--_Diary, 27th February, 1662-3._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRACE CUP. H. viij.]\r\n\r\nThis cup although it has been stolen, pawned and sold, yet remains to\r\nus, one of the most precious relics of our past. It appears by the\r\nWardens’ Accounts, that in 1669 John Knight, Serjeant-Surgeon, who was\r\nMaster, had the cup repaired and a case made for it; Serjeant Knight\r\nwas again Master 1677-8, when he caused a plate to be fixed within the\r\ncover with this inscription--\r\n\r\n  Henrici R. Munificentia Ne Posteris Ignota Maneat Johannis Knight\r\n  R.C.P.[313] 1678.\r\n\r\n  [313] Regis Chir. Principalis (Chief Surgeon to the King).\r\n\r\nIn the bowl of the Cup is an outline engraving of the old coat of the\r\nBarbers, impaling the cognizance of the Surgeons in one shield (_see_\r\np. 435).\r\n\r\nKing Charles II in 1676 presented us with a very handsome and unique\r\nparcel gilt standing cup and cover, surmounted by the crown imperial,\r\nand having within the same the Royal arms, supporters and crown (68\r\nozs.). This Cup is known as “The Royal Oak Cup” (commemorative of\r\nthe King’s escape at Boscobel), its stem and base representing the\r\ntrunk and roots of an oak tree; the bowl or upper part is surrounded\r\nwith oak leaves, branches, wreaths of flowers, escallop shells, and\r\npendant acorns as bells from shields. The Company’s arms are engraved\r\non one shield, on another the crest, on the third is the following\r\ninscription:--“Donum Munificentissimi Regis Caroli Secundi Anno 1676,”\r\nand on the last shield--“Impetrantibus Chirurgis Regiis Johanne Knight\r\nChirurgo Regis Principali et Jacobo Pearse Eodem Anno Societatis\r\nMagistro.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING CHARLES’ CUP, QUEEN ANNE’S PUNCH BOWL AND\r\nATKINSON’S PUNCH LADLES.]\r\n\r\nThis James Pearse, surgeon to the King and the Duke of York, was Master\r\nin 1675, and his wife will be well remembered as one of Samuel Pepys’\r\nfriends and gossips.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne in 1704 presented the Company with a fine and massive punch\r\nbowl (160 ozs.) bearing this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  Societati Chirurgorum Londin: Ob fidem et diligentiam In examinandis\r\n  Chirurgis In Classe Regia merituris Dono dedit Serenissima Regina\r\n  ANNA Principum Optima 1704: Impetravit Carolus Bernardus Arm. Chir.\r\n  Reg. Pr. Hujus Societatis Magister.\r\n\r\nFour large loving cups and covers. These are all of similar design\r\nthough of different sizes, the covers have each a handle formed as\r\nan effigy of a Roman soldier, and each cup bears the Company’s arms\r\nengraved thereon.\r\n\r\n1st. Martin Browne’s cup (45 ozs.). He was an eminent Surgeon and\r\nMaster in 1653; on one side is engraved a shield quarterly, 1st and\r\n4th three Estoilles, 2nd and 3rd three Escallops and a Horn, “Charisma\r\nMartini Browne Armigeri Nuper Senatoris Ciuitatis Londinensis &\r\nPræfecti Societatis Barbitonsõr & Chirurgõr 1653.”\r\n\r\n2nd. Thomas Bowden’s cup (38 ozs.). He was third Warden 1654. On\r\none side is engraved a shield quarterly, with a lyon passant on the\r\nfirst quarter only. The motto of the Company is misspelt thus, “de\r\nPricipiencia dei,” and the cup bears this inscription, “Ex dono Thomæ\r\nBowdeni Chirurgi et hujus Societatis Gubernatorum quarti Anno Dni.\r\n1654.”\r\n\r\n3rd. Sir John Frederick’s cup (38 ozs. 10 dwt.). He was Master 1654 and\r\n1658, and Lord Mayor 1662. This cup is engraved with Sir John’s shield,\r\non a chief three doves, and the Company’s motto is again misspelt.\r\nThe inscription is, “The guift of John Fredricke Alderman and of This\r\nSocietie Master Anno Dñi 1654.”\r\n\r\n4th. Thomas Bell’s cup (65 ozs.). On one side is engraved Mr. Bell’s\r\nCoat of arms, on a chief three Bells, and there is this inscription,\r\n“The Gift of Thomas Bell Chirurgion to y{e} Worshipfull Company of\r\nBarbor Chirurgions London July 28{th} 1663.”\r\n\r\nFour silver goblets or wine cups (33 oz.). Each is inscribed--\r\n\r\n  The guift of Edward Arris Chirurgion Master of the Company Anno\r\n  Domini 1651.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN BROWNE’S AND SIR JOHN FREDERICK’S LOVING CUPS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLINS’ FLAGON, MONFORDE’S HAMMER AND ARRIS’ CUPS.]\r\n\r\nA silver flagon with handle and spout (54 oz. 10 dwt.) the gift of\r\nThomas Collins, Master 1648. The arms engraved are, on a bend three\r\nmartlets and a crescent for difference all within a bordure ermine;\r\non the other side are the Company’s arms with the motto misspelt. The\r\ninscription is--\r\n\r\n  Thomas Collins Artis Chirurgicæ Professor Peritissimus, ut Symbolum\r\n  Amoris venerabili Chirurgorum Societate hoc donauit.\r\n\r\nFive covered tankards, the first three having the Company’s arms\r\nengraved thereon.\r\n\r\n1st. Perrott’s tankard (23 oz.). “The guift of Abraham Perrott.” He was\r\nadmitted to the freedom 5th July, 1614, and gave the tankard in March,\r\n1640. (_See head piece p. 492._)\r\n\r\n2nd. Gray’s tankard (37 oz. 2 dwt.). “Ex dono Georgij Gray,” no date.\r\n\r\n3rd. Dorrington’s tankard (39 oz.). “Ex dono John Dorrington Chirurg.\r\n2{o} Aprilio A{o} 1663.”\r\n\r\n4th.

Gill.”\r\nMr. Gill was admitted to the freedom 1st February, 1670.\r\n\r\nTwo large soup tureens, the gift of William Kippax, Master 1782.\r\n\r\nEight silver sauce boats, engraved with the Company’s arms and\r\npurchased in 1766.\r\n\r\nEight curious sauce ladles, with enriched fluted handles (probably late\r\n17th century).\r\n\r\nSix antique salt cellars.\r\n\r\nFour small antique pepper castors.\r\n\r\nA large and quaint sugar castor the gift of Robert Emerton, Master\r\n1790, and another one the gift of David Lamb, Master 1794.\r\n\r\nA Silver tea urn (83 oz. 4 dwt.) inscribed “Presented by William Wood,\r\nClerk to the Company, 1790.” This elegant urn, which is oviform in\r\nshape, has been engraved in “Cripps’ College and Corporation plate” as\r\na typical example. (_See head piece p. 492._)\r\n\r\nAbout two dozen charming tea spoons, elaborately chased and engraved\r\n(circa 1730); these are also illustrated by Mr. Cripps.\r\n\r\nA dozen antique shell pattern salt spoons.\r\n\r\nTwo curious and finely worked sugar tongs.\r\n\r\nA fine old massive spoon (circa 1690), engraved “Ex dono Jonathan\r\nCheynell.”\r\n\r\nAn antique wine strainer, and another, the gift of Robert Douglas,\r\nMaster 1800.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA great quantity of spoons, forks, ladles, etc., not specially\r\ndeserving of notice.\r\n\r\nA case of fish knives and forks, the gift of George Austin, Master 1882.\r\n\r\nTwo old-fashioned silver cruet stands.\r\n\r\nA silver punch ladle with ivory handle, and a guinea of 1714 in fine\r\npreservation inlaid, inscribed “The Queen Anne’s Guinea, Given by John\r\nAtkinson Esq{r} one of the members of the Court Sep{tr} 1846.”\r\n\r\nAnother ladle with ivory handle, inscribed, “Presented to the Barbers\r\nCompany by John Atkinson Esq{r} 1851.” This ladle is inlaid with a very\r\nfine medal of 1704 in high relief, commemorating the Incorporation of\r\nthe Sons of the Clergy by Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nAnother antique punch ladle of oval shape, with hard wood handle,\r\nbelieved to have been given by Mr. John Atkinson, the date is probably\r\nabout 1620.\r\n\r\nA massive silver badge 7-1/2-in. by 8-1/2-in. of late 17th Century\r\nwork, formerly worn by the Barge master, and having the Company’s arms\r\nin relief on shield, surrounded by laurel bordering.\r\n\r\nA plain and ugly silver medal 2-1/2-ins. diameter, with arms of the\r\nCompany (badly done), on one side, and on the reverse, “Presented by\r\nJohn Carter, Master 1870-71.” This badge is worn by the first Warden.\r\n\r\nA very handsome badge, 2-3/4 inches diameter, of silver gilt open\r\nwork, and richly enamelled with the arms of the Company, and a loop\r\nrepresenting the Tudor rose crowned. This badge is worn by the Master.\r\n\r\nA pair of antique Beadle’s mace heads. These are of remarkably fine\r\nworkmanship, very massive, and have the Company’s heraldry displayed\r\nin high relief on both sides; each weighs about 64 ounces. (_See\r\nillustration p. 302._)\r\n\r\nFour very handsomely chased and wrought silver garlands or wreaths\r\nfor crowning the Master and Wardens on Election Day, and which are\r\nstill used and worn by them on Court days in receiving guests. These\r\nare the finest in the City of London; each has the Company’s arms and\r\nthe badges of the rose and crown, with other devices artistically set\r\nforth, and are mounted with silk velvet, the Renter Warden’s being\r\ngreen, and the others red. These garlands were made in 1629. (_See_\r\np. 494.)\r\n\r\nA silver mounted hammer, given by James Mumford or Monforde, King’s\r\nSurgeon and First Warden in 1540; the mountings are engraved with the\r\nTudor rose, and the arms of France and England quarterly. At the end of\r\nthe handle are the donor’s initials I.M.

It is this daye by consent of a wholl Courte\r\n  of Assistance ordered That if at any tyme hereafter any M{r} or\r\n  Governor of this company or any oth{r} pˀsone or pˀsones free of the\r\n  same mistery shall blott deface or put oute or cause to be blotted\r\n  defaced or put oute any of the pictures of any of this Company nowe\r\n  paynted or hereafter lawfully placed in any of the tables of pictures\r\n  hangeinge in the Com̃on hall of this mistery w{th}out the Consent of\r\n  a full Courte of Assistance That then hee or they so offendinge shall\r\n  forfeyte and paye for every such offence x{li} the one half thereof\r\n  to be to the use of the Chamberlen of the Cytie of London And the\r\n  oth{r} half to the use of the said mistery.\r\n\r\nThe above order was made in consequence of some members of the Court\r\nhaving painted out the faces on the pictures, and caused their own to\r\nbe depicted in their stead.\r\n\r\n  28th June, 1604. This daye it is ordered that M{r} Will{m} Martin\r\n  M{r} ffrederick M{r} ffyneinge & M{r} ffenton shall pˀsently conferre\r\n  with Decreete concerninge the ffynisheinge of the tables of Picktures\r\n  remayneinge w{th} him and if hee will finishe the same w{th} reason\r\n  and drawe them to the Hall they are to compound w{th} him for the\r\n  same if not the table is to be taken awaye from him.\r\n\r\n  10th October, 1605. This day it is ordered that the Kingꝭ picture\r\n  shalbe by the said pˀnte M{rs} boughte and pˀvided at the charge of\r\n  this house.\r\n\r\n  Item paid for his Ma{t}ꝭ picture              iiij{li}\r\n  Item geven to the paynters man that\r\n    broughte the said pycture                             ii{s}   vj{d}\r\n\r\n  1st August, 1634. It is ordered that the 41 philosophers pictures\r\n  shalbe rebeautified and repaired by M{r} Greeneburye at the Costs of\r\n  this house soe it exceede not x{li.}\r\n\r\nThe “forty-one philosophers” were former Masters of Anatomy and\r\nExaminers of Surgeons, who as they were from time to time appointed,\r\nmight if they chose, have their portraits put in what was called “The\r\nTable of the Anatomy” (and which was, I think, one large picture\r\ncontaining the effigies of forty-one persons), and the practice\r\nundoubtedly was, as occasion arose, to paint a face on old shoulders;\r\nindeed, there are many notices to this effect, as also orders of Court\r\nfor blotting out the “faces” of such as had become obnoxious, or who\r\nhad been removed for misconduct.\r\n\r\n  1st February, 1627. Item this daye upon the moc͠on of our M{r} it is\r\n  ordered by this Court that there shalbe a large wainscott frame made\r\n  and a picture maker shalbe agreed withall by the present M{rs} for\r\n  the portreying of the Anathomye and makeing of M{r} Docto{r} Gwins\r\n  picture and the Clarkes which Charge shalbe borne out of the stock\r\n  of this house, in which table shalbe placed the figures & visages of\r\n  every of the Assistants whoe are not painted in the Anathomye table\r\n  that now standeth upp in the Hall, every of the Assistants payeing\r\n  for the setting up of his owne picture.\r\n\r\n  29th March, 1647. This Court doth order That M{r} Henry Watsons\r\n  ffigure in the present Table of Anatomy be blotted out and M{r}\r\n  Charleyes Effigies placed in the roome thereof Provided that his\r\n  Executrix pay his Legacy to this House.\r\n\r\n  This Court doth order That there be a new Anathomy Table And that\r\n  all the Assistants whose Effigies are not in the present Table may\r\n  be sett up in the new Table at theire owne charge, and that Doctor\r\n  Goddards ffigure be there sett as Reader and Doctor Prudions Effigies\r\n  may be painted there if he desireth it And this Court doth order that\r\n  M{r} Watson a Brother of this Company shall make the said Table and\r\n  paint thereon the ffigure of an Anathomy with the severall ffigures\r\n  of the said Reader Doctor Prudion and our Clarke at the charge of\r\n  this House And that the ffigures of the present M{rs} of Anatomy be\r\n  there sett as Dissectors at theire owne charge.\r\n\r\n  9th August, 1647. This Court takeing into considerac͠oon the greate\r\n  benefitt and proffitt That have accrewed to this House by M{r} Edward\r\n  Arris a loveing Brother of this Company This Court doth order That\r\n  his picture be sett up in the Blanck Table in the Hall next the\r\n  Anathomy Table at the charge of this Howse.\r\n\r\n  19th August, 1647. Upon the earnest request of Mr. Edward Arris to\r\n  this Court That his Picture be nott sett up in the Hall according to\r\n  the Order of the last Court of Assistants This Court to satisfy Mr.\r\n  Arris modest request therein doth order that that order be annulled\r\n  and not put in execuc͠on.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this order Mr. Arris’ portrait was painted, and is\r\nstill at the Hall.\r\n\r\n  27th February, 1650. M{r} Arris and Doctor Scarboroughs pictures to\r\n  be sett in the void Table in the Hall at the charge of this House.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 the Court were possibly thinking of purchasing another Holbein,\r\nas the following note occurs in the minutes,\r\n\r\n  3rd March, 1720. Memorand{m} M{r} Lenthall at Burford in Oxfordshire\r\n  has a Picture of S{r} Thomas More and his familey drawn by Hans\r\n  Holben being a dispute between his Protestant Daughter and his\r\n  Catholick Daughter in the pˀsence of the father and the rest of the\r\n  familey.\r\n\r\n  21st April, 1720. It is referred to the Governors to treat with M{r}\r\n  Vertue the Ingraver about Ingraving King Henry the Eighths Picture\r\n  and to report his proposall to a Court of Assistants.\r\n\r\n27th August, 1734. The question of engraving the Picture was again\r\nreferred to a Committee.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1734. The Committee reported, the result being that Mr.\r\nBernard Baron entered into an agreement to engrave a plate; the details\r\nof the arrangements with him are all set out in the minutes, but are\r\nnot sufficiently interesting to warrant transcribing.\r\n\r\nBaron’s engraving is well known and sought after by collectors, but it\r\nhas a peculiarity, being a complete reverse of the original picture.\r\nEach Assistant is presented with a copy on his election on to the Court.\r\n\r\nWe formerly had a portrait of Dr. Tyson, Anatomy Reader, but this was\r\nsold to one of his descendants in 1745 for ten guineas.\r\n\r\n10th November, 1777. Mr. William Slade, an Assistant, presented a\r\nmezzotint engraving of the portrait of John Paterson, Esq., formerly\r\nClerk of the Company; the original was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.\r\nThis engraving is now hung in the committee room.\r\n\r\n                                         GUILDHALL, 31 October, 1832.\r\n    GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n  Having become possessed a few years since of a perfect copy of\r\n  Hollar’s engraved view of London A.D. 1647, representing the most\r\n  striking appearance of the metropolis as it existed previously to\r\n  the conflagration in 1666, and thinking it might be acceptable to\r\n  the Lovers of the Antiquities of this ancient and renowned City that\r\n  so authentic a Memorial of its then state should be preserved and\r\n  transmitted to future ages by Multiplication of Copies.\r\n\r\n  I have had it carefully and correctly Lithographed, and request\r\n  that your Worshipful Court will be pleased to accept the impression\r\n  herewith transmitted to be placed in the Archives of the Company of\r\n  Barbers.\r\n\r\n               I have the honor to be, GENTLEMEN,\r\n                          Your most obed{t.} Servant,\r\n                                              W. L.

Shoppee.\r\n\r\nALDERMAN ARRIS’ PICTURE. This picture was painted by Mr. Greenbury who\r\nwas employed as Portrait Painter to the Company at this period.\r\n\r\nDR. CHARLES SCARBOROUGH AND ALDERMAN ARRIS’ PICTURE. This picture was\r\nalso painted by Mr. Greenbury as by the following extract from the\r\nWardens’ Accounts for 1651 appears--\r\n\r\n  Paid to Greenburye for Painting the Picture of     _li._ _s._ _d._\r\n    M{r} Edward Arris and Doctor Charles\r\n    Scarborough & Anathomye                             9   10    0\r\n\r\nLINNEUS’ PICTURE. This picture of Linneus was purchased 2nd July, 1844,\r\nfor £3 3_s._, the particulars of the purchase and of the picture are\r\nset out in the Court Minutes of this date. Mr. Shoppee has surmised\r\nthat this is a portrait of John Bancks, but though his portrait was\r\n_ordered_ to be painted, I do not find that it ever was, and it is not\r\nonce mentioned in any of the numerous early inventories of pictures.\r\nThe Minutes of 1844 are, however, so precise as to leave no further\r\ndoubt on this point, viz., that it is a portrait of Linneus.\r\n\r\nTHE HOLBEIN PICTURE.\r\n\r\nKING CHARLES II PICTURE, artist unknown. Purchased by the Company\r\n1720-1721.\r\n\r\nINIGO JONES’ PICTURE, by Sir A. Vandyke.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS LISLE’S PICTURE, artist unknown.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN FREDERICK’S PICTURE, artist unknown. Purchased by the Company,\r\n1665-1666.\r\n\r\nSERJEANT-SURGEON CHARLES BERNARD’S PICTURE. This picture was painted by\r\nMr. Murray in 1711, the Company paying him £12 10_s._ for it.\r\n\r\nTHE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND’S PICTURE, by Sir Peter Lely.\r\n\r\nHENRY JOHNSON’S PICTURE, artist unknown. Mr. Johnson was Master 1677;\r\nhe has been erroneously described as “Serjeant Surgeon” and “Serjeant\r\nKnight,” but never held the first office, and there is no such dignity\r\nas “Serjeant Knight.” The fact is that Mr. Johnson dying in his year of\r\nMaster, was succeeded by John Knight, Serjeant Surgeon (commonly called\r\n“Serjeant Knight”) and Mr. Knight’s name being so written under Mr.\r\nJohnson’s in an old list of Masters, has been taken as the title of an\r\noffice!\r\n\r\nEPHRAIM SKINNER’S PICTURE, artist unknown.\r\n\r\nBERNARD BARON’S red crayon study of Holbein’s picture.\r\n\r\n“TWO SPANISH PICTURES.” These were so called in the old Inventories.\r\nThere was also in the Inventory of 1720 “A picture of the Prince\r\nElector Palatine,” but this subsequently disappeared, though the\r\n“Spanish pictures” remained in the Inventories for many years. Mr.\r\nShoppee suggests that they are the portraits of Frederick Casimir and\r\nhis wife Elizabeth. At the top of one of them is a shield of arms,\r\nbeing the coat of Byrkes or Brykes.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ANNE’S PICTURE, artist unknown.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing Pictures are hung in the Court Room. In the Committee\r\nRoom are various pictures, engravings and portraits of recent Masters.\r\n\r\nIn the Vestibule to the Court Room is an ancient list of Masters and\r\nWardens on Vellum, enclosed with oak folding doors. It is not, however,\r\nvery accurate. It was at the Hall in 1720, and probably for many years\r\npreviously. The list was rewritten over the old lettering in 1865.\r\n(_See head piece, p. 1._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES OF EMINENT MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY NEVILL, FOURTH LORD OF BURGAVENNY.\r\n\r\nThis Lord was the son of Sir George Nevill, third Lord of Burgavenny,\r\nby Mary, daughter of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded his father in 1535, and was admitted to the freedom of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons on the 26th August, 1584. In 1586 he was one of the\r\nCommissioners appointed to try Mary Queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nFor striking the Earl of Oxford in the Chamber of Presence, he was put\r\nunder arrest, but managed shortly after to obtain a pardon and his\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nHe married Frances, daughter of Thomas Earl of Rutland, by whom he left\r\nat his decease, 10th February, 1557, an only daughter Elizabeth (the\r\nwife of Sir Thomas Fane), who was subsequently created Baroness le\r\nDespencer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD WINDSOR.\r\n\r\n  25th June, 1631.

Alsoe the said Thomas Lord\r\n  Windsor was by o{r} M{r} received into the Clothing or livery of this\r\n  Companie and had a livery hood layed upon his lo{ps} shoulder.\r\n\r\nLord Windsor at one time resided in Monkwell Street, close to the Hall;\r\nhe was chosen a Knight of the Bath 1610, at the creation of Henry,\r\nPrince of Wales. He was subsequently Rear-Admiral of the Fleet sent\r\nby James I to bring Prince Charles out of Spain, and on that occasion\r\nentertained on board ship the Grandees of the Court of Spain with\r\nprincely magnificence. His Lordship married Lady Katherine Somerset\r\ndaughter of Edward, fourth Earl of Worcester, K.G., but dying without\r\nissue on the 6th June, 1642, he was succeeded by his nephew Thomas\r\nWindsor-Hickman, the son of his elder sister Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF MONMOUTH, K.G.\r\n\r\nJames Scott, the natural son of Charles II, was born 9th April, 1649,\r\nand created Duke of Monmouth in 1663. The same year, on the 7th May,\r\nhe was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons, in company with\r\nAlexander Lord Leven, Richard Hopton, and Thomas Rosse, Esquires.\r\n\r\nThe history of this unfortunate man is well known, and culminated in\r\nhis being beheaded on the 15th July, 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, SECOND EARL OF LEVEN.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was the grandson of the celebrated General Sir Alexander\r\nLeslie, First Earl of Leven, whom he succeeded in 1662. On the 7th May,\r\n1663, he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons, in company\r\nwith the Duke of Monmouth.\r\n\r\nHe married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Howard, and sister of the\r\nEarl of Carlisle, but died without issue male, in 1663. His kinsman\r\nGeorge, fourth Lord Melville, was a staunch adherent of the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, and involved in the rebellion, but was lucky enough to escape\r\ninto Holland; he was, however, attainted and his estates forfeited\r\nin 1685, but coming back to England with William III his estates and\r\ndignity were restored to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN AYLEF.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat of Arms]\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN AYLEF was an eminent Surgeon and probably born about 1490.\r\nDiligent search has been made for his parentage, but without success.\r\nIn his will he refers to seven “poor” people “being of my kynn dwelling\r\nin Grenewiche,” and from the fact that he had a grant of arms instead\r\nof inheriting a paternal coat, as also the silence of his immediate\r\ndescendants when registering the pedigrees at the Heralds’ Visitations\r\n(who must have known but did not care to register Sir John’s father),\r\nit may be assumed that he was of humble origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Family tree - handwritten]\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers prior to 1522 and served\r\nthe office of Warden 1530, 1532 and 1535, being chosen Master 1538.\r\nAt this time he was Surgeon to Henry VIII and had cured him of a\r\nfistula, for which the king granted him the manor of Gryttenham in\r\nWiltshire, part of the lands of the Abbey of Malmesbury. Henry also\r\nbequeathed by his will 100 marks to Aylef.\r\n\r\nMr. Aylef, being elected on 1st August, 1548, served the office of\r\nSheriff 1548-9, and in Wriothesley’s Chronicle under date 1549 we read--\r\n\r\n  The third daie of March being Shrove Sondaie M{r} Henry Amcottes Lord\r\n  Maior of London was presented to the Kinges Maiestie at his pallace\r\n  at Westminster.

He seems to have relinquished his profession of a Surgeon and\r\nto have become a Merchant, holding the important office of Master of\r\nBlackwell Hall, one of the greatest commercial centres of the period,\r\nand residing at the Hall, in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th May, 1550, he was chosen the first Alderman of the\r\nnewly-created ward of Bridge Without, some interesting particulars\r\nof which may be seen in Stow’s Survey (ed. 1633, p. 446); while in\r\nWriothesley’s Chronicle, under date 1550, we also read--\r\n\r\n  Memorandum. Wednesday in the Whitson weeke, at a Court of the\r\n  Aldermen kept in the Guyldhall, Sir John Aliffe, Knight, and master\r\n  of Blackwell Hall, was sworne an alderman of the Bridg ward without,\r\n  and to have the jurisdiction of the Borough of Southwark, and 2\r\n  deputies to be appointed there to assist him, which was the first\r\n  alderman that ever was there, which was done by the advise of my Lord\r\n  Mayor and thˀ Aldermen, for the better order to be kept there, and\r\n  for the more quietnes of the Mayors hereafter to come, and the good\r\n  order of the Kinges subjectes there, accordinge to the lawes of the\r\n  City; and the Fryday after he rode with my Lord Mayor all the precint\r\n  of Southwarke, my Lord Mayor havinge a certeine nomber of the honest\r\n  persons of the borough at the bridg-house, to whom he shewed theyr\r\n  alderman, and appointed deputies under him, and so hereafter to see a\r\n  good order to be kept in the Borough, as in other wardes of the citye\r\n  of London.\r\n\r\nSir John subsequently removed to his old ward of Dowgate (and continued\r\nAlderman there till his death, his successor being chosen 12th\r\nNovember, 1556). After his election as Alderman he was translated to\r\nthe Grocers’ Company, of which ancient guild he was crowned Upper\r\nWarden, 9th June, 1556, in view of his election as Lord Mayor for\r\nwhich he stood next in nomination, and to which office, had he lived\r\nbut a few weeks longer, he would in all probability have been chosen.\r\nHe was married to Isabel Buckell of Warwickshire, and by her had four\r\nchildren, John, Erkynwald, Mary and Alice. His son John and great\r\ngrandson George, were both knighted. His widow, Dame Isabel, had a\r\ngrant of arms by Thomas Hawley (3 & 4 Ph. & M.) ar. a fesse vaire or\r\nand az. betw. three doves ppr. bearing in their beaks a branch gu.

In 1539 Henry granted\r\nhim a beneficial lease for 21 years of the Rectory and tithes of the\r\ndissolved Abbey of Boxley in Kent. In 1541 Vicary was chosen Master\r\nof the Barber-Surgeons, to which office he was again elected in 1546,\r\n1548, and 1557 having thus held the chief place in the Company no\r\nless than five times--an honour to which no other member has ever\r\nattained. In the Holbein picture Vicary is represented as receiving the\r\nCharter from the King. In 1542 he and his son William were appointed\r\nby the King Bailiffs of the Manor of Boxley, and five years later he\r\nmarried his second wife, Alice Bucke. In 1548 Vicary was appointed a\r\nGovernor of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and soon afterwards became the\r\nResident Surgical Governor there; in June, 1552, he was made “one of\r\nthe assistants of this house (St. Bartholomew’s) for the terme of his\r\nlyffe.” In 1548 he published his celebrated book “The Anatomie of the\r\nbodie of man,” no copy of the first edition of which is now known to\r\nbe extant. On the 27th January, 1561, Vicary made his will, which was\r\nproved in London 7th April, 1562. The will, which is set out in full in\r\nDr. Furnivall’s book, is too long to give here _in extenso_, but the\r\nfollowing extracts will be found of interest.\r\n\r\n[319] This notice of Vicary is partially condensed from the exhaustive\r\naccount of him, written by Dr. F. J. Furnivall, and published in the\r\nEarly English Text Society.

He was twice Master of the Barber-Surgeons,\r\nviz., in 1551 and 1562.\r\n\r\nHis will, dated 17th March, 1566, was proved on the 22nd April, 1566,\r\nwherein he describes himself as “Richard Ferres Serjant Surgion unto\r\nthe quenes majestie, sick of bodie.” He gives to “Em,” his wife, his\r\nhouse, field, and orchard at Paddington for her life, with remainder\r\nto his daughter Thomazine, and to her also the lease of the house\r\nwhere he then dwelt in St. Giles, Cripplegate.

Among the Domestic State Papers, Henry\r\nVIII, Vol. I (No. 4064) is the grant of a corrody or sustentation from\r\nthe Monastery of Abbotsbury to Robert Pen “one of the Gentlemen of the\r\nChapel” and to John Pen, his son, for life. The date of this document\r\nis 9th March, 1514, and as John Pen was a retainer of the King’s,\r\nwhich this grant would also seem to imply, and had a son whom he named\r\nRobert, there is the possibility that this Robert Pen, the Gentleman of\r\nthe Chapel, was his father.\r\n\r\nJohn Pen was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers in 1527, and his\r\nbirth may probably be put at 1500-1505. He was by profession a barber,\r\nand evidently a friend of King Henry VIII, who advanced him from Groom\r\nof the Privy Chamber to the honorable position of King’s Barber, an\r\noffice which was only bestowed upon the most trusty and confidential of\r\nthe King’s attendants; the life of the sovereign being in his barber’s\r\nhands. (_See_ pp. 90 and 91.)\r\n\r\nPen served the office of Master in 1539, and his portrait is in the\r\nHolbein picture. He married, about 1530, Lucy, daughter and heiress\r\nof Edmond Chevall of Sissivernes, in Codicote, Herts, and by her he\r\nhad a good estate. In 1545 Henry granted him the manor of Codicote and\r\nthe demesne lands of the late dissolved Abbey of St. Alban’s for £826\r\n9_s._ 4-1/2_d._, to hold by the forty-fifth part of a knight’s fee.\r\nThe King also bequeathed him 100 marks by his will. By an Inquisition\r\ntaken at West Barnet 18th October, 5 & 6 Ph. & M., it was found that\r\nJohn Pen died 21st August, 1558, and that Thomas, his son and heir, was\r\nthen of the age of 25 years and 9 months. John Pen’s Will, dated 15th\r\nAugust, 1558, was proved by his widow on the 6th May, 1559. Coleman\r\nin his list of Wills of the Pen family states that a second grant of\r\nProbate was taken of this Will by Gyles Pen on 10th October, 1560, but\r\nthis is absolutely incorrect; on this date the Will of one Gyles Peny\r\nof Halstocke in Dorsetshire was proved, and Mr. Coleman has confounded\r\nthis in a remarkable way with John Pen’s Will, with which it has no\r\nconnection whatever. That Pen was not, or did not know that he was,\r\na connection of the Pens of Bucks, is most likely, as he obtained a\r\ngrant of arms for himself, in which the combs on either side of the\r\nlion of England are typical of his office of King’s Barber.

He seems to\r\nhave amassed a considerable estate and to have made a rather lengthy\r\nwill, but as a great deal of it is of much interest, especially his\r\ninventory of surgical instruments and books, no apology is needed for\r\nquoting largely from it.\r\n\r\n  I do give and bequeathe my sowle to the holy and blessed Trinitie\r\n  the ffather the sonne and the holy ghost three persons and one\r\n  God allmightie hoping and stedfastly beleevinge to be forgiven\r\n  and pardoned of all my sinnes and to enjoye the everlastinge and\r\n  unspeakable felicities of heaven through the merrittꝭ and passion\r\n  of my only redeemer and saviour Jesus Christ to whome be given all\r\n  glorie honor and praise nowe and for ever Amen.\r\n\r\nTo poor people in the discretion of his executrix £10.

Fifteen Members of the Court of Assistants were\r\nnominated to attend Mr. Sheriff Proby on Michaelmas eve and the next\r\nday, and all charges and expenses which they might incur were to be\r\nborne by the Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1616, Sir Peter who had previously been appointed Governor of the\r\ncolony of Ulster by special commission from the King and the City\r\nof London, repaired thither, attended by divers of the most eminent\r\ncitizens, to regulate certain affairs belonging to the plantation,\r\ntaking with him two rich swords of state as a present from the City, to\r\nbe carried before the Mayors of Londonderry and Coleraine, the former\r\nhaving been some time before erected into a city and the latter into a\r\nMayor-town.\r\n\r\n8th June, 1622. At a Court held this day Alderman Proby was ordered to\r\nbe translated to the Grocers’ Company, in view of his coming election\r\nas Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n  20th September, 1622.

His second son, Henry, was Common Serjeant of\r\nLondon. Sir Peter was the ancestor of several members of Parliament\r\nas also of the Marquess of Rockingham and the Earl of Carysfort. His\r\ngrandson Peter Proby, who married Grace, daughter of Sir Richard Ford,\r\nwas chosen a Liveryman of the Company 10th March, 1659.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Proby’s will (undated) was proved 21st March, 1625, and\r\ncommences--\r\n\r\n  I Peter Proby Knight and Alderman of London calling to minde the\r\n  transitory estate of all flesh and more perticulerly the great age\r\n  w{ch} through gods especiall goodnes I have attayned, as alsoe the\r\n  weake estate of my body broken of late w{th} many sicknesses and\r\n  infirmities w{ch} still hanging one mee as be many monito{rs} unto\r\n  me to pˀvide for my approachinge change and settlinge of that poore\r\n  state wherew{th} it hath pleased god to blesse mee.\r\n\r\nHe gives to his wife Dame Elizabeth Proby (of whom he speaks in terms\r\nof the greatest affection) his manor of Allington, _alias_ Aylton,\r\nHunts, for 40 years, if she shall so long live, with remainder to\r\nhis son Heneage, also to his wife his mansion and manor house of\r\nCaddington, Herts, with the demesne lands of that manor and the tithes\r\nthereof, also all his lands, tenements, and hereditaments in Luton and\r\nDunstable with remainder to his son Henry, also to his wife his house\r\nin St. Swithin’s Lane, London.

He was born about 1540, and\r\nstudied surgery under Mr. George Keble, who was not free of our\r\nCompany, but of whom Clowes more than once speaks in terms of highest\r\npraise. He tells us that in 1563 he served as a Surgeon in the army\r\nunder the Earl of Warwick at Havre, and after this campaign he was for\r\nsome time in the Navy, in both which appointments he undoubtedly gained\r\ngreat experience. In 1569 he no doubt settled in London, as on the 8th\r\nof November in that year he was admitted to the freedom by translation,\r\nand he soon secured a large practice, though it was not until the 18th\r\nJuly, 1588, that he was made an Assistant of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe records do not display Mr. Clowes’ character in the most favourable\r\nlight, as the following extracts will show:--\r\n\r\n  6th October, 1573. Here was one & complayned [against] Willm̄ Clowes\r\n  for takynge his money and he not cured.\r\n\r\n  7th February, 1575. Here came one Willm̄ Goodnep and complayned of\r\n  Willm̄ Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was\r\n  awarded that the saide Clowes sholde either geve the saide Goodnep\r\n  xx{s} orells cure his saide wief w{ch} Clowes agreed to pay the xx{s}\r\n  and so they were agreed and eche of them made acquittance to other.\r\n\r\n  28th February, 1576. Here was a complainte against Willm̄ Clowes by\r\n  one Goodenge for that the saide Clowes had not onlie misused the\r\n  saide Goodinge in speche but also most of the masters of the Company\r\n  w{th} scoffing wordes and jestes, and they all forgave him here\r\n  openlye in the Co{r}te and so the stryfe was ended upon condˀ that he\r\n  sholde nev{r} so misuse him self agayne and bonds was caused to be\r\n  made to that effect.\r\n\r\n  25th March, 1577. Here at this Corte was a greate contension and\r\n  stryffe spoken of and ended betwene George Baker and Willm̄ Clowes\r\n  for that they bothe contrary to order and the good and holsome rules\r\n  of this howse misused eche other and fought in the ffelds togethers.\r\n  But the M{r} Wardens and assistance wishing that they might be and\r\n  continewe loving brothers pˀdoned this greate offence in hope of\r\n  amendement.\r\n\r\nThe George Baker with whom Clowes fought, was afterwards\r\nSerjeant-Surgeon and Master of the Company in 1597. In 1575 Mr. Clowes\r\nwas appointed one of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and\r\nlater on he was surgeon to Christ’s Hospital; he was also surgeon to\r\nQueen Elizabeth and James I. His first book, “De morbo Gallico,” was\r\npublished in 1579. In 1585 he went as surgeon of the forces in the\r\nexpedition to the Low Countries under the Earl of Leicester. In his\r\nbook, “Proved Practise,” he tells a great deal of this expedition and\r\nsays that many of the surgeons were most unskilful and “slew more than\r\nthe enemy did,” though he and his friend Serjeant-Surgeon Gooderus\r\n(Master 1594) did not lose a case. Mr. Clowes had the honour of serving\r\nin the fleet which defeated the Spanish Armada, and in 1594 was Warden\r\nof the Barber-Surgeons, the last Court which he attended was on the 9th\r\nFebruary, 1596. After a successful practice he retired to a country\r\nhouse at Plaistow, in Essex, and died in 1604. Dr. Norman Moore says\r\nthat his books “are the best surgical writings of the Elizabethan age;\r\nthey are all in English, and his style is very easy and forcible,\r\nsometimes a little prolix but never obscure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CLOWES, JUN., SERJEANT-SURGEON.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of William Clowes, Barber-Surgeon; born about 1582,\r\nhe was apprenticed to his father and admitted to our freedom 22nd\r\nJanuary, 1605, and on 13th December, 1615, called to the Livery; he\r\nwas then surgeon to the Prince of Wales, and had a dispensation from\r\nthe Court of the Company to attend the lectures and Hall only on such\r\noccasions as should be convenient to him. On the accession of Charles I\r\nhe was made Serjeant-Surgeon to the King. In 1626 he was Master of the\r\nCompany, and again in 1638. A characteristic letter of Serjeant Clowes\r\nand some particulars as to his election as Master in 1626 may be seen\r\non pp. 248-250. On 30th October, 1648, his decease was reported to the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nBy his will, dated 28th March, 1630, he bequeathed his property\r\nfreehold and copyhold, to his wife Sara, his son James, and his\r\ndaughters Ann and Sara.\r\n\r\nArms.

He was made free 8th\r\nApril, 1573, and elected an Assistant 19th June, 1595; he served as\r\nWarden in 1598 and 1600 and was twice Master of the Company, viz., in\r\n1602 and 1606, he was also a Common Councilman. Mr. Thorney acquired\r\nconsiderable property in Holborn and the country, but dying on 4th\r\nJune, 1614, without issue, made his nephew Peter (son of his then\r\ndeceased brother Walter) his heir. He was a considerable benefactor to\r\nthe Parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, where there is a monumental tablet\r\nto his memory. His Will dated 25th May, 1612, was proved on the day of\r\nhis death, and among other bequests to St. Andrew’s Holborn, he left\r\n£10 to the Churchwardens--\r\n\r\n  to make a Dynner or supper therwith and to make merrie therewith with\r\n  my good neighboures for my sake and to encrease neighbourelie love\r\n  amongest them And the Churchwardens to bid the parson and Minister\r\n  to be with them. Item I give to the Company of Barbar Surgions twoe\r\n  spowte pottꝭ of silver and guilt one all guilte and the other\r\n  parcell guilte to the valewe of twentie poundes and the Thorne bushe\r\n  to be graven on either of them and the Barber Surgeons armes and my\r\n  name at lardge and some wordes to shewe that they were of my guifte\r\n  Item I give likewise to the Company of Barbor surgions of London that\r\n  shall followe me at my ffunerall fyve poundꝭ to make a Dynner with\r\n  and to be merrye for my sake and to the entent to encrease brotherlie\r\n  love amongest them The said ffyve poundes to be paied to the Master\r\n  and Wardens when they come to fetch my bodye to the churche.\r\n\r\nTo his wife Annie he gave his dwelling house in Holborn, and another\r\nnewly built house there, also one on the street side next the Bars, and\r\nthe third part of all his other lands for her life and all his goods\r\nand movables. To Richard Cade “my auncient and honest servaunte” and\r\nto Jane his wife 40_s._ each for rings. To his nephew, Peter Thorney,\r\nhis houses in Fetter Lane, the Bell Inn at Acton, a dwelling house at\r\nActon, and the King’s Head in Holborn near the Bars, with a proviso\r\nthat should Peter die without heirs the Bell at Acton was to pass to\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER THORNEY.\r\n\r\nPETER THORNEY was apprenticed to his uncle Thomas Thorney and admitted\r\nto the freedom 14th July, 1603. He seems to have got into good practice\r\nand was one of the Army Surgeons. He was appointed Surgeon-General\r\nof the Army going to the relief of Rochelle, and made his will a few\r\ndays afterwards (25th July, 1628) with a presentiment of his death,\r\nwhich was soon realised, as probate was granted on the 24th November\r\nfollowing. He says--\r\n\r\n  I com̃end my bodie to bee buried where it shall please god or my\r\n  freindes, if I come not home from the Sea this voiage I intended for\r\n  the releife of Rochell, but if it shall please god that I die in\r\n  England if it maiebee possible I would bee buried in S{t} Andrews\r\n  Church as neare to my Unckle M{r} Thomas Thorney as maie bee.\r\n\r\nAmong other bequests he gives five marks to such of the livery of the\r\nCompany as shall follow him to the Church; he makes his son Thomas\r\n(then under age) his heir generally and provides for his wife Ann and\r\ndaughter Elizabeth; he leaves to George Peren, Barber-Surgeon, his\r\n“yearball knowne by the name of Gerardꝭ yearball.”[338]\r\n\r\n[338] Gerard’s Herball.\r\n\r\n  But if it shall please god soe that both my children shall die\r\n  without issue Then my will is that y{e} Bell in Acton shall remaine\r\n  for evˀ to the Company of the berber surgeons of London according as\r\n  my unckle M{r} Thomas Thorney hath hertofore bequeathed it.\r\n\r\n  Item I give to Edward Griffith which was my Servant all my\r\n  manuscriptꝭ belonginge to surgerie and all my instrumentꝭ belonging\r\n  to Surgery except my plaster box and salvatory and instruments in the\r\n  boxe and my silver seringe, and likewise unto the said Edward all my\r\n  medicines whatsoever I give him w{th} my bookes of Surgery whatsoever\r\n  in my Studdie.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN GERARD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat of Arms]\r\n\r\nJOHN GERARD was born in 1545 at Nantwich in Cheshire, his parentage\r\nis unknown, though by his coat of arms he appears to have descended\r\nfrom the Gerards of Ince in Lancashire. In 1562 he was apprenticed to\r\nAlexander Mason, a Surgeon in extensive practice, who was Warden in\r\n1556 and 1561 and Master in 1567 and 1573 (Mr. Mason died 3rd April,\r\n1574). Gerard was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons 9th\r\nDecember, 1569. There is no record of his admission to the Livery,\r\nthough in consequence of his professional attainments and his\r\npresumable friendship with his master who made him free, he doubtless\r\nhad the clothing at the same time. The only note we have of Gerard,\r\nbefore he comes on the Court, is one in which he appears before the\r\nMasters as defendant in a case of alleged slander on the wife of a\r\nbrother freeman.\r\n\r\n  21st February, 1578. Here was a complainte against Jo: Jerrard for\r\n  saying that Richard James his wief had the ffrenche pocks, and he\r\n  made answere and saide he wolde justifie the same, and he was dismist\r\n  to the Comon Lawe.\r\n\r\nGerard was elected a Member of the Court of Assistants on the 19th\r\nJune, 1595. For some long time previous he must have been engaged in\r\nthe preparation of his great work “_The Herball or Generall Historie of\r\nPlantes_,” a folio of some 1,400 pages, embellished with about 1,800\r\nillustrations of plants,[339] and published in 1597, which, whilst\r\nit was by far the best and most exhaustive work of its kind at that\r\nperiod, has ever since been considered a standard book of reference;  a\r\ngood copy being now worth 8 to 10 guineas. At this period he was living\r\n“at my house in Holburne, within the suburbs of London,” probably near\r\nFetter Lane, where he had a large garden of herbs.\r\n\r\n[339] The woodcuts for these illustrations were procured from\r\nFrankfort, and originally executed for the German Herbal of\r\nTabernæmontanus.\r\n\r\nThe style of Gerard’s writing was very quaint, and abounds with quiet\r\nhumour; he scouted monkish tales and old wives’ fables concerning the\r\nmiraculous properties of plants, etc., honestly endeavouring to present\r\nfacts to his readers; yet even he has not hesitated to record as true,\r\nand gravely set forth, some fabulous stories, as, for example, in\r\nspeaking of Barnacles on p. 1391, he says--\r\n\r\n  There is a small Ilande in Lancashire called the Pile of Foulders,\r\n  wherein are found the broken peeces of old and brused ships . . .\r\n  wheron is found a certaine spume or froth, that in time breedeth unto\r\n  certaine shels, in shape like those of the muskle, . . . wherein is\r\n  conteined a thing in forme like a lace of silke finely woven, as it\r\n  were togither, of a whitish colour; one end whereof is fastned unto\r\n  the inside of the shell; . . . the other end is made fast unto the\r\n  belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time commeth to the shape &\r\n  forme of a Bird: when it is perfectly formed, the shel gapeth open, &\r\n  the first thing that appeereth is the foresaid lace or string; next\r\n  come the legs of the Birde hanging out; and as it groweth greater, it\r\n  openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it is all come foorth,\r\n  and hangeth onely by the bill; in short space after it commeth\r\n  to full maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth\r\n  feathers, and groweth to a foule, bigger then a Mallard, and lesser\r\n  than a Goose; having blacke legs and bill or beake, and feathers\r\n  blacke and white, spotted in such maner as is our Magge-Pie, called\r\n  in some places a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by no\r\n  other name than a tree goose; which place aforesaide, and all those\r\n  parts adjoining, do so much abound therewith, that one of the best\r\n  is bought for three pence: for the truth heerof, if any doubt, may\r\n  it please them to repaire unto me, and I shall satisfie them by the\r\n  testimonie of good witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe woodcut illustrations with which the book abounds are designed\r\nin a good artistic style, being frequently consulted and adapted\r\nnowadays by artists engaged in floral design. In 1596, Gerard seems\r\nto have propounded a scheme for the Company to keep a garden for the\r\ncultivation and study of medicinal plants, and some land belonging to\r\nthe Company in East Smithfield was suggested for this purpose, but not\r\nbeing thought a suitable spot, certain members of the Court offered to\r\ncontribute towards the purchase of a garden elsewhere; in June, 1597,\r\nthe subject was under consideration, and again in November, 1602; but\r\nwhether anything further was done in the matter does not appear. The\r\nminutes in our books relating to this business, are as follows--\r\n\r\n  26th March, 1596. A motion was also made concerninge the Demisinge\r\n  of certen garden grounds at East Smithfield for the w{ch} M{r}\r\n  ffettyplace, M{r} Lacock and John Gerard were sevˀall Sutors. Yt was\r\n  agreed that the same should be let for yerely rent at the pleasures\r\n  of the masters or governors and none of the said sutors obteyned any\r\n  graunte. But for as muche as John Gerard’s request was to have yt to\r\n  make a garden of yt for the ffurtherance of learning in the knowledge\r\n  and practiqe of the nature and skill of herbes, w{ch} was thought\r\n  not a place ffytt for that pˀpose, but that a more convenient place\r\n  should be sought owte and dyvers of the Companie did offer to be\r\n  contributors for the buying of the same, and M{r} ffetiplace and M{r}\r\n  Lacock are to be spoken w{th}all and thus to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n  16th June, 1597. At the request of M{r} Peck[340] and M{r} Gerat\r\n  yt was agreed at this Corte that those whose names are here after\r\n  menc͠oned should survey a peece of ground ffyt to make a Garden for\r\n  to plant all kinde of herbes in routes plantes and suche like as to\r\n  the saide M{r} Gerat being a skilfull Herbalist should thinck meete\r\n  for the wo{r}shipp of this societie, and to relate their opinions and\r\n  acc͠ons therein to this howse and societie for the further pˀceding\r\n  therein, viz{t} M{r} John Isard[341] M{r} Lewes Atmer[342] M{r} Cox\r\n  M{r} Wood[343] M{r} Sprignell[344] M{r} Borne[345] Jeames Bates[346]\r\n  M{r} Thomas Waren[347] M{r} Bovy[348] M{r} Byrd[349] M{r} Gale[350]\r\n  M{r} Laycock[351] M{r} Jo Martin[352] or any viij. x. or the most\r\n  pˀte of them.\r\n\r\n  [340] John Peck, Master 1605 and 1610.\r\n  [341] Warden 1590, 1593, 1596.\r\n  [342] W. 1601.\r\n  [343] Master 1591.\r\n  [344] W. 1584, 1587, 1591.\r\n  [345] M. 1600.\r\n  [346] W. 1591, 1595, 1597.\r\n  [347] W. 1596.\r\n  [348] M. 1617.\r\n  [349] M. 1590.\r\n  [350] M. 1595.\r\n  [351] M. 1598, 1604.\r\n  [352] M. 1601.\r\n\r\n  2nd November, 1602. This daye it is ordered that the Committes for\r\n  M{r} Gerrard’s garden shall this aft{r} noone meet at the hall to\r\n  consider of the report for a Garden for the said M{r} Gerrard.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1597, John Gerard was chosen Junior Warden (George Baker,\r\nthe Queen’s Serjeant-Surgeon being at the same time elected Master),\r\nand in January following he was appointed one of the Examiners of\r\nSurgeons. In 1604, there had been controversies between Gerard and\r\nChristopher Frederick (Master 1609), which on the 12th June were\r\nreferred to a Committee of the Court for settlement. “And if they\r\nno ende can make they are to make report at the next Court of their\r\npˀcedinges therein.”\r\n\r\n  26th September, 1605. This day M{r} Jerrard was discharged of the\r\n  office of second Warden and upper governo{r} of this Company uppon\r\n  his suite & entreatie for certayne considerac͠ons. And is fyned for\r\n  the said places at x{li} which he is pˀntlie to pay to the pˀnte\r\n  M{rs} or governours And is hereafter to take his place as though he\r\n  had served the place of upper Governo{r} any thinge to the contrarie\r\n  notwithstandinge.\r\n\r\n7th November, 1605. The above order was rescinded, but shortly\r\nafterwards Mr. Gerard brought £10 into Court, and left it with the\r\nWardens, when it was ordered that the matter should be further\r\nconsidered, and in the result the fine was accepted.\r\n\r\n  21st October, 1606. This daie John Gerrard was fyned at vj{s} viij{d}\r\n  for abuseing M{r} Peck and it is ordered that from henceforth they\r\n  shall be freinds, and all Controversyes betweene them are to cease.\r\n\r\n20th July, 1607. Mr. Gerard was again appointed an Examiner of\r\nSurgeons, and 17th August following elected Master.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth is reported to have entertained a high opinion of Mr.\r\nGerard’s attainments, and he was also patronised by her Minister,\r\nWilliam Cecil, Lord Burleigh, whose garden he superintended for twenty\r\nyears. In the dedication of his Herbal to Lord Burleigh, in speaking of\r\nthe “care and studie” of herbs, he says--\r\n\r\n  Under your Lordship I have served, and that way imployed my\r\n  principall studie, and almost all my time now by the space of twenty\r\n  yeeres. To the large and singular furniture of this noble Iland, I\r\n  have added from forren places all the varietie of herbes and flowers\r\n  that I might any way obtaine, I have laboured with the soile to make\r\n  it fit for the plants, and with the plants to make them to delight in\r\n  the soile, that so they might live and prosper under our climate, as\r\n  in their native and proper countrie: what my successe hath beene, and\r\n  what my furniture is, I leave to the report of them that have seene\r\n  your Lordships gardens, and the little plot of my speciall care and\r\n  husbandrie.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous epistles, etc., laudatory of Gerard, prefixed to\r\nthe Herbal are some exceedingly quaint verses dedicated by “Thomas\r\nThorney[353] Master in Chirurgerie, to his learned friend and loving\r\nbrother in Art, M. John Gerard.” There is also an epistle by “George\r\nBaker, one of hir Maiesties chiefe Chirurgions in ordinarie, and M. of\r\nthe Chirurgions of the Citie of London.” Besides his garden in Holborn,\r\nGerard seems also to have had one in the Strand by Somerset House,\r\nand to have held the appointment of “Herbarist” to James I, for among\r\nthe Domestic State papers at the Record Office, is a grant dated 10th\r\nOctober, 1603, by Anne, Queen of James I to Sir Robert Cecil, Lord\r\nCecil of Essingdon, of the Keepership of Somerset House with all the\r\norchards, walks, gardens, &c., thereto belonging “except and alwaies\r\nreserved to John Gerrard of London Surgeon and herbarist to his Ma{tie}\r\nall that garden plott or peece of ground w{th} all and singular pˀfittꝭ\r\ncomodities and other the app̃tencꝭ therew{th} graunted and demised unto\r\nhim by one lease given under o{r} hand and seale at”[354] . . .\r\n\r\n[353] See p. 538.\r\n\r\n[354] The lease was dated 14th August, 1603, and was for 2 acres of\r\nland for Gerard’s life at a yearly rent of four pence, with a tribute\r\nof herbs, &c., if demanded.\r\n\r\nIn 1639 the Company purchased a copy of Gerard’s work for the Library.\r\n“Paid for M{r} John Gerrardꝭ herball for the library for Claspes &\r\nsettinge on the chaine . . . . . xxv{s} vj{d.}”\r\n\r\nJohn Gerard died in February, 1612, and was buried at St. Andrew’s,\r\nHolborn, on the 18th of that month. There is a fine portrait of Gerard\r\nfacing page 1 of the Herbal, in which he is represented holding a\r\npotato plant in his hand; below are the arms of the Barber-Surgeons\r\nand his own coat, viz., quarterly 1st and 4th ar. a lyon rampant erm.\r\ncrowned or, a crescent for difference (Gerard), 2nd and 3rd ar. three\r\ntorteaux in bend between two bendlets sa.

Jackson, F.L.S. London, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BLUDDER.\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS was the son of Sir Thomas Bludder, of Flanchford, in the\r\nparish of Reigate (who died 1st November, 1618). He was knighted at\r\nWhitehall, 22nd April, 1618, and married three times, his third wife\r\nbeing Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Brett, of Rotherby, Lancashire.\r\n\r\n  9th August, 1621. At this Court upon the request of Sir Thomas\r\n  Bludder Knyght who was desierous to be made a freman of this Company\r\n  It was ordered he shold be made free & so tooke his oath accordingly.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, who was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey, represented\r\nReigate in the several Parliaments of 21 James I, and 1, 3 and 16\r\nCharles I. He was a Royalist and imprisoned for his adherence to that\r\ncause, and died on 29th September, 1655.\r\n\r\nA pedigree of the Bludders will be found in Aubrey’s Antiquities of\r\nSurrey, IV, 210.\r\n\r\nArms.

He seems to have had an\r\nextensive practice, and in 1648 was living in Creed Lane. There are\r\nnumerous references to him in our Minutes, from which may be gathered\r\nthat he was a man of great experience, and well able to hold his own in\r\nsome cases where his professional skill had been called in question by\r\njealous brethren of the craft. He served as Warden in 1640 and 1645,\r\nand was Master in 1653, when he presented the Company with a loving\r\ncup (_see_ p. 502). He died 16th April, 1655, and in his will dated\r\n20th August, 1654, and proved 24th April, 1655, he describes himself\r\nas of the parish of St. Gregory, “full of yeares,” and requests to be\r\nburied in his parish church near his dead children “which was partly\r\nunder my owne pewe where now of late I satt.” To the poor of that\r\nparish he leaves £10. To the poor of East Tilbury 40_s._ To the poor of\r\nLouth, in Lincolnshire, £10. To his cousin Richard Mason, of Leeyborne,\r\nLincolnshire, £5, and to his son, Richard Mason, testator’s apprentice,\r\n£5 and his case of silver instruments, “with fower books of phisick and\r\nof Chirurgery namelie Ambrose Parrey and Rondeletius and Aqua Sendens\r\nhis mannuall operations and Tangaltius and others Authers all bound up\r\nin one volumne.” He gives several legacies of money to cousins, nieces,\r\nservants, and apprentices, makes his wife Margaret his executrix, and\r\nleaves all his lands and houses in the counties of Essex and Lincoln\r\nand the City of London to her for life, with remainder to his only\r\nchild Rebecca, the wife of Humphry Winch, Esquire. “To my cousen Henery\r\nBarker all my Instruments of yron for Chirurgerie excepte my Lancetts\r\nand incision knives. I likewise give [him] theise bookes namely the\r\nworkes of Hypocrates, Galen, Celsus, Paulus Agenta, ffernebens Senertus\r\nhis Chirurgery.”\r\n\r\nArms (as engraved on the loving cup).

His father, Jasper Arris, was apprenticed to Thomas\r\nBurston or Burstowe, a Surgeon and Master of the Company in 1576.\r\nJasper Arris (probably born 1560-2), was admitted to the freedom, 3rd\r\nApril, 1583, chosen a Liveryman, 22nd January, 1606, an Assistant, 3rd\r\nAugust, 1614, served as Warden in the years 1617 and 1622, and was\r\nreported on 8th January, 1623, as then recently deceased. There are\r\nfew notices of Jasper in our books, and one of them on 21st October,\r\n1606, is perhaps not much to his credit, as it records his fine for\r\nworking on the Sabbath day; from which we may gather that he was one\r\nof those who, contrary to the Ordinances and the Statute, worked both\r\nas a Barber and Surgeon,--a practice often winked at by the Governors.\r\nHis son Edward, was born in London in 1591, and was admitted to the\r\nfreedom by patrimony on 21st January, 1617, having learnt his art with\r\nhis father; he was admitted to the Livery 9th October, 1627, and on\r\n30th April, 1629, granted his diploma to practise Surgery. In 1632, he\r\nwas chosen Steward, and the next year Master of the Anatomy. On the\r\n23rd April, 1640, he was elected an Assistant and served the office of\r\nWarden in 1642. On 10th February, 1648, he was appointed one of the\r\nExaminers of Surgeons, and elected Master of the Company 1651. On 3rd\r\nJuly, 1663, Mr. Arris was nominated by the Court of Aldermen, Alderman\r\nof the Ward of Bridge Without (_loco_ Richard Evans) and was sworn\r\nin on the 28th July following, but this civic office was probably an\r\nuncongenial one to him, for he very shortly afterwards applied to be\r\ndischarged from it, and thereupon paid a fine of £300 to the City.\r\n\r\nIn 1645 Mr. Arris founded an Anatomy Lecture, and with a characteristic\r\nmodesty endeavoured to conceal the founder’s name, though his intention\r\nin this respect was necessarily frustrated when the deed of settlement\r\nhad to be drawn. This, the Arrisian Lecture, still survives at the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons. (Particulars of the foundation will be\r\nfound on pp. 368, 369.) In 1649, when our plate was sold, Mr. Arris\r\nre-purchased King Henry VIII’s cup, and “freely gave it againe to this\r\nCompany,” for which all Barber-Surgeons and Barbers have ever after\r\nbeen profoundly grateful to him. He also, in 1651, gave us four silver\r\ncups. Mr. Arris’ granddaughter, Henrietta Maria Langford, seems to have\r\ngot into straitened circumstances, as on 5th August, 1718, we read “It\r\nis ordered that Henrietta Maria Langford daughter of Robert Arris son\r\nof Alderman Arris Members of this Company, shall be made free without\r\ncharge, in Gratitude to the Memory of Alderman Arris, in order that\r\nshe may be admitted one of the Company’s Pentioners.”\r\n\r\nThe Alderman died 28th May, 1676, at the good old age of eighty-five\r\nand is buried in St. Sepulchre’s Church, where there is a quaint tablet\r\nwith this inscription--\r\n\r\n  EDWARD ARRIS ESQR.

He gave five legacies of £400 each and some smaller ones\r\namongst his grandchildren and an annuity of £30 a year to his grandson\r\nRobert. He also bequeathed messuages, lands, &c., at Hatfield, two\r\nmessuages in Well Yard, St. Bartholomew’s the Less, a messuage near\r\nPye Corner, ten acres of Copyhold land in the manor of Bedwell near\r\nHatfield and four freehold houses in the parish of St. Paul, Covent\r\nGarden, to his son and grandchildren. “I give Ten shillings a peece\r\nto soe many Antient men as I shall be yeares old att the tyme of my\r\ndeath to mourne in decent Gownes att my Burial whereof Tenn to be of\r\nthe parish of Little St. Bartholomews Tenn of the Company of Barber\r\nChirurgeons and the rest of the Parish of St. Sepulchres.” He also\r\nleft £8 to the poor of St. Sepulchre’s to be given to 160 poor at his\r\nburial; £5 to the poor of St. Bartholomew the Less; £5 to Christ’s\r\nHospital among 100 children to attend his burial; 20_s._ each to the\r\ntwo Beadles of the Barber-Surgeons, and 5_s._ each to the four Beadles\r\nof St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; also £5 to Dr. Bell to preach a sermon\r\nat his burial.\r\n\r\nArms.

A\r\nminute of the 9th June, 1595, states that “the said Xpõfer ffrederick\r\nbeing a strainger borne had his ffreedom geven him of the Cittie of\r\nLondon by vertue of her Mat{ies} most gracious Lrẽs to the Lord maior\r\nand Corte of Aldrem̃e directed and was made fre of this Companie and\r\nafter chosen of the lyvery and then one of Thassistance.”\r\n\r\nChristopher Frederick was on more than one occasion at serious variance\r\nwith the Court, as also with some of its members, and a resolution was\r\npassed, evidently with pointed allusion to him, viz., that in future\r\naliens should be ineligible for the Court. He was Serjeant-Surgeon\r\nto James I, and probably to Elizabeth also; Master in 1609 and again\r\nin 1616. His son William was admitted to the freedom by service 27th\r\nOctober, 1607. Christopher Frederick was buried 10th October, 1623,\r\nin the church of St. Olave, Jewry, where also Mary, his widow, was\r\ninterred on 6th June, 1636. They had issue six sons and six daughters.\r\n\r\nJohn Frederick, the fourth son, was baptized 25th October, 1601, and\r\neducated at Christ’s Hospital. On 17th July, 1632 he was admitted\r\nto the freedom by patrimony, on the 13th November, 1635 elected to\r\nthe Livery, and on 30th January, 1645 made an Assistant. He was a\r\nsuccessful merchant and resided in a large mansion on the site of what\r\nis now Frederick’s Place, Old Jewry (which he rebuilt after the Great\r\nFire in 1666). This house was afterwards used as the Excise Office,\r\nupon the removal of which to Broad Street, the building was taken down\r\nand the present houses erected. He was elected Alderman of Vintry\r\nSeptember, 1653, and in 1660 removed to Coleman Street Ward. He was\r\nMaster of the Barber-Surgeons in 1654 and again in 1658; he served as\r\nSheriff, 1655-6, and was then knighted. The Barber-Surgeons attended\r\nSir John in their barge to Westminster when he went to be sworn in as\r\nSheriff, and ordered his portrait to be painted at a cost of £15. This\r\nfine picture representing the Sheriff in his robes and with a flowing\r\nwig, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall. In 1661 Sir John was translated to\r\nthe Grocers’ Company to enable him to take upon him the office of Lord\r\nMayor, which he served 1661-2. The pageant performed at the expense of\r\nthe Grocers upon his accession to the Mayoralty was entitled “Londons\r\nTryumphs presented in several delightfull Scænes,” and was composed\r\nby John Tatham; a copy of this very rare tract is preserved in the\r\nGuildhall Library. Pepys, under date 29th October, 1661, writes--\r\n\r\n  This day I put on my half cloth black stockings and my new coate of\r\n  the fashion, which pleases me well, and with my bever I was (after\r\n  office was done) ready to go to my Lord Mayor’s feast, as we are all\r\n  invited; but the Sir Williams were both loth to go, because of the\r\n  crowd, and so none of us went. My mind not pleased because I had\r\n  proposed a great deal of pleasure to myself this day at Guildhall.\r\n  This Lord Mayor, it seems, brings up again the custom of Lord Mayors\r\n  going the day of their instalment to Paul’s and walking round about\r\n  the Crosse, and offering something at the Altar.\r\n\r\nIn 1662 Sir John was elected Master of the Grocers’ Company and also\r\nPresident of Christ’s Hospital, which latter office he held until 1683.\r\nIn the Parliament of 1660 he represented Dartmouth; on the 10th March,\r\n1663, he was elected one of the Members for the City and so continued\r\nuntil the dissolution in January, 1679. In 1674 he gave £100 towards\r\nrebuilding Barber-Surgeons’ Hall; he also repaired and fitted up the\r\nGreat Hall at Christ’s Hospital at a cost of £5,000. In 1664 he bore\r\nthe expense of bringing the Conduit Water from Gray’s Inn Fields to\r\nthe Hospital. In 1667 he gave £50 and twenty chaldrons of sea coal,\r\nand by his Will bequeathed £500 to the Hospital. In 1654 he gave a\r\nhandsome silver loving cup and cover weighing about 38 oz. to the\r\nBarber-Surgeons; this cup is still used on festive occasions. There is\r\na portrait of Sir John at Christ’s Hospital, which represents him as\r\nseated in an arm chair, in his civic robes, with an open letter in his\r\nhand, on his head is a full bottomed wig and a black cap, he has white\r\nwhiskers and a tuft of white hair on his under lip.\r\n\r\nIn the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for November, 1769, is a copy of a\r\ndocument prepared for Charles II, giving the characters of the Lord\r\nMayor and Aldermen, which says of Sir John Frederick that--\r\n\r\n  by reason of his age, he is apt to be ledd by others, especially by\r\n  Sir John Lawrence, a man of little dispatch, very readie to run into\r\n  mistakes; he hates a souldier, and cannot endure to see any of the\r\n  King’s guards.\r\n\r\nSir John married Mary Rous by whom he had issue four sons and nine\r\ndaughters. Judith, his eldest daughter, married Sir Nathaniel Herne\r\n(Alderman and Sheriff 1674 and Master of the Barber-Surgeons 1674),\r\nwho, dying in August, 1679, she married secondly, Robert Hooker, of\r\nHatton Garden. Her Will, dated in 1688, was proved 30th June, 1691.\r\n\r\nSir John Frederick was buried in the Church of St. Olave Jewry 19th\r\nMarch, 1685, where his widow was also interred 19th December, 1689; she\r\nbequeathed £300 to Christ’s Hospital. His eldest son Thomas was the\r\nfather of John Frederick who was created a baronet 10th June, 1723. Sir\r\nJohn gave marriage portions of £3,000 apiece to his daughters Judith\r\nand Elizabeth, who married respectively Sir Nathaniel Herne and Sir\r\nJoseph Herne, and he covenanted to give £2,000 apiece more either in\r\nhis lifetime or by will; it seems that he did this by will, which led\r\nto litigation, his relict (to whom he left about £10,000) laying claim\r\nto some portion of these legacies by the custom of London.\r\n\r\n_Arms_ (granted by Sir Ed.

He was born in 1629 and in 1646\r\napprenticed at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall to Sir John Frederick, one of the\r\nmerchant-princes of London at that time. Herne was admitted to the\r\nfreedom on 7th May, 1655, and, like the typical industrious apprentice,\r\nhe married his master’s daughter, Judith Frederick, by whom he had\r\n(among others) a daughter Judith who married William, second Earl of\r\nJersey, and thereby was one of the ancestors of the present Earl. Sir\r\nNathaniel Herne was a most successful merchant and amassed a large\r\nfortune. In 1674 he was Sheriff of London (being knighted at Windsor on\r\nthe 9th August) and Master of this Company. On the 11th April, 1676, he\r\nwas elected Alderman of the Ward of Billingsgate. He was sometime M.P.\r\nfor Dartmouth, and a Governor of the East India Company. He died 16th\r\nAugust, 1679, being then fifty years of age and was buried at St. Olave\r\nJewry, where there is a monument to his memory, with his arms impaling\r\nFrederick, and this inscription:--\r\n\r\n                                 M S.\r\n\r\n  Here lyeth in hopes of a Glorious Resurrection the body of S{r}\r\n  Nathaniel Herne Knight late Sherife And at his death Alderman of this\r\n  Famous Citty and Governour of the Honourable East India Company, Son\r\n  to Nicholas and Grandson to Richard Herne sometimes Alderman allso of\r\n  this Citty A Person of great Prudence and Indefatigable Industry in\r\n  the Management of all Publick Affairs, of Exemplary Piety, Spotless\r\n  Integrity and Diffusive Charity having with his owne hand dispenced\r\n  very considerable summes to many Charitable uses Particularly to the\r\n  reliefe of poore Seamen & Educating of their Children.

His grandfather John was a merchant at\r\nCologne and died there in 1593. His widow survived him thirty-eight\r\nyears and came over to England in 1605 with her only son John, who was\r\nborn in 1591. In 1620 he was established as a Merchant in London, but\r\non the breaking out of the Civil Wars he went over to Amsterdam and\r\nreturned to England at the Restoration; he lived at Lewisham, where he\r\ndied on 2nd November, 1679, having married Jane, daughter of John de\r\nla Fortre, of London, by whom he had five sons and three daughters.\r\nHis eldest son, Sir John Lethieullier, was apprenticed to Sir John\r\nFrederick (Barber-Surgeon) and admitted to the freedom by servitude\r\n11th November, 1657. He served the office of Master in 1676, having\r\nbeen Sheriff of London in 1674. He was a successful merchant and a rich\r\nman, having a great fortune by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir William\r\nHooker, who was Lord Mayor in 1673. Sir John was a free brother of\r\nthe Company of Merchant Adventurers of England, and of the Society of\r\nMerchants of London Trading to the Levant Seas and the East Indies.\r\nHis third brother, Sir Christopher Lethieullier was Sheriff of London,\r\n1689, and died 1690. On the 20th November, 1707, Sir John wrote to the\r\nCourt asking to be relieved from the office of an Assistant on account\r\nof his indisposition and age (he was then 74), but the Court, out of a\r\nfeeling of respect towards him, refused to accept his resignation,\r\nand ordered that the Wardens should have a personal interview with him\r\nto know his pleasure. This was done, and on the 15th January following\r\nhis resignation was accepted. Sir John, who resided at Greenwich, died\r\nthere on the 4th January, 1719, having had two sons, John and William\r\n(both of whom were free of the Company), and three daughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Family tree]\r\n\r\nSir John Lethieullier’s will, of prodigious length, is dated 6th May,\r\n1709, and he therein directs that he shall be buried in the vault in\r\nGreenwich Church with his late wife. To his two daughters, Letitia\r\nand Leonora he gave £10,200 each, and to his married daughter, Lady\r\nAnn Dodwell, whom he had previously provided for, £1,000. To all his\r\ngrandchildren £100 each. To Christ’s and St. Thomas’ Hospitals and to\r\nthe French Congregation in Threadneedle Street £100 each, numerous\r\ngifts to the poor in various parishes, and bequests to friends,\r\nrelatives and servants for mourning and rings.

There are four codicils to this Will\r\nand by one of them (19th July, 1714) he gave the manor of Rowhill,\r\nwhich he had then lately purchased to his son William. His two sons\r\nwere appointed executors.\r\n\r\nArms.

In 1652 he\r\nwas apprenticed to Sir John Frederick, and afterwards became a wealthy\r\nMerchant trading with Spain. He was sometime the British Consul at\r\nLivorne. On 25th April, 1665, he was admitted to the freedom of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, and in 1673 gave us the chimney piece in the Court\r\nRoom, where there is a three-quarter portrait of him in his livery\r\ngown, with full wig and rich lace bands; on the portrait is this\r\ninscription: “M{r} Ephraim Skiner Marcht. & one of y{e} Assistants of\r\nthis Compy: of Barbersurgeons Lond: gave y{m} besides other gifts 300£\r\nfor 20 years.”\r\n\r\nBy his Will, dated 27th December, 1677, he gave to the Governors of\r\nChrist’s Hospital (of which he was a member) five acres of pasture in\r\nIslington, also £700 in trust for them to lend the Barber-Surgeons £300\r\nfor 20 years without interest to help them to pay their debts, and also\r\nfor a payment of 5_s._ a week to the Minister of Islington for him to\r\nexpound and “chatecize” every Sunday afternoon and to pay £5 a year\r\nto the poor of Islington, to whom he also bequeathed a sum of £50.

He was the only son of William Edwin (sometime\r\nMayor of Hereford) by his wife Anne Mansfield, and grandson of William\r\nEdwin of the Field next Hereford. One of his sisters (Mary) was\r\nmarried to Sir Edward Dering. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel\r\nSambrooke, a London merchant, and a sister of Sir Jeremy Sambrooke;\r\nby her he had four sons, born between 1671 and 1677, viz., Samuel,\r\nHumphry, Thomas and Charles.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd February, 1679, he was admitted to our freedom; on\r\n11th October, 1687, he was sworn in Alderman of Tower Ward on the\r\ndirect appointment of James II; on the 18th November following he\r\nwas knighted at Whitehall, and a few weeks later appointed Sheriff\r\nof Glamorganshire, in which county he had purchased considerable\r\nestates. In 1688 Edwin was chosen Sheriff of London and Master of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons. In 1689 he took official part in the Proclamation\r\nof William and Mary in the City, and shortly after was appointed a\r\nCommissioner of Excise with a salary of £1,000; he was also an officer\r\nin the Honourable Artillery Company, and a Colonel of the Trained Bands.\r\n\r\nIn 1691 Edwin was the victim of a malicious prosecution; he was\r\nindicted for perjury, and a true bill found against him, but on his\r\ntrial was acquitted, Lord Chief Justice Holt not calling on him to\r\nswear all his witnesses. Sir Humphry owned extensive property near\r\nWestminster Hall, he also had a mansion at Kensington, and added to\r\nhis Glamorganshire property the castle and lordship of Ogmore. In\r\n1697 his eldest son Samuel was married to Lady Catharine Montagu,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Manchester, and the same year Sir Humphry was\r\nelected Lord Mayor of London, having been previously translated from\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons to the Skinners’ Company. The customary mayoralty\r\npageant was omitted, owing, doubtless, to Edwin’s religious scruples,\r\nhe being a Nonconformist. Soon after his admission as Lord Mayor, he\r\ngave great offence by attending Nonconformist worship at a conventicle\r\non the afternoons of Sunday, 31st October and 7th November, in full\r\ncivic state. A meeting of the Court of Aldermen was held 9th November\r\nto consider a complaint of the Swordbearer against the Lord Mayor,\r\nfor compelling his attendance on the occasion when the Lord Mayor was\r\ndeserted by all his officers except the Swordbearer, whom one of the\r\nchapel officials had locked in a pew! According to the minute, the\r\nCourt took notice that the Lord Mayor had “for two Lords dayes past in\r\nthe afternoones gone to private meetings with the sword,” whereupon\r\nhis Lordship promised to forbear the practice for the future. Edwin’s\r\naction roused all the bitterness of the High Church party and caused an\r\nangry literary controversy in which Dr. Nicholls, James Peirce, Calamy\r\nand Defoe joined, and in which the question of “occasional conformity”\r\nwas raised. Edwin had on his election received the Sacrament in\r\naccordance with the rites of the Church of England, and his friend\r\nDefoe took him very severely to task for this, charging him with having\r\n“played bo-peep with God Almighty.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th April, 1694, Sir Humphry Edwin was dismissed from the\r\nCourt of Assistants of our Company on account of his continued\r\nnon-attendance. He died 14th December, 1707, at his country seat at\r\nLlanmihangel, intestate, administration being granted to his son\r\nCharles on 19th February following. His widow died in London 22nd\r\nNovember, 1714. Besides the children already mentioned he had four\r\ndaughters and a fifth son John, from whom is descended the present Earl\r\nof Crawford and Balcarres.\r\n\r\nArms.

In 1706 he was one of the Directors of the East India\r\nCompany. On 31st July, 1711, he was elected Alderman of Cripplegate,\r\nand the following year was knighted.\r\n\r\n  21st July, 1720. The Master acquainted the Court That S{r} William\r\n  Stewart Kn{t} and Alderman of the City of London a Freeman of this\r\n  Company being the Senior Alderman under the Chair of this City except\r\n  one Did make it his request to this Court That he might be translated\r\n  from this Company to the Company of Goldsmiths forasmuch as it was\r\n  required by the Custom of London That he should be free of one of the\r\n  first twelve Companys of this City before he could be put in elecc͠on\r\n  to be Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\nSir William was Lord Mayor for the year 1721-2, and died at his house\r\nin Mark Lane, 29th April, 1723. His corpse was carried, preceded by\r\na hundred boys of Christ’s Hospital and fifty boys belonging to the\r\nLondon Workhouse, each with a wax taper in his hand, and was interred\r\nat Guildhall Chapel 7th May following.\r\n\r\nHis Will is dated 28th March, 1723, and by it he bequeaths various\r\nlegacies of £2,000 each to nephews and nieces, and sundry other\r\nsmaller legacies to friends and servants, etc. £700 to St.\r\nBartholomews, and £100 each to St. Thomas’, Christ’s and Bethlem\r\nHospitals. £50 to the London Workhouse, £500 to his housekeeper Mrs.\r\nAnn Smedley, etc.\r\n\r\nArms.

On 16th August, 1670 (his father being then dead), he\r\nwas apprenticed to Henry Boone, Surgeon, for seven years, and on 4th\r\nDecember, 1677, was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons; on\r\n25th October, 1697, he was chosen an Assistant, and on 8th November,\r\n1700, an Examiner of Surgeons in the place of Thomas Lichfield. In 1702\r\nhe was appointed Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne, and in 1703 he was\r\nMaster of the Company. One of his brothers, Dr. Francis Bernard, was\r\nphysician to James II, and he had another brother, Dr. William Bernard.\r\nCharles Bernard died at Lord Weymouth’s house, Long Leate, Wilts,\r\non 9th October, 1710, and shortly afterwards the Company caused his\r\nportrait to be painted. There is a Latin inscription below it which is\r\nhighly eulogistic of Bernard, the following being a translation:--\r\n\r\n  This portrait of Charles Bernard Esquire, Royal Surgeon in Chief,\r\n  most learned in Greek and Latin letters, most experienced, candid\r\n  and upright in his profession, enjoying the greatest favour with\r\n  the Most Serene Queen Anne, the greatest fame among the laity, the\r\n  greatest authority among his fellows, the greatest esteem among all,\r\n  in consideration of the remission by the same Most Serene Queen at\r\n  his prayer of a heavy sum of nearly one thousand pounds in which this\r\n  Company was bound to the Royal Exchequer, and in consideration of\r\n  his advancement of Surgical science, his assertion and augmentation\r\n  of its dignity, and other brilliant services to the Surgeons, the\r\n  Company caused this portrait to be painted after his death 1711.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard possessed a valuable library containing a curious\r\ncollection of the best authors in Physic, Philology, Antiquities,\r\n&c., together with many ancient manuscripts, all of which were sold\r\nby Auction in March, 1711, at the Black Boy Coffee House in Ave Maria\r\nLane. Swift in his Journal to Stella, March 19th, says,\r\n\r\n  I went to-day to see poor Charles Bernard’s books, and I itch to lay\r\n  out nine or ten pounds for some fine Editions of fine authors * * *\r\n  I walked to-day into the City, and went to see the auction of poor\r\n  Charles Bernard’s books. They were in the middle of Physic books, so\r\n  I bought none, and they are so dear I believe I shall buy none.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of these books is in the Sloane collection (1770).\r\n\r\nIn Nichols’ Literary Anecdotes is a story of Mr. Edward Thwaites, M.A.,\r\nFellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, which characteristically introduces\r\nMr. Bernard.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard’s daughter Elizabeth was married to Ambrose Dickins,\r\nEsquire (who was Master in 1629 and Serjeant-Surgeon).\r\n\r\nBy his Will, dated 7th November, 1707, he bequeathed to his wife Susan,\r\n£500 and his houses in Broad Street, Pissing Alley and Milk Street.\r\nTo his daughter Susan £1,000, and other bequests to his daughters\r\nElizabeth and Mary, his son Charles and his sister Jane.

On\r\n5th December, 1710, he was admitted to the freedom and livery of\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons, on the 29th January following he had a full\r\ncertificate to practise as a Surgeon, and he then (being but twenty-two\r\nyears of age) began his lectures on anatomy, and the following year was\r\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nBy a minute in our books of 25th March, 1714, it seems that Mr.\r\nCheselden had often procured the bodies of malefactors and privately\r\ndissected them at his own house, and that at times when lectures and\r\ndissections were proceeding at the Hall, whereby the attendance at the\r\nHall was diminished, and moreover contrary to the express laws of the\r\nCompany; whereupon he was summoned before the Court and reproved, when\r\nhe promised not to offend again in like manner. A less influential man\r\nwould probably have been fined.\r\n\r\nIn 1719 he was elected Surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital, where he highly\r\ndistinguished himself in his operations for the stone. He was also\r\nconsulting Surgeon to St. George’s and the Westminster Infirmary. In\r\n1727 he was appointed principal Surgeon to Queen Caroline, and ten\r\nyears later was chosen Head Surgeon to Chelsea Hospital, which post he\r\nheld till his death. He married Miss Deborah Knight of London, by whom\r\nhe had an only daughter. His practice was both extensive and lucrative,\r\nand his works on Surgery are numerous, besides which he was a frequent\r\ncontributor to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Mr.\r\nCheselden died at Bath on the 10th April, 1752.\r\n\r\nDr. J. F. Payne says that he will always be regarded as, beyond\r\ndispute, one of the greatest of British surgeons, being one of the most\r\nbrilliant operators whose achievements are upon record; he was a keen\r\npatron of athletic sports, especially boxing; his disposition was gay\r\nand genial, he was fond of society, and evidently popular, while to his\r\npatients he was always kind and tender-hearted.\r\n\r\nOn the separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers in 1745, Mr.\r\nCheselden was named in the Act of Parliament one of the Wardens of\r\nthe new Company of Surgeons, he having been Junior Warden of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons that year. His will is a remarkable specimen of brevity\r\nand absence of formality:--\r\n\r\n  Being in perfect health I write this with my own hand and declare\r\n  it to be my last Will and Testament. I give to my daughter W. J.\r\n  Cotes five hundred pounds and all the rest and residue of my estate\r\n  of what kind soever to my wife and make her full and sole Executrix\r\n  administratrix and assign Witness my hand and seal.

On the 17th February, 1702, he was apprenticed to\r\nSerjeant-Surgeon Charles Bernard for seven years, and on the 16th\r\nFebruary, 1709, he was admitted to the Freedom and Livery of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, when he was residing in James Street, Covent Garden.\r\nHe married (before the 24th March, 1709) Elizabeth, daughter of Charles\r\nBernard. On December 20th, 1721, he was elected Surgeon to Westminster\r\nHospital. His old master, Charles Bernard, died in October, 1710, and\r\nit seems that Dickins succeeded him when quite a young man in the\r\nimportant office of Serjeant-Surgeon. In 1728 he was Warden of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, and in 1729 Master of the Company. He was Surgeon\r\nto St. George’s Hospital 1733-38. On the separation of the Surgeons\r\nfrom the Barbers in 1745, Mr. Dickins became an Assistant of the\r\nSurgeons’ Company and an Examiner of Surgeons. He probably died in\r\n1747, as on 7th September in that year Mr. Cæsar Hawkins was appointed\r\nSerjeant-Surgeon in his place.\r\n\r\nDr. John Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, in “The Criterion,” introduces\r\nMr. Dickins’ name in an interesting paragraph. Dr. Douglas was a firm\r\nbeliever in the efficacy of the Royal touch for the King’s evil, and\r\nhe gives some curious particulars of Mr. Dickins’ experience in this\r\nmatter which are well worth referring to.\r\n\r\nArms.

M{r} Cæsar Hawkins Surgeon in Bloomsbury who had\r\n  lived several years with his father a Surgeon in the Country and\r\n  afterwards with M{r} Ranby a Foreign Brother of the Company seven\r\n  years, but not bound an Apprentice at the Hall, was in consideration\r\n  thereof, admitted into the freedom of the Company for six pounds six\r\n  shillings which he paid down and was sworne. At the same time the\r\n  said M{r} Cæsar Hawkins was examined touching his skill in Surgery\r\n  his answers were approved of and he was ordered the Diploma under the\r\n  hands of the Governors and the seal of the Company testifying his\r\n  skill and impowering him to practice.\r\n\r\n19th August, 1736. Mr. Hawkins was admitted to the Livery, and the same\r\nday was chosen a Demonstrator of Anatomy, being then but twenty-five\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n  18th August, 1737. M{r} Cæsar Hawkins one of the Demonstrators of\r\n  Anatomy attended at this Court and surrendered the said office and\r\n  after returning this Court his thanks for the honor they had done\r\n  him to choose him one of their Demonstrators acquainted them that he\r\n  being appointed Surgeon to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,\r\n  and also Surgeon to one of the troops of Guards, could not perform\r\n  the office of a Demonstrator and therefore the Court accepted of such\r\n  surrender.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins, in addition to his other appointments, was Surgeon to\r\nSt. George’s Hospital, 1735-1774, and Serjeant-Surgeon to George III,\r\nto which latter office he was appointed 7th September, 1747. By his\r\npractice as a phlebotomist alone he is said to have made £1,000 a\r\nyear, it then being the custom for people to be bled at the spring and\r\nfall of the year.\r\n\r\nHis family have been Surgeons for some generations, and have held\r\ndistinguished office, his brother Pennell Hawkins, his son Charles,\r\nand his grandson Cæsar Henry, having all been Serjeant-Surgeons. On\r\nthe 25th July, 1778, Mr. Hawkins was created a Baronet; he died 13th\r\nFebruary, 1786. A portrait of him, by Hogarth, is in the Hall of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nArms.

He was\r\nadmitted to the freedom and livery of the Company 5th January, 1864.\r\nMr. Wilkin commenced his career as articled clerk to a well-known\r\nfirm of underwriters at Lloyds, but subsequently entered himself at\r\nthe Middle Temple, where he read with Mr. Crump, Q.C., and passing\r\nhis examination and obtaining the Certificate of the Council of Legal\r\nEducation, he was called to the Bar; but in consequence of the deaths\r\nof his father and brother, he retired from the profession of the law to\r\ntake upon himself the conduct of their business in the City. In 1878\r\nMr. Wilkin was chosen an Assistant of this Company, and in 1885 served\r\nthe office of Master. For twelve years he sat as one of the Common\r\nCouncil for the Ward of Lime Street. On the death of Sir Robert Walter\r\nCarden, Mr. Alderman Cotton was transferred from Lime Street to Bridge\r\nWithout, and the vacancy thus occasioned in the Court of Aldermen, was\r\nfilled up by the appointment of Mr. Wilkin in February, 1888. He is a\r\nmember of the Court of Assistants of the Broderers’ Company, and has\r\nfilled the office of G.S. and Master in Grand Master’s Lodge No. 1.\r\nFor twenty-six years Mr. Wilkin was a Volunteer, rising to the rank of\r\nLieut.-Colonel in the 3rd Middlesex Artillery, but has now resigned his\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\n1469.

(_See page 157._)\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE BARBERS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n  The _Barbers_ of _London_ were a _Fraternity_ before the Time of\r\n  _Edward the Second_, and by Letters-Patent of _Edward the Fourth_\r\n  were made a _Body Corporate_, and invested with several Powers and\r\n  Privileges. In the 32d Year of _Henry the Eighth_, the _publick_\r\n  Policy thought proper to _unite_ them with another Company (not\r\n  then _incorporated_) called the _Surgeons_ of _London_, in order,\r\n  (as is most probable) to _transfer_ those Powers and Privileges to\r\n  the _latter_, without directly appearing to _wrest_ them from the\r\n  _former_ to whom they had been _originally_ granted.\r\n\r\n  The _Coalition_ of the two Companies having now subsisted above _Two\r\n  Hundred Years_, the _Barbers_ are surpris’d to find an _Attempt_ made\r\n  by the _Surgeons_ to _dissolve_ it, by Authority of _Parliament_,\r\n  without their Participation or Consent.\r\n\r\n  The _principal Reasons_ assigned by the _Surgeons_, in their printed\r\n  Case, to induce the legislature to the _extraordinary_ Act of Power,\r\n  are,\r\n\r\n  _First_, That the _Barbers_, in the Time of _Henry the Eighth_,\r\n  were all _Surgeons_, and that the Parliament, by _uniting_ them\r\n  with others of _superior_ Abilities, intended _their_ Improvement\r\n  in _that_ Profession; but that they having, long since, _ceased_ to\r\n  intermeddle with any Branch of _Surgery_, this _Intent_ of the Act is\r\n  frustrated, and the laudable _Purpose_ of the _Union_ at an end.\r\n\r\n  _Secondly_, That by this _Alteration_ of the Circumstances of things,\r\n  the Junction of the two Companies (how advantageous soever in\r\n  _former_ Times) is _now_ become highly _inconvenient_.\r\n\r\n  _Thirdly_, That the _Surgeons_ if _distinctly_ incorporated, would\r\n  be encouraged to _meet_ and _communicate_ to one another their\r\n  Experiments and Successes.\r\n\r\n  And _Fourthly_, That the like Separation has taken place at _Paris_,\r\n  _Edinburgh_, and _Glascow_.\r\n\r\n  BUT the _first_ of these _Reasons_ is grounded on a _Mistake_ in\r\n  point of _Fact_; for tho’ it be _true_ that the _Barbers_ were _all\r\n  originally Surgeons_, and incorporated _as such_, yet long _before_\r\n  the Union in question, _most_ of them had _quitted_ the _actual\r\n  Exercise_ of that Profession, and the _Right_ itself of exercising\r\n  it _in virtue_ of their Charter, had been _taken away_[373] by\r\n  Parliament: And tho’ in the _Preamble_ of the uniting Act, _both_\r\n  Companies are stiled _Surgeons_, yet from the _Enacting_[374] Part\r\n  (which expresly _restrains_ the _Barbers_ from occupying any part of\r\n  _Surgery_, except _Tooth-drawing_) it is evident the _Legislature_\r\n  did not consider them as _real_ Surgeons, nor could intend their\r\n  _Improvement_ in a Science they were _forbid_ to _practise_, so\r\n  that the Circumstances of Things are _not_ altered from what they\r\n  _then_ were, or from what they manifestly were _designed_ to be; and\r\n  therefore the _Barbers_ having no Relation to the _Surgeons_, or\r\n  their Art (as it was _then_ deemed no _Objection_ to their _Union_)\r\n  cannot _now_, with any Propriety, be insisted on as a _Reason_ for\r\n  their _Separation_.\r\n\r\n  [373] _3 H. 8. Ch._ 11. No Person within the City of _London_, nor\r\n  within seven Miles, shall occupy as a _Surgeon_, except he be first\r\n  examined, approved, and admitted by the Bishop of _London_ or Dean of\r\n  St. _Paul’s_.\r\n\r\n  [374] _32 H. 8. Ch. 42. Sect. 3._ No Person within the City of\r\n  _London_, Suburbs of the same, and one Mile Compass of the said City,\r\n  using any Barbery or Shaving, shall occupy any Surgery, Letting of\r\n  Blood, or any other Thing belonging to Surgery, Drawing of Teeth only\r\n  except.\r\n\r\n  With regard to the _Inconveniences_ complained of, as the Charge\r\n  is _general_, this _general_ Answer only can be given, That the\r\n  _Barbers_ have always, with the greatest Deference, _submitted_ to\r\n  the _Surgeons_ in all Matters _peculiar_ to them, and chearfully\r\n  contributed, out of their _common_ Stock, towards every Expence\r\n  which _they_ have declared necessary for the Honour or Advancement\r\n  of _their_ Profession. And since _none_ of these Inconveniences have\r\n  been of Consequence enough to deserve being _particularly_ pointed\r\n  out, we may venture to pronounce them _inconsiderable_, and unworthy\r\n  the Attention and Redress of _Parliament_; and the rather, as _all_\r\n  of them put together, have not prevented the _Surgeons_ of _London_\r\n  from carrying the Improvement of their Art, both in Speculation and\r\n  Practice, to a greater Height than has been done in any other Place\r\n  or Nation.\r\n\r\n  That the frequent Meetings of ingenious Men, and their free\r\n  Communications on the Subject of their Profession, may tend _to the\r\n  Benefit of Mankind in general, and to the Honour of their Country\r\n  in particular_, is not denied: But surely the Constitution of the\r\n  _united_ Company is no obstacle to these laudable Purposes. The\r\n  _Barbers_ have for many Years, at their Monthly Courts, submitted\r\n  to _withdraw_ at a stated Hour, and _resigned_ the Parlour to the\r\n  Surgeons: And if this _Condescension_ is not supposed to afford\r\n  them _sufficient_ Time for Conversation on these _particular_ Days,\r\n  nothing _hinders_ them from holding _seperate_ Assemblies at the Hall\r\n  almost _every_ other Day in the Year.\r\n\r\n  As to what is said to have been done at _Paris_, _Edinburgh_, and\r\n  _Glascow_, no _particular_ answer can be given, unless it appeared\r\n  by what _Means_, for what _Reasons_, and upon what _Terms_ the\r\n  _Separations_ in those Places were brought about. In _London_\r\n  there are but two Instances of Separations of Companies, _viz._\r\n  that of the _Feltmakers_ from the _Haberdashers_ in 1604, and that\r\n  of the _Apothecaries_ from the _Grocers_ in 1617; but both these\r\n  were effected by _mutual_ Consent, without the Intervention of\r\n  _Parliament_; and it may be proper to observe, that the Feltmakers\r\n  miscarried in a former Application for an exclusive Charter in 1576\r\n  for _want_ of the Haberdashers Consent.\r\n\r\n  Upon the whole, therefore, the _Barbers_ humbly hope the forgoing\r\n  Reasons will be deemed _insufficient_ to induce the _Legislature_\r\n  to destroy an _Union_ they _themselves_ thought proper to _form_,\r\n  an Union which two hundred Years Existence has rendred _venerable_,\r\n  and which, by the _Improvements_ above-mentioned, appears to have\r\n  answered all the _Purposes_ for which it was established.\r\n\r\n  But if for _other_ Reasons (which the _Surgeons_ say _may_ be\r\n  given) the Parliament shall be inclined to favour them in _this\r\n  part_ of their request; the _Barbers_, from the scrupulous Regard\r\n  and Tenderness which that _August Assembly_ has always shewn for\r\n  _private Property_, cannot but hope they shall be _continued_ in the\r\n  Enjoyment of _all_ their present Possessions, without any _Division_\r\n  whatsoever, and that, for the following Reasons:\r\n\r\n  _First_, Because most of the _united_ Company’s Lands and Tenements,\r\n  (particularly the Site of their _Hall, Parlour, &c._) originally\r\n  belonged to _them_, and by the uniting Act[375] seem with great\r\n  Justice to have been intended to remain to their _sole_ and\r\n  _separate_ Use, tho’ in fact the _Surgeons_ have hitherto been\r\n  _indulged_ in the _equal_ Enjoyment of them with the _Barbers_.\r\n\r\n  [375] _32 H. 8. Ch. 42._ The united Company shall have, possess, and\r\n  enjoy, to them and their Successors for ever, all such Lands and\r\n  Tenements, and other Hereditaments whatsoever, which the said Company\r\n  or Commonalty of _Barbers_ have and enjoy, _to the Use_ of the said\r\n  Mystery and Commonalty of _Barbers_ of London.\r\n\r\n  _Secondly_, Because the _Surgeons Share_ of what may have been\r\n  acquired _since_ the Union, will scarce be an _adequate_ Recompence\r\n  to the _Barbers_ for the above _Indulgence_, much less for\r\n  the unmerited _Loss_ of a Brotherhood now so _honourable_ and\r\n  _advantageous_ to them.\r\n\r\n  _Thirdly_, Because the Expenses of the _Barbers_ when _distinctly_\r\n  incorporated, can fall but very little, if any thing, short of those\r\n  of the _united_ Company, so that a Reduction of _Income_ must subject\r\n  them to very great Difficulties, which (considering that _they_\r\n  neither desire, nor have given the _Surgeons_ just Cause to desire a\r\n  Separation) would be extremely hard and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n  _Lastly_, Because the present _flourishing_ Condition of the\r\n  _Surgeons_, (the only _real_ Alteration in the Circumstances of\r\n  Things) will sufficiently enable them to support the Dignity of their\r\n  _new_ and _favourite_ Institution with becoming _Splendor_, without\r\n  distressing their _less happy_ Brethren the _Barbers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\nACT OF PARLIAMENT 18 GEO.
